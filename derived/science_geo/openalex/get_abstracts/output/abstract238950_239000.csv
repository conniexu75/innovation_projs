https://openalex.org/W1970101770,"In animals, cells are dependent on extracellular signals to prevent apoptosis. However, using growth factor-dependent cells from Bax/Bak-deficient mice, we demonstrate that apoptosis is not essential to limit cell autonomous survival. Following growth factor withdrawal, Bax−/−Bak−/− cells activate autophagy, undergo progressive atrophy, and ultimately succumb to death. These effects result from loss of the ability to take up sufficient nutrients to maintain cellular bioenergetics. Despite abundant extracellular nutrients, growth factor-deprived cells maintain ATP production from catabolism of intracellular substrates through autophagy. Autophagy is essential for maintaining cell survival following growth factor withdrawal and can sustain viability for several weeks. During this time, cells respond to growth factor readdition by rapid restoration of the ability to take up and metabolize glucose and by subsequent recovery of their original size and proliferative potential. Thus, growth factor signal transduction is required to direct the utilization of sufficient exogenous nutrients to maintain cell viability."
https://openalex.org/W2049195203,"Brassinosteroid (BR) homeostasis and signaling are crucial for normal growth and development of plants. BR signaling through cell-surface receptor kinases and intracellular components leads to dephosphorylation and accumulation of the nuclear protein BZR1. How BR signaling regulates gene expression, however, remains unknown. Here we show that BZR1 is a transcriptional repressor that has a previously unknown DNA binding domain and binds directly to the promoters of feedback-regulated BR biosynthetic genes. Microarray analyses identified additional potential targets of BZR1 and illustrated, together with physiological studies, that BZR1 coordinates BR homeostasis and signaling by playing dual roles in regulating BR biosynthesis and downstream growth responses."
https://openalex.org/W2062612066,"Brassinosteroids (BRs) signal through a plasma membrane-localized receptor kinase to regulate plant growth and development. We showed previously that a novel protein, BES1, accumulates in the nucleus in response to BRs, where it plays a role in BR-regulated gene expression; however, the mechanism by which BES1 regulates gene expression is unknown. In this study, we dissect BES1 subdomains and establish that BES1 is a transcription factor that binds to and activates BR target gene promoters both in vitro and in vivo. BES1 interacts with a basic helix-loop-helix protein, BIM1, to synergistically bind to E box (CANNTG) sequences present in many BR-induced promoters. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutants of BIM1 and its close family members display BR response phenotypes. Thus, BES1 defines a new class of plant-specific transcription factors that cooperate with transcription factors such as BIM1 to regulate BR-induced genes."
https://openalex.org/W2134236497,"The normal function of neural networks depends on a delicate balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Synapse formation is thought to be regulated by bidirectional signaling between pre- and postsynaptic cells. We demonstrate that members of the Neuroligin family promote postsynaptic differentiation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Down-regulation of neuroligin isoform expression by RNA interference results in a loss of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Electrophysiological analysis revealed a predominant reduction of inhibitory synaptic function. Thus, neuroligins control the formation and functional balance of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in hippocampal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2102785858,"The PGC-1 family of coactivators stimulates the activity of certain transcription factors and nuclear receptors. Transcription factors in the sterol responsive element binding protein (SREBP) family are key regulators of the lipogenic genes in the liver. We show here that high-fat feeding, which induces hyperlipidemia and atherogenesis, stimulates the expression of both PGC-1β and SREBP1c and 1a in liver. PGC-1β coactivates the SREBP transcription factor family and stimulates lipogenic gene expression. Further, PGC-1β is required for SREBP-mediated lipogenic gene expression. However, unlike SREBP itself, PGC-1β reduces fat accumulation in the liver while greatly increasing circulating triglycerides and cholesterol in VLDL particles. The stimulation of lipoprotein transport upon PGC-1β expression is likely due to the simultaneous coactivation of the liver X receptor, LXRα, a nuclear hormone receptor with known roles in hepatic lipid transport. These data suggest a mechanism through which dietary saturated fats can stimulate hyperlipidemia and atherogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2087125825,"In the present study, the 26-residue peptide sequence Ac-KWKSFLKTFKSAVKTVLHTALKAISS-amide (V681) was utilized as the framework to study the effects of peptide hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, amphipathicity, and helicity (induced by single amino acid substitutions in the center of the polar and nonpolar faces of the amphipathic helix) on biological activities. The peptide analogs were also studied by temperature profiling in reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, from 5 to 80 °C, to evaluate the self-associating ability of the molecules in solution, another important parameter in understanding peptide antimicrobial and hemolytic activities. A higher ability to self-associate in solution was correlated with weaker antimicrobial activity and stronger hemolytic activity of the peptides. Biological studies showed that strong hemolytic activity of the peptides generally correlated with high hydrophobicity, high amphipathicity, and high helicity. In most cases, the d-amino acid substituted peptides possessed an enhanced average antimicrobial activity compared with l-diastereomers. The therapeutic index of V681 was improved 90- and 23-fold against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. By simply replacing the central hydrophobic or hydrophilic amino acid residue on the nonpolar or the polar face of these amphipathic derivatives of V681 with a series of selected d-/l-amino acids, we demonstrated that this method has excellent potential for the rational design of antimicrobial peptides with enhanced activities.

The extensive clinical use of classical antibiotics has led to the growing emergence of many medically relevant resistant strains of bacteria (1.Neu H.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar, 2.Travis J. Science. 1994; 264: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Moreover, only three new structural classes of antibiotics (the oxazolidinone, linezolid, the strepto-gramins, and the lipopeptide, daptomycin (3.Calza L. Manfredi R. Chiodo F. Expert Opin. Pharmacother. 2004; 5: 1899-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 4.Jacqueline C. Asseray N. Batard E. Mabecque V.L. Kergueris M.F. Dube L. Bugnon D. Potel G. Caillon J. Int. J. Antimicrob.

Agents. 2004; 24: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)) have been introduced into medical practice in the past 40 years. Therefore, the development of a new class of antibiotics has become critical. The cationic antimicrobial peptides could represent such a new class of antibiotics (6.Hancock R.E. Lancet. 1997; 349: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 7.Andreu D. Rivas L. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 415-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 8.Sitaram N. Nagaraj R. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 727-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although the exact mode of action of antimicrobial peptides has not been established, all cationic amphipathic peptides interact with membranes, and it has been proposed that the cytoplasmic membrane is the main target of some peptides, whereby peptide accumulation in the membrane causes increased permeability and loss of barrier function (9.Hancock R.E. Lehrer R. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar, 10.Duclohier H. Molle G. Spach G. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 1017-1021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The development of resistance to membrane active peptides whose sole target is the cytoplasmic membrane is not expected because this would require substantial changes in the lipid composition of cell membranes of microorganisms. Two major classes of the cationic antimicrobial peptides are the α-helical and the β-sheet peptides (6.Hancock R.E. Lancet. 1997; 349: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 7.Andreu D. Rivas L. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 415-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 11.van't Hof W. Veerman E.C. Helmerhorst E.J. Amerongen A.V. Biol.

The β-sheet class consists of cyclic peptides constrained in this conformation either by intramolecular disulfide bonds, e.g. defensins (13.Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 584-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and protegrins (14.Steinberg D.A. Hurst M.A. Fujii C.A. Kung A.H. Ho J.F. Cheng F.C. Loury D.J. Fiddes J.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1738-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or by an N-terminal to C-terminal covalent bond, e.g. gramicidin S (15.Khaled M.A. Urry D.W. Sugano H. Miyoshi M. Izumiya N. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2490-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and tyrocidines (16.Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6843-6850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the β-sheet peptides, α-helical peptides are linear molecules that mainly exist as disordered structures in aqueous media and become amphipathic helices upon interaction with the hydrophobic membranes, e.g. cecropins (17.Christensen B. Fink J. Merrifield R.B. Mauzerall D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5072-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), magainins (18.Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5449-5453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar), and melittins (19.Andreu D. Ubach J. Boman A. Wahlin B. Wade D. Merrifield R.B. Boman H.G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). From numerous structure/activity studies on both natural and synthetic antimicrobial peptides, a number of factors believed to be important for antimicrobial activity have been identified, including the presence of both hydrophobic and basic residues, an amphipathic nature that segregates basic and hydrophobic residues, and an inducible or preformed secondary structure (α-helical or β-sheet). The major barrier to the use of antimicrobial peptides as antibiotics is their toxicity or ability to lyse eukaryotic cells. This is perhaps not a surprising result if the target is indeed the cell membrane (6.Hancock R.E. Lancet. 1997; 349: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 7.Andreu D. Rivas L. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 415-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 8.Sitaram N. Nagaraj R. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 727-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9.Hancock R.E. Lehrer R. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). To be useful as a broad spectrum antibiotic, it would be necessary to dissociate anti-eukaryotic activity from antimicrobial activity, i.e. increasing the antimicrobial activity and reducing toxicity to normal cells. Recent studies on a number of α-helical and β-sheet peptides have attempted to delineate features responsible for these activities and found that high amphipathicity (20.Dathe M. Wieprecht T.

In contrast, antimicrobial activity was found to be less dependent on these factors, compared with hemolytic activity (20.Dathe M. Wieprecht T. Nikolenko H. Handel L. Maloy W.L. MacDonald D.L.

Res. 2004; 63: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, specificity (or therapeutic index, which is defined as the ratio of MHC 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, minimal hemolytic concentration; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; TFE, trifluoroethanol; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine.1The abbreviations used are: MHC, minimal hemolytic concentration; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; TFE, trifluoroethanol; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine. (hemolytic activity) and MIC (antimicrobial activity), MHC/MIC for bacteria over erythrocytes) could be increased in one of the following three ways: increasing antimicrobial activity, decreasing hemolytic activity while maintaining antimicrobial activity, or a combination of both increasing antimicrobial activity and decreasing hemolytic activity. We believe that a synthetic peptide approach to examining the effect of small incremental changes in hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, amphipathicity, and helicity of cationic antimicrobial peptides will enable rapid progress in the rational design of peptide antibiotics. Our previous studies (22.Lee D.L. Hodges R.S. Biopolymers. 2003; 71: 28-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 23.Kondejewski L.H. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Farmer S.W. Lix B. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D.

Hodges R.S. J. Pept. Res. 2004; 63: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have successfully utilized such an approach to dissociate antimicrobial and hemolytic activities of de novo designed cyclic β-sheet gramicidin S analogs, by systematic alterations in amphipathicity/hydrophobicity through d-amino acid substitutions. In recent work, we demonstrated that the helix-destabilizing properties of d-amino acids offer a systematic approach to the controlled alteration of the hydrophobicity, amphipathicity, and helicity of amphipathic α-helical model peptides (29.Chen Y. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Pept. Res. 2002; 59: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). By single substitutions of different d-amino acids into the center of the hydrophobic face of an amphipathic α-helical model peptide, we demonstrated that different d-amino acids disrupted α-helical structure to different degrees, whereas the destabilized structure could still be induced to fold into an α-helix in hydrophobic medium. The advantage of this method of single d- or l-amino acid substitutions at a specific site is that it enables a greater understanding of the mechanism of action of these peptides. In this study, we have utilized the structural framework of an amphipathic α-helical antimicrobial peptide V681 (30.Zhang L. Benz R. Hancock R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8102-8111Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 31.Zhang L. Falla T. Wu M. Fidai S. Burian J. Kay W. Hancock R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) to systematically change peptide amphipathicity, hydrophobicity, and helicity by single d- or l-amino acid substitutions in the center of either the polar or nonpolar faces of the amphipathic helix. Peptide V681, with excellent antimicrobial activity and strong hemolytic activity (30.Zhang L. Benz R. Hancock R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8102-8111Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 31.Zhang L. Falla T. Wu M. Fidai S. Burian J. Kay W. Hancock R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), was selected as an ideal candidate for our study. By introducing different d- or l-amino acid substitutions, we report here that hydrophobicity/amphipathicity and helicity have dramatic effects on the biophysical and biological activities, and by utilizing this method, a significant improvement in antimicrobial activity and specificity can be achieved. In addition, it is plausible that high peptide hydrophobicity and amphipathicity also result in greater peptide self-association in solution. Because we have developed a novel method to measure self-association of small amphipathic molecules, namely temperature profiling in reversed-phase chromatography (32.Mant C.T. Chen Y. Hodges R.S. J. Chromatogr. A. 2003; 1009: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 33.Lee D.L. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22918-22927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we have applied this technique for the first time to investigate the influence of peptide dimerization ability on biological activities of α-helical antimicrobial peptides. Thus, our objectives in this study were 3-fold. First was to demonstrate the importance of the peptide self-association parameter in the de novo design of amphipathic α-helical antimicrobial peptides. Second was to test the hypothesis that disruption of α-helical structure in benign conditions by d-amino acid substitutions or substitutions of hydrophilic/charged l-amino acids on the nonpolar face can dramatically alter specificity in a similar manner to our previous work on cyclic β-sheet antimicrobial peptides (23.Kondejewski L.H. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Farmer S.W. Lix B. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Hancock R.E. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13181-13192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 28.Lee D.L. Powers J.P. Pflegerl K. Vasil M.L. Hancock R.E. Hodges R.S. J. Pept. Res. 2004; 63: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Third was to observe whether these substitutions will enhance antimicrobial activity, decrease toxicity, and improve antimicrobial specificity while maintaining broad spectrum activity for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Syntheses of the peptides Ac-KWKSFLKTFKXD/LAVKTVLHTALKAISS-amide and Ac-KWKSFLKTFKSAXD/LKTVLHTALKAISS-amide, with substitution sites at positions 11 and 13, respectively, were carried out by solid phase peptide synthesis using t-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry and 4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin (0.97 mmol/g), as described previously (29.Chen Y. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Pept. Res. 2002; 59: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The crude peptides were purified by preparative RP-HPLC using a Zorbax 300 SB-C8 column (250 × 9.4-mm inner diameter; 6.5-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size; Agilent Technologies) with a linear AB gradient (0.2% acetonitrile/min) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, where mobile phase A was 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid in water, and B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. The purity of peptides was verified by analytical RP-HPLC as described below. The peptides were further characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. Analytical RP-HPLC of Peptides—Peptides were analyzed on an Agilent 1100 series liquid chromatograph (Little Falls, DE). Runs were performed on a Zorbax 300 SB-C8 column (150 × 2.1-mm inner diameter; 5-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size) from Agilent Technologies using a linear AB gradient (1% acetonitrile/min) and a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min, where solvent A was 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, pH 2, and solvent B was 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. Temperature profiling analyses were performed in 3 °C increments, from 5 to 80 °C. Characterization of Helical Structure—The mean residue molar ellipticities of peptides were determined by CD spectroscopy, using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD), at 25 °C under benign (nondenaturing) conditions (50 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, 100 mm KCl, pH 7), hereafter referred to as KP buffer, as well as in the presence of an α-helix inducing solvent, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) (50 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, 100 mm KCl, pH 7 buffer, 50% TFE). A 10-fold dilution of an ∼500 μm stock solution of the peptide analogs was loaded into a 0.02-cm fused silica cell and its ellipticity scanned from 190 to 250 nm. The values of molar ellipticities of the peptide analogs at a wavelength of 222 nm were used to estimate the relative α-helicity of the peptides. CD Temperature Denaturation Study of Peptide V681—The native peptide V681 was dissolved in 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid containing 50% TFE, pH 2, loaded into a 0.02-cm fused silica cell, and peptide ellipticity scanned from 190 to 250 nm at temperatures of 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, and 80 °C. The spectra at different temperatures were used to mimic the alteration of peptide conformation during temperature profiling analysis in RP-HPLC. The ratio of the molar ellipticity (222 nm) at a particular temperature (t) relative to that at 5 °C ([θ]t – [θ]u)/([θ]5 – [θ]u) was calculated and plotted against temperature in order to obtain the thermal melting profiles, where [θ]5 and [θ]u represent the molar ellipticity values for the fully folded and fully unfolded species, respectively. [θ] u was determined in the presence of 8 m urea with a value of 1500 degree·cm2·dmol–1 to represent a totally random coil state (34.Monera O.D. Sereda T.J. Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Pept. Sci. 1995; 1: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The melting temperature (Tm) was calculated as the temperature at which the α-helix was 50% denatured (([θ]t – [θ]u)/([θ]5 – [θ]u) = 0.5), and the values were taken as a measure of α-helix stability. Determination of Peptide Amphipathicity—Amphipathicity of peptide analogs was determined by the calculation of hydrophobic moment (35.Eisenberg D. Weiss R.M. Terwilliger T.C. Nature. 1982; 299: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) using the software package Jemboss version 1.2.1 (36.Carver T. Bleasby A. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1837-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), modified to include a hydrophobicity scale determined in our laboratory. The hydrophobicity scale used in this study is listed as follows: Trp, 33.1; Phe, 30.1; Leu, 24.7; Ile, 22.8; Met, 17.3; Tyr, 16.0; Val, 15.1; Pro, 10.4; Cys, 9.2; His, 4.7; Ala, 4.1; Arg, 4.1; Thr, 4.1; Gln, 1.7; Ser, 1.3; Asn, 1.0; Gly, 0.0; Glu, –0.3; Asp, –0.8; and Lys, –2.0. 2J. Kovacs, C. T. Mant, and R. S. Hodges, unpublished data. These hydrophobicity coefficients were determined from reversed-phase chromatography at pH 7 (10 mm Na2HPO4 buffer containing 50 mm NaCl) of a model random coil peptide with single substitution of all 20 naturally occurring amino acids. We propose that this HPLC-derived scale reflects the relative differences in hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the 20 amino acid side chains more accurately than previously determined scales. Measurement of Antibacterial Activity—Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using a standard microtiter dilution method in a modified Luria-Bertani medium with no added salt (LB, composed exclusively 10 g of tryptone and 5 g of yeast extract/liter). Briefly, cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB and diluted in the same medium. Serial dilutions of the peptides were added to the microtiter plates in a volume of 100 μl followed by 10 μl of bacteria to give a final inoculum of 5 × 105 colony-forming units/ml. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, and MICs were determined as the lowest peptide concentration that inhibited growth. Measurement of Hemolytic Activity (MHC)—Peptide samples were added to 1% human erythrocytes in phosphate-buffered saline (0.08 m NaCl, 0.043 m Na2HPO4, 0.011 m KH2PO4), and reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h in microtiter plates. Peptide samples were diluted 2-fold in order to determine the concentration that produced no hemolysis. This determination was made by withdrawing aliquots from the hemolysis assays, removing unlysed erythrocytes by centrifugation (800 × g), and determining which concentration of peptide failed to cause the release of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin release was determined spectrophotometrically at 562 nm. The hemolytic titer was the highest 2-fold dilution of the peptide that still caused release of hemoglobin from erythrocytes. The control for no release of hemoglobin was a sample of 1% erythrocytes without any peptide added. Because erythrocytes were in an isotonic buffer, no detectable release (<1% of that released upon complete hemolysis) of hemoglobin was observed from this control during the course of the assay. Calculation of Therapeutic Index (MHC/MIC Ratio)—It should be noted that both the MHC and MIC values are carried out by serial 2-fold dilutions; thus, for individual bacteria and individual peptides, the therapeutic index (MHC/MIC) could vary as much as 4-fold if the peptide is very active in both hemolytic and antimicrobial activities. However, if there is no detectable hemolytic activity, then the maximum possible error in the therapeutic index would be only 2-fold from variations in the antimicrobial activity. When there was no detectable hemolytic activity at 250 μg/ml, a minimal hemolytic concentration of 500 μg/ml was used to calculate the therapeutic index. Peptide Design—Peptide V681, a 26-residue amphipathic antimicrobial peptide with a polar and nonpolar face (30.Zhang L. Benz R. Hancock R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8102-8111Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), was selected as the parent peptide in this study (Fig. 1). Its polar face consisted of 14 residues: six lysine residues, one histidine, four serines, and three threonines. In contrast, the nonpolar face consisted of 12 residues: three alanines, two valines, three leucines, two phenylalanines, one isoleucine, and one tryptophan residue. In this study, we chose d-/l-amino acid substitution sites at the center of the hydrophobic face (position 13) and at the center of the hydrophilic face (position 11) of the helix, such that these substitution sites were also located in the center of the overall peptide sequence. This was based on our previous model peptide studies (29.Chen Y. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Pept. Res. 2002; 59: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34.Monera O.D. Sereda T.J. Zhou N.E.

Lett. 1994; 1: 114-119Google Scholar) that demonstrated that these central location substitutions had the greatest effect on peptide secondary structure. To study the effects of varying hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity on peptide biological activities, in the design of V681 analogs, five l-amino acids (Leu, Val, Ala, Ser, and Lys) and Gly were selected out of the 20 natural amino acids as the substituting residues, representing a wide range of hydrophobicity. The hydrophobicity of these six amino acid residues decreased in the order Leu > Val > Ala > Gly > Ser > Lys (29.Chen Y. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Pept. Res. 2002; 59: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Based on the relative hydrophobicity of amino acid side chains (29.Chen Y. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Pept. Res. 2002; 59: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), leucine was used to replace the native valine on the nonpolar face to increase peptide hydrophobicity and amphipathicity. Alanine was selected to reduce peptide hydrophobicity/amphipathicity while maintaining high helicity. A hydrophilic amino acid, serine, was selected to decrease the hydrophobicity/amphipathicity of V681 in the nonpolar face. Positively charged lysine was used to decrease further peptide hydrophobicity and amphipathicity. In contrast, the same amino acid substitutions on the polar face would have different effects on the alteration of hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity and amphipathicity, because the native amino acid residue is serine on the polar face of V681. As a result, on the polar face leucine, valine, and alanine were used to increase peptide hydrophobicity as well as to decrease the amphipathicity of V681, whereas lysine was selected to increase peptide hydrophilicity and amphipathicity. In previous studies, Kondejewski and co-workers (23.Kondejewski L.H. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Farmer S.W. Lix B. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Hancock R.E. Hodges R.S. J. Biol.

Res. 2004; 63: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) successfully utilized d-amino acid substitutions to dissociate the antimicrobial activity and hemolytic activity of the cyclic β-sheet gramicidin S analogs. In the present study, d-enantiomers of the five l-amino acid residues were also incorporated at the same positions on the nonpolar/polar face of V681 to change not only peptide hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity and amphipathicity but, more importantly, to disrupt peptide helical structure. Because glycine does not exhibit optical activity and has no side chain, the Gly-substituted analog was used as a reference for diastereomeric peptide pairs. Because all peptide analogs were made based on a single amino acid substitution in either the polar or nonpolar faces of V681, peptides were divided into two categories, V13X peptides (nonpolar face substitutions) and S11X peptides (polar face substitutions). Each peptide was named after the substituting amino acid residue, e.g. the peptide analog with l-leucine substitution on the nonpolar face of V681 is called V13LL. It is important to note that because the l-valine of the nonpolar face and l-serine of the polar face are the original amino acid residues in the V681 sequence (Fig. 1), peptide analogs V13VL and S11SL are the same peptide as V681. A control peptide (peptide C) designed to exhibit negligible secondary structure, i.e. a random coil, was employed as a standard peptide for temperature profiling during RP-HPLC to monitor peptide dimerization.

https://openalex.org/W2087140031,"In brain ischemia, gating of postsynaptic glutamate receptors and other membrane channels triggers intracellular Ca2+ overload and cell death. In excitotoxic settings, the initial Ca2+ influx through glutamate receptors is followed by a second uncontrolled Ca2+ increase that leads to neuronal demise. Here we report that the major plasma membrane Ca2+ extruding system, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), is cleaved during brain ischemia and in neurons undergoing excitotoxicity. Inhibition of Ca2+-activated proteases (calpains) by overexpressing their endogenous inhibitor protein, calpastatin or the expression of an NCX isoform not cleaved by calpains, prevented Ca2+ overload and rescued neurons from excitotoxic death. Conversely, down-regulation of NCX by siRNA compromised neuronal Ca2+ handling, transforming the Ca2+ transient elicited by non-excitotoxic glutamate concentrations into a lethal Ca2+overload. Thus, proteolytic inactivation of NCX-driven neuronal Ca2+ extrusion is responsible for the delayed excitotoxic Ca2+ deregulation and neuronal death."
https://openalex.org/W1976407358,"Mammalian Staufen (Stau)1 is an RNA binding protein that is thought to function in mRNA transport and translational control. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) degrades abnormal and natural mRNAs that terminate translation sufficiently upstream of a splicing-generated exon-exon junction. Here we describe an mRNA decay mechanism that involves Stau1, the NMD factor Upf1, and a termination codon. Unlike NMD, this mechanism does not involve pre-mRNA splicing and occurs when Upf2 or Upf3X is downregulated. Stau1 binds directly to Upf1 and elicits mRNA decay when tethered downstream of a termination codon. Stau1 also interacts with the 3'-untranslated region of ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf)1 mRNA. Accordingly, downregulating either Stau1 or Upf1 increases Arf1 mRNA stability. These findings suggest that Arf1 mRNA is a natural target for Stau1-mediated decay, and data indicate that other mRNAs are also natural targets. We discuss this pathway as a means for cells to downregulate the expression of Stau1 binding transcripts."

A precise input of energy to the gas is followed by single-parameter thermometry, which determines the empirical temperature parameter $\tilde{T}$ of the gas cloud. Our measurements reveal a clear transition in the heat capacity. The energy and the spatial profile of the gas are computed using a theory of the crossover from Fermi to Bose superfluids at finite temperature. The theory calibrates $\tilde{T}$, yields excellent agreement with the data, and predicts the onset of superfluidity at the observed transition point."
https://openalex.org/W2091007136,"RNA chain elongation is a highly processive and accurate process that is finely regulated by numerous intrinsic and extrinsic signals. Here we describe a general mechanism that governs RNA polymerase (RNAP) movement and response to regulatory inputs such as pauses, terminators, and elongation factors. We show that E.coli RNAP moves by a complex Brownian ratchet mechanism, which acts prior to phosphodiester bond formation. The incoming substrate and the flexible F bridge domain of the catalytic center serve as two separate ratchet devices that function in concert to drive forward translocation. The adjacent G loop domain controls F bridge motion, thus keeping the proper balance between productive and inactive states of the elongation complex. This balance is critical for cell viability since it determines the rate, processivity, and fidelity of transcription."

Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar, 2Khanna K.K. Jackson S.P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) are the two major pathways for DSB repair (3Jackson S.P. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). HR requires the presence of a sister chromatid and is operational in the late S and G2 phases of the cell cycle because of the availability of an optimally positioned sister chromatid (4Haber J.E. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 259-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). NHEJ, on other hand, does not depend on the presence of homologous DNA sequences and is the predominant pathway for DSB repair in mammalian cells (5Critchlow S.E. Jackson S.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 394-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). It was proposed that NHEJ is preferentially used in G1 and early S phases of the cell cycle (6Hendrickson E.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 795-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 7Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). However, a recent report indicating that NHEJ-deficient cell lines are radiation-sensitive in all phases of the cell cycle suggests that NHEJ is important throughout the cell cycle (8Rothkamm K. Kruger I. Thompson L.H. Lobrich M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5706-5715Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Clearly, the exact contribution of NHEJ in different phases of the cell cycle needs to be defined further. The NHEJ pathway of DSB repair requires both the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex and the XRCC4/DNA ligase IV complex, as well as possible additional accessory factors (5Critchlow S.E. Jackson S.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 394-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 9Valerie K. Povirk L.F.

DNA-PK, the key component of the NHEJ pathway, is composed of the Ku70/80 heterodimer and the catalytic subunit DNA-PKcs (11Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Ku binds to DNA ends with very high affinity and is believed to function as the DNA-binding and regulatory subunit that recruits DNA-PKcs to breaks and stimulates its kinase activity (12Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 13Dynan W.S. Yoo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1551-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). DNA-PKcs is a member of the phosphatidylinositol-3-like kinase family that includes ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) and ATM-Rad3-related (14Durocher D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 15Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar). Although the biochemical properties of DNA-PK have been extensively studied in vitro, it is still not clear how it functions in vivo in the context of NHEJ. Wild type DNA-PKcs, but not a kinase-dead mutant, is able to rescue the radiation sensitivity and DSB repair defect of DNA-PKcs-defective V3 cells demonstrating that the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs is essential for the NHEJ pathway (16Kurimasa A. Kumano S. Boubnov N.V. Story M.D. Tung C.S. Peterson S.R. Chen D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3877-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) underlying NHEJ, it is critical to identify the in vivo substrates of DNA-PK and to understand exactly how its kinase activity is regulated. As a first step in this direction, we have previously reported that ionizing radiation (IR) induces DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at threonine 2609 and demonstrated that Thr-2609 phosphorylation is required for DSB repair (17Chan D.W. Chen B.P. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In addition to Thr-2609, several putative phosphorylation sites have been identified (18Douglas P. Sapkota G.P. Morrice N. Yu Y. Goodarzi A.A. Merkle D. Meek K. Alessi D.R. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 19Soubeyrand S. Pope L. Pakuts B. Hache R.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1198-1201PubMed Google Scholar) from analyses of purified DNA-PKcs autophosphorylated in vitro; however, none of these sites has been demonstrated to be phosphorylated in vivo in response to DSBs. Here we report the IR-induced autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at a novel site, serine 2056, a phosphorylation event that is required for NHEJ-mediated DSB repair. In addition, we also present evidence showing that the phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent and DNA replication-associated manner. We demonstrate that the NHEJ pathway is preferentially engaged to repair IR-induced breaks in the G1 phase of the cycle. Interestingly, although IR-induced breaks in the S phase do not elicit a DNA-PKcs phosphorylation response, replication-associated DSBs in the S phase appear to preferentially activate DNA-PK.

Treatment with DNA-damaging agents was carried out at the indicated concentrations for 2 h: bleomycin (50 μg/ml), etoposide (30 μg/ml), methyl methanesulfonate (50 μg/ml), and hydroxyurea (1 mm). UV irradiation was carried out at the rate of 0.15 J/m2/sec to achieve a cumulative dose of 10 J/m2 followed by a 2-h recovery period. DNA replication-associated DSBs were induced by camptothecin (1 μm) for 1 h, aphidicolin (2 μg/ml) for 1 h, or aphidicolin pretreatment for 30 min followed by camptothecin for 1 h. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Generation of V3 Stable Cell Lines— Site-directed mutagenesis of the S2056A mutation was performed as described previously (17Chan D.W. Chen B.P. Prithivirajsingh S.

V3 cell lines stably expressing S2056A or S2056A/T2609A mutant DNA-PKcs were generated by co-transfection of the S2056A or S2056A/T2609A mutant DNA-PKcs expression plasmids together with the pSV2neo plasmid into the V3 cells. 48 h after transfection, cells were replaced with selection medium containing 400 μg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen).

In brief, the wild type CHO AA8, DNA-PKcs defective CHO V3, or V3 derivative cell lines were transfected with the linearized pDVG9 plasmid DNA. Plasmid DNA was recovered 48 h after transfection and was PCR-amplified across the joining region. Equal amounts of PCR products were digested with BstXI to determine NHEJ-directed (uncut) and microhomology-directed (cut) end joining.

Cells synchronized in G1 were treated with aphidicolin overnight followed by 4 h of release to synchronize the cell cycle in the mid-S phase. V3 and AA8 cells were synchronized in G1 by isoleucine deprivation followed by release in complete medium (24Nagasawa H. Little J.B. Inkret W.C. Carpenter S. Raju M.R. Chen D.J. Strniste G.F. Radiat.

A modified dual camera adaptor with a short pass dichroic mirror substituted for its 50–50% image splitter was mounted on the microscope side port to passively combine green laser light with longer wavelength emissions from the microscope halogen light source used for phase contrast imaging. Laser light entered the straight-through port of the camera adaptor and passed through the dichroic mirror, whereas phase contrast light, having first passed through the specimen, was reflected upward by the dichroic mirror toward the charge-coupled device camera mounted on the right angle camera port of the camera adaptor. Laser light was focused parfocal to the image plane of a 60× oil immersion objective (Phase III, NA 1.4). A mechanical shutter in the laser light path was shuttered at 3–4 Hz with an open time of 3 ms allowing ∼226,000 laser pulses/shutter opening. Live cells were imaged at video rate in phase contrast and scanned, using a motorized stage controlled with a joystick to position the nuclei of the cells at the focal point of the laser. DNA-PKcs purified from IR-treated HeLa cells was separated on SDS-PAGE and digested with Asp-N. The extracted peptides before and after calf intestinal phosphatase treatment were analyzed with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (28Zhang X. Herring C.J. Romano P.R. Szczepanowska J. Brzeska H. Hinnebusch A.G. Qin J. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2050-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A putative phosphopeptide encompassing amino acids 2044–2072 was identified. The phosphopeptide was too large to be sequenced by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry to find the precise phosphorylation site. To identify the site, we generated a phospho-specific antibody (anti-pS2056, Fig. 1B) and confirmed that Ser-2056 is indeed phosphorylated in vivo in response to IR. Similar to Thr-2609, Ser-2056 is also conserved in all known DNA-PKcs homologues (Fig. 1A) suggesting that phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at Ser-2056 upon IR may be an evolutionarily conserved response. Ser-2056 phosphorylation could be detected as early as 10 min post-irradiation in HeLa cells after 10 Gy of irradiation. At this dose, the phosphorylation of Ser-2056 reaches a maximum at 30 min and remains detectable even at 8 h after irradiation (Fig. 1C). Phosphorylation at Ser-2056 increases in a dosage-dependent manner; phosphorylation is detectable after 2 Gy of irradiation, and the level of phosphorylation continues to increase with the dose (up to 50 Gy) without reaching saturation (Fig. 1C). In addition to IR, other DSB-inducing agents such as bleomycin and etoposide can also induce Ser-2056 phosphorylation, whereas hydroxyurea, methyl methanesulfonate, and UV irradiation induce minimal phosphorylation at Ser-2056 (Fig. 1D) suggesting that Ser-2056 phosphorylation is specifically in response to DSBs. The anti-pS2056 antibody is also able to recognize Ser-2056 phosphorylation from fluorescent immunostaining. It stains DNA-PKcs-proficient human glioma M059K cells after IR but not un-irradiated M059K or irradiated M059J cells (DNA-PKcs-defective) (Fig. 2A). Fluorescent immunostaining also revealed that DNA-PKcs phosphorylated at Ser-2056 (pS2056) is present at discrete nuclear foci that co-localize with γH2AX foci (Fig. 2B), presumably at the DNA damage sites (29Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). Using laser micro-irradiation, we further demonstrated that Ser-2056 phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs localizes directly at the DNA damage sites (Fig. 2C). IR-induced Ser-2056 phosphorylation is abolished by low doses of wortmannin (Fig. 3A) that inhibit DNA-PKcs and ATM but not the related ATM-Rad3-related kinase (30Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether DNA-PKcs itself or ATM is responsible for Ser-2056 phosphorylation, we examined IR-induced Ser-2056 phosphorylation in V3-WT (wild type) and V3-KD (kinase-dead) cell lines (16Kurimasa A. Kumano S. Boubnov N.V. Story M.D. Tung C.S. Peterson S.R. Chen D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3877-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In these cell lines, wild type (V3-WT) or kinase-dead mutant DNA-PKcs (V3-KD) were stably expressed in a CHO V3 cell line that is defective in both DSB repair and DNA-PKcs expression (21Peterson S.R. Kurimasa A. Oshimura M. Dynan W.S. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3171-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In response to IR, Ser-2056 phosphorylation is markedly reduced in V3-KD cells as compared with that of V3-WT cells, whereas the DNA-PKcs protein levels in both cell lines are comparable (Fig. 3B). Moreover, Ser-2056 phosphorylation is unaffected in a panel of cell lines deficient in ATM (data not shown). Thus, IR-induced modification of Ser-2056 is clearly an autophosphorylation event of DNA-PKcs. Phosphorylation at Ser-2056 is not affected if DNA-PKcs is mutated at the Thr-2609 phosphorylation site (17Chan D.W. Chen B.P. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) indicating that phosphorylation at Thr-2609 does not influence Ser-2056 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Phosphorylation at Ser-2056 is also not required for further stimulation of DNA-PKcs kinase activity because alanine substitution at Ser-2056 (S2056A) does not affect the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs (Fig. 3C). In addition, S2056A mutant DNA-PKcs is able to phosphorylate kinase-dead mutant DNA-PKcs at Ser-2056 in vitro suggesting that autophosphorylation at Ser-2056 could occur in trans at least in vitro (Fig. 3D). To investigate the biological significance of DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at Ser-2056, we examined the radiation sensitivities and DSB-rejoining capabilities of V3 cell lines stably expressing either wild type DNA-PKcs (V3-WT) or S2056A mutant DNA-PKcs (V3-S2056A). As shown in Fig. 4B, V3 cells complemented with S2056A or S2056A/T2609A mutant DNA-PKcs were significantly radiosensitive as compared with V3 cells complemented with wild type DNA-PKcs suggesting that phosphorylation at Ser-2056 is required for resistance to ionizing radiation. To analyze the role of Ser-2056 phosphorylation in DSB rejoining, we utilized a previously established plasmid-based end-joining assay for NHEJ (22Verkaik N.S. Esveldt-van Lange R.E. van Heemst D. Bruggenwirth H.T. Hoeijmakers J.H. Zdzienicka M.Z. van Gent D.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) that measures direct end joining versus alternative microhomology-directed end-joining activity. In cells defective in NHEJ, a dramatic increase in microhomology-directed end joining has been observed. We also observed elevated microhomology-directed end-joining in V3 cells, whereas the parental AA8 CHO cells and V3-WT cells displayed only minimal levels of microhomology-directed end-joining thereby establishing the validity of this assay (Fig. 4C). In contrast to V3-WT, V3 cells complemented with S2056A, T2609A, and S2056A/T2609A mutants showed a dramatic increase in microhomology-directed end-joining suggesting that these cells are significantly defective in NHEJ. Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence indicating that the phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at Ser-2056 is critical for the repair of DSBs by the NHEJ pathway. It has been proposed that NHEJ and HR may be differentially regulated throughout the cell cycle with NHEJ playing a major role in the G1/early S phases and HR playing a major role in the late S/G2 phases when a sister chromatid is available (6Hendrickson E.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 795-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 7Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Indeed, DNA-PKcs-deficient V3 cells are less sensitive to IR in the S phase of the cell cycle as compared with the G1 phase indicating that HR may partly compensate for NHEJ deficiency in S phase cells (Fig. 5A). To directly monitor the phosphorylation of DNA-PK in different phases of the cell cycle, normal HSF synchronized in the G1 or S phases were irradiated, and DNA-PKcs phosphorylation was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5B, the protein level of DNA-PKcs remains constant throughout the cell cycle, whereas IR-induced Ser-2056 phosphorylation decreases from the G1 phase to the S phase. The decrease of IR-induced DNA-PKcs phosphorylation in the S phase was also evident by fluorescent immunostaining with anti-pS2056 antibody (Fig. 5C) and with anti-pT2609 antibody (Fig. 5D) suggesting an overall reduction of IR-induced DNA-PKcs phosphorylation in the S phase of the cell cycle. Note that the G1 cells stain poorly for Brca1, whereas the S phase cells stain strongly for Brca1 thereby confirming their cell cycle distribution (31Vaughn J.P. Davis P.L. Jarboe M.D. Huper G. Evans A.C. Wiseman R.W. Berchuck A. Iglehart J.D. Futreal P.A. Marks J.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 711-715PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that phosphorylation of DNA-PK in response to IR is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. In HSF cells synchronized in the G1 phase, more than 90% of the HSF cells were positive for pS2056 foci upon IR. In contrast, less than 15% of the HSF cells synchronized in the S phase were positive for pS2056 foci (Fig. 5E). Although phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs in response to IR is attenuated in the S phase, V3 cells are reported to be sensitive to agents (camptothecin and hydroxyurea) that disrupt the progression of the replication fork and induce replication-associated DSBs (32Arnaudeau C. Lundin C. Helleday T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1235-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 33Lundin C. Erixon K. Arnaudeau C. Schultz N. Jenssen D. Meuth M. Helleday T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5869-5878Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This suggests that although DNA-PKcs is less responsive to IR in the S phase, it may still play an important role in the resolution of DNA replication-associated DSBs in this phase of the cell cycle. We, therefore, examined DNA-PKcs phosphorylation in response to camptothecin, which inhibits topoisomerase I and induces replication-associated DSBs (34Liu L.F. Desai S.D. Li T.K. Mao Y. Sun M. Sim S.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 922: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Camptothecin treatment of HSF cells indeed induced DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at Ser-2056 (Fig. 6A). It was reported that DNA polymerase activity is required to convert camptothecin-induced lesions into DSBs and that pretreatment of cells with aphidicolin (DNA polymerase α and δ inhibitor) blocks the induction of DSBs by camptothecin (35Furuta T. Takemura H. Liao Z.Y. Aune G.J. Redon C. Sedelnikova O.A. Pilch D.R. Rogakou E.P. Celeste A. Chen H.T. Nussenzweig A. Aladjem M.I. Bonner W.M. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20303-20312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Camptothecin-induced Ser-2056 phosphorylation was significantly attenuated in the presence of aphidicolin (Fig. 6A) indicating that the observed phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs in response to camptothecin is associated with replication fork progression. In addition to the increase in Ser-2056 phosphorylation, fluorescent immunostaining revealed that camptothecin also induces pS2056 (Fig. 6B) and pT2609 (Fig. 6C) foci only in HSF cells synchronized in the S phase but not in the G1 phase. To confirm that camptothecin-induced phospho-DNA-PKcs is associated with the sites of DNA replication, HSF cells were pulse-labeled with BrdUrd for 10 min followed by camptothecin treatment for 30 min. Fluorescent immunostaining demonstrated that camptothecin-induced pS2056, pT2609, and γH2AX foci co-localize with the sites of BrdUrd incorporation and that camptothecin-induced p Ser-2056 foci also co-localize with the p34 subunit of replication protein A RPA2 (Fig. 6D) (36Vassin V.M. Wold M.S. Borowiec J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1930-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The observed co-localizations strongly suggest that DSBs generated at the sites of replication forks selectively activate DNA-PK. Thus, although IR-induced DSBs do not induce significant DNA-PKcs phosphorylation in the S phase, the DNA replication-associated DSBs selectively activate DNA-PKcs. The kinase activity of DNA-PKcs is clearly essential for NHEJ-mediated DSB repair (16Kurimasa A. Kumano S. Boubnov N.V. Story M.D. Tung C.S. Peterson S.R. Chen D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3877-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) underlying NHEJ, it is critical to identify the in vivo substrates of DNA-PK and to understand exactly how its kinase activity is regulated. Although DNA-PKcs promiscuously phosphorylates a plethora of substrates in vitro including itself, bona fide targets of DNA-PK have largely eluded identification (15Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar). Recently, the locations of seven putative phosphorylation sites on DNA-PKcs were reported based upon analyses of DNA-PKcs autophosphorylated in vitro (17Chan D.W. Chen B.P. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 18Douglas P. Sapkota G.P. Morrice N. Yu Y. Goodarzi A.A. Merkle D. Meek K. Alessi D.R. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 19Soubeyrand S. Pope L. Pakuts B. Hache R.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1198-1201PubMed Google Scholar). Among the seven identified sites, only Thr-2609 has been conclusively demonstrated to be phosphorylated in vivo in response to IR (17Chan D.W. Chen B.P. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). To directly identify sites that are important in the cellular response to IR, we analyzed DNA-PKcs from irradiated HeLa cells and successfully identified an in vivo autophosphorylation site, Ser-2056. The significance of Ser-2056 phosphorylation in DSB repair is demonstrated by its localization at the sites of DSBs and by the fact that serine to alanine mutation at this site compromises both radiation resistance and NHEJ. IR-induced Ser-2056 phosphorylation is clearly because of DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation in vivo, as this is markedly reduced in V3 cells complemented with kinase-dead mutant DNA-PKcs (Fig. 3A). In addition, we were able to detect Ser-2056 phosphorylation when S2056A mutant DNA-PKcs and kinase-dead mutant DNA-PKcs were mixed together in an in vitro kinase reaction (Fig. 3D) clearly indicating that the autophosphorylation at Ser-2056 occurs in “trans” at least in vitro. It has been postulated based upon in vitro results that a single DSB may be synapsed by two DNA-PKcs molecules (37DeFazio L.G. Stansel R.M. Griffith J.D. Chu G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3192-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 38Weterings E. Verkaik N.S. Bruggenwirth H.T. Hoeijmakers J.H. van Gent D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 7238-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The presence of two active DNA-PKcs molecules in close approximation at a break might make trans autophosphorylation possible with one DNA-PKcs molecule at a break phosphorylating its partner and vice versa (37DeFazio L.G. Stansel R.M. Griffith J.D. Chu G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3192-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 38Weterings E. Verkaik N.S. Bruggenwirth H.T. Hoeijmakers J.H. van Gent D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 7238-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that trans or intermolecular autophosphorylation certainly occurs in vitro though we cannot entirely rule out the possibility of “cis” or intramolecular autophosphorylation also occurring in vivo. Although Ser-2056 and Thr-2609 are both phosphorylated in response to IR and are both required for DNA-PKcs-mediated NHEJ, Ser-2056 and Thr-2609 phosphorylations may be distinctly regulated. First, the physical location of Ser-2056 is far removed from Thr-2609, which is part of a cluster of six putative SQ phosphorylation sites (17Chan D.W. Chen B.P. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 18Douglas P. Sapkota G.P. Morrice N. Yu Y. Goodarzi A.A. Merkle D. Meek K. Alessi D.R. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 19Soubeyrand S. Pope L. Pakuts B. Hache R.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1198-1201PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the level of Ser-2056 phosphorylation increases with IR dose increases up to 50 Gy without reaching saturation, whereas IR-induced Thr-2609 phosphorylation saturates at 10 Gy (17Chan D.W. Chen B.P. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Third, IR-induced Ser-2056 phosphorylation is unaffected in a panel of paired ATM-deficient and -proficient cell lines2, whereas IR-induced Thr-2609 phosphorylation is reduced in ATM-deficient cells (Chan et al. (17Chan D.W. Chen B.P. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar)). 2B. P. C. Chen and D. J. Chen, unpublished results. We speculate, therefore, that although Ser-2056 phosphorylation is purely an autophosphorylation event, both DNA-PK and ATM might contribute to Thr-2609 phosphorylation. It is not yet clear whether the difference between Ser-2056 and Thr-2609 phosphorylations reflects their different roles in the DNA-PKcs-mediated NHEJ pathway, but it certainly merits further investigation. Another important finding from this study is that DNA-PKcs phosphorylation and focus formation in response to IR, although quite robust in G1 phase cells, is significantly attenuated in S phase cells without an apparent decrease in protein levels. This lends credence to the notion that DNA-PK functions primarily in the G1 phase, whereas HR takes over during S/G2 (6Hendrickson E.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 795-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 7Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). The mechanistic basis for the preferential use of NHEJ versus HR in different phases of the cell cycle is not yet clear. It is also not clear whether this is because of a simple competition between these two pathways or whether this involves active regulatory mechanisms. DNA-PKcs appears to have the ability to suppress the DSB-induced and spontaneous HR (39Allen C. Kurimasa A. Brenneman M.A. Chen D.J. Nickoloff J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3758-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It is possible that the decreased DNA-PKcs phosphorylation or activation might account for the increased HR activity in the late S and G2 phases and that regulatory mechanisms might serve to balance NHEJ and HR activities in different phases of the cell cycle. Although IR-induced DNA-PKcs phosphorylation is significantly attenuated in the S phase, we find that the physiologically relevant DSBs generated when a DNA replication fork encounters a damaged template result in robust DNA-PKcs phosphorylation and focus formation. Consistent with this finding, cells deficient in DNA-PKcs show radiation sensitivity in the S phase, although to a lesser degree than cells in the G1 phase (Fig. 5A) indicating that the activity of DNA-PKcs is still required in the S phase, perhaps to repair DSBs associated with DNA replication. Therefore, although DSBs generated by IR do not elicit a DNA-PK activation response in S phase cells, the more physiologically relevant replication-associated breaks may perhaps be preferentially repaired by DNA-PK. It is tempting to speculate that the quick response of DNA-PK to such breaks may be due to an intimate association with the replication machinery mediated perhaps by replication protein A, with which DNA-PK is known to associate and phosphorylate (40Shao R.G. Cao C.X. Zhang H. Kohn K.W. Wold M.S. Pommier Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The exact molecular mechanism by which Ser-2056 phosphorylation regulates DNA-PKcs still remains to be elucidated. Lack of Ser-2056 phosphorylation does not affect the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs (Fig. 3C). The localization of DNA-PKcs to DSBs is also not dependent on Ser-2056 phosphorylation, as S2056A mutant DNA-PKcs is able to localize to the DNA damage sites as visualized by immunofluorescent staining with the anti-pT2609 antibody.2 It is plausible that Ser-2056 phosphorylation could create a docking site for other damage-responsive proteins especially in light of recent evidence indicating that the Brca1 carboxyl-terminal domain interacts with phosphorylated “SQ” or “TQ” motifs (41Manke I.A. Lowery D.M. Nguyen A. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2003; 302: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 42Yu X. Chini C.C. He M. Mer G. Chen J. Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Identification of potential pS2056-binding proteins would certainly help to unveil the molecular mechanisms underlying the DNA-PKcs-mediated NHEJ repair pathway. In summary, we have identified Ser-2056 as a DSB-induced DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation site in vivo and demonstrated that Ser-2056 phosphorylation plays a significant role in NHEJ-mediated DSB repair. In addition, we have also presented evidence showing that the phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs is regulated in a cell cycle- and DNA replication-dependent manner. Although IR-induced DNA-PKcs phosphorylation is attenuated in the S phase, DNA replication-associated DSBs result in DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation and localization at the sites of DNA synthesis."

Keski-Oja J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). The latent transforming growth factor β-binding proteins (LTBPs) are members of a family of ECM proteins that are key regulators of transforming growth factor-βs (TGFβs) (2Saharinen J. Hyytiainen M. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 3Sinha S. Nevett C. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M.

First, LTBP1 associates with latent TGFβ inside the cell and facilitates secretion of the latent complex (5Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). LTBP1 then targets latent TGFβ to the ECM for storage (6Taipale J. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Keski-Oja J. J.

LTBP1 may also provide a vehicle for release of the latent growth factor, following proteolytic cleavage of LTBP1 and release of C-terminal LTBP1 fragments, still bound to the latent TGFβ (7Dallas S.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4689-4696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Finally, there is also evidence that LTBP1 plays a role in activation of the latent TGFβ complex (10Annes J.P. Chen Y. Munger J.S. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 11Flaumenhaft R. Abe M. Sato Y. Miyazono K. Harpel J. Heldin C.H. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 995-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). LTBPs are members of a larger superfamily of matrix proteins that include fibrillins 1 and 2, the recently reported fibrillin 3 (12Corson G.M. Charbonneau N.L. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Genomics. 2004; 83: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and the latent TGFβ-binding proteins 1–4 (reviewed in Refs. 2Saharinen J. Hyytiainen M. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J.

At least three of the LTBPs (LTBPs 1, 3, and 4) can form complexes with latent TGFβ1, whereas LTBP2 appears not to bind to latent TGFβ (15Saharinen J. Keski-Oja J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2691-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). LTBP1 is also secreted by many cell types in a free form that is not bound to TGFβ. The percentage of free LTBP1 varies from 10 to 90%, depending on the cell type and the differentiation stage examined (6Taipale J. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Keski-Oja J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 9Taipale J. Lohi J. Saharinen J. Kovanen P.T. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol.

These observations raise the possibility that LTBP1 may also have important functions that are independent of TGFβ and may be related to its properties as an ECM protein. At present, little is known about how LTBPs function as matrix proteins. Like the fibrillins, their primary structure consists predominantly of 6 cysteine (epidermal growth factor-like) repeats similar to the motifs found in the epidermal growth factor precursor and 8 cysteine repeats (termed “TB repeats”) unique to the LTBPs and fibrillins. Recent studies have demonstrated that the third TB repeats in LTBPs 1, 3, and 4 are the sites for covalent binding of latent TGFβ (15Saharinen J. Keski-Oja J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2691-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 17Chen Y. Ali T. Todorovic V. O'Leary J.M. Downing K.A. Rifkin D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Immunolocalization studies have shown that LTBP1 co-localizes with fibrillin-1 in 10-nm microfibrils in the ECM of osteoblasts (18Dallas S.L. Keene D.R. Bruder S.P. Saharinen J. Sakai L.Y. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 68-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). LTBP1 has also been shown to co-localize with fibronectin (18Dallas S.L. Keene D.R. Bruder S.P.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 187-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a binding interaction between LTBP1 and fibronectin has been suggested by ligand blotting studies (19Taipale J. Saharinen J. Hedman K. Keski-Oja J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Fibronectin is required for the assembly of several ECM proteins, including type I collagen (21Velling T. Risteli J. Wennerberg K. Mosher D.F. Johansson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37377-37381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), fibulin I (22Godyna S. Mann D.M. Argraves W.S. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), thrombospondin (23Sottile J. Hocking D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3546-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), and fibrinogen (24Pereira M. Rybarczyk B.J. Odrljin T.M. Hocking D.C. Sottile J. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 609-617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that fibronectin may play a critical role in LTBP1 assembly into the ECM and may thereby play a role in regulation of TGFβ. Multiple approaches were used to disrupt fibronectin assembly, and the effect on LTBP1 and TGFβ incorporation was determined. These studies highlight a novel role for fibronectin in the regulation of TGFβ via LTBP1 interactions. Reagents—Human plasma fibronectin was purified as described previously (25Mosher D.F. Johnson R.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 408: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or purchased from Invitrogen. The 70-kDa N-terminal and 160-kDa fibronectin fragments were prepared as described previously (26Peters D.M. Mosher D.F. Scanning Microsc. 1987; 1: 757-763PubMed Google Scholar). 30- and 40-kDa fibronectin fragments as well as superfibronectin were purchased from Sigma. The H120 recombinant fibronectin fragment was prepared as described previously (27Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Craig S.E. Garratt A.N. Clements J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27224-27230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibronectin-stripped serum was prepared by passing the serum over a gelatin-Sepharose column as described elsewhere (28McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Antibodies against LTBP1 included a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Ab39; kindly supplied by K. Miyazono, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo) (18Dallas S.L. Keene D.R. Bruder S.P. Saharinen J. Sakai L.Y. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 68-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 29Kanzaki T. Olofsson A. Moren A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Miyazono K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Cell. 1990; 61: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against a peptide in rat LTBP1 was also used, which recognizes mouse and rat but not human LTBP1 (18Dallas S.L. Keene D.R. Bruder S.P. Saharinen J. Sakai L.Y. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 68-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Fibronectin antibodies included a mouse monoclonal antibody (IgM) against cellular fibronectin (Sigma), a mouse monoclonal antibody (IgG) against the human fibronectin ED-A domain (Harlan), a mouse monoclonal antibody IgG (39B6) directed against type II repeats 12–14 of human fibronectin (30Mostafavi-Pour Z. Askari J.A. Whittard J.D. Humphries M.J. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against fibronectin purified from human platelets (Neomarkers, Freemont, CA). A peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was used for Western blotting and ELISA. All secondary antibodies for immunofluorescent staining were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Various combinations of fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies were used as appropriate for each combination of primary antibodies, as stated in the figure legends. In some experiments, biotinylated secondary antibodies were used in conjunction with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cell Culture—Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Primary fetal rat calvarial (FRC) osteoblasts were prepared as described previously (7Dallas S.L. Miyazono K. Skerry T.M. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 18Dallas S.L. Keene D.R. Bruder S.P. Saharinen J. Sakai L.Y. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 68-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). UMR-106 cells were a gift from T. J. Martin (St. Vincent Institute of Medical Research, Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. FN-null (FN–/–) and heterozygous (FN+/–) embryonic fibroblasts were derived as described elsewhere (31Saoncella S. Echtermeyer F. Denhez F. Nowlen J.K. Mosher D.F. Robinson S.D. Hynes R.O. Goetinck P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2805-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). For experiments examining LTBP1 assembly in FN-null fibroblasts, the cells were cultured in the presence of FN-stripped serum with or without the addition of 10 μg/ml plasma fibronectin. For growth curve experiments, cells were plated in 96-well plates at 20,000 cells/cm2. Cells were trypsinized at the specified time points, and cell number was determined by using a Coulter counter (Beckman Coulter Inc.). Immunocytochemistry—For immunocytochemistry, cells were plated in Lab-Tek chamber slides at 20,000 cells/cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FN-stripped fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin with or without 10 μg/ml plasma fibronectin. At confluence, the media were changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% FN-stripped fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and other additives as above, with or without the addition of fibronectin or fibronectin fragments. The cells were cultured for the specified periods, with media changed every 3 days. Co-localization of LTBP1, fibronectin, and type I collagen was performed using double staining indirect immunofluorescence techniques as described previously (18Dallas S.L. Keene D.R. Bruder S.P. Saharinen J. Sakai L.Y. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 68-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The specimens were viewed and photographed digitally using a Leica DMRXA microscope with epifluorescence illumination and a Photometric Cool-snap FX CCD camera. For double labeling experiments, multiple controls were performed, including using nonimmune serum or control IgG in place of primary antibody, testing each primary antibody individually using both secondary antibodies to exclude cross-species reactivity of the secondary antibodies, and preincubating the primary antibody with the immunizing peptide (where available). TGFβ ELISA and Modified ELISA for Detection of Relative Amounts of LTBP1—A commercial ELISA (TGFβ1 Emax; Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was used for measurement of TGFβ1 in conditioned media samples collected over 48 h or in guanidine HCl extracts of the ECM, prepared as described elsewhere (32Pfeilschifter J. Erdmann J. Storch S. Ziegler R. Weinreb M. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1999; 64: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Values were normalized to cell number. For measurement of total (active + latent) TGFβ, the samples were acidified using HCl and then reneutralized prior to measurement using NaOH according to the ELISA manufacturer's instructions. To quantify the relative amounts of LTBP1 in the ECM, a modified ELISA was used. Cells were grown in 96-well plates in media with or without fibronectin. The plates were fixed in 95% ethanol, then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin + 1% milk, followed by incubation in primary antibodies against LTBP1. After washing, the amount of bound LTBP1 antibody was determined using the Vectorstain-Elite ABC immunodetection kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in conjunction with O-phenylenediamine as a reaction substrate. Alternatively, the vector VIP substrate kit was used, followed by solubilization of the reaction product by incubating for 10 min at room temperature in 50 μl of 2 m KCl, then adding 50 μl of Me2SO and incubating for a further 10 min. The plates were read on an ELX 800 plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT) at 450 nm, and background subtraction was performed using a blank control that had been incubated with nonspecific IgG in place of primary antibody. Values were normalized to total protein content of the cell lysate or to cell number as determined using a Coulter counter. Immunoelectron Microscopy—For immunoelectron microscopy, FN-null and heterozygous fibroblasts were cultured on Thermanox coverslips (Nalge Nunc International) in media with or without added fibronectin as described above. Media were changed every 3 days, and coverslips were harvested on days 6, 14, and 21. Immunogold staining was performed on unfixed specimens as described previously (18Dallas S.L. Keene D.R. Bruder S.P. Saharinen J. Sakai L.Y. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 68-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) using anti-LTBP1 and anti-fibronectin antibodies each diluted 1:10. For detection, a donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody-6-nm gold conjugate and a donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody-18-nm gold conjugate were used (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The samples were fixed after immunogold staining and processed for transmission electron microscopy as described previously (18Dallas S.L. Keene D.R. Bruder S.P. Saharinen J. Sakai L.Y. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 68-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). They were then embedded in Taab epoxy resin (Taab Laboratories Equipment Ltd., Aldermaston, UK). After polymerization, the coverslips were removed to leave the cell layer exposed on the outer surface of the block. Ultrathin sections were cut at a slight angle to the growth substrate by using a diamond knife. Sections were examined with or without contrast in a Philips EM 301 transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 60 kV. LTBP1 Stably Expressing Cell Lines—To generate UMR-106 cell lines stably overexpressing LTBP1, a full-length human LTBP1 construct in the PSV7d vector (kindly provided by K. Miyazono, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo) was co-transfected at a 10:1 ratio with an RSVneo selection vector, using calcium phosphate precipitation as described elsewhere (33Chen D. Harris M.A. Rossini G. Dunstan C.R. Dallas S.L. Feng J.Q. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1997; 60: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were selected with 400 μg/ml G418, and resistant single cell clones were screened for LTBP1 expression using an ELISA, as described previously (7Dallas S.L. Miyazono K. Skerry T.M. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Three high expressing clones (0.2–1.5 μg/ml) were selected for further study. Control clones transfected with RSVneo alone were used for comparison. FPLC Analysis—FPLC fractionation was performed as described previously (16Dallas S.L. Park-Snyder S. Miyazono K. Twardzik D. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6815-6821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 48-h serum-free, phenol red-free conditioned media harvested from 90–95% confluent cultures. 150 ml of conditioned medium was concentrated 10-fold over a 50-kDa cut-off membrane using a minisette concentrator (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The samples were then lyophilized, reconstituted, and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.2, prior to application over an analytical Mono-Q anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris buffer. Fractions were tested for TGFβ activity using the alkaline phosphatase microassay as described previously (16Dallas S.L. Park-Snyder S. Miyazono K. Twardzik D. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6815-6821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—For metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation, cells were plated into 12-well multiwell plates at 10,000 cells/cm2 growth area. At 90% confluence, the cells were metabolically labeled as described previously (8Dallas S.L. Rosser J.L. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21352-21360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) by using 100 μCi/well [35S]cysteine for 6 h. LTBP1 was measured in the culture supernatants as well as the ECM by immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described previously (8Dallas S.L. Rosser J.L. Mundy G.R.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6815-6821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A plasmin digestion was used to release the ECM-bound LTBP1 (7Dallas S.L. Miyazono K. Skerry T.M. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 19Taipale J. Saharinen J. Hedman K. Keski-Oja J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Proteins in concentrated conditioned media samples or plasmin matrix digests were separated by SDS-PAGE using 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide mini gels, and immunoblotting was performed as described previously (7Dallas S.L. Miyazono K. Skerry T.M. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The immunostained bands were visualized using the Renaissance ECL detection system according to manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Samples were normalized to total protein content or to cell number prior to loading on the gels. Time Course of LTBP1 and Fibronectin Assembly in Primary Osteoblast Cultures—To determine the time course of LTBP1 and fibronectin assembly, immunolocalization studies were performed over a time course of 1–21 days (Fig. 1). Fibronectin initially appeared as short fibrillar structures on the surface of fetal rat calvarial cells after 24 h in culture (Fig. 1, d1). At this stage, no immunoreactive LTBP1 was present on the cell surface or in the extracellular matrix. By 2 days in culture (Fig. 1, d2), the fibronectin became organized into a fibrillar network in the ECM, and a small amount of LTBP1 was observed that co-localized with fibronectin. By 3 and 5 days of culture (Fig. 1, d3 and d5), LTBP1 was localized in a fibrillar network that co-distributed with fibronectin. The incorporation of LTBP1 therefore lagged 1–2 days behind that of fibronectin, and there was always a proportion of fibronectin-positive fibrils that did not stain for LTBP1. Between days 5 and 21, there was an increase in formation of LTBP1 fibrils, which became organized into long parallel fibrillar arrays. At the same time, there was a progression from distinct fibronectin fibrils to fibrils with a more diffuse appearance. The co-localization of LTBP1 and fibronectin started to diverge until day 21, when LTBP1 became localized in fibrils that were clearly distinct from fibronectin. Identical results were obtained by using the human MG63 osteosarcoma cell line as well as with human skin fibroblasts and using two independent antibodies for LTBP1 and fibronectin (data not shown). Double-labeled immunogold localization for LTBP1 and fibronectin demonstrated co-localization of these two molecules in fibrillar structures in 6-day fetal rat calvarial cell cultures (Fig. 2). In later (14-day) cultures, some fibrils could be found that were labeled with both antibodies; however, LTBP1 was also frequently found in bundles of 10-nm microfibrils that were not labeled with fibronectin antibodies (Fig. 2). Inhibition of LTBP1 and TGFβ1 Incorporation by a 70-kDa N-terminal Fibronectin Fragment—To determine whether fibronectin was required for assembly of LTBP1 into bone ECM, fetal rat calvarial cell cultures were treated for 6 days with a 70-kDa N-terminal fibronectin fragment (Fig. 3a). This fragment blocks assembly of both endogenous and exogenous fibronectin in fibroblasts by occupying binding sites that are required for fibronectin self-association (28McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Treatment with 70 μg/ml of the fibronectin fragment (Fig. 3a, 70K) resulted in a dramatic reduction in fibronectin incorporation compared with untreated controls (control) or control cultures treated with plasma fibronectin (pFN). This was paralleled by a reduction in LTBP1 incorporation into the ECM. Dose-response experiments showed a significant reduction in LTBP1 incorporation at doses between 10 and 70 μg/ml, as determined by immunofluorescence (data not shown) and also by quantitation of the relative amounts of incorporated LTBP1 using a modified ELISA (Fig. 3b). Time course experiments indicated that at early time points (days 1–3) there was a virtual absence of both fibronectin and LTBP1 in the ECM of cells treated with the fibronectin 70-kDa fragment. However, by day 5, fibronectin and LTBP1 incorporation began to partially recover. This recovery of LTBP1 incorporation appeared to be due to the fact that even the highest dose of the 70-kDa fibronectin fragment failed to completely block fibronectin incorporation. The above results were replicated by using an LTBP1 antibody that recognizes the proline-rich hinge region and using MG63 human osteosarcoma cells (data not shown). TGFβ 1 is the major TGFβ isoform produced in bone (7Dallas S.L. Miyazono K. Skerry T.M. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 34Seyedin S.M. Thomas T.C. Thompson A.Y. Rosen D.M. Piez K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). To determine whether inhibition of fibronectin assembly also affected incorporation of TGFβ into the ECM, the amount of TGFβ1 in the ECM was measured using a commercial ELISA (Fig. 3c). Treatment of fetal rat calvarial cells with the 70-kDa fibronectin fragment reduced the amount of latent TGFβ1 stored in the ECM by 80%. This was not because of reduced synthesis and secretion of TGFβ as increased amounts of latent TGFβ were detected in the conditioned media of the treated cultures (Fig. 3c). LTBP1 Assembly in Fibronectin-null Embryonic Fibroblasts—To define further the role of fibronectin in the assembly of LTBP1 into the ECM, we examined LTBP1 assembly in fibroblasts differentiated from mouse embryonic stem cells that were null for the fibronectin gene (FN-null) (Fig. 4). Both heterozygous (+/–) and FN-null (–/–) embryonic fibroblasts synthesized and secreted LTBP1 in amounts that were grossly equivalent to the amounts produced by fetal rat calvarial cells. 2S. L. Dallas, unpublished observations.Fig. 4a shows double-stained immunolocalization of LTBP1 and fibronectin in the ECM of 6-day cultures of FN-null fibroblasts (–/–), as compared with heterozygous controls (+/–). The cells were cultured in fibronectin-stripped serum to ensure that no exogenous fibronectin was present. In control cells, a network of fibronectin fibrils was present in the ECM, and LTBP1 was found to co-distribute with this network. In contrast, no fibronectin was detected in the ECM of FN-null cells, and this was associated with a failure in LTBP1 incorporation. Western analysis (Fig. 4b) indicated that this effect was not because of reduced expression of LTBP1 in the FN-null cells, as they secreted a large amount of LTBP1 into the conditioned media (Fig. 4b, black arrow) but failed to incorporate it into the ECM (Fig. 4b, gray arrow). In contrast, the heterozygous cells had lower amounts of LTBP1 in the conditioned media, with the major proportion in t"
https://openalex.org/W2155483535,"Dorsal root ganglia neurons in culture die through programmed cell death when exposed to elevated glucose, providing an in vitro model system for the investigation of the mechanisms leading to diabetic neuropathy. This study examines the time course of programmed cell death induction, regulation of cellular antioxidant capacity, and the protective effects of antioxidants in neurons exposed to hyperglycemia. We demonstrate that the first 2 h of hyperglycemia are sufficient to induce oxidative stress and programmed cell death. Using fluorimetric analysis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, in vitro assays of antioxidant enzymes, and immunocytochemical assays of cell death, we demonstrate superoxide formation, inhibition of aconitase, and lipid peroxidation within 1 h of hyperglycemia. These are followed by caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Antioxidant potential increases by 3-6 h but is insufficient to protect these neurons. Application of the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid potently prevents glucose-induced oxidative stress and cell death. This study identifies cellular therapeutic targets to prevent diabetic neuropathy. Since oxidative stress is a common feature of the micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes, the present findings have broad application to the treatment of diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2030508471,"In the context of bone development and regeneration, the intimate association of the vascular endothelium with osteogenic cells suggests that endothelial cells (ECs) may directly regulate the differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells. To investigate this question, bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were cultured: in the presence of EC-conditioned medium, on EC extracellular matrix, and in EC cocultures with and without cell contact. RNA and protein were isolated from ECs and analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively, for expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2). In animal studies, BMSCs and ECs were cotransplanted into severe combined immunodeficient mice on biodegradable polymer matrices, and histomorphometric analysis was performed to determine the extent of new bone and blood vessel formation. ECs significantly increased BMSC osteogenic differentiation in vitro only when cultured in direct contact. ECs expressed BMP-2, and experiments employing interfering RNA inhibition confirmed its production as contributing to the increased BMSC osteogenic differentiation. In vivo, cotransplantation of ECs with BMSCs resulted in greater bone formation than did transplantation of BMSCs alone. These data suggest that ECs function not only to form the microvasculature that delivers nutrients to developing bone but also to modulate the differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2027577700,"Epithelial tight junctions form a selectively permeable barrier to ions and small molecules. Junctional adhesion molecule 1 (JAM1/JAM-A/F11R) is a tight junction-associated transmembrane protein that has been shown to participate in the regulation of epithelial barrier function. In a recent study, we presented evidence suggesting that JAM1 homodimer formation is critical for epithelial barrier function (Mandell, K. J., McCall, I. C., and Parkos, C. A. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 16254–16262). Here we have used small interfering RNA to investigate the effect of the loss of JAM1 expression on epithelial cell function. Consistent with our previous study, knockdown of JAM1 was observed to increase paracellular permeability in epithelial monolayers. Interestingly, knockdown of JAM1 also produced dramatic changes in cell morphology, and a similar effect was observed with expression of a JAM1 mutant lacking the putative homodimer interface. Further studies revealed that JAM1 knockdown decreased cell-matrix adhesion and spreading on matrix proteins that are ligands of β1 integrins. These changes were characterized by a decrease in β1 integrin protein levels and loss of β1 integrin staining at the cell surface. Immunolabeling of cells for the small GTPase Rap1, a known activator of β1 integrins, revealed colocalization of Rap1 with JAM1 at intercellular junctions, and knockdown of JAM1 resulted in decreased Rap1 activity. Lastly, knockdown of Rap1b resulted in diminished β1 integrin expression and altered cell morphology analogous to that observed with knockdown of JAM1. Together, these results suggest that JAM1 regulates epithelial cell morphology and β1 integrin expression by modulating activity of the small GTPase Rap1."
https://openalex.org/W1991594572,The mechanism of voltage gating in K+ channels is controversial. The paddle model posits that highly charged voltage-sensor domains move relatively freely across the lipid bilayer in response to membrane depolarization; competing models picture the charged S4 voltage-sensor helix as being shielded from lipid contact by other parts of the protein. We measured the apparent free energy of membrane insertion of a K+-channel S4 helix into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and conclude that S4 is poised very near the threshold of efficient bilayer insertion. Our results suggest that the paddle model is not inconsistent with the high charge content of S4.
https://openalex.org/W2119148710,"The ubiquitin E3 protein ligase Nedd4-2 is a physiological regulator of the epithelial sodium channel ENaC, which is essential for transepithelial Na+ transport and is linked to Liddle's syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of human salt-sensitive hypertension. Nedd4-2 function is negatively regulated by phosphorylation via a serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible protein kinase (Sgk1), which serves as a mechanism to inhibit the ubiquitination-dependent degradation of ENaC. We report here that 14-3-3 proteins participate in this regulatory process through a direct interaction with a phosphorylated form of human Nedd4-2 (a human gene product of KIAA0439, termed hNedd4-2). The interaction is dependent on Sgk1-catalyzed phosphorylation of hNedd4-2 at Ser-468. We found that this interaction preserved the activity of the Sgk1-stimulated ENaC-dependent Na+ current while disrupting the interaction decreased ENaC density on the Xenopus laevis oocytes surface possibly by enhancing Nedd4-2-mediated ubiquitination that leads to ENaC degradation. Our findings suggest that 14-3-3 proteins modulate the cell surface density of ENaC cooperatively with Sgk1 kinase by maintaining hNedd4-2 in an inactive phosphorylated state.

Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). This channel is distributed widely in salt-reabsorbing epithelia and represents the first and rate-limiting step for transepithelial Na+ transport (2.Garty H. Palmaer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 3.Stokes J.B. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 2318-2333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that mutations in ENaC subunits are associated with several heritable human disorders exhibiting abnormal regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. For example, dominant gain-of-function mutations in ENaC cause Liddle's syndrome, an inherited form of hypertension (4.Shimkets R.A. Warnock D.G. Bositis C.M. Nelson-Williams C. Hansson J.H. Schambelan M. Gill Jr., J.R. Ulick S. Milora R.V. Findling J.W. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Lifton R.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 407-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Conversely, loss-of-function mutations cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type I, a salt-wasting hypotensive condition (5.Chang S.S. Grunder S. Hanukoglu A. Rosler A. Mathew P.M. Hanukoglu I. Schild L. Lu Y. Shimkets R.A. Nelson-Williams C. Rossier B.C. Lifton R.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Thus, proper regulation of ENaC activity is critical for maintenance of whole body Na+ homeostasis and for blood pressure control. The activity of ENaC is regulated by a variety of mechanisms including ubiquitination and phosphorylation. At least two regulatory proteins participate directly in this regulation: the neural precursor cell-expressed, developmentally down-regulated gene 4 isoform (Nedd4-2) and serum, glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (Sgk1) (6.Kamynina E. Staub O. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F377-F387Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Nedd4-2 is a ubiquitin E3 protein ligase composed of four WW domains and a ubiquitin ligase Hect domain (7.Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Nedd4-2 interacts directly with ENaC by association of its WW domains with the PY motifs present in each ENaC subunit to ubiquitinate the ENaC channel (9.Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), ultimately resulting in a drastic decrease in Na+ current in Xenopus laevis oocytes (10.Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Cook D.I.

The importance of this regulation is also suggested by findings that Liddle's syndrome is linked to mutations in ENaC which invariably cause either deletion or alteration of the β or γPY motif (14.Snyder P.M.

Sgk1 is an early aldosterone-induced protein kinase that relays signals from the pathways that are transmitted via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A). Sgk1 induces cell surface expression of ENaC and increases Na+ current when both Sgk1 and ENaC are coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes (16.Náray-Fejes-Tóth A. Canessa C. Cleaveland E.S. Aldrich G.

Recently, it was reported that Nedd4-2 is a substrate of Sgk1 and, importantly, that the Sgk1-dependent phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 reduces its affinity for ENaC, thereby reducing the inhibitory effect of Nedd4-2 on ENaC (18.Debonneville C.

Thus, it appears that Sgk1 and Nedd4-2 are in a common cell signaling pathway that regulates the cell surface density of ENaC by a ubiquitination-dependent mechanism, although Sgk1 may also regulate ENaC activity by phosphorylating its α subunit directly (20.Diakov A. Korbmacher C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38134-38142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, the details of the mechanism remain unknown (6.Kamynina E. Staub O.

The 14-3-3 proteins recognize the phosphopeptide consensus sequence motifs RXXpS/TXP and RXXXpS/TXP (where pS/T is phospho-Ser/Thr and X is any amino acid; see Refs. 21.Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W.

Here we report that a 14-3-3 protein binds Nedd4-2 (a human KIAA0439 gene product; termed hNedd4-2), when it is phosphorylated at Ser-468 by Sgk1 kinase. The interaction inhibits the dephosphorylation of hNedd4-2, reduces the rate of Nedd4-2-catalyzed ubiquitination of ENaC subunits, and maintains the Sgk1-stimulated increase in ENaC-mediated current. Based on these findings, we propose that a 14-3-3 protein is a cofactor for the regulation of ENaC function via an Sgk-1/Nedd4-2-dependent mechanism. Materials—Anti-myc-Sepharose beads were generated by covalent coupling to monoclonal myc antibody 9E10 as described (27.Ichimura T. Wakamiya-Tsuruta A. Itagaki C. Taoka M. Hayano T. Natsume T. Isobe T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5566-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Antibody 9E10 was purified from mouse ascites by ammonium sulfate fractionation and protein G-Sepharose chromatography. Anti-FLAG-Sepharose beads were obtained from Sigma. GST fusions with hNedd4-2 and the hNedd-S468A mutant were expressed in XL1 Blue with 30 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 16–18 °C for 8 h and purified by glutathione-agarose chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). 14-3-3η was prepared by cleavage of GST-14-3-3η (28.Ichimura T. Uchiyama J. Kunihiro O. Ito M. Horigome T. Omata S. Shinkai F. Kaji H. Isobe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28515-28518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with Factor X (Bio-Rad). Antibodies to PAN-14-3-3 proteins and each 14-3-3 isoform were provided by Santa Cruz and Immuno-Biological Laboratories, respectively. Phosphopeptides were synthesized and purified by C18 reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. Plasmid Construction—The myc-TEV-FLAG (MEF) tag cassette (Supplemental Fig. S1) was generated by DNA synthesis and inserted into the cloning sites in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen; termed pcDNA3-MEF) and retroviral expression vector pLNCX5 (Ref. 29.Cunningham M.E. Stephens R.M. Kaplan D.R. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10957-10967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, termed pLNCX5-MEF). To create the MEF-14-3-3η fusion construct, bovine 14-3-3η cDNA was produced by PCR using pAP62 (30.Ichimura T. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Takahashi N. Araki K. Kuwano R. Takahashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7084-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) as a template and then inserted into pLNCX5-MEF. To create the myc-TEV (ME)-tagged hNedd4-2 or GST-hNedd4-2 fusion constructs, the human KIAA0439 cDNA was amplified by PCR using the KIAA0439 plasmid (Riken) as a template and inserted into pcDNA3-MEF and pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. The 14-3-3η V180D and hNedd-S468A mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, using the mutagenic primers 5′-GGG CCG TGG CTG AGC TGG AC-3′ (for 14-3-3η V180D) and 5′-AGC CTC AGC GCG CCA ACA G-3′ (for hNedd-S468A). PC12 Cell Culture—PC12 cells (a gift from Dr. L. A. Greene) were grown on collagen-coated tissue culture plates in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated donor horse and 5% fetal bovine serum, as described previously (31.Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar). Retroviral infection was carried out as described previously (29.Cunningham M.E. Stephens R.M. Kaplan D.R. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10957-10967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) by adding 0.5–1 ml of a virus-containing supernatant, recovered from packaging cells (Bosc23), to 50% confluent PC12 cell cultures. Infected cells were cultured for 1 week and then subjected to selection with G418 for at least 1 month. Surviving colonies were isolated and clonally expanded for characterization. The PC12-Mh clone was chosen for biochemical assessment on the basis of protein expression (10–20% endogenous 14-3-3 proteins; Supplemental Fig. S2) and similarity with parental cells with regard to cellular morphology (data not shown). MEF Purification—PC12-Mh cells in six 10-cm dishes (∼5 × 107 cells) were lysed in 3 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4,1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 5 μm ZnCl2, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was passed through a 5-μm filter, incubated with 150 μl of Sepharose beads for 60 min at 4 °C, and then passed through a 0.65-μm filter. The filtrated supernatant was mixed with 150 μl of anti-myc-conjugated Sepharose beads for the first immunoprecipitation. After incubation for 90 min at 4 °C, the beads were washed five times with 1.5 ml of TNTG buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100), twice with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100), and finally once with TNT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100). The washed beads were incubated with 15 units of TEV protease (Invitrogen) in 150 μl of TNT buffer to release bound materials from the beads. After incubation for 60 min at room temperature, the supernatant was pooled, and the beads were washed twice with 75 μl of buffer A. The resulting supernatants were combined together and incubated with 25 μl of FLAG-Sepharose beads for the second immunoprecipitation. After incubation for 60 min at room temperature, the beads were washed three times with 500 μl of buffer A, and proteins bound to the immobilized 14-3-3η on the FLAG beads were dissociated by incubation with 1 mm synthetic phosphopeptides (LSQRQRSTpSTPNVHA, based on amino acids 250–265 of cRaf-1; Ref. 20.Diakov A. Korbmacher C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38134-38142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) in buffer A for 120 min at 4 °C. Approximately 3 μg of protein (0.01% of stating materials) was routinely recovered by this procedure. Tandem Mass Spectrometry—Proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. The stained bands were excised and digested in the gel with Lys-C, and the resulting peptide mixtures were analyzed by the direct nanoflow LC-MS/MS system, equipped with an electrospray interface reversed phase column, a nanoflow gradient device, a high resolution Q-TOF hybrid MS (Q-TOF2, Micromass), and an automated data analysis system (32.Natsume T. Yamauchi Y. Nakayama H. Shinkawa T. Yanagida M. Takahashi N. Isobe T. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4725-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). All MS/MS spectra were searched against the nonredundant protein sequence data base maintained at the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the Mascot program (Matrixscience) to identify proteins. The MS/MS signal assignments were also confirmed manually. In Vitro Phosphorylation and Binding Assay—Phosphorylation of GST-hNedd4-2 and the hNedd-S468A mutant (1 μg each) was performed at 30 °C for 30 min in a reaction containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 15 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm ATP, 25 ng of Sgk1 (Δ1–59, S422D; Upstate Biotechnology), and 2 μg of 14-3-3η in a final volume of 200 μl. When necessary, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added to the mixture. For binding experiments, glutathione-agarose (∼50 μl) was added to the reaction and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The protein complexes bound to the beads were washed five times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or Western blotting with antibodies to 14-3-3η. Metabolic 32P Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells transiently expressing ME-hNedd4-2 were incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 20 min and then labeled in the same medium containing 40 μCi/ml 32Pi for 2 h. After incubation, cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and the expressed ME-hNedd4-2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-myc-Sepharose. The immunocomplexes were washed five times in buffer A and once in TNT buffer, and the ME-hNedd4-2 was released from the beads by digestion with TEV protease. For the experiment shown in Fig. 2B (lanes 1–4), the cells were also placed in fresh serum-free medium for 18 h prior to initiation of the 32P labeling. Dephosphorylation Assay—GST-hNedd4-2 or the GST-hNedd-S468A mutant (1 μg each) was phosphorylated by Sgk1 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and then pulled down with ∼50 μl of glutathione-agarose. After washing, the beads were suspended in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, and incubated with 2 μg of 14-3-3η for 10 min at room temperature. The dephosphorylation reaction was performed at room temperature for 30 min by the addition of 0.5 unit of PP1 catalytic subunit (Sigma). Electrophysiological Measurements and Immunofluorescence Studies—Electrophysiological studies in Xenopus oocytes were performed as described previously (33.Yamamura H. Ugawa S. Ueda T. Nagao M.

In brief, cRNAs (three human ENaC subunits, 0.1 ng each; Sgk1, 0.2 ng; wild type or V180D mutant 14-3-3η, 0.5 ng) were injected into Xenopus oocytes. Electrophysiological recordings were taken 24 h after injection using a two-electrode voltage clamp technique. The recording solution had an ionic composition of 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH. All electrophysiological recordings were performed at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C) at a holding potential of -60 mV. The expression of ENaC was examined by immunohistochemistry using rat α ENaC-FLAG cRNA as reported previously (18.Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C. Chraibi A. Pratt J.H. Horisberger J.D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7052-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). In brief, FLAG-tagged αENaC and nontagged β and γENaC were expressed in oocytes together with Sgk1 and either 14-3-3η or its V180D mutant. Cryosections (10 μm) of Xenopus oocytes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer at room temperature for 30 min and then washed with 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline. These sections were pretreated with 5% normal goat serum (Dako) in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 30 min. ENaC-FLAG was detected with 3.3 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 (Kodak) for 12 h at 4 °C. Sections were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently incubated with 2.0 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) for 1.5 h at room temperature. These sections were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, mounted in Aquatex (Merck), and observed using an Olympus AX70 fluorescent microscope. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—The ubiquitination assay was performed according to the procedure described by Staub et al. (13.Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. HEK293 cells were transiently coexpressed with FLAG-tagged αENaC or γENaC (35.Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5370-5375Crossref Scopus (399) Google Scholar) together with other protein components as indicated in Fig. 4. After 48 h, cells were lysed in 1% SDS and boiled for 5 min. Samples were subsequently diluted with 9 volumes of lysis buffer and then incubated with anti-FLAG-Sepharose beads for 90 min at room temperature. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer containing 0.1% SDS, and bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HA (Upstate) or anti-FLAG (Kodak). Identification of hNedd4-2-KIAA0439 as a 14-3-3-interacting Partner—We developed a novel tandem affinity purification approach coupled with MS-based proteomics technology to identify cellular proteins associated with the 14-3-3η isoform in PC12 cells. The purification strategy employed an original N-terminal affinity tag (termed MEF) composed of two independent epitope tags, myc and FLAG, that were fused in tandem and separated by a spacer sequence containing a TEV protease cleavage site (myc-TEV-FLAG; Supplemental Fig. S1). The MEF cassette was fused to the N terminus of the bovine 14-3-3η isoform, and PC12 cells were transformed with the cDNA to generate a monoclonal cell line (termed PC12-Mh) that stably expressed the MEF-fused version of the 14-3-3η isoform (see “Experimental Procedures” and Supplemental Fig. S2). After PC12-Mh cells were lysed, the expressed MEF-14-3-3η was recovered with its binding proteins (see “Experimental Procedures” and Supplemental Fig. S3). Ultimately, proteins bound to MEF-η immobilized on the FLAG beads were dissociated with a synthetic phosphopeptide (LSQRQRSTpSTPNVHA) designed to mimic the 14-3-3-binding site of Raf kinase (21.Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A (lane 2) shows the SDS-PAGE profiles of the dissociated proteins. About 40 proteins with molecular masses between 40 and 300 kDa were reproducibly detected by this procedure, whereas no proteins were detected using a lysate obtained from control cells transformed with vector alone (lane 1). Two controls were used to assess the specificity of this interaction. First, we used a nonphosphorylated peptide (LSQRQRSTSTPNVHA) instead of its phosphorylated form to dissociate the complex (lane 3). In the second control, we performed the procedure using PC12 cells expressing a V180D point mutant of 14-3-3η that replaced Val-180 with Asp, a mutation known to disrupt the interaction of 14-3-3η with a variety of targets including ExoS (36.Masters S.C. Pederson K.J. Zhang L. Barbieri J.T. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5216-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), ASK1 (37.Zhang L. Chen J. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8511-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and KLC2 (27.Ichimura T. Wakamiya-Tsuruta A. Itagaki C. Taoka M. Hayano T. Natsume T. Isobe T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5566-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (lane 4). As shown in Fig. 1A (lanes 3 and 4), no protein bands were detected in these controls. The V180D mutant was expressed in PC12 cells at a level similar to the wild type protein (Supplemental Fig. S2 and Fig. 1B, arrow) and appeared to have a structural fold similar to the wild type protein as judged by its ability to form heterodimers with the endogenous wild type 14-3-3 subunits (β, γ, ϵ, ζ, η, and θ isoforms, as analyzed by SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS; see Fig. 1B and data not shown). Thus, we assumed that the proteomic procedure using a MEF tag would yield specific targets of 14-3-3 proteins in PC12 cells. In fact, we found that many known targets of 14-3-3 proteins, including IRS1 and 2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase class 1, Wee-1, KSR-1, A-raf, B-raf, C-raf, Cdc25C, KHC, KLC2, PFK-2 and tyrosine hydroxylase, were simultaneously isolated by this procedure as revealed by Western blot analyses (data not shown). To identify the proteins recovered by the procedure described above, silver-stained bands were excised from the gel, digested in the gel by Lys-C, and analyzed by a direct nanoflow LC-MS/MS system (32.Natsume T. Yamauchi Y. Nakayama H. Shinkawa T. Yanagida M. Takahashi N. Isobe T. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4725-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This procedure identified more than 100 individual proteins, of which ∼40 were known and ∼60 were unknown targets of 14-3-3 (data not shown), including hNedd4-2 reported here. The identification of hNedd4-2 was based on six independent MS/MS spectra derived from six doubly charged peptide ions, each corresponding to the unique amino acid sequence within KIAA0439 (Supplemental Table S1). Western blotting using Nedd4 antibodies confirmed that the protein preparation contained hNedd4-2 (Fig. 1C, arrow), whereas another member of the Nedd4 family, Nedd4–1 (11.Kamynina E. Debonneville C. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Staub O. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), was not detected in this study (data not shown). We confirmed that the 14-3-3η/hNedd4-2 complex was endogenous to PC12 cells because the immunoprecipitate pulled down from the cell extract with anti-Nedd4 contained endogenous 14-3-3η (Fig. 1D), and a number of 14-3-3 isoforms other than η, such as β, γ, ϵ, and θ, also formed a complex with hNedd4-2 (Fig. 1E). 14-3-3 Binds hNedd4-2 Phosphorylated by Sgk1 Kinase— Previous studies showed that Nedd4-2 is a substrate of Sgk1 kinase (18.Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C. Chraibi A. Pratt J.H. Horisberger J.D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7052-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 19.Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Because 14-3-3 binds phosphorylated targets in most known cases, we examined whether the interaction between 14-3-3η and hNedd4-2 depends on the Sgk1-mediated phosphorylation of hNedd4-2. A GST-hNedd4-2 fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified protein was assayed for 14-3-3 binding before and after phosphorylation by Sgk1 kinase. As shown in Fig. 2A (lanes 4 and 6, bottom panel), the phosphorylated form of GST-hNedd4-2 bound directly to 14-3-3η, whereas the nonphosphorylated protein did not. Sgk1 phosphorylates X. laevis Nadd4–2 at Ser-444 and, to a lesser extent, at Ser-338, thereby inhibiting the interaction of xNedd4-2 with ENaC (18.Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C. Chraibi A. Pratt J.H. Horisberger J.D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7052-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The Xenopus Nedd4-2 Ser-444 and Ser-338 residues correspond to hNedd4-2 Ser-468 and Ser-362, respectively. We found that both of these residues are highly conserved among Nedd4-2 homologs in various species, and interestingly, the sequence surrounding Ser-468 in hNedd4-2 matches the reported consensus sequence motif required for binding to 14-3-3 (RXXpSXP; Supplemental Table S2). Thus, we prepared a point mutant of hNedd4-2 that replaces Ser-468 with Ala (termed hNedd-S468A) to examine whether the mutant could bind 14-3-3η. As shown in Fig. 2A (lanes 5 and 7), the hNedd-S468A mutant was phosphorylated by Sgk1, possibly at Ser-362 (see middle panel), but did not bind 14-3-3η in either the phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated form (bottom panel). Thus, 14-3-3 selectively binds hNedd4-2 only when the protein is phosphorylated at Ser-468. To examine further whether the hNedd4-2/14-3-3 interaction is physiologically relevant, we prepared HEK293 cells"

However, most cross-links of the Maillard reaction described so far are present in quantities too low to account for these changes. Here we have determined in human skin and glomerular basement membrane (GBM) collagen the levels of the recently discovered lysine-arginine cross-links derived from glucose, methylglyoxal, glyoxal, and 3-deoxyglucosone, i.e. glucosepane, MODIC, GODIC, and DOGDIC, respectively. Insoluble preparations of skin collagen (n = 110) and glomerular basement membrane (GBM, n = 28) were enzymatically digested, and levels were measured by isotope dilution technique using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. In skin, all cross-links increased with age (p < 0.0001) except DOGDIC (p = 0.34). In nondiabetic controls, levels at 90 years were 2000, 30, and 15 pmol/mg for glucosepane, MODIC, and GODIC, respectively. Diabetes, but not renal failure, increased glucosepane to 5000 pmol/mg (p < 0.0001), and for all others, increased it to <60 pmol/mg (p < 0.01). In GBMs, glucosepane reached up to 500 pmol/mg of collagen and was increased in diabetes (p < 0.0001) but not old age. In conclusion, glucosepane is the single major cross-link of the senescent extracellular matrix discovered so far, accounting for up to >120 mole% of triple helical collagen modification in diabetes.

Reducing sugars react nonenzymatically with proteins to form adducts and cross-links referred to as advanced glycation end products (1.Monnier V.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 419: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Their accumulation is particularly high in long-lived proteins, such as lens crystallins and collagen, and results in intra- and intermolecular cross-linking. The latter has been hypothesized to result in an age- and diabetes-related stiffening of collagenous tissues and is believed to play an important role in the etiology of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (3.Peppa M. Uribarri J. Vlassara H. Curr. Diab. Rep. 2004; 4: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) as well as the loss of elasticity in lungs, joints, and skin (4.DeVita P. Hortobagyi T. J. Gerontol. Biol. Sci. 2000; 55A: B593-B600Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5.Lai-Fook S.J. Hyatt R.E. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6.Sumino H. Ichikawa S. Abe M. Endo Y. Ishikawa O. Kurabayashi M. J. Am. Geriatr. Soc. 2004; 52: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These age-related processes are markedly accelerated by diabetes and are associated with morbidity and mortality in diabetic individuals (7.Takekoshi H. Kitamura S. Matsuoka K. Atsumi Y. Horiuchi A.

Med. 1996; 24: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In skin, protein cross-linking is associated with an age-related loss of elasticity, increased stiffening, and wrinkling (9.Fazio M.J. Olsen D.R. Uitto J.J. Cutis. 1989; 43: 437-444PubMed Google Scholar). However, this process occurs ubiquitously with age, suggesting a fundamental underlying mechanism. Although most of the age-related changes in the extracellular matrix could be duplicated by incubating reducing sugars with proteins, Eble et al. (10.Eble A.S. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9406-9412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the major cross-links are not stable to conventional conditions of acid hydrolysis. Indeed, Biemel et al. (11.Biemel K.M. Friedl D.A. Lederer M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24907-24915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) recently showed that glucose and sugar-derived dicarbonyl intermediates react with human serum albumin to form various acid-labile lysine-arginine cross-links, such as the 1,4-dideoxy-5,6-glucosone-derivedglucosepaneandthemethylglyoxal-, glyoxal-, and 3-deoxyglucosone-derived imidazolium cross-links MODIC, 1The abbreviations used are: MODIC, methylglyoxal-derived imidazolium cross-link; GODIC, glyoxal-derived imidazolium cross-link; DOGDIC, 3-deoxyglucosone-derived imidazolium cross-link; DOGDIC-Ox, oxidized 3-deoxyglucosone-derived imidazolium cross-link; GBM, glomerular basement membrane; ESRD, end-stage renal disease; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; NS, not significant. GODIC, and DOGDIC, respectively (Fig. 1). An oxidized form of DOGDIC (DOGDIC-Ox) was also described (Fig. 1). Glucosepane was found in insoluble human lens protein, reaching levels of 250 pmol/mg of protein in some nondiabetic subjects (11.Biemel K.M. Friedl D.A. Lederer M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24907-24915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Levels of the other cross-links were present in much lower quantities, i.e. <75 pmol/mg for MODIC and <5 pmol/mg for GODIC and DOGDIC. In the present research, these cross-links were measured as a function of age in enzymatically digested human skin collagen and glomerular basement membrane (GBM) from both nondiabetic and diabetic subjects with and without renal failure or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Donor Tissue Information—Human skin and GBM were obtained as described previously (2.Sell D.R. Carlson E.C. Monnier V.M. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) at autopsy from a total of n = 110 individuals of which n = 65 and n = 45 were of the Caucasian and African-American race, respectively. There were n = 56 males and n = 54 females. A total of n = 29 samples of GBM were used from the previous study (2.Sell D.R. Carlson E.C. Monnier V.M. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All samples were stored frozen in dry form at –80 °C. Diagnoses of diabetes, renal disease, and other major pathologies and cause of death were obtained from the medical and anatomical records of each patient at autopsy. Preparation of Insoluble Collagen—Insoluble collagen was prepared as detailed previously (2.Sell D.R. Carlson E.C. Monnier V.M. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 12.Sell D.R. Kleinman N.R. Monnier V.M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In brief, samples were delipidated, extracted with 1 m sodium chloride and 0.5 m acetic acid, digested with 0.1% pepsin in 0.5 m acetic acid at 4 °C, and freeze-dried (2.Sell D.R. Carlson E.C. Monnier V.M. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Enzymatic Digestion of Insoluble Collagen—Approximately 5 mg of the freeze-dried pellet of insoluble skin or GBM was washed twice with 1-ml portions of buffer H (0.02 m HEPES and 0.1 m calcium chloride at pH 7.5; Sigma). The pellet was sequentially digested at 37 °C for 24-h consecutive intervals by the addition of the following enzymes in buffer H: 140 units of collagenase in 500 μl (Sigma); 118 mU of peptidase in 25 μl (Sigma); 1 unit of Pronase in 50 μl (Roche Applied Science); and 0.2 unit of aminopeptidase M in 10 μl (Roche Applied Science). Chloroform and toluene (1.5 μl) were added to every tube as antimicrobial agents. Digestion efficiency was determined by the ninhydrin reaction (13.Moore S. Stein W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 211: 907-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed as the percentage of total leucine equivalents assayed in the hydrolysate. Digestibility varied from 100 to 41%, showing an inverse relationship with age (r = –0.19, p = 0.028). Quantitative Analyses—The cross-links were determined in the digests as detailed by Biemel et al. (11.Biemel K.M. Friedl D.A. Lederer M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24907-24915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In short, samples (20 μl) were injected into an HP1100 (Agilent Technologies) HPLC system coupled to a Micromass (Waters Ltd., Manchester, UK) VG platform II quadru-pole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray interface and a 150 × 4.6 mm YMC-Pack Pro C18 column at flow rates of 1 ml/min. Gradient separations consisted of water and methanol combinations using n-heptafluorobutyric acid as the ion-pairing agent (11.Biemel K.M. Friedl D.A. Lederer M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24907-24915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A post-column addition of propionic acid/2-propanol (3 + 1, v/v) in a 1:3 ratio with the HPLC mobile phase was performed with a Knauer WellChrom Maxi-Star K-1000 HPLC pump. The mass spectrometer parameters have previously been detailed by Biemel et al. (11.Biemel K.M. Friedl D.A. Lederer M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24907-24915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The quantification of the two isomers of DOGDIC-Ox (Fig. 1) was performed using 13C6-DOGDIC as the internal standard. Statistical Analyses—Statistical methods including regression, correlation, and analysis of variance were performed as described previously by us (12.Sell D.R. Kleinman N.R. Monnier V.M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14.Sell D.R. Lane M.A. Obrenovich M.E. Mattison J.A. Handy A. Ingram D.K. Cutler R.G. Roth G.S. Monnier V.M. J. Gerontol. Biol.

Race, gender, presence of diabetes (type 1 and type 2), chronic renal disease, and ESRD were independent variables (16.Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21597-21602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Effect of Age—Glucosepane significantly (p < 0.0001) increased with age in nondiabetic subjects without renal failure, reaching surprisingly high levels of nearly 2000 pmol/mg of collagen at 90 years of age (Fig. 2A). Levels of MODIC, GODIC, and DOGDIC-Ox also significantly (p < 0.05) increased with age; however, they reached only about 30, 15, and 7 pmol/mg of collagen at age 90 years, respectively (Table I, Fig. 3, A, B, and D). DOGDIC reached ∼14 pmol/mg of collagen but did not increase with age (Table I, Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the increased formation of DOGDIC-Ox correlated (r = 0.56, p < 0.0001) with an apparent decrease of DOGDIC, suggesting an enhanced oxidative medium in skin collagen (data not shown).Table ISpearman correlation coefficients (r) of measured skin collagen cross-links with age, diabetes, and renal failureRenal failureaRenal failure is individuals with either chronic renal failure (CRF) or ESRD as previously defined (2).Cross-linkAgebDoes not include diabetes and renal failure.DiabetesNondiabeticDiabeticcorr.

Glucosepane was elevated in many diabetic subjects far above the 95% confidence interval for controls reaching up to ∼4500 pmol/mg of collagen (Fig. 2B). MODIC, GODIC, DOGDIC, and DOGDIC-Ox were also increased by diabetes reaching up to 55, 27, 32, and 9 pmol/mg of collagen, respectively (Fig. 3, A–D). Glucosepane (p = 0.001), MODIC (p = 0.041), and GODIC (p = 0.049) also increased with age in diabetics but not DOGDIC (p = 0.96) and DOGDIC-Ox (p = 0.22). Effect of Renal Failure—Multiple regression and analysis of variance analyses showed that renal failure (p > 0.20) had no effect on cross-link levels in both nondiabetic (p > 0.20) and diabetic (p > 0.13) subjects (Table I). However, since MODIC and GODIC tended to be higher in diabetic subjects with ESRD, the separate effects of ESRD were investigated. Analysis of variance revealed that ESRD was significant for MODIC (p = 0.018), GODIC (p = 0.015) but only if untransformed data were used. Effect of Race and Gender—Race had no effect (p > 0.46) and therefore was deleted from subsequent analyses. Surprisingly, however, gender had a significant effect for both glucosepane (p = 0.013) and GODIC (p = 0.032) with diabetic females having higher levels than males by 62% for glucosepane (1933 versus 1191 pmol/mg of collagen) and 38% for GODIC (11.3 versus 8.2 pmol/mg of collagen). The Mann-Whitney test showed that the difference is statistically significant for both glucosepane (p = 0.044) and GODIC (p = 0.036). Lysine-Arginine Cross-links in Glomerular Basement Membranes—Glucosepane, MODIC, GODIC, and DOGDIC reached upward levels of ∼500, 60, 80, and 20 pmol/mg of collagen in GBM from nondiabetic donors, respectively (Fig. 4, A–D). However, as observed previously for pentosidine (2.Sell D.R. Carlson E.C. Monnier V.M. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), levels were in a steady state and did not increase with age (p > 0.05). Glucosepane was significantly (p < 0.0001) elevated by diabetes reaching levels over 900 pmol/mg of collagen in one patient (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, for the other cross-links (Fig. 4, B–D), diabetes did not elevate levels (p > 0.05). Estimated Contribution of the Amadori Product to Glucosepane Formation in Skin Collagen—Amadori products in skin collagen were estimated by the furosine method, assuming a 30% yield from acid hydrolysis (17.Erbersdobler H.F.

Assuming glucosepane forms according to the mechanism depicted in Fig. 1, the percentage of conversion of Amadori product into glucospane was determined as a function of age. As shown in Fig. 5A, this percentage increased with age (p < 0.0001), reaching 43 ± 16% (S.D.) of the Amadori product at age 80 years. This percentage reached 53% in patients with type 2 diabetes and ESRD (p = 0.024, Fig. 5B). Indeed, most data points for these patients lay outside the confidence intervals for controls (Fig. 5B). This suggests the existence of factors that either selectively catalyze glucosepane formation or impair the turnover rate of the collagen matrix. In the present study, the nonfluorescent glucosepane levels increased up to ∼2 nmol/mg of collagen in old nondiabetic controls and further increased up to 4.3 nmol/mg of collagen in certain diabetic individuals (Fig. 2). This latter level represents about 1–1.2% (mol/mol) modifications in arginine and lysine residues, respectively. Assuming a molecular mass of 100,000 kDa for a single strand of triple helical collagen, this translates into approximately one cross-link for every two and five collagen molecules in diabetic and nondiabetic individuals, respectively. This result is much higher than that estimated for the number of pentosidine cross-links in cartilage by Verzijl et al. (18.Verzijl N. Degroot J. Oldehinkel E. Bank R.A. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Bayliss M.T. Bijlsma J.W. Lafeber F.P. Tekoppele J.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), i.e. one cross-link/20 molecules of collagen. Surprisingly, this degree of cross-linking is within range of the lysyl oxidase-derived physiological cross-links where levels reach 1–5 mole/mole of collagen in skin (19.Buckingham B. Reiser K.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 86: 1046-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The latter, however, do not increase with age (20.Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. Masoro E.J. Handbook of Physiology, Section II: Aging. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 235-305Google Scholar, 21.Bailey A.J. Paul R.G. Knott L. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1998; 106: 1-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Furthermore, from the results of Vater et al. (22.Vater C.A. Harris J.E.D. Siegel R.C. Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), it is estimated that this amount of cross-linking induced by glucosepane should impose between a 30- and 45- fold decrease in collagen digestibility in diabetic skin. In this study, substantial differences were noted in absolute levels of glucosepane between skin collagen versus GBM for both nondiabetic and diabetic individuals (Fig. 2 versus Fig. 4). Specimens were not from the same individual and are therefore not directly comparable. However, the most likely explanation for the differences in glucosepane levels is from differences in collagen turnover. First, although direct comparative measurements between skin and GBM are not available, work by Cohen and Surma (23.Cohen M.P. Surma M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1767-1770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that rat GBM turnover rate is as rapid as that of salt soluble Type I collagen, which is notoriously poorly cross-linked. Another report suggests both GBM and tendon collagen turnover are at least greater than 100 days (24.Price R.G. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8597-8602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although our data are compatible with higher turnover of GBM than skin, precise measurements are needed. Second, the extent of glycation of long-lived proteins such as collagen is in the equilibrium or steady-state relationship to ambient glucose concentration and further modulated by turnover (25.Baynes J.W. Watkins N.G. Fisher C.I. Hull J.C. Patrick J.S. Ahmed M.U. Dunn J.A. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Monnier V.M. The Maillard Reaction in Aging, Diabetes and Nutrition. A. R.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39027-39031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). In that regard, the extent of glycation (Amadori product) is lower in GBM when compared with tendon, aortic, and skin collagen (29.Kohn R.R. Schnider S.L. Diabetes. 1982; 31: 47-51Crossref Google Scholar, 30.Schleicher E. Wieland O.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 884: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Additionally, levels modestly but significantly increased with age in nondiabetic human skin collagen (26.Dunn J.A. McCance D.R. Thorpe S.R. Lyons T.J. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) but not GBM (31.Garlick R.L. Bunn H.F. Spiro R.G. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GBM in the diabetic milieu undergoes increased collagen synthesis and thickening, which in itself will affect turnover (30.Schleicher E. Wieland O.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 884: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32.Brownlee M. Spiro R.G. Diabetes. 1979; 28: 121-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Brownlee M. Spiro R.G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1979; 124: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Third, similar to the current study, previous work with the pentosidine cross-link showed that levels increased exponentially to over 90 pmol/mg of collagen at age 90 years in nondiabetic skin collagen, whereas levels increased asymptotically to less than 50 pmol/mg, plateauing between the ages of 50–60 years in GBM from nondiabetics (2.Sell D.R. Carlson E.C. Monnier V.M. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, these results further support the notion that GBM turns over at a faster rate when compared with skin. Indeed, Verzjil et al. (28.Verzijl N. DeGroot J. Thorpe S.R. Bank R.A. Shaw J.N. Lyons T.J. Bijlsma J.W. Lafeber F.P. Baynes J.W. TeKoppele J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39027-39031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) determined the half-life of human skin collagen to be 15 years, although GBM was not studied. The larger accumulation of glucosepane in skin collagen versus lens crystallins at late age, i.e. ∼2000 (Fig. 2A) versus 250 pmol/mg of protein (11.Biemel K.M. Friedl D.A. Lederer M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24907-24915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), is intriguing and may be due to the high concentration of methylglyoxal found in lens (34.Ahmed N. Thornalley P.J. Dawczynski J. Franke S. Strobel J. Stein G. Haik G.M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 5287-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), which most likely competes with glucose for available modification sites. Indeed, the primary source of methylglyoxal is intracellular metabolism (35.Schalkwijk C.G. Stehouwer C.D. Hinsbergh V.W.v. Diabetes-Metab. Res. Rev. 2004; 2004: 369-382Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In contrast, although not measured directly, methylglyoxal levels in extracellular matrix would be expected to be relatively lower as assessed by the low levels of methylglyoxal found in blood versus lens in normal healthy human subjects, i.e. ∼80 versus 2000 nm (34.Ahmed N. Thornalley P.J. Dawczynski J. Franke S. Strobel J. Stein G. Haik G.M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 5287-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In support, levels of the methylglyoxal-lysine dimer cross-link have also been found lower in nondiabetic human skin collagen versus lens, i.e. 0.38 versus 0.8 mmol/mol of lysine at ages 85 and 70 years, respectively (36.Brinkmann Frye E.B. Degenhardt T.P. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). An additional observation in this study is that GBM levels of MODIC, GODIC, and DOGDIC did not increase with age in diabetes (Fig. 4, B–D), although such levels did increase in the skin with diabetes and aging (Fig. 3, A–C). In a recent study measuring various antioxidant effects in diabetic and control rats (37.Mustata G.T. Rosca M. Biemel K.M. Reihl O. Smith M.A. Viswanathan A. Strauch C. Du Y. Tang J. Kern T.S. Lederer M.O. Brownlee M. Weiss M.F. Monnier V.M. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), levels of these ODIC cross-links were found to be a mirror image of glucosepane formation in tendon collagen, thereby strongly suggesting that glucosepane and the ODIC cross-links compete for the same modification sites on the collagen molecule, explaining why the much more predominant glucosepane masks the minor cross-links. The above results also suggest that glucosepane is strongly correlated with the Amadori product in skin collagen and agree with the nonoxidative mechanism of glucosepane formation henceforth proposed by Biemel et al. (11.Biemel K.M. Friedl D.A. Lederer M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24907-24915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). If furosine levels measured in these samples are considered (data not shown), and assuming a 30% yield of furosine from the Amadori product, it is estimated that as much as 50–60% of the steady state levels of Amadori product is converted into glucosepane at old age. The conversion is also significantly increased due to ESRD (p = 0.024), but not diabetes alone, possibly because of decreased turnover rate of collagen in ESRD. The largest level of any specific advanced glycation end product measured in tissues so far has been the hydroimidazolones of methylglyoxal (34.Ahmed N. Thornalley P.J. Dawczynski J. Franke S. Strobel J. Stein G. Haik G.M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 5287-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Both glucosepane and the hydroimidazolones involve arginine residues and are unstable to acid hydrolysis (11.Biemel K.M. Friedl D.A. Lederer M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24907-24915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 38.Ahmed N. Argirov O.K. Minhas H.S. Cordeiro C.A.A. Thornalley P.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In lens proteins, levels of the hydroimidazolone MG-H1 progressively increased with age, reaching nearly 14 nmol/mg of protein in old age (34.Ahmed N. Thornalley P.J. Dawczynski J. Franke S. Strobel J. Stein G. Haik G.M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 5287-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), whereas glucosepane reached only 250 pmol/mg of protein in old age (11.Biemel K.M. Friedl D.A. Lederer M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24907-24915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In contrast, the recently reported fluorescent lysine-lysine “K2P” cross-link reached 400 pmol/mg of lens protein and up to 1400 pmol/mg of protein in one brunescent lens sample (39.Cheng R. Feng Q. Argirov O.K. Ortwerth B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45441-45449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Neither the hydroimidazolones nor K2P have been determined in collagen. Thus, glucosepane is a relatively minor cross-link in lens but a major cross-link in collagen. It is intriguing to speculate that the high levels of the reversible methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolones may actually protect the lens crystallins from irreversible glucosepane-mediated damage. An important question in diabetology is what role and extent does oxidative stress play in the diabetic milieu and its complications (40.Baynes J.W. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 41.Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar). Wells-Knecht et al. (42.Wells-Knecht M.C. Lyons T.J. McCance D.R. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) reported previously that the age-dependent increase of two specific markers for oxidative stress in skin collagen, i.e. ortho-tyrosine and methionine sulfoxide, was surprisingly not accelerated by diabetes. However, in the present study, DOGDIC-Ox, also a marker for oxidative stress, was significantly elevated by diabetes (Table I, Fig. 3D). The apparent discrepancy may relate to differences in patient cohorts. Although the former study used a small sample size of diabetic individuals (n = 12–17), a much larger number of subjects, some of which had severe complications, were included in this study (Table I). Finally, levels of glucosepane and GODIC were found highly elevated in elderly postmenopausal women with diabetes (p < 0.05, data not shown). The reason for the observed gender effect is not immediately apparent from this study. However, postmenopausal diabetic women are more at risk for cardiovascular disease, particularly coronary heart disease, an observation that has been well known for many years of uncertain etiology (43.Kessler I.I.

Harnack L. Halliwell B. Jacobs Jr., D.R. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2004; 80: 1194-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was reported that the treatment of female rats with estradiol for 1 year attenuated the age-related increase in stiffening, glycoxidation, and permeability in carotid arteries (49.Mullick A.E. Walsh B.A. Reiser K.M. Rutledge J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2204-H2210PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest an inverse relationship between hormonal status and collagen cross-linking, a link suggested many years ago from the work of Everitt and associates using hypophysectomized rats (50.Everitt A.V. Delbridge L. Exp. Gerontol. 1972; 7: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 51.Everitt A.V. Wyndham J.R. Barnard D.L. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1983; 22: 233-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In summary, this study reveals that glucosepane is the single major cross-link discovered to date in senescent human skin collagen and collagen from diabetic individuals, accounting for up to 120 mol% modification of triple-stranded helical collagen. It is also present in substantial quantities in GBM, although in a steady state. Its levels might be sufficient to contribute to the loss of digestibility of collagen in diabetes and aging. In fact, since at most 80% of old human collagen could be enzymatically digested, glucosepane levels could be even higher. The extent to which glucosepane is actually responsible for matrix stiffening and impairment of biologically critical arginine residues in the RGD sequences remains to be determined. From a pharmacological viewpoint, aminoguanidine was found to block the reaction sites on the 5,6-dioxo precursor compound (52.Reihl O. Biemel K.M. Lederer M.O. Schwack W. Carbohydr. Res. 2004; 339: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggesting that the reported improvement in collagen solubility in diabetic animals receiving this drug (53.Brownlee M. Vlassara H.

https://openalex.org/W1975475567,"Human tumors frequently exhibit constitutively activated Ras signaling, which contributes to the malignant phenotype. Mounting evidence suggests unique roles of the Ras family members, H-Ras, N-Ras and K-Ras, in normal and pathological conditions. In an effort to dissect distinct Ras isoform-specific functions in malignant phenotypic changes, we previously established H-Ras- and N-Ras-activated MCF10A human breast epithelial cell lines. Using these, we showed that p38 kinase is a key signaling molecule differentially regulated between H-Ras and N-Ras, leading to H-Ras-specific induction of invasive and migrative phenotypes. The present study is to further investigate H-Ras- and N-Ras-mediated signaling pathways and to unveil how these pathways are integrated for regulation of invasive/migrative phenotypic conversion of human breast epithelial cells. Here we report that the Rac-MAPK kinase (MKK)3/6-p38 pathway is a unique signaling pathway activated by H-Ras, leading to the invasive/migrative phenotype. In contrast, Raf-MEK-ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathways, which are fundamental to proliferation and differentiation, are activated by both H-Ras and N-Ras. A significant role for p38 in cell invasion is further supported by the observation that p38 activation by MKK6 transfection is sufficient to induce invasive and migrative phenotypes in MCF10A cells. Activation of the MKK6-p38 pathway results in a marked induction of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, whereas it had little effect on MMP-9, suggesting MMP-2 up-regulation by MKK6-p38 pathway as a key step for H-Ras-induced invasion and migration. We also provide evidence for cross-talk among the Rac, Raf, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways critical for regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and invasive phenotype. Taken together, the present study elucidated the role of the Rac-MKK3/6-p38 pathway leading to H-Ras-specific induction of malignant progression in breast epithelial cells, providing implications for developing therapeutic strategies for mammary carcinoma to target Ras downstream signaling molecules required for malignant cancer cell behavior but less critical for normal cell functions."
https://openalex.org/W2168900836,"Head formation requires simultaneous inhibition of multiple caudalizing signals during early vertebrate embryogenesis. We identified a novel antagonist against Wnt and FGF signaling for head formation, Shisa, which functions cell autonomously in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Shisa is specifically expressed in the prospective head ectoderm and the Spemann organizer of Xenopus gastrulae. Overexpression of Shisa inhibited both Wnt and FGF signaling in Xenopus embryos and in a cell line. Loss of Shisa function sensitized the neuroectoderm to Wnt signaling and suppressed head formation during gastrulation. Shisa physically interacted with immature forms of the Wnt receptor Frizzled and the FGF receptor within the ER and inhibited their posttranslational maturation and trafficking to the cell surface. Taken together, these findings indicate that Shisa is a novel molecule that controls head formation by regulating the establishment of the receptors for caudalizing factors."
https://openalex.org/W1993439431,"Statins are widely used hypocholesterolemic drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway whose biosynthetic end product is cholesterol. In addition to lowering circulating cholesterol, statins perturb the composition of cell membranes, resulting in disruption of lipid rafts, which function as signaling platforms in immunoreceptor signaling. Furthermore, by inhibiting protein prenylation, a process also dependent on mevalonate, statins block membrane targeting and hence activity of small GTPases, which control multiple pathways triggered by these receptors. T-cell activation is crucially dependent on Ras, Rho and Rab GTPases. Furthermore TCR signaling is orchestrated at lipid rafts, identifying T-cells as potential cellular targets of statins. Here we report that simvastatin suppresses T-cell activation and proliferation as the result of its capacity to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase. T-cell treatment with simvastatin does not affect intracellular cholesterol levels or raft integrity nor, accordingly, the initial tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent cascade. Conversely, inhibition of protein prenylation by simvastatin results in a dramatic impairment in the pathways regulated by small GTPases, including the Ras/MAP kinase pathway, the Rac/stress kinase pathway, and the Rab-dependent pathway of receptor endocytosis. The results identify Ras superfamily GTPases as strategic molecular targets in T-cell immunosuppression by statins."

The activation of carboxylic acids is required in numerous metabolic pathways of all organisms and contributes to the biosynthesis or degradation of diverse compounds such as fatty acids, amino acids, and a variety of secondary metabolites. Despite the structural diversity of their substrates, many enzymes acting on carboxylic acids utilize the same ATP-dependent two-step mechanism. The first step is characterized by the formation of an acyl-AMP intermediate, the so-called adenylate, with concomitant release of pyrophosphate (Reaction 1). Acid+ATP→acyl−AMP+PPi (Eq. 1) In the second step, the acyl group is transferred to an ultimate acceptor, which in most cases is CoA, and AMP is released (Reaction 2). Acyl−AMP+CoA→acyl−CoA+AMP (Eq. 2) A large number of enzymes catalyzing the above reaction sequence are characterized by the presence of a highly conserved putative AMP-binding domain (PROSITE PS00455), and in fact, this sequence motif has been used to group diverse proteins such as fatty acyl-CoA synthetases, acetyl-CoA synthetases, 4-coumarate:CoA ligases, chlorobenzoate:CoA ligase, nonribosomal polypeptide synthetases, and firefly luciferases in one superfamily of adenylate-forming enzymes (1.Fulda M.

For some members of the latter group, the ATP-dependent in vitro adenylation of the plant hormones jasmonic acid (JA), 1The abbreviations used are: JA, jasmonic acid; IAA, indole-3-acetic acid; MeJA, methyl jasmonate; 4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; LACS, long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase; OPDA, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid; OPC-8:0, 3-oxo-2-(2′-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid; OPC-6:0, 3-oxo-2-(2′-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-hexanoic acid; OPR-3, OPDA reductase-3; SBP, substrate-binding pocket; PTS1, peroxisomal targeting signal type 1; IBA, indole-butyric acid; RFP, red fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; MS, mass spectrometry; WT, wild type; RT, reverse transcriptase. 1The abbreviations used are: JA, jasmonic acid; IAA, indole-3-acetic acid; MeJA, methyl jasmonate; 4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; LACS, long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase; OPDA, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid; OPC-8:0, 3-oxo-2-(2′-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid; OPC-6:0, 3-oxo-2-(2′-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-hexanoic acid; OPR-3, OPDA reductase-3; SBP, substrate-binding pocket; PTS1, peroxisomal targeting signal type 1; IBA, indole-butyric acid; RFP, red fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; MS, mass spectrometry; WT, wild type; RT, reverse transcriptase. salicylic acid, or indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) has been demonstrated, and hence a function in hormone signaling was inferred (3.Staswick P.E. Tiryaki I. Rowe M.L. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1405-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that one enzyme of this group, called JAR1, functions as a JA-amino acid synthetase conjugating activated JA with isoleucine, and genetic evidence supports the notion that JA-Ile is indeed an essential component of jasmonate signaling in Arabidopsis (5.Staswick P.E. Tiryaki I. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2117-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). In contrast to JA, amino acid conjugates of IAA have been known for a long time, but the enzymes responsible for their biosynthesis have not yet been reported. Among the 44 Arabidopsis proteins containing the consensus AMP-binding domain, several fatty acyl-CoA synthetases differing in chain length specificity and cellular localization, four 4-coumarate:CoA ligases (4CLs), and one acetyl-CoA synthetase have been identified, but the function of the remaining enzymes is still unknown (4.Shockey J.M.

Two of the nine long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetases (LACS) present in Arabidopsis, LACS6 and LACS7, represent peroxisomal enzymes that are essential for storage lipid mobilization during germination (12.Fulda M. Shockey J. Werber M. Wolter F.P. Heinz E. Plant J. 2002; 32: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 13.Fulda M. Schnurr J. Abbadi A. Heinz E. Browse J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Hence a lacs6 lacs7 double mutant requires exogenous sucrose for germination and seedling development (13.Fulda M. Schnurr J. Abbadi A. Heinz E. Browse J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), a phenotype also described for the Arabidopsis pxa1 mutant and other mutants defective in β-oxidation (14.Zolman B.K. Silva I.D. Bartel B. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1266-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 15.Hayashi M. Toriyama K. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 183-196PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Germain V. Plant J. 2001; 28: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The PXA1 protein is an ATP-binding cassette transporter located in the peroxisomal membrane and considered to import long-chain fatty acid CoA esters for β-oxidation from the cytosol (14.Zolman B.K. Silva I.D. Bartel B. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1266-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The observation that the pxa1 mutant and the lacs6 lacs7 double mutant are compromised in the mobilization of storage lipids indicates that both activated and free fatty acids are imported into peroxisomes and that peroxisomal LACS activity is essential for plant β-oxidation to support early seedling growth (13.Fulda M. Schnurr J. Abbadi A. Heinz E. Browse J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Plant peroxisomes are involved in a variety of oxidative processes such as the β-oxidation of fatty acids to produce acetyl-CoA, the metabolism of glycolate formed during photorespiration, and the catabolism of aliphatic amino acids (17.Graham I.A. Eastmond P.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 156-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 18.Lange P.R. Eastmond P.J. Madagan K. Graham I.A.

In addition, peroxisomal enzymes contribute to the formation and turnover of signaling molecules such as nitric oxide and H2O2 (20.Corpas F.J. Barroso J.B. del Rio L.A. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 145-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and to the biosynthesis of the plant hormones IAA and JA (21.Zolman B.K. Yoder A. Bartel B. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1323-1337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Stintzi A. Browse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10625-10630Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 23.Bartel B.

Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Analogous to the mammalian eicosanoid pathway, the biosynthesis of JA in Arabidopsis occurs via the octadecanoic pathway starting from linolenic acid (18:3) or, alternatively, via the hexadecanoid pathway starting from hexadecatrienoic acid (16:3) (25.Weber H. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 217-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 26.Turner J.G. Ellis C. Devoto A. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: S153-S164Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). In leaves, these polyunsaturated fatty acids may be released from the membrane lipids of the chloroplast by phospholipases functionally related to DAD1 (27.Ishiguro S. Kawai-Oda A. Ueda J. Nishida I. Okada K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2191-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), and in subsequent steps, they are converted to the cyclopentenones 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) or dinor-OPDA, respectively, by the enzymes lipoxygenase, allene oxide synthase, and allene-oxide cyclase (25.Weber H. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 217-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 28.Stenzel I. Hause B. Miersch O. Kurz T. Maucher H. Weichert H. Ziegler J. Feussner I.

Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). OPDA may then be re-esterified to plastid-specific galactolipids (30.Stelmach B.A. Müller A. Hennig P. Gebhardt S. Schubert-Zsilavecz M. Weiler E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12832-12838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) or may be released from the chloroplast and function as a signal molecule mediating mechanotransductory processes or plant defense responses (30.Stelmach B.A. Müller A.

Browse J. Farmer E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12837-12842Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). For conversion to JA, OPDA or an OPDA derivative has to be translocated into peroxisomes where it is reduced to 3-oxo-2-(2′-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid (OPC-8:0) by OPDA reductase-3 (OPR-3), the action of which is followed by three rounds of β-oxidation (22.Stintzi A. Browse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10625-10630Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 25.Weber H.

This sequence of β-oxidative steps is indicated by the fact that only even-numbered carboxylic acid side chains of OPC derivatives led to JA biosynthesis (34.Miersch O. Wasternack C. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast to all other steps of JA biosynthesis, enzymes participating in these β-oxidative reactions of JA precursors have not yet been identified or characterized. Four isoforms of 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL) have been identified in Arabidopsis, which presumably constitute the complete enzyme family (6.Ehlting J. Büttner D. Wang Q. Douglas C.J. Somssich I.E. Kombrink E. Plant J. 1999; 19: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 9.Hamberger B. Hahlbrock K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2209-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Typically, 4CLs activate 4-coumaric, caffeic, and ferulic acid to the corresponding CoA esters. These activated cinnamic acid derivatives serve as precursors for the biosynthesis of numerous plant secondary compounds such as flavonoids, isoflavonoids, coumarins, lignin, suberin, anthocyanins, and wall-bound phenolics, which have essential functions in plant development and environmental interactions (35.Douglas C.J. Trends Plant Sci. 1996; 1: 171-178Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 36.Weisshaar B. Jenkins G.I. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the four Arabidopsis 4CL isoforms exhibit distinct substrate utilization profiles that may be related to specific metabolic functions (6.Ehlting J. Büttner D. Wang Q. Douglas C.J. Somssich I.E. Kombrink E. Plant J. 1999; 19: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). By detailed biochemical characterization of At4CL2, a naturally occurring loss-of-function mutant that is incapable of converting ferulic acid, and homology modeling of its substrate-binding pocket (SBP), we uncovered the substrate specificity-determining amino acid code of 4CLs (37.Schneider K. Hövel K. Witzel K. Hamberger B. Schomburg D. Kombrink E. Stuible H.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8601-8606Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This specificity code allowed the rational design of At4CL2 variants with new catalytic properties, including the capacity to activate ferulic, sinapic, and cinnamic acid, substrates not normally converted by the At4CL2 wild-type enzyme (37.Schneider K. Hövel K. Witzel K. Hamberger B. Schomburg D. Kombrink E. Stuible H.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8601-8606Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In extension of this work, we are now exploring the structure-function relationship of 4CL-like proteins that are amply encoded by the Arabidopsis genome (4.Shockey J.M. Fulda M.S. Browse J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 37.Schneider K. Hövel K. Witzel K. Hamberger B. Schomburg D. Kombrink E. Stuible H.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8601-8606Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that 4CL-like proteins may activate cinnamic, benzoic, or fatty acid derivatives, including precursors of plant hormones, but no such enzymatic function has yet been demonstrated for any of these proteins (4.Shockey J.M. Fulda M.S. Browse J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 37.Schneider K. Hövel K. Witzel K. Hamberger B. Schomburg D. Kombrink E. Stuible H.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8601-8606Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 38.Reumann S. Ma C. Lemke S. Babujee L. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 2587-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Ideally, direct transfer of structural information from the 4CL system to 4CL-like proteins would lead to a defined arrangement of amino acid residues forming the putative SBP, thereby delimiting the space and chemical environment for a potential substrate. However, structure prediction is still a challenging task, and in case of the 4CL-like proteins further hampered by the occurrence of insertions and deletions in the region comprising the putative SBP-forming amino acid residues. Therefore, we developed a luciferase-based assay that is generally applicable to adenylate-forming enzymes and allows the semi-quantitative analysis of their in vitro substrate utilization at a large scale. By applying this screen to two 4CL-like proteins from Arabidopsis, At4g05160 and At5g63380, we uncovered that both enzymes have the capacity to activate different fatty acid derivatives, including the JA precursors OPDA and 3-oxo-2-(2′-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-hexanoic acid (OPC-6:0). Together with their demonstrated localization in peroxisomes, these catalytic activities suggest that both enzymes have a function in JA biosynthesis. Isolation and Cloning of At4g05160 and At5g63380 cDNAs—The cDNAs of At4g05160 and At5g63380 were amplified by RT-PCR from A. thaliana (Col-0) total RNA. Synthesis of the cDNAs and subsequent PCR amplification of the full-length reading frames was performed with the Titan® one tube RT-PCR kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the primer pair At4g05160-FI and -RI (ATGGAGAAATCCGGCTACGGCAGAGACG and TCACATCTTGGATCTTACTTGCTGAACAAG) and the primer pair At5g63380-FI and -RI (ATGCTGACGAAAACCAACGACAGC and TCAAAGTTTTGATGCATTGCCATCCAC), respectively. The resulting cDNAs were used as templates for a second round of PCR amplification using the primer pair At4g05160-FII and -RII (ATCTTAACAAGCATGCCGAAATCCGGCTACGGCAGAGACGGAATTTAC and TATTAATTAGTCGACTCACATCTTGGATCTTACTTGCTGAACAAGTTC) and the primer pair At5g63380-FII and -RII (TTAAATGGATCCATGCTGACGAAAACCAACGACAGCCG and AATTAAGTCGACTCAAAGTTTTGATGCATTGCCATCCACAGC), respectively. In the case of At4g05160, this second PCR amplification was used to introduce the SphI and SalI sites required for cloning into the expression vector pQE32 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). In case of At5g63380, BamHI and SalI sites were introduced in the second round of PCR amplification, and the resulting product was cloned into the expression plasmid pQE30 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The DNA sequences of all isolated clones were determined by the ADIS service unit (Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research, Köln, Germany) on ABI PRISM377 DNA sequencers (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City) by using BigDye Terminator chemistry and were found to be identical with the sequences available from the MIPS data base (Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences, Neuherberg, Germany). Heterologous Expression and Purification of At4g05160 and At5g63380 —Expression and purification of At4g05160 and At5g63380 were essentially carried out as described previously for At4CL2 (2.Stuible H.-P. Büttner D. Ehlting J. Hahlbrock K. Kombrink E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), with the exception that the expression plasmids were introduced into the Escherichia coli strain DH5α carrying the repressor plasmid pREP4 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and that the growth temperature was reduced to 25 °C. The purity of the enzymes was inspected by SDS gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (39.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. 4CL-catalyzed Synthesis of CoA Esters—4CL activity was determined by the spectrophotometric assay described previously (6.Ehlting J. Büttner D. Wang Q. Douglas C.J. Somssich I.E. Kombrink E. Plant J. 1999; 19: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) with standard concentrations of the cinnamic acid derivative (0.2 mm), ATP (5.5 mm), and CoA (0.3 mm). The specific increase of absorbance during CoA ester formation was monitored at wavelengths of 311, 333, 363, 345, and 352 nm for cinnamoyl-CoA, 4-coumaroyl-CoA, caffeoyl-CoA, feruloyl-CoA, and sinapoyl-CoA, respectively, and the appropriate molar extinction coefficients were used for calculating activity (40.Gross G.G. Zenk M.H. Z. Naturforsch. 1966; 21: 683-690Google Scholar, 41.Stöckigt J. Zenk M.H. Z. Naturforsch. 1975; 30: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Luciferase-based Assay of Adenylate-forming Enzymes—To screen a large number of carboxylic acids for activation by 4CL and 4CL-like proteins, the decrease in ATP concentration was determined by a luciferase-coupled assay. The standard reaction mixture contained 2 μg of purified protein, 200 μm carboxylic acid substrate, 50 μm ATP, 250 μm MgCl2, 100 μm CoA, 1 mm dithioerythritol, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) in a total volume of 200 μl. Highly lipophilic substrates, such as long-chain fatty acids, were dissolved in buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, leading to a final concentration of 0.1% Triton X-100 in the assay. Jasmonic acid precursors were first dissolved in EtOH and subsequently diluted with detergent-containing buffer, leading to final concentrations of 0.1% EtOH and 0.1% Triton X-100 in the assay. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature, and for ATP determination, 2-μl samples were withdrawn at various time points and added to a reaction mixture containing 1 μg of firefly luciferase (Roche Diagnostics), 4.6 μg of luciferin (Roche Diagnostics), and 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) in total volume of 200 μl. Photon emission was measured for 10 s with a Lumat LB 9501 luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany) and expressed as relative luciferase activity, which is directly proportional to ATP concentration. To minimize the variability of the assay, all ATP determinations were normalized to a reaction containing At4CL2 and sinapic acid, in which no ATP depletion occurred and correspondingly was set to 100%. Time course experiments using At4CL2 showed that good substrates resulted in significant ATP depletion within 1–4 h (not shown). Therefore, an incubation period of 2 h was chosen for the large scale screen. Coupled Enzyme Assay of Acyl-CoA Synthetases—For detailed kinetic analyses, the activation of selected substrates to the corresponding CoA esters by At4g05160 and At5g63380 was followed by measuring AMP formation in a coupled spectrophotometric assay with myokinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase adapted from Ziegler et al. (42.Ziegler K. Braun K. Böckler A. Fuchs G. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 149: 62-69Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithioerythritol, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 m CoA, 0.1 mm NADH, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 12 nanokatal of myokinase, 7 nanokatal of pyruvate kinase, 9 nanokatal of lactate dehydrogenase, and 4–1600 μm carboxylic acid substrate. For highly lipophilic substrates 0.1% Triton X-100 was added. The reaction was started by addition of 2–8 μg of purified enzyme and the oxidation of 2 mol of NADH per mol of substrate activated was followed at 340 nm (ϵNADH = 6.22 cm2 μmol−1). Km and Vmax values were obtained by linear regression of V/s against s (Hanes plots) from at least three independent experiments. Transient Expression and Subcellular Localization of At4g05160 and At5g63380 in Planta—At4g05160 and At5g63380 cDNAs were PCR-amplified using the primer pair attB1-05160 and attB2-05160 (attB1-TCATGGAGAAATCCGGCTACGG and attB2-CTCACATCTTGGATCTTAGTTGC) and the primer pair attB1-63380 and attB2-63380 (attB1-TCATGCTGACGAAAACCAACG and attB2-CTCAAAGTTTTGATGCATTGCC), respectively, thereby making the PCR products compatible with the Gateway® cloning system (Invitrogen). Both modified cDNAs were inserted into the Gateway donor vector pDONR201 by homologous recombination according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting plasmids were used to transfer both coding sequences into the expression vector pENSGYFP, which is based on pXCS (GenBank™ accession number AY457636) and was kindly provided by Dr. N. Medina-Escobar (Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research, Köln, Germany), leading to N-terminal fusions of YFP to At4g05160 and At5g63380. To serve as peroxisomal marker, the red fluorescent protein, dsRED (FP583 from Discosoma sp.), with the peroxisomal import sequence -SRL fused to its C terminus (kindly provided by M. Miklis, Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research, Köln, Germany) was cloned via HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites into the plant binary expression vector pAMPAT-MCS (GenBank™ accession number AY436765). All newly designed vectors allowed the in planta expression of proteins under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus double 35S promoter. For transient in planta expression, detached leaves of 4-week-old A. thaliana (Col-0) plants were placed on 1% agar plates containing 85 μm benzimidazole and bombarded with 1 μm gold particles coated with vector DNA using the Biolistic® PDS-1000/He Particle Delivery System (Bio-Rad). Preparation of the DNA-coated gold beads was performed as suggested by the manufacturer. Each macrocarrier was loaded with 6 μl of the gold particle suspension, and the transformation was carried out as described previously (43.Ancillo G. Hoegen E. Kombrink E. Planta. 2003; 217: 566-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Bombarded leaves were placed in a growth chamber for 36 h, and subsequent fluorescence microscopy was carried out by using an LSM 510 Meta confocal laser microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). An argon laser was used as excitation source (514 nm), and light emission was detected in the range of 570–634 nm for RFP constructs and 535–545 nm for YFP constructs. Images were recorded and processed by using LSM 510 3.2 software (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Mass Spectrometric Analysis—For the identification of the CoA ester products formed from various substrates, the reaction mixture contained 2 μg of purified enzyme, 1 mm carboxylic acid substrate, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm CoA, 30 mm NH4HCO3, and 0.1% Triton X-100. After an incubation period of 60 min, the samples were diluted with equal volumes of acetonitrile, and 2-μl aliquots were applied to Au/Pd-coated borosilicate glass capillary type medium (Proxeon Biosystems, Odense, Denmark). Mass spectra were recorded with a Micromass Q-TOF 2™ spectrometer (Waters) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ionization source and operating in negative ion mode. Capillary voltage was set at 800 V and cone voltage at 40 V. Full-scan mass spectra were obtained by scanning from m/z 0 to 1500. Putative product peaks were further characterized by MS/MS analysis using argon as collision gas and a collision voltage of 30 V. Data processing was carried out using the MassLynx software (version 3.5) from Micromass (Waters). RNA Preparation and Collection of Gene Expression Data—A. thaliana plants were grown in soil in a growth chamber under controlled conditions with the photoperiod set to 10 h of light (180 μEm−2 s−1) and 14 h of dark, a temperature of 22–23 °C, and a relative humidity of 65%. Total RNA was extracted from fully developed leaves of 4-week-old plants using RNAwiz (Ambion, Austin, Texas) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cRNA labeling, hybridization to the GeneChip ATH-1 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), and collection of fluorescence data were performed as recommended by the manufacturer.

We isolated an aquaporin, SaAQP1o, that belongs to a unique subfamily of aquaporin-1-like channels specifically evolved in teleosts and mainly expressed in the ovary. We further show that hormone-induced fish oocyte hydration is a highly controlled process based on the interplay between protein hydrolysis and the translocation of SaAQP1o to the plasma membrane, indicating a specialized physiological role for this aquaporin."
https://openalex.org/W2117948738,"p18 was first identified as a factor associated with a macromolecular tRNA synthetase complex. Here we describe the mouse p18 loss-of-function phenotype and a role for p18 in the DNA damage response. Inactivation of both p18 alleles caused embryonic lethality, while heterozygous mice showed high susceptibility to spontaneous tumors. p18 was induced and translocated to the nucleus in response to DNA damage. Expression of p18 resulted in elevated p53 levels, while p18 depletion blocked p53 induction. p18 directly interacted with ATM/ATR in response to DNA damage. The activity of ATM was dependent on the level of p18, suggesting the requirement of p18 for the activation of ATM. Low p18 expression was frequently observed in different human cancer cell lines and tissues. These results suggest that p18 is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor and a key factor for ATM/ATR-mediated p53 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2094833237,"ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) is widely expressed in adult mammals and has a critical role during embryogenesis. Two size forms of ADAR1 are known that possess adenosine-to-inosine editing activity: an interferon (IFN)-inducible ∼150-kDa protein and a constitutively expressed N-terminally truncated ∼110-kDa protein. We defined the structure of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse Adar1 gene, and we show here that mouse Adar1 transcripts possess alternative exon 1 structures (1A, 1B, and 1C) that initiate from unique promoters and are spliced to a common exon 2 junction. Exon 1A-containing transcripts encoding p150 were expressed in all tissues examined from adult mice (brain, cecum, heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, and Peyer's patches) and were elevated most significantly in liver but remained lowest in brain following oral infection with Salmonella. Exon 1B-containing RNA was most abundant in brain and was not increased in any tissue examined following infection. Exon 1C-containing RNA was very scarce. Exon 1A, but not exon 1B or 1C, expression was increased in fibroblast L cells treated with IFN, and a consensus ISRE element was present in the promoter driving exon 1A expression. Exon 1B, but not 1A, was detectable in embryonic day 10.5 embryos and was abundantly expressed in embryonic day 15 embryos. Furthermore, the ADAR1 p110 protein isoform was detected in embryonic tissue, whereas both p110 and the inducible p150 proteins were found in IFN-treated L cells. Finally, the presence of alternative exon 7a correlated with exon 1B-containing RNA, and alternative exon 7b correlated with exon 1A-containing RNA. These results establish that multiple promoters drive the expression of the Adar1 gene in adult mice, that the IFN inducible promoter and exon 1A-containing RNA are primarily responsible for the increased ADAR1 observed in Salmonella-infected mice, and that the constitutive exon 1B-containing transcript and encoded p110 protein product are abundantly expressed both in adult brain and during embryogenesis.

Emeson R.B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 499-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 2Bass B.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 817-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 3Maas S.

Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). Such A-to-I editing represents a form of genetic recoding, because inosine is recognized as guanosine by decoding ribosomes and by transcribing polymerases. Enzymes that catalyze A-to-I editing are known as ADARs (adenosine deaminases that act on RNA) (5Bass B.L. Nishikura K. Keller W. Seeburg P.H. Emeson R.B. O'Connell M.A. Samuel C.E. Herbert A. RNA. 1997; 3: 947-949PubMed Google Scholar). ADARs deaminate RNA substrates with double-stranded structure. In fact, the enzymatic activity of ADARs was discovered as an RNA duplex unwinding activity (6Bass B.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1987; 48: 607-613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 7Rebagliati M.R. Melton D.A. Cell. 1987; 48: 599-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). A-to-I editing is of broad biologic significance. Among the best characterized cellular and viral RNAs that undergo A-to-I editing with high selectivity at one or a few positions are transcripts encoding glutamate receptor (GluR) channels, the serotonin-2C receptor, and hepatitis delta virus RNA (8Seeburg P.H. Hartner J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 9Wong S.K. Sato S. Lazinski D.W. RNA. 2001; 7: 846-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). RNA editing of the neurotransmitter receptor transcript substrates is specified by imperfect duplex RNA structures, and the editing leads to selective amino acid substitutions in the encoded receptor proteins that alter either the conductance properties in the case of the GluR ion channels or G-protein coupling function in the case of the serotonin-2C receptor (1Gott J.M. Emeson R.B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 499-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 8Seeburg P.H. Hartner J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Editing of the viral hepatitis delta virus RNA allows for the production of two forms of delta antigen from a single open reading frame; conversion of an amber UAG translation termination codon to a UIG tryptophan codon permits the synthesis of a C-terminally extended protein (9Wong S.K. Sato S. Lazinski D.W. RNA. 2001; 7: 846-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 10Lai M.M.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 259-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In addition to the highly selective A-to-I deamination, A-to-I (G) hypermutation has also been observed for several negative-stranded RNA animal virus genomes during lytic and permissive infection, as exemplified by the measles virus (11Cattaneo R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 895-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, transcripts encoded by polyoma virus, a double-stranded DNA virus, also are edited late in infection (12Kumar M. Carmichael G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3542-3547Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although the cellular GluR and serotonin-2C receptor substrates were identified serendipitously, more recently several thousand candidate A-to-I editing sites were discovered by a computational search of the human transcriptome using large numbers of expressed sequences (13Levanon E.Y. Eisenberg E. Yelin R. Nemzer S. Hallegger M. Shemesh R Fligelman Z.Y. Shoshan A. Pollock S.R. Sztybel D. Olshansky M. Rechavi G. Jantsch M.F. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). These newly identified sites, together with a more limited number found using a cloning strategy for I-containing RNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans (14Morse D.P. Aruscavage P.J. Bass B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7906-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), occur primarily in noncoding regions of RNA and often in Alu repeats (13Levanon E.Y. Eisenberg E. Yelin R.

Two mammalian genes, Adar1 and Adar2, encode catalytically active RNA adenosine deaminases that efficiently edit synthetic and naturally occurring substrates with double-stranded RNA character (1Gott J.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4874-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). ADAR1 and ADAR2 both possess multiple copies of a canonical double-stranded RNA-binding motif that are located in the central region of the proteins: three double-stranded RNA-binding motif copies in ADAR1 and two in ADAR2 (3Maas S. Rich A. Nishikura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1391-1394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 4Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). The double-stranded RNA-binding motifs of ADARs are distinct from the deaminase catalytic domain, which is positioned in the C-terminal region of the ADAR proteins (4Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar, 21Liu Y. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1961-1968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Liu Y. Lei M. Samuel C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12541-12546Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although the double-stranded RNA-binding motifs are presumed to play a role in the binding of substrate RNAs, they might also play a role in the regulation of enzymatic activity. For example, adenovirus VAI RNA, a small and highly structured viral gene product transcribed by cellular RNA polymerase III, efficiently antagonizes ADAR deaminase activity (23Lei M. Liu Y. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1998; 245: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The regulation of ADAR1 protein expression in cells is a complex process. Two differently sized ADAR1 enzyme isoforms, p150 and p110, are known (24Patterson J.P. Samuel C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5376-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The larger form of ADAR1, p150, is an interferon (IFN)-inducible protein that is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of human cells (24Patterson J.P. Samuel C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5376-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 25Strehblow A. Hallegger M. Jantsch M.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3822-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The inducible p150 isoform of ADAR1 possesses, in addition to the multiple RNA-binding motifs (21Liu Y. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1961-1968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Patterson J.P. Samuel C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5376-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), two copies of a Z-DNA-binding motif (Zα and Zβ) in the N-terminal region of the protein (24Patterson J.P. Samuel C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5376-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 26Herbert A. Lowenhaupt K. Spitzer J. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26828-26833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The constitutive p110 isoform, which lacks the N-terminal 295 amino acids that include the Zα-binding motif, is found predominantly if not exclusively in the nucleus (24Patterson J.P. Samuel C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5376-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 28Poulsen H. Nilsson J. Damgaard C.K. Egebjerg J. Kjems J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7862-7871Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For the ∼50-kb human Adar1 gene, alternative promoters including one inducible by IFNs and at least two that are constitutively active, give rise to transcripts containing alternative exon 1 structures with the capacity to encode either the constitutive p110 protein or the inducible p150 protein (29George C.X. Samuel C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4621-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 30George C.X. Samuel C.E.

Additional ADAR protein multiplicity is achieved by alternative splicing involving downstream exons, in the cases of both ADAR1 and ADAR2 (32Liu Y. George C.X. Patterson J.B. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4419-4428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Lai F. Chen C.X. Carter K.C. Nishikura K. Mol. Cell.

For ADAR1, the two major downstream exon splice variants observed involve alternative exon 7 structures (32Liu Y. George C.X. Patterson J.B. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4419-4428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The full physiologic significance of the internal exon 7a and 7b splice variants of ADAR1 is not known; one possibility may relate to the substrate selectivity of the enzymes (18Liu Y. Samuel C.E. J.

Furthermore, there is an essential requirement for ADAR1 during embryogenesis. Mouse embryos homozygous null for the Adar1 gene die between E11 and E12.5, and they are characterized by a rapidly disintegrating liver structure and widespread apoptosis in embryonic tissue (39Wang Q. Miyakoda M. Yang W. Khillan J. Stachura. D.L. Weiss M.J. Nishikura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4952-4961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 40Hartner J.C.

By contrast to the embryonic lethality of the Adar1 null, mice homozygous null for the Adar2 gene die several weeks after birth from a neurological syndrome, but they appear normal when the unedited CAG codon at the exon 11 Q/R ADAR2 editing site of GluR is replaced with the edited CIG codon in transgenic mice (38Higuchi M. Maas S. Single F.N. Hartner J. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Feldmeyer D. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). In addition to the role of ADAR1 in embryo development possibly beyond the nervous system, ADAR1 also appears to play a role in innate immune responses. Increased ADAR1 transcript levels are seen in mice orally infected with Salmonella at doses that typically result in death 7–8 days after infection (37Shtrichman R. Heithoff D.M. Mahan M.J. Samuel C.E. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Increased ADAR1 expression is also seen in mice treated with endotoxin, which leads to systemic acute inflammation (41Yang J.H. Luo X. Nie Y. Su Y. Zhao Q. Kabir K. Zhang D. Rabinovici R. Immunology. 2003; 109: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, little is known with regard to the isoforms of ADAR1 expressed during embryogenesis or in uninfected versus bacterially infected adult mice. Likewise, the mechanism by which ADAR1 gene expression is regulated during microbial infection is poorly understood. In this study, we delineated the structure of the mouse Adar1 gene 5′-flanking region, which allowed us to undertake whole animal studies of ADAR1 expression in the mouse model. We found that in mice multiple alternative promoters drive the expression of ADAR1 transcripts that possess alternative exon 1 and 7 structures. We established that the alternative exon 1A-containing transcripts that encode the p150 ADAR1 isoform also contain exon 7b and that these transcripts are up-regulated in a number of tissues from adult mice following bacterial infection, most strikingly in liver. We found that alternative exon 1B/exon 7a-containing transcripts that encode the p110 ADAR1 isoform are abundantly expressed in the developing embryo and also in the brain of adult mice, and we detected the p110 protein both in embryonic tissue and uninfected adult tissue with antibody prepared against recombinant ADAR1. These results reveal a complex organization and regulation of Adar1 in mammals and provide novel insights regarding the function of the different isoforms of ADAR1 during embryogenesis and adult life that indicate a broad biological importance of ADAR1. Isolation and Characterization of ADAR1 Genomic Clones—A mouse genomic library in the λ phage vector EMBL-3SP6/T7 (Clontech) was screened initially by filter hybridization using random primed 32P-labeled restriction fragments from the mouse ADAR1 cDNA as probes. A specific ∼0.8-kb genomic DNA probe that included contiguous exon 2 and intron I sequence then was used to obtain λ phage clones carrying genomic sequence 5′ to exon 2, including λ 52. Subsequently, the mouse bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) genomic library CitbCJ7 (California Institute of Technology) was screened for BAC clones carrying the mouse Adar1 gene, yielding clones BAC 229 and BAC 232 (42Weier H-U.G. George C.X. Lersch R.A. Breitweser S. Cheng J.-F. Samuel C.E. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2000; 89: 214-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic inserts were characterized by restriction mapping and Southern blot analysis (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 382-389Google Scholar). Restriction fragments from the λ 52 and BAC 232 genomic clones were then subcloned into the pBluescript plasmid for detailed restriction mapping and DNA sequence analysis. Determination of the 5′-cDNA Region—The 5′-region of the mouse ADAR1 cDNA was obtained by the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) procedure (44Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 85: 8998-9002Crossref Scopus (4336) Google Scholar) by using the Marathon-Ready cDNA system (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A library of adaptor-ligated cDNA prepared from mouse brain was used to amplify the 5′-end of the mouse ADAR1 cDNA. The first round PCR was performed with an ADAR1 exon 2 minus-sense primer (E2 minus 842) corresponding to nucleotides 842–822 (5′-CAAGTCAATCAGCACTGAGGT-3′) of exon 2 (numbered with the 5′-end of exon 2 designated as nucleotide 1) and the plus-sense adaptor primer AP1 supplied by Clontech. Nested PCR was then performed with the Clontech plus primer AP2 and either the original minus primer or a new mouse ADAR1 cDNA-specific minus (E2 minus 646) primer (5′-CCTCTAGGGAATTCCTGGAT-3′) corresponding to nucleotides 646–627 of exon 2. The 5′-RACE PCR products were cloned into pBluescript SK plasmid and sequenced, and the results were compared with the DNA sequences obtained for the genomic clones. Sequence Analysis—Plasmid subclones were sequenced by the Sanger dideoxynucleotide procedure (45Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sequences were analyzed with University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group programs on a Silicon Graphics IRIS 4D/340VGX computer. The sequences obtained have been deposited in the GenBank™ data base and assigned accession numbers AY488121–AY488123 and AY508955–AY508958. Southern Gel Blot Analysis—Southern gel blot analyses (46Southern E.M. J. Mol.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 382-389Google Scholar). The filters were probed with 32P-random labeled cDNA fragments or 32P end-labeled specific oligonucleotide probes corresponding to alternative exon 1 regions of mouse ADAR1 cDNA. Northern Gel Blot Analysis—Northern gel blot analyses of RNA isolated from mouse L fibroblast cells and from mouse tissue samples were performed as described previously (24Patterson J.P. Samuel C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5376-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 37Shtrichman R. Heithoff D.M. Mahan M.J. Samuel C.E. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from cultured L cells, either left untreated or treated with IFN, and from organs of mice either uninfected or infected with Salmonella, by using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis—RT-PCR was performed essentially as described (29George C.X. Samuel C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4621-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 47Thomis D.C. Floyd-Smith G. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10723-10728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamer oligonucleotide primers and reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science or Invitrogen Superscript) at 42 °C. The random-primed cDNA prepared with RNA isolated from mouse L cells or mouse tissues was PCR-amplified (48Saiki R.K. Scharf S. Faloona F. Mullis K.B. Horn G.T. Erlich H.A. Arnheim N. Science. 1985; 230: 1350-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (6793) Google Scholar) using Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and the following PCR primer pairs: exon 1A plus 19 (nucleotides 19–40, 5′-GTCTCAAGGGTTCAGGGGACCC-3′) and exon 2 minus 842 or exon 2 minus 646; exon 1B plus 72 (nucleotides 72–94, 5′-TCACGAGTGGGCAGCGTCCGAGG-3′) and exon 2 minus 842 or exon 2 minus 646; exon 1A plus 19 and exon 8 minus 2299 (nucleotides 2299–2280, 5′-TTGAAGCACCTGTGGCTCAG-3′); exon 1B plus 72 and exon 8 minus 2299; exon 1C plus 8 (nucleotides 8–30, 5′-TCGGTTCTTGGGCCCTGCCAGAG-3′) and exon 8 minus 2299; and exon 4 plus 1684 (nucleotides 1684–1703, 5′-CACTGCTTGAGTGTATGCAC-3′) and exon 8 minus 2299. Exon 1A, 1B, and 1C numbering is as in Fig. 1. All other numbering is based on the assignment of the 5′-end of exon 2 as nucleotide 1. Cell Maintenance, Interferon Treatment, and Infection of Mice— Mouse L fibroblast cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. IFN treatment was with 1000 units/ml of recombinant IFN-αA/D (PBL Biochemical Laboratories) for 24 h (49Samuel C.E. Knutson G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11791-11795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Parallel cultures were left untreated as controls. Female BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratory) infected orally by gastrointubation with wild-type Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were sacrificed at 6 days after infection and tissues were prepared rapidly for RNA analyses as previously described (37Shtrichman R. Heithoff D.M. Mahan M.J. Samuel C.E. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For analysis of ADAR1 expression in mouse embryos at specific stages of development, embryos from uninfected females were collected at embryonic days 10.0, 10.5, 14.5, and 15.0 for analysis of RNA and protein expression. Where noted, separate embryo regions corresponding to the head and the torso were isolated, and the liver and brain were taken from the adult for parallel analysis. Western Immunoblot Analysis—For Western analysis, cell-free protein extracts of cultured cells or mouse tissue were prepared using tissue protein extraction buffer (Pierce) supplemented with a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Protein extracts were fractionated on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with guinea pig polyclonal antibody (1:3000 dilution) prepared against mouse recombinant glutathione S-transferase-ADAR1(amino acids 574–968) fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli. Detection of antigen-antibody complex formation was with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-guinea pig secondary antibody using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Materials—Unless otherwise specified, the materials and reagents were as described previously (24Patterson J.P. Samuel C.E. Mol. Cell.

Isolation and Characterization of 5′-RACE Clones of Mouse ADAR1—To define the 5′-terminal region of mouse ADAR1 mRNA transcripts, 5′-RACE was carried out using nested primers and an adapter-ligated cDNA library prepared from mouse brain. The ADAR1 primer E2 minus 842 (corresponding to antisense nucleotides 842–822 of exon 2) and the plus adaptor primer AP1 first were used together, followed secondly by the nested primer pair ADAR1 E2 minus 646 (corresponding to antisense nucleotides 646–627 of exon 2) and plus adaptor primer AP2. The resultant 5′-RACE cDNAs were subcloned into pBluescript SK plasmid and sequenced. Three classes of ADAR1 5′-RACE cDNA clones were identified on the basis of their unique 5′-sequences that diverged from each other exactly at the exon 1-exon 2 junction (Fig. 1). One form of mouse ADAR1 5′-RACE cDNA clone possessed the 5′-sequence identified earlier (12Kumar M. Carmichael G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Heterozygous inactivating GCK mutations cause hyperglycemia, whereas activating mutations cause hypoglycemia. We studied the GCK V62M mutation identified in two families and co-segregating with hyperglycemia to understand how this mutation resulted in reduced function. Structural modeling locates the mutation close to five naturally occurring activating mutations in the allosteric activator site of the enzyme. Recombinant glutathionyl S-transferase-V62M GCK is paradoxically activated rather than inactivated due to a decreased S0.5 for glucose compared with wild type (4.88 versus 7.55 mm). The recently described pharmacological activator (RO0281675) interacts with GCK at this site. V62M GCK does not respond to RO0281675, nor does it respond to the hepatic glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP). The enzyme is also thermally unstable, but this lability is apparently less pronounced than in the proven instability mutant E300K. Functional and structural analysis of seven amino acid substitutions at residue Val62 has identified a non-linear relationship between activation by the pharmacological activator and the van der Waals interactions energies. Smaller energies allow a hydrophobic interaction between the activator and glucokinase, whereas larger energies prohibit the ligand from fitting into the binding pocket. We conclude that V62M may cause hyperglycemia by a complex defect of GCK regulation involving instability in combination with loss of control by a putative endogenous activator and/or GKRP. This study illustrates that mutations that cause hyperglycemia are not necessarily kinetically inactivating but may exert their effects by other complex mechanisms. Elucidating such mechanisms leads to a deeper understanding of the GCK glucose sensor and the biochemistry of β-cells and hepatocytes. Glucokinase (GCK) serves as the pancreatic glucose sensor.

Glucokinase (GCK) 1The abbreviations used are: GCK, glucokinase; GKRP, glucokinase regulatory protein; MODY, maturity-onset diabetes of the young; fpg, fasting plasma glucose; GST, glutathionyl S-transferase; S6P, sorbitol 6-phosphate; WT, wild type. plays a critical role in the regulation of insulin secretion and has been termed the pancreatic β-cell glucose sensor on account of its kinetics, which allow the β-cells to change glucose phosphorylation rate over a range of physiological glucose concentrations. These kinetic characteristics are the enzyme's low affinity for glucose (S0.5 ∼ 7.5 mm), cooperativity with glucose (Hill number of ∼1.7), and lack of inhibition by its product glucose 6-phosphate. Glucokinase plays an important role in glucose sensing not only in the pancreatic β-cell but also in the liver and a variety of neural/neuroendocrine cells. These include the pancreatic α-cell, L- and K-type gut enterocytes, and certain rare neurons in the central nervous system, mainly in the hypothalamus (1.Cheung A.T. Dayanandan B. Lewis J.T.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). It is the sum of its actions in these multiple sites that ultimately determines the blood glucose concentration. In the liver glucokinase is regulated by glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP), which acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to glucose (4.Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 5.Van Schaftingen E. Detheux M. Veiga da Cunha M. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In addition to this role GKRP also determines the subcellular location of glucokinase within the liver cell (6.Toyoda Y. Tsuchida A. Iwami E. Shironoguchi H. Miwa I. Horm. Metab. Res. 2001; 33: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Glucokinase translocates between the nucleus and the cytoplasm depending on the metabolic state of the cells. When glucokinase is not bound to hepatic GKRP and therefore present in the cytoplasm, the enzyme facilitates hepatic glucose utilization and glycogen synthesis thereby helping to lower the blood glucose concentration. Consistent with this role in the liver, mice that totally lack hepatic glucokinase have impaired glucose tolerance (7.Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D.

There is controversy in the literature as to whether GKRP is expressed in the β-cell (8.Grimsby J. Coffey J.W. Dvorozniak M.T. Magram J. Li G. Matschinsky F.M. Shiota C. Kaur S.

Mutat. 2003; 22: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These mutations include non-sense, frameshift, deletions, splice-site, and missense mutations, and they are distributed throughout the ten exons (1a-10) of the pancreatic isoform of the gene. The functional characterization of over 35 missense GCK mutations that cause MODY, has shown that a number of these kinetic parameters are altered and that usually more than one parameter is changed (16.Gloyn A.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1645-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These changes usually include an increase in the glucose S0.5 and/or a decrease in the turnover of the enzyme (kcat). This exploration has also uncovered mutants that are thermally labile (19.Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S394-S404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations may have additional defects or appear kinetically close to normal or entirely normal (19.Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S394-S404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stability of the mutant glutathionyl S-transferase (GST)-E300K-GCK has been studied extensively in a cell biological assessment of enzyme expression and stability in addition to in vitro thermolability assays providing evidence that instability is indeed pathogenic in this case (20.Burke C.V.

Five missense mutations have been reported (T65I, W99R, Y214C, V455M, and A456V), and functional characterization of these mutations has shown that they are activating mutations, because there is a decrease in the glucose S0.5 and/or an increase in the kcat (21.Gloyn A.L.

Given the existence of this allosteric activator site and the fact that GCK responds to this novel class of pharmacological activators, an endogenous allosteric activator of GCK has been proposed (19.Matschinsky F.M.

In this study we present a novel GCK mutation (V62M), which has been identified in two families and shown to co-segregate with MODY. When functionally characterized, recombinant GST-V62M GCK is paradoxically mildly activating rather than inactivating. This study provides the most detailed functional assessment of a GCK mutation to date and includes extensive mutagenesis studies at residue Val62, which increase our structural insights and enhance our understanding of the allosteric activator site. Family 1 (Exeter, UK)—The female proband (III:4) presented with gestational diabetes during her first pregnancy. This diagnosis was made on the basis of an oral glucose tolerance test performed at 26-week gestation, which showed a fasting value of 5.5 and a 2-h value of 9.2 mm. She was managed on diet alone. Her male infant was born at 41 weeks (birth weight, 3.27 kg; length, 50 cm; head circumference, 35 cm; percentiles were 16th, 17th, and 27th, respectively). An oral glucose tolerance test performed on the proband at 8 weeks post partum showed a fasting level of 6.5 and a 2-h value of 7.1 mm. The proband's father (II:6) was diagnosed with abnormal glucose tolerance at the age of 57 years during routine screening and had been treated by diet. The deceased paternal grandmother had diabetes. Anthropometrical measurements (height, weight, body mass index), fasting blood glucose (fpg), lipids, and HbA1c were measured in all family members available for testing; including one brother, two paternal aunts, one paternal uncle, and four paternal first cousins (see Fig. 1a). Family 2 (Italy)—The male proband (IV:1) and his identical twin brother (IV:2) were diagnosed with MODY on the basis of elevated fpg values at the age of 6 years. Both boys were born at 39 weeks (birth weight, 3.3 kg). Details of this family are shown in Fig. 1b. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes using a Wizard DNA extraction kit (Promega, Southampton, UK). The coding regions of exons 1a-10 and the intron-exon boundaries of the glucokinase (GCK) gene were amplified by PCR using published primer sequences (29.Stoffel M. Froguel P. Takeda J. Zouali H.

PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR purification columns (Qiagen), and both strands were sequenced using a BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Reactions were analyzed on an ABI 3100 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Recombinant human islet wild type enzyme and the mutants V62A, V62E, V62F, V62K, V62L, V62M, V62Q, V62T, and E300K were generated using methods previously described (30.Liang Y. Kesavan P. Wang L.Q.

Protocol A was carried out with 11 glucose dilutions between 0 and 100 mm for each mutant and WT GST-GCK. Protocol B was carried out with glucose at ×10 S0.5 for wild type, each Val62 mutant and E300K GCK. Further kinetic analysis was performed in the presence of the newly discovered compounds (RO028165, RO0274375, and RO0283946; Fig. 2) that allosterically activate wild type GCK (26.Grimsby J. Sarabu R. Corbett W. Haynes N. Bizzarro F. Coffey J. Guertin K. Hillard D. Kester R. Mahaney P. Marcus L. Qi L. Spence C. Tengi J. Magnuson M. Matschinsky F. Grippo J.F. Science. 2003; 301: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in the presence of 0.3 μm, 1 μm, 3 μm, 9 μm, 27 μm, and 60 μm RO0281675, RO0274375, and RO0283946. The results were compared with those obtained with wild type GST-GCK preparations freshly made for the present investigation. The activity index, an expression of the proposed in situ phosphorylation capacity of the enzyme, was calculated as previously described (24.Christesen H.B. Jacobsen B.B. Odili S. Buettger C. Cuesta-Munoz A. Hansen T. Brusgaard K. Massa O. Magnuson M.A. Shiota C. Matschinsky F.M. Barbetti F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1240-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis was also performed with human and rat recombinant glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP). GKRP is a competitive inhibitor of glucose (31.Veiga-da-Cunha M. Xu L.Z. Lee Y.H. Marotta D. Pilkis S.J. Van Schaftingen E. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and consequently the kinetic analysis was carried out as previously described with glucose at 3 mm for wild type, V62F, and V62Q and to account for the decreased or increased glucose S0.5 values at 1 mm for V62L, 1.5 mm for V62M, 2.5 mm for V62K, 4.5 mm for V62E, 7.5 mm for V62T, and 8.5 mm for V62A (17.Davis E.A.

Thermal stability of the mutant V62M-GST GCK enzyme, the known instability mutant E300K-GST GCK, and wild type GST-GCK was tested using protocols previously described (32.Kesavan P. Wang L. Davis E. Cuesta A. Sweet I. Niswender K. Magnuson M.A. Matschinsky F.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The following modifications were made: enzyme stock solutions were diluted in storage buffer containing either 0 or 50 mm glucose. The enzymes were incubated in a water bath at 30, 32.5, 35, 37.5, 40, 42.5, 45, 47.5, 50, and 52.5 °C for 30 min. Glucokinase activity was then determined spectrophotometrically as described above. Glucose has been shown to stabilize glucokinase (33.Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes/Metabolism Reviews. 1986; 2: 163-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The stabilization of mutant V62M, E300K, and wild type GCK by the addition of glucose was therefore investigated. Briefly, enzyme stock solutions lacking glucose were diluted in buffer with increasing concentrations of glucose ranging from 0 to ∼100 mm and to achieve comparable protein concentrations of ∼75 μg/ml. The enzymes were incubated in a water bath at 42.5 °C for 30 min. Glucokinase activity was then determined spectrophotometrically as described above. Structural analysis of V62M and published activating mutations in the glucokinase enzyme was performed using a homology model based on the WT-GCK crystal structure, co-cystallized with α-d-glucose and the allosteric activator (RO0283946), as a template (42.Corbett, W. L., Crowther, R. L., Dunten, P. W., Kammlott, R. U., and Lukacs, C. M. (August 20, 2003) Crystal Structure Patent GB2385328Google Scholar). In addition, homology models for each of the mutations at amino acid position 62 were built. Interaction energies between the amino acids comprising the activator binding site and each of the pharmacological activators (RO028165, RO0274375, and RO0283946) in its x-ray position were calculated using MOE 2Chemical Computing Group Inc., Quebec, Canada. software and MMFF94X force fields. Sequencing of Glucokinase Gene—Direct sequencing of the entire coding region and exon-intron boundaries of the glucokinase gene was performed in the probands from both families. In both families a heterozygous missense mutation substituting methionine for valine at codon 62 (V62M; GTG>ATG) in exon 2 was identified. In family 1 (UK), this mutation was also identified in the proband's father, brother, paternal aunt, and cousin (Fig. 1a) and co-segregated with hyperglycemia as shown by either a raised fasting glucose of >5.5 mm or an elevated HbA1c above the normal range. In family 2 (Italy), the mutation was identified in the proband, the proband's identical twin brother, and the proband's mother. The other affected family members were not available for testing (Fig. 1b). This mutation was not found in over 100 normal chromosomes. Biochemical Characterization of V62M—The mutant enzyme was expressed as a GST fusion protein, and the purified enzyme was subjected to kinetic analysis (kcat, glucose S0.5, nH, and ATP Km) (Table I). Four preparations of wild type, mutant V62M, and four of E300K GST-GCK were purified. All GCK proteins analyzed were found to be essentially pure as indicated by the presence of a single band at 75 kDa on phast gel (Amersham Biosciences) electrophoresis (data not shown). The functional data are shown in Table I (except those for E300K, which have been published already (12.Arden C. Harbottle A. Baltrusch S. Tiedge M. Agius L.

The mutant enzyme showed a significant increase in affinity for glucose indicated by the decrease in glucose S0.5 value (4.88 ± 0.25 versus 7.55 ± 0.23 V62M and WT, respectively). Paradoxically, the change to the kinetic parameters of this mutant result in an increase in the activity of this enzyme compared with wild type of ∼4-fold inconsistent with this mutation causing MODY.Table IMutational Analysis of the V62 GKA binding site Data are means ± S.E. for wild type and V62M GCK.

Analysis of the thermal stability of GST-GCK showed that the wild type enzyme was slightly activated after 30-min incubation as the temperature was raised from 30 to 47.5 °C but that its kcat decreased at higher temperatures falling to about 10 s−1 (by 80%) at 50 °C (Fig. 3a). The activity of V62M GST-GCK increased similarly as that of the wild type as the temperature rose but decreased abruptly at temperatures above 42.5 °C. In contrast, the previously reported instability mutant E300K GST-GCK (16.Gloyn A. Odili S. Buettger C. Njolstad P.R. Shiota C. Magnuson M. Matschinsky F. Matschinsky F.M. Magnuson M.A. Glucokinase and Glycemic Diseases: From the Basics to Novel Therapeutics. 16. Karger, Basel, Switzerland2004: 92-109Google Scholar) showed much greater thermolability than the wild type enzyme and was also more unstable than V62M. The stabilizing effect of glucose on each enzyme, WT, E300K, and V62M GST-GCK was also investigated. The instability of the mutants was tested at 42.5 °C, because this was the highest temperature at which point the least variation between the three enzymes was visible during temperature titration. Decreasing or eliminating of glucose in the heat step had no effect on the activity of wild type GST-GCK, however this treatment markedly lowered the activity (kcat) of the instability mutant E300K from about ∼41 to ∼8 s−1. Glucose removal caused a far less pronounced decrease in the activity of V62M GST-GCK from ∼58 to ∼36 s−1 (Fig. 3b). In fact, glucose titration at 42.5 °C and using physiological glucose levels showed that V62M is virtually as stable as wild type. Inhibition with human and rat GKRP was also determined. WT-GST-GCK showed an expected reduction in activity with increasing concentrations of both human (Fig. 4a) and rat (data not shown) GKRP with and without sorbitol-6-phosphate (S6P). However, there was no reduction in enzyme activity for V62M-GST-GCK with either human (Fig. 4, a and b) or rat GKRP (data not shown). Further kinetic"

Whereas STAT3 activation is transient in normal cells, constitutively activated forms of the transcription factor have been detected in several cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Through the up-regulation of cell cycle and survival genes, STAT3 plays important roles in cell growth, anti-apoptosis, and cell transformation yet the molecular basis for this behavior is poorly understood. In this study, we show that STAT3 and its transcriptional cofactors are recruited to the promoter of the Cdc25A gene to activate its expression. Using chromatin immunoprecipitations, we observed that Myc is recruited to this promoter following STAT3 DNA binding. Moreover, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Myc specifically inhibits the STAT3-mediated activation of Cdc25A. Reduction in Myc protein level results in defective recruitment of the CREB-binding protein, Cdk9, and RNA polymerase complexes, indicating that Myc is necessary for STAT3 transcription. Surprisingly, the association of STAT3 with the Cdc25A promoter does not necessarily lead to transcriptional induction because this protein also functions as a transcriptional repressor of the Cdc25A gene. Following hydrogen peroxide stimulation, STAT3 forms a repressor complex with the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor to occupy the Cdc25A promoter and block its induction. In coimmunoprecipitations and ChIP experiments, Rb was found to associate with STAT3 on DNA and we provide evidence that Rb binds directly to the transcription factor. Thus, we propose that Myc and STAT3 cooperate to induce the expression of Cdc25A and that their transcriptional activity is normally regulated by the Rb tumor suppressor gene.

Cell cycle progression relies on the activation of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk), 1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; RT, reverse transcription; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; CBP, CRB-binding protein; IL, interleukin; ROS, reactive oxygen species; Rb, riboblastoma; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. 1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; RT, reverse transcription; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; CBP, CRB-binding protein; IL, interleukin; ROS, reactive oxygen species; Rb, riboblastoma; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. which successively act in G1 to initiate S phase and in G2 to initiate mitosis. Two classes of cyclins get activated during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, D-type cyclins and cyclin E that assemble with their catalytic partner (Cdk4 or Cdk6 for cyclin D and Cdk2 for cyclin E) (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar, 2Matsushime H. Ewen M.E. Strom D.K. Kato J.Y. Hanks S.K. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 323-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Active cyclin/Cdk complexes phosphorylate members of the pocket protein family (Rb, p107, and p130) to release and activate the E2F transcription factor and induce cell cycle progression. Cyclin/Cdk complexes are inhibited by phosphorylation at two sites (Thr-14 and Tyr-15 in Cdk2) that are dephosphorylated by members of the Cdc25 phosphatase family. There are three members of this family designated Cdc25A, Cdc25B, and Cdc25C that can be distinguished by their activity throughout the cell cycle and that positively regulate cell cycle progression by activating successive Cdks. Whereas Cdc25B or Cdc25C regulates the G2-M transition through Cdk1 dephosphorylation, Cdc25A mainly activates Cdk2 and induces progression from G1 to S phase (3Hoffmann I. Draetta G. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Microinjection of Cdc25A antibodies arrests cells prior to S phase, whereas ectopic expression of the phosphatase shortens the G1 phase and accelerates cell cycle progression. Further confirming these functions, Cdc25A has been described as an oncogene because the protein is overexpressed in a wide variety of tumors and cooperates with Ras to induce cell transformation and tumors in mice (4Cangi M.G.

Following mitogen stimulation of quiescent cells, Cdc25A gets activated by E2F but also by other DNA-binding proteins involved in cell cycle progression such as STAT3. STAT proteins are a family of transcription factors that are normally inactive within the cytoplasm and that accumulate in the nucleus upon growth factor stimulation. Whereas STAT3 activation is transient in normal cells, the transcription factor is persistently activated in a large number of tumors as a consequence of aberrant growth factor or tyrosine kinase signaling (6Bromberg J.F.

Using the p21waf1 and myc genes as a model, we have recently shown that STAT3 recruits histone acetyltransferases such as NCoA1/SRC-1a or CBP. In addition, it also associates with BRG1, the ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, and with Cdk9, the elongating kinase of the P-TEFb complex (18Giraud S. Bienvenu F. Avril S.

Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6670-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), the STAT3-mediated regulation of the Cdc25A promoter remains to be elucidated. In this study, we have found that STAT3 and its transcriptional cofactors are recruited to the Cdc25A promoter upon IL-6 stimulation. Interestingly, this cytokine also induced the association of Myc with this promoter. Moreover, small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of Myc prevented the activation of Cdc25A by STAT3, suggesting that the two transcription factors synergize to induce the expression of the phosphatase. Surprisingly, we found that the association of STAT3 with the Cdc25A promoter does not necessarily lead to transcriptional induction. Whereas cytokine stimulation leads to the activation of the gene, reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate STAT3 DNA binding but down-regulates the expression of Cdc25A. Under these conditions, we surprisingly observed that the retinoblastoma protein Rb associates with STAT3 on DNA to form a repressor complex. Thus, we propose that Myc and STAT3 cooperate to induce the expression of Cdc25A and that this effect is inhibited by the Rb tumor suppressor gene to prevent cell cycle progression. Antibodies—Polyclonal anti-STAT3 (C20), anti-phospho-STAT3-Tyr705 (B7), anti-CBP (A-22), anti-Rb (C15), c-Myc (N262), anti-Cdk9 (C20), and type II RNA polymerase (N-20) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-α-tubulin (T9026) was obtained from Sigma. Luciferase Assays—Transient transfections were done using the calcium phosphate precipitation method and repeated at least five times. Cells were plated at a density of 8 × 104 in 6-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. After 36–48 h post-transfection, cells were stimulated with 500 μm hydrogen peroxide for 6 h and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and 300 μl of lysis buffer was added (0.1 m KHPO4, pH 7.8, 0.1% Triton X-100). Luciferase activity was normalized based on protein concentrations and then measured using a Packard Topcount scintillation counter. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4 °C with nuclear or whole cell extracts (1–5 mg) in the presence of 1% Nonidet P-40. Cell extracts were precleared with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (10% slurry in phosphate-buffered saline) for 2 h at 4 °C, and cleared extracts were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 300 mm KCl, 0,2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and one time with 20 mm Tris, pH 8, prior to the addition of sample buffer. Following electrotransfer, membranes were analyzed by Western blot with the indicated antibodies diluted in Tris-buffered saline buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl). Western blot and luciferase assays were performed as described previously (18Giraud S. Bienvenu F. Avril S. Gascan H. Heery D.M. Coqueret O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8004-8011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Northern blot were performed with 20 μg of RNA using human cDNA probes labeled with [32P]dCTP using the random-priming labeling kit from Amersham Biosciences. Pull-down Experiments—Pull-down reactions were performed by incubating purified histidine, His-STAT3 full length, or His-STAT3716–770 (200 ng) with purified GST or GST-Rb proteins (200 ng) in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Brij 96). After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed once with binding buffer, twice with binding buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, and once with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Samples were then analyzed by Western blot. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP)—Cells grown to 60% confluence were serum-starved for 2 days. Following stimulation, cells were washed and then cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were washed sequentially twice with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged, and then resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and sonicated three times for 15 s each. Supernatants then were recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, diluted 3–10 times in dilution buffer I (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and subjected to one round of immunoclearing for 2 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, 2.5 μg of preimmune serum, and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (of 50% slurry). Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight with specific antibodies and then 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (of 50% slurry) were further added for 1 h at 4 °C. Note that the immunoprecipitations are performed in the presence of 1% Nonidet P-40. Immunoprecipitates were washed sequentially for 10 min each in TSE I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), TSE II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). Bead precipitates then were washed three times with Tris borate-EDTA buffer and eluted three times with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. Eluates were pooled and heated at 65 °C overnight to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. Supernatants then were incubated for 1 h at 45 °C with proteinase K (80 μg each), and DNA was precipitated using classical procedures. 5–10 μl from a 50-μl DNA preparation were used for 25–30 cycles of PCR amplifications. The following primers were used: region –2760/–2486, 5′-TTGTGCCACTGCTGACTTTGTC-3′ and 5′-AGCCTGAAGAAGGAGGATGTGAGG-3′, of the p21waf1 promoter; regions –222/–203, 5′-ATTTTGATCCCCGCTCTTCT-3′, and +39/+58, 5′-GAAAACCAAGCCGACCTACA-3′, of the Cdc25A promoter; regions +29362/+29384, 5′-GAAGACCTGAAGAAGTTCCGCAC-3′, and +29541/+29562, 5′-CCCCTCTCCAAATGTCACACAG-3′, of the Cdc25A promoter. Serial ChIP Experiment—Following immunoprecipitation with the first Rb antibody, beads precipitates were prepared as described above and eluted during 4 h at 4 °C with 500 μl of dilution buffer II (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 5–10 μg of a purified GST-Rb fusion protein corresponding to amino acids 379–926). This fusion protein is recognized by the C15 antibody and competes with the endogenous Rb complexes. The supernatants were diluted 1–2 times in dilution buffer I, and immunoprecipitation was done overnight with the second specific antibody. 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (of 50% slurry) were further added for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates and beads then were washed as described above, eluates were pooled and heated at 65 °C overnight to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking, and DNA then was precipitated. Real-time PCR—For ChIP quantification, PCR was performed with 5 μl of DNA and 5 p m primers diluted in a final volume of 5 μl of reaction mixture LightCycler (2239264, Roche Diagnostics GmbH) and 4 mm MgCl2. Accumulation of fluorescent products was monitored by real-time PCR using a LightCycler. Each PCR reaction generated only the expected specific amplicon as shown by the melting temperature profiles of final products (dissociation curve automatically measured by the LightCycler) and by gel electrophoresis of test PCR reactions. STAT3 and Myc Are Recruited to the Cdc25A Promoter upon IL-6 Stimulation—To determine the effect of STAT3 on Cdc25A, HepG2 cells were serum-starved and left untreated or stimulated with IL-6 for 4 h. As described previously (21Fukada T. Ohtani T. Yoshida Y. Shirogane T. Nishida K. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6670-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), Northern blot analysis showed that cytokine or serum stimulation induced the expression of the Cdc25A mRNA (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–3). In parallel, Western blot analysis also indicated that IL-6 up-regulates the expression of the Cdc25A protein (Fig. 1A, lanes 4–6). Because several STAT3 binding sites are located within the Cdc25A proximal promoter, ChIP experiments were then performed. As compared with untreated cells, ChIP experiments indicated that STAT3 was recruited to the proximal Cdc25A promoter upon IL-6 stimulation (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–4). Using real-time PCR analysis, we found that DNA binding reached a maximum after 30 min and then gradually declined (Fig. 1B, lanes 9–12). As a control of DNA sonication efficiency, PCR analysis did not detect any occupancy of a control region located on the p21waf1 promoter (Fig. 1B, lanes 5–8). During the course of these experiments, we noticed that Myc was also induced by IL-6 and that its mRNA became apparent as early as 30 min after cytokine stimulation. By contrast, the Cdc25A mRNA was significantly expressed only after 90–120 min (Fig. 2A, compare middle and top panels). Because Myc binds to the Cdc25A promoter to induce its expression (22Galaktionov K. Chen X.C. Beach D. Nature. 1996; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 23Santoni-Rugiu E. Falck J. Mailand N. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3497-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), this result suggested to us that this transcription factor was involved in the STAT3-mediated activation of Cdc25A. Effectively, ChIP experiments indicated that IL-6 induced the association of Myc with the Cdc25A promoter (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–4). As a control, PCR analysis did not detect any occupancy of the control region (Fig. 2B, lanes 5–8). Importantly, real-time PCR analysis indicated that Myc DNA binding reached a maximum after 90 min when STAT3 binding and nuclear expression had already declined (compare Figs. 1B and 2B, lanes 9–12). We have been unable to detect any association between STAT3 and Myc, further suggesting that the two proteins are not associated on DNA. Altogether, these results indicate that STAT3 and Myc are both recruited to the Cdc25A promoter to induce its activation. Myc Is Involved in the STAT3-mediated Activation of Cdc25A—We then investigated the effect of Myc knockdown on the IL-6-mediated activation of Cdc25A. To this end, we used a doxycycline-inducible expression vector that drives Myc small interfering RNA expression in the LS174T colorectal cell line (24van de Wetering M. Oving I. Muncan V. Pon Fong M.T. Brantjes H. van Leenen D. Holstege F.C. Brummelkamp T.R. Agami R. Clevers H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). As expected, IL-6 induced the expression of Myc in this cell line but this effect was inhibited upon the addition of doxycycline (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–8). To evaluate the effect of Myc on the activation of Cdc25A, LS174T cells were serum-starved, treated or not with doxycycline, and further stimulated with IL-6. Under these conditions, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and Western blot analysis indicated that IL-6 had no significant effect on the expression of Cdc25A in the absence of Myc (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–8 and 9–16). Importantly, the expression of p21waf1 was slightly enhanced, indicating that the inhibition was specific to the Cdc25A gene and confirming that Myc is involved in the down-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitor (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–8, middle panel) (25Herold S. Wanzel M. Beuger V. Frohme C. Beul D. Hillukkala T. Syvaoja J. Saluz H.P. Haenel F. Eilers M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 509-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that STAT3 activates its target genes through its association with the CBP coactivator and the recruitment of the RNA polymerase and the Cdk9-elongating kinase (18Giraud S. Bienvenu F. Avril S. Gascan H. Heery D.M. Coqueret O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8004-8011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 19Giraud S. Hurlstone A. Avril S. Coqueret O. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7391-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To determine whether Myc affects the association of these proteins with the Cdc25A promoter, their recruitment was analyzed by ChIP in LS174T cells pretreated or not with doxycycline. In control conditions, STAT3 DNA binding was associated with the recruitment of Myc, CBP, Cdk9, and RNA polymerase II (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–3). As expected, the association of Myc with the Cdc25A promoter was inhibited when cells were pretreated with doxycycline (Fig. 4A, lanes 4–6). Whereas Myc down-regulation did not affect STAT3 DNA binding, the association of CBP, Cdk9, and RNA polymerase II with the Cdc25A promoter was significantly inhibited (Fig. 4A, lanes 4–6). Moreover, using a pair of primers that covers the exon 13 of the gene, we observed that Myc down-regulation prevented the elongating form of the polymerase from reaching the 3′ region of the gene (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 1–3 and 4–6). In each condition, no occupancy of a control region of the promoter was observed (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the binding of Myc to the Cdc25A promoter is necessary for STAT3 to induce the activation of this gene. STAT3 Does Not Activate the Cdc25A Gene upon Oxidative Stress—To extend our results, we then determined whether the STAT3-mediated activation of Cdc25A was only related to IL-6 stimulation or whether this effect could also be observed with other signaling pathways that induce STAT3 activation. Besides cytokines and growth factors, ROS also function as signal transducers in several systems and can also trigger STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation (26Carballo M. Conde M. El Bekay R. Martín-Nieto J. Camacho M.J. Monteseirín J. Conde J. Bedoya F.J. Sobrino F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17580-17586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 27Benhar M. Engelberg D. Levitzki A. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). To determine whether the transcription factor activates Cdc25A upon oxidative stress, asynchronously growing HepG2 cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide, nuclear extracts were prepared, and STAT3 activation was analyzed. As expected, ROS induced the nuclear translocation of STAT3 and its phosphorylation on the Tyr-705 and Ser-727 residues (Fig. 5A, lanes 1–4). Moreover, ChIP experiments and real-time PCR analysis indicated that STAT3 binds to the Cdc25A promoter upon ROS stimulation (Fig. 5A, lanes 5–7). However, opposite to the effect of IL-6, we surprisingly observed that hydrogen peroxide induced a down-regulation of the Cdc25A mRNA and protein (Fig. 5B, lanes 1–3 and 4–6). Because Myc is involved in the regulation of Cdc25A, we also characterized the effect of ROS on its expression. As expected, Myc was expressed in growing cells but its mRNA was down-regulated by hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 5C, lanes 1–3). Consequently, ChIP experiments indicated that Myc was not associated with the Cdc25A proximal promoter upon oxidative stress (Fig. 5C, lanes 4–6). Thus, we concluded from these results that the binding of STAT3 to the Cdc25A promoter does not necessarily lead to transcriptional activation. Rb Is Recruited to the Cdc25A Promoter to Down-regulate Its Expression—During the course of these experiments, we were able to confirm the effect of IL-6 or ROS on Cdc25A expression in several cell lines such as glioblastoma or colorectal cancer cells (data not shown). However, we noticed that oxidative stress did not inhibit the expression of Cdc25A in human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells (Fig. 6A, lanes 1–3). Importantly, ROS stimulation induced the phosphorylation of STAT3 and its recruitment to the proximal Cdc25A promoter in this cell line (Fig. 6A, lanes 4–6 and 7–8). Moreover, p21waf1 was induced as expected under these conditions, indicating that this effect was specific to the Cdc25A gene (Fig. 6A, lanes 1–3, bottom panel). Because Saos-2 cells lack a functional Rb protein, these results suggested to us that Rb might be involved in the down-regulation of the Cdc25A promoter. To verify this finding, HepG2 or Saos-2 cells were cotransfected with a reporter construct containing the Cdc25A promoter (28Vigo E. Muller H. Prosperini E. Hateboer G. Cartwright P. Moroni M.C. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6379-6395Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of a vector expressing Rb. Following transfection, cells were treated or not with hydrogen peroxide for 8 h and luciferase activity was measured on cytoplasmic extracts. In HepG2 cells, ROS induced a 2-fold decrease in reporter gene activity, which was further repressed in the presence of Rb (Fig. 6B, lanes 1–3). Interestingly, when hydrogen peroxide was added to Saos-2 cells, no repression of the Cdc25A promoter was observed. By contrast, a significant down-regulation of reporter gene activity was noticed in the presence of Rb (Fig. 6B, lanes 4–6). ChIP experiments then were performed to determine whether this protein is associated with the proximal Cdc25A promoter upon oxidative stress. Effectively, real-time PCR analysis indicated that Rb was recruited to DNA when HepG2 cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide. Importantly, this effect was not observed when cells were stimulated with IL-6, suggesting that the binding of Rb to the Cdc25A promoter is ROS-specific (Fig. 6C, compare lanes 1–3 and 4–6). Taken together, these results indicate that Rb is recruited to the Cdc25A promoter to repress its activity upon oxidative stress. Rb Interacts with STAT3 on the Cdc25A Promoter—Because Rb associates with several DNA-binding proteins, we asked whether the tumor suppressor interacts with STAT3 upon ROS stimulation. To this end, HepG2 cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide, nuclear extracts were recovered, and coimmunoprecipitations were performed using polyclonal antibodies directed against Rb or STAT3. In each condition, the endogenous proteins were found to coimmunoprecipitate upon hydrogen peroxide stimulation (Fig. 7A, lanes 3–4 and 6–7). T"

They act to enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Gα subunit but paradoxically have also been shown to enhance receptor-stimulated activation. To study this paradox, we used a G-protein gated K+ channel to report the dynamics of the G-protein cycle and fluorescence resonance energy transfer techniques with cyan and yellow fluorescent protein-tagged proteins to report physical interaction. Our data show that the acceleration of the activation kinetics is dissociated from deactivation kinetics and dependent on receptor and RGS type, G-protein isoform, and RGS expression levels. By using fluorescently tagged proteins, fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy showed a stable physical interaction between the G-protein α subunit and RGS (RGS8 and RGS7) that is independent of the functional state of the G-protein. RGS8 does not directly interact with G-protein-coupled receptors. Our data show participation of the RGS in the ternary complex between agonist-receptor and G-protein to form a “quaternary complex.” Thus we propose a novel model for the action of RGS proteins in the G-protein cycle in which the RGS protein appears to enhance the “kinetic efficacy” of the ternary complex, by direct association with the G-protein α subunit.

The G-protein cycle is initiated by binding of an agonist to its target seven-helical G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; RGS, G-protein signaling; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; GAPs, GTPase-activating proteins; ttp, time-to-peak; PTx, pertussis toxin; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; Tet, tetracycline. 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; RGS, G-protein signaling; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; GAPs, GTPase-activating proteins; ttp, time-to-peak; PTx, pertussis toxin; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; Tet, tetracycline. which associates with a heterotrimeric G-protein on the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane. Once assembled, this “ternary complex” promotes GDP release and stimulates GTP binding on the G-protein α subunit and dissociation of the G-protein subunits Gα-GTP and Gβγ. Both subunits can activate downstream signaling molecules, including enzymes and ion channels (1.Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar, 2.Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins modulate signaling through heterotrimeric G-proteins. Cloning studies have identified a large RGS gene family, each endowed with a conserved RGS domain of 120–130 amino acids that is flanked by N and C termini of varying lengths (3.Koelle M.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 4.De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

By itself, the RGS domain is capable of interacting with G-protein α subunits to accelerate the GTP hydrolysis rate of the Gα subunit, thereby promoting termination of the G-protein signal (3.Koelle M.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 4.De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Based on primary sequence similarities, mammalian RGS proteins have been grouped into five subfamilies (7.Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). In this study we focus largely on RGS8, belonging to the R4 subfamily of RGS proteins that are generally considered prototypical in that they appear to have little function other than to act as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) on Gi/o and Gq/11 G-protein α subunits. However, we also examine RGS7, which belongs to the R7 family, and GAIP, which belongs to the RZ family. RGS7 is particularly interesting because it contains a number of protein-protein interaction domains in the N terminus, but it is of particular relevance for our study because it has a substantially attenuated GAP activity compared with other RGSs (8.Lan K.L. Zhong H. Nanamori M. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33497-33503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).The discovery of the RGS protein family had important ramifications for the study of the G-protein gated K+ channel (GIRK) that was first identified in atrial myocytes and activated by acetylcholine acting at muscarinic M2 receptors (9.Noma A. Trautwein W. Pfluegers Arch. 1978; 377: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Activation of GIRK is responsible, in part, for slowing of the heart rate in response to vagal stimulation (10.Wickman K. Nemec J. Gendler S.J. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 11.Drici M.D. Diochot S. Terrenoire C. Romey G. Lazdunski M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Analogous GIRK currents are present in neurons and neuroendocrine cells (12.Yamada M. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 723-757PubMed Google Scholar). The native channel is a heterotetrameric complex composed of the inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channel subunits, Kir3.1–3.4 (12.Yamada M. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 723-757PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of native and cloned G-protein gated K+ channels has been shown to involve a direct, membrane-delimited interaction with the Gβγ subunit (13.Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1987; 325: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, 14.Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Inglese J. Morales J.M. Iniguez Lluhi J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Bourne H.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). A number of studies have sought to explain why these channels, when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, deactivate more slowly than the native atrial current upon termination of the receptor stimulus. Identification of the RGS family has resolved this discrepancy. For example, expression of RGS4 or RGS8 in X. laevis oocytes accelerates GIRK deactivation kinetics such that the measured time constants are more consistent with those occurring after stimulation of native channels in atrial cells (15.Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 16.Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).A paradox arose, however, because RGS protein expression not only enhanced channel deactivation but also accelerated GIRK activation (15.Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 16.Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RGS expression did not attenuate the overall signal, an effect that would be predicted if the only function of the RGS were to act as a GAP (16.Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 17.Zerangue N. Jan L.Y. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R313-R316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This interesting phenomenon has resulted in a number of new proposals for the mechanism of action of RGS proteins and has important consequences for our understanding of the G-protein cycle. RGS proteins may function as scaffolds to help preassemble signaling complexes of receptor with G-protein, for example (17.Zerangue N. Jan L.Y. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R313-R316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Zhang Q. Pacheco M.A. Doupnik C.A. J. Physiol.

Alternatively, RGS proteins may promote entry into the G-protein cycle by physically aiding the dissociation of Gα-GTP and Gβγ subunits or by encouraging the formation of fast cycling signaling complexes, acting according to a “kinetic scaffolding” mechanism (7.Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 20.Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

Previously, we have presented data showing the importance of the ternary complex in determining the selectivity and kinetics of GIRK activation (22.Leaney J.L. Milligan G. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23.Leaney J.L. Tinker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly stated, this hypothesis ascribes a unique conformation for the complex formed between various combinations of agonist, GPCR, and G-protein, which dictates the speed and efficiency of G-protein activation. This hypothesis is consistent with many of the recent models used to explain GPCR signaling (25.Christopoulos A. Kenakin T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 323-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 26.Kenakin T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 416-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this paper we present data to show that the paradoxical action of RGS proteins on GIRK activation kinetics can be resolved if the RGS enters into the ternary complex to form a “quaternary complex.” Furthermore, based on our FRET studies, we propose a stable physical interaction between the G-protein α subunit and the RGS protein that is independent on the functional state of the G-protein.MATERIALS AND METHODSMolecular Biology, Cell Culture, and Transfection—The human clones of RGS8, RGS7, and GAIP were obtained from the Guthrie cDNA Resource Centre. A PCR-based approach was employed to clone RGS8, RGS7, and GAIP in-frame into pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) by using HindIII and BamHI (RGS8 and GAIP) and XhoI and BamHI (RGS7) as cloning sites. Fluorescently tagged receptors (D2-CFP, A1-CFP, α2A-CFP, and M4-YFP) were constructed by using a similar general approach in the pECFP-N1 and pEYFP-N1 vectors using KpnI and HindIII as the cloning sites. Inducible expression of RGS8-YFP was achieved using the TRex system (Invitrogen). RGS8-YFP was excised from pEYFP-N1 and ligated into pcDNA5/TO with a HindIII/NotI restriction digest. The methods for cell culture and transient transfection and the techniques for establishing stable cell lines with HEK293 cells have been described previously (22.Leaney J.L. Milligan G. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 27.Giblin J.P. Leaney J.L. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22652-22659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). “Quadruple” inducible stable cell lines were established after the transfection of RGS8-YFP in pcDNA5/TO and pcDNA6/TR (both Invitrogen) into the HKIR3.1/3.2/M4 cell line and subsequent selection with 727 μg/ml G418, 364 μg/ml Zeocin, 400 μg/ml hygromycin, and 5 μg/ml blasticidin. In this stable cell line, designated as HKIR3.1/3.2/M4/R8YFP-T, gene expression was conditional upon the addition of the antibiotic tetracycline (Sigma). Treatment of cells with tetracycline (0.01–10 μg/ml) for 24–36 h resulted in graded expression of the fluorescently tagged protein. Goα-YFP and Gsα-CFP were constructed in an analogous fashion to GoαA-CFP (28.Leaney J.L. Benians A. Graves F.M. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28803-28809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Gγ2-CFP was the kind gift from Dr. S. Ikeda. All other plasmids were used as described previously. A CFP-YFP dimer was constructed by cloning an in-frame PCR fragment of enhanced YFP (Clontech) into enhanced CFP-N1 in the XhoI-BamHI sites of the polylinker.Electrophysiology—Whole-cell membrane currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200B amplifier, and data were acquired with a Digidata 1200B interface (both Axon Instruments) and analyzed with pClamp software (version 6.0; Axon Instruments). Cell capacitance was ∼15 picofarads, and series resistance (<10 megohms) was at least 75% compensated using the amplifier circuitry. After an equilibration period of ∼5 min, cells were voltage-clamped at –60 mV; records were digitized at 100 Hz, and agonist-induced currents were measured at this potential. Rapid drug application and removal were achieved as described previously (24.Benians A. Leaney J.L. Milligan G. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10851-10858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29.Leaney J.L. Dekker L.V. Tinker A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 367-379Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30.Benians A. Leaney J.L. Tinker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6239-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Agonist was applied for 20 s. Upon agonist application, the current was activated with an initial lag and then a subsequent rise to peak current amplitude (time-to-peak). Activation kinetics are described as lag + time-to-peak. On removal of the agonist, the current deactivated back to base-line levels. Deactivation was generally well described by a single exponential function, I(t) = A·exp(–t/τ) + C, where A is the current amplitude at the start of the fit; t is time; τ is the deactivation time constant, and C is the steady state asymptote. Curve fitting was performed by using Clampfit software (pClamp version 6.0). After removal of the agonist dopamine from HKIR3.1/3.2/D2 cells, the deactivation phase was found to be better described by the “sum of two exponentials” equation: I(t) = A1·exp(–t/τ1) + A2·exp(–t/τ2) + C. After removal of the agonist adenosine from HKIR3.1/3.2/A1 cells, the deactivation phase was not adequately fit by a single exponential function. Therefore, the measure “time to half-current decay” was used to describe the rate of deactivation. This is defined as the time taken from removal of agonist for the agonist-induced current to deactivate to half its peak value.Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells for imaging were subcultured onto 25-mm glass coverslips or 35-mm culture dishes with integral number 0 glass coverslip bottoms (Mattek) and, if transiently transfected, were allowed 24–48 h to express the protein(s) of interest.Confocal Microscopy—Prior to imaging, a coverslip was placed into a watertight cell imaging chamber at room temperature, and cells were overlaid with HEPES-buffered Opti-MEM without phenol red (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells were imaged by using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal microscope using a 60× Nikon Plan Apo oil objective (1.40 NA). CFP was excited with a 457-nm laser line, and images were obtained using a 470–500-nm bandpass filter. YFP was excited with a 514-nm laser line, and emission was measured between 530 and 570 nm. The FRET imaging conditions were obtained with excitation by using a 457-nm laser line, and emission was measured between 530 and 570 nm. Multiple images were acquired sequentially. Intensities in the CFP, YFP, and FRET set of imaging conditions were determined from membrane-delimited regions of interest drawn by hand at high magnification using the LaserPix software. The background-subtracted intensities were analyzed to determine FRET ratios using three-cube protocols (see below). 16-Bit images were obtained with identical laser powers, photomultiplier gain, and pinhole size and were optimized to examine cells with moderate expression of both constructs. Care was taken to avoid saturating images.CCD-based Fluorescence Microscopy—We also used a standard fluorescent microscope (Nikon TE200 60× Plan Apo oil objective 1.40 NA), equipped with a back-illuminated digital CCD camera (Roper Scientific MicroMax 1024 EB) and high speed CCD detector control, to measure FRET ratios and changes in these ratios with perfusion. Samples were excited by using a mercury lamp with an excitation filter wheel, and emission filters were selected through an emission filter wheel (Sutter Instruments, Lambda-10/2). The following filter sets were used (excitation and emission): YFP (500 ± 10 nm; 535 ± 15 nm), CFP (430 ± 12.5 nm; 465 ± 20 nm), and FRET (430 ± 12.5 nm; 535 ± 15 nm). 16-Bit images were acquired and analyzed with the Universal Imaging Corp. metamorph software (version 6.1). Background values employed were regions containing no cells in the viewing field. 3-Cube parameters and FRET ratios were calculated as above.It worth noting that on both microscopy systems the S.E. of the FRET ratio was less than 5% of the mean, and this compares very favorably with other methods (31.Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Given the different imaging conditions in the two setups, the relationship between FRET efficiency and FRET ratio will be different as it depends on the ratio of the CFP and YFP molar extinction coefficients at the respective excitation wavelength (32.Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Practically, exciting CFP at the suboptimal 457 nm on the laser-scanning confocal microscope leads to a smaller FRET ratio given a particular FRET efficiency.FRET Ratio and Other Calculations—Colocalization ratios were determined using the LaserPix software. The FRET ratio (FR) measures the fractional increase in YFP emission because of FRET and was calculated according to Equation 1 (32.Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), FR=(SFRET(DA)−RD1×SCFP(DA))/RA1×(SYFP(DA)−RD2×SCFP(DA)) (Eq. 1) SCUBE (Specimen) denotes an intensity measurement; CUBE indicates the filter cube (CFP, YFP, or FRET), and Specimen indicates whether the cell is expressing donor (D; CFP), acceptor (A; YFP), or both (DA). RD1 = SFRET(D)/SCFP(D), RD2 = SYFP(D)/SCFP(D), and RA1 = SFRET(A)/SYFP(A) are predetermined constants from measurements applied to single cells expressing only CFP- or YFP-tagged molecules. Three-cube net FRET images are displayed in a number of places and were calculated according to SFRET(DA) – RD1 × SCFP(DA) – RA1 × (SYFP(DA) – RD2 × SCFP(DA)). If the FRET ratio = 1 (i.e. no FRET) then the above equation will equal 0. Any excess signal (i.e. FRET ratio >1) will manifest as increased intensity above background. It is possible to manipulate images on a pixel-by-pixel basis and thus obtain spatial information on the FRET signal. Images were pseudocolored, filtered, and converted to 24-bit RGB files for display (TIFF or JPEG).Data Analysis—Membrane currents were measured at –60 mV, and all data are presented as mean ± S.E., where n indicates the number of cells recorded. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using either Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's post-test where appropriate; * indicates p ≤ 0.05; ** indicates p ≤ 0.01, and *** indicates p ≤ 0.001. Time measurements were reciprocated prior to statistical analysis.Materials and Drugs—Solutions for electrophysiology were as follows (concentrations in mm): pipette solution, 107 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, 5 HEPES, 2 MgATP, 0.3 Na2GTP (KOH to pH 7.4, ∼140 mm total K+); bath solution, 140 KCl, 2.6 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). Cell culture materials were from Invitrogen. The following drugs were made up as concentrated stock solutions and kept at –20 °C: 5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine; adenosine (9-d-ribofuranosyladenine); baclofen hydrochloride; carbachol (carbamylcholine chloride); dopamine hydrochloride; (–)-norepinephrine hydrate (all from Sigma).RESULTSAs in our previous studies (22.Leaney J.L. Milligan G. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23.Leaney J.L. Tinker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5651-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we used a HEK293 stable cell line that expresses the GIRK channel subunits Kir3.1 and Kir3.2A (HKIR3.1/3.2) and dual channel plus GPCR stable lines (adenosine A1, HKIR3.1/3.2/A1; adrenergic α2A, HKIR3.1/3.2/α2; dopamine D2S, HKIR3.1/3.2/D2; muscarinic M4, HKIR3.1/3.2/M4; and the heterodimeric GABA-B1b + GABA-B2, HKIR3.1/3.2/GGB). Cells were studied with the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique, and drugs were applied using a rapid agonist application system.Initial transfection studies were carried out to confirm that RGS8-YFP and RGS7-YFP cDNAs could express functional proteins that mediated effects similar to the untagged protein. Fig. 1A illustrates the effects of expression of RGS8, RGS8-YFP, and RGS7-YFP in a cell line expressing the heterodimeric GABA-B1b/2 receptor. Application of a saturating dose of the appropriate agonist, in this case 100 μm baclofen, rapidly activated an inward K+ current. Activation was characterized by an initial delay (lag) and then a subsequent rise to a peak value (time-to-peak, “ttp”) (the activation kinetics were quantified by lag + ttp). After expression of either RGS8 or RGS8-YFP, there was enhancement of both GIRK activation (Fig. 1B (i)) and deactivation kinetics (Fig. 1B (ii)) by both constructs. Thus RGS8-YFP is functional with effects equivalent to that of the untagged protein: there was no significant difference between RGS8 and RGS8-YFP in the acceleration of activation and deactivation. Saitoh et al. (57.Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Odagiri M. Ichikawa M. Yamagata K. Sekine T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9899-9904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have reported that expression of RGS7 profoundly accelerated activation kinetics but had a much weaker effect on deactivation kinetics. We were able to reproduce this observation, and we also observed that RGS7-YFP had a similar effect (Fig. 1B). Thus, RGS7-YFP is functional with effects equivalent to that of the untagged protein; there were no significant differences between RGS7 and RGS7-YFP in the acceleration of activation and in the failure to accelerate deactivation kinetics (Fig. 1B, (i) and (ii)). We did not find it necessary to coexpress Gβ5 with RGS7 to observe pronounced functional effects and presumably RGS7 complexes with endogenously expressed Gβ5 (33.Witherow D.S. Slepak V.Z. Receptors Channels. 2003; 9: 205-212PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Witherow D.S. Tovey S.C. Wang Q. Willars G.B. Slepak V.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21307-21313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is also known that Gβ5 containing Gβγ complexes can inhibit GIRK channels (35.Lei Q. Jones M.B. Talley E.M. Schrier A.D. McIntire W.E. Garrison J.C. Bayliss D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9771-9776Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and overexpression of this protein would potentially complicate our electrophysiological analysis.We have found previously that with certain agonist/GPCR combinations, the deactivation rate is not determined by the rate of GTP hydrolysis by the G-protein but by processes occurring at the level of the receptor, particularly the agonist-unbinding rate (30.Benians A. Leaney J.L. Tinker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6239-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For example, for the synthetic agonists 5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine at the A1 receptor or quinpirole at the D2S receptor, the deactivation rate was slow and was not altered by overexpression of RGS8 (30.Benians A. Leaney J.L. Tinker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6239-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, with the agonists adenosine and dopamine at their respective GPCRs, the rate of current deactivation was faster and strongly enhanced by RGS8-YFP expression (Fig. 2). We then questioned whether the kinetic effects of RGS8 on activation might be selective for different GPCRs. We examined the effects of RGS8-YFP expression on GIRK channel kinetics in cells stably expressing different GPCRs, in response to fast application and removal of agonists. We have previously used radioligand binding to show equivalent levels of receptor expression in the HKIR3.1/3.2/A1, HKIR3.1/3.2/α2A, and HKIR3.1/3.2/D2 cell lines (24.Benians A. Leaney J.L. Milligan G. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10851-10858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Receptor specificity of channel activation by RGS. A, gallery of representative current traces recorded at –60 mV from stable cell lines as indicated. Control recordings are shown in the top panel, and recordings from cells transfected with RGS8-YFP (1 μg of cDNA) are shown in the lower panel. B, summary of the activation kinetics (i) and deactivation kinetics (ii) for each of the cell lines studied. Numbers are shown in parentheses. RGS8-YFP expression (+RGS8 in figure) had no effect on the rate of channel activation via the A1 and α2A receptors but enhanced activation via the D2, GABA-B1b/2, and M4 receptors. In each cell line there was a significant enhancement of deactivation kinetics. The bar charts show analysis to maximal concentrations of full agonists as follows: A1, 1 μm adenosine; α2A, 3 μm noradrenaline; D2, 10 μm dopamine; GABA-B1b/2, 100 μm baclofen; M4, 100 μm carbachol. Inset shows an expanded view of the activation phase. The arrow indicates the onset of agonist application.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When RGS8-YFP was expressed in HKIR3.1/3.2/M4, HKIR3.1/3.2/D2, and HKIR3.1/3.2/GGB cells, both current activation and deactivation were significantly accelerated upon the application and removal of an appropriate agonist (Figs. 1A and 2). In contrast, in the HKIR3.1/3.2/A1 and HKIR3.1/3.2/α2 cell lines, only deactivation kinetics were accelerated by RGS8-YFP (Fig. 2). In the HKIR3.1/3.2/A1 cell line, basal currents were significantly reduced after RGS8-YFP expression (control, –125 ± 26 pA/pF; +RGS8-YFP, –69 ± 6 pA/pF; p < 0.05, t test), which is consistent with a GAP function. Thus it appears that the effects of RGS8-YFP on the kinetics of current activation are dependent on the GPCR studied. For those GPCRs that exhibit relatively slow GIRK activation, RGS8-YFP can accelerate the kinetics, whereas for those that are intrinsically fast (A1 and α2A), the expression of RGS8-YFP has no effect. Finally, to ensure these observations were not because of YFP tagging the C terminus of RGS8, untagged RGS8 (1 μg) was expressed in the HKIR3.1/3.2/α2A cell line, and the"

Sci. 2004; 29: 265-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). These responses are believed to result from the type of transcriptional coregulators with which the Smads associate in the nucleus. Together with the transcriptional coactivators p300 and CBP, the Smad complex induces gene expression (20.Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 21.Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the Smads are thought to recruit transcriptional corepressors including 5′-TG-3′-interacting factor to inhibit transcription (18.Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar, 22.Wotton D. Massague J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 254: 145-164PubMed Google Scholar). SnoN, ski novel related gene product, belongs to the ski (sloan kettering virus gene product) family of nuclear proteins (23.Liu X. Sun Y. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 24.Luo K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). SnoN has been suggested to exert oncogenic behavior since SnoN overexpression triggers oncogenic transformation of chick and quail embryonic fibroblasts (25.Boyer P.L. Colmenares C. Stavnezer E. Hughes S.H. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 457-466PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that the TGF-β-regulated Smads Smad2 and Smad3 as well as common partner protein Smad4 interact with and recruit SnoN to the Smad binding element within the promoters of TGF-β-responsive genes (26.Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Luo K. Science. 1999; 286: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 27.Suzuki H. Yagi K. Kondo M. Kato M. Miyazono K. Miyazawa K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5068-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Overexpressed SnoN acts as a transcriptional repressor of TGF-β-induced genes (23.Liu X. Sun Y. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F.

The ability of overexpressed SnoN to block TGF-β-induced gene expression and cell cycle arrest is thought to explain how SnoN promotes cell proliferation and transformation (28.He J. Tegen S.B. Krawitz A.R. Martin G.S. Luo K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30540-30547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A generally held view is that SnoN inhibits the basal promoter activity of TGF-β responsive genes (22.Wotton D. Massague J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 254: 145-164PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Liu X. Sun Y. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Stimulation of cells with TGF-β leads to the ubiquitination of SnoN via the Smad2/3-dependent recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase Smurf2 (29.Bonni S. Wang H.R. Causing C.G. Kavsak P. Stroschein S.L.

Cell. 2001; 8: 1027-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). SnoN ubiquitination and its consequent degradation are proposed to remove SnoN-inhibition of the TGF-β signaling pathway (23.Liu X. Sun Y. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F.

A. 1999; 96: 12442-12447Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although the effects of overexpressed SnoN on TGF-β signaling have been characterized, the role of endogenous SnoN in TGF-β signaling remains to be elucidated. Mice in which the SnoN gene is disrupted were reported to be embryonic-lethal, thus precluding analysis of tumorigenesis in these mice (34.Shinagawa T. Dong H.D. Xu M. Maekawa T. Ishii S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2280-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Mice that were heterozygous for the disrupted SnoN gene had an increased incidence of spontaneous and carcinogenic-induced lymphomas (34.Shinagawa T. Dong H.D. Xu M. Maekawa T. Ishii S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2280-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition, SnoN+/- T cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) displayed increased rates of proliferation as compared with the wild type T cells and MEFs, respectively. Collectively, these data suggested that SnoN inhibits cell proliferation and appear to conflict with SnoN overexpression studies (34.Shinagawa T. Dong H.D. Xu M. Maekawa T. Ishii S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2280-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, results of a second SnoN knock-out mouse, in which exon 1 was deleted, did not lead to embryonic lethality and suggested that proliferation of SnoN-deficient cells was impaired due to partial increased sensitivity to endogenous TGF-β (35.Pearson-White S. McDuffie M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5446-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The contrasting data of the two SnoN knock-out studies might have occurred due to either distinct genetic backgrounds of the mice in the two studies or documented cleaved products in the second SnoN knock-out that might inhibit SnoN-related proteins in a dominant negative manner. Therefore, the specific question of the function of endogenous SnoN in the transcriptional and biological responses of epithelial cells to TGF-β remains to be clarified. A powerful approach to study gene function involves the use of RNA interference (RNAi) to knock-down the products of genes of interest (36.Wu W. Hodges E. Redelius J. Hoog C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e17Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 37.Agrawal N. Dasaradhi P.V. Mohmmed A. Malhotra P. Bhatnagar R.K. Mukherjee S.K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 657-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 38.Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). This method is very efficient and specific in reducing target protein levels. In general, responses can be assessed within a relatively short time after knock-down of the target protein in cells, thus obviating the time needed for genetic compensatory mechanisms to appear. In this study we used a DNA-based approach of RNAi against SnoN to characterize SnoN protein functions in TGF-β-induced responses. We show that SnoN knock-down leads to specific blockade of TGF-β-induced transcription in the cell line mink lung epithelial cell (Mv1Lu) but not in HeLa or HaCaT cells. We also demonstrate that SnoN knock-down reduces the ability of TGF-β to induce cell cycle arrest in Mv1Lu cells. These data indicate that endogenous SnoN acts in a cell type-specific manner to mediate TGF-β transcriptional responses and thereby contributes to TGF-β-dependent inhibition of proliferation in epithelial cells. Our findings suggest that SnoN may, thus, exert tumor suppressive effects in specific epithelial cells. Plasmids Construction—The U6/enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) plasmid was constructed by subcloning a CMV-EGFP-PCR fragment amplified from a modified pCMV/EGFP vector into pBS/U6 vector using convenient restriction sites. The SnoN RNAi plasmids U6/snoi-1/EGFP and U6/snoi-2/EGFP were constructed by ligating double-stranded DNA with each strand comprising 22-nucleotide-inverted SnoN sequences intervened by a 6-nucleotide sequence into digested U6/EGFP vector (see Fig. 1A and Refs. 39.Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar el B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar and 40.Gaudilliere B. Shi Y. Bonni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46442-46446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The mouse SnoN2 cDNA, which is identical to the mouse SnoN isoform except for a 138-nucleotide deletion in exon 3, was amplified from IMAGE clone 5387475 and subcloned into a CMV-driven mammalian expression vector. All constructs were confirmed by restriction digests and/or DNA sequence analyses (University of Calgary Core Sequencing Facility). The pBS/U6 and U6/MEF2A RNAi plasmids were provided by A. Bonni, Harvard University, Boston, MA. Cell Lines—Mink Lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu) were cultured in minimum essential medium containing nonessential amino acids and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HeLa, a human cervical carcinoma cell line, HaCaT, a human adult keratinocyte cell line, and 293T cells, a human kidney epithelial cell line, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% FBS. Cells were seeded for experiments as follows: Mv1Lu at 5 × 104, HaCaT at 8 × 104, HeLa at 6 × 104, and 293T at 1 × 105 cells/ml of media. 293T cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method. HaCaT, HeLa, and Mv1Lu cells were transfected with the FuGENE 6.0 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Cell Extract Preparation and Immunoblotting—Three days after transfection, cells were lysed as previously described (41.Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 42.Abdollah S. Macias-Silva M. Tsukazaki T. Hayashi H. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were incubated with TNTE (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100) lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 100 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 100 μg/ml benzamidine chloride, 10 mg/ml antipain, and 50 μg/ml aprotinin) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 25 mm sodium fluoride) for 20 min at 4 °C. Lysates were then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. SDS-protein sample buffer containing dithiothreitol was added to the supernatants, and the samples were boiled for 4 min. The protein content of each sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose membranes were immunoblotted with antibodies against SnoN (H-317, Santa Cruz), GFP (B34, Covance, Cedarlane Laboratory Ltd), and actin (A2066, Sigma) and visualized by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL (Amersham Biosciences) followed by detection using a Fluor-S-Max Imager (Bio-Rad). Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells seeded in a 24-well plate were cotransfected with 3TP-lux, ARE3-lux, or the c-Myc-lux luciferase reporter construct (0.1 μg/well), CMV-β-galactosidase vector (0.05 μg/well), and a SnoN RNAi (U6/snoi or U6/snoi/EGFP), a MEF2A RNAi (U6/MEF2Ai), or control (U6 or U6/EGFP) plasmid (0.05–0.1 μg/well) using the FuGENE 6.0 transfection reagent. A cDNA encoding the forkhead-containing transcription factor FoxH1 (FAST2) in a mammalian expression vector was included in all the ARE3-lux reporter transfections (43.Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). One day post-transfection cells were incubated with 0.2% FBS-containing medium (for the 3TP-lux and ARE3-lux transfections) or 10% FBS containing medium (for the c-Myc-lux transfections) alone or together with 100 pm TGF-β (R&D Systems) for 20 h at 37 °C. 10-μl aliquots of the cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity by incubating with the beetle luciferin substrate (Promega) and measuring the light emitted using a Berthold Luminometer. β-Galactosidase expression in lysates was assayed using O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as the substrate. Arbitrary luciferase activity (expressed in relative light units) was normalized to β-galactosidase activity to control for variations in transfection efficiency. Each experimental condition was carried out in triplicate, and the data are presented as the mean (±S.E.) except where indicated. Experiments were repeated at least, three times. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Mv1Lu cells were lysed using TRIzol lysis reagent (TRIzol; Invitrogen) followed by total RNA extraction and concentration using chloroform and isopropanol/ethanol, respectively. Poly(A)-cDNA was generated by subjecting the mink RNA to reverse transcription using the reverse transcriptase SuperScript II (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT)12–18 (Amersham Biosciences) as the primer. Partial mink SnoN cDNA fragments corresponding to nucleotides 540–1000 of the mouse SnoN mRNA were PCR-amplified using the poly(A)-cDNA template and gene-specific SnoN oligonucleotides, selected for a high percentage of interspecies homology, as the primers. Forward primer 1 (5′-AAGTTGGAGGAGAAAAGAGACTC-3′), forward primer 2 (5′-CACTCCAGCAGATAAACACAG-3′), and the reverse primer (5′-GCTAAACTTCTCCTTCATTTCTTTC-3′) corresponding to nucleotides 460–483, 524–544, and 1034–1056 of the mouse SnoN mRNA, respectively, were used for the amplification of the mink SnoN cDNA. Cell Cycle Analysis—Mv1Lu cells were seeded in a 100-mm dish and transfected with 10 μg/dish of the U6/EGFP control or U6/snoi-2/EGFP vector using the FuGENE 6.0 transfection reagent. Approximately 20 h later, cells from each transfection were trypsinized, diluted 2-fold, and subcultured equally into 2× 100-mm dishes. The following day cells were preincubated for 4 h in 0.2% FBS containing medium and then were either left untreated or stimulated for 18 h with 100 pm TGF-β in 10% FBS-containing medium. Cells were harvested, fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized using 100% ethanol, and incubated with a propidium iodide (PI; Sigma)-RNase A (Roche Applied Science) solution to label total DNA content. Single cells were then analyzed for EGFP and PI-derived fluorescence by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) (The University of Calgary Flow Core Facility). Data acquisition was carried out using Cell-Quest Pro, and the relative distribution of cells in the different phases of the cell cycle was analyzed using Modfit LT (Verity Software House Inc.). Knock-down of SnoN by RNA Interference—The finding that SnoN is ubiquitinated by the TGF-β-induced Smad2/3-Smurf2 or Smad2/3-Cdh1-anaphase-promoting complex ubiquitin ligase complexes suggests that SnoN is an important target of TGF-β-induced signaling. Because overexpressed SnoN displays oncogenic properties in cells, one interpretation of these signaling studies is that endogenous SnoN might impinge negatively on TGF-β responses, including importantly TGF-β-inhibition of cell cycle progression, and that TGF-β triggers the ubiquitination and consequent degradation of SnoN to relieve SnoN-inhibition of TGF-β-induced signaling and cellular responses (23.Liu X. Sun Y. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 24.Luo K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Although the results of overexpressed SnoN are consistent with this hypothesis, the physiological role of SnoN in TGF-β-induced responses remained to be elucidated. To characterize SnoN function in TGF-β-induced responses, we used a plasmid DNA-based template method of RNAi because this method of gene silencing provides specific and efficient means of knocking-down target genes of interest (38.Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 44.Paul C.P. Good P.D. Winer I. Engelke D.R. Nat.

Science. 2004; 303: 1026-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). We generated a construct containing a polymerase III RNA U6 promoter, driving the expression of a short hairpin (hp) RNA against SnoN (Fig. 1A and B, and Refs. 39.Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar el B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar, 47.Miyagishi M. Taira K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, and 48.Miyagishi M. Taira K. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 252: 483-491PubMed Google Scholar). This snoi hpRNA transcript was designed to contain a 22-base pair siRNA stem with the two strands joined by a loop and a 3′ overhang (Fig. 1, A and B). To aid in visualizing snoi hpRNAs-expressing cells, we inserted an EGFP cDNA driven by the CMV promoter into the pBS/U6 vector (“Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 46.Konishi Y. Stegmuller J. Matsuda T. Bonni S. Bonni A. Science. 2004; 303: 1026-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Using this modified vector (U6/EGFP), we generated two SnoN RNAi plasmids, U6/snoi-1/EGFP and U6/snoi-2/EGFP (Fig. 1B). The snoi-1 and snoi-2 hpRNAs were designed to target homologous sequences of the human and mouse SnoN mRNA, respectively, and are different from each other by three nucleotides. To determine the effectiveness and the specificity of the SnoN RNAi plasmids, we carried out immunoblotting analysis of lysates of 293T cells that were transfected with the human or mouse SnoN expression vector alone or together with a SnoN RNAi plasmid or control U6 vector (Fig. 1C). For mouse SnoN, we used an expression vector encoding the alternatively spliced isoform SnoN2 that is the most abundant isoform in mouse and that is identical to SnoN1 except for the absence of nucleotides 1280–1417 (49.Pearson-White S. Crittenden R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2930-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In these experiments we found that the expression of snoi-1 hpRNAs ablated the expression of human SnoN but had little effect on the protein levels of mouse SnoN protein (Fig. 1C, upper panel). On the other hand, the expression of snoi-2 hpRNAs led to a greater than 90% reduction of the mouse SnoN gene product but only modestly reduced the level of human SnoN (Fig. 1C, upper panel). By contrast to the robust knock-down effects of snoi-1 and snoi-2 hpRNAs on human and mouse SnoN protein, respectively, SnoN RNAi had little effect on coexpressed EGFP or endogenous actin protein (Fig. 1C, middle and lower panels). Together, these results indicate that SnoN RNAi leads to the effective and specific knock-down of exogenous SnoN protein. We next determined the effect of SnoN RNAi on the level of endogenous SnoN protein in the mink lung epithelial cell line Mv1Lu, which has been widely used to characterize TGF-β responses. First, we determined if mink SnoN might be the target of snoi-1 or snoi-2 hpRNAs. Because the mink SnoN gene sequence was not available, we carried out reverse transcription-PCR experiments using Mv1Lu-derived mRNA and appropriate SnoN primers (“Experimental Procedures”) to determine the homology between the designed hpRNAs and the target mink SnoN sequences. We isolated and sequenced three amplified fragments of SnoN cDNA containing the sequence of interest using a Mv1Lu poly(A)-enriched cDNA as the template. Through sequence alignment of the mink, mouse, and human SnoN we found that the 22 nucleotides of mink SnoN corresponding to human nucleotides 954–977 differ by only one nucleotide from mouse SnoN (Fig. 2A). Thus, we surmised that mink SnoN should be targeted more effectively by snoi-2 than snoi-1 hpRNAs. To test this idea, we transfected Mv1Lu cells with U6/GFP or the U6/snoi/EGFP plasmids. Transfected Mv1Lu cells were separated from non-transfected cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting or FACS based on EGFP expression. Lysates of sorted EGFP-expressing cells were then analyzed for endogenous SnoN protein steady-state levels by SnoN-immunoblotting. Based on the results of two separate experiments, snoi-2 hpRNA expression reduced the level of endogenous SnoN protein by ∼40–60% as compared with that of EGFP control (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, snoi-1 hpRNAs expression appeared to reduce endogenous SnoN protein by only 10% (Fig. 2Bi). Therefore, these experiments indicate that SnoN RNAi triggered a significant knock-down of endogenous SnoN protein in Mv1Lu cells, with snoi-2 hpRNAs demonstrating greater efficacy than snoi-1 hpRNA in inducing knock-down of endogenous SnoN in these cells. SnoN Knock-down Blocks TGF-β Transcriptional Responses in Mv1Lu Cells—Having characterized the means to acutely knock-down SnoN in cells, we next asked if SnoN knock-down alters TGF-β responses in cells. We first determined the effect of SnoN RNAi on TGF-β transcriptional responses in Mv1Lu cells. Based on previous studies in which the overexpression of SnoN was found to inhibit the Smad signaling pathway and TGF-β-inhibition of cell proliferation (26.Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Luo K. Science. 1999; 286: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 31.Stroschein S.L. Bonni S. Wrana J.L. Luo K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2822-2836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we performed these experiments with the intention of testing the hypothesis that knock-down of SnoN might enhance Smad-dependent transcription. One of the most widely used reporters to measure TGF-β responses in cells is the 3TP-lux reporter gene that contains TGF-β-responsive elements from the promoter of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 gene driving the expression of the firefly luciferase gene (50.Wrana J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2114638639,"We report here the role of one of the less studied members of the family of suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS), namely SOCS-7, in cytokine signaling. We demonstrate that SOCS-7 inhibits prolactin (PRL), growth hormone (GH), or leptin (LEP) signaling mediated through STAT3 and STAT5 in a dose-dependent manner. SOCS-7 also attenuated STAT3 and STAT5 signaling induced by overexpression of JH1, the catalytic subdomain of JAK2. Since SOCS-7 interacted with phosphorylated STAT3 or STAT5, we assumed that SOCS-7 acts at the level of STAT proteins. Indeed, we showed that SOCS-7 inhibits PRL- and leptin-induced STAT5 and STAT3 phosphorylation and prevented the nuclear translocation of activated STAT3. Taken together, our results indicate that SOCS-7 is a physiological dysregulator of PRL, leptin, and probably also GH signaling and that its mode of action is a novel variation of SOCS protein inhibition of cytokine-inducible STAT-mediated signal transduction.

These proteins' modulatory activity is not restricted to the JAK/STAT pathway; it has also been reported for activities mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases, such as c-Kit and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 to -4 (5.Rui L.

The current paradigm attributes the main function of SOCS to the targeting of the affected proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome, although additional mechanisms are also involved (4.Yoshimura A.

The SOCS family consists of eight proteins, termed SOCS-1 through -7 and CIS (cytokine-inducible SH2 protein). Whereas CIS and SOCS-1 through -3 have been studied extensively, others, in particular SOCS-7, have been given much less attention. The latter protein was first discovered by Matuoka et al. (8.Matuoka K. Miki H. Takahashi K. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), who cloned its partial cDNA sequence and called it NAP-4 due to its ability to interact with the adaptor proteins Nck, Grb2 (Ash), and Phospholipase C-γ-1. More recently, full sequences of mouse, rat, and human SOCS-7 have been reported (GenBank™ NM_138657 for mouse; XP_213443 for rat; and see Ref. 9.Martens N. Wery M. Wang P. Braet F. Gertler A. Hooghe R. Vandenhaute J. Hooghe-Peters E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 298: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar for human). The NAP-4 sequence lacks the 127 N-terminal amino acids of SOCS-7 but has an additional segment of 34 amino acids (exon 4). SOCS-7 is constitutively expressed in several tissues, most strongly in the testis and brain (8.Matuoka K. Miki H. Takahashi K. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Recently, SOCS-7 (and SOCS-6) has been shown to interact with IRS-2 and IRS-4 (11.Krebs D.L. Uren R.T. Metcalf D. Rakar S. Zhang J.G. Starr R. De Souza D.P. Hanzinikolas K. Eyles J. Connolly L.M.

However, to date, no report concerning the possible biological role of SOCS-7 has been published aside from our recent work showing that SOCS-7 interacts with the cytoskeleton proteins actin and vinexin and is present in cell membranes (9.Martens N.

This latter finding prompted us to study whether SOCS-7 affects biological activities mediated through the membrane-embedded receptors of three cytokines: GH and PRL, which transduce their signal mainly through the JAK2/STAT5 pathway, and leptin, transducing through JAK2/STAT3. Materials—Recombinant ovine PRL, ovine GH, and human leptin were prepared as described previously (14.Leibovich H. Gertler A. Bazer F.W. Gootwine E. Anim. Reprod.

Anti-SOCS-7 antibody, which also recognizes NAP-4, was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

Molecular weight markers for SDS-PAGE, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham F-12 medium were obtained from Invitrogen or Sigma, and SDS-PAGE reagents were from Bio-Rad. Other materials were from Sigma. Plasmids encoding human NAP-4 and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged SOCS-7 were prepared as described previously (9.Martens N. Wery M. Wang P. Braet F. Gertler A. Hooghe R.

In Vitro Bioassays in Transiently Transfected HEK-293T Cells—The effect of NAP-4- and SOCS-encoding constructs on PRL- and GH-inducible activity was assayed in HEK-293T cells transiently co-transfected with plasmids encoding ovine PRLR or ovine GH receptor, β-galactosidase, and the luciferase reporter gene, the latter controlled by a six-repeat sequence of the lactogenic hormone response element with a STAT5 binding sequence (LHRE) fused to a minimal thymidine kinase promoter (16.Goffin V.

The assay for leptin-inducible activity was carried out similarly using plasmids encoding the long form of hLEPRb and the STAT3-responsive pAH32 luciferase-encoding plasmid. JH1-dependent activity was determined similarly in cells transfected with 35 ng of GST-JH1-encoding plasmid. In all cases, the total amount of DNA was equalized by adding empty pcDNA vector. HEK-293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum as described previously (19.Biener E. Martin C. Daniel N. Frank S.J. Centonze V.E. Herman B. Djiane J. Gertler A. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 3532-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and experiments were carried out in six-well plates. HEK-293T cells were suspended to 125,000 cells/ml, plated at 2 ml/well and left at 37 °C (5% CO2, 95% O2) for 24 h. The transfection mixture, consisting of 1350 ng of the respective DNA, which always included 50 ng of β-galactosidase in Opti-MEM medium (100 μl), and Fugene 6 (6 μl), was preincubated at room temperature for 45 min and then gently added to each well. Cells were then incubated for an additional 24 h, and the respective hormones were added. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined and normalized for β-galactosidase activity and protein content as described previously (18.Ben-Yair L. Slaaby R.

To minimize transfection variability, each experiment was carried out in two or three plates, each containing six experimental treatments (see the legend to Fig. 1). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y190 cells containing the two reporter genes HIS3 and lacZ were transformed with pGBT9-NAP-4 and subsequently subjected to large scale transformations with 60 μg of a human leukocyte cDNA library fused to the Gal4 activation domain (AD) in the pACT2 vector (Clontech through BD Biosciences), according to the two-hybrid system TRAFO protocol (20.Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). The expression of the Gal4-binding domain (BD) fusion protein was verified by Western blot using anti-Gal4-BD antibodies (Clontech), and identification of the interacting proteins was performed as described previously (9.Martens N. Wery M. Wang P. Braet F. Gertler A. Hooghe R. Vandenhaute J. Hooghe-Peters E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 298: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All cDNA inserts encoding interacting proteins were identified by sequencing the whole insert using an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) sequencer. Sequence analysis was performed by on-line BLAST searches. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—HEK-293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding hPRLR or hLEPRb and with 0.5 μg of pCMV-HA-SOCS-7 plasmid DNA (1 μg in total) or empty vector as described above, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described before (9.Martens N. Wery M. Wang P. Braet F. Gertler A. Hooghe R. Vandenhaute J. Hooghe-Peters E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 298: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—HEK-293T cells were transfected with pCMV-HA-SOCS-7 plasmid DNA or empty pcDNA3.1 vector (1.5 μg in total) and leptin or PRL receptor (1 μg) as described above. Six hours post-transfection, cells were transferred to serum-free medium and incubated overnight. After stimulation with 100 ng/ml leptin or PRL for 30 min, cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were extracted using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's directions. Nuclear protein extracts (10 μg) were incubated with [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (2–3 × 104 counts/min), corresponding to the c-cis-inducible element of the human c-fos gene (hSIE, m67 variant, sequences: 5′-GATCCGGGAGGGATTTACGGG-3′ and 5′-CAGCATTTCCCGTAAATCCCTCCCGG-3′) for 20 min at room temperature. For STAT5 EMSA, oligonucleotides corresponding to the GAS element of the β-casein promoter (5′-CAGATTTCTAGGAATTC-3′ and 5′-GGATTTGAATTCCTAGAAATC-3′) were used. Binding buffer contained 50% (w/v) glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 2mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2.5 ng/μl poly(dI-dC). To reach a total volume of 20 μl, 3.5 μl of loading dye (0.25% (w/v) bromophenol blue, 0.25% (w/v) xylene cyanol, 50% glycerol) was added. Competition experiments were performed using a 100-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides that was incubated for 1 h on ice with the nuclear extracts prior to the addition of the labeled probe. Supershift assays were performed with 1 μg of rabbit anti-STAT3 or anti-STAT5 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Normal rabbit serum was used as a control. Samples were electrophoresed on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried, and bands were visualized by autoradiography. Pull-down Experiments—In order to test possible interaction of SOCS-7 and JH1, HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids (1 μg each) encoding GST-JHI and HA-SOCS-7 or HA-SOCS-1. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cell lysates were prepared and incubated with a 50% suspension of GSH-agarose beads for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times, and the bound material was eluted with the sample buffer and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. The complexes were analyzed by Western blotting with rat anti-HA antibodies (clone 3F10; Roche Applied Science) and rabbit anti-SOCS-7 antibodies. Immunocytochemistry—HEK-293T cells (8 × 104) were plated on 13-mm glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (Mr > 80.000, 100 μg/ml; Sigma) in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% (w/v) fetal calf serum per well of a 24-well plate. After overnight incubation, 100 ng of pSVL-STAT3-YFP plasmid DNA was co-transfected with plasmid encoding hLEPR and empty vector (pcDNA 3.1) or SOCS-7-expressing plasmid as described earlier. After 24 h, cells were transferred to serum-free medium and stimulated with 100 ng/ml leptin for different times. Cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and washed three times with PBS. Coverslips were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Labconsult, Genval, Belgium) and viewed using an Axiophot fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). In the initial stage of the present work, two variants of SOCS-7, namely NAP-4 and SOCS-7, were tested for their ability to modulate STAT5-mediated ovine PRL- and ovine GH-inducible signaling as well as STAT3-mediated human leptin-inducible signaling. The respective hormone (ovine PRL, ovine GH, and human leptin) concentrations were chosen to achieve a submaximal response, as determined by preliminary experiments (not shown). The results (Fig. 1) clearly indicate that ovine PRLR-, ovine GH receptor-, and hLEPR-inducible luciferase activity is attenuated in a dose-dependent manner in HEK-293T cells transiently transfected with cDNA encoding either NAP-4 or SOCS-7. In the case of ovine PRL and GH, mediating STAT5 signaling, partial inhibition was already observed in cells transfected with 150 ng of NAP-4 or SOCS-7 (Fig. 1, a and b), and full inhibition was achieved by transfecting with 1000 ng of these constructs. It seems, therefore, that both ovine PRL- and ovine GH-inducible activity can be reduced by low concentrations of either NAP-4 or SOCS-7 (i.e. concentrations below the level of anti-NAP-4 or anti-SOCS-7 antibody detection as judged by Western blotting). The expression of the PRL, GH, and leptin receptors was not affected by co-expression of SOCS-7 (not shown). It should be noted that similar results were obtained using STAT-5-dependent alkaline phosphatase as the reporter gene (not shown). The sensitivity of the leptin R-mediated STAT3 signaling to NAP-4 and SOCS-7 was lower; even with 1000 ng of these constructs, only ∼58 and 62% inhibition was detected, respectively (Fig. 1c). These differences could be partially attributed to the lower expression of NAP-4 and SOCS-7 in these experiments. To further explore the nature of the SOCS-7-dependent inhibition, we also tested whether receptor-independent autophosphorylation (due to overexpression) of the catalytic JH1 subdomain of JAK2 and subsequent activation of STAT5 and STAT3 signaling could be attenuated by SOCS-7. Strong inhibition was indeed observed (Fig. 2), indicating that once JAK2 is phosphorylated, the events affected by SOCS-7 do not require the presence of PRL, GH, or leptin receptors. To test the possible interaction of SOCS-7 and JH1, we have performed a pull-down experiment using HEK 293T cells co-transfected with GST-JH1 and SOCS-7. The experiment was repeated three times. Although the SOCS-7 was identified in the total cell lysate, it was absent in the pull-down extract (not shown). The validity of the method was verified in a control experiment in which SOCS-7 was replaced by SOCS-1. In this experiment, SOCS-1 was found in both total cell lysate and pull-down extract as expected (not shown). To explore the mechanism underlying the inhibition, we first utilized a yeast two-hybrid screen to search for protein partners of SOCS-7, using Gal4-BD-coupled NAP-4 and a Gal4-AD-coupled leukocyte cDNA library as bait (9.Martens N. Wery M. Wang P. Braet F. Gertler A. Hooghe R. Vandenhaute J. Hooghe-Peters E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 298: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The interaction was assayed in S. cerevisiae Y190 yeast cells based on HIS3 and lacZ reporter gene expression, the latter resulting in blue staining in a β-galactosidase production assay in the case of interaction (Fig. 3). One of the isolated clones encoded STAT3α missing 21 nucleotides at the 5′-end. Negative control interactions were tested between Gal4-BD (empty) and STAT3α-AD on the one hand and between Gal4-AD (empty) and NAP-4-BD on the other. The results, indicating an interaction between NAP-4 and STAT3, prompted us to continue this work at the protein level. However, we used only SOCS-7 for these experiments, because it is likely that SOCS-7, and not NAP-4, is the real physiological inhibitor of cytokine signaling. Indeed, in contrast to SOCS-7 (11.Krebs D.L. Uren R.T. Metcalf D. Rakar S. Zhang J.G. Starr R. De Souza D.P. Hanzinikolas K. Eyles J. Connolly L.M. Simpson R.J. Nicola N.A. Nicholson S.E. Baca M. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4567-4578Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), there are no indications of NAP-4 expression. As a first step, we tested whether leptin-inducible STAT3 and PRL-inducible STAT5 phosphorylation could be attenuated by co-transfection with SOCS-7, using FLAG-tagged SOCS-6 as a control. The results clearly showed SOCS-7 dose-dependent inhibition (Fig. 4, a and c), whereas no such inhibition could be seen in cells transfected with SOCS-6 (Fig. 4, b and d), the closest relative to SOCS-7. Since Akt (protein kinase B) is known to be phosphorylated subsequent to ligand stimulation of leptin R (21.Duan C. Li M. Rui L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43684-43691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we tested whether this stimulation could also be attenuated by SOCS-7 and found no inhibition at all (not shown). To further explore the nature of SOCS-7/STAT3 and SOCS-7/STAT5 interactions, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out, showing that the formation of SOCS-7/STAT3 or SOCS-7/STAT5 complexes is clearly dependent on prior PRL- or leptin-induced STAT phosphorylation (Fig. 5, a and b).Fig. 4SOCS-7, but not SOCS-6, inhibits leptin- and PRL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner. HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding human leptin receptor (a and b) or ovine PRL receptor (c and d). Different amounts of SOCS-7 (a and c) or FLAG-SOCS-6 (b and d) cDNA were co-transfected together with empty vector to keep the total amount of cDNA (SOCS + empty) equal to 1.5 μg. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were transferred to serum-free medium and stimulated with either 100 ng/ml human leptin (hLEP; a and b) or ovine PRL (oPRL; c and d) for 30 min as indicated. Cytoplasmic extracts were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine-STAT3 (a and b, upper panel) or STAT5 antibodies (c and d, upper panel). Blots were stripped and incubated with anti-STAT3 (a and b, middle panel) or STAT5 antibodies (c and d, middle panel). Western blotting was also performed with anti-SOCS-7 (a and c, lower panel) or anti-FLAG (b and d, lower panel) antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5SOCS-7 interacts with activated STAT3 and STAT5 in mammalian cells as shown by co-immunoprecipitation. HEK-293T cells were transfected with 0.5 μg/ml HA-SOCS-7 (+) or empty vector (–) and plasmids encoding human leptin receptor (a) or ovine PRL receptor (b). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml hLEP (a) or oPRL (b) for 30 min as indicated. Total cell lysates (TCL) or immunoprecipitates with anti-HA antibodies (IP:αHA) were subjected to Western blot analysis. Endogenously expressed phospho-STAT3 (a) or phospho-STAT5 (b) proteins were co-precipitated with SOCS-7 as shown by Western blotting with anti-phospho-STAT3 (a, upper panel) or anti-phospho-STAT5 (b, upper panel) antibodies. The blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-STAT3 (a, middle panel) or anti-STAT5 (b, middle panel) antibodies. Western blotting with rabbit anti-SOCS-7 γ-globulins was performed to show expression and precipitation of overexpressed SOCS-7 (a and b, lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As a consequence of complex formation between SOCS-7 and phosphorylated STAT3 or STAT5, the DNA binding of both STATs (extracted from the nuclei) was attenuated in a dose-dependent manner. This was documented by EMSA using cells transfected with both PRLR/STAT5 and LEPR/STAT3 and validated by respective supershift experiments (Fig. 6, a and b) performed on nuclear protein extracts. The specificity of the assay was further demonstrated by using cells transfected with SOCS-6·STAT3 and stimulated by leptin in a similar manner (Fig. 6c). Inhibition of nuclear transfer was also demonstrated by using STAT3 tagged with YFP (Fig. 7). HEK-293T cells transfected with STAT3-YFP and SOCS-7 (or empty vector) were stimulated with leptin (100 ng/ml) for up to 2 h. Prior to leptin stimulation, the fluorescence was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus and unaffected by SOCS-7 overexpression. Ten minutes after the addition of leptin, STAT3-YFP was mainly present in a patchy pattern in the nucleus of cells transfected with empty plasmid. In contrast, in cells overexpressing SOCS-7, STAT3-YFP was retained in the cytosplasm. After 30 min of leptin stimulation, the patchy distribution of STAT3 proteins in the nucleus of control cells increased, whereas in most SOCS-7-transfected cells, STAT3-YFP remained spread in the cytoplasm and was hardly seen in the nucleus. Two hours after leptin treatment, the patchy pattern was replaced by diffuse localization in the nucleus of most control cells as well as in SOCS-7-overexpressing cells. The specificity of SOCS-7 was further evidenced by using cells co-transfected with LEPR, STAT3, and either CIS or SOCS-6. In those cells, leptin-induced nuclear translocation of STAT3 was not affected by either CIS or SOCS-6 (not shown).Fig. 7SOCS-7 inhibits leptin-induced nuclear translocation of STAT3. HEK-293T cells were grown on coverslips and co-transfected with plasmids encoding human leptin receptor, YFP-STAT3, along with plasmid encoding SOCS-7 or empty vector. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were transferred to serum-free medium and stimulated with human leptin (100 ng/ml) for 30 min, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed for subcellular localization of YFP-STAT3 proteins using a fluorescence microscope.

This is the first demonstration of the biological activity of SOCS-7, and it is clearly a dose-dependent phenomenon. Considering that its expression is induced by PRL and GH in leukocytes (9.Martens N. Wery M. Wang P. Braet F. Gertler A. Hooghe R. Vandenhaute J. Hooghe-Peters E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 298: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), our present results indicate that SOCS-7 is one of the physiological dysregulators of PRL and GH signaling, at least in those cells. It should be noted that the inhibition occurred already in cells transfected with low amounts of SOCS-7 (150 ng) in which the expression of the SOCS-7 protein was hardly visible, suggesting that SOCS-7 dependent attenuation of PRL-, GH-, and leptin-mediated activity may occur even at low, most likely physiologically relevant levels of SOCS-7 expression. To date, no information on leptin-inducible expression of SOCS-7 has been reported; therefore, the physiological significance of our results is still not clear with respect to this cytokine. However, since many cells express LEPR, PRLR, or GH receptor, PRL- or GH-inducible negative transregulation of leptin activity cannot be excluded. Furthermore, considering that SOCS-7 expression is highest in the testis (6.Krebs, D. L., and Hilton, D. J. (2003) Science STKE 169, PE6Google Scholar) and that leptin, GH, and PRL play important roles in testis physiology (22.Caprio M. Fabbrini E. Ricci G. Basciani S. Gnessi L. Arizzi M. Carta A.R. De Martino M.U. Isidori A.M. Frajese G.V. Fabbri A. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23.Scarabelli L. Caviglia D. Bottazzi C. Palmero S. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 2003; 36: 718-722Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), our findings are indicative of a putative role for SOCS-7 in this organ. Our finding that SOCS-7 also inhibits the activation of STAT5 and STAT3 transduction pathways activated by overexpression of the catalytic JH1 subdomain of JAK2 suggests that SOCS-7-inducible inhibition is mainly, if not entirely, a postreceptor phenomenon. Such inhibition of JH1-inducible STAT5 signaling has also been observed with SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 and, to a certain extent, CIS, but not with SOCS-2 or SOCS-4. 2A. Gertler and Y. Cohen, unpublished data. Interactions of SOCS-1 with JAK2 and its JH1 subdomain are well documented (7.Bayle J. Letard S. Frank R. Dubreuil P. De Sepulveda P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12249-12259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To test whether this inhibition results from direct JH1 and SOCS-7 interaction, we have performed pull-down experiments using GST-JH1 and SOCS-7-HA and got negative results. Since the method was validated with SOCS-1-HA, we can conclude that the inhibition of JH1-inducible STAT5 signaling did not result from direct JH1-SOCS-7 interaction. Our results clearly demonstrate that SOCS-7 prevents in part the phosphorylation of STAT5 and STAT3 (Fig. 4) but also interacts with the phosphorylated form of those proteins (Fig. 5). Those results appear paradoxical, unless SOCS-7 acts in two parallel or successive steps; 1) it blocks in part phosphorylation of STAT5 and STAT3 induced by JAK2 (which becomes phosphorylated due to PRL or leptin stimulation) or by phosphorylated JH1 (which becomes phosphorylated due to overexpression) in a not yet understood manner, and 2) both phosphorylated STATs interact with SOCS-7, and this interaction prevents their translocation to the nucleus. The latter step was documented here by EMSA and respective supershift experiments (Fig. 6) as well as by a determination of the subcellular localization of YFP-STAT3 proteins using fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 7). The interaction between SOCS-7 and STAT3 has also been observed in yeast (see Fig. 3), although STATs most probably cannot be phosphorylated in that system. Therefore, this interaction could be forced by the overexpression of both fusion proteins. The STAT3/STAT5 interaction with SOCS-7 is unique and indicative of a novel variation in SOCS signaling, which has not been reported for other SOCS proteins, namely that SOCS-7 acts as both conventional SOCS and protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS). However, unlike PIAS proteins, which inhibit STATs by either preventing their interaction with DNA or activating translation (25.Shuai K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2638-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), SOCS-7 acts in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, in preliminary experiments, we have observed that in Jurkat T-lymphoma cells stimulated with hIFNα, phosphorylated STAT3 (in contrast to nonphosphorylated STAT3) was immunoprecipitated by anti-SOCS-7 antibodies, whereas no such immunoprecipitation was observed in the absence of hIFNα, 3N. Martens and E. L. Hooghe-Peters, unpublished data. indicating that SOCS-7 and phosphorylated STAT3 interaction is a physiological phenomenon. The SOCS-7/STAT3 interaction leading to attenuation of the latter's nuclear signaling is quite specific, since leptin-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mediated Akt phosphorylation, which is not dependent on STAT3 (21.Duan C. Li M. Rui L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43684-43691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), is not affected by SOCS-7. Since Akt phosphorylation is the final reaction in a chain initiated by SH2-B, a JAK2-interacting protein that promotes activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway by recruiting IRS-1 and IRS-2 in response to leptin (21.Duan C. Li M. Rui L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43684-43691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we also speculate that the putative interaction of JAK2 with SOCS-7 does not preclude its interaction with SH2-B. Thus, the fact that the IRS-2 pathway was not affected suggests that either the reported interaction between SOCS-7 and IRS-2 (6.Krebs, D. L., and Hilton, D. J. (2003) Science STKE 169, PE6Google Scholar) is not biologically relevant, at least in this system, or redundant pathways are available. Our data also do not support suggestions, based on sequence homology and present biochemical observations, that SOCS-6 and SOCS-7 have similar and potentially redundant functions (6.Krebs, D. L., and Hilton, D. J. (2003) Science STKE 169, PE6Google Scholar). Although the nature of the interaction between SOCS-7 and STAT3 or STAT5 is not known, it should be noted that the recognition sites of phosphopeptides for interaction with STAT1 or STAT3 are, respectively, pY(D/E)(P/R)(Q/P/R) and pY(basic/hydrophobic)(P/basic)(Q) (26.Wiederkehr-Adam M. Ernst P. Muller K. Bieck E. Gombert F.O. Ottl J. Graff P. Grossmuller F. Heim M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16117-16128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and that the consensus motif for interaction with STAT5 is pYLX(I/L/V) (27.Barber D.L. Beattie B.K. Mason J.M. Nguyen M.H. Yoakim M. Neel B.G. D'Andrea A.D. Frank D.A. Blood. 2001; 97: 2230-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both human and mouse SOCS-7, in contrast to other SOCSs, contain the YDPQ sequence (aa 554–557), a YIRK sequence (aa 547–550), which, when tyrosine-phosphorylated, is similar to the STAT3 binding motif, and the YLSL sequence (aa 561–564), which is identical to the STAT5 binding motif. Although phosphorylation of SOCS-7 has not been documented, tyrosine phosphorylation of other SOCS factors has been described (28.Cohney S.J. Sanden D. Cacalano N.A. Yoshimura A. Mui A. Migone T.S. Johnston J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4980-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We have also observed SOCS-7 and unphosphorylated STAT5 interaction in a yeast two-hybrid experiments, but this could be due to overexpression. Recently, we reported on an interaction between the cytoskeletal component vinexin and SOCS-7 (9.Martens N. Wery M. Wang P. Braet F. Gertler A. Hooghe R. Vandenhaute J. Hooghe-Peters E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 298: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Since the inhibitory activity of several SOCS factors (SOCS-1, 2, and 3) on GH-induced STAT5 reporter activity is dependent on an intact actin cytoskeleton (29.Rico-Bautista E. Negrin-Martinez C. Novoa-Mogollon J. Fernandez-Perez L. Flores-Morales A. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we suggest that this also may apply to SOCS-7, making it the putative agent linking STAT3 and STAT5 to the cytoskeleton. In conclusion, SOCS-7 is a bona fide suppressor of cytokine signaling. However, it also acts as a protein inhibitor of activated STAT5 and STAT3 and abolishes their translocation to the nucleus. The physiological role of SOCS-7 was most recently confirmed by reporting generation of SOCS-7 knock-out mice (30.Krebs D.L. Metcalf D. Merson T.D. Voss A.K. Thomas T. Zhang J.G. Rakar S. O'Bryan M.K. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Mielke L.A. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15446-15451Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The KO mice were 10% smaller than their wild-type littermates, and a large proportion of them developed hydrocephalus. In situ hybridization studies confirmed prominent expression of SOCS-7 in the brain, suggesting a role for SOCS-7 in this organ (30.Krebs D.L. Metcalf D. Merson T.D. Voss A.K. Thomas T. Zhang J.G.

We demonstrate here that expression of the tetraspanin CD82/KAI1 (a tumor metastasis suppressor) leads to a profound effect on uPAR function. Pericellular plasminogen activation was reduced by ∼50-fold in the presence of CD82, although levels of components of the plasminogen activation system were unchanged. uPAR was present on the cell surface and molecularly intact, but radioligand binding analysis with uPA and anti-uPAR antibodies revealed that it was in a previously undetected cryptic form unable to bind uPA. This was not due to direct interactions between uPAR and CD82, as they neither co-localized on the cell surface nor could be co-immunoprecipitated. However, expression of CD82 led to a redistribution of uPAR to focal adhesions, where it was shown by double immunofluorescence labeling to co-localize with the integrin α5β1, which was also redistributed in the presence of CD82. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that, in the presence of CD82, uPAR preferentially formed stable associations with α5β1, but not with a variety of other integrins, including α3β1. These data suggest that CD82 inhibits the proteolytic function of uPAR indirectly, directing uPAR and α5β1 to focal adhesions and promoting their association with a resultant loss of uPA binding.

Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). The serine protease plasmin is one of the major proteases involved in mediating these rapid and irreversible changes. Plasmin can directly degrade many components of the extracellular matrix, generate bioactive fragments from it, release or activate extracellular matrix-sequestered growth factors, modify other cell-surface proteins, and activate latent matrix metalloproteases (2Ellis V. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 3Bass R. Ellis V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 4Ellis V. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2003; 54: 263-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also emerging that pericellular protease systems, including the plasminogen activation system, communicate closely with cell adhesion systems (5Preissner K.T. Kanse S.M. May A.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 6Chapman H.A. Wei Y. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7Blasi F. Carmeliet P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 932-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Plasmin is a powerful protease with a broad substrate specificity and is generated from its abundant precursor plasminogen in the pericellular environment by the highly specific urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), 1The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; uPAR, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. The ganglioside nomenclature proposed by Svennerholm was followed (Svennerholm, L. (1980) Adv. Exp. Med.

The ganglioside nomenclature proposed by Svennerholm was followed (Svennerholm, L. (1980) Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 125, 11). which is itself generated by proteolytic activation of pro-uPA. The plasminogen activation system represents an enormous proteolytic potential, which is reflected in the multiple levels at which its function is regulated. A central molecule in this regulation is the uPA receptor (uPAR), the high affinity cell-surface receptor for uPA (8Ploug M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2003; 9: 1499-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Binding of uPA to uPAR has two primary effects. First, it greatly amplifies the generation of plasmin activity by promoting the activation of both plasminogen and pro-uPA in a system of reciprocal zymogen activation. Second, as these reactions involve cell-associated plasminogen, uPAR acts to focus the proteolytic activity of this system to the cell surface (9Ellis V. Scully M.F. Kakkar V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2185-2188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ellis V. Behrendt N. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12752-12758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ellis V. J.

These uPAR-dependent interactions also regulate this system at the level of inhibition both directly by the inhibitors PAI-1 and α2-antiplasmin (10Ellis V. Behrendt N. Danø K. J. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 12: 1467-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). uPAR can also potentially direct proteolytic activity to discrete regions of the cell surface, e.g. during cell migration (15Estreicher A. Muhlhauser J. Carpentier J.L. Orci L. Vassalli J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 16Kindzelskii A.L. Laska Z.O. Todd R.F. Petty H.R. J.

As uPAR is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, it is thought that this behavior is dependent on its association with transmembrane proteins. Integrins may fulfill this role, as a number of them have been shown to associate with uPAR, including the fibrinogen receptor αMβ2 (18Xue W. Kindzelskii A.L. Todd R.F. Petty H.R. J.

The interaction of uPAR with some of these integrins has been shown to modulate their function by influencing either their ligand-binding specificity or affinity (20Pluskota E. Soloviev D.A.

However, although it is established that there is communication between these cell adhesion receptors and uPAR, it has yet to be demonstrated that this communication can influence pericellular proteolytic activity. Integrins also associate with other proteins at the cell surface, including the tetraspanin family of transmembrane proteins. Since the observation of the association of the tetraspanin CD9 with the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 (25Slupsky J.R. Seehafer J.G. Tang S.C. Masellis-Smith A. Shaw A.R. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4143-4151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These interactions are selective with respect to both tetraspanin and integrin components and, in some cases, are also cell type-specific. Tetraspanins also associate with themselves and other family members to form complex multimolecular clusters that have been termed the tetraspanin web/tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (27Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 28Hemler M.E. Curr. Opin.

Although the biochemical function of tetraspanins is poorly understood, they are known to influence integrin-mediated adhesion strengthening (30Lammerding J. Kazarov A.R. Huang H. Lee R.T.

Berditchevski F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26323-26326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), both of which could contribute to their involvement in cell migration. Integrin·tetraspanin complexes are found in small clusters at the outermost periphery of migrating cells, but are excluded from focal adhesions (32Berditchevski F. Tolias K.F. Wong K. Carpenter C.L. Hemler M.E. J. Biol.

Odintsova E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Tetraspanin-enriched microdomains include many other proteins, and this has led to tetraspanins being referred to as “molecular facilitators” or “transmembrane adapters” (34Hemler M.E.

We demonstrate here that the role of tetraspanins extends to the regulation of pericellular proteolytic activity, as we have found that expression of CD82 leads to an ∼50-fold reduction in the capacity of the epithelial cell line HB2 to generate plasmin activity. This is due to an effect on uPAR, which, although present on the cell surface, becomes “cryptic,” losing the ability to bind uPA. CD82 achieves this indirectly by promoting stable associations between uPAR and α5β1 integrin concomitant with a redistribution of uPAR to focal adhesions. These data are the first to demonstrate that interaction with cell adhesion systems can regulate uPAR proteolytic function and therefore the existence of bidirectional communication between these two systems fundamentally involved in cellular behavior. Cell Lines, Proteins, and Antibodies—The HB2/zeo and HB2/CD82 cell lines were generated by the respective transfection of pZeoSV (Invitrogen) and pZeoSV/CD82 into the normal mammary epithelial cell line HB2 (45Berditchevski F. Alford D. D'Souza B. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3557-3568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (36Odintsova E. Sugiura T. Berditchevski F. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1009-1012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Zeocin-resistant colonies were pooled (>30 colonies for HB2/zeo cells and >25 colonies for HB2/CD82 cells). The latter pool was subjected to two cycles of fluorescence-activated cell sorting to obtain cells with homogeneous expression of CD82. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 10 μg/ml hydrocortisone. All cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Anti-uPA monoclonal antibody (mAb) clone 5, anti-uPAR mAbs R3 and R4, and rabbit anti-uPAR polyclonal antibody were kindly provided by Dr. Gunilla Høyer-Hansen (Finsen Laboratory, Copenhagen, Denmark), and anti-uPAR polyclonal antibody 399R was from American Diagnostica Inc. (Greenwich, CT). mAb R4 was biotinylated using the EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotinylation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-CD82 mAb M104 was provided by Dr. O. Yoshie (Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan); anti-α5 integrin mAb SAM-1 was a kind gift from CellTech (Slough, UK); and anti-α1 integrin mAb MCA1189 was from Serotec (Oxford, UK). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to α5 and α3 integrins and goat anti-uPA polyclonal antibody AB776 were from Chemicon (Harrow, UK). Secondary antibodies were from Dako (Ely, UK) and Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Lys-plasminogen was from Enzyme Research Laboratories (Swansea, UK). Peptide M25 (24Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) was prepared by solid-phase synthesis. Phosphatidylinositol (PI)-specific phospholipase C was from Roche. Detection of Cell-surface Plasminogen Activation—Plasminogen activation by uPAR-bound uPA on the surface of HB2 cells was determined as described previously (10Ellis V. Behrendt N. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12752-12758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells grown to confluence in 48-well plates were washed with phosphate-buffed saline (PBS) to remove unbound uPA and incubated at 37 °C with Lys-plasminogen (200 nm) and the plasmin-specific fluorogenic substrate H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-aminomethylcoumarin (0.25 mm). Plasmin generated by endogenously bound uPA was measured continuously as change in fluorescence in a SpectraMAX Gemini microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at λ360/440 nm. Plasmin concentration was determined as δF, and plasmin generation is represented as δF versus time by reference to standard curves of active site-titrated plasmin. In some experiments, endogenously bound uPA was removed from the cells by brief treatment in 0.1 m glycine (pH 3) (46Stoppelli M.P. Corti A. Soffientini A. Cassani G. Blasi F. Assoian R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4939-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) prior to incubation with pro-uPA (2 nm) for 20 min at 37 °C and additional washing. The effect of incorporating exogenous gangliosides into HB2 cell membranes was assessed using purified GM1 and GD1a (Calbiochem). These were solubilized in N,N-dimethylformamide or PBS with sonication according to the manufacturer's instructions and incubated with cells at concentrations between 0.5 and 100 μm for 1 or 24 h prior to assay (47Kawakami Y. Kawakami K. Steelant W.F. Ono M. Baek R.C. Handa K. Withers D.A. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34349-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Controls included carrier in the absence of ganglioside. Radioligand Binding—Diisopropyl fluorophosphate-inactivated uPA and anti-uPAR mAb were labeled with Na125I using IODO-BEADS (Pierce) to a specific activity of ∼10 μCi/μg. Radioligand binding assays were performed on monolayers of cells in 24-well plates by competitive displacement with unlabeled ligand as described previously (48Lund L.R. Ellis V. Rønne E. Pyke C. Danø K. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In brief, acid-washed cells were incubated with a fixed concentration of labeled ligand (∼2000 counts/s) and varying concentrations of unlabeled ligand for 20 min at 37 °C. The supernatant was removed for determination of unbound ligand. The cells were then washed three times with the same buffer and lysed in 5 m NaOH, and bound ligand was determined by γ-counting. Data were analyzed both by nonlinear regression of the primary data and by Scatchard analysis. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Specific oligonucleotide primers and fluorogenic probes were designed for uPA and uPAR to allow measurement by quantitative real-time RT-PCR using an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (TaqMan®). To measure uPA antigen levels in serum-containing medium, 96-well plates were coated with anti-uPA polyclonal antibody AB776 at 1:200 dilution in PBS for 12 h at 4 °C, followed by blocking with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Pro-uPA standards (diluted in serum-containing medium) and samples were incubated in the wells for 1 h at room temperature with agitation, followed by incubation with anti-uPA mAb clone 5 (5 μg/ml) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (0.65 μg/ml). Wells were washed three times with PBS and 0.1% Tween 20 in between each step. HRP was detected using tetramethyl benzidine and measured at 450 nm. Chemical Cross-linking and Biotinylation—Cross-linked samples were prepared by the addition of 2 mm disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) in PBS to subconfluent cell monolayers after washing twice with PBS. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with agitation. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by the addition of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were harvested and lysed in the presence of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 as described below. Biotinylated samples were prepared by incubating subconfluent monolayers of cells in 60 μmN-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (Sigma), 20 mm NaHPO4 (pH 8.0), and 130 mm NaCl for 1 h at room temperature with agitation. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 20 mm NaHPO4 (pH 7.5) and 130 mm NaCl containing Complete EDTA-free inhibitors (Roche), and cells were lysed as described below. Preparation of Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—Cell lysates were prepared from subconfluent monolayers. After washing twice with PBS, cells were harvested in PBS containing Complete EDTA-free inhibitors and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) detergent, and inhibitors at 5 × 107 cells/ml. The detergents used were CHAPS, Brij 96, Brij 97, digitonin (10 mg/ml), Nonidet P-40, and Triton X-100. After 30 min on ice, insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Prior to immunoprecipitation, the protein content of the soluble fractions was measured with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractions were precleared by incubation with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h. 100-μl aliquots of precleared samples were incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with the relevant antibody (10 μg of polyclonal antibody 399R, 10 μg of anti-uPAR polyclonal antibody, 10 μl of mAb M104, or 10 μg of mAb SAM-1). Controls without antibody or isotype-matched controls at equivalent concentrations were included and were found to be negative in all cases. 50 μl of 50% (v/v) protein G-Sepharose was added to each sample, and immune complexes were allowed to bind for at least 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer, and adsorbed material was eluted in nonreducing Laemmli sample buffer. For re-immunoprecipitation of biotinylated samples, after washing with the lysis buffer, the protein G-Sepharose was washed further for 12 h at 4 °C in 1% Nonidet P-40-containing lysis buffer. This step was to disrupt interactions between immunoprecipitated uPAR and integrin, releasing protein not directly bound to the antibody·protein G-Sepharose complex into the supernatant (49Serru V. Le Naour F. Billard M. Azorsa D.O. Lanza F. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The supernatants resulting from this were combined with a second antibody or an isotype-matched control. Incubation, washing with 1% Nonidet P-40-containing lysis buffer, and elution were carried out as described above. For Western blotting, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Protein bands were detected by incubation either with the appropriate antibody, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1: 1000 dilution), or, in the case of biotinylated samples, with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (0.1 μg/ml). Visualization was with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Sucrose density centrifugation was performed as described previously (37Odintsova E. Voortman J. Gilbert E. Berditchevski F. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4557-4566Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and fractions were analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Immunohistochemistry—Subconfluent HB2 cell monolayers were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, followed by blocking with 0.1 m glycine in PBS and then 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Antibody incubations were performed with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Primary incubations were carried out for 12 h at 4 °C with 20 μg/ml mAb R4, anti-CD82 mAb M104 (1:25 dilution), or isotype-matched mouse IgG at the same concentration. This was followed by washing with PBS and 0.1% Tween 20. Fluorescein- or Rhodamine Red-X-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was applied at 30 μg/ml, after which the cells were washed as described above. For double labeling with biotinylated mAb R4, cells were then blocked with 5% (v/v) mouse serum, and biotinylated mAb R4 was applied at 20 μg/ml. This was followed by washing and incubation with 5-([4,6-dichlorotriazin-2-yl])fluorescein-conjugated streptavidin at 10 μg/ml. Slides were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Cells were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics and BP465–495 excitation and BA420 emission filters. Images were captured using a CoolSNAP digital camera and Metamorph software. CD82 Decreases Cell-associated Plasminogen Activation—To study the effect of CD82 on uPAR function, the normal human breast epithelial cell line HB2, which expresses essentially undetectable levels of endogenous CD82, was stably transfected with either CD82 (HB2/CD82 cells) or expression vector alone (HB2/zeo cells). CD82 expression in HB2/CD82 cells was >200-fold greater than in HB2/zeo cells, but at a level comparable with other cell lines displaying endogenous expression as determined by quantitative RT-PCR (data not shown). Casein overlay zymography of cell lysates showed that HB2/CD82 cells had much lower amounts of cell-associated plasminogen activator activity compared with control HB2/zeo cells, and the electrophoretic mobility of the activator was consistent with that of uPA (data not shown). These observations and the cell-surface localization of the uPA activity were confirmed by quantitative measurements of cell surface-associated plasminogen activation. In the presence of CD82, the reduction in plasmin generation by endogenously bound uPA approached 50-fold (Fig. 1A). This unexpectedly large effect was not due to reduced expression of uPA in the CD82-transfected cells, as the levels of uPA measured in the conditioned medium by both Western blotting (Fig. 1A, upper inset) and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were equivalent for both cell lines (1.7 ± 0.4 nm versus 1.3 ± 0.3 nm for HB2/CD82 and HB2/zeo, respectively). The expression of PAI-1 was also unchanged (Fig. 1A, lower inset). The expression of these components was also unchanged as determined by quantitative RT-PCR (data not shown). To confirm that endogenous uPA was not limiting in these experiments, endogenously bound uPA was removed from both cell lines by washing at low pH, and the cells were subsequently saturated with exogenously added uPA. This led to a similar differential in cell-associated uPA activity as observed originally (Fig. 1B). CD82 Decreases uPA Binding—These observations suggested either that HB2/CD82 cells bound less uPA or that bound uPA was less active. This was investigated by radioligand binding analysis using 125I-labeled uPA. Fig. 2A shows that, subsequent to removal of endogenously bound uPA, both cells lines bound uPA with the same affinity (Kd = 1.5 nm), but that HB2/CD82 cells had a greatly reduced binding capacity. The affinity of this binding is consistent with the uPA/uPAR interaction, and it could be competed by anti-uPAR mAb. Therefore, these data demonstrate that the presence of CD82 reduces plasminogen activation by reducing the binding of uPA to uPAR. CD82 Interferes with the uPA/uPAR Interaction—The reduced binding of uPA to HB2/CD82 cells suggested reduced levels of uPAR in these cells, but uPAR expression was found to be unchanged as assessed by both"

Accordingly, constitutive processing of p100, caused by the loss of its C-terminal processing inhibitory domain due to nfκb2 gene rearrangements, is associated with the development of various lymphomas and leukemia. In contrast to the physiological processing of p100 triggered by NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and its downstream kinase, IκB kinase α (IKKα), which requires the E3 ligase, β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP), and occurs only in the cytoplasm, the constitutive processing of p100 is independent of β-TrCP but rather is regulated by the nuclear shuttling of p100. Here, we show that constitutive processing of p100 also requires IKKα, but not IKKβ (IκB kinase β) or IKKγ (IκB kinase γ). It seems that NIK is also dispensable for this pathogenic processing of p100. These results demonstrate a general role of IKKα in p100 processing under both physiological and pathogenic conditions. Additionally, we find that IKKα is not required for the nuclear translocation of p100. Thus, these results also indicate that p100 nuclear translocation is not sufficient for the constitutive processing of p100.

NF-κB represents a collection of dimeric transcription factors composed of members of the Rel family with five closely related DNA binding proteins: RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, NF-κB1/p50, and NF-κB2/p52 (1Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar, 2Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev.

Whereas the three Rel proteins are synthesized directly as mature proteins, p50 and p52 are generated by proteolytical processing from their large precursors p105 and p100, respectively (4Fan C.M. Maniatis T. Nature. 1991; 354: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 5Betts J.C. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6363-6371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In resting cells, NF-κB dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm as latent complexes with a family of ankyrin repeat domain-containing inhibitors called IκB proteins (1Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar, 2Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev.

Interestingly, both p105 and p100 contain ankyrin repeats at their C-terminal regions and function as IκB-like inhibitors of NF-κB (6Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israel A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 7Mercurio F. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Whereas the IκB degradation and p100 processing are inducible, the processing of p105 is constitutive (8Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 9Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the signaling leading to NF-κB activation can be classified into two major pathways, the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways, which are based on inducible IκB degradation and p100 processing, respectively (10Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3290) Google Scholar). The canonical NF-κB pathway is required for fundamental functions of various cells and can be rapidly and transiently activated by a plethora of substances, such as mitogens, cytokines, and microbial components (11Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3446) Google Scholar). These stimuli ultimately lead to activation of a specific IκB kinase (IKK) 1The abbreviations used are: IKK, IκB kinase; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; β-TrCP, β-transducin repeat-containing protein; HA, hemagglutinin; IB, immunoblotting; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. complex composed of two catalytic subunits, IKKα (IKK1) and IKKβ (IKK2), and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ (NEMO) (10Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3290) Google Scholar). Once activated, IKK phosphorylates specific serines within the IκB proteins, triggering their ubiquitination by the β-TrCP ubiquitin ligase and degradation by the 26 S proteasome, thus allowing the NF-κB dimers to move to the nucleus to induce gene expression (10Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3290) Google Scholar). Whereas IκB degradation predominantly depends on IKKβ and IKKγ, IKKα is largely dispensable for this event (10Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3290) Google Scholar), although the nuclear function of IKKα is necessary for the transcription activity of NF-κB (12Yamamoto Y.

Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In contrast, activation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway is strictly dependent on the IKKα and its activator NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) but independent of IKKβ and IKKγ (9Xiao G. Harhaj E.W.

Furthermore, under normal conditions, this novel NF-κB pathway only occurs in certain cell types at certain stages and responds to very limited stimuli (9Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol.

NIK then in turn activates IKKα and recruits it into p100 complex via the serine 866 and serine 870 of p100 (22Xiao G. Fong A. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30099-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar).

Constitutive processing of p100 has also been found in various lymphomas associated with nfκb2 gene rearrangements (15Xiao G. Civijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S-C.

Interestingly, such genetic alterations always result in generation of C-terminally truncated p100 proteins lacking the processing inhibitory domain (9Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 25Sun S-C. Xiao G. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 405-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Importantly, these C-terminal truncation mutants of p100 show oncogenic ability in vitro, and overexpression of p52 in the absence of p100 in p100 knock-in mice causes marked gastric and lymphocyte hyperplasia and early postnatal death of mice (26Ciana P.

Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 999-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These findings strongly suggest that deregulated processing of p100 contributes to human malignancies, particularly the lymphomas and leukemia (25Sun S-C. Xiao G. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 405-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggested that the physiological and pathogenic processing of p100 is regulated by both common and different mechanisms (20Qing G. Qu Z. Xiao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). While NIK-mediated p100 processing depends on β-TrCP, constitutive processing of p100 is independent of this protein and is regulated by p100 nuclear shuttling (23Fong A. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22111-22114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 24Qu Z. Qing G. Xiao G. J. Biol.

On the other hand, Tax-induced processing of p100 involves both mechanisms (20Qing G. Qu Z. Xiao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Qu Z. Qing G. Xiao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44563-44572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, under all these conditions, the processing of p100 is generally regulated by a ternary domain of p100 consisting of both its N- and C-terminal sequences (20Qing G. Qu Z. Xiao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here, we provide both genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrating that the constitutive processing of p100 also requires IKKα but not IKKβ or IKKγ, suggesting another common mechanism for p100 processing. However, NIK, the activator of IKKα for inducible p100 processing under physiological conditions is not involved in constitutive processing of p100. We also find that IKKα and p100 phosphorylation are dispensable for p100 nuclear shuttling. It seems that p100 nuclear expression is not sufficient, though required, for constitutive processing, since the constitutive processing forms of p100 translocate into the nucleus of IKK null cells but defective in processing. Additionally, the phosphorylation-deficient mutants of the p100 constitutive processing forms fail to undergo processing, although they are still expressed in the nucleus. Expression Vectors and Antibodies—Expression vectors encoding p100 and its C-terminal deletion mutants (p100-(1–665) and p100-(1–454)), IKKα, HA-tagged NIK and its C-terminal mutant (NIK-c), have been described before (9Xiao G.

The IKKα Phosphorylation Serines of p100 Are Essential for Its Constitutive Processing—Although we have demonstrated that IKKα is required for p100 processing induced by both NIK and Tax (14Senftleben U.

For this study, the N-terminal IKKα phosphorylation serines within p100, which play an essential role in inducible processing of p100 (22Xiao G. Fong A. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30099-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 24Qu Z. Qing G. Xiao G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 18-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Among them, LB40 and HuT-78 proteins are expressed by the rearranged nfκb2 gene in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and T cell lymphoma, respectively (32Migliazza A. Lombardi L. Rocchi M.

Gelinas C. Rabson A.B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2335-2344PubMed Google Scholar). The constitutive processing of these p100 constructs and their serine-alanine mutants was examined. Consistent with our previous studies (9Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 20Qing G. Qu Z. Xiao G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 44563-44572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), these p100 proteins exhibited constitutive processing (Fig. 1B, odd lanes). Importantly, substitutions of the IKKα phosphorylation serines with alanines efficiently prevented their constitutive processing (Fig. 1B, even lanes), suggesting a positive role of IKKα in constitutive processing of p100. IKKα, but Not IKKβ or IKKγ, Is Required for Constitutive Processing of p100—To further confirm the significance of IKKα in the constitutive processing of p100, we expressed LB40, HuT-78, and p100-(1–665) in IKKα–/– MEFs. As a control, the wild-type, IKKβ–/– and IKKγ–/– MEFs were also included. As expected, LB40, HuT-78, and p100-(1–665) exhibited highly constitutive processing in the wild-type, IKKβ–/– and IKKγ–/– MEFs (Fig. 2A). In contrast, these p100 mutants showed a significant defect in constitutive processing in IKKα–/– MEFs (Fig. 2B, lanes 2–4). Importantly, reexpression of IKKα could rescue the constitutive processing of these mutants in the IKKα–/– MEFs (Fig. 2B, lanes 6–8). Consistent with previous studies (9Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar. 14Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M.

Collectively, these results provide both biochemical and genetic evidence for an essential role of IKKα in p100 constitutive processing. Therefore, besides p100 itself, IKKα is another nexus for both constitutive and inducible processing of p100. NIK Is Not Involved in Constitutive Processing of p100—We have recently shown that both IKKα and its upstream kinase NIK play an essential role in physiological processing of p100, although NIK is not required for Tax-induced p100 processing (9Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 14Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). It is thus very interesting and important to investigate the role of NIK in the constitutive processing of p100. Since the C-terminal portion of NIK (NIK-c) is known to function as a potent inhibitor of NIK (15Xiao G. Civijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S-C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 29Xiao G. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21081-21085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), p100-(1–665) together with an increasing amount of NIK-c was expressed in 293 cells. Consistent with our previous studies (15Xiao G. Civijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S-C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), NIK-c could efficiently block NIK-induced p100 processing (Fig. 3A, compare lane 3 with lane 2). However, NIK-c had no effect on constitutive processing of p100-(1–665) (compare lane 5 with lane 4). To further confirm this result, we also examined the processing of p100-(1–665), HuT-78, and LB40 in NIK Aly/Aly MEFs, which express mutated NIK protein and show defects in inducible p100 processing (9Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 16Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W. Karin M. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Immunity. 2002; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Consistent with the result of the blocking assays above, p100-(1–665) still underwent efficient processing in the NIK Aly/Aly MEFs (Fig. 3B, lane 8). Similarly, HuT-78 and LB40 also showed efficient processing in these mutant MEFs (lanes 6 and 7). These results strongly indicate that NIK is not required for constitutive processing of p100. Nevertheless, these results are consistent with the fact that the constitutive processing of p100 does not require external stimuli. IKKα Is Dispensable for p100 Nuclear Shuttling—A recent study suggested that the constitutive processing of p100 is regulated by p100 nuclear shuttling (28Liao G. Sun S.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4868-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), although the role of IKKα in this event is still unknown. For this study, we performed immunofluorescence assays. In agreement with this previous study (28Liao G. Sun S.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4868-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), p100-(1–665) was primarily located in the nucleus (Fig. 4, upper panel 2), although full-length p100 was only expressed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, upper panel 1). Disruption of IKKα phosphorylation sites did not affect the nuclear translocation of this p100 mutant (upper panel 3). Consistently, this p100 mutant was also able to move into the nucleus of IKKα-deficient cells (upper panel 4). Similarly, mutation of IKKα phosphorylation sites or deficiency of IKKα did not alter the nuclear expression of other p100 C-terminal deletion mutants (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that IKKα and it-mediated phosphorylation are not required for p100 nuclear shuttling. Constitutive processing of p100 due to the loss of its C-terminal processing-inhibitory domain contributes to tumorigenesis, it is therefore important to define the molecular mechanism regulating this pathogenic event. In this study, we have demonstrated that the constitutive processing of p100 is specifically regulated by IKKα and it-mediated phosphorylation of p100. We have also demonstrated that IKKβ/IKKγ and NIK, which are essential for canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways, respectively, are not involved in this pathogenic event. Furthermore, we have shown that IKKα is dispensable for p100 nuclear translocation, further suggesting that the nuclear shuttling is not sufficient for its constitutive processing. Although processing of p100 is usually tightly controlled, this proteolytic event could be efficiently activated at least by NIK, Tax, and the loss of the C-terminal portion of p100. While NIK-mediated p100 processing is dependent on the E3 ligase β-TrCP, constitutive processing of p100 C-terminal deletion mutants does not require this ligase but rather is regulated by the nuclear shuttling of p100 (23Fong A. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22111-22114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 24Qu Z. Qing G. Xiao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44563-44572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Liao G. Sun S.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4868-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). On the other hand, both β-TrCP-dependent and -independent mechanisms contribute to Tax-induced processing of p100 (24Qu Z. Qing G. Xiao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44563-44572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Despite these differences, common mechanisms regulating p100 processing also exist. For example, p100 processing under all these situations is controlled by its cis-acting domain (20Qing G. Qu Z. Xiao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have demonstrated an essential role of IKKα in the constitutive processing of p100 using both biochemical and genetic approaches (Figs. 1 and 2). These data clearly indicate another general mechanism for regulation of p100 processing, since IKKα is also required for NIK- and Tax-induced p100 processing (14Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 15Xiao G. Civijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S-C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). It seems that IKKα-mediated phosphorylation of p100 is to trigger recruitment of ubiquitin ligase(s) and subsequent ubiquitination of p100 (20Qing G. Qu Z. Xiao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Xiao G. Fong A. Sun S.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 44563-44572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the β-TrCP ubiquitin ligase, known to be involved in inducible processing of p100, is not required for constitutive processing of p100 (20Qing G. Qu Z. Xiao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Fong A. Sun S.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 44563-44572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that another yet-to-be identified ubiquitin ligase may be involved. In support of this idea, we have shown that IKKα is also required for β-TrCP-independent ubiquitination and processing of p100 induced by Tax (15Xiao G. Civijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S-C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 24Qu Z. Qing G. Xiao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44563-44572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the constitutive processing of p100 requires proteasome (9Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), although the ubiquitination and processing of the constitutive processing forms of p100 is weak and slow, compared with the inducible ubiquitination and processing of p100 (9Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 23Fong A. Sun S.C. J. Biol.

It appears that the unidentified ligase is located in the nucleus, since the β-TrCP-independent p100 processing is regulated by p100 nuclear shuttling, and β-TrCP-dependent processing only occurs in the cytoplasm (20Qing G. Qu Z. Xiao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Clearly, efforts should be focused on identification of this ligase in the future.

https://openalex.org/W2050839675,"Heat shock (HS) activates mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Although prior exposure to nonlethal HS makes cells refractory to the lethal effect of a subsequent HS, it is unclear whether this also occurs in MAP kinase activation. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of a heat pretreatment on MAP kinase activation by a subsequent HS and to elucidate its possible mechanism. Preheating did not make BEAS-2B cells refractory to extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation by a second HS but accelerated their inactivation after HS. The rapid inactivation of ERK and JNK was dependent on de novo protein synthesis and associated with the up-regulation of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). Moreover, the inhibition of phosphatase activity reversed this rapid inactivation. MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) expression was increased by HS, and the presence of its phosphorylated form (p-MKP-1) correlated with the observed rapid ERK and JNK inactivation. Blocking induction of p-MKP-1 with antisense MKP-1 oligonucleotides suppressed the rapid inactivation of ERK and JNK in preheated cells. HSP70 overexpression caused the early phosphorylation of MKP-1. Moreover, MKP-1 phosphorylation and the rapid inactivation of ERK were inhibited by blocking HSP70 induction in preheated cells. In addition, MKP-1 was insolubilized by HS, and HSP70 associated physically with MKP-1, suggesting that a chaperone effect of HSP70 might have caused the early phosphorylation of MKP-1. These results indicate that preheating accelerated MAP kinase inactivation after a second HS and that this is related to a HSP70-mediated increase in p-MKP-1. Heat shock (HS) activates mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Although prior exposure to nonlethal HS makes cells refractory to the lethal effect of a subsequent HS, it is unclear whether this also occurs in MAP kinase activation. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of a heat pretreatment on MAP kinase activation by a subsequent HS and to elucidate its possible mechanism. Preheating did not make BEAS-2B cells refractory to extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation by a second HS but accelerated their inactivation after HS. The rapid inactivation of ERK and JNK was dependent on de novo protein synthesis and associated with the up-regulation of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). Moreover, the inhibition of phosphatase activity reversed this rapid inactivation. MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) expression was increased by HS, and the presence of its phosphorylated form (p-MKP-1) correlated with the observed rapid ERK and JNK inactivation. Blocking induction of p-MKP-1 with antisense MKP-1 oligonucleotides suppressed the rapid inactivation of ERK and JNK in preheated cells. HSP70 overexpression caused the early phosphorylation of MKP-1. Moreover, MKP-1 phosphorylation and the rapid inactivation of ERK were inhibited by blocking HSP70 induction in preheated cells. In addition, MKP-1 was insolubilized by HS, and HSP70 associated physically with MKP-1, suggesting that a chaperone effect of HSP70 might have caused the early phosphorylation of MKP-1. These results indicate that preheating accelerated MAP kinase inactivation after a second HS and that this is related to a HSP70-mediated increase in p-MKP-1.

It is one of the most ancient and evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways from unicellular organisms like brewers' yeast to complex organisms such as humans (1.Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B.

MAP kinases regulate many cellular activities, which range from gene expression to mitosis, movement, metabolism, and apoptosis. These MAP kinases are activated by the dual phosphorylations of neighboring threonine and tyrosine residues in response to various extracellular stimuli (7.Woessmann W. Meng Y.H. Mivechi N.F. J.

HSPs are a group of proteins that range in molecular mass from 8 to 110 kDa and appear to confer protection against a wide range of cellular and tissue injuries. As molecular chaperones, HSPs have the capacity to bind to folded intermediates and misfolded or denatured proteins and prevent their irreversible denaturation. Furthermore, HSPs assist in the renaturation and correct refolding of misfolded proteins (15.Frydman J. Hohfeld J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 16.Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3090) Google Scholar, 17.Johnson J.L. Craig E.A.

Moreover, cells were found to acquire transient resistance to the lethal effect of exposure to HS by prior exposure to a nonlethal HS (18.Gerner E.W. Schneiderm M.J.

However, it is unclear whether preheated cells are refractory to MAP kinase activation by a subsequent HS; very little is known about the mechanisms involved.In this study, we found that preheating did not make cells refractory to ERK and JNK activation by a second HS but rather that it accelerated their inactivation. Moreover, this rapid inactivation was dependent on de novo protein synthesis. HS increased MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) expression, and its phosphorylated form (p-MKP-1) was found to be associated with this rapid ERK and JNK inactivation. MKP-1 phosphorylation and the rapid inactivation of ERK were inhibited by blocking HSP70 induction in preheated cells. These results support the conclusion that preheating accelerated MAP kinase inactivation after a subsequent heat treatment and that this accelerated inactivation is related to a HSP70-mediated increase in p-MKP-1.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Normal human bronchial epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, were maintained as a monolayer in a keratinocyte growth medium (Invitrogen). NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 60 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2.Reagents—Rabbit polyclonal anti-JNK and anti-MKP-1 antibodies, goat polyclonal anti-actin antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-HSP70 antibody, and recombinant glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK and anti-phosphorylated ERK antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Lipofectamine 2000 was purchased from Invitrogen. Cycloheximide (CHX), okadaic acid, sodium orthovanadate, and protein G-Sepharose beads were obtained from Sigma. The ECL kit was from Amersham Biosciences. Protease inhibitors were purchased from Roche Applied Science. The proteasome inhibitor N-carbobenzoxyl-Leu-Leu-Leu-leucinal (MG132) was obtained from the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan), and ATP was supplied by Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). The PP2A assay kit was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI).HS Treatment—In all experiments, HS response was induced by incubating cells in a water bath at 43 °C. After initial HS treatment, the culture medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium. Cells were allowed to recover in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for the indicated times.Western Blot Analysis—Twenty micrograms of protein were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk, PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h before being incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted 1:1,000 in 5% skim milk, PBS, 0.1% Tween 20. The membranes were then washed three times in 1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies diluted 1:2,000 in 5% skim milk, PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. After successive washes, the membranes were developed using an ECL kit.Kinase Assay—JNK activities were assessed using an in vitro kinase assay as previously described (24.Yoo C.G. Lee S. Lee C.T. Kim Y.W. Han S.K. Shim Y. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5416-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In brief, JNK1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-JNK1 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in a kinase buffer containing 0.5 μg of glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun and 0.2 mm ATP. The kinase reaction products were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 10% gels followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane and analysis by Western blot.Transduction of Adenoviruses—Recombinant adenovirus vectors encoding HSP70 sense or antisense RNA were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Sherman (Department of Biochemistry, Boston University Medical School) and Dr. Dick Mosser (Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada). A recombinant adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase (Ad-β-gal) was used as a control virus. Cells were plated at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well tissue culture plate. After overnight incubation, cells were transduced at multiplicities of infection of 50 by adenovirus vector in a keratinocyte growth medium for 2 h with gentle shaking and then washed with PBS and incubated with medium at 37 °C, 5% CO2 until use. After 24 h, the cells were used in the experiments indicated.Antisense Experiments—BEAS-2B cells were transiently transfected with antisense (5′-ccCACTTCCATGACCAtgg-3′) or sense (5′-ccATGGTCATGGAAGTggg-3′) phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides of the MKP-1 gene as reported previously (25.Kiemer A.K. Weber N.C. Fürst R. Bildner N. Kulhaneck-Heinze S. Vollmar A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) (phosphorothioate modifications are shown by lowercase letters). Oligonucleotides were used in a final concentration of 0.03 μg/12-well plate. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's specifications. After 3 h, the cells were used in the experiments indicated.RESULTSHeat Pretreatment Did Not Prevent HS-induced MAP Kinase Activation but Accelerated Its Inactivation—To determine the impact of HS on MAP kinases, we first analyzed the time-dependent activation of MAP kinases by HS. Phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) was hardly detectable in the basal state. p-ERK started to increase at 30 min after HS and increased further with prolonged exposure to HS up to 2 h (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, HS did not affect the total ERK expression level (Fig. 1A). The time course of HS-induced JNK activation was similar to that of ERK activation (Fig. 1A). The same amounts of JNK1 in immunoprecipitates were confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). We next explored whether the HS-induced activation of MAP kinases is suppressed in cells rendered thermotolerant. The time-dependent effect of preheating on the activation of these MAP kinases by a subsequent HS was investigated. ERK and JNK activities were both increased by exposure to 2-h HS, and this was unaffected by preheating, thus suggesting that preheating did not block the HS-induced activation of MAP kinase (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the rate of ERK and JNK inactivation during the recovery period after HS was more rapid in preheated cells than that in nonpreheated cells (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, the increase in phosphorylated MEK-1 was sustained for 4 h after HS in preheated cells (Fig. 1B). Thus, it appears unlikely that the rapid inactivation of upstream activators is responsible for the short duration of MAP kinase activation in preheated cells. Taken together, events occurring downstream of MAP kinase activation may be required for the accelerated inactivation of MAP kinase in preheated cells.Rapid MAP Kinase Inactivation by Preheating Required de Novo Protein Synthesis—We evaluated whether rapid inactivation of MAP kinase in preheated cells is dependent on de novo protein synthesis. As shown in Fig. 1, ERK and JNK activities were higher than at base line at 4 h after HS in nonpreheated cells, whereas at this time they had returned to basal levels in preheated cells. Thus, we evaluated the duration of MAP kinase activation by comparing MAP kinase activities at 4 h after HS. Increased ERK and JNK activities at 4 h after HS were unaffected by CHX treatment in nonpreheated cells (Fig. 2A). However, in preheated cells, whereas ERK and JNK activities returned to base line at 4 h after HS, their activities remained high in the presence of CHX (Fig. 2A). The inhibition of de novo protein synthesis by CHX treatment was confirmed by the suppression of HSP70 induction by HS (Fig. 2A). Moreover, treatment with CHX alone did not activate ERK (Fig. 2B). These findings indicate that de novo protein synthesis is required for the accelerated inactivation of MAP kinase in preheated cells.Fig. 2The increased rate of MAP kinase inactivation by preheating was dependent on de novo protein synthesis.A, blocking de novo protein synthesis abrogated the accelerated inactivation of MAP kinase. BEAS-2B cells were exposed to 1 h of HS and allowed to recover for 4 h (Pre-HS1/4) in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (CHX;10 μg/ml). Cells were heat-shocked for 2 h and allowed to recover for 4 h (HS2/4) in the presence or absence of CHX. B, CHX did not affect MAP kinase activity. BEAS-2B cells were treated with CHX for the indicated times. ERK and JNK activities were assayed by Western blot analysis for its phosphorylated form (p-ERK) and by immune complex kinase assays, respectively. Results are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)HSP70 Induction Was Associated with the Rapid Inactivation of MAP Kinase by Preheating—HSPs are representative proteins induced by HS and have been suggested to be responsible for thermotolerance. Thus, HSP70 accumulation during the preheating may be associated with accelerated MAP kinase inactivation. Indeed, preheating enhanced HSP70 induction by the subsequent HS (Fig. 2A). In order to determine the role of HSP70, we first evaluated the effect of HSP70 overexpression on the rate of MAP kinase inactivation. To express HSP70 at high levels, we infected cells with an adenovirus construct encoding HSP70 sense RNA (Ad-HSP70) or control adenovirus (Ad-β-gal). The overexpression of HSP70 was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A). The increase in p-ERK was sustained for 4 h after HS in Ad-β-gal-infected cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, p-ERK began to decrease at 2 h after HS and further decreased at 4 h after HS in Ad-HSP70-infected cells (Fig. 3A), thus suggesting the role of HSP70 in the accelerated inactivation of MAP kinase. To further confirm the relationship between HSP70 and the rate of MAP kinase inactivation, HSP70-overexpressing cells were made by stably transfecting a plasmid encoding HSP70 into NIH3T3 cells. p-ERK was up-regulated 30 min after HS to a similar degree in both mock-transfected and HSP70-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the HS-induced p-ERK increase was sustained for 2 h after HS in mock-transfected cells; in contrast, it returned to base line 2 h after HS in HSP70-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3B). The overexpression of HSP70 was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). To confirm the association between HSP70 and ERK inactivation, we evaluated the effect of blocking HSP70 induction on the time-dependent ERK inactivation. HSP70 induction was inhibited by adenovirus vectors expressing HSP70 antisense RNA (Ad-AS-HSP70). p-ERK returned to base line 8 h after HS in Ad-β-gal-infected cells; in contrast, it persisted up to 8 h after HS in Ad-AS-HSP70-infected cells (Fig. 3C). The induction of HSP70 was effectively suppressed by Ad-AS-HSP70 infection (Fig. 3C). These findings suggest that HSP70 induction is necessary for rapid MAP kinase inactivation.Fig. 3HSP70 induction was associated with rapid MAP kinase inactivation by preheating.A, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of HSP70 promoted ERK inactivation after HS. BEAS-2B cells were infected with adenovirus vectors expressing HSP70 (Ad-HSP70) or control adenovirus (Ad-β-gal). After 24 h, cells were exposed to heat for 2 h (HS2) and then allowed to recover at 37 °C for 0, 1, 2, or 4 h. B, ERK inactivation after HS was faster in HSP70-overexpressed NIH3T3 cells than in mock-transfected cells. Stably transfected NIH3T3 cells with plasmid encoding HSP70 (HSP70) or control vector (Neo) were exposed to 43 °C for 30 min (HS 0.5) and allowed to recover for 0, 1, 2, or 4 h. C, blocking of HSP70 induction delayed ERK inactivation. BEAS-2B cells were infected with adenovirus vectors expressing HSP70 antisense RNA (Ad-AS-HSP70) or Ad-β-gal. After 24 h, cells were exposed to heat for 2 h (HS2) and then allowed to recover at 37 °C for 0, 4, or 8 h. Total cellular extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis for p-ERK, HSP70, and actin. Results are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition of Phosphatase Activity Suppressed the Increased Rate of MAP Kinase Inactivation by Preheating—MAP kinase activity is mainly determined by the kinetic control balance between activating kinases and inactivating phosphatases (26.Sun H.

To check whether inactivating phosphatase(s) are involved in the rapid MAP kinase inactivation in preheated cells, the effects of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate (SV), and of the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid (OA), on the rate of MAP kinase inactivation were investigated. OA alone did not affect p-ERK expression levels, but it caused a mild increase in p-ERK at 4 h after HS. In contrast, SV alone significantly increased the base-line p-ERK, and it did not enhance the HS-induced increase in p-ERK (Fig. 4A). After adding SV or OA, ERK and JNK activities did not return to base line 4 h after the second HS in preheated cells (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that SV- and/or OA-sensitive phosphatase(s) are responsible for accelerated MAP kinase inactivation.Fig. 4Rapid inactivation of MAP kinase by preheating was reversed by inhibition of phosphatase activity.A, phosphatase inhibitors increased the HS-induced ERK activation. BEAS-2B cells were pretreated with OA (60 nm) or SV (1 mm) for 1 h. Cells were exposed to heat for 2 h and then allowed to recover at 37 °C for 4 h (HS2/4) in the presence or absence of OA or SV. B, phosphatase inhibitor abrogated the accelerated inactivation of MAP kinase by preheating. BEAS-2B cells were pretreated with OA or SV as described in A. Cells were exposed to HS for 1 h and allowed to recover at 37 °C for 4 h (Pre-HS1/4). After incubation at 43 °C for 2 h, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h (HS2/4) in the presence or absence of OA or SV. p-ERK, total ERK (ERK), and actin were assayed by Western blot analysis. JNK activities were assayed by in vitro immune complex kinase assay. Results are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Induction of Phosphorylated MKP-1 Was Correlated with the Rapid Inactivation of MAP Kinase by Preheating—We tried to identify the heat-inducible phosphatase(s) for accelerated inactivation. Untreated cells had a high basal level of PP2A expression, but this was not altered by exposing cells to 43 °C for 10, 30, 60, or 120 min (Fig. 5A). When heat-treated cells were allowed to recover, PP2A expression did not change after 4 (Fig. 5A) or 24 h (data not shown). Moreover, an HS did not affect the level of PP2A expression in preheated cells (Fig. 5A). To confirm that PP2A activity was stable during the HS and recovery processes, we measured the phosphatase activity of PP2A. The phosphatase activity of PP2A did not change either in nonpreheated or preheated cells (Fig. 5B). MKP-1 was not detected at base line or at 2 h after HS. However, MKP-1 was detected when cells were allowed to recover for 4 h after HS in nonpreheated and preheated cells, thus suggesting that a certain recovery time is required for MKP-1 induction (Fig. 5C, lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9). MKP-1 was detected as one band in nonpreheated cells and in preheated cells that were not allowed to recover (Fig. 5C, lanes 3 and 5). In contrast, in cells that were allowed to recover for 4 or 24 h after preheating, MKP-1 contained slowly migrating bands in addition to rapidly migrating bands (Fig. 5C, lanes 7 and 9). The increased HSP70 expression persisted up to 24 h after HS (Fig. 5C). These slowly migrating bands were confirmed to be p-MKP-1 by immunoprecipitation with anti-MKP-1 antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphoserine antibody (Fig. 5D). ERK and JNK activities were reduced to base line 4 h after HS when preheated cells were allowed recovery times of 4 or 24 h, which coincided with p-MKP-1 detection (Fig. 5C, lanes 7 and 9). Thus, a recovery period of more than 4 h after preheating is required to accelerate MAP kinase inactivation and the phosphorylation of MKP-1. OA or SV pretreatment suppressed the increased rate of MAP kinase inactivation by preheating (Fig. 4B). Both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated MKP-1 induction was inhibited in preheated cells upon OA or SV treatment (Fig. 5E). These results suggest that p-MKP-1 is probably associated with accelerated MAP kinase inactivation.Fig. 5p-MKP-1 was correlated with the rapid inactivation of MAP kinase.A, HS did not increase PP2A expression. BEAS-2B cells were incubated at 43 °C for 0, 10, 30, 60, or 120 min and allowed to recover at 37 °C for 0, 1, or 4 h (top). Cells were exposed to 43 °C for 1 h (Pre-HS1) and were incubated at 37 °C for 0, 4, 8, 12, or 24 h. After incubation at 43 °C for 2 h, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h (HS2/4) (bottom). B, heat treatment did not increase phosphatase activity of PP2A. Cells were exposed to HS for 1 h and allowed to recover at 37 °C for 4 h (Pre-HS1/4), and then cells were exposed to heat for 2 h (HS2) and then allowed to recover at 37 °C for 0, 2, or 4 h. Phosphatase activities were assayed using the PP2A assay kit according to the manufacturer's specifications. C, p-MKP-1 induction was correlated with the rapid inactivation of ERK and JNK. BEAS-2B cells were exposed to HS for 1 h (Pre-HS1) followed by a recovery period for 0, 4, or 24 h. Cells were exposed to 43 °C for 2 h and allowed to recover for 0 or 4 h. D, the upper band of MKP-1 was serine-phosphorylated. Preheated (Pre-HS1/4) or nonpreheated BEAS-2B cells were exposed to HS for 2 h followed by 4 h of recovery (HS2/4). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-MKP-1 antibody and then were immunoblotted with anti-MKP-1 or anti-phosphorylated serine antibody. E, OA- or SV-pretreated BEAS-2B cells were treated as in Fig. 4B. Total cellular extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis for PP2A, MKP-1, HSP70, and actin. ERK and JNK activities were assayed by Western blot analysis for its phosphorylated form and by immune complex kinase assays, respectively. Results are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Phosphorylated MKP-1 Was Responsible for Rapid MAP Kinase Inactivation—MKP-1 has been reported to be a labile protein that is normally degraded via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. It is also known that its phosphorylation reduces its ubiquitination and degradation (29.Brondello J.M. Pouysségur J. McKenzie F.R.

Thus, if p-MKP-1 induction is responsible for accelerated MAP kinase inactivation by preheating, then the up-regulation of MKP-1 by proteasome inhibition should also accelerate this inactivation. p-MKP-1 expression was up-regulated 6 h after treating with MG132, without affecting ERK or JNK activity (Fig. 6, A and B). Moreover, MG132 pretreatment did not affect the HS-induced activations of ERK and JNK (Fig. 6A). However, increases in the activities of ERK and JNK 4 h after HS were completely abrogated by MG132 pretreatment (Fig. 6B), suggesting that up-regulated p-MKP-1 is involved in accelerated MAP kinase inactivation after HS. Interestingly, MG132-induced MKP-1 was decreased by HS (Fig. 6A). To confirm that the preheating-induced acceleration of MAP kinase inactivation is associated with MKP-1 induction, we investigated whether the preheating-induced acceleration of MAP kinase inactivation was suppressed by blocking MKP-1 induction. To block MKP-1 induction, we used MKP-1 antisense oligonucleotide, which (partially) blocked MKP-1 induction (Fig. 6C)"

The A. aeolicus TadA dimeric structure is completely different from the tetrameric structure of yeast CDD1, which deaminates mRNA and cytidine, but is similar to the dimeric structure of yeast cytosine deaminase. However, in the A. aeolicus TadA structure, the shapes of the C-terminal helix and the regions between the β4 and β5 strands are quite distinct from those of yeast cytosine deaminase and a large cavity is produced. This cavity contains many conserved amino acid residues that are likely to be involved in either catalysis or tRNA binding. We made a docking model of TadA with the tRNA anticodon stem loop. The bacterial tRNA adenosine deaminase (TadA) generates inosine by deaminating the adenosine residue at the wobble position of tRNAArg-2. This modification is essential for the decoding system.

Inosine (Fig. 1A) was found at the first (“wobble”) position of the tRNA anticodon 40 years ago (1Holley R.W. Everett G.A. Madison J.T. Zamir A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2122-2128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crick postulated (2Crick F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 19: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar) that inosine is able to pair with U, C, and A. The codons corresponding to each inosine-bearing tRNA are synonymous, which contributes to decreasing the number of isoacceptor tRNAs (3Marck C. Grosjean H. RNA. 2002; 8: 1189-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, the wobble positions of eight cytoplasmic tRNAs (seven in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) bear inosine (4Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), which is generated by the posttranscriptional hydrolytic deamination of adenosine (5Auxilien S. Crain P.F. Trewyn R.W. Grosjean H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 437-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In most bacteria and plant chloroplasts, only tRNAArg-2 (Fig. 1B) has the inosine modification (4Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The enzymes that catalyze inosine generation were cloned recently (6Gerber A.P. Keller W. Trends Biochem.

In eukaryotes, a heterodimeric enzyme composed of two sequence-related subunits (Tad2p/ADAT2 1The abbreviations used are: ADAT, adenosine deaminase acting on tRNA; TadA, tRNA adenosine deaminase; CDA, cytidine deaminase; CD, cytosine deaminase; GD, guanine deaminase; MES, 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid. and Tad3p/ADAT3) is responsible for this modification (6Gerber A.P.

In most bacteria and plant chloroplasts, a tRNA adenosine deaminase (TadA) edits the adenosine residue at the wobble position of tRNAArg-2 (7Wolf J. Gerber A.P. Keller W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3841-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). TadA shares homology with Tad2p and is considered to form a homodimer. TadA contains the consensus motif (C/H)XEXnPCXXCofthe cytidine deaminase (CDA) superfamily, which includes diverse deaminases acting on bases, nucleosides, nucleotides, and nucleic acids (8Betts L.

The only solved structure of a deaminase acting on polymeric nucleic acids is that of yeast CDD1 (12Xie K. Sowden M.P. Dance G.S. Torelli A.T. Smith H.C. Wedekind J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Based on the available structures, molecular models of other deaminases acting on nucleic acids has been made and their substrate recognition modes have been reported (12Xie K. Sowden M.P. Dance G.S.

In this study, we solved the crystal structure of TadA from Aquifex aeolicus at a 1.8-Å resolution. This is the first structure of a deaminase acting on tRNA. TadA forms a dimer, whereas the yeast CDD1 forms a tetramer. We made a docking model of TadA with tRNA. Protein Preparation—The A. aeolicus tadA gene was PCR-amplified from the genomic DNA and subcloned into pET28b (Novagen) between the NdeI and SalI sites. The recombinant protein consists of the 151 amino acid residues from A. aeolicus TadA and 20 additional vector-encoded His tag residues (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH) at the N terminus for affinity purification. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) CodonPlus (Stratagene) was transformed with the plasmid. For protein overexpression, the cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6 and then the expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. The cells were harvested and sonicated in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and a protease inhibitor mixture, Complete EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science). The insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was heat-treated at 72 °C for 20 min to denature the E. coli proteins. The heat-treated mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a 10-ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow (Qiagen) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 1.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The protein was eluted in one step with 20 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, and 1.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Four volumes of 20 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol were added to the eluate to reduce the NaCl concentration to less than 100 mm, and then this solution was loaded onto a UnoS column (Bio-Rad) using an ÄKTA system (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–0.5 m NaCl in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Two peaks appeared in the chromatogram. Each peak fraction was individually diluted and loaded onto the UnoS column again. Both elution patterns were the same as the first elution. Two peaks appeared at the corresponding salt concentrations. The two-peak fractions were mixed and dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 400 mm NaCl and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The final purity of the protein was > 95% as monitored by SDS-PAGE, and 1 mg of protein was obtained per liter of LB medium. Crystallization and Data Collection—Prior to crystallization, the protein was concentrated to 8.4 mg/ml by ultrafiltration. For crystallization, the hanging drop vapor diffusion method was used by mixing 1 μl of the protein solution with 1 μl of 50 mm MES-NaOH buffer (pH 5.6) containing 200 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5% polyethylene glycol 8000 and equilibrating the mixture against 500 μl of the reservoir solution composed of 45 mm MES-NaOH buffer (pH 5.6) containing 400 mm NaCl, 180 mm KCl, 9 mm MgCl2, and 4.5% polyethylene glycol 8000 at 20 °C. Crystals were grown in 3 days to dimensions of ∼0.5 × 0.3 × 0.15 mm3. The diffraction data set of the crystal was collected at beamline BL26B1 at SPring-8 (Harima, Japan) to a 1.8-Å resolution. Before flash-cooling, the crystal was transferred into a cryoprotective solution composed of 55 mm MES-NaOH buffer (pH 5.6) containing 35% (v/v) glycerol, 220 mm KCl, 11 mm MgCl2, and 5.5% polyethylene glycol 8000. The data were processed and reduced using the HKL2000 program (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The crystal (space group P21; unit-cell parameters, a = 43.2 Å, b = 152.0 Å, c = 54.1 Å, β = 113.4°) contains four molecules per asymmetric unit with a solvent content of 41%. Phase Determination and Structure Refinement—We solved the structure by the molecular replacement method. The initial model was the N-terminal 94 amino acid residues of yeast cytosine deaminase (CD) (Protein Data Bank code 1UAQ), and its sequence was replaced by the sequence of A. aeolicus TadA by the 3D-PSSM server. The N-terminal amino acid residues (Met15-Val108 of yeast CD and Leu7-Ile98 of A. aeolicus TadA) share 31% sequence identity (Fig. 2). We carried out molecular replacement using the program MOLREP (20Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4153) Google Scholar, 21Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Three monomers were found and were first subjected to rigid body refinement using the data set up to a 2.5-Å resolution. After several rounds of Cartesian coordinate energy minimization, simulated annealing, and B factor refinement using the program CNS (22Adams P.D. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Brunger A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5018-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) as well as manual revision and building of the model using the program O (23Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar), R and Rfree decreased to 34.6 and 36.7%, respectively. Two of the three monomers formed a dimer, so we used this dimer as a search model and repeated the molecular replacement. Two dimers then were found, and the structure refinement was performed in the same way using the data set from a 50.0–1.8-Å resolution. The model refinement finally converged to an R value of 19.8% and an Rfree value of 24.8% with good stereochemistry. A Ramachandran plot analysis using the program PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthor M.W. Moris A.L. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showed that 89.8% of the residues are in the most favored regions and 10.2% are in the additionally allowed regions. Data collection and model-refinement statistics are shown in Table I. The electron density of the main chain was clear for all of the TadA residues with the exception of the partially disordered residues Pro119-Asn122 and the two C-terminal residues. In addition, 3, 8, and 9 of the 20 vector-encoded His tag residues were visible at the N terminus in molecules A, B, and C, respectively.Table IData collection and model-refinement statisticsData collectionSpace groupP21Unit-cell parametersa = 43.2 Åb = 152.0 Åc = 54.1 Åβ = 113.4°Resolution range (Å)50.0-1.8Unique reflections56,975Redundancy (last shell)3.1(1.7)Completeness (%) (last shell)96.5(77.7)I/σ (last shell)19.1(2.0)Rsym (%) (last shell)aRsym = Σhkl Σj|Ij(hkl) - 〈Ij(hkl)〉|/Σhkl ΣjI(hkl), where Ij(hkl) and 〈Ij(hkl)〉 are the intensity of measurement j and the mean intensity for the reflection with indices hkl, respectively.7.7(17.6)Structure RefinementNo. of reflections: working set/test set54,092/2,883No. of protein atoms4,972No. of water molecules520No. of ion atoms4Rfactor (%): working set/test setbRfactor = Σ|Fobs - kFcalc|/ΣhklFobs, where k is a scale factor and Rfree is the Rfactor for the test set of reflections not used during refinement (5% data set).19.8/24.8R.m.s. bonds (Å)0.007R.m.s. angles (°)1.3a Rsym = Σhkl Σj|Ij(hkl) - 〈Ij(hkl)〉|/Σhkl ΣjI(hkl), where Ij(hkl) and 〈Ij(hkl)〉 are the intensity of measurement j and the mean intensity for the reflection with indices hkl, respectively.b Rfactor = Σ|Fobs - kFcalc|/ΣhklFobs, where k is a scale factor and Rfree is the Rfactor for the test set of reflections not used during refinement (5% data set). Open table in a new tab Structure Determination—We determined the crystal structure of A. aeolicus TadA at a 1.8-Å resolution by the molecular replacement method. The crystal contains four molecules, A, B, C, and D, per asymmetric unit (Fig. 3, A and B). The root mean square deviations of all of the atoms are 1.14, 1.06, and 0.75 Å when comparing A with B, C, and D, respectively. The monomer structure (Fig. 3A) consists of a central β-sheet (β1–β5) with two α-helices (α1, α5) on one side of the sheet and three α-helices (α2–α4) on the other side. Α long loop exists between the β4 and β5 strands and is designated as the β4–β5 loop (residues Lys104-Arg124). Zinc Ion—In the Fo – Fc Fourier map contoured at a 9-σ level, each of the monomers contained one strong spherical density, which was assigned as a zinc ion based on the x-ray absorption fine structure data (Fig. 4). Because no zinc ion was added in the buffer during the protein purification and crystallization, A. aeolicus TadA contains endogenous zinc ions. The zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated (Fig. 3, A and C) by His52 Nδ1 (2.1 Å), Cys82 Sγ (2.3 Å), Cys85 Sγ (2.3 Å), and a water molecule, Water O (2.3 Å). Glu54 O∈ interacts with the zinc-bound water (2.5 Å) (Fig. 3, A and C). These residues are conserved among the CDA superfamily members (Fig. 2). The active-site architectures are also similar within the CDA superfamily (8Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 635-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 9Johansson E. Mejlhede N. Neuhard J. Larsen S.

A. 2004; 101: 8114-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and the deamination mechanisms may be the same. The zinc ion and Glu54 are proposed to activate the zinc-bound water to form a hydroxide ion. Glu54 may shuttle a proton from the water to the adenosine residue. The zinc-bound hydroxide ion is proposed to attack the C6 atom of the adenosine residue (Fig. 1A) nucleophilically. Dimerization State of TadA—In the crystal, molecules A-B and molecules C-D form two apparent dimers along the noncrystallographic 2-fold axes (Fig. 3B). Each dimer is almost spherical with the exception of the C-terminal protrusions and the zinc-containing cavities (Fig. 3D). The dimerization interface is mainly composed of helices α3 and α4 and the β4–β5 loop. The interface is extensive and buries 1300 Å2 of the total monomer surface area of 8100 Å2. Thirty residues are involved in the dimerization including eight conserved hydrophobic residues (Met55, Ile58, Met84, Ala88, Val112, Phe113, Ile115, and Leu121). In addition, four intersubunit salt bridges are formed between Glu44 O∈ and Lys68 Nζ (2.5 Å) and between Asp48 Oδ and Lys59 Nζ (2.7 Å). When Asp64 in E. coli TadA, which corresponds to Asp48 in A. aeolicus TadA, was replaced by Glu, the mutant enzyme was fully active in vivo but lost its activity in vitro (7Wolf J. Gerber A.P. Keller W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3841-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 25Poulsen L.K. Larsen N.W. Molin S. Andersson P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This residue may contribute to the structural stabilization of the protein, either by itself or through interaction with other protein(s). The A-B and C-D dimers touch (Fig. 3B) through the A-C, A-D, and B-D contacts of 140, 730, and 150 Å2, respectively, of the 8100-Å2 monomer surface area. Six residues of the C-terminal helix α5 of molecule A interact with nine residues on the wall of the zinc-containing cavity of molecule D and vice versa. An E. coli TadA mutant lacking the C-terminal 17 residues reportedly retained its editing activity (7Wolf J. Gerber A.P. Keller W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3841-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 25Poulsen L.K. Larsen N.W. Molin S. Andersson P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, the seven corresponding residues at the C terminus of A. aeolicus TadA may be dispensable for editing (Fig. 2), indicating that the interaction between molecules A and D is not biologically important. All of the interactions between the A-B and C-D dimers may be because of crystal packing. Comparisons of the A. aeolicus TadA Structure to Those of Other CDA Superfamily Members—Sequence alignments (Fig. 2) reveal that the N-terminal halves are conserved among the CDA superfamily members. Residues 1–100 of A. aeolicus TadA share sequence identities of 40% with residues 1–103 of Bacillus subtilis guanine deaminase (GD), 24% with residues 9–111 of yeast CD, 16% with residues 1–106 of B. subtilis CDA, and 15% with residues 9–116 of yeast CDD1. Yeast CDD1 deaminates both mRNA and cytidine (17Dance G.S. Beemiller P. Yang Y. Mater D.V. Mian I.S. Smith H.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1772-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The C-terminal halves have no sequence conservation. A structural homology search by DALI (26Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) shows that A. aeolicus TadA displays similarities to yeast CD, B. subtilis GD (Protein Data Bank code 1TIY), B. subtilis CDA (Protein Data Bank code 1JTK), and yeast CDD1 (Protein Data Bank code 1R5T) with Z-scores of 20.2, 16.8, 9.7, and 9.6, respectively. Especially, the N-terminal halves, which are shown in pink (Figs. 5 and 6), share high structural similarity. The root mean square deviations of the N-terminal Cα atoms of yeast CD, B. subtilis GD, B. subtilis CDA, and yeast CDD1, superposed on the corresponding residues of A. aeolicus TadA, are 2.55, 1.89, 3.17, and 3.30 Å, respectively. This high structural conservation of the N-terminal motifs would be necessary to coordinate a zinc ion in the active site.Fig. 6Comparison of the monomer structures among the CDA superfamily members. The monomer architectures of A. aeolicus TadA (A), yeast CD (B), B. subtilis GD (C), B. subtilis CDA (D), and yeast CDD1 (E) are shown as ribbon models. The conserved N-terminal motifs are colored pink, and the diverse C-terminal motifs are colored green. As B. subtilis GD forms an intertwined dimer, the C-terminal motif (residues 131–150) of the adjacent subunit and its secondary structure are shown in blue. The zinc ions are represented as magenta spheres.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next describe the comparisons of the oligomerization states and of the C-terminal halves of architectures. A. aeolicus TadA (Fig. 5A) and yeast CD (Fig. 5B) form similar dimeric structures. Their dimer interfaces comprise helices α3 and α4 and the regions between β4 and β5 (the loop in A. aeolicus TadA and the helix α5 in yeast CD). In addition, the C-terminal motifs of the monomers have similar structures (Fig. 6). First, the β4 and β5 strands run parallel to each other. Second, the N and C termini are located on the same side of the α/β/α three-layered fold. Third, both of the C-terminal helices (α5 in A. aeolicus TadA and α6 in yeast CD) contact the α1 N-terminal helices. B. subtilis GD forms an intertwined dimer through C-terminal domain swapping (Fig. 5C). The dimer interface is composed of the helices α3 and α4 and the C-terminal domain. Helices α5 and α6, which are located between the β4 and β5 strands, make the domain swapping possible and have important roles in guanine recognition (11Liaw S.H. Chang Y.J. Lai C.T. Chang H.C.

As a consequence of the swap, the C-terminal motif of one subunit interacts with the other subunit in a manner similar to that of A. aeolicus TadA and yeast CD (Fig. 6C). Yeast CDD1 and B. subtilis CDA form tetrameric structures. One subunit of yeast CDD1 (Fig. 5D) interacts with the other three subunits via the α2–α6 helices. B. subtilis CDA also has a tetrameric structure similar to that of yeast CDD1. The tetramers are not formed by the dimerization of two TadA-like dimers. Therefore, the quaternary structure of yeast CDD1 (Fig. 5D) completely differs from that of A. aeolicus TadA (Fig. 5A). Also, the C-terminal motifs of B. subtilis CDA (Fig. 6D) and yeast CDD1 (Fig. 6E) share no structural similarities with that of A. aeolicus TadA (Fig. 6A). First, the β4 and β5 strands run antiparallel to each other and only short turns exist between the β4 and β5 strands. Second, the N and C termini are located on the opposite sides of the α/β/α three-layered fold. The oligomerization state does not determine whether nucleic acids are accommodated. Based on the structure of yeast CDD1, a model of human activation-induced cytidine deaminase has been made (12Xie K. Sowden M.P. Dance G.S. Torelli A.T. Smith H.C. Wedekind J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8114-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) on the assumption that its quaternary structure is similar to a tetramer. On the other hand, an analysis of the human activation-induced cytidine deaminase sequence with the 3DJury method suggested that the dimeric yeast CD was the best template (27Zaim J. Kierzek A.M. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 1153-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). One problem with using yeast CD as a template was that the intramolecular active site was too small to accommodate large nucleic acid molecules (12Xie K. Sowden M.P. Dance G.S. Torelli A.T. Smith H.C. Wedekind J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8114-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the structure of A. aeolicus TadA indicates that activation-induced cytidine deaminase might form a TadA-like dimer for nucleic acid binding. The RNA-binding Site of A. aeolicus TadA—We next examined the substrate-binding site differences between A. aeolicus TadA and yeast CD to determine which motifs contribute to the specific binding of their substrates, tRNA and cytosine, respectively. The active-site cavity of A. aeolicus TadA (Fig. 5A) is composed of the α2 and α5 helices, and the zinc ion from one subunit, the β4–β5 loops from both subunits, and loop 1 (between α2 and β3) and loop 2 (between α3 and β4) from the other subunit. Both of the β4–β5 loops of the A. aeolicus TadA dimer are extended and cooperate with each other to form the putative RNA-binding site (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, the corresponding regions (the α5 helices) in the yeast CD dimer are involved in the intersubunit interaction but are far from the cytosine-binding site (Fig. 5B). The C-terminal α5 helix of A. aeolicus TadA protrudes outward, whereas the corresponding C-terminal α7 helix of yeast CD bends inward, which makes the cavity narrower and suitable for a small cytosine base (10Ko T.P. Lin J.J. Hu C.Y. Hsu Y.H. Wang A.H. Liaw S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19111-19117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In summary, the diversified regions between the β4 and β5 strands and the C-terminal helices have important roles in the specific recognition of the substrates by A. aeolicus TadA and yeast CD. The Recognition of tRNAArg-2—The anticodon stem loop structure (Fig. 1B) is reportedly sufficient for E. coli TadA to deaminate the adenosine residue at the wobble position (position 34) (7Wolf J. Gerber A.P. Keller W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3841-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A mutational study showed that the bases 33–36 (UACG) are recognized base-specifically and that the stem is recognized base-nonspecifically (7Wolf J. Gerber A.P. Keller W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3841-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Fig. 7A shows the side chains of the conserved residues in the active-site cavity of A. aeolicus TadA, which should hold the anticodon loop of tRNA so that the adenosine residue lies just above the zinc-bound hydroxide ion. The asparagine residue at the C-terminal end of the β2 strand is widely conserved within the CDA superfamily (Fig. 2) and is known to interact with cytidine, cytosine, and guanine (9Johansson E. Mejlhede N. Neuhard J. Larsen S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2563-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10Ko T.P. Lin J.J. Hu C.Y. Hsu Y.H. Wang A.H. Liaw S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19111-19117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11Liaw S.H. Chang Y.J. Lai C.T. Chang H.C. Chang G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35479-35485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The corresponding residue, Asn41, in A. aeolicus TadA is located at the bottom of the active site and may contribute to the recognition of the adenosine residue at position 34. The adenosine residue normally base-stacks with nucleotide residues 35–38 but should be unstacked for the deamination. The conserved hydrophobic residues (Val23, Val25, Val77, Leu79, and Leu139) colored yellow in Fig. 7A cluster on the wall of the cavity and may accommodate the unstacked anticodon. The stem moiety may be recognized by the helix α5, which includes some conserved positively charged amino acid residues (Fig. 2). Lys144 and Arg147 in A. aeolicus TadA lie on the same side of the helix (Fig. 7A). We thought that these positively charged side chains may interact with the negatively charged tRNA phosphate backbone. The seven C-terminal residues including Arg147 in A. aeolicus TadA are reportedly not essential for editing (7Wolf J. Gerber A.P. Keller W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3841-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 25Poulsen L.K. Larsen N.W. Molin S. Andersson P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, as long as TadA has Lys144, it may be able to bind with tRNA. Fig. 7, B and C, show a preliminary docking model of TadA and the anticodon stem loop moiety (bases 26–43) of yeast tRNAPhe (Protein Data Bank code 1EHZ). We docked them with no conformational change. The anticodon stem loop is well embedded in the putative RNA binding cavity (Fig. 7B). The surface of A. aeolicus TadA is color-coded according to its electrostatic potential (red, –10kT/e; blue, +10kT/e) (Fig. 7C). The positive charges at the C-terminal helix are located near the tRNA phosphate backbones. Several conserved residues exist at the entrance of the cavity (Fig. 7A). Lys105, Phe142, and Phe143 of one subunit and Lys68, Tyr69, Arg93, His123, and Asn124 from the other subunit may also interact with the tRNA. Lys68 and Tyr69 are conserved as a combination of a positively charged residue and an aromatic residue (Fig. 2). The side chains of these two residues are fixed by a cation-π interaction. The conserved Arg93 residue is also located adjacent to Tyr69 in A. aeolicus TadA. These residues may contribute to specific interactions with the anticodon bases. In the loop region, Asn122 and His123 are not very close to the putative catalytic site but the loop might change its conformation and bring them closer upon tRNA binding. In summary, the large cavity formed around the catalytic site with the zinc ion seems to be important for accommodating the anticodon loop stem of tRNAArg-2. This structural feature clearly distinguishes TadA from yeast cytosine deaminase, which has a smaller substrate. We thank Dr. M. Yamamoto for technical assistance at the beamline BL26B1 of SPring-8 and Drs. T. Yanagisawa and R. Ishitani for technical advice regarding the protein purification. We thank T.

https://openalex.org/W1966833548,"Processing of the recycling proteoglycan glypican-1 involves the release of its heparan sulfate chains by copper ion- and nitric oxide-catalyzed ascorbate-triggered autodegradation. The Alzheimer disease amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its paralogue, the amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2), contain copper ion-, zinc ion-, and heparan sulfate-binding domains. We have investigated the possibility that APP and APLP2 regulate glypican-1 processing during endocytosis and recycling.

We propose that the rate of autoprocessing of glypican-1 is modulated by APP and APLP2 in neurons and by APLP2 in fibroblasts. These observation identify a functional relationship between the heparan sulfate and copper ion binding activities of APP/APLP2 in their modulation of the nitroxyl anion-catalyzed heparan sulfate degradation in glypican-1."

Sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome unveiled over 50 genes coding for aspartic proteases of the pepsin type (1.Beers E.P. Jones A.M. Dickerman A.W. Phytochemistry. 2004; 65: 43-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 2.Faro, C., and Gal, S. (2005) Curr. Protein Pept. Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar).

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 980-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) genes, very little is known about the nucellin and the atypical subgroups. In fact, most of the knowledge acquired during the last decade relates to the typical subgroup of plant aspartic proteases and has been generated predominantly from the study of phytepsin from barley seeds and cardosins from the flowers of cardoon (7.Simões I. Faro C. Eur.J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Typical plant aspartic proteases constitute a set of enzymes that share many structural and functional features not only among them but also with some of their mammalian and microbial homologues. They display activity at acidic pH and are inhibited by pepstatin A, a natural hexapeptide from Streptomyces. Common features also include the overall three-dimensional structure of mature enzymes, the catalytic apparatus, and a conserved DT/SG motif. A distinguishing feature of typical plant aspartic proteases is the occurrence of an extra 100- amino acid-long internal segment, known as the plant-specific insert (PSI), in the sequence of their precursors. This domain displays structural and functional similarities to saposins (8.Egas C. Lavoura N. Resende R. Brito R.M. Pires E. de Lima M.C. Faro C. J. Biol.

Colocalization studies with putative substrates and their temporal and spatial expression profiles have implicated members of this group in cell death events associated with plant senescence, stress responses, programmed cell death, and plant sexual reproduction (7.Simões I. Faro C. Eur.J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In the particular case of cardosin A, the major aspartic protease from the flowers of cardoon, gene expression occurs specifically at the early stages of flower development, and the protein accumulates in protein storage vacuoles until the later stages of flower senescence (13.Ramalho-Santos M. Pissarra J. Verissimo P. Pereira S. Salema R. Pires E. Faro C.J. Planta. 1997; 203: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As the flower matures, the single-chain precursor form (procardosin A) is converted into a two-chain mature cardosin A by removal of the internal PSI domain and the N-terminal propeptide (14.Faro C. Ramalho-Santos M. Vieira M. Mendes A. Simões I. Andrade R. Verissimo P. Lin X. Tang J. Pires E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28724-28729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This event is a crucial step in regulating the activity of cardosin A. Therefore, an improved understanding of the activation mechanism, along with a more detailed analysis of the specificity of cardosin A, may give more clues about the molecular mechanism underlying its participation in the cell death events associated with flower senescence. The expression vector pET-23a (Novagen, Madison, WI) containing the procardosin A cDNA (pET_pCA+PSI) has been previously constructed in our lab (14.Faro C. Ramalho-Santos M. Vieira M. Mendes A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28724-28729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), as well as the PSI deleted procardosin A construct (pET_pCAΔPSI) (8.Egas C. Lavoura N. Resende R.

The Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain was purchased from Novagen. Prestained protein markers were purchased from Bio-Rad. The synthetic chromogenic peptide Lys-Pro-Ala-Glu-Phe-Phe(NO2)-Ala-Leu was purchased from Pepsyn Ltd. (University of Liverpool, Biological Sciences). Natural Cardosin A was purified from fresh flowers of Cynara cardunculus L. as previously described (15.Veríssimo P. Faro C. Moir A.J. Lin Y. Tang J. Pires E. Eur.J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Expression, Refolding, and Purification of Procardosin A in E. coli— pET_pCA+PSI and pET_pCA-PSI were introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3), and expression of procardosin A (pCA) or its mutant without the PSI (pCAΔPSI) was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.5 mm) when the A600 of the cells, grown at 37 °C, had reached 0.6. After 3 h, the cells were harvested, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl (pH 7.4), and lysed by adding lysozyme (100 μg/ml). After freezing and thawing, deoxyribonuclease I (100 μg/ml) and MgCl2 (100 mm) were added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The inclusion bodies were then washed for 3 h with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl (pH 7.4), centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and then washed again for another 3 h with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl (pH 7.4), 0,1% Triton X-100 (v/v). Upon centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the purified inclusion bodies were dissolved in 8 m urea containing 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The protein was refolded by rapid dilution (20-fold) into 20 mm Tris base, and the pH was slowly adjusted to pH 8.0. The recombinant protein was then concentrated in a tangential flow ultrafiltration system (Pellicon 2; Millipore, Billerica, MA), ultracentrifuged at 50,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was applied onto an S-300 gel filtration chromatographic column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.4 m urea, pH 8.0 buffer. The fractions corresponding to the second protein peak, which corresponds to the nonaggregated forms of cardosin A, were then combined and further purified by ion exchange chromatography on a Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences) using the same buffer as for the S-300 chromatographic experiment with a gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—SDS-PAGE was performed using 15% gels in a Bio-Rad Mini Protean III electrophoresis apparatus and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Sigma). After SDS-PAGE, the protein samples for chemical N- and C-terminal sequence analysis were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by electroblotting in 10 mm CAPS, 10% methanol, pH 11, at 500 mA for 1 h and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Activation and Enzymatic Properties—Purified procardosin A (with or without PSI) samples were first incubated with the activation buffers in a 1:1 volume ratio. The samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C with the following buffers: 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 3.0 and 4.0; 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0; 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.0; and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The samples were then assayed for activity and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. N- and C-terminal Sequence Analysis of Electroblotted Samples—N-terminal sequence analysis was performed in the gas-pulsed liquid phase using a model 476A protein sequencer with a microreaction chamber and an on-line HPLC system for phenylthiohydantoin analysis (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Absorbance was monitored at 269 nm. C-terminal sequence analysis was performed on a Procise 494C protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) using the C-terminal sequencing chemistry first described in 1992 (16.Boyd V.L. Bozzini M. Zon G. Noble R.L. Mattaliano R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and most recently reviewed in 2000 (17.Samyn B. Hardeman K. Van der Eycken J. Van Beeumen J. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 1389-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Prior to C-terminal sequence analysis, the sample was treated with 200 mm phenylisocyanate in ACN under basic conditions (124 mm diisopropyl ethylamine/ACN) to derivatize the ϵ-amino group of the lysine residues into stable phenylureas. The alkylated thiohydantoin amino acids were analyzed on-line on a thermostatted (38 °C) C18 reversed phase column (2.1 × 220 mm, 5 microns). A linear gradient with a flow rate of 300 μl/min was formed using a 140C microgradient system with the following solvents: Solvent A, 35 mm sodium acetate buffer, 3.5% tetrahydrofuran, Milli Q water, and Solvent B, 100% ACN. The alkylated thiohydantoin-derivatives were monitored using a 785 A absorbance detector set at 254 nm, and quantified relative to a 100-pmol alkylated thiohydantoin amino acid standard. The methyl napthyl thiohydantoin amino acid standards were obtained from the supplier. The reagents and solvents, for both N- and C-terminal sequence analysis, as well as HPLC solvents were obtained from Applied Biosystems. Mass Spectrometric C-terminal Sequence Analysis of SDS-PAGE Separated Samples—Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE are reduced and alkylated after destaining of the molecular mass separated fragments. Alkylation with iodoacetamide at alkaline pH values results in formation of carboxyamidomethylcysteine derivatives (Δm = +57.02 Da). Removal of the excess iodoacetamide is accomplished by washing the gel piece prior to chemical cleavage with CNBr in 70% aquous trifluoroacetic acid. After cleavage (incubation overnight in the dark at room temperature), the supernatant was collected, and the CNBr fragments were extracted twice with 70% ACN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. All of the fractions were pooled, dried in a SpeedVac, and finally redissolved in 10 μl of digest buffer prior to carboxypeptidase treatment. Carboxypeptidase Y sequencing grade (EC 3.4.16.1) and carboxypeptidase P sequencing grade (EC 3.4.16.1) were obtained from Roche Applied Science. The vials, containing 20 μg of enzyme, were redissolved in 70 μl of redistilled water, resulting in a stock solution of 5 pmol of carboxypetidases Y and P/μl 40 mm sodium citrate buffer concentration, pH 6.0. From this stock solution dilutions were freshly prepared daily. For time-dependent ladder formation, the CNBr fragments were resolubilized in 10 μl of 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5.4), and a mixture of carboxypetidases Y and P was added at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1/50 (w/w). Sample aliquots of this reaction mixture (1 μl) were taken at 0, 1, 3, 10, 20, and 30 min. The Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics Analyzer with time-of-flight/time-of-flight optics was used in this study for ladder sequence analysis and MALDI MS/MS applications. The mass spectrometer uses a 200-Hz frequency tripled Nd:YAG laser operating at a wavelength of 355 nm. For MS/MS, ions generated by the MALDI process were accelerated at 8 kV through a grid at 6.7 kV into a short, linear, field-free drift region. In this region, the ions pass though a timed ion selector device that is able to select one peptide from a mixture of peptides at different m/z values for subsequent fragmentation in the collision cell. After a peptide at a given m/z was selected by the timed ion selector, it passes through a retarding lens where the ions are decelerated and then passes into the collision cell, which was operated at 7 kV. The collision energy, defined by the potential difference between the source and the collision cell, was 1 kV. Inside the collision cell, no collision gas was provided. After the collision, the ions are accelerated in the second source region at 15 kV, passed through a second, field-free, linear drift region, into the reflector, and finally to the detector. The detector amplifies and converts the signal to an electric current, which is observed and manipulated by a PC-based operating system. For the reflector mode, the operation of the instrument is far simpler. After the MALDI process generates the peptide ions, and the latter are accelerated at 20 kV through a grid at 14 kV into the first, short, linear, field-free drift region. After this point, the rest of the instrument can be treated as a continuation of this region until the ions enter the reflector and then reach the detector, where as before, the signal at the detector is amplified and converted to electrical current. The samples were prepared by applying 0.5 μl of the sample to a stainless steel 192-well stainless steel target plate and by adding 0.25 μl of matrix solution (a saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution in 50% ACN containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). They were allowed to air dry at room temperature and were then inserted into the mass spectrometer and subjected to MALDI-MS analysis. Prior to analysis, the mass spectrometer was externally calibrated with a mixture of angiotensin I, Glu-fibrino-peptide B, adrenocorticotropic hormone (fragments 1–17 and 18–39). For MS/MS experiments, the instrument was externally calibrated with fragments of Glu-fibrino-peptide. MS and MS/MS data were further processed using DataExplorer 4.0 (Applied Biosystems) or by manual interpretation. Kinetic Studies—The proteolytic activity was assayed using the synthetic chromogenic peptide Lys-Pro-Ala-Glu-Phe-Phe(NO2)-Ala-Leu as substrate. The enzymes were incubated at 37 °C with 0.1 mm substrate in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.7, 0.2 m NaCl, and the rate of hydrolysis was monitored at 300 nm in a Varian-Cary 100 UV-visible spectrophotometer using the operating software. A molar absorption coefficient of 1480 m cm−1 at 300 nm was used in the calculations (15.Veríssimo P. Faro C. Moir A.J. Lin Y. Tang J. Pires E. Eur.J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The enzyme concentration was determined by active site titration with pepstatin A. For activity studies at different pH, the following buffers between pH 3.0 and 7.0 containing 0.1 m NaCl and 4% (v/v) Me2SO were used: 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 2.5–4.0; 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5–5.5; 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.0; and 0.1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The kinetic parameters were calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk plot using appropriate software, and the inhibition constant for pepstatin A was calculated as previously described (15.Veríssimo P. Faro C. Moir A.J. Lin Y. Tang J. Pires E. Eur.J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). For the activation studies at different protein concentrations, procardosin A was incubated at concentrations ranging from 0.14 to 1.44 μm in 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 4.0, at 37 °C, and aliquots were taken at different incubation times and tested for activity. The activity determined within the first 15 min, where the increase in the activity was linear for all the concentrations tested, was used to calculate the initial rate of activation. Specificity Preferences of Recombinant and Native Cardosin A—The peptide substrate specificity was studied by using two combinatorial libraries based on the sequences Lys-Pro-Xaa-Glu-P1#Nph-Xaa-Leu (P1 library) and Lys-Pro-Ile-Xaa-Nph#P1′-Gln-Xaa (P1′ library); Nph is p-NO2-Phe, Xaa indicates that mixtures of the 19 amino acids were incorporated, and # indicates the scissile bond. For each library, 19 different pools were synthesized having a different amino acid substitution at either the P1 or P1′ position. They included all common amino acids found in proteins, except Cys and Met to avoid problems with oxidation. The latter amino acid was, however, substituted by Nle. The peptide specificity assay was described in more detail elsewhere (18.Beyer B.B. Johnson J.V. Chung A.Y. Tang L. Madabushi A. Agbandje-McKenna M. McKenna R. Dame J.B. Dunn B.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1768-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot of each pool of the P1 and P1′ libraries giving a total peptide concentration of ∼100 μm was used in a spectrophotometric assay. For the P1 library, cleavage between P1 and Nph yields a decrease in absorbance between 284 and 324 nm. For the P1′ library, cleavage between Nph and the P1′ residue yields an increase in absorbance in the same range. The better the fit within the active site cleft to optimize catalysis, the faster the observed rate of cleavage. Expression, Purification, and Characterization of Recombinant Procardosin A—The expression plasmid construct used in this work contains the cDNA encoding procardosin A starting at Ser3P (pepsin numbering) with an extra Met-Ala-Ser sequence at the N terminus, encoded by the pET-23a sequence. Expression of this construct in E. coli resulted in the accumulation as inclusion bodies of a protein with an apparent molecular mass of about 53 kDa (data not shown); the inclusion bodies were easily purified to greater than 90% purity with a simple freeze/thaw and detergent washing procedure, and after dissolving them in 8 m urea, the refolding was induced by a rapid dilution step followed by the slow adjustment of the pH to 8.0. Upon refolding, the high molecular mass soluble aggregates were removed by size exclusion chromatography in a Sephacryl S-300 column, and recombinant procardosin A was then purified by ion exchange chromatography on a Resource Q column. SDS-PAGE analysis of the protein fraction collected from the ion exchange chromatography confirmed the presence of a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 53 kDa (data not shown), the predicted mass for the nonglycosylated form of procardosin A. Edman degradation of the electroblotted protein indicated that the recombinant procardosin started with the expected N-terminal ASSDD sequence (the initial Met residue is removed by the bacterial methionine aminopeptidase (19.Hirel P.H.

Chang S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 751-757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chemical C-terminal sequence analysis yielded the sequence FAEAA, indicating that the purified protein indeed corresponded to full-length procardosin A. The expression and purification procedure yielded about 4 mg of pure recombinant procardosin A/liter of culture. Activation of Recombinant Procardosin A—To investigate the activation of recombinant procardosin A, the protein was incubated overnight in a series of buffers with pH ranging from 3.0 to 7.0. Conversion of recombinant procardosin A into its intermediate and mature forms was observed at acidic pH values, with the highest rate of processing obtained at pH 4.0 (Fig. 1). A time course analysis of the activation process using the chromogenic substrate Lys-Pro-Ala-Glu-Phe-Phe(NO2)-Ala-Leu as substrate revealed that maximal activity was obtained after 30 min of incubation (Fig. 2). SDS-PAGE analysis showed that at this time point full-length procardosin A was converted into a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 47 kDa. As the incubation time increases, this protein is converted into the two-chain form of cardosin A (Fig. 3).Fig. 2Activation of recombinant procardosin A. Recombinant procardosin A was incubated with 100 mm citrate buffer, pH 4.0, at 37 °C. Aliquots were taken at different time points (between 0 min and 72 h) and tested for activity. The assays were carried out using the synthetic chromogenic peptide Lys-Pro-Ala-Glu-Phe-Phe(NO2)-Ala-Leu as substrate in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.7, 0.2 m NaCl, 4% (v/v) Me2SO buffer at 37 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3SDS-PAGE analysis of recombinant procardosin A activation. Recombinant procardosin A was incubated with 100 mm citrate buffer, pH 4.0, at 37 °C. Aliquots were taken at different time points (between 0 min and 72 h) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Procardosin A was also run in the gel as control (Ct). The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the nature of the activation process, recombinant procardosin A was incubated at pH 4.0 in the presence of various protease inhibitors. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the processing enzyme is an aspartic protease because only pepstatin A (Fig. 4, lane 1), the classic inhibitor of this class of proteases, was able to prevent the proteolytic cleavage of the recombinant procardosin A. To rule out the presence of a contaminant pepstatin-sensitive protease from E. coli, an active site D32A mutant of procardosin A was generated and produced. The inactive mutant could not be processed in the same conditions used to process procardosin A (data not shown), clearly ruling out the possibility of a contaminant protease responsible for the proteolytic events leading to zymogen activation. Taken together these results suggest that recombinant procardosin A activates itself at acidic pH values. The activation of recombinant procardosin A may result from either an intramolecular or intermolecular processing mechanism or a combination of both. An intramolecular activation mechanism would imply a zero order reaction where the rate of procardosin A activation would be independent of procardosin A concentration. An intermolecular activation mechanism would have a higher order of reaction. The relative rates of activation of procardosin A at different protein concentration were determined, and the results are given in Fig. 5. As observed, the extrapolation of activation rate when the procardosin A concentration tends toward zero is clearly different from zero, in agreement with an intramolecular mechanism. However, when procardosin A concentration increases, the rate of activation increases, suggesting that the processing reaction can also follow an intermolecular mechanism. When fully processed recombinant cardosin A was added to procardosin A in a 1:50 or 1:10 ratio, the initial rate of procardosin A proteolytic processing was not significantly affected (data not shown), indicating that under the conditions used, procardosin A processing appears to be primarily an intramolecular reaction. Proteolytic Processing of Recombinant Procardosin A—To better understand the molecular events involved in the proteolytic activation of recombinant procardosin A, the peptide bonds cleaved during the process were identified by a combination of N- and C-terminal sequencing together with the use of a novel mass spectrometry based method for C-terminal amino acid sequencing (21.Samyn B. Sergeant K. Castanheira P. Faro C. Van Beeumen J. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The first cleavage in recombinant procardosin A produced two peptide fragments with molecular masses of 47 and 8 kDa (Fig. 6B, bands B1 and B2). N- and C-terminal sequencing analysis of the 47-kDa protein identified the sequence RGTVR, corresponding to the last five amino acids of the propeptide at the N terminus and the FAEAA sequence at the C terminus. Sequence analysis of the 8-kDa protein revealed that the N terminus was that of the recombinant procardosin A (ASSD), whereas C-terminal sequence analysis identified the sequence GF. These results indicate that the first intermediate form of recombinant cardosin A results from a cleavage between residues Phe40P-Arg41P (pepsin numbering) of the propeptide. The 47-kDa protein was subsequently converted into a 33-kDa protein (Fig. 6B, band C1) whose N-terminal sequence was RGTVR. After electroblotting, the amount of the C1 fragment was insufficient to obtain its C-terminal sequence by chemical sequence analysis. Although considerable progress has been made in recent years, the existing chemical method for C-terminal sequence analysis is still hampered by the relatively modest sensitivity (20–100 pmol) of this approach (17.Samyn B. Hardeman K. Van der Eycken J. Van Beeumen J. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 1389-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, the C-terminal sequence was determined by using a novel, mass spectrometry-based method that was applied on the SDS-PAGE-separated fragments (21.Samyn B. Sergeant K. Castanheira P. Faro C. Van Beeumen J. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this method, a peptide mixture is generated by cleavage of the protein with CNBr in acid solution, a chemical cleavage method known to be specific for Met-Xaa peptide bonds. During the cleavage Met residues are converted to homoserine lactone, in equilibrium with homoserine. During subsequent incubation with carboxypeptidases only the original carboxyl containing fragment is accessible to enzymatic degradation. In this ladder sequencing approach, the sequence can be read, in the correct order, by simply calculating the differences in mass of adjacent peptide peaks, representing the loss of C-terminal amino acids. The ladder read-out is performed using MALDI-time-of-flight MS, becau"

Ezrin is localized to the apical membrane of parietal cells and couples the protein kinase A activation cascade to regulated HCl secretion in gastric parietal cells. Here, we show that the integrity of ezrin is essential for parietal cell activation and provide the first evidence that ezrin interacts with PALS1, an evolutionarily conserved PDZ and SH3 domain-containing protein. Our biochemical study verifies that ezrin binds to PALS1 via its N terminus and is co-localized with PALS1 to the apical membrane of gastric parietal cells. Furthermore, our study shows that PALS1 is essential for the apical localization of ezrin, as either suppression of PALS1 protein accumulation or deletion of the PALS1-binding domain of ezrin eliminated the apical localization of ezrin.

Taken together, these results define a novel molecular mechanism linking ezrin to the conserved apical polarity complexes and their roles in polarized epithelial secretion of gastric parietal cells. The functions of an epithelium depend on the polarized organization of its individual epithelial cells. The acquisition of a fully polarized phenotype involves a cascade of complex events, including cell-cell adhesion, assembly of a lateral cortical complex, reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and polarized targeting of transport vesicles to the apical and basolateral membranes (1.Yeaman C. Grindstaff K.K. Hansen M.D. Nelson W.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R515-R517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Ezrin is an actin-binding protein of the ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) family of membrane-cytoskeleton linker proteins (2.Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Within the gastric epithelium, ezrin has been localized exclusively to parietal cells and primarily to the apical canalicular membrane of these cells (e.g. Refs. 3.Urushidani T. Hanzel D.K. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: G1070-G1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 4.Yao X. Forte J.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 103-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that gastric ezrin is co-distributed with the β-actin isoform in vivo (5.Yao X. Chaponnier C. Gabbiani G. Forte J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 541-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and preferentially bound to the β-actin isoform in vitro (6.Yao X. Cheng L. Forte J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7224-7229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Because of its cytolocalization and observed stimulation-dependent phosphorylation, it was postulated that ezrin couples the activation of protein kinase A to the apical membrane remodeling associated with parietal cell secretion (4.Yao X. Forte J.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 103-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Recently, we mapped the protein kinase A phosphorylation site on ezrin and illustrated the phosphoregulation of ezrin in gastric acid secretion (7.Zhou R. Cao X. Watson C. Miao Y. Guo Z. Forte J.G. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35651-35659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, it is still not clear how ezrin links the apical membrane to the actin cytoskeleton during parietal cell activation. ERM proteins all possess an ∼300-residue N-terminal domain that shares sequence homology with the corresponding domain of erythrocyte band 4.1, followed by an ∼170-residue region predicted to be largely α-helical and terminating in an ∼100-residue domain in which an F-actin-binding site resides (6.Yao X. Cheng L. Forte J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7224-7229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 8.Turunen O. Wahlstrom T. Vaheri A. J.

Cell. 1995; 6: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Our previous study established an interrelationship between ezrin and calpain I (10.Yao X. Thibodeau A. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C36-C46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further support for a membrane-cytoskeleton linking role came from a study in which calpain I-mediated proteolysis liberated the apical localization of ezrin and prevented activation of acid secretion in the apical membrane without altering the gross cytology (10.Yao X. Thibodeau A. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C36-C46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To delineate the membrane-cytoskeleton linking role of ezrin, several groups have tried to identify ERM-binding proteins using pull-down assays. These include identification of hyaluronate receptor CD44 (11.Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), ICAM (intercellular adhesion molecule-1) (12.Helander T.S. Carpen O. Turunen O. Kovanen P.E. Vaheri A. Timonen T. Nature. 1996; 382: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and EBP50 (13.Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Because PDZ (PSD-95/Discs Large-ZO-1) domains are known to mediate associations with integral membrane proteins, it was hypothesized that membrane attachment of ezrin is likely to be mediated via EBP50, a PDZ domain-containing protein. A recent study has demonstrated important roles for PDZ domain-containing proteins during cell polarization (14.Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). One of the major groups of PDZ proteins is the membrane-associated guanylate kinase proteins. These proteins usually contain a non-catalytic guanylate kinase domain in combination with PDZ and SH3 1The abbreviations used are: SH3, Src homology 3; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, myelin basic protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MEM, minimal essential medium; SLO, streptolysin O. 1The abbreviations used are: SH3, Src homology 3; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, myelin basic protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MEM, minimal essential medium; SLO, streptolysin O. domains. Many also contain a 4.1B or hook domain that allows these membrane-associated guanylate kinase proteins to bind members of the band 4.1 superfamily, such as protein 4.1, and ERM proteins (15.Lue R.A.

Straight S. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11425-11431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), a membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein, binds to a PDZ domain protein of PATJ (PALS1-associated tight junction protein), a human homolog of Drosophila Discs Lost (DGL) (18.Roh M.H.

DGL is crucial for epithelial cell polarity and exists in complex with the apical polarity determinant Crumbs in flies. It remains to be established how the PALS1-PATJ-Crumbs protein complex interacts with the actin-based cytoskeleton at the apical membrane during polarity establishment and/or maintenance. To delineate the structure-function relationship of ezrin in the activation of gastric acid secretion, we took advantage of our recent development of streptolysin O-permeabilized gastric glands and assessed the requirement of ezrin in parietal cell activation by addition of recombinant ezrin and its deletion mutants. Our study demonstrates that the integrity of ezrin is critical for parietal cell activation. To identify the apical localization signal, we expressed full-length ezrin and its deletion mutants tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the cultured parietal cells. Our studies indicate that the N terminus of ezrin (amino acids 1–50) is sufficient for its localization to the apical membrane, whereas overexpression of this 50-amino acid fragment liberates endogenous ezrin from the apical membrane. Our pull-down assay revealed an association between ezrin and PALS1. Elimination of PALS1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) diminished the apical localization of ezrin and effected a dominant-negative role in parietal cell activation. We propose that ezrin-PALS1 interaction provides a link between the apical plasma membrane and actin-based cytoskeleton in parietal cells. Reagents—[14C]Aminopyrine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Monoclonal antibody JL-18 against GFP was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA), and anti-ezrin antibody 4A5 was produced as described by Hanzel et al. (19.Hanzel D.K. Urushidani T. Usinger W.R.

Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 and rabbit anti-Cdc42 antibody were purchased from Sigma and Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Rhodamine-coupled phalloidin and Alex Fluor 350-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Lipofectamine 2000 was obtained from Invitrogen. DNA Construction—The bacterial expression vectors containing human ezrin fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) were generous gifts from Dr. Monique Arpin. GFP-ezrin was constructed by ligating an EcoRI-SalI PCR-amplified ezrin cDNA into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) as described previously (7.Zhou R. Cao X. Watson C. Miao Y. Guo Z. Forte J.G. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35651-35659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The ezrin deletion mutants were constructed by a standard PCR method using the following primers: ezrin-N1, 5′-TCG TCG ACG GTA CCG CGG GCC CGG GAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAT GGT GTC AGG CTT CCT GCG GCG CAT-3′) (reverse); ezrin-C1, 5′-ATG GAG GTG CAG CAG ATG AAG GCC CA-3 (forward) and 5′-CAG AAT TCG AAG CTT GAG CTC GAG A-3′ (reverse); ezrin-N2, 5′-TCG TCG ACG GTA CCG CGG GCC CGG GAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAC ATA GTG GAG GCC AAA GTA CCA-3′ (reverse); and ezrin-C2, 5′-ATG ATC CAC AAC GAG AAC ATG A-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAG AAT TCG AAG CTT GAG CTC GAG A-3′ (reverse). All constructs were sequenced in full. GST-ezrin and its deletion mutation were constructed in pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) as described (20.Algrain M. Turunen O. Vaheri A. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Myelin basic protein (MBP)-tagged PALS1 was constructed in a modified pMAL-C2 vector as described by Fukata et al. (21.Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Itoh N. Kawajiri A. Yamaga M. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2165-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, PALS1 was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CGG GAT CCA TGA CAA CAT CAT ATA TGA-3′ and 5′-GGA ATT CTC ACC TTA GCC AGG TGG AT-3′, digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and inserted into the pMAL-C2 vector digested with BamHI and EcoRI. Myc-tagged PALS1-(1–675), PALS1-(1–181), and PALS1-(182–675) constructs were generated as described previously (18.Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C.J. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Isolation of Gastric Glands and Aminopyrine Uptake Assay—Gastric glands were isolated from New Zealand White rabbits as described by Yao et al. (10.Yao X. Thibodeau A. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C36-C46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, rabbit stomach was perfused under high pressure with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 2.25 mm K2HPO4, 6 mm Na2HPO4, 1.75 mm NaH2PO4, and 136 mm NaCl) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgSO4. The gastric mucosa was scraped from the smooth muscle layer, minced, and then washed twice with minimal essential medium (MEM) buffered with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) (HEPES/MEM). The minced mucosa was digested with 15 mg of collagenase (Sigma). Intact gastric glands were collected from the digestion mixture for 20–25 min and then washed three times with HEPES/MEM. In all subsequent gland experiments (aminopyrine uptake assay), glands were resuspended at 5% (v/v) cytocrit in the appropriate buffer for final assay. Stimulation of intact and streptolysin O (SLO)-permeabilized rabbit gastric glands was quantified using the aminopyrine uptake assay as described by Ammar et al. (22.Ammar D.A. Zhou R. Forte J.G. Yao X. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G23-G33Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, intact glands in HEPES/MEM were washed twice by settling at 4 °C in ice-cold K buffer (10 mm Tris base, 20 mm HEPES acid, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, and 40 mm mannitol (pH 7.4)). SLO was added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml, and the glands (at 5% cytocrit) were mixed by inversion and incubated on ice for 10 min. The glands were then washed twice with ice-cold K buffer to remove unbound SLO, and the permeabilization was initiated by incubating the gland suspension at 37 °C in K buffer containing 1 mm pyruvate and 10 mm succinate. To evaluate the function of ezrin in parietal cell activation, we generated recombinant ezrin and its deletion mutants in bacteria. Briefly, GST-fused ezrin and deletion mutants were expressed in BL21(DE3) bacteria and purified using a glutathione affinity column as described (7.Zhou R. Cao X. Watson C. Miao Y. Guo Z. Forte J.G. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35651-35659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were then eluted in PBS containing 10 mm glutathione and applied to a gel filtration column (Econ-Pac 10 DG, Bio-Rad) to remove glutathione and to exchange PBS for K buffer. The recombinant proteins were estimated to be 95% pure by SDS-PAGE; major contaminants were degraded fragments of ezrin. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (23.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Affinity Precipitation of PALS1 and Ezrin—GST-ezrin-N2 was used as an affinity matrix to isolate proteins interacting with ezrin. A gastric membrane fraction from rabbit stomach was extracted with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.9), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 plus proteinase inhibitor mixture (pepstatin A, leupeptin, aprotinin, and chymostatin at final concentrations of 5 μg/ml each). The cell lysates were clarified using an Eppendorf centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was incubated with 30 μl of GST-ezrin-N2 beads at room temperature for 2 h. The beads were then washed with lysis buffer three times, followed by boiling in 1× sample buffer. The samples were resolved on 6–16% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blotting. To characterize the interaction between PALS1 and ezrin, GST-tagged ezrin and deletion mutants C1 and N1 were used as an affinity matrix to isolate MBP-tagged recombinant PALS1 from bacteria cell lysates using the protocol described by Lou et al.

The beads were then washed with PBS three times, followed by boiling in 1× sample buffer. The samples were resolved on 6–16% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blotting. Cell Culture and Transfection—Primary cultures of gastric parietal cells from rabbit stomach were produced and maintained as described (7.Zhou R. Cao X. Watson C. Miao Y. Guo Z. Forte J.G. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35651-35659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Separate cultures of parietal cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-tagged wild-type ezrin and/or deletion mutants using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 μg of DNA was incubated in 600 μl of Opti-MEM (antibiotic-free), and 6 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 was added and left at room temperature for 25 min. The cultured parietal cells (∼3% cytocrit; 6-well plates) were washed once with Opti-MEM. The DNA/lipid mixture was added to the plates and incubated for 4 h, followed by replacement with 1.5 ml of medium B (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm glucose; 8 nm epidermal growth factor, 1× selenite, insulin, and transferrin (SITE) medium (Sigma), 1 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 400 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, and 15 μg/liter geneticin or 20 μg/liter novobiocin, pH 7.4). The transfected cells were then maintained in culture at 37 °C until used for protein expression, partition, immunoprecipitation, or immunofluorescence. To confirm the interaction between PALS1 and ezrin, GFP-ezrin- and FLAG-PALS1-cotransfected parietal cells were harvested and lysed in 1.5 ml of Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100) containing proteinase inhibitor mixture. The cell lysates were clarified using an Eppendorf centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting supernatants were then incubated with 15 μg of anti-GFP monoclonal antibody JL-18 at room temperature for 2 h, followed by addition of 10 μl of protein A/G beads (Pierce) for an additional hour. The beads were collected and washed with Tris-buffered saline before boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot analyses. The blot was first labeled with anti-ezrin antibody 4A5 to verify the efficiency of GFP immunoprecipitation. The blot was then stripped with SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 55 °C for 20 min, followed by confirmation of PALS1 protein precipitated by GFP-ezrin using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2. siRNA Treatment and Assay for Knockdown Efficiency—The siRNA sequences used for silencing PALS1 correspond to coding regions 504–524 (siRNA-1) and 488–508 (siRNA-2). As a control, either a duplex targeting cyclophilin or a scrambled sequence was used (24.Lou Y. Yao J. Zereshki A. Dou Z. Ahmed K. Wang H. Hu J. Wang Y. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20049-20057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The 21-mer oligonucleotide RNA duplexes were synthesized by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Boulder, CO). In trial experiments, different concentrations of siRNA oligonucleotides were used for different treatment times as detailed previously, and transfection efficiency was judged based on the uptake of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated oligonucleotides (24.Lou Y. Yao J. Zereshki A. Dou Z. Ahmed K. Wang H. Hu J. Wang Y. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20049-20057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In brief, cultured parietal cells were transfected with siRNA-1 and siRNA-2 oligonucleotides or control scrambled oligonucleotides, and the efficiency of this siRNA-mediated protein suppression was judged by Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For cytolocalization of exogenously expressed ezrin, cultured parietal cells were transfected with GFP, GFP-tagged wild-type ezrin, and GFP-tagged ezrin deletion mutants (N1, N2, C1, and C2) and maintained in MEM for 30∼36 h. Some cultures were treated with 100 μm cimetidine to maintain a resting state; others were treated with the secretory stimulants 100 μm histamine and 50 μm isobutylmethylxanthine in the presence of SCH28080, a proton pump inhibitor (7.Zhou R. Cao X. Watson C. Miao Y. Guo Z. Forte J.G. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35651-35659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Treated cells were then fixed with 2% formaldehyde for 10 min and washed three times with PBS, followed by permeabilization in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Prior to application of the primary antibody, the fixed and permeabilized cells were blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS, followed by incubation with the primary antibody against ezrin (4A5) or GFP. The endogenous and exogenous ezrin proteins were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody and counterstained with rhodamine-coupled phalloidin to visualize filamentous actin. Coverslips were supported on slides by grease pencil markings and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Images were taken with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscope using a 63 × 1.3 numerical aperture PlanApo objective. Figures were constructed using Adobe Photoshop. Confocal Microscopy—Immunostained parietal cells were examined under a Zeiss LSM510 NLO laser scanning confocal microscope with the scan head mounted transversely on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with a 40 × 1.0 numerical aperture PlanApo objective. Single images were collected by averaging 10 scans at a scan rate of 1 s/scan. Optical section series were collected with a spacing of 0.4 μm in the Z axis through an ∼12-μm thickness of the cultured parietal cells. The images from double labeling were simultaneously collected using a dichroic filter set with Zeiss LSM5 image processing software. Digital data were exported into Adobe Photoshop for presentation. Western Blotting—Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 6∼16% gradient gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins were probed with the appropriate primary antibodies and detected using an ECL kit (Pierce). The band intensity was then quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Integrity of Ezrin Is Required for Parietal Cell Activation— The gastric parietal cell offers an excellent system to study ezrin function, when other ERM proteins are absent. We have recently established a permeable gland model that permits entry of relatively large molecular components (e.g. actin and syntaxin) (22.Ammar D.A. Zhou R. Forte J.G. Yao X. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G23-G33Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our previous study suggested that the integrity of ezrin is required for parietal cell activation, as calpain-mediated proteolysis of ezrin is correlated with inhibition of acid secretion (10.Yao X. Thibodeau A. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C36-C46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To directly assess the role of ezrin in parietal cell activation, we introduced recombinant full-length ezrin and its deletion mutants into SLO-permeabilized glands. Recombinant proteins expressed in bacteria were purified to homogeneity using a glutathione column (Fig. 1B). Recombinant proteins were added to the SLO-permeabilized glands in the presence and absence of cAMP/ATP. Addition of full-length ezrin caused relatively small changes in aminopyrine uptake (at most, an ∼7% decrease), and there was no dose-dependent inhibitory effect. In contrast, N-terminal ezrin mutants caused a dose-dependent inhibition of acid secretion in SLO-permeabilized glands as measured by aminopyrine uptake. No significant inhibition was noted at 2.5 μg/ml protein, but 5 μg/ml protein caused a 23.9% reduction in acid secretion, and maximal inhibition (89–91%) occurred at 10 and 20 μg/ml (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, addition of C-terminal ezrin caused relatively small changes in aminopyrine uptake (at most, an ∼9.7% decrease), and there was no dose-dependent inhibitory effect. These experiments support the notion that the integrity of ezrin is required for parietal cell activation. The N Terminus of Ezrin Specifies Its Apical Localization in Parietal Cells—We reasoned that the inhibition seen in the SLO-permeabilized glands is due to a dominant effect exerted by addition of ezrin deletion mutants. Because ezrin is postulated to be a membrane-cytoskeleton linker, we next searched for the apical targeting domain of ezrin. Our previous study showed that exogenously expressed ezrin bears the same biochemical characteristics as those of endogenous protein (7.Zhou R. Cao X. Watson C. Miao Y. Guo Z. Forte J.G. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35651-35659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To determine whether there were any major changes in the behavior of exogenously expressed GFP-ezrin mutants, we measured the partitioning of exogenously expressed full-length ezrin and its deletion mutants into the digitonin-soluble fraction compared with the insoluble “cytoskeletal” fraction based on the Western blot analyses using anti-GFP antibody. As summarized in Fig. 2A, 63.3 ± 4.5% of full-length ezrin resided in the digitonin-insoluble fraction, consistent with previous reports (e.g. Refs. 7.Zhou R. Cao X. Watson C. Miao Y. Guo Z. Forte J.G. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35651-35659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and 25.Hanzel D. Reggio H. Bretscher A. Forte J.G. Mangeat P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Partitioning of GFP-ezrin-N1 and GFP-ezrin-N2 was similar to that of full-length ezrin; 62.1 ± 4.7% of ezrin-N1 and 60.7 ± 5.1% of ezrin-N2 were associated with the digitonin-insoluble fraction. Interestingly, the majority of GFP-ezrin-C1 and GFP-ezrin-C2 was partitioned into soluble fractions: 87.5 ± 7.3% of ezrin-C1 and 89.7 ± 8.7% of ezrin-C2 were distributed to the digitonin-soluble fraction. The distinct distribution profiles between the N- and C-terminal deletion mutants may reflect their difference in modulating acid secretion in SLO-permeabilized glands. To determine the subcellular localization of ezrin deletion mutants in parietal cells, the transfected cells were double-stained for GFP using anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (green) and for F-actin using phalloidin (red). Fig. 2B shows optical sections from GFP-ezrin-transfected cells, all maintained in the non-secreting state. Similar to what has been noted in a recent study (7.Zhou R. Cao X. Watson C. Miao Y. Guo Z. Forte J.G. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35651-35659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), full-length exogenous GFP-ezrin was localized to the plasma membranes, most prominently to the apical membrane vacuoles sequestered to the cell interior and somewhat more sparsely to the basolateral membrane surrounding the cells. The GFP-ezrin signal was relatively co-localized with F-actin (Fig. 2B, panels a–c). The distribution of the signal for the GFP-tagged N-terminal ezrin mutant constructs (N1 and N2) was similar to that for full-length ezrin, i.e. primarily associated with apical membrane vacuoles and to a lesser extent with the basolateral membrane (Fig. 2B, panels d and g). The distribution of F-actin also was not altered by the transfections (Fig. 2B, panels b, e, and h). However, the distribution of the signal for the GFP-tagged C-terminal ezrin mutants (C1 and C2) was distinctly different from that for full-length ezrin, i.e. primarily diffused throughout the cytoplasm, with no apparent localization to the apical membrane (Fig. 2B, panels j and m). Whereas the distribution of F-actin was also not altered by the transfections (Fig. 2B, panels k and n), the distribution of ezrin-C1 and ezrin-C2 no longer co-localized with actin (Fig. 2B, panels l and o). These data demonstrate that transfected GFP-tagged ezrin and N-terminal ezrin fragments are sufficient to localize to the apical plasma membrane of parietal cells. Ezrin Interacts with PALS1 via Its N Terminus—Stimulation of parietal cells by histamine results in dramatic expansion of the apical canalicular plasma membrane due to insertion of H,K-ATPase-containing vesicular membranes. Our recent study demonstrated that ezrin couples activation of protein kinase A to the apical membrane-cytoskeleton remodeling associated with parietal cell activation (7.Zhou R. Cao X. Watson C. Miao Y. Guo Z. Forte J.G. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003;"

The reaction sequence of the viral enzyme has been proposed comprising steps of 1) binding of GTP and S-adenosylmethionine, 2) formation of m7GTP and S-adenosylhomocysteine, 3) formation of the covalent (Enzyme-m7GMP) intermediate, and 4) transfer of m7GMP from the intermediate to the RNA acceptor. In this study the acceptor specificity of the viral enzyme was characterized. The results show that adenylate or guanylate with 5′-diphosphate group is an essential feature for acceptors, which can be RNA or mononucleotide, to receive m7GMP. The transfer rate of m7GMP to guanylate is greater than to adenylate by a factor of ∼3, and the Km value for mononucleotide acceptor is ∼103-fold higher than that for RNA. The capping efficiency of the viral genomic RNA transcript depends on the length of the transcript and the formation of a putative stem-loop structure, suggesting that mRNA capping process may participate in regulating the viral gene expression.

The capping efficiency of the viral genomic RNA transcript depends on the length of the transcript and the formation of a putative stem-loop structure, suggesting that mRNA capping process may participate in regulating the viral gene expression. The 5′ cap structure, m7G(5′)ppp(5′)N, of mRNA serves as a recognition site for ribosome binding in translation and is important for the stability of mRNA against the attack of 5′ exonuclease in eukaryotic cells. A series of three nuclear enzymatic activities is responsible for the formation of the cap structure (1.Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 101-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). First, the γ-phosphate at the 5′ end of nascent mRNA is removed by RNA 5′-triphosphatase; second, the GMP moiety of GTP molecule is transferred to the 5′-diphosphate end of the RNA via a 5′-5′ linkage by guanylyltransferase; and finally, a methyl group is added to N7 of the transferred guanylate from S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; BaMV, bamboo mosaic virus; AdoHcy, adenosylhomocysteine; pp, pyrophosphate. by methyltransferase. The cap formation pathway for viruses within the Alphavirus-like superfamily differs from the nuclear mechanism in that methylation of GTP occurs before transguanylation; in other words, m7GMP, rather than GMP, is transferred to the 5′ end of the 5′-diphosphate RNA during the cap formation process. This distinctive mRNA capping reaction is catalyzed by a group of distantly conserved AdoMet-dependent guanylyltransferases that were identified in Semliki Forest virus (2.Ahola T. Kääriäinen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), hepatitis E virus (3.Magden J. Takeda N. Li T. Auvinen P. Ahola T. Miyamura T. Merits A. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6249-6255Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), tobacco mosaic virus (4.Merits A. Kettunen R. Makinen K. Lampio A. Auvinen P. Kääriäinen L. Ahola T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), brome mosaic virus (5.Ahola T. Ahlquist P. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10061-10069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Kong F. Sivakumaran K. Kao C. Virology. 1999; 259: 200-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) (7.Li Y.-I. Chen Y.-J. Hsu Y.-H. Meng M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 782-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Together with other characteristics such as their membrane-association nature and distinctive protein primary structures, this class of enzyme represents a novel mRNA capping enzyme different from those evolutionally conserved guanylyltransferases and methyltransferases in DNA viruses, metazoans, and fungi. Although the critical roles of the conserved amino acids in the enzymatic activities of the enzyme of Semliki Forest virus (8.Ahola T. Laakkonen P. Vihinen H. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 392-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and BaMV (9.Huang Y.-L. Han Y.-T. Chang Y.-T. Hsu Y.-H. Meng M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have been addressed, the molecular mechanism of this class of enzyme is far from being understood. BaMV, a member of Alphavirus-like superfamily, has a ∼6.4-kilobase positive-strand RNA genome with a cap structure at the 5′ end and a poly(A) tail at the 3′ end (10.Lin N.-S. Lin B.-Y. Lo N.-W. Hu C.-C. Chow T.-Y. Hsu Y.-H. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 2513-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Open reading frame 1 of the viral genome encodes a 155-kDa replicase consisting of three functional domains. The N-terminal 442 amino acids constitute a mRNA capping enzyme domain exhibiting an AdoMet-dependent guanylyltransferase activity (7.Li Y.-I. Chen Y.-J. Hsu Y.-H. Meng M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 782-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the central region is a helicase-like domain harboring NT-Pase and RNA 5′-triphosphatase activities (11.Li Y.-I. Shih T.-W. Hsu Y.-H. Han Y.-T. Huang Y.-L. Meng M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12114-12120Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and the C-terminal part of the viral protein is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain (12.Li Y.-I. Cheng Y.-M. Huang Y.-L. Tsai C.-H. Hsu Y.-H. Meng M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10093-10099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that binds specifically to the 3′-pseudoknot structure of the viral RNA genome in vitro (13.Huang C.-Y. Huang Y.-L. Meng M. Hsu Y.-H. Tsai C.-H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2818-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Two subgenomic RNAs with lengths of ∼2 and ∼1 kilobases are produced during the replication cycle of the virus. The former subgenomic RNA encodes proteins required for the viral movement, whereas the latter is responsible for the production of the viral coat protein. A simple working model for the BaMV capping enzyme consisting of four reaction steps has been proposed based mainly on results of site-directed mutagenesis (9.Huang Y.-L. Han Y.-T. Chang Y.-T. Hsu Y.-H. Meng M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 1) GTP and AdoMet bind to the enzyme at close proximity to each other. 2) The methyl group from AdoMet is transferred to GTP, leading to the generation of m7GTP and AdoHcy. 3) An unidentified amino acid links covalently to the m7GMP moiety of m7GTP via a phosphoamide bond, resulting in the formation of the covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] intermediate. Persistent binding of AdoHcy to the enzyme is required for the formation of the covalent intermediate. 4) The m7GMP of the covalent intermediate is then transferred to the 5′ end of nascent RNA, whose 5′ γ-phosphate has been removed by RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity localized to the helicase-like domain of the viral replicase to form the 5′ cap structure. The apparent activity of AdoMet-dependent guanylyltransferase can, thus, be divided into GTP methyltransferase and m7GTP:mRNA guanylyltransferase activities as shown below. For GTP methyltransferase, enzyme + GTP + AdoMet → enzyme + m7GTP + AdoHcy (steps 1 and 2). For m7GTP:mRNA guanylyltransferase, enzyme + m7GTP + AdoHcy → [Enzyme-m7GMP] + PPi + AdoHcy (step 3) and [Enzyme-m7GMP] + ppRNA → m7GMP-ppRNA + enzyme step (Step 4). The two-activity-coupling notion in the context of the proposed model was supported by a couple of lines of evidence. 1) Substitution of His-68 by Ala in the BaMV capping enzyme increased the GTP methyltransferase activity but disabled the enzyme from forming the covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] intermediate (9.Huang Y.-L. Han Y.-T. Chang Y.-T. Hsu Y.-H. Meng M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); 2) the wild-type capping enzyme could form the covalent intermediate in the presence of m7GTP and AdoHcy. To provide more details regarding each of the steps in the proposed model and for better understanding of the replication mechanism of BaMV, the viral capping enzyme and the covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] intermediate were purified and characterized in this study. The step of transferring m7GMP from the covalent intermediate to RNA acceptor was particularly addressed. Chemicals—General chemicals and nucleotides (including m7GTP and m7GDP) were purchased from Sigma, whereas AdoMet, m7GpppG, and m7GpppA were from New England BioLabs. [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and [α-32P]m7GTP was synthesized in this study by the H68A mutant in reactions with [α-32P]GTP and AdoMet and purified with high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (9.Huang Y.-L. Han Y.-T. Chang Y.-T. Hsu Y.-H. Meng M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Protein Purification—The BaMV capping enzyme, fused with a His tag at its C terminus, was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and purified by a protocol consisting of steps of membrane fractionation, detergent extraction, and metal affinity chromatography as described previously (9.Huang Y.-L. Han Y.-T. Chang Y.-T. Hsu Y.-H. Meng M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The enzyme finally was in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer with 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.3% Sarkosyl. The 32P-labeled covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] intermediate was purified with a 3 ml of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography column (Qiagen) from a reaction mixture of 100 μg of the purified capping enzyme, 0.015 μm [α-32P]GTP, and 0.5 mm AdoMet in a 2-ml reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 75 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.15% Sarkosyl, and 0.6% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside). The purification protocol consisted of a washing step with 300 ml of reaction buffer and an elution step with 10 ml of elution buffer that contained 500 mm imidazole. The purified covalent intermediate was finally dialyzed in the same buffer as that preserved the purified BaMV capping enzyme. The helicase-like domain of the BaMV replicase was purified as described previously (11.Li Y.-I. Shih T.-W. Hsu Y.-H. Han Y.-T. Huang Y.-L. Meng M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12114-12120Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). RNA Preparation—The RNA molecule with a 5′ guanylate followed by 25 consecutive cytidylates, designated as G(C)25, was synthesized in vitro by using T7-MEGAshortscript kit (Ambion) with a double-strand DNA template annealed from oligonucleotides 5′-AATTTAATACGACTCACTATAG(C)25 and 5′-(G)25CTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAAATT. The underlined sequence represents the classic T7 promoter. CTP and GTP, GDP, or GMP (each 7.5 mm) were included in the reactions to synthesize pppG(C)25, ppG(C)25, or pG(C)25, respectively. A(C)25 was synthesized similarly with a template annealed from oligonucleotides 5′-AATTTAATACGACTCACTATTA(C)25 and 5′-(G)25TAATAGTGAGTCGTATTAAATT. The underlined sequence represents a class II T7 promoter that allows transcription to start from adenylate (14.Huang F. Bugg C.W. Yarus M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15548-15555Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). CTP and ATP, ADP, or AMP (each 7.5 mm) were used to synthesize pppA(C)25, ppA(C)25, or pA(C)25, respectively. RNA molecules related to the BaMV sequence were also synthesized in vitro with cDNA templates composed of the classic T7 promoter and corresponding regions of the BaMV genome. [γ-32P]GTP was included in the in vitro transcription reactions when 5′-[γ-32P]RNA was synthesized. All RNA molecules were finally purified by 8 m urea, PAGE. To remove the 5′ γ-phosphate of the BaMV RNA, 0.2 μm concentrations of the respective 5′-[γ-32P]RNA was incubated with 100 ng of the helicase-like domain of the BaMV replicase in a buffer that also contained 3 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 15 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 units of RNase inhibitor at 20 °C for 2 h. GTP Cross-linking—Ten μl of the purified capping enzyme (0.1 μg) was mixed with 10 μl of solution that contained 0.15 μm [γ-32P]GTP, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1.2% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and then placed into a 96-well plate in the presence or absence of 1 mm AdoMet. The mixture was irradiated on ice by using a single 15-W germicidal UV lamp held at a distance of 10 cm for 30 min. After adding with SDS (final 2%), the UV-cross-linked products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%) and visualized by phosphorimaging. Formation of the Covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] Intermediate—To determine the relative rates of forming the covalent intermediate using different nucleotide substrates, the purified capping enzyme (0.1 μg) was incubated with [α-32P]GTP (0.015 μm) and AdoMet (100 μm) or with [α-32P]m7GTP (0.015 μm) and AdoHcy (100 μm) at 30 °C for various times in a final 20-μl reaction buffer. To determine the pyrophosphate effect, the purified capping enzyme (0.1 μg), [α-32P]GTP (0.15 μm), AdoMet (0.5 mm), and pyrophosphate (1 mm) were included in a 20-μl reaction buffer at 30 °C for 90 min. When reactions involved inorganic pyrophosphatase, the partially purified capping enzyme (total 10 μg), still associated with yeast membrane fraction, was used in the reaction buffer without the addition of Sarkosyl. SDS (final 2%) was added at the ends of reactions, and formation of the 32P-labeled covalent intermediate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%) and visualized by phosphorimaging. Transfer of m7GMP from the Covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] Intermediate to Acceptors—Various nucleotides and RNA molecules were tested as acceptors in this study. The acceptor, at the concentrations indicated in figure legends 4–10, was incubated with the 32P-labeled covalent intermediate in a 20-μl reaction buffer. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for indicated periods of time. When the reactions were over, half of the reaction mixture was subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%) analysis, and the other half was subjected to TLC analysis. TLC—The enzyme reaction solution was extracted repeatedly with phenol/chloroform and chloroform, and the products in aqueous phase were analyzed by spotting 1 μl of the sample onto a polyethyleneiminecellulose TLC plate (20 × 20 cm) that was later developed with 0.45 m (NH4)2SO4 and visualized by phosphorimaging. The migration positions of standards were observed under UV light. GTP Binding—A previous mutational study showed that the presence of AdoHcy is essential for the BaMV capping enzyme to react with m7GTP and form the covalent [Enzymem7GMP] intermediate (9.Huang Y.-L. Han Y.-T. Chang Y.-T. Hsu Y.-H. Meng M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A crucial change of protein conformation induced by AdoHcy binding may involve this event. Because AdoMet and AdoHcy are structurally related, it became interesting to know whether AdoMet has a role in assisting the binding of GTP by inducing a similar protein conformational change. In this study, the binding affinity of the BaMV capping enzyme for GTP was assayed indirectly by irradiating the reaction mixture of the enzyme with [γ-32P]GTP in the presence or absence of AdoMet using a UV lamp (Fig. 1). Because [γ-32P]GTP, rather than [α-32P]GTP, was used in the reaction and EDTA was added to prevent the formation of the covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] intermediate, the protein bands appearing with radioactivity on the gels of SDS-PAGE should be the UV-cross-linked products. The data clearly showed that AdoMet could enhance both the wild type and H68A mutant to cross-link to GTP, suggesting that either the affinity for GTP was enhanced or the protein conformation was altered so that a photoreactive moiety was brought closer to GTP. The stronger cross-linking to GTP observed in H68A is consistent with the greater GTP methyltransferase activity of the mutant enzyme. The Rate-determining Step in the Path toward Forming the Covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] Intermediate—The covalent intermediate could be formed through reactions initiated with either GTP and AdoMet or m7GTP and AdoHcy (9.Huang Y.-L. Han Y.-T. Chang Y.-T. Hsu Y.-H. Meng M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Conceivably, the catalytic steps involved in the former reaction include a methyl transfer from AdoMet to GTP and the subsequent m7GMP transfer from m7GTP to the enzyme. In contrast, the latter reaction involves only the transfer of m7GMP. The relative formation rates of the covalent intermediate through the two reaction conditions were determined (Fig. 2). The nearly identical rates suggest that the methyl transfer from AdoMet to GTP occurs at a much greater rate than the transfer of m7GMP from m7GTP to the enzyme at the reaction conditions; in other words, the transfer of m7GMP is likely the rate-determining step along the course from the original substrates, GTP and AdoMet, to the covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] intermediate. Pyrophosphate Effect—To know whether pyrophosphate exerts a feedback inhibition against the formation of the covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] intermediate, it was included in the reaction mixture containing the BaMV capping enzyme, [α-32P]GTP, and AdoMet. The results showed that pyrophosphate indeed exhibited an inhibitory effect on the formation of the covalent intermediate, and this effect could be counteracted by pyrophosphatase (Fig. 3A). Besides inhibiting the formation of the covalent intermediate, pyrophosphate simultaneously increased the accumulation of m7GTP in the reaction solution of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 1 and 2). As expected, H68A did not response to pyrophosphate (Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 3 and 4) because it already lost the ability to form the covalent intermediate. The results also suggested that pyrophosphate has no effect on GTP methylation. Again, the results agree with the proposed reaction sequence of the BaMV capping enzyme in which blocking the step of forming the covalent intermediate would definitely result in the accumulation of m7GTP. Transfer of m7GMP from the Covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] Intermediate to Nucleotides—To characterize the reaction after the formation of the covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] intermediate, the radiolabeled intermediate was purified from the reaction mixture of the capping enzyme, [α-32P]GTP, and AdoMet by metal affinity chromatography (data not shown). Another set of experiments indicated, surprisingly, that a trace of GDP in the preparation of GTP may decrease the accumulation of the covalent intermediate, prompting us to ask whether certain nucleotides could act as acceptors to receive m7GMP from the covalent intermediate. A variety of nucleotides were, therefore, incubated with the purified covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] intermediate in this study (Fig. 4, A and B). GDP indeed reduced the amount of the covalent intermediate and produced m7GpppG simultaneously (lane 2), suggesting that m7GMP was transferred from the covalent intermediate to GDP rather than being released into the reaction solution in which free m7GMP would have otherwise appeared. ADP also reduced to a lesser extent the amount of the covalent intermediate and produced m7GpppA (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 8). dGDP and m7GDP seemed to have limited abilities to receive m7GMP (lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Other nucleotides apparently did not trigger the transfer of m7GMP onto them. Neither UDP nor CDP could receive m7GMP from the covalent intermediate (data not shown). Besides m7GpppG, a minor labeled product with a slow migrating rate also appeared on the TLC plate as m7GMP was transferred to GDP (Fig. 4A and 5A, lane 2). This product was converted to m7GpppG after nuclease P1 treatment (Fig. 4C, lane 3), suggesting that it arose from m7GMP transfer to an unknown GDP derivative in the GDP preparation. The effects of Mg2+ and pyrophosphate on the transguanylation reaction were further examined (Fig. 5). The result of mixing GDP with the covalent intermediate is shown again in lane 2 as a control. Exclusion of Mg2+ from the reaction mixture blocked the transfer reaction (lanes 3 and 4), indicating the Mg2+-dependent nature of the reaction. m7GTP appeared in the reaction products as pyrophosphate was added (lane 5), suggesting that the step of forming the covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] intermediate (step 3 in the proposed model) is reversible. The rates of transferring m7GMP from the covalent intermediate to GDP or ADP were compared (Fig. 6). The initial rate of forming m7GpppG was estimated to be ∼2.5-fold faster than that of forming m7GpppA based on the kinetic data shown on panel C.Fig. 5Effect of Mg2+ and pyrophosphate on the formation of m7GpppG. The 32P-labeled covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] intermediate and GDP (1 mm) were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h in buffer conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures” with some modifications as indicated.

The data clearly demonstrated the transfer of m7GMP from the covalent intermediate to RNA substrates in the period of incubation. The amounts of the covalent intermediate decreased gradually with time, whereas the radiolabeling of RNA increased. The rate of m7GMP transfer from the covalent intermediate to ppG(C)25 was greater than that to ppA(C)25 by a factor of ∼3.8 according to the kinetic data shown on panel C. Taken together with the nucleotide preference described above, we concluded that the BaMV capping enzyme prefers guanylate to adenylate as the acceptor of m7GMP from the covalent intermediate. RNA molecules with tri, di, or monophosphate at the 5′ end were further assayed in the transfer reactions. Apparently, RNA molecules with a 5′-diphosphate end were ready to receive m7GMP from the covalent intermediate, whereas molecules with 5′-trisphosphate end were also able to accept m7GMP albeit to a lesser extent (Fig. 8, A and B). To examine the cap structures formed at the 5′ end of RNA molecules, the radiolabeled RNA products were recovered, treated with nuclease P1, and analyzed by TLC. Upon the hydrolysis of the reaction products originally from ppG(C)25 and ppA(C)25, the appearances of m7GpppG and m7GpppA were observed, respectively, indicating that normal cap0 structures were formed at the RNA molecules (Fig. 8C). m7GpppG and m7GpppA instead of m7GppppG and m7GppppA were also recovered from products originally from pppG(C)25 and pppA(C)25, respectively, suggesting that 5′-trisphosphate-terminated RNA was actually not able to receive m7GMP from the covalent intermediate. The false-positive results shown on Fig. 8, panel A might arise from traces of ppG(C)25 and ppA(C)25 in pppG(C)25 and pppA(C)25, respectively, due to the contaminating presence of NDP in the NTP component used in the in vitro transcription reaction. In summary, the data thus far conclude that a 5′-diphosphate group at guanosine, adenosine, or RNA is essential for the molecules to accept m7GMP transferred from the covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] intermediate. Because the viral capping enzyme could use RNA as well as nucleotide as the m7GMP acceptor, knowing the affinities of the two potential acceptors would be important toward understanding the viral replication mechanism. The radiolabeled covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] intermediate was, thus, incubated with either ppG(C)25 or GDP over a wide range of concentrations. The magnitude of m7GMP transfer exhibited acceptor concentration-dependent manners with KRNAm = ∼0.4 μm and KGDPm = ∼0.4 mm (Fig. 9). The 1000-fold difference in Km values suggests that RNA is a much more favorable acceptor than mononucleotide to receive m7GMP from the covalent intermediate.Fig. 8Requirement of a diphosphate group at the 5′ end of RNA to accept m7GMP. RNA substrates with 5′-tri, di, or monophosphates (each 1 μm) were incubated with the 32P-labeled covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] intermediate at 30 °C for 1 h in buffer conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Parts of the reaction mixture were then treated with proteinase K and analyzed by 8 m urea, PAGE (20% polyacrylamide) (panel A). Numbers on the left edge indicate the lengths of RNA markers. Panel B shows the presence of RNA by staining the polyacrylamide gel with toluidine blue. RNA molecules in the rest of the reaction mixture were recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and subsequently treated with RNase P1. The digested products were then analyzed by TLC (panel C). Arrows along the edges of the plate indicate the migration positions of markers m7GpppG and m7GpppA.

It was, therefore, interesting to know when the newly transcribed RNA initiates the process of capping and whether the nucleotide sequences and structures play roles in regulating the process. To answer these questions, RNA molecules with different lengths were synthesized by in vitro transcription reactions. RNA 5′-25, 5′-50, 5′-138, and 5′-200 correspond to the first 25, 50, 138, and 200 nucleotides, respectively, of the BaMV genomic RNA. A stem-loop structure encompassing nucleotides 34–118 was predicted using Mfold software (15.Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10412) Google Scholar) (Fig. 10A). At first, the 5′-[γ-32P]RNAs were treated with the helicase-like domain of the BaMV replicase to remove the γ-phosphate (Fig. 10B) and then incubated with the radiolabeled covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] intermediate. The formation of the cap structure at the 5′ end of RNA was indicated by the reappearance of radiolabeling on RNA molecules. The formation of the cap reached a plateau at ∼30 min for RNA 5′-138 and 5′-200, whereas RNA 5′-50, and 5′-25 were capped slowly and to lesser extents (Fig. 10C). The relative rates of cap formation were compared again by including all the four RNA molecules in a reaction mixture. The cap formation reached a plateau at 30 min for the two longer molecules; nonetheless, the cap formation rates for RNA 5′-50 and 5′-25 were merely ∼⅕ and 1/10, respectively, that for the longer RNA molecules under this competitive condition (Fig. 10, D and E). To find out the importance of the putative stem-loop structure in the RNA capping process, two RNA molecules were synthesized; one (40–113 rev) has a reverse sequence of nucleotides 44–109 that retains the stem-loop structure, whereas the other (40–113 mut) has sequence altered so that the long stem structure no longer exists (Fig. 11A). The two RNA molecules were first treated with the helicase-like domain and then incubated with the radiolabeled covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] intermediate. The formation of the cap on RNA 40–113 rev was at a rate ∼2-fold faster than that on 40–113 mut (Fig. 11B), suggesting that the long stem-loop structure is an important feature for RNA molecules to be capped efficiently.Fig. 11Effect of RNA structure on the RNA capping efficiency.Panel A, nucleotide sequences and secondary structures of the RNA molecules predicted by Mfold. RNA 40–113 rev has a reverse sequence of nucleotides 44–109 of the BaMV genome that maintains the stem-loop structure, whereas 40–113 mut has a mutated sequence that abolishes the structure. Panel B, RNA 40–113 rev and 40–113 mut were first treated with the helicase-like domain of the BaMV replicase to remove their 5′ γ-phosphate and then incubated with the 32P-labeled covalent intermediate at 30 °C for the indicated periods of time. The percentage of capped RNA was estimated by designating the pixels of RNA 40–113 rev at 60 min as 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Results in this study allow us to add several details into the proposed working model of the BaMV capping enzyme (1.Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 101-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Upon substrate binding, AdoMet indeed stimulated the cross-linking of GTP to the viral enzyme. An analogous result has been demonstrated in vaccinia virus guanine-N7 methyltransferase in which the cross-linking of the cap structure of RNA to the enzyme is stimulated by concurrent occupancy of the AdoMet/AdoHcy binding site (16.Mao X. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6900-6910Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To explain the result, the authors proposed an AdoMet binding-eliciting active-site conformational change, that either (i) enhances the affinity for the cap guanosine at the cap binding site or (ii) alters the protein interface so that a photoreactive moiety is brought closer to the cap structure at the cap site, and as a result, the cap is better poised to be UV-cross-linked to the enzyme. A similar proposition should be applicable to the BaMV capping enzyme (2.Ahola T. Kääriäinen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Methylation of GTP occurred probably at a much faster rate than the subsequent transfer of m7GMP from m7GTP to an unidentified active-site residue (3.Magden J. Takeda N. Li T. Auvinen P. Ahola T. Miyamura T. Merits A. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6249-6255Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Mg2+ was essential for the transguanylation reaction; in contrast, it was dispensable for the transfer of the methyl group from AdoMet to GTP (data not shown) (4.Merits A. Kettunen R. Makinen K. Lampio A. Auvinen P. Kääriäinen L. Ahola T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The step of forming the covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] intermediate is reversible; pyrophosphate could not only exert a product inhibition effect on the forward reaction but also trigger the backward reaction, leading to the regeneration of m7GTP (5.Ahola T. Ahlquist P. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10061-10069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regarding the structural requirement for acceptors to receive m7GMP from the covalent intermediate, guanylate or adenylate with a 5′-diphosphate group is essential. This property would assure the formation of normal cap structures at the 5′ end of the viral RNA transcripts. Furthermore, there would be no cap at the negative-strand viral RNA, because it is synthesized initially with an uridylate residue (6.Kong F. Sivakumaran K. Kao C. Virology. 1999; 259: 200-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17.Cheng J.-H. Peng C.-W. Hsu Y.-H. Tsai C.-H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6114-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In terms of acceptor selectivity, the viral enzyme preferred guanylate to adenylate. A putative stem-loop structure at the 5′ region of the genomic RNA is important for efficient capping reaction of the RNA itself. The Mg2+ dependence and the reversibility of the reaction for the formation of the covalent [enzyme-m7GMP] intermediate probably reflect the chemical natures of the reaction, because similar characteristics have also been demonstrated in reactions of the guanylyltransferase from mammals (18.Venkatesan S. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), yeast (19.Itoh N. Mizumoto K. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13930-13936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and vaccinia virus (20.Shuman S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This study also demonstrated that the BaMV capping enzyme can recognize GDP or ADP as an acceptor to receive m7GMP from the covalent intermediate and consequently forms the free cap analog, m7GpppG or m7GpppA, respectively. This property distinguishes the BaMV capping enzyme from that of yeast (19.Itoh N. Mizumoto K. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13930-13936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mammalian cells (21.Venkatesan S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2835-2842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in that they cannot cap a mononucleotide. The ∼0.4 mm KGDPm value suggests that m7GpppG has a great chance to exist in the proximity of the viral replication complex within the host cells after all GDP can be provided from the hydrolysis of GTP by the helicase-like domain of the viral replicase (11.Li Y.-I. Shih T.-W. Hsu Y.-H. Han Y.-T. Huang Y.-L. Meng M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12114-12120Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This consideration raised the question as to whether m7GpppG, if it does exist, can be the first nucleotide leading the synthesis of the viral RNA transcripts. To answer the question, we have mixed m7GpppG with NTPs in the reaction mixture of the in vitro RNA-dependent RNA polymerase assay and found that the addition of m7GpppG actually reduced the synthesis of the positive-strand viral RNA (data not shown), suggesting that pretranscriptional capping is an unlikely event. This study also showed that GDP is preferred by the covalent [Enzyme-m7GMP] intermediate to donate m7GMP over ADP. This preference was observed also when RNA was the acceptor. This suggests that GDP and ADP should occupy an identical catalytic pocket as their counterparts at the 5′ end of the RNA acceptors during transguanylation; however, the pocket should be spacious enough to accommodate the rest of the RNA substrate. The small Km value of the RNA acceptor (∼0.4 μm for ppG(C)25) suggests that the whole part of the RNA substrate contributes to the binding. The genomic RNA of BaMV has a guanylate residue at its 5′ end, whereas the ∼2- and ∼1-kilobase subgenomic RNAs start with adenylate (22.Lee Y.-S. Lin B.-Y. Hsu Y.-H. Chang B.-Y. Lin N.-S. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, interesting to know whether the capping efficiency of the viral RNA would actually be affected by the type of nucleotide at its very 5′ end and whether the speculative difference in the capping efficiency is involved in mechanisms of regulating the viral protein expression. Some viruses of the Alphavirus-like superfamily, e.g. Semliki Forest virus (23.Takkinen K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 5667-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and Sindbis virus (24.Strauss E.G. Rice C.M. Strauss J.H. Virology. 1984; 133: 92-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), have adenylate at the 5′ end of their genomic RNAs. Do their capping enzymes, in contrast, prefer adenylate to guanylate as the acceptor for m7GMP? Could this be part of the underlying reason for the difference of the first nucleotide in different viruses within the superfamily? Answers for these questions will be valuable toward understanding the role of RNA capping process in the evolution of the viruses. Timing of the cap formation at the 5′ end of the newly transcribed RNA may be crucial for the survival of virus. A recent study on the capping of human immunodeficiency virus mRNA shows that the capping reaction cannot occur until the nascent mRNA has attained a chain length of 19–22 nucleotides (25.Chiu Y.-L. Ho C.K. Saha N. Schwer B. Shuman S. Rana T.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 585-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Regarding the genomic RNA of BaMV, we hypothesize that the cap structure is rarely formed before the first 50 nucleotides being synthesized but is formed mostly after the chain of nucleotides is long enough to form the putative stem-loop structure, which may enhance the RNA recognition by the BaMV capping enzyme. Together with the specific interaction of the C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain with the 3′-pseudoknot RNA structure (13.Huang C.-Y. Huang Y.-L. Meng M. Hsu Y.-H. Tsai C.-H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2818-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), both ends of the genomic RNA may, therefore, interact indirectly with each other via binding of the viral replicase and form a closed loop structure, reminiscent of eukaryotic messenger ribonucleoprotein particle (26.Wells S.E. Hillner P.E. Vale R.D. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 135-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Such a structure would have roles in promoting translation and protecting the viral RNA from degradation. In summary, the dependence of capping efficiency on RNA structure implies that the capping process may participate in regulating the BaMV gene expression. Whether the 5′ regions of the subgenomic RNAs form specific structures and influence the efficiency of capping of their RNA remains to be investigated."

Consistent with these findings, it has also been reported that SCCA protein targets a potent allergen and an extrinsic cysteine proteinase in house-dust mites, which is thought to play a pathogenic role in allergic asthma (8Sakata Y.

These genes have also been designated SERPINB3 and SERPINB4, respectively, according to the new nomenclature guidelines (reviewed in Ref. 6Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Coughlin P.B. Gettins P.G. Irving J.A. Lomas D.A. Luke C.J. Moyer R.W. Pemberton P.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Salvesen G.S. Travis J. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol.

The SCCA locus in the mouse contains 4 genes of which Serpinb3a, also known as SQN-5 and SCCA-2, is clearly related to both SCCA-1 and SCCA-2 in humans. Mouse serpinb3a is both a cysteine- and trypsin-like serine proteinase inhibitor (9Askew D.J. Askew Y.S. Kato Y. Luke C.J. Pak S.C. Bromme D. Silverman G.A. Genomics. 2004; 84: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and it is expressed in tissues in which human SCCA-1 and SCCA-2 are also expressed. Thus, Serpinb3a, which is referred to as SCCA-2 in this paper, is the mouse ortholog of human SCCA-1 and SCCA-2 (6Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Coughlin P.B. Gettins P.G.

Our results show that compared with WT mice, the lungs of UG-KO mice express markedly elevated levels of SCCA-2 mRNA and protein, which are further augmented by OVA sensitization and challenge. Most importantly, treatment of the OVA-sensitized UG-KO mice with rUG prior to OVA challenge dramatically suppresses the expression of SCCA-2. Using cultured human bronchial epithelial cells, we further demonstrate that both IL-4 and IL-13 stimulate the expression of SCCA-1 and SCCA-2 genes, which are human orthologs of mouse SCCA-2 (10Schick C.

Since UG inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 production (4Mandal A.K. Zhang Z. Ray R. Choi M.S. Chowdhury B. Pattabiraman N. Mukherjee A.B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1317-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and these cytokines stimulate SCCA gene expression, we propose that by down-regulating the expression and signaling of these Th2 cytokines UG inhibits SCCA gene expression associated with allergic asthma.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Chicken OVA (grade V), protease inhibitor mixture, phosphatase inhibitor mixture, and leflunomide were purchased from Sigma. Human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC), the small airway epithelial growth medium bullet kit, and SABM basal medium were purchased from Bio-Whittaker, Inc. (Walkersville, MD). Human IL-4 and IL-13 were purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Antibodies against STAT-1, phospho-Tyr-STAT-1, STAT-6, phospho-Tyr-STAT-6, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Antibody for human SCCA-1 and SCCA-2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Pre-cast SDS-polyacrylamide (4–15%) gels were obtained from Bio-Rad.Mice—UG-KO mice were generated as described previously (13Zhang Z. Kundu G.C. Yuan C.-J. Ward J.M. Mantile G. Miele L. Mukherjee A.B. Science. 1997; 276: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Both UG-KO and WT mice were maintained under germ-free conditions, and all experiments were performed according to an institutionally approved animal care and use protocol. The methodology for inducing airway inflammation by OVA is previously reported (3Chen L.C. Zhang Z. Myers A.C. Huang S.K. J.

Nearly 60–70% confluent cells were washed twice with SABM basal medium and then cultured in the basal medium in presence or absence of human IL-4 (10 ng/ml) and IL-13 (50 ng/ml) for 24 h as described previously (14Yuyama N.

To determine the signaling pathway(s) of IL-4- and IL-13-induced SCCA expression the cells were treated with leflunomide (100 μm-250 μm) in the presence and absence of each of these cytokines.RNA Isolation and SCCA-2 mRNA Expression by Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA (∼600 ng) was reverse-transcribed using Taq-Man RT reagent (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) as described previously (4Mandal A.K. Zhang Z. Ray R. Choi M.S. Chowdhury B. Pattabiraman N. Mukherjee A.B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1317-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The primers for SCCA-2 (sense, 5′-ATG ATT GTC CTG TTG CCA GT-3′; antisense, 5′ TTC TGC TCT TGT CCA CTC CA-3′) and 18S (sense, 5′-GAC TCA ACA CGG GAA ACC TC-3′; antisense, 5′-CTC CAC CAA CTA AGA ACG GC-3′) were used for PCR. The data from each PCR run were analyzed using ABI Prism Software version 1.01 (Applied Biosystems). The final data were normalized to 18 S rRNA and presented as fold increase compared with the expression level in WT mice. Quantitation was performed using three independent total RNA samples for each treatment group.SCCA-2 Antibody Generation—Rabbits were immunized using recombinant glutathione S-transferase-SerpinB3a fusion protein, which was produced and purified as described previously (12Bartuski A.J. Kamachi Y. Schick C. Massa H. Trask B.J. Silverman G.A. Genomics. 1998; 54: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Serum was diluted as described for Western applications.Western Blot Analysis of Mouse SCCA-2 Protein Expression—To detect the SCCA-2 protein, lungs were homogenized in extracting buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Sigma-Aldrich). Total protein (20 μg) from each sample was resolved by electrophoresis using 4–15% SDS-polyacryamide gels under denaturing and reducing conditions and electrotransferred onto the nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Immunoblot analysis was performed using rabbit polyclonal SCCA-2 antibody at 1:2000 dilution. HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000) served as the secondary antibody. Chemiluminescent detection was performed by using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total protein loading standard β-actin was detected using an actin (Ab-1) kit (Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Immunodetection of Human SCCAs and STATs in HBEC—Total protein (20 μg) from cell lysates was resolved and electrotransferred on the nitrocellulose membrane as described above. Human SCCA-1 and SCCA-2 proteins were detected by using mouse monoclonal anti-human SCCA-1 and SCCA-2 antibodies (1:400), and HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG served as the secondary antibody (1:2000). The levels of non-phospho- and phospho-STAT-1 and STAT-6 were detected by following the manufacturer's protocol.Tissue Fixation and Immunofluorescence—The lung tissues were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and the sections were stained with rabbit SCCA-2 antibody (1:500) followed by counter staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit (1:1000) secondary antibody. The stained slides were examined by using a Zeiss Axiotroph Microscope, and digital photomicrographs were recorded.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn this study, we demonstrate that SCCA-2 gene expression in UG-KO mouse lungs is markedly higher than in those of WT littermates. In addition, we show that allergen (OVA) sensitization and challenge further augments these levels and, most importantly, that rUG treatment suppresses SCCA-2 expression. Furthermore, using HBEC we demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 stimulate the expression of both SCCA-1 and SCCA-2 genes (orthologs of murine SCCA-2), and these cytokines mediate SCCA gene expression via STAT-1 and/or STAT-6 activation.We previously reported that OVA sensitization and challenge in UG-KO mice elicit exaggerated inflammatory response in the airways, which is suppressed by rUG treatment (4Mandal A.K. Zhang Z. Ray R. Choi M.S. Chowdhury B. Pattabiraman N. Mukherjee A.B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1317-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We also reported that lack of UG causes overexpression of Th2 cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-13, which play critical role(s) in airway inflammation in asthma (reviewed in Ref. 15Izuhara K. Arima K. Yasunaga S. Curr. Drug Targets Inflamm. Allergy. 2002; 1: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that overexpression of SCCA-1 and SCCA-2 in the lungs is associated with human bronchial asthma (14Yuyama N. Davies D.E. Akaiwa M. Matsui K. Hamasaki Y. Suminami Y. Yoshida N.L. Maeda M. Pandit A. Lordan J.L. Kamogawa Y. Arima K. Nagumo F. Sugimachi M. Berger A. Richards I. Roberds S.L. Yamashita T. Kishi F. Kato H. Arai K. Ohshima K. Tadano J. Hamasaki N. Miyatake S. Sugita Y. Holgate S.T. Izuhara K. Cytokine. 2002; 19: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), an airway inflammatory disease in which allergens play critical pathogenic roles. To determine whether there is a relationship between UG and SCCA-2 gene expression, we first studied the expression of SCCA-2 mRNA in the lungs of UG-KO mice and in those of their WT littermates by quantitative RT-PCR. We found that the level of SCCA-2 mRNA is markedly elevated in the lungs of UG-KO mice (Fig. 1A). Consistent with these results, the Western blot analysis showed that the SCCA-2 protein level is also markedly eleveated in UG-KO mouse lungs (Fig. 1B). Detection of SCCA-2 protein by immunofluorescence shows that while a very low level of SCCA-2 is present in the lungs of WT mice (Fig. 1C, panel a), intense immunofluorescence is present in the bronchial epithelial cells of UG-KO mice (Fig. 1C, panel c). Preimmune serum failed to detect any SCCA-2 in WT (Fig. 1C, panel b) and in UG-KO (Fig. 1C, paned d) mice. Taken together, these results suggest that lack of UG causes elevated expression of the SCCA-2 gene in mice.To determine whether allergen sensitization and challenge in UG-KO mice alters the levels of SCCA-2 gene expression, we determined the SCCA-2 mRNA and protein expression in the lungs of allergen (OVA)-sensitized and -challenged UG-KO mice and compared the results with those of WT mice. We also carried out experiments in which the UG-KO mice were OVA-sensitized and then treated with rUG prior to OVA challenge and analyzed the production of SCCA-2. The results show that the SCCA-2 mRNA level in the lungs of OVA-sensitized and -challenged WT mice is higher than that of the control WT mice, which were not sensitized or challenged with OVA (Fig. 2A). However, in the lungs of OVA-sensitized and -challenged UG-KO mice markedly elevated levels of SCCA-2 mRNA were detected compared with those of the UG-KO littermates that were not sensitized or challenged with OVA. Most importantly, rUG treatment of the OVA-sensitized UG-KO mice prior to OVA challenge markedly inhibited the level of SCCA-2 mRNA (Fig. 2A). Consistent with these results, Western blot analysis showed a high level of SCCA-2 protein expression (Fig. 2B). The results of the Western blot analysis were further confirmed by immunofluorescence using SCCA-2 antibody (Fig. 2C, panels a–e). These results show that compared with the bronchial epithelia of control WT mice (Fig. 2C, panel a), OVA-sensitized and -challenged WT mice (Fig. 2C, panel b) manifested a slightly higher level of SCCA-2 immunofluorescence. However, although the untreated UG-KO mouse lungs (Fig. 2C, panel c) had a higher intensity of SCCA-2 immunofluorescence compared with that of WT control, the bronchial epithelia of OVA-sensitized and -challenged UG-KO mice yielded the highest immunofluorescence (Fig. 2C, panel d). Most importantly, treatment of the OVA-sensitized UG-KO mice with rUG prior to OVA challenge markedly suppressed the level of SCCA-2 immunofluorescence (Fig. 2C, panel e). These results demonstrate that lack of UG in the lungs of UG-KO mice up-regulates SCCA-2 gene expression in the bronchial epithelia and this expression is further augmented by allergen sensitization and challenge. Most importantly, rUG treatment markedly suppresses SCCA-2 gene expression.Fig. 2UG suppresses allergen-induced SCCA-2 expression in the lungs.

Furthermore, in asthma, a chronic airway inflammatory disease, Th2 cytokines, especially IL-4 and IL-13, play critical pathogenic roles. Interestingly, in patients suffering from asthma lower than normal UG levels have also been reported (17Zhang Z. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Wang N. Gerhard D.S. Stone E.M. Arbour N.C. De Vries H.G.

Moreover, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the UG gene (18Kim Y.S. Kang D. Kwon D.Y. Park W.Y. Kim H. Lee D.S. Lim C.S. Han J.S. Kim S. Lee J.S. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) that down-regulates UG expression (21) positively correlated with asthma (18Kim Y.S. Kang D. Kwon D.Y. Park W.Y. Kim H. Lee D.S. Lim C.S. Han J.S. Kim S. Lee J.S. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We previously reported that in OVA-sensitized and -challenged UG-KO mice, IL-4 and IL-13 levels are elevated, which are suppressed by rUG treatment (4Mandal A.K. Zhang Z. Ray R. Choi M.S. Chowdhury B. Pattabiraman N. Mukherjee A.B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1317-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Since both IL-4 and IL-13 stimulate SCCA-2 gene expression (7Izuhara K. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2003; 41: 860-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), it is likely that by inhibiting the levels of IL-4 and IL-13, UG suppresses SCCA-2 gene expression. However, the mechanism of IL-4- and IL-13-induced SCCA-2 gene expression, until now, remained unclear.To determine the mechanism(s) by which IL-4 and IL-13 stimulate SCCA-2 expression, we treated HBEC with either IL-4 or IL-13 and determined the production of SCCA-2 by Western blot analysis. We found that both IL-4 and IL-13 treatments stimulate the expression of human SCCA-1 and SCCA-2 (Fig. 3A). To determine the mechanism of regulation of SCCA gene expression, we first studied the phosphorylation of the transcription factors, STAT-1 and STAT-6, as it has been previously reported that the 5′-regulatory region of the SCCA genes contain a STAT-binding site (11Schneider S.S. Schick C. Fish K.E. Miller E. Pena J.C. Treter S.D. Hui S.M. Silverman G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3147-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 12Bartuski A.J. Kamachi Y. Schick C. Massa H. Trask B.J. Silverman G.A. Genomics. 1998; 54: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that both STAT-1 and STAT-6 activation require phosphorylation on tyrosine. Accordingly, we studied tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1 and STAT-6 by Western blot analysis. Our results show that both IL-4 and IL-13 treatments of the cells stimulate STAT-1 and STAT-6 phosphorylation on tyrosine without altering the STAT-1 and STAT-6-protein levels (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Th2 cytokine-induced SCCA expression and STAT-phosphorylation in HBEC.

Our results show that leflunomide inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1 and STAT-6 induced by IL-4 (Fig. 4A), IL-13 (Fig. 4B), and IL-4 plus IL-13 (Fig. 4C) in a dose-dependent manner. Most importantly, leflunomide-mediated inhibition of IL-4-, IL-13-, and IL-4 + IL-13-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in STAT-1 and STAT-6 leads to the suppression of SCCA-1 and SCCA-2 expression (Fig. 4, A–C). Taken together, our results for the first time demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 signaling is mediated via STAT-1 as well as STAT-6 and that tyrosine phosphorylation of these transcription factors is critical for IL-4- and IL-13-induced SCCA gene expression.Fig. 4Inhibition of STAT phosphorylation suppresses SCCA expression. Human bronchial epithelial cells were grown to 60–70% confluence and treated with either IL-4 (A), IL-13 (B), or a combination of IL-4 and IL-13 (C) for 24 h in serum-free basal medium in absence and presence of varying concentrations of leflunomide.

Transformation of cytokine-dependent hematopoietic cells, such as Ba/F3 cells to autonomous growth and tumorigenicity equally results in selection for constitutive activation of STAT5. We compared STAT5 signaling between erythropoietin(Epo)-dependent cells and cells that were transformed by oncogenic activation of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) by coexpression of the gp55-P envelope protein of the spleen focus forming virus or by expression of the R129C constitutively active EpoR mutant. In transformed cells it was mainly STAT5B that was constitutively activated. In contrast, Epo stimulation activated both STAT5A and STAT5B. In transformed cells, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed STAT5 to be physically bound to promoters of STAT5 target genes, such as BclXL, and to be able to promote transactivation of the BclXL promoter in a constitutive fashion. Sequencing of native sequences after ChIP with anti-STAT5 antibodies in Epo-dependent and -transformed cells indicated that in gp55-transformed cells, STAT5B bound in the chromatin not only to N3 high affinity, but also to low affinity N4 GAS sites. Transactivation for N3 GAS sites in luciferase reporters was specific to gp55 transformation. Because we also found preferential constitutive STAT5B activation after transformation of cells by a truncated form of the G-CSF-R that produces severe neutropenia (Kostmann syndrome) and favors leukemia in humans, we discuss the potential role of STAT5B in oncogenic transformation of hematopoietic cells.

Binding of a cytokine to its receptor leads to activation of Janus kinases and phosphorylation of the receptor itself, creating docking sites for SH2 domains containing proteins such as STATs. After recruitment, STAT proteins are phosphorylated, dimerize as homo- or heterodimers, and translocate to the nucleus where they bind to consensus sequences of the chromatin and modulate transcription (2.Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3356) Google Scholar). Association on the chromatin of different STAT complexes with regulating proteins/transcription factors contributes to the specificity of transcriptional regulation. STAT5 (STAT5A and/or STAT5B) is activated by a broad range of cytokines like prolactin (3.Pallard C. Gouilleux F. Charon M. Groner B. Gisselbrecht S. Dusanter-Fourt I. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 2345-2352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), are the most important negative regulators of the pathway. Prolonged activation of STAT5 after Epo stimulation is characteristic of benign erythrocytosis, induced by hypersensitivity to low levels of Epo, because of a receptor heterozygous truncation (41.Arcasoy M.O. Harris K.W. Forget B.G. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 63-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, such hypersensitivity to Epo or transgenic expression of Epo has not been associated with induction of leukemia (42.Semenza G.L. Traystman M.D. Gearhart J.D. Antonarakis S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2301-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Pathologically, the murine EpoR can be activated by coexpression of the envelope protein gp55 of the polycytemic (P) strain of the spleen focus forming virus (SFFV) (43.Ruscetti S.K. Baillieres Clin. Haematol. 1995; 8: 225-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). gp55-P (gp55) is able to bind to the EpoR (44.Casadevall N. Lacombe C. Muller O. Gisselbrecht S. Mayeux P. J.

Virol. 1990; 64: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of gp55-P triggers an expansion of erythroid progenitors, which upon subsequent acquisition of genetic defects leads to erythroleukemia (49.Moreau-Gachelin F. Ray D. de Both N.J. van der Feltz M.J. Tambourin P. Tavitian A. Leukemia. 1990; 4: 20-23PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation of gp55-transformed cells is constitutive (50.Ohashi T. Masuda M. Ruscetti S.K. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 251-254PubMed Google Scholar, 51.Yamamura Y. Senda H. Kageyama Y. Matsuzaki T. Noda M. Ikawa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1172-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Yet another mechanism of activation of the EpoR in a ligand-independent manner is represented by the R129C point mutation in the extracellular domain. This mutation leads to disulfide-linked dimeric receptor (52.Watowich S.S. Yoshimura A. Longmore G.D. Hilton D.J. Yoshimura Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2140-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), which renders cells ligand-independent for their growth (53.Yoshimura A. Longmore G. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1990; 348: 647-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Retroviral expression of the constitutively active EpoR R129C mutant in mice leads to leukemias of different lineages (54.Longmore G.D. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1991; 67: 1089-1102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Constitutive STAT5 DNA binding was detectable in the nucleus of cells expressing the EpoR R129C (55.Longmore G.D. You Y. Molden J. Liu K.D. Mikami A. Lai S.Y. Pharr P. Goldsmith M.A. Blood. 1998; 91: 870-878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated STAT5 signaling in cells stimulated by Epo or transformed to autonomous growth by gp55 coexpression or by the R129C point mutation. We found that in cytokine-independent cells the constitutively active pool of nuclear STAT5 is essentially STAT5B and could be resolved from another pool, which is responsive to Epo stimulation (STAT5A and STAT5B). In transformed cells, STAT5 was physically bound to the STAT binding sites in the promoters of known STAT5 target genes, such as BclXL and able to promote transactivation of the BclXL promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing of native sequences bound by STAT5 (STAT5A and STAT5B), STAT5A, or STAT5B, and transactivation assays of different known STAT5-targeted promoters showed that in gp55-transformed cells, STAT5B binds in the chromatin not only to γ-interferon-activated sites (GAS, N3 high affinity), but also to low affinity N4 GAS sites. This binding to N4 sites of STAT5 in the gp55-transformed cells was not seen after Epo treatment. Among the STAT5 target genes we found that Cis, which is a negative regulator, is regulated differently than BclXL. To assert the biological relevance of this finding, we studied STAT5 activation in Ba/F3 cells transformed with a truncated form of the granulocyte colony-stimulated factor receptor (GCSFR) involved in severe neutropenia (Kostmann syndrome) (56.Dong F. Dale D.C. Bonilla M.A. Freedman M. Fasth A. Neijens H.J. Palmblad J. Briars G.L. Carlsson G. Veerman A.J. Welte K. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P.

We found that in Ba/F3 cells transformed by the truncated GCSFR STAT5B and not STAT5A was also preferentially constitutively activated. We suggest that these biochemical and transcriptional differences are important for oncogenic transformation of hematopoietic cells. Cell Culture—The Epo-dependent mouse erythroleukemia HCD57 cells (48.Ruscetti S.K. Janesch N.J. Chakraborti A. Sawyer S.T. Hankins W.D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were routinely cultivated in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM, Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.), 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FBS, Perbio), 1 unit/ml Epo (from Amgen), 10 μl/liter β-mercaptoethanol. Ba/F3 cells expressing the EpoR were obtained from the mouse IL3-dependent pro-B Ba/F3 cells (59.Palacios R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), after transfection with pcDNA3 coding for EpoR and vector coding for the antibiotic resistance gene and selection for antibiotic resistance (clone IH) or after transduction with a bicistronic retrovirus encoding for the EpoR and GFP, and selection for high levels of EpoR by cell sorting for GFP expression (pool Ba/F3-EpoR) (45.Constantinescu S.N. Liu X. Beyer W. Fallon A. Shekar S. Henis Y.I. Smith S.O. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3334-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells were routinely cultivated in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% FBS, and 1 unit/ml Epo. Ba/F3 IH55 (IH55) and HCD57-gp55 cells were obtained after transfection of IH and HCD57 cells, respectively, with a gp55-P-encoding construct and selection for growth in the absence of Epo. EpoR R219C (R129C) cells were obtained after transfection of the Ba/F3-EpoR cells with the EpoR R129C mutant and selection for growth in the absence of Epo. The HA-tagged wild-type GCSFR and HA-tagged GCSFR (containing a cytoplasmic Q718→Stop mutation) cDNAs were cloned into the pMX-IRES-GFP bicistronic retroviral vector (60.Liu X. Constantinescu S.N. Sun Y. Bogan J.S. Hirsch D. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Retroviral supernatants were generated by transient transfection of BOSC cells and used to infect Ba/F3 cells growing in IL3. Cells were FACS-sorted for similar GFP levels. All cell types were cultivated at 37 °C, in an 8% CO2, 92% air atmosphere. For stimulation with Epo or GCSF, cells were washed, starved for 4 h in medium without FBS, with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Roche Applied Science), resuspended in a minimum volume of starvation medium for 20 min at 37 °C for equilibration before stimulation. Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were routinely prepared from 107 cells. Briefly, phosphate-buffered saline-washed cell pellets were resuspended in cold hypotonic lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9 (Sigma), 10 mm KCl (Merck), 1 mm EDTA (Acros Organics), 10% glycerol (Merck), 0.2% Nonidet P-40 solution (USB), and protease inhibitors: 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma), 1 mm sodium fluoride (Sigma) and allowed to swell on ice for 5 min. After centrifugation, nuclear pellets were resuspended in cold hypertonic lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 420 mm NaCl (Merck), 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40 solution, and the protease inhibitors, and vortexed for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were collected after a 10-min centrifugation at maximum speed, aliquoted, snap frozen, and stored at –80 °C. Immunoblotting—Protein samples (50 μg) were migrated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with TBST (Sigma) containing 5% bovine albumin (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature and subjected to immunoblotting. The STAT5 antibodies raised against the C terminus of the murine STAT5B (C17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), STAT5A, STAT5B (kind gifts of Dr. Warren Leonard, Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, NHLBI, National Institutes of Health), or the tyrosine 694-phosphorylated STAT5 (Cell Signaling Technology) were used at a dilution of 1:1000 in an overnight incubation at 4 °C. Anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was used at a dilution of 1:4000. Signals were revealed with the Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). For reprobing, blots were incubated in a stripping solution containing 62.5 mm Tris (Invitrogen) pH 6.8, 2% SDS (Sigma), 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol at 60 °C, washed extensively in water, blocked, and subjected to immunoblot. Immunoprecipitation—107 cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended for 20 min at 4 °C in cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 15% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40 solution, and protease inhibitors. After centrifugation, 2 μl of anti-STAT5A or anti-STAT5B antibody were added, and cell extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C. For precipitation, 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and extracts were incubated for 3 h. After washes with the lysis buffer, proteins were resuspended in Laemmli SDS-PAGE buffer and denatured 10 min at 100 °C. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—2 × 108 cells were starved and stimulated for 15 min. Then, chromatin immunoprecipitation of STAT5 binding sites was performed as described (61.Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: p13887-p13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) with protein A-Sepharose instead of Staph A cells and with the STAT5-C17 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), STAT5-N20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), STAT5A, STAT5B antibodies or a non-immune rabbit serum. 10 μl of chromatin supernatants were saved before ChIP as INPUT (no antibody, positive control). A MOCK sample (no chromatin, negative control) containing dilution buffer instead of chromatin was also included, and sample volumes were adjusted with the dilution buffer. At the end of the protocol, precipitated DNA samples were resuspended in 30 μl, while total INPUT samples (positive controls) were diluted 200 times.

For the cloning step, DNA fragments were blunt-ended with mung bean nuclease (Promega), and oriented double-stranded linkers were linked to their extremities. Then a PCR amplification was performed with Taq polymerase (Takara) using primers related to the linker, and amplified DNA fragments were cloned into the pCR-II-Topo vector (Topo TA cloning kit, Invitrogen). Positive colonies were sequenced and analyzed for the presence of STAT consensus sites. As a control for the frequency of STAT binding sites, chromatin was prepared from Ba/F3 cells, sonicated, and DNA was purified to be cloned as the ChIP samples, in the pCR-II-Topo vector. Dual Luciferase Assays—The luciferase reporter constructs were pL-HRE (62.Sotiropoulos A. Moutoussamy S. Renaudie F. Clauss M. Kayser C. Gouilleux F. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. Mol.

The TK promoter luciferase construct was kindly provided by Dr. Frederic Lemaigre, Hormone and Metabolic Research Unit, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels. 8 × 106 cells were starved for 4 h, transiently transfected by electroporation with 40 μg of pBclXL-TK, pLHRE, pCis-TK, N4N3-TK, N4-TK, or N3-TK, and 10 μg of pRLTK, seeded into 24-well plates at 1 × 106 cells/well, and stimulated with 1 unit/ml Epo for 2 h. For the pBclXL-TK plasmid, the part of the BclXL promoter containing the 2 consensus sites for STAT5 was obtained by PCR using the same primers as in ChIP, cloned into the pCR-II-Topo vector, and subcloned into the pGL2-TK promoter vector. For the pCis-TK, the part of the Cis promoter containing the two double STAT5 binding sites was obtained by PCR using the primers used for ChIP and cloned directly into the pGL2-TK promoter vector. For the N4N3-TK plasmid, the part of the β-casein promoter containing the two STAT5 binding sites was obtained by PCR with the following primers: 5′-gagctcccttaaccagcttctgaattgc-3′ and 5′-ctcgaggtcctatcagactctgtgaccg-3′, cloned into the pGL2-TK and named N4N3-TK.

https://openalex.org/W2161668779,"In-depth structure-function studies of voltage-gated Na+ channels and peptide toxins are continuously increasing our understanding of their interaction. In this study, an effective yeast expression system was used to study the role of 14 N- and C-terminal residues from the alpha-like toxin BmK M1 from the Chinese scorpion Buthus martensii Karsch. With the use of site-directed mutagenesis, all of these residues were individually substituted by one or more amino acids, resulting in a total of 19 mutants. These were then subjected to a bioassay on mice, an elaborate electrophysiological characterization on three cloned voltage-gated Na+ channels (Nav1.2, Nav1.5, and para), and a circular dichroism analysis. Our results reveal large mutant-dependent differences that emphasize important and specific roles for the studied residues. By mutating single amino acids, we were able to redirect the alpha-like characteristics of BmK M1 (active on both mammals and insects) to either much higher mammal specificity or, in a few cases, total insect specificity. This study therefore represents a thorough mapping and elucidation of three epitopes that underlie the molecular basis of the mammalian and insecticidal potency of the scorpion alpha-like toxin, BmK M1 on voltage-gated Na+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W2031840176,"Mitosin/CENP-F is a human nuclear matrix protein with multiple leucine zipper motifs. Its accumulation in S-G2 phases and transient kinetochore localization in mitosis suggest a multifunctional protein for cell proliferation. Moreover, its murine and avian orthologs are implicated in myocyte differentiation. Here we report its interaction with activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4), a ubiquitous basic leucine zipper transcription factor important for proliferation, differentiation, and stress response. The C-terminal portion of mitosin between residues 2488 and 3113 bound to ATF4 through two distinct domains, one of which was a leucine zipper motif. Mitosin mutants containing these domains were able to either supershift or disrupt the ATF4-DNA complex. On the other hand, ATF4, but not ATF1–3 or ATF6, interacted with mitosin through a region containing the basic leucine zipper motif. Moreover, overexpression of full-length mitosin repressed the transactivation activity of ATF4 in dual luciferase-based reporter assays, while knocking down mitosin expression manifested the opposite effects. These findings suggest mitosin to be a negative regulator of ATF4 in interphase through direct interaction."

This leaves a large gap in the black hole mass distribution. In her Perspective, [Fabbiano][1] investigates whether ultraluminous x-ray sources may be the missing intermediate-mass black holes. She concludes that the evidence is inconclusive; most ultraluminous x-ray sources can be explained without resorting to the intermediate-mass black hole hypothesis, but some of the brightest sources may indeed be intermediate-mass black holes.

https://openalex.org/W1973174755,"The major heat shock protein, chaperonin 60, has been established to have intercellular signaling activity in addition to its established protein-folding function. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of a small proportion of bacteria to encode two chaperonin 60 proteins. We have demonstrated that chaperonin 60.1 from this bacterium is a very active stimulator of human monocytes. To determine structure/function relationships of chaperonin 60.1 we have cloned and expressed the apical, equatorial, and intermediate domains of this protein. We have found that the signaling activity of M. tuberculosis chaperonin 60.1 resides in the equatorial domain. This activity of the recombinant equatorial domain was completely blocked by treating the protein with proteinase K, ruling out lipopolysaccharide contamination as the cause of the cell activation. Blockade of the activity of the equatorial domain by anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies reveals that this domain activates monocytes by binding to CD14. Looking at the oligomeric state of the active proteins, using native gel electrophoresis and protein cross-linking we found that recombinant M. tuberculosis chaperonin 60.1 fails to form the prototypic tetradecameric structure of chaperonin 60 proteins under the conditions tested and only forms dimers. It is therefore concluded that the monocyte-stimulating activity of M. tuberculosis Cpn60.1 resides in the monomeric subunit and within this subunit the biological activity is due to the equatorial domain.

In the past decade evidence has emerged that molecular chaperones are examples of moonlighting proteins with the capacity to act as intercellular signals of potential importance in controlling inflammation and immunity (3.Lewthwaite J.

Immunol. 2004; 16: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is now established that the Cpn60 proteins from a number of bacteria, and from the mitochondrion, can activate a range of mammalian cells, including myeloid cells and vascular endothelial cells (5.Wallin R.P. Lundqvist A. More S.H. von Bonin A. Kiessling R. Ljunggren H.G. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 6.Maguire M. Coates A.R.

Immunol. 2004; 16: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In consequence, it is possible to hypothesize that bacterial Cpn60 proteins may be directly acting virulence factors (3.Lewthwaite J. Skinner A. Henderson B. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 426-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The initial observation that Cpn60 proteins could activate myeloid cells (8.Friedland J.S. Shattock R. Remick D.G. Griffin G.E. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1993; 91: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) used the Cpn60.2 protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a protein more usually known as Hsp65 (9.Coates A.R. Shinnick T.M. Ellis R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 787Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has subsequently been discovered that this bacterium contains two genes coding for Cpn60 proteins and that these proteins have >70% sequence similarity (10.Kong T.H. Coates A.R. Butcher P.D. Hickman C.J. Shinnick T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2608-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have cloned both M. tuberculosis cpn60 genes and expressed and purified to homogeneity both recombinant Cpn60 proteins. Using these purified recombinant proteins we have shown that despite the substantial sequence identity there are major differences in their capacity to activate human monocytes (11.Lewthwaite J.C. Coates A.R. Tormay P. Singh M. Mascagni P. Poole S. Roberts M. Sharp L. Henderson B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7349-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus the M. tuberculosis Cpn60.1 protein is 10–100 times more potent at stimulating human monocyte cytokine synthesis than is the Cpn60.2 protein and indeed may be the most potent cell signaling chaperonin 60 molecule. In addition, the monocyte-stimulating capacity of the Cpn60.1 protein is blocked by monoclonal antibodies binding to CD14. Such antibodies have no inhibitory effect with Cpn60.2. Such inhibition is not due to the blocking of contaminating lipopolysaccharide (LPS), because both recombinant proteins have equal, and biologically insignificant, levels of contaminating LPS. Nothing is known about the relationship between the structure of Cpn60 proteins and their intercellular signaling actions. These proteins are believed to exist as oligomers, although a recent study (12.Qamra R. Srinivas V. Mande S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 605-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) suggests that the mycobacterial proteins form dimers in vitro as well as in vivo. It is not known if their intercellular signaling capacity is due to the oligomer or the individual monomer. It is also not known if the cell-cell signaling activity requires the intact monomer or if activity resides in a smaller structural domain. To examine this we have cloned and expressed the M. tuberculosis cpn60.1 gene and examined the oligomeric status of the recombinant protein. We have also cloned, expressed, and purified the individual domains that constitute Cpn60.1 and have tested these individual domains to identify if one or other exhibit the signaling activity of the parent protein. Source of Proteins—The recombinant M. tuberculosis Cpn60.1 protein was produced and purified as described previously (11.Lewthwaite J.C. Coates A.R. Tormay P. Singh M. Mascagni P. Poole S. Roberts M. Sharp L. Henderson B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7349-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To prepare the individual domains the complete coding sequences of the M. tuberculosis cpn60.1 gene was amplified by PCR using the Epicenter FailSafe PCR system (Cambio, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and cloned into the expression vector pBAD/Myc-HisB (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was designated pBTBc601. This construct expresses the full-length protein containing an additional 21 amino acids comprising the myc epitope and six histidine residues at the C terminus of the protein. The respective protein was designated HcCpn60.1. The individual protein domains were all based on this His-tagged version of the full-length protein. The equatorial domain as well as the equatorial domain in conjunction with the intermediate domain of Cpn60.1 was cloned by inverse PCR using the plasmid pBTBc601 as template. The resulting plasmids were called pBTBc601a and pBTBc601ab. The resulting proteins were designated HcCpn60.1a (equatorial domain of Cpn60.1) and HcCpn60.1ab (equatorial and intermediate domain of Cpn60.1). The apical domain of Cpn60.1 was obtained by amplifying the respective fragment by PCR and cloning the PCR product into the vector pBAD/Myc-HisB to produce the protein designated HcCpn60.1c. All recombinant proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain, Top10. HcCpn60.1, HcCpn60.1a, and HcCpn60.1ab were all formed as inclusion bodies. To produce folded proteins the inclusion bodies were re-suspended in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and this was quickly diluted by adding a 10-fold volume of PBS. Refolding was continued overnight at 4°C, and the protein was clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 × g and subsequent filtration of the cleared protein through a 0.25-μm filter. The recombinant protein was then bound to Probond nickel-chelating resin (Invitrogen), and bound protein was washed with 5 column volumes of a 2 mg/ml solution of polymyxin B (Sigma) in PBS to remove any contaminating LPS. Protein was eluted from the column by application of a 10–300 mm imidazole gradient in 10 column volumes, and fractions containing the recombinant chaperonin protein/domain of interest were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. Recombinant proteins were further purified by anion exchange chromatography using a Porous HQ column on a BioCad Sprint chromatography system (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). The purification of HcCpn60.1c was essentially the same as described except for the fact that no renaturation was required, and soluble protein was directly bound to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix. E. coli GroEL and GroES were purchased from Stressgen (Bioquote, York, UK). Analysis of Protein Purity—Protein purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To do this 50 pmol of each purified recombinant protein (1.1–2.9 μg, dependent on protein) was run on a 4–12% Bis-Tris gradient gel (Invitrogen), and the gel was subsequently stained with Simply Blue Safe Stain (Invitrogen). Molecular Model Building—The sequence of the M. tuberculosis Cpn60.1 protein was first aligned to the E. coli homologue, GroEL, for which crystal structures are available. Subsequently, the alignments were submitted to the ExPASy modeling server (swissmodel.expasy.org/) (13.Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). The resulting model was viewed using the Pdb viewer (www.expasy.org/spdbv/) (14.Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9399) Google Scholar). Oligomeric Structure Analysis—The oligomeric structure of the Cpn60 proteins was assessed by either cross-linking in conjunction with SDS-PAGE or by use of native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For the cross-linking experiments, 8 μm of each recombinant protein was incubated with 400 μm disuccinimidyl suberate (Perbio, Tattenhall, UK) for 30 min at room temperature in PBS. The reaction was then quenched by adding an equal volume of 2 × LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). After further incubation of the sample for 10 min the proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and visualized as described above. For the native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the proteins were incubated in 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol before loading onto a 6% Tris/glycine gel. Proteins were resolved for 1.5 h at 130 V using Tris/glycine running buffer (25 mm Tris base, 192 mm glycine). Proteolysis of Recombinant Cpn60 Proteins—To analyze whether the cytokine-stimulating activity was directly associated with the recombinant proteins, 5 μm of each protein was digested with 1.3 μg/ml proteinase K at 37°C for 16 h. Proteins were used at a final concentration of 100 nm in each assay. Polymyxin B was subsequently added to these preparation where indicated. Measurement of LPS Contamination in Recombinant Proteins—To ascertain the levels of LPS in the various recombinant proteins used to activate human monocytes, use was made of a commercially available Limulus amebocyte lysate assay, which was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Associates of Cape Cod, Liverpool, UK). Isolation of Human Monocytes—Human monocytes were prepared from buffy coat cells (obtained from the Blood Transfusion Centre, Colindale, London, UK) by density gradient centrifugation. Buffy coat cells were diluted 1:3 with PBS, and 30 ml of the diluted buffy coat cell suspension was carefully layered onto 15 ml of Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield Diagnostics Ltd., Dundee) and centrifuged at 400 × g for 30 min at room temperature. The mononuclear cell layer was collected, washed with PBS, and centrifuged at 400 × g for 15 min, the procedure being repeated. The final cell pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (all from Invitrogen). The cells were counted and diluted to 2 × 106 cells/ml, and 1-ml aliquots were dispensed into 24-well tissue culture plates. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C and then washed with PBS to remove non-adherent cells. Finally, cells were re-suspended in RPMI medium containing 2% fetal calf serum 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (all from Invitrogen). Induction and Measurement of Cytokines—Human monocytes were exposed to graded concentrations of the various recombinant Cpn60.1 proteins for 16 h, and the medium was removed and frozen to -70°C until analysis. The concentration of cytokines, namely IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α, in the medium supporting the cells was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using paired antibodies to these cytokines from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK). In most experiments the activating protein was incubated with cells in the presence of 20 μg/ml polymyxin B to ensure that activity recorded was not due to LPS. To ascertain the role of CD14 in cell activation, neutralizing antibodies to CD14 (R&D Systems) or the appropriate isotype antibody control were added to the activated cells at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Results are means of three independent stimulation experiments using cells from the same buffy coat residue. In different experiments different buffy coat residue was used, resulting in some variation of the results. Physicochemical Characteristics of Recombinant Cpn60 Variants—All the recombinant proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with a sensitive commercially available Coomassie Blue stain. All proteins were of the expected protein mass. Even at high protein loadings there were no visible contaminating bands (Fig. 1). The predicted structure of the intact mycobacterial Cpn60.1 monomer and its constituent domains are shown in Fig. 2.Fig. 2Structural model of the M. tuberculosis heat shock protein Cpn60.1. The structural model was obtained by sequence alignment of M. tuberculosis Cpn60.1 with GroEL using the ExPASy modeling server.

B, the sequence of Cpn60.1 is provided with the domain structure outlined underneath. Arrows and boxes indicate β-sheets and helical regions, respectively. The domains are again indicated by different shading of the arrows and boxes (crosshatch, equatorial domain; 45° hatch, intermediate domain; vertical hatch, apical domain).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LPS Contamination of Recombinant Proteins—Using polymyxin B to wash the recombinant proteins on the nickel affinity columns lowered the concentrations of LPS in the Cpn60 protein preparations to <2 pg/μg protein. Oligomeric Structure of the Recombinant Proteins—Chaperonin 60 proteins are known to form higher oligomeric quaternary structures (1.Saibil H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To determine the oligomeric structure of the M. tuberculosis Cpn60.1 protein, as well as of the subdomains, proteins were first run on a native polyacrylamide gel. The result is shown in Fig. 3A. GroEL and GroES from E. coli were included as controls. As expected GroEL forms a large complex, whereas GroES forms the characteristic heptamer. In contrast, neither the full-length protein nor the protein domains form such higher molecular mass complexes. In relation to GroEL and GroES, the M. tuberculosis Cpn60 full-length proteins, the apical domain, and the apical plus intermediate domain seem to be in the dimeric form (∼110, 60, and 80 kDa, respectively). The apical domain seems to only form monomers (∼23 kDa). Because native gel electrophoresis does not allow for an accurate mass prediction, proteins were incubated with the protein cross-linking reagent, disuccinimidyl suberate, to determine if protein subunits were forming complexes in solution (Fig. 3B). The E. coli GroEL clearly shows the presence of higher oligomers. However, it is evident that the M. tuberculosis Cpn60.1 proteins, under the conditions tested, do not form higher oligomeric structures. The full-length His-tagged protein, the equatorial domain, and the equatorial plus intermediate domain show faint bands at a molecular mass that approximates a dimeric structure. However, no higher oligomeric structures were evident. The apical domain was wholly monomeric. Effect of Introducing the His Tag on the Cytokine-inducing Activity of Cpn60 Proteins—In all previous studies we have used recombinant M. tuberculosis Cpn60.1 proteins lacking a His tag and purified by conventional chromatographic techniques. In this study the full-length Cpn60.1 protein was expressed from a plasmid construct that generated a fusion protein containing 21 extra amino acids at the C terminus, including 6-terminal histidine residues. Comparison of these two forms of the recombinant protein revealed that the His-tagged protein was an active cytokine-inducing protein, although it was somewhat less active than the non-fusion version of the protein (Fig. 4). Comparison of the Cytokine-inducing Activity of the Recombinant Cpn60.1 Domains—Human monocytes were incubated with a range of molar concentrations of the parent Cpn60.1 fusion protein or with the various recombinant Cpn60.1 domains and the synthesis of cytokines analyzed. The parent protein (HcCpn60.1), the equatorial domain (HcCpn60.1a), and the equatorial plus intermediate domain (HcCpn60.1ab) all demonstrated the capacity to induce pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis. In most experiments the equatorial domain and the equatorial domain linked to the intermediate domain showed higher potency and efficacy than the full-length parent protein. This was particularly marked with the induction of IL-1β synthesis. In contrast, in none of the many separate samples of human monocytes tested did the apical domain demonstrate any capacity to induce cytokine synthesis (Fig. 5) Effect of Proteinase K Treatment on Cytokine-stimulating Activity of Cpn60.1 Variants—We have used proteolysis in previous studies as a control for LPS contamination and to check on the possible activity of internal peptides (e.g. Ref. 11.Lewthwaite J.C. Coates A.R. Tormay P. Singh M. Mascagni P. Poole S. Roberts M. Sharp L. Henderson B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7349-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The various recombinant Cpn60.1 proteins/domains were digested with proteinase K prior to adding to cells, and the complete proteolysis of each recombinant protein is shown in Fig. 6A. Exposure to this proteinase obliterated the cytokine inducing activity of the full-length protein and the equatorial and equatorial plus intermediate domain proteins (Fig. 6B). This effect was seen in the presence as well as the absence of polymyxin B. As expected, proteinase K treatment had no effect on the cytokine-stimulating activity of LPS (data not shown). CD14 Dependence of Recombinant Cpn60 Proteins—The full-length recombinant Cpn60.1 and the protein domain were incubated with human monocytes that had been pre-treated with an anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody that blocks the binding of LPS to CD14. This antibody blocked the activity of the full-length protein and of the recombinant domains showing that they all require to interact with CD14 to induce monocyte cytokine synthesis (Fig. 7). It has been established for some years that, despite the significant sequence conservation, molecular chaperones such as Cpn60 from bacterial and eukaryotic pathogens are potent immunogens and modulators of immunity (15.Cohen I.R. Young D.B. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 105-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 16.van Eden W. van der Zee R. Paul A.G. Prakken B.J. Wendling U. Anderton S.M. Wauben M.H.

One explanation for the ability of these proteins to activate innate and acquired immunity is that they have the capacity to act as intercellular signals for eukaryotic cells (4.Coates A.R.

The past decade has seen a growing number of reports of the ability of molecular chaperones, such as Cpn60, to activate monocytes, macrophages, and vascular endothelial cells (4.Coates A.R. Henderson B. Mascagni P. Biotechnol. Genet. Eng. Rev. 1999; 16: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 5.Wallin R.P. Lundqvist A. More S.H. von Bonin A. Kiessling R. Ljunggren H.G.

Birkhauser Verlag, Basel2003: 175-192Crossref Google Scholar). In this respect, molecular chaperones could be thought of as pathogen-associated molecular patterns; that is, as highly conserved components of pathogens for which the host has evolved recognition systems in the form of pathogen recognition receptors (18.Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (5994) Google Scholar). An obvious difference between pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as LPS, peptidoglycan, and lipoarabinomannan and the molecular chaperones is the fact that the latter are also produced by the host and there is substantial evidence that host molecular chaperones, such as human Cpn60 (Hsp60), can stimulate immune cells (19.Kol A.

The authors' interest in the signaling actions of bacterial chaperonins arose from the discovery that the potent bone-resorbing mediator exported by the oral bacterium, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was the chaperonin 60 protein of this organism. We then showed that the E. coli Cpn60 protein, GroEL, was a potent stimulator of bone resorption. However, neither the M. tuberculosis nor the M. leprae Cpn60.2 protein was able to induce bone resorption (22.Kirby A.C. Meghji S. Nair S.P. White P. Reddi K. Nishihara T. Nakashima K. Willis A.C. Sim R. Wilson M. Henderson B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1185-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Further investigation of the mycobacterial chaperonins revealed that neither of the two Cpn60 proteins produced by M. tuberculosis could stimulate bone resorption. In fact, the major bone-resorbing moiety of this bacterium turned out to be the co-chaperone, Cpn10 (23.Meghji S. White P.A. Nair S.P. Reddi K. Heron K. Henderson B. Zaliani A. Fossati G. Mascagni P. Hunt J.F. Roberts M.M. Coates A.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1241-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This was the first evidence that the chaperonin 60 protein was not a unitary molecule and that different Cpn60 proteins from different sources could express different patterns of biological activity. To investigate the M. tuberculosis Cpn60 proteins in more detail we cloned and expressed both genes as non-fusion proteins and purified them to homogeneity. Despite >70% sequence similarity between both proteins, it was found that Cpn60.1 was significantly more potent and efficacious as an inducer of monocyte cytokine synthesis than Cpn60.2. Indeed, this mycobacterial protein appears to be the most biologically active form of Cpn60 (6.Maguire M. Coates A.R. Henderson B. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2002; 7: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11.Lewthwaite J.C. Coates A.R. Tormay P. Singh M. Mascagni P. Poole S. Roberts M. Sharp L. Henderson B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7349-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A major difference between these two proteins was that Cpn60.1 was blocked by neutralizing antibodies to CD14 implying that this protein activates monocytes via the CD14·TLR4 receptor complex. In contrast, Cpn60.2 was unaffected by antibodies to CD14 (11.Lewthwaite J.C. Coates A.R. Tormay P. Singh M. Mascagni P. Poole S. Roberts M. Sharp L. Henderson B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7349-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This suggests that these two proteins bind to different receptors or to different parts of the CD14·TLR4·MD2 receptor complex. This has been confirmed by studies of competitive binding of Cpn60 proteins from different species to macrophages (24.Habich C. Kempe K. van der Zee R. Burkart V. Kolb H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). There is much that is not understood about the interaction of Cpn60 proteins and immune cells. To investigate the structure-function relationships of the M. tuberculosis Cpn60.1 protein we have developed a structural model based on the crystal structure of GroEL. This has allowed the development of a strategy for cloning and expressing the individual domains of this protein. Examination of the structure of GroEL reveals the presence of three domains in the monomer: (i) the equatorial domain, which makes contact with the corresponding equatorial domain in the oligomeric structure; (ii) the intermediate domain; and (iii) the apical domain (Fig. 1). To simplify the purification of the individual domains it was decided to produce all recombinant domains as C-terminal myc-6-His-tagged fusion proteins, and the parent protein was also recloned into the same vector. This allowed the production of: (i) the intact parent protein; (ii) the equatorial domain; (iii) the equatorial domain linked to the intermediate domain; and (iv) the apical domain. Some of these recombinant domain proteins formed inclusion bodies, but it proved possible to obtain them in soluble form. The first finding from this study was that addition of the myc epitope and 6-His residues to the C terminus of Cpn60.1 still allowed the generation of proteins with biological activity. Comparison of the fusion protein form of Cpn60.1 with the recombinant non-fusion protein form revealed that there had been some loss of potency. This may suggest that the C terminus of Cpn60.1 is also involved in the cell-cell signaling activity of this protein. With an active parent molecule it was now possible to determine which of the domains of Cpn60.1 contributed to the activity of this protein. This revealed that the equatorial domain and the equatorial domain plus the intermediate domain retained biological activity with the former being as active, or even more active, on a molar basis, as the parent molecule. The recombinant apical domain was inactive under the conditions tested. We have previously reported that the apical domain contained a peptide, residues 195–219, which had cytokine-stimulating activity, and it was surprising that this domain had no biological activity. It should be noted that this peptide was used at much higher molar concentration in the previous study (11.Lewthwaite J.C. Coates A.R. Tormay P. Singh M. Mascagni P. Poole S. Roberts M. Sharp L. Henderson B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7349-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) compared with the apical domain in this study. Moreover, the model we present here indicates that this particular sequence forms part of a β-sheet with a large loop in contrast to the helical structure prediction for the peptide. It also cannot be ruled out that the addition of the C-terminal His tag has a negative effect on any residual cytokine stimulating activity of the apical domain. Nevertheless, it is clear that the equatorial domain retains all the cytokine stimulating activity of the full-length protein. Adding the intermediate domain to this construct does not alter the activity. We therefore conclude that the sequence 195–219 is not responsible for the activity of the full-length protein and that the primary cytokine stimulating activity is associated with the equatorial domain. Recent studies with the human mitochondrial Cpn60 protein also implicate the equatorial domain as the primary domain for interaction with and activation of cells of myeloid origin. We have shown that deletion mutants from the C-terminal end of the human mitochondrial Cpn60 protein resulted in the loss of ability to induce bone resorption (25.Meghji S. Lillicrap M. Maguire M. Tabona P. Gaston J.S. Poole S. Henderson B. Bone. 2003; 33: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Another study has identified that an epitope important for receptor binding on macrophages mapped to the C terminus of the equatorial domain (26.Habich C. Kempe K. Burkart V. Van Der Zee R. Lillicrap M. Gaston H. Kolb H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 568: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The current paradigm is that the folding activity of chaperonin 60 proteins requires them to form higher oligomeric structures. GroEL, the prototypic member of this family, forms a tetradecamer consisting of two seven membered rings (1.Saibil H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2.Thirumalai D. Lorimer G.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 245-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). It is not known if the cell-cell signaling activity of these proteins depends on the formation of such oligomeric structures. Studies with GroEL, in which trypsinization failed to block activity (27.Tabona P. Reddi K. Khan S. Nair S.P. Crean S.J. Meghji S. Wilson M. Preuss M. Miller A.D. Poole S. Carne S. Henderson B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1414-1421PubMed Google Scholar), and the finding that boiling the mycobacterial Cpn60 proteins did not inhibit activity (11.Lewthwaite J.C. Coates A.R. Tormay P. Singh M. Mascagni P. Poole S. Roberts M. Sharp L. Henderson B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7349-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) suggest that the cell-cell signaling activity of Cpn60 proteins resides in the monomer and in submonomeric species. Here we show that even at high concentration neither the full-length M. tuberculosis Cpn60.1 protein nor its active subdomains form larger oligomers but exist as dimers. Thus under the conditions used for stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells the proteins are either in the dimeric or monomeric form. This is further evidence that the cell signaling activity is not associated with protein oligomerization. Indeed, it has recently been reported that the mycobacterial proteins reside as dimers in the cell and that the folding properties of M. tuberculosis Cpn60.1 do not require this protein forming a higher oligomeric structure (12.Qamra R. Srinivas V. Mande S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 605-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). There is still debate in the literature about the meaning of the cell-cell signaling activity of Cpn60 proteins, and one recent paper has attributed the bioactivity of human Cpn60 to contaminating LPS (28.Gao B. Tsan M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22523-22529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In another study the bioactivity of Hsp70 was also attributed to LPS contamination (29.Bausinger H. Lipsker D. Ziylan U. Manie S. Briand J.P. Cazenave J.P. Muller S. Haeuw J.F. Ravanat C. de la Salle H. Hanau D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3708-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We have developed methods for removing both LPS and contaminating proteins from recombinant chaperonin 60 proteins (27.Tabona P. Reddi K. Khan S. Nair S.P. Crean S.J. Meghji S. Wilson M. Preuss M. Miller A.D. Poole S. Carne S. Henderson B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1414-1421PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Maguire M. Coates A.R. Henderson B. J. Chromatogr. B. 2003; 786: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and all samples of proteins produced for this study have measurable, but biologically negligible (<2 pg of LPS per microgram of protein), concentrations of LPS. In a previous study we showed that the bioactivity of both recombinant mycobacterial Cpn60 proteins was blocked by exposure to proteinase K, which had no effect on LPS. In this study we have shown that the biological activity of the parent protein and the active recombinant proteins containing the equatorial domain are completely blocked by treatment with proteinase K. Because the LPS contamination of the proteins is below the level where LPS has an effect they could also be tested in the absence of polymyxin B, a small polypeptide used to neutralize the effect of LPS. Even in the absence of polymyxin B, proteolysis completely abrogates the biological activity. It has previously been argued that polymyxin B might not be able to neutralize LPS bound to heat shock proteins and that boiling or proteolysis releases the contaminating LPS, which in return can be neutralized by polymyxin B (5.Wallin R.P. Lundqvist A. More S.H. von Bonin A. Kiessling R. Ljunggren H.G. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The fact that proteolysis in the presence as well as in the absence of polymyxin B completely blocks cell-cell signaling activity confirms that the activity of these proteins is not due to contaminating LPS or other nonproteinaceous contaminants. The activity of the non-fusion protein version of Cpn60.1 was completely inhibited by neutralizing antibodies to CD14 (11.Lewthwaite J.C. Coates A.R. Tormay P. Singh M. Mascagni P. Poole S. Roberts M. Sharp L. Henderson B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7349-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The activity of the intact fusion protein version of Cpn60.1, the equatorial domain, and the equatorial and intermediate domain versions was also blocked by such antibodies implying that cell activation is CD14-dependent. The experimental data presented in this report allow the following conclusions to be reached. The biological activity of the M. tuberculosis Cpn60 proteins resides in the individual monomers. This does not rule out the possibility that oligomerization enhances activity. The equatorial domain contains the binding site for human myeloid cells. The recombinant Cpn60.1 equatorial domain is therefore an excellent starting point for defining the exact residues and structure conferring the potent cell signaling activity of this molecular chaperone.

https://openalex.org/W1973029265,"It is well established that Hox genes are key players in specifying positional identity along the anterior-posterior axis and are targets of diverse transcription factors implicated in axial patterning. Members of the CDX family (CDX1, -2, and -4) are among such effectors of Hox expression as pertains to vertebral patterning in the mouse. Cdx members are themselves targets of signaling molecules that are also implicated in axial patterning, including retinoic acid (RA) and certain members of Wnt and fibroblast growth factor families. In this regard, we have previously shown that, in the mouse, Cdx1 is directly regulated by RA at the late primitive streak stage (embryonic day (E) 7.5) through a RA response element in the proximal Cdx1 promoter. At E8.5, Cdx1 expression remains essentially limited to the posterior embryo. RA, however, is excluded from the caudal embryo at this later stage, but is found in a more anterior domain encompassing the prospective trunk region. These observations suggest the existence of a repressor mechanism that prevents expression of Cdx1 in these anterior domains of retinoid signaling at E8.5. In the present study, we present evidence suggesting that chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF) members antagonize RA-induced Cdx1 expression by competing with retinoid X receptor-retinoic acid receptor heterodimers for binding to the Cdx1 RA response element. Consistent with this, in situ hybridization analysis revealed that COUP-TFs are highly expressed in the anterior embryo in domains where Cdx1 transcripts are excluded. Together with other data, these findings suggest a model by which COUP-TF expression is induced by RA in the trunk region as a negative feedback mechanism to restrict Cdx1 expression to the caudal embryo.

The Cdx family (Cdx1, -2, and -4) encode homeodomain transcription factors. A role for CDX1 and CDX2 in vertebral patterning has been clearly demonstrated by gene targeting studies. Cdx1–/– (1.Subramanian V. Meyer B.I. Gruss P. Cell. 1995; 83: 641-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and Cdx2+/– (2.Chawengsaksophak K. James R. Hammond V.E. Kontgen F. Beck F. Nature. 1997; 386: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) mice exhibit homeotic transformations of the cervical and anterior thoracic vertebra. Cdx1–/–/Cdx2+/– compound mutant offspring exhibit a higher degree of expressivity of these transformations suggesting that both gene products functionally overlap (3.van Den A.E. Forlani S. Chawengsaksophak K. de Graaff W. Beck F. Meyer B.I. Deschamps J. Development. 2002; 129: 2181-2193PubMed Google Scholar).CDX1 and CDX2 appear to impact on vertebral patterning at least in part through regulation of Hox gene expression (1.Subramanian V. Meyer B.I.

Development. 2002; 129: 2181-2193PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the vertebral defects seen in Cdx mutant offspring are reminiscent of those observed in certain Hox mutants. Moreover these vertebral homeoses are typically associated with a posterior shift in the anterior expression domains of several Hox genes. A number of Hox promoters also contain consensus CDX binding motifs (1.Subramanian V. Meyer B.I. Gruss P.

Reijnen M.J. Korving J. Deschamps J. Development. 1998; 125: 4349-4358PubMed Google Scholar). Finally Cdx1 transcripts are first detected at embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) 1The abbreviations used are: E, embryonic day; RA, retinoic acid; COUP-TF, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor; RARE, RA response element; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: E, embryonic day; RA, retinoic acid; COUP-TF, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor; RARE, RA response element; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein. in the mesodermal and ectodermal cells of the primitive streak (5.Meyer B.I. Gruss P. Development. 1993; 117: 191-203PubMed Google Scholar), and this expression is maintained at tail bud stages through E9.5. This pattern of expression is consistent with the onset of Hox gene expression in the caudal embryo.We have previously demonstrated that, in the mouse, Cdx1 is regulated at E7.5 by retinoic acid (RA) present in the late primitive streak region through an atypical RA response element (RARE) (6.Houle M. Prinos P. Iulianella A. Bouchard N. Lohnes D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6579-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7.Houle M. Sylvestre J.R. Lohnes D. Development. 2003; 130: 6555-6567Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). By E8.5, Cdx1 expression is maintained in the caudal embryo through mechanisms involving both Wnt signaling (8.Prinos P. Joseph S. Oh K. Meyer B.I. Gruss P. Lohnes D. Dev. Biol. 2001; 239: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and autoregulation (9.Beland M. Pilon N. Houle M. Oh K. Sylvestre J.R. Prinos P. Lohnes D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5028-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). RA, however, is absent in this region at this stage but is found in a more anterior domain in the prospective trunk (10.Rossant J. Zirngibl R. Cado D. Shago M. Giguere V. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Despite this, Cdx1 transcripts are not observed (with the exception of later expression in the dermamyotome and limb buds) in the embryonic trunk. This observation suggests the existence of a mechanism that serves to attenuate Cdx1 expression in these more anterior, RA-positive tissues.Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII) are orphan nuclear receptors (11.Wang L.H.

Biol. 1992; 12: 4666-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This antagonism has been suggested to occur by four different mechanisms: (i) competition for RXR heterodimerization; (ii) trans-repression via interaction with the ligand binding domain of RAR, thyroid hormone receptor, or RXR; (iii) active repression through interaction with co-repressors; and (iv) competition for DNA binding at response elements (19.Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar).Based on their ability to interfere with retinoid signaling, we investigated whether COUP-TFs could act as negative regulators of Cdx1 expression. Consistent with such a relationship, in situ hybridization analysis in mouse embryos revealed that Cdx1 expression was restricted to regions where COUP-TF transcripts were excluded. Moreover we found that COUP-TFs could attenuate RA-induced transcriptional activation of the Cdx1 promoter in tissue culture and that this effect was dependent upon the DNA binding domain of COUP-TFI. We also demonstrated that COUP-TFs can bind the Cdx1 RARE and repress transactivation from this element from a heterologous promoter. Finally we found that increased expression of COUP-TF1 correlated with loss of expression of endogenous Cdx1. Together these results led us to propose a model in which RA induces expression of COUP-TFs in the trunk region of the E8.5 mouse embryo that serves to attenuate Cdx1 expression in the embryonic trunk, thus restricting Cdx1 expression to the caudal embryo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs—The luciferase reporter vector containing 2 kb of the Cdx1 promoter or a heterologous (TK109 luciferase) basal promoter harboring the Cdx1 RARE have been described previously (6.Houle M. Prinos P. Iulianella A. Bouchard N. Lohnes D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6579-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Murine COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII cDNAs, generously provided by Dr. Ming-Jer Tsai, were subcloned into a modified version of pSG5 (Stratagene) harboring an extended polylinker. The COUP-TFIΔDBD mutant was generated by PCR-mediated deletion of nucleotides 565–621 (NCBI accession number X74134), which encode the first zinc finger of the COUP-TFI DNA binding domain.Cell Culture and Transfection Analysis—F9 embryocarcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For transient transfection assays, cells were passed into gelatinized 6-well plates and transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Each transfection consisted of 1 μg of luciferase reporter construct, 0.05–0.5 μg of relevant expression vector(s), and empty expression vector (where required) such that all transfections contained a total of 1.5 μg of DNA. The following day media were replenished, cells were treated with 1 μm RA or vehicle (Me2SO; final concentration, 0.01% (v/v)), and culture continued for another 24 h. Monolayers were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were disrupted by addition of lysis buffer (0.1 m Tris, pH 8, 1% Igepal, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and lysates were assessed for luciferase activity as described previously (6.Houle M.

Cells were passaged into 100-mm tissue culture plates, transfected with 25 μg of DNA per plate, and treated with RA or vehicle as for F9 cells. In some experiments, 5 μg of pEGFP-F (Clontech) was co-transfected with 25 μg of COUP-TF1 expression vector, and GFP-positive cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting 24 h post-treatment. Cells were harvested, snap frozen, and stored at–80 °C prior to RNA extraction. COS7 cells were maintained and transfected as for P19 cells and used for the isolation of nuclear proteins for electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies as described previously (6.Houle M.

Prinos P. Iulianella A. Bouchard N. Lohnes D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6579-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In some experiments, 1–2 μg of either anti-COUP-TFI (sc-6577X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-COUP-TFII (sc-6576, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) antibodies were included in the binding reaction for super-shift analysis.In Situ Hybridization—Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed on E8.0–E8.75 embryos as described previously (20.Wilkinson D.G. In Situ Hybridization. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1992: 75-82Google Scholar) using riboprobes generated from Cdx1 or COUP-TF cDNAs.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from P19 cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, resolved by electrophoresis through a formaldehyde gel, and transferred to a Magna membrane (Osmonics Inc.). Hybridizations were performed overnight at 65 °C in 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 30 mg/ml yeast RNA, 200 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and ∼106 cpm/ml probe that was prepared by random priming relevant cDNAs. Blots were washed twice at 65 °C in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and signal was revealed by autoradiography.RESULTSCOUP-TFI and Cdx1 Exhibit Complementary Patterns of Expression—To begin to establish whether COUP-TFs could function as negative regulators of Cdx1 expression, we first examined the expression patterns of each gene. Whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis revealed COUP-TFI expression at E8.0 in the anterior prospective nervous system (Fig. 1A) with expression extending caudally as elongation proceeded at E8.75 (Fig. 1C). COUP-TF1 transcripts, however, were never detected in the tail bud region. Similar patterns of expression were also observed for COUP-TFII (data not shown). By contrast, expression of Cdx1 was observed exclusively in the prospective neural tube to the level of the caudal hindbrain and in a broad region throughout the posterior embryo at E8.5 with expression restricted to the neural tube and tail bud regions at E8.75 (Fig. 1, B and D). Thus, Cdx1 expression was restricted to regions where transcripts encoding COUP-TFs were excluded in agreement with a possible role for COUP-TFs as negative regulators of Cdx1.COUP-TFs Interfere with Induction of Cdx1 by RA and Bind the Cdx1 RARE—To assess whether COUP-TF members could antagonize the induction of Cdx1 by RA, we transfected F9 cells with a reporter gene (pXP2, Ref. 6.Houle M. Prinos P. Iulianella A. Bouchard N. Lohnes D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6579-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) under the control of Cdx1 promoter sequences, including the RARE, and cultured the cells in the absence or presence of RA (1 μm). As shown in Fig. 2A, RA treatment resulted in an induction of reporter activity consistent with previous findings (6.Houle M. Prinos P. Iulianella A. Bouchard N. Lohnes D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6579-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Moreover, co-transfection of the reporter with increasing amounts of an expression vector encoding COUP-TFI or COUP-TFII resulted in a complete attenuation of this induction.Fig. 2COUP-TFs antagonize induction of Cdx1 by RA and bind the Cdx1 RARE. A, F9 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the 2-kb Cdx1 promoter with or without 50–500 ng of COUP-TFI or -II expression vector and cultured in the absence or presence of RA (1 μm) for 24 h. Luciferase values are the mean ± S.D. and are expressed as -fold induction by RA relative to the reporter vector alone. B, nuclear extracts from COS7 cells, transfected with the indicated expression vectors, were incubated with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the Cdx1 RARE, and complexes were resolved by PAGE. Lane 1, mock-transfected cells; lanes 2–5, RAR and RXR; lanes 6–10, COUP-TFI; lanes 11–15, COUP-TFII. Specific complexes (lanes 2, 6, and 11) were not affected by inclusion of an SP-1 nonspecific competitor (lanes 5, 10, and 15) or a mutated Cdx1 RARE (lanes 4, 9, and 14) but were competed for by wild type Cdx1 RARE (lanes 3, 8, and 13). Supershifts were observed after incubation with anti-COUP-TFI (lane 7) and anti-COUP-TFII (lane 12). C, F9 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter vector containing the Cdx1 RARE motif upstream of the thymidine kinase minimal promoter (TK109) alone or with 500 ng of COUP-TFI or -II expression vector. Cultures were treated with vehicle or RA, and luciferase activity was assessed 24 h post-treatment.

We therefore investigated whether COUP-TFs could bind to the Cdx1 RARE. To this end, nuclear extracts from COS7 cells transfected with COUP-TFI or -II were incubated with a radiolabeled probe consisting of the Cdx1 RARE sequence. Nuclear extracts from cells transfected with RARα plus RXRα were used as a positive control since RAR-RXR heterodimers have been shown to bind efficiently to this element (6.Houle M. Prinos P. Iulianella A. Bouchard N. Lohnes D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6579-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The results, illustrated in Fig. 2B, indicate that both COUP-TFI and -II formed a complex with the Cdx1 RARE (lanes 6 and 11) that was comparable to or greater than the complex formed using RXR-RAR (lane 2). The presence of COUP-TFI or -II in each complex was confirmed by supershift assays using the appropriate antibodies (lanes 7 and 12). Specificity of binding was further established by efficient competition with an unlabeled RARE probe (lanes 8 and 13), whereas a mutated Cdx1 RARE (lanes 9 and 14) or an SP-1 binding motif (lanes 10 and 15) were unable to compete.The above results demonstrated that COUP-TFs can bind directly to the Cdx1 RARE. To determine whether this interaction could inhibit Cdx1 expression, we assessed the effect of COUP-TFs on RA induction from a heterologous promoter containing the Cdx1 RARE. As shown in Fig. 2C, both COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII repressed RA-induced transcriptional activity from this reporter.DNA Binding by COUP-TFI Is Necessary to Repress Cdx1— Mutation of the RARE abrogates induction of Cdx1 by RA (6.Houle M. Prinos P. Iulianella A. Bouchard N. Lohnes D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6579-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, a similar strategy would not be informative as a means to investigate the role of COUP-TFs as these factors attenuate RA induction through this element but do not interfere with basal expression. As an alternative approach, we assessed the ability of a COUP-TFI mutant lacking the first zinc finger motif of its DNA binding domain (COUP-TFIΔDBD) to impact on Cdx1 expression.Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that, in contrast to COUP-TFI, COUP-TFIΔDBD could not effectively bind the Cdx1 RARE (Fig. 3A, lane 6). This finding is consistent with prior work demonstrating the importance of this zinc finger motif for DNA binding by other members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily (21.Green S. Kumar V. Theulaz I. Wahli W. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3037-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We next tested the ability of the COUP-TFIΔDBD mutant to repress RA-induced activation of the Cdx1 promoter in F9 cells. As illustrated in Fig. 3B, the COUP-TFIΔDBD mutant failed to inhibit RA-mediated activation of the Cdx1 promoter. Similar findings were also observed with the RARE directing expression from a heterologous promoter (TK109, Ref. 6.Houle M. Prinos P. Iulianella A. Bouchard N. Lohnes D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6579-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar; data not shown).Fig. 3COUP-TFI inhibition of Cdx1 is dependent on DNA binding. A, nuclear extracts from COS7 cells were incubated with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the Cdx1 RARE. Lanes 1–4, transfected with COUP-TFI; lanes 5–8, transfected with COUP-TFIΔDBD. Note that, unlike COUP-TFI (lane 1), COUP-TFIΔDBD was unable to form a specific complex with the RARE (lane 5). B, F9 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the 2-kb Cdx1 promoter in the absence or presence of RA (1 μm). 50, 100, or 500 ng (amounts indicated by relative line or triangle thickness) of COUP-TFI and/or COUP-TFIΔDBD expression vector(s) were used in co-transfection experiments. Results are the mean ± S.D. of independent triplicate transfections and are expressed as -fold induction by RA relative to the reporter vector alone. DMSO, Me2SO; Ab, antibody; mut, mutant; WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The relative mobility of the complex formed between COUP-TF and the Cdx1 RARE, compared with the RXR-RAR-RARE complex, suggested that COUP-TFs bind this motif as homodimers, although this has not been formally assessed. However, consistent with this possibility, we found that co-expression COUP-TFIΔDBD was able to relieve the transcriptional repression mediated by its wild type counterpart in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). This suggests that the interaction of COUP-TFI with COUP-TFIΔDBD prevented DNA binding and inhibition of RA-induced transactivation by the former and further supports the contention that COUP-TFs inhibit RA induction of Cdx1 by direct association with the RARE.RA Induction of COUP-TFI Leads to Down-regulation of Cdx1 Expression—In addition to negatively regulating the expression of certain RA target genes, COUP-TFIs have themselves been demonstrated to be RA targets (12.Jonk L.J. de Jonge M.E. Pals C.E. Wissink S. Vervaart J.M. Schoorlemmer J. Kruijer W. Mech. Dev. 1994; 47: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 22.Brubaker K. McMillan M. Neuman T. Nornes H.O. Brain Res. Dev.

Biol. 1994; 161: 604-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This finding has led to the hypothesis that COUP-TFs are involved in a negative feedback mechanism that serves to repress the expression of RA target genes (23.Jonk L.J. de Jonge M.E. Vervaart J.M. Wissink S. Kruijer W. Dev. Biol. 1994; 161: 604-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To examine this relationship, P19 cells were cultured in the continual presence 1 μm RA, and expression of COUP-TFI and Cdx1 were assessed from 1 to 7 days. Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4A) revealed that COUP-TFI was first detected 2 days after RA treatment with transcripts accumulating to a maximum by day 5. By contrast, Cdx1 transcripts were already detectable 24 h post-treatment with a subsequent decline in expression from day 2 onward. These complementary kinetics of expression are consistent with retinoid induction of COUP-TFI leading to down-regulation of Cdx1 despite the continued presence of RA.Fig. 4Relationship between RA, COUP-TFI, and Cdx1 expression. A, P19 cells were cultured in the continuous presence of RA (1 μm) for the indicated number of days; 0 corresponds to Me2SO treatment. RNA was extracted, and expression of Cdx1 and COUP-TF1 was assessed by Northern blot analysis. β-Actin was used as a loading control. B, P19 cells were transfected with a GFP expression vector and empty (p513) (lanes 1 and 2), COUP-TFI (lane 3), or COUP-TFIΔDBD (lane 4) expression vectors. Cultures were treated with vehicle (lane 1) or 1 μm RA (lanes 2–4) for 24 h, GFP-positive cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and Cdx1 expression was assessed by Northern blot analysis using β-actin as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further investigate the relationship between COUP-TF and Cdx1, we transfected P19 cells with an expression vector encoding either COUP-TFI or COUP-TFIΔDBD together with a GFP expression plasmid. Cdx1 is induced by RA in P19 cells in a manner indistinguishable from F9 cells (see Fig. 4A). 2M. Béland and D. Lohnes, unpublished data. P19 cells were used for these experiments as a higher transfection efficiency was necessary to obtain sufficient cells for Northern blot analysis. Cultures were then treated for 24 h with RA or vehicle, and GFP-positive cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Nuclear proteins were extracted, and equivalent expression of each COUP-TF was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Northern blot analysis revealed that COUP-TFI repressed induction of Cdx1 by RA, whereas COUP-TFIΔDBD had no detectable effect (Fig. 4B).Together the results presented in this study are in agreement with a model whereby RA-mediated accumulation of COUP-TFI inhibits the acute RA induction of Cdx1. Such a model may contribute to the complementary pattern of expression of these genes that are seen in the developing embryo and offer a mechanistic basis for the lack of Cdx1 expression in regions of the embryo, such as the trunk at E8.5, that are enriched for RA.DISCUSSIONThe results presented in this study provide evidence that COUP-TFs can effectively antagonize the induction of Cdx1 by RA. The inability of the COUP-TFIΔDBD mutant to repress this induction indicates that COUP-TF DNA binding is essential to this outcome. This observation also rules out the possibility that this inhibition results from the interaction between the ligand binding domains of COUP-TFs and RAR as such a mechanism does not require COUP-TF binding to DNA (17.Leng X. Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2332-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Moreover others have shown that COUP-TFs can interact with silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor, nuclear receptor co-repressor, and histone deacetylase 1 (24.Shibata H. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 714-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 25.Smirnov D.A. Hou S. Ricciardi R.P. Virology. 2000; 268: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, trichostatin A did not abrogate the effects of COUP-TF on the Cdx1 promoter (data not shown) suggesting either that histone deacetylase activity is not implicated in this event or that trichostatin A-insensitive histone deacetylases are involved (26.Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 27.Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar).Further evidence for competition for RARE binding comes from the finding that COUP-TFI and COUP-TFIΔDBD heterodimerized and that COUP-TFIΔDBD reversed the inhibitory effects of COUP-TF1 on the Cdx1 promoter. In this regard, the Cdx1 RARE is closely related to a palindromic thyroid hormone receptor response element, and COUP-TF homodimers have been demonstrated to bind efficiently to such motifs (14.Cooney A.J.

A duodenum-specific enhancer identified in the second intron of the human ADA gene controls this pattern of expression. This enhancer faithfully recapitulates this expression pattern in transgenic mice, when included in CAT reporter gene constructions. Multiple binding sites for PDX-1 and GATA factors were previously identified within the ∼300-bp region that encompasses the enhancer. Mutation analyses demonstrated that binding of PDX-1 and of GATA-4 was absolutely essential for enhancer function. In the present study, we have identified additional enhancer binding sites for Cdx factors, for YY1, and for NFI family members. Detailed EMSA studies were used to confirm binding at these sites. This brings the number of confirmed binding sites within the enhancer to thirteen, with five different factors or family of factors contributing to the putative enhanceosome complex. Mutation analysis was utilized to examine the specific roles of the newly identified sites. Two sites were identified that bound both Cdx1 and Cdx2. Mutations were identified in these two sites that completely and specifically eliminated Cdx binding. In transgenic mice, these enhancer mutations dramatically changed the developmental timing of enhancer activation (delaying it by 2–3 weeks) without affecting other aspects of enhancer function. In the chromatin context of certain transgenic insertion sites, mutation of the two YY1 sites to specifically ablate binding caused a delay in enhancer activation similar to that observed with the Cdx mutations.

It has been proposed that increasing complexity in metazoan organisms does not arise from a larger number of genes, but principally from more complex regulation of expression of a similar number of genes (1.Levine M. Tjian R. Nature. 2003; 424: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). The two mechanisms proposed are: (a) a greater number of cis regulatory segments governing specific genes and (b) greater complexity of the multiprotein transcription complexes that regulate gene expression. One of the major types of regulatory sequences in which this complexity resides is the enhancer (2.Maniatis T. Goodbourn S. Fischer J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1237-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 3.Atchison M.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 127-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), where a protein complex known as the enhanceosome forms and functions (4.Carey M. Cell. 1998; 92: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). These enhancers can be tissue-specific, cell-specific, and inducible and are thought to function by increasing the probability of transcription of an associated promoter within a particular cell. A gene may contain several distinct enhancers, each responsible for part of the total pattern of expression of that gene. A typical enhancer is about 500 bp in length and has ten binding sites for sequence-specific transcription factors (1.Levine M. Tjian R. Nature. 2003; 424: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Within this array, there may be multiple sites that bind the same factor or family of factors. The function of the enhancer is determined by the combinatorial effect of all the proteins that bind within the enhancer, and each protein may have a distinct role in that function. The proteins may serve as activators, repressors, or play structural roles.

One of these enhancers has been shown to activate expression specifically in the duodenal epithelium (8.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Thomas M.B. Wiginton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26634-26642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 11.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Lowe S.Y. Cohen M.B. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1080-G1093Google Scholar). This enhancer-driven expression has a specific pattern, not only along the anterior-posterior (A/P) axis, but also the cryptvillus (C-V) axis and the axis of developmental time (8.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Thomas M.B. Wiginton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26634-26642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The enhancer activation is not only duodenal-specific, but is limited to villous epithelium (absent in the crypt epithelium) and occurs perinatally (within a 3–5-day window). This enhancer, located in the second intron of the human adenosine deaminase gene, was shown to contain multiple binding sites for proteins from duodenal nuclear extract (11.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Lowe S.Y. Cohen M.B. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1080-G1093Google Scholar). Five binding sites were identified for the factor PDX-1, and binding of this protein was shown to be essential for enhancer activation and function (12.Dusing M.R. Florence E.A. Wiginton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14434-14442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). That study indicates that PDX-1 may be largely responsible for the A/P pattern of expression by the enhancer, since PDX-1 expression is limited to duodenum in the intestinal epithelium (13.Guz Y. Montminy M.R. Stein R. Leonard J. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V. Teitelman G. Development. 1995; 121: 11-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three GATA factor binding sites were also identified and GATA binding was determined to be critical to high level enhancer function (14.Dusing M.R. Florence E.A. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G1053-G1065Google Scholar). In the present study, we characterize enhancer binding sites for the Cdx factors, for Yin Yang-1 (YY1), and for the NFI family of factors. Identification of these five sites brings the total to thirteen known factor binding sites within the duodenal enhancer. Transgenic mouse studies demonstrated that Cdx binding plays a critical role in the timing of enhancer activation during development of the intestinal epithelium.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14434-14442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 0. 5 pmol of gel-purified, duplexed oligonucleotides were labeled as previously described (11.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Lowe S.Y. Cohen M.B. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1080-G1093Google Scholar). 10 μg of extract was used for each gel shift reaction. Binding reactions were carried out as previously reported (11.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Lowe S.Y. Cohen M.B. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1080-G1093Google Scholar). For competition studies, a 100-fold molar excess of competitor oligonucleotide was added to each reaction. Anti-Cdx1 and anti-Cdx2 antibodies were the generous gift of Peter Traber. Anti-NFI antibody was purchased from Geneka Biotechnology (Montreal, Canada). Supershift EMSAs were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Transgene Preparation—All enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Site-directed mutagenesis was achieved with the Promega Altered Sites protocol (Madison, WI) using pALTER319+ (12.Dusing M.R. Florence E.A. Wiginton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14434-14442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) as a template. Mutated transgene oligonucleotides were prepared at the University of Cincinnati DNA core facility with the following sequences: GTGATGCCCGTAACGTGCTTAGTTCAGGGC (C1mut-ext), GCACACATTAATGTGCTCCAGAAATGTCACTTAATGATAATATT (C2mut-ext), GCACACATTAATGTGCTTTATAAATGTCACTTAATG (C2Amut-ext), GCACACATTAATGTGCTCCATGCATGTCACTTAATG (C2Bmut-ext), AATGTGCTCCATAAATAACACTTAATGATAATATTC (Y1mut-ext), CATGTCAAGCCGCCAACATGCCACAAGGCCCC (Y2mut-ext), and CATGTCAAGCCGCCGTCTTGCCACAAGGCCCC (Nmut-ext). Successive rounds of mutagenesis were used to introduce particular combinations of the mutations shown in Table I into the enhancer core fragment. The mutated BsiW1 enhancer fragments were sequenced in their entirety (University of Cincinnati sequencing core) to ensure fidelity of both the mutated sites and the remaining sequence. In each case the mutated enhancer fragment was then liberated with BsiW1 and ligated into BsiW1 cut p5′acbaL117deltaD (11.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Lowe S.Y. Cohen M.B. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1080-G1093Google Scholar) to generate the plasmids p5′acbaL117 Cdxmut, p5′acbaL117 CdxmutA, p5′acbaL117 CdxmutB, p5′acbaL117 YY1mut, or p5′acbaL117 NFImut. Transgene Fragments, Mice, and Analysis—The transgenes listed as wild type (wt) have been described previously and characterized as TG IV, and TG V (8.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Thomas M.B. Wiginton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26634-26642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Each p5′acba L117mut plasmid was digested with NdeI and PvuI, and the resulting 18,471-bp fragment was isolated and purified as described previously (11.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Lowe S.Y. Cohen M.B. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1080-G1093Google Scholar). YY1 and Cdx mutant mice were made by microinjection at the University of Cincinnati core facility, and NFI mutant mice were made by microinjection at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation core facility. Adult F1-F3 mouse analysis was routinely performed between 4 and 6 weeks of age and for temporal studies at other times as noted. CAT assays, protein concentration, and copy number analysis were performed as described previously (11.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Lowe S.Y. Cohen M.B. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1080-G1093Google Scholar). The Duodenal Enhancer Region Contains Functional Binding Sites for Multiple Transcription Factors—Intestinal expression of adenosine deaminase (ADA) is regulated by a 3.4-kb segment located within the second intron of the human ADA gene (8.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Thomas M.B. Wiginton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26634-26642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Found within this segment is a 319-bp region that functions as a duodenum-specific enhancer (11.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Lowe S.Y. Cohen M.B. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1080-G1093Google Scholar). DNase foot-printing studies with human, rat, and mouse duodenal nuclear extracts have previously revealed five distinct protected regions along this enhancer region (11.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Lowe S.Y. Cohen M.B. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1080-G1093Google Scholar). Potential protein binding sites within these footprinted regions were examined using the TRANSFAC transcription factor data base (16.Wingender E. Chen X. Fricke E. Geffers R. Hehl R. Liebich I. Krull M. Matys V. Michael H. Ohnhäuser R. Prüβ M. Schacherer F. Thiele S. Urbach S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) as well as a data base of sites that our laboratory has assembled from the literature that contains sequences of transcription factors known to be involved in gastrointestinal gene regulation. Putative transcription factor recognition sequences identified within the duodenal enhancer region include five PDX-1 sites, three GATA sites, two Cdx sites, two YY1 sites, and one NFI binding site (Fig. 1). Previous studies have shown that functional PDX-1 and GATA sites are required for high level activation from the duodenal enhancer (12.Dusing M.R. Florence E.A. Wiginton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14434-14442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14.Dusing M.R. Florence E.A. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G1053-G1065Google Scholar). To assess the binding ability of the Cdx, YY1, and NFI sites, oligonucleotides were synthesized that correspond to the sequences (C1, C2/Y1, and Y2/NFI in Table I) in the enhancer region and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed. Oligonucleotide C1 contains the upstream Cdx site, C2/Y1 contains the downstream Cdx site as well as an overlapping upstream YY1 site, and Y2/NFI contains the downstream YY1 site along with an overlapping NFI site. EMSA experiments were performed using each of the above oligonucleotides as a probe. When labeled C2/Y1 was used as probe, multiple shifted complexes were observed, as shown in Fig. 2A. Competition studies showed that addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled Cdx and/or YY1 consensus oligonucleotide prevented the formation of these complexes. Competition was not observed when a nonspecific competitor oligonucleotide was introduced. Similar results with the Cdx complex were observed in competition studies using labeled C1 as probe (data not shown). Because both Cdx1 and Cdx2 recognize the same sequence and both have been observed in the small intestine (17.Silberg D.G. Furth E.E. Taylor J.K. Schuck T. Chiou T. Traber P.G. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 478-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we introduced antibodies specific to each of these proteins in order to verify which was responsible for the formation of the observed Cdx complex. Addition of an anti-Cdx1 or anti-Cdx2 antibody prohibited the formation of part of the broad Cdx band as shown in Fig. 2B, verifying that each of these members of the Cdx family bind to both the upstream (C1) and downstream (C2/Y1) Cdx recognition sequence. When labeled Y2/NFI was used as probe, two more specific complexes were observed, and these were confirmed to involve YY1 and NFI, through competition analysis (Fig. 2C). Addition of an anti-NFI antibody to the reaction significantly reduced the putative NFI band and produced a supershifted complex as shown in Fig. 2D. Commercial YY1 antibodies were found to be ineffective in our hands. Therefore to confirm the identity of the observed YY1 bands, EMSA experiments were performed with a labeled YY1 consensus sequence oligonucleotide. They showed a complex that co-migrates with the YY1 band observed in Fig. 2 (data not shown). The EMSA results as a whole confirm that the shifted complexes observed with the three test oligonucleotides are the result of the binding of Cdx, YY1, and NFI factors to their respective enhancer sequences. Specific Point Mutations Ablate Binding of Cdx, YY1, and NFI, Independently of One Another—The consensus sequence for Cdx (15.Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), YY1 (16.Wingender E. Chen X. Fricke E. Geffers R. Hehl R. Liebich I. Krull M. Matys V. Michael H. Ohnhäuser R. Prüβ M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4353-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and NFI (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), as well as the proposed location of the factor binding sites within each oligonucleotide is shown in Table I. A variety of mutations were introduced into the oligonucleotide sequences and changes in binding were analyzed by EMSA. Mutations that eliminated binding of Cdx, YY1, and NFI without affecting the binding of other protein complexes are designated as C1mut, C2mut, Y1mut, Y2mut, and Nmut in Table I. EMSA experiments with the mutated oligonucleotides that confirm these mutation results are shown in Fig. 3. Gel shifts with the wild-type oligonucleotides are included for comparison. Fig. 3A shows the Cdx and YY1 shifted complexes observed previously when the wild-type oligonucleotide, C2/Y1, was used as probe. When the C2mut oligonucleotide was used as probe, the previously observed Cdx complex did not form. Fig. 3A (right) also displays the Y1mut oligonucleotide used as probe, and the results show that upstream YY1 binding was completely eliminated in the mutated oligonucleotide while Cdx binding to this region remained unaffected. We also ablated binding of the upstream Cdx complex using the C1mut oligonucleotide as shown in Fig. 3B. Here we observed a nonspecific band that co-migrates with the Cdx complex that is seen with both the wild-type and mutated oligonucleotide. This band is specific to the extract used in this experiment and cannot be eliminated by competition with an excess of Cdx consensus oligonucleotide (lanes 2 and 4) or with an excess of nonspecific competitor (data not shown). Using labeled Y2mut oligonucleotide as probe, we show that the downstream YY1 binding was ablated without affecting the overlapping NFI binding (Fig. 3C). Similarly, the Nmut oligonucleotide eliminated NFI binding while YY1 binding was maintained. These mutation studies allowed us to design and create an enhancer fragment devoid of functional Cdx, YY1, and NFI sites independently of one another, while maintaining the integrity of the surrounding protein binding sites. Cdx Mutant, YY1 Mutant, and NFI Mutant Transgenic Mice Maintain Duodenum-specific Activation—Three separate constructions were created for production of transgenic mice based on the mutated oligonucleotides that resulted in loss of binding of Cdx, YY1, or NFI. The mutations were introduced into the enhancer region such that in one construction, both Cdx binding sites were ablated (Cdx mutant), in another both YY1 binding sites were ablated (YY1 mutant), and in the third, the NFI site was eliminated (NFI mutant). In each, the mutated enhancer core replaced the wild-type enhancer core within a 13-kb intragenic ADA fragment, maintaining the same position and orientation. The basic design of the transgenes used has been described previously (8.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Thomas M.B. Wiginton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26634-26642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 11.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Lowe S.Y. Cohen M.B. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1080-G1093Google Scholar). The analogous wild-type and mutant transgenes each contain a 3.8-kb human ADA promoter/5′ flanking segment attached to the CAT coding sequence and the 13-kb fragment containing the enhancer downstream of the CAT reporter cartridge. Five independent Cdx mutant lines, seven YY1 mutant lines, and four NFI mutant lines were analyzed. Various tissues from a minimum of two adult F1-F3 mice from each line were analyzed for CAT activity. Protein concentration and copy number were also assessed, and the calculated CAT activity was normalized to each. In every line from each construction, except for the lowest expressing Cdx line (line 1), duodenum had the highest level of transgene activity by at least two orders of magnitude in comparison to 9–17 other tissues (data not shown). This result is very similar to that seen in mice with the wild-type transgene (11.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Lowe S.Y. Cohen M.B. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1080-G1093Google Scholar, 12.Dusing M.R. Florence E.A. Wiginton D.A. J. Biol.

The duodenal CAT activity values are shown in Table II. The CAT activities in mice with the wild-type transgene have been reported previously (8.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Thomas M.B. Wiginton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26634-26642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 11.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Lowe S.Y. Cohen M.B. Wiginton D.A. Am. J.

Physiol. 2003; 284: G1053-G1065Google Scholar) and are shown here for comparison. In transgenic mice containing the wild-type enhancer the duodenal CAT activity ranges from 1,400–31,000, with a mean activity of 9,100. In contrast, transgenic mice with the enhancer deleted were previously analyzed, and these mice exhibited significantly reduced duodenal CAT activity ranging from 0–1.3, with a mean activity of 0.48 (11.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Lowe S.Y. Cohen M.B. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1080-G1093Google Scholar). Also, in no line of these enhancerless mice was the duodenum the tissue of highest expression.Table IIDuodenal CAT activities of wt, Cdx mutant, YY1 mutant, and NF1 mutant transgenic mice CAT activities from transgenic duodenum normalized to transgene copy number and expressed as pmol/h/100 g/copy are shown. Wt duodenal CAT values have been reported previously (8.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Thomas M.B. Wiginton D.A. J. Biol.

Four of the five Cdx mutant lines had duodenal CAT values that fit well within the range established for the wild-type transgene. The fifth line, line 1, expressed at 1% of the mean wild-type levels and showed no evidence of duodenal-specific enhancer activity. This probably means that this single copy transgene was inserted into a non-permissive site and was subject to positional variegation. While unusual, this has been observed with this enhancer in a wild-type transgene (11.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Lowe S.Y. Cohen M.B. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1080-G1093Google Scholar), indicating that some insertion sites are completely refractory to enhancer function. YY1 mutant mice showed a range of duodenal CAT activity from 180 to 41,000 with a mean activity of 14,000, with most values well within the range of wild-type activity. All seven lines of YY1 mutant mice demonstrated duodenal-specific activation. Unlike the low expressing Cdx mutant line 1, even the low expressing YY1 mutant line 1 exhibited highest activity in duodenum. In that line, the next highest expressing tissue had an activity of 1.3, a value 140-fold lower than the duodenal value. The duodenal activities in NFI mutant mice ranged from 2,400–105,000 with a mean value of 47,000. Interestingly, the two single copy lines have a mean activity of 88,000, a value 10 times greater than that of the wild-type transgenic mice. The value for each was above the highest values in the wild-type transgene range. This suggests the possibility that NFI might act as a repressor in certain chromatin environments. Our laboratory has previously mutated the enhancer binding sites of two other transcription factors, namely PDX-1 and GATA factors, and transgenic mouse analysis provided results markedly different from that of the three constructions discussed here. In both PDX mutant mice and GATA mutant mice, the mutations resulted in complete loss of duodenal activity, suggesting that both of these transcription factors are absolutely required for enhancer function (12.Dusing M.R. Florence E.A. Wiginton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14434-14442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14.Dusing M.R. Florence E.A. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G1053-G1065Google Scholar). In contrast, our results here suggest that Cdx, YY1, or NFI protein binding sites are not essential for high level enhancer activity in adult transgenic mice. Expression Along the Cephalocaudal and Crypt-villus Axes Is Normal for the Mutant Transgenes—The ADA intestinal regulatory region and duodenal enhancer have been shown to drive specific patterns of expression along three axes: the cephalocaudal (A/P axis), the crypt-villus differentiation axis, and the axis of developmental time (temporal axis) (11.Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Lowe S.Y. Cohen M.B. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1080-G1093Google Scholar). Along the A/P axis, wild-type transgene expression in the mouse small intestine is restricted to the duodenal region between the pyloric sphincter and a point 4–5 cm distal to it. Along the crypt-villus axis, high level transgene expression is observed predominantly in differentiated enterocytes found in the villus epithelium. Expression is absent from the crypt compartment of the epithelium. It has been shown that this wild-type trans"
