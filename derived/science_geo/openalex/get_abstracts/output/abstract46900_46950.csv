https://openalex.org/W1595400617,"The proper glycosylation of erythropoietin is essential for its function in vivo. Human erythropoietins were isolated from Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with a human erythropoietin cDNA and from human urine. Carbohydrate chains attached to these proteins were isolated and fractionated by anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and HPLC employing a Lichrosorb-NH2 column. The structures of fractionated saccharides were analyzed by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry and methylation analysis before and after treatment with specific exoglycosidases. Both erythropoietins were found to contain one O-linked oligosaccharide/mol of the proteins, and its major component was elucidated to be NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----3(NeuNAc alpha 2----6)GalNAcOH (where NeuNAc represents N-acetylneuraminic acid) in both proteins. The N-linked saccharides of recombinant erythropoietin were found to consist of biantennary (1.4% of the total saccharides), triantennary (10%), triantennary with one N-acetyllactosaminyl repeat (3.5%), tetraantennary (31.8%), and tetraantennary with one (32.1%), two (16.5%), or three (4.7%) N-acetyllactosaminyl repeats. All of these saccharides are sialylated by 2----3-linkages. Tetraantennary with or without polylactosaminyl units are mainly present as disialosyl or trisialosyl forms, and these structures exhibit the following unique features. alpha 2----3-Linked sialic acid and N-acetyllactosaminyl repeats are selectively present in the side chains attached to C-6 and C-2 of 2,6-substituted alpha-mannose and C-4 of 2,4-substituted alpha-mannose. We have also shown that the carbohydrate moiety of urinary erythropoietin is indistinguishable from recombinant erythropoietin except for a slight difference in sialylation, providing the evidence that recombinant erythropoietin is valuable for biological as well as clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W1551780288,"Modification of calmodulin by protein carboxyl methyltransferase requires deamidation of one or more labile asparagine residues (Johnson, B.A., Freitag, N. E., and Aswad, D. W. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 10913-10916). We now show that deamidation results in the generation of two altered forms of calmodulin, designated A and B, which can be separated by electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions. The A form is characterized by a larger apparent molecular radius, has only 10% the activity of native calmodulin when assayed for its ability to activate a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase from rat brain, and serves as an excellent substrate for the methyltransferase. The B form more closely resembles native calmodulin: it has an apparent molecular radius more like the native, exhibits about 40% the activity of native calmodulin, and is a relatively poor methyl acceptor. Evidence suggests that the A and B forms probably contain isoaspartate (A) and aspartate (B) in place of Asn-60 and/or Asn-97. Incubation of the A form with methyltransferase and S-adenosyl-L-methionine converts about half of the A form to an electrophoretic band indistinguishable from the B form. The activity of this partly converted calmodulin rises to 30-50% that of native calmodulin. These observations imply that the methyltransferase may have a biological role in restoring activity to proteins which contain abnormal isoaspartyl peptide bonds resulting from asparagine deamidation."
https://openalex.org/W1507646165,"A DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that transcribes vaccinia virus early genes was partially purified from virus cores by deoxycholate extraction and DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. Accurately initiated and terminated RNAs were synthesized by this enzyme in the presence of a linear duplex DNA template. Glycerol gradient sedimentation resolved the in vitro transcription system into two components: fraction I, a rapidly sedimenting RNA polymerase that initiated transcription at an early promoter but transcribed beyond the in vivo 3' terminus to yield a run-off transcript, and fraction II, a more slowly sedimenting fraction, itself devoid of RNA polymerase, that restored efficient termination when added back to fraction I. The termination factor was heat-labile, resistant to N-ethylmaleimide, and did not exhibit endonucleolytic activity on run-off transcripts. Factor-dependent termination required specific sequence information upstream of the site of termination. The vaccinia termination factor was purified extensively by column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, heparin-agarose, phosphocellulose, and DNA-agarose, and by velocity sedimentation in a glycerol gradient. At each step, termination factor copurified with the vaccinia mRNA capping enzyme. The preparation was well over 90% pure with respect to the latter enzyme, suggesting that termination activity was tightly associated with, if not intrinsic to, the capping enzyme. Nonetheless, formation of the 5'-cap structure did not appear to be a prerequisite for termination."
https://openalex.org/W1620258338,"The relationship between macrophage cholesterol content and apolipoprotein E (apoE) synthesis was studied in mouse peritoneal macrophages. Incubations in acetylated low density lipoprotein led to a concentration-dependent increase in macrophage free and esterified cholesterol content and apoE synthesis. Enhanced apoE production reflected increased apoE mRNA abundance in cholesterol-enriched cells. Including an inhibitor of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase in incubations with acetylated low density lipoprotein did not diminish the apoE response, suggesting that increased macrophage free cholesterol content was responsible for enhancing apoE production. Incubations in 25-OH cholesterol also produced a dose-dependent stimulation of macrophage apoE synthesis. Removing free cholesterol from cells using high density lipoprotein returned apoE synthetic rates toward base line. Macrophage lysate apoE and medium apoE levels changed in parallel during cholesterol loading and efflux indicating that regulation of apoE by free cholesterol was not primarily at the level of secretion. It is concluded that (a) cholesterol enrichment of macrophages increases apoE mRNA abundance and stimulates apoE synthesis and secretion; (b) neither cholesterol esterification nor cholesteryl ester accumulation are required for increased apoE production."
https://openalex.org/W1638165410,"A rapeseed chromosomal region containing a gene (napA), which encodes the 1.7 S seed storage protein (napin), was isolated in several overlapping recombinant clones from a phage lambda genomic library. Following restriction enzyme mapping of the genomic region, a subclone containing the napA coding region as well as some 1.1 and 1.4 kilobases of DNA from the 5' and 3' regions, respectively, was mapped and sequenced. The gene turned out to lack introns. Southern blotting analyses utilizing a napin cDNA clone as a probe revealed the presence of on the order of 10 napin genes in the rapeseed genome. The major polyadenylated transcript encoded by these genes was shown to be an 850-nucleotide species, the initiation site of which was mapped onto the napA gene. The major initiation site for transcription is located some 33 nucleotides downstream from a sequence perfectly conforming to the consensus sequence of a TATA box. Further analyses of the sequence revealed several features that may be of relevance for the expression of the napin genes."
https://openalex.org/W1595815597,"Chloroperoxidase and H2O2 oxidize styrene to styrene oxide and phenylacetaldehyde but not benzaldehyde. The epoxide oxygen is shown by studies with H2(18)O2 to derive quantitatively from the peroxide. The epoxidation of trans-[1-2H]styrene by chloroperoxidase proceeds without detectable loss of stereochemistry, as does the epoxidation of styrene by rat liver cytochrome P-450, although much more phenylacetaldehyde is produced by chloroperoxidase than cytochrome P-450. Chloroperoxidase and cytochrome P-450 thus oxidize styrene by closely related oxygen-transfer mechanisms. Horseradish peroxidase does not oxidize styrene but does oxidize 2,4,6-trimethylphenol to 2,6-dimethyl-4-hydroxymethylphenol. The new hydroxyl group is partially labeled in incubations with H2(18)O but not H2(18)O2. The hydroxyl group thus appears to be introduced by addition of oxygen to the benzylic radical and water to the quinone methide intermediate but not by a cytochrome P-450-like oxene transfer mechanism. The results support the thesis that substrates primarily or exclusively react with the heme edge of horseradish peroxidase but are able to react with the ferryl oxygen of chloroperoxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1630788741,"A synthetic peptide modeled after the calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain of rabbit skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase, Lys-Arg-Arg-Trp-Lys5-Lys-Asn-Phe-Ile-Ala10-Val-Ser-Ala-Ala-+ ++Asn15-Arg-Phe-Glycyl amide (M5), inhibited the CaM-independent chymotryptic fragment of the enzyme, C35 (Edelman, A. M., Takio, K., Blumenthal, D. K., Hansen, R. S., Walsh, K. A., Titani, K., and Krebs, E. G. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11275-11285), with a Ki of 3.2 +/- 2.1 microM. Inhibition was competitive with respect to the peptide substrate Lys-Lys-Arg-Ala-Ala5-Arg-Ala-Thr-Ser-Asn10-Val-Phe-Ala and was of the noncompetitive linear mixed type with respect to ATP. M5 and homologues with a serine residue substituted at positions 9, 13, or 14 were phosphorylated with the following order of preference: M5(Ser9) greater than M5(Ser13) much greater than M5(Ser14) greater than M5. The order of preference observed agreed with that predicted by comparison of the sequence of these peptides with the phosphorylation sites of myosin P-light chains. Both inhibition of C35 by M5 and phosphorylation of M5 and its serine-substituted homologues were severely curtailed by the addition of a stoichiometric excess of CaM over peptide. Thus, synthetic peptides modeled after the CaM-binding domain of skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase can function as calmodulin-regulated active site-directed inhibitors of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1549614895,"The structural determinants required for interaction of oligosaccharides with leukoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin (L-PHA) and erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin (E-PHA) from Phaseolus vulgaris have been studied by immobilized lectin affinity chromatography. Homogeneous oligosaccharides of known structure, purified following release from Asn with N-glycanase and reduction with NaBH4, were tested for their ability to interact with columns of L- and E-PHA-agarose. The characteristic elution position obtained for each oligosaccharide was reproducible and correlated with specific structural features. In virtually all cases, L- and E-PHA yielded identical results, indicating that their specificities for reduced oligosaccharides are similar. Both lectins retarded oligosaccharides bearing alpha 2,3- but not alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid. Desialylated oligosaccharides containing one, two, three, or four peripheral N-acetyllactosamine-type branches were retarded to varying extents by both lectins; however, this interaction was decreased or eliminated by removal of Gal. Desialylated oligosaccharides containing a bisecting GlcNAc residue attached to the beta-linked core Man displayed the greatest interaction with both lectins. Structures containing terminal sulfate or GalNAc did not interact with either lectin. In some instances, the specificities of L- and E-PHA lectins for free, reduced oligosaccharides differed from those established using glycopeptides. Therefore, the structural requirements for interaction with lectins such as L- and E-PHA must be fully and systematically defined using the appropriate authentic standards in order to use lectin affinity chromatography for the fractionation and characterization of free oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W2126451929,"The structural determinants required for interaction of oligosaccharides with Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCAI) and Ricinus communis agglutinin II (RCAII) have been studied by lectin affinity high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Homogeneous oligosaccharides of known structure, purified following release from Asn with N-glycanase and reduction with NaBH4, were tested for their ability to interact with columns of silica-bound RCAI and RCAII. The characteristic elution position obtained for each oligosaccharide was reproducible and correlated with specific structural features. RCAI binds oligosaccharides bearing terminal beta 1,4-linked Gal but not those containing terminal beta 1,4-linked GalNAc. In contrast, RCAII binds structures with either terminal beta 1,4-linked Gal or beta 1,4-linked GalNAc. Both lectins display a greater affinity for structures with terminal beta 1,4-rather than beta 1,3-linked Gal, although RCAII interacts more strongly than RCAI with oligosaccharides containing terminal beta 1,3-linked Gal. Whereas terminal alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid partially inhibits oligosaccharide-RCAI interaction, terminal alpha 2,3-linked sialic acid abolishes interaction with the lectin. In contrast, alpha 2,3- and alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid equally inhibit but do not abolish oligosaccharide interaction with RCAII. RCAI and RCAII discriminate between N-acetyllactosamine-type branches arising from different core Man residues of dibranched complex-type oligosaccharides; RCAI has a preference for the branch attached to the alpha 1,3-linked core Man and RCAII has a preference for the branch attached to the alpha 1,6-linked core Man. RCAII but not RCAI interacts with certain di- and tribranched oligosaccharides devoid of either Gal or GalNAc but bearing terminal GlcNAc, indicating an important role for GlcNAc in RCAII interaction. These findings suggest that N-acetyllactosamine is the primary feature required for oligosaccharide recognition by both RCAI and RCAII but that lectin interaction is strongly modulated by other structural features. Thus, the oligosaccharide specificities of RCAI and RCAII are distinct, depending on many different structural features including terminal sugar moieties, peripheral branching pattern, and sugar linkages."
https://openalex.org/W1536136278,"Biosynthesis and processing of cathepsin B in cultured human skin fibroblasts were investigated using immunological procedures. Upon metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine for 10 min, a precursor form with Mr 44,500 was identified. During an 80-min chase, about 50% of it was converted to an Mr 46,000 form. Further processing yielded mature forms with Mr 33,000 and 27,000, in a final quantitative ratio of about 3:1. Processing of cathepsin B was inhibited by leupeptin, which led to an accumulation of the Mr 33,000 polypeptide. The Mr 33,000 form appeared to be the most active form and showed a half-time of about 12 h. About 5% of newly synthesized enzyme was secreted as precursor, being detectable extracellularly already after 40 min. NH4Cl enhanced the secretion of the precursor about 20-fold. The precursor and the 33-kDa form contained phosphorylated N-linked oligosaccharides. Cleavage by peptide N-glycosidase F or biosynthesis in the presence of tunicamycin yielded a precursor with Mr 39,000. Evidence of a mannose 6-phosphate-dependent transport of cathepsin B in fibroblasts was obtained on the basis of the following results: (i) cathepsin B precursor from NH4Cl-stimulated secretions was internalized in a mannose 6-phosphate inhibitable manner, and (ii) I-cell fibroblasts secreted more than 95% of newly synthesized cathepsin B precursor. In conclusion, cathepsin B from human skin fibroblasts shows an analogous biosynthetic behavior as other lysosomal enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1507086436,"Oxygen binding curves (OEC) for red cell suspensions have a biphasic shape and reduced n50 values when the concentration of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) is lowered by aging or experimental procedures. The mechanism for the abnormal shape of the OEC has been related to variations in the activity of free DPG. DPG binds to tetrameric Hb at a single site, and in red cells its normal concentration is equivalent to that of tetrameric Hb. This equivalence renders the oxygen affinity of Hb and the shape of the OEC very sensitive to small changes in the activity of DPG. The OEC for stripped Hb solutions in the presence of nonsaturating concentrations of DPG also exhibit a biphasic shape but with much larger changes in the n values than observed for red cells. Upon addition of chloride, a known competitor of DPG binding to Hb, the shape of the OEC becomes similar to that of red cell suspensions with the same DPG/Hb ratio. Studies on Hb solutions in the presence of varying concentrations of DPG, but without chloride, have revealed that the cofactor shifts the entire OEC to the right, including both its upper and lower asymptotes. This finding indicates that DPG lowers the intrinsic oxygen affinity for both the T and R states. Theoretical considerations leading to a successful modeling of OEC obtained under varying conditions of DPG and chloride require an expanded two-state allosteric model in which allowance is made for DPG-dependent variations in the dissociation constants of oxygen for both the T and R conformations."
https://openalex.org/W1512575910,"Cultured smooth muscle cells from rat aorta were loaded with Na+, and Na+/Ca2+ antiport was assayed by measuring the initial rates of 45Ca2+ influx and 22Na+ efflux, which were inhibitable by 2',4'-dimethylbenzamil. The replacement of extracellular Na+ with other monovalent ions (K+, Li+, choline, or N-methyl-D-glucamine) was essential for obtaining significant antiport activity. Mg2+ competitively inhibited 45Ca2+ influx via the antiporter (Ki = 93 +/- 7 microM). External Ca2+ or Sr2+ stimulated 22Na+ efflux as would be expected for antiport activity. Mg2+ did not stimulate 22Na+ efflux, which indicates that Mg2+ is probably not transported by the antiporter under the conditions of these experiments. Mg2+ inhibited Ca2+-stimulated 22Na+ efflux as expected from the 45Ca2+ influx data. The replacement of external N-methyl-D-glucamine with K+, but not other monovalent ions (choline, Li+), decreased the potency of Mg2+ as an inhibitor of Na+/Ca2+ antiport 6.7-fold. Other divalent cations (Co2+, Mn2+, Cd2+, Ba2+) also inhibited Na+/Ca2+ antiport activity, and high external potassium decreased the potency of each by 4.3-8.6-fold. The order of effectiveness of the divalent cations as inhibitors of Na+/Ca2+ antiport (Cd2+ greater than Mn2+ greater than Co2+ greater than Ba2+ greater than Mg2+) correlated with the closeness of the crystal ionic radius to that of Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1516415814,"Trichosanthin, a protein from the Chinese medicinal herb Trichosanthes kirilowii, was purified in two essentially quantitative steps involving CM-Sephadex chromatography and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The protein was found to have a molecular mass of 25-26 kDa, to contain no cysteine, and to contain no glycosidic linkages. Pure trichosanthin was found to have potent abortifacient activity in pregnant mice. In order to understand the molecular basis of this unique biological activity, we have examined the amino acid sequence of the protein. As purified, trichosanthin was found to contain two amino-terminal sequences which differed only in the absence or presence of a tyrosine at residue 1. Sequence analysis of trichosanthin has allowed for determination of the NH2-terminal 38-amino acid residues. Comparison of this sequence to those present in a data base revealed homology with the ricin A-chain. Consistent with this structural homology, we have found that trichosanthin is a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis in a reticulocyte lysate system."
https://openalex.org/W1599773752,"Abstract The O-linked oligosaccharides attached to human erythrocyte glycophorins were extensively characterized. In addition to the previously described disialylated tetrasaccharide, NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----3 (Neu-NAc alpha 2----6)GalNAcOH and monosialylated trisaccharide, NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----3GalNAcOH, novel trisialylated oligosaccharides were isolated. Methylation analysis, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, and enzymatic degradation were used to elucidate the following novel structures: formula; see text: These results suggest that O-linked oligosaccharides with a disialosyl group, NeuNAc alpha 2----8NeuNAc alpha 2----, may be present in various tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1539910487,"Pig blood neutrophils were briefly activated by various fatty acids and then fractionated into membrane vesicles with different NADPH oxidase activities. Treatment of these membranes with a detergent, octyl glucoside, resulted in a high yield of solubilized oxidase, which was subjected to isoelectric focusing on gels (pI 4.0-8.0). 1) A distinct band staining with NADPH-nitroblue tetrazolium focused at pI 5.0. The enzyme (pI 5.0) showed high specificity for NADPH and similar characteristics to the oxidase involved in the respiratory burst. 2) The enzyme was extracted from gel slices and analyzed. When measured promptly after its extraction, its NADPH oxidase activity was high, but there was apparent superoxide dismutase-insensitive cytochrome c reduction, probably due to direct electron transfer to the heme protein. However, it could produce superoxide anion (O2-) under some micelle conditions. 3) Therefore, the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase was employed for the detection of H2O2. A fresh extract of stimulated cells catalyzed equimolar NADPH oxidation and H2O2 production of 306 and 300 nmol min-1 (mg protein)-1, respectively. The Km value of the enzyme for NADPH was 30 +/- 13 (S.D.) microM. The recovery of the extract (pI 5.0) was 19% of the total activity. 4) The enzyme extract contained 1.1-1.9 nmol of FAD/mg of protein, giving a turnover number of 300-600 min-1 in terms of O2- generation/FAD. No heme protein was found in the enzyme. The enzyme was mainly of 67-kDa molecular mass."
https://openalex.org/W1545059003,"Abstract The protease from Southern Copperhead venom that activates protein C was purified to homogeneity by sulfopropyl (SP)-Sephadex C-50 ion-exchange chromatography, Sephadex G-150 gel filtration, and Mono-S fast protein liquid chromatography. The purified enzyme is a glycoprotein containing 16% carbohydrate, and migrated as a single band in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent molecular mass of 40,000 kDa. The enzyme is composed of a single polypeptide chain possessing an NH2-terminal sequence of Val-Ile-Gly-Gly-Asp-Glu-Cys-Asn-Ile-Asn-Glu-His. The purified venom protein C activator hydrolyzed several tripeptide p-nitroanilides. The amidolytic and proteolytic activities of the enzyme were readily inhibited by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, chloromethyl ketones, and human antithrombin III. Covalent binding of diisopropyl fluorophosphate to the enzyme was confirmed using a tritium-labeled preparation of the inhibitor. The venom protease readily activated human and bovine protein C at 1:1000 enzyme:substrate weight ratio. The protease also cleaved human prothrombin, factor X, factor IX, factor VII, and fibrinogen. Prothrombin coagulant activity decreased upon incubation with the venom protease, and the rate of this reaction was reduced in the presence of calcium. Factor X and factor IX coagulant activity increased upon incubation with the venom protease in the presence of calcium, and decreased in the absence of calcium. Human factor VII clotting activity decreased slightly upon incubation with the venom protease. Although the venom protease did not clot human fibrinogen, it nonetheless cleaved the A alpha chain of fibrinogen, and this cleavage appeared to be associated with a measurable increase in the clottability of the protease-treated fibrinogen by thrombin. These data demonstrate that the protein C activator from Southern Copperhead venom is a typical serine protease with a relatively broad specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1551068061,"Assembly of the extrinsic pathway on cell surfaces was investigated by studying the binding and activity of factor VII on the bladder carcinoma cell line J82 which expressed 18,800 milliunits of tissue factor activity/10(6) cells. In binding studies, the association of factor VII to monolayers of cells was time-, temperature-, and calcium-dependent. The ligand binding was specific, reversible, and saturable. This interaction was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to human brain tissue factor. Factor VII added to the cells was recovered as factor VII rather than factor VIIa when incubated in the presence of factor × neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that these cells produced factor X. Specific factor VII binding to the cell revealed a sigmoidal binding isotherm with half-maximal binding occurring at 314 +/- 145 pM to 38,300 +/- 14,300 sites/cell. Hill plots of the binding data indicated an average slope of 2.1. Binding parameters were also determined kinetically. At maximal factor VII-tissue factor complex formation the apparent Km for factor × was 274 nM, the Vmax was 4.15 nM/min, and the kcat was estimated to be 14 s-1. In the presence of excess tissue factor and factor X, increasing amounts of factor VII added to the J82 cells demonstrated a sigmoidal relationship with the rate of factor Xa formation. Hill plots indicated a slope of 2.0 at the lower factor VII concentrations which changed to 1.0 at the higher input amounts of factor VII. Hanes plots were used to determine the apparent dissociation constant of the interaction (222 +/- 85 pM). The Vmax was 5.54 +/- 1.04 nM/min for the cleavage of factor X. These data are consistent with factor VII binding to at least two sites on tissue factor (receptor) with positive cooperativity. Because at saturation the stoichiometry of the factor VII-tissue factor complex is 1:1, tissue factor must be expressed as a dimer on the surface of the J82 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1589793599,"The subunits of phosphorylase kinase are separated and isolated in high yield by gel filtration chromatography in pH 3.3 phosphate buffer containing 8 M urea. Three protein peaks are obtained: the alpha and beta subunits coelute in the first, whereas the gamma and delta subunits are separate peaks. Upon dilution of the denaturant, catalytic activity reappears, associated only with the gamma subunit. As has been previously observed (Kee, S.M., and Graves, D.J. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 4732-4737), addition of calmodulin dramatically stimulates the reactivation of gamma. Inclusion of increasing amounts of the alpha/beta subunit mixture in the renaturation progressively decreases the activity of the renatured gamma or gamma-calmodulin. This inhibition by alpha/beta is likely due to specific interactions with the gamma subunit because the inhibition is less at pH 8.2 than at pH 6.8 and less when equivalent amounts of phosphorylated alpha/beta subunits are used (both alkaline pH and phosphorylation are known to stimulate the activity of the holoenzyme). These results suggest that the role of either the alpha or beta subunits, or perhaps both, in the nonactivated (alpha 2 beta 2 gamma 2 delta 2)2 complex of phosphorylase kinase is to suppress the activity of the gamma subunit and that activation of the enzyme, by phosphorylation for instance, is due to deinhibition caused by release of this quaternary constraint by alpha and/or beta upon gamma."
https://openalex.org/W1499129928,"The secondary structure of bacterio-opsin (BO), the retinal free protein-component of bacteriorhodopsin (BR), has been determined by Raman spectroscopy. Additional circular dichroism (CD) measurements have revealed only negligible conformational differences between BO in apomembranes and BR in purple membranes. Therefore, the secondary structure of BR was derived from the Raman data of BO. The protein conformation was determined to consist of 72-82% helices, 2-11% beta-strands, and 11-17% beta-turns. Only about half of the helical structures correspond to alpha 1-helices, the other half possess non-alpha 1-helical structures. According to the analysis of the Raman data, the derived secondary structure of BR was obtained with high reliability for all structure classes which can be distinguished by this method within the given uncertainty range. This is a remarkable difference from recently published secondary structural data derived from CD measurements where the helix content was reported to be between 50 and 80%. The inherent experimental and methodological uncertainties of the CD-technique leading to such a range of variation are critically discussed in comparison to the method of Raman spectroscopy. The combined application of Raman and CD spectroscopy, as performed here, is demonstrated to be a substantial improvement in the secondary structure determination of retinal-containing membrane proteins. On the basis of our results, some of the recently proposed structural models of BR with a beta-strand content of more than 11% can be ruled out."
https://openalex.org/W1516098858,"Abstract The human insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) gene can specify two primary translation products, IGF-IA and IGF-IB, which differ at their COOH termini and which must undergo extensive proteolytic processing to produce the mature 70-residue circulating peptide. We have used an in vitro transcription/translation/microsomal membrane processing system to define the early events in IGF-I biosynthesis. Our results demonstrate that protein synthesis is initiated at the first in-frame methionine codon for both human IGF-IA and IGF-IB mRNAs, yielding primary translation products of 153 and 195 residues, respectively. Both are cotranslationally translocated into the lumen of canine pancreatic microsomes. Cotranslational proteolytic processing results in the removal of an unusually large 48-amino acid signal peptide. Computer-assisted sequence analysis revealed that this prepeptide contains two domains. Its COOH-terminal 19 residues possess features which are typically encountered in eukaryotic signal peptides. The rest of the IGF-I signal sequence is represented by an unusual extended NH2-terminal domain containing an overall net charge of +5 and 3 clustered cysteines. The size and charge of this NH2-terminal domain distinguish it from comparable regions of other eukaryotic signal peptides including the presegment of human IGF-II. Although no specialized biological role can currently be ascribed to this unique NH2-terminal domain, its remarkable sequence conservation between human and rat suggests an as yet unknown functional significance."
https://openalex.org/W1493333437,"Abstract Rat retina, lens, and kidney from 8-week-old animals were assayed for the steady-state levels of mRNAs for four basement membrane components: The alpha 1 chain of type IV collagen, the alpha 2 chain of type IV collagen, the B1 chain of laminin, and the B2 chain of laminin. Each tissue exhibited markedly different ratios of the four mRNAs. The mRNA ratio for the alpha 1 chain of type IV collagen to the B1 chain of laminin varied from a value of 0.7 in retina to a value of 17 in lens. Also, the mRNA ratio for the alpha 1 chain to the alpha 2 chain of type IV collagen varied from 1.6 in retina to 17 in lens, and the mRNA ratio for the B1 chain to the B2 chain of laminin varied from 0.6 in lens to 2.9 in kidney. The mRNA coding for the alpha 1 chain of type IV collagen decreased in all three tissues as the animals increased in age from 8 to 16 weeks, with the rate of decline being greater in retina than in lens of kidney. The levels of mRNA coding for the B1 and the B2 chains of laminin decreased in the kidney between 8 and 16 weeks but at different rates. Comparison of mRNAs from kidney of rats over this time period showed that the ratio of alpha 1 to B1 remained relatively constant with age, whereas the ratio of B1 to B2 increased. One possible explanation for the results is that each tissue has elaborate, tissue-specific controls for translation that provide synthesis of basement membrane components in the same proportion, in spite of the varying steady-state levels of the mRNAs. A more likely explanation is that different tissues synthesize type IV collagen and laminin at different rates, and that even the subunit compositions of the type IV collagen and laminin molecules vary from tissue to tissue and in an age-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1538216093,"We report the purification from bovine brain and describe some of the properties of a 19-kDa protein, p19, which we have previously shown to undergo hormone-dependent, cAMP-mediated phosphorylation in several peptide hormone-producing tumor cells. The procedure for purifying p19 to apparent homogeneity utilized ammonium sulfate fractionation, sequential chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and phenyl-Sepharose, followed by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Mono Q and, finally, a C8 reverse-phase column. The yield was 0.3-0.5 mg of p19/kg of brain. The molecular weight (Mr = 19,000) and frictional ratio (f/f0 = 1.87) of p19, which were derived from its Stokes radius (33 A) and sedimentation constant (s20,w = 1.4), suggest that the native form of p19 is an asymmetrically shaped monomer. We provide evidence to suggest that p19 is isolated as a mixture of molecular forms consisting of an unphosphorylated form and of three phosphoforms indicative of multisite phosphorylation. These forms cosedimented on sucrose density gradients and coeluted on gel filtration, hydrophobic chromatography, and reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. They were resolved from each other by anion-exchange chromatography. The unphosphorylated form (pI 6.2) was phosphorylated by catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase to a stoichiometry of 0.5 mol of P/mol of p19, thereby giving rise to the three phosphoforms (pI 5.8, pI 5.6, and pI 5.2, respectively). We conclude that p19 is a novel cAMP-dependent protein kinase substrate protein that is present in brain and in peptide hormone-producing tumor cells. Its function remains to be identified."
https://openalex.org/W1573223480,"The alpha and beta subunits of human chorionic gonadotropin are secreted both as a combined, noncovalently linked dimer form as well as uncombined, free forms by human trophoblastic cells. We have utilized the cultured choriocarcinoma cell line JAR to determine what regulates the combination of the two subunits. The human chorionic gonadotropin subunits produced by JAR cells were biosynthetically labeled with [35S] cysteine or [3H]mannose by a pulse-chase protocol, purified by immunoprecipitation with specific antisera that recognize free or combined subunits, and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing or reducing conditions. Radioactively labeled bands were eluted from the gels and analyzed for total counts/minute incorporated, the ratio of free thiols to intramolecular cystine disulfides, and oligosaccharide composition. In some experiments, labeled gel bands were eluted with trypsin under nonreducing conditions, and the trypsin-released peptides were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Using these procedures, the following results were obtained. The earliest, biosynthetically labeled form of the beta subunit detected in JAR cells contains high mannose N-linked oligosaccharides and has one-half of its incorporated cysteines present as free thiols. This form, termed pre-beta 1, has not yet combined with the alpha subunit even though the biosynthetically labeled alpha subunit is present in the cells at the same time. The pre-beta 1 form has a t1/2 of about 4 min and has a precursor-product relationship with a more completely disulfide-bonded form, termed pre-beta 2, which does combine with the alpha subunit to form a dimer. A subset of beta molecules produced in JAR cells does not attain the same disulfide bonding pattern as the pre-beta 2 form, does not combine with the alpha subunit, and is secreted as a free beta subunit into the culture medium. On the other hand, the earliest detectable form of the alpha subunit in JAR cells has all its thiols present as cystine disulfides, at a time when dimerization with the beta subunit has not yet taken place. These results strongly suggest that intramolecular disulfide bond formation in the beta subunit is the crucial and rate-limiting event in alpha beta dimer formation. The subset of beta molecules that remain free do not appear to form the appropriate intramolecular disulfides and thus do not achieve the correct conformation to combine with the alpha subunit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1537455878,"Cholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation in arterial wall macrophages (foam cells), mediated by the intracellular enzyme acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT), is a prominent feature of atherosclerotic lesions. However, native low density lipoprotein (LDL) does not cause activation of ACAT or CE accumulation in cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages despite both substantial LDL uptake and degradation and the presence of ACAT in these cells. We now report that when protein synthesis is inhibited in mouse peritoneal macrophages by treatment with cycloheximide, puromycin, or actinomycin D, native LDL-induced whole-cell ACAT activity and CE accumulation is 10-fold higher than that seen in LDL-treated control cells. The enhancement of ACAT activity was seen 4 h after the addition of cycloheximide, and ACAT activity returned to control values 4 h after the withdrawal of cycloheximide. Postnuclear supernatants and microsomes from cycloheximide-treated mouse peritoneal macrophages also had higher ACAT activity than microsomes from control cells, but the relative enhancement (maximum 3.3-fold) was less than that seen when ACAT was assayed in the intact cell. In contrast to the situation with mouse peritoneal macrophages, cycloheximide treatment of J774 macrophages, which under normal conditions display high ACAT activity and CE accumulation in the presence of native LDL, did not result in further enhancement of either ACAT activity or LDL-induced CE accumulation. From these data we postulate that mouse peritoneal macrophages have a short-lived protein that inhibits ACAT-mediated cholesterol esterification which is responsible for their lack of ACAT response and CE accumulation in the presence of native LDL. The explanation for high ACAT activity and LDL-induced CE accumulation in J774 macrophages may be that these cells lack the putative mouse peritoneal macrophage cholesterol esterification inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1481713864,"The lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylase inhibitors miconazole and ketoconazole have been used to assess their effects upon cholesterol biosynthesis in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. In Chinese hamster ovary cells treated with either agent, an initial accumulation of lanosterol and dihydrolanosterol has been observed. At elevated concentrations, however, ketoconazole, but not miconazole, causes the preferential accumulation of 24,25-epoxylanosterol and squalene 2,3:22,23-dioxide. These metabolites accumulate at the expense of lanosterol, thereby demonstrating a second site of inhibition for ketoconazole in the sterol biosynthetic pathway. Both demethylase inhibitors produced a biphasic modulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. The biphasic modulation is characterized by low levels of the drugs suppressing HMG-CoA reductase activity which is restored to either control or above control values at higher drug concentrations. This modulatory effect of the lanosterol demethylase inhibitors upon HMG-CoA reductase was not observed in the lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylase-deficient mutant AR45. Suppression of HMG-CoA reductase activity is shown to be due to a decrease in the amount of enzyme protein consistent with a steroidal regulatory mechanism. Collectively, the results establish that lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylation, but not 24,25-epoxylanosterol formation, is required to suppress HMG-CoA reductase in the manner described by lanosterol demethylase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1660075376,"Abstract Biphasic modulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) has been demonstrated in primary hepatocyte cultures treated with the lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylase inhibitor miconazole. At concentrations of the drug which lead to suppressed levels of reductase activity, the appearance of a polar, mevalonate-derived sterol is noted. Cochromatography of the identified sterol with 3 beta-hydroxylanost-8-en-32-aldehyde tentatively identified the metabolite as a lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylation intermediate. Subsequent isolation and characterization of the metabolite by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy confirmed this structural assignment. When the lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylase-deficient mutant, AR45, was treated with authentic metabolite, a suppression of HMG-CoA reductase was observed. These results demonstrate that metabolism of the oxygenated biosynthetic intermediate is not required to suppress reductase activity. The results also strongly support the hypothesis that oxygenated 14 alpha-methyl demethylase intermediates are endogenously generated modulators of HMG-CoA reductase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1508066494,"Previously we linked a 0.8-kilobase segment (including the 5'-flanking region and the 5'-terminal exon) of an interferon-activatable mouse gene (202 gene) to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and transfected the construct into mouse Ltk- cells (Samanta, H., Engel, D. A., Chao, H. M., Thakur, A., Garcia-Blanco, M. A., and Lengyel, P. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11849-11858). Treatment of these cells with mouse beta-interferon increased the expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene 5-10-fold. Here we demonstrate that this segment from the 202 gene has characteristics of an interferon-activatable enhancer: (a) it can activate a heterologous promoter (SV40 early promoter), (b) it is active in both the appropriate and the inverted orientation and in either upstream or downstream locations from the promoter activated, and (c) treatment of cells with interferon increases its activity severalfold."
https://openalex.org/W1570050393,"To determine whether far upstream 5'-flanking sequences control rat rDNA transcription, we constructed plasmids containing several 5' and 3' deletions within the nontranscribed spacer region. In vitro transcription of these plasmids identified three enhancer regions, designated A, B, and C, which can dramatically stimulate transcription from the core promoter. Further analysis of region B showed that the enhancer element lies between -2.183 and -2.357 kilobase pairs upstream of the initiation site. The plasmid containing the 174-base pair enhancer element could stimulate rRNA gene transcription as much as 10-20-fold relative to transcription of the plasmid containing only the core promoter. This enhancer was not another promoter domain and could function irrespective of its orientation or distance from the promoter or when inserted downstream of the initiation site. Computer analysis of known sequences of enhancer regions A and C did not reveal any significant homology between these DNA segments and the 174-base pair enhancer element. Competition assay demonstrated that the enhancer element B forms a stable complex with the transcription factor(s) and that interaction between the enhancer and the factor(s) was essential for the stimulation of rDNA transcription. This is the first report of a mammalian ribosomal rDNA enhancer element that exhibits the characteristics of an RNA polymerase II enhancer."

https://openalex.org/W1483514576,"A computerized search for the appearance of heritable mutations (as indicated by changes in protein expression) was conducted on three sets of mice, whose sires had been either untreated, exposed to 3 gray units of gamma radiation, or treated with 150 mg/kg ethylnitrosourea. Proteins from the livers of approximately 800 mice were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and abundances were measured by using image analysis techniques. Heritable mutations were detected by the appearance of new proteins or by the quantitative decrease in abundance of normally occurring proteins. Measurements of the variability of the protein abundance indicate that at least 48 proteins are consistent enough to be used in searches when mutations are expected to result in a 50% reduction in the normal amount of protein. New proteins were found in four offspring from ethylnitrosourea-treated mice, and in each case a nearby spot was found to be significantly diminished. These mutations were confirmed in subsequent generations. A computer-assisted search detected three of these mutations on the basis of the abundance decrease alone. These results indicate that two-dimensional electrophoresis can be used to detect mutations reflected as quantitative changes in protein expression, provided that the proteins to be monitored are quantitatively stable when samples from different individuals are compared."

Structural analyses of radiolabeled oligosaccharides by exoglycosidase digestions, binding by specific anti-carbohydrate antibodies, and analysis of the 3H-labeled glucitol derivative obtained after permethylation and hydrolysis are consistent with the following proposed structure. (formula; see text) The analyses of human milk sialylpentasaccharides from donors typed as Le(a-,b+), Le(a+,b-), and Le(a-,b-) secretor confirmed the secretor gene-dependent expression of the sialylated lacto-N-fucopentaose I (Fuc alpha 1-2Gal beta 1-3[NeuAc alpha 2-6]GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc) and the Lewis gene-dependent expression of the sialylated lacto-N-fucopentaose II (NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-3[Fuc alpha 1-4]GlcNAc beta 1-4Glc).

https://openalex.org/W1509309288,"The kinetics of labeled histone mRNA entry into polysomes was studied in nuclease-treated reticulocyte lysates. Added mRNA rapidly bound 1 or 2 ribosomes. However, the formation of full size polysomes required at least 16 min. The amount of mRNA bound to ribosomes reached a maximum (73%) within 2 min after mRNA addition and then declined slowly for the remainder of the experiment. Two initiation inhibitors, aurintricarboxylic acid and 7-methylguanosine 5'-triphosphate, were found to affect polysome size and the fraction of mRNA in polysomes in an opposite manner. These results suggest that initiation and reinitiation events may be intrinsically different. The relatively long time period required for the formation of large polysomes can be explained by large polysomes having higher initiation and/or reinitiation rates or slower elongation rates. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive. The results suggest that there exist several levels of control which can regulate polysome size and the fraction of mRNA in polysomes."
https://openalex.org/W1603864664,"The ability of isolated rat heart mitochondria to take up coenzyme A (CoA) from the incubation medium was studied. Mitochondria accumulated CoA in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The accumulation process occurred in two phases. Within the first 30 s of incubation, mitochondrial content of CoA increased, and this phase did not plateau in the concentration range studied. Following this initial increase, a second slower phase of CoA accumulation occurred which plateaued around 50 microM CoA. The initial phase was decreased significantly by ATP or by carboxyatractyloside. In contrast, the presence of ATP or carboxyatractyloside did not affect the second phase. Decreasing the temperature from 30 to 0 degrees C did not affect the initial phase, but the second phase was almost abolished. In the presence of metabolic inhibitors (either 2,4-dinitrophenol or a combination of rotenone and antimycin), the initial phase was not affected; but the second phase was abolished. These results suggest that the first phase of mitochondrial CoA accumulation is probably CoA binding to adenine recognizing sites on the mitochondria while the second phase may represent a specific uptake process for CoA which, although not directly ATP-dependent, is energy-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W1518939299,"The Tn10-encoded Tet repressor contains two tryptophan residues at positions 43 and 75. The typical tryptophan fluorescence is decreased upon binding of tet operator. The Tet repressor gene was engineered to replace either or both of the Trp codons by Phe codons. The resulting single tryptophan mutants are called F43 and F75 and the double mutant F43F75. The mutant proteins were purified to homogeneity. They recognize tet operator DNA only in the absence of the inducer tetracycline, indicating an intact tertiary structure of the engineered proteins. F75 and wild-type bind tet operator with the same association constant. The association constants of F43 and F43F75 with tet operator are about 3 orders of magnitude smaller. This indicates that Trp43 is important for tet operator recognition. Trp43 fluorescence is completely quenched in the complex with tet operator DNA while Trp75 remains unaffected. Binding to nonspecific DNA leads only to a 40% decrease of Trp43 fluorescence. This is interpreted as the contribution of the changed environment while the complete quench reflects a tight sequence-specific contact of tryptophan 43 to tet operator DNA. Trp43 is solvent-exposed, while Trp75 is buried in the hydrophobic interior of the protein. These results are discussed in light of the alpha-helix turn-alpha-helix DNA binding motif deduced from homology to other repressor proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1520933788,"The human placental NADP-linked 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase catalyzes oxidoreduction at the 9- and 15-positions of many prostaglandins, but its catalytic efficiency (i.e. kcat/Km) for these reactions is low (Jarabak, J., Luncsford, A., and Berkowitz, D. (1983) Prostaglandins 26, 849-868). In the present study, we demonstrate that both K-region and non-K-region o-quinones of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are excellent substrates for this enzyme. These compounds are reduced with kcat/Km values ranging from 3 to 20 × 10(6) S-1 M-1. The glutathione thioethers of menadione and toluquinone are reduced with similar catalytic efficiencies. Furthermore, these substances and certain other glutathione thioethers are potent inhibitors of prostaglandin B1 oxidation ([I50] = 7 × 10(−8) to 5 × 10(−6) M); while several glutathione thioethers also inhibit polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon quinone reduction ([I50] = 1.7-6.5 microM). These findings raise the possibility that the potential toxicity of quinones of polycyclic aromatic hyrocarbons and other xenobiotic substances may be altered in the placenta by an oxidoreductase for which prostaglandins are relatively poor substrates. They also suggest that the presence in placental tissue of certain glutathione thioethers could influence the reduction of these quinones and other xenobiotic substances by this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1559803897,"Electrochemical reduction of methemoglobin on a platinum electrode is studied by means of thin layer spectroelectrochemistry. For methemoglobin alone in solution, direct reduction is very slow even for potentials close to those of the reduction of the solvent. The reduction of a methemoglobin-oxyhemoglobin mixture with an imposed potential causes the electrochemical reduction of oxygen, the conversion of oxyhemoglobin into deoxyhemoglobin, and a simultaneous transformation of part of the molecules into methemoglobin. When fixed oxygen has disappeared, reduction of methemoglobin takes place. The reduction of methemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin is catalyzed by the presence of flavin mononucleotide (FMN). For the oxyhemoglobin-methemoglobin mixture, flavin makes a fast deoxygenation of oxyhemoglobin without a change in the oxidation state of the iron. It also allows the rapid reduction of methemoglobin. In each case, the resulting deoxyhemoglobin solutions do not show any electrolysis-induced modification of the equilibrium curves for oxygen binding."

https://openalex.org/W1606173294,"Sedimentation analysis has been used to compare the structure of 30-nm chromatin fibers, isolated and digested under conditions that maintain the native structure, with relaxed-refolded chromatin. The native chromatin fibers show sharp, ionic strength-dependent changes in sedimentation coefficient that are not apparent in relaxed-refolded fibers. The first transition at approximately 20 mM ionic strength reflects the organization of the 10-nm polynucleosome chain into a loose helically coiled 30-nm fiber. Between 20 and 60 mM ionic strength there is considerable interaction between nucleosomes within the coils to generate a stable helical array with 12 nucleosomes/turn. Above 60 mM ionic strength the helical coil continues to condense until it precipitates at ionic strengths slightly greater than those considered physiological, indicating that there is no end point in fiber formation. The data is incompatible with a solenoid model with 6 nucleosomes/turn and also rules out the existence of a beaded subunit structure."

The enzyme is extremely labile during purification; rapid handling and the presence of 5% ethanol are essential to enzyme stability. Storage at 77 K in the presence of NADH (1 mM) also confers considerable stability to the purified enzyme. The heme prosthetic group in the enzyme has been identified as protoporphyrin IX. The quantification of prosthetic group components reveals the presence of 1.6 mol of flavin as FMN, 2.0 mol of heme iron, 4.0 mol of acid-soluble (nonheme) iron, and 3.6 mol of free sulfide/210,000 molecular weight enzyme. Ferric and ferrous-CO secondary amine monooxygenase exhibit electronic absorption spectra that are very similar to those of analogous myoglobin derivatives and, therefore, quite distinct from parallel forms of cytochrome P-450, the most extensively studied heme iron-containing monooxygenase. Like myoglobin and, again, in contrast to P-450, this enzyme forms a very stable dioxygen complex. In fact, it is this oxygen-bound form of the enzyme that is obtained from the purification procedure. Once again, the absorption spectrum of oxygenated secondary amine monooxygenase is nearly identical to that of oxymyoglobin. The spectroscopic similarities between secondary amine monooxygenase and myoglobin suggest the presence of an endogenous histidine fifth ligand to the heme iron of the enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1548467415,"Abstract The substrate analogue 3-bromo-2-ketoglutarate reacts with pig heart NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase to yield partially inactive enzyme. Following 65% inactivation, no further inactivation was observed. Concomitant with this inactivation, incorporation of 1 mol of reagent/mol of enzyme dimer was measured. The dependence of the inactivation rate on bromoketoglutarate concentration is consistent with reversible binding of reagent (KI = 360 microM) prior to irreversible reaction. Manganous isocitrate reduces the rate of inactivation by 80% but does not provide complete protection even at saturating concentrations. Complete protection is obtained with NADP+ or the NADP+-alpha-ketoglutarate adduct. By modification with [14C]bromoketoglutarate or by NaB3H4 reduction of modified enzyme, a single major radiolabeled tryptic peptide was obtained by high performance liquid chromatography with the sequence: Asp-Leu-Ala-Gly-X-Ile-His-Gly-Leu-Ser-Asn-Val-Lys. Evidence in the following paper (Bailey, J.M., Colman, R.F. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 12620-12626) indicates that X is glutamic acid. Enzyme modified at the coenzyme site by 2-(bromo-2,3-dioxobutylthio)-1,N(6)-ethenoadenosine 2',5'-biphosphate in the presence of manganous isocitrate is not further inactivated by bromoketoglutarate. Bromoketoglutarate-modified enzyme exhibits a stoichiometry of binding isocitrate and NADPH equal to 1 mol/mol of enzyme dimer, half that of native enzyme. These results indicate that bromoketoglutarate modifies a residue in the nicotinamide region of the coenzyme site proximal to the substrate site and that reaction at one catalytic site of the enzyme dimer decreases the activity of the other site."

Liver membranes from the mutant mice bound 4-5-fold less 125I-EGF/unit of protein than did their normal littermates, but exhibited normal EGF binding affinity. Similar decreases in EGF binding were noted in liver membranes from homozygous fa/fa Zucker rats, another obese, hyperinsulinemic animal model, when compared to values from control animals. We also immunoprecipitated hepatic EGF receptors from mice injected with [35S]methionine, and found that livers from db/db mice contained approximately 35% of the labeled EGF receptors found in control animals. Both ob/ob and db/db mice had serum immunoreactive EGF levels similar to or lower than those found in unaffected littermates, suggesting that ligand-mediated down-regulation of receptors was not the cause of the decreased EGF binding. In one mutant, db/db, the decreased binding was associated with a 6-fold decrease in the levels of liver EGF receptor mRNA transcripts; in the ob/ob mice, at most a 2-fold decrease in the level of liver EGF receptor transcripts was observed. EGF binding to cultured peritoneal fibroblasts derived from db/db mice was normal, suggesting that the abnormality in the mutant mice might result from altered environmental or tissue-specific factors rather than an abnormal receptor gene. This was supported by Southern blot analysis of DNA from these animals, which showed identical restriction fragment patterns for the EGF receptor gene in both control and mutant animals. These data indicate that three distinct strains of obese hyperglycemic rodents have decreased levels of hepatic EGF receptors, and suggest that this decrease may result from altered environmental stimuli or tissue-specific factors rather than a primary defect in the EGF receptor gene."

In vivo labeling in the presence of cycloheximide during heat shock showed no heat shock protein synthesis.

https://openalex.org/W1518413662,"recA protein promotes the formation and processing of joint molecules of homologous double-stranded DNA and single-stranded DNA. We studied the effects of an anti-recA protein monoclonal IgG (ARM193) on two processes carried out by the recA protein. The homologous matching, i.e. pairing of double-stranded DNA and single-stranded DNA by forming intermolecular base-pairing at homologous regions was found to occur even in the presence of an excess amount of antibody ARM193. On the other hand, processive unwinding, i.e. the propagation of the unwinding of double-stranded DNA through a processive reaction of recA protein, which occurs even in the absence of single-stranded DNA, was found to be very sensitive to the inhibition by antibody ARM193. Therefore, we conclude that homologous matching and processive unwinding are independent of each other. Analysis of the effect of antibody ARM193 on the various activities of recA protein suggests that the entire reaction of the formation of joint molecules and their processing can be rationalized in terms of these two underlying processes, homologous matching and processive unwinding. This analysis also suggests that homologous matching seems to require only the binding itself of active units of recA protein to single-stranded DNA but not necessarily either the cooperativity of the protein or unwinding."
https://openalex.org/W1585942944,"The size distribution of chromatin fragments released by micrococcal nuclease digestion of liver chromatin at various ionic strengths was examined. Below 20 mM ionic strength, gradient profiles with a peak centered at 6 nucleosomes are generated, whereas between 20 and 50 mM the peak is always centered on 12 nucleosomes, and above 50 mM ionic strength the 30-nm fiber becomes less accessible to the nuclease and there is a corresponding increase in the size distribution of fragments in the gradients. However, extensive digestions always give profiles with a peak of 12 nucleosomes as nuclease-resistant dodecamers accumulate. All of these observations are consistent with the winding of the 10-nm polynucleosome chain into a helical coil commencing at about 20 mM ionic strength. The helical turns are stabilized by histone H1 interactions between 20 and 50 mM ionic strength producing stable dodecamers. Above 50 mM ionic strength the coil condenses longitudinally and the profiles are consistent with a random attack of this fiber by the nuclease. Consequently it is not necessary to invoke the existence of a subunit bead to explain the profiles. We further define the conditions at which specific structural transitions take place and provide methodology for the preparation of chromatin at various levels of condensation."

When the time courses for the appearance of trichloroacetic acid/phosphotungstic acid-soluble and -insoluble radioactivities were independently analyzed, identical observed rate constants (kobs) were obtained. This is in agreement with an earlier claim that regurgitated protein and low molecular weight products arise from a common intracellular pool of radiolabeled substrates, presumably within lysosomes, and that the traffic of substrates between the plasma membrane and the lysosome is probably bidirectional (Buktenica, S., Olenick, S. J., Salgia, R., and Frankfater, A. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9469-9476). When intrinsic degradation rate constants (kd) were calculated, these were found to vary inversely with protein subunit molecular weights, from 0.0347 h-1 for horse heart cytochrome c to 0.0104 h-1 for rabbit muscle phosphorylase b. The proportion of peptide bonds in a protein which are initially available to the action of lysosomal proteases should be proportional to the fraction of the total potential surface of a protein which remains accessible to solvent after polypeptide folding (AS/AT). In agreement, lysosomal degradation rates were observed to correlate well with known or estimated values of AS/AT, and thermal denaturation, which may expose previously buried amino acid residues, increased the rate of degradation of bovine serum albumin."
https://openalex.org/W1557393783,"A hybridoma secreting monoclonal antibodies against RNA polymerase I was produced by the fusion of myeloma cells with spleen cells from a nonimmunized MRL/lpr mouse which is known to produce autoantibodies to RNA polymerase I. The antibodies (McAb-2D11) belong to the IgG2b subclass, reacted specifically with the second largest (120 kDa) subunit of RNA polymerase I, and inhibited accurate transcription of cloned rat rDNA in a fractionated cell extract following immunoprecipitation of RNA polymerase I. McAb-2D11 did not inhibit RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription of the mouse metallothionein-I gene. Immunocytochemical procedures with biotinylated second antibody demonstrated specific immunolocalization of RNA polymerase I in the nucleus. These studies have (a) presented direct evidence that autoantibodies to functional RNA polymerase I are produced in a murine model of systemic lupus erythematosus, (b) demonstrated specificity of the monoclonal antibody for RNA polymerase I, and (c) provided a useful tool for the purification of RNA polymerase I and/or transcription factor(s) associated with RNA polymerase I."
