https://openalex.org/W2025974453,"HIF-1α (hypoxia-inducible factor 1α) is a basic-helix-loop-helix PAS (Per/Arnt/Sim) transcription factor that, under hypoxic conditions, dimerizes with a partner factor, the basic-helix-loop-helix/PAS protein Arnt, to recognize hypoxia-responsive elements of target genes. It has recently been demonstrated that HIF-1α protein but not mRNA levels are dramatically up-regulated in response to hypoxia. Here we show that inhibitors of 26 S proteasome activity produced a dramatic accumulation of endogenous as well as transfected HIF-1α protein under normoxic conditions, whereas the levels of Arnt protein were not affected. HIF-1α was polyubiquitinated in vivo under normoxic conditions, indicating rapid degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This degradation process appeared to target a region within the C terminus of HIF-1α. Importantly, HIF-1α ubiquitination was drastically decreased under hypoxic conditions. Up-regulation of HIF-1α protein by proteasome inhibitors did not result in transcriptional activation of reporter genes, indicating either the requirement of additional regulatory steps to induce functional activity of HIF-1α or the inability of polyubiquitinated forms of HIF-1α to mediate hypoxic signal transduction. In support of both these notions, we demonstrate that HIF-1α showed hypoxia-dependent translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and that this regulatory mechanism was severely impaired in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the mechanism of hypoxia-dependent activation of HIF-1α is a complex multistep process and that stabilization of HIF-1α protein levels is not sufficient to generate a functional form.

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) 1The abbreviations used are: HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α; EPAS1/HLF, endothelial PAS domain protein 1/HIF-1α-like factor; PAS Per-Arnt-Sim homology, DotapN-[1(2, 3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfate; LLnL, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal; CMV, cytomegalovirus. consists of a heterodimer of two basic helix-loop-helix PAS proteins, HIF-1α and Arnt. Upon decrease in oxygen tension, the activated HIF-1α·Arnt complex functions as a transcription factor to control the expression of genes encoding products aimed at restoring cellular homeostasis such as erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and several glycolytic enzymes (reviewed in Ref. 1Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 609-616PubMed Google Scholar). Both HIF-1α and Arnt mRNAs are constitutively expressed in a number of mammalian cell lines under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, suggesting that functional activity of the HIF-1α·Arnt complex is regulated by some as yet unknown post-transcriptional mechanism(s). Recently we and others have shown that HIF-1α protein levels are rapidly and dramatically up-regulated upon exposure of target cells to hypoxia (2Kallio P.J. Pongratz I. Gradin K. McGuire J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism by which HIF-1α becomes activated during hypoxia remains unclear. This process may involve either increased translation or increased stability of the HIF-1α protein or both. It has previously been suggested that inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide blocks induction of HIF-1α/Arnt DNA binding activity, indicating that the rate of synthesis of the HIF-1α subunit may have been altered (5Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar, 6Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21513-21518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In striking contrast to this report, the addition of cycloheximide after maximal hypoxic induction was reported to have no effect either on the protein levels of HIF-1α or on the DNA binding activity by the HIF-1α·Arnt complex (4Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), suggesting that an increase in protein stability rather than increased translation may primarily determine the induction response. Furthermore, it has been shown that the HIF-1α protein has a rapid turnover with an estimated half-life of 5 to 10 min upon return of target cells to normoxia after induction (7Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5105) Google Scholar). Recently, a basic helix-loop-helix PAS protein with high similarity to HIF-1α, EPAS1/HLF (endothelial PAS domain protein 1/HIF-1α-like factor), has been identified. After activation by hypoxia, this factor functions as a heterodimer with Arnt and can bind to the same DNA elements as the HIF-1α·Arnt complex (8Flamme I. Fröhlich T. von Reutern M. Kappel A. Damert A. Risau W. Mech. Dev. 1997; 63: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 9Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russel D.W.

A. 1997; 94: 4273-4278Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). In contrast to the ubiquitous mRNA expression pattern of HIF-1α, expression of EPAS1/HLF mRNA is predominantly restricted to endothelial cells (9Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russel D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar,10Ema M. Taya S. Yokotani N. Sogawa K. Matsuda Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4273-4278Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). For many short-lived eukaryotic proteins, conjugation to the short polypeptide ubiquitin is a mandatory step in their degradation. Highly selective degradation of target proteins is a central component of a great variety of cellular regulatory mechanisms, examples ranging from the progression of the cell cycle, maintenance of circadian rhythms, to the pathways controlling signal transduction and metabolism (11Gottesman S. Maurizi M. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 592-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). The advantages obtained by this regulatory mechanism are obvious. In addition to the irreversibility of the inactivation, the other major benefit is the speed by which new steady-state levels of regulatory molecules can be established. Here we show that the HIF-1α protein is polyubiquitinated under normoxic conditions and that this ubiquitination activity is significantly decreased in response to hypoxic conditions. Moreover, HIF-1α levels were up-regulated under normoxic conditions in the presence of inhibitors of the proteasome, strongly suggesting that HIF-1α function is regulated by proteasome-mediated degradation. This degradation process appeared to target the C terminus of HIF-1α. Finally, we demonstrate that HIF-1α translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to hypoxia and that this function as well as the transactivation function of HIF-1α is perturbed in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. Proteasome inhibitorsN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (LLnL) and clasto-lactacystin β-lactone were obtained from Sigma and Calbiochem, respectively. Expression plasmid encoding histidine-tagged ubiquitin (13Treier M. Staszevski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Dirk Bohmann (EMBL, Heidelberg). The iron-chelating agent 2,2′-dipyridyl was purchased from Sigma. pFLAG CMV2- HIF-1α encoding FLAG epitope-tagged HIF-1α was assembled by subcloning in-frame the full-length coding sequence of HIF-1α from pGEX4T3- HIF-1α to BamHI/SmaI-digested pFLAG CMV2 (Eastman Kodak Co.). The construction of the various HIF-1α deletion mutants fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain will be presented elsewhere. 2P. Carrero, P. Coumailleau, S. O'Brien, and L. Poellinger, manuscript in preparation. COS7 cells (from ATCC) were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum plus penicillin (50 IU/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). The cells were transfected using Dotap (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For ubiquitination assays, 6 μg of FLAG-tagged HIF-1α or the empty control plasmid in combination with 6 μg of His-tagged ubiquitin (or the control plasmid) were used per 60-mm dish. When comparing the expression levels of various constructs, cells were collectively transfected in a 80-cm2 flask and, after transfection, split onto 60-mm dishes for treatments. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (2Kallio P.J. Pongratz I. Gradin K. McGuire J. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Primary mouse brain endothelial cells (kindly supplied by Dr. Yihai Cao, Karolinska Institute) were incubated in F12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. For transactivation experiments, cells were transiently transfected with pCMV-HIF-1α (14Gradin K. McGuire J. Wenger R.H. Kvietikova I. Whitelaw M. Toftgård R. Tora L. Gassmann M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5221-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) together with a luciferase reporter gene carrying three tandem copies of the hypoxia response element of the erythropoietin gene (HRE-luc). Six h after transfection, cells received fresh medium and were either left nontreated or treated with 100 μm 2,2′-dipyridyl or 35 μm LLnL for 24 h before harvesting. COS7 cells were grown on fibronectin-coated coverslips in 6-well culture plates and transiently transfected with pCMV-HIF-1α. After 24 h of expression, the cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 20 μmLLnL for 12 h and further incubated with or without 100 μm 2,2′-dipyridyl for 6 h. Thereafter, fixation of the cells was performed with a freshly prepared solution of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. The fixed cells were incubated with anti-human HIF-1α rabbit antiserum (2Kallio P.J. Pongratz I. Gradin K. McGuire J. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 9 h at 4 °C. Indirect immunofluorescence was obtained by incubation with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies and Texas red-conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides and subjected to microscopic analysis. Twenty h after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1.3 ml of 6 m guanidinium-HCl in 20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, per 60-mm dish. The lysate was passed through a 27-gauge needle to decrease viscosity, and the protein concentration was measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay. Twenty μl of Talon metal affinity resin (CLONTECH) was then added/900 μg of total protein. The lysate was rotated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of 10 mm imidazole. The matrix was then washed with decreasing concentrations of guanidinium-HCl (buffers containing 1:2 and 1:4 dilutions of the original guanidinium-HCl in buffer A (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 15% glycerol) supplemented with 10 mm imidazole) and then finally washed with a 1:8 dilution of this buffer before washing with buffer A only. Remaining proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer supplemented with 100 mm EDTA and analyzed by immunoblotting. The detailed protocol for the immunoblotting of HIF-1α and Arnt proteins together with description of the rabbit antiserum has been described previously (2Kallio P.J. Pongratz I. Gradin K. McGuire J. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The anti-HIF-1α antiserum used is specific for HIF-1α, because it does not recognize in vitro translated EPAS/HLF (data not shown). For the detection of the FLAG epitope-tagged constructs or GAL4 fusion proteins, proteins were blotted after SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis onto nitrocellulose filters and blocked overnight with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline. Either the anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Kodak) or anti-GAL4 antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) were used as a primary antibody in a dilution of 10 μg of protein/ml of Tris-buffered saline containing 1% nonfat milk for 2 h. After several washes, a 1:750 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in Tris-buffered saline, 1% nonfat milk was used as a secondary antibody. After extensive washing with Tris-buffered saline, the complexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In the case of a broad number of either inducible or periodically expressed gene products, a major determinant of the protein levels is the turnover rate of the polypeptide (12Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 15Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). Previously we and others have shown that hypoxic stimulation either by lowering the oxygen concentration or by exposing cells to hypoxia-mimicking (16Goldberg M.A. Dunning S.P. Bunn H.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) chemicals such as CoCl2 or desferrioxoamine leads to a rapid increase in cellular HIF-1α levels but not those of the partner factor Arnt (2Kallio P.J. Pongratz I. Gradin K. McGuire J. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar,4Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Therefore we attempted to investigate whether blocking one of the major cellular protein degradation pathways, i.e. the pathway mediated by the 26 S proteasome, would lead to accumulation of HIF-1α protein also under normoxic conditions. To this end we exposed mouse brain primary endothelial cells to the peptide aldehyde LLnL, an inhibitor of the proteasomal pathway, and analyzed whole cell extracts by immunoblotting using HIF-1α-specific antisera. As shown in Fig.1, treatment of mouse brain endothelial cells with 35 μm LLnL for 20 h resulted in a marked increase of endogenous HIF-1α protein levels (whereas most of the nonspecific cross-reacting signals remained unaffected). Because LLnL is also known to have an inhibitory effect on some nonproteasomal degradation pathways, e.g. those mediated by lysosomes or by calpains and cathepsins (17Craiu A. Gaczynska M. Akopian T. Gramm C.F. Fenteany G. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13437-13445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), we decided to perform the same experiment using clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, a highly selective inhibitor of 26 S proteasome activity (18Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schibe S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). Lactacystin and its more potent derivative, clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, have both been shown to modify and thereby inactivate the catalytic β-subunits of the proteasome (17Craiu A. Gaczynska M. Akopian T. Gramm C.F. Fenteany G. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13437-13445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Interestingly, incubation of the brain endothelial cells in the presence of 5 μm clasto-lactacystin β-lactone for 20 h also lead to a marked stabilization of HIF-1α protein levels as compared with cells treated with vehicle only (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 1 and 2). Furthermore, identical results were obtained in the mouse hepatoma cell line Hepa 1c1c7 (data not shown). In parallel experiments, we examined the effect of the two proteasome inhibitors, clasto-lactacystin β-lactone and LLnL, on intracellular levels of Arnt in primary mouse brain endothelial cells. In contrast to HIF-1α protein levels, Arnt protein levels remained unaffected upon exposure to these inhibitors (Fig. 1 B), in excellent agreement with the observation that hypoxic treatment does not alter Arnt protein levels (2Kallio P.J. Pongratz I. Gradin K. McGuire J. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that HIF-1α protein levels are specifically up-regulated in the presence of proteasome inhibitors and that this enhanced accumulation of protein is associated with increased metabolic stability. To examine whether transiently expressed HIF-1α follows the same mode of regulation as the endogenous protein, we transiently transfected COS7 cells with a FLAG epitope-tagged HIF-1α expression vector and, 20 h after transfection, exposed the cells to either inducers of the hypoxic response or to proteasome inhibitors. These conditions were identical to those used above when studying endogenous HIF-1α protein levels. After induction for 24 h, the cells were harvested and analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of the transfected protein. As seen in Fig. 2, even the high level of expression usually obtained after transfection into COS7 cells did not allow us to detect by immunoblot analysis any significant levels of FLAG-HIF-1α expression in normoxic cells, suggesting also that transfected HIF-1α is rapidly degraded. However, in analogy to the endogenous HIF-1α protein levels (2Kallio P.J. Pongratz I. Gradin K. McGuire J. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), exposure of cells to the hypoxia-mimicking iron chelator 2,2′-dipyridyl leads to a very significant accumulation of epitope-tagged HIF-1α. Thus, these data suggest that the increase in HIF-1α protein levels is mediated by sequences within the coding region of the gene product. Furthermore, in analogy to the endogenous HIF-1α, exposure of the transfected cells to proteasome inhibitors, either the peptide aldehyde LLnL or clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, dramatically increased the levels of epitope-tagged HIF-1α (Fig. 2; compare lanes 1,3,and 4), indicating that the transiently expressed protein is rapidly degraded via the 26 S proteasome. Under hypoxic conditions, up-regulation of HIF-1α protein levels correlates with induction of hypoxia-regulated genes and activation of reporter genes (1Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 609-616PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kallio P.J. Pongratz I. Gradin K. McGuire J. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Given the up-regulation of both endogenous and transiently expressed HIF-1α protein levels upon exposure of cells to proteasome inhibitors under normoxic conditions, we next wanted to examine the effects of these inhibitors on functional activities of HIF-1α. In control experiments, treatment of mouse brain endothelial cells with 2,2′-dipyridyl resulted in potent activation of a hypoxia-responsive reporter gene construct (Fig. 3). Strikingly, however, exposure of the cells to increasing concentrations of the proteasome inhibitor LLnL under normoxic conditions did not result in activation of the reporter gene (Fig. 3). Thus, these results indicate that mere up-regulation of HIF-1α protein levels by proteasome inhibitors was not sufficient to elicit a transcriptional response. In conclusion, under these conditions, HIF-1α may not be functional, and/or additional regulatory steps may be important to activate HIF-1α function. In support of this model, 2,2′-dipyridyl-induced transcriptional activation by HIF-1α was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by cotreatment of the cells with LLnL (Fig. 3). We next transiently expressed HIF-1α in COS7 cells using a CMV promoter-driven expression vector and studied the intracellular localization of HIF-1α. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α immunoreactivity of rather low intensity was preferentially localized in the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell, as assessed by immunostaining using polyclonal anti-HIF-1α antibodies. In contrast, exposure of the cells to the hypoxia-mimicking agent 2,2′-dipyridyl resulted in an almost complete nuclear translocation of HIF-1α with no detectable immunoreactivity remaining in the cytoplasm (Fig.4). After incubation of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor LLnL under normoxic conditions, high intensity HIF-1α immunoreactivity was uniformly distributed throughout the cell. Strikingly, this intracellular distribution was not altered upon exposure of the cells to a combination of both LLnL and 2,2′-dipyridyl (Fig. 4). Thus, hypoxia-dependent nuclear accumulation of HIF-1α was impaired upon stabilization of HIF-1α protein levels by LLnL. In our initial attempts to map the putative destabilizing elements within the HIF-1α protein, we transiently expressed in COS7 cells a set of HIF-1α deletion mutants fused to the minimal DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (schematically represented in Fig.5 A). In excellent agreement with the corresponding effects on endogenous HIF-1α levels (Fig. 1), GAL4-HIF-1α levels were significantly increased upon exposure of the cells to either 2,2′-dipyridyl, LLnL, or a combination of these two agents (Fig. 5 B; compare lane 1 to lanes 2–4). A very similar mode of regulation of the protein levels was observed using the HIF-1α deletion mutant GAL4 HIF-1α 1–652. Importantly, the protein levels of GAL4-HIF-1α 526–826 spanning the C terminus of HIF-1α were also stabilized by treatment with either 2,2′-dipyridyl, LLnL, or a combination of both. Interestingly, the C terminus of HIF-1α (residues 526–826) harbors both an N-terminal and a C-terminal transactivation domain, which both act in concert with one another to mediate hypoxia-inducible transcriptional activation (19Pugh C.W. O'Rourke J.F. Nagao M. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11205-11214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar,20Jiang B.-H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In addition, as outlined in Fig. 5 A, this region of HIF-1α contains in the vicinity of the N-terminal transactivation domain a sequence with strong similarity to a PEST motif, which often targets proteins for rapid degradation (21Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar). Apart from this motif, the C terminus of HIF-1α does not display any significant similarity to previously described protein-destabilizing elements. The C-terminal transactivation domain of HIF-1α contained in GAL4 HIF-1α 786–826 showed significant and stable steady-state levels of expression upon transient expression in normoxic COS7 cells. These stable protein levels were not further increased in response to hypoxic stimulation and only slightly elevated in the presence of proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 5 B; compare lanes 13–16). In conclusion, these data indicate that the region spanning the N-terminal transactivation domain of HIF-1α also contains a structural motif involved in protein destabilization under normoxic conditions and, thus, shows a complex functional architecture. It is noteworthy that EPAS/HLF, which also mediates hypoxia-inducible transcriptional activation (9Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russel D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 10Ema M. Taya S. Yokotani N. Sogawa K. Matsuda Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4273-4278Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), contains a PEST motif in a very similar region of the protein. Consistent with this observation and in analogy to GAL4 HIF-1α, GAL4 HIF-1α 1–652, and GAL4 HIF-1α 526–826, GAL4 HLF steady-state protein levels were hardly detectable upon transient expression in COS7 cells under normoxic conditions and significantly stabilized after exposure to hypoxic stimulation, proteasome inhibitor, or both treatments (data not shown). In contrast, in control experiments, the minimal GAL4 DNA binding domain was stably expressed under normoxic conditions and showed only modest stabilization in the presence of proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 5 C). To directly assess whether HIF-1α can form ubiquitin conjugates in vivo, COS7 cells were cotransfected with an HIF-1α expression vector together with a vector expressing multimerized polyhistidine-tagged ubiquitin or a corresponding control vector (13Treier M. Staszevski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were exposed to either LLnL, clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, or to vehicle only. After incubation for 20 h, cells were harvested in a denaturing buffer to prevent protein degradation and to permit co-purification of noncovalently associated polypeptides. To this end, equal amounts of total cellular protein were incubated with a metal-affinity resin, and ubiquitin-conjugated proteins were affinity-purified and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 6). These experiments show that immunoreactivity, either against the epitope tag (Fig. 6 A) or against HIF-1α (Fig. 6 B), was detected only upon transient expression of HIF-1α and histidine-tagged ubiquitin in the presence of the proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 6, A and B, lane 6). In control reactions lacking either transfected His-tagged ubiquitin or HIF-1α, no signals were seen (Fig. 6, A and B,lanes 1–4). Thus, no background reactivity was demonstrated under the stringent washing conditions used. By contrast, the reason for the absence of virtually any immunoreactivity in thelanes containing both transfected HIF-1α and histidine-tagged ubiquitin lacking proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 6,A and B, lane 5) is most likely explained by the extremely rapid turnover of multiubiquitinated complexes with a half-life being in the range of 1 min (22Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). Importantly, simultaneous stimulation of the cells with the hypoxia-mimicking agent 2,2′-dipyridyl very significantly decreased the affinity-purified levels of multiubiquitinated HIF-1α as compared with those detected under normoxic conditions (Fig. 6, A andB, compare lanes 6 and 7). In conclusion, the decreased levels of ubiquitinated HIF-1α are consistent with the elevated protein levels observed under these conditions (Fig. 2). Mammalian cells contain two distinct major proteolytic pathways (reviewed in Refs. 12Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar), one important nonlysosomal machinery for degradation of intracellular proteins being the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In this pathway, proteins are recognized by the ubiquitin-conjugating system in a process where multiple copies of the 76-amino acid ubiquitin polypeptide are assembled in a three-step mechanism onto the ε-amino groups of lysine residues of the target protein. The ubiquitinated substrates are then rapidly escorted for hydrolysis to the 26 S proteasome, whereas the ubiquitin molecules are recycled via the action of deubiquitinating enzymes present in the 26 S complex (12Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 15Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). HIF-1α is among the most short-lived proteins currently known. Its half-life after induction and subsequent return of the cells to normoxia is in the range of a few min (7Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5105) Google Scholar), remarkably short compared with other stress-activated transcription factors such as c-Jun (half-life ≈ 90 min (23Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Science. 1997; 275: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar)) or p53 (half-life ≈ 7–8 h; Ref. 24Kubbutat M.H.G. Jones S.N. Voudsen K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar and references therein). In our efforts to characterize the mechanisms of activation of HIF-1α function and given the massive up-regulation of HIF-1α protein levels by hypoxia (2Kallio P.J. Pongratz I. Gradin K. McGuire J. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 4Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of inhibitors of the 26 S proteasome on HIF-1α protein levels. Both a wide-specificity inhibitor, LLnL, and a highly specific lactacystin metabolite, clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, produced a dramatic accumulation of HIF-1α already under normoxic conditions. In agreement with these observations, it has recently been reported that similar proteasome inhibitors induce the DNA binding activity of the HIF-1α·Arnt complex in normoxic cells (25Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Our experiments indicate that these elevated levels of DNA binding activity are specifically because of increased levels of HIF-1α protein, because Arnt levels were unaltered in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. Although the DNA binding activity of the HIF-1α·Arnt complex appears to be induced under conditions of proteasome inhibition (25Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar), this response did not correlate with activation of hypoxia response element-dependent reporter gene expression, suggesting that a nonfunctional form of HIF-1α is accumulated. Moreover, in excellent agreement with the lack of functional activity of HIF-1α upon stabilization by proteasome inhibition, our data indicate the failure of HIF-1α to accumulate in the nucleus of hypoxic cells in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. Taken together, these data strongly argue that polyubiquitinated forms of HIF-1α that are generated in the presence of proteasome inhibitors are nonfunctional. To address the possible involvement of polyubiquitination in targeting HIF-1α for destruction, we used an in vivo assay (13Treier M. Staszevski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) where, upon transient expression of affinity-tagged ubiquitin, target proteins can be isolated using an affinity resin. Employing this assay in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor to prevent rapid destruction of the conjugated complexes, HIF-1α was effectively copurified in the presence of histidine-tagged ubiquitin. This effect was selective for HIF-1α because no immunoreactivity was detected in the absence of either His-tagged ubiquitin or proteasome inhibitors. Furthermore, the finding that HIF-1α is multiubiquitinated under normoxia may be of potential importance, because it has been demonstrated that not all proteins targeted to the 26 S proteasome are ubiqutinated; it has rather been shown that proteasome may have a more general function in selective removal of short-lived proteins by recognizing degradation signals other than ubiquitin (26Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 587-599Crossref Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Interestingly, exposure of cells to an hypoxia-mimicking agent simultaneously with the proteasome inhibitors resulted in marked reduction of ubiquitin-bound HIF-1α, which correlated with elevated cellular protein levels. Thus, as outlined in the model in Fig.7, HIF-1α is differentially regulated by ubiquitination in normoxia as opposed to hypoxia, and inhibition of ubiquitination constitutes an early and critical step in regulation of HIF-1α function preceding nuclear translocation, recruitment of Arnt, and ensuing gene activation. Our present experiments indicate that regulation of HIF-1α protein levels by the proteasome pathway were mediated by a C-terminal structure of the protein spanning a PEST sequence motif (21Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the same region of HIF-1α has been shown to harbor the N-terminal transactivation domain of HIF-1α and has thus been implicated to be involved in conditional regulation of HIF-1α function (19Pugh C.W. O'Rourke J.F. Nagao M. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11205-11214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 20Jiang B.-H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Thus, these data illustrate the very complex functional architecture of the C terminus of HIF-1α. In agreement with the present results, the identification of a broadly defined oxygen-dependent degradation domain between residues 401 and 603 was reported during the completion of this study (27Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). What is the degradation motif (or motifs) within this C-terminal region of HIF-1α and what is the nature of the signal and mechanism that renders the degradation process inactive during hypoxic conditions? Transplantable sequence elements, destruction boxes, recognized and targeted by a proteolytic apparatus have been identified in many short-lived proteins (28Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 1024-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but despite this, the structural features characterizing these elements are largely unknown. Against this background, HIF-1α provides an interesting model system to understand regulation of protein function by protein degradation. In particular, it will be important to investigate how the process of HIF-1α protein stabilization is related to the mechanism of conditional regulation of HIF-1α function.

We have generated additional transgenic mouse strains, expressing human APP, either wild type or the London or Swedish clinical mutations, from the neuron-specific mouse thy-1 gene promoter. Their phenotype was analyzed by biochemical, histochemical, behavioral, electrophysiological, and pharmacological methods. Measurements of different APP metabolites in brain demonstrated that increased Aβ(42) levels correlated with the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain of old APP/London transgenic mice. The plaques were extensively characterized immunohistochemically and displayed many aspects typically observed in the brain of AD patients. As opposed to plaques that developed only after at least 12 months of age, other deficits were observed from 3 months onwards and included cognitive impairment, decreased long term potentiation, differential glutamatergic responses, aggression, and neophobia, among others. These signs were largely independent of the actual isoform or mutant of APP that was expressed, were not correlated with a single APP metabolite, and are dissociated in time from plaque formation. These mice will be good models to study both early and late, neuropathological, and clinical aspects related to Alzheimer's disease. cDNA coding for human wild type APP (695 isoform), the Swedish (K670N,M671L) mutant (770 isoform), and the London (V642I) mutant (695 isoform) were cloned in the pTSC vector in the mouse thy-1 gene (16Moechars D. Lorent K. De Strooper B. Dewachter I. Van Leuven F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The purified, linearized minigenes were microinjected into prenuclear embryos from superovulated FVB/N females. Rabbit antisera B11/4 and B12/4, generated against a synthetic peptide representing the 20 C-terminal residues of APP, react equally well with human and mouse APP C-terminal stubs (20De Strooper B. Simons M. Multhaup G. Van Leuven F. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4932-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Antibodies FCA18, FCA3340, and FCA3542 were generated against synthetic peptides (21Barelli H. Lebeau A. Vizzavona J. Delaere P. Chevallier N. Drouot C. Marambaud P. Ancolio K. Buxbaum J.D. Khorkova O. Heroux J. Sahasrabudhe S. Martinez J. Warter J.-M. Mohr M. Checler F. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 695-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following commercially available antibodies were used: SMI31 (Affiniti); anti-GFAP, anti-synaptophysin, and anti-ubiquitin (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark); mAb 22C11 and anti-MAP-2 (Boehringer Mannheim); and mAb 1G5 (Athena Neurosciences, San Francisco, CA). Mouse brain RNA was analyzed by Northern blotting (16Moechars D. Lorent K. De Strooper B. Dewachter I. Van Leuven F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Relative mRNA levels of transgene versus endogenous APP were quantified densitometrically after autoradiography. APP protein was analyzed by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation with the antibodies indicated. Total brain was homogenized in 15 volumes of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (Boehringer Mannheim) and cleared by centrifugation (100,000 ×g, 1 h, 4 °C). The pellet was re-extracted with the same buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, 2% Nonidet P40 and centrifuged as before. Proteins were denatured and reduced (2% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 95 °C, 5 min), separated on polyacrylamide gels (4–20% Tris-glycine), and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Hybond-C, Amersham) for Western blotting (16Moechars D. Lorent K. De Strooper B. Dewachter I. Van Leuven F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). C-terminal fragments were immunoprecipitated with rabbit antiserum B11/4, separated on 10–20% Tris-tricine gels, and detected by Western blotting with B12/4 (1/1000) and ECL detection. Mouse brain was homogenized in 6.5 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, with 5 mmEDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mg/ml phenanthroline, and 0.1 mg/ml benzamidine. The homogenate was cleared (135,000 ×g, 1 h, 4 °C and 220,000 × g, 2 h, 4 °C) and concentrated on Sepak C18 cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA). Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Aβ(40) and Aβ(42) peptides used mAb 1101.1 to capture and rabbit antiserum BA#1 and mAb 108.1, respectively, as detecting antibodies (22Higgins L.S. Holzmann D.M. Rabin J. Mobley W.C. Cordell B. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 35: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Behavioral tests were performed conforming with the Society of Animal Experimentation policy. Corner crossing and aggression tests were described (16Moechars D. Lorent K. De Strooper B. Dewachter I. Van Leuven F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was by Student's t test (α = 0.05) and two-way analysis of variance. F1 offspring of matings of transgenic FVB/N males with C57/Bl6 females were tested. The pool (a white, circular vessel 1 m in diameter) contained water at 20 °C with titaniumoxide as an odorless, nontoxic additive to hide the escape platform. Swimming of each mouse was videotaped and analyzed (Poly-Track, San Diego Instruments, CA). Prior to place navigation tests all mice were allowed a forced swim test for a 120 s period. For place navigation tests, mice were trained to locate the hidden platform in seven blocks of three trials over 4 consecutive days. For different subjects the location of the platform was changed between the four quadrants. 24 h after the last training, each animal was tested (probe trial) with the platform removed. Mice were allowed to search for 60 s and quadrant search time and crossings of the original platform position were measured. The same mice were tested 18 days later for cue navigation tests (platform marked with visible cylinder), and platform location was changed over the four quadrants. Statistical analysis of variance was by one- and two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures and post-hoc analysis for variable escape latency by Student's ttest. Hippocampal slices were studied in an artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 26 mm NaHCO3, 1.24 mm KH2PO4, 2.4 mmCaCl2, 1.3 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm glucose and bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Slices were cut transversally (400 μm) in cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid and kept at room temperature till placed in the interface recording chamber at 30 °C. Experiments started 3 h 30 min after dissection to allow recovery of the slice, and the chamber was perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (1 ml/min). A monopolar platinum microelectrode was used to stimulate Schaffer collaterals, and evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region with low resistance (2 megohm) glass microelectrodes filled with 2m NaCl. Test stimuli were biphasic pulses of 0.1 ms every 30 s. Tetanus-induced long term potentiation was by two pulse trains of 1 s at 100-Hz, separated by 20 s with each pulse of 0.2 ms. Intensity was adjusted to obtain responses with amplitudes of about 30% of maximal response. The slope of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (mV/ms) was measured from the average wave form from four consecutive responses. NMDA and KA, dissolved in pyrogen free 0.9% sodium chloride solution, were injected intraperitoneal in 3–4-month-old mice. The mice were observed for 2 h to determine LD50 by NMDA, while seizures induced by KA were scored in seven stages: lethargy, rigid posture, head bobbing or circling, clonic seizure, rearing alone or with falling, tonic-clonic seizures, and death (16Moechars D. Lorent K. De Strooper B. Dewachter I. Van Leuven F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Mice were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were fixed overnight at 4 °C, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. Histological staining by hematoxylin-eosin, cresyl-violet, or silver impregnation were by routine procedures (24Garvey W. Fathi A. Bigelow F. Jimenez C.L. Carpenter B.F. J. Histotechnol. 1991; 14: 39-42Crossref Google Scholar). For immunohistochemistry, sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, and endogenous peroxidase quenched with hydrogen peroxide (1% in 50% methanol). After 1 h in blocking buffer (10% goat serum in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), appropriately diluted primary antibody was applied (overnight at room temperature). Following rinsing, peroxidase or biotin-conjugated secondary antibody was applied (1:300, 1 h), and the latter was followed by streptavidin-peroxidase. Immunoprecipitates were stained with diaminobenzidine/H2O2. For immunostaining for APP and synaptophysin, silanated slides were microwaved in 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 6 (8 min, 450 W). AT-8 staining was performed on free floating vibratome sections. Microglia staining was performed by incubation with biotinylated tomato lectin, followed by streptavidin-peroxidase and staining with diaminobenzidine/H2O2. Wild type APP (APP/Wt) and London and Swedish mutant APP (APP/Ld and APP/Sw, respectively) were expressed in the brain of transgenic FVB/N mice by the mouse thy-1 gene promoter (16Moechars D. Lorent K. De Strooper B. Dewachter I. Van Leuven F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The 13 independent transgenic lines expressed transgene mRNA at moderate to high levels (Fig.1). In all lines the human APP protein was expressed in hippocampus and in parietal and frontal cortex (levels two to five times higher than endogenous APP), with lower levels in olfactory bulb and thalamus (about 65 and 30%) and very low in cerebellum (results not shown). APP intermediates analyzed in the brain of heterozygous transgenic mice, aged between 2 and 4 months, included the integral membrane-bound APP, the secreted α-cleaved and total secreted APP, the residual C-terminal fragments (stubs), and the soluble Aβ(40) and Aβ(42) peptides. In APP/Sw transgenic mice, α-cleaved APP was 5-fold lower than in APP/Wt mice (Fig. 2). The β-cleaved C-terminal fragments were most pronounced in APP/Sw and APP/Ld transgenic mice (Fig. 2). When normalized for expression level, a 3–5-fold overproduction of β-cleaved C-terminal fragments was evident in line APP/Sw/1 relative to all other transgenic lines (Fig.2, right column). Absolute levels of soluble Aβ(40) peptide correlated most closely with levels of β-cleaved C-terminal stubs (Fig. 2), whereas normalization highlighted their preponderant formation in APP/Sw mice. Measurements by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated that Aβ(42) peptide levels were high only in the brain of APP/Ld mice (Fig. 2). These data essentially confirm the known metabolic effects of mutations in APP,i.e. the Swedish mutation specifically favored β-cleavage, resulting in increased concentrations of β-cleaved C-terminal fragments and of Aβ(40) peptide, whereas the London mutation not only produced β-cleaved C-terminal stubs but produced most conspicuously Aβ(42) peptides. The APP transgenic mice died prematurely (16Moechars D. Lorent K. De Strooper B. Dewachter I. Van Leuven F.

We monitored 136 heterozygous mice from six APP transgenic strains and 46 nontransgenic littermates for 1 year. This revealed that only 4.3% of nontransgenic mice died, as opposed to between 21 and 72% of APP transgenic mice (TableI). Mortality increased with increased APP expression as reported before (16Moechars D. Lorent K. De Strooper B. Dewachter I. Van Leuven F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Premature death was absent in other transgenic strains housed in identical conditions and overexpressing transgenes unrelated to APP at comparable protein levels using the same promoter.Table IOverview of different transgenic APP mouse lines with some characteristicsMini-geneFoundersLinesRNA levelsMortality180360APP/Wt4APP/Wt/2623.553.3APP/Wt/4959.168.4APP/Sw3APP/Sw/1747.170.6APP/Sw/345.421.6APP/Ld6APP/Ld/22572.2NDAPP/Ld/61036.0NDTabulation of transgenic founders generated from different mini-genes and transgenic lines analyzed in detail for relative expression levels (RNA levels) and mortality in the different APP transgenic lines after a 180- or 360-day period.

Offspring developed and behaved normally for 6–8 weeks after birth. APP/Ld transgenic mice with the highest expression levels began to show increased agitation from 8 weeks onwards. Progressively, more mice of both sexes in this and other APP transgenic strains displayed this behavior, which was absent in nontransgenic littermates housed and handled in identical conditions. Indications for increased incidence of spontaneous seizures were also noted in the current human APP transgenic mice (16Moechars D. Lorent K. De Strooper B. Dewachter I. Van Leuven F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Spontaneous seizures are clearly not an early phenomenon and were observed in less than 15% of APP transgenic mice older than 6 months. Systematic observation and attempts to obtain encephalographic recordings of epileptic activity proved the rare nature of this phenomenon. 2J. Noebbels, personal communication. Many APP transgenic mice showed transient cessation of locomotion upon routine transfer to a new cage. This behavior was systematically approached by measuring motor activity in a corner-crossing variant of the open field test (14Hsiao K.K. Borchelt D.R. Olson K. Johannsdottir R. Kitt C. Yunis W.

In nontransgenic mice, independent of age, corner crossing behavior was distributed in a gaussian fashion around a mean of about seven crossings in 30 s (Fig.3 and TableII). All APP transgenic mice were significantly reduced in ambulation, which became progressively more evident with age. Statistical analysis of the most extensively studied APP/Sw/1 mice (Fig. 3 and Table II) was typical for the other transgenic strains; the decrease in ambulation is related to genetic status and age, with a significant interaction of both independent variables (see legend to Fig. 3). Age was determinant in all transgenic strains, except in the highest expressing APP/Ld/2 transgenic mice, which showed already minimal ambulation even before 3 months old (TableII). In these young APP/Ld/2 transgenic mice, also the second index of motor activity measured, i.e. posture freezing induced by the new environment, was already maximal at 3 months, as opposed to all other APP transgenic mice, in which posture freezing frequency increased with age (Table II). Reduced ambulation reflected a neophobic response and not a motor impairment or lack of exploratory motivation, because this behavior was transient and the mice were normally active in the cued variant of the water maze paradigm and the forced swim test (see below).Table IICorner crossing test4–9 weeks12–17 weeks20–52 weeksnCorners ± S.E.FreezingnCorners ± S.E.FreezingnCorners ± S.E.Freezing%%%Nontransgenic1336.8 ± 0.20.0486.7 ± 0.40.0396.9 ± 0.42.6APP/Wt/4185.2 ± 0.7aP < 0.05.11.184.3 ± 1.0aP < 0.05.12.5162.0 ± 0.9bP < 0.01.33.3APP/Sw/1766.5 ± 0.30.0504.6 ± 0.5bP < 0.01.14.0733.3 ± 0.3bP < 0.01.23.3APP/Ld/2421.4 ± 0.3bP < 0.01.47.6NDNDND121.3 ± 0.5bP < 0.01.50.0APP/Ld/6144.4 ± 0.8bP < 0.01.7.1192.3 ± 0.6bP < 0.01.26.3140.9 ± 0.4bP < 0.01.57.1Tabulation of the locomotor activity of transgenic APP mice as an index for the neophobic reaction is shown as the average number of corners crossed (mean ± S.E.) and posture freezing expressed as a percentage of all mice.

The functional repercussion of expression of the APP transgenes on cognitive processes was measured in the Morris water maze paradigm. Because FVB/N mice are not optimal for this test (Ref. 23Smith D.J. Stevens M.E. Sudanagunta S.P. Bronson R.T. Makhinson M. Watabe A.M. Fung J. Weier H.U. Cheng J.F. Rubin E.M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar and references therein), we generated F1 hybrid mice from male transgenic mice and female C57/Bl6 mice. This offered the important additional advantage that the genotyped nontransgenic and transgenic littermates constitute perfectly matched experimental groups. Data for heterozygous transgenic mice, aged between 3 and 6 months, of lines APP/Wt/4 and APP/Ld/2 were most intensely studied and are presented, because both of these transgenic lines presented similar early phenotypic traits but differed most prominently in amyloid plaque formation later in life (see “Brain Histology and Immunohistochemistry”). Both in place and in cue navigation tests, nontransgenic F1 mice learned to rapidly locate and escape upon the platform with stable terminal acquisition latency of less than 12 s (place navigation: F(6,497) = 48.3, p < 0.001; cue navigation: F(6,497) = 14.18, p < 0.001). Transgenic littermates of lines APP/Wt/4 and APP/Ld/2 were less apt, and although they improved with training (APP/Wt/4: F(6,392) = 20.0,p < 0.001; APP/Ld/2: F(6,476) = 20.0,p < 0.001), they remained significantly impaired in the place navigation test. The overall escape latency, an estimate of spatial learning and memory capacity, was significantly longer for transgenic as opposed to nontransgenic littermates (Fig.4 A). Statistical comparison by two-way analysis of variance of the performances of APP/Wt/4 and of APP/Ld/2 versus their respective nontransgenic F1 littermates explained the difference in escape latency by genetic status (APP/Wt/4: F(1,127) = 26.7, p < 0.001; APP/Ld/2: F(1,139) = 87.21, p < 0.001) and by blocks (F(6,123) = 42.9, p < 0.001 and F(6,135) = 22.4,p < 0.001) with a significant interactive effect of these independent variables (APP/Wt/4: F(6,123) = 2.5,p < 0.05; APP/Ld/2: F(6,135) = 3.4, p< 0.01). The impairment in escape latency was not observed when the same transgenic mice were tested to locate the platform visually (cued) rather than from spatial memory (Fig. 4 A). This important demonstration of normal motivation to escape and of swimming ability was independently confirmed by a forced swim test (Fig. 4 B). The magnitude of the spatial deficit was assessed in a probe test, conducted 24 h after the place navigation test. Nontransgenic F1 mice (F(1,94) = 104.4, p < 0.001) and transgenic APP/Wt/4 mice (F(1,69) = 14.5, p < 0.001) and APP/Ld/2 mice (F(1,90) = 23.9, p < 0.001) searched the correct quadrant (Fig. 4 C), confirming that all mice exhibited spatial learning capabilities. The spatial deficit was confirmed by the significant decreased time spent in the correct quadrant by the transgenic APP/Wt/4 mice (F(1,39) = 3.0, p < 0.01) and APP/Ld/2 mice (F(1,45) = 3.5, p < 0.05) relative to their nontransgenic F1 littermates. A more refined parameter for the spatial bias in the place navigation test is the number of crossings over the exact former location of the platform (26Abeliovich A. Paylor R. Chen C. Kim J.J. Wehner J.M. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1263-1271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Nontransgenic F1 mice crossed the correct site significantly more often than their transgenic littermates of line APP/Wt/4 (F(1,41) = 15.75,p < 0.001) and APP/Ld/2 (F(1,45) = 18.52,p < 0.001) (Fig. 4 D). In conclusion, these combined results obtained in the Morris water maze paradigm demonstrated unequivocally that the APP transgenic mice were markedly cognitively impaired already early in life. Memory and learning is dependent on changes in the efficiency of synaptic transmission. An excellent and widely used model for this type of plasticity is long term potentiation. Synaptic potentiation was induced in the CA1 in hippocampal slices of 5–7-month-old APP/Ld/2 mice and age-matched nontransgenic littermates, by applying a tetanic stimulus, activating the Schaffer collaterals. There was no significant modification of the degree of short term potentiation in the first 2 min following the stimulation in transgenic mice (207.7 ± 26.5 S.E.) compare"
https://openalex.org/W2051271802,"P2X receptors are a distinct family of ligand-gated ion channels activated by extracellular ATP. Each of the seven identified subunit proteins (P2X1 through P2X7) has been reported to form functional homo-oligomeric channels when expressed in heterologous systems. Functional studies of native receptors, together with patterns of subunit gene expression, suggest that hetero-oligomeric assembly among members of this family may also occur. This prediction is supported by reports describing hetero-oligomeric assembly for three different recombinant subunit combinations. In this report, we systematically examined the ability of all members of the P2X receptor family to interact using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. The seven P2X receptor subunits were differentially epitope-tagged and expressed in various combinations in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. It was found that six of the seven subunits formed homo-oligomeric complexes, the exception being P2X6. When co-assembly between pairs of subunits was examined, all were able to form hetero-oligomeric assemblies with the exception of P2X7. Whereas P2X1, P2X2, P2X5, and P2X6 were able to assemble with most subunits, P2X3 and P2X4presented a more restricted pattern of co-association. These results suggest that hetero-oligomeric assembly might underlie functional discrepancies observed between P2X responses seen in the native and recombinant settings, while providing for an increased diversity of signaling by ATP.

These results suggest that hetero-oligomeric assembly might underlie functional discrepancies observed between P2X responses seen in the native and recombinant settings, while providing for an increased diversity of signaling by ATP. Investigation of the native receptors mediating extracellular ATP signaling in tissues has been a difficult task due to the lack of useful pharmacological tools. For this reason, the cloning of ATP receptors (the P2 receptor family) and their recombinant expression has proven extremely useful in elucidating the basic properties of these proteins and for providing a template for further study into native P2 receptors. Two families of proteins mediating the actions of ATP have been identified: the metabotropic G protein-coupled P2Y receptors and the ionotropic P2X receptors (1Fredholm B.P. Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Daly J.W. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Leff P. Williams M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 143-156PubMed Google Scholar). The P2X receptors are nonselective ion channels thought to be oligomeric in nature, and they are expressed in many excitable and nonexcitable cells, where they mediate a variety of physiological actions, including smooth muscle contractility, neuroendocrine secretion, and modulation of synaptic transmission (2Burnstock G. Ciba Found. Symp. 1996; 198: 1-34PubMed Google Scholar,3Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, recent reports suggest that they may also play an important role in the transmission of pain perception (4Cook S.P. Vulchanova L. Hargreaves K.M. Elde R. McCleskey E.W. Nature. 1997; 387: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 5Bardoni R. Goldstein P.A. Lee C.J. Gu J.G. MacDermott A.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5297-5304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With the molecular identification of seven P2X receptor subunits, our understanding of the biophysical and pharmacological properties of these channels has been considerably increased. However, relatively little is known about the multimeric organization of this new class of channel receptors. Almost all known ionotropic receptors exist as hetero-oligomers (6Barnard E.A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 368-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Importantly, their functional and pharmacological properties are directly determined by their subunit composition, with different subunit combinations yielding different phenotypes (e.g. see 7). This complexity appears to allow for diversity in signaling, and it therefore becomes material to determine whether each of the seven P2X receptor subunits is capable of co-assembling into hetero-oligomeric complexes as well. Studies using recombinant expression of individual subunits provide some evidence suggesting that in certain tissues, the native P2X response could be due to homo-oligomeric receptors (e.g. the P2X1 receptor and the P2X receptor found in the vas deferens) (8Valera S. Hussy N. Evans R.J. Adami N. North R.A. Suprenant A. Buell G. Nature. 1994; 371: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 9Khakh B. Surprenant A. Humphrey P.P.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 115: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a P2X receptor phenotype seen in dorsal root sensory neurons appears to be the result of a hetero-oligomer containing P2X2 and P2X3subunits (4Cook S.P. Vulchanova L. Hargreaves K.M. Elde R. McCleskey E.W. Nature. 1997; 387: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 10Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Additional evidence supporting the possible presence of hetero-oligomeric P2X receptors comes from Northern blot, in situ hybridization, and immunocytochemical studies that suggest that cell populations in a variety of tissues may express multiple subunit genes (11Vulchanova L. Riedl M.S. Shuster S.J. Buell G. Surprenant A. North R.A. Elde R. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1229-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 12Collo G. North R.A. Kawashima E. Merlo-Pich E.

Neidhart S. Kawashima E. Kosco-Vilbois M. North R.A. Buell G. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1277-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). If heteromultimerization is a common occurrence in the native setting, as each of the seven subunit proteins has a distinctive biophysical and pharmacological profile, then it becomes important to identify which subunits are capable of forming hetero-oligomeric assemblies and in which combinations. This is especially true if the hetero-oligomeric nature of such combinations is masked by the ability of a single subunit type to dominate the phenotype of the complex, a phenomenon seen in other ionotropic receptor families. If such a dominance was exhibited, it could be misleading, as it might affect only the obvious biophysical phenotype but not any underlying developmental and/or regulatory mechanism(s) and would thus prevent a more complete understanding of the physiological significance of ATP transmission via that hetero-oligomer. In order to address the question of subunit co-assembly for the P2X family, we tested for protein-protein interactions among members using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. We present here direct biochemical evidence for the preferential association between some but not all P2X subunits. This knowledge is essential not only in guiding studies to determine the molecular identities of endogenous P2X receptors, but also for understanding the molecular basis of interactions between the different subunits. The cDNAs for P2X1 and P2X3 were cloned from a rat heart library (kind gift of Dr. M. Tamkun, Vanderbilt University), and those for P2X4, P2X6, and P2X7 were cloned from a directional rat brain library in λZAP. The cDNAs encoding the P2X2 and P2X5 subunits were the kind gifts of Drs. D. Julius (University of California, San Francisco, CA) and G. Buell (Glaxo Research Institute, Geneva, Switzerland), respectively. Oligonucleotide primers (Life Technologies, Inc.) were designed to introduce the FLAG (DYKDDDDK) or the HA 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; HEK 293, human embryonic kidney 293. (YPYDVPDYA) epitopes into the carboxyl termini of all P2X receptor subunits, immediately upstream of the stop codon. The P2X7 deletion mutant (P2X7(K419*) (asterisk indicates the stop codon)) was created by inserting the FLAG epitope immediately after amino acid 418 and replacing the lysine at amino acid position 419 with a stop codon by site-directed mutagenesis. All tagged P2X coding sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) as described previously (17Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pRK-5 (18Schall T.J. Lewis M. Koller K. Lee A. Rice G.C. Wong G.H.W. Gatanaga T. Raab H. Kohr W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1990; 61: 361-370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing with the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method utilizing the deaza-T7 Sequenase kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with epitope-tagged P2X receptor cDNAs individually or in different combinations. Cells were incubated with 1 μg of total cDNA and 6 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 1 ml of serum-free medium (Opti-MEM, Life Technologies, Inc.). After 5 h at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with complete minimal essential medium, and cells were incubated for 40–48 h. Whole cell current was recorded from single HEK 293 cells using AxoPatch 200 series amplifiers (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and low resistance electrodes (1–2 MΩ). The typical holding voltage was −40 mV, at which the effect of ATP was generation of an inward current. Recording pipettes were filled with the following intracellular solution (in mm): 150 CsCl, 10 tetraethylammonium-Cl, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3, with CsOH. The extracellular solution was as follows: 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, with NaOH. Drugs were applied by manually moving the electrode and attached cell into the line of flow of solutions exiting an array of inlet tubes. HEK 293 cells grown on 35-mm culture plates were scraped into 100 μl of sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer. Solubilized proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis through gels ranging from 8 to 14% polyacrylamide, followed by transfer to Hybond-ECL membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The filters were blocked overnight in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 145 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated for 1 h with primary antibody (M2 anti-FLAG (Kodak) at 10 μg/ml, or anti-HA (BABCo, Berkeley, CA) 1:1000). After several washes with a buffer of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 145 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dry milk, filters were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h. Filters were washed extensively (24–72 h) in the incubation buffer, and immunoreactive proteins were detected with the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's suggestions. Monolayers of HEK 293 cells in 35-mm dishes that had been transfected with the indicated cDNAs were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h in solubilization buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride-HCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) containing the indicated detergent. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using either the M2 anti-FLAG antibody (5 μg/ml) or the anti-HA antibody (1:500) in the presence of 50 μl of protein G Gamma-Bind agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with solubilization buffer and resuspended in protein sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min, and proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose filters. These blots were then treated as described for the Western blots. P2X receptors are nonselective cation channels gated by ATP. Current thinking is that in order to form a transmembrane ion-conducting pore, ionotropic receptors must be oligomeric proteins. Such oligomers can be either homo- or hetero-oligomeric in nature. As a first step into investigating the assembly of P2X subunits, we wanted to determine whether each of the subunit proteins could indeed form homo-oligomers. To test this hypothesis, we utilized a co-immunoprecipitation assay in which the same subunit was differentially epitope-tagged and the resulting two constructs were co-transfected into HEK 293 cells. Subsequently, one subunit was immunoprecipitated using the appropriate anti-tag antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by Western blot to determine whether the subunit tagged with the other epitope was also present. A positive result would indicate that co-assembly had occurred. Therefore, we tagged all seven cloned subunits at their C terminus with either the FLAG or HA epitopes, resulting in a total of 14 different constructs. The use of epitope tags allowed for the unequivocal detection of specific proteins that were of the same or similar size. To ensure that these epitope-tagged subunits retained their structural and functional integrity so that the co-assembly results could be interpreted with confidence, whole-cell currents elicited by ATP in cells transfected with the various constructs were measured. As seen in Fig. 1, 12 of the 14 tagged P2X subunits were functional and gave ATP-induced currents with kinetic properties similar to their wild-type parents. In contrast to this was a complete lack of activity from any of the P2X6 constructs, even the wild-type. We have consistently failed to observe functional P2X6 receptors in transfected HEK 293 cells, and this is in keeping with results reported by two other groups as well (19Le K.T. Babinski K. Seguela P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7152-7159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Soto F. Garcia-Guzman M. Karschin C. Stuhmer W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To provide direct evidence that each P2X subunit can undergo homo-oligomeric assembly, the FLAG and HA tagged cDNAs for each of the P2X1–3and P2X5–7 subunits were co-transfected as pairs. We then immunoprecipitated one subunit (for instance, P2X1·FLAG) and determined whether its cognate subunit (P2X1·HA) was present in the immunoprecipitate by Western blot. All proteins expressed robustly and at qualitatively equivalent levels when expressed in HEK 293 cells, with the exception of P2X4. Both the FLAG and HA tagged P2X4 constructs gave protein levels that were remarkably higher (more than 10 times higher) than those of the other tagged P2X subunits. This high level of expression lead to the appearance of nonspecific interactions, as demonstrated byin vitro mixing experiments (see below). This factor required that a slightly altered approach to investigating P2X4 co-assembly be used, and for this reason, the P2X4 data are not described here but in a section presented under “Results.” The validity of using the co-immunoprecipitation approach to study subunit co-assembly was demonstrated by the fact that simply mixing lysates from cells individually transfected with each subunit did not result in their co-immunoprecipitation (Fig.2, left lane in each subunit panel). In addition, when any two tagged subunits were co-immunoprecipitated from co-transfected cells, their association was found to be resistant to strong solubilizing conditions such as 1% Triton with 500 mm NaCl, or 5% Triton, as is shown for P2X1 in Fig. 2 A. These results from the mixing and co-transfection experiments demonstrated that tagged subunits could be efficiently and selectively immunoprecipitated only by their respective anti-tag antibody and that no detectable cross-reactivity was found between the two antibodies. As Fig. 2 B illustrates, the P2X2, P2X3, P2X5, and P2X7 subunits did form homo-oligomeric assemblies. P2X6, the subunit that failed to give ATP-induced currents in transfected cells, did not form homo-oligomeric complexes (Fig. 2 C, left panel). This lack of co-immunoprecipitation is not due to low protein levels, as the P2X6·FLAG protein is present on the blot and the P2X6·HA protein is present in the supernatant of precipitation reaction (Fig. 2 C, right panel). These findings suggest that P2X6 subunits do not assemble into homo-oligomers and that this failure underlies the inability of the P2X6 cDNA to provide ATP-gated currents in our transfected HEK 293 cells. Because the results obtained above demonstrated the homo-oligomeric association of the various P2X receptor subunits, we wanted to next examine whether different P2X subunits could co-assemble into hetero-oligomers when co-expressed in HEK 293 cells. To test this, we co-transfected different pairs of P2X·FLAG/P2X·HA subunits and examined their ability to interact with each other using the co-immunoprecipitation technique. Fig. 3 shows the results of co-immunoprecipitation experiments carried out from cells co-expressing P2X1·FLAG with P2X2·HA, or the converse pair, P2X1·HA and P2X2·FLAG. The detergent-solubilized membranes were immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody, and the resulting complexes were analyzed by Western blot using the anti-HA antibody. In both instances, both proteins were immunoprecipitated, suggesting that they had co-assembled into hetero-oligomers. These interactions were again resistant to relatively harsh solubilization conditions, including 1% Triton with 500 mm NaCl or 5% Triton. In addition, when the cells were transfected with the individual cDNAs, solubilized, and mixed together prior to the immunoprecipitation, such interactions were not detected. These results suggest that the co-assemblies were formed by specific and stable subunit-subunit interactions. We then tested the ability of all subunits to co-assemble in a pairwise fashion and the results are shown in Fig.4. When the possible partners for P2X1·FLAG were examined (Fig. 4 A), immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG antibody caused co-precipitation of HA-tagged P2X3, P2X5, and P2X6 subunits but not the HA-tagged P2X7 receptor subunit. We then tested the ability of P2X2·FLAG to interact with P2X3·HA through P2X7·HA (Fig.4 B). Consistent with the findings of Radford et al. (21Radford K.M. Virginio C. Surprenant A. North R.A. Kawashima E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6529-6533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG (P2X2) antibody caused co-precipitation of P2X3-HA. In addition, P2X2·FLAG co-precipitated with P2X5·HA, and P2X6·HA but failed to interact with P2X7·HA. Immunoprecipitation of co-transfected cell lysates containing P2X3·FLAG resulted in the detection of P2X5·HA but not P2X6·HA or P2X7·HA (Fig. 4 C). Similarly, P2X5·FLAG co-precipitated with P2X6·HA, whereas neither P2X5·FLAG nor P2X6·FLAG associated with P2X7·HA (Fig. 4,D and E). The reverse experiments were also performed (i.e., immunoprecipitation with anti-HA and probing with anti-FLAG), and identical results were obtained. 2G. E. Torres, T. M. Egan, and M. M. Voigt, unpublished observation. All of these hetero-oligomeric interactions occurred only in co-transfected cells, and they were not detectable when lysates from cells expressing individual subunits were mixed and used for immunoprecipitation. In addition, as for the homo-oligomeric assemblies, these hetero-oligomeric co-assemblies were not disrupted by high concentration of salt or detergent.2These results demonstrate that most P2X receptor subunits are capable of forming specific and stable hetero-oligomeric assemblies when co-expressed in HEK 293 cells. The P2X4 protein presented a difficulty in the interpretation of the co-immunoprecipitation experiments. To begin with, we observed interaction between P2X4·FLAG and P2X4·HA even when lysates from cells transfected with either construct alone were combined prior to immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG antibody, as well as when co-transfected (Fig.5 A, left panel). This was a finding in marked contrast to our results with the other six P2X subunits. We found that nonspecific co-immunoprecipitation also occurred when lysates of P2X4·HA were mixed with those of the other FLAG-tagged subunits as well (e.g., with P2X1·FLAG, as shown in Fig. 5 A, right panel). Thus, it appeared that when P2X4·HA was the partner to be detected in the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, it formed nonspecific interactions with the other subunits present, and we surmised that these interactions were the result of having such high levels of P2X4 protein present in the cells. As a result, precipitating any of the FLAG-tagged subunits would invariably bring with it appreciable amounts of the P2X4·HA. For homo-oligomeric assembly, this would not be a problem as we already know that the P2X4 subunit forms functional homo-oligomeric receptors (Fig. 1). However, for investigating possible partners in hetero-oligomeric assembly, this would pose a problem. Thus, for this portion of the study we used P2X4·FLAG as the immunoprecipitation target and the HA-tagged versions of the other subunits as test partners. This approach seemed to circumvent the artifacts brought about by the high levels of P2X4 protein. As seen in Fig. 5 B, performing the immunoprecipitations with P2X4·FLAG and probing the blots with anti-HA, we found no detectable co-immunoprecipitations from the mixed lysates for any subunit. Immunoprecipitations from cells co-transfected with P2X4·FLAG together with any one of the HA-tagged subunits were then carried out. As seen in Fig. 5 B, no detectable interactions were observed for P2X4·FLAG and P2X1·HA, P2X3·HA, or P2X7·HA. Small amounts of P2X2·HA were detected in precipitates from co-transfected cells solubilized with 1% Nonidet P-40. However, no P2X2·HA was detected when solubilization was carried out under stronger conditions (1% Triton plus 500 mm NaCl, or 5% Triton), suggesting that the observed interactions in the 1% Nonidet P-40 were nonspecific in nature. In contrast to the above-mentioned subunits, P2X4·HA, P2X5·HA, and P2X6·HA gave strong signals when co-expressed with P2X4·FLAG, even when the harsher solubilization conditions were used. Thus, it appears that P2X4·FLAG co-assembles in a restricted fashion and only participates in forming stable assemblies with itself, P2X5·HA or P2X6·HA. Another striking finding from this study is the inability of P2X7 to form hetero-oligomeric assemblies. Because the main structural difference of the P2X7 receptor subunit is its long intracellular carboxyl terminus, we examined the possibility that the lack of association between P2X7 and the other P2X subunits was somehow due to an intrinsic property of that domain. We generated a deletion mutant (P2X7(K419*)), which was lacking the last 177 amino acid residues, and assayed for its ability to co-associate with several different P2X subunits. As shown in Fig. 6, the FLAG-tagged P2X7 deletion mutant generated functional channels similar to those of the wild-type cDNA (Fig. 6 A), was expressed at levels comparable to the other subunits, and could be efficiently immunoprecipitated when expressed in HEK 293 cells (Fig.6 B). Co-expression of P2X7(K419*)FLAG with P2X1·HA, P2X2·HA, or P2X3·HA did not result in their co-precipitation (Fig. 6 C). This lack of association was not due to lack of expression for the HA-tagged subunits, as these proteins were detectable in the reaction supernatant (Fig. 6 D). Thus, the lack of association between P2X7 and the other P2X subunits does not appear to involve the long intracellular tail of P2X7. Almost all ion channels assemble as hetero-oligomeric complexes in which different subunits associate to generate channels with unique functional properties, and this has been reported for three different pair-wise combinations of P2X subunits (10Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 19Le K.T. Babinski K. Seguela P. J.

Subunit composition has proved critical for the appropriate expression and function of other ion channels for particular tissue and/or cellular contexts. In the case of ligand-gated channels, including those for acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA, and glycine, it has been shown that the properties of the recombinant hetero-oligomeric assemblies correlate well with those described for the endogenous channels (7Barnard E.A.

This study is the first to investigate whether all known members of the P2X receptor subunit family can form homo- and hetero-oligomeric assemblies, properties that can have important influences on the characteristics of ATP signaling. Our biochemical results demonstrate that most P2X subunits are able to form homo-oligomeric assemblies consistent with the electrophysiological data obtained from recombinant P2X receptors in either HEK 293 cells or Xenopus oocytes. These protein-protein interactions were sufficiently strong to withstand receptor solubilization under conditions of high salt or detergent concentrations, and are present only when subunits are co-transfected into cells, suggesting that they are the result of specific co- or posttranslational processing mechanisms and not the result of random interactions within the plasma membrane per se. Of great interest was the lack of functional expression that we observed with the P2X6 receptor, an effect that appears to be explained by the inability of the P2X6 subunits to form homo-oligomeric assemblies as demonstrated by the lack of co-precipitation of P2X6·FLAG with P2X6·HA. Our findings are in contrast to the original report describing this subunit cDNA, in which HEK 293 cells were also used (12Collo G. North R.A. Kawashima E. Merlo-Pich E. Neidhart S. Surprenant A. Buell G. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2495-2507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but are in agreement with findings from two other laboratories that have examined expression using Xenopus oocytes (19Le K.T. Babinski K. Seguela P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7152-7159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Soto F. Garcia-Guzman M. Karschin C. Stuhmer W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This lack of assembly and function in our hands suggests the possibility that subtle differences in cell culturing (e.g., source of cells, passage number of cells used at time of transfection, or differences in media/sera) can influence other cellular factors that are involved in the assembly of this subunit into homo- but not hetero-oligomers. Such a factor(s) may provide an important target(s) for regulation of functional P2X receptor formation in different cell types and/or tissues. In situ hybridization studies suggest that different P2X receptor subunits are not only co-expressed in the same tissues but also may co-localize to the same cells (10Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 12Collo G. North R.A. Kawashima E. Merlo-Pich E. Neidhart S. Surprenant A. Buell G. J.

These findings raise the possibility that P2X receptor subunits might form hetero-oligomeric channel assemblies. In the present study, we have utilized a co-immunoprecipitation assay to examine whether the seven P2X receptor subunits can associate with one another, and if so, which combinations are productive in forming hetero-oligomeric assemblies. Our results demonstrate that hetero-oligomeric assembly can occur and that it does so in a preferential fashion. We provide direct biochemical evidence for the specific and detergent-stable association of a number of P2X subunit combinations, which are shown in TableI. In contrast, under similar conditions, we did not detect protein-protein interactions for P2X1/P2X4, P2X2/P2X4, P2X3/P2X4, or P2X3/P2X6, or for any combination containing P2X7 subunits. These findings of specific subunit-subunit interactions support the validity of using co-immunoprecipitations as a means of characterizing the co-assembly attributes of P2X subunits. The fact that P2X6 can co-assemble into hetero-oligomeric assemblies with many other subunits but not with itself suggests the possibility that P2X6 subunits might act in a regulatory role within hetero-oligomeric assemblies, similar to what has been shown for the β and γ subunits of the epithelial sodium channel (26Canessa C.M.

This lack of association does not seem to involve the long carboxyl terminus of P2X7 because a truncated form of this receptor subunit did not co-immunoprecipitate the P2X1·HA, P2X2·HA, or P2X3·HA subunits. These results suggest that P2X7 subunits preferentially form homo-oligomeric rather than hetero-oligomeric assemblies. Two recent studies of native preparations support our findings: a report by Tenneti et al. (28Tenneti L. Gibbons S.J. Talamo B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26799-26808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) identified two populations of ATP receptors in parotid acinar cells, the properties of which correlated well with those for homo-oligomeric P2X4 and P2X7, and Cario-Toumaniantz et al. (29Cario-Toumaniantz C. Loirand G. Ladoux A. Pcaud P. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) provide data suggesting that P2X1 and P2X7 receptors are expressed as separate homo-oligomeric populations in smooth muscle cells. Expansion from the biochemical experiments to functional studies is needed in order to determine the physiological significance of P2X subunit co-assembly. There are reports describing native receptors that do not match up well with the individual subunits expressed recombinantly, suggesting that hetero-oligomeric assembly might result in the generation of a novel phenotype. The first such study examining P2X co-assembly was for P2X2 and P2X3, which were shown to form a novel hetero-oligomeric channel when co-expressed in HEK 293 cells (10Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). This phenotype correlated well with the receptors described in some sensory neurons where the two proteins are co-expressed, suggesting that this process occurred in the native setting as well. Additional evidence for hetero-oligomeric assembly has appeared during the course of this study: Le et al. (19Le K.T. Babinski K. Seguela P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7152-7159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) provided functional evidence for a novel channel formed between epitope-tagged P2X4 and P2X6 subunits, and we reported that the co-expression of P2X1 and P2X5 subunits also resulted in a channel with a novel phenotype (22Torres G.T. Haines W.R. Egan T.E. Voigt M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 989-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For both pairs of subunits, there is a marked overlapping pattern of tissue distribution, suggesting that such combinations might be representative of native receptors (12Collo G. North R.A. Kawashima E. Merlo-Pich E. Neidhart S. Surprenant A. Buell G. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2495-2507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the data presented in this study provide a framework for expansion into the investigation of both recombinant and native hetero-oligomeric P2X receptor phenotypes. It cannot be presumed a priori that co-expression of two subunits will result in the generation of a novel receptor phenotype. This caveat is borne out when results from this study are taken in conjunction with those by Lewis et al. (10Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). In that study of P2X subunit co-expression, it was reported that co-transfection of P2X1/P2X2, P2X1/P2X4, and P2X3/P2X4 did not lead to the formation of receptors with novel phenotypes, a finding that was interpreted to mean that the subunits did not co-assemble. Although our results also provide evidence that P2X1/P2X4, and P2X3/P2X4 do not co-assemble, we found that the subunit pair P2X1/P2X2 did co-assemble. This finding, when taken together with the biophysical findings (10Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar), suggests that lack of a novel phenotype does not necessarily mean that two subunits are not interacting to form a hetero-oligomeric channel complex. An alternative explanation is that when two receptor subunits participate to form a complex, one subunit type can dominate the phenotype of the resulting channel, and thus only a single phenotype is observed. This phenomenon is readily observed in the ionotropic glutamate receptor family, where the presence of the GluR-B subunit dominates hetero-oligomeric receptor assemblies with regard to both rectification and calcium permeability properties (30Seeburg P.H. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Taking this point further, if it is the ratio of subunits in an assembly that determines the observed phenotype, and a mixed population of hetero-oligomeric receptor channels containing different ratios of the two subunits form after a co-transfection, then it is possible that two apparent populations of channels, resembling the homo-oligomeric parent receptors, would be detected. This is indeed what was observed by Lewiset al. (10Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) for the P2X1/P2X2combination. Even if there is no overt effect on the biophysical phenotype of a receptor, hetero-oligomeric assembly could still have important impact on receptor function; e.g., by altering the responsiveness of a complex to intracellular regulation or its domain targeting within a cell. As an attempt to understand how hetero-oligomeric assembly alters the functional properties of these channels, we are now investigating the functional consequences of the specific interactions derived from this study. Our biochemical data provide specific templates to start elucidating the subunit composition of endogenous P2X receptors. In addition, the specificity of the interactions among the members of the P2X receptor family should provide a useful tool in investigating the molecular determinants involved in hetero-oligomeric P2X receptor formation, results that could have applications beyond just these ATP-gated channels."
https://openalex.org/W2147627625,"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) include three receptor subtypes encoded by separate genes: PPARα, PPARδ, and PPARγ. PPARγ has been implicated as a mediator of adipocyte differentiation and the mechanism by which thiazolidinedione drugs exert in vivo insulin sensitization. Here we characterized novel, non-thiazolidinedione agonists for PPARγ and PPARδ that were identified by radioligand binding assays. In transient transactivation assays these ligands were agonists of the receptors to which they bind. Protease protection studies showed that ligand binding produced specific alterations in receptor conformation. Both PPARγ and PPARδ directly interacted with a nuclear receptor co-activator (CREB-binding protein) in an agonist-dependent manner. Only the PPARγ agonists were able to promote differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. In diabeticdb/db mice all PPARγ agonists were orally active insulin-sensitizing agents producing reductions of elevated plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations. In contrast, selectivein vivo activation of PPARδ did not significantly affect these parameters. In vivo PPARα activation with WY-14653 resulted in reductions in elevated triglyceride levels with minimal effect on hyperglycemia. We conclude that: 1) synthetic non-thiazolidinediones can serve as ligands of PPARγ and PPARδ; 2) ligand-dependent activation of PPARδ involves an apparent conformational change and association of the receptor ligand binding domain with CREB-binding protein; 3) PPARγ activation (but not PPARδ or PPARα activation) is sufficient to potentiate preadipocyte differentiation; 4) non-thiazolidinedione PPARγ agonists improve hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia in vivo; 5) although PPARα activation is sufficient to affect triglyceride metabolism, PPARδ activation does not appear to modulate glucose or triglyceride levels.

These findings provide further support for the role of PPARγ in regulation of adipocyte differentiation and modulation of insulin action. However, the relative ability of PPARα or PPARδ to exert similar physiologic effects has not been well characterized.Here, we report the identification and characterization of novel, non-TZD PPARγ and PPARδ agonists. The novel compounds differentially bound to and activated human PPARγ and PPARδ. Binding of these ligands altered receptor conformations and induced the association between the receptors and the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP). Only PPARγ agonists were able to potentiate adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. In diabetic db/dbmice, the novel PPARγ agonists served as orally active insulin-sensitizing agents that lowered both plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations. In contrast, in vivoexposure to a PPARδ-selective compound was not sufficient to affect glucose or triglyceride concentrations. Activation of PPARα produced a diminution in plasma triglycerides with minimal effects on glucose levels in db/db mice and failed to promote the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. These data strongly support the role of PPARγ as the predominant mediator of insulin sensitization by compounds that are agonists of this receptor.

Marin G. Staels B. Auwerx J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). PPARs regulate gene transcription by binding to specific direct repeat-1 response elements (peroxisome proliferator response elements) in enhancer sites of regulated genes. Each receptor binds to it's peroxisome proliferator response element as a heterodimer with a retinoid X receptor (RXR). Like other nuclear receptors, the ligand binding domain (LBD) of either PPARγ (2Berger J. Bailey P. Biswas C. Cullinan C.A. Doebber T.W. Hayes N.S. Saperstein R. Smith R.G.

Such changes in nuclear receptor conformation are thought to create a binding surface (dependent upon the COOH-terminal AF-2 domain) that results in the recruitment of one or more co-activator molecules and subsequent transcriptional activation.

CNC factors bind to MARE through heterodimer formation with small Maf proteins. We report here the identification and characterization of a novel CNC factor, Nrf3, encoding a predicted 73-kDa protein with a basic region-leucine zipper domain highly homologous to those of other CNC proteins. In vitro and in vivo analyses showed that Nrf3 can heterodimerize with MafK and that this complex binds to the MARE in the chicken β-globin enhancer and can activate transcription. Nrf3 mRNA is highly expressed in human placenta and B cell and monocyte lineage. Chromosomal localization of human Nrf3 is 7p14–15, which lies near the hoxAgene locus. As the genetic loci of p45, nrf1, andnrf2have been mapped close to those ofhoxC, hoxB, and hoxD, respectively, the present study strongly argues for the idea that a single ancestral gene for the CNC family members may have been localized near the ancestral Hox cluster and have diverged to give rise to four closely related CNC factors through chromosome duplication.

A homodimeric complex of small Maf proteins recognizes a DNA sequence motif called Maf recognitionelement (MARE, TGCTGA(G/C)TCAGCA or TGCTGACGTCAGCA), which contains either a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element (TGA(G/C)TCA) or cAMP-responsive element (TGACGTCA) (15Kataoka K.

Homodimeric complexes of small Mafs repress transcription through binding to MARE, since they lack canonical trans-activation domains. On the other hand, CNC proteins require a small Maf protein for their DNA binding activities. A CNC-small Maf heterodimer complex binds to both the NF-E2 consensus sequence (TGCTGA(G/C)TCA (T/C)) and MARE (in particular to the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element-type MARE). These regulatory motifs are frequently observed in the regulatory regions of erythroid-specific genes, such as the locus control region (LCR) of β-globin genes, as well as in several non-erythroid gene promoters (17Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the biological roles of the CNC family proteins,p45, nrf1 and nrf2 genes were disrupted individually (18Shivdasani R.A. Rosenblatt M.F. Zucker-Franklin D. Jakson C.W. Hunt P. Saris C.J.M.

The results of thenrf1 gene disruption are somewhat controversial; one report showed early embryonic lethality (19Farmer S.C. Sun C.-W. Winner G.E. Hogan B.L.M. Townes T.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 786-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), whereas another study showed loss of definitive hematopoiesis (23Chan J.Y. Kwong M. Lu R. Chang J. Wang B. Ten T.S.B. Kan Y.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). These results indicate that compensation among CNC family proteins may exist in erythroid-specific gene regulation and that lineage-specific regulation of gene expression through MAREs appears to be accomplished by multiple CNC family proteins. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses revealed that the chromosomal localization of the p45,nrf1, and nrf2 genes are mapped close to the hoxC (12q13.1–13.3), hoxB (17q21), andhoxD (2q31) gene clusters, respectively (24Chan J.Y. Cheung M.-C. Moi P. Chan K. Kan Y.W. Hum. Genet. 1995; 95: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting that the p45-related factors may be derived from a single ancestral gene through chromosome duplication, as is the case for thehox gene clusters. Since no CNC factor has been identified near the hoxA locus (7p14–15), this also implies the existence of an additional CNC factor. We report here the identification and characterization of this new CNC family member, Nrf3 (NF-E2 related factor3). Expressedsequence tag (EST) cDNA fragment for Nrf3 (THC181377) was isolated by PCR using genomic DNA of HeLa cells as a template. 30 cycles of PCR were performed at 94 °C for 30 s; 60 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 1 min. Primers used were 5′-GATATTTTTAGTAGATTAAGAGATGACC-3′ and 5′-GCACTTCATGAAAAAGTTGTGGC-3′. A human placenta λgt11 cDNA library (a generous gift from Dr. Shigeru Taketani, Kansai Medical University) was plated on 150-mm Petri dishes at a density of 5 × 104 plaque-forming units per plate, and 1 × 106 plaques were screened with labeled EST fragment (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To isolate mouse Nrf3, a mouse brain cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened using a 0.5-kbp HindIII fragment of human Nrf3 cDNA as a probe. Hybridization was carried out at 65 or 50 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mNaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Membranes were washed twice for 30 min at 65 °C in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS solution (human cDNA library screening) or 50 °C in 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS solution (mouse cDNA library screening). Positive plaques were isolated and purified. 5′-Rapid amplification of the cDNA end analyses were carried out with the MarathonTM cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). DNA sequences were determined on both strands by the dideoxynucleotide method using an ABI377 automated sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). NALL-1, NALM-6, BALM-2, NAMALWA, and RPMI8226 cells were gifts of Dr. Kenji Ohtani (Fujisaki Cell Center of Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories, Inc.), and KOPT-K1, THP6, and NALM-17 cells were gifts of Dr. Yasuhide Hayashi (University of Tokyo). MGS cells were a gift of Dr. Shinkichi Yokoyama (Yamagata University). KG-1, HL60, U937, and THP1 were obtained from Japanese Cancer Resources Bank. Poly (A)+ RNA samples from various cultured cell lines were prepared by the guanidine-acidified phenol chloroform method (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) and purified with oligotex (dT)30 column chromatography (Roche). RNA samples were electrophoretically separated on a 1.0% agarose gel containing 1.1m formaldehyde and transferred onto ZetaProbe membranes (Bio-Rad). RNA blots containing multiple human tissue RNAs were purchased from CLONTECH (2 μg of poly (A)+ RNA per sample). Radiolabeled probe was prepared from the 500-bp HindIII fragment of the human clone, SKhNrf3/1-1. BosNrf1, BosNrf2, and BosNrf3 were generated by subcloning the 2.6-kbp HindIII/XbaI fragment from pcDNAI/Neo-Nrf1 (11Toki T. Itoh J. Kitazawa J. Arai K. Hatakeyama K. Akasaka J. Igarashi K. Nomura N. Yokoyama M. Yamamoto M. Itoh E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the 2.6-kbp BamHI/XbaI fragment from pcDNAI/Neo-Nrf2 (11Toki T. Itoh J. Kitazawa J. Arai K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5332Crossref Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). The quail fibroblast cell line QT6 (28Moscovici C. Moscovici M.G. Jimenez H. Lai M.M.C. Hayman M.J. Vogt P.K. Cell. 1977; 11: 95-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and plated onto 24-well dishes (5 × 104 cells per well with 0.3 ml medium) 24 h before transfection by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (29Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). 10 ng of firefly luciferase (Luc) reporter plasmid, 50 ng of pENL (an internal control), and various combinations of effector plasmids were used (see figure legends). Luc reporter plasmids pRBGP2 and pRBGP4 were previously described (10Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). QT6 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline 12 h after transfection, fed with fresh media, and incubated for an additional 24 h. Luc activity was measured following the supplier's protocol (Promega) with a Biolumat luminometer (Berthold). Assays were performed in triplicate in independent transfection experiments, and the results were normalized with respect to pENL β-galactosidase activity. Expression plasmids of GADNrf1, GADNrf2, and GADNrf3 were generated by inserting the 2.6-kbpDraI/XbaI fragment from pcDNAI/Neo-Nrf1 (11Toki T. Itoh J. Kitazawa J. Arai K. Hatakeyama K. Akasaka J. Igarashi K. Nomura N. Yokoyama M. Yamamoto M. Itoh E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the 2.6-kbp BglII/XbaI fragment from pcDNAI/Neo-Nrf2 (11Toki T. Itoh J.

GBD-MafK was generated by subcloning the 1.0-kbpBamHI/HindIII fragment from pQE30-MafK (11Toki T. Itoh J. Kitazawa J. Arai K. Hatakeyama K. Akasaka J. Igarashi K. Nomura N. Yokoyama M. Yamamoto M.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) into the blunt-ended ClaI site of GBD-pCla which was created by inserting a ClaI linker (8-mer, 5′-catcgatg-3′) into the EcoRI site of GBT9. Saccharomyces cerevisiae SFY526 were transformed with several combinations of plasmids by the lithium acetate method. Measurement of β-galactosidase activity of transformants was performed as described (30Kobayashi A. Numayama-Tsuruta K. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). MBPNrf1, MBPNrf2, MBPNrf3, and MBPMafK were constructed by inserting 500-bp PCR-generatedBamHI/XbaI fragments from pcDNAI/Neo-Nrf1, pcDNAI/Neo-Nrf2, and SKhNrf3/1–1, and the 1.0-kbpBamHI/HindIII fragment from pQE30-MafK (11Toki T. Itoh J. Kitazawa J. Arai K. Hatakeyama K. Akasaka J. Igarashi K. Nomura N. Yokoyama M. Yamamoto M. Itoh E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) into appropriate sites of pMAL-C2 (New England Biolabs). Primers used were 5′-CGGGATCCAAAGGCAGCAAGGAGAAGCA-3′/SP6 primer (Nrf1), 5′-CGGGATCCCCATTCACAAAAGACAA-3′/SP6 primer (Nrf2), and 5′-CGGGATCCCAGAAGATAAGGAGTAGATA-3′/T3 primer (Nrf3). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. BL21(DE3) pLysS strain of E. coli was transformed with each expression vector and incubated overnight. Each culture was diluted 10-fold with fresh LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated for additional 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested 3 h after the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration 0.2 mm and mildly sonicated in extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Lysates were prepared by centrifugation at 5,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C and loaded on columns of amylose resin (New England Biolabs). The columns were washed with extraction buffer and subsequently with buffer B (20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 20 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Recombinant proteins were eluted with buffer B containing 10 mm maltose and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides encoding the chicken β-globin enhancer MARE sequence (5′-TCGCCCGAAAGGAGCTGACTCATGCTAGCCC-3′) were labeled with γ[32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. The reaction mixture contained 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 60 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 4 mm MgCl2, 25 μg of poly(dI-dC) and poly(dA-dT)/ml, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml, and 50 ng of purified proteins. The reactions were electrophoresed at 4 °C, 150 V on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE (45 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 45 mm borate, and 1.25 mm EDTA). Competition assays using various cold probes were performed as described previously (8Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). In off-rate kinetic experiments, EMSA reaction mixture was first incubated with radiolabeled probe at 37 °C for 5 min. After the addition of cold double-stranded oligonucleotides (560-fold molar excess), an aliquot of the mixture was taken and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at several time points (described in figure legend). Amounts of binding complexes were quantified by an imaging analyzer (Fuji BAS-2000). Metaphase spreads for FISH were prepared from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal human lymphocytes using a thymidine synchronization/deoxybromouridine release technique. Nrf3 cDNA was labeled by nick translation with biotin-16-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim). In situ hybridization was performed with the protocol of Inazawa et al. (32Inazawa J. Fukunaga R. Seto Y. Nakagawa H. Misawa S. Abe T. Nagata S. Genomics. 1991; 10: 1075-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, for hybridization, 200 ng of probe was added to 10 ml of a hybridization mixture containing 50% formamide, 2× SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 90 min. Slides were denatured in 70% formamide, 2× SSC at 72 °C for 3 min, dehydrated, and hybridized overnight in a moist chamber at 37 °C with the probe. The slides were washed in 50% formamide, 2× SSC and in 1× SSC at 37 °C for 10 min each, and then in 4× SSC at room temperature for 10 min. After washing, the slides were incubated with avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate at 37 °C for 50 min and then counterstained with DAPI in anti-fade solution. Analysis was carried out using an Olympus BX50-FLA fluorescence microscope and photographs were taken with Kodak Ektachrome ASA 400 film. The nucleotide sequence data reported in this paper will appear in the DDBJ, EMBL, and GenBankTM nucleotide sequence data bases with the following accession numbers, AB010812 (human) and AB013852 (mouse). Loci for the p45, nrf1, andnrf2 genes have been mapped near the hoxC,hoxB, and hoxD gene clusters, respectively (24Chan J.Y. Cheung M.-C. Moi P. Chan K. Kan Y.W. Hum. Genet. 1995; 95: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but no CNC factor mapping close to the hoxA locus had yet been identified, suggesting that a novel CNC factor may exist. We searched for CNC factors in the TIGR human EST data base and found a 668-bp EST clone (GenBankTM accession number THC181377) encoding an amino acid sequence homologous to that of the C-terminal end of Nrf1. As this EST clone may encode a novel CNC factor, we set out to isolate the corresponding or related DNA fragments. We first attempted to isolate a genomic DNA fragment corresponding to this EST clone, since nrf1 and nrf2 genes are known to contain a large C-terminal exon (5Luna L. Johnsen O. Skartlien A.H. Pedeutour F. Turc-Carel C. Prydz H. Kolsto A. Genomics. 1994; 22: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 6Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9926-9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). The C-terminal exon sequence was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA of HeLa cells as a template, and a fragment with sequence matching exactly to the EST clone was successfully obtained (data not shown). To obtain a full length cDNA clone, a human placenta cDNA library was screened using the PCR clone, and four positive overlapping phage clones were isolated (data not shown; see below). To isolate the mouse homologue, we screened a mouse brain cDNA library using one of the human partial cDNA clones and obtained eight positive phage clones. As shown in Fig.1 A, the longest mouse cDNA clone encodes a 1983-bp open reading frame flanked by 237 and 339 bp of 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs), respectively. Although no preceding in-frame stop codon was noted in the 5′-UTR of this cDNA, we identified a termination codon 15 nucleotides upstream from 5′-terminal of this cDNA in the mouse genomic clone, 2A. Kobayashi, unpublished observations. supporting our assigned translation initiation codon. The nucleotide sequence GAGATGA surrounding the ATG codon (underlined) matches the translation initiation site consensus sequence reported by Kozak (33Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). The open reading frame encodes a predicted protein of 660 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 72,706 Da (Fig.1 A). Two copies of RNA destabilizing signal (ATTTA) (underlined; Ref. 34Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar) reside in the 3′-UTR.Figure 1Cloning and structure of Nrf3. A, nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of mouse Nrf3 cDNA. The CNC and basic domains and leucine residues in zipper domains are indicated by the dotted line,box, and circles, respectively. A polyadenylation consensus sequence is indicated by the thick underline. Two mRNA destabilizing sequences in 3′-UTR and one CNC factor-conserved amino acid sequence (DSGLSL) are underlined. B, comparison of amino acid sequences of mouse and human Nrf3. Sequence information from human Nrf3 genomic sequence data of bacteria artificial chromosome clone (AC004520) is underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Sequence analysis of the longest human clone (number 1–1) and comparison of the predicted protein with that of the mouse revealed that the human clone is likely to be partial (Fig. 1 B), since the N-terminal coding region was shorter than that of the mouse protein. Despite extensive 5′-rapid amplification of the cDNA end analyses using human placental mRNA, we were unable to isolate any additional upstream sequence (data not shown). However, the genomic sequence data of a bacteria artificial chromosome clone containing this locus was recently entered in the GenBankTM data base from the Genome Sequencing Center of Washington University (accession numberAC004520) and that sequence information has been incorporated into the human cDNA sequence (Fig. 1 B). Comparison of the N-terminal structure of the human protein with that of the mouse revealed that their deduced coding sequences are less conserved (68% homology) than those of other CNC family members (89, 97, and 80% overall identities, respectively, for p45, Nrf1, and Nrf2) between mouse and human. Inspection of the domain structure of the new mouse clone revealed the presence of a bZip domain which is homologous to that of other CNC transcription factors: 53, 56, and 50% identity, respectively, for p45, Nrf1, and Nrf2 (Fig.2 A), indicating that this protein is a member of the CNC family. We therefore named this factor Nrf3 (NF-E2 relatedfactor-3). In the bZip region, the basic region of Nrf3 was especially highly conserved with that of other CNC factors (see Fig. 2 B), suggesting that Nrf3 may share their DNA binding specificity. A short region “DSGLSL” that is absolutely conserved among the CNC family members (24Chan J.Y. Cheung M.-C. Moi P. Chan K. Kan Y.W. Hum. Genet. 1995; 95: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) is also present in Nrf3 (see Fig. 1 A, underlined). The leucine-zipper sequence of Nrf3, however, was much more variable than those of other CNC factors. The three CNC factors currently analyzed (i.e. p45, Nrf1, and Nrf2) have all been shown to bind MAREs as heterodimers with one of the small Maf proteins, but not as homodimers. Since one of these small Mafs, MafK (9Andrews N.C. Kotkow K.J. Ney H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11488-11492Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 11Toki T. Itoh J. Kitazawa J.

We therefore examined whether a complex of Nrf3 and MafK could bind to the MARE of the chicken β-globin enhancer by EMSA. Bacterially expressed MBP-fused bZip domains of the CNC proteins were tested for their ability to bind MARE. In the absence of MafK, no DNA binding was observed (Fig. 3 A,lanes 2–4). Although a homodimer of MafK could bind the probe (lane 5), the affinity appeared to be much weaker than the CNC-MafK heterodimers (lanes 6–8). The binding of Nrf3-MafK was efficiently competed out with addition of cold double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding the MAREs of the chicken β-globin enhancer and the hypersensitive site 2 (HS-2) of human β-globin LCR (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3 and 5), but not by mutated MAREs (lane 4). Similarly, the MARE sequence of the erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase gene promoter, to which NF-E2 cannot efficiently bind, 3K. Igarashi and M. Yamamoto, unpublished observations. did not compete with the binding of the labeled probe (lane 6). These results demonstrate the specificity of the recognition for MAREs by the Nrf3-MafK heterodimer complex. To assess binding affinities of the three CNC factors to MARE, a series of off-rate kinetic experiments was carried out (Fig. 3 C). These CNC factors were mixed with MafK and radiolabeled MARE probe, and the mixtures were subjected to the addition of cold double-stranded oligonucleotides. The mixtures were then separated at several time points by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fig. 3 D shows half-times of Nrf1-, Nrf2- and Nrf3-MafK-DNA complexes. The half-time of dissociation of Nrf1- and Nrf3-MafK complex from MARE was approximately 5 min, while that of Nrf2-MafK complex was within 3 min. These results suggest that Nrf1- and Nrf3-MafK complexes could bind the MARE probe more tightly than Nrf2-MafK complex in this experimental condition. We then examined dimerization affinities between Nrf3 and MafK using the yeast two-hybrid system. For this purpose the S. cerevisiae strain SFY526 was utilized which carries a lacZ reporter gene with binding sites for GAL4 (upstream activating sequence). Hybrid proteins of human Nrf1, Nrf2 (both full length), and Nrf3 (lacking the N-terminal) fused to the GAL4 activation domain (GAD) were used for “prey,” whereas a fusion of human MafK to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GBD) was used as “bait” (Fig.4). Dimerization activities between these chimeric proteins were determined by measuring the LacZ activity. As shown in Table I, control experiments using GBT9 plasmid (GBD alone) and GAD-Nrf1, GAD-Nrf2, or GAD-Nrf3 did not exhibit LacZ reporter activity. Similarly, GBD-MafK and GAD424 plasmid (GAD alone) showed no LacZ activity. In contrast, considerable enhancement of LacZ activity was observed when th"

The regulation of APP gene expression as a pathogenic factor for AD has received considerable attention. Several putative physiological activators of APP gene transcription have been defined (8Neve R. Valletta J.S. Ventosa-Michelman M. Holzman D.M. Mobley W.C. Mol.

For example, α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) is present in amyloid plaques, and its production by adjacent astrocytes suggests the occurrence of an inherent inflammation in the AD brain, similar to the hepatic acute phase response (16Abraham C.

Epidemiological studies identifying traumatic head injury as a risk factor for AD strengthen the hypothesis that inflammatory mechanisms contribute to the disease pathogenesis (20Roberts G.

Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 2283-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, a smaller induction of APP gene transcription by IL-1 in rat neuronal cells was not matched by an increase in the steady-state levels of APP mRNA in glial cells, including astrocytes (2Gray C.W.

Here, increased synthesis of APP by IL-1 was found to be mediated through a translational regulatory sequence in the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of APP mRNAs. We showed previously that IL-1 specifically enhances translation of the mRNAs encoding the light (L) and heavy (H) subunits of ferritin, the central iron storage protein present in all cells (35Rogers J.T.

The APP mRNA 5′-UTR sequence can fold into a single RNA stem-loop and is related to hepatic RNA enhancers, the acute box sequences, in the 5′-UTR of L- and H-ferritin mRNAs (36Rogers J.T.

Potter H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 447-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), treatment with 5 mm H-Leu-O-methyl ester to eliminate microglia (38Giulian D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1987; 18: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), seeding onto coated plates, and growing to 70% confluence in DMEM (low glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For immunohistochemistry the cells were grown on 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine-coated microscope slides, washed briefly in 1 × PBS, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1 × PBS, pH 7.4, for 30 min on ice. The cells were then incubated in 10% normal goat serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.4% Triton X-100 in 1 × PBS for 30 min at 37 °C to block nonspecific binding. The primary antibody (monoclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), clone G-A-5, Sigma, dilution 1:400), was applied in 1% normal goat serum and 0.4% Triton X-100 in 1 × PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. The astrocytes were washed for 5 min in 1 × PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody (affinity-purified polyclonal Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L), Jackson ImmunoResearch, dilution 1:400) in 10% normal goat serum and 0.4% Triton X-100 in 1 × PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were again washed in 1 × PBS for 5 min, counterstained with 4 ng/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, mounted in 50% glycerol, and examined with a light microscope (Axioskop, Zeiss).The U373MG astrocytoma cell line was obtained from Dr. H. Fine (DFCI, Boston, MA) and cultured on uncoated dishes to 60–80% confluence in DMEM (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.Plasmid ConstructsThe eukaryote expression vector pSV2CAT contains a unique StuI site 45 base pairs (bp) downstream from the SV40 early T-antigen promoter. A unique HindIII site is present 17 bp further downstream from the StuI site (62 bp from the CAT gene 5′-cap site (36Rogers J.T. Andriotakis J.L. Lacroix L. Kasschau K.D. Durmowicz G.P. Bridges K.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2678-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)). The pSV2(APP)CATconstruct was prepared by inserting 90 bp of the APP gene 5′-UTR (between theSmaI and the NruI sites, respectively +55 and +144 nucleotides from the 5′-cap site) into the StuI andHindIII sites in the 5′-UTR of the CAT gene in pSV2CAT (see Fig. 6). This pSV2(APP)CAT construct was prepared by two steps of subcloning because the APP gene 5′-UTR is GC-rich and was refractory to accurate amplification by polymerase chain reaction. First, a 3-kbSmaI-HindIII fragment containing the APP gene was subcloned into compatible StuI and HindIII sites unique to the 5′-UTR of the CAT gene in the pSV2CAT expression vector. The fragment between the NruI andHindIII sites in the APP gene was then removed from the construct. The restriction sites were then blunt ended and religated. The pBS2CAT construct contained a 254-bpHindIII-EcoRI fragment from the CAT gene coding for 218 bp of coding sequences from CAT gene ligated immediately downstream from 36-bp 5′-UTR sequences from the SV40 early T-antigen promoter region. These sequences from the CAT gene were ligated into the unique polylinker site in the pBS vector (Stratagene). The pGEM3zF±-hACT, pGEM3zF±-hAPP, and pGEM3zF±-hGAPDHconstructs, respectively, contained a 407-bp PstI-SacI fragment (amino acids 175–311 in the human ACT gene (39Chandra T. Stackhouse R. Kidd V. Robson K.J.H. Woo S.L.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5055-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar)), a 1,056-bpEcoRI-EcoRI fragment (bp 1795–2856 in the human APP gene (40Kang J. Lemaire H.-G.

Ohkubo M. Sawada K. Sakiyama S. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5616-5619PubMed Google Scholar)). These inserts were subcloned into the pGEM3zf+vector (Stratagene). Restriction-digested DNA from these constructs was used as a template to synthesize antisense cRNAs.APP SynthesisPrimary AstrocytesGFAP-positive astrocytes (1 × 105 cells/well) and astrocytoma cells (70% confluent) were measured for intracellular APP synthesis and ferritin synthesis after stimulation with 0.5 ng/ml recombinant IL-1α (Genzyme), 0.5 ng/ml IL-1β (Genzyme), 10 μm ferrotransferrin (Boehringer Mannheim), 100 μm desferrioxamine (Ciba Geigy), or left untreated as controls. Cell numbers from individual wells were counted to ensure that 1 × 105 cells were present in each well at the beginning of each labeling experiment. Astrocytes were preincubated for 15 min in methionine-free medium (RPMI 1640; Life Technologies, Inc.) and pulse labeled for 30 min with 300 μCi/ml [35S]methionine. Each microtiter plate was washed twice in cold PBS at 4 °C before lysis of astrocytes in 25 μl of STEN buffer (0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mmTris, pH 7.6) using a sterile glass rod.l-Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μg/ml) and leupeptin (2 μg/ml) were added to the STEN lysis buffer to prevent proteolysis. Half of the pooled lysates (i.e. 300-μl total volume from each row of 12 wells) were immunoprecipitated with a 1:500 dilution of a COOH-terminal directed APP antibody (C-8, 1:500 dilution, against amino acids 676–695 of APP-695; gift from D. Selkoe (42Selkoe D. Berman-Polisny M. Joachim C.L. Vickers E.A. Lee G. Fritz L.C. Oltersdorf T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7341-7345Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar)). The other half of the lysates were immunoprecipitated with human ferritin antiserum (1:500 dilution, Boehringer Mannheim). Labeling of secreted APP (APP(s); Protease-Nexin-2) was measured after 2 h of pulse labeling astrocytes with 300 μCi/ml [35S]methionine, after which 2 ml of medium was precleared by centrifugation in Eppendorf tubes (10,000 rpm for 10 min), and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated (1:1,500 dilution, against amino acids 595–611 of APP, R1736, gift from D. Selkoe). ApoE was immunoprecipitated from both the lysate and the medium using a 1:200 dilution of a polyclonal antiserum (Chemicon).Astrocytoma CellsU373MG astrocytoma cells (80% confluent) were stimulated with IL-1α and IL-1β at concentrations between 0.05 and 5 ng/ml. After stimulation, equal numbers of cells were labeled for 30 min with 300 μCi/ml [35S]methionine in DMEM lacking methionine, washed twice with PBS, and the cell pellets were lysed in 200 μl of cold STEN buffer containing 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. There were 2 × 107cells/10-cm2 plate at the beginning of each pulse labeling (see Fig. 4), and 2 × 106 cells were present in each well of six-well plates in the experiment described in Fig. 5. The protein concentrations of each lysate were measured to confirm that equal numbers of cells had been pulse labeled. Total protein synthesis was measured by the amount of [35S]methionine incorporation using 10% trichloroacetic acid and 2% casamino acids to precipitate labeled proteins present in each lysate (4 °C). Triplicate samples (10 μl) were assayed after hydrolysis of methionine charged tRNAs with 250 μl of 1 m NaOH and 1.5% H2O2 at 65 °C for 30 min. APP and ferritin were immunoprecipitated from U373MG astrocytoma lysates by adding 2 μl of anti-APP antibody (C-8 antibody) (42Selkoe D. Berman-Polisny M. Joachim C.L. Vickers E.A. Lee G. Fritz L.C.

The RNA pellet was resuspended in TES buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, pH 7.6), and the A 260/280 nm was measured as an estimate of purity and RNA concentration. A cesium chloride procedure for the purification of RNA from DNA was followed for all experiments involving the use of transfected DNA (36Rogers J.T. Andriotakis J.L. Lacroix L. Kasschau K.D. Durmowicz G.P. Bridges K.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2678-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Total RNA samples from both transfected and untransfected cells were denatured in 50% formamide, 2.2 mformaldehyde, 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, at 60 °C for 10 min. RNA samples were separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gels, blotted onto Hybond-N filters, and immobilized by UV cross-linking (2 min) and heating of filters to 80 °C for 1 h. Filters were prehybridized overnight to reduce background hybridization signal and then hybridized overnight in 50% formamide, 50 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 5 × Denhardt's solution. After hybridization, filters were washed twice for 1 h in 2 × SSC and 0.2% SDS at room temperature. Filters were washed further through four changes of 0.5 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. In all experiments, equal loading of Northern gels was verified by ethidium bromide staining of 18 S and 28 S rRNAs and GAPDH hybridization as an internal standard (41Tokunaga K. Nakamura Y. Sakata K. Fujimori K. Ohkubo M. Sawada K. Sakiyama S. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5616-5619PubMed Google Scholar). Specific RNAs were detected either by hybridization of Northern blot filters with randomly primed cDNA probes (35Rogers J.T. Bridges K. Durmowicz G.P. Glass J. Auron P. Munro H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14572-14578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or with copy RNA (cRNA) probes (37Rogers J.T. Blood. 1996; 87: 2525-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antisense cDNA hybridization probes were labeled by random primed labeling (specific activity = 2 × 108 cpm/μg), and cRNA probes were transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [32P]CTP (3,000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products).Transient Transfections and CAT AssaysTransient TransfectionsAstrocytoma cells (1 × 107 cells/10-cm2 plate) were transfected with 20 μg of DNA, each purified from the pSV2CAT or pSV2(APP)CAT constructs. Inclusion of RSV2-GAL (5 μg) in each transfection was used to standardize for differences in the transfection efficiency of the pSV2CAT and pSV2(APP)CAT constructs. Briefly, LipofectAMINE reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to DMEM (without serum) and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Plasmids (20 μg), in an equal volume of DMEM, were incubated for 45 min at room temperature with the LipofectAMINE reaction mixture. LipofectAMINE-DNA complex was then applied for 4 h to U373MG astrocytoma cells grown to 60% confluence. The cells were washed twice in DMEM (without serum), and subsequently cells were incubated for 24–48 h with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in the presence or absence of cytokine before harvesting and CAT assay. Transfected cells were stimulated with cytokine by the administration of 0.5 ng/ml IL-1α, 0.5 ng/ml IL-1β, or left as unstimulated controls. After defined times of cytokine stimulus (20 h in Fig. 7 A), cells were harvested in PBS and assayed immediately for CAT activity or CAT mRNA levels (Northern blotting).Figure 7A 90-nucleotide SmaI toNruI sequence element from the 5′-UTR of APP mRNA confers IL-1-dependent CAT gene expression in U373MG cells.

https://openalex.org/W2125947059,"CD44 has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis, but the mechanism(s) involved is as yet poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that CD44 isoforms containing the alternatively spliced exon v3 carry heparan sulfate side chains and are able to bind heparin-binding growth factors. In the present study, we have explored the possibility of a physical and functional interaction between CD44 and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), the ligand of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met. The HGF/SF-c-Met pathway mediates cell growth and motility and has been implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis. We demonstrate that a CD44v3 splice variant efficiently binds HGF/SF via its heparan sulfate side chain. To address the functional relevance of this interaction, Namalwa Burkitt's lymphoma cells were stably co-transfected with c-Met and either CD44v3 or the isoform CD44s, which lacks heparan sulfate. We show that, as compared with CD44s, CD44v3 promotes: (i) HGF/SF-induced phosphorylation of c-Met, (ii) phosphorylation of several downstream proteins, and (iii) activation of the MAP kinases ERK1 and -2. By heparitinase treatment and the use of a mutant HGF/SF with greatly decreased affinity for heparan sulfate, we show that the enhancement of c-Met signal transduction induced by CD44v3 was critically dependent on heparan sulfate moieties. Our results identify heparan sulfate-modified CD44 (CD44-HS) as a functional co-receptor for HGF/SF which promotes signaling through the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met, presumably by concentrating and presenting HGF/SF. As both CD44-HS and c-Met are overexpressed on several types of tumors, we propose that the observed functional collaboration might be instrumental in promoting tumor growth and metastasis. CD44 has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis, but the mechanism(s) involved is as yet poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that CD44 isoforms containing the alternatively spliced exon v3 carry heparan sulfate side chains and are able to bind heparin-binding growth factors. In the present study, we have explored the possibility of a physical and functional interaction between CD44 and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), the ligand of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met. The HGF/SF-c-Met pathway mediates cell growth and motility and has been implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis. We demonstrate that a CD44v3 splice variant efficiently binds HGF/SF via its heparan sulfate side chain. To address the functional relevance of this interaction, Namalwa Burkitt's lymphoma cells were stably co-transfected with c-Met and either CD44v3 or the isoform CD44s, which lacks heparan sulfate. We show that, as compared with CD44s, CD44v3 promotes: (i) HGF/SF-induced phosphorylation of c-Met, (ii) phosphorylation of several downstream proteins, and (iii) activation of the MAP kinases ERK1 and -2. By heparitinase treatment and the use of a mutant HGF/SF with greatly decreased affinity for heparan sulfate, we show that the enhancement of c-Met signal transduction induced by CD44v3 was critically dependent on heparan sulfate moieties.

As both CD44-HS and c-Met are overexpressed on several types of tumors, we propose that the observed functional collaboration might be instrumental in promoting tumor growth and metastasis. The CD44 family of cell surface glycoproteins is broadly expressed by cells of epithelial, mesenchymal, and hematopoietic origin and is involved in cell-matrix adhesion, hematopoiesis, and lymphocyte homing and activation (1Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 271-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a large body of experimental and clinical studies support a role for CD44 in tumor progression and metastasis (2Herrlich P. Zöller M. Pals S.T. Ponta H. Immunol.

Due to alternative splicing, which involves at least 10 exons encoding domains of the extracellular portion of the CD44 molecule, a large number of CD44 isoforms is generated (6Stamenkovic I.

This selective expression suggests specific biological functions for the various splice variants, but at present, these are poorly defined. Similarly, the mechanism(s) through which CD44 functions in tumorigenesis is not known. An obstacle toward understanding the functions of the CD44 family is the limited knowledge of its molecular partners. The cytoplasmic tail of the CD44 molecule has been shown to interact with the actin cytoskeleton via ankyrin and proteins of the ERM family, and is associated with Src family tyrosine kinases (20Lacy B.E.

Although several potential CD44 ligands have been identified, the only interaction of the extracellular domain of CD44 that has been extensively studied is that with hyaluronate. CD44s acts as a major receptor for this glycosaminoglycan which is highly abundant in mesenchymal tissues and is believed to play a role in cell migration and differentiation (24Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar, 25Miyake K. Underhill C.B. Lesley J. Kincade P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). A novel and potentially highly significant function of CD44 is its ability to interact with heparin-binding growth factors (26Tanaka Y. Adams D.H. Hubscher S. Hirano H. Siebenlist U. Shaw S. Nature. 1993; 361: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 27Bennett K.L. Jackson D.G. Simon J.C. Tanczos E. Peach R. Modrell B. Stamenkovic I. Plowman G. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). These growth factors bind to a HS side chain attached to the evolutionary conserved consensus motif SGSG encoded by exon v3 (13Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. Dickinson R. Timans J. Shields J. Whittle N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 27Bennett K.L. Jackson D.G. Simon J.C. Tanczos E. Peach R. Modrell B. Stamenkovic I. Plowman G. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are believed to play an important regulatory role in cell growth and motility by binding growth factors and by presenting these factors to their high affinity receptors. This process has been particularly well explored for the fibroblast growth factors 1 and 2 (FGF-1 and -2). For these factors, binding to HSPGs has been shown to be required for their biological function, presumably by promoting FGF dimerization required for efficient receptor cross-linking and activation (28Rapraeger A.C.

In the present study, we explored the physical and functional interaction between heparan sulfate-modified forms of CD44 (CD44-HS) and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF). HGF/SF is a heparin-binding growth factor (33Nakamura T. Teramoto H. Ichihara A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6489-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) that induces growth, motility, and morphogenesis of target epithelial and endothelial cells by binding to the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met (34Rosen E.M.

In addition, recently HGF/SF was shown to be involved in hematopoiesis, and lymphocyte adhesion and migration (36Kmiecik T.E. Keller J.R. Rosen E. Vande Woude G.F.

Apart from these physiological functions, there is ample evidence for a key role of the HGF/SF-c-Met pathway in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. For example, HGF/SF induces epithelial cells to invade collagen matrices in vitro, and NIH 3T3 cells co-transfected with c-met and HGF/SF acquire an invasive and metastatic phenotype (43Weidner K.M.

Furthermore, in HGF/SF transgenic mice, tumors develop in many different tissues including mammary glands, skeletal muscles, and melanocytes (46Takayama H. LaRochelle W.J. Sharp R. Otsuka T.

The Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Namalwa was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Breda, The Netherlands) supplemented with 10% Fetal Clone I serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 10% fetal calf serum (Integro, Zaandam, The Netherlands), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 IU/ml streptomycin (all Life Technologies). Namalwa cells transfected with CD44s (Nam-S), CD44v8–10 (Nam-V8), or CD44v3–10 (Nam-V3) were described previously (56van der Voort R. Manten-Horst E. Smit L. Ostermann E. van den Berg F. Pals S.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A second transfection of Namalwa cells, expressing either CD44s (Nam-SM) or CD44v3–10 (Nam-V3 m), with c-Met was performed as described (41van der Voort R. Taher T.E.I. Keehnen R.M.J. Smit L. Groenink M. Pals S.T. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 2121-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The construction of pVL1393 vectors (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) containing wild type or mutant HGF/SF (HP1) cDNA was described elsewhere (57Hartmann G. Prospero T. Brinkmann V. Ozcelik O. Winter G. Hepple J. Batley S. Bladt F. Sachs M. Birchmeier C. Gherardi E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HGF/SF (wild type and HP1) was produced in a baculovirus system as described previously (58Hartmann G. Naldini L. Weidner K.M. Sachs M. Vigna E. Comoglio P.M. Birchmeier W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11574-11578Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In brief, Sf9 insect cells were transduced with an amplified virus stock and after 3 days media were pooled and analyzed for scattering activity in the Madin-Darby canine kidney cell dissociation assay (59Weidner K.M. Behrens J. Vandekerckhove J. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2097-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Then, HGF/SF was purified with Ni-NTA resin from the QIAexpress system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). HGF/SF concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (41van der Voort R. Taher T.E.I. Keehnen R.M.J. Smit L. Groenink M. Pals S.T. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 2121-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, HGF/SF (wtand HP1) was analyzed by Western blotting using goat anti-HGF/SF. For enzymatic cleavage of glycosaminoglycans, cells were treated with either heparitinase (Flafobacterium heparinum, EC 4.2.2.8, ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) or chondroitinase ABC (Proteus vulgaris, EC 4.2.2.4, Boehringer Mannheim, Almere, The Netherlands) in PBS at 37 °C for the periods indicated. Enzyme treatments were followed by FACS analysis or immunoprecipitation. For FACS analysis cells were blocked with 10% pooled human serum (CLB, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), 1% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V) (Sigma, Bornem, Belgium) in PBS at 4 °C for 15 min and washed with FACS buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS), respectively. Then, the cells were incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h, washed, and incubated with the secondary antibody for 30 min. Incubations were in FACS buffer at 4 °C, and cells were analyzed by using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). For binding of recombinant human HGF/SF (wild type or HP1) (R&D Systems or our own product), cells were incubated with this protein (18 nm or as indicated) for 1 h, prior to the antibody incubations. This step was followed by washing with FACS buffer. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described (41van der Voort R. Taher T.E.I. Keehnen R.M.J. Smit L. Groenink M. Pals S.T. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 2121-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The only modifications were that, for precipitation of CD44, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 1 mm sodium orthovandate (Sigma), 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm sodium fluoride. For precipitation of c-Met, cells were lysed in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 2 mm sodium orthovandate (Sigma), 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm sodium fluoride. Western blotting of immunoprecipitates and total cell lysates was essentially performed as described previously (23Taher T.E.I. Smit L. Griffioen A.W. Schilder-Tol E.J.M. Borst J. Pals S.T. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 2863-2867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A single modification was that, for analysis of phosphorylated proteins, membranes were blocked and stained in 2% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5), and 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma). Films were scanned with an Eagle Eye II video system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and band intensities were determined with ONE-Dscan software (Stratagene). c-Met phosphorylation was expressed as the ratio of phosphorylated c-Met to c-Met precipitated. For analysis of phosphorylation of the ERK1 and -2 MAP kinases, after the indicated treatments, 5 × 105 cells were directly lysed in sample buffer and analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted. Equal loading was confirmed by Ponceau S staining of the blot. The part of the blot below 50 kDa was stained with anti-phospho-MAPK antiserum, the upper part with anti-phosphotyrosine PY-20. Primary antibodies were detected by HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse, respectively. Identification of the ERKs was confirmed by staining with anti-ERK1 or anti-ERK2. Binding of HGF/SF to different CD44 isoforms was assessed by using a panel of Namalwa Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines stably transfected with cDNAs encoding CD44s, CD44v8–10, or CD44v3–10 (Fig.1 A) (56van der Voort R. Manten-Horst E. Smit L. Ostermann E. van den Berg F. Pals S.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Prior to transfection, the cells were negative for CD44 and c-Met expression at both the protein and mRNA level (data not shown). All transfectants used for HGF/SF binding studies expressed comparable levels of CD44 (Table I). HGF/SF binding to the CD44 transfectants was measured by FACS analysis using an anti-HGF/SF mAb, an approach that avoids chemical modification of the ligand. As shown in Fig. 1 B, CD44 negative control cells as well as CD44s and CD44v8–10 transfectants showed a low saturable binding of HGF/SF. In contrast, cells expressing CD44v3–10 bound much larger quantities of HGF/SF. These results suggest that CD44v3–10 contains a binding site(s) for HGF/SF.Table ISurface expression of CD44 on Namalwa transfectantsCD44 isoformCloneMFIaMean fluorescence intensity after staining with the anti-pan CD44 mAb NKI-P1 followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse.Positive cells%None (Neo)A43CD44sA8394B9697CD44v8–10A12684B14288CD44v3–10A13788B8287a Mean fluorescence intensity after staining with the anti-pan CD44 mAb NKI-P1 followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse. Open table in a new tab We next conducted a series of experiments aimed at determining the role of HS side chains in the binding of HGF/SF. First, the presence of total HS on the different transfectants was assessed by FACS analysis using the HS-specific mAb 10E4 (Fig. 2 A), and the mAb 3G10 (Fig. 2 B) which recognizes the ΔHS stubs remaining on HSPG core proteins after treatment with heparitinase (55David G. Bai X.M. Van Der Schueren B. Cassiman J.-J. Van Den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Both figures show that cells transfected with CD44v3–10 express approximately 20-fold higher levels of HS compared with those transfected with other CD44 isoforms. Next, we investigated the presence of HS on CD44 itself. This was done by using mAb 3G10. With this mAb, a single major HS band was detected in Western blots of CD44 precipitates from the CD44v3–10 cells, but not from the other transfectants (Fig. 2C). Staining the blot with an anti-pan CD44 mAb demonstrated that this band corresponded to CD44v3–10 (Fig. 2 C). To assess the role of HS in the interaction between HGF/SF and CD44v3–10, we studied the effect of heparitinase treatment and performed binding studies with HP1, a HGF/SF mutant which has a greatly decreased (more than 50-fold) affinity for heparan sulfate and heparin (57Hartmann G. Prospero T. Brinkmann V. Ozcelik O. Winter G. Hepple J. Batley S. Bladt F. Sachs M. Birchmeier C. Gherardi E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, heparitinase treatment resulted in a near complete loss of HGF/SF binding, while treatment with chondroitinase ABC had no effect. The essential role of HS moieties on CD44v3–10 in HGF/SF binding was further confirmed by the observation that HP1 did not bind to CD44v3–10 (Fig. 3 B). These data demonstrate that CD44v3–10 is a heparan sulfate-modified CD44 isoform (CD44-HS) that binds HGF/SF via its HS side chain. To explore the functional impact of HGF/SF bound to CD44-HS on the c-Met signaling pathway, we generated double transfectants expressing c-Met in combination with either CD44v3–10 or CD44s. We selected stable transfectants expressing equal amounts of c-Met to be used in the subsequent studies (Fig.4). Using these cell lines, we assessed in the first instance HGF/SF induced c-Met phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 5, triggering with HGF/SF led to a vast and rapid increase in the phosphorylation of c-Met on tyrosine residues in the cells expressing CD44v3–10. By contrast, phosphorylation of c-Met was only weakly increased in the cells with CD44s (Fig. 5) and was absent in the parental cell line (data not shown), confirming the lack of endogenous c-Met in these cells. The dose-response studies demonstrated that CD44v3–10 promotes c-Met phosphorylation over a broad dose range (Fig. 5 A) with an approximately 7-fold relative increase at plateau level. The time curve (Fig. 5 B) showed that phosphorylation was maximal between 2 and 10 min after addition of the growth factor and declined thereafter. Moreover, this strong enhancing effect of CD44v3–10 on c-Met phosphorylation was dependent on HS moieties since it was lost upon heparitinase treatment (Fig.6 A). The importance of HS for HGF/SF signaling was further strengthened by studies using the HGF/SF heparin-binding domain mutant HP1. This mutant induced an equal (weak) phosphorylation of c-Met in both the CD44v3–10 and CD44s transfectants (Fig. 6 B). Thus, these data suggest that CD44v3–10 binds HGF/SF via its HS side chains and then presents it to the high affinity receptor c-Met.Figure 5CD44v3–10 strongly promotes c-Met activation.

Then, the blot was stripped and re-stained with rabbit anti-c-Met followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (lower panel).

The active fraction was purified from casein by anion exchange chromatography. Unlike other casein components the active fraction was retained by the ion exchanger and eluted after a high salt gradient. The active fraction showed N-terminal amino acid sequence identity with human milk α-lactalbumin and mass spectrometry ruled out post-translational modifications. Size exclusion chromatography resolved monomers and oligomers of α-lactalbumin that were characterized using UV absorbance, fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The high molecular weight oligomers were kinetically stable against dissociation into monomers and were found to have an essentially retained secondary structure but a less well organized tertiary structure. Comparison with native monomeric and molten globule α-lactalbumin showed that the active fraction contains oligomers of α-lactalbumin that have undergone a conformational switch toward a molten globule-like state. Oligomerization appears to conserve α-lactalbumin in a state with molten globule-like properties at physiological conditions. The results suggest differences in biological properties between folding variants of α-lactalbumin.

Breastfeeding protects against respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, due to the presence in milk of molecules with anti-microbial activity: antibodies, potentially bactericidal molecules like lysozyme and lactoferrin (1Lönnerdal B. Forsum E. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1985; 41: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), fatty acids that lyse bacteria and viral particles (2Redhead K. Hill T. Mulloy B. FEMS Microbiol.

Lancet. 1988; ii: 365-368Abstract Scopus (160) Google Scholar), suggesting that milk contains molecules with anti-tumor activity. We recently observed that a protein fraction of human milk induces apoptosis in tumor cells but not in mature healthy cells (7Håkansson A. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Sabharwal H. Svanborg C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8064-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the main protein constituent of this fraction was α-lactalbumin. Monomeric α-lactalbumin is secreted by the mammary epithelium and is the major whey protein of human milk (8Heine W.E. Klein P.D. Reeds P.J. J. Nutr. 1991; 121: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Its main known function is to change the acceptor specificity of β-galactosyltransferase from GlcNAc to Glc, thus enabling the synthesis of lactose in milk (9Brew K. Grobler J. Fox P. Advanced Dairy Chemistry 1. Elsevier, London1992: 191-229Google Scholar, 10Hill R. Brew K. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Mol. Biol. 1975; 43: 411-490PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of α-lactalbumin has been solved (11Acharya K.R. Ren J.S. Stuart D.I. Phillips D.C. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). It is a metalloprotein with high affinity for Ca2+ and other divalent cations (12Aramini J.M. Hiraoki T. Grace M.R.

At low pH, α-lactalbumin forms a relatively stable protein folding variant (16Wu L.C. Schulman B.A. Peng Z.Y. Kim P.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This form, the molten globule, has native-like secondary structure but less well defined tertiary structure, and larger stokes radius (17Dolgikh D. Gilmanshin R. Brazhnikov E. Bychkova V. Semisotnov G. Venyaminov S. Ptitsyn O. FEBS Lett. 1981; 136: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Similar states are formed at elevated temperatures, by reduction of disulfide bonds or by removal of calcium at neutral pH (18Kuwajima K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1985; 6: 87-103Crossref Scopus (1483) Google Scholar, 19Kuwajima K. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 20Pfeil W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 911: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Unlike monomeric α-lactalbumin from whey, the apoptosis-inducing component was purified from the casein fraction (precipitated at pH 4.3), and behaved as a multimeric protein rather than a monomer. Furthermore, native monomeric α-lactalbumin from human milk whey was inactive in the apoptosis assay. These observations suggested that the active fraction contains an alternative molecular form of α-lactalbumin. Here we show, using mass spectrometry, gel filtration, UV absorption, fluorescence, and CD spectroscopy, that the apoptosis-inducing form of α-lactalbumin is a mixture of monomeric and multimeric forms with molten globule-like properties and suggest that folding variants of α-lactalbumin differ in biologic activity.

The Biotin Labeling kit was from Boehringer Mannheim, GmbH, Germany. All chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Native, monomeric α-lactalbumin was purified from human milk by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The ammonium sulfate was added as a salt, 264 g/liter milk, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The mixture was centrifuged (Sorvall RC-5B refrigerated superspeed centrifuge, Du Pont Instruments, Wilmington, DE) at 5000 × g for 15 min. The whey fraction was collected, lyophilized, and dissolved in 50 mmTris/HCl with 35 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. A 400-ml phenyl-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) was packed in 50 mm Tris/HCl with 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, 25 °C and a 500-ml sample was loaded onto the column. The column was first washed with 50 mm Tris/HCl with 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and α-lactalbumin was then eluted from the column with 50 mm Tris/HCl with 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, thus yielding the native, Ca2+ bound form of α-lactalbumin. The classical molten globule state was obtained by lowering the pH of a solution of native monomeric α-lactalbumin to 2.0 by adding 0.1m HCl. This material was used as a control sample in subsequent spectroscopic studies. In the cellular experiments, EDTA (0.14 mm/mg) was added to α-lactalbumin to remove Ca2+ and thus form the apo state, which is molten globule-like. Frozen human milk was thawed and centrifuged (Sorvall RC-5B refrigerated superspeed centrifuge, Du Pont Instruments) at 2500 × g for 15 min; the upper fat layer was removed. Casein was isolated by an overnight incubation at 4 °C with 10% potassium oxalate followed by a second overnight incubation at 4 °C after lowering the pH to 4.3 using 1m hydrochloric acid and heating the solution to 32 °C for 2 h. The casein precipitate was harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min, washed by 3–5 cycles of centrifugation, and resuspension in distilled water and lyophilized. Casein was fractionated on DEAE-Trisacryl M (Biosepra, Villeneuve la Garenne, France) using an FPLC instrument (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) with increasing NaCl gradient. The sample was loaded in buffer A (0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) at 25 °C and eluted by increasing proportions of buffer B (buffer A containing 1 m NaCl). Gradient program: start 15% B; from 0 to 60 ml: linear gradient from 60 to 90 ml: 30% B at 90 ml: 100% B; for 10 min; thereafter 100% A. Flow rate: 1 ml/min, recorder: 0.1 cm/min. The buffers were degassed and filtered through 0.22-μm filters before use. The peaks were monitored at 280 nm, and the fraction size was 3 ml. The eluate was desalted by dialysis (Spectra/Por, Spectrum Medical Industries, Laguna Hills, CA, membrane cut off 3.5 kDa) against distilled water for at least 48 h and lyophilized. The active fraction from anion exchange chromatography was subjected to size exclusion separation on Sephadex G-50 column (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden, 93 × 2.5 cm) equilibrated with 0.06 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 25 °C. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, peaks were monitored at 280 nm and 3-ml fractions were collected and pooled. The pools were desalted by dialysis (membrane cut off 3.5 kDa) against distilled water for at least 48 h and lyophilized before further analysis in subsequent experiments. Further gel filtration of the active fraction from the anion exchange chromatography was performed on a Superose 12 column (Pharmacia Biotech, 30 × 1.0 cm) in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 25 °C with 0.15 m NaCl. The flow rate was 0.3 ml/min, the fraction size was 0.5 ml and peaks were monitored at 280 nm. Observed peaks were collected, desalted by dialysis against distilled water, and lyophilized. Analytical PAGE was performed using 4–20% polyacrylamide precast gels on a Bio-Rad Mini Protean II cell. To 10 μl of the lyophilized fractions from anion exchange chromatography or gel filtrations dissolved in distilled water (5–10 mg/ml), an equal volume of sample buffer (13.1% 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10.5% glycerol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue) was added. Samples (20 μl) were then loaded onto the gel, which was run in Tris glycine buffer, pH 8.3, with 0.1% SDS at 200 V constant voltage for 40 min. Proteins were stained by immersing the gel in 0.1% Coomassie Blue solution in water/methanol/acetic acid (5:4:1) for 0.5 h. Destaining was by several changes in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid until a clear background was obtained. After PAGE, the protein bands of peak K from the G-50 column were transferred by Western blotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining and the stained bands were cut out for protein sequencing. Protein sequencing was also performed on an aliquot of each of the peaks 1–4 from the Superose-12 column directly. All samples were subjected to Edman degradation performed in an automated pulse-liquid sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 477A). Peak K was analyzed on a VG Bio-Q ESI-MS (Fisons/VG, Manchester, UK) equipped with an atmospheric pressure electrospray ion source and a quadruple mass analyzer with a maximum mass range of 4000. The mass spectrometer was scanned from m/z 600 to 2000 in 10 s. The mass resolution was set to 500. The data system was operated as a multichannel analyzer and 5 scans were averaged to obtain the final spectrum. The electrospray carrier solvent was 1% acetic acid in acetonitrile/water, 1:1, and the flow rate was 2–4 μl/min. The sample was dissolved at a concentration of 10–20 pmol/μl in the carrier solvent and 5 μl was injected. The molecular weight of sample components was estimated from the m/z values of series of ions as described earlier. Peak K was analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry on an LDI 1700 time of flight mass spectrometer equipped with a pulsed nitrogen laser (337 nm) (Biomolecular Separations Inc., Reno, NE). The laser power was set to 8.6 microjoule and the spectrum was the sum of 140 laser shots. Sinapinic acid was used as a matrix and bovine serum albumin was used as the external standard. About 100 μg of the protein was dissolved in 50 μl of water and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. 10 μl of this solution was mixed with 10 μl of 50 mm sinapinic acid. The probe was loaded with 0.8 μl of the sample mixture, vacuum dried, loaded with another 0.8 μl of sample, and vacuum dried again before being inserted into the mass spectrometer. Prior to spectroscopic analysis, the proteins or protein fractions were dialyzed against doubly distilled water and lyophilized. Stock solutions of each sample were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized material in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5. The concentrations of the stock solutions were determined using amino acid analysis after acid hydrolysis. The spectra were recorded on solutions prepared by diluting aliquots of stock solution into 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5. All spectra were recorded at 25 °C. UV absorbance spectra were recorded at room temperature on a GBC UV/VIS 920 spectrophotometer, in a quartz cuvette with 1-cm path length. Fluorescence spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B spectrometer using a quartz cuvette with 1-cm excitation path length. Intrinsic (tryptophan) fluorescence emission spectra were recorded between 305 and 530 nm (step 1 nm) with excitation at 295 nm. The excitation band width was 3 nm and the emission band width was 5 nm. ANS fluorescence emission spectra were recorded between 400 and 600 nm (step 1 nm) with excitation at 385 nm. Both the excitation and emission bandpass were set to 5 nm. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were obtained using a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter with a JASCO PTC-343 Peltier-type thermostated cell holder. Quartz cuvettes were used with 1-cm path length in the near UV range and 1 and 0.1-mm path length in the far UV range. Near UV spectra were recorded between 320 and 240 nm, and far UV spectra between 250 and 182 nm. The wavelength step was 1 nm, the response time was 4 s, and the scan rate was 10 nm/min. Six scans were recorded and averaged for each spectrum. Baseline spectra were recorded with pure buffer in each cuvette and subtracted from the protein spectra. The mean residue ellipticity θm (mdeg × cm2 × dmol−1) was calculated from the recorded ellipticity, θ, as θm = θ/(c·n·l), where c is the protein concentration in M, n the number of residues in the protein (123 in this case), l the path length in m, and θ the ellipticy in degrees. The L1210 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), cultured in 25-cm2 flasks (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, NJ) in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, 50 μg of gentamicin/ml, kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, with change of medium every 3 days. The cells were harvested from the culture flasks by centrifugation (200 × g for 10 min). The cell pellet was resuspended in medium and seeded into 24-well plates, 2 × 106/well (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, NJ). Cells were exposed to the different forms of α-lactalbumin, with medium as a control. At time 0, 100 μl of medium was aspirated from each well, replaced by 100 μl of the different experimental solutions and incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 6 h. Cells were harvested from the 24-well plates by aspiration, resuspended in PBS (5 ml), washed, and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. For analysis, 30 μl of the washed cell suspension was mixed with 30 μl of a 0.2% trypan blue solution and the number of stained cells (dead cells) per 100 cells was determined by interference contrast microscopy (Ortolux II, Leitz Wetzlar, Germany). Oligonucleosome length DNA fragments were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. The remainder of the washed cell suspension (970 μl, 2 × 106/ml) was lysed in 5 mm Tris, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 8.0, at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 15 min. DNA was ethanol precipitated overnight in −20 °C, treated with RNase proteinase K, and loaded on 1.8% agarose gels, and electrophoresed with constant voltage set at 50 V overnight. DNA fragments were visualized with ethidium bromide using a 305-nm UV-light source and photographed using Polaroid type 55 positive-negative film. L1210 cell suspension (4 × 106 cells/ml, 95 μl) were incubated at room temperature with 5 μl of biotinylated fraction VI or native monomeric α-lactalbumin (5 mg/ml, biotinylated according to the manufacturer's instructions), and then washed in PBS with centrifugation at 320 × g for 10 min to remove unbound protein. To detect intracellular protein, cells exposed to biotinylated protein were permeabilized with saponin to allow entry of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin. Cells harvested by centrifugation at 320 × g were fixed by suspension in phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde (4%) (21Sander B. Andersson J. Andersson U. Immunol. Rev. 1991; 119: 65-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) for 5 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS. After washing in 0.1% saponin, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin (1:100 in 0.1% saponin, 100 μl) was added and the cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice in PBS/saponin and once in PBS, mounted on a glass slide and analyzed in a Bio-Rad 1024 laser scanning confocal equipment (Bio-Rad, Hemel-Hempstead, UK) attached to a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope (Nikon, Japan). Human milk samples from four donors were separated into casein and whey and the fractions were tested for apoptosis induction in L1210 leukemia cells. The activity precipitated with casein and further purification was from the casein fraction. Following anion-exchange chromatography, six fractions were collected and tested for apoptosis induction. Fractions I-V completely lacked activity. Fraction VI that eluted with 1 m NaCl contained all of the apoptosis inducing activity (Fig.3 A). PAGE of fraction VI revealed one major band in the 14-kDa region, and additional bands in the molecular mass range of 30, 60, and 100 kDa (Fig. 2 A, inset). After heat treatment (100 °C, 5 min), fraction VI lost its activity (data not shown).Figure 2Anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration.

The molecular weight standards (lane S) are: myosin (M r = 200,000), β-galactosidase (M r = 116, 250), phosphorylase b(M r = 97, 400), bovine serum albumin (M r = 66, 200), ovalbumin (M r = 45,000), carbonic anhydrase (M r = 31,000), soybean trypsin inhibitor (M r = 21,500), and lysozyme (M r = 14,400), respectively. Panel B,size exclusion chromatogram of fraction VI from the ion-exchange column. 100 mg was applied to a Sephadex G-50 column (93 × 2.5 cm) equilibrated with 0.06 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 25 °C. The flow rate was 30 ml/h and the fraction size was 3 ml. Two well separated peaks were obtained. Inset, PAGE of peaks K and L. The molecular weight standards are as in panel A. Panel C, size exclusion chromatogram of fraction VI on a Superose 12 column. Fraction VI (10 mg) was suspended in 500 μl of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 25 °C (flow rate 0.3 ml/min, fraction size 0.5 ml). Peak 1 eluted with the void volume (8 ml), peak 2 eluted at 9.4–11.6 ml corresponding to a molecular mass of 150–400 kDa, peak 3 eluted at 13.8–14.2 ml corresponding to a mass of 30–42 kDa, and peak 4 eluted at 15.0–15.2 ml, corresponding to monomeric α-lactalbumin, 14 kDa.Inset, PAGE of peaks 1–4, monomeric α-lactalbumin (ALA) and fraction VI. The molecular weight standards (S) are as in panel A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fraction VI was applied on a Sephadex G-50 column. Two well separated peaks (K andL, Fig. 2 B) were obtained. Peak K eluted near the void volume and contained all of the apoptotic activity, peak L eluted at the position of a 14-kDa protein and had no effect on cell viability. PAGE of peak K showed one major band at about 14 kDa, and additional bands of about 30, 60, and 100 kDa. Peak L gave only one band at 14 kDa (Fig. 2 B, inset). The different bands of peak K were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis (Table I). The first 30 residues of the band at 14 kDa and the first 9 residues of the 30-kDa band were identical to the N-terminal sequence of human α-lactalbumin, except for residue 6, which was not detected. The main N-terminal sequence of the 60-kDa band and the two 100-kDa bands was also identical to human α-lactalbumin, but some sequencing cycles showed heterogeneity. These results suggested that peak K contained α-lactalbumin complexes of increasing molecular sizeTable IN-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein bands of peaks K and 1–4 and human α-lactalbumin (HLA)SequencesHLA14 kDaLys-Gln-Phe-Thr-Lys-Cys-Glu-Leu-Ser-Gln--Leu-Leu-Lys-Asp-Ile-Asp-Gly-Tyr-Gly-Gly--Ile-Alα-Leu-Pro-Pro-Leu-Ile-Asp-Thr-Met-Peak K14 kDaLys-Gln-Phe-Thr-Lys-Unk-Glu-Leu-Ser-Gln--Leu-Leu-Lys-Asp-Ile-Asp-Gly-Tyr-Gly-Gly--Ile-Alα-Leu-Pro-Pro-Leu-Ile-Asp-Thr-Met-30 kDaLys-Gln-Phe-Thr-Lys-Unk-Glu-Leu-Ser-Gln-60 kDaLys-Gln-Phe-Leu-Lys-Arg Pro Lys Thr Pro100 kDaLys-Gln-Phe-Thr-Unk-Unk-Glu-Leu-Unk-Gln-Asn Ile Ser ValTyr AsnPeak 1Lys-Gln-Phe-Thr-Lys-UnkPeak 2Lys-Gln-Phe-Thr-Lys-UnkPeak 3Lys-Gln-Phe-Thr-Lys-UnkPeak 4Lys-Gln-Phe-Thr-Lys-UnkUnk, indicates unknown; according to published results, residue 6 in α-lactalbumin is cysteine.

The effect on cell viability and induction of DNA fragmentation was compared between the different milk fractions (Fig. 3 A). A rapid reduction of cell viability from >95% to <10% occurred after exposure of the L1210 cells to casein, fraction VI, and peak K (Fig.3 A), and oligonucleosome length DNA fragments were formed in those cells. Whey, casein fractions I-V, and native monomeric α-lactalbumin did not reduce cell viability or induce DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3 A). The localization of fraction VI in the L1210 cells was examined using biotinylated material in confocal microscopy (Fig. 3 B). Fraction VI was shown to bind to the cell surface, to enter the cytoplasm and finally to accumulate in the nuclei of the L1210 cells (Fig. 3 B). Native monomeric α-lactalbumin did not accumulate in the cell nuclei, and only showed surface binding (Fig. 3 B). The apoprotein did not induce DNA fragmentation in L1210 cells. The results above suggested that the active molecular form of α-lactalbumin may have different post-translational modifications and/or different conformation as compared with native α-lactalbumin. Peak K was therefore analyzed by ESI-MS and MALDI-TOF, native α-lactalbumin was used as a control. The estimated molecular mass of the major component (14.088 kDa) was close to the molecular mass of α-lactalbumin calculated from the amino acid sequence (14.078 kDa). The small mass differences ruled out post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation. MALDI-TOF of peak K showed a major peak close to 14 kDa consistent with monomeric α-lactalbumin, but peaks consistent with dimeric and trimeric forms (28 and 42 kDa) were also seen (Fig. 4). These results support the conclusion from ESI-MS of lack of post-translational modifications, and in addition showed the possibility of formation of multimeric forms of α-lactalbumin. These results suggested that the apoptosis inducing activity was dependent on a high molecular weight complex, containing α-lactalbumin. Mass spectrometry ruled out post-translational modifications which indicated that the difference between native, monomeric α-lactalbumin and the apoptosis inducing complex was conformational. To facilitate spectroscopic analysis of the different oligomeric states of α-lactalbumin, fraction VI was applied on a Superose-12 column. Four peaks were obtained (Fig. 2 C). Peak 1 eluted with the void volume, peak 2 eluted as 150–400 kDa, peak 3 as 30–42 kDa, and peak 4 eluted as a 14-kDa protein, at the same position as the native, native α-lactalbumin control. SDS-PAGE of peak 1 showed a faint band larger than 200 kDa, peak 2 had a faint band at 90 kDa, peak 3 had bands at 14, 30, and 66 kDa, and peak 4 gave one band at 14 kDa and one at 31 kDa (Fig. 2 C, inset). The stability of the peaks was investigated by reinjection on the Superose-12 column, after lyophilization and resuspension in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. No dissociation into monomers was detected for the multimers in peaks 1–3. Peak 4 remained a stable monomer (data not shown). N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of peaks 1–4 from the Superose-12 column showed the presence of α-lactalbumin in all peaks. Peak 4 was >95% pure. Peaks 1, 2, and 3 showed a higher background (steps 1–10), but no dominating second sequence suggestive of another protein (Table I). Fraction VI and peaks 1–4 from the Superose-12 column were analyzed by spectroscopic techniques. Monomeric α-lactalbumin in the native or the acid-induced molten globule state were included as controls. By UV absorption spectroscopy α-lactalbumin and fraction VI showed virtually identical sp"

In human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells stably overexpressing ORP150 antisense RNA, ORP150 antigen and transcripts were suppressed to low levels in normoxia and hypoxia, whereas wild-type cells showed induction of ORP150 with oxygen deprivation. Inhibition of ORP150 in antisense transfectants was selective, as hypoxia-mediated enhancement of glucose-regulated protein (GRP) 78 and GRP94 was maintained. However, antisense ORP150 transfectants displayed reduced viability when subjected to hypoxia, compared with wild-type and sense-transfected HEK cells. In contrast, diminished levels of ORP150 had no effect on cytotoxicity induced by other stimuli, including oxygen-free radicals and sodium arsenate. Although cellular ATP content was similar in hypoxia, compared with ORP150 antisense transfectants and wild-type HEK cells, suppression of ORP150 expression was associated with accelerated apoptosis. Hypoxia-mediated cell death in antisense HEK transfectants did not cause an increase in caspase activity or in cytoplasmic cytochromec antigen. A well recognized inducer of apoptosis in HEK cells, staurosporine, caused increased caspase activity and cytoplasmic cytochrome c levels in both wild-type and antisense cells. These data indicate that ORP150 has an important cytoprotective role in hypoxia-induced cellular perturbation and that ORP150-associated inhibition of apoptosis may involve mechanisms distinct from those triggered by other apoptotic stimuli.

Cellular adaptations to environmental oxygen deprivation constitute an important protective pathway for the host response to ischemia (1Harkness R.A. Acta Paediatr. 1997; 86: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). One essential component of this response includes increased dependence on anaerobic metabolism as an energy source (2Hori O.

Enhanced glycolysis is facilitated by hypoxia-mediated up-regulation of the noninsulin-dependent glucose transporter-1 and several enzymes involved in glycolytic metabolism by a mechanism that involves hypoxia-inducible factor-1. Another facet of the cellular biosynthetic response to hypoxia involves expression of diverse oxygen-regulated proteins (ORPs) 1The abbreviations used are: ORP, oxygen-regulated protein; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GRP, glucose-regulated protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney.

These stress proteins participate in many aspects of cellular functions, and their characterization provides important clues as to means through which cells sustain hypoxic injury. Among cell populations in the central nervous system, astrocytes are programmed to withstand hypoxic and ischemic stress, compared with more vulnerable neurons (5Pechan P.A. Chowdhury K. Seifert W. Neuroreport. 1992; 3: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because of their strategic location, astrocytes are thought to have neurotrophic roles in response to cell stress, as observed in inflammation (6Frei K. Malipiero U.V. Leist T.P. Zinkernagel R.M. Schwab M.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), trauma (7Coyle J.T. Puttfarchen P.

Stroke. 1995; 26: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). For this reason, we have characterized proteins whose expression is modulated in astrocytes subjected to oxygen deprivation. We have previously identified several stress proteins in hypoxic cultured astrocytes; polypeptides with molecular masses corresponding to 94, 78, 33, and 28 kDa proved to be identical to GRP94, GRP78/Bip, heme oxygenase-1, and HSP28, respectively (2Hori O.

A major hypoxia-inducible stress protein with a mass of 150 kDa was cloned and characterized as ORP150 (9Ikeda J. Kaneda S. Kuwabara K. Ogawa S. Kobayashi T. Matsumoto M. Yura T. Yanagi H. Biochem.

ORP150 is likely identical to a previously described polypeptide with a mass of 170 kDa, observed as a band with the latter mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in hypoxic Chinese hamster ovary cells (11Lin H. Masso-Welch P. Di Y.-P. Cai J. Shen J. Subjeck J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The localization of ORP150, GRP94, and GRP78/Bip (12Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1986; 46: 959-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar) to the endoplasmic reticulum suggests that hypoxia induces a stress response whose focal point may be in this organelle. Because of the striking induction of ORP150 expression in cultured astrocytes (10Kuwabara K. Matsumoto M. Ikeda J. Hori O. Ogawa S. Maeda Y. Kitagawa K. Imuta N. Kinoshita T. Stern D.M. Yanagi H.

Yanagi H. Matsumoto M. Ogawa S. Kitamura Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1930-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) exposed to hypoxia, we speculated that this protein might have a cytoprotective role in response to cell stress associated with oxygen deprivation. To address this issue, we have established a cell line stably transfected to overexpress ORP150 antisense RNA in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. Antisense-transfected HEK cells display increased vulnerability to hypoxia, with loss of cell viability due to apoptosis, compared with wild-type and sense-transfected cultures. These data indicate that ORP150 has a pivotal role in cytoprotective cellular mechanisms triggered by oxygen deprivation. The vector pCAGGS, provided by Dr. Jun-ichi Miyazaki (14Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar), contains a neomycin resistance gene linked to the thymidine kinase promoter. To construct the ORP150 antisense/sense vector, a fragment encoding almost the entire human ORP150 cDNA, as well as some 3′-untranslated sequence (residues 86–3093) (9Ikeda J. Kaneda S. Kuwabara K. Ogawa S. Kobayashi T. Matsumoto M. Yura T. Yanagi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This was accomplished with amplicons prepared using primers with EcoRI linkers 5′-cgaattcctcGAGGCAAGAGGGGCACTATG-3′ and 5′-gggaattctcGAGGTGGGGGTTATA-GTTCG-3′ (EcoRI linker underlined). After sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products, the orientation of the inserted ORP150 cDNA fragment was confirmed by both restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing."

To understand the mechanism of interaction of these two classes of proteins affinity chromatography and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies were performed.

In the presence of periplasmic proteins also PBP1A was specifically bound. At least five different non-PBPs showed specificity for MltA-Sepharose. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of one of these proteins could be obtained, and the corresponding gene was mapped at 40 min on the E. coligenome. This MltA-interactingprotein, named MipA, in addition binds to PBP1B, a bifunctional murein transglycosylase/transpeptidase. SPR studies with PBP1B immobilized to ampicillin-coated sensor chips showed an oligomerization of PBP1B that may indicate a dimerization. Simultaneous application of MipA and MltA onto a PBP1B sensor chip surface resulted in the formation of a trimeric complex. The dissociation constant was determined to be about 10−6m.

The cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria is stabilized by a thin, monolayered exoskeleton consisting of the cross-linked biopolymer murein (peptidoglycan) (1Glauner B. Höltje J.-V. Schwarz U. J.

By forming a bag-shaped structure the murein netting, glycan strands cross-linked by peptides, completely encloses the cell. Different models for the growth mechanism of this stress-bearing bacterial exoskeleton, called sacculus, have been put forward (2Park J.T. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. 2nd Ed.

Despite the discrepancies in some details, the models all agree on one point, namely that murein synthases and hydrolases have to cooperate with each other to allow for safe insertion of new material into the growing sacculus. Specific protein-protein interactions between a number of enzymes involved in the metabolism of the murein sacculus have been demonstrated by affinity chromatography (7Romeis T. Höltje J.-V. J.

These findings may reflect an in vivo assembly of murein synthases and murein hydrolases into a multienzyme complex that has been named a “yin yang complex” (3Höltje J.-V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Such a murein synthesizing machinery has been proposed to facilitate the coordination of the action of the different enzymes involved in enlargement and septation of the murein sacculus.

Amplification of DNA regions was accomplished by PCR with commercially synthesized oligonucleotides (MWG Biotec) as indicated below. Reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 10 μl of PCR reaction buffer (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany), 1 μl of the Kohara phage lysate, 1 μl of primer V, 1 μl of primer H, and 0.8 μl of dNTP solution to give a final concentration of 200 mm dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP. After the addition of 5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) at 94 °C, 30 cycles of the following steps were performed: 1 min at 92 °C, 1 min at 52 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. The products were purified with the help of a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). To construct plasmids for the overproduction of MltA and of MipA, respectively, the pBR322 derivative pJFK118EH that carries a kanamycin resistance marker and the inducible tac promoter (26Bishop R.E. Weiner J.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 114: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was used. In the case of MltA the gene was amplified by PCR from the lysate of the Kohara lambda phage 459 (38Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) that carries the mltA gene (19Lommatzsch J. Templin M.F. Kraft A.R. Vollmer W. Höltje J.-V. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5465-5470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An appropriate restriction site was inserted by using the oligonucleotides mltA-V (5′-AAGGAATTCATGAAAGGACGTTGGGTAAAGTACC-3′) and mltA-H (5′-AATGGATCCTCAGCCGCTAAAGACGTTACCTGCG-3′). The PCR product was purified, restricted with EcoRI and BamHI, and ligated into the vector that was linearized with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting plasmid was named pMAT. Construction of an inducible expression plasmid for MipA followed the same strategy as for MltA except for using the Kohara lambda phage 331 (38Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) that carries themipA gene and the oligonucleotides mip-V (5′-AGGGAATTCTAATTATGACCAAACTCAAACTTCTGGC-3′) and mip-H (5′-TTTGTCGACCATTATCAGAATTTGTAGG-3′) to introduce anEcoRI and a SalI restriction site. The purified and restricted PCR product was inserted into pJFK118EH cut withEcoRI and SalI yielding plasmid pWV3. Cells were cooled down when an absorbance at 578 nm (A 578) of 0.5–0.6 was reached and harvested by centrifugation (7,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). All the following steps were performed at 4 °C. The pellet was, unless indicated otherwise, resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and DNase (10 μg/ml) were added before the cells were broken in a French press at 16,000 pounds/square inch. Membranes were spun down (100,000 ×g, 45 min), and proteins were extracted by resuspending the membranes in Triton X-100 extraction buffer (10 mm Tris maleate, pH 6.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100) and stirring for 12 h. Unsolubilized membrane debris was removed by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 45 min), and the supernatant containing the solubilized proteins was stored at −20 °C. Periplasmic proteins were obtained according to the method of Witholt et al. (30Witholt B. Boekhout M. Brock M. Kingma J. van Heerikhuizen H. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 74: 160-170Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In order to obtain high amounts of MltA MC1061/pmAT was grown in a 200-liter fermenter at 37 °C in LB medium. At an A 578 of 0.15 expression of mltA was induced for 110 min by the addition of 1 mm IPTG. All following steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells (325 g wet weight) were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 1000 ml of 10 mm Tris maleate buffer, pH 5.2, and mechanically broken by two passages through a French pressure cell at 12,000 pounds/square inch. Cell debris was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h and the pellet divided in aliquots of 30 g for storage at −70 °C. To release membrane-associated proteins an aliquot was resuspended in 300 ml of 10 mm Tris maleate, 0.02% NaN3, pH 5.2, containing 1 m NaCl and stirred for 2 h. After centrifugation (see above) the pellet was resuspended and stirred for 16 h in 300 ml of the same buffer but containing 0.5 mNaCl and 1% Triton X-100. Solubilized proteins were separated from the membranes by centrifugation (see above). The Triton X-100 extract was dialyzed first against 10 mm Tris maleate, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 0.02% NaN3, 1% Triton X-100, pH 5.2, containing 150 mm NaCl and then against the same buffer but containing 70 mm NaCl. A precipitate that was formed was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 55,000 ×g. Since the isoelectric point of MltA is around pH 8.5, the cationic specific CM-Sepharose was chosen for the first purification step. A column containing 300 ml of CM-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) was washed with 3 column volumes of 100 mm NaOH and then with 5 column volumes of 10 mmTris maleate, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 0.02% NaN3, 1% Triton X-100, pH 5.2, containing 1 mNaCl. Before application of the sample the column was equilibrated with the above mentioned buffer containing 70 mm NaCl. The sample (300 ml of Triton X-100 extract, see above, 1200 mg of protein) was applied at a flow rate of 60 ml/h. After a washing step with 630 ml of equilibration buffer, two linear salt gradients were used to elute the proteins. A gradient from 70 to 350 mm NaCl in 1400 ml of 10 mm Tris maleate, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 0.02% NaN3, 1% Triton X-100, pH 5.2, was followed by a gradient from 350 to 1 m NaCl in the same buffer. Murein hydrolase activity was determined by the release of soluble muropeptides from radioactively labeled murein sacculi as has been described (31Kusser W. Schwarz U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 103: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). MltA eluted in 18 fractions (10 ml each) with its peak at 210 mm NaCl. The pooled fractions were dialyzed against buffer B containing 200 mm NaCl. As a second and final purification step, a Blue-Sepharose chromatography was applied. A Blue-Sepharose (Cibacron CL-6B-Sepharose; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) column (30 ml) was washed with 90 ml of 6 m urea and 120 ml of 10 mm Tris maleate, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 0.02% NaN3, 1% Triton X-100, pH 5.2, containing 1m NaCl. The dialyzed sample obtained by CM-Sepharose was diluted with equilibration buffer to a final salt concentration of 120 mm prior to its application at a flow rate of 15 ml/h onto the Blue-Sepharose column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris maleate, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 0.02% NaN3, 1% Triton X-100, pH 5.2, containing 120 mm NaCl. The column was washed at a flow rate of 20 ml/h with 350 ml of equilibration buffer. Bound proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 30 ml/h with a salt gradient from 120 mm to 1 mNaCl in 300 ml of equilibration buffer followed by a gradient to 2m NaCl. MltA eluted in 10 fractions (2.5 ml each) with highest activity around 700 mm NaCl. The fractions containing MltA were pooled and dialyzed against equilibration buffer containing 200 mm NaCl. The yield was 20 mg of protein with a specific activity of 7580 units/mg. One unit of MltA activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 μg of murein in 10 min at 30 °C at the indicated buffer conditions. The enzyme preparation (0.44 mg/ml) did not lose activity after storage for 4 months when kept at 6 °C. MipA was isolated from the MltA deletion mutant E. coli LT12 harboring pWV3. Cells were grown in LB (10 liters) at 30 °C and induced by the addition of 0.05 mm IPTG at an A 578 of 0.15. Growth was stopped when an A 578 of 0.7 was reached. All following steps were performed at 4 °C. After resuspending the cells (20 g wet weight) in 10 mm Tris maleate, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, pH 6.8, they were broken in a French pressure cell as described above. Membrane-associated proteins were removed by extraction with 1 m NaCl in the above mentioned buffer and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 ×g. The pellet (8 g wet weight) was resuspended in 50 ml of 10 mm Tris maleate, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 0.02% NaN3, pH 6.8, containing 500 mm NaCl and 2% Triton X-100 and stirred for 16 h to solubilize the membrane proteins. The extract was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 50 mm sodium chloride and 0.02% NaN3 prior to Q-Sepharose chromatography. A Q-Sepharose column (16 ml) was washed with 12 volumes of 1 m acetic acid and 5 volumes of deionized water before equilibration with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 50 mmsodium chloride, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.02% NaN3 at a flow rate of 10 ml/h. After applying the dialyzed membrane extract, MipA was eluted during isocratic washing with equilibration buffer. The fractions of 10 ml were analyzed by SDS-12% PAGE (31Kusser W. Schwarz U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 103: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue. The yield was 29.6 mg of purified MipA present in the two fractions with the highest concentration of MipA. PBP1A and -1B were purified by affinity chromatography on moenomycin-agarose followed by ion-exchange chromatography. For immobilization of moenomycin to an agarose matrix, moenomycin (kindly provided by Dr. Aretz from Hoechst-Marion-Roussel) was dissolved in methanol in a final concentration of about 30 mg/ml. The methanolic moenomycin solution was then mixed with Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The gel was filtrated and extensively washed with methanol to remove excess moenomycin. Free functional groups of the Affi-Gel were blocked by incubation of the gel with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 3 h at 4 °C. About 30 mg of moenomycin could be coupled to 1 ml of Affi-Gel suspension. The moenomycin-agarose was filled into a column (10 ml) and equilibrated with extraction buffer (10 mm Tris maleate, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2% Triton X-100, pH 6.8). A Triton X-100 extract of E. coliAT1325 (2 g of protein; 20 mg/ml) was applied to the column at a flow rate of 10 ml/h. After a washing step with 100 ml of extraction buffer, elution of the proteins that were bound to the meonomycin column was performed with 100 μm moenomycin in extraction buffer. The fractions were analyzed for PBPs as described previously (33Schwarz U. Seeger K. Wengenmayer F. Strecker H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1981; 10: 107-109Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although it was not possible to separate PBP1A, -1B, and -1C from each other, almost all other proteins including other PBPs were effectively removed by this specific chromatography step. PBP1A and PBP1B could then be separated using an additional purification by ion-exchange chromatography. Accordingly, the fractions containing PBP1A and PBP1B were pooled, dialyzed against 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, and applied onto a 1-ml Highload Mono S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing the column with 5 ml of dialysis buffer the proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using a linear gradient (20 ml) of 25 mmto 1 m NaCl in the same buffer. PBP1A eluted at a salt concentration of 120–290 mm (0.75 ml; about 5 μg/ml) and PBP1B at 260–480 mm (1.25 ml; about 3 μg/ml). PBP1C was not found in the eluted fractions, probably because of precipitation during dialysis. The purified PBPs were dialyzed against HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100), pH 7.4, and stored at −20 °C. As a matrix to immobilize proteins, CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used. Purified proteins were coupled basically following the instructions of the manufacturer. Coupling of the proteins (between 8 and 12 mg) was done overnight at 6 °C with gentle agitation in 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.8 g of activated Sepharose. After washing the material the remaining coupling sites were blocked with Tris by incubation in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0, overnight at 6 °C. The gel suspension was then washed alternating with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0, and 0.1 msodium acetate buffer, pH 4.8, containing 500 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100, and finally resuspended in 10 mm Tris maleate, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, pH 6.8, containing 50 mm NaCl and the same concentration of Triton X-100 as present in the extract to be applied (1% for membrane proteins, 0.28% for a mixture of membrane and periplasmatic proteins). The Sepharose was filled into a 3-ml column and equilibrated with the same buffer. As control material (Tris-Sepharose) one batch of activated Sepharose was treated identically except that no protein was added. The affinity chromatography was performed at 6 °C. After application of the dialyzed extract containing 50 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 1 ml/h (3.5 ml/h if a membrane extract containing periplasmic proteins was applied), the column was washed at 4.5 ml/h with 70 ml of 10 mm Tris maleate, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, pH 6.8, containing 50 mm NaCl and 0.05% Triton X-100. The low Triton concentration of 0.05% that is sufficient to keep the PBPs in solution was chosen to allow monitoring of the eluates by UV detection. The retained proteins were eluted at 4.5 ml/h by two successive salt steps with 54 ml of 10 mmTris maleate, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, pH 6.8, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.05% Triton X-100, and with 54 ml of the same buffer containing 1m NaCl and 0.05% Triton X-100. A modified method was used to detect non-PBPs with high sensitivity. For this, the extract was applied with 400 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 1 ml/h. After washing the column at 4.5 ml/h with 70 ml of 10 mm Tris maleate, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, pH 6.8, containing 400 mm NaCl and 0.05% Triton X-100, the retained proteins were eluted at 4.5 ml/h with the same buffer but containing 2 m NaCl and 0.05% Triton X-100. The size of the fractions was 1.5 ml. The fractions were stored at −20 °C. PBPs were labeled using the 125I-labeled Bolton and Hunter derivative of ampicillin, prepared as described (33Schwarz U. Seeger K. Wengenmayer F. Strecker H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1981; 10: 107-109Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Two microliters of the labeled ampicillin derivative were incubated with a 30-μl aliquot of the sample for 30 min at 37 °C. The PBP-penicillin complexes (34Spratt B.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 72: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) were separated by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and visualized by autoradiography as described (33Schwarz U. Seeger K. Wengenmayer F. Strecker H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1981; 10: 107-109Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The free amino group in the side chain of ampicillin was utilized for the immobilization of this β-lactam to a CM5 sensor chip via amino coupling. The coupling of ampicillin was performed according to the standardN-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide procedure recommended by BIAcore. The CM5 matrix of the sensor chip was activated by injecting 70 μl of a 1:1 mixture of 400 μm N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride and 100 μm N-hydroxysuccinimide at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. This was followed by applying 150 μl of an ampicillin solution (10 mg/ml in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.6). Activated functional groups on the sensor chip not saturated by ampicillin were blocked by injection of 70 μl of 1m ethanolamine. Immobilization of PBPs was routinely performed at the rather high temperature of 35 °C because this increased the yield of immobilization when a low concentration of protein had to be used. The binding of the PBPs to the ampicillin matrix was stopped when the desired level of about 1000–3000 RU was reached, and the chips were rinsed with 10 mm Tris maleate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1m NaCl and 2% Triton X-100. Remaining free ampicillin was digested by the injection of 120 μl of β-lactamase (50 units/ml). Purified MltA (see above) was immobilized to BIAcore CM5TM sensor chips by direct coupling via free amino groups following the recommendations of the manufacturer. Active groups that remained unsaturated after immobilization of MltA were blocked by the injection of 70 μl of 1m ethanolamine. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies were performed with a BIAcoreTM2000 (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). In order to determine the initial conditions for binding of the analyte to the immobilized ligand, qualitative experiments were performed prior to the quantitative analysis of the binding constants. If not stated otherwise the experiments were routinely done in HBS buffer, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The injection volume of the analyte (about 30 μg of protein/ml) varied between 60 and 150 μl. Regeneration of the sensor chip was achieved by injecting 30 μl of regeneration buffer (10 mm Tris maleate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1m NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, pH 6.8). The kinetic parameters of the protein-protein interactions in the BIAcoreTM system were determined by equilibrium analysis. During equilibrium the following Equation 1 is valid (R eq, response at equilibration; R max, maximal response;K a, equilibrium association constant; C, concentration).dR/dt=kaC(Rmax−Req)−kdReq=0Equation 1 Rearrangement and replacing the expressionk a/k da = K ayields the final Equation 2.Req/C=KARmax−KARcqEquation 2 The value of R eq can be obtained either directly from the sensorgrams or can be calculated by the BIAevaluation software. A graphical representation ofR eq/C againstR eq yields a straight line with the slope −K a. This graph is equivalent to a standard Scatchard plot. R max can be calculated from the intersection with the x axis. Since the equation mentioned above is only valid if the formation of the complex on the surface of the sensorchip is kinetically controlled and not limited by transportation effects, high flow rates and low levels of immobilized ligand were used for the kinetic measurements. The amount of the immobilized ligand was in the range of 200 to 1000 RU. For each set of experiments three different amounts of protein were immobilized in three of the lanes of the sensorchip; the fourth lane was used as a control and contained only a β-lactamase-digested ampicillin surface (see above). The analyte was varied in the range of 12.3 nm to 24.6 μm. Volumes of 150 μl were applied using the kinject function of the BIAcoreTM system. During these experiments the temperature was kept constant at 20 °C and the flow rate at 10 μl/min. To test that the observed binding of the analyte to the immobilized ligand was independent of mass transfer, some experiments were also performed at a higher flow rate of 40 μl/min. After injection of the analyte the dissociation phase was recorded for 30 min. During this time the system was washed with HBS buffer at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The evaluation of the sensorgrams was performed with the BIAevaluation program version 2.1 (BIAcore). The sensorgrams were imported into this program, and the base lines of each flow cell were normalized to zero as was done for the time at the start of the injection. Afterwards the sensorgram of the control lane was subtracted from the sensorgrams of the flow cells containing immobilized protein to remove the effects of unspecific binding to the ampicillin matrix. The R eq values of the equilibrium were determined at a time point shortly before the end of the injection where the sensorgrams had reached equilibrium. Protein determination was according to the bicinchoninic acid method described by Smith et al. (22Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K.

Absorption of light by rhodopsin results in a decrease of [cGMP] within photoreceptor outer segments (1Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10711-10714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This leads to the closure of cGMP-gated cation channels and reduction in Ca2+ influx (reviewed in Refs. 2Polans A. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Trends.

In addition, Ca2+ is continuously extruded from the photoreceptor cells by a light-independent Na+/Ca2+-K+exchanger (4Schnetkamp P.P.M. Tucker J.E. Szerencsei R.T. Am. J.

In humans, the array is located on the short arm of chromosome 6 (p21.1). A defect in the GCAP1 gene (Y99C) has recently been linked to autosomal dominant cone dystrophy (17Payne A.M. Downes S.M.

The Y99C mutation has been shown to alter Ca2+ sensitivity of GCAP1, leading to the constitutive stimulating activity of GC1 at high [Ca2+], where normal GCAP1 inhibits it. GCAP1 has been localized to rod and cone photoreceptor outer segments in the retina of various species (8Gorczyca W.A. Polans A.S. Surgucheva I. Subbaraya I. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

In humans, the most intense labeling with anti-GCAP1 antibodies has been observed in cone outer segments, and weaker labeling has been observed in rod outer segments (8Gorczyca W.A. Polans A.S.

Since human rods are unaffected in autosomal dominant cone dystrophy, GCAP2 or a third GCAP-like Ca2+-binding protein may substitute in part for the mutant GCAP1, or rods are less sensitive to elevated cGMP levels (18Sokal I.

In this paper, we describe molecular cloning and characterization of a third form of GCAP, GCAP3, which by sequence similarity appears to be more closely related to GCAP1 than to GCAP2. This novel isoform provides additional evidence of complex regulations of cGMP production/degradation in photoreceptor cells from different species and of the existence of an evolving family of GCAP genes. GCAP3 was amplified from a λgt10 human retina cDNA library in two overlapping fragments using primers designed based on the expressed sequence tag clone (a364442 deposited A. R. Kerlavage, The Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, MD). The 3′-end was amplified with primers K3 (5′-TGT GAG TCA AGA TGG GGA ATG GCA, gene-specific primer) and λgt10S (5′-AGC AAG TTC AGC CTG GTA AG). After heating at 95 °C for 5 min, the reaction was cycled 35 times through 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 2 min. A secondary nested PCR amplification was carried out with primers K4 (5′-GGC AAA TCT ATA GCT GGT GAT CAGA) and λgt10S as described above. The 5′-end was amplified following the same PCR conditions with primers K6 (5′-GGC CTT CTG ATT CAG ACC TTG CAG, gene-specific primer) and λgt10S. At least two amplification products for each PCR were subcloned into pCRII-TOPO vector (TOPO TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen) and sequenced by dyedeoxyterminator sequencing (ABI-Prism, Perkin-Elmer). Total RNA was isolated from human retinal tissue, obtained from The Wisconsin Eye Bank at the University of Wisconsin, or from bovine retinas (Schenk Packing Co., Inc, Stanwood, WA) using the Ultraspec RNA isolation system (Biotecx, Inc.). mRNA was purified from total RNA using the mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of 0.66 m formaldehyde, and transferred to nylon membranes. Hybridization with a32P-labeled human GCAP3 cDNA (1 kb) was performed in 40% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, 1 m NaCl, 35 μg/ml of herring sperm DNA in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Hybridizations were washed at room temperature in 0.3 mNaCl, 0.03 m sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS for 30 min followed by 30 min at 50 °C in 0.015 m NaCl, 0.0015 m sodium citrate, and 0.1% SDS. A human multiple-tissue Northern blot containing 2 μg of poly(A)+RNA from various human tissues (CLONTECHLaboratories, Inc.) was hybridized with the 32P-labeled GCAP3 or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. The full coding sequence for GCAP3 was amplified from human retina cDNA by PCR with primers K9 (5′-CAT ATG GGG AAT GGC AAA TCT ATA GCTG), which placed anNdeI site on the ATG, and K10 (5′-CTA GTG ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG CTT CAT TTT CAC CTT CCC TAG ACC AG), which added a His6tag at the 3′-end. PCR was performed using a denaturing temperature of 94 °C for 30 s and an annealing and extension temperature of 68 °C for 2 min through 35 cycles. The PCR product was cloned in pCRII-TOPO vector (TOPO TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen) and sequenced by dyedeoxyterminator sequencing (ABI-Prism, Perkin-Elmer). AnXbaI–HindIII fragment was inserted between corresponding sites of the pFastBac1 expression vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). Sf9 insect cells were transfected with the recombinant baculovirus shuttle vector using cationic liposome-mediated transfection (CellFECTIN reagent; Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The coding sequence for GCAP3 was amplified from human retina cDNA by PCR with primers K9 (5′-CAT ATG GGG AAT GGC AAA TCT ATA GCTG), which placed anNdeI site on the ATG, and K20 (5′-CTA CTT CAT TTT CAC CTT CCC TAGA), using a denaturing temperature of 94 °C for 30 s and an annealing and extension temperature of 68 °C for 2 min through 35 cycles. The PCR product was cloned in pCRII-TOPO vector and sequenced by dyedeoxyterminator sequencing. GCAP3 was inserted as a fragmentNdeI–BamHI in pET-3b vector (Novagen). GCAP3 was expressed in BL21 bacteria after induction with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The bacteria were sonicated for 5 min in water, and the extract was centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet containing the inclusion bodies was solubilized in 8 m urea, 80 mm β-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 90 min at room temperature. The insoluble material was centrifuged for 60 min at 340,000 × g. The supernatant was dialyzed against water. Rabbit anti-GCAP3 polyclonal antibodies (UW84) were raised in New Zealand White rabbits by subcutaneous immunization with 100 μg of GCAP3 expressed inE. coli mixed with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant (Cocalico Biologicals, Reanstown, PA). Animals were given booster injections at 1–2-week intervals with 50 μg of GCAP3 mixed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. UW14 (anti-GCAP1) and UW50 (anti-GCAP2) were prepared following the same procedure (8Gorczyca W.A. Polans A.S. Surgucheva I. Subbaraya I. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22029-22036Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 23Otto-Bruc A. Buczylko J. Surgucheva I. Subbaraya I. Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Crabb J. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Baehr W.

For UW50, 2 ml of rabbit serum UW50 diluted 1:1 in 10 mm1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)-methylamino]propane, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl, were depleted of antibodies cross-reacting with GCAP1 by filtering through a GCAP1-Sepharose column (1.5 ml; 8 mg of protein/ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B). The flow-through was then applied on a GCAP3-Sepharose (1.5 ml; 8 mg of protein/ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B) to remove GCAP3 cross-reacting antibodies. The anti-GCAP2 antibodies present in the flow-through were finally purified on GCAP2-Sepharose (1.5 ml; 8 mg of protein/ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B) and eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5. For UW14, rabbit serum UW14 was depleted of cross-reacting antibodies by passing through GCAP2 and GCAP3 columns and then purified on GCAP1-Sepharose. For UW84, the flow-through of successive GCAP1 and GCAP2 columns loaded with rabbit serum UW84 was purified on GCAP3-Sepharose. UW87 antiserum was prepared against a 20-amino acid peptide, amide-CETDSSKSPDKAGLGKVKMK prepared by Quality Controlled Biochemicals Inc., conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The sequence is derived from the C-terminal region unique to GCAP3. The peptide also contains the N-terminal Cys to facilitate conjugation to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and CNBr-activated Sepharose. UW87 antiserum was purified on GCAP3-Sepharose. Microtitration plates were coated for 1 h at 37 °C with purified GCAP1 or GCAP2 at about 0.8 μg/well. After coating, plates were blocked with PBS, 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, 0.05% Tween, anti-GCAP1 (UW14), anti-GCAP2 (UW50), or anti-GCAP3 (UW84), antibodies (0.45 μg) were added to the plates with increasing amounts of competitors (GCAP1, GCAP2, and GCAP3) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, 0.05% Tween, the plates were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Promega) for 30 min at room temperature. The plates were read at 405 nm after the addition of p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The GC assays were performed using [α-32P]GTP and washed ROS or using recombinant GC1 and GC2 as described previously (23Otto-Bruc A. Buczylko J. Surgucheva I. Subbaraya I. Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Crabb J. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4295-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). GCAP1 and GCAP3 proteins used in the GC assays were purified from insect cells on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid columns in nondenaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). [Ca2+]free was adjusted by EGTA/Ca buffer as described previously (8Gorczyca W.A. Polans A.S. Surgucheva I. Subbaraya I. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22029-22036Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Bovine GC1 (obtained from Dr. R. Sharma) and human GC2 (obtained from Dr. A. Dizhoor) were cloned into pVL941 and expressed in High Five insect cells as described previously (8Gorczyca W.A. Polans A.S. Surgucheva I. Subbaraya I. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22029-22036Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested; washed with 10 mm1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)-methylamino]propane, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, and resuspended at ∼0.5 mg/ml for the GC assays. The results of GC assays are an average of two determinations. Similar results were obtained from at least three different sets of experiments performed in duplicate. Due to the high sensitivity of the GC system (for details, see Ref. 8Gorczyca W.A. Polans A.S. Surgucheva I. Subbaraya I. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22029-22036Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), the absolute values of one series occasionally varied from another by 10–20%, but with preservation of the ratio between activity of two different preparations (for example, the activity of GCAP1 versus GCAP3). Because only a limited number of the test samples could be performed in a single assay (maximally 24 samples) that always included a relevant control (low, high [Ca2+]free and with or without GCAP1), the results are shown without S.D. values. The IC50 and EC50 with S.D. were calculated from these independent experiments. Genomic Southern blots containingEcoRI-digested DNA from various species were purchased from BIOS laboratories (New Haven, CT). The blots were probed with32P-labeled human GCAP3 cDNA insert. The hybridization and washing procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, hybridization was carried out overnight with 107 cpm/ml of labeled GCAP3 cDNA at 65 °C in 6× SSC (0.9 m NaCl, 0.09 m sodium citrate), 1% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution (0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% Ficoll, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), 200 μg/ml sheared, denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 10% dextran sulfate. The washing solution contained 1× SSC (0.15 m sodium chloride, 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.5% SDS and was performed at room temperature and at 35 °C for 10 min each. The blots were finally exposed to Kodak XAR5 film in the presence of intensifying screens. A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone containing the entire GCAP3 gene was purchased from Genome Systems, Inc. BAC DNA was prepared using the Qiagen method for low copy plasmids (Qiagen). Introns b and c of the GCAP3 gene were amplified with exon-specific primers from human genomic DNA with Taq(Promega) or Expand (Boehringer Mannheim) DNA polymerases. Amplified introns were cloned into pCR2.1 vector and sequenced with universal primers using a model LI-COR 4000L automatic DNA sequencer. The junctions of intron a were directly sequenced from the BAC clone using fluorescent chain terminators and an ABI automatic sequencer. PCR was performed with 2 μg of BAC DNA, and 20 pmol of primer. The cycle conditions (MJ cycler, MJ Research) were 95 °C for 5 min (96 °C for 20 s, cooling at 1 °C/s to 50 °C, 50 °C for 15 s, heating at 1 °C/s to 60 °C, 60 °C for 4 min). The cycle shown in parentheses was repeated 49 times. The length of intron a was estimated from EcoRI-digested fragments of the BAC clone, probed after Southern blotting with DNA containing exons 1 and 2 (results not shown). Genomic sequences upstream of ATG and downstream of the translational stop codon were obtained by direct BAC sequencing with sequence-specific primers. The chromosomal location of the human GCAP3 gene was identified by PCR with primers 654 (5′-ATG GGG AAT GGC AAA TCT ATAG) and 655 (5′-CGT GTC AAA GGT ATT ATA AAC TTG) using human-hamster somatic cell hybrids (BIOS Laboratories) as templates. The PCR amplification was performed as described previously (24Pettenati M.J. Rao P.N. Hayworth-Hodge R. Brewer G. Ross J. Nucleic Acid Hybridization: Essential Techniques. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 81-109Google Scholar). For subchromosomal localization, the GCAP3 cDNA probe was labeled with biotin-14-dATP using the BioNick labeling system (Life Technologies). The probe was hybridized to prometaphase chromosomes prepared from chromosomal normal peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained by standard clinical laboratory techniques. Fluorescence in situhybridization (FISH) was performed as described previously (24Pettenati M.J. Rao P.N. Hayworth-Hodge R. Brewer G. Ross J. Nucleic Acid Hybridization: Essential Techniques. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 81-109Google Scholar) with some modifications. Pretreatment was performed with 0.1 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) in 0.3 m NaCl, 0.03 msodium citrate (2× SSC). The probe (200 ng) was combined with Cot-1 DNA, precipitated with ethanol, and hybridized to metaphase chromosomes for 72 h. Postwashing was done at 45 °C with a 5-min incubation in 50% formamide, 2× SSC followed by a 2-min rinse in 2× SSC and PBS. The labeled probe was detected after two layers of avidin-fluorescein (ONCOR, Gaithersburg, MD). Slides were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vysis, Downer's Grove, IL) diluted 1:1 with antifade (Vectashield, Vector, Burlingame, CA). Hybridized G band-like metaphase cells were obtained and viewed using the M-FISH version 3.012 software program in the VYSIS QUIPS Imaging system. An expressed sequence tag (GenBank™ accession number AA364442) with homology to GCAPs was found by searching data bases with GCAP2 sequence using the TFASTA program (GCG Package). Primers designed within this expressed sequence tag were used to amplify the 5′- and 3′-ends of GCAP3 in two overlapping fragments by PCR employing a human retina cDNA library. A contiguous cDNA comprising the complete coding sequence, suitable for expression, was amplified using N- and C-terminal primers. The first ATG present on the cDNA matched the Kozak consensus sequence (25Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4148) Google Scholar) for initiation of translation with a G residue following the ATG and a purine, preferably A, three nucleotides upstream (Fig. 3). The cDNA encodes a protein of 209 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 23.8 kDa (Fig. 1). The sequence shows a putative site for N-myristoylation at Gly2 and three putative EF hands involved in Ca2+ binding. The amino acid sequence of GCAP3 shares closest homology with the human GCAP1, displaying 58% similarity and 45% sequence identity (Fig. 1, dendrogram). GCAP3 is an acidic protein with an isoelectric point of 4.8. This value is similar to those calculated for GCAP1 (pK a = 4.1) and GCAP2 (pK a = 4.5).Figure 3Partial gene sequence, exon/intron junctions of human GCAPs, and chromosomal localization of human GCAP3.

https://openalex.org/W2053735133,"Villin is an early marker of epithelial cells from the digestive and urogenital tracts. Indeed villin is expressed in the stem cells and the proliferative cells of the intestinal crypts. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms and particularly those responsible for the restricted tissue specificity, a large genomic region of the mouse villin gene has been analyzed. A 9-kilobase (kb) regulatory region of the mouse villin gene (harboring 3.5 kb upstream the transcription start site and 5.5 kb of the first intron) was able to promote transcription of the LacZ reporter gene in the small and large intestines of transgenic mice, in a transmissible manner, and thus efficiently directed subsequent β-galactosidase expression in epithelial cells along the entire crypt-villus axis. In the kidney, the transgene was also expressed in the epithelial cells of the proximal tubules but is likely sensitive to the site of integration. A construct lacking the first intron restricted β-galactosidase expression to the small intestine. Thus, the 9-kb genomic region contains the necessary cis-acting elements to recapitulate the tissue-specific expression pattern of the endogenous villin gene. Hence, these regulatory sequences can be used to target heterologous genes in immature and differentiated epithelial cells of the small and/or large intestinal mucosa.

In the kidney, the transgene was also expressed in the epithelial cells of the proximal tubules but is likely sensitive to the site of integration. A construct lacking the first intron restricted β-galactosidase expression to the small intestine. Thus, the 9-kb genomic region contains the necessary cis-acting elements to recapitulate the tissue-specific expression pattern of the endogenous villin gene. Hence, these regulatory sequences can be used to target heterologous genes in immature and differentiated epithelial cells of the small and/or large intestinal mucosa. Transgenic mice are routinely used to study the molecular and cellular basis of normal and pathological states in intestinal mucosa (1Sweetser D.A. Hauft S.M. Hoppe P.C. Birkenmeier E.H. Gordon J.I.

The major limitation regarding the targeting of exogenous transgenes in this tissue is that the epithelium of the mouse intestinal mucosa is renewed every 2–5 days (6Cheng H. Leblond C.P. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 461-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 7Wright N.A. Irwin M. Cell Tiss. Kinet. 1982; 15: 595-609PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gordon J.I. Hermiston M.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The epithelial cells arise from multipotent stem cells functionally anchored at the base (more precisely in the lower third) of the proliferative compartment of the epithelium, the crypts of Lieberkühn. These crypts display a monoclonal organization because they are each derived from a single progenitor cell (9Ponder B.A. Schmidt G.H. Wilkinson M.M. Wood M.J. Monk M. Reid A. Nature. 1985; 313: 689-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Descendants of stem cells multiply in the middle portion of each crypt (10Potten C.S. Loeffler M. Development. 1990; 110: 1001-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and gradually differentiate into four principal cell types. In the small intestine, absorptive enterocytes (constituting >80% of the epithelial cells), mucus-producing goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells migrate upward from the crypts to the apex of surrounding villi (whose colonic counterparts are hexagonal-shaped cuffs) (11Schmidt G.H. Wilkinson M.M. Ponder B.A. Cell. 1985; 40: 425-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), where they become apoptotic and are exfoliated into the gut lumen (12Hall P.A. Coates P.J. Ansari B. Hopwood D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3569-3577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, antimicrobial peptides secreting Paneth cells migrate to the bottom of the crypts, where they reside for about 20 days (13Bry L. Falk P. Huttner K. Ouellette A. Midtvedt T. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10335-10339Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Given the remarkable protective effect of this epithelium, it is not surprising that most previous studies aiming to induce neoplastic transformation in intestinal mucosa of transgenic mice have failed (14Hauft S.M. Kim S.H. Schmidt G.H. Pease S. Rees S. Harris S. Roth K.A. Hansbrough J.R. Cohn S.M. Ahnen D.J. Wright N.A. Goodlad R.A. Gordon J.I. J.

In these reports, the use of promoter sequences that direct oncogenes in nonproliferating enterocytes located in the upper third of crypts produce only minor phenotypic abnormalities without tumorigenic consequences in the gut epithelium, suggesting that the residence time of these villus-associated cells may not be sufficient for the oncogenes to exert their effects. Furthermore this suggests that transgenic mouse models of neoplasia may require an efficient targeting of oncogenes in crypt stem cells or their immediate descendants. Villin is a cytoskeletal protein that is mainly produced in epithelial cells that develop a brush border responsible for absorption as in the digestive apparatus (epithelial cells of the large and small intestines) and in the urogenital tract (epithelial cells of the kidney proximal tubules). Because it is expressed in the proliferative stem cells of the intestinal crypts (16Robine S. Huet C. Moll R. Sahuquillo-Merino C. Coudrier E. Zweibaum A. Louvard D. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S.

Differentiation. 1988; 39: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), it is believed to be an early marker for committed intestinal cells. The multiple levels of regulation control villin gene activity during mouse embryogenesis (18Maunoury R. Robine S. Pringault E. Huet C. Guenet J.L. Gaillard J.A. Louvard D.

Development (. 1989; 106: 407-419PubMed Google Scholar) and account for the strict pattern of tissue-specific expression observed in adults. Moreover, the expression of the villin gene in intestinal epithelial cells is conspicuously maintained in their corresponding carcinomas (21Carboni J.M. Howe C.L. West A.B. Barwick K.W. Mooseker M.S. Morrow J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1987; 129: 589-600PubMed Google Scholar, 22Moll R. Robine S. Dudouet B. Louvard D. Virchows Arch. B.

The specific expression pattern of villin suggests that it is an appropriate candidate for the characterization of regulatory sequences that could allow targeting of heterologous genes into a selected population of cells in the mouse digestive tract. With this goal in mind, the human villin gene has been isolated and characterized (25Pringault E. Robine S. Louvard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10811-10815Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A 2-kb 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s).1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s). 5′-flanking region has been found to contain sufficient regulatory elements to promote tissue-specific expression of a reporter gene in intestinal and renal cell lines (26Robine S. Sahuquillo-Merino C. Louvard D. Pringault E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11426-11434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In transgenic mice, this regulatory region is able to drive the expression of the human Ha-ras oncogene in the tissues in which the endogenous gene is actively transcribed. However, low levels of expression were observed that did not trigger malignant tissue appearance into the gut of these animals. 2G. Tremp, personal communication.2G. Tremp, personal communication. These observations led us to further analyze an extended genomic region of the mouse villin gene with the goal of mapping additional elements localized 5′ and/or 3′ and involved in promoting high levels of transgenic expression in the intestinal mucosa. Here we report the analysis of tissue-specific expression of the mouse villin gene using: (i) DNase I-hypersensitive sites assays, (ii) transient transfection assays, and (iii) transgenic mice. Human colon carcinoma enterocyte-like CaCo2 cells, pig kidney proximal tubules-derived LLCPK1 cells, and distal tubules-derived Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were cultured as described (26Robine S. Sahuquillo-Merino C. Louvard D. Pringault E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11426-11434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells cultures were cotransfected using 15 μl of Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 5 μg each of β-galactosidase reporter plasmid construct and the control plasmid pRSVLuc, which contains the luciferase gene under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter. Cells were harvested 48 h later, and cell extracts were assayed by chemiluminescent detection of both β-galactosidase (Galacto-Light, Tropix, Inc.) and luciferase (Luciferase Assay Kit, Tropix, Inc.) activities using a luminometer (Berthold). β-Galactosidase activity (light units) was corrected for variations in transfection efficiencies as determined by luciferase activity. All transfections were repeated at least three times. Results are expressed as fold induction over that of the vector without promoter, pBasic. Total RNA was isolated from mouse intestine with RNA NOW reagent (Biogentex). For primer extension assay, 2 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (5′-GAGTGGTGATGTTGAGAGAGCCT-3′) complementary to nucleotides +81 to +103 of the murine villin cDNA (GenBankTM accession number M98454) was hybridized with 30 μg of total RNA at 60 °C (0.25 m KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) for 90 min. Transcription with 5 units/μl of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) was carried out at 37 °C for 90 min in 300 μl of a solution containing 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.75 mm deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 75 μg/ml actinomycin D, and 0.3 units/μl RNasin. The primer extension products were separated by electrophoresis in denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gels. The full-length extension product (105 nucleotides) was obtained by comparison with the length of the comigrating sequencing reaction products. A primer extension control experiment was performed on the same total RNA preparation using a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (5′-CATAGTTCTCGTTCCGGT-3′) complementary to nucleotides +63 to +80 of the mouse intestinal fatty acid-binding protein cDNA and generating an 81-nucleotide extension product (27Green R.P. Cohn S.M. Sacchettini J.C. Jackson K.E. Gordon J.I. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Tissues from 30 mice were used per assay of intestine, kidney, liver, and spleen. Nuclei preparation and DNase I digestion were performed as described (28Perret C. L'Horset F. Thomasset M. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Nuclei were digested without or with 20 to 160 units of DNase I (DPRF Worthington) for 10 min at 0 °C. 10 μg of purified DNA was digested overnight with restriction enzyme (BamHI or BglII). The DNase I-hypersensitive sites were analyzed by Southern blotting using theBglII-PstI probe (0.5 kb) (as indicated in Fig.2). All constructs described were subcloned into the pBluescript II KS vector (Stratagene) with fragments isolated from a λDASHII phage containing a 16.3-kb region (9 kb upstream and 7.3 kb downstream from the translation initiation codon) of the mouse villin gene (kindly furnished by G. Tremp, Rhône-Poulenc Rorer) (29Cohen-Tannoudji M. Robine S. Choulika A. Pinto D. El Marjou F. Babinet C. Louvard D. Jaisser F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1444-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The pD1 construct (as described in the legend to Fig. 3 B) was prepared by ligating aBamHI fragment of 5.1 kb (1.8 kb upstream from the ATG translation initiation codon of the mouse villin gene, subcloned 5′ to the nuclear localization signal-β-galactosidase gene-SV40 polyadenylation site, using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategy) at the BamHI site in a plasmid containing the 3.7-kb region of the mouse villin gene (immediately 5′ to the 1.8-kb region described above). The pA1 and pA2 (containing an internal 1-kb deletion) constructs have resulted from several steps based on theBstEII sites present in the 3.7-kb region described above and in a plasmid containing the 3.5-kb region of the mouse villin gene (immediately 5′ to the 3.7-kb region). The pC1 and pC2 constructs were derived from the pA1 and pA2 plasmids cut with ApaI and re-ligated, respectively. To generate the pB1 construct, aBglII fragment (480 bp) from the 3.5-kb region described above was excised and cloned into the KpnI site of the pC1 plasmid. The pA3, pB3, and pC3 constructs correspond to the pA1, pB1, and pC1 deleted from the intron 1 (see Fig. 3 B). The sequence between the transcription initiation start site and the translation initiation codon, excluding the intron 1, was deduced from that of the murine villin cDNA and was introduced into theBglII-NcoI sites of the pC1 construct by using a dimerized oligodimer made of a coding-strand oligonucleotide (5′-GATCTCCCAGGTGGTGGCTGCCTCTTCCAGACAGGCTCGTCCAC-3′) and a noncoding-strand oligonucleotide (5′-CATGGTGGACGAGCCTGTCTGGAAGAGGCAGCCACCACCTGGGA-3′), resulting in the pB3 construct. The pA3 and the pC3 constructs were derived from the pB3 plasmid by ligating an ApaI fragment (3.1 kb) and aBglII fragment (480 bp), both from the 3.5-kb region described above, at the ApaI site in the pB3 plasmid, respectively. Subcloning steps were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The transgenes digested withXhoI-NotI were injected into the pronuclei of the fertilized eggs of the B6/D2 mice in collaboration with the Service d'Experimentation Animale et de Transgénèse, CNRS (Villejuif, France). Mice carrying transgenes were first identified by PCR of genomic DNA to confirm the presence of the β-galactosidase gene and then analyzed by Southern blotting to determine the copy number of the integrated transgene. Each founder animal harbored one copy of the transgene per genome. Small intestine, colon, kidney, stomach, liver, heart, lung, thymus, brain, spleen, and muscle were dissected from transgenic mice and either prepared for total RNA extraction or embedded to perform cryosections. Total RNA was isolated with SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega). 20 ng of pd(N)6 random primer (Pharmacia) were hybridized with 2 μg of total RNA at 70 °C for 10 min in distilled water. Reverse transcription with 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II, Life Technologies, Inc.) was carried out at 37 °C for 90 min in a 20-μl solution of 1× First Strand Buffer (Life Technologies, Inc), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm deoxynucleoside triphosphate, and 0.4 units/μl RNasin. 2 μl of the resulting cDNAs were amplified by PCR reaction in 50 μl for 40 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 60 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 51 °C (for transgene and villin) and 57 °C (for TFIID), and 30 s at 72 °C. For the transgene primers, 5′-CAACTTCCTAAGATCTCC-3′ coding strand and 5′-ATTCAGGCTGCGCAACTGTT-3′ noncoding strand were used, generating a 250-bp product. For villin amplification 5′-CAACTTCCTAAGATCTCC-3′ coding strand primer and 5′-GCAACAGTCGCTGGACATCACAGG-3′ noncoding strand primer were used, generating a 473-bp product; for TFIID amplification 5′-CCACGGACAACTGCGTTGAT-3′ coding strand primer and 5′-GGCTCATAGCTACTGAACTG-3′ noncoding strand primer were used, generating a 220-bp product. One-fifth of the PCR product was run on an ethidium bromide-containing agarose gel. Cryosections (5 μm) from the tissues were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and incubated in a staining solution that contained 0.4 mg of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside/ml, 4 mm potassium ferricyanide, 4 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 8 h. To determine the transcriptional start site of the mouse villin gene, total RNA was isolated from intestine and analyzed by primer extension assay using an oligonucleotide complementary to the mouse villin cDNA downstream of the ATG initiation codon. The efficiency of the reaction was confirmed by primer extension of the mouse intestinal fatty acid-binding protein gene (fabpi) from the same RNA preparation (27Green R.P. Cohn S.M. Sacchettini J.C. Jackson K.E. Gordon J.I. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Analysis of the fabpi extension product on a sequencing gel by comparison with a sequence ladder (Fig.1 A) revealed a strong signal band of a size of 81 bp as expected. The extension product of villin was 105 bp, indicating that the transcriptional start site (an adenosine residue subsequently designed as nucleotide +1) was 57 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon of the murine villin cDNA (Fig. 1 B). Comparison of the genomic sequence encompassing 9 kb upstream from the ATG initiation codon with the cDNA sequence, position of splice site consensus sequences in the 9-kb genomic sequence (Fig. 1 B), and determination of the transcription start site reveal that the mouse villin gene has one transcription start site that is separated from the ATG initiation codon by a 5.5-kb intronic region (Fig. 1 C). To characterize the key regulatory regions involved in the specific control of villin expression, we have mapped the DNase I-hypersensitive sites (31Becker P.B. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in the mouse villin gene (along a region extending 9 kb upstream and 4.4 kb downstream from the translation initiation codon, as represented in Fig. 2 A). The chromatin form of the mouse villin gene in different tissues (intestine, kidney, liver, and spleen) was submitted to limited DNase I digestion and subsequently digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes. Using BglII digestion and a 0.5-kb probe homologous 5′ of the 7.5-kb BglII fragment (Fig. 2 B), two sets of DNase I incubation-related fragments were detected, migrating at 5.5 and 2.7 kb, and corresponding to hypersensitive sites designated as HS I (located at approximately +5.5 kb downstream from the transcription start (+1) site, just upstream from the ATG initiation codon) and HS II (located at approximately +3 kb downstream from the (+1) site), respectively. HS I was observed in nuclei isolated from intestine, kidney, and liver, whereas HS II was only present in intestinal tissue. No specific hypersensitive sites were detected in nuclei isolated from spleen. The presence and location of these hypersensitive bands were confirmed by hybridization with the 0.8-kb probe (Fig. 2 A) homologous to the 3′ end of the 7.5-kbBglII fragment (data not shown). Using BamHI digestion and the 0.5-kb probe (Fig. 2 C), five sets of DNase I-treated nuclei-related fragments were detected, migrating at 3.4, 4.3, and 4.7 kb and approximately 10 and 15 kb, corresponding to the hypersensitive sites HS II, HS III (located at −0.5 kb upstream from the (+1) site), HS IV (located at −1 kb upstream from the (+1) site), HS V (located at −10 kb upstream from the (+1) site), and HS VI (located at −15 kb upstream from the (+1) site), respectively. HS III was observed in nuclei isolated from both intestine and kidney, whereas HS IV was only present in intestinal tissue as HS II. The hypersensitive sites HS V and HS VI were only present in liver tissue (in which villin is weakly expressed) and were located far upstream from the transcription start site in regions (i) that have not been subcloned and (ii) that could belong to an adjacent gene; for these reasons, these hepatic-specific hypersensitive sites were not analyzed further. As for BglII digestion, no specific hypersensitive sites were detected in nuclei isolated from spleen. Using other independant restriction digestions (EcoRI andHindIII) and the 0.5, 0.8, and 1.25 kb probes (as represented in Fig. 2 A), similar results were obtained (data not shown). In conclusion, four major distinct DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HS I to HS IV) were shown to be present in the region extending from −1 kb to +5.5 kb in respect to the transcription start site (Fig.3 A) of the mouse villin gene. These sites were detected in intestine (HS I to HS IV), kidney (HS I and HS III), and liver (HS I), tissues in which villin is expressed, but they were not found in spleen, a tissue that does not produce villin. These findings correlate with the tissue-specific control of villin gene expression and suggest that the putative critical regulatory elements lie within these regions. HS II and HS IV were only detected in intestine and are probably associated with tissue-specific transcription factor-binding sites involved in the positive control of villin gene intestinal expression. To test the effects of the segments containing the DNase I-hypersensitive sites (Fig. 3 A) on transcriptional activity and to define more precisely the element(s) controlling villin gene expression in the intestine, segments were subcloned upstream of a promoterless LacZ plasmid (Fig. 3 B). The construct pA1 contained all the subcloned regions downstream from the ATG initiation codon, encompassing the four DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HS I to HS IV) described above and the 5.5-kb intronic sequence, intron 1. Plasmids pA2 and pA3 were identical to pA1 except for the presence of intestine-specific hypersensitive site HS II and intron 1, respectively. Plasmid pB1 and plasmid pC1 were similar to plasmid pA1 but lacked the regions extending from −480 bp to −3.5 kb and −100 bp to −3.5 kb according to the transcription start site, respectively. Plasmid pC2 was identical to pA2 but lacked the region extending from −100 bp to −3.5 kb. Plasmids pB3 and pC3 were identical to pB1 and pC1 except for the presence of intron 1, respectively. The plasmid pD1 was identical to pA1 except for the presence of the transcription start site and the region extending upstream from this site. The plasmid pBasic, which does not contain a promoter or enhancer, and a pControl plasmid, which possesses the SV40 promoter, were also tested in each experiment. Transient transfections with these recombinant plasmids were performed in CaCo2 and LLCPK1 cell lines, which express villin, and in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells, in which no villin expression is detected. Transcription from the villin promoter was measured by assaying β-galactosidase activity in extracts made from the transfected cells, and the results were expressed as fold induction over that of the promoterless vector, pBasic (Fig. 3 C). High levels of β-galactosidase activity in the pControl transfected cell lines (CaCo2 cells, 50-fold over that of pBasic; LLCPK1 cells, 98-fold) demonstrated the presence of efficient general transcription/translation mechanisms in these cells (data not shown). Very low levels of β-galactosidase activity in pD1 both transfected cells compared with pBasic transfected cells showed that the transcription start site was necessary for an efficient specific transcription of the reporter gene and that nonspecific transcription was not initiated elsewhere in the villin regulatory sequences. The construct pA1 expressed the β-galactosidase gene at the highest level in CaCo2 cells (8-fold over pBasic) as compared with LLCPK1 cells (1.5-fold over pBasic), suggesting that the four DNase I-hypersensitive sites together with the first intron are necessary to efficiently promote transcription in cells of intestinal origin. Deletion of the fragment containing the intestinal-specific hypersensitive site HS II (pA2) dramatically decreased β-galactosidase expression in CaCo2 cells (2-fold over pBasic) to about 25% of that of pA1, demonstrating that a major element that confers intestinal activity was confined within this fragment. Similar results were obtained when the region upstream from the transcription start site (encompassing HS III and HS IV) was almost wholly deleted with or without HS II (pC1 and pC2, respectively). The deletion of the intronic region alone (pA3) or in combination with deleted sequences upstream from the transcription start site (pB3 and pC3 extend only from −480 and −100 bp, respectively) affected to a lesser extent β-galactosidase expression in the same intestinal cells (5.5-fold over pBasic), with a decrease to only about 65% of that of pA1, demonstrating that the regulatory elements that lay within 100 bp were sufficient to promote transcription in cultured cells. However, the level of β-galactosidase activity increased strongly when the plasmids pA3, pB3, and pC3 were transfected in LLCPK1 cells (10-, 44-, and 45-fold over pBasic, respectively), showing that the absence of the first intron, in combination with the lack of intestine-specific HS IV, was able to promote transcription in a kidney cell line. This would suggest that negative elements that confer repression in kidney transcription are confined in these elements. To test specificity, the villin promoter-related constructs were transfected in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, which do not express villin. After transfection, these cells showed only base-line levels of β-galactosidase activity when compared with pBasic-related activity (data not shown), demonstrating that the villin regulatory sequences were unable to promote efficient transcription in nonexpressing villin cells and that consequently the expression of the reporter gene in CaCo2 and LLCPK1 cells is specifically dependent upon these regulatory sequences. Taken together, these results from transient transfection of cultured cells demonstrate that (i) the mouse villin genomic sequence, extending from −3.5 to +5.5 kb, specifically directs an efficient level expression of the β-galactosidase reporter gene in intestine-derived cells, (ii) this level is dramatically reduced when the intronic intestine-specific hypersensitive site HS II or the region upstream from the (+1) site is deleted, (iii) lack of the entire first intron seems to partially restore the intestine-related ability to promote transcription, and (iv) lack of the entire first intron in combination with intestine-specific hypersensitive site HS IV is correlated with a strong increase of ability in promoting transcription in kidney-derived cells. Because the −3.5 to +5.5-kb region of the mouse villin contained the enterocyte-like-specific promoter/enhancer activity in transient transfection assays, we examined the ability of this region to drive intestine-specific expression of the β-galactosidase reporter gene in transgenic mice. Five founder animals that contained the pA1 construct as a transgene were obtained. The founder mice were analyzed for mRNA reporter gene expression in several adult tissues by reverse transcription-PCR analysis. From the same cDNA samples, products encoding β-galactosidase, villin, and TFIID were analyzed. The PCR assays enabled only the detection of spliced transcribed mRNA, excluding that from genomic DNA itself, by means of an exon connection strategy by combination of a 5′ PCR primer from within the mouse villin promoter sequence just upstream of the splice donor site and the 3′ primers from within the β-galactosidase gene or the villin gene. For each founder, no reporter gene expression was detected in the tissues in which villin mRNAs were not detected using the PCR assay (Fig.4). For all founder mice, the reporter gene transcription was detected along the cephalocaudal axis of the gut (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, proximal, and distal colon) following the intestine-specific expression of the villin gene (Fig. 4). In the kidney, the transgene w"

We have investigated the hypothesis that TNFα stimulates lipolysis by blocking the action of endogenous adenosine. Adipocytes were incubated for 48 h with TNFα, and lipolysis was measured in the absence or presence of adenosine deaminase. Without adenosine deaminase, the rate of glycerol release was 2–3-fold higher in the TNFα-treated cells, but with adenosine deaminase lipolysis increased in the controls to approximately that in the TNFα-treated cells. This suggests that TNFα blocks adenosine release or prevents its antilipolytic effect. Both N6-phenylisopropyl adenosine and nicotinic acid were less potent and efficacious inhibitors of lipolysis in treated cells. A decrease in the concentration of α-subunits of all three Gi subtypes was detected by Western blotting without a change in Gsproteins or β-subunits. Gi2α was about 50% of control, whereas Gi1α and Gi3α were about 20 and 40% of control values, respectively. The time course of Gidown-regulation correlated with the stimulation of lipolysis. Furthermore, down-regulation of Gi by an alternative approach (prolonged incubation withN6-phenylisopropyl adenosine) stimulated lipolysis. These findings indicate that TNFα stimulates lipolysis by blunting endogenous inhibition of lipolysis. The mechanism appears to be a Gi protein down-regulation. Prolonged treatment (12–24 h) of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) stimulates lipolysis. We have investigated the hypothesis that TNFα stimulates lipolysis by blocking the action of endogenous adenosine. Adipocytes were incubated for 48 h with TNFα, and lipolysis was measured in the absence or presence of adenosine deaminase. Without adenosine deaminase, the rate of glycerol release was 2–3-fold higher in the TNFα-treated cells, but with adenosine deaminase lipolysis increased in the controls to approximately that in the TNFα-treated cells. This suggests that TNFα blocks adenosine release or prevents its antilipolytic effect. Both N6-phenylisopropyl adenosine and nicotinic acid were less potent and efficacious inhibitors of lipolysis in treated cells. A decrease in the concentration of α-subunits of all three Gi subtypes was detected by Western blotting without a change in Gsproteins or β-subunits. Gi2α was about 50% of control, whereas Gi1α and Gi3α were about 20 and 40% of control values, respectively. The time course of Gidown-regulation correlated with the stimulation of lipolysis. Furthermore, down-regulation of Gi by an alternative approach (prolonged incubation withN6-phenylisopropyl adenosine) stimulated lipolysis. These findings indicate that TNFα stimulates lipolysis by blunting endogenous inhibition of lipolysis. The mechanism appears to be a Gi protein down-regulation. TNFα 1The abbreviations used are: TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PIA, N6-phenylisopropyl adenosine.1The abbreviations used are: TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PIA, N6-phenylisopropyl adenosine. is a multifunctional cytokine important in many pathological and physiological states (1Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1994; 45: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). A series of recent reports has demonstrated that adipose tissue expresses TNFα mRNA and protein. Furthermore, adipose tissue from obese animals and humans expresses considerably more TNFα than does tissue from their lean counterparts (2Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hotamisligil G.S. Arner P. Caro J.F. Atkinson R.L. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2409-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar). This excess expression of TNFα in adipose tissue may form a link between obesity and development of insulin resistance, which often leads to type 2 diabetes in obese subjects (4Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (5970) Google Scholar). However, TNFα is not measurable in the circulation of obese subjects and is therefore considered an autocrine or paracrine regulator of adipose tissue metabolism. TNFα has several effects on adipocytes that may be related to the development of type 2 diabetes in obese subjects. It has been reported that TNFα induces insulin resistance possibly by inducing serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and converting it to an inhibitor of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (5Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar). In addition, TNFα causes a net depletion of the adipose tissue triglyceride. Initially, this was thought to be largely because of a decrease in the activity of lipoprotein lipase (6Kawakami M. Cerami A. J. Exp. Med. 1981; 154: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, we and others have reported that TNFα also stimulates lipolysis both in rat adipocytes maintained in primary culture (7Green A. Dobias S.B. Walters D.J.A. Brasier A.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2581-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (8Ogawa H. Nielsen S. Kawakami M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1003: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Doerrler W. Feingold K.R. Grunfeld C. Cytokine. 1997; 6: 478-484Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 10Feingold K.R. Doerrler W. Dinarello C.A. Fiers W. Grunfeld C. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We found that TNFα-induced stimulation of lipolysis in primary adipocytes is chronic in nature, taking approximately 6–12 h before a measurable effect is observed (7Green A. Dobias S.B. Walters D.J.A. Brasier A.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2581-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Furthermore, neither the rate of isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis nor the concentration of hormone-sensitive lipase (the rate-limiting enzyme for lipolysis) was affected by TNFα over the time course of our studies. This suggests that the major effect of TNFα is to increase the basal rate of adipocyte lipolysis and activate existing hormone-sensitive lipase. The basal rate of lipolysis in isolated adipocytes is normally inhibited by endogenous adenosine that is spontaneously released from these cells (11Schwabe U. Ebert R. Erbler H.C. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1973; 276: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12Schwabe U. Ebert R. Erbler H.C. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1975; 5: 569-583PubMed Google Scholar). Adenosine, through binding to A1adenosine receptors and subsequent activation of Gi, inhibits adenylyl cyclase, decreases intracellular cyclic AMP concentrations, and hence decreases the rate of lipolysis. These observations led us to hypothesize that TNFα stimulates adipocyte lipolysis indirectly by blocking the action of endogenous adenosine. Here, we report that TNFα disrupts the ability of an A1adenosine receptor agonist and of nicotinic acid to inhibit lipolysis. Furthermore, the mechanism of this disruption appears to be specific down-regulation of Giα isoforms, especially Gi1α. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used for experiments. Animals approximately 45 days old were purchased from Texas Animal Specialties (Houston, TX). They were maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle and fed Purina rat chow (Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were killed by CO2asphyxiation. Adipocytes were isolated from epididymal fat pads by the collagenase digestion method (13Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Digestion was carried out at 37 °C with constant shaking (140 cycles/min) for 45 min. Cells were filtered through nylon mesh (1 mm) and washed three times with buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 1.3 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mmMgSO4, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), plus 1% bovine serum albumin. Adipocytes were suspended at a 5% final concentration (w/v) in the above described buffer supplemented with 5 mm glucose. In some experiments, adenosine deaminase (10 μg/ml) was included in the incubation medium to prevent accumulation of endogenously produced adenosine, which inhibits lipolysis. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a final volume of 0.5 ml for 30 min with constant shaking. Preliminary experiments (not shown) established that the rate of lipolysis is constant for at least 45 min under these conditions. Four minutes before the incubation was ended shaking was stopped to allow cells to float. Infranatant was transferred to another set of tubes and heated at 70 °C for 10 min to inactivate any enzymes released by the cells. Glycerol was assayed enzymatically by the method of McGowan et al. (14McGowan M.W. Artiss J.D. Strandbergh D.R. Zak B. Clin. Chem. 1983; 29: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar) using a kit from Sigma. After isolation, adipocytes were maintained in primary culture according to the method of Marshallet al. (15Marshall S. Garvey W.T. Geller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6376-6384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after isolation and digestion under sterile conditions, the cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1% bovine serum albumin, and antibiotics. After that, adipocytes were resuspended in the same medium, supplemented with 1 μg/ml adenosine deaminase, and incubated at 37 °C for up to 4 days at a final concentration of 1 g of cells/120 ml of medium. Following incubation for various times, adipocytes were washed three times in the buffer used for adipocyte isolation with no glucose and only 1% bovine serum albumin followed by one wash in homogenizing buffer (250 mmsucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The cells were then homogenized by vigorous mixing in 16 × 100-mm glass test tubes on a vortex mixer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 × g, and the supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 16,000 × g. The pellet was suspended in 154 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, and frozen at −70 °C. Protein concentration of the membrane suspensions was determined by the Bradford method using a kit from Bio-Rad and bovine γ-globulin as a standard. Each antiserum was raised against a synthetic decapeptide corresponding to a peptide sequence in the antigen of interest as described before (16Green A. Johnson J.L. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5206-5210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adipocyte crude membrane fractions prepared as described previously (17Green A. Milligan G. Dobias S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3223-3229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were diluted to equal protein concentrations, further diluted with an equal volume of 2× concentrated Laemmli sample buffer (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) (70 mm Tris, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 10% mercaptoethanol), and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. The membranes were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12.5% acrylamide, 0.06% bisacrylamide, run at a 35 mA constant current) and then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. The gels were typically loaded with 50 μg of protein/lane. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for 2 h with 5% dried skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and then washed once for 15 min in TBS containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 detergent (Sigma). Following further washes with TBS, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated overnight with primary antiserum (in 1% dried milk/TBS diluted 1:200 for colorimetric detection or 1:2000–5000 for chemiluminescent detection). The membranes were washed again several times with TBS-Nonidet P-40 and incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h (goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to alkaline phosphatase in 1% dried milk/TBS diluted 1:3000 for colorimetric detection or goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase in 1% dried milk/TBS diluted 1:3000 for chemiluminescent detection). After several more washes, membranes were incubated with chemiluminescent detection reagents according to directions given by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and membranes were exposed to photographic films with repeated exposures as needed. Blots and films were quantified using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech UltraScan laser densitometer. Media from adipocytes incubated in primary culture were assayed for lactate dehydrogenase activity by measuring the rate of decrease in A 340 in the presence of pyruvate and NADH (19Vassault A. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Basel, Switzerland1983: 118-126Google Scholar). Lipolysis in isolated adipocytes is under tonic inhibition because of endogenously produced adenosine, which acts through binding to A1 adenosine receptors (20Wieser P.B. Fain J.N. Endocrinology. 1975; 96: 1221-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, the basal rate of lipolysis in adipocytes is determined, at least partly, by the action of endogenous adenosine. We hypothesized that TNFα stimulates lipolysis indirectly by preventing adenosine accumulation or by abolishing the antilipolytic action of adenosine. To test this hypothesis, we measured the basal and TNFα-stimulated rate of lipolysis in the absence and presence of adenosine deaminase. Adenosine deaminase hydrolyzes adenosine into inosine and hence abolishes adenosine-induced inhibition of lipolysis. Adipocytes were incubated in primary culture for 48 h without or with TNFα (100 ng/ml). After incubation, the cells were washed three times, and the rate of lipolysis (glycerol release) was measured in the presence or absence of adenosine deaminase (10 μg/ml) (Fig.1). As in our previous report (7Green A. Dobias S.B. Walters D.J.A. Brasier A.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2581-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the rate of lipolysis was markedly higher in the TNFα-treated cells. Adenosine deaminase increased the rate of lipolysis in control cells to approximately the same rate as in TNFα-treated cells. However, in the TNFα-treated cells, adenosine deaminase had little or no additional stimulatory effect. The above finding suggests that TNFα stimulates lipolysis either by disrupting the pathway by which adenosine inhibits lipolysis or by inhibiting adenosine release from the cells. To distinguish between these alternatives, a full dose-response curve for lipolysis inhibition with PIA, a nonhydrolyzable analog of adenosine that is a full agonist at A1 adenosine receptors, was obtained (Fig.2). Adipocytes were incubated with TNFα for 48 h as before, washed, and incubated with adenosine deaminase to prevent accumulation of endogenous adenosine plus various concentrations of PIA. Glycerol release was measured after 30 min. There was a pronounced rightward shift in the dose-response curve for lipolysis inhibition by PIA in TNFα-treated cells as compared with controls. Furthermore, maximal inhibition of lipolysis was markedly blunted in the TNFα-treated cells, such that PIA inhibited lipolysis in TNFα-treated adipocytes by only about 40% as compared with almost 70% inhibition in control cells, that is PIA was both less efficacious and less potent as an inhibitor of lipolysis in TNFα-treated cells relative to control cells. To determine whether the loss of inhibition of lipolysis is generalized or specific to the A1 adenosine receptor, we investigated the effect of another inhibitor of lipolysis, nicotinic acid. The antilipolytic action of nicotinic acid was also markedly blunted after a 2-day treatment with TNFα (Fig. 3) with almost complete loss of the inhibitory effect. Nicotinic acid inhibits lipolysis by binding to a receptor that is distinct from the A1 adenosine receptor but is coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins (see “Discussion”). Together, these findings indicate that TNFα disrupts a component of the signal transduction pathway by which both adenosine and nicotinic acid inhibit lipolysis. G-proteins are a crucial link between receptor occupation and second messenger activation, and their concentrations in rat adipocytes can be regulated (21Milligan G. Green A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 207-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Receptors that decrease intracellular cyclic AMP concentrations and inhibit lipolysis act through a group of G-proteins collectively termed Gi. Therefore, we measured the relative concentrations of the α-subunits of all three Gi subtypes expressed in rat adipocytes. Fig.4 shows Western blots of plasma membrane preparations isolated from adipocytes incubated for 2 days without or with TNFα. The blot shown in A was probed with an antiserum (SG1) that binds to the α-subunits of Gi1 and Gi2. Although these two α-subunits are almost identical in molecular mass, it is possible to resolve them by using a very low concentration of bisacrylamide in the gels, as we have reported before (16Green A. Johnson J.L. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5206-5210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The blot in B was probed with an antibody (I3B) that is specific for the α-subunit of Gi3. As can be seen from these blots, the membranes from TNFα-treated adipocytes contained markedly less of each Giα subtype than did the membranes from control cells. Quantification of Western blots from three separate experiments is shown in Fig. 4 C. This revealed that TNFα decreased the concentration of Gi1α by an average of approximately 80%, Gi2α by approximately 50%, and Gi3α by approximately 60% compared with controls, that is each Gi subtype was markedly down-regulated after incubation of adipocytes with TNFα. To determine whether TNFα causes a general decrease in the concentration of G-proteins, we also measured relative concentrations of Gsα, which couples stimulatory receptors to adenylyl cyclase. Adipocytes were incubated in primary culture with or without TNFα; plasma membrane preparations were isolated and analyzed on Western blots as before but probed with CS1 antibody, which binds to all known splice variants of Gsα including the 43- and 47-kDa isoforms expressed in adipocytes (16Green A. Johnson J.L. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5206-5210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig.5 A, treatment with TNFα did not alter the concentration of either isoform of Gsα. Similarly, TNFα did not alter the cellular concentration of G-protein β-subunits as demonstrated by Western blotting with antiserum BN2 (Fig. 5 B). To further investigate the relationship between Gidown-regulation and stimulation of lipolysis, we determined the time course of the loss of Gi1α and Gi2α (Fig.6). TNFα caused a measurable decrease in concentration of both G-proteins within 12 h and a maximal decrease by approximately 24 h. This time course is in good agreement with that for TNFα-induced activation of lipolysis that we have published previously (7Green A. Dobias S.B. Walters D.J.A. Brasier A.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2581-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that prolonged treatment of adipocytes with PIA (or other agonists that inhibit adenylyl cyclase) down-regulates Gi in adipocytes (16Green A. Johnson J.L. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5206-5210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Green A. Milligan G. Dobias S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3223-3229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This agonist-induced down-regulation results in heterologous desensitization of lipolysis to other agonists that act through the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (17Green A. Milligan G. Dobias S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3223-3229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have not previously investigated the effect of prolonged treatment of adipocytes with PIA on basal rates of lipolysis. Therefore, as an independent assessment of whether Gidown-regulation is sufficient to stimulate lipolysis, we incubated adipocytes with TNFα or PIA (300 nm) for 24 h, washed the cells, and measured the rate of lipolysis over 30 min as before. We have previously reported that this concentration of PIA is maximal for Gi down-regulation (16Green A. Johnson J.L. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5206-5210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, prolonged incubation with PIA was equally effective at stimulating lipolysis as was TNFα (Fig.7 A). Further experiments demonstrated that the time course for the stimulatory effect of PIA on lipolysis (Fig. 7 B) corresponds to that for PIA-induced Gi down-regulation (16Green A. Johnson J.L. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5206-5210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the dose-response relationship for the chronic lipolytic effect of PIA (Fig.7 C) is essentially identical to the dose-response relationship for Gi down-regulation (16Green A. Johnson J.L. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5206-5210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these findings strongly suggest that the lipolytic effect of prolonged treatment of adipocytes with either TNFα or PIA is secondary to the down-regulation of Gi. PIA acutely inhibits lipolysis, but as demonstrated above prolonged treatment with PIA down-regulates Gi and stimulates lipolysis. Because prolonged treatment of adipocytes with TNFα has similar effects to prolonged treatment with PIA (i.e.Gi down-regulation and activation of lipolysis), we hypothesized that TNFα may have an acute inhibitory effect of lipolysis. However, we were unable to determine any such effect of TNFα (data not shown). Because TNFα has a cytotoxic effect on some cell types, we determined the degree of adipocyte lysis by measuring lactate dehydrogenase activity in the media. There was no significant difference in lactate dehydrogenase activity released into the incubation media between control and TNFα-treated adipocytes (data not shown), indicating that TNFα did not affect cell viability. In a previous report, we demonstrated that prolonged incubation of adipocytes with TNFα increased the basal but not isoproterenol-stimulated rate of lipolysis and that the concentration of hormone-sensitive lipase was unaffected (7Green A. Dobias S.B. Walters D.J.A. Brasier A.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2581-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We now have investigated the mechanism by which TNFα stimulates lipolysis in rat adipocytes. TNFα induces a 2–3-fold increase in the rate of release of glycerol from rat adipocytes incubated for at least 12 h in primary culture (7Green A. Dobias S.B. Walters D.J.A. Brasier A.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2581-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In isolated adipocytes, the cyclic AMP concentration and hence the rate of lipolysis are very low because of the presence of adenosine, which is spontaneously released by these cells (11Schwabe U. Ebert R. Erbler H.C. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1973; 276: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). After removal of endogenous adenosine, adenylyl cyclase activity increases, and lipolysis proceeds at almost maximal rates (22Honnor R.C. Dhillon G.S. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15130-15138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that is lipolysis is tonically inhibited by endogenous adenosine in the basal state. Therefore, we hypothesized that TNFα may stimulate lipolysis by releasing this endogenous inhibition. This hypothesis was supported by the finding that, when measured in the presence of adenosine deaminase, the rate of lipolysis was equal in control and TNFα-treated adipocytes. Results of lipolysis inhibition experiments using the adenosine analog, PIA, and nicotinic acid suggest that this is because of a decrease in the ability of the cells to respond to inhibitors of lipolysis. The decreased ability of endogenous adenosine and of exogenous PIA to inhibit lipolysis could be because of a loss of adenosine receptors. However, this is unlikely because the TNFα-treated cells also did not respond to nicotinic acid. Although nicotinic acid receptors are not well characterized, inhibition of lipolysis by nicotinic acid is pertussis toxin-sensitive (23Aktories K. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. FEBS Lett. 1983; 156: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Marcus C. Sonnenfeld T. Karpe B. Bolme P. Arner P. Pediatr. Res. 1989; 26: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and furthermore nicotinic acid inhibition of adenylyl cyclase is GTP-dependent (25Aktories K. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1980; 312: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore nicotinic acid inhibits adipocyte lipolysis through a G-protein-coupled receptor, although the identity of this receptor is unknown. Because TNFα caused a pronounced inhibition of the ability of both PIA and nicotinic acid to inhibit lipolysis, we investigated the effect of TNFα on concentrations of Gi. These experiments demonstrated that TNFα caused a marked down-regulation of all three Giα proteins, which most likely explains the inability of both PIA and nicotinic acid to inhibit lipolysis in these cells. We have previously demonstrated that agonist-induced down-regulation of Gi results in decreased sensitivity to all agents that act through the same pathway forming a mechanism for heterologous desensitization (17Green A. Milligan G. Dobias S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3223-3229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gasic S. Green A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We now report that TNFα also can result in Gi down-regulation in a manner similar to that induced by agonists, that is TNFα down-regulated Gi2α levels less than either Gi1α or Gi3α, as we have reported for agonist-induced Gi down-regulation (16Green A. Johnson J.L. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5206-5210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Green A. Milligan G. Dobias S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3223-3229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the inhibitory agonists also cause a marked (approximately 50%) loss of G-protein β-subunits from adipocytes (16Green A. Johnson J.L. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5206-5210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Green A. Milligan G. Dobias S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3223-3229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, TNFα did not affect cellular concentrations of β-subunits. This, together with the observation that TNFα has no acute inhibitory effect on lipolysis, suggests that the mechanism by which TNFα down-regulates Gi is different from that by which PIA and other inhibitory agonists down-regulate Gi. Clearly, TNFα down-regulates Giα-subunits in adipocytes and stimulates lipolysis. The findings suggest that this Gidown-regulation explains the lipolytic effect of TNFα. However, the cellular concentration of G-proteins generally exceeds that of receptors by approximately an order of magnitude (17Green A. Milligan G. Dobias S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3223-3229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the question of whether Gi down-regulation by itself can account for TNFα stimulation of lipolysis. Several lines of evidence support the conclusion that loss of Gi is indeed sufficient for stimulation of lipolysis. First, we have demonstrated that down-regulation of Gi by another agent (PIA) that presumably works through a different mechanism stimulates lipolysis equally to TNFα. Second, treatment of adipocytes with pertussis toxin, which ADP ribosylates and inactivates the various isoforms of Gi, results in marked stimulation of lipolysis (27Garcia-Sainz J.A. Torner M.L. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Third, prolonged treatment with growth hormone has been reported to stimulate adipocyte lipolysis, and growth hormone has also been reported to decrease Gi expression in adipocytes (28Doris R. Vernon R.G. Houslay M.D. Kilgour E. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggesting that the lipolytic effect of growth hormone may have a similar mechanism to that of TNFα. Finally, the time course of both TNFα-induced and PIA-induced Gi down-regulation corresponds closely to the time course for stimulation of lipolysis. We conclude that the concentration of Gi proteins in adipocytes may be a major regulatory end point used by several hormones and cytokines to influence cyclic AMP levels on a long term basis. Thus, Gidown-regulation or inactivation can stimulate lipolysis and account for the lipolytic effect of TNFα. Stimulatory G-proteins (Gs) were not affected by treatment of adipocytes with TNFα. Similarly, in a recent study of β-adrenergic receptor down-regulation following isoproterenol infusion in vivo, we did not detect concomitant down-regulation of adipocyte Gs (29Green A. Carroll R.M. Dobias S.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E271-E276Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that the concentration of Gs in adipocytes is not regulated in the same manner as are concentrations of Gi. One study found that TNFα induced an increase in Gi proteins in rat cardiomyocytes and that increased adenylyl cyclase activity was a consequence (30Reithmann C. Gierschik P. Werdan K. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 206: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This suggests that TNFα has tissue-specific effects on G-protein concentrations. The exact signaling mechanism for the effect of TNFα is not known. TNFα has two receptor subtypes widely expressed on all cells, including adipocytes (31Sprang S.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 366-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Most TNFα effects are mediated through activation of a p55 receptor, which is trimerized upon TNFα binding and activates membrane neutral sphingomyelinase. As a consequence, ceramide is released and activates various intracellular substrates like ceramide-activated protein kinase and a specific phosphatase (32Dressler K.A. Mathias S. Kolesnick R.N. Science. 1992; 255: 1715-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar,33Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). Cell-permeable analogs of ceramide have been able to mimic many TNFα actions (34Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). We incubated adipocytes in primary cultures with one such analog, C2-ceramide. Neither the rate of lipolysis nor cellular concentrations of Gi were affected by this compound (data not shown), indicating that the ceramide second messenger pathway is probably not involved. TNFα has been reported to induce insulin resistance of adipocytes (5Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar). Furthermore, adipose tissue from obese animals and humans contains more TNFα mRNA and protein than adipose tissue from lean animals and humans (2Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This increased expression of TNFα is believed to be central to the insulin resistance of obesity and may be key to the relationship between obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes (2Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TNFα-induced insulin resistance has been reported to be caused by phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1, which in turn causes inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor (5Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar). However, TNFα-induced insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylation is quite slow to develop, and another group has been unable to confirm the finding (35Stephens J.M. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 971-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for the mechanism by which increased adipose tissue TNFα may lead to insulin resistance is that the insulin resistance is secondary to stimulation of adipocyte lipolysis. Several arguments can be made to support this hypothesis. First, circulating free fatty acid concentrations are known to be elevated in obese subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes (36Fraze E. Donner C.C. Swislocki A.L.M. Chiou Y.A. Chen Y.D. Reaven G.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1985; 61: 807-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 37Jensen M.D. Am. J. Clin.

Invest. 1989; 84: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Second, free fatty acids are known to induce insulin resistance in vivo(39Randle P.J. Garland P.B. Hales C.N. Newsholme E.A. Lancet. 1963; i: 785-789Abstract Scopus (3702) Google Scholar, 40Perseghin G. Price T.B. Petersen K.F. Roden M. Cline G.W. Gerow K. Rothman D.L. Shulman G.I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). In addition, free fatty acids stimulate hepatic gluconeogenesis (41Williamson J.R. Kriesberg R.A. Felts P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 56: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), providing another mechanism by which increased adipocyte lipolysis may lead to insulin resistance. Recent studies have demonstrated that insulin inhibits hepatic glucose production primarily through indirect mechanisms (42Mittelman S.D. Fu Y.-Y. Rebrin K. Steil G. Bergman R.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3121-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) most likely by decreasing adipose tissue lipolysis and hence decreasing circulating free fatty acids. Therefore, increased rates of adipose tissue lipolysis would be expected to induce insulin resistance of both muscle and liver, and this may provide a mechanism by which TNFα induces insulin resistancein vivo. Furthermore, in a recent study Souza et al. (43Souza S.C. Yamamoto M.T. Franciosa M.D. Lien P. Greenberg A.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) reported that a thiazolidinedione (BRL 49653) blocked the lipolytic effect of TNFα in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. They proposed that this is an important mechanism by which thiazolidinediones improve insulin resistance. Further work will be needed to address this question. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the lipolytic effect of TNFα in primary cultures of adipocytes can be attributed mainly to a decrease in the concentration of Gi proteins. Further work will be required to determine the mechanism by which TNFα decreases cellular concentrations of Gi. We are grateful to Dr. Dianne DeCamp (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) for generously providing us with recombinant human TNFα and to Professor Graeme Milligan (University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland) for the antisera used in these studies."

Using bovine nasal cartilage conditioned media as a source of the aggrecanase enzyme, an enzymatic assay was established employing purified aggrecan monomers as a substrate and monitoring specific aggrecanase-mediated cleavage products by Western analysis using the monoclonal antibody, BC-3 (which recognizes the new N terminus, ARGS, on fragments produced by cleavage between amino acid residues Glu373 and Ala374). Using this assay we have characterized cartilage aggrecanase with respect to assay kinetics, pH and salt optima, heat sensitivity, and stability upon storage. Aggrecanase activity was inhibited by the metalloprotease inhibitor, EDTA, while a panel of inhibitors of serine, cysteine, and aspartic proteinases had no effect, suggesting that aggrecanase is a metalloproteinase. Sensitivity to known matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors as well as to the endogenous tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, TIMP-1, further support the notion that aggrecanase is a metalloproteinase potentially related to the ADAM family or MMP family of proteases previously implicated in the catabolism of the extracellular matrix.

The aggregating cartilage proteoglycan, aggrecan, along with type II collagen, is responsible for the mechanical properties of articular cartilage. Aggrecan molecules are composed of two N-terminal globular domains, G1 and G2, which are separated by an interglobular domain (IGD), 1The abbreviations used are: IGD, interglobular domain; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; IL, interleukin; TIMP-1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; APMA, 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.followed by a long central glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment region and a C-terminal globular domain, G3(1Hardingham T.E.

Wiedemann H. Beardmore-Gray M. Dunham D. Hardingham T.E. Heinegard D. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These aggrecan monomers interact through the G1domain with hyaluronic acid and link protein to form large molecular weight aggregates which are trapped within the cartilage matrix (3Hardingham T.E.

Aggrecan provides normal cartilage with it properties of compressibility and resilience, and is one of the first matrix components to undergo measurable loss in arthritis. This loss appears to be due to an increased rate of aggrecan degradation that can be attributed to proteolytic cleavage within the IGD of the core protein. Cleavage within this region generates large C-terminal, GAG-containing aggrecan fragments lacking the G1 domain which are unable to bind to hyaluronic acid and thus diffuse out of the cartilage matrix. Two major sites of proteolytic cleavage have been identified within the IGD: one between amino acid residues Asn341 and Phe342 and the other between amino acid residues Glu373 and Ala374. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, and 13) have been shown in vitroto cleave within the IGD predominately at the Asn341-Phe342 site (6Fosang A.J. Neame P.J. Hardingham T.E.

This uncharacterized activity has been given the name “aggrecanase” based on its ability to cleave the aggrecan core protein. Four other potential aggrecanase sites have been identified within the C-terminal region of aggrecan between G2 and G3 (14Leulakis P. Shirkhanda A.V. Davis G. Maniglia C.A. Biochem.

Recent work using an artificial recombinant protein comprising the IGD sequence of aggrecan, rAgg1, as a substrate, has identified activity in media from retinoic acid-stimulated rat chondrosarcoma cell cultures which cleaves at the Glu373-Ala374 bond (22Hughes C.E.

However, the protease responsible for this cleavage remains unidentified and uncharacterized. In this paper we describe the generation of soluble, active aggrecanase activity in conditioned media from interleukin-1 (IL-1)-stimulated bovine nasal cartilage. Using this source of aggrecanase, we have developed an enzymatic assay employing purified native aggrecan monomers as the substrate and detection of specific products of aggrecanase-mediated cleavage by Western analysis with the monoclonal antibody, BC-3 (23Hughes C.E. Caterson B. Fosang A.J. Roughley P.J. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), which recognizes the new N terminus ARGSV on fragments produced by cleavage at the aggrecanase site. We have performed initial enzymatic characterization of the soluble cartilage aggrecanase activity generated in response to IL-1. The work described herein provides a method for generating soluble aggrecanase activity and an assay for monitoring this activity which should serve as important tools to enable the isolation, purification, and molecular characterization of the enzyme. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). The IL-1 used was a soluble, fully active recombinant human IL-1β produced as described previously (24Huang J.J. Newton R.C. Pezzella K. Covington M. Tamblyn T. Rutledge S.J. Kelley M. Gray J. Lin Y.

The specific activity was 1 × 107 units/mg of protein, with 1 unit being defined as the amount of IL-1 that generated half-maximal activity in the thymocyte proliferation assay.

Chondroitinase ABC lyase (Proteus vulgaris) (EC 4.2.2.4), keratanase (Pseudomonas sp.) (EC 3.2.1.103), and keratanase II (Bacillus sp.) were from Seikuguku (Kogyo, Japan). Full-length bovine tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases-1 (TIMP-1) was from Calbiochem (Cambridge, MA). The protease inhibitors, antipain dihydrochloride, aprotinin, bestatin, chymotrypsin, E-64, EDTA, leupeptin, Pefabloc, pepstatin, and phosphoramidon were from Boehringer-Mannheim (Indianapolis, IN). The hydroxamic acid MMP inhibitors, BB-16 ((2S,3R)-2-methyl-3-(2-methylpropyl)-1-(N-hydroxy)-4-(o-methyl)-l-tyrosine-N-methyl amide), XS309 ([3S-[3R*, 2-[2R*,2-(R*,S*)]-hexahydro-2-[2-[2-(hydroxyamino)-1-methyl-2-oxoethyl]-4-methyl-1-oxopentyl]-N-methyl-3-pyridazinecarboxamide), and SA751 (N-[1(R)-Carboxyethyl]-a-(S)-(4-phenyl-3-butynyl)glycyl-l-O-methyltyrosine,N-methylamide) were synthesized at DuPont Pharmaceuticals as described previously (25.Campion, C., Davidson, A.

BB-16 and XS309 are potent nanomolar inhibitors of a number of MMPs, including MMP-1, -2, -3, -8, and -9, while SA751 is a selective MMP-8 inhibitor with a K iof 2 nm against MMP-8 and a K i of >10,000 nm against MMP-3 and MMP-1. Bovine nasal cartilage septa were removed from bovine noses obtained fresh at the time of slaughter. Uniform cartilage disks (1 mm thick, 8 mm in diameter) were prepared. Prior to organ culture studies, disks were equilibrated in tissue culture for at least 3 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, amphotericin B, and neomycin (100 IU/ml, 100 μg/ml, 0.25 μg/ml, and 50 μg/ml, respectively). Cartilage slices were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics as above at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 in the presence of 500 ng/ml IL-1β. Media were replaced every 2 days for the first 6 days of culture and saved at −70 °C for analysis. Cartilage was then incubated with IL-1 (500 ng/ml) from days 6 to 18 without media change to allow accumulation of aggrecanase activity in the media. Media were sampled every 2 days and saved at −70 °C for analysis. In some cases, at the end of incubation cartilage was digested with papain and the GAG content of the digest determined. Sulfated GAG in culture media or cartilage digests were monitored by the amount of polyanionic material reacting with 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (27Farndale R.W. Sayers C.A. Barrett A.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1982; 9: 247-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar, 28.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar), using shark chondroitin sulfate as a standard. GAG release is reported as micrograms of GAG per mg wet weight cartilage or as percent of total GAG. Culture media were diluted 1:20 with water and 15 μl mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer (0.5m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol) (Novex, San Diego, CA), incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gels containing 0.1% gelatin in running buffer (0.24 m Tris, 2 m glycine, 35 mm SDS, pH 8.3) for 90 min at 125 volts. The gels were renatured in 2.5% Triton X-100 in water for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated at 37 °C overnight in developing buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 0.02% Brij 35, pH 7.6). After incubation, gels were stained in 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for 4 h at room temperature and destained in distilled water containing 30% methanol and 10% glacial acetic acid to reveal zones of lysis within the gelatin matrix. EDTA (5 mm), E64 (10 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), or benzamidine HCl (10 mm) or XS309 (1 μm) were added to the developing buffer to identify which classes of proteinases were responsible for lysis of the gelatin. Casein labeled with resorufin (43.5 μm) was incubated with protease-containing media in a final volume of 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm CaCl2 at pH 7.8 at 37 °C as described previously (29Tortorella M.D. Arner E.C. Inflamm. Res. 1997; 46 Suppl. 2: S122-S123Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The reactions were stopped and unclipped substrate precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5%. Samples were filtered through a 96-well filtration plate (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA) and filtrates collected and neutralized by addition of 2 m Tris to each well. The absorbance was then read at 575 nm. The concentration of the resorufin-labeled peptides in the filtrate, as determined from a standard curve, was used as a measure of proteolytic activity. Some conditioned medium samples were assayed in the presence of 2 mm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) to activate latent matrix metalloproteinases. With some samples EDTA was included to inhibit metalloproteinase activity or XS309 was included to inhibit matrix metalloproteinase activity. For analysis of aggrecan fragments generated by specific cleavage at the Glu373-Ala374 site, proteoglycans and proteoglycan metabolites were enzymatically deglycosylated with chondroitinase ABC (0.1 units/10 μg of GAG) for 2 h at 37 °C and then with keratanase (0.1 units/10 μg of GAG) and keratanase II (0.002 units/10 μg of GAG) for 2 h at 37 °C in buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate, 0.1 mTris/HCl, pH 6.5 (23Hughes C.E. Caterson B. Fosang A.J. Roughley P.J. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The digests were monitored by measuring the decrease in dimethylmethylene blue reactivity. After digestion, the samples were precipitated with 5 volumes of acetone and reconstituted in an appropriate volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Equivalent amounts of GAG from each sample were loaded on 4–12% gradient gels and then separated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, transferred overnight to nitrocellulose, and immunolocated with 1:1000 dilution of the monoclonal antibody BC-3 (22Hughes C.E.

Overnight transfer resulted in complete transfer of low and high molecular weight standards and samples as determined by evaluating the gel by colloidal Coomassie analysis (Novex, San Diego, CA) following protein transfer; no detectable levels of protein remained in the gel. Subsequently, membranes were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate and aggrecan catabolites visualized by incubation with the appropriate substrate (Promega Western blot alkaline phosphatase system) for 10–30 min to achieve optimal color development. BC-3-reactive aggrecan fragments were then quantified by scanning densitometry. For quantitation, the stained blots were captured on a UVP Imagestore 7500 Camera System (Cambridge, UK) with GelBase Pro system software. The integrated pixel density of the bands was quantified using IPLAB GEL software and data obtained only in the 10-fold linear detection range and reported as sum total pixels. Bovine nasal cartilage septa were removed from bovine noses obtained fresh at slaughter. The aggrecan was isolated from the cartilage by extraction at 4 °C for 48 h with 4 m guanidine-HCl, 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 5.8, containing the protease inhibitors disodium EDTA, 6-aminohexanoic acid, phenymethanesulfonyl fluoride, and benzamidine HCl. The aggrecan monomers were isolated by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation in cesium chloride (30Hascall V.C. Sajdera S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2384-2396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the bottom of this gradient (d > 1.54 g/ml) containing the monomers was dialyzed at 4 °C against water using M r10,000 cutoff membranes, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C. Aggrecan substrate was prepared by dissolving lyophilized aggrecan monomers in buffer at a concentration based on the assumption of a molecular weight of 1 × 10−6. Conditioned medium from bovine nasal cartilage stimulated with IL-1 were filtered to remove any particulate matter using a Corning 0.45-micron filter prior to use in the enzymatic assay. Medium was then incubated with purified native bovine aggrecan monomers with intact GAG chains in a final volume of 200 μl in 20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2 buffer at pH 7.5. At the end of the incubation the reaction was quenched with 20 mm EDTA, the aggrecan was deglycosylated with chondroitinase ABC, keratanase, and keratanase II, and the aggrecanase-generated products were detected by BC-3 Western blot analysis as described above. In initial enzymatic assays, product generation was quantitated by scanning all BC-3-reactive bands. However, under the conditions used for the enzymatic assay, quantitation of the predominant 250-kDa band, which represents the initial product detected, gave equivalent results to quantitation of both this band and the minor lower molecular mass bands. Therefore, product generation was routinely assessed by quantitation of the 250-kDa band. Based on kinetic analysis, the following conditions were established for the assay: 50 μl of aggrecanase-containing medium was incubated with 500 nmaggrecan substrate in a final volume of 200 μl at 37 °C for 4 h as indicated above. pH activity profiles were performed in 50 mm MES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2 buffer and pH was adjusted using 5 n HCl. Inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide as a 10 mmstock and added to the reaction mixture immediately prior to enzyme addition. Dimethyl sulfoxide concentrations in the enzyme assay never exceeded 1%; this concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide had no effect on aggrecanase activity. Incubation of bovine nasal cartilage with 500 ng/ml IL-1 for 6 days, with media replaced every 2 days, induced the degradation and release of aggrecan from the cartilage (Fig.1). By monitoring the amount of GAG remaining in the cartilage at the end of the incubation, percent release of GAG from the tissue was determined at each time period; greater than 95% release of GAG was achieved by day 6. Cartilage was then incubated with IL-1 for an additional 10–12 days without media change to allow aggrecanase to accumulate in the media. To evaluate the time course of aggrecanase activity generation, samples of conditioned media were taken from cultures at various times during incubation with IL-1 and evaluated for aggrecanase activity. Incubation of this conditioned media with aggrecan substrate for 4 h resulted in the generation of fragments cleaved at the Glu373-Ala374 site as detected by BC-3 Western analysis (Fig. 2). Media quenched with EDTA prior to incubation with aggrecan served as assay blanks to control for fragments present in the media prior to enzymatic assay. Incubation of the aggrecan substrate alone did not result in the generation of BC-3-reactive fragments (data not shown).Figure 2Time course of aggrecanase generation in media from IL-1-stimulated bovine nasal cartilage. Bovine nasal cartilage slices were incubated with 500 ng/ml IL-1 for 18 days with media being replaced every 2 days for the first 6 days of culture. Samples of media taken at various times during culture were assayed for aggrecanase activity by incubating with aggrecan substrate (500 nm) for 4 h at 37 °C and evaluating products by BC-3 Western blot analysis. Media quenched with EDTA prior to incubation with substrate served as assay blanks (lanes labeledB at each time point).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although BC-3 Western blot analysis was routinely used to monitor aggrecan fragments produced by cleavage at the Glu373-Ala374 bond, initially digests generated by aggrecanase cleavage of exogenous aggrecan monomers were also analyzed by NITEGE Western blot and by biotinylated hyaluronic acid binding to confirm results with the BC-3 antibody. Time course analyses showed that the G1-NITEGE fragment was generated simultaneously with the BC-3 epitope supporting cleavage at the Glu373-Ala374 bond by aggrecanase. 2M. D. Tortorella, M. A. Pratta, and E. C. Arner, unpublished data. The band of aggrecan fragments expressing the NITEGE epitope appeared as a doublet between 64 and 70 kDa, consistent with the G1-NITEGE products previously obtained following IL-1β treatment of bovine chondrocytes (18Lark M.W. Gordy J.T. Weidner J.R. Ayala J. Kimura J.H. Williams H.R. Mumford R.A. Flannery C.R. Carisoni S.S. Iwatai M. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2550-2556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). High background levels of BC-3-reactive fragments produced in response to IL-1-induced degradation of the cartilage matrix were observed in media on day 2 and day 4 (Fig. 2). However, subtraction of background levels of BC-3 from the levels present following the enzymatic assay indicated that aggrecanase activity was present even at these early time periods. By day 6 of culture, BC-3-reactive fragments were no longer detected in conditioned media. Incubation of day 6 media with 500 nm aggrecan substrate for 4 h resulted in the formation of a BC-3-reactive, aggrecanase-generated product of ∼250 kDa. Aggrecanase activity accumulated in the media as the enzyme activity was monitored from days 6 to 16. In media from cultures stimulated for 10 days or greater, additional minor BC-3- reactive bands that migrated between 100 and 250 kDa were detected. In order to establish appropriate assay conditions and evaluate aggrecanase kinetic properties, the effect of incubation time, enzyme concentration, and substrate concentration on product formation were evaluated. Linearity of product formation was observed up to 4 h (Fig.3 A), and over enzyme concentrations between 25 and 80 μl of conditioned media (Fig.3 B). Aggrecanase activity appeared to approach saturation with respect to aggrecan substrate at 500–1000 nM (Fig.3 C). However, increasing viscosity precluded use of higher substrate concentrations. Aggrecanase activity was found to be stable during storage at −70, −20, or 4 °C in culture media; greater than 90% of the activity was recovered after 14 days or longer storage at −70, −20, and 4 °C. Activity was also stable to repeated freeze-thaw cycles of −70 to 4 °C. Heating at 42 °C for 15 min did not affect activity, but activity was completely lost following 15 min heating at 56 °C or above. Using the assay conditions defined above, we studied the salt and pH optimum of crude aggrecanase present in conditioned medium. Optimal activity was achieved with 100 mm NaCl. At 250 mm NaCl, activity was decreased by ∼50% and was completely lost at 500 mm NaCl or higher (Fig. 4). The pH optimum for aggrecanase was found to be at 7.5 (Fig.5). However, a rather broad pH range between 6.5 and 9.5 supported greater than 75% of the activity seen at the pH optimum.Figure 5Affect of pH on aggrecanase activity.Aggrecanase-containing media were incubated with 500 nmaggrecan substrate for 4 h in 50 mm MES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2 buffer with pH adjusted using 5 n HCl. Product was monitored by BC-3 Western blot analysis and activity plotted as a percent of maximal activity versus pH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Aggrecanase activity was inhibited by the metalloprotease inhibitor, EDTA, while a panel of inhibitors of serine, cysteine, and aspartic proteinases had no effect (Table I). The ability of the endogenous inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase, TIMP-1, to block aggrecanase activity was investigated using full-length recombinant bovine TIMP-1. TIMP-1 caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of aggrecanase activity (Fig. 6). The IC50 was estimated from the concentration-response curve to be 210 nm. However, TIMP-2 at concentrations up to 1 μm was inactive against aggrecanase (data not shown).Table IEffect of protease inhibitors on aggrecanase activityInhibitorConcentrationaProtease inhibitors were used at the"

Specifically, the enzyme is first phosphorylated at the activation loop by another kinase, followed by two ordered autophosphorylations at the carboxyl terminus (Keranen, L. M., Dutil, E. M., and Newton, A. C. (1995) Curr. Biol. 5, 1394–1403). This study examines the role of negative charge at the first conserved carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation position, Thr-641, in regulating the function and subcellular localization of protein kinase C βII. Mutation of this residue to Ala results in compensating phosphorylations at adjacent sites, so that a triple Ala mutant was required to address the function of phosphate at Thr-641. Biochemical and immunolocalization analyses of phosphorylation site mutants reveal that negative charge at this position is required for the following: 1) to process catalytically competent protein kinase C; 2) to allow autophosphorylation of Ser-660; 3) for cytosolic localization of protein kinase C; and 4) to permit phorbol ester-dependent membrane translocation. Thus, phosphorylation of Thr-641 in protein kinase C βII is essential for both the catalytic function and correct subcellular localization of protein kinase C. The conservation of this residue in every protein kinase C isozyme, as well as other members of the kinase superfamily such as protein kinase A, suggests that carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation serves as a key molecular switch for defining kinase function. Protein kinase C is processed by three phosphorylation events before it is competent to respond to second messengers. Specifically, the enzyme is first phosphorylated at the activation loop by another kinase, followed by two ordered autophosphorylations at the carboxyl terminus (Keranen, L. M., Dutil, E.

Thus, phosphorylation of Thr-641 in protein kinase C βII is essential for both the catalytic function and correct subcellular localization of protein kinase C. The conservation of this residue in every protein kinase C isozyme, as well as other members of the kinase superfamily such as protein kinase A, suggests that carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation serves as a key molecular switch for defining kinase function. The protein kinase C family of enzymes transduce the myriad of extracellular signals that promote phospholipid hydrolysis (1Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). Generation of diacylglycerol, typically in the plasma membrane, activates most members of this class of kinases by recruiting them to membranes, where they are activated by interaction with the phospholipid, phosphatidylserine (2Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Binding of both diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine to the protein results in a conformational change that removes an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate domain from the active site, thus allowing substrate binding and catalysis (3Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite 2 decades of studying the regulation of protein kinase C, it has only recently been appreciated that the enzyme must be phosphorylated before it is competent to respond to second messengers. Pulse-chase experiments by Fabbro and co-workers (4Borner C. Filipuzzi I. Wartmann M. Eppenberger U. Fabbro D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13902-13909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the late 1980s provided the first evidence that protein kinase C is phosphorylatedin vivo. Specifically, they showed that protein kinase C is first synthesized as an inactive, dephosphorylated precursor with an apparent molecular mass of 74 kDa that associates with the detergent-insoluble fraction of cells; this species was chased to a transient 77-kDa phospho-form and then to the final 80-kDa mature form that localized to the cytosol (4Borner C. Filipuzzi I. Wartmann M. Eppenberger U. Fabbro D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13902-13909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison with protein kinase A suggested that one of the phosphorylation sites was a conserved Thr on the activation loop that is located near the entrance to the active site; phosphorylation on this loop controls the function of a large number of kinases (5Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In support of this, replacement of the potential phosphorylated Thr on the activation loop of protein kinase C α with Ala, or of protein kinase C βII with Val, resulted in inactive enzyme (6Cazaubon S. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 7Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas replacement with Glu in protein kinase C βII resulted in activable enzyme (7Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mass spectrometric analysis later established that protein kinase C α and βII are phosphorylated at three positions in vivo (8Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar): in protein kinase C βII these correspond to Thr-500 on the activation loop and Thr-641 and Ser-660 on the enzyme's carboxyl terminus (8Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 9Tsutakawa S.E. Medzihradszky K.F. Flint A.J. Burlingame A.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26807-26812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). These residues are conserved among all protein kinase C isozymes, with the exception of two isozymes (protein kinase C ζ and ι) which have a Glu at the position corresponding to Ser-660 (8Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation on the activation loop is required to process mature protein kinase C, phosphatase treatment of the mature enzyme revealed that phosphate on Thr-500 is no longer required for activity once Thr-641 has been phosphorylated. Specifically, kinase activity is retained upon dephosphorylation of Thr-500 and Ser-660 but not Thr-641. In contrast, additional dephosphorylation of Thr-641 results in complete loss of activity (8Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 10Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first phosphorylation event of protein kinase C βII, that of Thr-500, is mediated by another protein kinase (8Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 11Cazaubon S.M. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17559-17563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with recent studies showing that the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase, PDK-1, can mediate this phosphorylation both for conventional (12Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and atypical (13Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Grahan L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.-S.

Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) protein kinase Cs. This phosphorylation is followed by rapid phosphorylations at the two carboxyl-terminal positions, with in vivo data suggesting that Thr-641 precedes phosphorylation of Ser-660 (8Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of Ser-660 to Glu or Ala recently revealed that phosphate at this position is not critical for function; rather, it structures determinants in both the active site and regulatory region thereby allowing tighter binding of both substrates and cofactors (15Edwards A.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18382-18390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Similar mutagenesis of Ser-657 in protein kinase C α showed that, in addition to increasing the stability of the protein, negative charge at this position increases the phosphatase resistance of protein kinase C (16Bornancin F. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3544-3549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This residue is part of an unusual hydrophobic phosphorylation motif (FXXF(S/T)(F/Y)) that is found in a number of other kinases such as S6 kinase and protein kinase B (Akt kinase) (17Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.-W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E.H. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 18Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation studies implicate Thr-641 as being the key switch for locking protein kinase C in a catalytically competent conformation; for mature enzyme previously processed by phosphorylation, phosphate at this position is required and is sufficient for maximal catalysis (8Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 10Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, mutagenesis studies have provided conflicting results on the role of this residue. Mutagenesis studies with protein kinase C βI suggested that phosphorylation here is essential for activity (19Zhang J. Wang L. Schwartz J. Bond R.W. Bishop W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas similar studies with protein kinase C α concluded that this residue is not essential for activity (20Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1114-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The possibility of compensating phosphorylations was not taken into account in these studies. Protein kinase C has also been shown to autophosphorylate by an intramolecular reaction at a number of non-conserved residues in vitro (21Newton A.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10185-10188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Flint A.J. Paladini R.D. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1990; 249: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). One such residue in protein kinase C βII is Thr-634, which neighbors the in vivo site, Thr-641. It is noteworthy that neither the in vivo nor in vitroautophosphorylation sites conform to “consensus” phosphorylation motifs for protein kinase C (23Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.-J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar); for intramolecular reactions, the high local concentration of substrate may ablate the necessity for optimal substrate binding. This study explores the role of phosphorylation of Thr-641 in regulating protein kinase C βII. Analysis of phosphorylation site mutants reveals that lack of negative charge at this position 1) results in expression of inactive enzyme, 2) prevents autophosphorylation at the second carboxyl-terminal site, 3) causes association of the protein with the detergent-insoluble cell fraction, and 4) prevents the enzyme from translocating to the plasma membrane in response to phorbol esters. As part of this work, we discovered that the mutation of both Thr-634 and Thr-641 to Ala results in a compensating phosphorylation at a neighboring residue that mimics the effect of phospho-Thr-641, underscoring the importance of negative charge on the carboxyl terminus for the function of protein kinase C. Thus, this residue serves as a key molecular switch in regulating protein kinase C. Its conservation in a number of other kinases suggests that protein kinases are regulated by two phosphorylation switch mechanisms: the well characterized phosphorylation of the activation loop, and phosphorylation events at the carboxyl terminus described in this report.

Expression vectors encoding the cDNA sequence of protein kinase C βII with mutation of Ser-660 to Ala or Glu were made as described previously (15Edwards A.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18382-18390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The T634A/T641A double mutant in pBluescript and in baculovirus was a generous gift of Drs. A. J. Flint and D. E. Koshland, Jr. The T641E and T634A/T641A/S654A mutants were made by polymerase chain reaction using wild-type protein kinase C βII or the Thr-634/Thr-641 mutant, respectively, in the pBlueScript vector (pBluePKC) as the template. The sense primer used for both mutants was GGAGCATGCATTTTTCCG and contained an NsiI restriction site. Antisense primers corresponding to the sequence around the codon for Thr-641 or Ser-654 and containing the necessary nucleic acid changes to encode the desired mutation were ATCCTTCGAATTCTGCTTGGTCAATATTCCTG (S654A mutation) and ATCCTTCGAATTCTGATTGGTCAATATTCCTGATGACTTCCTGGTCAGGAGGTTCTAGGACTGGTGG (T641E mutation). These antisense primers contained aBstBI restriction site. The polymerase chain reaction product and the pBluePKC template were digested with NsiI and BstBI (unique sites in pBluePKC), and the products were gel-purified and ligated together. The mutant protein kinase C gene was then subcloned into pcDNA3 (for mammalian expression) usingXhoI/XbaI or into the pVL1393 baculovirus transfer vector (Invitrogen) as described (15Edwards A.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18382-18390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The sequence of all mutants was verified by DNA sequencing. DNA (5–10 μg per 10-cm plate) encoding wild-type protein kinase C βII or its mutants was introduced into COS-7 cells by calcium-phosphate transfection. Cells were lysed by sonication in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 85 μm leupeptin, 2 mm benzamidine, and 100 nm microcystin (lysis buffer). A portion of the lysate was retained, and the remainder was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytosol) was saved, and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. The resuspended pellet was centrifuged (100,000 ×g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant (membrane) and pellet (detergent-insoluble) fractions were saved. All fractions were diluted 2-fold in glycerol and stored at −20 °C. For some experiments, cells were treated with 200 nm PDBu for 20 min prior to cell lysis. Sf21 insect cells were infected with baculovirus encoding wild-type protein kinase C βII or its mutants, and the detergent-soluble supernatants were analyzed for protein kinase C activity as described (15Edwards A.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18382-18390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Aliquots of cell lysate, cytosol, detergent-soluble supernatant (membrane), or detergent-insoluble pellet from COS-7 cells expressing wild-type protein kinase C βII or the phosphorylation site mutants were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7% polyacrylamide). The proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon-P, Millipore) and probed with antibodies to the carboxyl terminus of protein kinase C βII and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Labeling was detected using chemiluminescence. cDNA encoding wild-type protein kinase C βII (50 ng) or the T641AAA mutant (1 μg) in pcDNA3 were incubated with 20 μl of the cell-free transcription/translation lysate provided by Promega, in the presence of 0.4 μm[35S]methionine (1175 Ci mmol−1) following the manufacturer's protocol. After 90 min incubation at 30 °C, lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant and pellet were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by detection of radioactivity using a Bio-Rad Imager or autoradiography. Protein kinase C activity in 3–5 μl of detergent-soluble fractions was assayed by measuring the rate of phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide in the presence or absence of brain phosphatidylserine, diacylglycerol, and Ca2+, essentially as described (25Orr J.W. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4661-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (80 μl) contained 50 μm protein kinase C-selective peptide (see “Materials and Methods”) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5 at 30 °C), 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (0.1 μCi nmol−1), 5 mm MgCl2, and either 0.5 mmCa2+ and lipid (sonicated dispersion of brain phosphatidylserine (140 μm) and diacylglycerol (3.8 μm), prepared as described (21Newton A.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10185-10188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) or 0.5 mmEGTA. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 4–6 min and quenched by the addition of 25 μl of a solution containing 0.1 m ATP and 0.1 m EDTA (pH 8–9). Aliquots (85 μl) were spotted on P81 ion-exchange chromatography paper and washed 4 times with 0.4% (v/v) phosphoric acid, followed by a 95% ethanol rinse, and32P incorporation was detected by liquid scintillation counting in 5 ml of scintillation fluid (Biosafe II, Research Products International Corp.). COS-7 cells were grown to confluency on glass coverslips and transfected with 1–2 μg of the indicated protein kinase C βII plasmid cDNA expression constructs using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Cells were incubated with the DNA for 16 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated for an additional 48 h in fresh growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin). In some cases, cells were incubated with 100 nm PMA for 15 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were then washed twice with PBS, fixed for 10 min in PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde, washed with PBS, and permeabilized for 1 min in ice-cold acetone. Cells were washed with PBS and blocked for 30 min in PBS, 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated for 1 h with primary antibody (1:500 dilution of mouse anti-protein kinase C α/β, Transduction Laboratories; 1:100 dilution of rabbit anti-calreticulin, Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.) and washed three times with PBS, 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then incubated for 1 h with fluorescent secondary antibodies (donkey anti-mouse Texas Red or donkey anti-rabbit Cy5, Jackson Immunoresearch; fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin, Molecular Probes), followed by washing with PBS, 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The coverslips were then mounted on glass slides using the Prolong system (Molecular Probes), and indirect immunofluorescent staining was detected in successive focal planes using a UV-visible laser-scanning confocal microscope system (Bio-Rad). A series of mutants at each of the two carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites in protein kinase C βII, Thr-641 and Ser-660, were constructed in order to assess how phosphorylation at these positions modulates the function of protein kinase C. Hydroxyl-containing residues were replaced with either Glu as a mimic of phosphate (26Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10422-10425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the neutral, non-phosphorylatable residue, Ala. Initial studies focused on analyzing a protein kinase C mutant in which Thr-641 (in vivo autophosphorylation site) and Thr-634 (in vitro autophosphorylation site) were mutated to Ala (Fig. 1). However, biochemical analysis revealed that this mutant did not mimic protein dephosphorylated on Thr-641. First, the double mutant T634A/T641A displayed the same electrophoretic mobility as wild-type enzyme. Because phosphorylation of Thr-641 causes an approximately 2-kDa shift in electrophoretic mobility (8Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), this result indicated that incorporation of a phosphate at an additional (compensating) site was causing an equivalent mobility shift (8Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Second, phosphatase treatment caused the same effects on the T634A/T641A mutant and wild-type enzyme. Specifically, protein phosphatase 1 caused a large electrophoretic mobility shift and complete loss of activity; in wild-type enzyme, this large shift and loss of activity result from dephosphorylation at two carboxyl-terminal positions, Thr-641 and Ser-660. In addition, protein phosphatase 2A caused a small electrophoretic mobility shift with no loss of activity; in wild-type enzyme this smaller shift results from loss of phosphate at one carboxyl-terminal position, Ser-660 (10Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data revealed that mutation of position 634 and 641 to Ala resulted in a compensating phosphorylation that mimicked the effect of phosphorylation of Thr-641 in all parameters tested. Analysis of the sequence around Thr-641 indicated a possible candidate for such a compensating phosphorylation, Ser-654. To eliminate any potential compensating phosphorylation at residues near Thr-641, we constructed a triple mutant T634A/T641A/S654A. This mutant is referred to as T641AAA henceforth. Wild-type protein kinase C and four phosphorylation site mutants, T641E, T641AAA, S660A, and S660E, were expressed in COS-7 cells, and their subcellular partitioning and electrophoretic mobilities were compared in Fig. 2. As reported previously, wild-type enzyme from cell lysate migrated as two major species (lane 1): the slowest migrating species partitioned in the detergent-soluble fraction (lane 2, **) and the fastest migrating species partitioned in the detergent-insoluble fraction (lane 3, −). We have previously established that the slower migrating form is quantitatively phosphorylated at Thr-641 and Ser-660, 2This species is approximately 60% phosphorylated on Thr-500; negative charge at this position does not alter the protein's electrophoretic mobility (8Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). and the fastest migrating species is not phosphorylated at the carboxyl terminus (8Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). A minor intermediate species was also visible (lane 3, *); previous analyses showed that this intermediate species is phosphorylated at Thr-641 but not Ser-660 (8Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Under the expression conditions in Fig. 1, approximately 10% of the total protein kinase C βII migrated as the dephosphorylated form partitioning in the detergent-insoluble fraction (−); however, this percentage depended on protein expression levels, with increased expression typically resulting in increased representation of the dephosphorylated species. Replacement of Thr-641 with Glu resulted in expression of protein whose electrophoretic mobility and subcellular fractionation pattern was similar to that of wild-type enzyme except that the fastest migrating form was absent. Specifically, T641E in cell lysate migrated as two species (lane 4), with the slowest species co-migrating with fully phosphorylated wild-type enzyme (**) and, like mature wild-type enzyme, partitioned in the detergent-soluble fraction (lane 5). The fastest migrating form had an apparent mass of 78 kDa (*), co-migrating with wild-type enzyme containing a single phosphate on its carboxyl terminus and partitioned in the detergent-insoluble fraction (lane 6). These data reveal that Glu at position 641 mimics phosphate in causing a decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of the enzyme. The T641AAA mutant migrated as a single band corresponding to completely dephosphorylated protein kinase C (−); this mutant partitioned equally in the detergent-soluble (lane 8) and detergent-insoluble (lane 9) fractions. The lack of bands co-migrating with partially phosphorylated species of protein kinase C indicated that the mutant was not phosphorylated on Ser-660 nor at any other position on the carboxyl terminus that could alter the electrophoretic mobility of the protein. Note that a minor slower migrating band is visible in the lysate (lane 7) and, to a lesser extent, in the pellet (lane 9). This band is not protein kinase C βII; first, it is present in control COS cells transfected with pcDNA3 vector alone, and second, it is not labeled with a different antibody that labels the kinase domain in a phosphorylation-independent manner (data not shown). Because the Ala mutants expressed less well than wild-type or Glu mutants, twice as much cell extract of the former is loaded on gels. Expression of S660A in COS-7 cells resulted in the appearance of two bands in the lysate. Fig. 2, lane 10, shows a major band co-migrating with dephosphorylated wild-type enzyme (−) and a minor band co-migrating with wild-type enzyme modified at only one carboxyl-terminal position (*). Both species were present in the detergent-soluble (lane 11) and detergent-insoluble (lane 12) fractions. The S660E mutant also migrated as two bands in the lysate (lane 13). However, the mobilities of the bands were shifted by approximately 2 kDa compared with the Ala mutant, so that the fastest migrating band co-migrated with wild-type enzyme with one carboxyl-terminal phosphate (*) and the slowest migrating band co-migrated with wild-type enzyme with two carboxyl-terminal phosphates (**). Thus, Ala at position 660 mimicked protein with no phosphate at that position, whereas Glu at that position mimicked protein with phosphate at that position, as reported previously based on baculovirus expression studies (15Edwards A.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18382-18390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition, the ratios and subcellular fractionation patterns of the two species were comparable to that of wild-type enzyme; the upper band was the major species and partitioned in the detergent-soluble fraction (lane 14) and lower band was the minor species and localized to the detergent-insoluble fraction (lane 15). In summary, the T641E and S660E mutants did not contain species co-migrating with the lowest 76-kDa band of wild-type enzyme, consistent with negative charge at either of these positions causing an apparent 2 kDa in electrophoretic mobility. Both T641E and S660E mutants contained species that co-migrated with the 78- and 80-kDa bands of wild-type protein, representing forms with negative charge at one (78 kDa) or both (80 kDa) carboxyl-terminal sites. The alanine mutants, on the other hand, lacked species c"

The function of this endothelial cell selective growth factor is mediated by two homologous tyrosine kinase receptors, fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (Flt-1) and kinase domain receptor (KDR). Although the functional consequence of vascular endothelial growth factor binding to the Flt-1 receptor is not fully understood, it is well established that mitogenic signaling is mediated by KDR. Upon sequencing several independent cDNA clones spanning the cytoplasmic region of human KDR, we identified and confirmed the identity of a functionally required valine at position 848 in the ATP binding site, rather than the previously reported glutamic acid residue, which corresponds to an inactive tyrosine kinase. The cytoplasmic domain of recombinant native KDR, expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, can undergo autophosphorylation in the presence of ATP. In addition, the kinase activity can be substantially increased by autophosphorylation at physiologic ATP concentrations. Mutation analysis indicates that both tyrosine residues 1054 and 1059 are required for activation, which is a consequence of an increased affinity for both ATP and the peptide substrate and has no effect on k cat, the intrinsic catalytic activity of the enzyme. KDR kinase catalyzes phosphotransfer by formation of a ternary complex with ATP and the peptide substrate. We demonstrate that tyrosine kinase antagonists can preferentially inhibit either the unactivated or activated form of the enzyme.

Angiogenesis is critical for normal embryogenesis, growth, and tissue repair. Pathological angiogenesis, however, can support tumor growth and possibly lead to metastatic spread (reviewed in Ref. 1Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, neoangiogenesis in ischemic ocular retinal diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and possibly age-related macular degeneration, can culminate in blindness. Tumor angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis (2Kim K.J. Li B. Winer J. Armanini M. Gillett N. Phillips H.S. Ferrara N.

These receptors can be divided into three structural regions: seven extracellular Ig-like domains that contain the growth factor binding sites, a single polypeptide chain hydrophobic transmembrane sequence, and intracellular cytoplasmic domains that confer the tyrosine kinase activity required for signal transduction. In addition, Flt-1 pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced to produce not only the full-length membrane-spanning form but also a soluble truncated version retaining the N-terminal six Ig-like extracellular domains containing the ligand binding sites that can heterodimerize with the corresponding region of KDR and antagonize the activity of VEGF in vitro (8Kendall R.L.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The HIV transcription factor, tat, has also been reported to bind to KDR and stimulate receptor autophosphorylation (13Ganju R.K. Munshi N. Nair B.C. Liu Z.-Y. Gill P. Groopma J.E. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although KDR is able to mediate VEGF-stimulated vascular endothelial cell mitogenesis, the functional role of full-length Flt-1 is not yet clear because it does not appear to transduce VEGF mitogenic signaling in these cells (14Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, although both the KDR and Flt-1 homozygous knockouts are each embryonically lethal, mice devoid of KDR contain few, if any, vascular endothelial cells, whereas those without Flt-1 have endothelial cell-lined vessels exhibiting a somewhat disorganized structure (15Fong G.-H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). KDR, which has not been shown to be alternatively spliced, was found to be an important mediator of VEGF function in endothelial cells through activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase (14Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neuropilin-1, recently found to be an isoform-specific VEGF receptor, does not have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and is not sufficient to mediate either a mitogenic or a chemotactic signal in response to VEGF binding but might enhance VEGF165 binding to KDR (16Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). KDR can be autophosphorylated on at least four tyrosine residues located within the cytoplasmic domains of the protein (17Dougher-Vermazen M. Hulmes J.D. Bohlen P. Terman B.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 728-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Two of these residues, tyrosines 1054 and 1059, are located in the activation loop of the tyrosine kinase domains. The other two tyrosine phosphorylation sites at amino acid positions 951 and 996 are located in a poorly conserved region, known as the tyrosine kinase insert loop, that is characteristic of type III receptor tyrosine kinases (18Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the corresponding tyrosines in PDGF β-receptor provide docking sites for downstream signal transduction proteins (18Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). We have cloned the KDR tyrosine kinase from a human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA library, and we report a functionally important discrepancy in the tyrosine kinase active site with the published sequence (6Terman B.I. Dougher-Vermazen M. Carrion M.E. Dimitrov D. Armellino D.C. Gospodarowicz D. Bohlen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). Using the active kinase, we found that phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine residues at positions 1054 and 1059 is required for activation of the catalytic activity of the KDR kinase. Finally, we demonstrated that antagonists of this tyrosine kinase can preferentially inhibit either the unactivated or activated form of the enzyme. [γ-33P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and the ECL kit were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. ATP and poly(Glu, Tyr) 4:1 (pEY) were from Sigma. All DNA modifying enzymes were from Promega unless otherwise stated. Staurosporine was from Calbiochem, and 3-(4-dimethylamino-benzylidene)-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-one was from Salor (Tokyo, Japan) or prepared as follows: equimolar quantities of oxindole (Aldrich, 318 mg, 2.4 mmol) and p-N,N-dimethylamino benzaldehyde (Aldrich, 350 mg, 2.4 mmol) were mixed in MeOH (5 ml). Piperidine was added (95 μl, 1 mmol), and the reaction was stirred at reflux for 3.5 h. The reaction was cooled to room temperature, and the orange solid was filtered and dried. 1H NMR and mass spectroscopy (M + 1)+265 data were consistent with the desired structure. The cDNA encoding human KDR was cloned from a human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA library as described (8Kendall R.L. Thomas K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10705-10709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). The 5′ end of the cytoplasmic region of KDR was modified by polymerase chain reaction to facilitate subsequent cloning steps by introduction of two silent mutations into the coding sequence to generate a KpnI (ACC 65 I) site at residues Gly800-Tyr801-Leu802 and to eliminate the endogenous BamHI site at Asp807. The cytoplasmic region of KDR was then cloned as a GST fusion into pBluebac 4 (Invitrogen). Using this construct as the template, site-directed mutagenesis was performed with QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Point mutations were introduced with the oligonucleotides 5′-GGT GCC TTT GGC CAA GAG ATT GAA GCA GAT GC-3′ and 5′-GC ATC TGC TTC AAT CTC TTG GCC AAA GGC ACC-3′ for the V848E mutant, 5′-G GCC CGG GAT ATT TTT AAA GAT CCA GAT TAT GTC AG-3′ and 5′-CT GAC ATA ATC TGG ATC TTT AAA AAT ATC CCG GGC C-3′ for the Y1054F mutant, 5′-CGG GAT ATT TAT AAA GAT CCA GAT TTT GTC AGA AAA GGA G-3′ and 5′-C TCC TTT TCT GAC AAA ATC TGG ATC TTT ATA AAT ATC CCG-3′ for the Y1059F mutant, and 5′-GCC CGG GAT ATT TTT AAA GAT CCA GAT TTT GTC AGA AAA GG-3′ and 5′-CC TTT TCT GAC AAA ATC TGG ATC TTT AAA AAT ATC CCG GGC-3′ for the Y1054F/Y1059F double mutant. The resultant changes were confirmed by DNA sequencing using an ABI 377 sequencer. The above cDNA constructs encoding either the wild-type or mutant cytoplasmic domain of KDR fused with GST were transfected into insect Sf21 cells with Bac-N-BlueTM transfection kit (Invitrogen) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Recombinant virus preparation and protein expression were done as described by Kendall and Thomas (8Kendall R.L. Thomas K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10705-10709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Cell pellets were lysed in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 0.5m NaCl; 5 mm dithiothreitol; 1 mmEDTA; 10% glycerol; 10 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin; and 1 mm phenylmethylsuflonyl fluoride) containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and the lysate was spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was batch adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was then transferred to a column and washed with 10 volumes of the above buffer followed by 10 volumes of Buffer A/0.05% Triton X-100 and eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in Buffer A/0.05% Triton X-100, pH 7.8. Protein concentration was measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and peak protein fractions were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer A containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and 50% glycerol. The purity of the kinases was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. The resulting protein preparations were generally 80–95% pure. Phosphorylation assays were carried out with 5 nm enzyme in kinase buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, and 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 15 min at 25 °C in a total volume of 50 μl. Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 30% trichloroacetic acid/0.1 m sodium pyrophosphate. Precipitates were formed by incubation at 4 °C for 15 min and collected on Millipore filter plates (MAFC NOB 10) by filtration. Optiphase Supermix (Wallac) was added (50 μl), and the plates were counted using a Wallac 1450 Microbeta plate counter. Raw cpms were converted and expressed as nmol of phosphate/min/mg of protein and analyzed using the Grafit software package (19Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit, Version 3.0. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar). Twelve ng of either KDRcyt or KDRcytY1054F/Y1059F were incubated in reaction buffer with either increasing concentrations of ATP or 1 mm ATP in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and boiled for 5 min. Reaction products were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by a Western blot probed with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 (Transduction Laboratories), visualized using the ECL detection kit, and quantified by scanning densitometry (Molecular Dynamics). KDRcyt (150 nm) was incubated with 0–4 mm ATP or with just 1 mm ATP in kinase buffer for 10 min at 37 °C. Activation was stopped by diluting 10-fold with enzyme dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) and cooling quickly on ice. Activated KDRcyt (1.5 nm) was incubated with 10 μm/5 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP and 0.3 mg/ml pEY in kinase buffer for 5 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped and processed as described above. The mutant enzymes were activated by incubating 150–400 nm enzyme with 1 mm ATP, and activity was tested as described for the wild-type enzyme. Kinetic constants were determined by arranging a two-dimensional array across a 96-well microtiter plate: increasing ATP on the x axis and increasing pEY in the y direction. Reactions were done as described above. Kinetic analysis was done using the following equations (20Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons,Inc., New York1975: 273-329Google Scholar).v=Vmax[A][B]/(KiAKB+KB[A]+KA[B]+[A][B])Equation 1 v=[S]Vmax/([S]+Km(1+[I]/Ki))Equation 2 v=Vmax([S]/Km)/((1+[S]/Km)+([I]/KEI)+([S][I]/(KmKEI)))Equation 3 These equations describe the ternary complex, competitive inhibition, and noncompetitive inhibition, respectively, wherev is the measured velocity; K A andK B are the Michaelis constants for substrates A and B, respectively; and K iA andK iB are dissociations constants for substrates A and B from EA and EB, respectively. Kinetic constants were determined from a nonlinear least squares best fit of the data (19Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit, Version 3.0. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar). Unactivated (nonphosphorylated) KDRcyt (10 nm) was incubated with 25 μm/5 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP, 0.3 mg/ml pEY, and inhibitors diluted in Me2SO (final Me2SO concentration of 5%) in kinase buffer for 15 min at 22 °C. KDRcyt enzyme, activated as described above, was diluted to a final concentration of 1.5 nm in kinase buffer containing 25 μm/10 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP and 0.3 mg/ml pEY and then incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of inhibitor for 15 min at 22 °C and processed as described above. Homology models of the unactivated (nonphosphorylated) and the activated (phosphorylated) forms of the KDR kinase were based on the published coordinates of the FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) (21Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and insulin receptor (22Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) kinases, respectively. The sequences of the FGFR1, insulin receptor kinase (IRK) and KDR were aligned by hand based on conserved structural elements, and the three-dimensional models were generated using the program LOOK (23Molecular Applications Group Look, Version 2.0. Molecular Applications Group, Palo Alto, CA1995Google Scholar). Docking of the ligands into these models was done manually, based on the crystallographically established binding of staurosporine in PKA (24Prade L. Engh R.A. Girod A. Kinzel V. Huber R. Bossemeyer D. Structure. 1997; 5: 1627-1637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and SU4984 in FGFR1 (25Mohammadi M. McMahon G. Sun L. Tang C. Hirth P. Yeh B.K. Hubbard S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1997; 276: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). The enzyme-ligand complex was then minimized using the CHARMM force field as implemented in Quanta97 (26Molecular Simulations Inc Quanta97. Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA1997Google Scholar). The ligand and the side chains of any residue within 5.0 Å were allowed to move, and the remainder of the enzyme was fixed. The models were considered to be minimized when the rms force was <0.01 kcal/mol/Å. The amino acid sequences deduced from three independent clones of human KDR from a human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA library each contain a valine residue at position 848 rather than the glutamic acid residue listed in the published sequence (Ref.6Terman B.I. Dougher-Vermazen M. Carrion M.E. Dimitrov D. Armellino D.C. Gospodarowicz D. Bohlen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar; GenBankTM accession number L04947). This residue is located in the N-terminal portion of the kinase domain just C-terminal to the glycine-rich loop. Molecular modeling of the KDR kinase sequence into the known crystal structure of the homologous FGFR1 tyrosine kinase (21Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) positions the side chain of amino acid 848 in the ATP binding site in proximity of the adenine ring of ATP (data not shown). Valine is the most prevalent amino acid found at this position in both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases (27Hardie G. Hanks S. The Protein Kinase Facts Book. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995: 7-16Google Scholar), and it could stabilize the binding of ATP through hydrophobic interactions with the adenine ring. Modeling of the glutamic acid residue in this position generates a structure in which the negatively charged carboxyl group could interfere with ATP binding and suggests that the kinase might be less active. Although not obvious from the modeled structure because this carboxyl group could become protonated, purified KDRcyt- Glu848 is unable to autophosphorylate in the presence of 1 mm ATP (Fig. 1). The mutant protein also cannot catalyze phosphorylation of an exogenous peptide substrate but can itself be phosphorylated by a truncated version of the wild-type kinase (data not shown). In contrast, KDRcytVal848 isolated in a >99% tyrosine-dephosphorylated form is a functional kinase (Fig. 1), as demonstrated by autophosphorylation in the presence of 1 mmATP/10 mm MgCl2 and the ability to phosphorylate pEY. All subsequent characterization was carried out using the active cytoplasmic region of the KDR kinase containing Val848, denoted KDRcyt. The ability of KDRcyt to autophosphorylate and the effect of phosphorylation on catalytic activation of the kinase enyzmatic activity were analyzed. KDRcyt was incubated with 10 mm MgCl2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of ATP. Fig. 2 shows the quantitative densitometric scan of an anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot (Fig. 2, inset) measuring the ATP-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the recombinant KDRcyt enzyme. A plot of phosphorylation versusATP concentration (Fig. 2) yields an apparentK mATP of 0.29 mm for autophosphorylation. To determine the effect of autophosphorylation on the activation of the kinase catalytic activity, KDRcyt was first preincubated with increasing concentrations of ATP in the presence of MgCl2, the reaction mixture was diluted, and ATP was adjusted to a final concentration of 10 μm. Phosphate incorporation into the exogenous polypeptide substrate pEY was measured. Without prior incubation with ATP, the level of KDRcyt autophosphorylation at 10 μm ATP was very low (Fig. 2), and any additional activation during the second reaction was minimal. The concentration of ATP required for half-maximal activation of the catalytic activity of the kinase was 0.52 mm, as shown in Fig.3. To further study the mechanism of activation of the KDR kinase, one or both of the tyrosines 1054 and 1059, known autophosphorylation sites in the activation loop (17Dougher-Vermazen M. Hulmes J.D. Bohlen P. Terman B.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 728-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), were changed by site-directed mutagenesis to phenylalanine residues. Activation of the purified mutant and wild-type enzymes was carried out with 1 mm ATP, and the resulting activities were measured using the exogenous pEY substrate. As shown in Fig. 4, the basal activities of these wild-type and mutant kinases were essentially equivalent. In contrast, prephosphorylated wild-type enzyme exhibited an 18-fold increase in tyrosine kinase activity, whereas the KDRcytY1054F and KDRcytY1059F single mutants were each activated only 6-fold. The double mutant KDRcytY1054F/Y1059F showed less than a 2-fold increase in activity demonstrating the importance of both of these tyrosine residues for the activation of KDR tyrosine kinase activity. The increased activities resulting from preinculation in 1 mm ATP were not the result of instability of the enzyme in the absence of ATP at 37 °C because the activity of KDRcyt without the incubation step was equivalent to the activity of the enzyme incubated at 37 °C without ATP (data not shown). Despite substitution of the two activation loop tyrosines by phenylalanine residues, the double mutant still autophosphorylated (Fig. 5), consistent with the presence of additional previously identified KDR phosphotyrosine residues (17Dougher-Vermazen M. Hulmes J.D. Bohlen P. Terman B.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 728-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Figure 5Autophosphorylation of the wild-type and Y1054F/Y1059F double mutant of KDRcyt. Wild-type and mutant enzymes were incubated either with (+) or without (−) 1 mm ATP for 10 min at 37 °C, and reactions were stopped by the addition of sample buffer and boiled. The reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE, analyzed on a Western blot probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and visualized by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The reaction mechanism of the activated kinase was investigated by a two substrate kinetic analysis varying the concentrations of both ATP and pEY. Double reciprocal plots of 1/v versus 1/[ATP] and 1/[pEY], displayed in Fig. 6, show an intersecting line pattern indicative of a sequential mechanism in which a ternary complex composed of the enzyme and both substrates forms before any products are released (20Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons,Inc., New York1975: 273-329Google Scholar). These data rule out a ping-pong mechanism, indicated by a parallel line pattern in this graphical analysis, in which one of the substrates binds, is converted to a product by modification of the enzyme or a co-enzyme, and is released prior to binding the second substrate. The kinetic constants, determined by nonlinear curve fitting (19Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit, Version 3.0. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar), are displayed in Table I. The Michaelis constants K mATP andK mpEY are similar to the dissociation constants K iATP(K iA) andK ipEY(K iB) calculated from Equation 1, indicating that each substrate binds independently. This is consistent with a rapid equilibrium model in which association and dissociation of each substrate is rapid compared with catalysis and binding is random. Patterns of product inhibition can be used to distinguish reaction mechanisms (20Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons,Inc., New York1975: 273-329Google Scholar). The results of inhibitor studies using the product ADP and the dead-end substrate AMP-PCP are plotted in Fig.7. Both inhibitors show a competitive pattern versus ATP and are noncompetitive with the peptide substrate, further supporting a random substrate addition mechanism. A product inhibitor of the peptide substrate, which is not available, would be required to rule out an ordered mechanism in which ATP binds first (20Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons,Inc., New York1975: 273-329Google Scholar). The reaction mechanism of the wild-type unactivated form of the kinase could not be determined because autophosphorylation and consequently enzyme activation would occur during the reaction at high ATP concentrations, as shown in Fig. 2.Table IKinetic constants of activated KDRcyt and KDRcytY1054F/Y1059FEnzymeK mATPK mpEYk catK iATPK ipEYμmμg/mlmin−1μmμmActivated130660162100500Y1054F/Y1059F9001800186370720Kinetic constants were calculated from the equation for ternary complex formation (Equation 1). Open table in a new tab Kinetic constants were calculated from the equation for ternary complex formation (Equation 1). A two substrate analysis was done for the KDRcytY1054F/Y1059F double mutant in an effort to model the unactivated kinase (Fig. 6). The K mATPand K mpEY values andK iATP andK ipEY were marginally different (TableI), consistent with some synergy between substrates (28Knight W.B. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5728-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Similar to the wild-type enzyme, ADP and AMP-PCP are both competitive with respect to ATP and are noncompetitive with the peptide substrate (data not shown). As shown in Table I, the K m values for ATP and pEY in the double mutant are increased by 6.9- and 2.7-fold, respectively, compared with the wild-type enzyme, with essentially no change in the turnover numbers. The ability of kinase antagonists to inhibit selectively either the activated or unactivated form of the enzyme was tested. Two commercially available inhibitors, staurosporine and the indolinone 3-(4-dimethylamino-benzylidene)-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-one (Fig.8), were found to bind competitively with ATP and noncompetitively with the polypeptide substrate (data not shown). KDRcyt either was used without a prior activation step or was activated with 1 mm ATP as described"

The initiation and subsequent elongation of the mannan backbone is performed by two complexes of proteins in the cis Golgi.

Deletion of either Mnn10p, or its homologue Mnn11p, results in defects in mannan synthesisin vivo, and analysis of the enzymatic activity of the complexes isolated from mutant strains suggests that Mnn10p and Mnn11p are responsible for the majority of the α-1,6-polymerizing activity of the complex.

The glycoproteins of the cell wall of the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae are modified with bothN-linked and O-linked glycans. TheO-linked structures are chains of 4–5 mannoses attached to serines and threonines, whereas the N-linked glycans comprise the conventional core structure to which can be attached a long outer chain structure of up to 200 mannose residues (1Herscovics A. Orlean P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 2Orlean P. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 229-362Google Scholar). This “mannan” modification is so extensive that the mannoproteins contribute up to 40% of the dry weight of the yeast cell wall (3Klis F.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 851-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Mannans provide an external layer to the wall, which is believed both to contribute to its structural integrity and serve to exclude hydrolytic enzymes. Analysis of the structure of the S. cerevisiae mannan shows that it consists of a long α-1,6-linked backbone of about 50 residues to which short branches of 3–4 residues in length are attached (1Herscovics A. Orlean P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 4Ballou L. Hernandez L.M. Alvarado E. Ballou C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The first 2 mannoses of these branches are α-1,2-linked, and the final mannose is α-1,3-linked with some branches being additionally modified by the addition of a phosphomannose residue. A similar type of mannan structure comprising a long backbone with side branches is a feature of the cell wall of all other yeast and fungi, although the precise linkages, and even sugar residues, vary extensively even between quite closely related species (6Shibata N. Ikuta K. Imai T. Satoh Y. Satoh R. Suzuki A. Kojima C. Kobayashi H. Hisamichi K. Suzuki S. J. Biol.

This diversity may reflect a selective pressure to evade hydrolytic enzymes or immune responses that recognize a particular combination of residues and linkages. The synthesis of the mannan structure in S. cerevisiae has been extensively investigated by both genetic and biochemical means. The mannan outer chains are only attached to the N-linked glycans of proteins destined for inclusion in the cell wall or residence in the periplasmic space. The synthesis begins in the Golgi apparatus where the first α-1,6-linked mannose residue of the mannan backbone is attached to the core by the Och1p mannosyltransferase (11Nakayama K. Nagasu T. Shimma Y. Kuromitsu J. Jigami Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2511-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This mannose is attached to all N-linked glycans, but then only on a subset is it extended further to form the mannan backbone. On the remaining glycans a single α-1,2-linked residue is added and then an α-1,3-linked residue is added to this, and to other points on the core structure (4Ballou L. Hernandez L.M. Alvarado E. Ballou C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3368-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The extension of the mannan backbone is performed by two recently identified complexes of proteins in the cisGolgi. The first contains the proteins Mnn9p and Van1p, and the second has been shown also to include Mnn9p as well as the proteins Anp1p, Hoc1p, and Mnn11p (12Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These two complexes possess α-1,6-transferase activity in vitro, and mutations in their components can result in either complete loss of the mannan backbone (mnn9and van1) or mannan chains with a short backbone of 10–15 residues (anp1), suggesting that the two complexes act sequentially to initiate and then extend the backbone. All of these proteins are type II membrane proteins, with a single transmembrane domain, a topology typical of Golgi glycosyltransferases (13Field M.C. Wainwright L.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 14Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The branches on the mannan backbone are initiated and then extended by two α-1,2-mannosyltransferases encoded by MNN2 andMNN5 (15Rayner J.C. Munro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26836-26843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These two membrane proteins are not components of the Van1p- or Anp1p-containing complexes, which make the backbone. Finally the α-1,3-linked mannose and the mannose phosphate are added by Mnn1p and Mnn6p, respectively (16Ballou C.E. Kern K.A. Raschke W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4667-4673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wiggins C.A.R. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18117-18124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Studies on mannan synthesis in S. cerevisiae are facilitated by mannan not being essential for viability. Survival without mannan is, however, dependent on cells being able to sense the cell wall defect, presumably to allow up-regulation of other cell wall components especially chitin (19Dallies N. Francois J. Paquet V. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus mutations that result in defective mannans show synthetic lethality with components of the protein kinase C pathway, which regulates the expression of cell wall components (15Rayner J.C. Munro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26836-26843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar,20Neiman A.M. Mhaiskar V. Manus V. Galibert F. Dean N.

Cell wall integrity is likely to be particularly critical during budding, and again survival without mannan seems also to depend both on the actin cytoskeleton being well organized and on a functional mitotic check point, which allows bud formation to be slowed (22Mondesert G. Reed S.I. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Mondesert G. Clarke D.J. Reed S.I.

In this study, we investigate a Golgi membrane protein of previously unknown function that was initially identified as corresponding to a bud emergence delay mutation bed1 (22Mondesert G. Reed S.I. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown to correspond also to a previously identified mannan synthesis mutant mnn10 (25Ballou L. Cohen R.E. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5986-5991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Dean N. Poster J.B. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because Mnn10p is distantly related to Mnn11p, one of the components of the Anp1p-containing complex, we investigated its relationship to this complex. We show here that it is a further component of the complex that seems to comprise five proteins. This large structure does not appear to contain further proteins. Investigation of the activity of the complex in wild type and mutant strains indicates that the Mnn10p and Mnn11p proteins are responsible for the majority of the α-1,6-polymerizing activity of the complex. S. cerevisiae strain SEY6210 (Matα ura3–52 his3Δ200 leu2–3,112 trp-Δ901 lys2–801 suc2-Δ9) and derivatives were used throughout (27Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell.

For hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tagging, polymerase chain reaction products were amplified from plasmid p3xHA-HIS5 that encodes a linker of amino acid sequence GAGAGA, followed by three copies of the sequence YPYDVPDYA, with the first and third repeats followed by a G residue. For Myc-tagging of open reading frames, a similar plasmid with nine copies of the Myc tag was used 2I. Adams and J. V.

Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Proteins separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were electrophoresed onto nitrocellulose and probed with antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline, 2% dried milk, 0.5% Tween 20. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitations were performed with monoclonals against the Myc epitope (9E10), the HA epitope (12CA5), or ribosomal protein Tcm1p (kindly provided by Jon Warner) or with rabbit antisera against both tags (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Anp1p (12Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total protein samples were prepared by resuspending log-phase yeast at oneA 600 unit per 20 μl of SDS buffer, bead beating for 5 min at 4 °C (425–600-μm glass beads, Sigma), and denaturing at 65 °C for 5 min. Immunoprecipitates were prepared from unlabeled cells as described previously (15Rayner J.C. Munro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26836-26843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Precipitation of protein A fusions was performed essentially as described previously but adapted for metabolically labeled cells. Thus four A 600units of log-phase cells were labeled with 200 μCi of Tran35S-label (1,170 Ci/mmol, ICN) in 0.5 ml for 30 min at 30 °C, spheroplasted as for the unlabeled cells, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of T/D/I buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% digitonin, 2 mm EDTA supplemented by protease inhibitors). After centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 10 min to remove cell debris, the supernatant was added to 15 μl of IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), rocked gently overnight, and the beads washed five times for 1 h in 0.4 ml T/D/I, before cleavage overnight in 20 μl of T/D/I with 5 units of TEV protease (Life Technologies, Inc.), all steps after spheroplasting being at 4 °C. The supernatant from the beads was removed, divided in two and treated with, or without, 500 units of endoglycosidase H (Endo H) according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Protein was precipitated by methanol/chloroform extraction, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gel was treated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and fluorographed. Protein complexes prepared by IgG-Sepharose precipitation and TEV protease cleavage from 1,000A 600 units of cells, or 14,000 ×g supernatants from spheroplasts lysed in T/D/I buffer, were fractionated on a 34 × 1.5-cm column of Sephacryl S400 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was run in 10 mmtriethanolamine, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.4% digitonin at 15 ml/h and 1 ml of fractions were collected. 100 μl of fractions were precipitated by methanol/chloroform extraction with soybean trypsin inhibitor as a carrier, resuspended in SDS buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting. For standards, thyroglobulin, catalase, and ferritin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were run on the same column under identical conditions and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. Protein A fusions or Anp1p-containing complexes were isolated and used on the beads for mannosyltransferase reactions as described previously (12Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 15Rayner J.C. Munro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26836-26843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The reaction products were fractionated by gel filtration on a 14 × 1.0-cm Sephadex G10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) run in deionized water. The radioactive peak fractions were pooled, concentrated by lyophilizing, treated with mannosidases, and the products reacted with 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (ANTS) for separation by electrophoresis as described previously (12Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 30Jackson P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 250-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) with the reaction products from 50 to 100 A 600 units of cells loaded per lane. The resulting gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for 3 days (or 2 weeks for theΔmnn11 and Δmnn10 experiments) and analyzed with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. To determine whether Mnn10p was a component of one of the two Mnn9p-containing complexes, the same co-immunoprecipitation approach was followed that was originally used to reveal the interactions between Mnn9p and the other members of the complexes (12Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Thus a triple HA-epitope tag was inserted at the end of theMNN10 open reading frame by homologous recombination. Protein blotting revealed that the tagged protein migrated as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa, reasonably close to that predicted from the sequence of the protein and the epitope tag (49 kDa, Fig. 1 A). An anti-HA monoclonal antibody was used to precipitate the protein from yeast solubilized with the mild detergent digitonin. The immunoprecipitates were then blotted with antibodies to Anp1p and Van1p, and Fig.1 B shows that Mnn10p is associated with Anp1p and not with Van1p. Moreover, blotting of the supernatant following precipitation revealed that the Anp1p was quantitatively precipitated by the tagged Mnn10p, indicating that all of the Anp1p is associated with complexes that contain Mnn10p (Fig. 1 B). Our previous analysis of the Mnn9p-containing complexes had shown that Anp1p is associated not only with Mnn9p but also with two other membrane proteins, Hoc1p and Mnn11p. As with Mnn10p, these proteins were not found associated with the Van1p-Mnn9p complex. This raises the question of how these five proteins are organized. In each case it is known that the protein associates with Anp1p. One possibility is that all five proteins are in a single complex. Alternatively there could be distinct complexes containing Mnn9p-Anp1p and one or two of the other components. We addressed this issue in two ways. First, we constructed strains with different epitope tags at the C terminus of pairs of the proteins. Immunoprecipitates were then performed using one anti-tag antibody, and the precipitated proteins probed on a blot for the second tagged protein. A representative experiment is shown in Fig.2 A for strains expressing Mnn10p and Mnn11p, tagged with Myc and HA in both combinations. In both cases, not only could the HA-tagged member of the pair be precipitated with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody as expected, but it could also be precipitated with the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody. This indicates that Mnn10p and Mnn11p are present in the same complex. Likewise theHOC1 open reading frame was tagged with the Myc epitope in strains in which either Mnn10p or Mnn11p were tagged with HA. In both cases the Myc-tagged Hoc1p could be precipitated with antibodies to the Myc or the HA tags, and also with a rabbit polyclonal against Anp1p. Blotting of the digitonin lysate of the Hoc1p-Myc-expressing cells revealed two bands, of which only the upper is present in blots of cellular proteins solubilized directly in SDS-containing sample buffer (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). Because the tag is at the C terminus, this suggests that proteases in the digitonin lysate remove about 5 kDa from the NH2 terminus of the protein. Such clipping in the region after the amino-terminal transmembrane domain has been seen for many Golgi enzymes in both yeast and mammals and is proposed to reflect this part of the enzymes being a flexible stalk region (31Häusler A. Robbins W. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this clipped form does not co-precipitate with either Mnn10p, Mnn11p or Anp1p, which may reflect removal by the protease of a region required for association in the complex (Fig. 2 B). The only exception to this co-precipitation of the various Anp1p-associated proteins was observed when tagged Hoc1p was precipitated from a strain also expressing tagged Mnn10p. Although precipitation of HA-tagged Mnn10p with anti-HA resulted in the co-precipitation of Myc-tagged Hoc1p, only low levels of Mnn10p-HA were precipitated when the precipitation was performed the other way round with anti-Myc (Fig. 2 B). One possibility is that the C-terminal tag on Hoc1p lies close to the interface between Hoc1p and Mnn10p, and that binding of the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody disrupts the interaction. To investigate further the composition of the Anp1p-containing complex and examine the possibility that it contains yet further components, a second approach was used to address the composition of the complex. For this a protein A tag was attached to the C terminus of each of the components of the complex in separate strains. The spacer between the protein and the tag contained a cleavage site for the sequence-specific protease from TEV. This allows the tagged proteins to be captured on IgG-Sepharose, and then proteolytically eluted under native conditions with minimal background (15Rayner J.C. Munro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26836-26843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The isolation was initially performed with strains expressing either protein A-tagged Anp1p or tagged Van1p, or no tagged protein. Fig. 3 A shows that the two tagged proteins precipitate a distinct pattern of bands, consistent with their being in two distinct complexes that share only the component Mnn9p. This analysis was then extended to the other components of the Anp1p-containing complex, and Fig. 3 Bshows the results of such a precipitation and elution performed on35S-labeled strains in which the different components of the complex had been tagged. A thirteen residue spacer including the TEV cleavage site is left on the protein following protease treatment, and this results in a small reduction of mobility compared with the nontagged version. In most cases all the other proteins can be identified as co-precipitating with a particular component. Analysis of the gels is complicated by the fact that Mnn10p and Hoc1p apparently co-migrate (consistent with their predicted molecular weights differing by only 0.4 kDa). However, when Mnn10p is shifted following the addition of the tag, a band the size of Hoc1p remains. Interestingly in the converse case, when the tag is attached to Hoc1p, only a very faint band in the position of Mnn10p is observed. This is consistent with the immunoprecipitation results described above, and with the notion that the C terminus of Hoc1p may be close to the interface with Mnn10p. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that there are two different Mnn9p-containing complexes in the yeast cis Golgi. The first comprises Van1p and Mnn9p, and the second Anp1p, Mnn9p, Hoc1p, Mnn10p, and Mnn11p. Careful examination of the autoradiograms did not reveal any further unidentified bands in the Anp1p complex suggesting that these five proteins are the major constituents of the complex. However it remains possible that there are further proteins present at stoichiometry too low for detection by this approach. We have previously shown that both these complexes have α-1,6-mannosyltransferase activity in vitro, attaching multiple residues to make polymeric structures. To simplify further discussion, we propose to refer to these two complexes as mannan polymerases (M-Pol) I and II, respectively. The above analysis indicates that M-Pol II contains three more components than M-Pol I. As such it would be expected to be a larger structure, and this prediction was tested using gel filtration. The protease elution method described above allows the complexes to be released from the beads in an assembled state, and such released complexes were applied to a gel filtration column. Fig.4 A shows that the two complexes do indeed elute from such a column with very different profiles. The Van1p complex (M-Pol I) elutes with a predicted size of about 280 kDa, whereas the Anp1p complex (M-Pol II) is apparently much larger with a size in excess of 1,000 kDa. The large size of M-Pol II is unlikely to be a result of the precipitation and cleavage protocol used to prepare it. When a whole cell lysate was applied to the same column, Anp1p elutes in a similar position (Fig.4 B) and an epitope-tagged version of Mnn9p elutes in two peaks corresponding to the positions of the isolated M-Pol I and M-Pol II. The individual predicted molecular masses of Van1p and Mnn9p total 107 kDa (plus the N-linked glycan on Van1p, which adds about 5 kDa to its apparent molecular weight on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel), whereas those of the components of M-Pol II total 245 kDa. To maintain the solubility of these membrane proteins the column was run in the presence of digitonin, which forms micelles of 70 kDa in 0.1m NaCl (33Smith E.L. Pickels E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1940; 26: 23658-23663Crossref Google Scholar). Although this sort of gel filtration analysis cannot be expected to give very accurate sizes, it seems likely that at least some of the proteins are present in the M-pol complexes at a greater than monomeric stoichiometry. It has been previously shown that M-Pol I and M-Pol II have both α-1,6- and α-1,2-mannosyltransferase activity in vitro, raising the question of what contribution the individual components of the complex make to this activity (12Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we initially examined the effect of deleting individual subunits on mannan synthesis in vivo. It is known that mutations in Mnn10p result in reduction in the length of mannan chains, but the effect of loss of Mnn11p has not previously been reported. The protein invertase is modified with mannan chains on 8–10 of its N-linked glycans, and Fig.5 A shows that the gel mobility of invertase is increased in yeast in which either Anp1p, Mnn10p or Mnn11p is absent. Consistent with this the Δmnn11 strain also shows increased sensitivity to hygromycin, a property of other mannan defective mutants including anp1 and mnn10(data not shown). This demonstrates that Mnn11p is required for the synthesis of full-length mannan chains in vivo, and justifies our inclusion of the gene in the MNN class as defined by Ballou and co-workers (34Raschke W.C. Kern K.A. Antalis C. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4660-4666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ballou C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 440-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It has been observed previously that removal of the Mnn9p component of M-Pol II results in the destabilization of Anp1p (12Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 36Hashimoto H. Yoda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 682-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This presumably reflects a requirement for association between the two proteins for correct folding. In contrast, deletion of the other members of the complex does not result in the complete loss of Anp1p (Fig. 5 B). However, the levels are reduced in some cases, and normalization to a control ribosomal protein (Tcm1p) shows that in the Δmnn10 and Δmnn11 strains the level of Anp1p is reduced by 85 and 75%, respectively, whereas deletion ofHOC1 has no effect. This suggests that Mnn10p and Mnn11p contribute to the folding or stability of M-Pol II. Because the level of Anp1p is reduced in the Δmnn10 and Δmnn11strains, it is possible that the defect in mannan synthesis seen is not because the proteins are directly involved in mannan synthesis, but rather because they are required for the stability or integrity of other proteins in the complex, which are actually responsible for mannan synthesis. To address the catalytic role of Mnn10p and Mnn11p, the Anp1p-protein A fusion described above was used to isolate M-Pol II for examination of its enzymatic activity in vitro. We initially examined the activity of the M-Pol II from wild type cells, and compared it with that of M-Pol I. Thus Anp1p and Van1p protein-A fusions were precipitated from cells and incubated on the beads with labeled GDP mannose and α-1,6-mannobiose as an acceptor. The products of the transferase reactions were divided into aliquots and digested with combinations of mannosidases. Finally, the charged fluorophore ANTS was attached to the reducing ends of the products to allow analysis by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (30Jackson P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 250-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The gels were autoradiographed and examined by fluorescence to examine the reaction products. Fig. 6 shows that both M-Pol I and M-Pol II produced a ladder of mannosylated products as previously observed (12Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Mannosidase digestion revealed that the product of M-Pol II is almost completely digested to monomeric mannose by α-1,6-mannosidase, suggesting that this is the major linkage made by the complex.

By using a combination of introduced cysteine mutants and sulfhydryl-specific chemistry, we have mapped the topology of the human AE1 membrane domain. Twenty-seven single cysteines were introduced throughout the Leu708-Val911 region of human AE1, and these mutants were expressed by transient transfection of human embryonic kidney cells. On the basis of cysteine accessibility to membrane-permeant biotin maleimide and to membrane-impermeant lucifer yellow iodoacetamide, we have proposed a model for the topology of AE1 membrane domain. In this model, AE1 is composed of 13 typical transmembrane segments, and the Asp807-His834region is membrane-embedded but does not have the usual α-helical conformation. To identify amino acids that are important for anion transport, we analyzed the anion exchange activity for all introduced cysteine mutants, using a whole cell fluorescence assay. We found that mutants G714C, S725C, and S731C have very low transport activity, implying that this region has a structurally and/or catalytically important role. We measured the residual anion transport activity after mutant treatment with the membrane-impermeant, cysteine-directed compound, sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate) (MTSES). Only two mutants, S852C and A858C, were inhibited by MTSES, indicating that these residues may be located in a pore-lining region."

Nevertheless, several lines of evidence suggest that TβR-V is important in mediating TGF-β-induced growth inhibitory responses. These include the following: 1) cells lacking TβR-V but expressing TβR-I, TβR-II, and TβR-III do not exhibit the growth inhibitory response to stimulation by exogenous TGF-β, although exogenous TGF-β is able to induce transcriptional activation of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and fibronectin in these cells (24Liu Q.

This implies that the loss of TβR-V, which mediates negative growth regulation, may contribute to malignancy of certain carcinoma cells (19Leal S.M. Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol.

The structural and functional analyses of these peptide antagonists revealed that aW/R XX D motif is essential for the antagonist activity. Multiple conjugation of the peptide antagonists to carrier proteins conferred TGF-β agonist activity in growth inhibition but not in transcriptional activation (25Huang S.S. Liu Q. Johnson F.E. Konish Y. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27155-27159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results prompted us to identify structurally unrelated TGF-β agonists that possess theW/R XX D motif. IGFBP-3 was the first TGF-β agonist identified (19Leal S.M. Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20572-20576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 possesses a putative TGF-β active site motif (WCVD) near its C terminus (1Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shimasaki S. Ling N. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1992; 3: 243-266Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 3Bach L.A. Rechler M.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1992; 8: 229-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Because IGFBP-3 is structurally homologous to other high affinity IGFBPs and because four of six high affinity IGFBPs (IGFBP-3 to -6) possess the putative TGF-β active site motif (WCVD) near their C termini (1Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shimasaki S. Ling N. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1992; 3: 243-266Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 3Bach L.A. Rechler M.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1992; 8: 229-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that at least some of these IGFBPs might bind to TβR-V, which may mediate the IGF-independent activities of these IGFBPs. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the interactions of IGFBP-1 to -6 with TβR-V in mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu cells). In this communication, we show that IGFBP-3, -4, and -5 but not IGFBP-1, -2, or -6 bind to TβR-V as demonstrated by125I-labeled ligand affinity labeling of TβR-V in Mv1Lu cells. IGFBP-4 and -5 bind to TβR-V with lower affinities than that of IGFBP-3. The cell surface-associated dimeric form of IGFBP-3 exhibits a preference for binding to TβR-V. We also demonstrate that IGFBP-3-induced growth inhibition mediated by TβR-V does not involve the stimulated phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3.DISCUSSIONHigh affinity IGFBPs are important modulators of IGF actions (1Jones J.I.

We have recently identified the IGFBP-3 receptor as TβR-V, which mediates the IGF-independent growth inhibitory response induced by IGFBP-3 (19Leal S.M. Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol.

In this communication, we show that IGFBP-4 and -5 are also specific ligands for TβR-V, although their affinities for TβR-V are weaker than that of IGFBP-3. The TβR-V is likely the same receptor for IGFBP-5, which has been recently identified in mouse osteoblasts (34Andress D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E744-E750PubMed Google Scholar). The TβR-V and putative IGFBP-5 receptor in osteoblasts share similar properties including the following: 1) they have almost identical molecular weights (∼400,000) (19Leal S.M. Liu Q. Huang S.S.

Liu, S. S. Huang, and J. S. Huang, unpublished results. (23Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9221-9226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S.

Huang, unpublished results.Among high affinity IGFBPs, four (IGFBP-3 to -6), which possess the putative TGF-β active site motif WCVD near their C termini, were initially predicted to bind to TβR-V. However, although IGFBP-3, -4, and -5 were found to interact with TβR-V in Mv1Lu cells, IGFBP-6 did not. The inability of IGFBP-6 to interact with TβR-V may be because of its unique structure. IGFBP-6 contains 10 of 12 N-terminal cysteine residues conserved in other high affinity IGFBPs and possesses additional O-linked carbohydrate moieties in the central domain and possibly near the C-terminal end (1Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shimasaki S. Ling N. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1992; 3: 243-266Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 3Bach L.A.

These distinct structural features may yield a conformation that does not allow the WCVD motif in IGFBP-6 to interact with TβR-V. It is also possible that the WCVD motif is not the only determinant required for the interactions of IGFBPs with TβR-V. The WCVD motif is contained within the thyroglobulin type-1 repeat of IGFBP-3 (37Fowlkes J.L. Thrailkill K.M. George-Nascimento C. Rosenberg C.K. Serra D.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2280-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thyroglobulin, which contains multiple WCVD motifs per monomer, has recently been shown to exhibit an authentic TGF-β antagonist/agonist activity after activation by acidic pH/denaturing agent treatments and chemical modifications (38Huang S.S. Cerullo M. Huang F.W. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26036-26041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This implies that certain structural configurations of the WCVD motif are required for optimal interaction with TβR-V.Several polypeptide growth factors are known to stimulate the cytoplasmic kinase activities of their respective receptors by inducing receptor dimerization through their dimeric structures (39Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1998; 94: 277-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 40Raines E.W. Bowen-Pope F.D. Ross R. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The covalent dimeric structure is also known to be required for TGF-β activities (42Hinch A.P. Archer S.J. Quian S.W. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Weatherbee J.A. Tsang M.L.-S. Lucas R. Zhang B.-L. Wenker J. Torchia D.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8517-8534Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Most 125I-labeled IGFBPs form covalently linked dimers at the cell surface. Approximately 20% of cell surface-associated 125I-IGFBP-3 is estimated to be in the form of covalently linked dimers, whereas less than 2% exists as the covalently linked dimer in binding medium. This suggests that the cell surface association enhances the dimer formation of IGFBP-3. Assuming that the efficiency of the spontaneous covalent linking of125I-IGFBP-3 is ∼20%, it is estimated that almost 100% of the cell surface-associated 125I-IGFBP-3 are dimers. The cell-surface dimeric form of IGFBP-3 appears to be the active form of IGFBP-3 for binding to TβR-V.The major cell-surface binding sites for IGFBP-3 dimers appear to be membrane proteins other than TβR-V because cells lacking TβR-V (human colorectal carcinoma cells) express these binding sites (19Leal S.M. Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20572-20576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the binding of 125I-IGFBP-3 and125I-IGFBP-5 dimers to their major cell-surface binding sites is blocked by β1-(41–65), a specific TGF-β peptide antagonist, whereas the binding of 125I-IGFBP-1 and -4 dimers to their major binding sites is resistant to the blocking by the TGF-β peptide antagonist (Fig. 1). This suggests that the major cell-surface binding sites for IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 dimers are distinct from those for other IGFBPs dimers. This suggestion has been supported by the observation that heparin inhibits the binding of125I-IGFBP-3 and -5 dimers but not125I-IGFBP-1 and -4 dimers to cell-surface binding sites (18Andress D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28289-28296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Leal S.M. Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol.

The functions of these major cell-surface binding sites are unknown. However, one function may involve presentation of IGFBPs to their respective cell-surface receptors. In the case of IGFBP-3, these binding sites may present IGFBP-3 to TβR-V as demonstrated in Fig. 7. This would explain the observation that heparin inhibits the binding of125I-IGFBP-3 to both the major cell-surface binding sites and to the TβR-V (18Andress D.L. J. Biol.

The identification of IGFBP-3 as well as IGFBP-4 and -5 as specific ligands for TβR-V has enabled us to investigate the signaling mediated by TβR-V in cells containing other TGF-β receptors. In this communication, we show that IGFBP-3 does not stimulate the cellular phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, both of which play key roles in the signaling mediated by the TβR-I and TβR-II heterocomplex (31Vivien D.

This result is consistent with the observation that IGFBP-3 induces growth inhibition but not transcriptional activation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in Mv1Lu cells (19Leal S.M. Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20572-20576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The TGF-β-induced expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 is mainly mediated by the TβR-I·TβR-II complex (24Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18891-18895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).

NET is expressed only in neuronal tissues that synthesize and secrete norepinephrine and in most cases is co-expressed with the norepinephrine-synthetic enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH). To understand the molecular mechanisms regulating human NET (hNET) gene expression, we isolated and characterized an hNET genomic clone encompassing approximately 9.5 kilobase pairs of the 5′ upstream promoter region. Here we demonstrate that the hNET gene contains an as-yet-unidentified intron of 476 base pairs within the 5′-untranslated region. Furthermore, both primer extension and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analyses identified multiple transcription start sites from mRNAs expressed only in NET-expressing cell lines. The start sites clustered in two subdomains, each preceded by a TATA-like sequence motif. As expected for mature mRNAs, transcripts from most of these sites each contained an additional G residue at the 5′ position. Together, the data strongly support the authenticity of these sites as the transcriptional start sites of hNET. We assembled hNET-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter constructs containing different lengths of hNET 5′ sequence in the presence or the absence of the first intron. Transient transfection assays indicated that the combination of the 5′ upstream sequence and the first intron supported the highest level of noradrenergic cell-specific transcription. Forced expression of the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor Phox2a did not affect hNET promoter activity in NET-negative cell lines, in marked contrast to its effect on a DBH-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct. Together with our previous studies suggesting a critical role of Phox2a for noradrenergic-specific expression of the DBH gene, these data support a model in which distinct, or partially distinct, molecular mechanisms regulate cell-specific expression of the NET and DBH genes.

The synaptic action of norepinephrine (NE) 1The abbreviations used are: NE, norepinephrine; NET, norepinephrine transporter; DBH, dopamine β-hydroxylase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; 5′-RACE, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends; h, human; m, mouse; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase pair; bp, base pair; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase. is terminated primarily by rapid, NaCl-dependent re-uptake into presynaptic nerve terminals. NE reuptake is mediated by the norepinephrine transporter (NET) located in the plasma membrane of noradrenergic neurons (1Axelrod J. Kopin I.J. Prog. Brain Res. 1969; 31: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The NET is a major target for tricyclic antidepressant drugs and for illicit drugs such as cocaine and amphetamine. These agents block NE transport by the NET, resulting in enhancement of the synaptic activity of NE. Blockade of NET is an important mechanism of therapeutic action of tricyclic antidepressants, and this observation provided support for the catecholamine hypothesis of depression (2Schildkraut J.J. Am. J. Psychiatry. 1965; 122: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (2360) Google Scholar). Recently, Klimeket al. (3Klimek V. Stockmeier C. Overholser J. Meltzer H.Y. Kalka S. Dilley G. Ordway G.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8451-8458Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) reported that the level of NET is significantly reduced in the locus coeruleus from major depressive subjects. These observations suggest that regulation of NET expression could play an important role in human mental illnesses such as major depression and schizophrenia (3Klimek V. Stockmeier C. Overholser J.

Sci. 1993; 14: 43-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In rodent studies, the mouse NET (mNET) locus, Slc6a5, overlapped with a quantitative trait locus (Lore4) for differential ethanol sensitivity in long-sleep and short-sleep mice (5Fritz J.D. Jayanthi L.D. Thoreson M.A. Blakely R.D. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2241-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6Markel P.D. Bennett B. Beeson M. Gordon L. Simpson V.J. Johnson T.E. Mamm.

Together with previous studies indicating ethanol-induced changes of noradrenergic neurotransmission (8Israel Y. Carmichael F.J. Macdonald J.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1973; 215: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 9Lin A.M.Y. Bickford P.C. Palmer M.R. Gerhardt G.A. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 164: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), these findings suggest the additional possibility that regulation of NET expression may contribute to ethanol tolerance and/or addiction. A cDNA encoding human NET (hNET) was isolated by an expression cloning approach (10Pacholczyk T. Blakely R.D. Amara S.G. Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), and subsequently, cDNAs for the bovine and the rat NET genes were cloned on the basis of their sequence homologies (11Lingen B. Bruss M. Bonisch H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12Bruss M. Porzgen P. Bryan-Lluka L.J. Bonisch H. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 52: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). NET belongs to a superfamily of Na+- and Cl−-dependent transporters that includes transporters for dopamine, serotonin, γ-aminobutyric acid, betaine, glycine, proline, and taurine (13Amara S.G. Sonders M.S. Zahniser N.R. Povlock S.L. Daniels G.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev.

Recently, genomic clones of the hNET and mouse placental NET (mNET) have been isolated and characterized. The hNET gene, spanning approximately 45 kb, consists of 14 exons separated by 13 introns and is located on chromosome 16q12.2 (17Porzgen P. Bonisch H. Bruss M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 1145-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The structure of the mNET gene was found to be similar to that of the hNET gene. The mNET gene is composed of 14 exons spanning approximately 36 kb and is located on chromosome 8 which is homologous with 16q12.2 of the human genome (5Fritz J.D. Jayanthi L.D. Thoreson M.A. Blakely R.D. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2241-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the brain, NET is specifically expressed in noradrenergic neurons but is not expressed either in dopaminergic neurons (e.g.substantia nigra) or in adrenergic neurons (e.g. C1 and C2 cell groups), demonstrating that NET is a hallmark protein of noradrenergic cells (18Lorang D. Amara S.G. Simerly R.B. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4903-4914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another protein selectively expressed in noradrenergic (and adrenergic) neurons is dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) which catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to noradrenaline (19Kirshner N. Goodall M. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 207-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Friedman S. Kaufman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4763-4773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, NET and DBH are tightly co-expressed in noradrenergic neurons but differentially in adrenergic neurons, such as those in the C1 and C2 cell groups (18Lorang D. Amara S.G. Simerly R.B. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4903-4914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that NET gene expression is subject to stringent cell type-specific control mechanisms that overlap with, but are not identical to, those regulating DBH gene expression. Levels of NET mRNA in noradrenergic neurons and neurosecretory cells are acutely or chronically regulated in response to various physiological and pharmacological signals including reserpine (21Cubells J.F. Kim K.S. Baker H. Volpe B.T. Chung Y. Houpt T.A. Wessel T.C. Joh T.H. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 502-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), glucocorticoids (22Wakade A.R. Wakade T.D. Poosch M. Bannon M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 494: 67-75Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), leukemia inhibitory factor, and ciliary neurotrophic factor (23Matsuoka I. Kumagai M. Kurihara K. Brain. Res. 1997; 776: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), angiotensin II (24Lu D. Yu K. Paddy M.R. Rowland N.E. Raizada M.K. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), retinoic acid (23Matsuoka I. Kumagai M. Kurihara K. Brain. Res. 1997; 776: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), nerve growth factor (22Wakade A.R. Wakade T.D. Poosch M. Bannon M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 494: 67-75Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and protein kinase C (25Bonisch H. Hammermann R. Bruss M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The foregoing observations suggest that changes in NET gene expression induced by physiological or pharmacological stimuli may alter noradrenergic transmission depending on physiological demand. Despite the clinical and physiological significance of NET gene regulation, little is known about the transcriptional control mechanisms governing its expression. To investigate transcriptional regulation of the human NET gene, we isolated and analyzed genomic clones that encompass the 5′-flanking promoter region of the human NET gene. Here we report that the human NET gene contains an as-yet-unidentified intron of 476 bp in the middle of the 5′-untranslated region. Multiple transcription start sites of the hNET gene were detected by both primer extension analysis and the 5′-RACE technique. On the basis of this information, we constructed several hNET-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter constructs. Transient transfection assays of these reporter constructs in both NET-positive and NET-negative cell lines show that combination of the 5′ upstream sequences and the first intron is critical for high level noradrenergic cell type-specific promoter activity of the hNET gene. However, the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor Phox2a, which is critical for noradrenergic cell type-specific DBH promoter activity (26Kim H.S. Seo H. Brunet J.F. Kim K.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8247-8260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Yang C. Kim H.S. Seo H. Kim C.H. Brunet J.F. Kim K.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1813-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), appears not to regulate the promoter activity of the hNET gene. A 0.5-kb rat NET cDNA fragment corresponding to the base pairs 990–1512 of the coding sequence (21Cubells J.F. Kim K.S. Baker H. Volpe B.T. Chung Y. Houpt T.A. Wessel T.C. Joh T.H. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 502-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was radiolabeled by the random primer method and used as the probe to screen a λEMBL3 human genomic library derived from placenta chromosomal DNA (CLONTECH, Mountain View, CA). Positive clones were isolated and characterized by restriction mapping, using the same rat NET cDNA probe. Then these clones were retested by genomic Southern blot analyses. An oligonucleotide HN3-1 with the nucleotide sequence, 5′-GCATGGATGCGGCTGGCGAGAGGAA-3′, which encompasses the start codon of hNET cDNA (see Ref. 10Pacholczyk T. Blakely R.D. Amara S.G. Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar; Fig. 6), was radiolabeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase using [γ -32P]dATP and was used as the probe. This probe discriminates the genomic clones containing the 3′ side of the gene, thereby facilitating identification of candidate clones that contain the transcription start site and the 5′ upstream region of the hNET gene. The final positive clones (clones 3 and 7), which hybridized with both cDNA and oligonucleotide probes, were isolated and further analyzed by restriction enzyme mapping and sequence determination. Nucleotide sequences were analyzed using the MacDNASIS 3.0 program (Hitachi Software). Human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)C and SK-N-BE(2)M17, rat pheochromocytoma PC12, mouse central noradrenergic neuron-derived CATH.a, and peripheral nervous system-derived PATH.2 cell lines were maintained as described previously (28Kim K.S. Ishiguro H. Tinti C. Wagner J. Joh T.H. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7200-7207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ishiguro H. Kim K.T. Joh T.H. Kim K.S. J. Biol.

Human cholinergic neuroblastoma SK-N-MC (31Ross R.A. Biedler J.L. Spengler B.A. Reis D.J. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1981; 1: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), HeLa, thyroid carcinoma, rat C6 glioma, and mouse mastocytoma cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin in a CO2 incubator. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from each cell line by oligo(dT)-cellulose affinity column chromatography as described (32Kim K.S. Febraio M. Han T.H. Wessel T.C. Park D.H. Joh T.H. Rickwood D. Hames B.D. A Practical Approach: Gene Probes 2. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 151-182Google Scholar) and used for determination of the transcription start site and Northern blot analysis. Primer extension analysis was performed based on the procedure previously described (32Kim K.S. Febraio M. Han T.H. Wessel T.C. Park D.H. Joh T.H. Rickwood D. Hames B.D. A Practical Approach: Gene Probes 2. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 151-182Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, an oligonucleotide primer 8A, 5′-GTGTCCGGCGGCGAGGGGATCCCTGGTGCCTTGCGCCCT-3′, complementary to hNET nucleotides +142 to +180 (Fig. 6), was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Approximately 1 × 105 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide was mixed with 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from SK-N-BE(2)M17, SK-N-BE(2)C, and HeLa cells in a 30-μl reaction containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 150 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Five μg of yeast tRNA served as a negative control. The oligonucleotide was annealed to RNA by heating the mixture at 100 °C for 5 min followed by incubation at 42 °C for 16 h. The annealed primer was extended by incubating with SUPERSCRIPT II RNase H− Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 20-μl reaction containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 40 units of RNasin, and 1 mmdNTPs (1 mm 7-deaza-dGTP, 1 mm dCTP, 1 mm dATP, and 1 mm dTTP) at 42 °C for 1 h. The reaction products were analyzed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The sizes of the extension products were determined by counting the number of nucleotides in a concurrently run sequencing ladder using a control template (the bacteriophage M13mp18) and a control primer with the nucleotide sequence, 5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′. In an additional experiment, another oligonucleotide primer 7A, 5′-TCCGCCGTGTGG CGTTCGGGCGGGGCCGGGGAAGAGCT-3′, complementary to nucleotides from +47 to +84 bp of the hNET gene (Fig. 6) was used as the primer. To identify the 5′-end of the hNET mRNA, 5′-RACE was carried out as described (33Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4336) Google Scholar) with the following modifications (Fig. 4 A). Poly(A)+ RNA from SK-N-BE(2)M17 cells was reverse-transcribed with SUPERSCRIPT II RNase H− Reverse Transcriptase by priming with the oligonucleotide HN3-1. Because the 5′-flanking region of hNET gene is highly GC-rich, 7-deaza-dGTP was used along with the other 3 dNTPs for synthesizing cDNA. A 3′ poly(A) tail was added to the cDNA by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The product was subjected to the first PCR using an adaptor-(dT)17 primer HN5A, 5′-GGAGACTCGAGTCGACATCGA(T)17 -3′, and HN3-1. 40 cycles of PCR were performed with the temperature profile of 95 °C for 40 s, 55 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, which was followed by additional incubation at 72 °C for 9 min. An aliquot of the product was subsequently used for the PCR using an adaptor primer HN5, 5′-GGAGACTCGAGTCGACATCG-3′, and an hNET gene-specific inner primer HN3-2, 5′-TGGCGAGAGGAACTTTACCGG-3′ (Fig. 6). The second PCR was run for 25 cycles of the same temperature profile as that of the first PCR. To improve the specificity of DNA amplification, MasterampTM PCR Optimization Kit (Epicentre Technologies) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol for both the first and second rounds of PCR. The final PCR products were directly cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen). Insert DNAs were isolated from individual colonies and sequenced (34Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52669) Google Scholar). Two micrograms of poly(A)+ RNA prepared from each cell line were fractionated on a formaldehyde agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with radiolabeled probes. To detect DBH messages, cDNA probes for the rat (35Kim K.S. Tinti C. Song B. Cubells J.F. Joh T.H. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and human (29Ishiguro H. Kim K.T. Joh T.H. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17987-17994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) DBH genes were labeled and used as a mixture. To detect NET messages, the rat NET cDNA fragment (21Cubells J.F. Kim K.S. Baker H. Volpe B.T. Chung Y. Houpt T.A. Wessel T.C. Joh T.H. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 502-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was radiolabeled and used as a probe. In addition, a cDNA fragment of 700 bp, encompassing the mouse NET cDNA from middle of exon 1 to exon 6 (a kind gift from Dr. Randy Blakely, Vanderbilt University), was also used as a probe. A cDNA fragment for the mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a positive control. These probes were labeled with [α-32P]dATP using Klenow fragment and random hexamer priming. Blots were autoradiographed on an intensifying screen for 6 to 24 h at −70 °C according to the relative strength of signals. For rehybridization, previous signals were removed by thoroughly washing the membrane at 80 °C in 1.5 mm NaCl, 0.15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7, 0.01% SDS until no signal was detected after overnight exposure. pBLCAT3-1 is a derivative of pBLCAT3 (36Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) which was constructed by deleting the CRE-like sequence and TATA-like sequence upstream of the multiple cloning site (26Kim H.S. Seo H. Brunet J.F. Kim K.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8247-8260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several NET-CAT reporter constructs were prepared using pBLCAT3-1 as follows. A 14-kbSalI fragment of hNET clone 3 (Fig. 1) was cloned into pBLCAT3-1 that was cut with SalI. The resulting plasmid was digested with BamHI, ligated, and named as pNET9000CAT. For the construct containing promoter plus the first intron, intronic sequence was amplified by PCR using sense primer (5′-ACCAGGGATCCCCTCGCCGCCGGACAC-3′) and antisense primer (5′-TCGCGGATCCGAATTCTGGCGAGAGGAACTTTACCGG-3′), digested withBamHI, and subcloned into pNET9000CAT that had been digested with BamHI to yield pNET9000(i)CAT. Based on previous observations that less than 1.5-kb upstream sequence of the hDBH gene drives cell-specific expression (29Ishiguro H. Kim K.T. Joh T.H. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17987-17994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Hoyle G.W. Mercer E.H. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Seo H. Yang C. Kim H.S. Kim K.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4102-4112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we also made pNET-CAT constructs that contain an hNET upstream sequence of comparable length. For this purpose, approximately 1.4-kb upstream region of the hNET gene was amplified by PCR using pNET9000CAT as the template with a sense primer of 5′-GTGCCAAGCTTGATTCGGATAGCGATGTAA-3′ and an antisense primer of 5′-CGAGGGGATCCCTGGTGCC-3′. The PCR product was digested withHindIII and BamHI and subcloned into the pBLCAT3-1 that had been cut with the same enzymes, resulting in pNET1400CAT. The first intron was similarly subcloned into pNET1400CAT, generating pNET1400(i)CAT. The orientation of the first intron in pNET9000(i)CAT and pNET1400(i)CAT was confirmed by sequence analysis. Transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure as described previously (28Kim K.S. Ishiguro H. Tinti C. Wagner J. Joh T.H. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7200-7207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ishiguro H. Kim K.T. Joh T.H. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17987-17994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids for transfection were prepared using Qiagen columns (Qiagen Co., Santa Clarita, CA). For the SK-N-BE(2)C and SK-N-BE(2)M17 cell lines, each 60-mm dish was transfected with an equimolar amount (0.5 pmol) of each reporter construct, 1 μg of pRSV-βgal, varying amounts of the effector plasmid, and pUC19 plasmid to a total of 5 μg of DNA. For the other cell lines, twice as much DNA was used in transfection. To compare the NET promoter activity in NET-positive and NET-negative cell lines, the CAT activity driven by reporter constructs are compared with that driven by pRSV-CAT plasmid which contains the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) enhancer/promoter. Due to its strong promoter activity, a one-tenth molar amount of the reporter construct (0.05 or 0.1 pmol) was used for pRSV-CAT plasmid in transient transfection assay. In cotransfection analysis, a half molar amount of the reporter construct was used for the Phox2a-expressing plasmid, pRc/Phox2a, which was described previously (26Kim H.S. Seo H. Brunet J.F. Kim K.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8247-8260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Yang C. Kim H.S. Seo H. Kim C.H. Brunet J.F. Kim K.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1813-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection, lysed by freeze-thaw cycles, and assayed for CAT activities. To correct for differences in transfection efficiencies among different DNA precipitates, CAT activity was normalized to that of β-galactosidase. CAT and β-galactosidase activities were assayed as described previously (28Kim K.S. Ishiguro H. Tinti C. Wagner J. Joh T.H. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7200-7207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ishiguro H. Kim K.T. Joh T.H. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17987-17994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Eight positive clones, containing insert DNAs of 6–14 kb length, were isolated by screening approximately 1.5 × 106 plaque-forming units of a λEMBL3 human genomic library with a 0.5-kb cDNA probe corresponding to the N-terminal 167 amino acids of the rat NET gene. On subsequent Southern blot analysis, clones 3 and 7 hybridized to an oligonucleotide probe encompassing the translational start codon of hNET. Clones 3 and 7 contained insert DNAs of 14 and 12 kb, respectively, of overlapping sequence (Fig. 1 A). Further restriction mapping and Southern blot analyses indicated that theBamHI-SacI fragment residing at the 3′ side of both clones contained the start codon of hNET (Fig. 1, A andB). Clones 3 and 7 contained approximately 9.5- and 7.5-kb sequence upstream of the start codon of hNET, respectively. Sequence analyses of the BamHI-SacI fragment of both clones 3 and 7 demonstrated that it includes the start codon, untranslated leader sequence, and an exon described as the first exon in previous reports (10Pacholczyk T. Blakely R.D. Amara S.G. Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 17Porzgen P. Bonisch H. Bruss M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 1145-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and a part of an intron (Fig.1 A) previously described as the first intron (17Porzgen P. Bonisch H. Bruss M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 1145-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, the nucleotide sequences of the genomic clone diverged from the published untranslated leader sequence starting at the base 52 bp upstream of the start codon, following perfect matches of 51 bases (Fig. 1 C). Both clones 3 and 7 contained the same nucleotide sequences in this area, indicating that these are not cloning artifacts. In addition, the corresponding nucleotide sequence of the mouse genomic NET clone shows significant homology with that of hNET clone (Fig. 1 C; see Ref. 5Fritz J.D. Jayanthi L.D. Thoreson M.A. Blakely R.D. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2241-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The presence of a consensus splice acceptor site (5′-AG-3′) in the genomic sequence at the junction of divergence suggested the possibility that the human NET gene contains an as-yet-unidentified intron(s) in the middle of the leader sequence. To investigate these findings in detail, the insert DNA of clone 3 was subjected to structural and functional analyses as follows. To assess whether the hNET gene contained an additional intron(s) in the leader sequence, we determined additional nucleotide sequences upstream of the start codon and compared this sequence to the remaining 9 bases of the previously described leader sequence of hNET (see Ref. 10Pacholczyk T. Blakely R.D. Amara S.G. Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar; Fig. 1 C). As shown in Fig.2 (also see Fig. 6), the sequence of clone 3, corresponding to 528–536 bp upstream of the start codon, perfectly matched the remaining leader sequence, 5′-GCCGGACAC-3′ (Fig.1 C). This observation strongly suggests that the intervening 476-bp region represents an as-yet-unidentified intron of the hNET gene. Also consistent with this hypothesis, the putative intervening sequence contains a consensus splicing donor site (5′-GT-3′) at its 5′ end in addition to an acceptor site (5′-AG-3′) at the 3′ end (Fig. 2). Furthermore, eight out of nine nucleotides at the potential exon/intron junction area match the consensus sequence (5′-(A/C)AG/GT(A/G)AGT-3′; see Ref. 39Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar) and as would be expected, a pyrimidine-rich sequence precedes the acceptor site (Fig. 6). Based on these observations, we conclude that the first intron of 476 bp length resides in the middle of the untranslated leader sequence of hNET. Primer extension and 5′-RACE analyses further substantiated this conclusion and identified the full untranslated leader sequences of hNET, as follows. To identify the transcription start site(s) of hNET mRNA, primer extension analysis was performed using poly(A)+ RNAs prepared from SK-N-BE(2)M17, SK-N-BE(2)C, and HeLa cell lines. When the mRNAs from SK-N-BE(2)M17 and SK-N-BE(2)C were primed with the primer 8A, extended cDNA products appeared at multiple locations, clustered in two areas. The first of these clusters occurred between 176 and 184 bp and the second between 208 and 212 bp, upstream of the 3′ utmost base of the primer 8A, respectively (Fig.3).

Here we report that stimulation of theN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, using platelet-activating factor (PAF) as a messenger, activates MAP kinases, including c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons. Activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) blocks this NMDA-signaling through PAF and MAP kinases, and the resultant cell death. Recombinant PAF-acetylhydrolase degrades PAF generated by NMDA-receptor activation; the hetrazepine BN50730 (an intracellular PAF receptor antagonist) also inhibits both NMDA-stimulated MAP kinases and neuronal cell death. The finding that the NMDA receptor-PAF-MAP kinase signaling pathway is attenuated by mGluR activation highlights the exquisite interplay between glutamate receptors in the decision making process between neuronal survival and death."

We utilized published plant P5CS sequence to search the expressed sequence tag data base and cloned two full-length human P5CS cDNAs differing in length by 6 base pairs (bp) in the open reading frame. The short cDNA has a 2379-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 793 residues; the long cDNA, generated by “exon sliding,” a form of alternative splicing, contains an additional 6-bp insert following bp +711 of the short form resulting in inclusion of two additional amino acids in the region predicted to be the γ-glutamyl kinase active site of P5CS. The long form predominates in all tissues examined except gut. We also isolated the corresponding long and short murine P5CS transcripts. To confirm the identity of the putative P5CS cDNAs, we expressed both human forms in γ-glutamyl kinase- and γ-glutamyl phosphate reductase-deficient strains ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae and showed that they conferred the proline prototrophy. Additionally, we found expression of the murine putative P5CS cDNAs conferred proline prototrophy to P5CS-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1). We utilized stable CHO-K1 cell transformants to compare the biochemical characteristics of the long and short murine P5CS isoforms. We found that both confer P5CS activity and that the short isoform is inhibited by l-ornithine with a K i of ∼0.25 mm. Surprisingly, the long isoform is insensitive to ornithine inhibition. Thus, the two amino acid insert in the long isoform abolishes feedback inhibition of P5CS activity by l-ornithine.

Formation of P5C from glutamate in humans has been proposed to be catalyzed either by P5C synthase, a bifunctional enzyme with both γ-glutamyl kinase (γ-GK) and γ-glutamyl phosphate reductase (γ-GPR) activities or a complex of separate γ-GK and γ-GPR enzymes (6Smith R.J.

Genet. 1989; 83: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), a marker linked to P5CS, suggested that the human P5CS gene is on chromosome 10. During the course of our work, Aral et al.(27Aral B. Schlenzig J.-S. Liu G. Kamoun P. Life Sci. 1996; 319: 171-178PubMed Google Scholar) reported the sequence of a human cDNA that, based on sequence similarity, appeared to encode P5CS. Direct evidence showing that this cDNA encodes a functional enzyme was not provided. This group also localized the structural gene encoding this cDNA to chromosome 10 in the interval between q24.3 to q24.6 (28Zhang M.Q. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar).To better understand the molecular enzymology and regulation of mammalian P5CS, we utilized homology to Vigna P5CS to clone two full-length human P5CS cDNAs and the corresponding murine P5CS cDNAs. Expressing these cDNAs in mutant yeast strains and in CHO-K1 cells, we showed both forms of mammalian P5CS encode bifunctional enzymes and complement growth phenotype of mutant cells. More interestingly, we found that the short but not the long P5CS isoform is sensitive to feedback regulation of ornithine. Our results suggest a mechanism for differential regulation of P5CS activity.DISCUSSIONUtilizing homology to Vigna P5CS, we isolated two splice forms of cDNAs encoding human P5CS: a short form (P5CS.short) encoding a 793-amino acid protein and a long form (P5CS.long), with an additional 6-bp insert following bp +711, encoding a 795-amino acid protein. The human P5CS polypeptides have high sequence identity to P5CS of plants and to γ-GK and γ-GPR enzymes of lower eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Expression of human P5CSs restores proline prototrophy in two mutant yeast strains, one deficient in γ-GK (pro1), the other in γ-GPR (pro2), confirming the bifunctional nature of the mammalian enzyme. To study the biochemistry and regulation of mammalian P5CS isoforms, we expressed murine P5CS cDNAs in CHO-K1 cells that lack endogenous P5CS activity. Both murine P5CS cDNAs restored proline prototrophy, and stable transformants expressed measurable P5CS activity. Using extracts of these stable transformants, we showed that the two isoforms differ dramatically in their sensitivity to inhibition by ornithine.During the course of our studies, Aral et al. (27Aral B. Schlenzig J.-S. Liu G. Kamoun P. Life Sci. 1996; 319: 171-178PubMed Google Scholar) also reported the sequence for a human P5CS cDNA. As we did, they identified a partial length EST clone containing the 3′ 438 bp of the ORF. They used the sequence of this EST to initiate a series of 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA end reactions followed by direct sequencing of the products to extend the cDNA sequence 138 bp into the 5′-UTR. The nucleotide sequence of our P5CS cDNAs has 14 single bp differences with that of Aral et al. (27Aral B. Schlenzig J.-S. Liu G. Kamoun P. Life Sci. 1996; 319: 171-178PubMed Google Scholar), all in the ORF and resulting in 13 amino acid changes. Some of these differences may represent polymorphisms; others may reflect sequence errors. Aralet al. (27Aral B. Schlenzig J.-S. Liu G. Kamoun P. Life Sci. 1996; 319: 171-178PubMed Google Scholar) utilized direct sequencing of amplified material. Our composite sequence derives from sequencing multiple cDNA clones in both directions. The overlapping sequences of our various cDNAs are 100% identical (for example, clonesHsP5CS.G1 and HsP5CS.K5 have a 2225-bp overlap in perfect agreement).In addition to the overall similarity of the N-terminal half ofHsP5CS to γ-GKs from a variety of organisms (e.g. 36% identity with S. cerevisiae γ-GK), BLASTP and Blocks data base (39Pietrokovski S. Henikoff J.G. Henikoff S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) searches utilizing the γ-GK domain of the human P5CS as a probe revealed a 32-amino acid motif (from Asp245 to Pro276) in the N-terminal half of human P5CS with similarity to a conserved sequence characteristic for members of the aspartokinase family including aspartokinases, uridylate kinases, and carbamate kinases from a variety of species (46Omori K. Suzuki S.-I. Imai Y. Komatsubara S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 47Omori K. Komatsubara S. J.

Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco1979Google Scholar). The conserved sequence overlaps with and extends more 5′ of a region of sequence similarity between E. coli and Serratia marcescensaspartokinases and γ-glutamyl kinases identified by Omori et al. (46Omori K. Suzuki S.-I. Imai Y. Komatsubara S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), who suggested it is the active site of these related enzymes. Three residues in this motif corresponding to Asp245, Asp260, and Pro276 inHsP5CS.long are conserved in all γ-GKs and nearly all members of the aspartokinase family (Fig. 2). Another region likely to be important for HsP5CS function is a cluster of three amino acids (Asn191, Asp193, and Phe194) about 50 residues N-terminal of the putative aspartokinase motif. These are conserved with Vigna P5CS, where mutagenesis experiments have shown that they are essential for feedback regulation of P5CS activity by proline (40Zhang C. Lu Q. Verma D.P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20491-20496Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1).We identified two forms of P5CS cDNAs differing only by a 6-bp insertion at position +711. Two lines of evidence indicate that this insert is generated by a variant of alternative splicing called “exon sliding” (51Craik C.S. Rutter W.J. Fletterick R. Science. 1983; 220: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). First, the insert sequence is colinear with the genomic sequence of the human P5CS structural gene and has the consensus sequence of a 5′ splice site. The same colinearility is also present in murine P5CS (data not shown). Thus, the choice between the two tandem splice donor sequences determines whether the mature transcript will contain the 6-bp insert. The fact that we see markedly different ratios of short/long transcripts in various tissues suggests either that there is tissue-specific stability of the two products or that the choice of splice donor is somehow regulated. How this choice might be regulated is unclear. Based on the calculation of the consensus value of the 5′ splice donor site (28Zhang M.Q. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 52Shapiro M.B. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar, 53Horowitz D.S.

Genet. 1997; 61: 259-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), both of these tandem donor sites are relatively “weak” with the consensus values of 77.7 and 73.2, respectively, where the value for a typical donor site ranges from 0.7 to 1.0 with the mean of 0.85. This suggests that there might be tissue- or development-specific factor(s) influencing the relative use of the two competing 5′ splice sites. Multiple mechanisms including cis elements andtrans-acting factors influence 5′ splice site selection (53Horowitz D.S. Krainer A.R.

Exonic splicing enhancers are positive acting, cisRNA sequences capable of inducing the assembly of the splicesome at weak 5′ splice sites and are generally purine-rich. Interestingly, we note several purine-rich sequences in both HsP5CS andMmP5CS cDNAs 20–500 bp 3′ of the 6-bp insert, for example, a GGAAATGAAAA 47 bp 3′ (bp +765 to +775), a GGAGGGGAAGAAG 314 bp 3′ (bp +1032 to +1045), and an AGCAGGGAGAAA 376 bp 3′ (bp +1094 to +1105) of the 6-bp insert of the HsP5CS long cDNA.

Genomics. 1997; 40: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).Interestingly, the 2-amino acid insert (Val238 and Asn239 in P5CS.long) is immediately N-terminal of the putative aspartokinase motif (amino acids 245–276) and 43 amino acids C-terminal of the cluster of residues (amino acids 191–194) predicted to be involved in the feedback regulation of plant P5CS by proline (Fig. 1). This location in or near the active site and the apparent variation in the ratio of short versus long isoforms in different tissues suggests that the presence or absence of the insert may play a role in the regulation of P5CS activity. Previous work utilizing extracts of rat small intestinal mucosa showed that mammalian P5CS is inhibited by ornithine with a K i of about 0.4 mm (44Lodato R.F. Smith R.J. Valle D. Phang J.M. Aoki T.T. Metabolism. 1981; 30: 908-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 45Henslee J.G. Wakabayashi Y. Small C. Jones M.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 226: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We found similar results for the isoform encoded by the predominant gut transcript (P5CS.short). In mice and humans, plasma ornithine is about 75 μm with a distribution ratio of intracellular/extracellular ornithine of about 5, predicting an intracellular ornithine concentration of ∼0.37 mm (15Valle D. Simell O. Scriver C. Beaudet A. Sly W. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw Hill, New York1995: 1147-1185Google Scholar). This suggests that physiologic concentrations of ornithine are in the range predicted to regulate P5CS.short activity. By contrast, we found the long P5CS isoform is insensitive to ornithine inhibition. These results correlate functional differences in the protein with the choice of splice sites. As far as we know, this is the first demonstration of functional differences in protein isoforms generated by exon sliding.The P5CS reaction serves two physiologic functions in mammals: proline biosynthesis and arginine biosynthesis. In tissues with a high protein synthetic requirement for proline (e.g. cartilage and possibly central nervous system), P5CS catalyzes the first committed step in the two-step pathway synthesizing proline from glutamate (5Phang J.M. Yeh G.C. Scriver C.R. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw Hill, New York1995: 1125-1146Google Scholar). In prokaryotes and plants, this pathway is regulated by allosteric inhibition of P5CS by the end product, proline (7Hu C.A. Delauney A.J. Verma D.P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast to prokaryotes, yeast, and plants, the mammalian P5CS reaction is also the first committed step in the pathway of de novoarginine biosynthesis. In this pathway, the product of the P5CS reaction is converted to ornithine by OAT and then to citrulline and arginine by the enzymes of the urea cycle (15Valle D. Simell O. Scriver C. Beaudet A.

The physiologic significance of this arginine synthetic pathway is highlighted by the observations that mice with targeted disruption of OAT die as a result of arginine deficiency in the neonatal period and that human infants with inherited deficiency of OAT develop severe hypoargininemia (76Wang T. Lawler A.M. Steel G. Sipila I. Milam A.H. Valle D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The variable sensitivity to end product inhibition of the two isoforms of mammalian P5CS (P5CS.short and P5CS.long) provides a mechanism for this differential regulation. Additionally, mammalian P5C reductase, which catalyzes the first committed step in proline biosynthesis, is sensitive to inhibition by proline (77Valle D. Downing S.J. Phang J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 54: 1418-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Combining our results with this information suggests a tissue-specific model for regulation of the pathway converting glutamate to either arginine or proline. In gut, where the emphasis is on arginine biosynthesis, P5CS.short is the predominant isoform, and ornithine regulates the pathway by its inhibitory effect on P5CS. In peripheral tissues where proline biosynthesis is important, P5CS.long predominates, and the pathway is insensitive to ornithine but is regulated at the level of mammalian P5C reductase by proline (Fig. 8).Aral et al. (27Aral B. Schlenzig J.-S. Liu G. Kamoun P. Life Sci. 1996; 319: 171-178PubMed Google Scholar) and Kamoun et al. (78Kamoun P. Aral B. Saudubray J.-M. Bull. Acad. Natl. Med.

Their biochemical phenotype (low plasma proline, citrulline, and ornithine) suggests P5CS deficiency, and both were shown to be homozygous for the P5CS missense mutation, L396S. The functional consequence of this mutation on P5CS activity was not tested. Availability of the human P5CS cDNA sequences and the expression systems provided by P5CS-deficient CHO-K1 cells and yeast strains provides the molecular resources to study the P5CS genes of these and similar patients. Proline can be synthesized either from glutamate or ornithine and is nonessential for full-term human infants and adults (1Hiramatsu T. Cortiella J. Marchini J.S. Chapman T.E. Young V.R. Am. J. Clin.

Increasingly, there is evidence that G proteins may play other roles as well. Dominant-negative constructs of the α subunit of G proteins would be useful in studying the roles of G proteins in a variety of processes, but the currently available dominant-negative constructs, which target Mg2+-binding sites, are rather leaky. A variety of studies have implicated the carboxyl terminus of G protein α subunits in both mediating receptor-G protein interaction and in receptor selectivity. Thus we have made minigene plasmid constructs that encode oligonucleotide sequences corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal undecapeptide of Gαi, Gαq, or Gαs. To determine whether overexpression of the carboxyl-terminal peptide would block cellular responses, we used as a test system the activation of the M2 muscarinic receptor activated K+ channels in HEK 293 cells. The minigenes were transiently transfected along with G protein-regulated inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRK) into HEK 293 cells that stably express the M2 muscarinic receptor. The presence of the Gαi carboxyl-terminal peptide results in specific inhibition of GIRK activity in response to agonist stimulation of the M2 muscarinic receptor. The Gαi minigene construct completely blocks agonist-mediated M2 mAChR K+ channel response whereas the control minigene constructs (empty vector, pcDNA3.1, and the Gα carboxyl peptide in random order, pcDNA-GαiR) had no effect on agonist-mediated M2 muscarinic receptor GIRK response.

G proteins play important roles in determining the specificity and temporal characteristics of a variety of cellular responses. Upon activation, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) interact with their cognate heterotrimeric G protein, inducing GDP release with subsequent GTP binding to the α subunit. The exchange of GDP for GTP leads to dissociation of the Gβγ dimer from the Gα subunit, and both initiate unique intracellular signaling responses (for review, see Refs. 1Hamm H.E. Gilchrist A. Curr.

Molecular cloning has resulted in the identification of 18 distinct Gα subunits that are commonly divided into four families based on their sequence similarity: Gi, Gs, Gq, and G12.

Dominant-negative constructs of the α subunit of G proteins have been made in which mutations are made in residues that contact the magnesium ion. Although this approach was quite successful with p21ras and other small G proteins (3John J. Rensland H. Schlichting I. Vetter I. Borasio G.D. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol.

This is probably because of the degree to which Mg2+ is necessary to support GDP binding. p21ras forms a tight and nearly irreversible GDP·Mg2+ complex, whereas Gα subunits bind Mg2+ in the GDP·Mg2+ complex with lower affinity than in the GTP·Mg2+ complex (11Higashijima T.

It is thought that there are multiple sites of contact between the activated receptor and the G protein. Studies using ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin, site-directed mutagenesis, peptide-specific antibodies, and chimeric proteins indicate that the carboxyl terminus of the Gα subunit is not only an essential region for receptor contact, but is also important for determining G protein receptor specificity (reviewed in Refs. 1Hamm H.E.

Transient transfection of COS-7 cells with α1B-adrenergic receptors or M1 muscarinic receptors and the Gαqcarboxyl-terminal minigene (residues 305–359) inhibits agonist stimulated inositol phosphate (IP) production, whereas co-expression with the Gαq amino terminus (residues 1–54) has no effect. Inhibition by Gαq (305–359) was apparently specific for Gq-coupled receptors because neither α2A-adrenergic receptor-mediated IP production (Gi-coupled), nor dopamine D1Areceptor-mediated cAMP production (Gs-coupled) were inhibited. In addition, transgenic mice made by targeting the Gαq carboxyl-terminal minigene to the myocardium resulted in a marked inhibition of α1B-adrenergic receptor-mediated IP production and blockade of cardiac hypertrophy.In this paper, we study the effects of several carboxyl termini Gα peptides using a minigene approach. To test whether minigene constructs encoding the carboxyl-terminal 11 amino acid residues from Gα subunits could effectively inhibit G protein-coupled receptor-mediated cellular responses, we chose a system in which 1) the importance of the carboxyl terminus and 2) the downstream effector system had been well established.

This channel is activated upon stimulation of M2 mAChR in a manner that is completely pertussis toxin-sensitive and is the prototype for a direct Gβγ-activated channel (52Krapivinsky G.

Our experiments indicate that the Gαi carboxyl terminus minigene construct can completely block M2 mAChR-mediated K+ channel activation. The inhibition appears specific as constructs producing Gαs, Gαq, or a scrambled Gαicarboxyl-terminal peptide had no effect.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDominant-negative constructs of the α subunit of G proteins have been made in which mutations are made in regions that contact the magnesium ion. For the α subunit of G proteins, this includes mutations of the Gly residue within the invariant sequence (G203T,G204A), as well as mutations of a Ser residue in the effector loop, switch I region (S47C) in either Gαo or Gαi (5Slepak V.Z.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4037-4041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, neither of these mutations has resulted in effective dominant-negatives probably because the GDP complexes of Gαi, Gαo, and Gαs have low affinity for Mg2+. Thus, we looked to other regions on G protein α subunits that could serve to block receptor-G protein interactions, and consequently serve as dominant-negatives. A variety of studies have implicated the carboxyl terminus of G protein α subunits in mediating receptor-G protein interaction and selectivity (for review, see Refs. 14Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar and 15Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). We have shown that carboxyl termini from G protein α subunits are important sites of receptor binding, and peptides corresponding to the carboxyl terminus can be used as competitive inhibitors of receptor-G protein interactions (27Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hoffmann K.P. Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 29Martin E.L. Rens-Domiano S. Schatz P.J. Hamm H.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21519-21525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction is quite specific as we found that a difference in 1 amino acid can annul the ability of the Gαi1/2 peptide to bind the A1 adenosine receptor-G protein interface (31Gilchrist A. Mazzoni M. Dineen B. Dice A. Linden J. Proctor W.R. Lupica C.R. Dunwiddie T. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14912-14919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).To determine whether we could selectively antagonize G protein signal transduction events in vivo by expressing peptides that block the receptor-G protein interface, we generated minigene plasmid constructs that encode carboxyl-terminal peptide sequences from Gαi1/2, Gαq, or Gαs (TableI). As a control, we also made a minigene that expressed the carboxyl terminus of Gαi1/2 in random order (GαiR, Table I). The minigene insert DNA were made by synthesizing short complimentary oligonucleotides corresponding to the peptide sequences from the carboxyl terminus of each Gα withBamHI and HindIII restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. Complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1(−). The DNA was cut with NcoI, and separated on a 1.5% agarose gel to determine whether the insert was present. As shown in Fig.1, when insert is present there is a newNcoI site resulting in a shift in the band pattern, such that the digest pattern goes from three bands (3345, 1352, and 735 bp) to four bands (3345, 1011, 735, and 380 bp).Table ICarboxyl termini sequencesGαl1/2I K N N L K D C G L FGαqL Q L N L K E Y N A VGαsQ R M H L R Q Y E L LGαiRN G I K C L F N D K LAlignment of the last 11 amino acid residues from human Gαi1/2, Gαq, and Gαs subunits. Also shown is the peptide sequence of GαiR, the Gαi1/2sequence in random order, used to construct the control minigene. Open table in a new tab As our minigene approach depends on competitive inhibition, a key element for success is the expression of adequate amounts of peptides to block intracellular signaling pathways. To confirm the presence of the minigene constructs in transfected cells, total RNA was isolated 48 h posttransfection, cDNA made with RT-PCR, and PCR analysis was performed using the cDNA as template with primers specific for the Gα carboxyl-terminal peptide insert. Separation of the PCR products on 1.5% agarose gels (Fig.2 A) indicates the presence of the Gα carboxyl terminus peptide minigene RNA by a single 434-bp band. Control experiments were done using a T7 forward primer with the vector reverse primer to verify the presence of the pcDNA3.1 vector, and G3DPH primers (CLONTECH) to approximate the amount of total RNA (data not shown).To verify that the peptide was being produced in the transfected cells, 48 h posttransfection, cells were lysed and homogenized. Cytosolic extracts were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography, and peaks (Fig. 2 B) were analyzed by ion mass spray analysis. The mass spectrometer analysis for peak 1 from the pcDNA-Gαi transfected cells, and peak 1 from cells transfected with a vector expressing the carboxyl terminus in random order (pcDNA-GαiR) indicate that a 1450 molecular weight peptide was found in both cytosolic extracts. This is the expected molecular weight for both 13 amino acid peptide sequences. The fact that they were the major peptides found in the cytosol from cells transiently transfected with the pcDNA-Gαi or pcDNA-GαiR vectors strongly suggests that the vectors are producing the appropriate peptide sequences. Therefore, analysis of the transiently transfected HEK 293 cells indicates (1Hamm H.E. Gilchrist A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) minigene vectors are present, and (2Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) the corresponding peptides are being expressed.We examined whether the presence of the Gαicarboxyl-terminal peptide minigene would result in a significant inhibition of a downstream functional response following agonist stimulation of the transiently transfected cells. G protein-regulated inwardly rectifying K+ channels modulate electrical activity in many excitable cells (for review, see Refs. 60Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 61Breitwieser G. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 152: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 62Wickman K.B. Clapham D.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because the channel opens as a consequence of a direct interaction with Gβγ, whole cell patch clamp recording of inwardly rectifying K+ currents can be used as a readout of G protein activity in single intact cells. Thus, we tested whether the Gα carboxyl-terminal peptide minigenes could inhibit M2 mAChR activation of inwardly rectifying K+ currents. Superfusion of HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with GIRK1/GIRK4 and either pcDNA-Gαi or pcDNA-GαiR DNA with 1 μm ACh revealed that cells transfected with pcDNA-Gαi DNA have a dramatically impaired response to the M2 mAchR agonist (Fig.3). Fig. 3, A and Bshows representative recordings of whole cell membrane currents at −90 mV. Superfusion of the cells with ACh activates inward currents in cells transfected with pcDNA-GαiR (Fig.3 A) but not in cells transfected with pcDNA-Gαi (Fig. 3 B). The inwardly rectifying IV-curve for the ACh-induced current from the experiment shown in Fig. 3 A is illustrated in Fig. 3 D. The strong inwardly rectifying properties of this current is characteristic of IKACh channels. Summarized data for the maximum amplitude of ACh-evoked currents are shown for three different transfection conditions as indicated by the black bars. The maximum current evoked by ACh was 3.7 ± 1.5 pA/pF (n = 14) in cells transfected with the pcDNA-Gαi compared with 24.1 ± 8.8 pA/pF (n = 11) in cells transfected with pcDNA-GαiR. As a control we transfected cells with empty vector (pcDNA3.1). The ACh responses in these cells (16.5 ± 7.7 pA/pF (n = 5) was not significantly different from responses measured in cells transfected with pcDNA-GαiR (Fig. 3 C). Basal levels for all three conditions were equivalent (pcDNA 3.2 ± 1.8 pA/pF (n = 5); Gαi 6.1 ± 0.9 pA/pF (n = 14); GαiR 5.6 ± 2.0 pA/pF (n = 10)). To exclude experiments in which we recorded currents from cells that may not have expressed the functional channel, only those cells that exhibited a basal nonagonist-dependent Ba2+ (200 μm) sensitive inwardly rectifying current were used for analysis. Thus, it appears that the Gαi minigene construct completely blocks the agonist-mediated M2 mAChR GIRK1/4 response, whereas the control minigene constructs (empty vector, pcDNA3.1, and the Gαi1/2 carboxyl peptide in random order, pcDNA-GαiR) had no effect on the agonist-mediated M2 mAChR GIRK1/4 response.Figure 3Minigenes encoding carboxyl-terminal Gαi peptides inhibit M2mAChR activated IKACh.

https://openalex.org/W2099295024,"A channel-associated protein PSD-95 has been shown to induce clustering of N-methyld-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, interacting with the COOH terminus of the ε subunit of the receptors. The effects of PSD-95 on the channel activity of the ε2/ζ1 heteromeric NMDA receptor were examined by injection of PSD-95 cRNA into Xenopus oocytes expressing the NMDA receptors. Expression of PSD-95 decreased the sensitivity of the NMDA receptor channels to l-glutamate. Mutational studies showed that the interaction between the COOH terminus of the ε2 subunit of the NMDA receptor and the second PSD-95/Dlg/Z0-1 domain of PSD-95 is critical for the decrease in glutamate sensitivity. It is known that protein kinase C markedly potentiates the channel activity of the NMDA receptor expressed in oocytes. PSD-95 inhibited the protein kinase C-mediated potentiation of the channels. Thus, we demonstrated that PSD-95 functionally modulates the channel activity of the ε2/ζ1 NMDA receptor. PSD-95 makes signal transmission more efficient by clustering the channels at postsynaptic sites. In addition to this, our results suggest that PSD-95 plays a protective role against neuronal excitotoxicity by decreasing the glutamate sensitivity of the channels and by inhibiting the protein kinase C-mediated potentiation of the channels.

Complementary RNAs of NMDA receptors were synthesized in vitro with T3 RNA polymerase using NotI-cleaved plasmids as templates. The coding region of PSD-95 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a rat brain cDNA library. The resulting product was subcloned into pSP64 poly(A) vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The construction was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The PSD-95 cRNA was synthesized in vitro with SP6 RNA polymerase usingEcoRI-cleaved plasmid. Deletion and site-specific mutants of the NMDA receptor ε2 subunit and PSD-95 were constructed by polymerase chain reaction strategy using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (see Fig. 7 A). The wild-type ε2 subunit and PSD-95 were used as polymerase chain reaction templates for mutation, except the C(3,5)SΔPDZ(1+2) construct, for which the ΔPDZ(1+2) construct was used as a template. Mutations were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Stage V and VI oocytes were obtained from anesthetized Xenopus laevis and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 2 mg/ml collagenase in Barth's medium (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, and 7.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) containing 18 units/ml penicillin and 18 μg/ml streptomycin without Ca2+. The follicular cell layer was then removed with forceps. The oocytes were injected with ε2 and ζ1 cRNAs at a molar ratio of 1:2. The total amounts of cRNA injected were 5 ng/oocyte. For co-expression of PSD-95, the synthesized PSD-95 cRNA (1–25 ng) was injected 24 h after injection of the NMDA receptor cRNAs. Before recording, oocytes were incubated at 19 °C for 18–26 h in Barth's medium. Currents were recorded with two-electrode voltage-clamp techniques using a CA-1a high performance oocyte clamp (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of 1–5 megaohms. Oocytes were perfused by a constant stream of Ba2+ Ringer solution (115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mmBaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) at 23–25 °C. The oocyte membrane was voltage-clamped at −70 mV. In the standard assay, currents were evoked by bath perfusion of Ba2+ Ringer solution containing 100 μm l-glutamate and 10 μm glycine for 20 s, followed by a washout with standard Ba2+ Ringer solution. Current signals were digitized for analyses; statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. Polyclonal antibodies against the NMDA receptor ε2 and ζ1 subunits were obtained from Calbiochem and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Monoclonal antibody against the central region (amino acids 353–504) of rat PSD-95 was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Polyclonal antibodies against PSD-95 were raised in rabbits using a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein with the NH2-terminal region (amino acids 4–404) of rat PSD-95 as immunogen and were affinity-purified. For immunoblotting of PSD-95, oocytes were solubilized with Laemmli gel sample buffer containing 2% SDS (50 μl/oocyte) (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207139) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting of the NMDA receptor, the total membrane fraction was prepared from oocytes. After measurement of current responses, oocytes were homogenized with 100 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min. The obtained pellet (total membrane fraction) was solubilized with Laemmli gel sample buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 5 or 7.5% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets. After blocking with 5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-HCl-buffered saline, the sheets were incubated with primary antibodies in the blocking solution. Labeled bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). The bands were analyzed by densitometric scanning using Densitograph AE-6900M (Atto Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The amounts of the proteins were quantified from the intensity of the bands, which has a linearity to the amounts of the samples applied to the gel. To investigate the effects of PSD-95 on the channel activities of the ε2 (NR2B)/ζ1 (NR1a) heteromeric NMDA receptor, we expressed the NMDA receptor and PSD-95 inXenopus oocytes by injection of in vitrosynthesized cRNAs. When the expression of the proteins was monitored by immunoblotting, the level of the NMDA receptor reached a plateau ∼40 h after injection of the cRNAs and was then constant for several days (data not shown). On the other hand, the level of PSD-95 rapidly increased to the maximum within 24 h after injection and then decreased (data not shown). Therefore, in this study, PSD-95 cRNA was injected into oocytes that were already expressing the NMDA receptor, and the effects of PSD-95 on the NMDA receptor channels were examined 18–26 h after injection of PSD-95 cRNA, measuring current responses to 100 μm l-glutamate and 10 μmglycine in Ba2+ Ringer solution under voltage clamp at −70 mV. However, the results obtained with these oocytes were qualitatively the same as those obtained with oocytes in which cRNAs of the NMDA receptor and PSD-95 were co-injected. To characterize the channels in oocytes co-expressing PSD-95, we first examined the effects of ifenprodil on the channel activity. Ifenprodil is known to selectively block ε2/ζ1 heteromeric NMDA receptor channels (30Williams K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 851-859PubMed Google Scholar). Ifenprodil completely inhibited the channels in oocytes co-expressing the receptor and PSD-95, as in oocytes expressing the receptor alone, whereas it had no effect on other subtypes of NMDA receptor channels such as the ε1/ζ1 heteromeric receptor (Fig.1). These results indicate that the current responses in oocytes co-expressing the receptor with PSD-95 are indeed through ε2/ζ1 NMDA receptor channels. The average of the current responses from 15 oocytes was 1.34 ± 0.56 μA (mean ± S.D., n = 15) in oocytes expressing the NMDA receptor and 2.56 ± 1.00 μA (mean ± S.D.,n = 15) in oocytes co-expressing PSD-95. When the expression of the receptor was compared in these oocytes by immunoblotting, the expression level of the receptor was proportional to the current response, and the ratio between ε2 and ζ1 subunits was not changed by PSD-95 (Fig. 2). These results indicate that PSD-95 does not inhibit the expression or plasma membrane insertion of the receptor. A higher expression level of the receptor in oocytes co-expressing PSD-95 might be due to the stabilization of the receptor by interacting with PSD-95. However, the amplitudes of evoked currents varied from oocyte to oocyte and could not simply be compared between oocytes expressing the receptor and co-expressing PSD-95. In this study, we focused on the qualitative differences in the channel properties between them. When the channel activities were measured at various concentrations of glutamate, the dose-response curve shifted to the right in oocytes co-expressing the receptor and PSD-95 (Fig. 3). The EC50 was increased from 1.39 to 5.76 μm by injection of PSD-95 cRNA. Thus, PSD-95 significantly decreased the sensitivity of the channels to glutamate. On the other hand, PSD-95 did not change other basic properties of the NMDA receptor such as a requirement for glycine as co-agonist, the current-voltage relationship, and a voltage-dependent Mg2+block of the channels (data not shown).Figure 2Expression of the ε2/ζ1 NMDA receptor inXenopus oocytes. Oocytes were injected with cRNAs of the ε2/ζ1 NMDA receptor (lanes 1) and ε2/ζ1 NMDA receptor and PSD-95 (lanes 2). PSD-95 cRNA (25 ng) was injected into oocytes expressing the ε2/ζ1 NMDA receptor. After measurement of current responses, 15 oocytes were combined, and the total membrane fraction was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 5% gel. Immunoblotting was performed with antibodies against the ε2 (A) and ζ1 (B) subunits of the NMDA receptor. The average of the currents evoked by 100 μm l-glutamate and 10 μmglycine was 1.34 ± 0.56 μA (mean ± S.D.,n = 15) in oocytes expressing the NMDA receptor and 2.56 ± 1.00 μA (mean ± S.D., n = 15) in oocytes co-expressing PSD-95. The amounts of expressed NMDA receptor were estimated by densitometric scanning of the immunoblot. The ratios of the amounts of expressed ε2 and ζ1 subunits were 1:1.97 and 1:2.05, respectively, between oocytes expressing the NMDA receptor and co-expressing PSD-95.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Dose-response curves forl-glutamate in oocytes expressing the ε2/ζ1 NMDA receptor and PSD-95. Various concentrations of l-glutamate with 10 μm glycine were applied, and the steady-state currents were measured in oocytes injected with ε2/ζ1 NMDA receptor cRNAs (closed circles) and with ε2/ζ1 NMDA receptor and PSD-95 cRNAs (open circles). PSD-95 cRNA (25 ng) was injected 24 h after injection of NMDA receptor cRNAs. Each point represents the mean ± S.E. of the current amplitudes obtained from five oocytes. Theoretical curves were drawn according to the equationI = I max/(1 + (EC50/A)n), where Irepresents the current response, I max is the maximum response, A is the concentration ofl-glutamate, and n is the Hill coefficient. The EC50 values were 1.39 and 5.76 μm for oocytes expressing the ε2/ζ1 NMDA receptor and co-expressing PSD-95, respectively, and the Hill coefficient values were 1.29 and 1.07, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It was reported that the channel activity of the ε2/ζ1 NMDA receptor in oocytes is markedly potentiated by treatment with TPA, due to activation of protein kinase C (28Kutsuwada T. Kashiwabuchi N. Mori H. Sakimura K. Kushiya E. Araki K. Meguro H. Masaki H. Kumanishi T. Arakawa M. Mishina M. Nature. 1992; 358: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar, 31Mori H. Yamakura T. Masaki H. Mishina M. Neuroreport. 1993; 4: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 32Wagner D.A. Leonard J.P. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Under our assay conditions, the evoked currents were ∼4-fold increased by 1 μm TPA in oocytes expressing the NMDA receptor (Figs.4 and 5). In oocytes co-expressing PSD-95, however, little potentiation of the channel activity (∼1.3-fold) was observed with TPA treatment (Figs. 4and 5). This inhibitory effect of PSD-95 on the potentiation of the channels by TPA was dependent on the amounts of PSD-95 cRNA injected into an oocyte (Fig. 5). To rule out the possibility that PSD-95 directly modulates protein kinase C in oocytes, we examined the effects of PSD-95 on the metabotropic glutamate receptor. The activity of metabotropic glutamate receptors in oocytes can be estimated by the channel activity of Ca2+-activated chloride channels. When expressed in oocytes, metabotropic glutamate receptor-5 showed pronounced desensitization in response to an activation by 1 mm glutamate (data not shown), as reported previously (33Gereau R.W. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1998; 20: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This desensitization has been shown to require protein kinase C-catalyzed phosphorylation of the receptor (33Gereau R.W. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1998; 20: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Indeed, a brief treatment with TPA after activation by glutamate prolonged the desensitization. Co-expression of PSD-95 had no effect on the desensitization upon activation by 1 mm glutamate or on the prolonged desensitization by TPA (data not shown), indicating that expression of PSD-95 does not change the activity of protein kinase C in oocytes.Figure 5Dose-dependent effects of PSD-95 on the protein kinase C-mediated potentiation of NMDA receptor channels. Various amounts (1–25 ng/oocyte) of PSD-95 cRNA were injected into oocytes expressing the ε2/ζ1 NMDA receptor. The potentiation of the current response after TPA treatment (at 1 μm for 10 min) was plotted against the amounts of PSD-95 cRNA injected into an oocyte. The data shown are the mean ± S.E. of four oocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) PSD-95 has been shown to interact with the COOH terminus of the NMDA receptor ε2 subunit through the first two PDZ domains (18Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar, 19Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). To clarify a role of this interaction in the modulation of glutamate sensitivity, the effects of PSD-95 were examined on the mutant NMDA receptor that lacks the COOH-terminal four amino acid residues of the ε2 subunit. The change in the sensitivity to glutamate was monitored by the ratio of current response at 100 μm glutamate to that at 10 μm. In accord with the dose-response curves (Fig. 3), expression of PSD-95 increased the ratio from 1 to ∼1.5 in oocytes expressing the wild-type NMDA receptor (Fig.6). In oocytes expressing the mutant receptors, however, the ratio remained ∼1 regardless of PSD-95 expression (Fig. 6). These data indicate that the interaction of the COOH-terminal region of the ε2 subunit with the PDZ domain of PSD-95 is essential for a decrease in sensitivity to glutamate. The modulation of glutamate sensitivity by PSD-95 was further analyzed using a series of PSD-95 mutants (Fig.7 A). The expression of these constructs was compared with that of wild-type PSD-95 by immunoblotting with antibodies against the NH2-terminal region (amino acids 4–404) and against the central region (amino acids 353–504) of rat PSD-95. When 25 ng of cRNA was injected into an oocyte for each mutant, there was no significant difference in the expression of these constructs at the protein level (Fig. 7, B andC). The deletion mutant lacking the SH3 domain (ΔSH3), the COOH-terminal half-region including the SH3 and guanylate kinase-like domains (ΔC-half), or the PDZ1 domain (ΔPDZ1) had the same effect on the glutamate sensitivity of the channels as full-length PSD-95 (Fig. 8). Deletion of the PDZ2 domain (ΔPDZ2) significantly decreased the ratio of current responses between 100 and 10 μm l-glutamate from that of full-length PSD-95. A double PSD domain deletion mutant lacking both PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains (ΔPDZ(1+2)) and a triple PDZ domain deletion mutant (ΔPDZ(1+2+3)) further decreased the ratio to that observed in oocytes expressing the channels without PSD-95 (Fig. 8). Since two cysteine residues near the NH2 terminus at positions 3 and 5 in PSD-95 have been shown to be critical for the in vivointeraction with the K+ channel (34Hsueh Y.P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 35Topinka J.R. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), we examined the role of these two cysteine residues in the channel modulation by PSD-95 using the mutant in which both of these cysteine residues were substituted to serine (C(3,5)S). This construct partially decreased the ratio from that of wild-type PSD-95 (Fig. 8). Deletion of both PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains from this mutant (C(3,5)SΔPDZ(1+2)) further decreased the ratio to the level without PSD-95 (Fig. 8). Thus, the PDZ2 domain is critical for the action of PSD-95 on the glutamate sensitivity of the channels, although the PDZ1 domain and the NH2-terminal two cysteine residues play an additional role in it. PSD-95 has been shown to induce clustering of the ε2 (NR2B) NMDA receptor (23Kim E. Cho K.O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). In addition to this function of PSD-95, the present study demonstrated that it functionally modulates the channel activity of the ε2/ζ1 heteromeric NMDA receptor. PSD-95 decreased the sensitivity of the channels to l-glutamate (Fig. 3) and inhibited the protein kinase C-mediated potentiation of the channels (Figs. 4 and 5). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the interaction between the COOH terminus of the ε2 subunit and the PDZ2 domain of PSD-95 plays a critical role in the decrease in glutamate sensitivity (Fig. 8). On the other hand, other basic channel properties of the ε2/ζ1 NMDA receptor such as a voltage-dependent Mg2+ block, a requirement for glycine as co-agonist, and inhibition of the channels by ifenprodil are not significantly altered by PSD-95. Our results indicate that PSD-95 has inhibitory effects on ε2/ζ1 NMDA receptor channels, in contrast to the inward rectifier K+ channel Kir4.1. The channel activity of the latter channel is enhanced by PSD-95 in co-expressed cells (27Horio Y. Hibino H. Inanobe A. Yamada M. Ishii M. Tada Y. Satoh E. Hata Y. Takai Y. Kurachi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12885-12888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For ε2/ζ1 NMDA receptor channels, PSD-95 not only makes signal transmission more efficient by clustering the channels at postsynaptic sites, but also protects neuronal cells from excitotoxicity by decreasing the glutamate sensitivity and by inhibiting the protein kinase C-mediated potentiation. Our mutational studies indicate that a direct interaction between the COOH terminus of the NMDA receptor ε2 subunit and the PDZ2 domain of PSD-95 is responsible for the decrease in the glutamate sensitivity of the channels because PSD-95 could not decrease the sensitivity of the mutant NMDA receptor lacking the COOH-terminal four amino acid residues (Fig. 6) and because the activity to decrease the sensitivity was significantly reduced in any mutants of PSD-95 lacking the PDZ2 domain (Fig. 8). It has been reported that the ε2 subunit (NR2B) has a strong preference for the PDZ2 domain over the PDZ1 domain (19Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In accord with this, deletion of the PDZ2 domain did not completely abolish the effect of PSD-95, whereas a double PSD domain deletion of both PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains did (Fig. 8). The interaction between the COOH terminus of the channels and the PDZ2 domain also induces channel clustering (23Kim E. Cho K.O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 34Hsueh Y.P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Does channel clustering decrease glutamate sensitivity? The NH2-terminal two cysteine residues of PSD-95 have been shown to be essential for clustering of Shaker-type K+ channel Kv1.4, but not for the binding of the COOH terminus of the channel to the PDZ1 or PDZ2 domain (34Hsueh Y.P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). If this is true of the NMDA receptor, our results suggest that the binding (but not the clustering) decreases glutamate sensitivity because the activity to decrease the glutamate sensitivity was still retained to some extent (Fig. 8) when cysteines 3 and 5 of PSD-95 were substituted with serine, which completely abolishes the channel clustering activity (34Hsueh Y.P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This intermediate effect of the cysteine substitution might be explained by the finding that cysteines 3 and 5 are palmitoylated, which is essential for membrane targeting of PSD-95 (35Topinka J.R. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The PSD-95 mutant, which is not recruited to the plasma membrane, might not efficiently exert its action on the channels even though it has a PDZ2 domain. The EC50 of NMDA receptor channels forl-glutamate in neurons has been measured in cultured neurons. The reported values vary from 2.3 to 16 μm (36Patneau D.K. Mayer M.L. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 2385-2399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,37Sather W. Dieudonne S. MacDonald J.F. Ascher P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 450: 643-672Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Lower EC50 values (0.8–1.5 μm) were reported, including this study, in oocytes expressing ε2/ζ1 (or NR1/NR2B) NMDA receptor channels (28Kutsuwada T. Kashiwabuchi N. Mori H. Sakimura K. Kushiya E. Araki K. Meguro H. Masaki H. Kumanishi T. Arakawa M. Mishina M. Nature. 1992; 358: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar, 38Laube B. Hirai H. Sturgess M. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 439-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). These values cannot simply be compared because a neuron may not express only one type of NMDA receptors. Furthermore, the kinetics of the channel in neurons are not simple since the desensitization occurs during measurement. Despite these uncertainties, the EC50 obtained from oocytes co-expressing the ε2/ζ1 NMDA receptor with PSD-95 (Fig. 3) is in good agreement with EC50 values obtained from neurons. We do not know the physiological significance of this effect of PSD-95 on the channels. PSD-95 may play a protective role in neuronal excitotoxicity, lowering the sensitivity of the NMDA receptor channels to glutamate. In this study, we demonstrated that PSD-95 suppresses the protein kinase C-mediated potentiation of NMDA receptor channels (Figs. 4 and5). It is unlikely that PSD-95 directly inhibits the kinase activity of protein kinase C in oocytes because PSD-95 had no effect on the desensitization of metabotropic glutamate receptor-5 in oocytes co-expressing both proteins, which was shown to require phosphorylation of metabotropic glutamate receptor-5 by protein kinase C (33Gereau R.W. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1998; 20: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Further study is necessary to elucidate how the NMDA receptor channels are potentiated by protein kinase C and how this potentiation is modulated by PSD-95. Although ε2/ζ1 NMDA channels in oocytes are potentiated by the treatments that activate protein kinase C (Fig. 4) (31Mori H. Yamakura T. Masaki H. Mishina M. Neuroreport. 1993; 4: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 32Wagner D.A. Leonard J.P. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), it is still controversial whether phosphorylation by protein kinase C potentiates the NMDA receptor channels in vivo. The protein kinase C-mediated potentiation of the channels is observed in dorsal horn neurons in spinal cord and caudal brain stem (5Chen L. Huang L.Y. Neuron. 1991; 7: 319-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 39Gerber G. Kangrga I. Ryu P.D. Larew J.S. Randic M. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3606-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas activation of the kinase does not potentiate NMDA receptor-mediated responses in CA1 hippocampal neurons (40Markram H. Segal M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 457: 491-501Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) where the ε2 subunit is highly expressed (9Monyer H. Sprengel R. Schoepfer R. Herb A. Higuchi M. Lomeli H. Burnashev N. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1217-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar, 10Nakanishi S.

Nature. 1992; 358: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). The latter observation can be explained in part by our finding that PSD-95 suppresses the protein kinase C-mediated potentiation of ε2/ζ1 NMDA receptor channels. The induction of LTP at synapses requires Ca2+entry into the postsynaptic dendritic spine via NMDA receptors (15Bliss T.V. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9558) Google Scholar). LTP is triggered by delivering synchronous high frequency stimulation, a tetanus, to the pathway. In the widely accepted model, tetanic stimulation sufficiently depolarizes the postsynaptic membranes, which reduces the extent of the Mg2+-induced block of NMDA receptors and allows Ca2+ influx (15Bliss T.V. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9558) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, the PSD-95-interacting NMDA receptors also showed a voltage-dependent Mg2+ block of the channels (data not shown). A number of evidences indicate that the activation of protein kinase C is necessary for induction of LTP (15Bliss T.V. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9558) Google Scholar, 41Larkman A.U. Jack J.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). If the activation of protein kinase C is induced by tetanic stimulation, PSD-95 may play a protective role regarding the NMDA receptor channels, preventing further potentiation of the channels and excess Ca2+ influx. In this study, we demonstrated that PSD-95 functionally modulates the channel activity of the ε2/ζ1 heteromeric NMDA receptor. Recently, a number of proteins were reported to bind to PSD-95. GKAP (guanylate kinase-associatedprotein) or SAPAP (SAP90/PSD-95-associated protein) binds to the guanylate kinase-like domain (42Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent zymogen that, like other vitamin K-dependent proteins, is capable of binding to negatively charged phospholipid surfaces (3Castellino F.J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1995; 5: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 4Seegers W.H. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1981; 7: 257-262Crossref Google Scholar). Unlike the other vitamin K-dependent proteins, activation occurs on the surface of endothelial cells. In vivo, endothelial cells serve primarily anticoagulant functions. Because negatively charged phospholipid would serve to augment the clotting cascade as well as the anticoagulant pathway, for the endothelium to serve selective anticoagulant functions alternative mechanisms are required for assembling anticoagulant complexes on the endothelial cell surface. Endothelial cells constitutively express a protein C/APC-binding protein, designated the endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) (5Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which appears to serve this function. Blocking protein C binding to EPCR decreases protein C activation by the thrombin-TM complex on cultured endothelium, primarily because of an increase in theK m for protein C (6Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Mollica J.S. Ferrell G.L. Esmon C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In humans, the plasma concentration of protein C, ≈65 nm, is considerably below the K m for the thrombin-TM activation complex incorporated into phosphatidylcholine vesicles (2 μm(7Freyssinet J. Gauchy J. Cazenave J. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). Because the vasculature varies dramatically in diameter between the large vessels and the capillaries, assuming a constant TM density per endothelial cell, the effective TM concentration rises from less than 5 nm to more than 100 nm as the blood moves from the aorta to the capillaries (1Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Busch C. Cancilla P. DeBault L. Goldsmith J. Owen W. Lab. Invest. 1982; 47: 498-504PubMed Google Scholar). This has led to the concept that most protein C activation occurs in the microcirculation (1Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These considerations raise the question of whether there might be a compensatory mechanism to augment protein C activation selectively in the large vessels. EPCR expression varies throughout the vasculature (9Laszik Z. Mitro A. Taylor Jr., F.B. Ferrell G. Esmon C.T. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3633-3640Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and is sensitive to a variety of effector systems (5Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, EPCR expression levels are highest on the endothelium of large vessels, decreasing progressively with decreasing vessel size until the EPCR becomes undetectable by immunohistochemical approaches in most capillary beds (9Laszik Z. Mitro A. Taylor Jr., F.B. Ferrell G. Esmon C.T. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3633-3640Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 10Fukudome K. Ye X. Tsuneyoshi N. Tokunaga O. Sugawara K. Mizokami H. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). With cultured endothelium, EPCR expression is down-regulated by cytokines like tumor necrosis factor α (5Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5571-5577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, EPCR mRNA levels are up-regulated by thrombin in cell culture and by endotoxin and thrombin in vivo (12Ding W. Gu J.-M. Fukudome K. Laszik Z. Grammas P. Esmon C.T. Circulation. 1996; 94 (abstr.): I694Google Scholar). Because of the variable EPCR expression on endothelium, the relationship between EPCR expression levels and its cofactor function in protein C activation gains biological importance for understanding the anticoagulant properties of different vascular beds. To address the relationship between the EPCR concentration and protein C activation, we have isolated EPCR from placenta and recombinant EPCR from cultured cells and reconstituted the protein into phospholipid vesicles. The results indicate that an excess of EPCR to TM is required for optimal EPCR enhancement of protein C activation and that the EPCR enhances activation effectively when reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine vesicles that cannot effectively support the coagulation cascade. Human protein C and APC (13Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. Le Bonniec B.F. Johnson A.E.

Biophys. 1977; 178: 356-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) thrombin. Human kidney 293 cells were stably transfected with human EPCR (referred to as E7 cells) and cultured as described previously (19Fukudome K. Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. He X. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17491-17498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Human umbilical vein endothelial cell(s) (HUVEC) were cultured with endothelial cell growth factor, heparin, and heat-inactivated bovine calf serum as described (21Houston D.S. Carson C.W. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11778-11785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All purification procedures up to and including immunoaffinity purification were performed at 4 °C. Two frozen human placentas were thawed, diced, and passed through a commercial, motor-driven meat grinder (Leeson Electric Co., Grafton, WI) five times. The ground placenta was suspended in 1,600 ml of 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mmbenzamidine-HCl, 0.02% NaN3, 5 mm d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone (Calbiochem), and 0.02m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Larger particles were partially disrupted by repeatedly drawing the sample into a 60-ml catheter syringe followed by rapid sample expulsion. The tissue was collected by centrifugation at 4,800 × g for 30 min. The pellets were resuspended and collected by centrifugation as before, except that the chloromethyl ketone was omitted in the wash buffer and thereafter. This process was repeated two times. EPCR and TM were extracted from the washed pellet with 2 volumes of wash buffer made 1% in Triton X-100 using a Tissumiezer Mark II (Tekmar Company, Cincinnati, OH) homogenizer. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 40 min. The extracts were run quickly through a 5 × 30-cm column packed with 10 g of swollen Sephadex G-50 to remove particles and decrease nonspecific binding to the affinity columns. The filtrate was applied overnight to two 1.5 × 17-cm immunoaffinity columns connected in tandem: an anti-EPCR 1496 Affi-Gel 10 gel and anti-TM CTM1029 Affi-Gel 10 (5 mg of mAb/ml of gel). The two columns were washed separately with 2 column volumes of 0.15 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (Tris-buffered saline; TBS), 0.1% Lubrol PX, followed by 4 column volumes of 2 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Lubrol PX at 1 ml/min. After washing with 2 additional column volumes of TBS, 0.1% Lubrol PX, the TM was eluted at 0.5 ml/min with 50% ethylene glycol, 5 mm MES-HCl, pH 6.0, containing 0.1% Lubrol PX. The protein-containing fractions were pooled and brought to 0.15m NaCl by the addition of 1.5 m NaCl, 0.2m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. This material was applied to a Mono Q HR5/5 column attached to a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia), washed with 100 ml of the lead buffer, and developed with a 26-ml linear gradient from 0.1 to 2.0 m NaCl in 0.02m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 15 mm OG. For EPCR, the mAb column was washed with 4 column volumes of TBS containing 15 mm OG at 0.333 ml/min, and the EPCR was eluted with 2 column volumes of 50% ethylene glycol, 15 mm OG, 5 mm MES-HCl, pH 6.0. The protein-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and buffer exchanged into 0.05 mNaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm OG using a Centriprep-30 (Amicon). This material was applied to a Mono Q HR5/5 column on a fast protein liquid chromatography system and developed with a 26-ml linear gradient from 0.05 to 1.0 m NaCl in 15 mm OG, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Some minor contaminants were separated from the EPCR, which was eluted as a single peak at approximately 0.2 m NaCl. E7 cells were detached from a cell factory (6,320 cm2) with 2 liters of 0.526 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (138 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.4; Sigma). The cells were centrifuged at 3,500 × g for 30 min. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The cell pellets were extracted for 15 min with 120 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 0.25m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm benzamidine-HCl, 0.02% NaN3, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min, and particulates were removed with a 0.45 μm filter. The filtrate was applied to the anti-EPCR mAb 1496 Affi-Gel 10 column (8 ml) at 0.67 ml/min. The column was washed and eluted essentially as described above for the placental EPCR, except that the volumes were reduced in proportion to the resin volume. The protein-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and buffer exchanged into TBS containing 15 mm OG using the Centriprep-30. Purified EPCR and TM were incorporated into phospholipid vesicles by minor modifications of the method described by Galvinet al. (22Galvin J.B. Kurosawa S. Moore K. Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2199-2205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mg of phospholipid was dissolved with 40 μl of 14% OG in TBS. TM (5 μg) and EPCR ranging from 0 to 27.4 μg were added, and the final volume was adjusted to 200 μl with TBS. [14C]Phosphatidylcholine was included as a tracer. The samples were dialyzed against three changes, 1 liter each, of TBS, 0.02% NaN3 for 45 h. The dialyzed sample was mixed with 0.2 ml of 50% sucrose, overlaid with 0.8 ml of 20% sucrose, and finally overlaid with 0.2 ml of TBS before centrifugation at 20 °C in a TLA-100.2 rotor (Beckman) for 16 h at 100,000 × g. 0.2-ml fractions were collected from the sucrose density gradients. The phospholipid concentration was determined based on [14C]phosphatidylcholine content (22Galvin J.B. Kurosawa S. Moore K. Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2199-2205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The surface-expressed TM concentration was determined based on the rate of rGDPC activation and compared with a standard curve with purified TM as described (22Galvin J.B. Kurosawa S. Moore K. Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2199-2205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (also see below). Previous studies have shown that the activation of GDPC is not influenced by incorporation of TM into liposomes (22Galvin J.B. Kurosawa S. Moore K. Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2199-2205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by the presence of EPCR (6Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Mollica J.S. Ferrell G.L. Esmon C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). EPCR concentrations were determined with a sandwich ELISA (see below). Surface-expressed EPCR was assumed to be half of the total associated with the liposome. Protein C and GDPC activation rates by liposome-incorporated TM were measured by a modification of the method of Galvin et al. (22Galvin J.B. Kurosawa S. Moore K. Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2199-2205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, vesicles containing 20 μg/ml phospholipid and TM or TM and EPCR were mixed at 37 °C in a 96-well microtiter plate with 0.1 μm protein C or rGDPC in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 3 mmCa2+, and 0.6 mm Mg2+. 5 nm human or bovine thrombin was added to initiate activation. In some cases, 0.1 μm anti-EPCR mAb 1494 or 1 μm annexin V was added before protein C and preincubated with the vesicles for 5 min at room temperature to block the EPCR or to block the negatively charged phospholipid surface. The reactions were stopped at defined time intervals by the addition of 0.20 volume of antithrombin (1.5 mg/ml) containing 20 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES-HCl, pH 7.5. APC and activated rGDPC concentrations were determined based on their amidolytic activities toward 0.2 mm Spectrozyme PCa substrate in 0.15m NaCl, 20 mm HEPES-HCl, pH 7.5. The rates of substrate cleavage were measured with a V maxmicroplate reader (Molecular Devices). The concentration of enzyme in these reaction mixtures was determined by comparison with a standard curve of amidolytic activity versus enzyme concentration constructed with freshly prepared, fully activated protein C or rGDPC (22Galvin J.B. Kurosawa S. Moore K. Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2199-2205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under the conditions employed in this study, less than 10% of the protein C was activated during the assay, and all assays were linear as a function of time between the initiation and termination of the assay. The assay was modified from Kurosawaet al. (23Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Hidari N. Esmon C.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of 5 μg/ml anti-EPCR mAb 1494 in 15 mm Na2CO3, 35 mmNaHCO3, pH 9.6. The remaining steps were performed at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and were blocked with TBS and 0.1% gelatin. The wells were washed, 50-μl samples in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 were added in duplicate wells, and the plates were incubated for 1 h. The wells were washed and 50 μl of biotin-conjugated anti-EPCR mAb 1495 (2 μg/ml) or biotin-conjugated anti-EPCR mAb 1,500 (1 μg/ml) was added. The plates were incubated for 1 h, washed, and 50 μl of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1 μg/ml) was added and incubated for 1 additional h. The wells were washed five times, and 50 μl of 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate was added. The end point absorbance at 405 nm was read on aV max microplate reader. The standard curve was linear (r = 0.999) from 0 to 100 ng/ml. TM (0.5 μg/ml) in TBS containing 0.1% Lubrol PX was incubated for 1 h with 0.5 unit/ml chondroitinase ABC at 37 °C before analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) in a semi-dry apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with non-fat milk, incubated with anti-TM mAb CTM1009, washed, and incubated with sheep anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were washed and developed with the ECL substrate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-EPCR mAb 1500 (1.2 mg/ml) and anti-TM mAb CTM1029 (3.3 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline were added to 7.5 and 30 mmcysteine, respectively. The mAbs were then incubated at 37 °C for 90 min with a 1:50 ratio (w/w) of ficin (Sigma). Iodoacetamide (11.25 mm for mAb 1500 and 45 mm for mAb CTM1029) was added to inhibit further proteolysis. The digests were buffer exchanged into TBS on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified on a protein G column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). IODO-GEN (Pierce) was used to radiolabel the Fab fragments according to the manufacturer's protocol. 125I-Labeled Fab fragments were separated from free iodine on a PD-10 column. Confluent HUVEC in 24-well plates were washed two times with wash buffer (Hanks' buffered salt solution containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 3 mm Ca2+, 0.6 mm Mg2+). Binding studies were carried out in reaction mixtures containing medium 199 supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% normal human IgG in a total volume of 0.2 ml. After incubation of cells with125I-labeled anti-EPCR (1500) or anti-TM mAb CTM1029 Fab fragments (30 nm) at 37 °C for 30 min, the cells were washed rapidly four times with cold wash buffer. The Fab fragments were then eluted from the cells three times with cold acid buffer (0.15m NaCl, 20 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.5).125 I in the supernatant was measured in an Iso-Data 500 γ-counter. The number of Fab binding sites was calculated based on the radioactivity in the supernatant and the specific activity of the125I-labeled mAb Fab fragments. Nonspecific binding was determined with a 100-fold excess of the corresponding unlabeled mAb and was less than 5% of the total counts eluted. HUVEC in 24-well plates were washed two times with wash buffer and preincubated for 5 min with wash buffer, 0.1 μm 1494, 0.1 μmCTM1009, or 1 μm recombinant annexin V before the addition of 0.1 μm protein C or rGDPC. The activation reactions were initiated by addition of 5 nm bovine thrombin in a total volume of 0.2 ml. After 30 min at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by adding 40 μl of antithrombin (1.66 mg/ml) to the reactions. The supernatants were transferred to the 96-well microplate, and the amidolytic activities of activated protein C or rGDPC were determined toward 0.2 mm Spectrozyme PCa substrate in 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm HEPES-HCl, pH 7.5. APC or activated rGDPC concentrations were determined by reference to a standard curve as described above under “Protein C or GDPC Activation Assay.” All determinations were performed in duplicate. Human TM and EPCR were isolated from placenta as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The SDS-PAGE of freshly prepared EPCR is shown in Fig. 1 A and exhibits one major band with or without disulfide bond reduction. EPCR stored at 4 °C formed some aggregates that were partially eliminated by disulfide bond reduction (Fig. 1 B), consistent with the aggregation being mediated by the free Cys residues in the extracellular domain, the transmembrane domain, and the cytosolic tail of the EPCR (5Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fukudome K. Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. He X. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17491-17498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). EPCR from placenta and EPCR from the transfected cell line (E7) exhibited similar mobility on SDS-PAGE. The apparent mass of the EPCR (40 kDa) on SDS-PAGE is approximately twice that predicted from the amino acid sequence, consistent with the predicted four N-linked carbohydrate attachment sites on EPCR (5Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some degradation in the placental EPCR was often observed. Considerably less degradation was observed in the EPCR isolated from the E7 cells. Mono Q chromatography of the immunoaffinity-purified TM resulted in a major peak with a shoulder on the trailing edge. This shoulder was less than 30% of the TM preparation (data not shown). TM isolated in the major peak from the Mono Q column (i.e. largely devoid of chondroitin sulfate, see below) is shown in Fig. 1 B. As has been observed with other human TM preparations from placenta (25Salem H.H. Maruyama I. Ishii H. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12246-12251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there are aggregates and some degradation products present in addition to the major monomeric TM form. Most of these aggregates could be dissociated by disulfide bond reduction, consistent with the known Cys residues in the cytoplasmic tail (26Jackman R.W. Beeler D.L. Fritze L. Soff G. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6425-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27Wen D. Dittman W.A. Ye R.D. Deaven L.L. Majerus P.W. Sadler J.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4350-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 28Suzuki K. Kusumoto H. Deyashiki Y. Nishioka J. Maruyama I. Zushi M. Kawahara S. Honda G. Yamamoto S. Horiguchi S. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1891-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The presence of a trailing shoulder on the main peak from the Mono Q column behavior is indicative of relatively anionic forms of human TM. This anionic character appears to be caused by modification with chondroitin sulfate. Western blots of the trailing fractions revealed a diffuse band that was sharpened after chondroitinase ABC treatment (Fig. 1 C). Rabbit TM has been shown to contain a chondroitin sulfate moiety that renders the molecule more anionic, and the proteoglycan form migrates as a diffuse, slower moving band when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (29Bourin M.-C. Öhlin A.-K. Lane D.A. Stenflo J. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8044-8052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary data with human TM preparations are also consistent with this proposal (30Lin J.-H. McLean K. Morser J. Young T.A. Wydro R.M. Andrews W.H. Light D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25021-25030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antigen levels of TM and EPCR in the Triton X-100 extract of the placenta were determined by ELISA. Assuming nearly complete extraction, there were approximately 0.22 mg of EPCR and 0.88 mg of TM per placenta. The higher TM:EPCR ratio is consistent with the observation that EPCR is found mostly in large vessels, and TM is in both large and microvessels, the latter constituting the vast majority of the endothelium (8Busch C. Cancilla P. DeBault L. Goldsmith J. Owen W. Lab. Invest. 1982; 47: 498-504PubMed Google Scholar). The availability of purified human TM and EPCR allowed us to reconstitute the isolated proteins into membrane vesicles using the detergent dialysis technique (22Galvin J.B. Kurosawa S. Moore K.

Proteins incorporated into the phospholipid can be separated from free protein by sucrose density gradient centrifugation in which the liposomes are found at the top of the gradient and the free protein near the bottom. As can be seen in Fig. 2, placental TM and EPCR from either tissue culture or from placenta can be incorporated into vesicles in this fashion.

https://openalex.org/W1965886467,"Transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors (NRs) involves the concerted action of coactivators, chromatin components, and the basal transcription machinery. Crucial NR coactivators, which target primarily the conserved ligand-regulated activation (AF-2) domain, include p160 family members, such as TIF2, as well as p160-associated coactivators, such as CBP/p300. Because these coactivators possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity, they are believed to function mainly by regulating chromatin-dependent transcriptional activation. Recent evidence suggests the existence of an additional NR coactivator complex, referred to as the thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein (TRAP) complex, which may function more directly as a bridging complex to the basal transcription machinery. TRAP220, the 220-kDa NR-binding subunit of the complex, has been identified in independent studies using both biochemical and genetic approaches. In light of the functional differences identified between p160 and TRAP coactivator complexes in NR activation, we have attempted to compare interaction and functional characteristics of TIF 2 and TRAP220. Our findings imply that competition between the NR-binding subunits of distinct coactivator complexes may act as a putative regulatory step in establishing either a sequential activation cascade or the formation of independent coactivator complexes.

They can be categorized into different subfamilies according to characteristics such as nature of ligand, DNA response element, or oligomerization status. Usually, steroid hormone receptors, which mainly form homodimers, are distinguished from a large diverse subfamily of receptors for nonsteroid ligands, such as thyroid hormone (TR), retinoids (retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor (RXR)), and eicosanoids (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)), as well as many orphan receptors, for which ligands have not been identified yet or do not exist. Unlike steroid receptors, most of these NRs function as heterodimers with RXR and thus represent highly dynamic transcription factor complexes due to the association of two receptor subunits with distinct structural and functional features (3Forman B.M.

The majority of NRs utilizes two distinct domains for transcription activation, located in the N and C termini, respectively: a constitutive AF-1 and a ligand-regulated AF-2 as part of the multifunctional ligand-binding domain (LBD). NRs function in concert with multiple transcriptional cofactors, including basal transcription factors, corepressors, and coactivators (for review, see Refs. 7Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar and8Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Rain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol.

Substantial progress in structural and functional analysis has allowed a more detailed understanding of interactions between the AF-2 domain and associated cofactors and further revealed a conserved mechanism for NR activation upon ligand binding (9Brzozowski A.M.

Briefly, ligand activation is associated with structural rearrangements within the LBD, causing the dissociation of corepressors and permitting the recruitment of coactivators or other cofactors with regulatory functions (e.g. RIP140 (15Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar)). In agreement with the structural conservation of the coactivator interaction surface (10Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K.

Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). NR coactivators are envisaged to function within larger multiprotein complexes (see, for example, Refs. 18Kurokawa R.

Multiple evidence suggests the existence of at least two distinct coactivator complexes for the ligand-regulated AF-2 domain referred to as the p160 complex and the TRAP complex. The p160 complex is believed to integrate p160 family members (e.g. SRC-1, TIF2, and ACTR/p/CIP), CBP/p300, and PCAF (Refs. 17Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K.

The composition of the complex has been proposed on basis of the direct and functional interconnection of all subunits, although the existence in vivo has yet to be demonstrated. Because all these coactivators possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity and/or function in complex with other acetyltransferases, whereas corepressors apparently function in complex with deacetylases, functional connections between NR activation and the histone acetylation status have been proposed (for reviews, see Refs. 27Wolffe A.P. Pruss D. Cell. 1996; 84: 817-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar and 28Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). A different NR coactivator complex, the TRAP complex, has been biochemically identified as a TR-associated multiprotein complex and demonstrated to function as coactivator in in vitrotranscription systems (20Fondell J.D. Ge H. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8329-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), suggesting a direct bridging function to the basal transcription machinery. This complex consists of at least nine different subunits and apparently does not contain p160/CBP coactivators. The AF-2 domain-binding 220-kDa subunit of the TRAP complex, referred to as TRAP220, was recently cloned (29Yuan C.X. Ito M. Fondell J.D. Fu Z.Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7939-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) and found to be identical to a putative NR coactivator named PBP/TRIP2, which we and others independently have isolated in genetic two-hybrid screenings using TR and PPAR, respectively (Refs. 30Lee J.W.

To get more insights into the relationship between TRAP220 and p160 coactivators, we have attempted to compare in this study the interaction characteristics of TRAP220 and the p160 family member TIF2 in the context of the TR AF-2 domain, as well as in the context of the TR/RXR heterodimer. We describe novel features of TRAP220 and suggest a competition model that may also have relevance for the recruitment of p160 and TRAP coactivator complexes to NRs and may further help to integrate these different complexes into current NR activation models. All constructs were generated using standard cloning procedures and verified by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. Details of each construction are available upon request. For yeast expression, GAL4 DNA-binding domain (aa 1–147) fusions to PPARα and TRα have been previously described (15Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). GAL4-TRAP220 was generated by insertion of a partial EcoRI fragment (aa 425–973) into pGBT9 or pAS2–1 (CLONTECH). For yeast coactivation studies, TRAP220 (aa 425–973), mTIF2/GRIP1 (aa 322–1121), and hRIP140 (aa 1–1158) were cloned into the NLS-vector pYEX (15Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). For mammalian expression, pSG5-GAL4-TRAP220 was derived from pYEX. TRAP220 constructs were made by insertion of original cDNA fragments (TRAP220, aa 222–1582; dominant negative TRAP220, aa 579–667) into pSG5 (Stratagene) or have been described before (31Zhu Y. Qi C.

His-tagged TRAP220 (aa 503–718) is derived from pET15B (Novagen). Yeast two-hybrid screenings for rPPARα interacting proteins using a mouse embryo day 17.5 cDNA library (CLONTECH) were essentially performed as described previously (15Treuter E. Albrektsen T.

RXRs were detected using specific primers by polymerase chain reaction directly from the yeast colonies in more than 50% of the growth positives. Library plasmid DNA from 26 positive non-RXR clones was isolated, and inserts were sequenced. To obtain full-length cDNAs, λ-ZAP cDNA libraries from rat thymus (Stratagene) or rat brown adipose tissue (a kind gift of H. M. Gardiola-Diaz) were screened using the partial mPIP9/TRAP220 two-hybrid clone. Overlapping clones were assembled to the full-length TRAP220 cDNA encoding an putative open reading frame of 1582 aa, which is more than 95% identical to the reported sequence of the mouse homologue PBP (31Zhu Y.

Adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10) were decapitated, and the tissues were excised and frozen on dry ice. Embryonic rats (days 12–21 of embryonic development (e12–e21)) were excised from pregnant females and frozen. Tissue section and in situ hybridization was carried out essentially as described previously (37Kuiper G. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.Å. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The probes produced similar results when used separately and were usually combined to intensify the hybridization signal. Several probes of nonrelated mRNAs with known expression patterns, similar length, and similar GC content were used as controls to verify the specificity of the hybridizations. Purified His-tagged TRAP220 protein (aa 503–718) was used to immunize rabbits (Zeneca). Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies (aP9) were prepared using a GST-TRAP220 protein covalently coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibody specificity was tested using recombinant proteins and whole cell extracts. For Western analysis, whole cell extracts were prepared as described fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Filters were blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS-Tween 80 and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-TRAP220 (aP9) or anti-His6 (Santa Cruz) in PBS/Tween80 for 60 min at room temperature. After washing, the filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-IgG antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a dilution of 1:2000 for 60 min. After washing, the proteins were visualized with x-ray film using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitations, whole cell extracts (usually 0.2 mg) prepared from untransfected 293 cells in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitors (“Complete” Boehringer Mannheim) were precleared (30 min at 4 °C) with preimmune serum and immunoprecipitated (2 h at 4 °C) using anti-TRAP220 serum or purified antibody (aP9) and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immnuoprecipitates were washed three times and subjected to Western analysis. Purification of GST- and His-tagged proteins and GST pull-down assays were essentially performed as described previously (15Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.Å. Mol.

Approximately 50 μg of COS-1 cell extract transiently expressing TRα was incubated with 1 μg of double-stranded biotinylated DR4 oligonucleotides. The complex was immobilized on streptavidin MagneSphere paramagnetic beads (Promega) and used to analyze binding of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated proteins. After washing, the radiolabeled proteins were eluted, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by fluorography. To detect TRAP220 proteins from cell extracts, bound proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western analysis using the TRAP220-specific antibody aP9.Figure 6Ternary complex formation and competition of TRAP220 and TIF2 on DNA-bound TR/RXR heterodimers.

Anti-GST antibody was immobilized on research grade CM5 sensor chips using the amine coupling kit and the GST capture kit provided by the manufacturer. The immobilization procedure was as follows: 30 μl of NHS/EDC mixture was injected to activate the surface, followed by 40 μl of diluted anti-GST antibody, and finally 35 μl of ethanolamine was injected to block unreacted groups on the chip. After immobilization, GST, GST-TRAP220 (aa 425–718), or GST-TIF2 (aa 594–766) was bound to individual flow cell surfaces. 50 μl of purified His-tagged TRβ LBD (aa 197–456; 0.1 mg/ml HBS containing 1 μm TR ligand T3), kindly provided by S. Nilsson (KaroBio), was injected over each surface (multichannel mode). The amount of TR protein that associated with the captured GST proteins was quantified by measurement of the SPR signal in resonance units (RU). To look for competition between TRAP220 and TIF2, GST or GST-TRAP220 was captured as described above. 70 μl of TRβ (0.1 mg/ml) was injected over the two surfaces. Finally, 60 μl of TIF2 (0.1 mg/ml), which was obtained by thrombin cleavage of the GST-TIF2 protein, was injected. Additional experimental details are described under “Results” and in the legend to Fig. 5. EMSAs were performed under previously described conditions (15Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6001-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) with the following modification: end-labeled doubled-stranded oligonucleotides containing DR4-TRE were incubated with either TRβ/RXRα for 10 min at room temperature in the absence or presence of ligands. Purified cofactor or control proteins (0.1–1.0 μg/reaction) were added last, and binding was allowed to proceed for 20 min. All cell lines except 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). 293 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.5% nonessential amino acids. Both media contained 100 μl/ml penicillin and 100 μl/ml streptomycin. Transfections were performed as previously described (15Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) using phenol red-free medium with 1 μg of reporter plasmid UAS-tk-luc (6Wiebel F.F. Gustafsson J.Å. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3977-3986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the indicated amounts of expression vectors in the absence or presence of ligands. pYEX-based cofactor expression plasmids were introduced into the Saccharomyces cerevisiaereporter strain Y187 (MATα, ura3–52, his 3–200, ade2–101, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, gal4–542, gal80.538, URA3::GAL1-lacZ) bearing various GAL4 constructs. Quantitative liquid β-galactosidase assays and all standard yeast manipulations were essentially as described (15Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.Å. Mol.

Partial cDNA clones encoding AF-2 domain-interacting fragments of TRAP220/PBP (aa 503–754) and TIF2/GRIP1 (aa 320–1119) were isolated in two-hybrid protein-protein interaction screenings using the rat PPARα as bait and a mouse embryo cDNA library (for details, see under “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 36Leers J. Treuter E. Gustafsson J.Å. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6001-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To isolate the TRAP220 full-length cDNA, we screened two λ cDNA libraries (derived from rat thymus or brown adipose tissue mRNA, respectively). Alignment of six independent overlapping cDNA clones revealed a putative open reading frame of 1582 aa with a predicted molecular mass of 156 kDa. Cloning of the full-length rat TIF2 (1464 aa) has been described previously (36Leers J. Treuter E. Gustafsson J.Å. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6001-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A schematic illustration of the structural organization and functional characteristics of the two coactivators is shown in Fig. 1. Except for the central NR interaction domain containing two (TRAP220) or three (TIF2) LXXLL motifs (NR box), TRAP220 and TIF2 are not structurally related to each other. TIF2 contains an N-terminal bHLH-PAS domain, possibly serving oligomerization and DNA binding functions. Other characteristics are two transcription activation domains (AD1 and AD2, respectively) located in the C terminus. Although AD1, at least in part, may function through the recruitment of CBP/p300, specific target proteins for AD2 are not known (26Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Except for the NR interaction domain, several putative nuclear localization signals as well as multiple putative phosphorylation andN-glycosylation sites, no other domain indicating specific functions could be recognized in TRAP220. Compositional sequence analysis identified serine as the dominant amino acid residue (277 aa or 17.7% of the protein). The TRAP220 C terminus, which includes a serine-rich region followed by a mixed charged cluster, has been suggested"

We have mapped the DNase-I-hypersensitive (HS) regions of the human GATA-3 gene in T-cells and non-T-cells and studied their transcriptional activities. HS I–III, located 5′ from the transcriptional initiation site, were found in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells, whereas HS IV–VII, located 3′ from the transcriptional start site, were exclusively observed in T-cells. Among these hypersensitive sites, two transcriptional control elements were found, one in the first intron of the GATA-3 gene and the other between 8.3 and 5.9 kilobases 5′ from the GATA-3transcriptional initiation site. The first intron acted as a strong transcriptional activator in a position-dependent manner and with no cell-type specificity. The upstream regulatory element could confer T-cell specificity to the GATA-3 promoter activity, and analysis of this region revealed a 707-base pair silencer that drastically inhibited GATA-3 promoter activity in non-T-cells. Two CAGGTG E-boxes, located at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the silencer, were necessary for this silencer activity. The 3′-CAGGTG E-box could bind USF proteins, the ubiquitous repressor ZEB, or the basic helix-loop-helix proteins E2A and HEB, and we showed that a competition between ZEB and E2A/HEB proteins is involved in the silencer activity.

Lineage commitment and differentiation of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells occur throughout life and are mostly regulated at the transcriptional level (1Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 4025-4039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple studies have now shown that lineage-restricted expression of a subset of transcription factors is essential to achieve proper development of all the hematopoietic lineages, and therefore, the knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of the expression of these lineage-restricted transcription factors is of considerable importance for further understanding of hematopoiesis. Transcription factors of the GATA family are related by their conserved zinc-finger motif that binds to the consensus DNA sequence 5′-(A/T)GATA(A/G)-3′ (2Orkin S.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 575-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the GATA factors, GATA-1, -2, and -3 are necessary for hematopoiesis, as gene disruption of any one of these factors results in major hematopoietic defects (3Pevny L. Simon M.C. Robertson E.

GATA-1, -2, and -3 display different lineage-restricted patterns of expression in hematopoietic cells. GATA-1 is abundant in the erythrocytic, mastocytic, and megakaryocytic lineages and is also present at a lower level in multipotential progenitors (7Tsai S.-F. Martin D.I.K. Zon L.I. D'Andrea A.D.

Nature. 1990; 344: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar); GATA-2 is mostly expressed in uncommitted hematopoietic progenitors, immature erythroid cells, and proliferating mast cells (10Yamamoto M. Ko L.J. Leonard M.W. Beug H. Orkin S.H. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1650-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar); and GATA-3 is expressed in very immature hematopoietic progenitors and then only in the T-cell and natural killer cell lineages (11Mouthon M.-A. Bernard O. Mitjavila M.-T. Roméo P.-H. Vainchenker W. Mathieu-Mahul D. Blood. 1993; 81: 647-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Biassoni R. Verdiani S. Cambiaggi A. Roméo P.-H. Ferrini S. Moretta L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1083-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). GATA-3 was first shown to be abundantly expressed in T-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and embryonic brain (13Joulin V. Bories D. Elouet J.-F. Labastie M.-N. Chrétien S. Mattéi M.-G.

Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 2673-2686PubMed Google Scholar). More detailed studies have shown that GATA-3 gene expression occurs in numerous sites during development: placenta, kidney, and adrenal gland; the embryonic central and peripheral nervous systems; and embryonic liver and thymus (14George K.M. Leonard M.W. Roth M.E. Lieuw K. Kioussis D. Grosveld F. Engel J.D. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 2673-2686PubMed Google Scholar). Contrasting with this wide expression during development, GATA-3 mRNAs are mostly detected in thymocytes and T-lymphocytes and in the central nervous system in the adult. This gene expression pattern, regulated during development and cellular differentiation, might be mediated by a complex array ofcis-acting elements, as shown in the regulation of transcription factor genes in invertebrates (15Arnone M.I. Davidson E.H. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 1851-1864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As for hematopoiesis, an extinction of GATA-3 gene expression in stable cell hybrids formed by fusion of cell lines representing the erythrocytic and the T-lymphocytic lineages indicated that GATA-3 might be repressed in hematopoietic non-T-cells (16Murrell A.M. Green A.R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 631-639PubMed Google Scholar), a kind of regulation already shown for the CD4 gene, another T-cell-specific gene (17Sawada S. Scarborough J.D. Killeen N. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 917-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The human, mouse, and chicken GATA-3 genes have been cloned, and sequence analysis of their promoters revealed that they are embedded within a CpG island and share structural features often found in promoters of housekeeping genes (14George K.M.

Transfection experiments of reporter genes controlled by the mouse or chickenGATA-3 promoter have failed to show any appropriate T-cell-regulated expression, which indicates that the GATA-3regulatory elements lie 5′ and/or 3′ from the GATA-3promoter (14George K.M.

To understand the transcriptional controls that regulate GATA-3 gene expression in T-cells, we have mapped the DNase-I-hypersensitive (HS) 1The abbreviations used are: HS, hypersensitive; bp, base pair; kb, kilobase(s); CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. regions of the humanGATA-3 gene in T-cells and in hematopoietic non-T-cells, and we have studied the role of these regions in GATA-3 gene expression in T-cells. Approximatively 109 cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline; resuspended in 20 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, and 5% sucrose) containing 0.05% (Jurkat), 0.2% (K562), or 0.6% (HeLa) Nonidet P-40; and broken by five strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were purified by centrifugation over a sucrose gradient (10% sucrose in homogenization buffer), washed twice in wash buffer (15 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 15 mm NaCl, 60 mmKCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, and 10% sucrose), and subjected to increasing concentrations of DNase-I (0.1–15 mg/ml; Worthington) in wash buffer plus 1 mmMgCl2 for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml final concentration), SDS (1% final concentration), and EDTA (10 mm final concentration). DNA was extracted by proteinase K digestion (0.1 or 0.2 mg/ml) at 56 °C overnight, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. 10 μg of DNA were digested to completion with the indicated restriction enzymes, electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C Extra, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by Southern blotting. Hybridization was performed with random-primed 32P-labeled probes at 65 °C in 5× SSC (0.6 m NaCl and 0.06 m sodium citrate (pH 7)), 1× Denhardt's solution, 20 mmNaPO4 (pH 6.7), and 10% dextran sulfate. Highest stringency washes consisted of 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. The genomic probes used for the DNase-I studies were a 582-bpBglII-ClaI fragment and a 441-bpSspI-SstI fragment. The −96/+598 DNA fragment was cloned from a cosmid that contained the human GATA-3 gene by BamHI-BstEII digestion, followed by electrophoresis and fragment purification. The −96/+44 DNA fragment was obtained by an XmnI digest of theBamHI-BstEII fragment, followed by purification of the BamHI-XmnI fragment. Mutants of the −96/+598 DNA fragment were obtained by double restriction digests of the −96/+598 DNA fragment, followed by fill in with Klenow polymerase and blunt-end ligation. The constructs used for orientation and position dependence of the 3′-activating element were obtained by cloning a RsaI-BstEII DNA fragment containing the 3′-activating element 5′ or 3′ from the −96/−44 DNA fragment. A human placental DNA library (CLONTECH) was screened with a 5′-probe obtained from a cosmid previously cloned, and a phage containing 12 kb of DNA 5′ from the human GATA-3 transcriptional initiation site was isolated. A 2.4-kb BamHI-BamHI DNA fragment containing HS I and HS II (−8300/−5900 fragment) was subcloned into pBSK, and the various constructs shown in this study were obtained by subsequent digests of the BamHI-BamHI DNA fragment. All point mutations were obtained by polymerase chain reaction and subsequent cloning. All the constructs were finally cloned 5′ from the CAT reporter gene using the pBL-CAT-3 vector (20Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). All these constructs were sequenced before use. Sequence analysis was performed using a TaqDyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) and an automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems Model 373A). ZEB cDNA was cloned by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides that encompass the ATG initiation codon and the TAA stop codon. The polymerase chain reaction product was sequenced and cloned into the pECE vector (21Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), where the inserted cDNA is driven by the SV40 promoter and enhancer. Human cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HeLa) or in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Jurkat and K562),l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). For transient transfection, 107 cells were transfected by electroporation (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser; 960 microfarads, 200–250 V) in a volume of 175–250 μl using the same molarity of reporter gene plasmids together with 2 μg of pRSV-Luc plasmid. pBluescript was added to bring the total amount of DNA to 10 μg. Cells lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection by the freeze-thaw procedure (22Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were used to determine transfection efficiency, and CAT assays were performed using amounts of extract normalized for transfection efficiency (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.M. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989: 9.6.13-9.6.14Google Scholar). The percentage of acetylation for each extract was determined by quantification of the14C-acetylated chloramphenicol on thin-layer chromatography plates using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Stable transfections were performed like transient transfections, except that the cells were electroporated with 20 μg of linearized plasmid together with 1 μg of plasmid containing the SV40 promoter-driven neomycin-phosphotransferase gene. After selection on G418, three independent pools of transfected cells were assayed for CAT activity. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa and Jurkat cell lines (24Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar), and DNA binding assays were performed essentially as described (25Hsu H.-L. Huang L. Tsou Tsan J. Funk W. Wright W.E. Hu J.-S. Kingston R.E. Baer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1256-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Poly(dI·dC) was used as nonspecific competitor, and in competition assays, 50 ng of unlabeled competitor DNA was preincubated with the nuclear extract for 5 min before the addition of the labeled probe (0.5 ng). The μE5 and MEF1m oligonucleotides used have been previously described (26Genetta T. Ruezinsky D. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6153-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and the 3′-CAGGTG E-box oligonucleotide is 5′-AGCTTTTTACCAGGTGGTCTCTA-3′. Antibodies against HEB and E2A proteins were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against human USF1 and USF2 were a kind gift from Dr. Michel Raymondjean (INSERM U.129, Paris, France), and anti-ZEB antiserum was a gift from Dr. H. Kondoh (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). Hypersensitivity of chromatin to DNase-I digestion has been used to identify regulatory elements of numerous genes (27Bonifer C. Vidal M. Grosveld F. Sippel A.E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 28Grosveld F. Blom von Assendelft G. Greaves D.R. Kollias G. Cell. 1987; 51: 975-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). To determine which regions of the human GATA-3 locus might be implicated in the regulation of its expression in T-cells, we mapped the DNase-I HS sites in 35 kb of human genomic DNA encompassing the human GATA-3 transcription unit in a T-cell line (Jurkat) that expresses human GATA-3 and in a non-hematopoietic cell line (HeLa) and an erythrocytic cell line (K562) that do not express human GATA-3. Fig. 1 A shows the mapping of DNase-I HS sites after EcoRV-BglII digestion and hybridization with a 5′-BglII-ClaI probe. In addition to the 12-kb germ line fragment, two fragments of 7 and 2.5 kb were observed exclusively in the Jurkat cell line, and a fragment of 1.1 kb was detected in the three cell lines studied. The 2.5-kb fragment results from DNase digestion around the transcriptional initiation site of the human GATA-3 gene; the 7-kb fragment located an HS site in intron 3; and the 1.1-kb fragment identified a region located 1.5 kb 5′ from the transcriptional initiation site of the human GATA-3 gene. Using SalI digestion and a 3′-SspI-SstI probe, we then mapped two HS sites, located between exons 5 and 6 and found only in Jurkat T-cells (Fig.1 B). Using other digests, we finally mapped the seven HS sites that are shown in Fig. 1 C. Interestingly, the 5′-HS sites were found in all the cell lines tested, whereas the 3′-HS sites were found only in the Jurkat cell line. To look for any regulatory function of the HS sites previously mapped, we first delimited the human GATA-3minimal promoter. A segment of the human GATA-3 gene encompassing the presumptive minimal promoter, from nucleotides −96 to +44, was first studied (Fig.2 A). After transient transfection into a T-cell line (Jurkat) and into two cell lines that do not express human GATA-3 (HeLa and K562), we detected a weak transcriptional activity that did not display any cell-type specificity (Fig. 2 A). By primer extension, we showed that the transfected constructs were correctly initiated in the three cell lines (data not shown). The addition of 5′-sequence (up to −2500) did not change the transcriptional activity of the −96/+44 DNA fragment or bring any T-cell specificity to the constructs used (data not shown). However, the addition of 554 nucleotides located 3′ from the −94/+44 DNA fragment resulted in a 6–10-fold enhancement of transcriptional activity in the three cell lines (Fig. 2 A). This 554-nucleotide fragment contained both the first exon and most of the first intron of the human GATA-3 gene and, together with the −96/+44 DNA fragment, defined the −96/+598 human GATA-3minimal promoter. To delimit the regions involved in the activity of this promoter, we subjected this fragment to 3′-deletion analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 B, this analysis defined a 123-bp DNA fragment, located at the end of the first intron, as necessary for efficient activity of the human GATA-3 promoter. We then looked for any position dependence of this 3′-element. A 390-bp DNA fragment containing the human GATA-3 promoter 3′-element was cloned in both orientations 5′ or 3′ from the −96/+44 DNA fragment (Fig. 2 C). Only the constructs that contained the 390-bp DNA fragment 3′ from the −96/+44 DNA fragment were transcriptionally active in the three cell lines tested, indicating that the 3′-element acted as a strong transcriptional activator in a position-dependent manner and with no cell-type specificity. All the DNA fragments that encompassed the different HS sites mapped in the humanGATA-3 locus were cloned 5′ from the −96/+598 humanGATA-3 promoter, and the resulting constructs were stably transfected into Jurkat, K562, and HeLa cell lines. None of the 3′-T-cell-specific HS sites provided any specificity to the −96/+598 human GATA-3 promoter (data not shown), and thus, we focused our study on the 5′-region of the human GATA-3 gene. Starting from a construct that contained all the 5′-HS sites, we performed deletion analysis to study, by stable transfections, the three 5′-HS sites (Fig. 3). The 8.3-kb DNA fragment that contained all the 5′-HS sites displayed a T-cell specificity. The 6.5-kb DNA fragment containing only HS II and HS III showed a higher transcriptional activity in Jurkat cells than in HeLa or K562 cells, but the difference between these three cell lines was smaller than that observed with the 8.3-kb DNA fragment, as the transcriptional activity of this 6.5-kb DNA fragment was present in HeLa and K562 cells (Fig. 3). The 3-kb DNA fragment that contained only HS III displayed no cell-type specificity and was as active as the human GATA-3 minimal promoter in all three cell lines (Fig.3). To demonstrate that HS I and HS II were sufficient for T-cell specificity, a 2.1-kb DNA fragment that contained these two HS sites was cloned 5′ from the human GATA-3 minimal promoter, and this construct was stably transfected into Jurkat, K562, and HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 3, this 2.1-kb DNA fragment conferred T-cell specificity to the human GATA-3 minimal promoter, indicating that HS I and HS II were necessary and sufficient for T-cell specificity of the human GATA-3 minimal promoter in the assay we used. To characterize the function of HS I and HS II, a 966-bp DNA fragment (−8025 to −7059) containing only HS I was cloned 5′ from the humanGATA-3 promoter, and the resulting construct was stably transfected into HeLa, K562, and Jurkat cells. This fragment repressed human GATA-3 promoter activity in the HeLa and K562 cell lines, but not in the Jurkat T-cell line. The repression level was identical to the one obtained with the HS I-HS II DNA fragment (Fig.4), and interestingly, this silencer did not reduce the transcriptional activity of the human GATA-3minimal promoter in T-cells (data not shown). The orientation dependence of this negative regulatory element was tested by inserting the 966-bp DNA fragment in reverse orientation 5′ from the humanGATA-3 promoter, and indeed, the transcriptional inhibition obtained with this construct was the same, indicating that this silencer was orientation-independent (Fig. 4). We then cloned a 1.1-kb DNA fragment (−7059 to −5900) containing only HS II 5′ from the human GATA-3 minimal promoter and stably transfected the resulting construct into HeLa, K562, and Jurkat cells. We obtained a 5–6-fold decrease in the transcriptional repression in HeLa and K562 cells, and we got a 2–3-fold increase in the transcriptional activity of the human GATA-3 promoter in Jurkat cells (Fig. 4). These results indicate that HS I contains a major regulatory element that confers T-cell specificity to the human GATA-3 minimal promoter. We thus performed a detailed analysis of this silencer. 5′- and 3′-deletion analysis of this silencer revealed twocis-acting elements that were necessary for efficient silencing of the human GATA-3 promoter activity. The 5′-element was located between −7828 and −7746, and the 3′-element was located between −7197 and −7121 (Fig.5). This analysis was done by stable transfection, and we next examined whether these elements were sufficient for efficient repression. We cloned the various deleted regions 5′ from the human GATA-3 minimal promoter and transfected these constructs into HeLa or Jurkat cells, but never obtained any efficient repression of the human GATA-3promoter (data not shown), suggesting that the silencer identified requires multiple elements to be functional. The sequence of the 707-bp DNA fragment (−7828 to −7121) containing HS I is shown in Fig.6. The 3′-DNA fragment necessary for efficient repression in non-T-cells contained a YY1-binding site adjacent to a CAGGTG E-box and a TCCTCCT motif already shown to be required for neuronal expression of the zebrafish gata-2gene (29Meng A. Tang H. Ong B.A. Farrell M.J. Lin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6267-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and the 5′-DNA fragment characterized also contained a CAGGTG E-box. The presence of this same motif in the 5′- and 3′-regions of the silencer prompted us to analyze its function.Figure 6Sequence of the human GATA-3gene silencer. The −7828/−7121 DNA fragment containing the human GATA-3 gene silencer was sequenced on both strands. The potential DNA-binding sites present in the 5′- and 3′-elements defined by the deletion analysis of the HS I silencer are indicated inboldface letters. The nucleotide sequence has been submitted to the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank with accession number AJ 131811.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As the −7828/−7121 DNA fragment has the same transcriptional activity as the initial −8025/−7059 repressor, the role of the two CAGGTG E-boxes in HS I silencing activity was tested in this DNA fragment beginning with the 3′-region. Mutations that deleted or disrupted the 3′-CAGGTG E-box were shown by gel-shift analysis to prevent binding of any protein (data not shown), and stable transfections of the resulting constructs showed that they were completely unable to silence the human GATA-3 promoter activity in non-T-cells and did not modify this promoter activity in T-cells (Fig. 7 A). A similar mutation was performed on the 5′-CAGGTG E-box, and stable transfections of the mutated silencer showed that it could not repress the humanGATA-3 promoter activity in non-T-cells (Fig.7 B). These results indicate that the HS I silencing activity needs these two CAGGTG E-boxes. To characterize the proteins that can bind the 3′-CAGGTG E-box, we first performed gel-shift analysis using Jurkat or HeLa nuclear extract. As shown in Fig. 8 A, two complexes (C1 and C2) were obtained with Jurkat or HeLa nuclear extract, whereas a third complex (C3) was obtained only with Jurkat nuclear extract. To define the proteins present in these three complexes, we first used competition with oligonucleotides known to bind E2A or related proteins (μE5 oligonucleotide) or the ubiquitous ZEB repressor (MEF1m oligonucleotide) (26Genetta T. Ruezinsky D. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6153-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These experiments showed that the C1 complex had the same migration as a ZEB complex (Fig.8 B, lanes 4 and 7) and that the 3′-CAGGTG E-box oligonucleotide efficiently competed the ZEB binding on the MEF1m oligonucleotide (lanes 7 and8). The C3 complex migrated like the E2A complex bound on the μE5 oligonucleotide (Fig. 8 B, lanes 3 and 4), and the 3′-CAGGTG E-box and the μE5 oligonucleotides efficiently competed each other (lanes 2 and 3 and lanes 4 and6, respectively). To characterize the proteins present in the C1, C2, and C3 complexes, we used antibodies against ZEB, E2A, HEB, USF1, and USF2 for supershift assays. As shown in Fig. 8 C, the addition of anti-ZEB antibodies supershifted the C1 complex, whereas the addition of control serum had no effect on this complex (compare lanes 1 and2). Increasing amounts of anti-ZEB antibodies completely abolished the formation of the C1 complex, but also abolished the supershift shown in Fig. 8 C (lane 2) (data not shown). To identify the proteins present in this C3 complex, antibodies against E2A or HEB protein were used for supershift assays, and both antibodies completely supershifted the C3 complex, indicating that this complex contains a heterodimer of HEB and E2A proteins (Fig.8 D, lanes 2 and 3). Finally, antibodies against human USF1 or USF2 basic helix-loop-helix protein showed that the C2 complex contained homo- and heterodimers consisting of these two proteins (Fig. 8 E, lanes 2–4). In conclusion, the 3′-CAGGTG E-box oligonucleotide could bind ZEB and USF proteins in HeLa cells, whereas it bound ZEB, USF, and an E2A/HEB heterodimer in Jurkat T-cells. To demonstrate that ZEB was involved in human GATA-3 gene repression, we cotransfected a ZEB expression vector together with the human GATA-3 promoter linked to the −7828/−7121 repressor or to the mutated −7828/−7121 fragment that could not bind ZEB (mutant CAGGTG → CAGGCC described in Fig. 7 A). Overexpression of ZEB resulted in significantly reduced transcriptional activity of the −7828/−7121 construct in Jurkat T-cells (65% repression), whereas the mutated version of this DNA fragment was not sensible to this ZEB overexpression (Fig.9 A). These results indicate that ZEB is involved in the repression obtained with the −7828/−7121 DNA fragment through the 3′-CAGGTG E-box. We then performed several point mutations of the 3′-CAGGTG E-box, which can bind ZEB, E2A/HEB, and USF proteins. We transformed this 3′-E-box to a MEF1m sequence, i.e. a sequence that can weakly bind ZEB and neither E2A/HEB nor USF (Fig. 8 B, lane 7) (26Genetta T. Ruezinsky D. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6153-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar); to the sequence AGTTCAGGTGTGTT located at −361 in the human α4-integrin promoter and shown to bind only ZEB and USF proteins (30Postigo A.A. Sheppard A.M. Mucenski M.L. Dean D.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3924-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 31Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3935-3943Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); or to a κE2 sequence known to bind only ZEB and E2A/HEB proteins (32Sekido R. Murai K. Funahashi J.I. Kamachi Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nabeshima Y.I. Kondoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5692-5700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stable transfections of the resulting constructs in HeLa and Jurkat T-cells showed that the mutated κE2 sequence had the same effect as the wild type 3′-E-box, whereas the MEF1m or −361 sequence induced a repression of the human GATA-3 promoter in Jurkat T-cells (Fig. 9 B). These results indicate that the E2A/HEB heterodimer, but not the USF proteins, can relieve the repression mediated by ZEB on the 3′-E-box. Among the GATA transcription factors, GATA-3 displays a peculiar expression, as it is expressed in many different tissues (i.e. central and peripheral nervous systems and embryonic liver, kidney, and adrenal medulla) during development and only in the placenta, the central nervous system, very immature hematopoietic cells, and T-cells in the adult. To define regulatory sequences that control GATA-3 gene expression in T-cells, we first investigated the DNase-I hypersensitivity of the humanGATA-3 gene as DNase-I hypersensitivity has been associated with a wide range of cis-regulatory sequences and is usually indicative of protein-DNA interactions. Although no T-cell-specific HS site was found 5′ from the human GATA-3 gene initiation site, three T-cell-specific HS sites were discovered in the 3′-direction. We assayed these different T-cell-specific HS sites, linked to the endogenous or to a heterologous promoter, in both transient and stable transfections, but we were unable to show any function of these HS sites in transcriptional regulation. These results indicate a possible requirement for other regulatory elements or that the assays we used could not detect the function of these DNase-I HS sites. We first determined the cis-acting sequences, located near the transcriptional initiation site and involved in the humanGATA-3 gene activation. We did not find any sequence involved in the T-cell-specific activity of the human GATA-3gene, but mapped a sequence, located in the first intron between +475 and +598, required for high transcriptional activity. This sequence did not display classical enhancer activity, as it functioned, in both sense and antisense orientations, only when located 3′ from theGATA-3 minimal promoter. Similar results have been obtained using the mouse GATA-3 promoter (14George K.M. Leonard M.W. Roth M.E. Lieuw K. Kioussis D. Grosveld F. Engel J.D. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 2673-2686PubMed Google Scholar), and comparison of the mouse and human sequences located at the end of the first intron showed little homology except at their 3′-ends, where the sequence 5′-CAGGTCTC(C/T)-3′ lies (in the human and murine introns) one base 5′ from the 3′-splicing sequence. We then studied the effects of the 5′-HS sites on the transcriptional activity of the human GATA-3 promoter and found that a DNA fragment, located between −8025 and −5900, could confer T-cell specificity to the human GATA-3 promoter. This T-cell specificity is mainly mediated by a strong silencer active in non-T-cells and located between −7828 and −7121. Previous studies have shown an extinction of the GATA-3 gene in both murine and human erythroid × T-cell hybrids (16Murrell A.M. Green A.R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 631-639PubMed Google Scholar) and during the commitment of Th0-like cells to Th1 effector cells (33Zheng W.-P. Flavell R.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 587-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). These extinctions could be direct silencing or loss of positive regulators, and our data strongly support the first hypothesis. Transcriptional regulation by negative regulatory elements is now well documented, and studies using transgenic mice or transfection assays have identified silencers of transcription in numerous tissues and developmentally specific genes (34Saksela K. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3698-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 35Goraya T.Y. Kessler S.P. Kumar R.S. Douglas J. Sen G.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1194-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 36Winoto A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 59: 649-655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 37Liu Z.Y. Chin K. Noguchi C.T. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The position of silencers, like the position of enhancers, varies depending on the gene studied and can be located adjacent to or far away from the regulated promoter (38Vitale M. Di Marzo R. Calzolari R. Acuto S. O'Neill D. Bank A. Maggio A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 39Markowitz A.J. Wu G.D. Bafer A. Cui Z. Chen C.L. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G925-G939PubMed Google Scholar). The humanGATA-3 silencer was found 7 kb 5′ from the promoter and thus belongs to the second type of silencer. The molecular mechanisms that mediate transcriptional silencing are not completely understood, but several DNA-binding proteins, like COUP-TF or YY1 (40Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 41Galvin K.M. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), seem clearly implicated in silencing. Deletion and point mutation analyses of the human GATA-3 silencer revealed two CAGGTG E-boxes that are necessary but not sufficient for efficient silencing. Point mutation that destroyed the 5′-CAGGTG E-box resulted in an absence of silencing, indicating the importance of this DNA-binding motif in humanGATA-3 gene regulation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays done with this E-box as a probe revealed two specific complexes present in Jurkat, HeLa, and K562 cells (data not shown). These complexes did not contain ZEB, USF, or E2A protein, as no supershift could be obtained with antisera against all members of the USF, E2A, and ZEB proteins (data not shown). Further characterizations of these complexes are now needed to understand this 5′-CAGGTG E-box function. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays done with the 3′-CAGGTG E-box revealed three specific complexes, two present in T- and non-T-cells (C1 and C2) and one present only in T-cells (C3). These three complexes contained the ubiquitous repressor ZEB (C1), the USF basic helix-loop-helix proteins (C2), and an E2A/HEB heterodimer (C3). Overexpression of ZEB in T-cells showed that ZEB acted as a repressor, and several point mutations indicated that E2A and HEB, but not USF proteins, were able to relieve ZEB repression in T-cells. ZEB and E2A/HEB have been shown to regulate genes during hematopoiesis (26Genetta T. Ruezinsky D. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6153-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 42Zhuang Y. Cheng P. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), but no competition between these proteins for DNA binding has yet been reported. ZEB is an active transcriptional repressor that has been shown to regulate both muscle differentiation and α4-integrin gene expression during hematopoiesis (30Postigo A.A. Sheppard A.M. Mucenski M.L. Dean D.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3924-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,31Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3935-3943Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ZEB seems to compete with muscle-specific basic helix-loop-helix proteins for the regulation of muscle differentiation (31Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3935-3943Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), whereas it impairs the myb-ets synergy during hematopoiesis (30Postigo A.A. Sheppard A.M. Mucenski M.L. Dean D.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3924-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As for human GATA-3 gene regulation, our results suggest that ZEB represses the humanGATA-3 promoter activity and that the E2A/HEB heterodimer can displace ZEB in T-cells. This E2A/HEB heterodimer also positively regulates CD4 gene expression by regulating the activity of its enhancer (43Sawada S. Littman D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5620-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and thus, E2A/HEB heterodimers seem to regulate early and late genes activated during T-cell differentiation. Interestingly, HEB or E2A mutant homozygous mice seem to have a developmental delay in the transition from the double-negative stage to the double-positive stage (42Zhuang Y. Cheng P. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and studies on chimeras indicated that the differentiation of GATA-3 −/− T-cells is also blocked at the double-negative stage of development (6Ting C.-N. Olson M.C. Barton K.P. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1996; 384: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). These results, together with the data presented in this paper, strengthen the link between HEB and E2A proteins and GATA-3 gene regulation. Furthermore, as E2A, HEB, and ZEB proteins are not T-cell-specific, their relative amounts might switch on or switch off the human GATA-3 gene, and thus, these non-lineage-specific proteins might be involved in T-lymphoid determination. We have previously shown that a cosmid that contains the humanGATA-3 transcription unit extended by 4 kb of 3′-flanking sequence and 3 kb of 5′-flanking sequence is sufficient for directing T-cell expression (18Labastie M.-N. Bories D. Chabret C. Grégoire J.-M. Chrétien S. Roméo P.-H. Genomics. 1994; 21: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This cosmid does not contain the silencer described in this paper, and thus, the human GATA-3 gene seems to be under the control of discrete regulatory elements that can enhance and/or silence the transcriptional activity of a minimal promoter. Furthermore, a recent publication has characterized an enhancer sequence that regulates mouse GATA-3 gene expression in the brachial arch (44Lieuw K.H. Li G.-l. Zhou Y. Grosveld F. Engel J.D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 188: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This enhancer, located between nucleotides −2832 and −2642, does not confer any T-cell specificity, and thus, the GATA-3 gene seems to be regulated by discrete regulatory elements required for its complex expression pattern. Such a modular cis-regulatory organization has been described for many genes encoding transcription factors in Drosophila (15Arnone M.I. Davidson E.H. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 1851-1864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and shows the actual complexity of cis-regulatory elements that regulate these genes.

https://openalex.org/W2095329828,"IRF-1-deficient mice show a striking defect in the development of T helper 1 (Th1) cells. In the present report, we investigate the expression of IRF-1 during differentiation of human T helper cells. No significant differences of IRF-1 mRNA expression were found in established Th1 and Th2 cells; however, interleukin 12 (IL-12) induced a strong up-regulation of IRF-1 transcripts in Th1 but not in Th2 cells. We demonstrate that IL-12-induced up-regulation of IRF-1 is mediated by signal transducer and activator of transcription-4, which binds to the interferon (IFN)-γ-activated sequence present in the promoter of the IRF-1 gene. Strong IL-12-dependent activation of a reporter gene construct containing the IRF-1 IFN-γ-activated sequence element provides further evidence for the key role of signal transducer and activator of transcription-4 in the IL-12-induced up-regulation of IRF-1 transcripts in T cells. IRF-1 expression was strongly induced after stimulation of naive CD4+ T cells via the T cell receptor, irrespective of the cytokines present at priming, indicating that this transcription factor does not play a major role in initiating a Th1-specific transcriptional cascade in differentiating helper T cells. However, our finding that IRF-1 is a target gene of IL-12 suggests that some of the IL-12-induced effector functions of Th1 cells may be mediated by IRF-1.

More recently, additional transcription factors have been studied and characterized for their role in the Th2-specific expression of the IL-4 gene. The nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) has been shown to regulate IL-4 expression in Th2 cells through a cooperative binding with AP-1 family members (27Rooney J.W. Hoey T. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 1995; 2: 473-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). NF-AT functions are potentiated by the transcription factor NIP45 (for NF-ATp interacting protein) (28Hodge M.R. Chun H.J. Rengarajan J. Alt A. Lieberson R. Glimcher L.H. Science. 1996; 274: 1903-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The proto-oncogene c-maf is expressed in Th2 clones but not in Th1 clones and has also been identified as a potent transactivator of the IL-4 gene (29Ho I.-C. Hodge M.R. Rooney J.W. Glimcher L.H. Cell. 1996; 85: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that the transcription factor GATA-3 is expressed at a high level in naive CD4+ T cells and differentiating and effector Th2 cells, whereas its expression is suppressed in Th1 cells (30Zheng W.-p. Flavell R.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 587-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar). Less is known about the regulation of the IFN-γ gene in Th1 cells that appears to involve the interaction of numerous transcription factors, including NF-kB and NF-AT (31Sica A. Dorman L. Vigiano V. Cippitelli M. Ghosh P. Rice N. Young H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30412-30420Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), or the cooperative binding of STAT-4 dimers (32Xu X. Sun Y.-L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that transcription factors belonging to the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family are necessary for Th1 development (33Taki S. Sato T. Ogasawara K. Fukuda T.

Mittrücker H.-W. Duncan G.-S. Bischoff S. Röllinghof M. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 6: 681-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The IRF family includes at least 10 members: IRF-1, IRF-2, IRF-3, ISGF3γ/p48, ICSBP, Pip/ICSAT/IRF-4, IRF-5, IRF-6, IRF-7, and viral IRF, recently identified in the genome of HHV-8 (35Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). IRF expression is either constitutive and/or induced upon treatment with interferons (IFNs) or other cytokines or in response to viral infection. Moreover, some IRFs are specific for hematopoietic cells (ICSBP and IRF-4), whereas others are expressed in multiple tissues and cell lines. However, all members of this family share significant homology in the amino-terminal 115 amino acids, which make up the DNA binding domain that mediates the interaction with a specific consensus IRF binding sequence motif, termed IRF-E (36Tanaka N. Kawakami T. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Proteins of the IRF family have been shown to be involved in the regulation of the pleiotropic activities elicited by IFNs and other cytokines, including modulation of the immune response, inflammation, hematopoiesis, cell proliferation, and differentiation (37Taniguchi T. Lamphier M.S. Tanaka N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 38Taniguchi T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Studies of IRF-1-deficient mice have revealed that this factor is implicated in the regulation of several immune processes, such as T-cell selection and maturation (39Penninger J.M. Sirard C.

The compromised Th1 differentiation was associated with defects in the expression of p40 subunit of IL-12 by cells of myeloid origin (33Taki S. Sato T. Ogasawara K. Fukuda T. Sato M. Hida S.

Indeed, a potential IRF-1-responsive element was found in the promoter region of the IL-12 p40 gene (44Murphy T.L. Cleveland M.G. Kulesza P. Magram J. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5258-5267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that IRF-1 may be a master gene, directly or indirectly controlling Th1 responses at multiple stages. In the present report, we have analyzed the expression of IRF-1 in developing human Th1 and Th2 cells and its regulation in response to cytokines in polarized Th1 and Th2 cells. IRF-1 transcripts were strongly induced after stimulation of naive CD4+ T cells via the T cell receptor, irrespective of the cytokines present at priming, and no differences in IRF-1 mRNA expression were detectable in established Th1 and Th2 cells. Interestingly, IL-12 treatment up-regulated IRF-1 transcripts only in established Th1 cells. This up-regulation does not depend on de novo protein synthesis. IL-12 induced binding of STAT-4 to the IFN-γ-activated sequence (GAS) of the IRF-1 gene promoter in Th1 cells but not in Th2 cells. Strong IL-12-dependent activation of a reporter gene construct containing the IRF-1 GAS element further emphasizes the key role of STAT-4 for IL-12-induced up-regulation of IRF-1 transcripts in T cells. Human neonatal leukocytes were isolated from freshly collected, heparinized, neonatal blood by Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) density gradient centrifugation. CD8+ T cells were removed by positive selection with anti-CD8 microbeads and magnetic-activated cell sorting according to a protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Cells were stimulated with 2 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (Wellcome, Beckenham, United Kingdom) in the presence of 2.5 ng/ml IL-12 (Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, NJ) and 200 ng/ml neutralizing anti-IL-4 antibodies (18500D, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for Th1 cultures or 1 ng/ml IL-4 (Pharmingen) and 2 μg/ml neutralizing anti-IL-12 antibodies 17F7 and 20C2 (kindly provided by M. Gately, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.) for Th2 cultures. Cells were washed on day 3 and expanded in complete RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% FetalClone I (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin) containing 100 units/ml IL-2 (Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.). The cells were treated with IL-12 (2.5 ng/ml) or IFN-α (1000 units/ml) followed by the extraction of total RNA. To determine whether de novo protein synthesis is required for IL-12-induced up-regulation of IRF-1 transcripts, cells were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Sigma, 10 μg/ml) 45 min prior to the addition of IL-12 (2.5 ng/ml). RNA was extracted 16 h after the addition of IL-12. CD4+/CD45RO− T cells were purified from cord blood leukocytes by negative selection using a CD4+ T cell isolation kit and CD45RO microbeads according to a protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Miltenyi Biotec). The purity of the CD4+/CD45RO− T cells using this procedure was typically >98% as determined by flow cytometry. Purified naive T cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 mAb (TR66 (46Lanzavecchia A. Scheidegger D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar)) in the absence of exogenously added cytokines, in the presence of IL-12 (2.5 ng/ml) and neutralizing anti-IL-4 mAb (200 ng/ml), or in the presence of IL-4 (1 ng/ml). Single cell analysis of IFN-γ and IL-4 production was performed as described previously (47Panina-Bordignon P. Mazzeo D. Di Lucia P. D'Ambrosio D. Lang R. Fabbri L. Self C. Sinigaglia F. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1513-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Briefly, T cell lines were collected 7 days after priming and washed, and 106 cells were restimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 ng/ml) (Sigma) and ionomycin (1 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 2 h at 37 °C in complete medium. Brefeldin A (10 μg/ml) (Sigma) was added to the cultures and the cultures were incubated for an additional 2 h. Then, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with saponin. Fixed cells were stained with anti-human IFN-γ-FITC (Pharmingen) and anti-human IL-4-PE (Pharmingen) following a protocol provided by the manufacturer and analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). To obtain the pBS IRF-1 construct, the plasmid pUC IRF-1 (a generous gift of T. Taniguchi) was digested with SmaI, and the 400-base pair-long fragment was cloned into the same sites of pBluescript/KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To generate the 32P-labeled 280-base pair-long antisense IRF-1 RNA probe, the plasmid pBS IRF-1 was linearized withEcoRI and transcribed by T7 polymerase. A 327-base pair DNA fragment encompassing the cytoplasmic region of the human IL-12Rβ2 subunit was subcloned in pGEM 3Z (21Rogge L. Barberis-Maino L. Biffi M. Passini N. Presky D.H. Gubler U. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). This construct was linearized with EcoRI, and radiolabeled antisense transcripts were synthesized with SP6 polymerase and a commercial kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). RNA was extracted from T cell lines using Ultraspec total RNA extraction reagent (Biotecx Laboratories Inc., Houston, TX). The antisense RNA probes were hybridized to 5 μg of total RNA, and ribonuclease protection assays were performed with a commercial kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) according to the company's protocol. Products were resolved on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and the protected fragments were visualized by autoradiography. The radioactivity present in the protected fragments was also quantitated using a MolecularImager (Bio-Rad). An 18 S RNA probe was used as a control for equal RNA loading. Jurkat cells were co-transfected with the following constructs: (i) pBOS-IL-12Rβ1, pBOS-IL-12Rβ2 (48Presky D.H. Yang H. Minetti L.J. Chua A.O. Nabavi N. Wu C.-Y. Gately M.K. Gubler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14002-14007Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. U. Gubler, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.) and pBOS-Stat4 (kindly provided by Dr. R. Chizzonite, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.), (ii) pIRF-luc, a luciferase reporter plasmid containing three copies of an oligonucleotide representing the GAS of the IRF-1 promoter (5′-CTGATTTCCCCGAAATGAC-3′) inserted upstream of the SV40 promoter in pGL3-promoter (Promega), and (iii) pCMV-β-gal, a mammalian expression vector containing the β-galactosidase gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. 30 μg of plasmid DNA (7 μg each of pIRF-luc, pBOS-IL-12Rβ1, pBOS-IL-12Rβ2, and pBOS-Stat4 and 2 μg of pCMV-β-gal) were used to electroporate 8 × 106cells in 400 μl of RPMI medium with a 0.4-cm gap electroporation cuvette at 960 microfarads and 300 V using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). Four ml of complete medium were added immediately after transfection, and the cells were seeded in 2 wells of a 24-well plate. Four h after transfection, 4 ng/ml IL-12 was added to half of the cultures, and the cells were incubated for additional 20 h. Luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase reporter gene assay (Boehringer Mannheim), and β-galactosidase activity was determined with the β-galactosidase reporter gene assay (Boehringer Mannheim). Both activities were measured in a LB 9507 Lumat luminometer (EG & G Berthold, Milano, Italy). Luciferase activities were normalized using β-galactosidase activity. For gel shift assays, polarized human Th1 and Th2 cells were harvested 6 days after priming, washed, and resuspended in complete medium. 107 cells were incubated 30 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of complete medium with or without IL-12 (2.5 ng/ml) for 1 h or IFN-α (1000 units/ml), IFN-γ (1000 units/ml), or IL-4 (1 ng/ml) for 15 min. The cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 20 μl of ice cold whole cell extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9; 300 mm NaCl; 10% glycerol; 0.5% Nonidet P-40; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 0.1 mm EDTA and EGTA; 10 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and NaF; 1 mm sodium orthovanadate; and Pefabloc SC (Boehringer Mannheim)). The lysate was incubated 30 min on a shaker at 4 °C, and insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation (13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min). After addition of 1 volume of a solution containing 20 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, and 20% glycerol, the lysate was stored at −80 °C. For gel shift analysis, a double-stranded oligonucleotide with the GAS from the human IRF-1 gene promoter (5′-CCCCTGATTTCCCCGAAATGACCCC-3′) (49Harada H. Takahashi E.-I. Itoh S. Harada K. Hori T.-A. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1500-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase according to standard protocols. Five μg of total cell extract were incubated with labeled probes (2–3 × 104 cpm) for 20 min at room temperature in 20 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). The reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis in a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. The gels were then dried and exposed at −80 °C for autoradiography. For supershift analysis, total cell extracts (5 μg) were incubated with 3 μg of anti-STAT-1, anti-STAT-3, anti-STAT-4, and an unrelated control antibody (SantaCruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) prior to the addition of the radiolabeled IRF-1 GAS oligonucleotide. Recent reports have demonstrated that IRF-1-deficient mice lack the capacity to develop a Th1 response (33Taki S. Sato T. Ogasawara K. Fukuda T. Sato M. Hida S. Suzuki G. Mitsuyama M. Shin E.-H.

To study whether the transcription factor IRF-1 may also play a role in human T helper cell development, we have analyzed expression of IRF-1 transcripts in human Th1 and Th2 cells generated from cord blood (21Rogge L. Barberis-Maino L. Biffi M. Passini N. Presky D.H. Gubler U. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 50Rogge L. D'Ambrosio D. Biffi M. Penna G. Minetti L.J. Presky D.H. Adorini L. Sinigaglia F. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6567-6574PubMed Google Scholar). The T helper phenotype has been determined by the analysis of intracellular IFN-γ and IL-4 production after restimulation of T cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin (Fig. 1). We examined the expression of IRF-1 transcripts in Th1 and Th2 cells treated with or without IL-12 or IFN-α by RNase protection assays. We could not detect significant differences of the IRF-1 mRNA levels in human Th1 and Th2 cells 2 weeks after priming (Fig.2 A, lanes 1 and 7). Interestingly, we found that IRF-1 expression is clearly induced by IL-12 in Th1 but not in Th2 cells (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2, 3, 8,and 9). The IL-12-induced up-regulation of IRF-1 transcripts is not blocked by cycloheximide indicating that de novoprotein synthesis is not required for IL-12 action (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). Treatment of Th1 cells with cycloheximide in the absence of IL-12 does not result in an increased IRF-1 mRNA expression (data not shown). IFN-α induced IRF-1 transcripts in both T helper subsets (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5, 6, 10, and 11). A quantitative analysis of the results is shown in Fig. 2 B. Treating Th1 cells for 4 h with IL-12 resulted in a 5-fold up-regulation of IRF-1 transcripts; a 9-fold up-regulation was detected after 16 h. Consistent with previously published data (51Groux H. Sornasse T. Cottrez F. de Vries J.E. Coffman R.L. Roncarolo M.-G. Yssel H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5627-5631PubMed Google Scholar), we observed that IFN-γ up-regulates IRF-1 in human Th2 but not Th1 cells (data not shown). These results demonstrate that IRF-1 is a target gene of IL-12 in human Th1 cells. To analyze whether the IL-12-induced expression of IRF-1 is mediated by a specific STAT protein, we performed gel-shift experiments using a specific oligonucleotide corresponding to the GAS within the IRF-1 promoter (49Harada H. Takahashi E.-I. Itoh S. Harada K. Hori T.-A. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1500-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 52Sims S.H. Cha Y. Romine M.F. Gao P.-Q. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Total cell extracts were prepared from untreated Th1 and Th2 cells or from cells incubated with IL-12, IFN-α, IFN-γ, and IL-4 and were used in gel-shift experiments shown in Fig.3. Consistent with our previous findings (21Rogge L. Barberis-Maino L. Biffi M. Passini N. Presky D.H. Gubler U. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) and those of other laboratories (19Szabo S.J. Jacobson N.G. Dighe A.S. Gubler U. Murphy K.M.

IFN-α strongly induced two STAT complexes with different electrophoretic mobility both in Th1 and Th2 cells, whereas only Th2 cells were sensitive to IFN-γ. The activation of a STAT molecule by IFN-γ in Th2 but not in Th1 cells correlates with the selective expression of the IFN-γ receptor β chain on Th2 cells (51Groux H. Sornasse T.

In order to define which STAT molecules bind to the IRF-1 GAS element following IL-12 treatment, we performed supershift assays using specific antibodies against STAT proteins. As shown in Fig.4, anti-STAT-1 antibodies supershifted the fast migrating complex, whereas the anti-STAT-4 antibodies abrogated the slow migrating complex induced by IFN-α both in Th1 and Th2 cells. These findings are consistent with the previously described observation that IFN-α activates STAT-4 in human mitogen-activated lymphoblasts and in human Th1 and Th2 cells (50Rogge L. D'Ambrosio D.

The complex induced in IL-12-treated Th1 cells is abrogated with STAT-4 specific antibodies, confirming previously published results (17Bacon C.M. Petricoin III, E.F. Ortaldo J.R. Rees R.C.

https://openalex.org/W2110007918,"We have used recombinant von Willebrand factor (vWF) fragments to investigate the properties regulating A1 domain interaction with platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ibα. One fragment,rvWF508–704, represented the main portion of domain A1 (mature subunit residues 497–716) within the Cys509-Cys695 disulfide loop. The other,rvWF445–733, included the carboxyl-terminal region of domain D3, preceding A1, and corresponded to the proteolytic fragment originally identified as the GP Ibα-binding site (residues 449–728). Conformational changes were induced by reduction and alkylation of the Cys509-Cys695 bond and/or exposure to acidic pH. The cyclic rvWF445–733fragment exhibited the function of native vWF A1 domain. When immobilized onto a surface, it tethered platelets at shear rates up to 6,300 s−1 mediating low velocity translocation but not stable attachment; in solution, it exhibited limited interaction with GP Ibα. In contrast, fragments with perturbed conformation could not tether platelets at high shear rates but promoted stable adhesion at lower shear and bound tightly to GP Ibα. Only in the presence of the exogenous modulator, botrocetin, did cyclicrvWF445–733 mediate irreversible adhesion. Thus, conformational transitions in the vWF A1 domain may influence differentially the efficiency of bond formation with GP Ibα and the stability of binding.

Thus, conformational transitions in the vWF A1 domain may influence differentially the efficiency of bond formation with GP Ibα and the stability of binding. The A1 domain of von Willebrand factor (vWF) 1The abbreviations used are: vWF, von Willebrand factor; GP, platelet membrane glycoprotein; PPACK, d-phenyl alanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone dihydrochloride. immobilized onto exposed surfaces at sites of vascular injury initiates platelet adhesion and thrombus formation by interacting with the glycoprotein (GP) Ibα receptor (1Savage B.

This function is absolutely required for hemostasis in vessels such as arterioles or arterial capillaries, where rapid blood flow creates high shear rates (4Tangelder G.J. Slaaf D.W. Arts T.

The efficient interaction between GP Ibα and immobilized vWF is in apparent contrast to the lack of measurable binding of soluble plasma vWF (9Ruggeri Z.M. Ware J. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This observation has led to the generally accepted concept that conformational changes induced by surface adsorption regulate A1 domain function. Such an effect is thought to be caused in vivo by binding to collagen (10Baumgartner H.R. Tschopp T.B. Weiss H.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1977; 37: 17-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Pareti F.I.

McClintock R.A. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18172-18178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, surface-bound vWF may change shape under the influence of high shear stress, appearing as an elongated filament (20Siediecki C.A. Lestini B.J. Kottke-Marchant K. Eppell S.J. Wilson D.L. Marchant R.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 2939-2950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) rather than the loosely coiled structure predominantly seen under static conditions (21Fowler W.E. Fretto L.J. Hamilton K.K. Erickson H.P. McKee P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1491-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Extended multimers expose repeating functional sites, thus supporting multiple and more efficient adhesive interactions. Whether the change in molecular shape parallels specific conformational transitions in the A1 domain is unknown at present. Nevertheless, physicochemical modifications of the isolated A1 domain in solution can result in heightened interaction with GP Ibα (22Miyata S. Goto S. Federici A.B. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9046-9053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), in agreement with the notion that the native conformation is functionally unfavorable for receptor recognition but can be positively modulated. Consequently, it is generally assumed that the mechanisms leading to soluble vWF binding to GP Ibα reflect conditions that endow the A1 domain with the ability to initiate platelet adhesion. The physiologic characteristics of the interaction between surface-immobilized vWF A1 domain and GP Ibα have been well established under relevant flow conditions, with the demonstration that the process supports efficient tethering even at high shear rates. Platelets kept in contact with the surface by this ligand receptor pairing, however, are not irreversibly adherent; rather, they translocate constantly in the direction of flow albeit at a markedly reduced velocity relative to freely flowing platelets (1Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). This is sufficient to allow the formation of additional bonds, mediated by receptors other than GP Ibα, resulting in irreversible attachment and subsequent thrombus formation (3Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). We have now studied the GP Ibα-binding function of isolated recombinant A1 domain fragments of distinct conformation to evaluate how adhesive properties under flow correlate with the ability to bind to the receptor in solution. We found that an immobilized fragment with refolded conformation supported platelet tethering at high shear rates as efficiently as native vWF but had the lowest GP Ibα binding capacity in solution. In contrast, disruption of the tertiary structure (22Miyata S. Goto S. Federici A.B. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9046-9053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) resulted in a fragment that exhibited markedly enhanced binding to the receptor in solution, as judged by the ability to block its function, but defective support of platelet adhesion when immobilized onto a surface, particularly at high shear rates. Moreover, platelets became irreversibly attached to the fragment with disrupted conformation, rather than translocating through transient interactions as seen with native refolded fragments and multimeric vWF. After forming a complex with botrocetin, however, even A1 domain fragments with native conformation supported irreversible adhesion. Our findings indicate that the affinity regulation of vWF A1 domain binding to GP Ibα is a complex event since distinct and, in most instances, mutually exclusive structural characteristics control the ability to establish stable bonds or to initiate platelet tethering opposing elevated shear forces. Blood was collected from healthy and medication-free donors into polypropylene syringes containing as anticoagulant the α-thrombin inhibitord-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone dihydrochloride (PPACK) at the final concentration of 50 μm. All human subjects participating in these studies were aware of the experimental nature of the research and gave their informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. In order to eliminate potential effects of vWF and/or other plasma proteins in the experiments to be performed, washed blood cells suspended in perfusion buffer were prepared as follows. After adding the ADP scavenger apyrase and prostaglandin E1 to prevent platelet activation (10 units/ml and 10 μm, respectively, final concentration), blood was centrifuged at 2200 ×g for 15 min at room temperature (22–25 °C), and the resultant supernatant plasma was removed from the sedimented cells, including platelets and leukocytes on top of the erythrocyte cushion. After adding an equivalent volume of divalent cation-free Hepes/Tyrode buffer (10 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm NaHCO3, and 5 mm dextrose), pH 6.5, and mixing gently, the cell suspension was centrifuged again and the supernatant fluid was removed. This procedure was repeated three additional times, and after the final centrifugation the cells were suspended in divalent cation-free Hepes/Tyrode buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Final cell counts were within normal blood limits. In some experiments, platelet-depleted reconstituted blood was prepared by centrifuging the final cell suspension at 150 × g for 15 min, removing the resulting platelet-rich supernatant fluid, and replacing it with an equivalent volume of Hepes/Tyrode buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After counting the platelet number in both the whole cell suspension and the platelet-rich suspension, appropriate volumes of the latter were added into the former to obtain the target platelet count in the reconstituted blood, at the same time maintaining a normal hematocrit. In some experiments, whole blood containing PPACK as anticoagulant and prostaglandin E1 to prevent platelet activation (see above) was used instead of reconstituted blood. Native multimeric vWF was purified as previously reported (23Ruggeri Z.M. De Marco L. Gatti L. Bader R. Montgomery R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Two recombinant polypeptides coding for residues 508–704 and 445–733 of the mature vWF subunit, designatedrvWF508–704 andrvWF445–733, respectively, were expressed in host Escherichia coli BL21-DE3 using plasmids containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter (24Studier F.W.

To prevent formation of random aggregates during purification, five codons for Cys residues at positions 459, 462, 464, 471, and 474 in thervWF445–733 construct were replaced with Gly codons by site-directed mutagenesis. Expressed fragments were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and subjected either to reduction and alkylation (S-carboxyamidomethylation) or oxidization of the two Cys residues at positions 509 and 695, according to previously described procedures (22Miyata S. Goto S. Federici A.B. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9046-9053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Oxidization created the intramolecular disulfide bond that exists in native plasma vWF (28Marti T. Roesselet S. Titani K. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8099-8109Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant fragments were dialyzed against 2 mm acetic acid titrated to pH 3.5 with HCl and stored at −70 °C. As reported in detail elsewhere (22Miyata S. Goto S. Federici A.B. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9046-9053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), refolding of the oxidized recombinant fragments from the denatured state following exposure to acidic pH was achieved by slow dialysis with incremental pH increase in steps of 0.5 units each up to a final value of 7.0 for rvWF508–704 or 5.0 forrvWF445–733. This was obtained by dialyzing the samples at 4 °C against 2 mm acetic acid to which an appropriate amount of ammonium hydroxide was added every 8 h. Limiting the pH for refoldingrvWF445–733 was necessary because this fragment tended to form aggregates at pH values above 5.0. Reduced and alkylated rvWF508–704 was not refolded slowly, rather it was rapidly returned to neutral pH just before use by direct mixing with an appropriate buffer. Protein concentration was determined with the micro BCA assay (Pierce) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. This modulator of vWF A1 domain binding to platelet GP Ibα was purified from the venom of the snake Bothrops jararaca as previously reported in detail (29Fujimura Y. Titani K. Usami Y. Suzuki M.

The anti-vWF, anti-GP Ibα, and anti-αIIbβ3 (GP IIb-IIIa) monoclonal antibodies used in these studies have been characterized in previous publications. Pooled M13 monoclonal antibodies (31Zimmerman T.S. Dent J.A. Ruggeri Z.M. Nannini L.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 947-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 32Dent J.A. Berkowitz S.D.

Yoshioka A. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). LJ-Ib1 reacts with the amino-terminal 45-kDa domain of GP Ibα (36Handa M. Titani K.

A. 1987; 84: 5610-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and is a competitive inhibitor of vWF binding to this platelet receptor. LJ-CP8 is a complex specific antibody against the integrin αIIbβ3 and completely blocks binding of all ligands to this receptor (38Niiya K. Hodson E. Bader R. Byers-Ward V. Koziol J.A. Plow E.F. Ruggeri Z.M. Blood. 1987; 70: 475-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Savage B. Shattil S.J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11300-11306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All monoclonal antibodies were mouse IgG1 and were purified by protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatography according to published procedures (40Ey P.L. Prowse S.J. Jenkin C.R. Immunochemistry. 1978; 15: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of specific monoclonal antibodies on platelet interaction with immobilized native vWF or recombinant fragments was assessed by incubating purified IgG with reconstituted blood at room temperature for 20 min before perfusion through the chamber. This assay, an indirect measurement of the binding to platelet GP Ibα of recombinant vWF fragments containing the A1 domain, has been described in detail in a previous publication (22Miyata S. Goto S. Federici A.B. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9046-9053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Platelet-rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation of blood containing PPACK at 150 × gfor 15 min at room temperature and then diluted in 10 mmHepes buffer, pH 7.4, to give a final platelet count of 1 × 108/ml. In other experiments, washed cells were prepared as described above, and a plasma-free suspension of platelets was obtained by centrifuging the final cell suspension at 150 × gfor 15 min yielding a platelet-rich supernatant fluid that could be separated from the sedimented red and white blood cells. A constant volume (equal to or less than 12.5 μl) of various concentrations of each recombinant vWF fragment was added to the platelet suspension, followed by 10 μg/ml 125I-labeled LJ-Ib1 (a concentration of antibody resulting in half-maximum binding to platelets) diluted in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4. When indicated, botrocetin was also added to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml (0.17 μm); in this case, washed platelets (41Goto S. Salomon D.R. Ikeda Y. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23352-23361Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) were used rather than platelet-rich plasma. The final volume of each experimental mixture was 125 μl, and all indicated concentrations were final. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, platelets were separated by centrifugation though a layer of 20% sucrose, and bound radioactivity was measured in a γ-scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding was estimated by adding a 100-fold excess of nonlabeled LJ-Ib1, and the corresponding value (always less than 10% of the total counts added) was subtracted from all data points. Binding was expressed as percentage of that measured in a control mixture containing, instead of a recombinant vWF fragment, 12.5 μl of 10 mm ammonium acetate with the same pH. Recombinant vWF fragments and native vWF were diluted to a final concentration of 100–130 μg/ml with 2 mmammonium acetate, pH 7.0. A glass coverslip (number 1, 24 × 50 mm; Corning) was coated evenly with 200 μl of protein solution and placed in a humid environment at room temperature for 1 h. In some experiments, larger volumes (300–600 μl) of solutions with lower protein concentration were used. Just before assembly of the flow chamber, unbound protein was removed by rinsing the surface of the coverslip with 0.04 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl (PBS, phosphate-buffered saline composed of 0.04 m monosodium phosphate and 0.04 m disodium phosphate with 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4). In some cases, after coating with the desired protein, the glass surface was saturated with a solution of 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature before use. To calculate the amount of protein adsorbed onto the glass surface, the supernatant containing unbound protein was carefully recovered after coating as were three successive 200-μl aliquots of PBS used to rinse the coverslip (washing solution). The amount of adsorbed protein was calculated as the difference between the total amount added for coating and that recovered in the coating plus washing solutions. Platelet interaction with immobilized recombinant fragments or native vWF under flow conditions was observed in real-time by means of epifluorescence videomicroscopy in a modified Hele-Shaw flow chamber (42Usami S. Chen H.H. Zhao Y. Chien S. Skalak R. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 1993; 21: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), as described previously (1Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 3Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The bottom of the chamber was formed by the protein-coated surface of a glass coverslip, and a flow path height of 254 μm was determined by a silicon rubber gasket designed with a shape that resulted in a linear variable wall shear rate from 1500 s−1 at the inlet to 50 s−1 near the outlet when the flow rate was maintained at 2 ml/min. The entire flow path of the chamber, mounted on the stage of an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Axiovert 135 m, Carl Zeiss Inc.), was kept at 37 °C with a thermostatic air bath. Platelets were visualized by adding mepacrine (quinacrine dihydrochloride; 10 μm final concentration), a fluorescent dye that becomes concentrated in the dense granules and has no effects on function at the concentration used (43Dise C.A. Burch J.W. Goodman D.B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4701-4704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When native vWF was immobilized on the surface, reconstituted blood also contained the anti-αIIbβ3monoclonal antibody, LJ-CP8, at the final concentration of 50 μg/ml in order to eliminate any irreversible interaction between platelets and the RGD sequence in vWF (1Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 3Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). In some experiments, recombinant vWF fragments were mixed with the reconstituted blood to evaluate their capacity to inhibit, when in solution, the interaction of platelets with immobilized native vWF or recombinant fragments adsorbed onto the surface. Reconstituted blood, considered to have the same viscosity of 4 centipoise as native blood, was aspirated through the chamber, initially filled with PBS, by a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus Inc.) for the desired time, and all experiments were continuously recorded on videotape using a video cassette recorder (VCR, Magnavox). The number of individual platelets interacting at any given time with immobilized native vWF or recombinant fragments was measured on images obtained at different positions in the flow path of the chamber, corresponding to selected wall shear rates. Each image corresponded to a single frame from the real time (30 frames/s) videotape recording, digitized and processed by computer analysis using a Sony 9500 VCR, a Matrox Image LC frame grabber, and the MetaMorph software package (Universal Imaging Corp.). The motion of platelets not irreversibly attached to the surface was analyzed as previously reported (1Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 3Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). To evaluate the number of platelets displaced from the point of initial interaction, a series of images at 1/3–1/15-s intervals from real time recording was digitized and binarized after application of a threshold to distinguish platelets from background. Movement was defined as spatial displacement on the surface greater than one platelet diameter. The first two consecutive frames in the series were superimposed by the logical AND function, so that the resultant image represented only overlapping areas of an individual platelet at two different times. This computed image was then superimposed to next frame in the time series, and the same logical AND function was applied. The process was repeated for a number of frames corresponding to a preselected time interval, or until the area of overlap was equal to 0. When the latter occurred, the platelet had moved by a distance greater than its diameter; if this did not occur, the platelet was considered firmly attached during the period of observation. To measure the velocity of translocation onto the surface, the centroid of individual platelets on each image was assigned a set of x and y coordinate values. Centroid displacement was then followed as a function of time, typically on a total of 60 frames for each analyzed position in the chamber corresponding to 4–20 s. The rate of frame acquisition from real time recording was selected in relation to the speed of translocation. The velocity of individual platelets was calculated as the distance traveled by the centroid divided by the time interval (1Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar,3Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments established that platelet adhesion to immobilized native vWF or recombinant fragments was maximal after coating glass with a solution at the concentration of 100 μg/ml for 1 h at room temperature (22–25 °C). The corresponding amount of bound protein was in the range of 8.7–15.2 μg per glass slide for all recombinant fragments as well as purified native vWF (Table I). The number of platelets interacting with the coated surface was directly correlated to the amount of adsorbed protein, but considerably less native multimeric vWF than recombinant fragment was required for maximum effect (Fig.1).Table IAmount of native multimeric vWF and recombinant vWF fragments absorbed onto the surface of glass coverslipsProteinCoating solutionSupernatantWashing solutionDensity of proteinVolumeConcentrationVolumeConcentrationVolumeConcentrationμlμg/mlμlμg/mlμlμg/mlμg/coverslip1st experimentNative vWF2001281501065101.78.8rvWF445–733cyclic200134155515706.415.2rvWF508–704cyclic200121145725300.813.5rvWF508–704R/A200123163755751.811.32nd experimentNative vWF2001281551005802.38.7rvWF445–733cyclic200134155555808.713.3rvWF508–704cyclic200121150735700.513.1rvWF508–704R/A200123162735731.911.7The amount of protein adsorbed onto the surface of glass coverslips was determined by subtracting from the total initial amount in the coating solution the sum of that recovered in the supernatant solution after coating and in all washing solutions.

Platelet interaction with immobilized recombinant fragments as well as native multimeric vWF was evaluated in real time at wall shear rates between 50 and 6000 s−1. Fragments of different conformation exhibited considerable variation in their ability to support platelet attachment (Fig.2).

We performed co-localization studies to reveal simultaneously the expression of MCH mRNA and proconvertases (PCs) such as PC1/3 or PC2. In the rat hypothalamus, PC2 was present in all MCH neurons, and PC1/3 was present in about 15–20% of these cells. PC1/3 or PC2 was not found in MCH-positive cells in the spleen. In GH4C1cells co-infected with vaccinia virus (VV):pro-MCH along with VV:furin, PACE4, PC1/3, PC2, PC5/6A, PC5/6B, or PC7, we observed only efficient cleavage at the Arg145-Arg146 site to generate mature MCH. Co-expression of pro-MCH together with PC2 and 7B2 resulted in very weak processing to NEI. Comparison of pro-MCH processing patterns in PC1/3- or PC2-transfected PC12 cells showed that PC2 but not PC1/3 generated NEI. Finally, we analyzed the pattern of pro-MCH processing in PC2 null mice. In the brain of homozygotic mutants, the production of mature NEI was dramatically reduced. In contrast, MCH content was increased in the hypothalamus of PC2 null mice. In the spleen, a single large MCH-containing peptide was identified in both wild type and PC2 null mice. Together, our data suggest that pro-MCH is processed differently in the brain and in peripheral organs of mammals.

Defining the cellular co-localization of each PC with its cognate substrate(s) is necessary in order to ascribe a role for these enzymes in particular precursor processing events.

Recently, several laboratories have suggested an important role for MCH in the regulation of satiety/appetite and associated pathologies such as obesity (40Presse F. Sorokovsky I. Max J.P.

Pedeutour F. Coquerel A. Jordan D. Nahon J.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 46: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Larger forms were found in the human colon, thymus, or adipose tissues (45Viale A. Yao Z. Breton C. Pedeutour F. Coquerel A. Jordan D. Nahon J.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 46: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). In the rat gut (35Hervieu G. Nahon J.L. Neuroendocrinology. 1995; 61: 348-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), testis (37Hervieu G. Segretain D. Nahon J.L. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and spleen 2G. Hervieu and J.-L. Nahon, unpublished data.2G. Hervieu and J.-L. Nahon, unpublished data. most of the MCH immunoreactivity also did not correspond to the mature peptides, but the structure of these pro-MCH derivatives is not yet established. These tissue-specific differences in MCH-derived peptides probably result from differential processing of pro-MCH. In the current study, we examined (i) the cellular co-expression of different convertases in the rat brain and selected peripheral tissues (spleen, testis); (ii) the processing of mammalian pro-MCH in GH4C1 cells expressing various convertases using vaccinia expression systems; (iii) the processing of rat pro-MCH after stimulation by 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF) and 20 mm lithium of PC12 cells engineered to express either PC1/3 or PC2; (iv) the effects of disruption of the PC2 gene on the processing of pro-MCH in the brain, spleen, and testis of transgenic mice. Our main finding is that active PC2 is necessary for the formation of mature NEI in the brain and in cellular models. In contrast, many convertases (including PC1/3 and PC2) have the capacity to generate MCH from its precursor both in virally infected GH4C1 cells and in an animal model.DISCUSSIONIt is now well established that PC1/3 and PC2 are the major enzymes involved in the processing of precursors directed to the regulatory secretion pathway within endocrine and neuroendocrine cells. On the other hand, furin, PACE4, PC5/6, and PC7 exhibit a widespread distribution and are capable of processing proproteins within constitutively secreting cells (1Sossin W.S. Fisher J.M.

Information regarding the role of these enzymes in the processing of the precursor encoding MCH and NEI was so far lacking. We suggest here that PC2 is necessary for the generation of mature NEI in neuronal cells, whereas all of the known PCs are potentially capable of producing MCH from its precursor in mammals.The first criterion to define the physiological importance of endoproteases involved in processing of a specific precursor is obviously to find one or several of these enzymes in the cells expressing the prohormone of interest. In this study, we demonstrate strict co-localization of PC2 with MCH mRNA in neurons of the LHA, the main site of synthesis of pro-MCH in the rat brain (32Bittencourt J.C. Presse F. Arias C. Peto C. Vaughan J. Nahon J.L. Vale W. Sawchenko P.E. J. Comp. Neurol. 1992; 319: 218-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). These results support and extend previous in situ hybridization data showing that most of MCH mRNA-expressing magnocellular cells of the LHA contained also PC2 mRNA (54Seidah N.G. Day R. Marcinkiewicz M. Chrétien M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 680: 135-146Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These results indicate that PC2 represents a strong candidate for the processing of pro-MCH in these neurons. In addition, PC1/3 was also found in some but not all MCH mRNA-expressing perikarya. In a semiquantitative analysis, we estimated that about 15–20% of MCH-positive cells in the LHA co-express also PC1/3. On the other hand, MCH-expressing cells in the gut (macrophages) or testis (spermatogonia, Sertoli cells) lacked PC1/3 or PC2 (data not shown).The cleavage susceptibility of pro-MCH to various prohormone convertases was analyzed first by vaccinia expression systems that generated high levels of pro-MCH and PCs, thereby facilitating the processing analysis. GH4C1 cells were co-infected with recombinant vaccinia virus engineered to express pro-MCH and different prohormone convertases, namely furin, PACE4, PC1/3, PC2, PC2 with various forms of 7B2, PC5/6-A, PC5/6-B, and PC7. Thereafter, peptides produced and MCH precursor were identified by RIA and RP-HPLC analysis. All seven processing enzymes are capable of cleaving on the C-terminal side of the Arg145-Arg146 site to produce high amounts of MCH, the most efficient being PC7 and PC2 in the presence of 7B2 (see Tables I and II and Fig. 3). In great contrast, large amounts of NEI-IR were not found with any of the above combinations of pro-MCH and PCs, although minor cleavage at the Lys129-Arg130site was observed to produce mature NEI with PC7 or PC2 expressed with either 27-kDa 7B2 or 21-kDa 7B2 (see Fig. 3, A andB). Several interpretations may be proposed to explain these data: (i) none of the tested enzymes may actually cleave at this site of pro-MCH; (ii) all or some of these PCs process pro-MCH to produce an NEI form undetectable by our RIA, for instance NEI-GRR (45Viale A. Yao Z. Breton C. Pedeutour F. Coquerel A. Jordan D. Nahon J.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 46: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); (iii) the enzyme(s) involved in cleavage at this site required defined conditions that may not be reproduced in this vaccinia expression model. We cannot rule out, on one hand, the likelihood that a novel uncharacterized convertase is required for this cleavage or, on the other hand, that trimming by carboxypeptidases was reduced in these cells, preventing exposure of epitopes recognized by NEI antiserum (43Rovère C. Viale A. Nahon J.L. Kitabgi P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2954-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 45Viale A. Yao Z. Breton C. Pedeutour F. Coquerel A. Jordan D. Nahon J.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 46: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, we favor another possibility that is discussed below.Because PC1/3 and PC2 co-localized with MCH in the LHA, it was of obvious interest to investigate the role of these processing enzymes in cellular models that expressed PC(s) and pro-MCH in the appropriate intracellular compartment. We have examined therefore the processing of pro-MCH in PC12 cell lines stably transfected with PC1/3 or PC2 (24Rovère C. Barbero P. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11368-11375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the same transfectants expressed active PC1/3 or PC2, resulting in different processing patterns of proneurotensin close to those found in the gut (PC1/3 transfectants) or the brain (PC2 transfectants) (24Rovère C. Barbero P. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11368-11375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We had previously revealed that MCH mRNA production may be induced in PC12 cells by adding NGF and lithium salt to the media for 24 h (47Presse F. Cardona B. Borsu L. Nahon J.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 52: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interpretation of results using our MCH RIA was impeded by the cross-reactivity of the MCH antiserum with unknown proteins of high molecular weights expressed in large amounts in all of the PC12 cell lines tested so far (data not shown). However, the data obtained with the NEI-RIA support the conclusion that PC2 but not PC1/3 may cleave efficiently at the Lys129-Arg130 site to generate NEI when PC12 cells are committed to differentiate into neuron-like cells in the presence of NGF.To further assess the physiological role of PC2 in the pro-MCH processing in vivo, we studied the cleavage of this precursor in a strain of mice lacking functional PC2 (30Furuta M. Yano H. Zhou A. Rouillé Y. Holst J.J. Carroll R. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Furuta H. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Using this model, we showed here that cleavage at the Lys129-Arg130 site was dramatically impaired, whereas cleavage at Arg145-Arg146 was not altered in the hypothalamus. As an internal control, no difference in processing of pro-MCH was observed in cells expressing MCH-related peptides but lacking PC2, such as immune cells located in the spleen (Table III). PC2 corresponds therefore to the key endoprotease responsible for mature NEI production by virtue of cleavage at the Lys129-Arg130 site in neuronal cells, whereas this enzyme may also be involved but is not the only enzyme that can cleave pro-MCH at the Arg145-Arg146 site to release MCH (Fig. 8).Figure 8Schematic representation of the roles of PC2 and other PCs in mammalian pro-MCH processing in the brain and in the peripheral tissues.

These differences could be due to a possible alteration in the formation and storage of fully functional secretory granules in the vaccinia virus-infected cells. More specifically, it is well established that optimal PC2 enzyme activity requires acidic pH and high Ca2+ levels (56Shennan K.I.J. Smeekens S.P. Steiner D.F. Docherty K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 284: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 57Shennan K.I.J. Seal A.J. Smeekens S.P. Steiner D.F. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24011-24017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PC2 cleavage of precursors operates late along the biosynthetic pathway after the dissociation of PC2 from the C-terminal CT peptide of 7B2. These conditions may not be ideally achieved in the secretory pathway of vaccinia virus-infected cells, leading to conflicting results when compared with other cellular or animal models (55Laslop A. Weiss C. Savaria D. Eiter C. Tooze S.A. Seidah N.G. Winkler H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 374-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Based on the in vitro data, numerous prohormone convertases may be candidates for processing at the Arg145-Arg146 site to produce mature MCH (see Table II and Fig. 8). PC2 and PC1/3 have been found co-expressed with MCH in the neurons of LHA, and they represent therefore the strongest candidates. However, PC2 is not required for efficient processing of pro-MCH to produce mature MCH in the PC2 null mice model, and PC1/3 was found only in 15–20% of MCH-expressing neurons in the rat brain. Therefore, other yet uncharacterized proconvertase enzymes may possibly be involved in this cleavage. Among them, the PC5/6-A exhibits some overlapping of expression with MCH in the LHA 4P. Villeneuve and A. Beaudet, personal communication. and may potentially cleave at the Arg145-Arg146 site to liberate MCH (see Table II). PC7 is widely expressed in the hypothalamus, and it could also be present in MCH neurons, but co-localization studies are presently lacking.An intriguing result concerns the 2–3-fold increase in mature MCH content observed selectively in the hypothalamus of PC2 null mice in comparison with controls (see Table III). The elevated MCH concentrations were not paralleled by enhanced gene transcription and/or MCH mRNA stability, as illustrated by our semiquantitative RT-PCR data. One could envisage first that the targeting of MCH-containing granules to axonal projections is somehow altered. Transport of secretory vesicles involves sequential steps and numerous protein factors (58Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Impaired processing of one of these regulatory factors in the PC2 null mice may contribute to a partial decrease in granular transit. Alternatively, chronic elevation of hypothalamic MCH in PC2 null mice may be directly dependent upon the lack of NEI production or other peptidic secretagogues involved in the regulation of pro-MCH synthesis and release. In this context, it is worth noting that similar increase in MCH content was observed in fat/fatmice, which produced the NEI-GRR form but very low amounts of fully processed amidated NEI (43Rovère C. Viale A. Nahon J.L. Kitabgi P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2954-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of MCH content enhancement in PC2 null mice remains at this stage a matter for speculation.Production of pro-MCH derivatives was not modified in spleen and testis of mutant PC2 mice, in agreement with co-localization studies that demonstrated that macrophage-like cells in the spleen and Sertoli cells or spermatogonia in the testis do not express detectable levels of PC2. The levels of MCH-IR contents in mice were close to those found in rat (35Hervieu G. Nahon J.L. Neuroendocrinology. 1995; 61: 348-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or human (45Viale A. Yao Z. Breton C. Pedeutour F. Coquerel A. Jordan D. Nahon J.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 46: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) peripheral tissues. Interestingly, no peak corresponding to either mature MCH or NEI was found in mouse spleen. The MCH immunoreactivity was exclusively associated with a peptidic form corresponding to a 44-min peak. The same product was previously identified as an intermediate cleavage form of pro-MCH, bearing NEI and MCH, in human peripheral tissues (45Viale A. Yao Z. Breton C. Pedeutour F. Coquerel A. Jordan D. Nahon J.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 46: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This large MCH-IR form may represent a novel peptide with hitherto unknown biological activity. Further experiments are required to establish the structure of this material in mice, but it is attractive to suggest that a similar kind of pro-MCH processing operates"

Virol. 1993; 3: 137-148Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although it has not been shown to be directly linked to the development of leukemia, several recent studies indicate that viral replication is critical for the development of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy. Initial studies have reported the treatment of this syndrome using 5′azidothymidine (6Sheremata W.A. Benedict D. Squilacote D.C. Sazant A. DeFreitas E. Neurology. 1993; 43: 2125-2129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All replication-competent retroviruses including HIV and HTLV-1 code for an aspartic proteinase (PR). Unlike HIV-1, HTLV-1 PR is coded through a mechanism of expression in separate gag-pro andgag-pro-pol open reading frames (7Hatfield D.L. Levin J.G. Rein A. Oroszlan S. Adv. Virus Res. 1992; 41: 193-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The level of expression of the Gag and Gag-Pro polyproteins in HTLV-1 is comparable with that of Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins in HIV-1. The function of the mature 125-amino acid-long HTLV-1 PR is crucial for virion replication (for a review, see Ref. 8Oroszlan S. Luftig R.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 157: 153-185PubMed Google Scholar). The HIV-1 PR proved to be a promising target of antiretroviral therapy of AIDS, and various PR inhibitors are now in clinical use (for a review, see Ref. 9Flexner C. N. Eng. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). As in the case of treatment of patients with reverse transcriptase inhibitors, selection of viral variants that are resistant to inhibitors of PR also develops rapidly (9Flexner C. N. Eng. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Some of the amino acid changes in the HIV-1 PR that are responsible for drug resistance are found in equivalent positions of other retroviral proteinases, including HTLV-1 (see Fig. 1). A comparative study of various retroviral proteinases is expected to reveal the common features of their specificity. These studies will aid in the rational design of inhibitors effective against different retroviral proteinases, which may reduce the frequency of occurrence of drug-resistant mutants. In this respect, many inhibitors designed against HIV-1 PR have much reduced potency against the closely related HIV-2 PR (10Tomasselli A.G. Hui J.O. Sawyer T.K Staples D.J. Bannow C. Reardon I.M.

Payne S.L. Dunn B.M. Kay J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that all four HIV-1 PR inhibitors currently used in therapy failed to block HTLV-1 Gag processing in vitro (12Pettit S.C. Sanchez R. Smith T. Wehbie R.

Leukemia (Baltimore). 1997; 3: 45-46Google Scholar), its biochemical and kinetic properties and specificity have not been well described. This can be attributed to the difficulty in protein purification and to the autoproteolysis that is known to occur with native retroviral proteinases (19Rose J.R. Salto R. Craik C.S. J. Biol.

Furthermore, insight into the mechanism of autocatalytic maturation of the mature PR from the precursor is limited to HIV-1 (24Louis J.M. Nashed N. Parris K.D. Kimmel A.R. Jerina D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7970-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 25Wondrak E.M. Nashed N.T. Haber M.T. Jerina D.M. Louis J.M. J. Biol.

Here we report the high level expression in E. coli and rapid purification of wild type and autoproteolysis-resistant HTLV-1 proteinases. The specificities of these two enzymes were compared utilizing synthetic peptides that correspond to known Gag and Pol cleavage sites of HIV-1 and HTLV-1. Several potent inhibitors of HIV-1 PR and other retroviral proteinases have been assessed for their inhibition of the HTLV-1 PR. We also report the effect of substituting the two cysteine residues in HTLV-1 PR and define a chromogenic substrate for assaying this enzyme. The PR coding region of the SacI fragment of an infectious HTLV-1 clone, pCS-HTLV-I (26Ciminale V. Pavlakis G.N. Derse D. Cunningham C.P. Felber B.K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1737-1745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), derived by polymerase chain reaction amplification was cloned at theNdeI and BamHI sites of pET-11a vector (Novagen, WI). Mutagenesis of the Leu40 to Ile was performed by using the overlap extension method (27Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The C90A and C109A mutations were introduced into the L40I-mutated HTLV-I PR using the Quick-Change mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, CA). Triple mutant L40I,C90A,C109A PR was prepared by using the L40I,C109A double mutant as the template. Cells bearing the construct for the expression of the wild-type HTLV-1 PR and its mutants were grown in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 1% glucose at 37 °C, 30% pO2, pH 7.0, in a 3-l Braun model MD fermentor. When the cell suspension reached an absorbance of 0.5–0.6 at 600 nm, protein expression was induced by the addition of 2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3–4 h. Cells (4 g) were suspended in 20 volumes of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmEDTA) containing 100 μg/ml lysozyme and lysed by sonication. The insoluble recombinant protein (inclusion bodies) was washed twice by resuspension in buffer A containing 1 m urea and 1% Triton X-100 and pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The final pellet was solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 7.5 m guanidine HCl, 5 mm DTT, and 5 mm EDTA and applied to a Superdex 75 column (HiLoad 26 × 60, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, NJ) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 m guanidine HCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm DTT at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Peak fractions were further purified by reverse-phase HPLC on POROS RII resin (PerSeptive Biosystems, MA). HPLC fractions were combined, and aliquots were dried, assayed for protein content as described previously (28Wondrak E.M. Louis J.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12957-12962Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and subjected to mass spectroscopic and N-terminal sequence analyses. The HPLC-purified protein fractions were dialyzed in large excess of 25 mm formic acid, pH 2.8, and subsequently into 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, 1 mm, DTT, 1 mm EDTA. For kinetic studies, a portion of the protein in 25 mm formic acid was quenched with at least 100-fold excess of 20 mm PIPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Oligopeptides were synthesized by standard tert-butoxycarbonyl or 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chemistry on a model 430A automated peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) or a semiautomatic Vega peptide synthesizer (Vega-Fox Biochemicals). All peptides were synthesized with C-terminal amides. Amino acid composition of the peptides was determined with a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer. Stock solutions and dilutions were made in distilled water (or in 10 mm DTT for peptides containing Cys or Met residues), and the peptide concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis.

Commun. 1990; 169: 1111-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The enzyme concentrations for HTLV-1 PR preparations were determined by amino acid analysis of the stock solutions, and k cat values were calculated by assuming 100% activity for the PR dimers. The PR assays were initiated by mixing 5 μl of HTLV-1 or HIV-1 PR (8–140 nm), 10 μl of 2× incubation buffer (0.5 mpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.6, containing 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 4 m NaCl), and 5 μl of 0.01 to 0.40 mm substrate. The range of substrate concentration was selected depending on the approximateK m values. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and terminated by the addition of guanidine HCl to give a final concentration of 6 m. The solution was acidified by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid, and an aliquot was injected onto a Nova-Pak C18 reversed-phase chromatography column (3.9 × 150 mm, Waters Associates, Inc.) using an automatic injector. Substrates and the cleavage products were separated using an increasing water-acetonitrile gradient (0–100%) in the presence of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Cleavage products were identified by amino acid analysis. Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the data obtained at less than 20% substrate hydrolysis to the Michaelis-Menten equation by using the Fig. P program (Fig. P Software Corp.). To assay the inhibitors, the volume of substrate KTKVL↓VVQPK was reduced to 4.8 μl (0.25 mm final concentration), and 0.2 μl of inhibitor (in water or in Me2SO) was added. Inhibitors were initially tested at 10 μm or higher concentration. Me2SO was also added at the same concentration to the appropriate control experiments. When inhibition was observed in initial testing, K i values were determined according to Dixon (35Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar). A competitive mode of inhibition was observed, and the standard error for K i values was estimated to be below 20%. The 375-base pair coding region derived from an infectious clone of HTLV-1 by polymerase chain reaction was cloned into pET-11a vector and expressed in E. coli. Fig. 2(lanes 1 and 2) shows the analysis of the total cell lysate before and after isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction. Two products were observed, the larger molecular weight product corresponding to the full-length mature PR and a smaller product with an apparent size of roughly 7 kDa. The latter product was expected to be the result of self-degradation (autoproteolysis) of the mature PR rather than by premature termination during expression. As in the case of HIV-1 PR (28Wondrak E.M. Louis J.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12957-12962Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 36Mildner A.M. Rothrock D.J. Leone J.W. Bannow C.A. Lull J.M.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9405-9413Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), expression of HTLV-1 PR results in its accumulation in the form of inclusion bodies. Lanes 3,4, and 5 show the supernatant upon lysis of cells and the supernatant and the pellet derived after 1 m urea treatment of the initial insoluble pellet, respectively. A comparison of lanes 4 and 5 shows that 1 m urea partially solublizes the full-length PR but not the truncated protein. The insoluble fraction after 1 m urea treatment of the inclusion bodies (see lane 5) was solubilized in guanidine hydrochloride and subjected to size-exclusion chromatography under denaturing conditions. The peak fractions of both the full-length PR and the truncated protein were further subjected to reverse-phase HPLC chromatography. The two proteins that were >98% pure were analyzed for their mass and N-terminal sequence. The full-length mature PR clearly corresponded to the expected N-terminal sequence and mass (m/z = 13475). The truncated protein showed its N-terminal sequence to start with residues Pro-Ile-Ala-Leu-Phe-Ser-Ser, and the expected mass was close to the experimental value (m/z = 9171). From these results, we confirmed our prediction that the truncated protein is derived via autoproteolysis between residues Leu-40/Pro-41 of the full-length mature PR with a sequence spanning amino acids 41 through 125, now termed PR 41–125. The pure full-length protein was also renatured from 25 mm formic acid into 50 mmsodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.05% Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 6.7 μm and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2, lane 6). As expected, the full-length PR gave rise to two products, with apparent mobilities corresponding to ∼9 and 4.5 kDa. The latter protein is termed PR 1–40. Also, similar to the HIV-1 PR, autoproteolysis of the HTLV-1 PR proceeds roughly to about 50%. It is likely that either one or both products inhibit further autoproteolysis. This site of autoproteolysis in HTLV-1 PR is analogous to a less susceptible site in HIV-1 PR (Leu33-Glu34). The major cleavage in HIV-1 PR occurs between residues Leu5 and Trp6 (19Rose J.R. Salto R. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11939-11945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently the feline immunodeficiency virus PR was also shown to undergo autoproteolysis at four primary sites in its 116-amino acid sequence (20Laco G.S. Fitzgerald M.C. Morris G.M. Olson A.J. Kent S.B.H. Elder J.H. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5505-5511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To prevent autoproteolysis of the mature HTLV-1 PR, the Leu40 residue was substituted with an Ile. This substitution was chosen because it has been shown by using synthetic peptides and proteins as substrates that HIV-1 and other retroviral proteinases cannot process at the C-terminal side of β-branched residues (37Dunn B.M. Gustchina A. Wlodawer A. Kay J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 241: 254-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 38Tomasselli A.G. Heinrickson R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 241: 279-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, autoprocessing at an equivalent position (Leu33) and another position (Leu63) in HIV-1 was effectively reduced by substituting these residues with Ile without impairing the kcat/K m for several substrates (36Mildner A.M. Rothrock D.J. Leone J.W. Bannow C.A. Lull J.M. Reardon I.M. Sarcich J.L. Howe W.J. Tomich C.-S.C. Smith C.W. Heinrickson R.L. Tomasselli A.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9405-9413Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The expression of the HTLV-1 PR bearing the mutation L40I compared with the wild-type PR is shown in Fig. 3. Clearly as observed in duplicate clones, there is a single product that accumulates with a substantially higher yield corresponding to the size of the full-length PR. 1.6 g (wet weight) of cells derived from 0.4 liters of culture yields ∼19 and 14 mg of PR after size-exclusion and reversed-phase HPLC chromatography, respectively. Based on the sequence comparison with HIV-1 PR and homologous molecular modeling, 3P. Bagossi, G. Zahuczky, and J. Tozser, unpublished results. the Leu40 residue of HTLV-1 PR is not expected to interact with the substrate or inhibitor. Therefore we predicted that substituting this residue with Ile would not change the kinetic parameters but would prevent its autolysis as compared with the wild-type enzyme. To verify this assumption and to characterize the HTLV-1 PR specificity, kinetic analysis was performed using oligopeptide substrates. The proteinases were renatured by quenching the denatured protein in 50 mmformic acid into 100-fold excess of PIPES buffer at pH 7.0 under conditions similar to those previously described for refolding HIV-2 and equine infectious anemia virus proteinases (39Tözsér J. Friedman D. Weber I.T. Bláha I. Oroszlan S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3347-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Kinetic data for the wild type and L40I mutant PR-catalyzed hydrolysis of synthetic substrates are shown in Table I. Both enzymes exhibit nearly identical kinetic parameters. The nearly identical values of k cat for the wild-type and mutant enzymes also suggest that under these refolding and assay conditions there is no significant autoproteolysis of the wild-type PR. Stabilization of the enzyme can be attributed to 1) the refolding procedure, which involves quenching the denatured protein with a large excess of buffer (pH 7) to a final concentration of 0.1 μm as compared with dialyzing the protein to pH 5.0 at a higher protein concentration and 2) presence of Nonidet P-40 and glycerol in the quench buffer.Table IKinetic parameters for hydrolysis of naturally occurring HTLV-1 cleavage site peptides by wild-type and L40I mutant HTLV-1 proteinasesCleavage siteSubstrate sequenceEnzymeK mk catk cat/K mmms−1mm−1s−1MA/CAAPQVL↓PVMHPHTLV-1 (wt)0.115 ± 0.0188.67 ± 0.6075.4HTLV-1 (L40I)0.098 ± 0.0206.78 ± 0.5069.2CA/NCKTKVL↓VVQPKHTLV-1 (wt)0.033 ± 0.0045.15 ± 0.10156.1HTLV-1 (L40I)0.032 ± 0.0045.18 ± 0.12161.8TF1/PRDPASIL↓PVIPHTLV-1 (wt)0.230 ± 0.0350.70 ± 0.053.0HTLV-1 (L40I)0.244 ± 0.0330.62 ± 0.042.5PR/p3KGPPVIL↓PIQAPHTLV-1 (wt)0.030 ± 0.0066.91 ± 0.39230.3HTLV-1 (L40I)0.034 ± 0.0056.26 ± 0.30184.2wt, wild type.

Because one of our major objectives was to produce quantities of enzyme suitable for structural studies by solution NMR and x-ray crystallography, we next addressed the role of the two cysteines (Cys90, Cys109) on enzymatic activity and specificity of the PR. It was shown that a Cys to Ala substitution at residue 95 of HIV-1 mature PR greatly reduced the tendency of the protein to form an intermolecular disulfide bond (40Yamazaki T. Hinck A.P. Wang Y.X. Nicholson L.K. Torchia D.A. Wingfield P. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J.D. Chang C.H. Domaille P.J. Lam P.Y. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that both the Cys67 and Cys95 residues of HIV-1 can be exchanged to Ala without significantly affecting the structure and kinetic parameters (41Wu J. Adomat J.M. Ridky T.W. Louis J.M. Leis J. Harrison R.W. Weber I.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4518-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).2 Constructs bearing either or both of the two cysteines substituted by Ala were prepared in a L40I HTLV-1 PR construct as described under “Materials and Methods.” We chose to compare the triple mutant L40I,C90A,C109A (termed C2A-PR) with the wild-type PR. C2A-PR was purified as described before for the wild-type HTLV-1 PR. Fig. 4 shows the enzyme before and after refolding. Clearly the refolded enzyme was stable up to 24 h at a concentration of 0.6 mm at ambient temperature. The triple mutant was used to compare the specificity of HTLV-1 and HIV-1 proteinases on naturally occurring cleavage sites of HTLV-1 Gag-Pol polyprotein (Table II).Table IIKinetic parameters for hydrolysis of naturally occurring HTLV-1 cleavage site peptides by C2A-PR and wild-type HIV-1 PRCleavage siteSubstrate sequenceEnzymeK mk catk cat/K mmms−1mm−1s−1MA/CAAPQVL↓PVMHPC2A-PR0.069 ± 0.0205.88 ± 0.5985.2HIV-1 PR0.023 ± 0.0040.37 ± 0.0116.1CA/NCKTKVL↓VVQPKC2A-PR0.051 ± 0.0057.68 ± 0.17150.6HIV-1 PR0.182 ± 0.0332.60 ± 0.2014.3TF1/PRDPASIL↓PVIPC2A-PR0.221 ± 0.0310.84 ± 0.053.8HIV-1 PRNDPR/p3KGPPVIL↓PIQAPC2A-PR0.041 ± 0.01011.82 ± 0.89288.3HIV-1 PR0.025 ± 0.0020.21 ± 0.018.4ND, cleavage products not detected in the assay performed as described under “Materials and Methods” using 0.3 mm substrate and 100 nm enzyme (k cat is estimated to be smaller than 0.01 s−1). Open table in a new tab ND, cleavage products not detected in the assay performed as described under “Materials and Methods” using 0.3 mm substrate and 100 nm enzyme (k cat is estimated to be smaller than 0.01 s−1). To characterize the specificity of C2A-PR, we first used oligopeptide substrates that represent naturally occurring cleavage sites in HTLV-1 Gag-Pol polyprotein. Comparison of the kinetic parameters using C2A-PR (Table II) to those obtained with wild-type and L40I mutant enzymes (Table I) suggest that substitution of the Cys residues to Ala does not alter its catalytic activity. Three of the four peptides tested were excellent substrates of HTLV-1 PR, with catalytic constants comparable with the best naturally occurring HIV-1 cleavage site substrates with HIV-1 PR (42Tözsér J. Bláha I. Copeland T.D. Wondrak E.M. Oroszlan S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 281: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus HTLV PR is an enzyme with high specific activity, similar to HIV-1 PR but unlike avian myeloblastosis virus PR, which has much lowerk cat for its specific substrates. This interpretation is consistent with the mechanisms that regulate the level of expression of the Gag and Gag-Pol products. HIV-1 and HTLV-1, wherein the PR is coded in a Pol open reading frame at ∼10-fold lower level than Gag proteins, have higher specific activity for the PR as compared with avian myeloblastosis virus PR, which is coded in a Gag open reading frame. Another interesting similarity with the HIV-1 and HTLV-1 proteinases is that among the least efficient sites for hydrolysis is the one that yields the free N terminus of PR (42Tözsér J. Bláha I. Copeland T.D. Wondrak E.M. Oroszlan S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 281: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Studies with an analog of the HIV-1 PR precursor indicate that the cleavage at the N terminus of the PR occurs intramolecularly, concomitant with a large increase in enzymatic activity, and this cleavage has been suggested to be the rate-limiting step in the maturation cascade of Gag-Pol polyprotein (24Louis J.M.

Virol. 1998; 72: 3459-3463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When HTLV-1 cleavage site substrates were used as substrates for HIV-1 PR (Table II), three of four peptides were found to be hydrolyzed.

https://openalex.org/W2059233081,"We show here that the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 potently inhibits p53-dependent transcriptional activation of various p53-responsive promoters in reporter gene co-transfection assays in human embryonic kidney 293 and MCF7 cells, without affecting nuclear accumulation of p53 protein. In contrast, Bcl-2(Δtransmembrane (TM)), which lacks a hydrophobic membrane-anchoring domain, had no effect on p53 activity. Similarly, in MCF7 cells stably expressing either Bcl-2 or Bcl-2(ΔTM), nuclear levels of p53 protein were up-regulated upon treatment with the DNA-damaging agents doxorubicin and UV radiation, whereas p53-responsive promoter activity and expression of p21CIP1/WAF1 were strongly reduced in MCF7-Bcl-2 cells but not in MCF7-Bcl-2(ΔTM) or control MCF7 cells. The issue of membrane anchoring was further explored by testing the effects of Bcl-2 chimeric proteins that contained heterologous transmembrane domains from the mitochondrial protein ActA or the endoplasmic reticulum protein cytochrome b5. Both Bcl-2(ActA) and Bcl-2(Cytob5) suppressed p53-mediated transactivation of reporter gene plasmids with efficiencies comparable to wild-type Bcl-2. These results suggest that (a) Bcl-2 not only suppresses p53-mediated apoptosis but also interferes with the transcriptional activation of p53 target genes at least in some cell lines, and (b) membrane anchoring is required for this function of Bcl-2. We speculate that membrane-anchored Bcl-2 may sequester an unknown factor necessary for p53 transcriptional activity.

Cell death is a physiological process that plays a major role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Deregulation of the delicate balance of genes that encode proteins that either induce or inhibit cell death, contributes to the development of human neoplasia. The bcl-2 gene was first discovered because of its involvement in the t(14;18) chromosomal translocations commonly found in lymphomas (1Tsujimoto Y. Cossman J. Jaffe E. Croce C.M. Science. 1985; 228: 1440-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 expression can also be altered in a variety of other cancers through various mechanisms, including loss of p53 tumor suppressor, which down-regulates Bcl-2 expression in some tissues (reviewed in Refs. 2Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar and 3Reed J.C. Miyashita T. Takayama S. Wang H.G. Sato T. Krajewki S. Aime-Sempe C. Bodrug S. Kitada S. Hanada M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 functions as an inhibitor of cell death, thus contributing to cell expansion by inhibiting physiological cell turnover. Bcl-2 has also been shown to block cell death induced by a number of cytotoxic drugs as well as γ-irradiation and is therefore believed to contribute to resistance to anticancer therapies (reviewed in Refs. 2Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar and 3Reed J.C. Miyashita T. Takayama S. Wang H.G. Sato T. Krajewki S. Aime-Sempe C. Bodrug S. Kitada S. Hanada M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, several Bcl-2 homologues have been identified, some of which function as inhibitors (Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, and A1), and others as promoters of cell death (Bcl-XS, Bax, Bak, and BAD). These Bcl-2 family members are characterized by their ability to interact and form homo- and heterodimers (4Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). The relative abundance of anti- and proapoptotic Bcl-2 homologues determines the sensitivity of cells to apoptotic signals (reviewed in Refs. 2Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar and 5Kroemer G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms by which Bcl-2 inhibits cell death remain to be fully elucidated. It has been proposed that Bcl-2 may inhibit cell death by interfering with the function of proapoptotic Bcl-2 homologues, by repressing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, by the sequestration of caspase activators, such as Apaf-1, by interfering with the production of free radicals by cytotoxic agents, or by regulating intracellular calcium homeostasis (for reviews, see Refs.6Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, 7Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 8Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Bcl-2 has also been shown to bind and possibly modulate the function of other mammalian proteins, including R-Ras (9Fernandez-Sarabia M.J. Bischoff J.R.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3884-3892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Bcl-2 protein has a transmembrane C-terminal domain (TM) 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrlamide gel electrophoresis; CMV, cytomegalovirus; kb, kilobase; Ab, antibody. that targets it to intracellular membranes, most notably the outer membranes of mitochondria and nuclei and the endoplasmic reticulum membranes (15Krajewski S.

Membrane anchorage appears to be required for optimal Bcl-2 function but may not be necessary for all of its antiapoptotic functions (18Tanaka S. Saito K. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10920-10926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Borner C. Martinou I. Mattmann C. Irmler M. Schaerer E. Martinou J.C. Tschopp J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor p53 functions primarily as a transcription factor that controls genomic stability. The levels of p53 protein are normally very low but rise dramatically when DNA damage has occurred (20Kuerbitz S.J. Plunkett B.S. Walsh W.V. Kastan M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7491-7495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar, 21Clarke A.R. Purdie C.A. Harrison D.J. Morris R.G. Bird C.C. Hooper M.L. Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 849-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar). High levels of p53 protein cause cell cycle arrest, mostly in G1, or apoptosis depending of the cellular context and the gravity of the damage (22Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar, 23Guillot C. Falette N. Paperin M.-P. Courtois S. Gentil-Perret A. Treilleux I. Ozturk M. Puisieux A.

The p53 gene is often deleted or mutated in cancer cells (25Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 523-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar, 26Moll U.M. Riou G. Levine A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7262-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). This leads to increased susceptibility to malignant transformation and blunted responses to DNA damaging cytotoxic agents (reviewed in Ref. 27Fisher D.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 539-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). The functional status of p53 strongly correlates with its ability to bind specific DNA sequences on target genes and to activate transcription. In addition, p53 can repress transcription of some promoters lacking specific p53 binding sites, and it also possess some transcription-independent functions that are probably relevant to DNA-repair responses (28Ewen M.E. Oliver C.J. Sluss H.K. Miller S.J. Peeper D.S. Genes and Dev. 1995; 9: 204-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 29Mosner B. Mummenbrauer T. Bauer C. Sczakiel G. Grosse F. Deppert W.

Interestingly, an inverse relationship has been found between mutated p53 and Bcl-2 expression in some types of carcinomas (36Silvestrini R. Veneroni S. Daidone M.G. Benini E. Boracchi P. Mezzetti M.

Urol. 1997; 157: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This suggests that p53 and Bcl-2 may serve as inducer and repressor, respectively, of the same apoptotic pathway. Studies withbcl-2 transgenic mice and p53 knockout mice also support this concept (40Marin M.C. Hsu B. Meyn R.E. Donehower L.A. el-Naggar A.K. McDonnell T.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3107-3112PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, it is well known that Bcl-2 is a potent inhibitor of p53-induced apoptosis (41Chiou S.-K. Rao L. White E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2556-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 42Wang Y. Szekely L. Okan I. Klein G. Wiman K.G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3427-3431PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in some cell systems, it has been demonstrated that Bcl-2 inhibits p53 translocation to the nucleus upon DNA damage (43Beham A. Marin M.C. Fernandez A. Herrmann J. Brisbay S. Tari A.M. Lopez-Berenstein G. Lozano G. Sarkiss M. McDonnell T.J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2767-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) or when co-expressed with particular proteins (44Ryan J.J. Prochownik E. Gottlieb C.A. Apel I.J. Merino R. Nunez G. Clarke M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5878-5882Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 may also relieve p53-mediated transcriptional repression (45Shen Y. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 46Sabbatini P. Chiou S.K. Rao L. White E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1060-1070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we report that high levels of Bcl-2 protein significantly impair p53-dependent induction of the cdk inhibitor p21 CIP1/WAF1 after DNA damage in MCF7 breast cancer cells, without, however, blocking p53 nuclear import. In agreement with these findings, we show that Bcl-2 strongly inhibits p53-dependent transactivation of several promoters, including bax, p21 CIP1/waf-1,mdm2, cyclin G, and GADD45 in transient co-transfection assays, again without preventing p53 entry into the nucleus. We also demonstrate that these inhibitory effects of Bcl-2 require its anchorage in intracellular membranes. These findings suggest that in some circumstances, Bcl-2 can block p53 function by inhibiting its transcriptional activity. Thus, Bcl-2 may be capable of interfering with p53 at several levels, probably depending on cell context. The plasmid pGL3-bax contains the p53 response element and TATA box from the BAX promoter cloned into BglII/HindIII sites of the pGL3enhancer reporter plasmid (Promega, Inc). The plasmid pCMV-Bcl-2(ΔTM) was generated by introducing a stop codon and XhoI site at position 562 of Bcl-2 cDNA (47Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S. Irie S. Iwama N. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Golemis E.

All plasmids were sequenced to confirm identity and correct orientation. Other plasmids employed here were previously described, including pCMV-Bcl-2 (49Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K.

Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar), mdm2-luc containing 350 base pairs of the human mdm2promoter (52Juven T. Barak Y. Zauberman A. George D.L. Oren M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3411-3416PubMed Google Scholar), and pGL3-cyclinG-luc containing a 1.48-kb fragment of the cyclin G promoter (53Zauberman A. Lupo A. Oren M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2361-2366PubMed Google Scholar). The control plasmid pGL3promoter, carrying the SV-40 early region promoter, and pGL3enhancer were purchased from Promega. The human breast cancer cell line MCF7, transformed human embryonic kidney 293 cells, 293T, containing the large T antigen, and 293-EBNA cells, carrying the Epstain-Barr virus EBNA-1, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technology, Inc.). In some experiments, MCF7 cells were treated with 0.4 μm doxorubicin (Sigma). MCF7 breast cancer cells (3 × 105) were plated in 60-mm dishes and grown overnight. For transfection, plasmid DNA (2 μg) was diluted into 0.1 ml of Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies) and combined with 5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) in 0.1 ml of Opti-MEM. After incubation for 20 min, 0.8 ml of Opti-MEM was added, and the mixtures were overlaid onto cells. After 4 h, 1 ml of Opti-MEM containing 20% fetal calf serum was added to the cultures. The next day, medium was replaced with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Transformants were selected by growth for 14 days in complete medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies). Polyclonal populations were grown and assayed for stable transgene expression by immunoblotting. Cells at 60% confluency were transfected by a standard calcium phosphate precipitate method. The total amount of plasmid DNA used was normalized to 2 μg/well and 7 μg/plate for transfections in 12-well and 6-cm plates, respectively, by the addition of empty plasmid. For reporter gene assays, 0.2 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCMV-β-galactosidase was co-transfected with the luciferase reporter gene to normalize for variations in transfection efficiency. Cells were exposed to the precipitate for 5 h at 37 °C. For MCF7 cells, a glycerol shock was applied. Cells were exposed to 15% glycerol in HBS buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.05, 0.75 mmNa2HPO4, 140 mm NaCl) for 4 min. The glycerol was removed by washing three times with PBS and replacement with fresh medium. For 293 cells, the medium was replaced without applying a shock. MCF7 stable cell lines were transfected using the lipofection method described above. Cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection. For reporter gene experiments, cells lysates were made as described by the manufacturer (Promega) and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. All transfection experiments were carried out in triplicate, repeated at least three times, and normalized for β-galactosidase activity. For gene expression experiments, cells were washed two times in PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.28 TIU/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm benzamidine, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin). For protein localization experiments, nuclear and nonnuclear fractions were prepared according to the method of Schreiberet al. (54Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nuleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected and washed two times with ice-cold PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors) and left on ice for 15 min prior addition of Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 0.6% (v/v). After centrifugation, supernatants were collected, and the nuclear pellets were washed two times in the same buffer. Pellets were finally resuspended in Buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors) and vigorously shaken for 10 min, and the postnuclear supernatants were cleared by centrifugation. Fractions were normalized for protein content based on the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) prior to the SDS-PAGE/immunoblot assay. Aliquots containing 25 or 35 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 12% gels, followed by electrotransfer to Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). Immunodetection was accomplished using 1:1000 (v/v) of anti-p53 (monoclonal Ab-1 and Ab-2 1:1, Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA), anti-p21/WAF-1 (monoclonal Ab, PharMingen, La Jolla, CA) or anti-Bcl-2 (rabbit antiserum 1701) antibodies (54Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nuleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Detection was performed using the ECL detection method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). MCF7 stable transfectants were seeded into polylysine-coated 8-well chambers (Nalge-Nunc International) and grown overnight at 37 °C. Cells were then co-cultured in 0.4 μm doxorubicin for 20 h further. The cells were then washed, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, rinsed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.15% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and blocked in a solution of 3% BSA in PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with anti-p53 (1:50 monoclonal Ab-2, Oncogene Science Inc., San Diego CA), anti-p21 (1:50 monoclonal Ab-1, Oncogene Science Inc.) or anti-Bcl-2 (1:100 rabbit antiserum 1701) antibodies for 1 h. The slides were washed three times for 5 min in PBS and incubated with a 1:50 dilution (v/v) of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse or TRITC-conjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Dako, Inc.). The washing step was repeated before applying coverslips using Vectashield® mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). To investigate the influence of Bcl-2 on the transactivation activity of p53, a co-transfection reporter gene assay was carried out. For these experiments, MCF7 breast cancer and human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type p53 and Bcl-2, together with a reporter plasmid in which the luciferase gene is driven by a fragment of the human bax gene promoter containing its p53-response element and TATA box. As shown in Fig. 1,A and B, expression of wild-type p53 induced luciferase expression in both cell lines. Co-transfection of Bcl-2 strongly inhibited p53 transcriptional activity in a concentration-dependent manner in both cell lines, whereas co-transfection of a control protein (BAG-1L) did not affect p53 transactivation. To preliminarily explore the mechanisms responsible for the observed suppression of p53 transcriptional activity by Bcl-2, nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from 293T transfected cells and tested for expression of p53 and Bcl-2 by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1 C, Bcl-2 had no obvious effects on total p53 protein levels. In addition, Bcl-2 also did not inhibit p53 accumulation in the nucleus, as has been reported in some but not all types of cells (41Chiou S.-K. Rao L. White E. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1799-1805PubMed Google Scholar). Tubulin staining was used to confirm the accuracy of the nuclear extraction procedure and to confirm loading of equivalent amounts of the samples. Similar results were obtained in MCF7 cells (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that Bcl-2 not only inhibits downstream events in p53-mediated apoptosis but, at least in certain cell lines, it also blocks p53 transcriptional activity. To assess whether Bcl-2 affects the ability of p53 to transactivate promoters other than the baxgene promoter, similar experiments were performed using luciferase-expressing reporter constructs driven by the p53-responsivep21 CIP1/WAF1 , mdm2, or cyclin G promoters. As shown in Fig. 2, as with the bax promoter, Bcl-2 inhibited the p53-dependent transcriptional activity of all promoters, without, however, affecting their basal levels of activity. Under these same conditions, Bcl-2 did not impair the transactivation of the p53-independent SV40 early region promoter used as a control (Fig. 2). Thus, Bcl-2 specifically inhibits p53-mediated transactivation of target genes, apparently without significantly affecting transactivation by other transcription factors. The C-terminal domain of Bcl-2 contains a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids that anchors the protein into cellular membranes (56Tsujimoto Y. Ikegaki N. Croce C.M. Oncogene. 1987; 2: 3-7PubMed Google Scholar, 57Salvakumaran M. Lin H.-K. Miyashita T. Wang H.-G. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.

Previously, Bcl-2 has been found in association with mitochondrial membranes, the nuclear envelope and the endoplasmic reticulum (15Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar, 16Akao Y. Otsuki Y.S. Kataoka S. Ito Y. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2468-2471PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chen-Levy Z. Nourse J. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To assess the importance of the subcellular localization of Bcl-2 for the observed inhibitory effect on p53 transactivation, we compared p53 transcriptional activity in 293-EBNA cells transiently transfected with p53 and either wild-type Bcl-2 or a Bcl-2 mutant, which lacks the C-terminal TM domain. Interestingly, unlike Bcl-2, co-expression of Bcl-2(ΔTM) with p53 did not interfere with p53-mediated transactivation. In fact, this cytoplasmically distributed Bcl-2 deletion mutant slightly stimulated p53 activity, possibly by competing with endogenous Bcl-2 protein. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that the failure of Bcl-2(ΔTM) to suppress p53 was not attributable to lower levels of expression of the truncated protein compared with wild-type p53 (Fig. 3 B). The inability of the Bcl-2(ΔTM) mutant to suppress p53 transcriptional activity could be due either to a specific requirement for the TM domain of Bcl-2 or because of a need for membrane anchoring. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we examined the effects on p53 of Bcl-2 chimerical proteins in which the normal C-terminal TM domain was substituted with membrane-anchoring domains from proteins that reside in either the mitochondrial outer membrane (ActA) or the endoplasmic reticulum (cytochrome b5 (Cb5)) (48Zhu W. Cowie A. Wasfy G.W. Penn L.Z. Leber B. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4130-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Similar to wild-type Bcl-2, plasmids encoding either Bcl-2(ActA) or Bcl-2(Cb5) proteins caused a concentration-dependent suppression of p53-mediated gene transcription (Fig. 3 A). The mitochondria-targeting Bcl-2(ActA) protein was somewhat more potent that the endoplasmic reticulum-targeting Bcl-2(Cb5) protein. Comparable levels of expression of the wild-type and mutant proteins were demonstrated by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3 B). Again, p53 protein production and nuclear localization were unaffected (data not shown). These observations indicate that the inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 on p53 transactivation requires its insertion into membranes. The role of Bcl-2 in p53-mediated transactivation of target genes induced following DNA damage was investigated using MCF7 breast cancer cells that had been stably transfected with plasmids"

Yet, the signaling pathway(s) that regulate its expression have remained largely unresolved. Using the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK1/2) inhibitor PD98059 and dominant negative forms of Ras (N17) and ERK1 (K71R), we found that activation of Ras and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is necessary for colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1)-mediated c-Myc expression and DNA synthetic (S) phase entry. Quiescent NIH-3T3 cells expressing a partially defective CSF-1 receptor, CSF-1R (Y809F), exhibited impaired ERK1 activation and c-Myc expression and failed to enter the S phase of the cell division cycle in response to CSF-1 stimulation. Ectopic expression of a constitutively active form of MEK1 in cells expressing CSF-1R (Y809F) rescued c-Myc expression and S phase entry, but only in the presence of CSF-1-induced cooperating signals. Therefore, MEK1 participates in an obligate signaling pathway linking CSF-1R to c-Myc expression, but other signals from CSF-1R must cooperate with the MEK/ERK pathway to induce c-Myc expression and S phase entry in response to CSF-1 stimulation.

The immediate-early response gene c-myc encodes one of the common effectors of mitogen-regulated proliferation and transformation (1Lemaitre J.-M. Buckle R.S. Méchali M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 70: 96-144Google Scholar, 2Henriksson M. Lüscher B. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 109-182Crossref Google Scholar). Myc is a transcription factor that associates in dimeric complexes with its partner Max to activate a series of Myc-responsive genes, at least some of which are necessary for entry into the DNA synthetic (S) phase of the cell division cycle. The critical events underlying Myc control of S phase entry are still unresolved. Myc antagonizes the function of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 by promoting its degradation and/or sequestration into inactive complexes with other proteins, and this leads in turn to the activation of cyclin E-CDK2 prior to the G1/S transition (3Vlach J.

Mitogen-induced signaling pathway(s) that mediate the induction of c-Myc expression have also largely remained an enigma. The ability of c-Myc to override cell cycle arrest imposed by dominant negative forms of Src kinases suggests that Src-mediated signaling may be responsible for c-Myc expression (13Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized growth factor-induced signaling pathways is the Ras/Raf/MEK 1The abbreviations used are: MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; CSF-1R, colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; LCM, L cell conditioned medium; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; MSV, murine sarcoma virus; tk, thymidine kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; ER, estrogen receptor./MAPK pathway, and several lines of evidence indicate that it can regulate c-Myc expression. First, the c-myc promoter contains conserved binding sites for Ets family transcription factors, which can be activated by Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling (14Brunner D. Dücker K. Oellers N. Hafen E. Scholz H. Klämbt C. Nature. 1994; 370: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 15Roussel M.F. Davis J.N. Cleveland J.L. Ghysdael J. Hiebert S.W.

Second, inhibition of cell growth caused by overexpression of the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain of the Ras GTPase-activating protein can be rescued by enforced c-Myc expression (18Bortner D.M. Ulivi M. Ostrowski M.C. Int. J. Oncol. 1992; 1: 221-225PubMed Google Scholar). Third, induction of c-Myc expression by the oncoprotein v-Abl requires both functional Ras and Raf-1 (19Zou X. Rudchenko S. Wong K. Calame K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Finally, overexpression of a dominant negative and growth-suppressive form of Raf-1 (Raf-1-C4B) significantly reduces serum-dependent induction of c-Myc, whereas conditional expression of an inducible Raf-1 fusion protein is in itself sufficient to induce c-Myc expression (20Kerkhoff E. Houben R. Löffler S. Troppmair J. Lee J.-E. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The downstream effectors of activated Raf-1 are MEK1 and MEK2, but to date neither of these kinases has been linked to regulation of c-Myc expression. The colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), a growth factor receptor with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, is expressed specifically in macrophages and trophoblasts (21Sherr C.J. Rettenmier C.W. Sacca R. Roussel M.F. Look A.T. Stanley E.R. Cell. 1985; 41: 665-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar), and bone marrow-derived macrophages require CSF-1 for cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation (22Stanley E.R. Guilbert L.J. Tushinski R.J. Bartelmez S.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1983; 21: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of human CSF-1R in murine fibroblasts endows them with the ability to proliferate in chemically defined medium containing CSF-1 as the sole growth factor (23Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7924-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). One of the major autophosphorylation sites within ligand-stimulated CSF-1R is tyrosine 809, located in the activation loop of the kinase domain (24Roussel M.F. Shurtleff S.A. Downing J.R. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6738-6742Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Substitution of this residue with phenylalanine (Y809F) leads to reduction but not abolition of receptor protein kinase activity (25Davis J.N. Rock C.O. Cheng M. Watson J.B. Ashmun R.A. Kirk H. Kay R.J. Roussel M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7398-7406Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).

These CSF-1-stimulated cells fail to activate MAP kinases, ERK1 and 2, and to induce c-Myc and cyclin D1, both of which are required for entry into S phase (26Roussel M.F. Cleveland J.L.

Enforced expression of c-Myc or D-type cyclins rescues ligand-induced mitogenesis by CSF-1R (Y809F), enabling the cells to proliferate continuously and to form colonies in semisolid medium (26Roussel M.F.

We have used macrophages as well as NIH-3T3 fibroblasts expressing different forms of CSF-1R to assess the role of the MEK/ERK pathway in the induction of c-Myc expression. We report that MEK1 activity is necessary for c-Myc expression, although maximal c-Myc induction and S phase entry require the cooperation of additional signaling molecules. A murine macrophage cell line, Bac1.2F5 (29Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 701-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar), was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units each of penicillin and streptomycin per ml, and 25% L cell conditioned medium (LCM) as a source of murine CSF-1. For CSF-1 stimulation, Bac1.2F5 cells were growth arrested in medium lacking LCM for 18 h, and quiescent cells were restimulated with medium containing LCM for the indicated times. For treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (kindly provided by Stuart J. Decker, Warner-Lambert Co., Ann Arbor, MI), quiescent cells were pretreated with 60 μm PD98059 or the vehicle control dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (0.3%) for 30 min before the addition of medium containing LCM with PD98059 or Me2SO. NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing human CSF-1R or mutant CSF-1R (Y809F) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, glutamine, and antibiotics (23Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7924-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For CSF-1 stimulation, cells were growth arrested in serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% FBS, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin) for 36 h. Quiescent cells were restimulated to enter the cell cycle with serum-free medium containing purified recombinant human CSF-1 at 10 ng/ml (kindly provided by Steven C. Clark, Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA). S phase entry was monitored by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) into newly synthesized DNA (30Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.E. Kato J.-Y. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). To measure cell growth in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts coexpressing CSF-1R (Y809F) and zinc-inducible activated MEK1, cells were growth arrested in serum-free medium, and quiescent cells were switched to medium containing either 25 μm ZnSO4, CSF-1, or both, harvested daily, and counted. The plasmid pMTCB6-MEK1* contains a mutant, constitutively active murine MEK1 gene under the control of a zinc-inducible metallothionein promoter (31Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The plasmid pSRαMSV-CSF-1R-tkneo was constructed by inserting human CSF-1R cDNA downstream of the MSV promoter into the EcoRI site of the pSRαMSV(EcoRI)-tkneo vector, provided by Dr. Charles Sawyers, UCLA. The plasmid pRK5-Ras N17 was constructed by inserting the murine Ha-Ras N17 cDNA into the NheI andXhoI sites of pRK5 (32Wang D. Stravopodis D. Teglund S. Kitazawa J. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6141-6148Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The plasmids pCEP4-HA and pCEP4-HA-ERK1 (K71R), which encode a dominant negative form of murine ERK1 (K71R) (33Xu S. Robbins D. Frost J. Dang A. Lange-Carter C. Cobb M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6808-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), were provided by Dr. Melanie H. Cobb (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas). The calcium phosphate precipitation method (34Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) was used for transfection. The plasmid pMTCB6-MEK1* (20 μg) was cotransfected with pJ6Ω-puro (5 μg), encoding puromycin resistance (35Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1068-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), into NIH-3T3 cells expressing the mutant CSF-1R (Y809F). After selection for 3 weeks in complete medium containing 7.5 μg/ml puromycin, MEK1*-positive subclones were isolated by limiting dilution in 96-well microtiter plates. For transient transfection, NIH-3T3 cells were cotransfected with pSRαMSV-CSF-1R-tkneo together with either a control vector (pCEP4-HA), a vector encoding dominant negative Ras N17 (pRK5-Ras N17), or a vector encoding dominant negative ERK1 (pCEP4-ERK1 (K71R)). 30 h after transfection, cells were growth arrested for 18 h in serum-free medium, and quiescent cells were restimulated with serum-free medium containing 10 ng/ml CSF-1 for 8 h or 14 h as indicated. The transfection efficiency of NIH-3T3 cells was about 10% as determined by transfecting the cells with β-galactosidase expression plasmid and subsequent cellular staining of β-galactosidase (data not shown). The ERK immune complex kinase assay was performed as described previously (36Reuter C.W.M. Catling A.D. Weber M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were lysed in ERK lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was measured with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Chemical Co.). Cell lysates (400 μg of protein) were mixed with 2 μg of either ERK1 (K-23) or ERK2 (C-14) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads 1:1 in lysis buffer (v/v) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation, washed four times with ERK lysis buffer, two times with kinase reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 10 mmMgSO4), and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer. For the kinase reaction, the beads were incubated with 5 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma) and 50 μm ATP containing 10 μCi of [32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 1/3 volume of sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and heating at 85 °C for 5 min. Labeled proteins were resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, which were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Total cellular RNA (20 μg/sample) was separated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described previously (26Roussel M.F. Cleveland J.L. Shurtleff S.A. Sherr C.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Membranes were baked at 85 °C, blocked with Denhardt's solution (37Denhardt D.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 23: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar), hybridized with a 32P-labeled mouse c-myccDNA probe prepared by random priming (Boehringer Mannheim), and washed membranes were subjected to autoradiography (26Roussel M.F. Cleveland J.L. Shurtleff S.A. Sherr C.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To detect the c-Myc protein, 2 × 106 cells were lysed in 100 μl of gel sample buffer, and cell lysates were boiled for 10 min. After brief sonication, the proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Micron Separations, Westborough, MA). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmKCl) containing 3% nonfat dry milk. Filters were incubated with the c-Myc antibody (06-340, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) in Tris-buffered saline and milk for 2 h at room temperature, and sites of antibody binding were identified using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Detection of cyclin D1 (72-13G-11), CDK4 (RY), human CSF-1R (RA), Myc-tagged active MEK1 (MEK1*) (9E10), and actin (C-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with the indicated antibodies was described previously (31Cheng M.

Hybridoma. 1994; 13: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To address the role of MEK1/2 in CSF-1R-induced c-Myc expression, Bac1.2F5, a macrophage-derived cell line that requires CSF-1 for proliferation, was treated with the specific MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (41Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar, 42Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). Cells made quiescent by deprivation of CSF-1 for 16 h were pretreated with PD98059 or with Me2SO solvent for 30 min and then restimulated with medium containing CSF-1 together with PD98059 or Me2SO. Treatment with 60 μm PD98059 blocked CSF-1R-induced activation of ERK1 and ERK2 as measured by in vitro kinase assays (Fig.1 A). Analysis of total RNA by Northern blotting demonstrated that the addition of 60 μmPD98059 significantly impaired CSF-1-mediated induction of c-myc expression, reducing c-mycmRNA by 80% by 6 h of treatment (Fig. 1 B,lane 5 versus lane 3). In contrast, c-myc mRNA levels were not significantly altered by treatment with Me2SO (Fig. 1 B, lanes 6 and 7). PD98059 also inhibited the induction of c-Myc protein in response to CSF-1, whereas Me2SO had no significant effect (Fig. 1 C). In Bac1.2F5 macrophages, the expression of CDK4 is dependent on the addition of CSF-1 to the culture medium (39Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). CDK4 expression was unaffected by PD98059 (Fig.1 C), indicating that this inhibitor did not indiscriminately block CSF-1 signaling. Because c-Myc is essential for CSF-1-mediated S phase entry (26Roussel M.F. Cleveland J.L. Shurtleff S.A. Sherr C.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 43Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Eisenman R.N. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2796-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the effect of these inhibitors on entry into the cell cycle was determined. As expected, PD98059-treated quiescent macrophages failed to enter S phase after CSF-1 stimulation, whereas Me2SO-treated cells were not inhibited (Fig.1 D). Similar results were obtained after PD98059 treatment of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts engineered to express CSF-1R (data not shown). Although PD98059 is a specific inhibitor of MEK1/2, it remained possible that some of its inhibitory effects might be caused by inhibition of other as yet unidentified MEKs. Given that Ras signals via MEKs to activate ERKs, we assessed the effects of dominant negative forms of Ras (N17) and ERK1 (K71R) on c-Myc induction in response to CSF-1. NIH-3T3 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding wild-type human CSF-1R alone or together with plasmids encoding Ras (N17) or ERK1 (K71R). Transfected cells growth arrested by serum depletion were stimulated with serum-free medium containing human CSF-1 as the only mitogen (Fig.2 A). Those transfected with CSF-1R alone expressed c-Myc (Fig. 2 A, lane 2) and began to enter S phase by 14 h after CSF-1 stimulation (Fig.2 B, lane 2). In contrast, coexpression of CSF-1R with the dominant negative Ras (N17) or ERK1 (K71R) significantly impaired CSF-1R-mediated induction of c-Myc (Fig. 2 A,lanes 3–6), and most cells failed to enter S phase (Fig.2 B, lanes 3–6), even though comparable CSF-1R levels were observed in all transfectants (Fig. 2 A). Together, these results support the view that signaling through the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway is required for CSF-1-dependent induction of c-Myc and S phase entry. NIH-3T3 cells that stably express a mutant CSF-1R (Y809F) that is partially defective in its kinase activity fail to induce c-Myc in response to CSF-1 stimulation (26Roussel M.F. Cleveland J.L. Shurtleff S.A. Sherr C.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). After stimulation with CSF-1, activation of the wild-type receptor induced a rapid transient peak of ERK1 activation followed by a lower level of activation which persisted in the presence of CSF-1 (Fig. 3,A and B). By contrast, much weaker activation of ERK1 was seen in cells expressing equivalent levels of mutant CSF-1R (Y809F) (Fig. 3, A and B). To assess whether MEK1 might restore signaling by CSF-1R (Y809F), an expression plasmid encoding a constitutively active, Myc-tagged form of MEK1 (designated MEK1*) expressed under the control of a zinc-inducible metallothionein promoter was introduced into NIH-3T3 cells that stably express mutant CSF-1R (Y809F). Several individual clones were selected by limiting dilution (31Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In quiescent serum-starved cells, MEK1* protein was not detected using an antibody to the Myc-epitope tag (Fig.4 A, lane 1). Zinc treatment induced high levels of MEK1* protein expression, which were readily detectable by 6 h of zinc treatment (Fig. 4 A,lane 3). In response to MEK1* expression, ERK1 activity and cyclin D1 expression were induced as reported previously (Fig.4 A) (see also Ref. 31Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In contrast, MEK1* activation was insufficient to induce c-Myc expression (Fig. 4 A,lanes 1–5). As expected, high levels of c-Myc were induced by FBS stimulation (Fig. 4 A, lanes 6–10), indicating that the Myc response was specifically refractory to signaling via CSF-1R (Y809F). Therefore, whereas CSF-1R-mediated c-Myc expression is dependent on MEK1/2 activity (Figs. 1 and 2), induction of c-Myc appears to require CSF-1R-mediated signals in addition to those mediated by the MEK/ERK pathway. To explore this issue further, NIH-3T3 cells coexpressing CSF-1R (Y809F) and inducible MEK1* were serum starved and restimulated with medium containing CSF-1 without or with zinc. Treatment with both zinc and CSF-1 induced c-Myc expression (Fig. 4 B,lanes 6–10), whereas, as expected, CSF-1 treatment alone did not (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1–5) (24Roussel M.F. Shurtleff S.A. Downing J.R. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6738-6742Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). High levels of c-Myc protein were detected 6 h after stimulation with zinc plus CSF-1 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 6–10), correlating with the onset of MEK1* expression in response to zinc treatment alone (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1–5). However, in the presence of both CSF-1 and zinc, the levels of Myc achieved were still lower than those detected in response to FBS stimulation, again implying that multiple CSF-1R signaling pathways cooperate in Myc induction. Ectopic expression of either c-Myc or D-type cyclins in NIH-3T3 cells expressing mutant CSF-1R (Y809F) resensitizes them to the mitogenic effects of CSF-1 and enables them to proliferate continuously (26Roussel M.F. Cleveland J.L. Shurtleff S.A. Sherr C.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 27Roussel M.F. Theodoras A.M. Pagano M. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6837-6841Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). MEK1/2 activation was shown to be required for mitogen-dependent c-Myc and cyclin D1 expression (44Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G.

Although sufficient to induce cyclin D1 expression (see Fig.4 A), zinc-regulated expression of MEK1* alone does not induce S phase entry (31Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). To address whether zinc-inducible MEK1* could rescue S phase entry and proliferation of cells expressing mutant CSF-1R (Y809F) in response to CSF-1 stimulation, NIH-3T3 cells stably transfected with CSF-1R (Y809F) and zinc-inducible MEK1* were serum starved and restimulated with CSF-1, zinc, or both. As expected, NIH-3T3 cells expressing the wild-type receptor entered S phase in response to CSF-1 stimulation, whereas CSF-1-stimulated cells expressing the mutant CSF-1R (Y809F) failed to enter S phase (Fig.5 A). However, approximately 65% of cells harboring both CSF-1R (Y809F) and inducible MEK1* were able to enter S phase by 18 h (Fig. 5 A) and proliferate (Fig. 5 B) in medium containing both zinc and CSF-1. Consistent with the observations above that FBS was more efficient than CSF-1 plus zinc in inducing Myc in these cells, their growth rate (doubling time ∼60 h) (Fig. 5 B) was significantly slower than cells grown in FBS (doubling time, ∼24 h). NIH-3T3 cells harboring the wild-type receptor show no such impairment in response to CSF-1 (23Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7924-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, even though MEK1*- and CSF-1R (Y809F)-dependent signals can cooperate to rescue cell proliferation in response to CSF-1, other receptor-mediated signals are required for maximal CSF-1-induced cell proliferation. Our results strongly support the concept that Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling is an obligate pathway for growth factor receptor-mediated c-Myc induction (20Kerkhoff E. Houben R. Löffler S. Troppmair J. Lee J.-E. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Experiments utilizing the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 as well as dominant negative forms of Ras (N17) and ERK1 (K71R) indicate that activation of Ras and MEK/ERK is necessary for c-Myc expression in response to CSF-1. However, signaling through this pathway is insufficient to guarantee c-Myc induction because the ectopic expression of enzymatically active MEK1* in quiescent cells did not induce c-Myc expression in the absence of other cooperating signals. When cells coexpressing both CSF-1R (Y809F) and MEK1* were stimulated with CSF-1, c-Myc was induced, and the cells entered S phase. Although active MEK1 rescued CSF-1R (Y809F)-mediated c-Myc expression and mitogenesis, the level of c-Myc induction and rate of cell proliferation remained below those obtained using cells expressing wild-type CSF-1R alone. Together, the results imply that several CSF-1R-mediated signaling pathways cooperate with MEK/ERK to induce c-Myc maximally and drive entry into S phase. Our findings are generally consistent with a previous report that overexpression of a dominant negative form of Raf-1 (Raf-1-C4B) can reduce serum-mediated c-Myc expression (20Kerkhoff E. Houben R. Löffler S. Troppmair J. Lee J.-E. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Moreover, c-Myc induction by v-Abl, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase, requires functional Ras and Raf-1 (19Zou X. Rudchenko S. Wong K. Calame K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, there are also discrepancies between our results and those of others. Although regulated expression by tamoxifen of a fusion protein between the estrogen receptor and Raf-1 (Raf-ER) was sufficient to induce c-Myc expression and S phase entry in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (20Kerkhoff E. Houben R. Löffler S. Troppmair J. Lee J.-E. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), our results would suggest that collateral signals in addition to MEK/ERK activation are required for c-Myc expression. One possibility is that Raf-ER might activate pathways in addition to MEK/ERK signaling. For example, cdc25A, a tyrosine phosphatase involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, has been implicated in Raf-1- but not MEK1/2-mediated signaling (49Galaktionov K. Jessus C. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1046-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Constitutive expression of active MEK1 in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts can lead to serum-independent growth (50Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar), and ectopic expression of active MEK1 under the control of the estrogen receptor (MEK1-ER) in these same cells resulted in accelerated S phase entry (51Greulich H. Erickson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13280-13288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast, our data indicated that inducible expression of active MEK1 by zinc in the absence of any other growth factors in the medium was not sufficient to promote S phase entry (31Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The different levels of active MEK1 achieved in the transfected cell lines might explain the discrepancies between the latter sets of experiments. Although phosphoinositol 3-kinase is activated quickly in response to CSF-1, its overall activity is not altered in response to CSF-1R (Y809F)-mediated signaling (24Roussel M.F. Shurtleff S.A. Downing J.R. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6738-6742Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is unlikely to be a candidate for the second signal. Moreover, inhibition of its activation with wortmannin had no effect on CSF-1R-mediated c-Myc expression (data not shown). Microinjection of dominant negative Src constructs or neutralizing antibodies to Src family kinases has shown that they are required for DNA synthesis in response to CSF-1 or platelet-derived growth factor (52Twamley-Stein G.M. Pepperkok R. Ausorge W. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7696-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Src family kinases associate with and are activated by growth factor receptors via their Src homology domain-2 and are substrates for the receptor kinases (53Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T.

Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). Src family kinases can also activate a pathway that leads to the transcription of c-myc (13Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Specifically, constitutively expressed c-Myc rescues a G1 block elicited by a dominant negative form of Src, whereas Fos and Jun rescue a G1 block induced by dominant negative Ras. This has led to the suggestion that Src family kinases induce c-Myc in a Ras-independent fashion (13Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Even though the downstream targets of Src family kinases have not been well characterized, the importance of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signal pathway in transmitting Src-mediated signals has been demonstrated (55Erpel T. Courtneidge S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar,56Brown M.F. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). For example, transformation of fibroblasts by oncogenic Src is blocked by inhibiting Ras function with anti-Ras antibody or by overexpression of GTPase-activating protein (57Smith M.R. DeGudicibus S.J. Stacey D.W. Nature. 1986; 320: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 58Nori M. Vogel U.S. Gibbs J.B. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2812-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is also required for the transcriptional induction of several Src targets including the mitogen-responsive transcription factor Egr-1 (59Quresh S.A. Rim M. Bruder J. Kolch W. Rapp U. Sukhatme V.P. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20594-20597PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the induction of c-Myc by the Src family kinases is at least in part dependent on Ras function.

Using a genomic differential screening approach, we isolated differentially expressed cosmid clones carrying several copies of the mini-exon gene. We report that the spliced leader (SL) RNA, essential for the maturation of all pre-mRNAs by trans-splicing, is developmentally regulated in Leishmania donovani amastigotes and that this regulation is rapidly induced upon parasite growth under acidic conditions. Stage-specific regulation of the SL RNA is associated with the expression of a larger ∼170-nucleotide transcript that bears an additional 15-nucleotide sequence at its 3′-end and is polyadenylated in contrast to the mature SL RNA. The poly(A)+ SL RNA represents 12–16% of the total SL transcript synthesized in amastigotes and is 2.5–3-fold more stable than the poly(A)− transcript. The poly(A)+ SL transcript is synthesized specifically from one class of the genomic mini-exon copies. Polyadenylation of the SL RNA may control the levels of the SL mature transcript under amastigote growth and may represent an additional step in the gene regulation process during parasite differentiation.

Leishmania is a protozoan parasite that infects and replicates within mammalian macrophages, thereby causing a wide spectrum of diseases in humans. The parasite's life cycle comprises two stages involving two different hosts: the flagellated promastigote stage, which is present in the gut of the sand fly vector, and the aflagellated non-motile amastigote present in the phagolysosomes of mammalian macrophages. During its developmental cycle,Leishmania adapts to the different environments encountered by undergoing a series of morphological and biochemical changes mediated by the differential expression of a variety of genes. Until now, only few of these genes have been identified, and the mechanisms of their stage-specific regulation are still poorly understood. In Leishmania, several studies have shown that post-transcriptional regulation of developmentally expressed transcripts involved sequences present mainly in the 3′-untranslated regions (1Aly R. Argaman M. Halman S. Shapira M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2922-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 2Charest H. Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2922-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and in intergenic regions between tandemly repeated genes (4Ramamoorthy R. Swihart K.G. McCoy J.J. Wilson M.E.

Similarly, in trypanosomes, elements in the 3′-untranslated and intergenic regions of many mRNAs were found to be involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, RNA stability, or translation (6Hehl A. Vassella E. Braun R. Roditi I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 7Nozaki T. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem.

Biol. 1997; 17: 4372-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The predominance of post-transcriptional over transcriptional controls is probably because of the organization of the trypanosomatid genome in large polycistronic transcription units (11Johnson P.J. Kooter J.M. Borst P. Cell. 1987; 51: 273-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 12Tschudi C. Ullu E.

Maturation of all pre-mRNAs in these organisms involves two RNA processing reactions; trans-splicing (15Borst P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 701-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 16Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and 3′-end cleavage linked to polyadenylation (17LeBowitz J.H. Smith H.Q. Rusche L. Beverley S.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 18Matthews K.R. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Polycistronic precursor RNAs are processed into monocistronic units by the excision of intergenic sequences and the addition of a 5′-capped 39-nucleotide spliced leader (SL 1The abbreviations used are: SL, spliced leader; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); RT, reverse transcriptase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; nt, nucleotide(s). or mini-exon) to the 5′-end of each pre-mRNA by trans-splicing. The mini-exon sequence is donated from a small independent RNA, the SL RNA or mini-exon-derived RNA, which is required for RNA processing, transcript stability, and initiation of translation in a variety of trypanosomatid protozoa (16Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Trans-splicing constitutes an essential step in transcript's maturation and, as such, may serve as an important mode for the control of gene expression in kinetoplastida. It has been previously shown that exposure of Trypanosoma bruceiprocyclics to severe heat shock inhibited trans-splicing and processing of the α- and β-tubulin transcripts (19Muhich M.L. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7107-7110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we report that the SL RNA of Leishmania donovani is developmentally regulated in the amastigote stage. This regulation involves a specific polyadenylation of a longer SL transcript, which seems to be synthesized specifically from one class of the genomic mini-exon repeats. This is the first time where polyadenylation of a normally non-polyadenylated RNA is reported as part of a putative regulatory mechanism aiming at controlling gene expression in a specific stage of Leishmania's life cycle. Specific polyadenylation of the SL RNA may represent an additional step in the gene regulation process during Leishmaniadifferentiation into the amastigote form. L. donovani donovani Sudanese 1S2D and L. donovani infantum LEM1317 (from Dr. Bastien, Montpellier, France) strains were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum and 5 mg/ml hemin. Promastigotes were cultured in RPMI at pH 7.0 and 25 °C. To induce axenic differentiation we used a slightly modified protocol published by Joshi et al. (20Joshi M. Dwyer D.M. Nakhasi H.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) where stationary phase parasites were transferred into RPMI medium supplemented with 20% calf serum and MES to maintain the pH at 5.0 and grown for 5 days at 25 °C before being shifted to 37 °C at a 5% CO2atmosphere for an additional 24 h. Amastigotes were also isolated from the spleens of gold Syrian hamsters infected intraperitoneally with 5 × 107 L. donovani 1S2D amastigotes as described (21Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Total RNA ofL. donovani promastigotes and amastigotes was isolated using the guanidinium isothiocyanate method with TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.). cDNAs corresponding to all poly(A)+ mRNA transcripts were synthesized using an oligo(dT)18 primer and the Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Southern and Northern blot hybridizations were performed following standard procedures (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The two probes used for these studies correspond to the intron sequence of the spliced leader RNA gene generated by PCR using P1 (5′-ATTGGTATGCGAAACTTCCG-3′) and P2 (5′-CCGCTACGGAAGCCGCCGGC-3′) primers (see Fig. 8) and to the whole mini-exon repeat, as part of the 434-bp NcoI fragment. Neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) and hygromycin phosphotransferase (hyg) specific probes were made by PCR and used for determining the vector copy number in the transfectants. The L. donovani infantum LEM1317 cosmid library was prepared by ligating size-selected Sau3AI partial digest products of genomic DNA with the shuttle vector cL-HYG (23Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M. Gene (Amst .). 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), cleaved byBamHI, and packaged using the Gigapack Gold II kit (Stratagene). The library was gridded onto nylon membranes at the Toronto Genome Center (Hospital for Sick Children) to generate high density filters of 92 × 4 × 4. High density filters of the same series were hybridized independently to L. donovaniamastigote and promastigote 32P-labeled cDNA probes. Constructs pSPαneoα-miniexA, pSLαneoα-miniexB, and pSLαneoα-miniexC bearing the three different mini-exon genomic copies of L. infantum LEM1317 were made as follows. The 424-bp NcoI fragments (copies B and C) from cosmid 3H4 (carrying ∼20 kilobase pairs of the mini-exon locus) were subcloned into the NcoI site of pSL1180 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and theSmaI-BamHI αneoα expression cassette (24Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3601-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) from vector pSP72αneoα was introduced intoEcoRV-BamHI sites of pSL1180 to generate pSLαneoα-miniexB and pSLαneoα-miniexC, respectively. The 434-bpNcoI fragment (copy A) was subcloned into theBamHI site of pSP72αneoα expression vector following a Klenow polymerase treatment. Expression of the neo gene in pSP72αneoα and pSLαneoα is driven by the intergenic region of the α-tubulin gene (represented here by α) (25Laban A. Tobin J.F. Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Wirth D.F. Nature. 1990; 343: 572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The cDNAs of the poly(A)+ and poly(A)− SL transcripts (see below) were amplified by RT-PCR using P1 (see Fig. 8) and an oligo(dT)18 as primers and subcloned into pCRTM2.1 (Invitrogen) to generate pSL-RNA(A)+ and pSL-RNA(A)− vectors, respectively. The nucleotide sequence of the different genomic mini-exon repeats of L. donovani1S2D and L. infantum LEM1317 and of the cDNAs was determined by an ABI Prism 377 DNA automated sequencer. 10–20 μg of plasmid or cosmid DNAs were used for transfections into L. donovani by electroporation as described previously (24Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3601-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Nuclear run-on assays were performed essentially as described by Quijada et al. (3Quijada L. Soto M. Alonso C. Requena J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4493-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) using nuclei freshly isolated from L. donovaniexponential phase promastigote and amastigote cultures. To look for RNA stability, late-log phase promastigotes were submitted to growth conditions mimicking those found in the phagolysosomes at pH 5.0 for 5 days followed by 1–2 h of incubation at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2, prior to the addition of 10 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and total RNA was extracted at different time points of actinomycin D treatment: 0, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h. Total RNA samples were subjected to Northern blot analysis using the intron sequence of the mini-exon gene as a probe. Quantitation of the SL transcripts was done by densitometric analysis using a PhosphorImager with the ImageQuant 3.1 software. To map the 3′-end of the polyadenylated SL RNA, a double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from axenic amastigotes using P1 and an oligo(dT)18 as primers. 3′-RACE studies were used to map the 3′-end of the non-polyadenylated SL transcript. A poly(A) tail was added at the 3′-end of this transcript following incubation of 10 μg of total L. donovani promastigote RNA with 5 units of poly(A) polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RT-PCR reactions were carried out using the above set of primers. The PCR products were then gel-excised, further purified using phenol/chloroform extraction, subcloned into the pCRTM 2.1 vector, and sequenced. To identify genes that are developmentally regulated, we developed a genomic differential screening approach where high density filters, each covering approximately one parasite genome, were used. A genomic cosmid library made from L. donovani infantum strain LEM1317 was gridded onto high density filters (1536 cosmid clones/filter), which were hybridized with32P-labeled cDNA probes derived from promastigote and amastigote RNAs. Comparative analysis of the hybridization signal intensity between the promastigote and amastigote cDNA probes in four series of high density filters allowed the identification of a number of cosmid clones that were much more expressed in amastigotes. Normalization of the amount of bacteria layered at each position was obtained by hybridization with a vector-specific probe (hyg). Among a large number of clones selected on the basis of their higher expression in amastigotes, 10 were related. Partial sequence analysis of these clones indicated that we were dealing with the spliced leader RNA gene locus. From those 10, cosmid 3H4 was chosen for further analysis (Fig.1 A). Southern blot differential hybridization of cosmid 3H4 using promastigote and amastigote cDNA probes revealed the presence of a 434-bpNcoI genomic fragment hybridizing much stronger to the amastigote cDNA (Fig. 1 B). The nucleotide sequence of this fragment confirmed the presence of the mini-exon gene repeat. Total RNA preparations from promastigotes and axenic amastigotes were hybridized with a probe corresponding to the intron sequence of theL. infantum mini-exon repeat that we have sequenced. Two transcripts of different sizes were detected in the amastigote RNA preparation, one corresponding to the expected ∼86-nt SL RNA and a second larger transcript of ∼170 nt (Fig.2 A). In addition, a 2.5-fold increase in the 86-nt SL transcript was observed in the amastigote RNA preparation (Fig. 2 A). To determine whether this developmental regulation of the SL transcript was in fact a physiological event and was not because of an artifact due to the axenic conditions used for parasite differentiation, we tested amastigotes freshly isolated from infected hamsters. As shown in Fig.2 B, a larger size SL transcript was detected in the RNA preparation from hamster-derived amastigotes similar to what was seen when using the axenic amastigotes. The larger SL transcript was estimated, by densitometric analysis using PhosphorImager scanning of several independent Northern blots, to represent 12–16% of the total SL RNA synthesized within the amastigote cell. During their life cycle Leishmaniaare exposed to temperature and pH changes that trigger stage-specific differentiation (26Zilberstein D. Shapira M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 449-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Elevated temperature or acidic pH has been associated with the induced expression of a number of genes (21Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 27Argaman M. Aly R. Shapira M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,28Hubel A. Brandau S. Dresel A. Clos J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To assess the role of pH or of temperature in the differential regulation of the SL RNA, different culture conditions were tested.L. donovani promastigotes were subjected to a pH shift from pH 7.0 to 5.0 for 5 days at 25 °C or to a temperature shift at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment, or to both. Total RNA was extracted at different time points and analyzed by Northern blot using the PCR-amplified spliced leader intron sequence as a probe. As shown in Fig. 3 acidic pH seems to be the main factor that induces the expression of the larger ∼170-nt SL transcript but is also responsible for the increased levels of the ∼86-nt SL RNA. This pH-dependent induction of the SL transcripts occurs rapidly within the first hours of incubation under acidic conditions (Fig. 3 and not shown). Developmental regulation of the SL RNA is specific to the amastigote stage because no larger transcript or any significant increase in the SL RNA levels were observed in stationary or metacyclic L. donovani cultures (Fig. 3). We hypothesized that the larger 170-nt SL RNA present in amastigotes might be the result of an alternative 3′-end formation or of a post-transcriptional modification of the transcript. Several previous studies have reported that the kinetoplastid SL RNA, as for most of the SL RNAs in nematodes (29Reddy R. Henning D. Bush H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10930-10935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is not polyadenylated and that it is constitutively expressed throughout the developmental stages of these parasites (30Murphy W.J. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. Cell. 1986; 47: 517-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 31Miller S.I. Landfear S.M. Wirth D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7341-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the SL transcript has been detected within the poly(A)+ RNA fraction of T. brucei bloodstream forms (32Pellé R. Murphy N.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To test whether polyadenylated SL RNA could also be found inLeishmania, we first synthesized cDNAs from total RNA ofL. donovani promastigotes and axenic amastigotes using and oligo(dT) primer, allowing only the polyadenylated RNAs to be reverse transcribed, and hybridized them with the mini-exon repeat as a probe. Because of the presence of the 39-nt spliced leader at the 5′-ends of all pre-mRNAs, a hybridization smear corresponding to all polyadenylated transcripts was observed in both promastigote and amastigote cDNAs (Fig.4 A). A cDNA fragment corresponding to the SL RNA gene was found exclusively in the amastigote cDNA preparation, strongly suggesting that polyadenylated forms of the SL RNA could indeed be present inLeishmania amastigotes (Fig. 4 A). To verify whether this poly(A)+ SL transcript was also found inL. donovani amastigotes isolated from infected hamsters, similar experiments were performed, and they gave rise to identical results (data not shown). The presence of the poly(A)+ SL transcript in amastigotes was confirmed by RT-PCR studies where a cDNA synthesized from a poly(A)+ fraction was subjected to PCR amplification using a combination of P1 (see Fig. 8) and oligo(dT) primers to amplify part of the SL transcript that lacks the common 39-nt spliced leader. A ∼130-bp cDNA fragment amplified by PCR and corresponding to the poly(A)+ SL RNA was detected by hybridization only in the amastigote poly(A)+ fraction (Fig. 4 B). PCR products hybridizing to the intron probe were extracted from the agarose gel and subcloned into vector pCRTM 2.1. Sequence analysis definitively confirmed the poly(A)+ addition in the SL transcript expressed specifically in the amastigote stage (Fig.5 A).Figure 5Sequence analysis of the poly(A)+and poly(A)− SL transcripts. A. Alignment of the nucleotide sequences of the poly(A)+ and poly(A)− SL RNAs. The 39-nt spliced leader sequence common to all trypanosomatid pre-mRNAs is underlined.

Predicted secondary structures of the poly(A)− (B) and poly(A)+ (C) SL RNA folded using the computer algorithm (FOLD). The graphic representation of the secondary structure was produced using the SQUIGGLES program. An estimate of the free energy required for structure formation is calculated at −18.8 kcal/mol for the poly(A)− SL transcript and at −21.2 kcal/mol for the poly(A)+ SL RNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To compare the 3′-end of the poly(A)+ and poly(A)− SL transcripts, we also mapped the 3′-end of the normally non-polyadenylated transcript in our L. donovani1S2D strain by a 3′-RACE assay. The L. donovanipoly(A)− SL RNA ended at position 86 (Fig. 5 A), slightly different from what has already been published for otherLeishmania species where the 3′-end was mapped at nucleotide 89 (31Miller S.I. Landfear S.M. Wirth D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7341-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) or nucleotide 96 (33Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. Gene (Amst .). 1994; 144: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison between the cDNAs corresponding to the polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated SL transcripts revealed a significant difference at their 3′-ends. Indeed, the poly(A)+ SL RNA contained 15 additional nucleotides, ending by four Ts part of the 8T-track sequence (see Fig. 8) in comparison with the poly(A)− transcript (Fig.5 A). A long poly(A) tail of at least 46 As was added immediately after the four Ts. Considering that the poly(A)+ SL RNA is ∼170 nt long, the poly(A) tail could include as much as 80 As. Comparison of the predicted secondary structures of the poly(A)− and poly(A)+ SL RNAs using the SQUIGGLES program did not suggest a significant overall change in the free energy required for structure formation (ΔG), but it revealed the presence of a third stem loop structure at the 3′-end of the SL poly(A)+ RNA (Fig.5 B), which could possibly be a substrate for RNA binding proteins. The effect of pH on the stability and accumulation of the SL transcripts was addressed. We first evaluated, by run-on experiments, whether the increase in poly(A)− SL RNA accumulation or the presence of the poly(A)+ SL transcript in amastigotes (see Figs. 2and 3) was because of higher SL RNA synthesis rates in this parasite stage. Nuclei were freshly isolated from promastigotes, and axenic amastigotes and radiolabeled nascent RNAs were extracted and used to probe the mini-exon and control DNA sequences. No differences were observed in the overall synthesis of SL RNA between promastigotes and amastigotes (Fig. 6), suggesting that the regulation occurs post-transcriptionally. Although secondary structure predictions did not suggest that the addition of the 15 nucleotides at the 3′-end of the larger SL RNA should increase its stability significantly (see Fig. 5 B), it is, however, known that polyadenylation in general increases message stability (for review see Ref. 34Ross J. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 171-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We therefore looked to see whether the poly(A)+SL RNA was more stable compared with the poly(A)−transcript. Because we showed that the maximum accumulation of the polyadenylated SL RNA is observed in cells maintained at pH 5.0 (Fig.3), we evaluated the stability of the SL transcripts under these growth conditions. In these assays, L. donovani promastigotes were transferred from pH 5.0 and 25 °C to 37 °C for 1 h to adapt in these conditions prior to the addition of 10 μg/ml actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA synthesis. Total RNA samples were extracted at different time points following the addition of actinomycin D to the culture medium and analyzed by Northern blot using the spliced leader intron as a probe. The relative amount of the poly(A)+ and poly(A)− SL transcripts present in the cell at each time point was compared with the RNA levels present at time 0. Quantitative evaluation of the SL RNA levels obtained by densitometric analysis of radiolabeled membranes using a PhosphorImager demonstrated that the poly(A)+ SL RNA was 2.5–3-fold more stable compared with the non-polyadenylated transcript (Fig.7, A and B). Similar results were obtained from two more independent experiments. The small shortening of the poly(A)+ SL RNA observed over time may correspond to differences in RNA migration in that part of the gel (not shown). In light of these results, the half-lives were established at 4 h for the poly(A)+ SL RNA and at 2 h for the poly(A)− transcript.Figure 7Relative stability of the poly(A)+ SL RNA versus the poly(A)− transcript. A, total RNA was isolated from L. donovani 1S2D axenic amastigotes after different incubation times with actinomycin D to inhibit RNA synthesis. RNA aliquots (15 μg) were applied to a 2% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with the spliced leader intron probe. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, the solvent for actinomycin D) was added for 8 h to one sample as a control. RNA loading was monitored by ethidium bromide staining of the gel prior to transfer (bottom panel). Pro, promastigotes.B, quantitative evaluation of the SL RNA levels shown inA was obtained by scanning densitometry of the radiolabeled membrane using a PhosphorImager. Values are presented as a histogram and expressed as a percentage of the hybridization signal intensity of both the polyadenylated and the non-polyadenylated SL transcripts for each time point compared with time 0. Stability assays were repeated three times giving rise to similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine whether differences within the non-transcribed spacer of the mini-exon genomic copies could account for the formation of the new 3′-end of the poly(A)+ SL RNA, the nucleotide sequence of several copies was determined. Several ∼434-bp NcoI copies derived from cosmid 3H4 were subcloned into pSPαneoα and PSLαneoα expression vectors, and their nucleotide sequence was compared. By compiling the sequencing data from a large number of clones (∼20), we classified the mini-exon gene repeats into three classes (A–C). The alignment of the nucleotide sequences of these three different copies along with a previously published copy derived from another L. infantum strain is presented in Fig. 8. As expected, the 39-nt spliced leader was highly conserved, whereas three nucleotide changes and one short deletion were observed in the intron sequence of the two L. infantum strains. However, considerable differences were noted within the non-transcribed spacers of the twoL. infantum strains (see Fig. 8). Analysis of the three copies of the LEM1317 strain showed only one difference located between nucleotides 140 and 150. Copy A indeed contains a 10-bp GC-rich stretch, which is absent in copies B and C, where only a single base pair mismatch from a T to C at position 150 distinguishes these two copies (Fig. 8). We tested whether one of these genomic copies was associated with the larger ∼170-nt SL transcript. Accordingly, we made the appropriate constructs to overexpress each one of the three mini-exon gene repeats (A–C) in L. donovani (Fig.9 A). We also transfected cosmid 3H4, which contains the three different classes of the mini-exon repeats. Stable transfectants were subjected to differentiation from promastigotes to axenic amastigotes. RNA samples from wild type and transfectants were analyzed by Northern blot using a probe corresponding to the spliced leader intron sequence. A significant increase in the poly(A)+ SL transcript was detected only in the transfectants expressing copy A or cosmid 3H4, respectively (Fig.9 B). No differences between the transfectants carrying copy B or C and the wild-type strain were observed, suggesting a certain specificity of the polyadenylation process. To ascertain these results we compared the copy number of the expression vectors in the transf"

The crystal structure of an R-state form of chicken hemoglobin D has been solved to 2.3-Å resolution using molecular replacement phases derived from human oxyhemoglobin.

Chicken Hb D differs most from human oxyhemoglobin in the AB and GH corners of the α subunits and the EF corner of the β subunits. Reanalysis of published oxygen binding data for chicken Hbs shows that both chicken Hb A and Hb D possess enhanced cooperativity in vitro when inositol hexaphosphate is present. The electrostatic surface potential for a calculated model of chicken deoxy-Hb D tetramers shows a pronounced hydrophobic patch that involves parts of the D and E helices of the β subunits.

The oxygen binding curves of chicken blood samples taken at different stages of development exhibit Hill coefficients which exceed 4.0 (super-cooperativity) at oxygen saturation levels between 70 and 90% oxygenation (1Lutz P.L.

The blood of adult chickens, as in most other birds, is composed of two Hb components that have identical β chains but differ in the sequences of the α subunits. Hb A (αA2β2) and Hb D (αD2β2) are expressed in a 3:1 ratio in adult chickens (19Moss B.A. Thompson E.O.P. Aust. J. Biol. Sci. 1969; 22: 1455-1471Crossref Google Scholar). The sequence of the α chain from Hb D (αD) is 58.9% identical to that of Hb A (αA). The large Hill coefficients observed in chicken blood imply that the deoxy-Hb tetramers associate into oligomers because the Hill coefficient cannot be greater than the number of subunits. Although super-cooperativity has not been reported for the purified adult chicken Hb components, the self-association of deoxy tetramers is known. Sedimentation analysis of chicken Hbs A and D showed that only deoxygenated Hb D self-associates. This analysis demonstrated that deoxy-Hb D forms a dimer of tetramers with an association constant of 1.26 × 104m−1 (20Cobb J.A. Manning D. Kolatkar P.R. Cox D.J. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1183-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the two chicken Hb components only differ in their α chains, it was concluded that the tetramer-tetramer contacts lie on the surface of the αDsubunit (20Cobb J.A. Manning D. Kolatkar P.R. Cox D.J. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1183-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This led to a proposed model that describes the interface that might form between two Hb D tetramers (20Cobb J.A. Manning D. Kolatkar P.R. Cox D.J. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1183-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cooperative binding of oxygen by tetrameric Hbs arises from the transition of the Hb from a conformation with a low oxygen affinity (T-state) to a conformation with a high oxygen affinity (R-state) (21Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar,22Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Luisi B. Shaanan B. Liddington R.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1987; 20: 309-321Crossref Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Much of our understanding of this process has come from the crystallographic analysis of the unligated (T-state) and ligated (R-state) structures of both human Hb A (23Muirhead H. Perutz M.F. Nature. 1963; 199: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 24Baldwin J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 136: 103-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 25Shaanan B. J. Mol.

Nature. 1960; 185: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 28Bolton W. Cox J.M. Perutz M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Heidner E.J.

Biol. 1977; 114: 385-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Although a structural explanation of super-cooperativity requires the crystallographic analysis of both the R- and T-state forms of chicken Hb D, the analysis of intermediate structures are likely to be necessary for understanding the mechanism of cooperativity because knowledge of two thermodynamic states does not itself determine the pathway between them. We report here the structure of an R-state form of chicken Hb D solved with diffraction data to 2.3-Å resolution. This structure provides the first step towards a model for enhanced cooperativity and is the first structure reported for the minor Hb (D) component of birds, and the second structure of an avian Hb (31Zhang J. Hua Z. Tame J.R.H. Lu G. Zhang R. Gu X. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 484-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The re-analysis of the oxygen binding data in the literature demonstrates a previously, overlooked relationship between super-cooperativity and inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) binding. Chicken Hb D was purified from chicken blood using DEAE and gel filtration chromatography as described previously (20Cobb J.A. Manning D. Kolatkar P.R. Cox D.J. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1183-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several grains of sodium dithionite (Miles-Platting, Manchester, United Kingdom) were added to the Hb solutions prior to crystallization. Conditions for crystallization were screened by the sparse matrix technique (32Jancarik J. Kim S.-H. J. Appl. Cryst. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2079) Google Scholar) with the hanging drop method (33McPherson A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Chicken Hb D was crystallized with a combination of PEG 3350 and either lithium sulfate or sodium acetate as the precipitant. The precipitant concentration was varied from 20 to 30% polyethylene glycol and from 10 to 30 mm salt, with a protein concentration of 20 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. The crystal setups were prepared under nitrogen in a glove box (Bactron 1 model, Anaerobe Systems Inc.) and then transferred to a desiccator that was flushed with nitrogen. The desiccator was then placed in a cold room at 4 °C for 2 weeks. Crystals of Hb D grew as plates of about 0.1 mm in thickness and 1.0-mm wide. X-ray data were collected on a San Diego Multiwire area detector equipped with a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode generator operated at 50 kV and 110 mA. The initial x-ray analysis indicated that the chicken Hb D crystals belong to the space group P21 with cell dimensions of a = 53.96 Å, b = 80.51 Å, c = 82.11 Å, and β = 104.51°. Assuming the presence of two tetramers of 66,452 daltons in the unit cell, the Matthew's parameter is equal to 2.6 Å3/dalton. A data set was collected from nine orientations of a single crystal by the method described by Xuong et al. (34Xuong N.H. Nielsen C. Hamlin R. Anderson D. J. Appl. Cryst. 1985; 18: 342-350Crossref Google Scholar). The data were collected at room temperature, with a rotation angle of 0.12° in ω, and an exposure time of 60 s. The measured intensities were processed with the University of California, San Diego package (35Howard A.J. Nielsen C. Xuong N.H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 114: 452-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The resulting data set is 91% complete to 2.1-Å resolution with an overall multiplicity of 6.8, and an overall R symof 8.1%. Because of the low signal to noise in the last resolution shell, only the data to 2.3-Å resolution were used in the refinement of the Hb D model. The last resolution shell (2.5–2.3 Å) has an average multiplicity of 3.6, a R sym of 23.9%, and an average I/ς (I) of 2.3. The initial phases were obtained by the molecular replacement method with the human Hb tetramer serving as the search model. The α and β chains of chicken Hb D are 61.7 and 68.7% identical to those of human Hb A, respectively. Both the deoxy (26Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Shaanan B. Fourme R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 159-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) and the oxy (25Shaanan B. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 171: 31-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) forms of human Hb were used as search models because there was some doubt that the crystals of Hb D were deoxy. Each of the Hb models consisted of the human sequence with all identical residues being retained and all non-identical residues being truncated to alanine. All the molecular replacement and refinement routines were performed using the computer program X-PLOR version 3.1 (36Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual, Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) running on a DEC ALPHA server. The molecular replacement protocol included a Patterson correlation refinement step (37Brünger A.T Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 46-57Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar) that allowed each of the subunits of the search model to be optimized by rigid body refinement before the translation function was performed. The cross-rotation function followed by the Patterson correlation refinement using either Hb search model resulted in a rotation solution at 288°, 45°, 348° (θ1, θ2, θ3, zxz Eulerian angles). The translation function for either model produced a clear peak at 0.407, 0.000, and 0.232 (xyz in fractional coordinates). An examination of the correctly positioned models indicated that the conformation of both models described an R-state Hb; therefore, only the oxy model, which gave a slightly better signal to noise ratio in the translation function (12.4 ς/mean compared with 10.1 ς/mean for the deoxy model) was refined against the observed data. The initialR-factor of the positioned model was 0.457 for all measured data between 8.0 and 3.0-Å resolution. After the initial molecular replacement solution, a set of 3407 reflections or 10% of all the reflections was set aside to be used in the calculation of R-free (38Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar). The model was then subjected to an additional round of rigid body refinement in which the entire model was first refined as a rigid body before the individual subunits were refined as rigid bodies. The chicken Hb D model was then subjected to 8 additional rounds of X-PLOR refinement using the ideal parameter set of Engh and Huber (39Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). During the first five rounds of X-PLOR refinement, the two αβ dimers were constrained to be identical with strict non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS). During the last three rounds of refinement, the regions of the structure which showed asymmetry in the electron density between the NCS-related subunits were allowed to refine without NCS restraints whereas all other regions of the model were refined imposing tight NCS restraints. During the last round of refinement, most of the main chain atoms of the two dimers were tightly restrained whereas the side chain atoms were loosely restrained. The first four and the last four residues from each subunit as well as the residues that form the EF corner from each subunit were not restrained. All attempts to completely remove the NCS restraints resulted in a poorer model as judged by an increase in R-free. A typical round of X-PLOR refinement included positional refinement using the conjugate gradient energy minimization (40Powell M.J.D. Math. Prog. 1976; 11: 42-49Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) followed by B-factor refinement. Early in the refinement process (rounds 1–3), both a main chain and a side chainB-factor were optimized for each residue. After the third round, individual B-factors were refined. The first round of refinement included the refinement of each of the helical segments as rigid bodies. The second and third rounds included a simulated annealing step (41Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar, 42Brünger A.T. Krukowski A. Erickson J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Between each round of X-PLOR refinement, the model was fitted to either 2F o −F c αcalc or F o −F c αcalc electron density maps using the program O (43Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) running on a Silicon Graphics Crimson workstation. After each round of X-PLOR refinement and manual intervention, the quality of the stereochemistry of the model was monitored using the program PROCHECK (44Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Regions of the structure with either questionable density or poor geometry were rebuilt into simulated annealing 2F o − F c andF o − F c omit maps (45Hodel A. Kim S.-H. Brünger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1992; 48: 851-858Crossref Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The side chains for the truncated residues were added to the model only if suitable density was present in the 2F o −F c electron density maps. The first round of X-PLOR refinement resulted in a model with anR-factor of 0.260 (R-free = 0.309) for all measured reflections between 8.0- and 3.0-Å resolution. The quality of the electron density map allowed the side chains of 80 residues (about one-half of the residues truncated) to be added to the model. This model was then subjected to a second round of refinement that extended the data to 2.3-Å resolution over 10 steps of energy minimization. Following the simulated annealing and group B-factor refinement steps, the R-factor rose to 0.261 and theR-free dropped to 0.296 for all measured reflections between 8.0- and 2.3-Å resolution. After the fourth round of refinement, six residues were removed from and 52 water molecules were added to the model. Water molecules were added into F o −F c maps contoured at 3ς using PEAKMAX and WATPEAK (46Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Water molecules were removed from the model if either the 2F o − F c density was poor or the water failed to form at least one hydrogen bond with either a protein atom or another water molecule. Following a round of energy minimization and individual B-factor refinement, the resulting model had a R-factor of 0.235 (R-free = 0.270). Additional waters were added to the model during the last three rounds of refinement. The improvement of the electron density during the last round of refinement allowed two of the omitted residues to be added to the final model. Oxygen ligands were modeled into simulated annealing omit maps before the last round of X-plor refinement. The oxygen ligands were refined with tight geometric restraints, but without NCS restraints. Least-squares superposition calculations were performed using LSQMAN (47Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 842-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) and the results were displayed in O. The coordinates for bar-headed goose Hb A was kindly provided by Dr. Jeremy Tame (University of York, United Kingdom). The plane of the heme group was calculated using the program PLANES (46Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Subunit contacts were measured using CONTACT (46Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). The surface area was determined using the method of Lee and Richards (48Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol.

The αD and β subunits of chicken Hb D are composed of 141 and 146 amino acid residues, respectively. The refined model of chicken Hb D consists of 570 amino acid residues, 4 heme groups, 141 water molecules, and three oxygen ligands. The last residue of the α2 subunit (Arg141) and the last three residues from the β1 subunit, Lys144(HC1), Tyr145(HC2), and His146(HC3) were omitted from the final model due to the lack of electron density. In other areas of poor electron density, the side chains of 4 residues were truncated to glycine, 25 were truncated to alanine, and 6 were truncated by two or more atoms. TheR-factor of the refined model is 0.222 (R-free = 0.257) for all measured reflections between 10–2.3 Å resolution (Table I). The geometry of the chicken Hb D model is excellent when compared with the ideal parameters of Engh and Huber (39Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). The Ramachandran plot indicates that 89.2% of the non-glycine, non-proline dihedral angles lie in the most favored regions whereas 9.8 and 1% of the residues have ψ and φ angles which lie in the additionally allowed and generous regions, respectively. No residue has dihedral angles in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The conformation of each residue with ψ-φ angles in the generous region of the Ramachandran plot was verified by fitting each of these residues into simulated annealing omit maps.Table IThe refinement statistics of the current model of chicken oxy-Hb DResolution range10.0–2.3 ÅNumber of reflections29702Number of non-hydrogen protein atoms4329Number of heme atoms172Number of O2ligand atoms6Number of non-hydrogen water atoms141R-factor0.222R-free0.257Rms deviation from ideal valuesBond lengths0.008 ÅBond angles1.6 °Dihedral angles21.4 °Improper angles1.6 °Mean B-factorsMain chain atoms29.0 Å2Side chain atoms33.4 Å2Heme atoms23.2 Å2O2 ligand atoms29.9 Å2Water atoms45.5 Å2 Open table in a new tab The presence of an α2β2 tetramer in the crystallographic asymmetric unit results in the generation of a molecular 2-fold axis of NCS between the two αβ dimers. Differences between the two dimers are localized to small regions of the model which were not restrained by NCS. The first and last 4 residues from both subunits show the largest differences as indicated by average r.m.s. differences of 1.1 Å/Cα atom. The residues which form the EF corner of the α subunits (residues 75–77) show small differences as indicated by average r.m.s. differences of 0.35 Å/Cα atoms. The remaining Cα atoms have average r.m.s. differences of 0.03 Å/Cα atom due to the tight restraints. The side chain atoms show larger differences. Excluding the first four and last 4 residues from each subunit, the superposition of the α1β1 dimer onto the α2β2 dimer gives a r.m.s. difference of 0.47 Å for 2039 main chain and side chain atoms. Chicken Hb D has a quaternary structure which is consistent with other R-state Hbs, but differs from other T-state or R2 state structures. The superposition of 570 Cα atoms from chicken Hb D onto the corresponding Cα atoms of human oxy-Hb (25Shaanan B. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 171: 31-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) gives an r.m.s. value of 1.0 Å. The superposition of the Cα atoms from chicken Hb D onto the corresponding atoms from either T-state or R2-state human Hb shows larger differences. The r.m.s. values are 2.4 and 1.7 Å for the superposition of 570 Cα atoms from chicken Hb D onto the Cα atoms from human T-state (26Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Shaanan B. Fourme R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 159-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) and R2-state (53Silva M.M. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17248-17256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) Hbs, respectively. As expected, the folds of the α and β subunits of Hb D are both similar to those of human Hb, with each α subunit composed of seven helical segments (labeled A, B, C, E, F, G, and H) and each β subunit composed of eight helical segments (labeled A-H). The inter-helical segments (“corners”) formed between helical segments are labeled according to the nomenclature used for myoglobin. The superposition of 141 Cα atoms of α1, 141 Cα atoms of α2, 143 Cα atoms of β1, and 146 Cα atoms of β2 of human oxy-Hb (25Shaanan B. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 171: 31-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) onto the corresponding subunits of Hb D gives r.m.s. differences of 1.1, 0.85, 0.79, and 0.78 Å, respectively (Figs. 1 and2). Both subunits of Hb D show moderate differences in the positioning of the four NH2-terminal and four COOH-terminal residues. However, these segments in chicken Hb D also show the largest differences between NCS related subunits, reflecting the increased flexibility of the termini from each R-state Hb subunit. If these residues are excluded, 133 Cα atoms of the α subunit and 138 Cα atoms of the β subunit from human Hb superimpose upon their counterparts in chicken Hb D with r.m.s. differences of 0.83 and 0.69 Å, respectively. Several other regions of the α and β subunits from chicken oxy-Hb D also differ from the corresponding regions in human oxy-Hb. The AB corner of the α subunits of Hb D forms a more helical turn than its counterpart in human Hb (Fig. 1). This difference is due in part to the substitution of 2 glycine residues in human Hb with Alaα18(A16) and Gluα22(B3) in chicken Hb D. The tightness of this turn results in a slight change in the orientation of helix B in the α subunit of chicken Hb D. The replacement of a Proα114(GH2) in human Hb with Glyα114 in chicken Hb D results in a movement of the bulge located in the middle of the GH corner. In chicken Hb D, Glyα114 is oriented with a φ angle of 42° and a ψ angle of −131°, causing a change in the orientation of this bulge, shifting the GH corner, moving the Cα atom of Lysα115(GH3) by 3.7 Å, and positioning its side chain so that it is rotated by 90° relative to that in human oxy-Hb. A third difference between the two Hbs involves the rotation of the COOH-terminal end of the E helices and of the EF corners (residues 73–84) of the β subunits so that the EF corner of the β subunit from Hb D is closer to its A helix (Fig. 2). The structure of one other avian Hb (Bar-headed goose Hb A) has been reported, also in the R-state (31Zhang J. Hua Z. Tame J.R.H. Lu G. Zhang R. Gu X. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2008328428,"Oncostatin M (OM) activates the transcription of the human low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in HepG2 cells through a sterol-independent mechanism. Our previous studies showed that mutations within the repeat 3 sequence of the LDLR promoter significantly decreased OM activity on LDLR promoter luciferase reporter constructs that contain the sterol responsive element-1 (repeat 2) and Sp1 binding sites (repeats 1 and 3). In this study, we investigated the signal transduction pathways that are involved in OM-induced LDLR transcription. In HepG2 cells, OM induced a rapid increase in LDLR mRNA expression, with increases detected at 30 min and maximal induction at 1 h. This OM effect was not blocked by protein synthesis inhibitors, inhibitors of p38 kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but OM activity was completely abolished by pretreating cells with inhibitors of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (mitogen/ERK kinase (MEK)). To investigate whether the repeat 3 sequence of the LDLR promoter is the OM-responsive element that converts ERK activation at the promoter level, three luciferase reporters, pLDLR-TATA containing only the TATA-like elements of the promoter, pLDLR-R3 containing repeat 3 and the TATA-like elements, and pLDLR-234 containing repeats 1, 2, 3 and the TATA-like elements were constructed and transiently transfected into HepG2 cells. OM had no effect on the basal promoter construct pLDLR-TATA; however, including a single copy of repeat 3 sequence in the TATA vector (pLDLR-R3) resulted in a full OM response. The activity of OM on pLDLR-R3 was identical to that of pLDLR-234. Importantly, the ability of OM to increase luciferase activities in both pLDLR-R3- and pLDLR-234-transfected cells was blocked in a dose-dependent manner by inhibition of MEK. These results demonstrate that the mitogen-activated protein kinase MEK/ERK cascade is the essential signaling pathway by which OM activates LDLR gene transcription and provide the first evidence that the repeat 3 element is a new downstream target of ERK activation."
https://openalex.org/W2017201513,"Recently, we showed that the major species of β-naphthoflavone-inducible rat liver mitochondrial P450MT2 consists of N-terminal truncated microsomal P4501A1 (+33/1A1) and that the truncated enzyme exhibits different substrate specificity as compared with intact P4501A1. The results of the present study show that P450MT2 targeted to COS cell mitochondria by transient transfection of P4501A1 cDNA is localized inside the mitochondrial inner membrane in a membrane-extrinsic orientation. Co-expression with wild type P4501A1 and adrenodoxin (Adx) cDNAs resulted in 5–7-fold higher erythromycin N-demethylation (ERND) in the mitochondrial fraction but minimal changes in the microsomal fraction of transfected cells. Erythromycin, a potent inhibitor of bacterial and mitochondrial protein synthesis, caused 8–12-fold higher accumulation of CYP1A1 mRNA, preferential accumulation of P450MT2, and 5–6-fold higher ERND activity in the mitochondrial compartment of rat C6 glioma cells. Consistent with the increased mitochondrial ERND activity, co-expression with P4501A1 and Adx in COS cells rendered complete protection against erythromycin-mediated mitochondrial translation inhibition. Mutations that specifically affect the mitochondrial targeting of P4501A1 also abolished protection against mitochondrial translation inhibition. These results for the first time suggest a physiological function for the xenobiotic inducible cytochrome P4501A1 against drug-mediated mitochondrial toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2061903556,"The substitution of arginine for glutamine at amino acid 188 (Q188R) ablates the function of human galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) and is the most common mutation causing galactosemia in the white population. GALT catalyzes two consecutive reactions. The first reaction binds UDP-glucose (UDP-Glu), displaces glucose-1-phosphate (glu-1-P), and forms the UMP-GALT intermediate. In the second reaction, galactose-1-phosphate (gal-1-P) is bound, UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) is released, and the free enzyme is recycled. In this study, we modeled glutamine, asparagine, and a common mutation arginine at amino acid 188 on the three-dimensional model of the Escherichia coli GALT-UMP protein crystal. We found that the amide group of the glutamine side chain could provide two hydrogen bonds to the phosphoryl oxygens of UMP with lengths of 2.52 and 2.82 Å. Arginine and asparagine could provide only one hydrogen bond of 2.52 and 3.02 Å, respectively. To test this model, we purified recombinant human Gln188-, Arg188-, and Asn188-GALT and analyzed the first reaction in the absence of gal-1-P by quantitating glu-1-P released using enzyme-linked methods. Gln188-GALT displaced 80 ± 7.0 nmol glu-1-P/mg GALT/min in the first reaction. By contrast, both Arg188- and Asn188-GALT released more glu-1-P (170 ± 8.0 and 129 ± 28.4 nmol/mg GALT/min, respectively). The overall, double displacement reaction was quantitated in the presence of gal-1-P. Gln188-GALT produced 80,030 ± 5,910 nmol glu-1-P/mg GALT/min, whereas the mutant Arg188- and Asn188-GALT released only 600 ± 71.2 and 2960 ± 283.6 nmole glu-1-P/mg GALT/min, respectively. We conclude from these data that glutamine at position 188 stabilizes the UMP-GALT intermediate through hydrogen bonding and enables the double displacement of both glu-1-P and UDP-Gal. The substitution of arginine or asparagine at position 188 reduces hydrogen bonding and destabilizes UMP-GALT. The unstable UMP-GALT allows single displacement of glu-1-P with release of free GALT but impairs the subsequent binding of gal-1-P and displacement of UDP-Gal.

(EC 2.7.7.12) catalyzes the conversion of UDP-glucose (UDP-Glu) and galactose-1-phosphate (gal-1-P) to form glucose-1-phosphate (glu-1-P) and UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) in the evolutionarily conserved Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism (1Leloir L.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1951; 33: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The enzymology of GALT has been intensively studied using GALT purified from Escherichia coli (2Frey P.A.

Both E. coli and human GALT enzymes catalyze the conversion of UDP-Glu and gal-1-P to UDP-Gal and glu-1-Pvia a double displacement mechanism (2Frey P.A.

Under normal physiological conditions, UDP-Glu binds to GALT to form a GALT-UDP-Glu intermediate. Glu-1-P is subsequently released, whereas the GALT enzyme remains bound to UMP. This GALT-UMP intermediate has been isolated and crystallized (5Wong L.J. Frey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2322-2324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wedekind J.E. Frey P.A.

Gal-1-P then reacts with the GALT-UMP complex to form UDP-Gal, freeing the GALT enzyme for continued catalysis. GALT does not use nucleoside di- or triphosphates as nucleotidyl donor substrates, making it unique among nucleotidyltransferases that utilize phosphates as acceptor groups (9Wong L.J. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3889-3894Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The GALT proteins are evolutionarily conserved; with an overall amino acid identity between the human and E. coli GALT proteins of 46%. There is near 100% conservation of the amino acid sequence in the catalytic domain studied here (10Leslie N.D. Immerman E.B. Flach J.E. Florez M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Elsas L.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The human GALT gene encodes 379 amino acids, contains 11 exons, and spans 4 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA (10Leslie N.D.

Exon VI is the most conserved domain, is composed of 19 amino acids, and is involved in these catalytic reactions (10Leslie N.D. Immerman E.B. Flach J.E. Florez M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Elsas L.J. Genomics. 1992; 14: 474-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To date, 131 sequence changes have been identified in GALT genes from patients with galactosemia (12Reichardt J.K.V.

V. & Elsas, L. J. (1998), http://www.cc.emory.edu/PEDIATRICS/medgen/research/galt.htm.Google Scholar). The most common mutation is a substitution of arginine for glutamine at amino acid 188 (Q188R). This mutation is caused by an A to G transition, changing CAG to CGG in codon 188 of the highly conserved exon VI (10Leslie N.D. Immerman E.B. Flach J.E. Florez M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Elsas L.J.

This Q188R mutation has a frequency of 70% among white newborns with galactosemia, and homozygosity for the Q188R mutation has been associated with poor prognosis of the disorder (16Elsas L.J. Langley S.D. Paulk E.M. Hjelm L.H. Dembure P.P. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1995; 154: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The precise pathobiology of this mutation remains unknown. The Gln188 is highly conserved and adjacent to three other conserved amino acids, histidine-proline-histidine at amino acids 184–186, which provide a binding domain and source for the initial nucleophilic attack in theE. coli GALT (17Field T.L.

These studies described some kinetic parameters (apparentK M or V max) of purified mutant proteins but did not explore the normal and mutant mechanisms involved in position 188 at the biochemical level. In this study, we used purified, recombinant human GALT proteins, computer modeling, biochemical assays, and kinetic analyses to clarify the biochemical and molecular mechanisms by which glutamine 188 contributes to the overall reaction and how the Arg188 and Asn188substitutions alter human GALT function. The computer software SYBYL (Tripos Associates) was used to visualize and model human GALT at the active site of uridylated-GALT crystal of E. coli(6Wedekind J.E. Frey P.A. Rayment I.

At the beginning of this study, the Protein Data Base file of the E. coli uridylated-GALT crystal, 1HXQ, deposited at the Brookhaven's National Laboratory was “on hold.” We were graciously given the Protein Data Base file by the authors, Drs. J. Wedekind, Perry A. Frey, and Ivan Rayment from the Institute for Enzyme Research, University of Wisconsin. All computer modelings were performed at the Biomolecular Core Facility (Department of Biochemistry, Emory University) with consultation from Dr. Kim Gernert. The bacterial host strain E. coli BL21(DE3) [F− ompT hsdS B(r B− m B−) gal dcm (DE3)] used in this expression study was purchased from Novagen. The galoperon of BL21(DE3) was disrupted by transposon mutagenesis to produce a “GALT-less” background for human GALT expression and purification in the transfected bacteria. The human wild type Gln188-GALT cDNA was cloned into vector pGEM3zf(−) (Promega) (22Flach J.E. Reichardt J.K.V. Elsas L.J. Mol. Biol. Med. 1990; 7: 365-369PubMed Google Scholar) and was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with primers GALTPRO5 and GALTPRO3 (see Table I). The amplified polymerase chain reaction product was digested with restriction enzymes BamHI and HindIII and subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pTrcHisA (Invitrogen), which allowed high level of expression of the cloned Gln188-GALT cDNA in E. coli. Ampicillin resistance was conferred to the transformed bacteria E. coliBL21(DE3) strain, which enabled 100% selection. The resultant recombinant vector was named pKL1. To ensure that no mismatches were introduced during polymerase chain reaction, we sequenced the cloned Gln188-GALT cDNA twice in both forward and reverse orientations using protocols for the ABI Prism 310TMGenetic Analyzer Sequencing System (Applied Biosystems). To amplify the entire GALT cDNA, we used primers EXON2FOR, EXON3REV, EXON5FOR, EXON6FOR, EXON6REV, EXON9FOR, and EXON10FR (see Table I).Table IList of oligonucleotide primers used in this studyPrimer namePrimer sequenceQ188RP15′-CCACCCCCACTGCCGGGTATG-3′Q188RP25′-CATACCCGGCAGTGGGGGTGG-3′Q188KP15′-CCCCACTGCAAGGTATGG-3Q188KP25′-CCATACCTTGCAGTGGGG-3′Q188NP15′-CCCCACTGCAACGTATGG-3′Q188NP25′-CCATACGTTGCAGTGGGG-3′EXON2FOR5′-GCTGGTGTCAGCTCACCGCAT-3′EXON3REV5′-TACTGGGGATTCACCTCTCCG-3′EXON5FOR5′-AAGGTCATGTGCTTCCACCCC-3′EXON6FOR5′-CCACGAATTCGGATCCGATCTTTGAAAACAAAGGTGC-3′EXON6REV5′-CAACAAGCTTCTGCAGTGGCAGTGGGGGTGGGGGTTA-3′EXON9FOR5′-GACCAAGTATGACAACCTCTT-3′EXON10FR5′-GGGGCTCCCACAGGATCAGAG-3′GALTPRO35′-CAAAGTCGCAAAGCTTTCAGGCGATGGTTGCTGT-3′GALTPRO55′-AAATAACGCGGATCCATGTCGCGCAGTGGAACC-3′ Open table in a new tab We introduced the Q188R and Q188N mutations into the wild type Gln188-GALT cDNA sequence in pKL1 by the polymerase chain reaction-based site directed mutagenesis protocol developed by Stratagene (Quick ChangeTM) and the corresponding mutagenesis primers (see Table I). The change from glutamine to asparagine required changes in two bases in the codon 188 (CAG → AAC). This was first achieved by site-directed mutagenesis of the wild type Gln188-GALT cDNA cloned in pKL1 to form pACWK using mutagenesis primers Q188KP1 and Q188KP2 (see Table I). It was then followed by the site-directed mutagenesis of the mutant GALT cDNA in pACWK to form pACWN using mutagenesis primers Q188NP1 and Q188NP2 (Table I). After mutagenesis, the parental wild type plasmids were digested withDpnI, leaving only the mutant plasmids. Both the wild type and mutant plasmids were transformed into competent E. coliBL21(DE3) by the CaCl2 method (23$$Google Scholar). The presence of the Arg188 or Asn188 mutation in the mutant plasmid was confirmed by restriction analyses and direct DNA sequencing of plasmid DNA. Both mutations eliminated the natural BstNI restriction site at codon 188. To induce expression of recombinant human GALT in transformed E. coli BL21(DE3), we cultured bacteria in 5 ml of LB broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin overnight. The next morning 1 ml of the overnight culture was inoculated into 1 liter of fresh, identical medium. The culture was allowed to grow at 37 °C until A 600 = 1.0. Then, isopropyl-d-thiogalactoside (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 1 mm to induce GALT synthesis, and the culture was incubated for an additional 3 h. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min. The bacterial expression vector, pTrcHisA cotranslates a hexamer of histidines (His6) in frame at the amino terminus of the cloned GALT cDNA. A nickel-charged resin affinity column was used to purify recombinant GALT from bacterial cell lysates using modification of the manufacturer's method (Qiagen) (24Hochuli E. Setlow J.K. Genetic Engineering: Principle and Methods. 1. Plenum Press, New York1990: 87-98Google Scholar,25LeGrice S.F.J. Grueninger-Leitch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Lysates of bacterial pellets were incubated with nickel-charged resins at 4 °C for 45 min with gentle shaking. Nonspecific binding of non-His6-tagged proteins were eluted with wash buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. The His6-tagged, Gln188-, Arg188-, or Asn188-GALT proteins were then eluted with 100 mm imidazole. Eluates were concentrated and desalted using Centricon-300 and resuspended in a small volume of glycine buffer (100 mm, pH 8.7). Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad assay with bovine serum albumin standards. GALT proteins were identified by a rabbit anti-human GALT polyclonal antibody using a Western protocol described previously (26Lai K. Langley S.D. Dembure P.P. Hjelm N. Elsas L.J. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 11: 28-38Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Assays for the overall, double displacement reaction were carried out at 37 °C in 1 ml of glycine buffer (100 mm, pH 8.7) containing 0.6 mm UDP-Glu, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.8 mm NADP, 1.2 mm gal-1-P, 5 μm glucose-α-1, 6-diphosphate, phosphoglucomutase (0.5 IU/ml), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (0.5 IU/ml) (27Mayes J.S. Hansen R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 9: 708-718Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The formation of NADPH was quantitated by absorbance change at 340 nm. The quantitative relationship between increase in NADPH production and glucose-1-phosphate released was quantitated using the Beer-Lambert equation: Absorbance =Concentration of solutes × Optical path length × Molar coefficient of extinction. In this study, the solute was NADPH, the optical path length was 1 cm, and the Molar coefficient of extinction for NADPH at 340 nm was 6220 m−1 cm−1. We calculated ΔAbs 340 (change in the absorbance) = ΔC (change in the concentration) × 1 × 6220. To quantitate the single displacement reaction solely, gal-1-P was replaced with distilled water. All chemicals and enzymes were purchased from Sigma. The microcomputer program, SSREG.BAS (steady-state rateequation generator) (28Runyan K.R. Gunn R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 171: 164-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) composed and generously provided by Dr. Robert Gunn (Physiology Department, Emory University) was used to analyze the rate constants for the single displacement reaction. This program is based on the algorithm of Indge and Childs (29Indge K.J. Childs R.E. Biochem. J. 1976; 155: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which is a modification of King and Altman's graphical method for derivation of rate equations (30King E.L. Altman C. J. Phys. Chem. 1956; 60: 1375-1390Crossref Scopus (757) Google Scholar). To develop an hypothesis for the structural role of the conserved amino acid Gln188 in human GALT, we modeled E. coliGALT-UMP coordinates at amino acid Gln168 (Fig.2). There are 20 more amino acids at the amino terminus of human GALT protein as compared with the E. coli GALT (10Leslie N.D. Immerman E.B. Flach J.E. Florez M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Elsas L.J. Genomics. 1992; 14: 474-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Cornwell T.L. Adhya S.L. Reznikoff W.S. Frey P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, human Gln188 is equivalent to amino acid Gln168 of E. coli GALT (Fig. 2). We found that the amide group of the glutamine side chain provided two hydrogen bonds to the phosphoryl oxygens of UMP with lengths of 2.52 and 2.82Å (Fig. 3 A). When arginine was substituted for glutamine at position 188 of the human GALT protein, the model identified only one hydrogen bond of 2.52 Å from the amide side chain of arginine (Fig. 3 B). However, one could argue that although arginine substitution disrupted normal formation of the hydrogen bonds with UMP, it has a charge change that might alter the local GALT conformation. To control for the potential effects of this charge change, we substituted asparagine for glutamine at position 188. Asparagine is isofunctional with respect to glutamine, except its side chain is one carbon atom shorter. In addition, when we modeled the asparagine 188 mutation, only one hydrogen bond of 3.02 Å was formed (Fig. 3 C). So if glutamine stabilizes and properly orients the GALT-UMP mainly by the two hydrogen bonds, we would expect asparagine substitution to show similar deleterious results as the natural mutation Q188R. Furthermore, if glutamine 188 stabilizes the GALT-UMP intermediate, we would expect that asparagine or arginine substitution for glutamine would interfere with gal-1-P binding and the subsequent release of UDP-Gal in the second displacement reaction but not the release of glucose-1-phosphate in the first reaction. To further investigate these hypotheses, we dissected and analyzed the two displacement reactions in vitro using purified Gln188-, Arg188-, and Asn188-GALT proteins produced in the transformed bacteria. Purified GALT enzymes, instead of whole cell extracts from the bacterial expression system, were necessary because bacterial extracts contained abundant gal-1-P (data not shown). To isolate and examine the first displacement reaction (see Fig. 5 A), we must deplete the reaction of gal-1-P. If gal-1-P is present in the reaction, the products of the first displacement reaction will instantaneously react with gal-1-P and complete the second displacement reaction (Fig.1).Figure 3Computer modeling of human GALT mutations in the E. coli GALT-UMP crystal. Computer software SYBYL was used to model human Q188R mutation in the highly conservedE. coli UMP-GALT protein crystal. The UMP moiety in the uridylated GALT was complexed to histidine 166, which is the equivalent of histidine 186 of the human GALT (see text). In A, the phosphorus of the UMP moiety was colored orange-yellow, and the oxygens were red. The side chain of glutamine 168, which was colored in orange-yellow, formed two hydrogen bonds of lengths 2.52 and 2.82 Å with the phosphoryl oxygens of the intermediate. In B, the amino acid glutamine was replaced with arginine and its side chain was colored red. The arginine side chain could only form one hydrogen bond of length 2.52 Å with the phosphoryl oxygen atoms of the intermediate. In C, the amino acid glutamine was replaced with asparagine, and its side chain was colored blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5The single displacement model. A, in the absence of gal-1-P, the conventional viewpoint for the first displacement reaction would have predicted that only 1 mol of glucose-1-phosphate could be formed from each mole of GALT. The GALT enzyme will stall at the point of GALT-UMP intermediate. B, however, if free GALT could be released from the GALT-UMP intermediate, it could catalyze further rounds of the first displacement reaction. As a result, more than 1 mol of glucose-1-phosphate would be generated from each mole of GALT. k n andk −n denote rate constants of the forward and reverse reactions, respectively. Glucose-1-phosphate released was quantitated by an enzyme linked assay by which 1 mol of NADPH was produced by each mole of glucose-1-phosphate release.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We assayed bacterial extracts of transformed ampicillin-resistant, GALT-lessE. coli BL21(DE3) for induced GALT activity by measuring the overall double displacement reaction. Bacterial extracts containing wild type Gln188-GALT cDNA had an overall reaction rate of 1338.9 ± 132.6 nmol glu-1-P formed/mg cell extracts/min (n = 6) (see Table III). By contrast, when bacteria were transformed with Arg188- or Asn188-GALT cDNA, the overall reaction rate for their extracts was 3.2 ± 1.18 or 18.75 ± 6.6 nmol glu-1-P formed/mg cell extracts/min (n = 6), respectively (see Table III). The difference between the results from the mutant Arg188- and Asn188-GALT were significant, with p = 0.00534. These results were similar to the GALT biochemical phenotypes seen in erythrocytes from normal and galactosemic patients who are homozygous for the Q188R mutation (10Leslie N.D. Immerman E.B.

Genet. 1991; 49: 860-867PubMed Google Scholar). These results also show that the His6 epitope tag fused at the amino terminus of the Gln188-GALT did not alter the catalytic function, which is in agreement with an earlier report that the amino terminus epitope-tagged, wild type Gln188-GALT was fully functional (31Elsevier J.P.

Setlow J.K. Genetic Engineering: Principle and Methods. 1. Plenum Press, New York1990: 87-98Google Scholar, 25LeGrice S.F.J. Grueninger-Leitch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) (Table II). In Fig. 4 A, the three left lanes next to the molecular mass markers contained Gln188-GALT (pKL1) eluted with increasing concentrations of imidazole (100, 150, and 250 mm). Two prominent Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands are seen in each successive lane. Theupper band has the molecular mass of the dimeric form of GALT, and the lower band has the molecular mass of its monomer. These bands were not seen in the three right lanes, which were loaded with eluates prepared from bacteria transformed with control plasmid pTrcHisA containing no GALT cDNA inserts (the negative controls). To confirm the identity of the purified proteins, we blotted an identical SDS-PAGE gel to a nytran membrane and performed Western blot analysis using an anti-human GALT polyclonal antibody (26Lai K. Langley S.D. Dembure P.P. Hjelm N. Elsas L.J. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 11: 28-38Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig.4 B). Two protein species that had molecular masses of the two protein bands on SDS-PAGE reacted with our anti-human GALT polyclonal antibody (26Lai K. Langley S.D. Dembure P.P. Hjelm N. Elsas L.J. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 11: 28-38Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because the anti-human GALT polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbits injected with freshly prepared GALT protein isolated from human red blood cells, our Western blot results suggest that recombinant human Gln188-GALT protein shares at least two similar epitopes with native human GALT from human erythrocytes (26Lai K. Langley S.D. Dembure P.P. Hjelm N. Elsas L.J. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 11: 28-38Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In subsequent kinetic analyses, we assume that both dimeric and monomeric forms of GALT are active (32Williams V.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 191: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 33Saito S. Ozutsumi M. Kurahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2362-2368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Arg188- or Asn188-GALT were purified using the same procedure and gave identical results regarding protein mass by SDS-PAGE with immunoblotting (data not shown). Purified GALT proteins were assayed for their capacity to catalyze the overall double displacement reactions in the presence of 600 μmUDP-Glu and 1.2 mm gal-1-P. We found that the specific activity of the wild type Gln188-GALT was 80,300 ± 5,910 nmol glu-1-P/mg GALT/min (n = 3) (TableIII). By contrast, the specific activities of mutant Arg188- and Asn188-GALT were 600 ± 71.2 (n = 3) and 2960 ± 283.6 (n = 3) nmol glu-1-P/mg GALT/min, respectively (TableIII). Apparently arginine substitution had a more deleterious effect than asparagine substitution on bi-bi molecular GALT reaction. We devised a strategy to separate the first displacement reaction from the overall double displacement reactions through omitting gal-1-P in the reaction. By depleting the reactions of gal-1-P, we initially predicted that each molecule of GALT enzyme would only catalyze the release of the gal-1-P and form the GALT-UMP intermediate. If no gal-1-P was available for the second displacement reaction, the overall reaction would stall without recycling the GALT enzyme for another round (Fig.5 A). If this prediction were true, only one molecule of glucose-1-phosphate would be displaced by each molecule of GALT. Because glucose-1-phosphate was removed from the reaction by our enzyme linked assay, quantitation of glucose-1-phosphate released and NADPH subsequently produced should be stoichiometric. We would then expect a ΔAbs 340= 1.0 to result from a change of NADPH concentration = 1.0/6220m = 161 μm in the reaction mixture, as dictated by the Beer-Lambert equation. Because this would predi"

We employed epitope-tagged catalytic subunit to correlate subcellular localization and gene-inducing activity in the presence of regulatory subunit or protein kinase inhibitor (PKI). Transiently expressed catalytic subunit distributed throughout the cell and induced gene expression. Co-expression of regulatory subunit or PKI blocked gene induction and prevented nuclear accumulation. A mutant PKI lacking the nuclear export signal blocked gene induction but not nuclear accumulation, demonstrating that nuclear export is not essential to inhibit gene induction. When the catalytic subunit was targeted to the nucleus with a nuclear localization signal, it was not sequestered in the cytoplasm by regulatory subunit, although its activity was completely inhibited. PKI redistributed the nuclear catalytic subunit to the cytoplasm and blocked gene induction, demonstrating that the nuclear export signal of PKI can override a strong nuclear localization signal. With increasing PKI, the export process appeared to saturate, resulting in the return of catalytic subunit to the nucleus. These results demonstrate that both the regulatory subunit and PKI are able to completely inhibit the gene-inducing activity of the catalytic subunit even when the catalytic subunit is forced to concentrate in the nuclear compartment.

The subcellular localization of multifunctional protein kinases is emerging as a critical regulatory mechanism to target activity to sites of second messenger generation or to a specific subset of intracellular substrates (1Mochly R.D.

However, the PKA holoenzyme is normally found to be cytoplasmic, and only the catalytic subunit is thought to be able to enter the nucleus after its release from the holoenzyme. The translocation of the C subunit into the nucleus is the key event associated with the initiation of PKA-mediated induction of transcription. After translocation to the nucleus, the C subunit phosphorylates transcription factors such as CREB, specifically stimulating transcription (3Mellon P.L. Clegg C.H. Correll L.A. McKnight G.S. Proc.

The C subunit of PKA has been shown to translocate into the nucleus after the microinjection of purified protein into the cytoplasm of cultured cells (6Fantozzi D.A. Taylor S.S. Howard P.W.

However, microinjection of preformed holoenzyme injected into the cytoplasm fails to traverse the nuclear membrane and remains cytoplasmically sequestered (8Meinkoth J.L. Alberts A.S. Went W.

The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is the primary route for proteins to diffuse back and forth across the nuclear membrane. Studies measuring pore permeability suggest that proteins larger than 23–26 nm in diameter, which corresponds approximately to a 40–60-kDa globular protein, are excluded from passage through the aqueous pore of the NPC (9Davis L.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 865-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 10Newmeyer D.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because the C subunit is approximately 40 kDa, this places it at the upper size limit of proteins that can diffuse passively into the nucleus. Nevertheless, investigation into the mechanism of C subunit translocation into the nucleus has suggested that passive diffusion is sufficient to explain the kinetics and apparent nuclear accumulation of C (11Harootunian A.T. Adams S.R. Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The partitioning of C between cytoplasm and nucleus is further complicated by the recent discovery of the nuclear export properties of PKI. Residues 37–46 of PKI contain a leucine-rich region that has been shown to function as a nuclear export signal (NES) (12Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). PKI appears to transport the C subunit out of the nucleus in a C/PKI complex utilizing an ATP and temperature-dependent mechanism (6Fantozzi D.A. Taylor S.S. Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. Feramisco J.R.

In this study, we utilize epitope-tagged C subunit to evaluate the ability of either the RII subunit or PKI to prevent nuclear accumulation and inhibit gene induction of a CRE-luciferase reporter. By adding an artificial nuclear localization signal (NLS) to the tagged C subunit we are able to compare the ability of RII and PKI to affect a strong nuclear localization signal and inhibit C subunit activity. Our results are consistent with the current model developed from microinjection experiments and further demonstrate that the entire RII/C holoenzyme complex would be transported to the nucleus if the C subunit contained an exposed NLS. In contrast to RII, PKI is capable of exporting a C subunit with a strong NLS, although export is not a prerequisite for inhibition of gene expression. The export process that is engaged by PKI appears to be saturable, suggesting that free PKI may interact with the export machinery. JEG3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 10% CO2incubator at 37 °C. Before transfection, the cells were passaged onto 24-well plates at 2 × 104 cells/well. The cells were allowed to grow to approximately 50% confluence. The medium was reduced to 250 μl/well 3–6 h before transfection. The cells were transfected by standard calcium phosphate techniques (14Matthews R.P. Guthrie C.R. Wailes L.M. Zhao X. Means A.R.

CTAG, NLS-CTAG, and RIITAG were used at a concentration of 2.5 ng/well unless otherwise stated.

To control for promoter competition between MT-1 driven constructs, ZEM3 (an empty vector containing the metallothionein promoter) was added to each well to keep levels constant across conditions in each experiment. Bluescript KS+ was added to each reaction to bring the total DNA to 250 ng/well. Transfection efficiency was normalized by the addition of 50 ng/well of the constitutive reporter RSV-β-galactosidase to correct for variability between wells and transfection conditions. After the addition of DNA, the cells were placed in a 3% CO2incubator for 24 h. To induce expression of the MT-1-driven constructs, the cells were grown in 2.5% fetal bovine serum supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 100 μm ZnCl2 for 12–15 h at 10% CO2. After zinc treatment, cells used in the reporter assays were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and collected. The assays were performed as described previously (14Matthews R.P.

Luciferase activity was corrected for transfection efficiency by normalizing to relative β-galactosidase activity in each sample of lysed cells. Transfections were performed in triplicate, and the S.D. for each data point was determined.

The PCR product was NcoI- andApaI-digested, and the resulting 1192-base pair fragment was subcloned into ZEM3. The same PCR-based strategy was used to incorporate the SV40 NLS to the amino-terminal end of NLS-Cwt, with a 3′ primer complimentary to the carboxyl-terminal coding region of Cα followed by an ApaI site proximal to the termination codon. RIITAG was made using a 3′ primer complimentary to the carboxyl-terminal region of RIIα fused to the c-Myc epitope used in the construction of NLS-CTAG and CTAG with a 5′ primer complimentary to the RIIα amino-terminal coding region that introduced a NcoI site at the initiator methionine. The PKIMUT construct was generated by PCR mutagenesis using primers mutating the leucines (positions 37, 39, 41, and 44) and the isoleucine (position 46) in the nuclear export signal to alanines. PCR primers were generated internal to the PKIα coding sequence, amplifying a 350-nucleotide fragment and a 150-nucleotide fragment with 25 nucleotides of overlap between the 3′ end of the 350-nucleotide fragment and the 5′ end of the 150-nucleotide fragment. The two purified fragments were annealed and then underwent two cycles of PCR without primers to complete the synthesis of the mutagenized PKIα before the addition of primers. Primers against the 5′ and 3′ ends of PKIα, containing NcoI and ApaI restriction sites, respectively, were added to the reaction, and 13 more cycles were completed. The resulting band purified product was then subcloned into the MT vector already described. The generation of MT-PKI was done using the same 5′ and 3′ primers with NcoI andApaI sites. The amplified PKIα-coding region was subsequently subcloned into the MT vector. Multiple clones of both MT-PKI and MT-PKIMUT were selected and tested. After 12–15 h of zinc treatment, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were subsequently incubated with the c-Myc antibody (Oncogene Sciences) at a dilution of 1:100 for 1–4 h. The fixed cells were then probed with the biotin-conjugated horse anti-mouse antibody (Vector) at 1:100, followed by incubation with avidin-FITC (Vector) at 1:1000 in 1 × Hepes-buffered saline. After fluorescein isothiocyanate labeling, the cells were incubated in 5 μm propidium iodide to label the nuclei. Slides were prepared as described previously (14Matthews R.P. Guthrie C.R. Wailes L.M. Zhao X. Means A.R. McKnight G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6107-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The stained monolayer was examined using a CRM-600 Bio-Rad confocal microscope. The localization of either free C subunit or assembled R/C holoenzyme was examined by transfecting JEG3 cells with an epitope-tagged C subunit (CTAG) with and without RII. When the CTAG construct was transfected alone, expressed C subunit was localized ubiquitously throughout the cell. Because the carboxyl-terminal region of the C subunit has been shown to dramatically affect enzymatic activity (18Orellana S.A. Amieux P.S. Zhao X. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6843-6846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Taylor S.S. Radzio A.E. Knighton D.R. Ten E.L.F. Sowadski J.M. Herberg F.W. Yonemoto W. Zheng J. Receptor. 1993; 3: 165-172PubMed Google Scholar), it was critical to determine whether adding the c-Myc epitope to the carboxyl terminus of the C subunit altered activity of the expressed protein. Co-transfection of the CRE-luciferase reporter into JEG-3 cells demonstrated that expression of C was associated with robust stimulation of transcription, suggesting that the recombinant C was enzymatically active (Fig.1 B). However, it was possible that the observed activity was because of CTAG displacing endogenous C subunit from its association with R in holoenzyme. To address this issue, co-transfections were performed using a tagged mutant C subunit (CQRTAG) that does not associate with R (17Orellana S.A. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4726-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In these experiments, CQRTAG demonstrated comparable levels of transcriptional transactivation of the CRE-luciferase reporter as untagged C subunit and CTAG, suggesting that the addition of the c-Myc tag to the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein did not significantly diminish enzymatic activity (data not shown). When CTAG and RII were co-transfected to form holoenzyme, the CTAG localized exclusively to the cytoplasm (Fig.1 C, lower panels), and this cytoplasmic sequestration correlated with a complete block in transactivation of the CRE-luciferase reporter construct. This suggests that the expressed C and R subunits appropriately assemble to form the holoenzyme and that this precludes entry into the nucleus, consistent with previous observations that the holoenzyme is too large to diffuse between cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments (7Fantozzi D.A. Harootunian A.T. Wen W. Taylor S.S. Feramisco J.R. Tsien R.Y. Meinkoth J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2676-2686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Meinkoth J.L. Alberts A.S. Went W. Fantozzi D. Taylor S.S. Hagiwara M. Montminy M. Feramisco J.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 128: 179-186Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In many of the cells transfected with CTAG alone, there appeared to be nuclear accumulation of the protein. This observation was also previously reported using fluorescein-conjugated C subunit introduced by microinjection (7Fantozzi D.A. Harootunian A.T. Wen W. Taylor S.S. Feramisco J.R. Tsien R.Y. Meinkoth J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2676-2686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Meinkoth J.L. Alberts A.S. Went W. Fantozzi D. Taylor S.S. Hagiwara M. Montminy M. Feramisco J.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 128: 179-186Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that the C subunit contains a weak or perhaps conditional NLS, although fluorescence bleaching and kinetic observations argue against it (11Harootunian A.T. Adams S.R. Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We examined the ability of a well characterized NLS to modify both the subcellular localization of C and its activity in a gene induction assay. The SV40 T-antigen NLS was spliced onto the amino terminus of CTAG to yield NLS-CTAG. After transfection into JEG3 cells, NLS-CTAG was localized entirely to the nucleus (Fig. 2 C, upper panels). NLS-CTAG expression also resulted in high levels of transactivation of the CRE-luciferase reporter, demonstrating that the expressed protein was catalytically active (Fig.2 B). In co-transfection experiments with the RII regulatory subunit, it was observed that NLS-CTAG still localized entirely in the nucleus (Fig.2 C, lower panels). However, although the R subunit did not prevent nuclear translocation, it did prevent transactivation of the CRE-luciferase construct (Fig. 2 B). That the C subunit was still localized to the nucleus but was not catalytically active suggested that the NLS on the C subunit caused translocation of the entire holoenzyme into the nucleus. To test this hypothesis, an RIITAG expression vector was made. RIITAG expressed alone was only found in the cytoplasmic compartment (Fig. 3 B), and co-transfection with a Cα expression vector had no effect on the localization of the RIITAG (Fig. 3 C). However, when RIITAG was co-transfected with NLS-Cα (diagrammed in Fig. 3 A), there was complete nuclear translocation of the RIITAG protein (Fig. 3 D). This confirmed that an active and exposed NLS on the C subunit was sufficient to translocate the entire holoenzyme to the nucleus. PKI has been shown to actively export the C subunit from the nucleus via the nuclear export signal resident within PKI between residues 37 and 46 (12Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). To directly correlate PKI-mediated export of the C subunit with the ability of PKI to inhibit C subunit activation of CRE-luciferase expression, co-transfection studies were done with CTAG and PKI. Initial titration studies were performed to determine the level of RSV-PKI necessary to effectively inhibit the majority of C subunit activity (data not shown). Co-transfection with sufficient PKI to inhibit C subunit activity by greater than 70% (Fig.4 B) resulted in near complete cytoplasmic sequestration of the CTAG protein (Fig.4 A). We examined the relative strength of active import and export processes by co-transfecting NLS-CTAG in the presence or absence of PKI. Transfection with NLS-CTAG alone resulted in complete nuclear localization as shown in Fig. 2. Cotransfection of NLS-CTAG with PKI yielded three different staining patterns ranging from completely nuclear to completely cytoplasmic (Fig.5 B). Because endogenous PKI has been shown to be expressed in a cell cycle-dependent fashion, we speculated that there might be cell cycle-dependent expression of export factors leading to the variability in localization observed. However, when cells were synchronized at various points in the cell cycle, the variability in localization persisted, demonstrating it was not a cell cycle effect (data not shown). One plausible explanation for variable export is that co-transfection of PKI and NLS-CTAG expression vectors results in a variable ratio of PKI to C protein in individual cells. This hypothesis was tested by incrementally increasing PKI and then observing both the CRE-luciferase transactivation and the subcellular localization of NLS-CTAG under each transfection condition. Fig.6 A demonstrates that increasing concentrations of PKI produced a continual decrease in CRE-luciferase transactivation. However, quantitation of staining patterns demonstrated a biphasic localization such that increasing concentrations of PKI shifted NLS-CTAG localization toward the cytoplasm until only about 15% of the cells exhibited nuclear-only staining. Increasing the concentration of PKI past this point resulted in a relative decrease in the cytoplasmic localization and a return to nuclear localization such that 55% of transfected cells were scored as nuclear only. This suggests that there is an optimal ratio of PKI to C for export and that further increases in PKI compete with the C/PKI complex for binding to the export machinery. It has been demonstrated that PKI inhibits C subunit activity and actively exports the C subunit out of the nucleus in a C/PKI complex. These activities are encoded in discrete regions of the protein. However, the relative functional impact of these two activities on C subunit-directed gene expression has never been quantitated. The localization of CTAG and its ability to transactivate CRE-luciferase was examined using various concentrations of either wild-type PKI or mutant PKI in which the critical hydrophobic residues within the nuclear export signal had been mutated to alanines (Fig. 7 A). Titration of the wild-type PKI showed a concentration-dependent effect both with respect to export and inhibition of transactivation of the CRE-luciferase reporter (Fig. 7). Consistent with previous reports (12Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), the mutant PKI failed to export the C subunit out of the nucleus (Fig. 7 C). A comparison of mutant and wild-type PKI demonstrated that mutant PKI was a somewhat less effective inhibitor of CRE-luciferase transactivation at low concentrations (Fig.7 B). However, with higher levels of PKI, both the mutant and wild-type proteins were indistinguishable in their inhibitory activity. This suggests that export of the C subunit may play a particularly important role in the regulation of C subunit activity when PKI is at sub-stoichiometric concentrations relative to C subunit but that export is not essential for complete inhibition of C subunit-induced gene expression. The subcellular localization and trafficking of PKA has received a great deal of attention, and several competing mechanisms have been described that may modulate this process. The localization of holoenzyme is most often suggested to be a mechanism to bring PKA closer to selective substrates, increasing substrate specificity as well as the rate of phosphorylation. It is equally plausible that localizing mechanisms could serve to place PKA close to sites of cAMP generation and allow regional changes in cAMP to promote PKA activation. Several mechanisms for PKA localization have been elucidated. A collection of anchoring proteins for PKA (AKAPs) have been described that bind with nm affinities to the type II regulatory subunits, and these AKAPs are themselves associated with cytoplasmic membranes, cytoskeletal components, or cytoplasmic organelles (20Dell'Acqua M.L. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12881-12884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 21Chen Q. Lin R.Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15247-15257Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Recently several novel AKAPs have been isolated that can also bind to type I regulatory subunits although with much lower affinities (22Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11184-11189Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 23Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8057-8064Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The Cα and Cβ1 isoforms of C have also been shown to be amino-terminal myristylated (24Guthrie C.R. Skalhegg B.S. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29560-29565Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and this lipid modification might hypothetically play a role in membrane association, although no evidence for this exists to date. The heat-stable inhibitor of PKA, PKI, has also been shown to facilitate nuclear export of C subunits back to the cytoplasm (7Fantozzi D.A. Harootunian A.T. Wen W. Taylor S.S. Feramisco J.R. Tsien R.Y. Meinkoth J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2676-2686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wen W. Harootunian A.T. Adams S.R. Feramisco J. Tsien R.Y. Meinkoth J.L. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32214-32220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this may help to terminate the transcriptional response. We have used an epitope-tagging strategy to localize C subunits that were free or bound to either RII or PKI. The nuclear distribution of C subunit was correlated with the transcriptional activation of a cAMP-responsive reporter gene. Our results demonstrate that unbound C subunit localizes to both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments and promotes gene activation. However, when C was incorporated into an RII-containing holoenzyme, no nuclear C was detected, and transcription from the CRE-luciferase reporter returned to base line. These results are in good agreement with previous studies using microinjection of fluorescently tagged C and R proteins (11Harootunian A.T. Adams S.R. Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) as well as studies examining the endogenous C subunit by direct immunofluoresence (26Nigg E.A. Hilz H. Eppenberger H.M. Dutly F. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2801-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 27Nigg E.A. Schafer G. Hilz H. Eppenberger H.M. Cell. 1985; 41: 1039-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The R/C holoenzyme exceeds the size that is capable of diffusing at significant rates through the NPC. In addition, cytoplasmic AKAPs are potentially capable of binding holoenzyme and preventing its redistribution to the nucleus. When cAMP dissociates the holoenzyme and releases active C subunit, this 40-kDa monomer is now presumed to be small enough to diffuse into the nucleus where it can phosphorylate nuclear targets such as CREB and other transcription factors, modulating their activity. The C subunits do not appear to contain an endogenous NLS, although a consensus sequence (KRVK) resembling the human c-Myc NLS is located at amino acid 189. Mutations of this sequence have been shown to have no effects on nuclear accumulation or transcriptional activity of C. 2J. C. Wiley, L. A. Wailes, R. L. Idzerda, and G. S. McKnight, unpublished observations. We introduced an exogenous SV40 T-antigen NLS onto the amino terminus of C to test the ability of either RII or PKI to maintain the cytoplasmic localization and compete with a well characterized signal for nuclear import. The presence of an exogenous NLS on the C subunit transported nearly 100% of the protein into the nucleus, and NLS-C was an effective inducer of reporter gene activity. This experiment demonstrates that the C subunit is localized completely to the nucleus when an exposed NLS is fused to the protein and argues that no endogenous NLS is recognized in the free C subunit. When an RII expression vector was added to the transfections along with the NLS-CTAG, the ability of C to induce gene activity was completely inhibited, but surprisingly, the C subunit remained nuclear. This implies that the NLS-CTAG is forming holoenzyme effectively and that the NLS is capable of targeting this entire holoenzyme to the nucleus where it remains inactive. We tested this idea by constructing a tagged RII expression vector and by following the localization of RII in the presence or absence of NLS-C. As expected, RII remained cytoplasmic when transfected on its own or when transfected with wild-type Cα. However, in the presence of NLS-C, the RII was transported into the nucleus, leaving no visible cytoplasmic staining. Despite the known array of cytoplasmic AKAPs, which bind RII with high affinity, a strong NLS was capable of transporting all of the holoenzyme to the nucleus. Although all cells appear to have AKAPs, we have not investigated which AKAPs are present in JEG-3 cells, and it is possible that if higher affinity AKAPs had been present, some of the holoenzyme might have remained in the cytoplasmic compartment. The egress of C out of the nucleus has been shown to be facilitated by PKI, which not only binds and inhibits C subunit activity but also acts as an adapter to target C to the nuclear export machinery (12Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). There are three isoforms of PKI (α, β, and γ) (28Collins S.P. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18169-18178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Scarpetta M.A. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10927-10931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in addition to the C subunit interacting domain, each has a highly conserved leucine-rich NES. These leucine-rich nuclear export sequences have been shown to interact with CRM1 (exportin 1) and together with Ran, form a complex that can be exported through the NPC (30Ohno M. Fornerod M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1998; 92: 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 31Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). Once in the cytoplasm, GTPase-activating proteins bind and stimulate the hydrolysis of Ran-bound GTP, causing the complex to dissociate. This process returns the C subunit to the cytoplasm where it is presumed to bind to R subunits when cAMP has returned to basal levels. PKI may therefore function to terminate the nuclear actions of C subunit and rapidly reset the PKA system to respond again. When CTAG was transfected together with PKI, the CTAG subunit did not appear in the nucleus to a significant extent, and gene expression was severely inhibited. The complex of C and PKI may be too large to diffuse effectively through the NPC, and the C/PKI that does enter the nucleus might be rapidly exported. However, when the NLS-CTAG was transfected with various concentrations of PKI, a more complicated pattern emerged. As the ratio of PKI to NLS-CTAG expression vector increased, the induction of CRE-luciferase progressively decreased to basal levels. The nuclear localization of NLS-CTAG at first diminished with increasing PKI, but then as more PKI expression vector was added to the transfections, the tagged C subunit reappeared in the nucleus and decreased in the cytoplasm. We interpret this to mean that overexpression of PKI interferes with the nuclear export machinery, decreasing the capacity to export the C/PKI complex. This contrasts with previous reports suggesting that the NES on PKI is masked and only becomes available when C binds to PKI (12Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 25Wen W. Harootunian A.T. Adams S.R. Feramisco J. Tsien R.Y. Meinkoth J.L. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32214-32220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One possibility might be that free PKI interacts with components of the export machinery and prevents their normal function without actually being a target for export itself in the absence of C. Because PKI acts as both an inhibitor and exporter of C subunit, we examined the relative importance of the export process in the control of gene expression. A PKI expression vector was constructed with mutations in the NES (12Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar) that rendered it incapable of interacting with the export machinery but did not affect C subunit binding. As expected, the mutant PKI did not alter the cellular distribution of co-transfected CTAG, which remained distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. However, when the ability of this mutant PKI to inhibit gene induction by C subunit was compared with wild-type PKI, we found only a slight reduction in inhibitory activity, which was most evident at low levels of PKI transfection. Our results suggest that the export function of PKI is not essential for terminating gene induction by PKA and that the role of PKI export is more likely related to resetting the system for subsequent gene induction responses. The ability of the C subunit of PKA to regulate gene expression is well established and thought to be particularly important in the hormonal regulation of genes and the activity-dependent activation of gene expression in neurons. In at least some cases, the C subunit must gain access to the nucleus to phosphorylate nuclear substrates such as CREB and members of the ATF family of transcription factors. However, because C must also be able to phosphorylate cytoplasmic enzymes and membrane-bound receptors and ion channels, it is perhaps not surprising that the endogenous C subunit does not have a strong nuclear localization signal. To terminate gene expression and reset the system, the C subunit must be rapidly returned to a holoenzyme form. The observation that PKI can act to transport C out of the nucleus suggests that it may play an essential role in the temporal regulation of gene expression by cAMP. Further studies to alter the function of PKI in vivo may uncover the physiological significance of PKI as both an inhibitor and transporter of C subunit in the cell."

We have chosen primary cortical and granule cerebellar neurons as prototype cells with different PKA composition and localization. PKA in cortical neurons is mainly of IIβ type and is membrane-anchored by AKAP150/75. Conversely, granule cerebellar cells do not express AKAP75/150 and RIIβ. The R subunits expressed by these cells are RIα and RIIα (6Glantz S.B. Amat J.A. Rubin C.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Ventra C. Porcellini A. Feliciello A. Gallo A. Paolillo M. Mele E. Avvedimento V.E. Schettini G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1752-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We have studied the activation by cAMP of these enzymes and the transmission of the signals to the nucleus by measuring the accumulation of C-PKA in the nucleus, CREB phosphorylation, and the transcription of a cAMP-induced promoter following cAMP stimulation. Also, we have manipulated the composition of PKA in granule and cortical cells by down-regulating RIIβ in cortical cells or by expressing AKAP75 and RIIβ in granule cells, respectively. The results presented here indicate that RIIβ and the PKA-anchor protein, AKAP75, amplify the transmission of cAMP signals to the nucleus and suggest that the composition of PKA might influence the ability of the cell to receive and transmit cAMP signals to the nucleus. Primary cultures were obtained as described previously for striatal neurons with some modifications (13Schinelli S. Paolillo M. Corona G.L. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 944-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, cortices of 16-day-old rat embryos were dissected and incubated with papain. Tissue fragments were mechanically dissociated and the cells plated in polylysine-coated dishes in 1:1 minimum Eagle's medium/F12 medium containing 2 mm glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. Cerebellar granule cells were obtained from 7-day-old rat pups. Tissue fragments were digested with trypsin and mechanically dissociated. The cells were plated in polylysine-coated dishes in 25 mmK+ BME containing 10% fetal calf serum. 24 h after plating, 10 μm Cytosine C Arabinoside was added to the cultures to prevent the growth of non-neuronal cells. Under these conditions the contamination of glial cells, measured by staining with glial fibrillary protein, was less than 10%. The cells were grown for 7 days and stimulated with 10 μm forskolin and 0.5 mm IBMX (Sigma) or increasing concentrations of dibutyryl-cAMP (Calbiochem). PKA inhibition was achieved by treating the cells with 10 μm of the PKA inhibitor H89 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) (14Impey S. Mark M. Villacres E.C. Poser S. Chavkin C. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). We have also found that a 2-h treatment with PKI-amide (50 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.) inhibits 50% of PKA activity in vivo. PKA was measured by phosphorylation of the synthetic peptide, kemptide, in the presence of [32P]ATP (DuPont) (3,000 Ci/mmol, final specific activity 125–150 cpm/pmol) with 5 μg of cytoplasmic extracts in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm cAMP for 10 min of incubation at 30 °C. PKA activity was expressed in picomoles of phosphorylated kemptide/min/μg of cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins (15Hofmann F. Beavo J.A. Bechtel P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

The activation of cytoplasmic PKA is shown as the ratio between C-PKA (−cAMP) and total PKA (+0.5 mmcAMP). Nuclear PKA catalytic activity was measured in sucrose gradient-fractionated nuclei in the presence or absence of 10 μm of the PKA-specific inhibitor pseudosubstrate (PKI) (16Gallo A. Benusiglio E.

Antisense oligonucleotides specific to the NH2 terminus of rat RIIβ protein (5′-CCGCGGGATCTCGATGCTCA-3′) (GenTech, France) or mismatched phosphorotioate oligonucleotides were directly added to the culture medium for 72 h (addition every 24 h, 6 μmfinal concentration). Each experimental condition was performed in triplicate. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue staining. The cells showed 90–95% viability after 72 h of treatment with oligonucleotides. 50 μg of cytoplasmic or 30 μg of nuclear proteins were resolved in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were rinsed in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) and with 10% nonfat dry milk in the same buffer with Tween 20. The filters were incubated with specific antibodies in 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h (RIIα, RIIβ) or 6 h (CREB, PCREB). After washing, the filters were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 for 1 h and developed using the Renaissance chemiluminescence kit (NEN Life Science Products). Anti-rat PCREB antibodies (17Ginty D.D. Kornhauser J.M. Thompson M.A. Bading H. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S. Greenberg M.E.

Specific anti-RIIβ or anti-RIIα antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic RIIβ peptide (peptide 31–57 from the AUG of the rat sequence) or RIIα (peptide containing the residues 53–73 from the start codon of the rat protein) cross-linked to soybean trypsin inhibitor. The total IgGs were purified, and the specificity of each preparation was tested by immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and immunoblot by preadsorbing the antibodies to the specific peptides or control peptides (12Ventra C.

Cerebellar granule cells were grown for 7 days and injected with the DNA solutions in phosphate buffer (25 ng/ml of each plasmid). The plasmid vectors used were: CMV-GFP (CLONTECH); RSV-lacZ; CRE-lacZ containing five CRE elements and the vasoactive intestinal peptide promoter driving lacZ gene (19Kaang B.K. Pfaffinger P.J.

All plasmids preparations were tested in the rat thyroid cell line, FRTL-5, and in the PC12 cell line by stable transfection. The expression of the specific proteins was measured by immunoanalyses (immunoblot, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation) and Northern blot (18Feliciello A. Giuliano P. Porcellini A. Garbi C.

The injection apparatus consisted of a phase contrast microscope connected to a computer-aided image analyzer (AIS automatic injection system, Zeiss, Germany) and a computer-operated microinjector (Eppendorf, Germany). In each experiment 150 cells/dish and 2 dishes/DNA were injected. 18 h after the injection the cells were stimulated with 0.1 mm forskolin in the presence of 100 mm IBMX for 4 h, washed in phosphate-buffered saline solution and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and after extensive washes were incubated first with the monoclonal anti-β-galactosidase antibody (Sigma) and then with fluorescein-tagged goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% skin porcine gelatin for 30 min at room temperature. In all experiments, the fluorescein-tagged anti-mouse IgG antibodies were injected alone as control of the microinjection procedures. The specificity of anti-β-galactosidase antibodies was tested by omitting the first antibody. Under our conditions the efficiency of injection was about 20%. The binding of cAMP to the inactive PKA tetrameric holoenzyme induces its dissociation, thereby releasing active catalytic subunits in the cytoplasm. We have studied cAMP signaling in primary cultures of cortical neurons and cerebellar granule cells by measuring the cytoplasmic and nuclear PKA catalytic activity following cAMP stimulation for various periods of time. We have used forskolin, a stimulator of adenylyl cyclase, and IBMX, the inhibitor of cAMP phosphodiesterases, to maintain constant cAMP levels. Fig.1 A shows the time course of cytoplasmic PKA activity in cortical and granule cells stimulated by 10 μm forskolin in the presence of 0.5 mm IBMX. In granule cells, cAMP-induced PKA activity was marked and persistent. In cortical cells PKA activation was lower, peaking at 15 min of cAMP stimulation and returning to the basal value within 20 min. The activation of PKA in granule cerebellar cells reached the plateau between 1 and 5 min and remained constant up to 30 min after the initial cAMP stimulation. The cAMP dose-response curve indicated that the cerebellar granule cells PKA was activated at lower cAMP concentration relative to PKA in cortical neurons (Fig.1 B). Nuclear C-PKA accumulation, a sensitive marker of cAMP stimulation, was very efficient in cortical cells compared with granule cerebellar cells (Fig. 1 C), although the cytoplasmic PKA activation was similar in the two cell types (Fig. 1 D). The cortical enzyme, albeit dissociated poorly, contributed significantly to the total mass of nuclear PKA because the absolute amount of cytoplasmic PKA was higher in cortical than in granule cerebellar cells (see the legend of Fig. 1). These data indicate that the granule cells PKA, stimulated by cAMP, dissociates efficiently, but does not transmit C-PKA to the nucleus. In contrast, cortical cells respond very efficiently to cAMP with a significant increase of nuclear C-PKA activity. We suggest that the composition of PKA in the two cell types might be the cause of the different responses to cAMP. Indeed, the regulatory RIIβ type is abundantly expressed in cortical cells, is membrane-bound, binds cAMP with lower affinity and has a longer half-life compared with RIα and RIIα (8Faux M.C.

The Enzymes. 17. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 43-111Google Scholar). These features suggest that PKAIIβ might be the sensor of continuous and persistent cAMP signals. The biologically relevant effect of PKA translocation to the nucleus is the regulation of gene expression mediated by the phosphorylation of the nuclear transcription factor CREB. CREB is bound to a specific DNA sequence motif (CRE) and, upon phosphorylation by PKA catalytic subunit (26Montminy M.R. Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 184-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (27Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar), binds the adaptor proteins (CBP and p300). The association of CREB with these proteins facilitates the assembly of the transcriptional machinery and leads to the activation of cAMP-induced genes (28Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). We assayed CREB phosphorylation in cortical and granule cells stimulated with forskolin by immunoblot of nuclear proteins with antibodies that recognize the phosphorylated form of CREB (17Ginty D.D. Kornhauser J.M. Thompson M.A. Bading H. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows that the phosphorylation of CREB (PCREB) was strongly induced by forskolin (10 μm, 10 min) in cortical neurons. In granule cells the PCREB signal was detectable in basal conditions but was only slightly induced by forskolin. Forskolin did not induce the de novo synthesis of CREB, because the total amount of the protein was not modified by forskolin treatment (Fig. 2). The phosphorylation of CREB was induced by a cAMP-dependent pathway, because it was mimicked by the cAMP analogue, 8-bromo-cAMP and was inhibited by 10 μm of the cell-permeable PKA inhibitor, H89 (14Impey S. Mark M. Villacres E.C. Poser S. Chavkin C. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Because the PCREB signal detected by Western blot might originate from contaminating glial cells present in our cultures, we have investigated the effect of cAMP-elevating agents in pure type I astrocyte cultures. Under the conditions described in Fig. 2, stimuli-dependent cAMP accumulation did not induce CREB phosphorylation (data not shown). To test whether the expression of PKAIIβ affects CREB phosphorylation in cortical cells, we treated cortical neurons with specific anti-RIIβ antisense oligonucleotides for 72 h (see “Materials and Methods”). This treatment specifically reduced RIIβ protein levels (over 50% reduction, Fig.3 lane 2), but did not affect the other membrane-bound PKA regulatory subunit RIIα, as shown by the immunoblot with specific anti-RIIβ or RIIα antibodies (Fig. 3). The reduction of RIIβ protein was also detected by the ligand binding assay or overlay (23Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Carr D.W. De Manno D.A. Atwood A. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20729-20732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in RIIβ antisense-treated cell extracts. Also, total PKA activity was not affected by anti-RIIβ antisense treatment (data not shown). RIIβ levels did not change in cells treated with mismatched oligonucleotides (Fig. 3, lane 1 and legend). Cortical cells treated with the RIIβ antisense oligonucleotide were stimulated with forskolin and CREB phosphorylation assayed as described in Fig. 2. In these cells, forskolin-induced CREB phosphorylation was significantly reduced, whereas total CREB concentration was not affected (Fig. 4, upper panel). The decreased cAMP-induced CREB phosphorylation in anti-RIIβ oligonucleotide-treated cells was accompanied by a parallel reduced accumulation of C-PKA in the nucleus (Fig. 4, lower inset). These data indicate that RIIβ levels influence cAMP-induced nuclear C-PKA accumulation and CREB phosphorylation and suggest that the efficient transmission of cAMP signals to the nucleus in cortical cells might be dependent on the abundance of PKAIIβ. This observation is consistent with the finding that neural gene expression and c-fos induction by cAMP are defective in specific areas of the central nervous system in RIIβ−/− mice (30Adams M.R. Brandon E.P. Chartoff E.H. Idzerda R.L. Dorsa D.M. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12157-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 31Brandon E.P. Logue S.F. Adams M.R.

To test the hypothesis that membrane-bound PKAIIβ plays a crucial role in the cAMP-induced transcription, we microinjected granule cells with expression vectors containing the cDNAs encoding RIIβ, the specific brain RII-anchor protein, AKAP75, and the green fluorescent protein, GFP. Because RIIβ and AKAP75 are not expressed in granule cells (8Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 312-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ventra C. Porcellini A.

Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1752-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), their synthesis should result in the formation of new PKAIIβ bound to AKAP75 as in cortical cells. We first assayed the expression of RIIβ and AKAP75 in microinjected cells. Fig. 5 shows the staining of microinjected cells with specific antibodies to AKAP75 (1) and to RIIβ (2 and 3). Both AKAP75 and RIIβ were efficiently expressed in microinjected granule cells. The cells injected with RIIβ expression vector only showed a diffuse cytoplasmic staining (Fig.6 A), whereas the cells microinjected with both AKAP75 and RIIβ expression vectors showed a single RIIβ spot-shaped signal in the cell body (Fig. 6), likely corresponding to the cytoskeletal and perinuclear localizations of RIIβ in neural cells (6Glantz S.B. Amat J.A. Rubin C.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Figure 6RIIβ localization in granule cerebellar cells expressing RIIβ and AKAP75. Cells microinjected with RIIβ (A) or RIIβ and AKAP75 plasmids were stained with anti-RIIβ antibodies as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test the effects of the expression of RIIβ and AKAP75 on cAMP-induced transcription, a reporter gene (lacZ) driven by five tandemly linked cAMP-responsive elements, (5× CRE-lacZ) was co-injected with the plasmids indicated above. Cells were stimulated for 4 h with 1 μm forskolin, and the expression of the lacZ gene under control of the CRE promoter was monitored by immunofluorescence with anti-β-galactosidase antibodies. Fig. 6 shows a representative picture of granule cells microinjected with the combination AKAP75-RIIβ and CRE-lacZ genes. Treatment with forskolin for 4 h significantly increased the number of lacZpositive cells. Table I shows that cells microinjected with a control plasmid carrying the lacZ fused to a constitutive non-cAMP-dependent promoter (the long terminal repeats of Rous sarcoma virus, RSV-lacZ) efficiently synthesized β-galactosidase. Cells microinjected with the CRE-lacZ construct did not show β-galactosidase signal following forskolin stimulation. Injection of RIIβ or AKAP75 expression vectors stimulated CRE-lacZ expression (3 to 6 and 2.8 to 5 positive cells). Co-injection of RIIβ and AKAP75 expression vectors resulted in a marked increase in the number oflacZ-expressing cells (4 to 14 positive cells, − or + forskolin, respectively). The number of positive cells was dramatically reduced if a mutant version of AKAP75 was co-injected with RIIβ, AKAP45, which binds RII but fails to localize it to the membranes (18Feliciello A.

Two different protein families bind PKA to the cell compartments: theAkinase anchorproteins AKAPs and the microtubule-associated proteins MAP2. AKAPs bind the regulatory subunit RIIβ with nanomolar affinity and localize PKA to the dendritic cytoskeleton and other cellular compartments (Golgi apparatus, primary branches of dendrites and perikarya), whereas MAP2 predominantly binds the RIIα isoform (5Cadd G. McKnight G.S. Neuron. 1989; 3: 71-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). AKAP 150/75, the rat or the bovine PKA anchor protein, can also bind RIIα but with lower affinity (35Leiser M. Rubin C.S. Erlichman J. J. Biol.

The levels of RIIβ and AKAP 75 differ in cell populations of brain areas and their expression pattern is strictly correlated. Accordingly, in cortical neurons, which express AKAP 75, RIIβ is the most abundant PKA-regulatory subunit; conversely, in cerebellar granule cells AKAP 75 and RIIβ has not been found (5Cadd G.

Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1752-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we decided to test if the expression of RIIβ-AKAP might interfere with the cytosolic and nuclear responses to cAMP in cortical neurons and cerebellar granule cells. PKA activity and CREB phosphorylation were measured as functional correlates of cAMP stimulation. Although it has been shown that CREB is also a substrate for other protein kinases (27Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 38Ginty D.D. Neuron. 1997; 18: 183-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), we have analyzed only cAMP-induced events. The response to cAMP signals was different in granule cerebellar and cortical cells. In granule cerebellar cells, cytoplasmic PKA dissociated very efficiently, but nuclear C-PKA accumulation induced by cAMP was rather weak. Cortical cells, on the other hand, did not activate efficiently cytoplasmic PKA but accumulated PKA in the nuclei in response to cAMP. The different PKA composition and localization in the two cell types might account for these different responses. Granule cells contain mainly type I and type IIα PKA, which bind cAMP with higher affinity compared with type PKAIIβ (15Hofmann F. Beavo J.A. Bechtel P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

PKA present in cortical cells, composed mainly of type IIβ isoenzyme, dissociates at high cAMP levels and rapidly reassociates (Fig. 1, A and B). Membrane-bound PKAIIβ might be the sensor of persistent cAMP signals and the preferential source of nuclear C-PKA in cortical cells. This interpretation is strengthened by the observation that the cAMP-dependent nuclear signaling is inhibited in cortical cells with lower RIIβ levels (Fig. 4) or in the RIIβ-defective mouse (30Adams M.R. Brandon E.P. Chartoff E.H. Idzerda R.L. Dorsa D.M. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12157-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 31Brandon E.P. Logue S.F. Adams M.R.

We have reconstituted the “cortical” PKA by expressing RIIβ and AKAP75 in the granule cells by microinjection of specific expression vectors. AKAP75 and RIIβ plasmids were efficiently expressed alone or in combination in microinjected granule cerebellar cells (Fig. 5). The expression of AKAP75 localized RIIβ in discrete spots inside the cell body close to the nucleus (perikaryon) (Fig.6 B). It is worth noting that expression of AKAP75 in non-neuronal cells localizes RII under the plasma membrane (33Feliciello A. Li Y. Avvedimento V.E. Gottesman M.E. Rubin C.S. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 1011-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 39Li Y. Ndubuka C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16862-16869Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although, we did not identify conclusively the specific compartment in microinjected granule cells, the data shown indicate that different partners interacting with AKAP75 are present in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. cAMP-induced transcription was stimulated by RIIβ or AKAP75, but the simultaneous injection of both genes markedly stimulated cAMP-inducedlacZ expression (Table I). The stimulatory effect on transcription was inhibited by PKA inhibitors (Table I and Fig.7) and dependent on AKAP75 membrane-binding domain, because a mutant lacking the segment of the protein, which localizes AKAP75 to the membrane, inhibited the RIIβ stimulatory effect (Table I). The expression of both RIIβ and AKAP generates high levels of membrane-bound PKAIIβ, that ultimately might be responsible for the stimulation of cAMP-dependent transcription. There is evidence indicating that membrane-bound PKAII is more stable than cytosolic PKAII, which can be rapidly activated and degraded. Overexpression of AKAP75 increased RIIβ levels in kidney cells (33Feliciello A. Li Y. Avvedimento V.E. Gottesman M.E. Rubin C.S. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 1011-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Conversely, cytosolic translocation of PKAII, attained by expression of AKAP45 decreased RIIβ levels in thyroid, kidney, and PC12 cells (18Feliciello A. Giuliano P. Porcellini A. Garbi C. Obici S.

We suggest that membrane-bound PKA, releasing high levels of C-PKA in proximity of the nuclear envelope, can promote the entry of C-PKA into the nucleus. We do not exclude, however, that membrane-bound PKA could also modulate a Ca2+-dependent component of CRE-driven gene expression. In cerebellar granule cells the low expression of RIIβ and AKAP 150/75 probably underlies the weak cAMP-stimulated transcription and suggests that other mechanisms could be responsible for CRE-driven gene expression in these cells (40Schulman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence indicate that CREB is a multifunctional transcription factor that can be activated by cAMP and Ca2+-dependent transduction pathways (41Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E.

As to the biological correlates of our findings, we suggest that the differential composition and localization of PKA in discrete populations of neurons might explain the different activation of cAMP-induced transcription in these cells by the same type of signal. Consistent with our data, it has been found that in RIIβ defective mouse gene induction by cAMP in striatal neurons is significantly inhibited (31Brandon E.P. Logue S.F. Adams M.R. Qi M.

https://openalex.org/W1988118936,"A primary heparin-binding site in vitronectin has been localized to a cluster of cationic residues near the C terminus of the protein. More recently, secondary binding sites have been proposed. In order to investigate whether the binding site originally identified on vitronectin functions as an exclusive and independent heparin-binding domain, solution binding methods have been used in combination with NMR and recombinant approaches to evaluate ligand binding to the primary site. Evaluation of the ionic strength dependence of heparin binding to vitronectin according to classical linkage theory indicates that a single ionic bond is prominent. It had been previously shown that chemical modification of vitronectin using an arginine-reactive probe results in a significant reduction in heparin binding (Gibson, A., Baburaj, K., Day, D. E., Verhamme, I., Shore, J. D., and Peterson, C. B. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 5112–5121). The label has now been localized to arginine residues within the cyanogen bromide fragment-(341–380) that contains the primary heparin-binding site on vitronectin. One- and two-dimensional NMR on model peptides based on this primary heparin-binding site indicate that an arginine residue participates in the ionic interaction and that other nonionic interactions may be involved in forming a complex with heparin. A recombinant polypeptide corresponding to the C-terminal 129 amino acids of vitronectin exhibits heparin-binding affinity that is comparable to that of full-length vitronectin and is equally effective at neutralizing heparin anticoagulant activity. Results from this broad experimental approach argue that the behavior of the primary site is sufficient to account for the heparin binding activity of vitronectin and support an exposed orientation for the site in the structure of the native protein.

Since the discovery of vitronectin in 1967, numerous studies have been conducted in an effort to characterize the structure and functions of this plasma and extracellular matrix protein (1Preissner K.T.

The model of vitronectin that has emerged describes a multifunctional protein that interacts with a wide variety of macromolecules to regulate physiological processes, including complement-mediated cell lysis, cell adhesion, coagulation, and fibrinolysis. Sequence analysis and binding studies suggest a domain organization for vitronectin, with its functions mediated through individual elements aligned linearly along the sequence of the molecule (4Suzuki S.

The work to date supports the assignment of at least three domains within vitronectin. (i) The N-terminal domain consists of 44 amino acids that are identical to the circulating protein, Somatomedin B. Among these 44 amino acids are 8 cysteines that form 4 disulfide bonds. Binding sites for the anti-fibrinolytic protease inhibitor, PAI-1, 1The abbreviations used are: PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; rCTD, recombinant C-terminal domain; HOCGO, 7-hydroxy coumarinyl-3-glyoxal; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect. and for cell-surface receptors have been localized to this region of vitronectin. The Somatomedin B domain has been expressed in Escherichia colias a functional protein that mimics the ability of vitronectin to bind and stabilize the active conformation of PAI-1 (10Deng G.

(ii) The amino acids 131–268 and 269–459 of vitronectin share homology with domains found in hemopexin and collagenase (12Hunt L.T. Barker W.C. Chen H.R. Protein Sequences & Data Anal. 1987; 1: 21-26PubMed Google Scholar). (iii) At the C terminus of vitronectin, a highly charged sequence interrupts the second hemopexin homology domain. This cationic sequence has been proposed to be the primary binding site for numerous ligands such as plasminogen, the complement C7, C8, and C9 components, PAI-1, and the widely administered anticoagulant drug, heparin (4Suzuki S.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4103-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A working model depicting the domain arrangement of vitronectin is presented in Fig.1. The interaction between vitronectin and heparin is one of the most highly researched topics in the vitronectin literature. In 1983, vitronectin was shown to bind heparin-Sepharose (14Barnes D.W. Silnutzer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12548-12552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that vitronectin neutralized heparin anticoagulant activity, suggesting a regulatory role for the glycoprotein in coagulation (15Preissner K.T. Wassmuth R. Muller-Berghaus G. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A search for the glycosaminoglycan-binding site within vitronectin localized binding activity to a C-terminal vitronectin fragment produced by digestion with cyanogen bromide (4Suzuki S. Pierschbacher M.D. Hayman E.G. Nguyen K. Ohgren Y. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15307-15314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another group reported that a fragment corresponding to the C-terminal region of vitronectin bound heparin in ligand blotting assays and that synthetic peptides corresponding to the vitronectin residues 347–359 bound biotinylated heparin and diminished heparin activity (5Kost C. Stuber W. Ehrlich H.J. Pannekoek H. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12098-12105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Eur. J.

Also, proteases such as thrombin and plasmin, which cleave vitronectin within the proposed heparin-binding sequence, disrupt heparin binding to the protein (8Sane D.C. Moser T.L. Greenberg C.S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 310-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 18Gechtman Z. Belleli A. Lechpammer S. Shaltiel S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the region shown to bind heparin is highly basic and contains two short sequences that correspond to consensus heparin-binding motifs that are found in many structurally unrelated heparin-binding proteins, including antithrombin III, thrombin, low density lipoprotein, and endothelial growth factor (19Sobel M. Soler D.F. Kermode J.C. Harris R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8857-8862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the sequence spanning residues 345–379 has been localized as a primary heparin recognition site, some workers have suggested that the charged sequence near the C terminus may not be solely responsible for heparin affinity. A report utilizing phage display indicates that sequences N-terminal to the cationic cluster may contribute to binding heparin (21Liang O.D. Rosenblatt S. Chhatwal G.S. Preissner K.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Specifically, phagemid particles displaying the peptides Asp82-Cys137 and Lys175-Asp219 bound to heparin-agarose and to heparin immobilized on a microtiter plate. Also, recent work (22Yoneda A. Ogawa H. Kojima K. Matsumoto I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6351-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in which nominal “domains” in vitronectin were expressed as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase indicated that the first hemopexin repeat in vitronectin exhibited some heparin binding activity. However, neither of these studies characterized affinities of the recombinant polypeptides for heparin. There has been controversy about the degree of exposure of the heparin-binding sequence in native vitronectin. It was originally assumed that the heparin-binding sequence was encrypted in the native fold of the molecule (19Sobel M. Soler D.F. Kermode J.C. Harris R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8857-8862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but more recent work from this laboratory has demonstrated that the heparin-binding site is fully exposed in native vitronectin (23Zhuang P. Chen A.I. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6858-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Confusion over the degree of exposure of sites within the conformationally labile protein had stemmed primarily from the application of varied preparation protocols that produce vitronectin forms that differ in oligomeric state. Also, the solid-phase assays in widespread use for measuring heparin binding are inadequate to distinguish changes in affinity from changes in numbers of binding sites (23Zhuang P. Chen A.I. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6858-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Peterson C.B. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Solution binding measurements of heparin with different forms of vitronectin underscore the importance of a rigorous determination of both binding strengths and numbers of binding sites for a proper understanding of the heparin-vitronectin interaction (23Zhuang P. Chen A.I. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6858-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Peterson C.B. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Only with both pieces of information was it possible to show the exposed orientation of the heparin site, with comparable affinities for both the native and altered forms of vitronectin. Is it correct to assume that all of the sequence information necessary for heparin binding is present within the cationic sequence near the C terminus of vitronectin? Does liberation of the heparin-binding sequence from N-terminal sequences in vitronectin support the argument that the heparin-binding sequence is exposed in native vitronectin? Just as it has been critical to use quantitative measurements to demonstrate the exposed orientation of the primary heparin-binding site on vitronectin, it is important to use rigorous methods to address these questions critically. A variety of approaches, including solution binding analyses, NMR, and recombinant methods, were used to address these issues. According to these studies, the relative importance of secondary glycosaminoglycan-binding sites on vitronectin appears to be minimal. Vitronectin was purified from human plasma by a modification of the original protocol of Dahlback and Podack (25Dahlback B. Podack E.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2368-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), as described (26Zhuang P. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14323-14332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Human thrombin and antithrombin were generously provided by Dr. Frank C. Church (Department of Hematology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). Synthetic peptides derived from the sequence of the heparin-binding region of vitronectin were obtained from Chiron Mimetopes. The peptides were more than 85% pure and were used without further purification. Heparin fractions from porcine mucosa with average molecular weights of 3000, 6000 and 15,000 (Grade 1-A) and the glycosaminoglycans, dextran sulfate, heparan sulfate, and fucoidan, were obtained from Sigma. Polyclonal antibodies against human vitronectin were produced at Rockland Laboratories. Goat anti-rabbit IgG linked covalently with horseradish peroxidase was obtained from Vector Laboratories. Chromozym-TH was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Urea was obtained from ICN. All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available and were used without additional purification. Heparin labeled with the fluorescent coumarin probe was prepared as described previously (23Zhuang P. Chen A.I. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6858-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The cDNA for human vitronectin (27Suzuki S. Oldberg A. Hayman E.G. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Erkki Ruoslahti (The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA) and cloned into pT7-7 (28Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar). Using an intrinsic NcoI site in the vitronectin sequence and a 3′ HindIII site from pT7-7, the DNA coding for residues Met330 to Leu459 was cloned into the pET23d (Novagen) expression vector. In this recombinant vector, transcription was under control of the T7 promoter, with an internal methionine (Met330) from the vitronectin sequence serving as a start codon for translation of the recombinant protein, rCTD. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into competent BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen). Transformants were grown to mid-log phase in LB containing 50 μg·ml−1 ampicillin and 34 μg·ml−1 chloramphenicol, followed by induction with the addition of isopropylthiogalactoside to 1.0 mm. Cells were harvested 8–16 h post-induction by centrifugation; total cell lysates were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The recombinant vitronectin polypeptide fragment was detected by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antiserum for vitronectin. For purification, the rCTD was expressed in 250 ml of LB cultures after induction with isopropylthiogalactoside. Cells were harvested after overnight growth at 37 °C by centrifugation, and cell extraction was performed by freeze-thaw, with the addition of a sonication step (three 10-s bursts at the highest intensity) after each freeze-thaw cycle. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 1/10 the original culture volume with 8 m urea in HCB (20 mmTris, 20 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and applied to a heparin-Sepharose column. The column was washed sequentially with the denaturing HCB containing 20 mm NaCl and 0.15 m NaCl. Purified rCTD was eluted in denaturing HCB buffer containing 1.0 m NaCl. Fractions were analyzed for purity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified recombinant fragment of vitronectin was stored at pH 4.0, conditions under which it exhibited optimal solubility, following dialysis into either Glycine buffer (0.1 m glycine, 0.15 mNaCl, pH 4.0) or Acetate buffer (0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.15m NaCl, pH 4.0). In the presence of heparin, the rCTD was also highly soluble at neutral pH. Equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation was used to evaluate the size of the purified recombinant protein. Experiments were performed using a Beckman Optima XL-A or Optima XL-I instrument, essentially as described (29Zhuang P. Li H. Williams J.G. Wagner N.V. Seiffert D. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14333-14343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The best fit of the data observed for rCTD in Acetate buffer indicates that the protein is a mixture of oligomeric forms, predominantly an approximate 60,000 molecular weight species, with a minor component that is more highly aggregated. The molecular weight for the rCTD monomer was calculated from the amino acid sequence to be 15,100. Vitronectin binding to heparin was measured by fluorescence spectroscopy, using a molecular weight-fractionated heparin sample that had been labeled with a coumarin probe according to the method described by Zhuang et al. (23Zhuang P. Chen A.I. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6858-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For experiments designed to measure salt-induced dissociation of heparin from vitronectin, the binary complex was formed initially by mixing vitronectin and coumarin-labeled heparin in equal concentrations of 2 μm in 2 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. The fluorescence of the coumarin probe in the complex was measured at 480 nm using an excitation wavelength of 430 nm. Small volume aliquots of a 5 m NaCl solution in the same buffer were added, and the fluorescence emission intensity was again recorded. Aliquots of NaCl were added until the fluorescence emission intensity had reached a plateau at values that were nearly equivalent to those measured for coumarin-heparin in the absence of added vitronectin. Competition of dextran sulfate, heparan sulfate, or fucoidan for heparin binding to vitronectin was measured by displacement of bound coumarin-labeled heparin from vitronectin. The fluorescence of a mixture of 5 μm labeled heparin (M r ∼6000) and 5 μm vitronectin (150 μl total volume) was measured as the starting point (F max) in the competition experiments. Fluorescence was then recorded as aliquots of concentrated solutions of glycosaminoglycans (625 μm dextran sulfate, 200 μm fucoidan, or 690 μm heparan sulfate) were added to the cuvette so that the added volume was no greater than 15%. Fluorescence emission measurements (F) were taken at 480 nm with the excitation monochromator set at 430 nm. TheF obtained was averaged for three measurements and corrected mathematically for dilution. Data were analyzed as described (23Zhuang P. Chen A.I. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6858-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Bock P.E. Shore J.D. Tans G. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12434-12443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using Equation 1 to give estimates of binding affinity and stoichiometry for the competing ligands.[unlabeled GAG][VN]′−[VN]=Kil·Kd(1−αα)+1lEquation 1 where [unlabeled-GAG] is the total concentration of competing unlabeled glycosaminoglycan; ([VN]′ − [VN]) is the difference in the total concentration of vitronectin required to achieve the same level of saturation in the presence of the competing ligand and in its absence; K d and K i are the dissociation constants for the labeled heparin and competing glycosaminoglycan, respectively; l is the binding stoichiometry; and α is the fractional saturation. Data at values of α > 0.12 were analyzed according to the equation. TheK d and l for interaction of vitronectin with labeled heparin were determined previously to be 5.4 μm and 1, respectively (23Zhuang P. Chen A.I. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6858-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Changes in intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence were used for measurements of peptide binding to heparin. Fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer model LS-5B at room temperature with a 2-ml sample and 1-cm path length cells. Peptide was diluted to a final concentration of 5 μm in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 5.0. Small volume aliquots of heparin were added, and the fluorescence emission (F) at 305 nm (10-nm slit width) was recorded using an excitation wavelength of 275 nm and a 5-nm slit width. Fluorescence data were mathematically corrected for dilution upon addition of titrant. The data were expressed as ΔF/F 0 in which ΔF= F − F 0, andF 0 was the starting fluorescence of the sample. The values for ΔF were plotted as a function of vitronectin concentration and were fit to Equation 2 using nonlinear least squares analysis as follows:ΔF=ΔFmax/2R*(R+T+Kd−((R+T+Kd)2−4TR)1/2)Equation 2 where R is the peptide concentration; T is the total heparin concentration; and K d is the dissociation constant. The same equation was also used to give an estimate for the stoichiometry of binding of the rCTD to heparin for the titrations using intrinsic fluorescence of the rCTD, as described below. Heparin binding to the rCTD was measured by monitoring changes in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the proteins upon addition of small volume aliquots of heparin. Fluorescence measurements were made using a quartz cuvette (Hellma) with a 1-cm path length using a Perkin-Elmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer. To minimize protein adsorption, the cuvettes were coated with lipids (31Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ye J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23016-23021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the titrations were performed at low pH, where the recombinant protein was optimally soluble. Protein samples (350 nm) in a total of 1.0 ml of 0.1 m Acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 0.15m NaCl and 0.1% polyethylene glycol-8000 were titrated with small volumes of highly concentrated solutions of heparin. The tryptophan fluorescence was measured after each addition using an excitation wavelength of 290 nm, with the emission wavelength set at 340 nm. The intensity of fluorescence (F) recorded was the average of three readings. Control titrations of heparin into buffer in a reference cuvette were used to obtain F 0values. The data were plotted as a function of titrant concentration and fit to the Hill equation (Equation 3) using nonlinear least squares analysis.ΔF/F0=(ΔFmax/F0*[S]n)/((K0.5)n+[S]n)Equation 3 where S is the total titrant concentration;K 0.5 corresponds to the titrant concentration at half-maximal saturation; and n is the Hill coefficient. Vitronectin was labeled with HOCGO as described previously (33Gibson A. Baburaj K. Day D.E. Verhamme I. Shore J.D. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5112-5121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The labeled protein was digested with cyanogen bromide as described by Suzuki et al. (4Suzuki S. Pierschbacher M.D. Hayman E.G. Nguyen K. Ohgren Y. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15307-15314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides were purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a Phenomenex Jupiter C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) using a Beckman System Gold instrument for gradient programming and data collection. Peptides generated by cyanogen bromide treatment were separated at a 1 ml/min flow rate in a three-step gradient, running from 0 to 40% solvent B over 10 min, 40–70% B over the next 30 min, and then 70–100% B in the final 20 min. Solvent A contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. The fractions were monitored at 220, 280, and 370 nm (for the HOCGO chromophore), and the peaks were collected manually. Automated peptide sequencing was performed at the sequencing facility of the University of Tennessee Medical Center, Knoxville, TN, by the Edman degradation method using an instrument from Applied Biosystems, Inc. Synthetic peptides were dissolved in 90% H2O, 10% 2H2O in a total volume of 500 μl yielding a final concentration of 9 mm. The pH of the sample was adjusted to 5.0 ± 0.1 to reduce exchange rates for exchangeable protons. Peptides were deuterated by repeated lyophilization and dissolution in2H2O for studies involving nonexchangeable protons only. The pH values of the solutions in2H2O are reported without correction of the pH-meter readings. A heparin-peptide complex was prepared by adding heparin in a single addition to give a final heparin concentration in slight excess over that of the peptide. All 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a wide bore Bruker AMX 400 spectrometer operating at 400 MHz for protons. Standard two-dimensional 1H-1H COSY, DQF COSY, NOESY, and HOHAHA (34Bax A. Davis D.G. J.

Soc. 1985; 107: 2820-2821Crossref Scopus (1073) Google Scholar) data sets were collected in the phase-sensitive mode using the time proportional phase increment method (37Marion D. Wutrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar). 2K data points were recorded in t 2for each of 221–364 t 1 values, with 128 transients per t 1 increment. The spectral width was 4032 Hz. The HOHAHA pulse program contained an MLEV 17 spin lock sequence (34Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Res. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) which was preceded and followed by two 2.5-ms trim pulses. NOESY spectra were recorded with mixing times of 200, 250, 300, and 400 ms. All mixing times were varied randomly by 5%. HOHAHA experiments were recorded with 4 mixing times ranging from 24.2 to 101 ms (including trim pulses). The data were zero-filled to 1K points int 1 and were multiplied by a shifted sin (for COSY) or (sin)2 (for NOESY, ROESY, HOHAHA) window function before Fourier transformation. Phase corrections and base-line corrections were performed in both dimensions. The rate of inactivation of thrombin by the protease inhibitor, antithrombin, in the presence of heparin was measured continuously using the chromogenic thrombin substrate, Chromozym-TH (38Peterson C.B. Blackburn M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7559-7566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in a 1-ml reaction volume in acrylic cuvettes (Sarstedt) at 23 °C in a buffer of 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 mNaCl and 0.1% polyethylene glycol-8000. Heparin with an average molecular weight of 6,000 was used in the reactions at a concentration of 66.0 nm. The initial concentrations of Chromozym-TH, thrombin, and antithrombin were held constant at 0.19 mm, 2.0 nm, and 60.0 nm, respectively. Varying concentrations of rCTD in 8.0 m urea were mixed with heparin prior to dilution into the reaction mixture in order to ensure solubility. The urea concentration was maintained at 0.8 mfor all reactions by adding necessary volumes of 8.0 murea. Pseudo-first order rates of reaction (K app) were determined by non-linear least squares analysis using the IGOR software package (Wavemetrics, Oswego, OR). These data were plotted against the concentration of vitronectin or rCTD, and the K i was determined from the concentration of vitronectin that reduced theK app by 50%. The K i values for plasma-derived vitronectin were the same in 0 and 0.8 murea, indicating that the low urea concentration used in the assay did not affect the interaction between heparin and vitronectin. Additionally, unfolding studies indicate that vitronectin structure is not affected at this low urea concentration (26Zhuang P. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1999350630,"The development of new strategies for thein vivo modification of eukaryotic genomes has become an important objective of current research. Site-specific recombination has proven useful, as it allows controlled manipulation of murine, plant, and yeast genomes. Here we provide the first evidence that the prokaryotic site-specific recombinase (β-recombinase), which catalyzes only intramolecular recombination, is active in eukaryotic environments. β-Recombinase, encoded by the β gene of the Gram-positive broad host range plasmid pSM19035, has been functionally expressed in eukaryotic cell lines, demonstrating high avidity for the nuclear compartment and forming a clear speckled pattern when assayed by indirect immunofluorescence. In simian COS-1 cells, transient β-recombinase expression promoted deletion of a DNA fragment lying between two directly oriented specific recognition/crossing over sequences (six sites) located as an extrachromosomal DNA substrate. The same result was obtained in a recombination-dependent lacZ activation system tested in a cell line that stably expresses the β-recombinase protein. In stable NIH/3T3 clones bearing different number of copies of the target sequences integrated at distinct chromosomal locations, transient β-recombinase expression also promoted deletion of the intervening DNA, independently of the insertion position of the target sequences. The utility of this new recombination tool for the manipulation of eukaryotic genomes, used either alone or in combination with the other recombination systems currently in use, is discussed.

The utility of this new recombination tool for the manipulation of eukaryotic genomes, used either alone or in combination with the other recombination systems currently in use, is discussed. Several methods have been developed allowing the manipulation of mammalian genomes in order to elucidate the relevance and function of particular genes of interest. Among them, the development of transgenic mouse strains and gene targeting technologies has been particularly useful (1Brandon E.P. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 2Brandon E.P. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 758-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These techniques have experienced a new advance with the characterization and application of site-specific recombinases (3Kilby N.J. Snaith M.R. Murray J.A. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Site-specific recombinases can be clustered into two major families. The Int family comprises those enzymes that catalyze recombination between sites located either in the same DNA molecule (resolution and inversion) or in separate DNA molecules (integration) (4Sauer B. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 890-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 5Dymecki S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 2363-2376Google Scholar). The latter property has been exploited to allow targeted insertion of specific sequences at precise locations (8Sauer B. Henderson N. New Biol. 1990; 2: 441-449PubMed Google Scholar, 9Fukushige S. Sauer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7905-7909Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The recombinases currently used to manipulate mammalian genomes are mainly the Cre and Flp proteins, both members of the Int family (3Kilby N.J. Snaith M.R. Murray J.A. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The target sequences for these enzymes, loxP sites for the Cre enzyme and FRT for Flp, consist of a short inverted repeat to which the protein binds. The recombination process is operative through long distances (up to 70 kilobases) in the genome. Using these enzymes, several authors have reported site- and tissue-specific DNA recombination in murine models (10DiSanto J.P. Muller W. Guy G.D. Fischer A. Rajewsky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 11Gu H. Marth J.D. Orban P.C. Mossmann H. Rajewsky K.

For instance, expression of Cre from the lck proximal promoter leads to specific recombination in thymus (10DiSanto J.P. Muller W. Guy G.D. Fischer A. Rajewsky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). The gene encoding DNA polymerase β has been tissue-specifically deleted using the same strategy (11Gu H. Marth J.D. Orban P.C. Mossmann H. Rajewsky K. Science. 1994; 265: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). In a different approach, the SV40 tumor antigens have been specifically activated in the lenses of mice, resulting in tumors at that location and not in the rest of the animal (17Pichel J.G. Lakso M. Westphal H. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3333-3342PubMed Google Scholar). The Cre-loxPstrategy has also been used in combination with inducible promoters, as in the case of an interferon-responsive promoter that was used to provoke gene ablation in liver with high efficiency and, to a lesser extent, in other tissues (12Kuhn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). The second family of recombinases includes those enzymes that catalyze recombination only when the sites are located in the same DNA molecule (resolution and/or inversion); they are collectively termed resolvases/invertases (18Grindley N.D.F. Nucleic Acids Mol. Biol. 1994; 8: 236-267Crossref Google Scholar). β-Recombinase, which belongs to this family, catalyzes exclusively intramolecular deletions and inversions of DNA sequences located between two target sites for the recombinase, called six sites (19Rojo F. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Alonso J.C. Weise F. Rojo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2938-2945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Each six site comprises 90 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction.1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction. (see Fig. 1) and is composed of two subsites, termed I and II, to which the recombinase binds (19Rojo F. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Rojo F. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3181-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). β-Recombinase is encoded by the β gene of the Gram-positive broad host range plasmid pSM19035 (22Ceglowski P. Boitsov A. Chai S. Alonso J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 136: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Rojo F. Weise F. Alonso J.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study, we have explored the use of the prokaryotic site-specific β-recombinase for the manipulation of mammalian genomes. We describe the cloning and expression in eukaryotic cells of the gene coding for β-recombinase and show its ability to catalyze site-specific resolution (deletion) of DNA sequences when the target sequences are either in a plasmid (extrachromosomal target) introduced into the cell by transfection or integrated in the genome as chromatin-associated structures at several locations. The possible applications and potential advantages of this new system, specifically in combination with those already in use, are discussed. Plasmids pBT338 and pCB8, carrying either one or two directly oriented six sites (19Rojo F. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and pLXSN, which carries the resistance marker for neomycin (G418) (24Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7 (984–986, 989–990): 980-982PubMed Google Scholar), have been previously described. A eukaryotic expression vector with the SV40 early promoter, pSV2 (25Mulligan R.C. Howard B.H. Berg P. Nature. 1979; 277: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. J. Ortı́n (Centro Nacional de Biotecnologı́a). The expression plasmid pSVβ2 was constructed by PCR amplification of the coding sequence for the β gene from plasmid pBT233 (22Ceglowski P. Boitsov A. Chai S. Alonso J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 136: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The primers used for PCR were as follows: betaUP, 5′-GAGAGAAAGCTTGGTTGGTTGAAAATGGCT-3′; and betaDO, 5′-GAGAGATGATCAGTACTCATTAACTATCCC-3′. These oligonucleotides contain restriction sites for HindIII and BclI, respectively, which were used to clone the amplified gene in the pSV2 vector following standard methods (26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Since BclI is sensitive to methylation, the pSV2 plasmid was isolated from the BZ101 (dam−) bacterial strain. The relevant structures are depicted in Fig. 1. Transient expression assays were performed in the simian COS-1 cell line, kindly provided by Dr. J. Ortı́n. Stable clones with the DNA substrate for β-recombinase integrated at different chromatin sites were established in the murine cell line NIH/3T3. Both cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Cultek, Madrid, Spain), 2 mm l-glutamine (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and the antibiotics streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml; Sigma) and penicillin (100 units/ml; Sigma). The transient expression experiments were performed in COS-1 cells by DEAE-dextran transfection as described (26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and the extrachromosomal DNA was extracted using the method described by Hirt (27Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar). In brief, cell pellets were lysed with SDS (Merck) and treated with proteinase K (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) at 37 °C. The genomic DNA was precipitated with 1 m NaCl (Merck). Upon centrifugation, the supernatant was phenol-extracted, and plasmid DNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in water for further experiments. Stable cell clones with pCB8 DNA randomly inserted at different genome sites were obtained by electroporation, in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser, of 2 × 106 NIH/3T3 cells at 220 V and 960 microfarads with 20 μg of pCB8 DNA and pLXSN DNA at a 10:1 ratio. Transfected cells were selected with 1 mg/ml G418 (Sigma) for ∼2 weeks. The stable clones obtained were analyzed in Southern experiments (26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) or by immunofluorescence as described below. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the purified β-recombinase were obtained by conventional techniques (26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). β-Recombinase was detected by indirect immunofluorescence or by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. Transfected cells were cultured on coverslips. After 48 h, cells were fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1) at −20 °C for 5 min, air-dried, and rehydrated with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-β-recombinase antibodies (1:5000 dilution) at room temperature for 30 min, washed three times for 5 min with phosphate-buffered saline, and reincubated with a fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgM antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 1 h at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were mounted on microscope slides and photographed in a fluorescence microscope. For immunoblotting analysis, transiently transfected cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (137 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS; Merck). The lysed fraction was separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel; blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad); and incubated with polyclonal anti-β-recombinase antibodies, previously blocked with COS-1 total cell lysate (1:500 dilution). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgM antibody (Dako) was used as secondary antibody. Membranes were processed using the ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Aylesbury, United Kingdom). Subcellular fractionation was performed by detergent lysis of transiently transfected cells essentially as follows. 48 h after transfection, cells were trypsinized, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested by centrifugation. Each cell pellet was resuspended in TM-2 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 5 min. Then, Triton X-100 was added to each pellet to a final concentration of 0.5% and incubated on ice for 5 min. Cells were sheared by gentle pipetting, monitoring the appearance of free nuclei in a phase-contrast microscope. When essentially all nuclei were free of cytoplasmic tags, they were collected by centrifugation. The proteins of the cytoplasmic fraction were stored frozen for further Western analysis. The nuclei were washed twice with TM-2 buffer, and the proteins were extracted as described before. β-Recombinase detection was performed on Western blots as described. A monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma) was used as a marker for cytoplasmic fraction detection. Alternatively, the presence of nuclear fraction proteins was monitored with a monoclonal anti-histone antibody (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgM antibody (Dako) was used as secondary antibody for both purposes. PCR was performed with the GeneAmp PCR System 2400 from Perkin-Elmer equipped with a heating cover. Each reaction was carried out using 0.5 μg of genomic DNA or one-tenth of the Hirt preparation according to the supplier's instructions. Taq polymerase (2.5 units; Perkin-Elmer) was added with Perfect Match PCR Enhancer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) after an initial denaturation (94 °C, 10 min). The procedure (Touch-Down) was thereafter performed as follows: 80 °C for 2 min, five cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 1 min) and annealing/extension (72 °C, 2 min), and five cycles of 1 min at 94 °C and 2 min at 70 °C. This was coupled to 25 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 1 min), annealing (68 °C, 30 s), and extension (72 °C, 2 min) and one additional extension step at 72 °C for 5 min. For the PCR analysis of the Hirt preparations, we used the 16-mer reverse sequencing primer (No. 1201) and the 17-mer universal sequencing primer (No. 1211) from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). These primers are hereafter referred to as a and b, respectively. The primers used for PCR amplification of the Hirt preparations were unsuitable for the analysis of genomic DNA preparations (lowT m). A new pair of primers was thus designed: pBT338UP158, 5′-CCGGCTCGTATGTTGTGTGGAAT-3′; and pBT338DO802, 5′-TGGCGAAAGGGGGATGTGCTG-3′. These primers are hereafter referred to as a′ and b′, respectively. Southern analysis of the PCR products was performed by blotting the DNA separated on agarose gels onto nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Filters were hybridized at 42 °C in 250 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 50% formamide, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 7% SDS and washed in 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 30 min, at least twice. The washing temperature was increased when needed. The radioactive labeling of probes was performed with the Prime-It random primer labeling kit (Stratagene). Nucleotide sequences from the PCR bands of interest were determined by automated fluorescent sequencing and were analyzed using Seq-Ed 1.0.3 software (Applied Biosystems Inc.). To obtain further evidence of recombination due to β-recombinase, a recombination-dependent gene expression system was constructed, as depicted in Fig. 5, for the reporter genelacZ. For analysis of β-galactosidase expression, plasmids were transiently transfected in a cell line constitutively expressing β-recombinase activity, 2V. Dı́az, F. Rojo, C. Martínez-A., J. C. Alonso, and A. Bernad, manuscript in preparation.and 48 h after transfection, the proteins were extracted according to the protocol from Luminescent β-galactosidase detection kit II (CLONTECH). lacZ gene expression was measured in a scintillation counter for each condition. The coding sequence for β-recombinase was cloned in the pSV2 vector under the control of the SV40 early promoter. A control plasmid that does not contain the β-gene was also generated during this process (pSVc). The resulting constructs, pSVβ2 (Fig.1 B) and pSVc, respectively, were transiently transfected in COS-1 cells, which express SV40 T-antigen. Under these conditions, the expression from plasmids that contain the SV40 early promoter (included in pSVβ2) is amplified. Transiently transfected cells were stained with rabbit polyclonal anti-β-recombinase antibodies. Fluorescence microscopy of the pSVβ2-transfected cells showed a strong speckled signal located specifically in the cell nucleus (Fig. 2,D and E). However, very faint staining was detected in the mock and control transfections (Fig. 2, Aand B, respectively) as well as in pSVβ2-transfected cells incubated first with preimmune rabbit serum instead of the polyclonal anti-β-recombinase antibodies (Fig. 2 C). Similar results were obtained when expression was tested by immunoblotting (Fig.2 F). A specific 25-kDa band, with a mobility corresponding to that of purified β-protein (Fig. 2 F, c lane), was developed by the anti-β-recombinase antibodies when COS-1 cells were transfected with the pSVβ2 plasmid (+lane), but not in the mock-transfected cells (−lane). Definitive evidence for the preferential nuclear location of β-recombinase was provided by subcellular fractionation experiments. As shown in Fig. 3, the specific band corresponding to β-recombinase appeared only on the nuclear enriched fraction of the pSVβ2-transfected cells.Figure 3Nuclear localization of β-recombinase detected by subcellular fractionation of nuclei and cytoplasm. COS-1 cells were transfected with the indicated constructs. After 48 h, cells were harvested and lysed as described under “Experimental Procedures” to prepare the nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) fractions. The proteins from each fraction/condition were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15 μg/lane) and blotted. Shown are three autoradiographs of the Western blots corresponding to anti-β-recombinase, anti-β-actin, and anti-histones primary antibodies, incubated separately using the same membrane (stripped after each blotting) and developed with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgM antibodies.

Additional experiments with stable β-recombinase-expressing clones showed the same cellular distribution, without affecting cellular viability. 3V. Dı́az, F. Rojo, C. Martínez-A., J. C. Alonso, and A. Bernad, unpublished results. Unlike integrases with simple recombination sites, such as Cre and Flp, which catalyze inter- and intramolecular recombination and do not require additional protein factors (4Sauer B.

C.1996: 2363-2376Google Scholar), β-recombinase catalyzes intramolecular recombination and has a strict requirement for a chromatin-associated protein to mediate DNA recombination (19Rojo F. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Alonso J.C. Weise F. Rojo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2938-2945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). β-Recombinase binds to the six sites and, with the help of a chromatin-associated protein, promotes strand exchange (Fig. 1 A). The accessory factor is a chromatin-associated protein such as prokaryotic HU or eukaryotic HMG1 protein (20Alonso J.C. Weise F. Rojo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2938-2945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Alonso J.C. Gutiérrez C. Rojo F. Mol.

Biochem. 1997; 249: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To determine whether eukaryotic cells could provide this host factor, recombination activity due to β-recombinase was first tested by transient cotransfections in COS-1 cells with plasmids pSVβ2 (bearing the β-recombinase gene) and pCB8 (the substrate DNA containing two target sites for β-recombinase in direct orientation flanking thexylE gene; see Fig. 1 B). Upon recombination, two derivatives of pCB8, with a single six site each, should be obtained. The presence of one of these recombination products can be easily monitored by PCR amplification of Hirt extracts using primers complementary to the sequences located upstream of one of thesix sites (primer a in Fig. 1 B and under “Experimental Procedures”) and downstream of the secondsix site (primer b in Fig. 1 B and under “Experimental Procedures”). In pCB8, these two primers hybridize to sequences located >2.7 kilobases apart. Under our PCR conditions, this fragment was not efficiently amplified; nevertheless, a 555-bp DNA segment should be amplified from the recombination product. A band of similar length should be obtained when using the same primers and plasmid pBT338 as template, which contains a single six site and was used as positive control (Fig. 1 B). After transfection of the COS-1 cells (48 h), the extrachromosomal fraction (Hirt extraction) of the cells was therefore purified, and the presence of recombination products was analyzed by PCR. An amplified band of the expected length (555 bp) was observed only when both pCB8 and pSVβ2 plasmids were cotransfected (Fig. 4); this band was absent when the two DNAs were transfected separately or when pCB8 was cotransfected with pSVc, the negative control plasmid. The specificity of the amplified band was further confirmed by Southern hybridization (Fig. 4, lower panel) with a probe specific for the six site (see Fig. 1 A). A positive signal of the correct size was detected only in the positive control lane (Fig. 4, pBT338 (+))and in the pCB8/pSVβ2 cotransfection sample. In lanes corresponding to transfections containing the pSVβ2 plasmid, the additional band of smaller size detected on the agarose gel was demonstrated to be nonspecific, as it did not hybridize to the probe containing the six site sequence. These results indicate that β-recombinase is active in a eukaryotic environment, using the machinery/factors provided by the host cell. To provide further experimental evidence of the β-recombinase-mediated process in eukaryotic cells, a new set of vectors was constructed for recombination-activated gene expression (Fig. 5 A). The assay vector consisted of the lacZ gene separated from the SV40 early promoter by the pac gene (which confers resistance to puromycin in bacteria and eukaryotic cells) flanked by twosix sites in direct orientation. Upon recombination, thepac gene should be excised from the plasmid, leaving thelacZ gene under the control of the SV40 promoter, thus rendering expression of β-galactosidase activity. This reporter gene can easily be monitored and quantified in cell extracts. The negative control (plasmid pPursixgal) lacks the first six site and is not a suitable substrate for recombination. A positive control (plasmid pgal) was obtained by in vitro recombination (19Rojo F. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) of the Recombiner plasmid using purified β-recombinase and further isolation and characterization. Upon transfection of these plasmids in a stable β-recombinase-expressing cell line, the whole protein fraction was extracted from each condition and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. As shown in Fig. 5 B, transfection of the Recombiner construct promoted β-galactosidase expression several orders of magnitude higher than the mock and pPursixgal transfections, indicating that recombination had occurred on that substrate. Equivalent transfection experiments on the parental cell line not expressing β-recombinase rendered no detectable β-galactosidase activity, demonstrating β-recombinase dependence of the measured activity. However, the β-galactosidase activity induced by transfection of the Recombiner construct was not in the same range as the one obtained with the positive control (pgal transfection). One plausible reason for this result could be that recombination occurs in a time period close to that used in the experimental conditions. Since pgal is already recombined, expression of β-galactosidase from this plasmid occurs early after transfection. This is not the case of Recombiner, which has to become recombined prior to lacZ gene expression. As a result, the number of cells with recombined plasmid is less in Recombiner transfection 48 h later than in pgal transfection, and therefore, β-galactosidase accumulation is reduced. The need of supercoiled DNA has been described as a critical condition for β-recombinase-mediated deletions between two directly oriented six sites (20Alonso J.C. Weise F. Rojo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2938-2945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To explore whether β-recombinase can promote DNA rearrangement when two sixsites form part of the chromatin structure, we established NIH/3T3 cell clones in which the pCB8 construct was integrated at different locations within the mammalian genome. Several stable clones were analyzed by Southern hybridization. Five of them, each carrying a different copy number of the substrate plasmid (5–75) (data not shown), were chosen for transient transfection with the β-recombinase expression plasmid pSVβ2. The presence of recombination products was determined by PCR of genomic DNA preparations using two primers (pBT338UP158 and pBT338LO802 (see “Experimental Procedures”), termed primers a′ and b′, respectively, in Fig. 1 B), which should generate a 668-bp amplified DNA fragment. Amplified DNA fragments in high copy number clones could be seen directly on agarose gels (data not shown). In Southern blot assays performed with a probe specific for the six site, however, a band (∼660 bp) was detected in all cases in the pSVβ2-transfected samples (Fig.6, + lanes). This DNA fragment did not appear when plasmid pSVβ2 was not included in the transfection (mock transfection; − lanes). Signal strength appeared to correlate with the copy number of the target construction integrated in the chromosome, suggesting that recombination had occurred at many of the integrated target sequences and regardless of the integration site. Control PCR experiments in mock-transfected NIH/3T3 cells or NIH/3T3 cells transfected with the pSVβ2 plasmid were carried out routinely, and no amplified band of 660 bp was detected (Fig. 6, lanes c and d). The fidelity of the recombination mechanism was also confirmed by DNA sequencing of the amplified bands in the case of clones 1 and 2 (data not shown). The regenerated six site (see Fig.1 A) obtained after recombination was unaltered. These data indicate that β-recombinase can catalyze site-specific recombination in mammalian genomes. It therefore seems that the chromatin structure provides superhelical torsion suitable for β-recombinase-mediated recombination. The common genome manipulation techniques, including transgenesis and gene targeting, have opened a new path for the understanding of a wide variety of mechanisms involving diverse genetic functions. The utility of these systems becomes limited, however, when the overexpression or inactivation of a given gene has fatal effects on embryo development (as an example, see Refs. 11Gu H. Marth J.D. Orban P.C. Mossmann H. Rajewsky K. Science. 1994; 265: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar and 30Ioffe E. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) or when the lack of gene function can be bypassed or compensated by redundant mechanisms (31Schorle H. Holtschke T. Hunig T. Schimpl A. Horak I. Nature. 1991; 352: 621-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 32Kuhn R. Rajewsky K. Muller W. Science. 1991; 254: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). Moreover, the effects of gene inactivation outside the tissue or cell lineage of interest are usually unknown and uncontrollable (33Dranoff G. Crawford A.D. Sadelain M. Ream B. Rashid A. Bronson R.T. Dickersin G.R. Bachurski C.J. Mark E.L. Whiisett J.A. Mulligan R.C. Science. 1994; 264: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). These problems have been overcome to some extent by the development and application of the site-specific recombination techniques (reviewed in Ref. 7Nash H.A. Neidhart F.C. Curtis R.I. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbager H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 2363-2376Google Scholar) that allow spatiotemporal control of the targeting event. This is the case of the Cre-loxP and Flp-FRT systems (reviewed in Refs. 3Kilby N.J. Snaith M.R. Murray J.A. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar and 4Sauer B. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 890-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We show that the prokaryotic β-recombinase, which belongs to the resolvase/invertase family of enzymes, can be functionally expressed in eukaryotic cells and can promote the deletion of DNA sequences located between directly oriented target sites in mammalian cells. β-Recombinase appears to have high avidity for the nuclear compartment since, following transfection, it was detected mainly in the nuclear region, forming a very condensed and speckled pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. This point was reassessed in subcellular fractionation experiments (see “Results” and Fig. 3). This behavior is similar to that observed for the Cre enzyme (13Orban P.C. Chui D. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6861-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Cre and β-recombinase do not present a canonical or bipartite nuclear localization motif in their primary sequence (34Nath S.T. Nayak D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4139-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 35Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). Since they have access to the nuclear compartment, it is assumed that this localization occurs by diffusion through the nuclear membrane or following the transient disorganization of this membrane during mitosis. Transient β-recombinase expression by plasmid pSVβ2 promoted site-specific recombination between the two directly orientedsix sites in the substrate plasmid pCB8 when both plasmids were cotransfected in mammalian cells. As a result, the sequences between the two target sites were deleted from the DNA substrate. The site-specific recombination product was detected by PCR amplification of the Hirt extracts and reassessed by Southern hybridization of the amplified products. The presence of this recombination product was strictly dependent on the cotransfection of plasmids pSVβ2 and pCB8; no recombination products were observed when plasmids pSVβ2 and pCB8 were transfected separately. It therefore seems that β-recombinase can promote strand exchange of an extrachromosomal DNA (pCB8 DNA) in the mammalian environment, with no detectable spontaneous recombination. Similar results were obtained in recombination-activated β-galactosidase expression experiments. This reporter gene was designed to be expressed only upon recombination due to β-recombinase (plasmid Recombiner; see Fig. 5). As expected, high expression of β-galactosidase was obtained compared with the negative controls. This experiment not only provides additional evidence of recombination due to β-recombinase in mammalian cells independent of PCR detection, but also confirms the possibility of designing experiments to activate the expression of genes of interest with an analogue approach. Since in vitro recombination requires a chromatin-associated protein (28Alonso J.C. Gutiérrez C. Rojo F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we assume that this factor is provided by the host. Indeed, it is known that the mammalian HMG1 chromatin-associated protein can efficiently stimulate in vitro β-mediated recombination (20Alonso J.C. Weise F. Rojo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2938-2945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Alonso J.C. Gutiérrez C. Rojo F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has recently been observed that chromatin-associated proteins from plants can also assist β-recombinase in mediating DNA recombination (29Grasser K.D. Ritt C. Krieg M.E. Fernández S. Alonso J.C. Grimm R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that β-recombinase might be also suitable for manipulation of plant genomes. We have also studied the ability of β-recombinase to act on chromatin-integrated target substrates. Several stable NIH/3T3 clones were established bearing different copy numbers (5–75) of the substrate plasmid pCB8 randomly integrated in the host chromatin. Transient β-recombinase expression led to the excision of the sequences between the two directly oriented six sites; the recombination product was detected by PCR amplification from purified genomic DNA and Southern hybridization, and its identity was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing of the amplified product (data not shown). We provide the first evidence, in eukaryotic cells, for the activity of a DNA recombinase belonging to the prokaryotic resolvase/invertase family. Enzymes of this family promote DNA recombination through a mechanism different from that of DNA integrases. Integrases such as Cre or Flp promote intramolecular as well as intermolecular recombination, whereas recombinases of the resolvase/invertase family are highly specialized in intramolecular recombination. If confirmed in animal models, the availability of a tool such as β-recombinase will expand the possibilities for the programmed modification of eukaryotic genomes currently under use. β-Recombinase, used alone or in combination with the already existing recombination systems, will allow a more specific spatiotemporal control of the recombination events. Researchers would have the opportunity to design several independently controlled recombination events in the same animal or cell, thus providing new, more flexible solutions to general research. In this respect, different approaches to assess whether all these recombination systems can work simultaneously will be of great interest for further investigations. We thank Drs. Juan Ortı́n and Inés Canosa for providing strains and plasmids and Drs. Juan Ortı́n and Miguel Torres for critical reading of this manuscript. Automated fluorescent sequencing was done by A.

We examined whether the tyrosine kinases Pyk2 and Fak (members of the focal adhesion kinase family) are involved in CD28 signaling. We found that ligating CD28 in Jurkat T cells rapidly increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 but not of Fak. Paxillin, a substrate for Pyk2 and Fak, was not tyrosine-phosphorylated after CD28 ligation. CD28-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 was markedly reduced in the absence of external Ca2+. Previous studies have shown that the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2. In this report, the concurrent ligation of CD28 and TCR increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2; however, the extent of phosphorylation by both receptors was equivalent to the sum of that induced by each receptor alone. The Syk/Zap inhibitor piceatannol blocked CD28, and TCR induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2, suggesting that Syk/Zap is involved in Pyk2 phosphorylation. In contrast, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin blocked TCR- but not CD28-induced phosphorylation of Pyk2, suggesting that CD28 and TCR activate distinct pathways to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2. Notably, depleting phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-sensitive protein kinase C did not block CD28- and CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2.

Fak is expressed in almost all tissues, whereas Pyk2 is expressed mainly in the central nervous system and in cells and tissues derived from hematopoietic lineages.

In the present study, we examined the involvement of Fak/Pyk2 in the CD28 signaling pathways. We found that Pyk2, but not Fak or its substrate paxillin, is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated after CD28 ligation. We also found that simultaneously ligating CD28 and TCR had an additive effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2. Further analysis of CD28- and TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 showed that CD28 appears to utilize signaling pathways to phosphorylate Pyk2 distinct from those used by TCR.

Acute human T cell leukemia (Jurkat) cells, clone E6-1, were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Bethesda, MD). Before activation, cells were washed with RPMI containing 0.01% BSA, resuspended in the same media in polyethylene tubes (Fisherbrand, Fisher). The cells were then incubated with NMG, anti-CD28 mAb, or anti-CD3 mAb, and the tubes were placed in a 37 °C water bath for the indicated time. Following incubation, the cells were solubilized by adding an equal volume of 2× ice-cold solubilizing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 unit/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; final concentrations) and immediately placed on ice (65Hamawy M.M.

Following incubation, solubilized cells were moved to chilled 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. For costimulation studies, T cells in 0.01% BSA/RPMI were stimulated in suspension for 10 min at 37 °C with different concentrations of anti-human CD3 mAb in the presence or absence of 3 μg/ml of anti-CD28 mAb. Cell lysates were processed as described above. For stimulation in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, cells in suspension were divided into 2 aliquots (66Hamawy M.M. Swaim W.D.

In 1 aliquot, the cells were washed in EMEM containing 0.01% BSA and then resuspended in the same media and stimulated with anti-CD28 mAb or anti-CD3 mAb as above. The cells in the other aliquot were washed with Ca2+-free EMEM containing 0.01% BSA and 4 mm EDTA, suspended in EMEM containing 0.01% BSA and 50 μm EDTA, and then stimulated with anti-CD28 mAb or anti-CD3 mAb. Cell activation was as described above. To study the effects of inhibitors, T cells were pretreated in suspension for 30 min at 37 °C with different concentrations of the PTK Syk/Zap inhibitor, piceatannol, or with the lipid kinase PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. After washing, the cells were resuspended in 0.01% BSA/RPMI and stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb or anti-CD28 mAb as above. To deplete protein kinase C (PKC), cells were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C with 400 nm PMA. After washing, the cells were resuspended in 0.01% BSA/RPMI and stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb or anti-CD28 mAb as above. Cell lysates from 8 × 106 cells were precleared by incubating for 1 h with 10 μg of rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin that had been preincubated for 2 h with 50 μl of protein A-agarose. Meanwhile, the primary antibody was added to 10 μg of rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin that had been preincubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads. Precleared lysates were then added to the protein A-antibodies mixture and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed 5 times with ice-cold solubilization buffer. After the final centrifugation, the beads were resuspended in 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (final concentration, 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol) and boiled for 5 min. For immunoblotting, aliquots from whole cell lysates (WCL) or immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%) and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Immunoblotting with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY-20 was as described previously (62Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol.

To confirm similar loading of samples, antibodies were stripped from the membranes as previously reported (66Hamawy M.M. Swaim W.D. Minoguchi K. de Feijter A.W. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4655-4662PubMed Google Scholar), and the proteins were reprobed with specific antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin (1:50,000 dilution). The signals were visualized using the LumiGLO kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. To examine whether the PTKs Pyk2 and Fak are involved in CD28 signaling, Jurkat T cells were treated with anti-CD28 mAb, and the immunoprecipitates of Pyk2 and Fak were transferred to membranes and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. Immunoblotting of WCL with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb showed that aggregating CD28 on Jurkat T cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, the most prominent of which were 42–46-, 65-, 78-, and 95-kDa proteins (Fig.1 A). In contrast, NMG did not induce detectable protein tyrosine phosphorylation. CD28-induced tyrosine phosphorylation was apparent within 2 min, peaked at 5 min, and decreased slowly after that (Fig. 1 B). As shown in Fig.2 A, treating the cells with 1 or 3 μg/ml anti-CD28 mAb increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2. No detectable increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinase was seen in cells treated with NMG (Fig. 2 A). Time course studies showed that the phosphorylation of Pyk2 by CD28 cross-linking was first apparent within 2 min, reached a peak by 10 min, and decreased at 20 min (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, incubating the cells with anti-CD28 mAb did not induce any detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of Fak (Fig. 2 C).

In view of the potential usefulness of these observations for <i>in vitro</i> studies of sickling-related polymerization, we examined the ultrastructure, solubility behavior, and phase distributions of deoxygenated mixtures of Hb S with 70-kDa dextran, a relatively inert, low ionic strength space-filling macromolecule. Increasing admixture of dextran progressively lowered the <i>C</i> <sub>sat</sub> of deoxyHb S. With 12 g/dl dextran, a 5-fold decrease in apparent<i>C</i> <sub>sat</sub>(""dextran-<i>C</i> <sub>sat</sub>"") was obtained together with acceptable sensitivity and proportionality with the standard<i>C</i> <sub>sat</sub> when assessing the effects of non-S Hb admixtures (A, C, and F) or polymerization inhibitors (alkylureas or phenylalanine). The volume fraction of dextran excluding Hb was 70–75% of total deoxyHb-dextran (12 g/dl) volumes. Electron microscopy showed polymer fibers and fiber-to-crystal transitions indistinguishable from those formed without dextran. Thus when Hb quantities are limited, as with genetically engineered recombinant Hbs or transgenic sickle mice, the dextran-<i>C</i> <sub>sat</sub>provides convenient and reliable screening of effects of Hb S modifications on polymerization under near-physiological conditions, avoiding problems of high ionic strength."

It may be that the lower values forM r obtained in the early studies of the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 receptor from ileal mucosa were due to degradation of the receptor when isolated from this source, which is particularly rich in proteases.During studies of extracellular matrix proteins from bovine kidney (12Lindblom A. Marsh T. Fauser C. Engel J. Paulsson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we found an abundant, large, oligomeric protein, which could be selectively extracted with chelating agents and which was localized to kidney tubules. We have now, by determining amino acid sequences from peptides spanning a large portion of the protein, shown it to be the bovine homologue of cubilin. The access to highly purified protein, obtained under mild conditions, allowed us to use electron microscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation to show the organization of cubilin into a noncovalently associated trimer in which the subunits are connected by a coiled-coil α-helix.DISCUSSIONWe have isolated cubilin, the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 receptor, from bovine kidney as a large oligomeric protein. The selective solubilization by EDTA yielded cubilin in a native trimeric form that was characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation and electron microscopy. The data allow us to derive a model for cubilin structure and domain organization.Antibodies against cubilin revealed its presence at the apical surface in the proximal tubules of kidney and at the luminal surface of the small intestine. As the sequence of cubilin (3Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O. Christensen E.I. Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. J. Biol.

Similarly, Moestrup et al. (3Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O. Christensen E.I. Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. J. Biol.

We were able to show that the presence of calcium stabilizes cubilin against cleavage by trypsin (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and5) and a variety of proteases (results not shown), indicating that calcium binding induces a conformational change in the molecule. This calcium-dependent conformation may favor the interaction of cubilin with the plasma membrane or its receptor. EGF repeats 2, 4, 5, and 8 are of the calcium binding type (3Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O. Christensen E.I. Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5235-5242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), but it remains to be shown whether these domains are directly involved in interactions.The intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 receptor was recently isolated as a monomeric M r 460,000 protein from Triton X-100 solubilized kidney cortex membranes (2Birn H. Verroust P.J. Nexø E. Hager H. Jacobsen C. Christensen E.I. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). From a combination of electron microscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and SDS-PAGE we propose that cubilin isolated without detergents is a trimer of identical M r 440,000 subunits. This would yield a molecular mass of 1,320,000 Da for the trimer, whereas the estimated mass from ultracentrifugation was about 1,500,000 Da. The discrepancy could be due to the presence of aggregates, leading to an overestimation from the ultracentrifugation study. The trimer appears to be more stable to denaturation with the chaotropic agent guanidine HCl than with the detergent SDS. The higher sensitivity to detergents hints at an importance of hydrophobic interactions for the formation of the oligomer (see below). The use of detergents in previous purification protocols for cubilin may explain why the trimeric structure was not revealed.Each subunit of cubilin has a length of about 75 nm and is made up of a tandem array of globular domains connected by segments that give the overall structure a high degree of flexibility. Cubilin is made of a N-terminal stretch of 110 amino acids, followed by 8 EGF-like domains and 27 CUB domains. Assuming lengths of 4.4 nm for the N-terminal domain (see below) and 20 nm for eight EGF domains, the CUB domains should extend over 50.6 nm, or 1.9 nm per CUB domain. CUB domains form a compact ellipsoid β-sandwich structure (25Ramãbo M.J. Kölln I. Dias J.M. Carvalho A.L. Romero A. Varela P.F. Sanz L. Töpfer-Petersen E. Calvete J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 650-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Seminal plasma PSP-I and PSP-II are each composed of one CUB domain and form heterodimers (26Varela P.F. Romero A. Sanz L. Ramãbo M.J. Töpfer-Petersen E. Calvete J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal ends of PSP-I and PSP-II are located at the same side of a 5-stranded β-sheet and are buried in the interface. It is unlikely that such an interaction also occurs between tandem CUB domains, as the arrangement does not allow the formation of rows of consecutive domains. The electron microscopic pictures of cubilin show globules arranged in a zig-zag manner in the outer segments of the arms, demonstrating that the relative orientation of CUB domains in cubilin is variable and not rod-like.The observation of the trimeric structure led to a search for an assembly domain. Indeed, scrutiny of the rat (3Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O. Christensen E.I. Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. J. Biol.

Moestrup S.K. Blood. 1998; 91: 3593-3600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cubilin sequences revealed a N-terminal region with a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues. Alignment with the heptad repeat indicated the presence of four heptads between amino acids 103 and 132 preceding the first EGF-like domain (Fig. 6). Positions a and d of the heptads are occupied by residues Ile, Leu, Val, and Phe, which come into close contact in an α-helical coiled-coil and stabilize it by hydrophobic interactions. Further coiled-coil stabilization may occur through intrahelical ionic interactions between oppositely charged side chains of the type i →i + 3 and i → i + 4 (27Marqusee S. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8898-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 28Kohn W.D. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1039-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cubilin residues at positions b, c, e, f, and g are mainly hydrophilic, and two intrachain ionic interactions are possible (Fig. 6). These findings were confirmed when the sequence was analyzed by different algorithms for predicting α-helical coiled-coil structures (Fig.7). All programs agree in their assignment of heptad positions (abcdefg) to each residue. A pair of charged residues, Lys-115–Glu-120, is located in heptad positions g–e′, compatible with the formation of an interchain ionic interaction. Such ionic interchain interactions have been shown to determine the packing and the oligomerization state of the α-helices (29Cohen C. Parry D.A.D.

In each case, a window size of 28 residues was used. No significant difference was observed when the rat cubilin sequence was analyzed (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The MultiCoil program (31Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) allows a discrimination between dimer and trimer coiled-coil formation and favors a trimer assembly for cubilin (Fig. 7). Assuming a length of 0.15 nm/residue, a triple coiled-coil of 29 amino acids would yield a rod-like structure of about 4.4 nm (32Beck K. Spring J. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Engel J. Chiquet M. Taylor W.R. Patterns in Protein Sequence and Structure. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 229-254Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence of these heptads is preceded by a proline- and glycine-rich stretch that should interrupt formation of an α-helical coiled-coil. Within amino acids 53–102, heptad repeats can be detected, but frequent interruption of the pattern of hydrophobic residues at positions a and d makes the formation of a second coiled-coil region questionable. This coiled-coil also could not be detected by the algorithms.It remains to be studied how the formation of the cubilin trimer affects its function during endocytosis, but a multivalency might strengthen the interactions with large ligands such as megalin. Already, the 27 CUB domains contained in each subunit provide multiple interaction sites for proteins or membrane phospholipids, but possibly a protein containing more than one binding site for cubilin at some distance from each other may interact at the same time with two or more arms of the molecule. A trimeric structure similar to that of cubilin has been found for the macrophage scavenger receptor, which is, however, anchored in the plasma membrane by a transmembrane domain (33Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). In this receptor, a membrane-spanning domain is followed by a coiled coil α-helix consisting of 16 heptads and, further toward the C terminus, by 23–24 Gly-X-Y triplets forming a collagenous triple helix. At the C terminus, each chain contains a scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain. Even though the binding partners for these domains in the scavenger receptor are not known, homologous domains in other proteins are involved in extracellular ligand interactions (33Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Thus, both cubilin and the macrophage scavenger receptor are examples of trimeric proteins facilitating endocytosis of ligands, and for some other such receptors, the oligomeric state is not yet known. Possibly both a multivalency of binding within each subunit and an oligomeric arrangement of subunits are mechanisms to facilitate endocytosis by concentrating ligands to a small area of the membrane.Birn et al. (2Birn H. Verroust P.J. Nexø E. Hager H. Jacobsen C. Christensen E.I. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that cubilin binds to the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex with high affinity and that labeled vitamin B12 is in vivo endocytosed by a cubilin-mediated process into the epithelial cells of proximal tubules. Although intrinsic factor is mainly acting in the gastrointestinal uptake of vitamin B12 via cubilin, the renal uptake of filtered intrinsic factor-vitamin B12complex might prevent losses of filtered complexes to the urine. The human cubilin gene has been mapped to the gene locus for a rare form of congenital vitamin B12 deficiency, Imerslund-Gräsbeck disease (5Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Silahtaroglu A. Hansen C.

Patients with this condition suffer not only from megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency but also from proteinuria. This hints at a further role of cubilin in renal protein reabsorption. The receptor for intrinsic factor-vitamin B12complexes, cubilin, is expressed in intestinal epithelium and, more abundantly, in kidney tubular epithelium and yolk sac (1Seetharam B. Levine J.S.

In early studies, the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 receptor was isolated from porcine (8Marcoullis G. Gräsbeck R. Biochim. Biophys.

When extracted by Triton X-100, the receptor was detected in several complexes with masses ranging from 800,000 to 12,000,000 Da, depending on source and method of analysis. Upon SDS-PAGE, polypeptides ranging from 40,000 to 180,000 Da were recovered. More recently, the receptor has been purified from rat kidney as a protein ofM r 230,000 (1Seetharam B. Levine J.S. Ramasamy M. Alpers D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4443-4449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 460,000 (cubilin) (2Birn H. Verroust P.J. Nexø E. Hager H. Jacobsen C. Christensen E.I.

The clones containing the cDNA coding for the 396,953-Da rat cubilin were identified by use of specific antibodies raised against purified cubilin and confirmed by the demonstration of matching sequences in peptides derived from this receptor protein (3Moestrup S.K.

The same antibodies detect a band of apparent M r 460,000 also in intestinal mucosa, albeit some lower M rimmunoreactive material could also be seen in immunoblots from this source (3Moestrup S.K.

It may be that the lower values forM r obtained in the early studies of the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 receptor from ileal mucosa were due to degradation of the receptor when isolated from this source, which is particularly rich in proteases. During studies of extracellular matrix proteins from bovine kidney (12Lindblom A. Marsh T. Fauser C. Engel J. Paulsson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we found an abundant, large, oligomeric protein, which could be selectively extracted with chelating agents and which was localized to kidney tubules. We have now, by determining amino acid sequences from peptides spanning a large portion of the protein, shown it to be the bovine homologue of cubilin. The access to highly purified protein, obtained under mild conditions, allowed us to use electron microscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation to show the organization of cubilin into a noncovalently associated trimer in which the subunits are connected by a coiled-coil α-helix. DISCUSSIONWe have isolated cubilin, the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 receptor, from bovine kidney as a large oligomeric protein. The selective solubilization by EDTA yielded cubilin in a native trimeric form that was characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation and electron microscopy. The data allow us to derive a model for cubilin structure and domain organization.Antibodies against cubilin revealed its presence at the apical surface in the proximal tubules of kidney and at the luminal surface of the small intestine. As the sequence of cubilin (3Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O. Christensen E.I. Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. J. Biol.

Similarly, Moestrup et al. (3Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O. Christensen E.I. Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. J. Biol.

We were able to show that the presence of calcium stabilizes cubilin against cleavage by trypsin (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and5) and a variety of proteases (results not shown), indicating that calcium binding induces a conformational change in the molecule. This calcium-dependent conformation may favor the interaction of cubilin with the plasma membrane or its receptor. EGF repeats 2, 4, 5, and 8 are of the calcium binding type (3Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O. Christensen E.I. Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5235-5242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), but it remains to be shown whether these domains are directly involved in interactions.The intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 receptor was recently isolated as a monomeric M r 460,000 protein from Triton X-100 solubilized kidney cortex membranes (2Birn H. Verroust P.J. Nexø E. Hager H. Jacobsen C. Christensen E.I. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). From a combination of electron microscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and SDS-PAGE we propose that cubilin isolated without detergents is a trimer of identical M r 440,000 subunits. This would yield a molecular mass of 1,320,000 Da for the trimer, whereas the estimated mass from ultracentrifugation was about 1,500,000 Da. The discrepancy could be due to the presence of aggregates, leading to an overestimation from the ultracentrifugation study. The trimer appears to be more stable to denaturation with the chaotropic agent guanidine HCl than with the detergent SDS. The higher sensitivity to detergents hints at an importance of hydrophobic interactions for the formation of the oligomer (see below). The use of detergents in previous purification protocols for cubilin may explain why the trimeric structure was not revealed.Each subunit of cubilin has a length of about 75 nm and is made up of a tandem array of globular domains connected by segments that give the overall structure a high degree of flexibility. Cubilin is made of a N-terminal stretch of 110 amino acids, followed by 8 EGF-like domains and 27 CUB domains. Assuming lengths of 4.4 nm for the N-terminal domain (see below) and 20 nm for eight EGF domains, the CUB domains should extend over 50.6 nm, or 1.9 nm per CUB domain. CUB domains form a compact ellipsoid β-sandwich structure (25Ramãbo M.J. Kölln I. Dias J.M. Carvalho A.L. Romero A. Varela P.F. Sanz L. Töpfer-Petersen E. Calvete J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 650-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Seminal plasma PSP-I and PSP-II are each composed of one CUB domain and form heterodimers (26Varela P.F. Romero A. Sanz L. Ramãbo M.J. Töpfer-Petersen E. Calvete J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal ends of PSP-I and PSP-II are located at the same side of a 5-stranded β-sheet and are buried in the interface. It is unlikely that such an interaction also occurs between tandem CUB domains, as the arrangement does not allow the formation of rows of consecutive domains. The electron microscopic pictures of cubilin show globules arranged in a zig-zag manner in the outer segments of the arms, demonstrating that the relative orientation of CUB domains in cubilin is variable and not rod-like.The observation of the trimeric structure led to a search for an assembly domain. Indeed, scrutiny of the rat (3Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O. Christensen E.I. Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. J. Biol.

Moestrup S.K. Blood. 1998; 91: 3593-3600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cubilin sequences revealed a N-terminal region with a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues. Alignment with the heptad repeat indicated the presence of four heptads between amino acids 103 and 132 preceding the first EGF-like domain (Fig. 6). Positions a and d of the heptads are occupied by residues Ile, Leu, Val, and Phe, which come into close contact in an α-helical coiled-coil and stabilize it by hydrophobic interactions. Further coiled-coil stabilization may occur through intrahelical ionic interactions between oppositely charged side chains of the type i →i + 3 and i → i + 4 (27Marqusee S. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8898-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 28Kohn W.D. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1039-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cubilin residues at positions b, c, e, f, and g are mainly hydrophilic, and two intrachain ionic interactions are possible (Fig. 6). These findings were confirmed when the sequence was analyzed by different algorithms for predicting α-helical coiled-coil structures (Fig.7). All programs agree in their assignment of heptad positions (abcdefg) to each residue. A pair of charged residues, Lys-115–Glu-120, is located in heptad positions g–e′, compatible with the formation of an interchain ionic interaction. Such ionic interchain interactions have been shown to determine the packing and the oligomerization state of the α-helices (29Cohen C. Parry D.A.D. Science. 1994; 263: 488-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 30Beck K. Gambee J.E. Kamawal A. Bächinger H.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3767-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).The MultiCoil program (31Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) allows a discrimination between dimer and trimer coiled-coil formation and favors a trimer assembly for cubilin (Fig. 7). Assuming a length of 0.15 nm/residue, a triple coiled-coil of 29 amino acids would yield a rod-like structure of about 4.4 nm (32Beck K. Spring J. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Engel J. Chiquet M. Taylor W.R. Patterns in Protein Sequence and Structure. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 229-254Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence of these heptads is preceded by a proline- and glycine-rich stretch that should interrupt formation of an α-helical coiled-coil. Within amino acids 53–102, heptad repeats can be detected, but frequent interruption of the pattern of hydrophobic residues at positions a and d makes the formation of a second coiled-coil region questionable. This coiled-coil also could not be detected by the algorithms.It remains to be studied how the formation of the cubilin trimer affects its function during endocytosis, but a multivalency might strengthen the interactions with large ligands such as megalin. Already, the 27 CUB domains contained in each subunit provide multiple interaction sites for proteins or membrane phospholipids, but possibly a protein containing more than one binding site for cubilin at some distance from each other may interact at the same time with two or more arms of the molecule. A trimeric structure similar to that of cubilin has been found for the macrophage scavenger receptor, which is, however, anchored in the plasma membrane by a transmembrane domain (33Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). In this receptor, a membrane-spanning domain is followed by a coiled coil α-helix consisting of 16 heptads and, further toward the C terminus, by 23–24 Gly-X-Y triplets forming a collagenous triple helix. At the C terminus, each chain contains a scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain. Even though the binding partners for these domains in the scavenger receptor are not known, homologous domains in other proteins are involved in extracellular ligand interactions (33Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Thus, both cubilin and the macrophage scavenger receptor are examples of trimeric proteins facilitating endocytosis of ligands, and for some other such receptors, the oligomeric state is not yet known. Possibly both a multivalency of binding within each subunit and an oligomeric arrangement of subunits are mechanisms to facilitate endocytosis by concentrating ligands to a small area of the membrane.Birn et al. (2Birn H. Verroust P.J. Nexø E. Hager H. Jacobsen C. Christensen E.I. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that cubilin binds to the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex with high affinity and that labeled vitamin B12 is in vivo endocytosed by a cubilin-mediated process into the epithelial cells of proximal tubules. Although intrinsic factor is mainly acting in the gastrointestinal uptake of vitamin B12 via cubilin, the renal uptake of filtered intrinsic factor-vitamin B12complex might prevent losses of filtered complexes to the urine. The human cubilin gene has been mapped to the gene locus for a rare form of congenital vitamin B12 deficiency, Imerslund-Gräsbeck disease (5Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Silahtaroglu A. Hansen C.

https://openalex.org/W2051074796,"Pre-α-inhibitor is a serum protein consisting of two polypeptides named bikunin and heavy chain 3 (H3). Both polypeptides are synthesized in hepatocytes and while passing through the Golgi complex, bikunin, which carries a chondroitin sulfate chain, becomes covalently linked to the COOH-terminal amino acid residue of H3 via its polysaccharide. Immediately prior to this reaction, a COOH-terminal propeptide of 33 kDa is cleaved off from the heavy chain. Using COS-1 cells transfected with rat H3, we found that in the absence of bikunin, the cleaved propeptide remained bound to the heavy chain and that H3 lacking the propeptide sequence did not become linked to coexpressed bikunin. Sequencing of H3 secreted from COS-1 cells showed that part of the molecules had a 12-amino acid residue long NH2-terminal propeptide. Cleavage of this propeptide, which occurred in the endoplasmic reticulum, was found to require basic amino acid residues at P1, P2, and P6 suggesting that it is mediated by a Golgi enzyme in transit. Deletion of the NH2-terminal propeptide or blocking of its release affected neither transport nor coupling of the heavy chain to bikunin.

Using COS-1 cells transfected with rat H3, we found that in the absence of bikunin, the cleaved propeptide remained bound to the heavy chain and that H3 lacking the propeptide sequence did not become linked to coexpressed bikunin. Sequencing of H3 secreted from COS-1 cells showed that part of the molecules had a 12-amino acid residue long NH2-terminal propeptide. Cleavage of this propeptide, which occurred in the endoplasmic reticulum, was found to require basic amino acid residues at P1, P2, and P6 suggesting that it is mediated by a Golgi enzyme in transit. Deletion of the NH2-terminal propeptide or blocking of its release affected neither transport nor coupling of the heavy chain to bikunin. Bikunin is a 25-kDa serum protein whose polypeptide consists of two tandemly arranged proteinase inhibitor domains of the Kunitz type (1Swaim M.W. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Bikunin is made by hepatocytes and is synthesized as a precursor also containing α1-microglobulin (2Vetr H. Gebhard W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1990; 371: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 3Lindqvist A. Bratt T. Altieri M. Kastern W. Akerstrom B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Late during its intracellular transport, the bikunin precursor acquires a chondroitin sulfate chain and shortly afterward, α1-microglobulin is released by proteolytic cleavage (4Sjöberg E.M. Fries E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Just before this cleavage, part of the bikunin precursor molecules becomes covalently linked via the chondroitin sulfate chain to one or two polypeptides of about 80 kDa, named the heavy chains. In this fashion, pre-α-inhibitor (PαI) 1The abbreviations used are: PαI, pre-α-inhibitor; IαI, inter-α-inhibitor; H3, heavy chain 3; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Endo H, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; wt, wild type; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.1The abbreviations used are: PαI, pre-α-inhibitor; IαI, inter-α-inhibitor; H3, heavy chain 3; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Endo H, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; wt, wild type; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.is formed from one bikunin and one heavy chain and inter-α-inhibitor (IαI) from one bikunin and two heavy chains. The polypeptide compositions of these proteins have been shown to differ between species. IαI and PαI from man and rat contain H1 and H2, and H3, respectively (5Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Hefta S.A.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The physiological function of PαI and IαI is not clear butin vitro experiments have shown that the two proteins are required for the formation of the hyaluronan-containing matrix that surrounds certain cells (6Blom A.M. Thuveson M. Fries E. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 8Chen L. Mao S.J. McLean L.R. Powers R.W. Larsen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28282-28287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other results suggest that IαI might have a role in inflammation (9Wisniewski H. Hua J.-C. Poppers D.M. Naime D. Vilcek J. Cronstein B.N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1609-1615PubMed Google Scholar).Sequence analysis as well as pulse-chase experiments have revealed that the heavy chains have COOH-terminal propeptides of about 30 kDa (10Gebhard W. Schreitmuller T. Hochstrasser K. Wachter E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11Bourguignon J. Diarra M.M. Thiberville L. Bost F. Sesboue R. Martin J.P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18700-18709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These extensions are apparently released by a proteolytic cleavage between an Asp and a Pro residue (13Chan P. Risler J.L. Raguenez G. Salier J.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The enzyme mediating this reaction is unknown and in the present study we have defined its specificity by mutating the amino acid residues near the cleavage site. It has been demonstrated that the chondroitin sulfate chain of bikunin is linked to the heavy chains through an ester bond between an internal GalNAc residue and the α-carbon of the COOH-terminal amino acid (5Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Hefta S.A. Thogersen I.B. Rutherfurd S. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 747-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14Morelle W. Capon C. Balduyck M. Sautiere P. Kouach M. Michalski C. Fournet B. Mizon J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The mechanism for the formation of this bond is unknown but in this paper we present evidence that the COOH-terminal propeptide is required for the coupling reaction.Comparison of the amino acid sequences near the site where signal peptides have been found to be cleaved has yielded a set of rules that can be used for predicting the cleavage site (15von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). When these rules are applied to the sequence deduced from the cDNA of rat H3, they indicate that the signal peptide ends 12 amino acid residues before the beginning of the mature polypeptide implying the existence of an NH2-terminal propeptide (6Blom A.M. Thuveson M. Fries E. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Here we confirm this prediction experimentally, and show that the cleavage, although it occurs in the ER, is mediated by an enzyme whose sequence specificity is that of a Golgi proprotein convertase.DISCUSSIONMany secretory proteins are synthesized as precursors that are proteolytically cleaved during their transport to the cell surface. Normally this cleavage occurs just before the proteins are released: in the trans Golgi network or in the secretory vesicles (20Halban P.A. Irminger J.-C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In several cases the cleavage has been shown to make the proteins biologically active suggesting that an early activation would be harmful to the cell (21Anderson E.D. Slyke J.K.V. Thulin C.D. Jean F. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The cleavage of proproteins typically occurs next to two basic residues and recently, a family of enzymes was identified that mediates this reaction (22Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar).In this study we have used the heavy chain of rat PαI, heavy chain 3 (H3), as a model for the proteolytic processing of the heavy chains of the bikunin-containing proteins. The cleavage sites for the COOH-terminal propeptides of these proteins differ from those of other proproteins in that they lack adjacent basic amino acid residues (23Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis we have now shown that five of the conserved residues flanking this site in H3 are essential for cleavage; to our knowledge there is no known proteinase that recognizes the corresponding sequence. We also found that the COOH-terminal propeptide (in the absence of bikunin) remains attached to the heavy chain. The conserved amino acid residues near the cleavage site that we found not to be required for cleavage, P4, P4′, and P5′, might mediate this interaction. The degree to which the heavy chains are cleaved during secretion varies greatly between different cell types. Thus, experiments with human hepatocytes have shown that H3 and H2 are completely cleaved in these cells whereas in the human hepatoma cell line Hep G2, they are partially or not processed at all, respectively (12Thogersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18700-18709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); these observations indicate that the cleavage is not autocatalytic.We have earlier shown that coexpression of bikunin and heavy chain in COS-1 cells leads to coupling of the two polypeptides via the chondroitin sulfate chain of bikunin (6Blom A.M. Thuveson M. Fries E. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Using this system we now show that no complex is formed when the COOH-terminal propeptide is deleted (Fig. 4). Since H3 expressed without the COOH-terminal propeptide is secreted at the same rate as the normal protein, its inability to become linked does not seem to be due to misfolding. Our finding that the propeptide remains bound to H3 after cleavage is consistent with the idea that it mediates the coupling, as shown schematically in Fig.8. The mechanism for this reaction is presently unknown. Part of the amino acid sequence of the COOH-terminal propeptide shows similarity with multicopper oxidases (13Chan P. Risler J.L. Raguenez G. Salier J.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6Blom A.M. Thuveson M. Fries E. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Further mutational analysis should reveal if the corresponding amino acid residues are essential for the coupling reaction.On the basis of sequence analysis, all heavy chains of the bikunin-containing proteins have been proposed to have NH2-terminal propeptides (11Bourguignon J. Diarra M.M. Thiberville L. Bost F. Sesboue R. Martin J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 12Thogersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18700-18709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this study of rat H3 we have obtained experimental evidence for the existence of such a propeptide. Furthermore, we have confirmed an earlier observation indicating that the cleavage occurs in the ER (12Thogersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18700-18709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Using mutational analysis we now show that cleavage of the NH2-terminal propeptide requires basic amino acid residues at P1, P2, and P6 (Fig. 7). These characteristics agree with the substrate specificity of the Golgi enzyme furin, a ubiquitously occurring proprotein convertase (24Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). This enzyme is synthesized in an essentially inactive form and becomes fully active only when it has left the ER. However, the newly synthesized form does display some (autocatalytic) activity in the ER (21Anderson E.D. Slyke J.K.V. Thulin C.D. Jean F. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), which could be sufficient for mediating the cleavage of pro-H3. It is interesting to note that there are basic amino acid residues at all the proposed cleavage sites of the heavy chains, suggesting that they are all cleaved by the same enzyme. In contrast to the previously studied liver cells (12Thogersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18700-18709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), COS-1 cells cleave the NH2-terminal propeptide in the ER only partially. This fact made it possible to observe that there was little additional processing in the Golgi complex, indicating that the NH2-terminal propeptide is hidden in the mature polypeptide.For many proteins, the propeptides have been found to be required for proper folding (25Baker D. Shiau A.K. Agard D.A. Curr. Biol. 1993; 5: 966-970Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This does not appear to be the case for the NH2-terminal propeptide of H3, as judged by the fact that when H3 was expressed without the NH2-terminal propeptide, it was secreted normally and could be coupled to bikunin. However, absence of the NH2-terminal propeptide during synthesis might affect other properties of the protein adversely, perhaps those associated with its function in the formation of the hyaluronan-containing matrix that surrounds various cell types (26Chen L. Mao S.J. Larsen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12380-12386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Chen W. Curr. Opin.

Using site-directed mutagenesis we have now shown that five of the conserved residues flanking this site in H3 are essential for cleavage; to our knowledge there is no known proteinase that recognizes the corresponding sequence. We also found that the COOH-terminal propeptide (in the absence of bikunin) remains attached to the heavy chain. The conserved amino acid residues near the cleavage site that we found not to be required for cleavage, P4, P4′, and P5′, might mediate this interaction. The degree to which the heavy chains are cleaved during secretion varies greatly between different cell types. Thus, experiments with human hepatocytes have shown that H3 and H2 are completely cleaved in these cells whereas in the human hepatoma cell line Hep G2, they are partially or not processed at all, respectively (12Thogersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18700-18709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); these observations indicate that the cleavage is not autocatalytic. We have earlier shown that coexpression of bikunin and heavy chain in COS-1 cells leads to coupling of the two polypeptides via the chondroitin sulfate chain of bikunin (6Blom A.M. Thuveson M. Fries E. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Using this system we now show that no complex is formed when the COOH-terminal propeptide is deleted (Fig. 4). Since H3 expressed without the COOH-terminal propeptide is secreted at the same rate as the normal protein, its inability to become linked does not seem to be due to misfolding. Our finding that the propeptide remains bound to H3 after cleavage is consistent with the idea that it mediates the coupling, as shown schematically in Fig.8. The mechanism for this reaction is presently unknown. Part of the amino acid sequence of the COOH-terminal propeptide shows similarity with multicopper oxidases (13Chan P. Risler J.L. Raguenez G. Salier J.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6Blom A.M. Thuveson M. Fries E. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Further mutational analysis should reveal if the corresponding amino acid residues are essential for the coupling reaction. On the basis of sequence analysis, all heavy chains of the bikunin-containing proteins have been proposed to have NH2-terminal propeptides (11Bourguignon J. Diarra M.M. Thiberville L. Bost F. Sesboue R. Martin J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 12Thogersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18700-18709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this study of rat H3 we have obtained experimental evidence for the existence of such a propeptide. Furthermore, we have confirmed an earlier observation indicating that the cleavage occurs in the ER (12Thogersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18700-18709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Using mutational analysis we now show that cleavage of the NH2-terminal propeptide requires basic amino acid residues at P1, P2, and P6 (Fig. 7). These characteristics agree with the substrate specificity of the Golgi enzyme furin, a ubiquitously occurring proprotein convertase (24Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). This enzyme is synthesized in an essentially inactive form and becomes fully active only when it has left the ER. However, the newly synthesized form does display some (autocatalytic) activity in the ER (21Anderson E.D. Slyke J.K.V. Thulin C.D. Jean F. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), which could be sufficient for mediating the cleavage of pro-H3. It is interesting to note that there are basic amino acid residues at all the proposed cleavage sites of the heavy chains, suggesting that they are all cleaved by the same enzyme. In contrast to the previously studied liver cells (12Thogersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18700-18709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), COS-1 cells cleave the NH2-terminal propeptide in the ER only partially. This fact made it possible to observe that there was little additional processing in the Golgi complex, indicating that the NH2-terminal propeptide is hidden in the mature polypeptide. For many proteins, the propeptides have been found to be required for proper folding (25Baker D. Shiau A.K. Agard D.A. Curr. Biol. 1993; 5: 966-970Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This does not appear to be the case for the NH2-terminal propeptide of H3, as judged by the fact that when H3 was expressed without the NH2-terminal propeptide, it was secreted normally and could be coupled to bikunin. However, absence of the NH2-terminal propeptide during synthesis might affect other properties of the protein adversely, perhaps those associated with its function in the formation of the hyaluronan-containing matrix that surrounds various cell types (26Chen L.

https://openalex.org/W2047770937,"Protozoan parasites of the genusLeishmania secrete a number of glycoproteins and mucin-like proteoglycans that appear to be important parasite virulence factors. We have previously proposed that the polypeptide backbones of these molecules are extensively modified with a complex array of phosphoglycan chains that are linked to Ser/Thr-rich domains via a common Manα1-PO4-Ser linkage (Ilg, T., Overath, P., Ferguson, M. A. J., Rutherford, T., Campbell, D. G., and McConville, M. J. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 24073–24081). In this study, we show that Leishmania mexicana promastigotes contain a peptide-specific mannose-1-phosphotransferase (pep-MPT) activity that adds Manα1-P to serine residues in a range of defined peptides. The presence and location of the Manα1-PO4-Ser linkage in these peptides were determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and chemical and enzymatic treatments. The pep-MPT activity was solubilized in non-ionic detergents, was dependent on Mn2+, utilized GDP-Man as the mannose donor, and was expressed in all developmental stages of the parasite. The pep-MPT activity was maximal against peptides containing Ser/Thr-rich domains of the endogenous acceptors and, based on competition assays with oligosaccharide acceptors, was distinct from other leishmanial MPTs involved in the initiation and elongation of lipid-linked phosphoglycan chains. In subcellular fractionation experiments, pep-MPT was resolved from the endoplasmic reticulum marker BiP, but had an overlapping distribution with thecis-Golgi marker Rab1. Although Man-PO4residues in the mature secreted glycoproteins are extensively modified with mannose oligosaccharides and phosphoglycan chains, similar modifications were not added to peptide-linked Man-PO4residues in the in vitro assays. Similarly, Man-PO4 residues on endogenous polypeptide acceptors were also poorly extended, although the elongating enzymes were still active, suggesting that the pep-MPT activity and elongating enzymes may be present in separate subcellular compartments. Protozoan parasites of the genusLeishmania secrete a number of glycoproteins and mucin-like proteoglycans that appear to be important parasite virulence factors.

Parasitic protozoa of the genus Leishmania cause a spectrum of human and animal diseases that are transmitted by a sand fly vector. During their development in the digestive tract of the sand fly, these parasites differentiate from non-infective procyclic promastigotes to infective metacyclic promastigotes that target mammalian macrophages when introduced into the host during the insect's blood meal. Following their internalization into the macrophage phagolysosome, metacyclic promastigotes differentiate into a replicative amastigote stage and eventually rupture the host cell and perpetuate disease by infecting other host cells. A number of cell-surface and secreted virulence factors are thought to be crucial for the survival of these different developmental stages in their respective host environments. These include an abundant glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored lipophosphoglycan (LPG) 1The abbreviations used are: LPG, lipophosphoglycan; PPG, proteophosphoglycan; aPPG, amastigote proteophosphoglycan; sAP, secreted acid phosphatase; MPT, mannose-1-phosphotransferase; pep-MPT, peptide-specific mannose-1-phosphotransferase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-chloramidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; HPTLC, high performance thin-layer chromatography; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.1The abbreviations used are: LPG, lipophosphoglycan; PPG, proteophosphoglycan; aPPG, amastigote proteophosphoglycan; sAP, secreted acid phosphatase; MPT, mannose-1-phosphotransferase; pep-MPT, peptide-specific mannose-1-phosphotransferase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-chloramidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; HPTLC, high performance thin-layer chromatography; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.

McConville M.J. Overath P. Parasitology. 1994; 108 (and references therein): S63-S71Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar and 5Mengeling B.J. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Strikingly, both the cell-surface LPGs and the secreted molecules are elaborated with structurally related phosphoglycan chains that are thought to be the major functional determinants of these molecules. The secreted glycoproteins and proteoglycans of Leishmaniahave been shown to form distinct macromolecular complexes in the flagellar pocket and extracellular milieu (4Ilg T. Stierhof Y.-D. Wiese M. McConville M.J. Overath P. Parasitology. 1994; 108 (and references therein): S63-S71Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The most intensively characterized of these molecules are the secreted acid phosphatases (sAPs), which aggregate into large pearl-like filamentous polymers (6Ilg T. Stierhof Y.-D. Etges R. Adrian M. Harbecke D. Overath P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8774-8778Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,7Weise M. Ilg T. Lottspeich F. Overath P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Early studies indicated that sAPs were heavily glycosylated and phosphorylated enzymes that contained glycan epitopes characteristic of LPGs (6Ilg T. Stierhof Y.-D. Etges R. Adrian M. Harbecke D.

We have recently shown that Leishmania mexicana sAP is extensively modified with Manα1-PO4residues that are linked to serine residues in the polypeptide backbone (10Ilg T. Overath P. Ferguson M.A.J. Rutherford T. Campbell D.G. McConville M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24073-24081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This unusual type of linkage, in which a monosaccharide is linked to protein via a phosphodiester bridge, has been termed phosphoglycosylation (11Mehta D.P. Ichikawa M. Salimath P.V. Etchison J.R. Haak R. Manzi A. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10897-10903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and may be widespread in several lower eukaryotes (12Haynes P.A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In L. mexicana, the Manα1-PO4residues can be further elaborated with α1–2-linked mannose oligosaccharides or short chains of phosphorylated di- or trisaccharides (10Ilg T. Overath P. Ferguson M.A.J. Rutherford T. Campbell D.G. McConville M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24073-24081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are also found in the long phosphoglycan chains (as capping structures or internal repeat units, respectively) of L. mexicana LPG (see Fig. 1). Interestingly, the nature of these modifications may be influenced by the size of the Ser/Thr-rich repeat domains in the polypeptide backbone. For example, sAP-1 contains a relatively short Ser/Thr-rich domain and is modified primarily with mannose oligomers, whereas sAP-2, which contains a longer stretch of Ser/Thr-rich repeat sequences, is extensively modified with short phosphoglycan chains (7Weise M. Ilg T. Lottspeich F. Overath P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10Ilg T. Overath P. Ferguson M.A.J. Rutherford T. Campbell D.G. McConville M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24073-24081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to sAP, two heavily phosphoglycosylated PPGs have been recently characterized from leishmanial promastigotes and amastigotes (13Ilg T. Stierhof Y.-D. McConville M.J. Overath P. Eur. J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Promastigote PPGs are produced by all species of Leishmania and form a network of unbranched filaments in the center of aggregated promastigotes (14Ilg T. Stierhof Y.-D. Craik D. Simpson R. Handman E. Bacic A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21583-21596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 16Stierhof Y.-D. Ilg T. Russell D.G. Hohenberg H. Overath P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Amastigote PPGs (aPPGs) are produced by most species and accumulate to very high levels in the lumen of the parasitophorous vacuole and in the extracellular space of lesions (13Ilg T. Stierhof Y.-D. McConville M.J. Overath P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar,15Ilg T. Craik D. Currie G. Multhaup G. Bacic A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13509-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The polypeptide backbones of PPGs differ from sAPs in being rich in proline and alanine as well as serine and threonine and are more extensively modified with phosphoglycan chains, which may account for as much as 90% of the molecule (13Ilg T. Stierhof Y.-D. McConville M.J. Overath P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ilg T. Stierhof Y.-D. Craik D. Simpson R. Handman E. Bacic A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13509-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Whereas the phosphoglycan chains of Leishmania major promastigote PPG are similar to those of the corresponding LPG, L. mexicana aPPGs are elaborated with novel stage-specific phosphoglycans that are distinct from those found on both promastigote sAPs and LPGs (15Ilg T. Craik D. Currie G. Multhaup G. Bacic A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13509-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, all these glycans are thought to be linked exclusively to the polypeptide backbone via a Manα1-PO4-Ser core sequence (14Ilg T. Stierhof Y.-D. Craik D. Simpson R. Handman E. Bacic A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21583-21596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15Ilg T. Craik D. Currie G. Multhaup G. Bacic A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13509-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recent functional studies have shown that these molecules may be important for parasite infectivity and survival in both the insect and the mammalian host. L. mexicana aPPG is a potent activator of the complement cascade via the mannan-binding lectin pathway and may effectively deplete the local supply of complement components needed for parasite lysis (17Peters C. Kawakami M. Ilg T. Overath P. Aebischer T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2666-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The release of PPGs into the phagolysosome may also inhibit membrane fusion events and contribute to the formation of large parasitophorous vacuoles, which are characteristic of New World species such as L. mexicana (18Peters C. Stierhof Y.-D. Ilg T. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 783-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, secretion of sAP and promastigote PPG filamentous networks by the promastigote stages may be responsible for the tendency of cells to aggregate into large clusters in stationary growth. Cell aggregation may improve the efficiency of transmission during the sand fly bite or afford cells within the cluster some protection from complement lysis during the early stages of infection (4Ilg T. Stierhof Y.-D. Wiese M. McConville M.J. Overath P. Parasitology. 1994; 108 (and references therein): S63-S71Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As this type of protein glycosylation is unique toLeishmania, the enzymes involved in initiating and assembling these glycans may be potential targets for new anti-leishmanial drugs. At present, several enzyme activities have been detected in cell-free assays and detergent extracts that are involved in the synthesis of the phosphoglycan chains of LPG, but that may also be involved in the synthesis of the shorter phosphoglycan chains of sAP and PPGs. These include two elongating enzymes, a putative α-mannose-1-phosphotransferase (MPT) and a β1–4-galactosyltransferase, that transfer Manα1-PO4and Gal from GDP-Man and UDP-Gal, respectively, to form the repeating Galβ1–4Manα1-PO4 backbone of both the LPG and PPG glycans (Fig. 1) (19Carver M.A. Turco S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10974-10981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Brown G.M. Millar A.R. Masterson C. Brimacombe J.S. Nikolaev A.V. Ferguson M.A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, a β1–3-galactosyltransferase activity that adds the L. major-specific side chains to these repeat units has also been characterized (21Ng K. Handman E. Bacic A. Glycobiology. 1996; 4: 845-853Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a separate MPT activity is thought to be involved in adding the first Man-PO4 residue to the LPG anchor precursor and thus to be required to initiate LPG phosphoglycan biosynthesis (22Mengeling B.J. Zilberstein D. Turco S.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As one of the enzymes involved in synthesizing the LPG anchor is localized to the Golgi apparatus (23Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), it is likely that both the initiating MPT and phosphoglycan chain-elongating and -branching enzymes are also localized in either a Golgi or post-Golgi compartment. This is consistent with the finding that a GDP-Man transporter required by these MPTs is also localized to the Golgi apparatus (24Ma D. Russell D.G. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3799-3805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and that phosphoglycan chain elongation is inhibited by the Golgi-perturbing ionophore, monensin (25Bates P.A. Hermes I. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 39: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified a peptide-specific MPT (pep-MPT) activity from L. mexicana promastigotes that is most likely involved in initiating protein phosphoglycosylation. Mass spectrometry of the glycopeptides containing the Man-PO4 modification provides the first direct characterization of this novel linkage. We show that pep-MPT is most active against peptides containing the Ser/Thr-rich sequences of endogenous polypeptide acceptors and that it is not inhibited by glycan acceptors of the LPG phosphoglycan-initiating and -elongating MPTs. Furthermore, we provide evidence that this enzyme occurs in a distinct subcompartment of the Golgi apparatus from enzymes involved in phosphoglycan chain elongation. Alkaline phosphatase, GDP-Man, UDP-Gal, and stachyose were from Sigma; jack bean α-mannosidase was from Boehringer Mannheim. The synthetic oligosaccharide acceptor L2 (Galβ1–4Manα1-PO4-(CH2)8CH=CH2) was generously provided by Professor Michael Ferguson (University of Dundee). GDP-[3H]Man was prepared using previously described methods (26Braell W.A. Tyo M.A. Krag S.S. Robbins P.W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 27Rush J.S.

Briefly, [2-3H]Man-6-PO4 was synthesized enzymatically from [2-3H]Man (NEN Life Science Products) using yeast hexose kinase and then converted to the sugar nucleotide using a mixture of yeast proteins supplemented with snake venom pyrophosphatase and glucose-1,6-diphosphate. The yeast proteins, corresponding to a 50–70% ammonium sulfate cut, were prepared from protease A-deficient yeast strain SC295. GDP-[3H]Man was purified on a column (1 ml) of concanavalin A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was washed with 15 mm ammonium acetate, 1 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2 and then eluted with the same buffer containing 50 mmα-methylmannoside.

Peptides were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on a Applied Biosystems Model 431A peptide synthesizer. Peptides were cleaved from the resin using 95% trifluoroacetic acid (3 h, 25 °C), recovered by extraction with diethyl ether, and purified on a C18 reversed-phase column (4.6, inner diameter, × 100 mm; Brownlee) eluted with acetonitrile (0–60%) in 0.1 mammonium acetate over 20 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Reductive methylation of sapp-1 was carried out in 0.2 m borate buffer, pH 9.0 (140 μl), containing 16 mm formaldehyde and 0.1 mm NaB3H4 (5 mCi) at 0 °C for 10 min (30Tack B.F. Dean J. Eilat D.

The mixture was acidified with 1 macetic acid to remove excess NaB3H4, and the radiolabeled peptides were recovered after application to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters) following elution with 40% acetonitrile. Promastigotes of L. mexicana (strain MNYC/BZ/62/M379) were cultivated at 27 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and harvested at mid-log growth unless otherwise stated. Amastigotes were isolated from tail lesions in BALB/c mice as described by Bateset al. (31Bates P.A. Robertson C.D. Tetley L. Coombs G.H.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation (750 × g, 10 min, 27 °C); washed once with phosphate-buffered saline; repelleted; and suspended in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 5 mm Na2EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm leupeptin, and 0.2 mm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (buffer A). Cell disruption was carried out by probe sonication (MSE Soniprep 150 Ultrasonic Disintegrator) at 0 °C using 8 × 10-s bursts at an amplitude of 24 μ with 20-s intervals between each burst. Greater than 90% cell lysis was confirmed by microscopy. Intact cells and large cell fragments were removed by centrifugation (750 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and microsomal membranes in the supernatant were recovered by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g (30 min, 4 °C). The pelleted crude microsomal membranes were resuspended in buffer A or in buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 and either used immediately or stored frozen at −70 °C. Detergent-extracted material (10 min, 0 °C) was centrifuged at 14,000 × g (5 min, 4 °C) to remove insoluble material. Triton X-100 proved to be the most effective of several detergents tested for recovery of pep-MPT activity; these included Nonidet P-40, CHAPS, Zwittergent 3–12, nonanoyl-N-methylglucamide (MEGA-9), and n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside. Protein was precipitated in chloroform/methanol/water (32Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3108) Google Scholar) prior to quantitation using the BCA assay (Pierce). pep-MPT activity was measured using two assays. In the first method, microsomal membranes (2 × 107 cell eq, 20–60 μg of protein) were resuspended in buffer A (50 μl) containing GDP-[3H]Man (160,000 cpm, 0.1–0.5 mm) and 0.4 mm synthetic peptide and incubated at 32 °C for 30 min. Triton X-100-solubilized membranes were assayed under identical conditions, except that the reaction mixture contained 0.1% Triton X-100 and assays were performed at 16 °C. The reaction mixture was diluted with 0.1 mammonium acetate (950 μl), and the enzyme reaction was terminated by boiling (3 min). Precipitated proteins was removed by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 5 min), and the supernatant was loaded onto Sep-Pak C18 cartridges pre-equilibrated in 0.1m ammonium acetate. After washing the cartridge with 0.1m ammonium acetate (10 ml) to remove unincorporated GDP-[3H]Man, [3H]Man-labeled peptide was eluted with 40% acetonitrile (3 ml), and eluted radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. In the second method, Triton X-100-solubilized membranes (2 × 107 cell eq, 20–60 μg of protein) were diluted in buffer A (15 μl) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, GDP-Man (0.5 mm), and 3H-labeled peptide (500,000 cpm, 0.16 mm). Assay mixtures were incubated at 16 °C for 15 min. In the substrate competition experiments described in the legend to Fig. 6, the reaction mixtures contained unlabeled peptide or glycan acceptors at 0–5 mm final concentration. Reactions were terminated by boiling (3 min), and the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min. Underivatized and mannosylated 3H-labeled peptides in the reaction mixture were resolved from each other by analytical thin-layer electrophoresis of 4 μl of the reaction mixture. Alternatively,3H-labeled peptides were recovered on Sep-Pak C18 cartridges as described above for subsequent chemical and enzymatic analysis. Underivatized and Man-PO4-modified peptides were separated on a C18 reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) column (4.6, inner diameter, × 100 mm; Brownlee) eluted with 0–35% acetonitrile in 0.1m ammonium acetate at 1 ml/min over 30 min. Peptides were detected by UV absorbance at 280 nm (for sapp 1, 2, 4–6) or 216 nm (for Ser11 and sapp-3). Radioactivity in 0.2-ml fractions was determined by scintillation counting. Man-PO4-modified peptide and lipo-oligosaccharide L2 acceptors were resolved on aluminum-backed Silica Gel 60 HPTLC sheets (Merck) developed in chloroform, methanol, and 0.25% KCl (10:10:3, v/v) over 10 cm. HPTLC sheets were sprayed with EN3HANCE (NEN Life Science Products) and exposed to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C. Man-PO4-modified3H-labeled peptides were resolved from unmodified3H-labeled peptides by thin-layer electrophoresis on plastic-backed cellulose thin-layer sheets (20 × 20 cm; Macherey Nagel). Aliquots of the reaction mixture (containing 100,000 cpm) were spotted onto the cellulose sheets, which were then saturated with pyridine/acetic acid/water (1:10:89, v/v) and subjected to electrophoresis (500 V, 30 mA, 75 min) under a layer of petroleum spirit and pyridine/acetic acid/water (1:10:89, v/v) in each electrophoresis chamber. Radioactivity on the dried cellulose sheets was detected using an automatic TLC scanner (Berthold) and/or by fluorography as described above. Incorporation of radioactivity into phosphoglycosylated peptides was quantitated by scraping the cellulose containing the bands using the fluorograph as template, extracting the cellulose with 30% acetonitrile (2 × 250 μl), and liquid scintillation counting of the extracts. Phosphoglycosylated peptides were digested with jack bean α-mannosidase (30 μl, 50 units/ml) in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0 (18 h, 37 °C), with or without subsequent digestion in alkaline phosphatase (2000 units/ml) in ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5 (7 h, 37 °C). For recovery of3H-labeled glycans, the enzyme digests were desalted on a column (400 μl) of AG 50-X12 (H+) over AG 3-X8 (OH−). Alternatively, 3H-labeled peptides were recovered on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (as described above), which was eluted with 40% acetonitrile. Specific cleavage of the Manα1–PO4 bond was achieved with mild acid hydrolysis in 40 mm trifluoroacetic acid (12 min, 100 °C) (3McConville M.J. Schnur L.F. Jaffe C. Schneider P. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 807-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The acid was removed by drying under high vacuum in a Speed-Vac concentrator. 3H-Labeled peptides were analyzed by thin-layer electrophoresis as described above, whereas3H-labeled glycans were analyzed by HPTLC using 1-propanol/acetone/water (9:6:5, v/v) as the solvent system (33Schneider P. Ralton J.E. McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 210: 106-112Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Unmodified and phosphoglycosylated peptides were analyzed with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT Model TSQ-700) equipped with a Finnigan MAT electrospray ionization (ESI) source and rapid capillary RP-HPLC. The column used in this study (0.2, inner diameter, × 150 mm; Vydac C18) was fabricated and operated as described elsewhere (34Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 599: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The column was developed with a linear 30-min gradient at 1.6 μl/min from 0 to 100% solvent B, where solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and solvent B was 60% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (35Moritz R.L. Eddes J.S. Reid G.E. Simpson R.J. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 907-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The ESI needle was operated at −4.5 kV. The sheath liquid was methoxyethanol delivered at 3 μl/min. Nitrogen sheath and auxiliary gasses were supplied at 30 p.s.i. and 15 units (arbitrary units), respectively. The heated capillary was set at 150 °C. Mass spectra were collected every 3 s in centroid mode. Peptide masses were calculated using Finnigan MAT BIOMASSTM software. For tandem mass spectrometric peptide sequence analysis, quadrupole Q1 was operated with a resolution of 2–2.5 Da and Q3 with a resolution of 1–1.5 Da (35Moritz R.L. Eddes J.S. Reid G.E. Simpson R.J. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 907-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The collision cell offset voltage was calculated by multiplying the mass of the ion selected for collision-induced dissociation by 0.04. The daughter ion offset voltage was set at twice the collision cell offset value. The parent ion offset voltage was set at one-third the value of the daughter ion offset voltage. Argon was used as the collision gas at a pressure of 2–2.5 millitorr. Sonicated microsomal membranes were incubated with GDP-[3H]Man in the presence of exogenous peptide acceptors and UDP-Gal as described above. Membranes were recovered by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 5 min), washed with water to remove residual peptide, and recentrifuged, and the supernatants were combined for recovery of the peptide on a Sep-Pak column as described previously. The membrane pellet was subsequently extracted twice in 1% Triton X-100 (200 μl) for 10 min at 30 °C to remove LPG and soluble phosphoglycan and proteoglycans. Insoluble material was recovered by centrifugation; the supernatants were combined and subjected to two-phase partitioning with 1-butanol; and the detergent-free aqueous phase was dried in a Speed-Vac concentrator.

We demonstrate here that the affinity of subunit interaction depends also on the solvent-exposed residues at positions 128 and 179′–184′, which interact across the dimerization surface. TetR(B) and (D), two naturally occurring sequence variants, differ at position 128 with respect to the monomer-monomer distances in the crystal structures and the charge of the amino acids, being glutamate in TetR(B) and arginine in TetR(D). In vivoanalysis of chimeric TetR(B/D) variants revealed that the single E128R exchange does not alter the dimerization specificity of TetR(B) to the one of TetR(D). When combined with specificity mutations in α10, it is, however, able to increase dimerization efficiency of the TetR(B/D) chimera with TetR(D). A loss of contact analysis revealed a positive interaction between Arg-128 and residues located at positions 179′–184′ of the second monomer. We constructed a hyperstable TetR(B) variant by replacing residues 128 and 179–184 by the respective TetR(D) sequence. These results establish that in addition to a region in the hydrophobic core residues at the solvent-exposed periphery of the dimerization surface participate in protein-protein recognition in the TetR four-helix bundle.

Protein-protein complexes play crucial roles in many biological processes such as gene expression, replication, DNA repair, signal transduction, enzyme regulation, and immune response (1Greenblatt J.

Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 248: 478-486Google Scholar). The rules determining specificity in protein-protein recognition are therefore of fundamental biological importance. Among the structural motifs mediating protein-protein recognition, assemblies of α-helices are probably most widespread (10Kohn W.D. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2583-2586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of transcription factors, e.g. is often accomplished by α-helical coiled coils (11Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar), and four-helix bundles form dimerization surfaces in many proteins (12Lin S.L. Tsai C.-J. Nussinov R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The mechanistic details governing recognition specificity and binding affinity of four-helix bundle mediated protein oligomerization are only poorly understood. We investigated subunit recognition in the four-helix bundle of Tet repressor (TetR) 1The abbreviations used are: TetR, Tet repressor; tetO , tet operator; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: TetR, Tet repressor; tetO , tet operator; WT, wild type. dimers with the goal of determining generally applicable rules for this process. TetR sequence variants regulate tetracycline-induced expression of seven naturally occurring tetracycline-resistance determinants (classes A–E, G, and H; for a review, see Ref. 13Hillen W. Berens C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 345-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In the absence of tetracycline, dimeric TetR binds to tet operator (tetO) repressing transcription of the tetpromoters. Nanomolar concentrations of tetracycline lead to dissociation of TetR from tetO to induce transcription. This transcriptional switch is exceptionally sensitive to low inducer concentrations, making it the system of choice for regulation of gene expression in many higher organisms, including plants, transgenic mice, and human cells (for two recent reviews, see Refs. 14Gatz C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 89-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar and 15Saez E. No D. West A. Evans R.M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of TetR(D) in complex with [Mg-tetracycline]+ revealed a small N-terminal and a large C-terminal domain (16Hinrichs W. Kisker C. Duevel M. Müller A. Tovar K. Hillen W. Saenger W. Science. 1994; 264: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 17Kisker C. Hinrichs W. Tovar K. Hillen W. Saenger W. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 260-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The latter mediates tetracycline binding and dimerization via a four-helix bundle formed by the helices α8 and α10 of each subunit. Disruption of the dimeric structure of TetR by urea concomitantly leads to denaturation of the subunits (18Backes H. Berens C. Helbl V. Walter S. Schmid F.X. Hillen W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5311-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have established that the sequence variants TetR(B) and TetR(D) do not form heterodimers because amino acids located in the core of the four-helix bundle in helix α10 of TetR(B) and TetR(D) lack structural complementarity (19Schnappinger D. Schubert P. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Adjusting all amino acids in α10 yielded a change in subunit recognition specificity but did not restore the full dimerization efficiency of the wild type. We demonstrate here that this requires only one additional exchange, E128R, located in helix α8 at the edge of the four-helix bundle. Furthermore, we construct a hyperstable TetR(B) variant by improving the interaction of Arg-128 with residues of the second monomer. Thus, interactions between partially solvent-exposed, hydrophilic residues can profoundly influence the specificity of subunit recognition in protein hetero-oligomers and improve the stability of homo-oligomers. Chemicals were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt), Serva (Heidelberg), Sigma (München), or Roth (Karlsruhe) and were of the highest purity available. Tetracycline was purchased from Fluka (Buchs). Enzymes for DNA restriction and modification were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim, Life Technologies, Inc. (Eggenstein), New England Biolabs (Schwalbach), or Pharmacia (Freiburg). Sequencing was carried out according to the protocol provided by Perkin Elmer for cycle sequencing. All bacterial strains are derived from Escherichia coli K12. Strain DH5α (hsdR17(rΚmΚ+),recA1,endA1,gyrA96,thi,relA1,supE44,φ80dlacZΔM15,Δ(lac ZYA-argF)U169) was used for general cloning procedures. Strain WH207 (lacX74,galK2,rpsL,recA13) served as host strain for β-galactosidase assays. The plasmids pWH1200 (20Altschmied L. Baumeister R. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W.

Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as well as pWH1950 (23Ettner N. Müller G. Berens C. Backes H. Schnappinger D. Schreppel T. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. J. Chromatogr. 1996; 742: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which were used in the in vivo studies, for the construction of tetR(B/D) mutants and overexpression have been described. The mutation E128R was introduced into tetR(B) by polymerase chain reaction according to a three-primer method (24Landt O. Grunert H.-P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The conditions of the polymerase chain reactions were as described (25Berens C. Schnappinger D. Hillen W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6936-6942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The products of the second polymerase chain reaction were purified, digested withMluI and BstEII, and cloned into likewise digested pWH853(B/D)179-208. The resulting pWH853 derivative was named pWH853(B/D)128. MluI/NcoI orMluI/BstEII fragments oftetR(B/D)179-208 and tetR(B/D)179–184 were cloned into likewise digested pWH853(B/D)128, yielding pWH853(B/D)128,179-208 and pWH853(B/D)128,179-184, respectively.tetR(B/D)51-127,129-178 andtetR(B/D)51-127,129-178,128A were constructed by introducing the R128E or R128A mutations in tetR(B/D)51-178 by polymerase chain reaction. pWH1950 derivatives were constructed fortetR(B/D)128, tetR(B/D)179-184, andtetR(B/D)128,179-184. The corresponding pWH853 derivatives were digested with XbaI andNcoI, and the tetR fragments were purified and cloned into likewise digested pWH1950. DNA of positive candidates was analyzed by digestion with restriction enzymes and sequencing oftetR. Repression and induction efficiencies of the TetR variants as well as the negative transdominance efficiencies oftetR(B)Δ26-53 andtetR(D)Δ26-53 were assayed inE. coli WH207(λtet50). The phage λtet50 contains a tetA-lacZ transcriptional fusion integrated as single copy into the WH207 genome (22Wissmann A. Wray L.V. Somaggio U. Baumeister R. Geissendorfer M. Hillen W. Genetics. 1991; 128: 225-232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown in LB supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics. Quantification of induction efficiencies was done with 0.2 μg/ml tetracycline in overnight and log-phase cultures. β-Galactosidase activities were determined as described by Miller (26Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 72-74Google Scholar). Three independent cultures were assayed for each strain, and measurements were repeated at least twice. pWH1950 or pWH1950 derivatives were transformed into E. coli RB791. Cells were grown in 3 liters of LB at 28 °C in shaking flasks. Tet repressors were overexpressed by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm at an A 600 of 0.7–1.0. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm Na3PO4, pH 6.8), and broken by sonication, and TetR was purified by cation exchange chromatography and gel filtration as described (23Ettner N. Müller G. Berens C. Backes H. Schnappinger D. Schreppel T. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. J. Chromatogr. 1996; 742: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed on a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter at protein concentrations of 5 μm in 0.5-cm cells. All measurements were carried out at a temperature of 22 °C. Equilibrium denaturation was performed by incubating protein samples overnight at the indicated urea concentration. We used F-buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for all spectroscopic measurements. Urea was obtained from ICN Biochemicals (Eschwege), and urea solutions were prepared every day. Renaturation was achieved by incubating the samples overnight at 8 murea and then diluting them 200-fold with F-buffer. Thermodynamic calculations were done as described before (18Backes H. Berens C. Helbl V. Walter S. Schmid F.X. Hillen W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5311-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Using chimeric TetR(B/D) repressors, we demonstrated previously that residues in helix α10 are critical for the different dimerization specificities of TetR(B) and TetR(D); however, further changes are required to achieve WT affinity of subunit binding (19Schnappinger D. Schubert P. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The monomer-monomer distances in the TetR(D)/[(Mg-tetracycline)+]2 crystal structure and a structural model of TetR(B) are different at residues in α10 and at position 128 in α8 (19Schnappinger D. Schubert P. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, we constructed five new TetR(B/D) repressor dimers to analyze the influence of mutations at position 128 on dimer formation. The sequences of these five dimeric TetR(B/D) repressors and those from the previous study used here again are depicted in Fig. 1. We introduced the mutation E128R into TetR(B) and TetR(B/D)179-208. The resulting repressors were named TetR(B/D)128 and TetR(B/D)128,179-208, respectively. TetR(B/D)51-127,129-178 and TetR(B/D)51-127,129-178,A128 were made to analyze whether the residue at position 128 influences dimerization specificity of TetR(B/D) repressors by attractive interactions with TetR(D) or repulsive interactions with TetR(B). These TetR(B/D)51-178 derivatives contain either the Arg → Glu or the Arg → Ala mutation at position 128. To evaluate if the interaction of the TetR(D) residues at positions 128 and 179′–184′ can be used to construct a hyperstable protein, we also introduced the mutation E128R in TetR(B/D)179-184 leading to TetR(B/D)128,179-184. ThetetR variants were transformed into E. coliWH207λtet50 to test in vivo operator binding activity and inducibility. pWH853 derivatives, which constitutively produce low levels of TetR (22Wissmann A. Wray L.V. Somaggio U. Baumeister R. Geissendorfer M. Hillen W. Genetics. 1991; 128: 225-232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were used as expression plasmids. Repression of the tetA-lacZ transcriptional fusion and inducibility by tetracycline were quantified at 37 °C. The results are shown in Table I. The presence of WT TetR(B) results in repression of β-galactosidase activity to 2.4% of that in the absence of TetR. All TetR(B/D) variants show slightly increased repression efficiencies. Repressor variants with different amino acids only at position 128 show similar repression efficiencies. All chimeric TetR(B/D) repressors were to the same extent inducible by tetracycline as WT TetR.

Open table in a new tab Dimerization of TetR(B), TetR(B/D)128, TetR(B/D)179-208, and TetR(B/D)128,179-208 with TetR(B) and TetR(D) was quantified to check whether the E128R mutation affects protein recognition. Dimerization efficiencies were determined in assays of negative transdominance using TetR(B)Δ26-53 or TetR(D)Δ26-53 as transdominance probes. Transdominance efficiencies of these mutants over TetR(B/D) variants indicate the amount of dimer formation of the TetR(B/D) variant with TetR(B) and TetR(D), respectively (19Schnappinger D. Schubert P. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The results are also shown in Table I. Efficient dimerization of TetR(B)Δ26-53 is only observed for TetR(B) and TetR(B/D)128. No dimerization is detected between TetR(B)Δ26-53 and TetR(B/D)51-208, TetR(B/D)179-208, or TetR(B/D)128,179-208. TetR(D)Δ26-53 dimerizes only with TetR variants containing at least the TetR(D) amino acids 179–208. This confirms that the main determinants of the dimerization specificities of TetR(B) and TetR(D) are located in helix α10 and that the dimerization efficiency of TetR(B)Δ26-53 with TetR(B) is not affected when E128R is present as a single exchange. The dimerization efficiency of TetR(D)Δ26-53 is about 4-fold higher for TetR(B/D)128,179-208 compared with TetR(B/D)179-208. In fact, TetR(B/D)128,179-208 exhibits the same dimerization efficiency with TetR(D)Δ26-53 than TetR(B/D)51-208, which contains the complete TetR(D) protein core. These data demonstrate that only the E128R exchange is needed to restore WT dimerization efficiency of TetR(B/D)179-208 with TetR(D)Δ26-53. The increased dimerization efficiency of Tet(B/D)128,179-208 with TetR(D) might be caused by an attractive interaction of Arg-128 or a repulsive interaction of Glu-128 with the TetR(D) monomer. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we investigated the effect of different residues at position 128 on dimerization of TetR(B/D)51-178 with TetR(D). TetR(B/D)51-178 was chosen because it forms dimers with TetR(B) and TetR(D) (Ref. 19Schnappinger D. Schubert P. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar; Table I). We performed a loss of contact analysis by mutating Arg-128 of TetR(B/D)51-178 to A128 in TetR(B/D)51-127,129-178,A128 (Fig. 1). As a control, we also constructed TetR(B/D)51-127,129-178, which contains the TetR(B) amino acid Glu-128. Dimerization with TetR(D)Δ26-53 is neither detectable for TetR(B/D)51-127,129-178,A128 nor for TetR(B/D)51-127,129-178. In contrast, the dimerization efficiency of TetR(B)Δ26-53 with these TetR variants is not affected (see Table I). Thus, the Arg-128 residue increases the dimerization efficiencies of TetR(B/D) repressors with TetR(D) by forming an attractive interaction with the other TetR(D) monomer. To test whether the TetR(B) homodimer is stabilized by interaction of Arg-128 with residues of the second monomer, we constructed TetR(B/D)128,179-184. This variant contains Arg-128 and those TetR(D) residues which contact Arg-128 across the dimerization surface. TetR(B/D)179-184 and TetR(B/D)128,179-184 show identical dimerization efficiencies with TetR(B)Δ26-53 and TetR(D)Δ26-53 (Table I). Thus, the E128R exchange does not alter the dimerization specificity of TetR(B/D)179-184. The in vitro stabilities of TetR(B), TetR(B/D)128, TetR(B/D)179-184, and TetR(B/D)128,179-184 were determined by urea-induced unfolding. After unfolding in 8m urea and refolding by a subsequent 200-fold dilution in urea-free buffer, the CD spectrum of the respective TetR was identical to that of the native protein (data not shown) and more than 92% of the tetracycline-binding activity was recovered after the unfolding/refolding cycle (Table II). We conclude that denaturation under these conditions is reversible. The urea-induced unfolding of the TetR(B/D) chimera as followed by the change of the CD shows a monophasic, sigmoidal decrease (Fig.2), and the midpoint of the unfolding transition depends on the protein concentration (data not shown), as expected for a bimolecular reaction. Thus, as for TetR(B) (18Backes H. Berens C. Helbl V. Walter S. Schmid F.X. Hillen W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5311-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), unfolding of the TetR(B/D) chimera is quantitatively described by a two-state model, in which only folded dimers and unfolded monomers exist at equilibrium in significant concentrations. Calculated thermodynamic stabilities of the TetR(B/D) variants are also given in Table II. The Gibbs free energy of unfolding of 75.2 ± 4 kJ mol−1 determined for TetR(B) resembles the previously published results (18Backes H. Berens C. Helbl V. Walter S. Schmid F.X. Hillen W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5311-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The stabilities of TetR(B/D)128 and TetR(B/D)179-184 are identical to that of TetR(B). In contrast, a stability increase of 12 kJ mol−1 is found for TetR(B/D)128,179-184. These results demonstrate that the urea-dependent unfolding stability of TetR(B) is only increased when positions 128 and 179′–184′ are altered together, but not when only either one of them is changed.Table IIReversible denaturation and thermodynamic data of TetR variantsTetR variantReversibilityaTetracycline binding obtained after de- and renaturation.From CDbThe identical results were obtained by following fluorescence.activity [%]ΔG [kJ mol−1]urea12 [m](B)9674.6 ± 44.7(B/D)1289277.2 ± 34.9(B/D)179–1849377.9 ± 14.8(B/D)128,179–1849586.7 ± 35.6a Tetracycline binding obtained after de- and renaturation.b The identical results were obtained by following fluorescence. Open table in a new tab Negative transdominance reflects the amount of dimer formedin vivo by the TetR deletion mutants used as probes and the TetR variant of interest (19Schnappinger D. Schubert P. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A comparison of the negative transdominance efficiencies of TetR(D)Δ26-53 over TetR(B/D)51-127,129-178, TetR(B/D)51-127,129-178,128A, and TetR(B/D)51-178 as well as TetR(B/D)128,179-208 and TetR(B/D)179-208 shows that mutations at position 128 influence the dimerization potential of Tet(B/D) repressors with TetR(D). Dimerization of TetR(B/D)51-178 with TetR(D) is abolished after mutating Arg-128 to Glu or Ala, whereas that of TetR(B/D)179-208 is increased after introducing the additional E128R exchange. The dimerization efficiency of TetR(B/D)128,179-208 is almost identical to that of TetR(B/D)51-208, which contains the complete TetR(D) protein core. The single amino acid Arg-128 is essential for dimerization of TetR(B/D)51-178 with TetR(D) and sufficient to restore WT dimerization efficiency in TetR(B/D)179-208. Thus, no other TetR(D) residues than Arg-128 and those in the segment 179–208 influence the dimerization between Tet(B/D) repressors and TetR(D). Dimerization of TetR(B) or TetR(B/D)179-184 with TetR(D) is not affected by mutating Glu-128 to Arg-128. The mutation E128R alone is, therefore, not sufficient for dimerization of TetR(B) with TetR(D). This is in agreement with previous results, which identified the amino acids 188, 192, 193, and 197 as the main determinants of the TetR(B)/(D) dimerization specificity (19Schnappinger D. Schubert P. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action by which Arg-128 influences dimerization with TetR(D) is revealed by the mutations R128E and R128A in TetR(B/D)51-178. Both mutations abolish dimerization with TetR(D). Because R128A is a loss of contact mutation, the increased dimerization efficiency of Tet(B/D) repressors containing Arg-128 with TetR(D) is caused by a positive interaction and not a repulsive interaction of the TetR(B) amino acid Glu-128 with the TetR(D) monomer. In contrast to the dimerization with TetR(D), dimerization of TetR(B/D) variants with TetR(B) is not affected by mutations at position 128. The negative transdominance efficiencies of TetR(B)Δ26-53 over TetR variants differing only in the residue at position 128—like TetR(B)versus TetR(B/D)128, TetR(B/D)179-184 versusTetR(B/D)128,179-184, and TetR(B/D)51-178 versusTetR(B/D)51-127,129-178 or TetR(B/D)51-127,129-178,A128—are almost identical. Thus, amino acids at position 128 are not important for dimer formation with TetR(B), and no attractive interaction between the amino acid at position 128 and the second monomer exists in the TetR(B) dimer. The tetO-binding activities and inducibilities of the TetR variants are only marginally affected by the mutations E128R, R128E, or R128A. The mutants showing improved heterodimerization efficiency andin vitro stability are functional. On the other hand, all TetR(B/D) mutants with a reduced dimerization efficiency show a loss of function. This verifies that no major changes are introduced in the structure of TetR. The properties of the mutations can, therefore, be interpreted using the TetR(D) crystal structure. Arg-128 is located at the N terminus of α8 in this structure and forms a hydrogen bond to Gln-184′ in α10, the two helices of the four-helix bundle dimerization surface (Ref. 17Kisker C. Hinrichs W. Tovar K. Hillen W. Saenger W. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 260-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar; Figs. 3and 4). Because positions 128 and 184 bear Glu and Pro in TetR(B), respectively, the hydrogen bond observed in the TetR(D) crystal structure can neither be formed in the TetR(B) dimer nor in heterodimers between TetR(D) and TetR(B/D) chimera containing the TetR(D) amino acids of α10 and Glu-128. This explains why mutations at positions 128 selectively affect dimerization of Tet(B/D) repressors with TetR(D) but not with TetR(B).Figure 4Proposed interaction of the TetR(D) residues Arg-128 (blue) with Q184′ (red).The respective residues of TetR(B) are overlaid in orange(Glu-128) and purple (Pro-184′). Helices belonging to different monomers are shown in yellow and gray as in Fig.3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In agreement with the conclusions discussed so far, the stability of TetR(B) is profoundly increased by introducing Arg-128 and the TetR(D) residues contacting Arg-128 across the dimerization surface. The stability of TetR(B) is not changed by replacing either residue at 128 or 179′–184′ by the corresponding TetR(D) amino acids, but combining the mutation in TetR(B/D)128,179-184 increases ΔG by 12 kJ mol−1. Hydrogen bond formation between Arg-128 and Gln-184′ most likely is responsible for the increased stability of TetR(B/D)128,179-184, but the nature of that interaction cannot be concluded from the current data. The negative transdominance presently cannot be quantitatively related to the dissociation constant or ΔΔG. Because the negative transdominance correlates with the amount of heterodimer formed in vivo (19Schnappinger D. Schubert P. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and the thermodynamic stability in vitro, it provides a valid qualitative measure of dimerization efficiencies. Recognition between polypeptides has been investigated in several proteins. One of the best analyzed examples is the complex formed between the human growth hormone and its receptor. A saturating alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the hormone-receptor interface supported the so-called “hot spot concept” of protein-protein recognition (27Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar), where only a few amino acids of a larger interface account for the affinity in protein complexes. These residues are mostly hydrophobic and are located in the center of the interaction surface, whereas the primarily hydrophilic residues at the periphery of the interaction surface are unimportant (7Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 27Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). The main determinants of the TetR(B)/(D) dimerization specificity are four residues of helix α10 that are located in the center of the four-helix bundle (19Schnappinger D. Schubert P. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, the hot spot concept seems also to be valid for protein recognition during TetR dimerization. However, an additional mechanism must influence protein-protein recognition in TetR because even the exchange of the complete α10 is not sufficient to restore WT dimer formation with TetR(D) in a Tet(B/D) repressor. The results presented here establish that the additional recognition present in TetR only depends on the partially solvent-exposed residues at position 128 and at 179–184. The arginine residue at position 128 is 95% solvent-exposed (calculated using GRASP (31Nicolls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar)) compared with a surface accessibility of 89, 83, and 79% for the arginine residues at positions 28, 62, and 87, respectively, which are not involved in dimerization. The leucine residue at position 193 in the center of the four-helix bundle, where it contributes to dimerization specificity (19Schnappinger D. Schubert P. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), shows 0% solvent accessibility. Thus, the specificity of protein-protein recognition in the TetR four-helix bundle is mediated by a dual mechanism that is determined by the buried residues in the center of the dimerization surface and also by partially solvent-exposed residues located at the edge of the dimerization surface. Dimerization of leucine zipper peptides is profoundly influenced by the interaction of hydrophilic residues at the Glu and Gly positions, and mutations at these positions can be sufficient to change dimerization specificity (28O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Cell. 1992; 68: 699-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 29Vinson C.R. Hai T. Boyd S.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). However, recent results demonstrated that the patterns of charged residues at the Glu and Gly positions are not sufficient to predict dimerization specificities of many leucine zipper mutants (30Zeng X. Zhu H. Lashuel H.A. Hu J.C. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2218-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These results support the view that the dual mechanism of protein recognition established for the TetR four-helix bundle might as well apply for other protein complexes."

Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5963-5968Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).

K. lactis genomic clone contained near one end the open reading frame of the UDP-GlcNAc transporter gene (see Fig. 2 in Ref. 5Abeijon C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5963-5968Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) that this clone might also contain the open reading frame for theN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. We therefore transformed the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase mutant (mnn2–1) with a plasmid containing the above 9.5-kb genomic clone and determined whether the wild-type phenotype had been restored. This was measured by the ability of transformants to bind GSII-FITC, a fluorescent-conjugated lectin that detects terminal α- or β-linkedN-acetylglucosamine; this approach had been previously used to detect wild-type phenotypic restoration of this sugar in the Golgi transporter-deficient mutant mnn2–2 (5Abeijon C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5963-5968Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We found that the above 9.5-kb genomic clone did, indeed, restore the wild-type phenotype of the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase mutant and that this phenotype was the result of the mutants having regained their ability to transfer N-acetylglucosamine to mannose acceptors. After subcloning of the above 9.5-kb genomic fragment, a smaller one containing an ORF of 1,383 kb encoding a protein of 460 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 53 kDa also restored the wild-type phenotype. Together, these studies demonstrate that this latter protein is the K. lactisα(1→2) N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase and that the genes for this enzyme as well as the UDP-GlcNAc transporter, each with their own promoter, are contiguous in the K. lactisgenome.

All transformations were performed by electroporation as described before (5Abeijon C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Polymerase chain reactions were made usingPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) in a PTC-100 thermal controller (MJ Research, Watertown, MA). K. lactisstrain MW103–1C (Mat α, uraA, lysA, K+, pKD+) (6Chen X.J. Wesolowski-Louvel M. Tanguy-Rougeau C. Fukuhara H.

KL11 (Mat a, mnn2–1, uraA, lysA, K+, pKD+) was obtained by crossing MW103–1C with Y-43α (3–55) as described in Ref. 7Herman A. Halverson H. J. Bacteriol. 1963; 85: 895-900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar followed by sporulation and tetrad dissection. K. lactis cells were grown at 26 °C either in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose media or SD-U synthetic uracyl-free media (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, and 2% SCM-URA (synthetic mix of amino acids and inositol) (8Kaiser C.

Two additional plasmids were derived from the initial genomic clone in pCA66 to narrow the position of theN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. After digestion of pCA66 with NheI and SalI, the resulting 4.3-kbNhe-Nhe fragment was subcloned into theNhe site of the K. lactis expression vector Kep 6 (9Wesolowski-Louvel M. Tanguy-Rougeau C. Fukuhara H. Yeast. 1988; 4: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) generating pCE1. The 2.3-kb Nhe-Sal fragment was subcloned into Kep 6 linearized with Nhe andSal, generating pCE2. Plasmid pCA73 was described previously (5Abeijon C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5963-5968Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). K. lactis cells, grown either in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose media or uracyl-free media, were labeled with GSII-FITC and run through a FACScan (Becton Dickinson) as described previously (10Guillen E. Abeijon C. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7888-7892Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Golgi-enriched membranes fromK. lactis were obtained as described (4Abeijon C. Mandon E.C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8851-8858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Enzyme assays were performed as described previously (2Smith W.L. Nakajima T. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3426-3435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 50 μg of membrane protein and 2 μm UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (240 cpm/pmol) and 0.5 mm3–0-α-d-mannopyranosyl-d-mannopyranoside in 20 mm imidazole-HCl, 20 mmMgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 6.5. Incubations were at 30 °C for 20 min. The 4.3-kb NheI fragment derived from pCA66 and containing the complete ORF for theN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase was subcloned into pBluescript II SK (+) (Stratagene) linearized with XbaI. Sequencing was performed in an Applied Biosystems DNA sequencer by using the dideoxy chain termination method (Molecular Genetics Facility, University of Georgia, Athens, GA). Sequences were assembled and analyzed using DNAstar programs (DNAstar, Madison, WI), and data base searches were made through the NCBI Blast server (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD) Total RNA was obtained from Y-43 α (3–55) and Y-43 α by the acidic phenol method (11Collart M.A. Oliveiero S. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 13.12Google Scholar), and 15 μg/lane were separated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and capillary-transferred to a nylon Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (12Brown T. Mackey K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 4.9Google Scholar). Prehybridization was performed at high stringency conditions by including the membrane in 50% formamide, 10× Denhardt's, 6× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml salmon sperm single-stranded DNA at 42 °C for 4 h. Hybridization was done overnight at 42 °C with double-stranded DNA probes labeled with an oligolabeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [α-32P]dCTP as indicated by the manufactures. Membranes were washed at 42 °C in 2× SSC (1× SSC= 0.15m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS two times, and then two times in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. The final wash was done twice in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Probes were obtained by polymerase chain reaction using pCA66 as template and the primers 7N0740 (5′-CAGAGTTCATCCCAGATTTGAC-3′) and 7H2017 (5′-TATGGTACTACCTTTTACGCACGG-3′) for the-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase and 3P1234 (5′-AGCTCATTTCTGGTACTATTTCG-3′) and 7H0286 (5′-ATTTACGCACTAGAAGCACGACAG-3′) for the UDPN-acetylglucosamine transporter. In both cases the product included most of the ORF. Polymerase chain reaction reaction products were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel, and the band of interest was cut and eluted by freeze-thaw and centrifugation in Spin-X centrifuge tube filters (Costar Inc., Corning, NY). DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol-precipitated before being used in the labeling reaction. Based on the previous observation by Ballou and co-workers (2Smith W.L. Nakajima T. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3426-3435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that crossings between what is now known to be the UDP-GlcNAc transporter mutant and the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase mutant indicated that both genes were in close proximity, and the existence of sufficient DNA at either side of the transporter gene in the genomic clone to contain the transferase ORF led us to hypothesize that the 9.5-kb genomic clone might also contain the transferase gene. Our strategy to isolate the genomic DNA encoding the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase relied on the isolation of those K. lactis mnn2–1 transformants that had acquired wild-type binding to GSII-FITC lectin after transformation with the genomic insert-containing plasmid encoding also the K. lactis Golgi UDP-GlcNAc transporter (5Abeijon C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5963-5968Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). K. lactis KL11, anN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-deficient strain, was transformed with the above pCA66 plasmid containing the 9.5-kb genomic DNA fragment. Cells were plated in uracyl-free media, individual colonies were isolated and replated, and cells were labeled with GSII-FITC lectin. Fig. 1 shows that the transformed mutant K. lactis cells, growing in uracyl-free media, had acquired fluorescence in the wild-type range. This suggests a restoration of N-acetylglucosamine to cell wall mannans and that the corresponding transferase activity was now functional (see below). To further determine the region of the genomic 9.5-kb fragment encoding theN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, the DNA was digested with restriction enzymes so that an Nhe-Nhe fragment of 4.3-kb (pCE1) and one Nhe-SalI of 2.3 Kb (pCE2) were obtained (Fig.2 A). The 4.3-kb insert-containing plasmid was still able to restore fully the GSII-FITC binding phenotype as wild-type cells, whereas the one containing the 2.3 kb was not, as did pCA73 containing the entire ORF for the transporter (Fig. 2 B). To determine directly whether this wild-type phenotype recovery was indeed the result of restoration ofN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity, Golgi-enriched membranes were prepared from KL11 transformed with pCE1, and enzymatic activity was measured in vitro using 3–0-α-d-mannopyranosyl-d-mannopyranoside as exogenous acceptor. As can be seen in Fig.3, pCE1 was able to restore the transferase activity to levels comparable or even slightly higher than wild-type cells. Sequencing the genomic DNA of pCE1 revealed an ORF of 1383 bp encoding a protein of 460 amino acids (Fig. 4). The predicted molecular mass of the polypeptide is 53 kDa with a pI of 4.98, in excellent agreement with the pI of 4.9 previously determined during the enzyme purification (3Douglas R.H. Ballou C.E. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1561-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The reported molecular mass of the partially purified native protein, obtained by size-exclusion chromatography of detergent-solubilized enzyme in detergent-free buffer, is 300 kDa (3Douglas R.H. Ballou C.E. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1561-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), raising the possibly that the enzyme is multimeric or tightly associated with other proteins. The ORF is located upstream from the gene encoding the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transporter and separated by an intergenic region of 948 bp. Both genes are transcribed in the same direction. Analysis of the primary sequence reveals a putative type II protein; toward the amino terminus there is a likely noncleavable signal peptide determining a transmembrane-anchoring segment separating 10 amino acids, probably a cytoplasmic tail, from a 431-luminal domain presumptively containing the substrate recognition and catalytic site. There are four consensus N-glycosylation sites through the protein (Fig. 5, panel A); most likely some of them are utilized, as Douglas and Ballou (3Douglas R.H. Ballou C.E. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1561-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) reported binding of enzymatic activity to concanavalin A (3Douglas R.H. Ballou C.E.

A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) isboxed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Northern blots of total RNA from wild-type strain Y-43α show two transcripts of 2.4 and 1.5 kb using as probe the UDP-GlcNAc transferase gene (Fig.6). The same two transcripts are in the mnn2–1 transferase mutant but with lesser intensity (Fig. 6). Preliminary results from our laboratory 2L. Puglielli, personal communication. indicate that there is a nonsense mutation in the ORF of the transferase gene. This type of mutation is known to induce message instability, and the results of Fig. 5 appear to suggest that this indeed has occurred. Although the 2.4-kb transcript has the size to contain the ORFs of the transporter and the transferase, when the same membrane is probed for the transporter, only a band of 1.5 kb could be seen (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the intensity of the transcript for the transporter was similar both in the wild type and in the mutant for the transferase; therefore, it can be concluded that the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transporter and theN-acetylglucosamine transferase are transcribed into independent messenger RNAs. Besides the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Kl-GNT1) reported in this paper, the only other known eukaryotic UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:oligosaccharide α-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases are α-GlcNAc TI and TII, which participate in the synthesis of heparin/heparan sulfate, transferring α-N-acetylglucosamine to glucuronic acid in the core or in the elongating polymer, respectively (13Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28809-28814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently Lindet al. (14Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormic C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26265-26268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) reported that the α-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase and glucuronyl transferase activities necessary to elongate glycans in heparan sulfate-type proteoglycans were contained in a single polypeptide of 70 kDa. This polypeptide shows no significant overall homology with Kl-GNT1p (15% identity and 23% similarity). Sequence analysis of the glycosyltransferases cloned so far detects little if any sequence homology between members of catalytically distinct families of enzymes (15Natsuka S. Lowe J.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 683-691Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Field M.C. Wainwright L.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This is true even in most of the cases where they have in common either the sugar donor or the acceptor. We found extensive homology only with YOR320p of S. cerevisiae. (36% identical, 55% similar at amino acid level throughout the entire ORF). This is a 491-amino acid protein with a putative noncleavable endoplasmic reticulum translocation signal determining a 10 amino acid cytoplasmic tail and a large lumenal domain whose function is still undetermined. It doesn't seem likely that YOR320p has a similar enzymatic activity than its K. lactis homolog, and no oligosaccharide or glycolipid modified withN-acetylglucosamine has been described so far in S. cerevisiae, although the possibility that such modification is transiently present at some point during the cell cycle or under certain growth conditions cannot be ruled out. An interesting possibility is that both YOR320p and YEL004p (theS. cerevisiae sequence homolog of the K. lactisUDP N-acetylglucosamine transporter) operate on the same, yet unknown, pathway in a similar manner as their K. lactishomologs do. In this case, probably solving the problem of the biochemical role of one of the above proteins will answer the function of the other as well. Surprisingly, a domain with 23% identity and 48% similarity spanning amino acids 97 through 210 in the putative Golgi luminal portion of K1-GNT1p was found to be conserved with glycogenins of diverse origin (Fig. 5 B). This domain is also highly conserved among a group of glycogenin-like proteins from nematodes, plants, fungi, and bacteria (17Roach P.J. Skurat A.V. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 57: 289-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this domain also contains the sequence IVYFDSDSI, comprising amino acids 193 to 201 (Fig. 5 B). This is a highly conserved motif found among a very broad group of glycosyltransferases in the form of a consensus sequence hhhhDXDXh (where h is a hydrophobic amino acid) (18Wiggins C.A.R. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Aspartates in the motif DXD were found to be essential for the activity of the S. cerevisiae Mnn1p α-1,3-mannosyltransferase, with folding or oligomerization not being affected (18Wiggins C.A.R. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations of the aspartic acids of the same motif in the lethal toxin of Clostridium sordelli abolishes its glucosyltransferase activity and toxicity (19Busch C. Hofmann F. Selzer J. Munro S. Jaeckel D. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19566-19572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Affinity-labeling with azido UDP-glucose is also suppressed. It has been hypothesized (18Wiggins C.A.R. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) that this domain may play a role in the coordination of the interactions between the divalent cation required for these enzymes to be active and the pyrophosphate in the sugar nucleotides they use as donors of the glycosidic moiety. Thus, it could be the case that this homologous domain in K1-GNT1p may play a similar role, interacting with the UDP-GlcNAc, although the significance of the more extended homology with glycogenins is unclear. It is very interesting to find two genes of related functions being contiguous in the genome of a eukaryote such K. lactis. Although such occurrence is common in prokaryotes, with their widespread occurrence of operons, its incidence in eukaryotes is much rarer. The norm in eukaryotes is that genes of related functions are transcribed individually and are scattered throughout the genome. However, there are several examples of clustered genes of related functions. Some even are cotranscribed from a single promoter into a polycistronic messenger as in bacterial operons. Examples are found in trypanosomatides, nematodes, mammals, and plants (reviewed in Ref.20Blumenthal T. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 480-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar.) Of particular appeal is the case of the MAL loci in S. cerevisiae. Each locus comprises at least three genes: a trans-acting activator, a maltose permease, and maltase (21Needleman R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2079-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). They determine a unit comprising a regulatory gene adjacent to the genes of related functions it controls, translated as independent transcripts (22Needleman R.B. Kaback D.B. Dubin R.A. Perkins E.L. Rosenberg N.G. Sutherland K.A. Forrest D.B. Michels C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2811-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is very tempting to speculate that this may very well be the case for the genes for the UDP-GlcNAc transporter and transferase inK. lactis, and studies are currently under way in our laboratory to address this question. It has been proposed (23Wolfe K.H. Shields D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar) that S. cerevisiae ancestors arose from the fusion of two diploid cells to form a tetraploid, thus leading to genome duplication, followed by extensive gene deletions and reciprocal translocation between chromosomes leading to gene rearrangement. This event seemingly happened after the common ancestor of K. lactis and S. cerevisiae had diverged. This hypothesis may explain why the homologue genes of the transferase and the transporter of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, although contiguous in the genome of K. lactis, are in a single copy on different chromosomes in S. cerevisiae. It remains to be seen if the contiguity in the genome of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transporter gene and K1-GNT1 has any physiological significance. Nothing is known about the possible regulation of the expression of either protein depending upon particular physiological conditions of the organism. If such a variation exists, it will be interesting to see if the levels of mRNA and/or activity for these two proteins are related.

Each of two related recombinase proteins, XerC and XerD, cleaves a specific pair of DNA strands, exchanges them, and rejoins them to the partner DNA molecule during a complete recombination reaction. The rejoining activity of recombinase XerC has been analyzed using isolated covalent XerC-DNA complexes resulting from DNA cleavage reactions upon Holliday junction substrates. These covalent protein-DNA complexes are competent in the rejoining reaction, demonstrating that covalently bound XerC can catalyze strand rejoining in the absence of other proteins. This contrasts with a recombinase-mediated cleavage reaction, which requires the presence of both recombinases, the recombinase mediating catalysis at any given time requiring activation by the partner recombinase. In a recombining nucleoprotein complex, both cleavage and rejoining can occur prior to dissociation of the complex.

Recombination occurs at specific target sites and requires the catalytic action of two recombinase proteins, XerC and XerD (2Blakely G.W. May G. McCulloch R. Arciszewska L.K. Burke M. Lovett S.T Sherratt D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 351-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Homologues of XerC and XerD have been identified in many bacteria with circular chromosomes. The Xer proteins are members of the bacteriophage λ integrase family of recombinases. Members of this family contain two highly conserved motifs, containing four invariant residues: a tyrosine, which acts as the nucleophile during strand cleavage, and two arginines and a histidine (the RHR triad), which have been implicated in the activation of the scissile phosphodiester in both the cleavage and rejoining reactions. The two arginines are thought to stabilize the pentavalent phosphate transition state, whereas the histidine may act as a general base catalyst (3Esposito D. Scocca J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3605-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 4Nunes-Düby S.E. Kwon H. Tirumalai R. Ellenberger T. Landy A.

Recent structural and biochemical studies have revealed two further residues that are directly implicated in catalysis. An invariant lysine is present in a conserved β turn, lying between motifs I and II, in the recombinases and the structurally and mechanistically related type 1B topoisomerases. A second histidine in motif II contacts the scissile phosphate and may participate in the general acid-base catalysis; this histidine, although well conserved, is not invariant, being a tryptophan in Cre recombinase (5Sherratt D.J.

Biol. 1995; 5: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Each strand exchange involves two trans-esterification steps; the strand cleavage reaction occurs by a nucleophilic attack of the active site tyrosine upon the activated DNA phosphodiester producing a 3′-phosphotyrosyl bond and a 5′-OH. The second rejoining reaction occurs when nucleophilic attack of a 5′-OH on the 3′-phosphotyrosyl bond restores the continuity of the DNA strand and displaces the tyrosine. If the 5′-OH comes from the cleaved DNA partner, strand exchange has occurred.Because site-specific recombinases break and rejoin DNA phosphodiester bonds, these enzymes have evolved mechanisms to ensure that efficient recombination occurs only on correctly aligned recombination sites that have been bound by the four recombinase molecules needed to catalyze the cleavage and rejoining of four DNA phosphodiester bonds. The structure of Cre bound to Holliday junction DNA (6Gopaul D.N. Guo F. Van Duyne G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4175-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) provides support for biochemically based models that suggest DNA conformation, and protein-protein interactions play a key role in determining which pair of recombinase molecules within a tetrameric recombination complex are to be active at any point in time (12Arciszewska L.K.

The failure of singly bound XerC or XerD molecules to catalyze efficient DNA cleavage suggests that XerC and XerD each activates catalysis of its partner recombinase when bound to DNA (12Arciszewska L.K. Grainge I. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3731-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The inappropriate positioning of the active site tyrosine for in-line attack on the scissile DNA phosphate in the crystal structure of a XerD provides a structural basis for both monomer inactivity and partner recombinase-mediated activation through correct repositioning of the tyrosine nucleophile (14Subramanya H.S.

Cell. 1984; 36: 1097-1103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), recombination occurs with a distinct order of strand exchange, with XerC catalyzing the first pair of exchanges to form the Holliday junction intermediate (18McCulloch R.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1172-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In psi site recombination, the junction is then resolved to products by XerD-mediated strand exchange (19Colloms D.S.

Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2112-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The use of a Holliday junction-containing substrate allows the analysis of the cleavage, rejoining, and strand exchange steps, as well as their controlling factors, during a reaction on the same substrate. Neither XerC nor XerD on its own is active in DNA cleavage or strand exchange upon Holliday junctions (12Arciszewska L.K. Grainge I. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3731-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Arciszewska L.K. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2112-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26Arciszewska L.K. Grainge I. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2651-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), implying that interaction between the two recombinases is necessary to produce an active site configuration that is competent for cleavage. Using either a linear suicide substrate or a supercoiled plasmid substrate, inefficient cleavage or topoisomerase activity, respectively, has been observed in the absence of the partner recombinase (27Cornet F. Hallett B. Sherratt D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21927-21931Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Blakely G.W. Davidson A.O. Sherratt D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).The rejoining reaction is much less well characterized than the cleavage step in integrase family-mediated recombination. Previous studies of rejoining have been carried out using the Flp recombinase with either activated substrates bearing a 3′-phosphotyrosyl bond or a half-site DNA substrate (29Pan G. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12397-12399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Pan G. Luetke K. Sadowski P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3167-3175Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The homology dependence of rejoining was also studied using half-sites and full sites with mismatched bases (31Zhu X. Pan G. Luetke K. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11646-11653Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32Lee J. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4042-4052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study we have used isolated covalent protein-DNA complexes resulting from XerC-mediated cleavage of a Holliday junction to study the rejoining reaction and its requirements for interactions with partner recombinases. This fully paired linear full site substrate with a covalently attached wild-type protein should be equivalent to the true covalent intermediate produced in a wild-type reaction. As well as providing a wild-type substrate for the study of rejoining, it also extends the analysis of the rejoining step of recombination to a second member of the integrase family of recombinases and allows dissection of the protein interactions necessary for catalysis. A major conclusion is that a covalently bound XerC molecule can catalyze DNA rejoining in cis; the presence of XerD does not stimulate the reaction and therefore is not required to activate XerC-mediated rejoining. Xer site-specific recombination functions in the stable segregation of circular replicons in Escherichia coli by resolving circular multimers that can arise by homologous recombination or rolling circle replication (reviewed in Ref. 1Sherratt D.J. Arciszewska L.K. Blakely G. Colloms S. Grant K. Leslie N. McCulloch R. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.-Biol. Sci. 1995; 347: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recombination occurs at specific target sites and requires the catalytic action of two recombinase proteins, XerC and XerD (2Blakely G.W. May G. McCulloch R. Arciszewska L.K. Burke M. Lovett S.T Sherratt D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 351-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Homologues of XerC and XerD have been identified in many bacteria with circular chromosomes. The Xer proteins are members of the bacteriophage λ integrase family of recombinases. Members of this family contain two highly conserved motifs, containing four invariant residues: a tyrosine, which acts as the nucleophile during strand cleavage, and two arginines and a histidine (the RHR triad), which have been implicated in the activation of the scissile phosphodiester in both the cleavage and rejoining reactions. The two arginines are thought to stabilize the pentavalent phosphate transition state, whereas the histidine may act as a general base catalyst (3Esposito D. Scocca J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3605-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 4Nunes-Düby S.E. Kwon H. Tirumalai R. Ellenberger T. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 391-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 5Sherratt D.J. Wigley D.B.

Recent structural and biochemical studies have revealed two further residues that are directly implicated in catalysis. An invariant lysine is present in a conserved β turn, lying between motifs I and II, in the recombinases and the structurally and mechanistically related type 1B topoisomerases. A second histidine in motif II contacts the scissile phosphate and may participate in the general acid-base catalysis; this histidine, although well conserved, is not invariant, being a tryptophan in Cre recombinase (5Sherratt D.J. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 149-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Gopaul D.N. Guo F. Van Duyne G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4175-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Integrase family-mediated recombination proceeds via two temporally and spatially separated pairs of strand exchanges, producing a Holliday junction as an intermediate (6Gopaul D.N. Guo F. Van Duyne G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4175-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 7Hoess R. Wierzbicki A. Abremski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1988; 204: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 10Nunes-Düby S.E. Matsumoto L. Landy A. Cell. 1987; 50: 779-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 11Nunes-Düby S.E. Azaro M.A. Landy A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Each strand exchange involves two trans-esterification steps; the strand cleavage reaction occurs by a nucleophilic attack of the active site tyrosine upon the activated DNA phosphodiester producing a 3′-phosphotyrosyl bond and a 5′-OH. The second rejoining reaction occurs when nucleophilic attack of a 5′-OH on the 3′-phosphotyrosyl bond restores the continuity of the DNA strand and displaces the tyrosine. If the 5′-OH comes from the cleaved DNA partner, strand exchange has occurred. Because site-specific recombinases break and rejoin DNA phosphodiester bonds, these enzymes have evolved mechanisms to ensure that efficient recombination occurs only on correctly aligned recombination sites that have been bound by the four recombinase molecules needed to catalyze the cleavage and rejoining of four DNA phosphodiester bonds. The structure of Cre bound to Holliday junction DNA (6Gopaul D.N. Guo F. Van Duyne G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4175-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) provides support for biochemically based models that suggest DNA conformation, and protein-protein interactions play a key role in determining which pair of recombinase molecules within a tetrameric recombination complex are to be active at any point in time (12Arciszewska L.K. Grainge I. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3731-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Azaro M.A. Landy A.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5178-5187Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The failure of singly bound XerC or XerD molecules to catalyze efficient DNA cleavage suggests that XerC and XerD each activates catalysis of its partner recombinase when bound to DNA (12Arciszewska L.K. Grainge I. Sherratt D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3731-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The inappropriate positioning of the active site tyrosine for in-line attack on the scissile DNA phosphate in the crystal structure of a XerD provides a structural basis for both monomer inactivity and partner recombinase-mediated activation through correct repositioning of the tyrosine nucleophile (14Subramanya H.S. Arciszewska L.K. Baker R.A. Bird L.E. Sherratt D.J. Wigley D.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5178-5187Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).
