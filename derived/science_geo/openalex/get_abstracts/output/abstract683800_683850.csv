https://openalex.org/W3212912034,"Protein-protein interactions play critical roles in biology, but the structures of many eukaryotic protein complexes are unknown, and there are likely many interactions not yet identified. We take advantage of advances in proteome-wide amino acid coevolution analysis and deep-learning–based structure modeling to systematically identify and build accurate models of core eukaryotic protein complexes within the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome. We use a combination of RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold to screen through paired multiple sequence alignments for 8.3 million pairs of yeast proteins, identify 1505 likely to interact, and build structure models for 106 previously unidentified assemblies and 806 that have not been structurally characterized. These complexes, which have as many as five subunits, play roles in almost all key processes in eukaryotic cells and provide broad insights into biological function."

T cells can contribute to the rapid clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections1-3. Here we hypothesize that pre-existing memory T cell responses, with cross-protective potential against SARS-CoV-2 (refs. 4-11), would expand in vivo to support rapid viral control, aborting infection. We measured SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells, including those against the early transcribed replication-transcription complex (RTC)12,13, in intensively monitored healthcare workers (HCWs) who tested repeatedly negative according to PCR, antibody binding and neutralization assays (seronegative HCWs (SN-HCWs)). SN-HCWs had stronger, more multispecific memory T cells compared with a cohort of unexposed individuals from before the pandemic (prepandemic cohort), and these cells were more frequently directed against the RTC than the structural-protein-dominated responses observed after detectable infection (matched concurrent cohort). SN-HCWs with the strongest RTC-specific T cells had an increase in IFI27, a robust early innate signature of SARS-CoV-2 (ref. 14), suggesting abortive infection. RNA polymerase within RTC was the largest region of high sequence conservation across human seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV) and SARS-CoV-2 clades. RNA polymerase was preferentially targeted (among the regions tested) by T cells from prepandemic cohorts and SN-HCWs. RTC-epitope-specific T cells that cross-recognized HCoV variants were identified in SN-HCWs. Enriched pre-existing RNA-polymerase-specific T cells expanded in vivo to preferentially accumulate in the memory response after putative abortive compared to overt SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data highlight RTC-specific T cells as targets for vaccines against endemic and emerging Coronaviridae."
https://openalex.org/W3213182660,"A closer look at centromeres Centromeres are key for anchoring chromosomes to the mitotic spindle, but they have been difficult to sequence because they can contain many repeating DNA elements. These repeats, however, carry regularly spaced, distinctive sequence markers because of sequence heterogeneity between the mostly, but not completely, identical DNA sequence repeats. Such differences aid sequence assembly. Naish et al . used ultra-long-read DNA sequencing to establish a reference assembly that resolves all five centromeres in the small mustard plant Arabidopsis . Their view into the subtly homogenized world of centromeres reveals retrotransposons that interrupt centromere organization and repressive DNA methylation that excludes centromeres from meiotic crossover repair. Thus, Arabidopsis centromeres evolve under the opposing forces of sequence homogenization and retrotransposon disruption. —PJH"

The genetic basis for resistance to these first-in-class mutant GTPase inhibitors remains under investigation. Here we evaluated matched pre-treatment and post-treatment specimens from 43 patients treated with the KRAS(G12C) inhibitor sotorasib. Multiple treatment-emergent alterations were observed across 27 patients, including alterations in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, EGFR, FGFR2, MYC and other genes. In preclinical patient-derived xenograft and cell line models, resistance to KRAS(G12C) inhibition was associated with low allele frequency hotspot mutations in KRAS(G12V or G13D), NRAS(Q61K or G13R), MRAS(Q71R) and/or BRAF(G596R), mirroring observations in patients. Single-cell sequencing in an isogenic lineage identified secondary RAS and/or BRAF mutations in the same cells as KRAS(G12C), where they bypassed inhibition without affecting target inactivation. Genetic or pharmacological targeting of ERK signalling intermediates enhanced the antiproliferative effect of G12C inhibitor treatment in models with acquired RAS or BRAF mutations. Our study thus suggests a heterogenous pattern of resistance with multiple subclonal events emerging during G12C inhibitor treatment. A subset of patients in our cohort acquired oncogenic KRAS, NRAS or BRAF mutations, and resistance in this setting may be delayed by co-targeting of ERK signalling intermediates. These findings merit broader evaluation in prospective clinical trials. Multiple treatment-emergent alterations appear in patients with advanced-stage cancer who were treated with a KRAS inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W3212956150,"The signaling of cells by scaffolds of synthetic molecules that mimic proteins is known to be effective in the regeneration of tissues. Here, we describe peptide amphiphile supramolecular polymers containing two distinct signals and test them in a mouse model of severe spinal cord injury. One signal activates the transmembrane receptor β1-integrin and a second one activates the basic fibroblast growth factor 2 receptor. By mutating the peptide sequence of the amphiphilic monomers in nonbioactive domains, we intensified the motions of molecules within scaffold fibrils. This resulted in notable differences in vascular growth, axonal regeneration, myelination, survival of motor neurons, reduced gliosis, and functional recovery. We hypothesize that the signaling of cells by ensembles of molecules could be optimized by tuning their internal motions."
https://openalex.org/W3212208195,"In eukaryotic cells, nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) fuse the inner and outer nuclear membranes and mediate nucleocytoplasmic exchange. They are made of 30 different nucleoporins and form a cylindrical architecture around an aqueous central channel. This architecture is highly dynamic in space and time. Variations in NPC diameter have been reported, but the physiological circumstances and the molecular details remain unknown. Here, we combined cryo–electron tomography with integrative structural modeling to capture a molecular movie of the respective large-scale conformational changes in cellulo. Although NPCs of exponentially growing cells adopted a dilated conformation, they reversibly constricted upon cellular energy depletion or conditions of hypertonic osmotic stress. Our data point to a model where the nuclear envelope membrane tension is linked to the conformation of the NPC."
https://openalex.org/W3212053300,"Fatty acid uptake and altered metabolism constitute hallmarks of metastasis1,2, yet evidence of the underlying biology, as well as whether all dietary fatty acids are prometastatic, is lacking. Here we show that dietary palmitic acid (PA), but not oleic acid or linoleic acid, promotes metastasis in oral carcinomas and melanoma in mice. Tumours from mice that were fed a short-term palm-oil-rich diet (PA), or tumour cells that were briefly exposed to PA in vitro, remained highly metastatic even after being serially transplanted (without further exposure to high levels of PA). This PA-induced prometastatic memory requires the fatty acid transporter CD36 and is associated with the stable deposition of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation by the methyltransferase Set1A (as part of the COMPASS complex (Set1A/COMPASS)). Bulk, single-cell and positional RNA-sequencing analyses indicate that genes with this prometastatic memory predominantly relate to a neural signature that stimulates intratumoural Schwann cells and innervation, two parameters that are strongly correlated with metastasis but are aetiologically poorly understood3,4. Mechanistically, tumour-associated Schwann cells secrete a specialized proregenerative extracellular matrix, the ablation of which inhibits metastasis initiation. Both the PA-induced memory of this proneural signature and its long-term boost in metastasis require the transcription factor EGR2 and the glial-cell-stimulating peptide galanin. In summary, we provide evidence that a dietary metabolite induces stable transcriptional and chromatin changes that lead to a long-term stimulation of metastasis, and that this is related to a proregenerative state of tumour-activated Schwann cells."
https://openalex.org/W3214085073,"Inspired by living organisms, soft robots are developed from intrinsically compliant materials, enabling continuous motions that mimic animal and vegetal movement1. In soft robots, the canonical hinges and bolts are replaced by elastomers assembled into actuators programmed to change shape following the application of stimuli, for example pneumatic inflation2-5. The morphing information is typically directly embedded within the shape of these actuators, whose assembly is facilitated by recent advances in rapid prototyping techniques6-11. Yet, these manufacturing processes have limitations in scalability, design flexibility and robustness. Here we demonstrate a new all-in-one methodology for the fabrication and the programming of soft machines. Instead of relying on the assembly of individual parts, our approach harnesses interfacial flows in elastomers that progressively cure to robustly produce monolithic pneumatic actuators whose shape can easily be tailored to suit applications ranging from artificial muscles to grippers. We rationalize the fluid mechanics at play in the assembly of our actuators and model their subsequent morphing. We leverage this quantitative knowledge to program these soft machines and produce complex functionalities, for example sequential motion obtained from a monotonic stimulus. We expect that the flexibility, robustness and predictive nature of our methodology will accelerate the proliferation of soft robotics by enabling the assembly of complex actuators, for example long, tortuous or vascular structures, thereby paving the way towards new functionalities stemming from geometric and material nonlinearities."
https://openalex.org/W3214468086,"Zero hunger and good health could be realized by 2030 through effective conservation, characterization and utilization of germplasm resources1. So far, few chickpea (Cicer arietinum) germplasm accessions have been characterized at the genome sequence level2. Here we present a detailed map of variation in 3,171 cultivated and 195 wild accessions to provide publicly available resources for chickpea genomics research and breeding. We constructed a chickpea pan-genome to describe genomic diversity across cultivated chickpea and its wild progenitor accessions. A divergence tree using genes present in around 80% of individuals in one species allowed us to estimate the divergence of Cicer over the last 21 million years. Our analysis found chromosomal segments and genes that show signatures of selection during domestication, migration and improvement. The chromosomal locations of deleterious mutations responsible for limited genetic diversity and decreased fitness were identified in elite germplasm. We identified superior haplotypes for improvement-related traits in landraces that can be introgressed into elite breeding lines through haplotype-based breeding, and found targets for purging deleterious alleles through genomics-assisted breeding and/or gene editing. Finally, we propose three crop breeding strategies based on genomic prediction to enhance crop productivity for 16 traits while avoiding the erosion of genetic diversity through optimal contribution selection (OCS)-based pre-breeding. The predicted performance for 100-seed weight, an important yield-related trait, increased by up to 23% and 12% with OCS- and haplotype-based genomic approaches, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3214069988,"Abstract Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical 1,2 . The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4 ) or Pt-containing (refs. 5–8 ) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr( vi ) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration 9 . Here, we introduce a method for preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO. This metal oxide and a support (zeolite or common metal oxide) are used as a physical mixture or in the form of two layers with ZnO as the upstream layer. Supported ZnO x species are in situ formed through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550 °C. Using different complementary characterization methods, we identify the decisive role of defective OH groups for the formation of active ZnO x species. For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnO–silicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial K–CrO x /Al 2 O 3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400 h on propane stream. The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W3213067154,"A fishy tale of long and short life span Fish have wide variations in life span even within closely related species. One such example are the rockfish species found along North Pacific coasts, which have life spans ranging from 11 to more than 200 years. Kolora et al . sequenced and performed a genomic analysis of 88 rockfish species, including long-read sequencing of the genomes of six species (see the Perspective by Lu et al .). From this analysis, the authors unmasked the genetic drivers of longevity evolution, including immunity and DNA repair–related pathways. Copy number expansion in the butyrophilin gene family was shown to be positively associated with life span, and population historical dynamics and life histories correlated differently between long- and short-lived species. These results support the idea that inflammation may modulate the aging process in these fish. —LMZ"
https://openalex.org/W3211549309,"Integrator and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) form a complex that dephosphorylates paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II), cleaves the nascent RNA, and terminates transcription. We report the structure of the pretermination complex containing the human Integrator-PP2A complex bound to paused Pol II. Integrator binds Pol II and the pausing factors DSIF and NELF to exclude binding of the elongation factors SPT6 and PAF1 complex. Integrator also binds the C-terminal domain of Pol II and positions PP2A to counteract Pol II phosphorylation and elongation. The Integrator endonuclease docks to the RNA exit site and opens to cleave nascent RNA about 20 nucleotides from the Pol II active site. Integrator does not bind the DNA clamps formed by Pol II and DSIF, enabling release of DNA and transcription termination."
https://openalex.org/W3214419550,"An anisotropic charge distribution on individual atoms, such as σ-holes, may strongly affect the material and structural properties of systems. However, the spatial resolution of such anisotropic charge distributions on an atom represents a long-standing experimental challenge. In particular, the existence of the σ-hole on halogen atoms has been demonstrated only indirectly through the determination of the crystal structures of organic molecules containing halogens or with theoretical calculations, consequently calling for its direct experimental visualization. We show that Kelvin probe force microscopy with a properly functionalized probe can image the anisotropic charge of the σ-hole and the quadrupolar charge of a carbon monoxide molecule. This opens a new way to characterize biological and chemical systems in which anisotropic atomic charges play a decisive role."

Wang et al . report a versatile palladium-catalyzed reaction to produce this motif from carboxylic acids by oxidation of the adjacent carbons, with molecular oxygen as a viable terminal oxidant (see the Perspective by Iwabuchi). The method relies on fine-tuned ligand geometry and complements approaches constrained by their reliance on enolate chemistry. Swapping in an alternate ligand promotes extension of the desaturation to coupling with terminal alkynes. —JSY"
https://openalex.org/W3212173726,"Memories are initially encoded in the hippocampus but subsequently consolidated to the cortex. Although synaptic plasticity is key to these processes, its precise spatiotemporal profile remains poorly understood. Using optogenetics to selectively erase long-term potentiation (LTP) within a defined temporal window, we found that distinct phases of synaptic plasticity play differential roles. The first wave acts locally in the hippocampus to confer context specificity. The second wave, during sleep on the same day, organizes these neurons into synchronously firing assemblies. Finally, LTP in the anterior cingulate cortex during sleep on the second day is required for further stabilization of the memory. This demonstrates the precise localization, timing, and characteristic contributions of the plasticity events that underlie the early phase of memory consolidation."
https://openalex.org/W3212361944,"Small molecules derived from symbiotic microbiota critically contribute to intestinal immune maturation and regulation1. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control immune development in the host–microbiota environment. Here, using a targeted lipidomic analysis and synthetic approach, we carried out a multifaceted investigation of immunomodulatory α-galactosylceramides from the human symbiont Bacteroides fragilis (BfaGCs). The characteristic terminal branching of BfaGCs is the result of incorporation of branched-chain amino acids taken up in the host gut by B. fragilis. A B. fragilis knockout strain that cannot metabolize branched-chain amino acids showed reduced branching in BfaGCs, and mice monocolonized with this mutant strain had impaired colonic natural killer T (NKT) cell regulation, implying structure-specific immunomodulatory activity. The sphinganine chain branching of BfaGCs is a critical determinant of NKT cell activation, which induces specific immunomodulatory gene expression signatures and effector functions. Co-crystal structure and affinity analyses of CD1d–BfaGC–NKT cell receptor complexes confirmed the interaction of BfaGCs as CD1d-restricted ligands. We present a structural and molecular-level paradigm of immunomodulatory control by interactions of endobiotic metabolites with diet, microbiota and the immune system. The symbiotic gut bacterium Bacteroides fragilis produces unique α-galactosylceramides from host dietary branched-chain amino acids, which are presented as CD1d ligands and immunomodulate natural killer T cells."
https://openalex.org/W3213228399,"Dendritic spines mediate most excitatory neurotransmission in the nervous system, so their function must be critical for the brain. Spines are biochemical compartments but might also electrically modify synaptic potentials. Using two-photon microscopy and a genetically encoded voltage indicator, we measured membrane potentials in spines and dendrites from pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex of mice during spontaneous activity and sensory stimulation. Spines and dendrites were depolarized together during action potentials, but, during subthreshold and resting potentials, spines often experienced different voltages than parent dendrites, even activating independently. Spine voltages remained compartmentalized after two-photon optogenetic activation of individual spine heads. We conclude that spines are elementary voltage compartments. The regulation of voltage compartmentalization could be important for synaptic function and plasticity, dendritic integration, and disease states."
https://openalex.org/W3211441821,"Radical substitution Nucleophilic substitution is a venerable reaction in organic chemistry. Typically, an incoming ion delivers two electrons to a carbon center while a departing ion takes two electrons away with it. The one-electron analog, homolytic substitution, is more rarely used, in part because the incoming neutral radicals can self-couple instead of bonding to the intended target. Liu et al . report that an iron porphyrin catalyst can direct homolytic substitution between primary and tertiary carbon radicals by selectively activating the primary partners. —JSY"
https://openalex.org/W3211959819,"RTN4-binding proteins were widely studied as ""NoGo"" receptors, but their physiological interactors and roles remain elusive. Similarly, BAI adhesion-GPCRs were associated with numerous activities, but their ligands and functions remain unclear. Using unbiased approaches, we observed an unexpected convergence: RTN4 receptors are high-affinity ligands for BAI adhesion-GPCRs. A single thrombospondin type 1-repeat (TSR) domain of BAIs binds to the leucine-rich repeat domain of all three RTN4-receptor isoforms with nanomolar affinity. In the 1.65 Å crystal structure of the BAI1/RTN4-receptor complex, C-mannosylation of tryptophan and O-fucosylation of threonine in the BAI TSR-domains creates a RTN4-receptor/BAI interface shaped by unusual glycoconjugates that enables high-affinity interactions. In human neurons, RTN4 receptors regulate dendritic arborization, axonal elongation, and synapse formation by differential binding to glial versus neuronal BAIs, thereby controlling neural network activity. Thus, BAI binding to RTN4/NoGo receptors represents a receptor-ligand axis that, enabled by rare post-translational modifications, controls development of synaptic circuits."
https://openalex.org/W3212563086,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and HER3 form a potent pro-oncogenic heterocomplex1-3 upon binding of growth factor neuregulin-1β (NRG1β). The mechanism by which HER2 and HER3 interact remains unknown in the absence of any structures of the complex. Here we isolated the NRG1β-bound near full-length HER2-HER3 dimer and, using cryo-electron microscopy, reconstructed the extracellulardomain module, revealing unexpected dynamics at the HER2-HER3 dimerization interface. We show that the dimerization arm of NRG1β-bound HER3 is unresolved because the apo HER2 monomer does not undergo a ligand-induced conformational change needed to establish a HER3 dimerization arm-binding pocket. In a structure of the oncogenic extracellular domain mutant HER2(S310F), we observe a compensatory interaction with the HER3 dimerization arm that stabilizes the dimerization interface. Both HER2-HER3 and HER2(S310F)-HER3 retain the capacity to bind to the HER2-directed therapeutic antibody trastuzumab, but the mutant complex does not bind to pertuzumab. Our structure of the HER2(S310F)-HER3-NRG1β-trastuzumab Fab complex reveals that the receptor dimer undergoes a conformational change to accommodate trastuzumab. Thus, similar to oncogenic mutations, therapeutic agents exploit the intrinsic dynamics of the HER2-HER3 heterodimer. The unique features of a singly liganded HER2-HER3 heterodimer underscore the allosteric sensing of ligand occupancy by the dimerization interface and explain why extracellular domains of HER2 do not homo-associate via a canonical active dimer interface."
https://openalex.org/W3214141913,"Canonical CRISPR-Cas systems provide adaptive immunity against mobile genetic elements1. However, type I-F, I-B and V-K systems have been adopted by Tn7-like transposons to direct RNA-guided transposon insertion2-7. Type V-K CRISPR-associated transposons rely on the pseudonuclease Cas12k, the transposase TnsB, the AAA+ ATPase TnsC and the zinc-finger protein TniQ7, but the molecular mechanism of RNA-directed DNA transposition has remained elusive. Here we report cryo-electron microscopic structures of a Cas12k-guide RNA-target DNA complex and a DNA-bound, polymeric TnsC filament from the CRISPR-associated transposon system of the photosynthetic cyanobacterium Scytonema hofmanni. The Cas12k complex structure reveals an intricate guide RNA architecture and critical interactions mediating RNA-guided target DNA recognition. TnsC helical filament assembly is ATP-dependent and accompanied by structural remodelling of the bound DNA duplex. In vivo transposition assays corroborate key features of the structures, and biochemical experiments show that TniQ restricts TnsC polymerization, while TnsB interacts directly with TnsC filaments to trigger their disassembly upon ATP hydrolysis. Together, these results suggest that RNA-directed target selection by Cas12k primes TnsC polymerization and DNA remodelling, generating a recruitment platform for TnsB to catalyse site-specific transposon insertion. Insights from this work will inform the development of CRISPR-associated transposons as programmable site-specific gene insertion tools."
https://openalex.org/W3211833248,"Calcium silicate perovskite, CaSiO3, is arguably the most geochemically important phase in the lower mantle, because it concentrates elements that are incompatible in the upper mantle, including the heat-generating elements thorium and uranium, which have half-lives longer than the geologic history of Earth. We report CaSiO3-perovskite as an approved mineral (IMA2020-012a) with the name davemaoite. The natural specimen of davemaoite proves the existence of compositional heterogeneity within the lower mantle. Our observations indicate that davemaoite also hosts potassium in addition to uranium and thorium in its structure. Hence, the regional and global abundances of davemaoite influence the heat budget of the deep mantle, where the mineral is thermodynamically stable."
https://openalex.org/W3213516082,"Does tool use share syntactic processes with language? Acting with a tool is thought to add a hierarchical level into the motor plan. In the linguistic domain, syntax is the cognitive function handling interdependent elements. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we detected common neurofunctional substrates in the basal ganglia subserving both tool use and syntax in language. The two abilities elicited similar patterns of neural activity, indicating the existence of shared functional resources. Manual actions and verbal working memory did not contribute to this common network. Consistent with the existence of shared neural resources, we observed bidirectional behavioral enhancement of tool use and syntactic skills in language so that training one function improves performance in the other. This reveals supramodal syntactic processes for tool use and language."
https://openalex.org/W3213226313,"Subduction is the major plate driving force, and the strength of the subducting plate controls many aspects of the thermochemical evolution of Earth. Each subducting plate experiences intense normal faulting1-9 during bending that accommodates the transition from horizontal to downwards motion at the outer rise at trenches. Here we investigate the consequences of this bending-induced plate damage using numerical subduction models in which both brittle and ductile deformation, including grain damage, are tracked and coupled self-consistently. Pervasive slab weakening and pronounced segmentation can occur at the outer-rise region owing to the strong feedback between brittle and ductile damage localization. This slab-damage phenomenon explains the subduction dichotomy of strong plates and weak slabs10, the development of large-offset normal faults6,7 near trenches, the occurrence of segmented seismic velocity anomalies11 and distinct interfaces imaged within subducted slabs12,13, and the appearance of deep, localized intraplate areas of reduced effective viscosity14 observed at trenches. Furthermore, brittle-viscously damaged slabs show a tendency for detachment at elevated mantle temperatures. Given Earth's planetary cooling history15, this implies that intermittent subduction with frequent slab break-off episodes16 may have been characteristic for Earth until more recent times than previously suggested17."
https://openalex.org/W3212160497,"Could learning that uses cognitive control to judiciously use relevant information while ignoring distractions generally improve brain function, beyond forming explicit memories? According to a neuroplasticity hypothesis for how some cognitive behavioural therapies are effective, cognitive control training (CCT) changes neural circuit information processing1-3. Here we investigated whether CCT persistently alters hippocampal neural circuit function. We show that mice learned and remembered a conditioned place avoidance during CCT that required ignoring irrelevant locations of shock. CCT facilitated learning new tasks in novel environments for several weeks, relative to unconditioned controls and control mice that avoided the same place during reduced distraction. CCT rapidly changes entorhinal cortex-to-dentate gyrus synaptic circuit function, resulting in an excitatory-inhibitory subcircuit change that persists for months. CCT increases inhibition that attenuates the dentate response to medial entorhinal cortical input, and through disinhibition, potentiates the response to strong inputs, pointing to overall signal-to-noise enhancement. These neurobiological findings support the neuroplasticity hypothesis that, as well as storing item-event associations, CCT persistently optimizes neural circuit information processing."
https://openalex.org/W3214386878,"Quantized sound waves—phonons—govern the elastic response of crystalline materials, and also play an integral part in determining their thermodynamic properties and electrical response (for example, by binding electrons into superconducting Cooper pairs)1–3. The physics of lattice phonons and elasticity is absent in simulators of quantum solids constructed of neutral atoms in periodic light potentials: unlike real solids, traditional optical lattices are silent because they are infinitely stiff4. Optical-lattice realizations of crystals therefore lack some of the central dynamical degrees of freedom that determine the low-temperature properties of real materials. Here, we create an optical lattice with phonon modes using a Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) coupled to a confocal optical resonator. Playing the role of an active quantum gas microscope, the multimode cavity QED system both images the phonons and induces the crystallization that supports phonons via short-range, photon-mediated atom–atom interactions. Dynamical susceptibility measurements reveal the phonon dispersion relation, showing that these collective excitations exhibit a sound speed dependent on the BEC–photon coupling strength. Our results pave the way for exploring the rich physics of elasticity in quantum solids, ranging from quantum melting transitions5 to exotic ‘fractonic’ topological defects6 in the quantum regime. An optical lattice for trapping a Bose–Einstein condensate reported here includes photon-mediated atom–atom interactions that replicate acoustic modes in real crystals."
https://openalex.org/W3214508224,"In mammals and flies, only one cell in a multicellular female germline cyst becomes an oocyte, but how symmetry is broken to select the oocyte is unknown. Here, we show that the microtubule (MT) minus end-stabilizing protein Patronin/CAMSAP marks the future Drosophila oocyte and is required for oocyte specification. The spectraplakin Shot recruits Patronin to the fusome, a branched structure extending into all cyst cells. Patronin stabilizes more MTs in the cell with the most fusome material. Our data suggest that this weak asymmetry is amplified by Dynein-dependent transport of Patronin-stabilized MTs. This forms a polarized MT network, along which Dynein transports oocyte determinants into the presumptive oocyte. Thus, Patronin amplifies a weak fusome anisotropy to break symmetry and select one cell to become the oocyte."
https://openalex.org/W3212123112,"Pathogens use virulence factors to inhibit the immune system1. The guard hypothesis2,3 postulates that hosts monitor (or ‘guard’) critical innate immune pathways such that their disruption by virulence factors provokes a secondary immune response1. Here we describe a ‘self-guarded’ immune pathway in human monocytes, in which guarding and guarded functions are combined in one protein. We find that this pathway is triggered by ICP0, a key virulence factor of herpes simplex virus type 1, resulting in robust induction of anti-viral type I interferon (IFN). Notably, induction of IFN by ICP0 is independent of canonical immune pathways and the IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors. A CRISPR screen identified the ICP0 target MORC34 as an essential negative regulator of IFN. Loss of MORC3 recapitulates the IRF3- and IRF7-independent IFN response induced by ICP0. Mechanistically, ICP0 degrades MORC3, which leads to de-repression of a MORC3-regulated DNA element (MRE) adjacent to the IFNB1 locus. The MRE is required in cis for IFNB1 induction by the MORC3 pathway, but is not required for canonical IFN-inducing pathways. As well as repressing the MRE to regulate IFNB1, MORC3 is also a direct restriction factor of HSV-15. Our results thus suggest a model in which the primary anti-viral function of MORC3 is self-guarded by its secondary IFN-repressing function—thus, a virus that degrades MORC3 to avoid its primary anti-viral function will unleash the secondary anti-viral IFN response. MORC3 is revealed as an essential negative regulator of the anti-viral interferon response that functions in an innate immune pathway that detects viral virulence factors."

Mental health outcomes of HCWs who worked during the COVID-19 pandemic and the SARS outbreak were assessed using Impact of Events-Revised scale (IES-R), Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).Among 3852 participants, moderate/severe scores for symptoms of post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (50.2%), anxiety (24.6%), and depression (31.5%) were observed among HCWs. Work during the 2003 SARS outbreak was reported by 1116 respondents (29.1%), who had lower scores for symptoms of PTSD (P = .002), anxiety (P < .001), and depression (P < .001) compared to those who had not worked during the SARS outbreak. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed non-clinical HCWs during this pandemic were at higher risk of anxiety (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.19-2.15, P = .01) and depressive symptoms (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.34-3.07, P < .001).

As the pandemic continues, increasing psychological and team support may decrease the mental health impacts."
https://openalex.org/W3214292143,"In most animals, the majority of the nervous system is generated and assembled into neuronal circuits during embryonic development1. However, during juvenile stages, nervous systems still undergo extensive anatomical and functional changes to eventually form a fully mature nervous system by the adult stage2,3. The molecular changes in post-mitotic neurons across post-embryonic development and the genetic programs that control these temporal transitions are not well understood4,5. Here, using the model system Caenorhabditis elegans, we comprehensively characterized the distinct functional states (locomotor behaviour) and the corresponding distinct molecular states (transcriptome) of the post-mitotic nervous system across temporal transitions during post-embryonic development. We observed pervasive, neuron-type-specific changes in gene expression, many of which are controlled by the developmental upregulation of the conserved heterochronic microRNA LIN-4 and the subsequent promotion of a mature neuronal transcriptional program through the repression of its target, the transcription factor lin-14. The functional relevance of these molecular transitions are exemplified by a temporally regulated target gene of the LIN-14 transcription factor, nlp-45, a neuropeptide-encoding gene, which we find is required for several distinct temporal transitions in exploratory activity during post-embryonic development. Our study provides insights into regulatory strategies that control neuron-type-specific gene batteries to modulate distinct behavioural states across temporal, sexual and environmental dimensions of post-embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W3213330319,"Inexpensive, simple, rapid diagnostics are necessary for efficient detection, treatment, and mitigation of COVID-19. Assays for SARS-CoV2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) offer good sensitivity and excellent specificity, but are expensive, slowed by transport to centralized testing laboratories, and often unavailable. Antigen-based assays are inexpensive and can be rapidly mass-produced and deployed at point-of-care, with lateral flow assays (LFAs) being the most common format. While various manufacturers have produced commercially available SARS-Cov2 antigen LFAs, access to validated tests remains difficult or cost prohibitive in low-and middle-income countries. Herein, we present a visually read open-access LFA (OA-LFA) using commercially-available antibodies and materials for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The LFA yielded a Limit of Detection (LOD) of 4 TCID50/swab of gamma irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus, meeting the acceptable analytical sensitivity outlined by in World Health Organization target product profile. The open-source architecture presented in this manuscript provides a template for manufacturers around the globe to rapidly design a SARS-CoV2 antigen test."
https://openalex.org/W3214716084,"Microbial coal-bed methane is an important economic resource and source of a potent greenhouse gas, but controls on its formation are poorly understood. To test whether the microbial degradability of coal limits microbial methane, we monitored methoxyl group demethylation—a reaction that feeds methanogenesis—in a global sample suite ranging in maturity from wood to bituminous coal. Carbon isotopic compositions of residual methoxyl groups were inconsistent with a thermal reaction, instead implying a substrate-limited biologic process. This suggests that deep biosphere communities participated in transforming plant matter to coal on geologic time scales and that methoxyl abundance influences coal-bed methane yield. Carbon isotopic enrichments resulting from microbial methylotrophy also explain an enigmatic offset in the carbon-13 content of microbial methane from coals and conventional hydrocarbon deposits."

https://openalex.org/W3213437817,"Abstract N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A), an internal modification in mRNA, plays a critical role in regulating gene expression. Dysregulation of m 6 A modifiers promotes oncogenesis through enzymatic functions that disrupt the balance between the deposition and removal of m 6 A modification on critical transcripts. However, the roles of mRNA m 6 A in multiple myeloma (MM) are poorly understood. The present study showed that RNA demethylase ALKBH5 was overexpressed in MM and associated with a poor prognosis in MM patients. Knocking down ALKBH5 induced apoptosis and inhibited the growth of MM cells in vitro. Xenograft models and gene set enrichment analysis with patient transcriptome datasets also supported the oncogenic role of ALKBH5 in MM. Mechanistic studies showed that ALKBH5 exerted tumorigenic effects in myeloma in an m 6 A-dependent manner, and TNF receptor-associated factor 1 (TRAF1) was a critical target of ALKBH5. Specifically, ALKBH5 regulated TRAF1 expression via decreasing m 6 A abundance in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of TRAF1 transcripts and enhancing TRAF1 mRNA stability. As a result, ALKBH5 promoted MM cell growth and survival through TRAF1-mediated activation of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. Collectively, our data demonstrated that ALKBH5 played a critical role in MM tumorigenesis and suggested that ALKBH5 could be a novel therapeutic target in MM."
https://openalex.org/W3213338788,"Juvenile hormone (JH) plays vital roles in insect reproduction, development, and in many aspects of physiology. JH primarily acts at the gene-regulatory level through interaction with an intracellular receptor (JH receptor [JHR]), a ligand-activated complex of transcription factors consisting of the JH-binding protein methoprene-tolerant (MET) and its partner taiman (TAI). Initial studies indicated significance of post-transcriptional phosphorylation, subunit assembly, and nucleocytoplasmic transport of JHR in JH signaling. However, our knowledge of JHR regulation at the protein level remains rudimentary, partly because of the difficulty of obtaining purified and functional JHR proteins. Here, we present a method for high-yield expression and purification of JHR complexes from two insect species, the beetle T. castaneum and the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Recombinant JHR subunits from each species were coexpressed in an insect cell line using a baculovirus system. MET-TAI complexes were purified through affinity chromatography and anion exchange columns to yield proteins capable of binding both the hormonal ligand (JH III) and DNA bearing cognate JH-response elements. We further examined the beetle JHR complex in greater detail. Biochemical analyses and MS confirmed that T. castaneum JHR was a 1:1 heterodimer consisting of MET and Taiman proteins, stabilized by the JHR agonist ligand methoprene. Phosphoproteomics uncovered multiple phosphorylation sites in the MET protein, some of which were induced by methoprene treatment. Finally, we report a functional bipartite nuclear localization signal, straddled by phosphorylated residues, within the disordered C-terminal region of MET. Our present characterization of the recombinant JHR is an initial step toward understanding JHR structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W3211706954,"Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a crucial regulator of cell cycle progression. It is established that the activation of PLK1 depends on the coordinated action of Aurora-A and Bora. Nevertheless, very little is known about the spatiotemporal regulation of PLK1 during G2, specifically, the mechanisms that keep cytoplasmic PLK1 inactive until shortly before mitosis onset. Here, we describe PLK1 dimerization as a new mechanism that controls PLK1 activation. During the early G2 phase, Bora supports transient PLK1 dimerization, thus fine-tuning the timely regulated activation of PLK1 and modulating its nuclear entry. At late G2, the phosphorylation of T210 by Aurora-A triggers dimer dissociation and generates active PLK1 monomers that support entry into mitosis. Interfering with this critical PLK1 dimer/monomer switch prevents the association of PLK1 with importins, limiting its nuclear shuttling, and causes nuclear PLK1 mislocalization during the G2-M transition. Our results suggest a novel conformational space for the design of a new generation of PLK1 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W3212606285,"The aim of this cohort study was to evaluate the development and progression of presbyopia and the status of dry eye-related symptoms from 2017 to 2020, to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.Near add power at 30 cm was measured in 339 participants aged between 40 and 55 from 2017 to 2021 at Japanese eye clinics. Regression analysis of near add power and age was analyzed to compare 2017 with later years up to the pandemic. The prevalence of dry eye-related signs and six common symptoms were compared.The number and mean age (y) of participants were 183 (48.6±4.1) in 2017, 46 (51.3±7.5) in 2019, and 110 (49.2±3.7) in 2020-21, respectively. The mean progression rate of near add power (D/y) was 0.13 for 2017, 0.09 for 2019 (P = 0.028, vs 2017), and 0.08 for 2020-21 (P<0.001, vs 2017). The slope (rate of presbyopia progression) became flatter from 2017 to 2021 and the estimated near add power at the age of 40 increased from 2017 to 2020-2021, implicating presbyopia developed earlier and worsened during the study period. The 2017 values were comparable with previous studies described in 1922 and 2019. The standardized correlation coefficient between age and near add power was 0.816 for 2017, 0.671 for 2019 (P = 0.084, vs 2017), and 0.572 for 2020-21 (P<0.001, vs 2017). Multiple regression analysis revealed age and COVID-19 pandemic were significantly correlated with near add power. The prevalence of dryness irritation, and pain was greater in 2020-21 than in 2017 with no difference in the prevalence of eye fatigue, blurring, and photophobia. There was no difference in the prevalence of short tear break-up time and positive corneal staining among 2017, 2019 and 2020-21.Estimated presbyopia developed earlier and progressed slower from 2017 to 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic. Stress and rapid digitalization related to strict infection control and quarantine might be contributing factors."
https://openalex.org/W3212165398,"Many animals probably hold mental representations about the whereabouts of others; this is a form of socio-spatial cognition. We tested whether cats mentally map the spatial position of their owner or a familiar cat to the source of the owner's or familiar cat's vocalization. In Experiment 1, we placed one speaker outside a familiar room (speaker 1) and another (speaker 2) inside the room, as far as possible from speaker 1, then we left the subject alone in the room. In the habituation phase, the cat heard its owner's voice calling its name five times from speaker 1. In the test phase, shortly after the 5th habituation phase vocalization, one of the two speakers played either the owner's voice or a stranger's voice calling the cat's name once. There were four test combinations of speaker location and sound: SamesoundSamelocation, SamesoundDifflocation, DiffsoundSamelocation, DiffsoundDifflocation. In line with our prediction, cats showed most surprise in the SamesoundDifflocation condition, where the owner suddenly seemed to be in a new place. This reaction disappeared when we used cat vocalizations (Experiment 2) or non-vocal sounds (Experiment 3) as the auditory stimuli. Our results suggest that cats have mental representations about their out-of-sight owner linked to hearing the owner's voice, indicating a previously unidentified socio-spatial cognitive ability."
https://openalex.org/W3213084924,"During aging of human skin, a number of intrinsic and extrinsic factors cause the alteration of the skin's structure, function and cutaneous physiology. Many studies have investigated the influence of the skin microbiome on these alterations, but the molecular mechanisms that dictate the interplay between these factors and the skin microbiome are still not fully understood. To obtain more insight into the connection between the skin microbiome and the human physiological processes involved in skin aging, we performed a systematic study on interconnected pathways of human and bacterial metabolic processes that are known to play a role in skin aging. The bacterial genes in these pathways were subsequently used to create Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which were applied to screen for presence of defined functionalities in both genomic and metagenomic datasets of skin-associated bacteria. These models were further applied on 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from skin microbiota samples derived from female volunteers of two different age groups (25-28 years ('young') and 59-68 years ('old')). The results show that the main bacterial pathways associated with aging skin are those involved in the production of pigmentation intermediates, fatty acids and ceramides. This study furthermore provides evidence for a relation between skin aging and bacterial enzymes involved in protein glycation. Taken together, the results and insights described in this paper provide new leads for intervening with bacterial processes that are associated with aging of human skin."

https://openalex.org/W3213086011,"Decomposition is an essential ecosystem service driven by interacting biotic and abiotic factors. Increasing temperatures due to climate change can affect soil moisture, soil fauna, and subsequently, decomposition. Understanding how projected climate change scenarios will affect decomposition is of vital importance for predicting nutrient cycling and ecosystem health. In this study, we experimentally addressed the question of how the early stages of decomposition would vary along a gradient of projected climate change scenarios. Given the importance of biodiversity for ecosystem service provisioning, we measured the effect of invertebrate exclusion on red maple (Acer rubrum) leaf litter breakdown along a temperature gradient using litterbags in warming chambers over a period of five weeks. Leaf litter decomposed more slowly in the warmer chambers and in the litterbag treatment that minimized invertebrate access. Moreover, increasing air temperature reduced invertebrate abundance and richness, and altered the community composition, independent of exclusion treatment. Using structural equation models, we were able to disentangle the effects of average air temperature on leaf litter loss, finding a direct negative effect of warming on the early stages of decomposition, independent of invertebrate abundance. This result indicates that not only can climate change affect the invertebrate community, but may also directly influence how the remaining organisms interact with their environment and their effectiveness at provisioning ecosystem services. Overall, our study highlights the role of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem services and contributes to our understanding of how climate change could disrupt nutrient cycling."
https://openalex.org/W3213598195,"The α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) is an abundant blood plasma protein with important immunomodulatory functions coupled to endogenous and exogenous ligand-binding properties. Its affinity for many drug-like structures, however, means AGP can have a significant effect on the pharmokinetics and pharmacodynamics of numerous small molecule therapeutics. Staurosporine, and its hydroxylated forms UCN-01 and UCN-02, are kinase inhibitors that have been investigated at length as antitumour compounds. Despite their potency, these compounds display poor pharmokinetics due to binding to both AGP variants, AGP1 and AGP2. The recent renewed interest in UCN-01 as a cytostatic protective agent prompted us to solve the structure of the AGP2-UCN-01 complex by X-ray crystallography, revealing for the first time the precise binding mode of UCN-01. The solution NMR suggests AGP2 undergoes a significant conformational change upon ligand binding, but also that it uses a common set of sidechains with which it captures key groups of UCN-01 and other small molecule ligands. We anticipate that this structure and the supporting NMR data will facilitate rational redesign of small molecules that could evade AGP and therefore improve tissue distribution."
https://openalex.org/W3211960443,"Meniscus tears of the knee are among the most common orthopedic knee injury. Specifically, tears of the posterior root can result in abnormal meniscal extrusion leading to decreased function and progressive osteoarthritis. Despite contemporary surgical treatments of posterior meniscus root tears, there is a low rate of healing and an incidence of residual meniscus extrusion approaching 30%, illustrating an inability to recapitulate native meniscus function. Here, we characterized the differential functional behavior of the medial and lateral meniscus during axial compression load and dynamic knee motion using a cadaveric model. We hypothesized essential differences in extrusion between the medial and lateral meniscus in response to axial compression and knee range of motion. We found no differences in the amount of meniscus extrusion between the medial and lateral meniscus with a competent posterior root (0.338mm vs. 0.235mm; p-value = 0.181). However, posterior root detachment resulted in a consistently increased meniscus extrusion for the medial meniscus compared to the lateral meniscus (2.233mm vs. 0.4705mm; p-value < 0.0001). Moreover, detachment of the posterior root of the medial meniscus resulted in an increase in extrusion at all angles of knee flexion and was most pronounced (4.00mm ± 1.26mm) at 30-degrees of knee flexion. In contrast, the maximum mean extrusion of the lateral meniscus was 1.65mm ± 0.97mm, occurring in full extension. Furthermore, only the medial meniscus extruded during dynamic knee flexion after posterior root detachment. Given the differential functional behaviors between the medial and lateral meniscus, these findings suggest that posterior root repair requires reducing overall meniscus extrusion and recapitulating the native functional responses specific to each meniscus."

https://openalex.org/W3213450972,"Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), a pro-fibrotic tumour-derived factor promotes fibroblast differentiation in the tumour microenvironment and is thought to contribute to the development of pro-tumourigenic cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) by promoting myofibroblast differentiation. miRNA dysregulation has been demonstrated in myofibroblast transdifferentiation and CAF activation, however, their expression varies among cell types and with the method of fibroblast induction. Here, the expression profile of miRNA in human primary oral fibroblasts treated with TGF-β1, to derive a myofibroblastic, CAF-like phenotype, was determined compared to untreated fibroblasts. Myofibroblast transdifferentiation was determined by the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and fibronectin-1 extra domain A (FN-EDA1) using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot. The formation of stress fibres was assessed by fluorescence microscopy, and associated changes in contractility were assessed using collagen contraction assays. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were purified by using size exclusion chromatography and ultracentrifugation and their size and concentration were determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis. miRNA expression profiling in oral fibroblasts treated with TGF-β1 and their extracellular vesicles was carried out using tiling low-density array cards. The Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was used to perform functional and pathway enrichment analysis of target genes. In this study, TGF-β1 induced a myofibroblastic phenotype in normal oral fibroblasts as assessed by expression of molecular markers, the formation of stress fibres and increased contractility. TaqMan Low-Density Array (TLDA) analysis demonstrated that miR-503 and miR-708 were significantly upregulated, while miR-1276 was significantly downregulated in TGF-β1-treated oral fibroblasts (henceforth termed experimentally-derived CAF, eCAF). The gene functional enrichment analysis showed that the candidate miRNAs have the potential to modulate various pathways; including the Ras associated protein 1 (Rap1), PI3K-Akt, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) signalling pathways. In addition, altered levels of several miRNAs were detected in eCAF EV, including miR-142 and miR-222. No differences in size or abundance of EV were detected between eCAF and normal oral fibroblast (NOF). Little overlap was observed between changes in cellular and EV miRNA profiles, suggesting the possibility of selective loading of EV miRNA. The study reveals miRNA expression signature could be involved in myofibroblast transdifferentiation and the miRNA cargo of their EV, providing novel insight into the involvement of miRNA in CAF development and function."
https://openalex.org/W4225620738,"Mepyramine, a first-generation antihistamine targeting the histamine H(1) receptor, was extensively prescribed to patients suffering from allergic reactions and urticaria. Serious adverse effects, especially in case of overdose, were frequently reported, including drowsiness, impaired thinking, convulsion, and coma. Many of these side effects were associated with the blockade of histaminergic or cholinergic receptors. Here we show that mepyramine directly inhibits a variety of voltage-gated sodium channels, including the Tetrodotoxin-sensitive isoforms and the main isoforms (Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9) of nociceptors. Estimated IC50 were within the range of drug concentrations detected in poisoned patients. Mepyramine inhibited sodium channels through fast- or slow-inactivated state preference depending on the isoform. Moreover, mepyramine inhibited the firing responses of C- and Aβ-type nerve fibers in ex vivo skin-nerve preparations. Locally applied mepyramine had analgesic effects on the scorpion toxin-induced excruciating pain and produced pain relief in acute, inflammatory, and chronic pain models. Collectively, these data provide evidence that mepyramine has the potential to be developed as a topical analgesic agent."
https://openalex.org/W4226258711,"Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the vascular access of choice for renal replacement therapy. However, AVF is susceptible to calcification with a high prevalence of 40%-65% in chronic hemodialysis patients. Repeated needle puncture for hemodialysis cannulation results in intimal denudation of AVF. We hypothesized that exposure to blood shear stress in the medial layer promotes venous smooth muscle cell (SMC) osteogenesis. While previous studies of shear stress focused on arterial-type SMCs, SMCs isolated from the vein had not been investigated. This study established a venous cell model of AVF using the fluid shear device, combined with a high phosphate medium to mimic the uremic milieu. Osteogenic gene expression of venous SMCs upon mechanical and chemical cues was analyzed in addition to the activated cell signaling pathways. Our findings indicated that upon shear stress and high phosphate environment, mechanical stimulation (shear stress) had an additive effect in up-regulation of an early osteogenic marker, Runx2. We further identified that the integrin β1-ERK1/2 signaling pathway was responsible for the molecular basis of venous SMC osteogenesis upon shear stress exposure. Mitochondrial biogenesis also took part in the early stage of this venopathy pathogenesis, evident by the up-regulated mitochondrial transcription factor A and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ in venous SMCs. In conclusion, synergistic effects of fluid shear stress and high phosphate induce venous SMC osteogenesis via the ERK1/2 pathway through activating the mechanosensing integrin β1 signaling. The present study identified a promising druggable target for reducing AVF calcification, which deserves further in vivo investigations."
https://openalex.org/W3212871869,"This study examined whether the presence of product information focused on a past era (e.g., year of establishment) improved consumers' evaluations of a shop serving traditional products when the label and shop were congruent in terms of temporal focus. Across five experiments, participants viewed and evaluated advertisements from traditional food restaurants and shops that showed an old year of establishment. They showed favorable evaluations of the restaurants and food shops more frequently when a label focused on the past was displayed than when the label was absent or when a label focused on the present was displayed. Subsequent experiments indicated that this labeling effect was strongest when the label and shop were consistent in terms of traditional culture such that the year of establishment on the label showed the Japanese era name (Japan's traditional date format) and was accompanied by Japanese classic foods. Importantly, in this study, qualitative domains were consistently improved more often than were ratings of visit intention and expected taste. The results suggest that temporal congruence between the label and restaurants rated plays an essential role in ensuring that these advertisements are effective in improving positive evaluations."
