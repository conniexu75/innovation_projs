https://openalex.org/W1965523406,"The moving polygonal patterns in dense cultures of Tetrahymena and other ciliates and flagellates look like ""Benard cells,"" but are not due to thermal convection. They seem to be due to a similar dynamic instability that occurs when the energy input is internal and mechanical. The high concentration in the patterns may be useful in fertilization."
https://openalex.org/W2097459779,"A female rat, by operating a lever, causes the presentation of a potent male rat and subsequent sexual contact. The female shows contact-response latencies that vary according to the nature of the contact. Latencies after ejaculations are longer than those after intromissions, which in turn exceed those after mounts."
https://openalex.org/W2009084537,"Silicate minerals rapidly release silica to sea water. Fine-grained, 1-gram samples were placed in 200 milliliters of sea water, and the silica content of the water was measured intermittently for 6 months. At the end of 10 days and of 6 months the silica concentrations with various minerals, in parts per million, were, respectively: kaolinite, 0.6, 2.2; chlorite, 2.5, 2.4; illite, 1.8, 2.6; muscovite, 1.8, 3.9; montmorillonite A, 7, 10.5; montmorillonite B, 10, 21. Except for ion exchange phenomena, it generally has been assumed that these minerals do not react significantly with sea water, or, if they do, they react at geologically slow rates. The rates observed indicate that the ocean must be looked upon as a chemical system with a rapid response to added detrital silicates."
https://openalex.org/W2034842118,"The technique of supersonic free jet spectroscopy can be used to study the structure and dynamics of molecules which have been cooled to far below their boiling points but which remain in the gas phase. Cooling of the internal degrees of freedom, the molecular rotations and vibrations, produces a highly resolved and greatly simplified molecular spectrum. The principles of the technique are discussed and its utility is demonstrated by two examples: the spectroscopy of porphyrins in the gas phase and the photochemistry of van der Waals molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2035512719,"Marine net zooplankton release dissolved amino acids into the water. Release rates are positively correlated with temperature and can be estimated by the equation: Release rate, (milligrams of alpha-amino nitrogen per gram dry weight of zooplankton per day) = 1.0 x temperature ( degrees C) -5.9. Release rates appeared to be independent of the taxonomic composition of the test samples, which were variously dominated by copepods, salps, chaetognaths, coelenterates, or radiolarians. These amino acids constitute an important source of dissolved organic matter in the sea."

Enteropneusts are among the forms responsible for such tracks although, despite earlier evidence, they are rarely considered to be either active or abyssal."
https://openalex.org/W1990470176,Progress in understanding the many scientifically interesting and technologically important processes that occur at surfaces has been slowed by the absence of basic structural information. A variety of new techniques are being developed to attack this central problem in surface science. With the new surface probes it is now possible to quantitatively determine the arrangement of atoms in the first monolayers of a solid. This provides the basis for exciting advances in surface science.

https://openalex.org/W1984638397,"The intensity variations in radio source 3C 273B have been measured at wavelengths of 31.3, 21.2, and 10.6 centimeters. At 31.3 centimeters the variation is quite small, indicating that the variable component of the source is optically thick at this wavelength. Study of several dijfferent model sources shows that the observed dependence of the intensity variations on frequency can best be explained by an increase of the electron density in a source region about 2 parsecs in diameter. This interpretation is consistent with the distance to 3C 273 determined from Hubble's law and the observed red shift."

https://openalex.org/W1616254467,"Proposals are reviewed for the application of nuclear explosions in basic scientific research. Nuclear explosions are of interest as intense sources of neutrons, neutrinos, plasmas, high temperatures, gamma rays, x rays, light, shock, and radioactive isotopes. Experiments which use one or more of these properties are reviewed. (C.H.)"
