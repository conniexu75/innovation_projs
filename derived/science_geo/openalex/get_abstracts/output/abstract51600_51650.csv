https://openalex.org/W1498470436,"A low molecular weight β2-globulin (β2-microglobulin) has been purified from urine of patients with tubular proteinurias. The isolation procedure includes ultrafiltration, zone electrophoresis, gel chromatography, and ion exchange chromatography. The yield of purified protein was 11 to 13% of a total amount of 2.8 to 89 mg of β2-microglobulin per 24-hour urine volume. The β2-microglobulin occurs in small quantities in normal human urine, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid. The purified protein appeared homogeneous in Ouchterlony immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, starch gel electrophoresis, and ultracentrifugation. The molecular weight found from equilibrium ultracentrifugation was 11,600. Amino acid analyses indicated the presence of 100 residues, giving a calculated molecular weight of 11,815. The protein appears to consist of a single polypeptide chain with 2 half-cystine residues involved in a disulfide bond. Isoleucine was identified as the NH2-terminal residue. The β2-microglobulin is devoid of carbohydrate."

They act synergistically to inhibit the reaction, but must be present when antigen is added; preincubation is not effective. Since both increase cellular levels of cyclic 3 ', 5'-adenosine monophosphate it is postulated that this compound plays a role in the regulation of allergic histamine release."
https://openalex.org/W2074308372,"In a study of the specificity of neuronal connections in lobster abdominal ganglia, the dye Procion Yellow M4RS was electrophoretically injected into identified cell bodies. This dye spreads into fine branches of cells, survives fixation and routine histological procedures, and permits the reconstruction of cell shapes through examination of serial sections of ganglia. Certain cells were found to have an internal bilateral symmetry. Repeated injection of the same cells in ganglia from different animals showed that cells have characteristic shapes and that the neuropil is highly structured. This method of dye injection should have general applicability in studies where a knowledge of the geometry of specific cells is important."

The smaller fragment, with a molecular weight of about 15,000, possesses chemotactic activity for rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes, as well as anaphylatoxic activity for guinea pig ileum."

https://openalex.org/W2055340854,Certain antiserums prepared against isolated cold agglutinins demonstrate specificity for gamma M globulins with this activity and not for similar gamma M globulins lacking such activity. The cold agglutinin specific antigens fall into several major and minor groups. Their exact relation to the presumed antibody-combining sites remains to be determined.

https://openalex.org/W2017827769,"Three of 64 IgA immunoglobuilins, derived from plasma cell tumors induced by mineral oil in BALB/c mice, precipitated with species-specific pneumococcus C polysaccharide. A related antigen was also found in group O and some group H streptococci. A difference in ability to precipitate a C polysaccharide from a pneumococcus type XIV was demonstrated between protein 603 which did precipitate and protein 167 which did not precipitate this polysaccharide. Studies of the 167 and 603 proteins showed differences in electrophoretic mobility and polypeptide chains. The antigen-combining site of the 167 and 603 proteins resided on the papain-digestion Fab fragment."

Each lateral giant interneuron comprises a giant axon, an ipsilateral dendritic arborization of fairly constant form, and a contralateral soma. Antidromic axon spikes produce only, small, electronic potentials in the soma; direct depolarization there fails to produce electrically excitable membrane responses and cannot discharge the main axon."

https://openalex.org/W1552768178,"The role of vitamin K in the synthesis of prothrombin has been examined with the following results. 1. Vitamin K deficiency has no effect on general protein synthesis as studied by amino acid incorporation into protein in vivo and in vitro and by tryptophan pyrrolase production following tryptophan feeding. 2. Prothrombin activity was found in normal rat liver microsomes with increased release following ultrasonic treatment, but could not be found in microsomes from the livers of vitamin K-deficient rats or dicumarol-treated rats. Administration of suboptimal levels of vitamin K to vitamin K-deficient rats resulted in detectable microsomal prothrombin in 2 hours and essentially normal values within 3 hours. 3. Adequate vitamin K1, given by injection, completely restored the blood prothrombin levels of vitamin K-deficient rats in 1 hour, and of dicumarol- or warfarin-treated rats in 5 to 7 hours depending on the amounts of warfarin and vitamin K1 given. 4. Following administration of actinomycin D or ethionine to vitamin K-deficient rats, treatment with vitamin K1 markedly stimulated prothrombin production, indicating that the site of action of vitamin K is beyond the level of transcription of DNA to prothrombin messenger RNA. 5. Treatment with vitamin K1, following administration to vitamin K-deficient rats of cycloheximide at a level just sufficient to block synthesis of prothrombin for 6 to 8 hours, gave an essentially normal prothrombin response. At higher cycloheximide levels the response to vitamin K1, while much less complete, was clear and definite. 6. The response of vitamin K-deficient rats to vitamin K1, administered following treatment with blocking doses of puromycin, appears significant. 7. These data appear to indicate that the site of function of vitamin K is not at the genetic level, as has been reported, but at a late stage in translation of prothrombin messenger RNA to form a functional prothrombin molecule."

https://openalex.org/W2059094079,"The antibody response of young rabbits to the injection of killed Brucella abortus was abolished by prior extirpation of intestinal lymphoepithelial tissues combined with lethal x-irradiation and reconstitution with rabbit fetal liver cells. Extirpative surgery alone, like lethal x-irradiation and reconstitution without surgery, did not abolish this response. Intestinal lymphoepithelial tissues of rabbits apparently play a central lymphoid function and are responsible for the differentiation of the lymphoid cell line which produces specific antibody and immunoglobulins."

https://openalex.org/W1555416053,"Abstract A method is described in which macromolecule-macromolecule interactions are assessed in closed tubes with the use of molecular sieving (gel filtration). By incorporating appropriate markers into the system, distribution volumes can be precisely determined without the need for close control of total gel volume. The binding of an antibody fragment (Fabµ, mol wt 50,000) to its antigen (γG, mol wt 150,000) has been successfully studied."
https://openalex.org/W1998566259,"On average 36 percent of the benzo[a]pyrene in an automobile's exhaust gas comes from the benzo[a]pyrene originally in the gasoline. Between 0.1 and 0.2 percent of the benzo[a]pyrene in the gasoline survives the combustion process and is recovered from the exhaust; 5 percent accumulates in the crankcase oil. Some of the benzo[a]pyrene in the gasoline is converted into other polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons and other more polar compounds. For our experiments we used commercial gasoline containing benzo[a]pyrene at 1.0 part per million to which was added benzo[a]pyrene-8,9-(14)C at 1.1 parts per million as a radioactive tracer."

https://openalex.org/W1575452163,"The peptides from tryptic hydrolysates of the S-carboxymethyl-Fc fragment of nonspecific rabbit immunoglobulin G have been purified chromatographically. Although the peptides were obtained in yields which varied from 10 to 66%, the sum of the amino acid compositions of a unique set of peptides accounted closely for the amino acid composition of the S-carboxymethyl-Fc fragment. Some peptides, which possessed similar but not identical amino acid compositions, appear to be associated with the amino-terminal region of the Fc fragment."

https://openalex.org/W1563688653,"Reaction of S-carboxymethyl-Fc fragment from rabbit immunoglobulin G with cyanogen bromide cleaves the fragment into five unique peptides, each of which has been isolated by chromatographic methods. The amino acid composition of the five peptides accounts closely for the amino acid composition of the Fc fragment. On the basis of the amino acid composition of the tryptic peptides derived from each of the five peptides and the composition of the four unique methionine-containing peptides from Fc fragment, it is possible to obtain a partial sequence of the Fc fragment. These results suggest that this may be a major sequence for the rabbit Fc fragment."

https://openalex.org/W1984758540,"SINCE Nowell's original description of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-induced lymphocyte transformation1, there has been considerable controversy as to whether responses to this substance involve immunoglobulin and specific antibody synthesis. Several workers2–5, using a variety of techniques, claim to have demonstrated immunoglobulin synthesis by PHA-stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures, but others have been unable to confirm these findings6–9. Recent studies with the pokeweed mitogen (PWM) suggest that responses to this stimulant differ morphologically from those to PHA (ref. 10) and that a sub-population of cells responding to PWM may synthesize immunoglobulin9,11."

https://openalex.org/W2086916059,"ALTHOUGH serum proteins are almost universally used to stimulate the growth of mammalian cells in axenic culture, the nature of the active entity is unknown. Previous work from this laboratory1 has shown that lipids extracted from serum with ether are toxic to cultured cells. It therefore seemed reasonable that the removal of toxic materials would produce serum of greater growth stimulatory activity. This was found not to be so; the resulting serum was either toxic or inert to cultured cells. The reason for this may have been that ether extraction was too vigorous a treatment for the retention of growth stimulatory activity by serum proteins. A milder method would be the use of charcoal which was shown by Chen2 to remove fatty acids from serum albumin."
