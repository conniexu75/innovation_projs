https://openalex.org/W4223474278,"Polygenic risk scores suffer reduced accuracy in non-European populations, exacerbating health disparities. We propose PolyPred, a method that improves cross-population polygenic risk scores by combining two predictors: a new predictor that leverages functionally informed fine-mapping to estimate causal effects (instead of tagging effects), addressing linkage disequilibrium differences, and BOLT-LMM, a published predictor. When a large training sample is available in the non-European target population, we propose PolyPred+, which further incorporates the non-European training data. We applied PolyPred to 49 diseases/traits in four UK Biobank populations using UK Biobank British training data, and observed relative improvements versus BOLT-LMM ranging from +7% in south Asians to +32% in Africans, consistent with simulations. We applied PolyPred+ to 23 diseases/traits in UK Biobank east Asians using both UK Biobank British and Biobank Japan training data, and observed improvements of +24% versus BOLT-LMM and +12% versus PolyPred. Summary statistics-based analogs of PolyPred and PolyPred+ attained similar improvements."

This study aimed to determine the acceptance and hesitancy of the COVID-19 vaccine and associated factors among medical students in Sudan.A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire designed on Google Form and sent to randomly-selected medical students via their Telegram accounts from 30th June to 11th July 2021. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test and logistic regression were used to assess the association between vaccine acceptance and demographic as well as non-demographic factors.Out of the 281 students who received the questionnaire, 220 (78%) responded, of whom 217 consented and completed the form. Males accounted for 46. 1%. Vaccine acceptance was 55. 8% (n = 121), and vaccine hesitancy was 44. 2% (n = 96). The commonly cited reasons for accepting the vaccine were to protect themselves and others from getting COVID-19. Concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness were the main reasons reported by those who were hesitant. Factors associated with vaccine acceptance were history of COVID-19 infection (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2. 2, 95% CI 1. 0-4.7, p = 0. 040), belief that vaccines are generally safe (aOR = 2.3, 95% CI 1. 2-4.5, p = 0.020), confidence that the vaccine can end the pandemic (aOR = 7.5, 95% CI 2. 5-22. 0, p<0.001), and receiving any vaccine in the past 5 years (aOR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.4, p = 0.031). No demographic association was found with the acceptance of the vaccine.This study has revealed a high level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among medical students. Efforts to provide accurate information on COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness are highly recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4226333460,"The human brain forms functional networks of correlated activity, which have been linked with both cognitive and clinical outcomes. However, the genetic variants affecting brain function are largely unknown. Here, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance images from 47,276 individuals to discover and validate common genetic variants influencing intrinsic brain activity. We identified 45 new genetic regions associated with brain functional signatures (P < 2.8 × 10-11), including associations to the central executive, default mode, and salience networks involved in the triple-network model of psychopathology. A number of brain activity-associated loci colocalized with brain disorders (e.g., the APOE ε4 locus with Alzheimer's disease). Variation in brain function was genetically correlated with brain disorders, such as major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. Together, our study provides a step forward in understanding the genetic architecture of brain functional networks and their genetic links to brain-related complex traits and disorders."

https://openalex.org/W4224316023,"DNA damage shuts down genome-wide transcription to prevent transcriptional mutagenesis and to initiate repair signalling, but the mechanism to stall elongating RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is not fully understood. Central to the DNA damage response, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) initiates DNA repair by translocating to the lesions where it catalyses protein poly(ADP-ribosylation). Here we report that PARP1 inhibits Pol II elongation by inactivating the transcription elongation factor P-TEFb, a CDK9–cyclin T1 (CycT1) heterodimer. After sensing damage, the activated PARP1 binds to transcriptionally engaged P-TEFb and modifies CycT1 at multiple positions, including histidine residues that are rarely used as an acceptor site. This prevents CycT1 from undergoing liquid–liquid phase separation that is required for CDK9 to hyperphosphorylate Pol II and to stimulate elongation. Functionally, poly(ADP-ribosylation) of CycT1 promotes DNA repair and cell survival. Thus, the P-TEFb–PARP1 signalling plays a protective role in transcription quality control and genomic stability maintenance after DNA damage. Fu, et al. report that PARP1-dependent poly(ADP-ribsoyl)ation of the P-TEFb subunit CycT1 suppresses its phase separation, which prevents its interaction partner CDK9 from hyperphosphorylating RNA polymerase II and thereby blocks transcription."
https://openalex.org/W4223540770,"Facial morphology-a conspicuous feature of human appearance-is highly heritable. Previous studies on the genetic basis of facial morphology were performed mainly in European-ancestry cohorts (EUR). Applying a data-driven phenotyping and multivariate genome-wide scanning protocol to a large collection of three-dimensional facial images of individuals with East Asian ancestry (EAS), we identified 244 variants in 166 loci (62 new) associated with typical-range facial variation. A newly proposed polygenic shape analysis indicates that the effects of the variants on facial shape in EAS can be generalized to EUR. Based on this, we further identified 13 variants related to differences between facial shape in EUR and EAS populations. Evolutionary analyses suggest that the difference in nose shape between EUR and EAS populations is caused by a directional selection, due mainly to a local adaptation in Europeans. Our results illustrate the underlying genetic basis for facial differences across populations."
https://openalex.org/W4225539084,"Flexible decision-making requires animals to forego immediate rewards (exploitation) and try novel choice options (exploration) to discover if they are preferable to familiar alternatives. Using the same task and a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model to quantify the value of choices, we first determined that the computational basis for managing explore-exploit tradeoffs is conserved across monkeys and humans. We then used fMRI to identify where in the human brain the immediate value of exploitative choices and relative uncertainty about the value of exploratory choices were encoded. Consistent with prior neurophysiological evidence in monkeys, we observed divergent encoding of reward value and uncertainty in prefrontal and parietal regions, including frontopolar cortex, and parallel encoding of these computations in motivational regions including the amygdala, ventral striatum, and orbitofrontal cortex. These results clarify the interplay between prefrontal and motivational circuits that supports adaptive explore-exploit decisions in humans and nonhuman primates."
https://openalex.org/W4225662058,"Acid mine drainage (AMD) is one of the biggest environmental challenges associated with in the mining process. Most of the current research on AMD focuses on developed deposits, whereas there is almost no research on naturally-produced AMD from undeveloped deposits. In this study, river water and AMD were collected to analyze the distribution characteristics of heavy metals and the phytoplankton community. In addition, the environmental risks of heavy metals were evaluated by single-factor pollution index, Nemerow pollution index and health risk assessment model. The results show that the pH of the Rongna River water ranged from 6.52 to 8.46, and the average concentrations of Mn and Ni were 867.37 and 28.44 μg/L, respectively, which exceed the corresponding Grade III Environmental Quality Standard of Surface Water. The results of the environmental health risk assessment show that the river section of the Rongna River was seriously polluted by the heavy metal Mn after AMD confluence, and the health risk assessment indicates that oral ingestion of Mn posed a potential non-carcinogenic risk to children and adults. A total of 35 phytoplankton species were found in the Rongna River. The phytoplankton biomass was negatively correlated with the concentration of major heavy metals, indicating that the heavy metal concentration exceeded the tolerance limit of phytoplankton, thereby affecting their normal growth. Finally, statistical analysis shows that Cu, Zn, Ni, Mn and Cd in the Rongna River were mainly derived from AMD."
https://openalex.org/W4226282530,"Many unannotated microproteins and alternative proteins (alt-proteins) are coencoded with canonical proteins, but few of their functions are known. Motivated by the hypothesis that alt-proteins undergoing regulated synthesis could play important cellular roles, we developed a chemoproteomic pipeline to identify nascent alt-proteins in human cells. We identified 22 actively translated alt-proteins or N-terminal extensions, one of which is post-transcriptionally upregulated by DNA damage stress. We further defined a nucleolar, cell-cycle-regulated alt-protein that negatively regulates assembly of the pre-60S ribosomal subunit (MINAS-60). Depletion of MINAS-60 increases the amount of cytoplasmic 60S ribosomal subunit, upregulating global protein synthesis and cell proliferation. Mechanistically, MINAS-60 represses the rate of late-stage pre-60S assembly and export to the cytoplasm. Together, these results implicate MINAS-60 as a potential checkpoint inhibitor of pre-60S assembly and demonstrate that chemoproteomics enables hypothesis generation for uncharacterized alt-proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4226040552,"Public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines are critical in reaching protective levels of herd immunity. Vaccine skepticism has always been relatively high in Germany, and surveys suggest that over the course of the pandemic, enthusiasm for the COVID-19 vaccine has dropped. Looking at the period just prior to the approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines in Germany in the latter half of 2020, this paper aims to assess the reasons for and against COVID-19 vaccine uptake among residents of Germany, and to provide in-depth qualitative data to better understand and address concerns surrounding the safety and efficacy of a COVID-19 vaccine. Our findings indicate that there is widespread trust in German institutions and health experts to provide a safe vaccine for those who need it most. However, interviewees also point to the need for more information and the centrality of support from trusted medical authorities in making individual vaccination decisions. We also present the complexity of individual positions on vaccination, and suggest that vaccine hesitancy in relation to COVID-19 needs to be understood as a nuanced, and socially malleable, territory. This indicates that the goal of a vaccination campaign is not only achieving 'herd immunity,' but also a social endorsement of the collaborative effort that is required for a vaccine to be successful."
https://openalex.org/W4226213097,"Abstract Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and fatal primary brain tumour in adults. Considering that resistance to current therapies leads to limited response in patients, new therapeutic options are urgently needed. In recent years, differentiation therapy has been proposed as an alternative for GBM treatment, with the aim of bringing cancer cells into a post-mitotic/differentiated state, ultimately limiting tumour growth. As an integral component of cancer development and regulation of differentiation processes, kinases are potential targets of differentiation therapies. The present study describes how the screening of a panel of kinase inhibitors (KIs) identified PDGF-Rα/β inhibitor CP-673451 as a potential differentiation agent in GBM. We show that targeting PDGF-Rα/β with CP-673451 in vitro triggers outgrowth of neurite-like processes in GBM cell lines and GBM stem cells (GSCs), suggesting differentiation into neural-like cells, while reducing proliferation and invasion in 3D hyaluronic acid hydrogels. In addition, we report that treatment with CP-673451 improves the anti-tumour effects of temozolomide in vivo using a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model. RNA sequencing and follow-up proteomic analysis revealed that upregulation of phosphatase DUSP1 and consecutive downregulation of phosphorylated-p38 MAPK can underlie the pro-differentiation effect of CP-673451 on GBM cells. Overall, the present study identifies a potential novel therapeutic option that could benefit GBM patients in the future, through differentiation of residual GSCs post-surgery, with the aim to limit recurrence and improve quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W4226306625,"Intellectual Disability (ID) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 3% of children and adolescents worldwide. It is a heterogeneous and multifactorial clinical condition. Several methodologies have been used to identify the genetic causes of ID and in recent years new generation sequencing techniques, such as exome sequencing, have enabled an increase in the detection of new pathogenic variants and new genes associated with ID. The aim of this study was to evaluate exome sequencing with analysis of the ID gene panel as a tool to increase the diagnostic yield of patients with ID/GDD/MCA in Central Brazil, together with karyotype and CMA tests. A retrospective cohort study was carried out with 369 patients encompassing both sexes. Karyotype analysis was performed for all patients. CMA was performed for patients who did not present structural and or numerical alterations in the karyotype. Cases that were not diagnosed after performing karyotyping and CMA were referred for exome sequencing using a gene panel for ID that included 1,252 genes. The karyotype identified chromosomal alterations in 34.7% (128/369). CMA was performed in 83 patients who had normal karyotype results resulting in a diagnostic yield of 21.7% (18/83). Exome sequencing with analysis of the ID gene panel was performed in 19 trios of families that had negative results with previous methodologies. With the ID gene panel analysis, we identified mutations in 63.1% (12/19) of the cases of which 75% (9/12) were pathogenic variants,8.3% (1/12) likely pathogenic and in 16.7% (2/12) it concerned a Variant of Uncertain Significance. With the three methodologies applied, it was possible to identify the genetic cause of ID in 42.3% (156/369) of the patients. In conclusion, our studies show the different methodologies that can be useful in diagnosing ID/GDD/MCA and that whole exome sequencing followed by gene panel analysis, when combined with clinical and laboratory screening, is an efficient diagnostic strategy."

Outcomes included psychological distress, mental and physical health, work, social interactions and finances. Regression models examined health changes during and following lockdown.The Victorian lockdown led to increased psychological distress. Health impacts coincided with greater social isolation and work loss. Following the extended lockdown, mental health, work and social interactions recovered to an extent whereby no significant long-lasting effects were identified in Victoria compared to the rest of Australia.The Victorian community lockdown had adverse health consequences, which reversed upon release from lockdown. Governments should weigh all potential health impacts of lockdown. Services and programs to reduce the negative impacts of lockdown may include increases in mental health care, encouraging safe social interactions and supports to maintain employment relationships."

The aim of this study is to better understand how the Rwandan government's mobilization and demand generation efforts have impacted community norms and interpersonal discourse surrounding family planning. Eight focus group discussions with family planning providers and 32 in-depth interviews with experienced modern contraceptive users were conducted in 2018 in the two Rwandan districts with the highest and the lowest contraceptive prevalence rates. Results suggest that outspoken government support, mass media, and community meetings were valuable sources of information about family planning. Information received through these channels generated interpersonal dialogue about contraceptives through both conversation and observation; however, rumors and misinformation remained a significant barrier to use. A once taboo subject is now normative among married couples. Continuing to address common fears and misinformation through communication channels such as mass media and community meetings may help to further increase contraceptive uptake in Rwanda."

https://openalex.org/W4225830776,"Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is reportedly involved in hepatic lipid metabolism, but the results are contradictory, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we focused on elucidating the effects of Nrf2 on hepatic adipogenesis and on determining the possible underlying mechanism. We established a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) model in a high-fat diet (HFD)-fed Nrf2 knockout (Nrf2 KO) mice; further, a cell model of lipid accumulation was established using mouse primary hepatocytes (MPHs) treated with free fatty acids (FAs). Using these models, we investigated the relationship between Nrf2 and autophagy and its role in the development of NAFLD. We observed that Nrf2 expression levels were upregulated in patients with NAFLD and diet-induced obese mice. Nrf2 deficiency led to hepatic lipid accumulation in vivo and in vitro, in addition to, promoting lipogenesis mainly by increasing SREBP-1c activity. Moreover, Nrf2 deficiency attenuated autophagic flux and inhibited the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes in vivo and in vitro. Decreased autophagy caused reduced lipolysis in the liver. Importantly, chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) and dual-luciferase assay results proved that Nrf2 bound to the LAMP1 promoter and regulated its transcriptional activity. Accordingly, we report that Nrf2-LAMP1 interaction plays an indispensable role in Nrf2-regulated hepatosteatosis. Our data collectively confirm that Nrf2 deficiency promotes hepatosteatosis by enhancing SREBP-1c activity and attenuating autophagy. Our findings provide a novel multi-pathway effect of Nrf2 on lipid metabolism in the liver. We believe that multi-target intervention of Nrf2 is a novel strategy for the treatment of NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W4226218947,"Ixodes scapularis ticks are expanding their range in parts of northeastern North America, bringing with them pathogens of public health concern. While rodents like the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus, are considered the primary reservoir of many emerging tick-borne pathogens, the contribution of birds, as alternative hosts and reservoirs, to local transmission cycles has not yet been firmly established. From 2016 to 2018, we collected host-seeking ticks and examined rodent and bird hosts for ticks at 48 sites in a park where blacklegged ticks are established in Quebec, Canada, in order to characterize the distribution of pathogens in ticks and mammalian and avian hosts. We found nearly one third of captured birds (n = 849) and 70% of small mammals (n = 694) were infested with I. scapularis. Five bird and three mammal species transmitted Borrelia burgdorferi to feeding larvae (n larvae tested = 2257) and we estimated that about one fifth of the B. burgdorferi-infected questing nymphs in the park acquired their infection from birds, the remaining being attributable to mice. Ground-foraging bird species were more parasitized than other birds, and species that inhabited open habitat were more frequently infested and were more likely to transmit B. burgdorferi to larval ticks feeding upon them. Female birds were more likely to transmit infection than males, without age differentiation, whereas in mice, adult males were more likely to transmit infection than juveniles and females. We also detected Borrelia miyamotoi in larvae collected from birds, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum from a larva collected from a white-footed mouse. This study highlights the importance of characterising the reservoir potential of alternative reservoir hosts and to quantify their contribution to transmission dynamics in different species assemblages. This information is key to identifying the most effective host-targeted risk mitigation actions."

On the basis of previous studies, the research takes the credit business in the capital market as the research object, and improves the ability of resource allocation by optimizing the financial transaction structure. On this basis, through comparative analysis, the grey system model is implemented. back propagation neural network model under deep learning is used to evaluate the capital market risk of green credit business exploration, and the data of different provinces in China from 2009 to 2019 are taken as an example to verify. The model is used to measure the relationship between green credit business and industrial structure. Additionally, it also analyzes the main factors affecting the efficiency of green credit. The results show that green credit mainly affects the industrial structure through enterprise capital and financing channels. China's overall green credit adjustment has had a significant upgrading effect on the industrial structure. The impact of green credit on industrial structure adjustment is different in the east, middle, and west regions. Optimizing the project capital structure, promoting seasonal financial transformation, setting up the function of innovation platform, and improving the internal governance structure of enterprises can improve financing efficiency and realize green and sustainable economic development in the future. The research results can provide a theoretical basis for the green development of China's financial market and the application of deep learning neural network algorithm under the background of Internet of things."
https://openalex.org/W4226201346,"Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, as well as the accumulation of intraneuronal proteinaceous inclusions known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. The major protein component of Lewy inclusions is the intrinsically disordered protein α-synuclein (α-Syn), which can adopt diverse amyloid structures. Different conformational strains of α-Syn have been proposed to be related to the onset of distinct synucleinopathies; however, how specific amyloid fibrils cause distinctive pathological traits is not clear. Here, we generated three different α-Syn amyloid conformations at different pH and salt concentrations and analyzed the activity of SynuClean-D (SC-D), a small aromatic molecule, on these strains. We show that incubation of α-Syn with SC-D reduced the formation of aggregates and the seeded polymerization of α-Syn in all cases. Moreover, we found that SC-D exhibited a general fibril disaggregation activity. Finally, we demonstrate that treatment with SC-D also reduced strain-specific intracellular accumulation of phosphorylated α-Syn inclusions. Taken together, we conclude that SC-D may be a promising hit compound to inhibit polymorphic α-Syn aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W4226316807,"Abstract Cancer cells often experience high basal levels of DNA replication stress (RS), for example due to hyperactivation of oncoproteins like MYC or RAS. Therefore, cancer cells are considered to be sensitive to drugs that exacerbate the level of RS or block the intra S-phase checkpoint. Consequently, RS-inducing drugs including ATR and CHK1 inhibitors are used or evaluated as anti-cancer therapies. However, drug resistance and lack of biomarkers predicting therapeutic efficacy limit efficient use. This raises the question what determines sensitivity of individual cancer cells to RS. Here, we report that oncogenic RAS does not only enhance the sensitivity to ATR/CHK1 inhibitors by directly causing RS. Instead, we observed that HRAS G12V dampens the activation of the P53-dependent transcriptional response to drug-induced RS, which in turn confers sensitivity to RS. We demonstrate that inducible expression of HRAS G12V sensitized cells to ATR and CHK1 inhibitors. Using RNA-sequencing of FACS-sorted cells we discovered that P53 signaling is the sole transcriptional response to RS. However, oncogenic RAS attenuates the transcription of P53 and TGF-β pathway components which consequently dampens P53 target gene expression. Accordingly, live cell imaging showed that HRAS G12V exacerbates RS in S/G2-phase, which could be rescued by stabilization of P53. Thus, our results demonstrate that transcriptional control of P53 target genes is the prime determinant in the response to ATR/CHK1 inhibitors and show that hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway impedes this response. Our findings suggest that the level of oncogenic MAPK signaling could predict sensitivity to intra-S-phase checkpoint inhibition in cancers with intact P53."
https://openalex.org/W4226401205,"Homologous recombination (HR)-based gene therapy using adeno-associated viruses (AAV-HR) without nucleases has several advantages over classic gene therapy, especially the potential for permanent transgene expression. However, the low efficiency of AAV-HR remains a major limitation. Here, we tested a series of small-molecule compounds and found that ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) inhibitors substantially enhance AAV-HR efficiency in mouse and human liver cell lines approximately threefold. Short-term administration of the RNR inhibitor fludarabine increased the in vivo efficiency of both non-nuclease- and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated AAV-HR two- to sevenfold in the murine liver, without causing overt toxicity. Fludarabine administration induced transient DNA damage signaling in both proliferating and quiescent hepatocytes. Notably, the majority of AAV-HR events occurred in non-proliferating hepatocytes in both fludarabine-treated and control mice, suggesting that the induction of transient DNA repair signaling in non-dividing hepatocytes was responsible for enhancing AAV-HR efficiency in mice. These results suggest that use of a clinically approved RNR inhibitor can potentiate AAV-HR-based genome-editing therapeutics."

https://openalex.org/W4225660073,"While the classical knapsack problem has been the object to be solved by optimization algorithm proposals for many years, another version of this problem, discounted {0-1} knapsack problem, is gaining a lot of attention recently. The original knapsack problem requires selecting specific items from an item set to maximize the total benefit while ensuring that the total weight does not exceed the knapsack capacity. Meanwhile, discounted {0-1} knapsack problem has more stringent requirements in which items are divided into groups, and only up to one item from a particular group can be selected. This constraint, which does not exist in the original knapsack problem, makes discounted {0-1} knapsack problem even more challenging. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm based on salp swarm algorithm in the form of four different variants to resolve the discounted {0-1} knapsack problem. In addition, we also make use of an effective data modeling mechanism and a greedy repair operator that helps overcome local optima when finding the global optimal solution. Experimental and statistical results show that our algorithm is superior to currently available algorithms in terms of solution quality, convergence, and other statistical criteria."
https://openalex.org/W4226078904,"Background Despite cervical cancer being a major public health concern in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), screening coverage is very low. The reasons and factors for this are unknown. This study aimed to identify factors associated with uptake of cervical cancer screening among women aged 25–60 years. Methods The case-control study was conducted among women aged 25–60 years in Vientiane Capital and Luang Prabang province from March 15 to May 31, 2018. A total of 360 women were included in the study, a ratio of two controls per case. The cases were women who had undergone cervical cancer screening over the last five years. The controls were women who had never been screened or screened more than five years before, matched to the cases with residency and age (± five years). The cases were selected from central and provincial hospitals and the controls from the same community and districts where the cases resided. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with cervical cancer screening. Results The mean age was 42.37±9.4 years (range: 25–60), 66.67% were women from Vientiane Capital, and 86.11% were married. The common reasons for not being screened were the absence of clinical signs and symptoms (45.28%) followed by never having heard about cervical cancer (13.33%). In the multivariable analyses, we found that having sexually transmitted infections (AOR = 3.93; 95% CI = 1.92–8.05), receiving recommendations for screening from health workers (AOR = 3.85; 95% CI = 1.90–7.78), a high score for knowledge (AOR = 7.90; 95% CI = 2.43–25.69) and attitude towards cervical cancer prevention and treatment (AOR = 2.26; 95% CI = 1.18–7.16), and having a car to travel (AOR = 2.97; 95% CI = 1.44–6.11) had a positive impact on undergoing cervical cancer screening. Conclusion Gynecological consultations, increased knowledge and positive attitudes result in women undergoing screening. Therefore, health education and advocacy for cervical cancer prevention should be provided to women."

Thus, leadership assignment as a common practice in online collaborative learning merits special attention. To investigate the impact of assigned leadership and its key characteristics in promoting team learning in the online context, a semester-long quasi-experiment was conducted with 94 students in a graduate-level blended course. The results revealed significant differences between assigned leaders and group members in certain participating behaviors. However, the impact of assigned leadership on learning outcomes and perceptions was insubstantial. Additionally, student leaders' academic achievement was found to have little impact on group members' learning behaviors and learning outcomes, and mixed results were reported regarding the influence of leader behaviors on group performance. The research findings can inform the crucial decision of leader selection and extend our understanding of leadership in online collaborative learning."

This paper used technology accumulation as the threshold variable to construct a dynamic panel threshold model to explore the technology accumulation threshold effect of independent R&D on innovation performance of China's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry over the period 1995~2019. The results show that the independent R&D of China's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry had a significant promotion effect on innovation performance. However, it is constrained by the level of technology accumulation, showing a significant double threshold effect of technology accumulation. A moderate level of technology accumulation was more conducive to independent R&D to drive innovation performance, while lower or higher technology accumulation will weaken independent R&D promotion on innovation performance.

There was no significant difference in the HRs and log-rank tests in the Kaplan-Meier curves based on crown location parameters (P > 0.05). However, placement on vital teeth was associated with higher risks than on nonvital teeth (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.03-2.23). In addition, the cement as a covariate yielded a high HR.The location of CAD/CAM composite molar crowns is unlikely a risk factor for complications; therefore, these crowns can be clinically applied to all molars. However, the application of such molar crowns to vital teeth and the use of a cement other than adhesive resin cement present risks."
https://openalex.org/W4225981829,"Background Caesarean section (C-sections) is a medically critical and often life-saving procedure for prevention of childbirth complications. However, there are reports of its overuse, especially in women covered by private insurance as compared to public insurance. This study evaluates the difference in C-Section rates among nulliparous women in Florida hospitals across insurance groups and quantifies the contribution of maternal and hospital factors in explaining the difference in rates. Methods We used Florida’s inpatient data provided by the Florida Agency for HealthCare Administration (FLAHCA) and focused on low-risk births that occurred between January 1, 2010, and September 30, 2015. A Fairlie decomposition method was performed on cross-sectional data to decompose the difference in C-Section rates between insurance groups into the proportion explained versus unexplained by the differences in observable maternal and hospital factors. Results Of the 386,612 NTSV low-risk births, 72,984 were delivered via C-Section (18.87%). Higher prevalence of C-section at maternal level was associated with diabetes, hypertension, and the expectant mother being over 35 years old. Higher prevalence of C-section at the hospital level was associated with lower occupancy rate, presence of neonatal ICU (NICU) unit and higher obstetrics care level in the hospital. Private insurance coverage in expectant mothers is associated with C-section rates that were 4.4 percentage points higher as compared to that of public insurance. Just over 33.7% of the 4.4 percentage point difference in C-section rates between the two insurance groups can be accounted for by maternal and hospital factors. Conclusions The study identifies that the prevalence of C-sections in expectant mothers covered by private insurance is higher compared to mothers covered by public insurance. Although, majority of the difference in C-Section rates across insurance groups remains unexplained (around 66.3%), the main contributor that explains the other 33.7% is advancing maternal age and socioeconomic status of the expectant mother. Further investigation to explore additional factors that explain the difference needs to be done if United States wants to target specific policies to lower overall C-Section rate."
https://openalex.org/W4226034614,"Medicago falcata is one of the leguminous forage crops, which grows well in arid and semiarid region. To fully investigate the mechanism of drought resistance response in M. falcata, we challenged the M. falcata plants with 30% PEG-6000, and performed physiological and transcriptome analyses. It was found that, the activities of antioxidant enzymes (eg. SOD, POD, and CAT) and soluble sugar content were all increased in the PEG-treated group, as compared to the control group. Transcriptome results showed that a total of 706 genes were differentially expressed in the PEG-treated plants in comparison with the control. Gene enrichment analyses on differentially expressed genes revealed that a number of genes in various pathway were significantly enriched, including the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (ko00940) and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (ko00010), indicating the involvement of these key pathways in drought response. Furthermore, the expression levels of seven differentially expressed genes were verified to be involved in drought response in M. falcata by qPCR. Taken together, these results will provide valuable information related to drought response in M. falcata and lay a foundation for molecular studies and genetic breeding of legume crops in future research."
https://openalex.org/W4225789882,"Objectives The aim of this study was to describe the seroprevalence, presenting complaint, clinicopathological changes, co-morbidities and outcomes of feline leukemia virus positive cats presented to a specialty referral center in Florida, USA. Methods In this retrospective study, medical records of 8050 cats presented to a private referral center from August 2008 to September 2019 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria required was a positive result for feline leukemia virus by point-of-care antigen testing or immunofluorescence assay. Results Forty-one cases met the inclusion criteria. Of 2002 cats that were tested, 41 cats (2%) met the inclusion criteria. One cat had a negative point of care antigen test result and positive bone marrow IFA result. The mean age at diagnosis was 9 years. The main reasons for presentation were abnormal complete blood cell count results (35%), followed by pleural effusion (18%), and anorexia (15%). The most common laboratory abnormalities included anaemia (71%), of which 74% had a nonregenerative anemia, thrombocytopenia (52%), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (50%), hyperbilirubinemia (35%), and hypokalemia (35%). Seven percent of cats (3/41) were also positive for feline immunodeficiency virus. The most common diagnoses were neoplasia (76%) and bone marrow disorders (12%). Cats with neoplasia were significantly younger. Survival to discharge was 88%. Conclusion and relevance Results of this study show that feline leukemia virus is uncommon in secondary referral center, even if this represents a population of unhealthy cats. The most common associated diagnosis was neoplasia, which was more likely to be seen in younger cats (&lt; 4 years of age). The mean age of cats positive for feline leukemia virus was also older than previously published data. These findings support the current guidelines which indicate that cats presented with clinical illness should be tested for FeLV at the time of presentation."
https://openalex.org/W4225824191,"Individuals receiving palliative care (PC) are generally thought to prefer to receive care and die in their homes, yet little research has assessed the quality of home- and community-based PC. This project developed a set of valid and reliable quality indicators (QIs) that can be generated using data that are already gathered with interRAI assessments-an internationally validated set of tools commonly used in North America for home care clients. The QIs can serve as decision-support measures to assist providers and decision makers in delivering optimal care to individuals and their families.The development efforts took part in multiple stages, between 2017-2021, including a workshop with clinicians and decision-makers working in PC, qualitative interviews with individuals receiving PC, families and decision makers and a modified Delphi panel, based on the RAND/ULCA appropriateness method.Based on the workshop results, and qualitative interviews, a set of 27 candidate QIs were defined. They capture issues such as caregiver burden, pain, breathlessness, falls, constipation, nausea/vomiting and loneliness. These QIs were further evaluated by clinicians/decision makers working in PC, through the modified Delphi panel, and five were removed from further consideration, resulting in 22 QIs.Through in-depth and multiple-stakeholder consultations we developed a set of QIs generated with data already collected with interRAI assessments. These indicators provide a feasible basis for quality benchmarking and improvement systems for care providers aiming to optimize PC to individuals and their families."

This study aims to evaluate the clinical features and prognosis of ALS patients with AID.This retrospective study was based on the ALS Registry dataset of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2013 to 2020. Clinical features and inflammatory biomarkers at registration were compared between ALS patients with coexisting AIDs and those without (controls). The medical records of immunotherapy were also collected. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model were used to study the survival of ALS patients.There are 26 (1.6%) ALS patients with AIDs in our database. The ALS patients with AIDs had older ages at onset and poorer respiratory function than controls (p<0.05). After propensity score matching by sex, onset age, and disease duration, the difference in respiratory function remained significant between groups. We found no differences in overall survival between ALS patients with and without AIDs before and after matching (p = 0.836; p = 0.395). Older age at onset, rapid disease progression, and lower erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were associated with shorter survival (p<0.05). Among ALS patients with AIDs, 8 (30.8%) had a history of immunotherapy and showed slightly prolonged survival compared with those without immunotherapy, but the results did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.355).Patients with coexisting ALS and AIDs had older onset age and poorer respiratory function but similar overall survival than those with pure ALS."
https://openalex.org/W4225811000,"Drosophila saltans group belongs to the subgenus Sophophora (family Drosophilidae), and it is subdivided into five subgroups, with 23 species. The species in this group are widely distributed in the Americas, primarily in the Neotropics. In the literature, the phylogenetic reconstruction of this group has been performed with various markers, but many inconsistencies remain. Here, we present a phylogenetic reconstruction of the saltans group with a greater number of species, 16 species, which is the most complete to date for the saltans group and includes all subgroups, in a combined analysis with morphological and molecular markers. We incorporated 48 morphological characters of male terminalia, the highest number used to date, and molecular markers based on mitochondrial genes COI and COII . Based on the results, which have recovered the five subgroups as distinct lineages, we propose a new hypothesis regarding the phylogenetic relationships among the subgroups of the saltans group. The relationships of the species within the sturtevanti and elliptica subgroups were well supported. The saltans subgroup showed several polytomies, but the relationship between the sibling species D . austrosaltans and D . saltans and their close relation with D . nigrosaltans were well supported in the molecular and total evidence analyses. The morphological analysis additionally supported the formation of the clade D . nigrosaltans — D . pseudosaltans . The observed polytomies may represent synchronous radiations or have resulted from speciation rates that have been too fast relative to the pace of substitution accumulation."

Evaluation of industry is an important step in industry optimization. To this end, this study proposes an integrated evaluation method combining social network analysis (SNA) and the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method. Specifically, SNA method are used to calculate indicators, the measurement weights are calculated by the Entropy Weight (EW) Method, and the rank of each industry is determined by the TOPSIS method. Critical industries are identified based on China’s input-output data from 2002 to 2017. The results indicate that Manufacturing Industry and the Metal products have a high evaluation, but the Research and Development have a low evaluation value at all times. According to the results, we suggest that the government should optimize the allocation of resources and promote the transfer of resources to balance industrial development."
https://openalex.org/W4226067600,"Systems of particles in turbulent flows exhibit clustering where particles form patches in certain regions of space. Previous studies have shown that motile particles accumulate inside the vortices and in downwelling regions, while light and heavy non-motile particles accumulate inside and outside the vortices, respectively. While strong clustering is generated in regions of high vorticity, clustering of motile particles is still observed in fluid flows where vortices are short-lived. In this study, we investigate the clustering of fast swimming particles in a low-Reynolds-number turbulent flow and characterize the probability distributions of particle speed and acceleration and their influence on particle clustering. We simulate gyrotactic swimming particles in a cubic system with homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flow. Here, the swimming velocity explored is relatively faster than what has been explored in other reports. The fluid flow is produced by conducting a direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equation. In contrast with the previous results, our results show that swimming particles can accumulate outside the vortices, and clustering is dictated by the swimming number and is invariant with the stability number. We have also found that highly clustered particles are sufficiently characterized by their acceleration, where the increase in the acceleration frequency distribution of the most clustered particles suggests a direct influence of acceleration on clustering. Furthermore, the acceleration of the most clustered particles resides in acceleration values where a cross-over in the acceleration PDFs are observed, an indicator that particle acceleration generates clustering. Our findings on motile particles clustering can be applied to understanding the behavior of faster natural or artificial swimmers."
https://openalex.org/W4226079602,"Chronic musculoskeletal (CMSK) pain associated with musculoskeletal disorders like low back pain or neck pain are the leading causes of disability. While CMSK pain has the potential to negatively influence motor learning, there is limited research to understand the impact of CMSK on motor learning. In order to examine differences in motor learning between individuals with and without CMSK we modified a serial reaction time task to assess motor learning of a repetitive reaching task. The paradigm was used to assess both explicit and implicit motor learning. In a cross-sectional study design, seventeen participants with chronic neck pain (CNP) (5 males) and 21 controls (8 males) were recruited. In addition, physical, cognitive, sensorimotor, disability and pain assessments were used to examine differences between individuals with and without CNP. All participants with CNP were categorized as having mild disability. There was no difference in cognitive assessments and minimal differences in physical measures between groups. Examining motor learning, groups with and without CNP demonstrated similar outcomes in both explicit and implicit motor learning. There was one notable performance difference between groups in the reaching task, the group with CNP demonstrated slower reaching movements outward and inward during blocks without explicit information. This may suggest a cautious approach to movement with reduced explicit information. Findings from this study provide insight on motor learning in individuals with mildly-disabling CNP, further research is necessary to examine how instruction can impact peak performance in people with CMSK pain."
https://openalex.org/W4226310211,"To reduce the collision risk to civil airliners caused by suborbital vehicle disintegration events, this paper uses a covariance propagation algorithm to model the debris landing point of suborbital disintegration accidents and gives a collision probability analysis method for civil airliners encountering debris during the cruise. Collision warning is performed for airborne risk targets to improve the emergency response capability of the ATC surveillance system to hazardous situations. The algorithm models the three-dimensional spatial motion target localization problem as a Gauss-Markov process, quantifying the location of debris landing points in the vicinity of nominal trajectories. By predicting the aircraft trajectory, the calculation of the inter-target collision probability is converted into an integration problem of a two-dimensional normally distributed probability density function in a circular domain. Compared with the traditional Monte Carlo method, the calculation speed of debris drop points is improved, which can meet the requirements of civil aviation for real-time response to unexpected situations."
https://openalex.org/W4226383785,"Uganda has a high maternal mortality rate combined with poor use of health facilities at childbirth among youth. Improved use of maternal health services by the youth would help reduce maternal deaths in the country. Predictors of use of health facilities at childbirth among unmarried compared to married youth aged 15-24 years in Uganda between 2006 and 2016 are examined.Binary logistic regression was conducted on the pooled data of the 2006, 2011 and 2016 Uganda Demographic and Health Surveys among youth who had given birth within five years before each survey. This analysis was among a sample of 764 unmarried, compared to 5,176 married youth aged 15-24 years.Overall, unmarried youth were more likely to have a childbirth within the health facilities (79.3%) compared to married youth (67.6%). Higher odds of use of health facilities at childbirth were observed among youth with at least secondary education (OR = 2.915, 95%CI = 1.747-4.865 for unmarried vs OR = 1.633, 95%CI = 1.348-1.979 for married) and frequent antenatal care of at least four visits (OR = 1.758, 95%CI = 1.153-2.681 for unmarried vs OR = 1.792, 95%CI = 1.573-2.042 for married). Results further showed that youth with parity two or more, those that resided in rural areas and those who were engaged in agriculture had reduced odds of the use of health facilities at childbirth. In addition, among married youth, the odds of using health facilities at childbirth were higher among those with at least middle wealth index, and those with frequent access to the newspapers (OR = 1.699, 95%CI = 1.162-2.486), radio (OR = 1.290, 95%CI = 1.091-1.525) and television (OR = 1.568, 95%CI = 1.149-2.138) compared to those with no access to each of the media, yet these were not significant among unmarried youth.Frequent use of antenatal care and higher education attainment were associated with increased chances of use of health facilities while higher parity, rural residence and being employed in the agriculture sector were negatively associated with use of health facilities at childbirth among both unmarried and married youth. To enhance use of health facilities among youth, there is a need to encourage frequent antenatal care use, especially for higher parity births and for rural residents, and design policies that will improve access to mass media, youth's education level and their economic status."
https://openalex.org/W4225562553,"This study aimed to explore the impact of ozonated water (OW) disinfestation on soil fungal community composition in continuous ginger field. All soil samples were collected in continuous ginger field. There were two groups and 5 time points (0, 1, 3, 5, 9 day) in our study, including OW disinfestation treatment group (O 3 group) and control group (CK group). Via internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing and further analysis, the changes of fungal community composition were determined. As a result, at 0 and 9 days after aeration, the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in O 3 group were significantly higher than that in CK group. Compared with the CK group, in O 3 group: the ACE and Chao1 index significantly increased on day 1, and the Shannon index significantly decreased while Simpson index significantly increased on day 0 after aeration. In O 3 group, there were dynamic changes of top 10 abundance fungi from the genus-level and the growth of Trichoderma and Rhodotorula had been promoted while Hannaella was inhibited. In conclusion, OW disinfestation had complicated impacts on fungal communities in continuous ginger fields. The growth of Trichoderma and Rhodotorula has been promoted during disinfestation, which provided more reference information for soil OW disinfestation research."

Evidence on the prevention of nosocomial infections for nursing home residents by general practitioners during their medical visits in nursing homes or how they enable nursing home residents to perform hand hygiene measures is lacking. This study aimed to explore hand hygiene behaviors of general practitioners in nursing homes, their attitudes toward infection prevention measures, and the enablement of nursing home residents in performing hand hygiene measures.Semi-structured interviews were conducted with general practitioners and nursing home residents in Germany. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis.Overall, 12 general practitioners and 12 nursing home residents participated in the study. The general practitioners expressed the fact that the possibilities for practicing hand hygiene differ in individual nursing homes. For nursing home residents, the availability of hand rub solutions was limited. Instructions for residents on hand disinfection from general practitioners was not described. Due to the lack of enablement, the residents' knowledge on how to correctly perform hand hygiene was low, although some of the nursing home residents have experience with multidrug-resistant organisms. The nursing home residents varied in their needs for active participation and enablement during the general practitioners visit.Nursing home residents require continuous enablement by their general practitioners to maintain adequate hand hygiene. Therefore, general practitioners should consider the different needs of nursing home residents to ensure adequate individual hand hygiene and safety for the residents. Existing guidelines for infection prevention and control do not adequately cover the nursing home care setting for the enablement of residents to enquire about hand hygiene."
https://openalex.org/W4225725982,"Background Most childhood diarrheal illnesses are a result of the faeco-oral transmission of infected food, water, and unclean fingers. The present paper was conducted to estimate the prevalence of hygienic disposal of stools (HDS) and its associated factors, and further quantify the impact of HDS on diarrheal diseases among children under two years. Methods A cross-sectional design was used to evaluate three rounds of the Ghana Demographic Health Survey (GDHS) from 2003–2014 involving 4869 women with children aged under two years. The outcomes were prevalence of HDS and diarrheal diseases. Poisson regression model was employed to assess risk factors associated with HDS and dominance analysis was used to rank the important risk factors. Inverse Probability Weighting Poisson Regression Adjustment (IPWPRA) with Propensity Score 1:1 density kernel-based matching was employed to assess impact. Results The pooled prevalence rate of HDS was 26.5%(95%CI = 24.6–28.4) and it ranged from 18.7% (95%CI = 16.4–21.2) in 2014 to 38.8%(95%CI = 35.3–42.4) in 2003. Diarrhea diseases pooled prevalence was 17.9%(95%CI = 16.4–19.5) and ranged from 13.3%(95%CI = 11.1–15.9) in 2014 to 25.4%(95%CI = 22.2–28.9) in 2003. The overall growth rate for HDS and prevalence of diarrhea diseases, decreased by 21.6% and 11.4% respectively. The most important risk factors of HDS from dominance analysis included; age of the child, wealth index, and differences in region. From pooled data wealth index, increasing age of the child, and regional disparity constituted approximately 72% of the overall impact (Weighted Standardized Dominance Statistics (WSDS) = 0.30, 0.24, and 0.19 respectively). In 2014, they constituted approximately 79% (WSDS = 0.139, 0.177 and 0.471 respectively). The average prevalence of diarrheal diseases among children of women who practiced HDS reduced over the period of the GDHS compared to those whose mothers did not practice HDS [2008 ATE(95%CI) = -0.09(-0.16–0.02), 2014 ATE(95%CI) = -0.05(-0.09–0.01) and Pooled data ATE(95%CI) = -0.05(-0.09–0.02)]. Conclusion This analysis has provided empirical evidence of the impact of practicing HDS in Ghana from a national household survey. Implementation of the WASH agenda in this low-income setting requires a synergy of interventions and collaborations of actors (government, private and development partners) to improve water and sanitation facilities and to increase hygiene education to prevent the spread of diseases including diarrhea by 2025."
https://openalex.org/W4225861552,"As an invasive organism spreads into a novel environment, it may encounter strong selective pressures to adapt to abiotic and biotic challenges. We examined the effect of water temperature during larval life on rates of survival and growth of the early life-history stages of cane toads (Rhinella marina) from two geographic regions (tropical vs. temperate) in the species' invaded range in eastern Australia. If local adaptation at the southern (cool-climate) invasion front has extended the cold-tolerance of early life-stages, we would expect to see higher viability of southern-population toads under cooler conditions. Our comparisons revealed no such divergence: the effects of water temperature on rates of larval survival and growth, time to metamorphosis, size at metamorphosis and locomotor performance of metamorphs were similar in both sets of populations. In two cases where tropical and temperate-zone populations diverged in responses to temperature, the tropical animals performed better at low to medium temperatures than did conspecifics from cooler regions. Adaptation to low temperatures in the south might be constrained by behavioural shifts (e.g., in reproductive seasonality, spawning-site selection) that allow toads to breed in warmer water even in cool climates, by gene flow from warmer-climate populations, or by phylogenetic conservatism in these traits."

An Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire model that is not lacking in relevant content has been supported in three different samples, but existing studies on this model present shortcomings regarding generalizations to the general population. Therefore, the general purpose of the current research was to test the reliability and interpretation validity of the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire 6.0 scores in adults of both sexes from the Mexican general population. After translating, adapting, and assessing the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire 6.0 in the target population through three pilot studies, we conducted two independent studies. In Study 1, 684 women and 433 men aged 18-83 participated, whereas in Study 2, 591 women and 382 men aged 18-86 did it. They answered the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire 6.0 and a measure of either body dissatisfaction (Study 1) or self-esteem (Study 2). According to confirmatory factor analyses, the 14-item Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire model that we tested fit acceptably for the four samples (two female, two male) and was invariant across sex. All 14-item Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire 6.0 scores were reliable according to Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega, except for only one factor score in men. Pearson's correlations of the 14-item Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire 6.0 scores with body dissatisfaction and self-esteem were positive and negative, respectively. This new Latin American Spanish translation of the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire 6.0 works broadly as expected and provides evidence to extend the generalization of previous studies to the general population. Thus, the present translation of the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire 6.0 may be a valuable tool in the field of eating disorders for researchers and practitioners studying or serving Latin American Spanish speakers of either sex from the general population."

This prospective COVID-19 Health Action Response for Marines (CHARM) study enabled assessment of T cell responses against S, N and M proteins in symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected participants. At enrollment all participants were negative by qPCR; follow-up occurred biweekly and bimonthly for the next 6 weeks. Study participants who tested positive by qPCR SARS-CoV-2 test were enrolled in an immune response sub-study. FluoroSpot interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and IL2 responses following qPCR-confirmed infection at enrollment (day 0), day 7 and 14 and more than 28 days later were measured using pools of 17mer peptides covering S, N, and M proteins, or CD4+CD8 peptide pools containing predicted epitopes from multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Among 124 asymptomatic and 105 symptomatic participants, SARS-CoV-2 infection generated IFN-γ responses to the S, N and M proteins that persisted longer in asymptomatic cases. IFN-γ responses were significantly (p = 0.001) more frequent to the N pool (51.4%) than the M pool (18.9%) among asymptomatic but not symptomatic subjects. Asymptomatic IFN-γ responders to the CD4+CD8 pool responded more frequently to the S pool (55.6%) and N pool (57.1%), than the M pool (7.1%), but not symptomatic participants. The frequencies of IFN-γ responses to the S and N+M pools peaked 7 days after the positive qPCR test among asymptomatic (S pool: 22.2%; N+M pool: 28.7%) and symptomatic (S pool: 15.3%; N+M pool 21.9%) participants and dropped by &gt;28 days. Magnitudes of post-infection IFN-γ and IL2 responses to the N+M pool were significantly correlated with IFN-γ and IL2 responses to the N and M pools. These data further support the central role of Th 1 -biased cell mediated immunity IFN-γ and IL2 responses, particularly to the N protein, in controlling COVID-19 symptoms, and justify T cell-based COVID-19 vaccines that include the N and S proteins."

We conducted a longitudinal study to analyze characteristics and trends of online information during a major COVID-19 outbreak in Da Nang province, Vietnam in July-August 2020 to understand public awareness and perceptions during an epidemic.We collected online information on COVID-19 incidence and mortality from online platforms in Vietnam between 1 July and 15 September, 2020, and assessed their trends over time against the epidemic curve. We explored the associations between engagement, sentiment polarity, and other characteristics of online information with different outbreak phases using Poisson regression and multinomial logistic regression analysis. We assessed the frequency of keywords over time, and conducted a semantic analysis of keywords using word segmentation.We found a close association between collected online information and the evolution of the COVID-19 situation in Vietnam. Online information generated higher engagements during compared to before the outbreak. There was a close relationship between sentiment polarity and posts' topics: the emotional tendencies about COVID-19 mortality were significantly more negative, and more neutral or positive about COVID-19 incidence. Online newspaper reported significantly more information in negative or positive sentiment than online forums or social media. Most topics of public concern followed closely the progression of the COVID-19 situation during the outbreak: development of the global pandemic and vaccination; the unfolding outbreak in Vietnam; and the subsiding of the outbreak after two months.This study shows how online information can reflect a public health threat in real time, and provides important insights about public awareness and perception during different outbreak phases. Our findings can help public health decision makers in Vietnam and other low and middle income countries with high internet penetration rates to design more effective communication strategies during critical phases of an epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W4226226388,"Influenza is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The flu vaccine is the most important strategy to prevent influenza. Studies indicate that individuals with mental health disorders are at an increased risk of comorbid health conditions that predispose them to severe flu complications. This study examined the association between mental distress and influenza vaccine coverage among non-institutionalized adults in the United States. Data was analyzed from the 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The analytic sample (453,924) included those with valid information on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and flu vaccine coverage. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were performed. Those with infrequent mental distress had 1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96,1.03) lower odds and those with frequent mental distress had 21% (95% CI 0.75,0.82) decrease odds of receiving the flu shot in comparison to those with no mental distress, given all else equal. A negative effect on influenza vaccination rates was observed with frequent mental distress when compared to those with no mental distress. Further studies are warranted to better understand this association."
