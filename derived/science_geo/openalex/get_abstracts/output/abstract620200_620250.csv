https://openalex.org/W2896917800,"Identification of genetic variants with effects on trait variability can provide insights into the biological mechanisms that control variation and can identify potential interactions. We propose a two-degree-of-freedom test for jointly testing mean and variance effects to identify such variants. We implement the test in a linear mixed model, for which we provide an efficient algorithm and software. To focus on biologically interesting settings, we develop a test for dispersion effects, that is, variance effects not driven solely by mean effects when the trait distribution is non-normal. We apply our approach to body mass index in the subsample of the UK Biobank population with British ancestry (n ~408,000) and show that our approach can increase the power to detect associated loci. We identify and replicate novel associations with significant variance effects that cannot be explained by the non-normality of body mass index, and we provide suggestive evidence for a connection between leptin levels and body mass index variability. The heteroskedastic linear mixed model is a new framework for testing both mean and variance effects on quantitative traits. Applying the heteroskedastic linear mixed model to body mass index in the UK Biobank shows that the approach increases the power to detect associated loci."

Methods The Spectrum-STI tool estimated trends in prevalence and incidence of active syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia, fitting South African prevalence data. Results were used, alongside programmatic surveillance data, to estimate trends in incident gonorrhea cases resistant to first-line treatment, and the reporting gap of symptomatic male gonorrhea and chlamydia cases treated but not reported as cases of urethritis syndrome. Results In 2017 adult (15–49 years) the estimated female and male prevalences for syphilis were 0.50% (95% CI: 0.32–0.80%) and 0.97% (0.19–2.28%), for gonorrhea 6.6% (3.8–10.8%) and 3.5% (1.7–6.1%), and for chlamydia 14.7% (9.9–21%) and 6.0% (3.8–10.4%), respectively. Between 1990 and 2017 the estimated prevalence of syphilis declined steadily in women and men, probably in part reflecting improved treatment coverage. For gonorrhea and chlamydia, estimated prevalence and incidence showed no consistent time trend in either women or men. Despite growing annual numbers of gonorrhea cases − reflecting population growth − the estimated number of first line treatment-resistant gonorrhea cases did not increase between 2008 and 2017, owing to changes in first-line antimicrobial treatment regimens for gonorrhea in 2008 and 2014/5. Case reporting completeness among treated male urethritis syndrome episodes was estimated at 10–28% in 2017. Conclusion South Africa continues to suffer a high STI burden. Improvements in access and quality of maternal, STI and HIV health care services likely contributed to the decline in syphilis prevalence. The lack of any decline in gonorrhea and chlamydia prevalence highlights the need to enhance STI services beyond clinic-based syndromic case management, to reinvigorate primary STI and HIV prevention and, especially for women, to screen for asymptomatic infections."
https://openalex.org/W2896380324,"Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) deacetylates and activates several mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation enzymes in the liver. Here, we investigated whether the protein acetylase GCN5 general control of amino acid synthesis 5-like 1 (GCN5L1), previously shown to oppose SIRT3 activity, is involved in the regulation of hepatic fatty acid oxidation. We show that GCN5L1 abundance is significantly up-regulated in response to an acute high-fat diet (HFD). Transgenic GCN5L1 overexpression in the mouse liver increased protein acetylation levels, and proteomic detection of specific lysine residues identified numerous sites that are co-regulated by GCN5L1 and SIRT3. We analyzed several fatty acid oxidation proteins identified by the proteomic screen and found that hyperacetylation of hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase trifunctional multienzyme complex subunit α (HADHA) correlates with increased GCN5L1 levels. Stable GCN5L1 knockdown in HepG2 cells reduced HADHA acetylation and increased activities of fatty acid oxidation enzymes. Mice with a liver-specific deletion of GCN5L1 were protected from hepatic lipid accumulation following a chronic HFD and did not exhibit hyperacetylation of HADHA compared with WT controls. Finally, we found that GCN5L1-knockout mice lack HADHA that is hyperacetylated at three specific lysine residues (Lys-350, Lys-383, and Lys-406) and that acetylation at these sites is significantly associated with increased HADHA activity. We conclude that GCN5L1-mediated regulation of mitochondrial protein acetylation plays a role in hepatic metabolic homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2897474789,"Robust preclinical testing is essential to predict clinical safety and efficacy and provide data to determine safe dose for first-in-man studies. There are a growing number of examples where the preclinical development of drugs failed to adequately predict clinical adverse events in part due to their assessment with inappropriate preclinical models. Preclinical investigations of T cell receptor (TCR)-based immunotherapies prove particularly challenging as these biologics are human-specific and thus the conventional testing in animal models is inadequate. As these molecules harness the full force of the immune system, and demonstrate tremendous potency, we set out to design a preclinical package that would ensure adequate evaluation of these therapeutics. Immune Mobilising Monoclonal TCR Against Cancer (ImmTAC) molecules are bi-specific biologics formed of an affinity-enhanced TCR fused to an anti-CD3 effector function. ImmTAC molecules are designed to activate human T lymphocytes and target peptides within the context of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA), thus require an intact human immune system and peptidome for suitable preclinical screening. Here we draw upon the preclinical testing of four ImmTAC molecules, including IMCgp100, the first ImmTAC molecule to reach the clinic, to present our comprehensive, informative and robust approach to in vitro preclinical efficacy and safety screening. This package comprises a broad range of cellular and molecular assays using human tissues and cultured cells to test efficacy, safety and specificity, and hence predict human responses in clinical trials. We propose that this entirely in vitro package offers a potential model to be applied to screening other TCR-based biologics."
https://openalex.org/W2897291636,"In the present study, a comprehensive approach to the biosorption process was proposed. Biosorption of Cr(III), Mn(II) and Mg(II) ions by a freshwater macroalga Cladophora glomerata was examined using several advanced techniques including FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy), ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry) and SEM-EDX (Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy). The enriched biomass can become a valuable, bioactive feed additive for different breeds of animals. Additionally, the collected algal biomass was soaked in water in order to reduce the content of carbohydrate, what is especially important for animals with metabolic disorders. The content of starch was reduced by 22% but additionally some elements-mainly Si, K and P were removed from the biomass. It was shown that the natural macroalga had better biosorption properties than soaked. Cr(III) ions were sorbed by the biomass in the highest extent, then Mn(II) and finally Mg(II) ions. The content of chromium in the enriched algal biomass increased almost ~200 000 times, manganese ~75 times and magnesium ~4.5 times (both for Mg(II) ions used from magnesium sulphate, as well as from magnesium chloride) when compared to the natural Cladophora glomerata. In the case of the soaked biomass the increase of the content of elements in the enriched biomass was as follows ~17 165 times for Cr, ~25 times for Mn and for Mg ~3.5 times for chloride and 3.8 times for sulphate. The type of magnesium salt (chloride or sulphate) had no significant effect on the algal sorption capacity. The proposed mechanism of the biosorption is ion exchange in which mainly potassium participated. The applied FTIR analysis enabled the identification of the functional groups that participated in the biosorption process-mainly carboxyl and hydroxyl. The main changes in the appearance of the spectra were observed for the following wavenumbers- 3300-3400; 2900; 1700; 1400-1500 and 1200-1300 cm-1. The application of SEM-EDX proved that the metal ions were sorbed on the surface of both tested algae."
https://openalex.org/W2896008001,"Variability in dehulling efficiency, colour, chemical composition and selected functional properties of raw and pre-treated bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.) (BG) flour from red and black-eye varieties were studied. Functional properties were water and oil absorption, gelation, pasting, emulsification and foaming capacity. Pre-treatment of seeds (i.e. soaking, roasting and combined soaking and roasting) improved dehulling efficiency of BG varieties. Protein content of flour ranged from 15.6–19.6%, starch from 47.8–52.0% and sucrose from 1.9–5%. An improvement was observed for protein and ash content of pre-treated flour compared to raw flour. Heat treatments increased onset gelatinization temperature of flour. Black-eye BG flours that had higher starch content, also had better gelation capacity than red BG flours. All pre-treatment methods decreased flour emulsification capacity and stability. Dry-roasting caused a greater decline than other methods, whereas soaking had little effect on emulsion stability. Further, soaking increased foaming capacity, whilst a decline was observed in roasted flour. All pre-treatment methods increased oil absorption capacity of both BG flour varieties. Overall, soaked and combined soaked and roasted flour is recommended for BG flour to be incorporated in food products."
https://openalex.org/W2897306357,"This study presents the first evaluation of Dat-e Adolescence, a dating violence prevention program aimed at adolescents in Spain. A cluster randomized control trial was used involving two groups (a control group and experimental group) and two waves (pre-test and post-test six months apart). 1,764 students from across seven state high schools in Andalucía (southern Spain) participated in the study (856 in the control group and 908 in the experimental group); 52.3% were boys (n = 918), with ages ranging from 11 to 19 years (average age = 14.73; SD = 1.34). Efficacy evaluation was analyzed using Latent Change Score Models and showed that the program did not impact on physical, psychological or online aggression and victimization, nor did it modify couple quality. It was, however, effective at modifying myths about romantic love, improving self-esteem, and improving anger regulation, as a trend. These initial results are promising and represent one of the first prevention programs evaluated in this country. Future follow-up will allow us to verify whether these results remain stable in the medium term."
https://openalex.org/W2896179392,"This study investigated the effect of the feeding behaviour on growth performance, and carcass and meat characteristics of 96 barrows fed ad libitum or restrictively with high or low amino acids (AA) diets according to a 2 × 2 factorial design. The feeding behaviour traits were measured with automated feeders. From 86 kg BW, half of the pigs were given feeds with high indispensable (AA) contents, while the other half received feeds with indispensable AA contents reduced by 9% in early finishing (86-118 kg BW) and by 18% in late finishing (118-145 kg BW). Body lipid and protein retentions were estimated from BW and backfat depth measures recorded at the beginning and end of each period. Pigs were slaughtered at 145 kg BW and carcass and meat quality data were recorded. Phenotypic correlations among feeding behaviours, growth performances, and carcass and meat traits were computed from all the data after adjustment for the effects of feeding treatments. As feeding rate was the behavioural trait most highly correlated with performance and carcass traits, the records of each pig were classified into feeding rate tertiles. Then, the data were statistically analysed using a mixed model, which included feed restriction (FR), AA reduction (AAR), the FR × AAR interaction and the feeding rate tertile as fixed factors, and pen as a random factor. Pigs eating faster (52.1 to 118.9 g/min) had significantly greater final body weights (16%), average daily weight gains (27%), estimated protein gains (22%), estimated lipid retention (46%), carcass weights (16%), weights of lean cuts (14%), weights of fat cuts (21%), proportions of fat in the carcass (14%), and 4% lower proportions of carcass lean cuts than pigs eating slowly (12.6 to 38.2 g/min). Manipulating the eating rate, through management or genetic strategies, could affect feed intake and subsequent growth performance, hence carcass quality, but have little influence on feed efficiency."

The diminished physiological activity of the hOGDHc and oxidative stress had been correlated with multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (1Gibson G.E.

At present, hOGDHc is recognized as a significant source of the reactive oxygen species (superoxide and H2O2) that could lead to oxidative stress in mitochondria (3Quinlan C.L. Goncalves R.L.

Another function suggested for hOGDHc is that it could be involved in histone modifications by lysine succinylation that represents an important mechanism for regulation of gene expression (5Wang Y.

Recently, we have reported findings in vitro suggesting both functional and regulatory cross-talk between the hOGDHc and a novel human 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase complex from the final degradation pathway of l-lysine, l-hydroxylysine, and l-tryptophan, demonstrating that the two complexes share the same dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase (hE2o) and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (hE3) components (7Nemeria N.S.

These findings raised important questions about assembly of the individual components in these two complexes and regarding the physiological relevance of such assemblies, information which is missing to date.

The thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase component (hE1o, EC 1.2.4.2) catalyzes the decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate, releasing CO2, followed by the reductive succinylation of the dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase component (hE2o, EC 2.3.1.6), which has a single lipoyl domain, carrying a covalently amidated lipoic acid as a redox cofactor. The reductive succinylation reaction of hE2o by hE1o is followed by trans-thiol esterification of the succinyl group onto CoA in the active centers of hE2o, generating succinyl-CoA. The dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase component (hE3, EC 1.8.1.4), with a tightly but noncovalently bound FAD as cofactor, re-oxidizes dihydrolipoamidated hE2o to commence the next turnover, while concomitantly reducing an equivalent of NAD+ to NADH (10Yeaman S.J.

These observations served as our hypothesis and motivation to establish the loci and strength of interaction in the binary hE1o–hE2o, hE1o–hE3, and hE2o–hE3 subcomplexes. Our principal structural tool was H/D exchange MS (HDX-MS), which the Rutgers' group has already applied (among other studies) to the following.

Taken together, our data reported here suggest that both hE2o and hE3 interact with the same peptides located at the N-terminal region of hE1o, revealing that the N terminus of hE1o is pivotal for mediating assembly of the entire hOGDHc and suggesting a new mode of assembly in the superfamily of 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes. We complement the HDX-MS studies with chemical cross-linking mass spectrometric studies. These cross-linking mass spectrometric studies provide strong evidence for which locus on hE1o interacts with which locus on hE2o and are in agreement with all other results. The ability to produce active, full-length hE1o, hE2o, and hE3 components and to assemble them into functionally active hOGDHc enabled us to evaluate the strength and loci of interaction in the binary hE1o–hE2o, hE1o–hE3, and hE2o–hE3 subcomplexes. Experiments using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) revealed formation of a binary hE1o–hE2o subcomplex (Fig. 1). On measuring heats of interaction of hE1o with hE2o, formation of the binary subcomplex was found to be endothermic (positive peaks in the ITC input, ΔH = 12.1 kcal/mol) and displayed saturation with an estimated Kd of 0.95 ± 0.10 μm (Ka = 1.057 × 106 m−1) for their binding (Fig. 1A). Binding was also accompanied by a large positive entropy change (TΔS = 20.6 kcal/mol). However, a low N value of 0.1999 ± 0.0069 was estimated from the fit of the experimental data. The reduction in N value is likely due to self-assembly of the hE2o subunits to form a 24-meric cube core as in hOGDHc or even larger E2o assemblies. Thus, although the ITC experiment suggests strong interaction between the hE1o and hE2o, this method could not provide an accurate assessment of the stoichiometry of their binding. Formation of the hE1o–hE2o subcomplex was also suggested by a 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC NMR experiment using uniformly 15N-labeled hE1o as shown in Fig. S1. The superimposed 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled hEo in the absence and in the presence of hE2o revealed multiple differences in the spectrum of 15N-labeled hE1o on interaction with hE2o. While at this level of analysis (no sequence-specific assignments were made on these large enzymes with mass of >200,000 Da for the hE1o homodimer and hE2o oligomer of >45,000 Da per subunit), these NMR results do not provide information about the loci of interaction, but they do support the presence of interaction in the binary hE1o–hE2o subcomplex. In contrast, the hE3, which is shared by all members of the 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex family in a mammalian cell, forms unstable binary subcomplexes with hE1o and hE2o according to SEC experiments, where each protein in the preformed binary hE1o–hE3 and hE2o–hE3 subcomplex was eluted as an individual peak (Fig. S2). A similar conclusion could also be drawn from ITC titration experiments where hE1o or hE2o were titrated by hE3 (Fig. S3). The titration plots did not exhibit saturation (Fig. S3), more probably due to a weak and transient binding between components (34Byron O. Lindsay J.G. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and related assemblies in health and disease.Subcell. Biochem. 2017; 83 (28271489): 523-55010.1007/978-3-319-46503-6_19Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). According to the accepted OGDHc mechanism, with each turnover, the reduced lipoyl domain (dihydrolipoamide) on hE2o must be re-oxidized by the FAD on hE3 (45Carothers D.J. Pons G. Patel M.S.

The exact stoichiometry of the assembly of the hE1o, hE2o, and hE3 components into hOGDHc is unknown. Earlier it was reported that the isolated E. coli E2o core (octahedral (24-mer)) could bind six E1o dimers (α2) compared with the E. coli E2p (octahedral (24-mer)) that could bind 12 E1p (α2) dimers and six E3 (α2) dimers (14Perham R.N. Swinging arms and swinging domains in multifunctional enzymes: catalytic machines for multistep reactions.Annu. Rev.

On assembly of the hOGDHc from its individual components followed by removal of the excess of hE1o and hE3 by passing their mixture through the analytical column, a molar ratio of the hE1o/hE2o/hE3 subunits of 10.2:13.4:2.7 was estimated from three independent experiments. This subunit composition corresponds to an association of 5.1 hE1o dimers, 4.5 hE2o trimers, and 1.4 hE3 dimers corresponding to an approximate stoichiometry of 3(hE1o)2/3(hE2o)3/1(hE3)2. These data suggest that each (hE2o)3 binds one (hE1o)2, and this stoichiometry is unaffected by the hE3 component (Fig. S4). To help identify the loci of interaction between the hE1o, hE2o, and hE3 components of the hOGDHc, we created truncated versions of the hE2o:hE2o(1–95) (lipoyl domain, LDo, comprising the lipoyl domain and part of the linker region), the hE2o(1–173) di-domain, comprising the LDo, the linker region and part of the hE2o core domain, and the C-terminal hE2o(144–386) core domain, consisting of the hE2o core domain and part of the linker region (see Fig. 2 for domain structure of the hE2o). Two approaches were developed to introduce an external fluorophore site-specifically onto the truncated versions of the hE2o. In the first approach, the lipoamide carrying hE2o proteins, the hE2o(1–95) lipoyl domain, and the hE2o(1–173) di-domain were dansylated (Scheme S1). The lipoamide in both proteins was first reduced to"

Moreover, miR-664-5p inhibited myoblast differentiation by down-regulating myogenic gene expression. In contrast, miR-664-5p inhibitor repressed myoblast proliferation and promoted myoblast differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2896970240,"Waiting time for non-emergency medical care in developing countries is rarely of immediate concern to policy makers that prioritize provision of basic health services. However, waiting time as a measure of health system responsiveness is important because longer waiting times worsen health outcomes and affect utilization of services. Studies that assess socio-economic inequalities in waiting time provide evidence from developed countries such as England and the United States; evidence from developing countries is lacking. In this paper, we assess the relationship between social class i.e. caste of an individual and waiting time at health facilities-a client orientation dimension of responsiveness. We use household level data from two rounds of the Indian Human Development Survey with a sample size of 27,251 households in each wave (2005 and 2012) and find that lower social class is associated with higher waiting time. This relationship is significant for individuals that visited a male provider but not so for those that visited a female provider. Further, caste is positively related to higher waiting time only if visiting a private facility; for individuals visiting a government facility the relationship between waiting time and caste is not significant. In general, caste related inequality in waiting time has worsened over time. The results are robust to different specifications and the inclusion of several confounders."

The present study was designed to investigate the associations between nitrogen utilisation efficiency (NUtE) and the allelic composition of the NAM genes in Australian wheat cultivars. As results, the non-functional NAM-B1 allele was more responsive to the nitrogen levels and increased NUtE significantly, leading to a higher grain yield but reduced grain protein content. Nitrogen application at different developmental stages (mid-tillering, booting, and flowering) did not show significant differences in grain yield and protein content. The NAM-A1 allelic variation is significantly associated with the length of the grain-filling period. While the NAM-A1 allele a was associated with a short to moderate grain-filling phase, the alleles c and d were related to moderate to long grain-filling phase. Thus, selection of appropriate combinations of NAM gene alleles can fine-tune the duration of growth phases affecting sink-source relationships which offers an opportunity to develop high NUtE cultivars for target environments."
https://openalex.org/W2624634633,"A method for automatically quantifying emphysema regions using High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) scans of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that does not require manually annotated scans for training is presented.HRCT scans of controls and of COPD patients with diverse disease severity are acquired at two different centers. Textural features from co-occurrence matrices and Gaussian filter banks are used to characterize the lung parenchyma in the scans. Two robust versions of multiple instance learning (MIL) classifiers that can handle weakly labeled data, miSVM and MILES, are investigated. Weak labels give information relative to the emphysema without indicating the location of the lesions. The classifiers are trained with the weak labels extracted from the forced expiratory volume in one minute (FEV1) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO). At test time, the classifiers output a patient label indicating overall COPD diagnosis and local labels indicating the presence of emphysema. The classifier performance is compared with manual annotations made by two radiologists, a classical density based method, and pulmonary function tests (PFTs).The miSVM classifier performed better than MILES on both patient and emphysema classification. The classifier has a stronger correlation with PFT than the density based method, the percentage of emphysema in the intersection of annotations from both radiologists, and the percentage of emphysema annotated by one of the radiologists. The correlation between the classifier and the PFT is only outperformed by the second radiologist.The presented method uses MIL classifiers to automatically identify emphysema regions in HRCT scans. Furthermore, this approach has been demonstrated to correlate better with DLCO than a classical density based method or a radiologist, which is known to be affected in emphysema. Therefore, it is relevant to facilitate assessment of emphysema and to reduce inter-observer variability."
https://openalex.org/W2896606547,"Circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) of various described phenotypes participate in the regeneration of the damaged endothelium, but the abundance of these cells is highly influenced by external cues including diabetes. It is not entirely clear which CAC populations are most reflective of endothelial function nor which are impacted by diabetes. To answer these questions, we enrolled a human cohort with variable CVD risk and determined relationships between stratified levels of CACs and indices of diabetes and vascular function. We also determined associations between CAC functional markers and diabetes and identified pro-angiogenic molecules which are impacted by diabetes. We found that subjects with low levels of CD34+/AC133+/CD31+/CD45dim cells (CAC-3) had a significantly higher incidence of diabetes (p = 0.004), higher HbA1c levels (p = 0.049) and higher CVD risk scores. Furthermore, there was an association between low CAC-3 levels and impaired vascular function (p = 0.023). These cells from diabetics had reduced levels of CXCR4 and VEGFR2, while diabetics had higher levels of certain cytokines and pro-angiogenic molecules. These results suggest that quantitative and functional defects of CD34+/AC133+/CD31+/CD45dim cells are associated with diabetes and vascular impairment and that this cell type may be a prognostic indicator of CVD and vascular dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2896628440,"Psoriasis is a common skin disease pathogenically driven by TNF and IL-17A-induced epidermal hyperproliferation and inflammatory responses. The ongoing need for new therapeutic agents for psoriasis has highlighted medicinal plants as sources of phytochemicals useful for treating psoriatic disease. Rhodomyrtone, a bioactive phytochemical from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa, has well-established anti-proliferative activities. This study assessed the potential of rhodomyrtone for curtailing TNF/IL-17A-driven inflammation. Stimulating human skin organ cultures with TNF+IL-17A to model the skin inflammation in psoriasis, we found that rhodomyrtone significantly decreased inflammatory gene expression and the expression and secretion of inflammatory proteins, assessed by qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and ELISA assays respectively. RNA-seq analysis of monolayer primary keratinocytes treated with IL-17A/TNF showed that rhodomyrtone inhibited 724/1587 transcripts >2-fold altered by IL-17A/TNF (p<0.01), a number of which were confirmed at the mRNA and protein level. Suggesting that rhodomyrtone acts by modulating MAP kinase and NF-κB signaling pathways, rhodomyrtone inhibited TNF-induced ERK, JNK, p38, and NF-κBp65 phosphorylation. Finally, assessing the in vivo anti-inflammatory potential of rhodomyrtone, we examined its effects on imiquimod-induced skin inflammation in mice, finding rhodomyrtone reversed imiquimod-induced skin hyperplasia and epidermal thickening (p< 0.001). Taken together, these results suggest that rhodomyrtone may be useful in preventing or slowing the progression of inflammatory skin disease."
https://openalex.org/W2951187713,"The process of aging can be characterized by a decline in cognitive performance, which may be accompanied by deterioration in specific structural properties of the brain. In this study we sought to investigate to what extent mindfulness changes over the aging process, and which alterations in brain structure can be associated to aging and concomitant changes in mindfulness. We collected Mindful Attention Awareness Scale questionnaire data to assess trait mindfulness and acquired diffusion-weighted imaging data fitted to the diffusion tensor model (DTI) in a group of 97 middle-aged to elderly participants. Our results showed that trait mindfulness increased with age. In terms of white matter structure our results suggested that there was a general increase of omnidirectional diffusion, which favored radial over axial diffusivity, leading to a decrease in fractional anisotropy (FA) in older participants. We further showed that trait mindfulness mediated the FA-age effect in a localized area consisting of the internal and external capsule, as well as the corona radiata. The implication of this mediation analysis is that trait mindfulness may deter age-associated neurocognitive decline, perhaps by preventing age-associated microlesions specifically in cortico-subcortical white matter tracts. This study can be considered a pioneer of using DTI studies to investigate the relationship between age and trait mindfulness."

Lymphocyte counts were determined in blood drawn on the day before surgery and at postoperative days 1, 3 and 7. POP diagnosis was based on clinical, biological and radiological data. A logistic regression model adjusted on currently described risk factors for POP was used to explain the onset of this condition.Two hundred patients were included, of whom 43 (21.5%) developed POP. Preoperative lymphocyte count was 1.8±0.6x10(9) cells/L and 2.0±0.7x10(9) cells/L in patients with and without POP, respectively (P = .091). In both groups, the lymphocyte count nadir occurred at postoperative day 1. In multivariate analysis, lymphopenia at postoperative day 1 was significantly associated with increased risk of POP (odds ratio: 2.63, 95% CI [1.03-5.40]). POP rate at postoperative day 7 was higher in patients presenting low lymphocyte counts (≤1.19x10(9) cells/L) at postoperative day 1 (P = .003).Our study showed that lymphopenia following lung cancer surgery was maximal at postoperative day 1 and was associated with POP."
https://openalex.org/W2896519292,"The 6-minute walking test (6MWT) is a simple assessment tool to evaluate exercise capacity. The result of the test is the distance that a subject can walk at a constant and normal pace within 6 minutes (6MWD) and reflects the aerobic/fitness performance related to walking function. Use of 6MWT has been relevant to assess exercise tolerance either in healthy children or in patients with, heart, lung and metabolic diseases. Our aim was to find 6MWT reference values in healthy Italian children. The 6MWT was performed in 5614 children aged 6–11 years recruited from primary Italian schools. Age related reference percentiles of the covered distance were gender-modeled. A linear and quadratic regression model was used to predict 6MWT performance. Males walked longer distances than females, respectively 598.8±83.9 m vs 592.1±77.6 m (p = 0.0016). According to the regression analysis, 6MWD was positively related to age, gender and height, while it was negatively related to body weight [(6MWD = -160.16 + 93.35× age (years) -4.05× age2 (years) +7.34× gender (m) +2.12× weight (kg) −2.50× height (cm)]. Reference values were established for the 6MWT in healthy children. The age related 6MWD percentiles provided a useful tool in the assessment of capacity in 6–11 year children, in fact they may be helpful to evaluate the effect of a given treatment or rehabilitation program and represent a feasible measure as to prevention within the primary school context. It was found a substantial difference from other countries for 6mwd values. In our study, factors such as age, weight and height were relevant for the prediction of 6MWD, similarly to other studies. Therefore, these variables should be taken into account in context of exercise performance."
https://openalex.org/W2896653275,"Multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4/ABCC4) is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. It is associated with multidrug resistance (MDR), which is becoming a growing challenge to the treatment of cancer and infections. In the context of several types of cancer in which MRP4 is overexpressed, MRP4 inhibition manifests striking effects against cancer progression and drug resistance. In this study, we combined ligand-based and structure-based drug design strategy, by searching the SPECS chemical library to find compounds that are most likely to bind to MRP4. Clustering analysis based on a two-dimensional fingerprint was performed to help with visual selection of potential compounds. Cell viability assays with potential inhibitors and the anticancer drug 6-MP were carried out to identify their bioactivity. As a result, 39 compounds were tested and seven of them reached inhibition above 55% with 6-MP. Then compound Cpd23 was discovered to improve HEK293/MRP4 cell sensibility to 6-MP dramatically, and low concentration Cpd23 (5 μM) achieved the equivalent effect of 50 μM MK571. The accumulation of 6-MP was determined by validated high-performance liquid chromatography methods, and pretreatment of the HEK293/MRP4 cells with 50 μM MK571 or Cpd23 resulted in significantly increased accumulation of 6-MP by approximately 1.5 times. This compound was first reported with a novel scaffold compared with previously known MRP4 inhibitors, which is a hopeful molecular tool that can be used for overcoming multidrug resistance research."
https://openalex.org/W2897089003,"Corynespora cassiicola is a destructive plant-pathogenic fungus causing widespread target spot epidemics, including outbreaks on cotton, soybean, and tomato in the southeastern United States. Previous studies revealed that populations from the three hosts are genetically distinct and host specialized. Although variation in aggressiveness to cotton and tomato were observed, no genetic diversity was detected within populations sampled from each of these hosts. We aimed to gain a better understanding of the emerging target spot epidemics by developing microsatellite markers for C. cassiicola to assess genetic variation, population structure, and to infer modes of reproduction and mechanisms of dispersal. Two hundred sixty-five isolates from cotton, soybean, tomato, and other host plants were genotyped with 13 microsatellite markers. Genotypic diversity revealed genetic variation within each of the populations collected from different hosts, with the population from cotton dominated by clonal genotypes and showing the least genetic diversity. In addition, C. cassiicola populations on different host species were genetically distinct and structured based on host species. No association between genetic and geographic distances was identified in the tomato populations, and the association in cotton populations was low. However, significant regional geographic structure was detected in the soybean populations of C. cassiicola. These results further support previous findings of introduced host specialized isolates or the evolution of more aggressive strains on each host. The lack of geographic structure suggests that the clones on cotton and tomato spread rapidly, or similar founder populations were established by human-mediated dispersal, and that dispersal is not limited. However, regional geographic structure of populations on soybean suggests limited dispersal among more established populations of C. cassiicola, or genetic differences in founder populations that colonized different geographic areas."

The link with other cardio-metabolic risk factors in pregnant women is poorly understood. Our aim was to study the association of SHBG levels with common cardio-metabolic risk parameters in pregnant woman. Serum SHBG was quantified in 291 Caucasian pregnant women (142 with normal weight, 42 with pregestational obesity, 50 with gestational obesity and 57 with pregestational plus gestational obesity) with uncomplicated pregnancies and parturition. Cardio-metabolic [C-reactive protein (CRP), blood pressure (BP), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAc1), glucose, C-peptide, insulin, triglycerides and high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin], and endocrine [testosterone and estradiol] parameters were also assessed. SHBG was negatively correlated with BMI, but also with CRP, BP, HbAc1, pre and post-load glucose, C-peptide, HOMA-IR, triglycerides; and positively with HMW adiponectin (all p<0.01 to p<0.0001). These associations were more robust in women with pregestational plus gestational obesity, who had lower SHBG, in comparison to normal-weight women (p<0.0001). In multivariate analyses in women with pregestational plus gestational obesity SHBG showed independent associations with CRP (β = −0.352, p = 0.03, R2 = 8.0%), DBP (β = −0.353, p = 0.03, R2 = 7.0%) and SBP (β = −0.333, p = 0.04, R2 = 6.0%) independently of BMI and metabolic and endocrine parameters. SHBG is decreased in pregnant women with pregestational plus gestational obesity in association with common cardio-metabolic parameters. SHBG could represent an integrating biomarker for an adverse cardio-metabolic profile in pregnant women with pregestational plus gestational obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2896769205,"Purpose To determine whether ocular motor cranial nerve (CN) palsy raises the risk of subsequent stroke in the general population. Methods We investigated the association between ocular motor CN palsy and occurrence of stroke using the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort database from 2002 to 2013. We included individuals aged ≥ 20 years on January 1st, 2004, and excluded those having any paralytic strabismus, disorders in binocular movement, diplopia and any cerebrovascular diseases before entering the cohort. Incident ocular motor CN palsy was identified by diagnostic codes for third, fourth, and sixth nerve palsies. To determine the effect of incident ocular motor CN palsy on the occurrence of subsequent stroke, we used time-varying covariate Cox regression models. Model 1 included only incident third, fourth, and sixth nerve palsies as a time-varying covariate. Model 2 included Model 1 and defined demographic information. Model 3 included Model 2, comorbidity, co-medication, and the Charlson index score. Results Among 727,689 individuals in the cohort, 1,633 patients developed ocular motor CN palsy and 17,657 patients suffered stroke. Cox regression models showed that development of ocular motor CN palsy was associated with an increased risk of subsequent stroke (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.65; 95% confidence intervals [CIs], 3.74–5.80 in Model 1), and the results were consistent even after adjusting for demographic factors and confounders in Model 2 and 3. Men, older age, and individuals not living in Seoul/Incheon area were associated with an increased risk of stroke, while individuals with higher income were associated with decreased risk of stroke in both Model 2 and 3. Sensitivity analyses using propensity score-based matching produced similar results in all three Models (HR = 1.95; 95% CI, 1.55–2.46 in Model 1, HR = 1.91; 95% CI, 1.52–2.41 in Model 2, and HR = 1.63; 95% CI, 1.29–2.06 in Model 3). Conclusions The occurrence of ocular motor CN palsy is a significant risk factor of subsequent stroke even after adjusting for demographic factors and confounders in the general population. Physicians may need to educate patients with ocular motor CN palsy regarding the higher risk of future stroke."

However, it is unclear whether the CBF response to normal physiological challenges and regulation is similarly dysfunctional. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the CBF velocity response to orthostatic stress (i.e., sit-to-stand maneuver) and increased fractional concentration of carbon dioxide. 23 cases of GWI (GWI+) and 9 controls (GWI) volunteered for this study. Primary variables of interest included an index of dynamic autoregulation and cerebrovascular reactivity. Dynamic autoregulation was significantly lower in GWI+ than GWI- both for autoregulatory index (2.99±1.5 vs 4.50±1.5, p = 0.017). In addition, we observed greater decreases in CBF velocity both at the nadir after standing (-18.5±6.0 vs -9.8±4.9%, p = 0.001) and during steady state standing (-5.7±7.1 vs -1.8±3.2%, p = 0.042). In contrast, cerebrovascular reactivity was not different between groups. In our sample of Veterans with GWI, dynamic autoregulation was impaired and consistent with greater cerebral hypoperfusion when standing. This reduced CBF may contribute to cognitive difficulties in these Veterans when upright."

Finger millet is a food security crop proven to have resilience to changing climate and scores very high in nutrition. In the current study, we have assessed sixteen candidate reference genes for their appropriateness for the normalization studies in finger millet subjected to experimental regimes and treatments. Ten candidate reference genes (GAPDH, β-TUB, CYP, EIF4α, TIP41, UBC, G6PD, S24, MACP and MDH) were cloned and six (ACT, ELF1α, PP2A, PT, S21 and TFIID) were mined from the NCBI database as well as from the literature. Expression stability ranking of the finger millet reference genes was validated using four different statistical tools i.e., geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, ΔCt and RefFinder. From the study, we endorse MACP, CYP, EIF4α to be most stable candidate reference genes in all ‘tissues’, whereas PT, TFIID, MACP ranked high across genotypes, β-TUB, CYP, ELF1α were found to be best under abiotic stresses and ‘all samples set’. The study recommends using minimum of two reference genes for RT-qPCR data normalizations in finger millet. All in all, CYP, β-TUB, and EF1α, in combination were found to be best for robust normalizations under most experimental conditions. The best and the least stable genes were validated for confirmation by assessing their appropriateness for normalization studies using EcNAC1 gene. The report provides the first comprehensive list of suitable stable candidate reference genes for nutritional rich cereal finger millet that will be advantageous to gene expression studies in this crop."
https://openalex.org/W2897766845,"RNA stem loop structures have been frequently shown to regulate essential cellular processes. The selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element, found in the 3′ UTRs of all selenoprotein mRNAs, is an example of such a structure, as it is required for the incorporation of the 21st amino acid, selenocysteine (Sec). Selenoprotein synthesis poses a mechanistic challenge because Sec is incorporated during translation in response to a stop codon (UGA). Although it is known that a SECIS-binding protein (SBP2) is required for Sec insertion, the mechanism of action remains elusive. Additional complexity is present in the synthesis of selenoprotein P (SELENOP), which is the only selenoprotein that contains multiple UGA codons and possesses two SECIS elements in its 3′ UTR. Thus, full-length SELENOP synthesis requires processive Sec incorporation. Using zebrafish Selenop, in vitro translation assays, and 75Se labeling in HEK293 cells, we found here that processive Sec incorporation is an intrinsic property of the SECIS elements. Specifically, we identified critical features of SECIS elements that are required for processive Sec incorporation. A screen of the human SECIS elements revealed that most of these elements support processive Sec incorporation in vitro; however, we also found that the processivity of Sec incorporation into Selenop in cells is tightly regulated.

Although the interactions between various SECIS elements and SBP2 have been probed, the exact mechanism by which SECIS specifies recoding of an UGA codon for selenocysteine insertion remains elusive. Deeper mechanistic questions arise in the case of SELENOP, which is the only selenoprotein with multiple selenocysteine codons in its primary coding sequence (10–17 depending on the species) and two SECIS elements in its 3′ UTR. Early on, it was speculated that two SECIS elements may be required to recode multiple UGA codons. However, further analysis of the SELENOP 3′ UTR showed that deletion of SECIS-1 resulted in complete loss of processive Sec incorporation in favor of early termination at the second UGA, whereas deletion of SECIS-2 had little or no impact on SELENOP production (18Shetty S.P.

A similar study in mice showed the same result in terms of processivity, but overall production of SELENOP was reduced for the SECIS-2 deletion (20Wu S. Mariotti M. Santesmasses D. Hill K.E.

Given that both SELENOP SECIS elements contain the conserved core motifs and are capable of Sec incorporation, we sought to determine which features within a SECIS element are required for processive Sec incorporation. We found that, although the conserved SECIS core motifs are essential, they are not sufficient for multiple UGA codon redefinitions. We observed that a nonconserved portion of the upper stem and the apical loop of SECIS-1 is essential for processive Sec incorporation. Additionally, our screening of all human SECIS elements revealed four distinct classes of processivity functions. We also observed that [Mg2+] simulates processivity of SECIS elements in vitro. To determine the functions of SECIS-1 and SECIS-2 in isolation, we cloned the 119-nt region corresponding to each SECIS element behind the full-length zebrafish Selenop coding region (Fig. 2A). We used the zebrafish version of Selenop because it contains 17 Sec codons and is thus ideally suited for 75Se labeling in processivity studies (21Tujebajeva R.M. Ransom D.G. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. Expression and characterization of nonmammalian selenoprotein P in the zebrafish, Danio rerio.Genes Cells. 2000; 5 (11122377): 897-90310.1046/j.1365-2443.2000.00375.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Kryukov G.V.

For analysis, we employed both in vitro translation assays and transfection into human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293). For in vitro translation, capped mRNAs encoding the SELENOP constructs (Fig. 2A) were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [75Se]selenite (Fig. 2B). For expression in cells, SELENOP complementary DNAs were transfected into HEK293 cells, and SELENOP, which is secreted into the medium, was monitored using [75Se]selenite labeling. As shown in Fig. 2B, both the full-length 3′ UTR and SECIS-1 alone yielded robust expression of the full-length product at ∼40 kDa both in vitro and in cells. However, SECIS-2 alone produced a product that corresponded to termination at the second codon, indicating a complete lack of processive Sec incorporation. Because the first UGA codon has been implicated previously in negatively regulating processivity (19Stoytcheva Z. Tujebajeva R.M. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. Efficient incorporation of multiple selenocysteines involves an inefficient decoding step serving as a potential translational checkpoint and ribosome bottleneck.Mol. Cell.

Interestingly, the U59C mutant showed a subtle increase in processivity but was unable to reach the efficiency or level of processivity observed with the full-length 3′ UTR or SECIS-1 alone, both in in vitro translation and in cultured cells. These results indicate that SECIS-1 is uniquely capable of processive Sec incorporation. To identify the determinants of processive Sec incorporation within SECIS-1, we swapped sections of SECIS-1 and SECIS-2 to identify a sequence that is both necessary and sufficient to support processivity. As illustrated in Fig. 1, we divided SECIS into four domains: lower stem, central core, upper stem, and apical loop. To test for sequences that were necessary for processivity, we substituted regions of SECIS-1 for those in SECIS-2, as shown in Fig. 3A. As above, in vitro transcribed capped mRNAs were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [75Se]selenite. Replacement of either the upper stem or apical loop of SECIS-1 resulted in complete loss of processivity (Fig. 3A, lanes 6 and 7). To test for sufficiency, we similarly created four SECIS-2 mutants, as shown in Fig. 3B, and placed each of the SECIS-1 sections into a SECIS-2 background. In this case, we were unable to restore processivity with any of the SECIS-1 sections alone. To test the combined action of the SECIS-1 upper stem and apical loop, we created a chimera that contained the lower half of SECIS-2 and the upper half of SECIS-1. Here we observed that processivity was restored to some extent in vitro and fully in transfected cells (Fig. 3C). For all mutant SECIS elements, we used the publicly available computational method (SECISSearch3) for identification of SECIS elements to ensure that they folded into predicted SECIS structures (17Mariotti M. Lobanov A.V. Guigo R. Gladyshev V.N. SECISearch3 and Seblastian: new tools for prediction of SECIS elements and selenoproteins.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 (23783574): e14910.1093/nar/gkt550Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The results show that the upper stem and apical loop of SECIS-1 are necessary and sufficient for processive Sec incorporation both in vitro and in live cells. Considering that both the upper stem and apical loop are required for optimal processivity, to identify a requirement for specific sequences, we generated two mutations where these regions converge in the “neck” of SECIS-1. As shown in Fig. 4A, we created a mutation that altered the six bases at the top of the upper stem as well as the 3′ base of the upper loop. This resulted in changing a G-rich region to an AU-rich region. We also changed an adenosine in the A30-G47 non-Watson–Crick base pair in the upper stem, creating a C-G pair. Both in vitro translation and expression in HEK293 cells, as described earlier, demonstrate that the larger G-rich region is essential for SECIS-1 function in processivity but does not affect overall Sec incorporation activity because the termination product at the second UGA is still detectable, albeit to a lesser extent in cells (Fig. 4B). The overlapping A30C mutation, however, had no impact on processive Sec incorporation. These results allow us to map this novel function for SECIS elements in promoting processive Sec incorporation to the neck region of SELENOP SECIS-1. Because human cells are readily able to make full-length zebrafish Selenop, we reasoned that human SECIS elements would also be able to drive processive Sec incorporation in fish Selenop. Therefore, we tested each of the 26 known human SECIS elements by appending them to the zebrafish Selenop coding sequence. Each of these constructs were tested in vitro and in transfected cells (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively). Both experimental conditions revealed four distinct classes of SECIS element function: “full” processivity (similar to the WT; Fig. 5B, lanes 1 and 2); intermediate processivity (about 50% termination and 50% processivity); no processivity (only production of product terminated at the second UGA); and no Sec incorporation at all. Strikingly, most SECIS elements are processive in vitro, whereas in cells, processivity is restricted to selective SECIS elements. For instance Gpx4, TR1, Gpx6, SPS2, SELENOV, and SELENOM show intermediate processivity in vitro, whereas they are nonprocessive in cells. To ensure that the failure to produce any product in the cells was not to due to differential RNA stability, we performed qRT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 5C, the RNA levels of these constructs were similar to or higher than that of the WT construct. These results suggest that processivity is not unique to SELENOP SECIS elements and is more common than expected; however, in cells, this process is more tightly regulated. Prior studies have confirmed that RNAs containing the K-turn motif are polymorphic and exist in an equilibrium between the strongly kinked conformation and the less-kinked bulge-like structure (23Goody T.A. Melcher S.E. Norman D.G. Lilley D.M. The kink-turn motif in RNA is dimorphic, and metal ion-dependent.RNA. 2004; 10 (14730024): 254-26410.1261/rna.5176604Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Depending on the binding of the metal ions, the equilibrium becomes more biased to the highly kinked conformation. To analyze whether the ability of the SECIS to drive processivity is affected by the conformation of the K-turn in the SECIS elements, we selectively tested five SECIS elements for their ability to drive processive Sec incorporation when supplemented with increasing [Mg2+] concentrations: human SECIS-1 (HSECIS-1), HSECIS2, HDio2 ZSECIS-1, and ZSECIS-2. To determine whether we could restore dominant processivity to either completely nonprocessive (ZSECIS-2 or HSECIS-2) or partially processive (HDio2) SECIS elements, we preincubated in vitro transcribed capped mRNA constructs in the presence of a range of [Mg2+] prior to translation. For this purpose, we used the Flexi rabbit reticulocyte lysate (nuclease-treated) because this lysate has a known concentration of magnesium and monitored ZSelenop synthesis in the presence of [75Se]selenite. We found that [Mg2+]concentration influences the processivity of SECIS elements. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, full-length ZSelenop production was not affected by [Mg2+] concentration when driven by the WT full-length 3′ UTR or ZSECIS1. In contrast, there was a positive correlation between increasing [Mg2+] and the amount of full-length ZSelenop produced for the HSECIS1. Similarly, HDio2 showed increased processivity at higher [Mg2+] (Fig. 6D). Surprisingly, completely nonprocessive ZSECIS2 yielded a small amount of full-length ZSelenop at 1.5–2.0 mm [Mg2+] even though ZSECIS2 alone has not been reported previously to show processive Sec incorporation (Fig. 6E). On the other hand, HSECIS2 was resistant to processivity at any [Mg2+] concentration tested. We also observed that increasing [Mg2+] concentration not only increased processivity but also increased the efficiency of Sec incorporation at the first UGA. To test whether this result was due to an increase in overall canonical translation, we analyzed WT luciferase with increasing [Mg2+]. We found an overall increase in canonical protein synthesis; however, the WT zebrafish 3′ UTR, HSECIS1, and HDio2 showed statistically significant increases above canonical translation at 2.0 mm and 2.5 mm Mg2+ (Fig. S2). Together, these results suggest that the structural conformations of the SECIS elements play a critical role in determining processivity for SECIS elements in vitro. However, currently, because of inadequate structural studies of SECIS elements, we were unable to identify any structural commonalities between the SECIS elements of the four categories identified in Fig. 5. SECIS elements have been shown to regulate Sec incorporation both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Although SECIS elements in prokaryotes are located immediately downstream of the UGA codon in the coding region, SECIS elements in eukaryotes are more defined and are found in the 3′ UTR (24Grundner-Culemann E. Martin 3rd, G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J.

Several factors influence the efficiency of Sec incorporation by SECIS, such as the UGA codon position, distance between the UGA and the SECIS core, the SECIS type, the upper stem length and apical loop size in SECIS, and, as discovered very recently, the coding region sequence (25Berry M.J.

However, the influence of SECIS elements on processive Sec incorporation has never been investigated. Several attempts to identify determinants of processive Sec incorporation have been unsuccessful (18Shetty S.P. Shah R. Copeland P.R.

In this study, we focus on SELENOP SECIS elements 1 and 2 and analyze their differences in driving processive Sec incorporation. Earlier studies by Stoytcheva et al. (19Stoytcheva Z. Tujebajeva R.M. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. Efficient incorporation of multiple selenocysteines involves an inefficient decoding step serving as a potential translational checkpoint and ribosome bottleneck.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26 (17000762): 9177-918410.1128/MCB.00856-06Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) proposed that Sec incorporation at the first UGA codon is selectively performed by SECIS-2. However, we found that, in our in vitro studies (18Shetty S.P. Shah R. Copeland P.R. Regulation of selenocysteine incorporation into the selenium transport protein, Selenoprotein P.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 (25063811): 25317-2532610.1074/jbc.M114.590430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), SECIS-1 was sufficient to yield a full-length product, whereas SECIS-2 was only capable of Sec incorporation at the first UGA. As shown in Fig. 1, both SELENOP SECIS elements possess identical conserved features known to be required for Sec incorporation; one drives processive Sec incorporation and the other does not. In the WT SELENOP 3′ UTR, SECIS-2 is located an additional >300 nt downstream of SECIS-1 (Fig. 2A). To test whether the distance between UGA codons and the SECIS core is a determinant of processivity (38Martin 3rd, G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. Selenocysteine incorporation in eukaryotes: insights into mechanism and efficiency from sequence, structure, and spacing proximity studies of the type 1 deiodinase SECIS element.RNA. 1996; 2 (8601283): 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we created SECIS-1 alone and SECIS-2 alone mutants (Fig. 2A) in which the distance between the last UGA and the SECIS core was 77 nt. The optimal spacing recommended between the last UGA and the SECIS core for efficiency is >50 nt (38Martin 3rd, G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. Selenocysteine incorporation in eukaryotes: insights into mechanism and efficiency from sequence, structure, and spacing proximity studies of the type 1 deiodinase SECIS element.RNA. 1996; 2 (8601283): 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, SECIS-2 alone still caused termination at the second UGA, suggesting that distance was not a determinant. Interestingly, the SECIS-2 U59C mutant showed a subtle stimulation of processivity but still did not yield a full-length protein. On the other hand, the SECIS-1 alone mutant produced a full-length protein similar in efficiency to the WT 3′ UTR but also produced some intermediate products that correspond to termination between the second UGA and the last (17th) UGA. The detection of early termination products by SECIS-1 alone supports earlier studies indicating that although SECIS-2 is not essential for Sec incorporation, it primarily affects decoding efficiency at the first UGA codon (19Stoytcheva Z. Tujebajeva R.M. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. Efficient incorporation of multiple selenocysteines involves an inefficient decoding step serving as a potential translational checkpoint and ribosome bottleneck.Mol. Cell.

Multiple RNA structures affect translation initiation and UGA redefinition efficiency during synthesis of selenoprotein P.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (29069514): 13004-1301510.1093/nar/gkx982Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The first UGA has been shown to be the rate-limiting step in selenoprotein translation, and recent ribosome profiling of SELENOP mRNA clearly identified pausing at the first UGA (39Mariotti M. Shetty S. Baird L. Wu S. Loughran G. Copeland P.R. Atkins J.F. Howard M.T. Multiple RNA structures affect translation initiation and UGA redefinition efficiency during synthesis of selenoprotein P.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (29069514): 13004-1301510.1093/nar/gkx982Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, slow decoding at the first UGA by SECIS-2 may be essential to ensure full-length protein synthesis. Upon deeper analysis for the determinants of processivity, we found that the upper stem and the apical loop of SECIS-1 are unique for processivity. In fact, this region was sufficient to make SECIS-2 processive, although at lower efficiency in vitro. Surprisingly, in cultured cells, the SECIS-2 chimera was not only efficient but, like the SECIS-1 alone mutant, produced both full-length protein and early termination products. This suggests that although the upper stem and apical loop of SECIS-1 are critical for processivity, their SECIS-2 counterparts probably regulate decoding efficiency at the first UGA. In prior studies, sequence analysis of various SECIS elements revealed that the upper stem length is typically restrained to 9–11 bp, or approximately one helical turn of an RNA helix (24Grundner-Culemann E. Martin 3rd, G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. Two distinct SECIS structures capable of directing selenocysteine incorporation in eukaryotes.RNA. 1999; 5 (10334333): 625-63510.1017/S1355838299981542Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that the optimal upper stem length may serve to juxtapose the conserved motifs in the SECIS core and the adenosine triad in the apical loop in the kink-turn SECIS (24Grundner-Culemann E. Martin 3rd, G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. Two distinct SECIS structures capable of directing selenocysteine incorporation in eukaryotes.RNA. 1999; 5 (10334333): 625-63510.1017/S1355838299981542Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The reported apical loop size range is typically 10–14 nt (24Grundner-Culemann E. Martin 3rd, G.W. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. Two distinct SECIS structures capable of directing selenocysteine incorporation in eukaryotes.RNA. 1999; 5 (10334333): 625-63510.1017/S1355838299981542Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In ZSelenop, both SECIS elements constitute a similar upper stem length and apical loop size, which are in the expected range; this fails to explain their difference in function. Sequence analysis of SELENOP SECIS-1 elements among vertebrates revealed a conserved G-rich motif at the junction of the SECIS-1 upper stem and apical loop, which, in this study, seems crucial for processive Sec incorporation. It does not impact single Sec incorporation. Therefore, it is likely that single Sec incorporation and processive Sec incorporation may occur as independent events. We also speculated that the predicted non-Watson–Crick bp in the SECIS-1 upper stem (AG) may exist as an extra helical base and be important for processive Sec incorporation. Surprisingly, the AG→CG mutant had no effect on processivity. Our screen of the human SECIS library revealed that most SECIS elements were capable of at least partial processive Sec incorporation in vitro. What we did not expect was the lack of primary sequence similarity among the processive human SECIS elements (not even the G-rich motif) other than the already known core motifs among processive SECIS elements. This suggests either a role for RNA secondary structure in regulating processivity or differences in interactions with SECIS binding proteins. Our results imply a role for magnesium in regulating processivity. Magnesium is known to influence K-turn motifs into highly kinked conformation. This may mediate tertiary interactions within the RNA that may either allow or stabilize binding of specific factors in vitro. This correlates well with the lack of sequence conservation between processive SECIS elements outside of the core-binding motif (40Huang L. Lilley D.M.J. The kink turn, a key architectural element in RNA structure.J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428 (26522935): 790-80110.1016/j.jmb.2015.09.026Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Biochemical probing of SECIS elements alone (human and rat DIO1 and rat Gpx1) as well as chemical probing of SBP2 in complex with different SECIS elements (rat Gpx1, HuSELENON, rat 5′DIO1, rat Gpx4, rat SELENOP, and mouse SELENOF) show similar cleavage patterns in the SECIS core region. However, clear discrepancies can be seen in the upper stem even though they are all predicted to exist in a double helix (9Walczak R. Westhof E. Carbon P. Krol A.

It is therefore possible that although SBP2 interaction with the core motif and lower stem is constant among all SECIS elements, interactions with additional SECIS binding proteins with the upper stem and apical loop may dictate processivity. Together, we propose that although processive Sec incorporation can be driven by magnesium concentration in vitro, the mechanism may be different in cells. In cells, SECIS elements differentially drive processive Sec incorporation, which likely depends on the assembly of unique ribonucleoprotein complexes besides SBP2. SECIS elements have long been found essential for Sec incorporation. However, the exact mechanism by which they interact with the rest of the factors is poorly understood. This study provides new insight into regions within the SECIS element that is required for processive Sec incorporation and the influence of magnesium on SECIS function. Thus, it serves as a foundation for future research exploring the differential decoding efficiency and processivity of SECIS elements, which we speculate occurs by recruiting additional RNP complexes besides SBP2."
https://openalex.org/W2950718555,"Several recent studies indicate that small Open Reading Frames (sORFs) embedded within multiple eukaryotic non-coding RNAs can be translated into bioactive peptides of up to 100 amino acids in size. However, the functional roles of the 607 Stress Induced Peptides (SIPs) previously identified from 189 Transcriptionally Active Regions (TARs) in Arabidopsis thaliana remain unclear. To provide a starting point for functional annotation of these plant-derived peptides, we performed a large-scale prediction of peptide binding sites on protein surfaces using coarse-grained peptide docking. The docked models were subjected to further atomistic refinement and binding energy calculations. A total of 530 peptide-protein pairs were successfully docked. In cases where a peptide encoded by a TAR is predicted to bind at a known ligand or cofactor-binding site within the protein, it can be assumed that the peptide modulates the ligand or cofactor-binding. Moreover, we predict that several peptides bind at protein-protein interfaces, which could therefore regulate the formation of the respective complexes. Protein-peptide binding analysis further revealed that peptides employ both their backbone and side chain atoms when binding to the protein, forming predominantly hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. In this study, we have generated novel predictions on the potential protein-peptide interactions in A. thaliana, which will help in further experimental validation."

Data analysis was similar in both studies. We conducted multi-group confirmatory factor analyses and applied the scaled difference chi-square statistic to examine whether discrepancies in successive constrained models were significant. We observed configural equivalence between the two time frames. Furthermore, we observed metric equivalence but not scalar invariance between the different circumstances of measurement. The findings highlight the need for studies of equivalence before using a single self-report with more than one set of instructions, or under diverse circumstances. Invariance of mood scores should be examined and taken into account when interpreting individual and group mood state assessments."
https://openalex.org/W2897724931,"The white color in the larval integument of the silkworm Bombyx mori is considered the result of uric acid accumulation in its epidermal cells. Larvae of the eri silkworm Samia ricini (Lepidoptera; Saturniidae) also have a white and opaque integument, but little is known about its coloration mechanism. In this study, we first performed a feeding assay of S. ricini larvae using allopurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, which catalyzes the degradation of xanthine to uric acid. This treatment induced a clear translucent integument phenotype, indicating that the larval color of S. ricini is also determined by uric acid accumulation. Next, to investigate the genetic basis that controls uric acid accumulation in S. ricini larvae, we isolated and characterized the S. ricini homolog of mammalian biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1, subunit 2 (BLOS2), which is known to play a crucial role in urate granule biosynthesis. We created a transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated gene knockout of S. ricini BLOS2 (SrBLOS2) and succeeded in establishing SrBLOS2 knockout strains (SrBLOS2KO). SrBLOS2KO mutants exhibited a translucent larval integument phenotype and lacked uric acid in the epidermis, as also observed in allopurinol-fed larvae. In addition, electron microscopy revealed that urate granules were rarely observed in the epidermis of SrBLOS2KO larvae, whereas abundant granules were found in the epidermis of wild-type larvae. These results clearly demonstrated that larval S. ricini accumulates uric acid as urate granules in the epidermis and that the genetic basis that controls uric acid accumulation is evolutionarily conserved in S. ricini and B. mori."

Recent studies have reported that the unfolded protein response (UPR), a system to clear unfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), also participates in the activation of cellular defense mechanisms in response to bacterial infection. However, no study has yet investigated the role of UPR in C. jejuni infection. Hence, the aim of this study was to deduce the role of UPR signaling via induction of ER stress in the process of C. jejuni infection. The results suggest that C. jejuni infection suppresses global protein translation. Also, 12 h of C. jejuni infection induced activation of the eIF2α pathway and expression of the transcription factor CHOP. Interestingly, bacterial invasion was facilitated by knockdown of UPR-associated signaling factors and treatment with the ER stress inducers, thapsigargin and tunicamycin, decreased the invasive ability of C. jejuni. An investigation into the mechanism of UPR-mediated inhibition of C. jejuni invasion showed that UPR signaling did not affect bacterial adhesion to or survival in the host cells. Further, Salmonella Enteritidis or FITC-dextran intake were not regulated by UPR signaling. These results indicated that the effect of UPR on intracellular intake was specifically found in C. jejuni infection. These findings are the first to describe the role of UPR in C. jejuni infection and revealed the participation of a new signaling pathway in C. jejuni invasion. UPR signaling is involved in defense against the early step of C. jejuni invasion and thus presents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of C. jejuni infection."

Whereas the genetic composition of a microbe represents an organism's biological potential, the proteins expressed provide a functional readout of the organism's response to the environment. Understanding protein expression patterns in response to specific environmental conditions furthers fundamental knowledge about a microbe, which can be especially useful for understudied organisms such as Clostridium botulinum examined herein. In addition, protein expression patterns that reproducibly occur in certain growth conditions hold potential in fields such as microbial forensics, in which determination of conditions in which an unknown possible biothreat sample had been grown may be important. To investigate the identity and reproducibility of protein profile patterns for varied strains, we defined the proteomic profiles of four Group I strains of Clostridium botulinum, a Category A biothreat agent and the organism responsible for the production of the botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), in two different culture media grown for five days. The four C. botulinum strains produced one of three neurotoxins (BoNT/A, /B, or /F), and their protein profiles were compared to that of a fifth non-toxigenic strain of C. sporogenes. These strains each had DNA sequences available to assist in accurate protein identification. Differing culture growth phase, bacterial strain, and growth medium resulted in reproducible protein profiles, which were used to calculate relative protein abundance ratios as an internally normalized metric of microbial growth in varying conditions. The resulting protein profiles provide functional information about how four Group I C. botulinum strains and a C. sporogenes strain respond to the culture environment during growth and explores the feasibility of using these proteins to characterize unknown samples."

CcrM from the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus (CcrM C. crescentus, methylates adenine at 5′-GANTC-3′) displays 105–107-fold sequence discrimination against noncognate sequences. However, the underlying recognition mechanism is unclear. Here, CcrM C. crescentus activity was either improved or mildly attenuated with substrates having one to three mismatched bp within or adjacent to the recognition site, but only if the strand undergoing methylation is left unchanged. By comparison, single-mismatched substrates resulted in up to 106-fold losses of activity with α (Dam) and γ-class (M.HhaI) DNA methyltransferases. We found that CcrM C. crescentus has a greatly expanded DNA-interaction surface, covering six nucleotides on the 5′ side and eight nucleotides on the 3′ side of its recognition site. Such a large interface may contribute to the enzyme’s high sequence fidelity. CcrM C. crescentus displayed the same sequence discrimination with single-stranded substrates, and a surprisingly large (>107-fold) discrimination against ssRNA was largely due to the presence of two or more riboses within the cognate (DNA) site but not outside the site. Results from C-terminal truncations and point mutants supported our hypothesis that the recently identified C-terminal, 80-residue segment is essential for dsDNA recognition but is not required for single-stranded substrates. CcrM orthologs from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Brucella abortus share some of these newly discovered features of the C. crescentus enzyme, suggesting that the recognition mechanism is conserved.

CcrM Caulobacter crescentus helps to orchestrate the cell cycle–regulated asymmetric cell division in which a single genome gives rise to two distinct and heritable cell types (flagellated swarmer cell and a stalked cell). At the beginning of the cell cycle in the Gram-negative, aquatic bacterium C. crescentus, the chromosome is fully methylated at CcrM sites. Following replication, the two replication forks proceed bidirectionally, generating hemimethylated DNA. CcrM C. crescentus is only expressed near the end of replication and is present for a short 10–20-min window. It is during this period that the 4,515 GANTC sites are rapidly remethylated (2Kozdon J.B. Melfi M.D. Luong K. Clark T.A. Boitano M. Wang S. Zhou B. Gonzalez D. Collier J. Turner S.W. Korlach J.

CcrM C. crescentus (358 amino acids) and some β-class adenine N6-methyltransferases that recognize 5′-GANTC-3′ sites have an unusual C-terminal 80-residue extension of unknown function. We recently reported that CcrM C. crescentus is a functional monomer, with KmDNA (17 nm), kcat (5.2 min−1), kmethylation (0.6–8.0 min−1 depending on the flanking sequence), KdDNA (10–100 nm) values, and the rate-limiting step is either methylation or a step preceding methylation (7Woodcock C.B.

The enzyme shows a 107-fold loss in specificity for an AATTC site versus the cognate GACTC sequence in dsDNA, primarily driven by changes in methylation. This is an unprecedented level of discrimination based on a single-bp change for any DNA methyltransferase by 3–4 orders of magnitude. This may be particularly important for CcrM C. crescentus, because the inappropriate methylation of genomic DNA sequences could disrupt gene regulation (2Kozdon J.B. Melfi M.D. Luong K. Clark T.A.

These findings are poorly accommodated by current models for DNA recognition and, in particular, other DNA methyltransferases (8Cheng X. Roberts R.J.

There are few examples of protein–ssDNA complexes, particularly those involving high levels of sequence-specific binding. By far the best understood example of a protein that binds single-stranded and dsDNA with some level of sequence discrimination is the Pur protein family (DNA replication, transcription), which is conserved from bacteria to humans (11Wortman M.J.

Pur α binds ssDNA and ssRNA with poor, micromolar affinity. Interestingly, Pur α binds dsDNA with similar affinity and has ATP-independent dsDNA destabilizing activity. By binding the purine-rich strand within promoters, it is proposed to create localized melting, making the pyrimidine-rich strand available for binding by other regulatory proteins, thereby acting as a transcriptional activator. The cocrystal structures of Pur α complexed with ssDNA (5′-GCGGCGG-3′) provides the basis for the model that the protein melts the dsDNA (13Graebsch A. Roche S. Niessing D.

Although DNA methyltransferases, some endonucleases, and repair enzymes are well-known to cause a localized disruption of dsDNA by virtue of “flipping” out the target base (8Cheng X. Roberts R.J. AdoMet-dependent methylation, DNA methyltransferases and base flipping.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29 (11557810): 3784-379510.1093/nar/29.18.3784Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 9Cheng X.

Biol. 2014; 6 (25085914)a01874710.1101/cshperspect.a018747Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), this is fundamentally different from the model suggested for Pur α. Based on our findings for CcrM C. crescentus and the recognition model proposed for Pur α, we set out to investigate the underlying recognition mechanism used by CcrM C. crescentus. Our results are inconsistent with CcrM C. crescentus and related enzymes working through the canonical DNA recognition model and support the reliance on a new DNA recognition model. The more than 1,500 structures of protein–DNA complexes now deposited in the Protein Data Bank provide a deep basis for understanding “base readout” and “shape readout” mechanisms, involving diverse protein–DNA interfaces (10Rohs R. Jin X. West S.M. Joshi R. Honig B. Mann R.S. Origins of specificity in protein–DNA recognition.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79 (20334529): 233-26910.1146/annurev-biochem-060408-091030Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). For the vast majority of these complexes, the dsDNA remains largely intact. Interestingly, although DNA methyltransferases rely on a canonical “base flipping” recognition mechanism in which the target base is stabilized in an extrahelical position, they also leave the DNA in its duplex form (8Cheng X. Roberts R.J. AdoMet-dependent methylation, DNA methyltransferases and base flipping.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29 (11557810): 3784-379510.1093/nar/29.18.3784Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 9Cheng X. Structural and functional coordination of DNA and histone methylation.Cold Spring Harbor Perspect. Biol. 2014; 6 (25085914)a01874710.1101/cshperspect.a018747Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, placement of a mismatched bp into the recognition site of a sequence specific DNA-binding protein should disrupt stabilizing recognition interactions because at least one base is “incorrect,” and the mismatch significantly disrupts the sugar-phosphate positioning. In all cases we used hemimethylated DNA to force one productive binding orientation; in the case of CcrM C. crescentus, the hemimethylated DNA is what the enzyme is normally presented with within the cell. We tested this first with M.HhaI, a structurally characterized DNA cytosine methyltransferase (methylates the underlined cytosines in 5′-GCGC-3′/5′-GCGC-3′) (15Estabrook R.A. Nguyen T.T. Fera N. Reich N.O. Coupling sequence-specific recognition to DNA modification.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 (19497854): 22690-2269610.1074/jbc.M109.015966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As is typical for protein–DNA complexes, the M.HhaI-DNA cocrystal structure shows extensive interactions to bases within both strands, as well to the sugar-phosphate backbone of both strands (16Shieh F.K. Youngblood B. Reich N.O. The role of Arg165 towards base flipping, base stabilization and catalysis in M.HhaI.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362 (16926025): 516-52710.1016/j.jmb.2006.07.030Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, as anticipated, the G:A mismatch results in at least a 106-fold loss of activity (bold, underlined is the mismatch, italicized cytosine undergoes methylation, 5′ GCGC 3′/5′ GAGC 3′) (Fig. 1). The same experiment with CcrM C. crescentus (Fig. 1, G:G mismatch) results in enhanced activity (kmethylation, 2.05 ± 0.29 min±−1 versus the control 1.28 ± 0.14 min−1), providing good evidence that CcrM C. crescentus does not interact with its substrate like M.HhaI. The results for Dam (another DNA adenine methyltransferase) also show a significant loss of activity (Fig. 1). Placement of multiple mismatches within and just outside of the GANTC recognition sequence has only minor impact on kcat (0.79 ± 0.13, 0.75 ± 0.1, 0.92 ± 0.14 min−1 for substrates containing up to three mismatches (M = mismatch, 5′-MGACTC-3′, 5′-MGAMTC-3′, and 5′-MMGAMTC-3′)). To further probe the interactions between CcrM C. crescentus and dsDNA, we inserted a A:C mismatch into the CcrM C. crescentus recognition site, involving the guanosine immediately adjacent to the target adenine (5′AACTC-3′/5′-GAGTC-3′, A is already methylated, italicized A undergoes methylation, bold and underlined are the mismatched bases), and compared this to the mismatch at the same position, which retains the cognate sequence in the strand that undergoes methylation (involving a G:T mismatch) (Fig. 1). In this case the mismatch derives from the complement (5′-GACTC-3′/5′-GAGTT-3′). Although both substrates contain a mismatch, only the former carries a change in the strand positioned to be methylated. The selective 105-fold decrease observed when the mismatch occurs on the strand undergoing methylation provides compelling evidence not only that CcrM C. crescentus relies on a recognition mechanism distinct from other DNA methyltransferases (8Cheng X. Roberts R.J. AdoMet-dependent methylation, DNA methyltransferases and base flipping.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29 (11557810): 3784-379510.1093/nar/29.18.3784Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 9Cheng X.

The distinctive response to mismatched DNA shown with CcrM C. crescentus (Fig. 1), compared with other classes of DNA methyltransferases (Dam, M.HhaI), both of which are structurally characterized, suggests a nonstandard protein–DNA interface. We probed this further using a kinetic footprinting strategy with ssDNA, which measures kcat at saturating DNA concentrations; because kcat is determined by kmethylation or a prior step for CcrM C. crescentus (7Woodcock C.B. Yakubov A.B. Reich N.O. Caulobacter crescentus cell cycle–regulated DNA methyltransferase uses a novel mechanism for substrate recognition.Biochemistry. 2017; 56 (28661661): 3913-392210.1021/acs.biochem.7b00378Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), it is the appropriate kinetic constant to compare substrates.

We systematically changed the overall length from 11 to 21 nucleotides (nt), by keeping the number of 5′ and 3′ nt the same (Fig. 2A). The dramatic drop from 19 to 17 nt was probed further in Fig. 2B, showing that even the removal of a single nt from the 19-nt substrate results in a large decrease in kcat. The blue sequences in Fig. 2B show that it is not simply the length that is important, because the asymmetric 19-nt sequence (addition of nt on the 5′ side at the expense of the 3′ side) shows a loss in kcat. To determine whether the identity of the 3′ nt contributed to kcat, we replaced this in symmetric 17-nt substrates (Fig. 2C). Surprisingly, the ssDNA with a 3′ cytidine shows 3–5-fold higher kcat values than the guanosine, thymidine, or adenosine. This effect is even more dramatic with the corresponding 18-nt substrates (Fig. 2D), which shows that the cytidine at the 3′ end causes kcat to be 4.5–10-fold larger than with adenosine, thymidine, or guanosine. The identity of the 3′ base is so important that the activity with a 17-nt substrate can be as good as with a 19-nt substrate if the former has an asymmetric positioning of the 3′ cytosine 8 nt from the recognition GANTC site (Fig. S1A). Intriguingly, this effect of a 3′ cytosine is observed at lengths from 11 to 19 nt, although the effect is most dramatic at the 18- and 17-nt lengths (Fig. S1B). The kinetic footprinting approach used here hides the impact of changes in binding, yet it does reveal functionally important interactions. What remains unclear is how interactions so far removed from the consensus recognition sequence impact methylation. Nevertheless, functionally important interactions covering six nucleotides on the 5′ side and eight nucleotides on the 3′ side of the consensus GANTC sequence is highly unusual. We suggest that this large interface may be an important element of the DNA recognition mechanism used by CcrM C. crescentus. The ability of CcrM C. crescentus to efficiently and sequence-specifically modify ssDNA presents a potential problem because of the high intracellular levels of single-stranded RNA. Our prior demonstration that CcrM C. crescentus is able to discriminate against single-stranded RNA by over a million-fold helps explain this, and we sought to isolate the features of the RNA that contribute to this discrimination. The ability of proteins to discriminate between ssDNA and single-stranded RNA binding has certainly been reported but remains poorly understood (17Shamoo Y. Single stranded DNA binding proteins.in: Encyclopedia of Life Sciences. John Wiley and sons, New York2002: 1-7Google Scholar, 18Lu D. Searles M.A. Klug A. Crystal structure of a zinc-finger RNA complex reveals two modes of molecular recognition.Nature. 2003; 426 (14603324): 96-10010.1038/nature02088Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The dramatic discrimination displayed by CcrM C. crescentus (7Woodcock C.B. Yakubov A.B. Reich N.O. Caulobacter crescentus cell cycle–regulated DNA methyltransferase uses a novel mechanism for substrate recognition.Biochemistry. 2017; 56 (28661661): 3913-392210.1021/acs.biochem.7b00378Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) provides an opportunity to investigate this in some detail. Replacing the five deoxyriboses with riboses within the recognition site (GANTC) dramatically lowers the methylation kinetics (Fig. 3A), whereas similar substitutions to three sugars on either side of the recognition site have minimal impact. These are saturating conditions that remove concerns that the CcrM C. crescentus may not be able to bind some of the substrates (increasing the protein concentration does not change the kinetics). Introduction of riboses at each of the two positions within the site (Fig. 3B, GACTC) results in a 6–41-fold loss of activity, and the doubly substituted sequence is dramatically less active (100-fold decrease). These results suggest that the interactions between CcrM C. crescentus and the sugars at these internal positions within the sequence involving the 2′-OH groups contribute to these dramatic decreases in kinetics rather than any large-scale conformation differences between single-stranded RNA and DNA (Fig. 3A). The poorly characterized β-class DNA methyltransferases, which include CcrM C. crescentus and its orthologs, have a distinctive organization of conserved motifs (Fig. 4) in relation to the target recognition domain. We analyzed the protein sequences of functionally characterized β-class enzymes that recognize GANTC sequences. We identified a new motif, located in the C terminus with 13 highly conserved residues; the β-class enzymes are broadly observed throughout proteobacteria. M.HinfI, an archetype β-class methyltransferase, is part of a type II restriction/modification system that was previously shown to have activity with both single- and double-stranded dsDNA (19Bassing C.H. Kim Y.G. Li L. Chandrasegaran S. Overproduction, purification and characterization of M. HinfI methyltransferase and its deletion mutant.Gene. 1992; 113 (1563635): 83-8810.1016/0378-1119(92)90672-CCrossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), although lacking the dramatic sequence discrimination displayed by CcrM. We obtained similar results showing that the activity with dsDNA is 21-fold better than with ssDNA (Table 1). Intriguingly, removal of the C-terminal 97 residues results in a 7-fold enhancement of ssDNA activity, whereas the activity with dsDNA is completely lost. These results strongly implicate this C-terminal region in dsDNA recognition, whereas its contribution toward ssDNA recognition is minimal.Table 1Summary of kinetic data and substrate specificity constants, single-turnover assays, and thermodynamic constants from EMSAsEnzymeDouble-stranded DNASingle-stranded DNAkmethylationKdkmethylation/KdkmethylationKdkmethylation/Kdmin−1nmnm min−1min−1nmnm min−1CcrM (C. crescentus)2.61 ± 0.2170.8 ± 7.20.037 ± 0.0053.33 ± 0.3039.2 ± 4.50.085 ± 0.012CcrM C. crescentus truncationNo activityNo activityNo activityNo activityNo activityNo activityCcrM C. crescentus W332ANo activityNo activityNo activityNo activityNo activityNo activityCcrM A. tumefaciens0.50 ± 0.0589.0 ± 3.10.006 ± 0.0010.73 ± 0.0734.2 ± 5.00.021 ± 0.004CcrM B. abortus0.42 ± 0.0341.5 ± 7.40.010 ± 0.0020.46 ± 0.0677.1 ± 14.60.006 ± 0.001M.HinfI1.27 ± 0.100.060 ± 0.003M.HinfI truncationNo activity>1 μmNo activity0.39 ± 0.03M.HhaII2.30 ± 0.2131.5 ± 3.00.073 ± 0.010>300 times slowerDpnA0.020 ± 0.0010.051 ± 0.004 Open table in a new tab To investigate the importance of the C-terminal region in CcrM C. crescentus, we studied the comparable deletion, removing 80 residues from the C terminus (Fig. 4). This CcrM C. crescentus truncation showed no activity with either single-stranded or dsDNA (Fig. 5) and shows no ability to bind DNA (Fig. S5). Based on our limits of detection, we estimate that the activity of the truncated form is at least 107-fold less than the WT CcrM C. crescentus. The CD spectrum of the truncation is nearly identical to the full-length CcrM C. crescentus, suggesting that little or no overall conformational changes are involved (Fig. S6). Tryptophan 332 is one of the highly conserved residues in this region, and mutation to an alanine results in the same functional consequences as the C-terminal truncation (Table 1). Again, the corresponding CD spectra (Fig. S6) strongly suggests the lack of any large-scale conformational changes resulting from this substitution."
https://openalex.org/W2897433900,"The present longitudinal study is the first to examine game to game fluctuations of perceived justice of elite volleyball and handball coaches. More specifically, we studied whether coaching style (i.e., need support versus control), coach behaviors (decision justifications), player's status (i.e., starter or substitute), and game result (win/loss) predicted athletes' perceived justice and its fluctuations.A longitudinal questionnaire study was performed during 6 consecutive weeks among Belgian female volleyball (N = 57) and male handball players (N = 39). We administered a general questionnaire (i.e., need support/control) the first week, and game-specific questionnaires (i.e., justice, decision justifications, game circumstances) after six consecutive games. Because game-to-game measures (i.e., within-athlete) were nested into individuals (between-athletes) we conducted Hierarchical Linear Modeling to examine the hypotheses.Multilevel analyses showed that 49% of the variance of perceived justice was situated at the within-athlete level. Furthermore, coaches' need support and the provision of decision justifications were positive predictors of athletes' perceived justice of the coach. More specific, the impact of justifications was less strong in a high need supportive environment and stronger in a high controlling environment. Finally, both the status of the player and the game result were negative predictors of athletes' perceived justice.We can conclude that athletes' perceived justice of their coach shifts considerably from game-to-game. Furthermore, the coaching style and coaching behaviors can help to overcome the negative effects of specific game circumstances such as being a substitute or losing a game on athletes' perceived justice of the coach."
https://openalex.org/W2897513391,"The allosteric activation of the intrinsically disordered enzyme Staphylococcus aureus sortase A is initiated via binding of a Ca2+ ion. Although Ca2+ binding was shown to initiate structural changes inducing disorder-to-order transitions, the details of the allosteric activation mechanism remain elusive. We performed long-term molecular dynamics simulations of sortase A without (3 simulations of 1.6 μs) and with bound Ca2+ (simulations of 1.6 μs, 1.8 μs, and 2.5 μs). Our results show that Ca2+ binding causes not only ordering of the disordered β6/β7 loop of the protein, but also modulates hinge motions in the dynamic β7/β8 loop, which is important for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Cation binding triggers signal transmission from the Ca2+ binding site to the dynamic β7/β8 loop via the repetitive folding/unfolding of short helical stretches of the disordered β6/β7 loop. These correlated structural rearrangements lead to several distinct conformational states of the binding groove, which show optimal binding features for the sorting signal motif and feature binding energies up to 20 kcal/mol more favorable than observed for the sortase A without Ca2+. The presented results indicate a highly correlated, conformational selection-based activation mechanism of the enzyme triggered by cation binding. They also demonstrate the importance of the dynamics of intrinsically disordered regions for allosteric regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2896323777,"Perception of irony has been observed to be impaired in adults with autism spectrum disorder. In typically developed adults, the mismatch of verbal and nonverbal emotional cues can be perceived as an expression of irony even in the absence of any further contextual information. In this study, we evaluate to what extent high functioning autists perceive this incongruence as expressing irony. Our results show that incongruent verbal and nonverbal signals create an impression of irony significantly less often in participants with high-functioning autism than in typically developed control subjects. The extent of overall autistic symptomatology as measured with the autism-spectrum questionnaire (AQ), however, does not correlate with the reduced tendency to attribute incongruent stimuli as expressing irony. Therefore, the attenuation in irony attribution might rather be related to specific subdomains of autistic traits, such as a reduced tendency to interpret communicative signals in terms of complex intentional mental states. The observed differences in irony attribution support the assumption that a less pronounced tendency to engage in higher order mentalization processes might underlie the impairment of pragmatic language understanding in high functioning autism."

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of maternal fenvalerate exposure during pregnancy on growth and neurobehavioral development in the offspring. Pregnant mice were orally administered to fenvalerate (0.2, 2.0, and 20 mg/kg) daily throughout pregnancy. The tests of growth and neurobehavioral development were performed during lactation period. A series of neurobehavioral tasks were carried out from lactation to puberty. Anxiety-related behaviors were evaluated by open-field and elevated plus maze. Morris Water Maze was used to assess spatial learning and memory ability. Results showed that maternal fenvalerate exposure during pregnancy markedly delayed growth development of neonatal offspring during lactation. In addition, anxiety-like behaviors were increased in fenvalerate-exposed male offspring. Moreover, spatial learning and memory was severely impaired in female offspring. Taken together, maternal fenvalerate exposure during pregnancy delayed growth and neurobehavioral development in a gender-dependent manner. Additional study is required to explore the underlying mechanism through which maternal fenvalerate exposure during pregnancy induces impairment of growth and neurobehavioral development."
https://openalex.org/W2897088026,"Hybrid visceral-renal debranching procedures with endovascular repair have been proposed as a less invasive alternative to conventional thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm or dissection (TAAA or TAAD) surgery. Up to now, there has been no information about the hemodynamic effects of retrograde visceral reconstruction (RVR) for Crawford type II/III/IV TAAA patients undergoing hybrid treatment. The aim is to provide insights in the abnormal hemodynamics of RVR from unilateral or bilateral common iliac arteries (CIAs). Idealized three-dimensional AAs with RVR from unilateral CIA or bilateral CIAs were generated and computationally simulated. The results show that RVRs from CIA lead to a dramatic decrease in flow to the visceral organs compared with a healthy AA and that the anastomosis region is most dangerous to graft occlusion and the initiation of an aneurysm. In addition, compared with a quar-furcated graft, the employment of bilateral bi-furcated grafts have better performance in terms of the wall shear stress (WSS) and flow filed but result in less flow to the celiac and mesenteric arteries. This study has revealed the potential risks after an RVR operation, and points out the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches for the visceral reconstruction, which the vascular surgeons are not fully aware of. According to our results, bilateral bi-furcated grafts are recommended to the TAAA patients when the CIAs are unique inflow sites for visceral reconstruction. A precise plan with patient specific for TAAA or TAAD will be designed for better long-term outcome."

While low levels of ANXA7 are associated with aggressive types of cancer, the clinical impact of ANXA7 in prostate cancer remains unclear. Tissue microarrays (TMA) have revealed several new molecular markers in human tumors. Herein, we have identified the prognostic impact of ANXA7 in a prostate cancer using a tissue microarray containing 637 different specimens.The patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer and long-term follow-up information on progression (median 5.3 years), tumor-specific and overall survival data (median 5.9 years) were available. Expression of Ki67, Bcl-2, p53, CD-10 (neutral endopeptidase), syndecan-1 (CD-138) and ANXA7 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.A bimodal distribution of ANXA7 was observed. Tumors expressing either high or no ANXA7 were found to be associated with poor prognosis. However, ANXA7 at an optimal level, in between high and no ANXA7 expression, had a better prognosis. This correlated with low Ki67, Bcl-2, p53 and high syndecan-1 which are known predictors of early recurrence. At Gleason grade 3, ANXA7 is an independent predictor of poor overall survival with a p-value of 0.003. Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, which is known to be associated with overexpression of Bcl-2 and inhibition of Ki67 LI and CD-10, was found to be associated with under-expression of ANXA7.The results of this TMA study identified ANXA7 as a new prognostic factor and indicates a bimodal correlation to tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2897676327,"Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) integrate the advantages of WLANs and mobile Ad Hoc networks, which have become the key techniques of next-generation wireless networks in the context of emergency recovery. Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) are multi-hop wireless networks with instant deployment, self-healing, self-organization and self-configuration features. These capabilities make WMNs a promising technology for incident and emergency communication. An incident area network (IAN) needs a reliable and lively routing path during disaster recovery and emergency response operations when infrastructure-based communications and power resources have been destroyed and no routes are available. Power aware routing plays a significant role in WMNs, in order to provide continuous efficient emergency services. The existing power aware routing algorithms used in wireless networks cannot fully fit the characteristics of WMNs, to be used for emergency recovery. This paper proposes a power aware routing algorithm (PARA) for WMNs, which selects optimal paths to send packets, mainly based on the power level of next node along the path. This algorithm was implemented and tested in a proven simulator. The analytic results show that the proposed power node-type aware routing algorithm metric can clearly improve the network performance by reducing the network overheads and maintaining a high delivery ratio with low latency."
https://openalex.org/W2951388192,"Morphological classification of living things has challenged science for several centuries and has led to a wide range of objective morphometric approaches in data gathering and analysis. In this paper we explore those methods using apple cultivars, a model biological system in which discrete groups are pre-defined but in which there is a high level of overall morphological similarity. The effectiveness of morphometric techniques in discovering the groups is evaluated using statistical learning tools. No one technique proved optimal in classification on every occasion, linear morphometric techniques slightly out-performing geometric (72.6% accuracy on test set versus 66.7%). The combined use of these techniques with post-hoc knowledge of their individual successes with particular cultivars achieves a notably higher classification accuracy (77.8%). From this we conclude that even with pre-determined discrete categories, a range of approaches is needed where those categories are intrinsically similar to each other, and we raise the question of whether in studies where potentially continuous natural variation is being categorised the level of match between categories is routinely set too high."
https://openalex.org/W2896932421,"To date there is scarce published evidence reporting the dual blood supply reaching anterior papillary muscle (APM), which descends from both major coronary arteries. Such a vascular configuration can prevent the dysfunction of right ventricular entire valvular system in case of the occlusion of proximal part of either right coronary artery (RCA) or left coronary artery (LCA). The aim of our study was to determine the vascular pattern of APM blood supply which originates from two main coronary arteries, in the context of the APM and septomarginal trabecula (SMT) topography.The study was carried out using tissue obtained from 36 human hearts. The material was divided into four morphological types of SMT/APM arrangement. Vascularization and blood supply pattern of papillary muscle was investigated following the analysis of multiple tissue cross sections. The origin of APM arterial supply was traced back to both main coronary arteries. Cross-sectional area of the arteries was estimated at the base of APM and compared within mixed male-female population, aged 18-76.We noted that as much as 78% of entire APM material had a blood supply vasculature originating from both LCA and RCA branches. In contrast, 22% of cases APM was supplied by a single coronary artery, while in each case it proved to be LCA. We have never found APM arterial supply provided exclusively by RCA. In case of double AMP blood supply an average of total cross-section area of the arteries branching from LCA, was noted to be in excess of two and a half times bigger in type III and more than two times bigger in type IV, as compared with the arteries originating from RCA.Our research confirm the possibility of double blood supply which vascularizes APM, but the finding does not necessarily apply in all cases. However, APM seems to be predominantly vascularized by arteries deriving from LCA, regardless of their morphological type."
https://openalex.org/W2897929873,"The pulp and pericarp of mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana) fruit are popular food, beverage and health products whereby 60% of the fruit consist of the pericarp. The major metabolite in the previously neglected or less economically significant part of the fruit, the pericarp, is the prenylated xanthone α-mangostin. This highly bioactive secondary metabolite is typically isolated using solvent extraction methods that involve large volumes of halogenated solvents either via direct or indirect extraction. In this study, we compared the quantities of α-mangostin extracted using three different extraction methods based on the environmentally friendly solvents methanol and ethyl acetate. The three solvent extractions methods used were direct extractions from methanol (DM) and ethyl acetate (DEA) as well as indirect extraction of ethyl acetate obtained via solvent partitioning from an initial methanol extract (IEA). Our results showed that direct extraction afforded similar and higher quantities of α-mangostin than indirect extraction (DM: 318 mg; DEA: 305 mg; IEA: 209 mg per 5 g total dried pericarp). Therefore, we suggest that the commonly used method of indirect solvent extraction using halogenated solvents for the isolation of α-mangostin is replaced by single solvent direct extraction using the environmentally friendly solvents methanol or ethyl acetate."
https://openalex.org/W2895930016,"Background The obesity epidemic presents a major public health challenge, and a poor diet quality has been identified as one of the most important contributing factors. Whereas a sufficient fruit and vegetable consumption has been associated with several positive health outcomes, the long-term effect on overweight and obesity is unclear. Thus, the aims of this study were to investigate if one year with free school fruit had any effect on weight status 14 years later, and if it affected the birth weight of the participants’ children. Methods In 2001, 10 -12-year old Norwegian children, received one year of free school fruit in the intervention study “Fruits and Vegetables Make the Marks” (FVMM) and in 2016, a total of 1081 participants of 2049 eligible responded to a follow-up survey. Multilevel logistic regression was used to investigate if one year of free school fruit was associated with weight status and with birthweight status of the offspring. The analyses were adjusted for gender, educational level, and the offspring analysis also for parents’ weight status, and the nested design (child/parent). Results The odds ratios of being overweight (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.70, 1.24) or having a child with high or low birth weight (OR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.21, 1.30) in the intervention group compared to the control group were not statistically significant, 14 years after the intervention period. Conclusions One year of free school fruit did not have an effect on weight status on the participants or birth weight of their offspring, 14 years after the intervention period. Although, results from the present study contribute to fill the knowledge gaps concerning long-term effects of public health efforts on weight status, more follow-up studies with larger samples are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2897052235,"Homeoproteins contain the conserved homeodomain (HD) and have an important role determining embryo body plan during development. HDs increase their DNA-binding specificity by interacting with additional cofactors outlining a Hox interactome with a multiplicity of protein-protein interactions. In Drosophila, the first link of functional contact with a general transcription factor (GTF) was found between Antennapedia (Antp) and BIP2 (TFIID complex). Hox proteins also interact with other components of Pol II machinery such as the subunit Med19 from Mediator (MED) complex, TFIIEβ and transcription-pausing factor M1BP. All these interactions clearly demonstrate Hox-driven transcriptional regulation, but the precise molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this paper, we focused on the Antp-TFIIEβ protein-protein interface to establish the specific contacts as well as its functional role. Using Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) in cell culture and in vivo we found that TFIIEβ interacts with Antp through the HD independently of the YPWM motif and the direct physical interaction is at helix 2, specifically aminoacidic positions I32 and H36 of Antp. We also found, through ectopic assays, that these two positions in helix 2 are crucial for Antp homeotic function in head involution, and thoracic and antenna-to tarsus transformations. Interestingly, overexpression of Antp and TFIIEβ in the antennal disc showed that this interaction is required for the antenna-to-tarsus transformation. In conclusion, interaction of Antp with TFIIEβ is important for the functional specificity of Antennapedia, and amino acids 32 and 36 in Antp HD helix 2 are key for this interaction. Our results open the possibility to more broadly analyze Antp-TFIIEβ interaction on the transcriptional control for the activation and/or repression of target genes in the Hox interactome during Drosophila development."
https://openalex.org/W2897095489,"Background Quality of service provision in health facilities is fundamental to ensure effective care. However, women’s actual experience of care is often neglected. Objective To assess perceived quality of institutional delivery services and associated factors among women who delivered in public health facilities of Southwest Ethiopia. Method Community based cross-sectional study was conducted in three districts of Jimma zone, Southwestern Ethiopia, from February 29 to March 20, 2016. A total of 423 mothers who delivered in public health facilities during the last 12 months were selected to participate in the study. Study participants were identified using simple random sampling procedure. Principal component analysis was used to generate scores for three sub-dimensions of perceived quality. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of these sub-dimensions. Results Perceived quality of institutional delivery services was measured with three dimensions: perceived interpersonal interaction, health care delivery and health facility/structure. We found that perceived quality of interpersonal interaction was negatively affected by educational level (read and write) (β: -0.331, 95% CI: -0.523, -0.140), urban residence (β: -0.485, 95% CI: -0.696, -0.275), antenatal care (less than three visits) (β: -0.238, 95% CI: -0.419,-0.056) and delivery service attended by male provider (β: -1.286, 95% CI: -1.463,-1.109). Perceived quality of health care delivery was negatively associated with still birth (β: -0.642, 95% CI: -1.092,-0.193) and delivery services attended by male provider (β: -0.689, 95% CI: -0.907,-0.472). Urban residence (β: -0.260, 95% CI: -0.515,-0.005), and antenatal care (less than three visits) (β: -0.394, 95% CI: -0.628,-0.161) were negatively associated with perceived quality of health facility/structure. Conclusion Overall, the perceived quality of institutional delivery services was low. We recommend that health managers and health care providers jointly work to transform birth care at the health facilities to deliver person-centered care. Addressing the preferences of clients is as important as taking care of structural concerns pinpointed in this study."

Objective To investigate the association of the Val158Met polymorphism with pain and function outcomes in women with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) who received surgery or manual therapy including desensitization manoeuvres of the central nervous system. Methods A pre-planned secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of manual therapy including desensitization manoeuvres of the central nervous system vs. surgery in 120 women with CTS was conducted. Women were randomized to receive 3 sessions of manual therapy (n = 60) or decompression of the carpal tunnel (n = 60). The primary outcome was intensity of pain (mean pain and the worst pain), and secondary outcomes included function and symptoms severity subscales of the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the intervention. Rs4680 genotypes were determined after amplifying the Val158Met polymorphism by polymerase chain reactions. We classified subjects according to their Val158Met polymorphism: Val/Val, Val/Met, or Met/Met. The primary aim (treatment group*Val158Met*time) was examined with repeated measures ANCOVA with intention-to-treat analysis. Results At 12 months, 111 (92%) women completed the follow-up. No interaction was observed between the Val158Met genotype and any outcome: mean pain intensity (F = 0.60; P = 0.69), worst pain intensity (F = 0.49; P = 0.61), function (F = 0.12; P = 0.88) or symptom severity (F = 0.01; P = 0.98). Conclusion The current clinical trial did not show an association between the Val158Met polymorphism and changes in pain and function outcomes after either surgery or physical therapy in women with CTS."

We investigated the diagnostic value of VHs in different types of very mild degenerative dementia.Participants were required to complete a structured interview form recording their basic data, clinical history, neuropsychological tests, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Basic demographic characteristics of the participants were summarized and compared. The frequency and association factors of VHs were compared among three major degenerative dementia groups, namely, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), and DLB.A total of 197 patients with dementia and a clinical dementia rating of 0.5 were investigated, comprising 124 with AD, 35 with PDD, and 38 with DLB. A significantly higher frequency of VHs was found in the DLB group compared with the other groups (DLB, PDD, and AD = 31.6%, 11.4%, and 4.0%; p < 0.001). A multivariable logistic regression test for associations of positive VHs revealed that DLB was the only independently predictive factor (odds ratio: 13.62; p < 0.001).Our findings revealed a high diagnostic value of VHs in very mild degenerative dementia. VHs in this stage of dementia were significantly associated with DLB, and more than 30% of patients with very mild dementia caused by DLB presented with VHs."
https://openalex.org/W2896696745,"Cellular responses to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) are altered in a variety of pathological conditions, including cancers, fibroses, and vascular diseases, making PDGF-induced signaling pathways important therapeutic targets. The limited success of therapies designed to impact PDGF pathways may be overcome with a clearer understanding of how cells integrate signals from PDGF and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we assessed the effects of fibronectin matrix assembly on the responsiveness of mesenchymal cells to PDGF. Our results indicate that fibroblast-mediated assembly of fibronectin fibrils attenuates intracellular calcium release in response to PDGF. The dose-dependent inhibition of PDGF-induced intracellular calcium release was specific to the ECM form of fibronectin. Further, a recombinant protein engineered to mimic ECM fibronectin similarly attenuated intracellular calcium release in response to PDGF. Of note, fibronectin attenuated the PDGF-calcium signaling axis at the level of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation. Interestingly, ECM fibronectin did not alter other intracellular signals activated by PDGF, including activation of PDGF receptor β, AKT Ser/Thr kinase, phospholipase Cγ1, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Rather, fibronectin inhibited activation of the p55 regulatory subunit of PI3K in response to a variety of stimuli, indicating that ECM fibronectin selectively attenuates the intracellular calcium release cascade while leaving intact other PDGF signaling pathways. Selective regulation of calcium signaling by ECM fibronectin via the p55 regulatory subunit of PI3K represents a mechanism by which cells tune their response to PDGF and may therefore serve as a target to selectively regulate one branch of PDGF signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2896188722,"In the Alps phylogeographic studies indicate for small insect-pollinated herbs that climatic fluctuations caused significant population migrations and fragmentations into glacial refugia at the periphery of the Alps. Here we investigate whether this holds also for wind-pollinated and -dispersed species. We therefore analysed the phylogeographic pattern (nuclear and chloroplast dataset) of a clade of the four species of the Helictotrichon parlatorei species group (Poaceae) endemic to the Alps. In contrast to earlier findings for small insect-pollinated herbs no clear barriers to gene flow could be detected in this species group. Instead a few haplotypes are widespread across the entire Alpine region. While the complete absence of a phylogeographic structure in the plastid dataset hints towards very efficient long distance seed dispersal, the moderate phylogeographic structure in the nuclear dataset indicates at least some spatial restriction to pollen dispersal. Rare haplotypes cluster solely in the Western and Southern central Alps and thereby suggest this to be the area of origin for the H. parlatorei species group from where expansion occurred following the presence of calcareous bedrock into the Eastern Alps. We thus conclude that the inclusion of taxa with complementary life-history traits is vital in understanding the glacial history of the Alpine flora."
