https://openalex.org/W1996221527,"NEONATAL thymectomy leads to the rapid development of lymphoid organ atrophy and well-characterized immunological deficiencies1–3, but thymectomy performed in adult life leads only to the slow development of a moderate degree of lymphoid atrophy4 with no loss of immunological competence when the animals are tested immediately after operation5,6. However, adult thymectomy combined with whole-body irradiation does lead to immunological deficiencies of the same general nature as those following neonatal thymectomy7. Recent investigations have shown that continuous repopulation of normal haemopoietic organs occurs in normal life8,9. This suggests that whole-body irradiation by causing cell damage and repopulation in haemopoietic organs may merely accelerate a process which occurs continually throughout life, albeit at a much slower rate. These considerations prompted a re-examination of the long-term effects of adult thymectomy on immunological competence."

https://openalex.org/W2019238517,"THE red blood cells of mammalian vertebrates, including man, are normally round, except those of the camel, which are characteristically oval in shape. Less than 15 per cent of the red blood corpuscles in normal healthy men are oval, but in severe anaemias the number of oval cells in the peripheral blood may become much higher. This symptomatic ovalocytosis in severe anaemias is to be distinguished from hereditary ovalocytosis, or elliptocytosis, first described by Dresbach1 in 1904. In the hereditary condition, more than 25 per cent of the red blood cells are oval or elliptic, and elliptic rod-shaped cells are more common than in the symptomatic condition. The two conditions can usually be distinguished, with experience, but the diagnosis can only be confirmed by demonstration of a family occurrence. Incidence of the hereditary condition in the general population has previously been estimated at approximately 0.04 per cent2,3, although more prevalent in Dutch, German and Italian families4,5. A focus of high frequency of hereditary ovalocytosis (elliptocytosis) has been reported from central Celebes6. I now report another focus of high frequency of hereditary ovalocytosis (elliptocytosis) in Malayan aborigines."

https://openalex.org/W2072693764,"SYNAPTIC contacts between neurosecretory fibres and pituicytes have been demonstrated in the eel, and the suggestion made that this association might form part of a mechanism for feed-back of information to the hypothalamus1. Recent experimental investigations support this view."
https://openalex.org/W2078408414,"RECENT investigations have revealed that template DNA is found natively in the form, of single-stranded loops during the active transcription of selected portions of the genome in higher organisms1,2. Conversely, during repression of such transcription the DNA is found natively in the form of double-stranded helices1,2. A variety of organic molecules which function in vivo as inhibitors or stimulators of RNA synthesis within pre-selected portions of the genome2 have been shown to be capable of a reversible physical binding to DNA in vivo or in vitro. Each of these inhibitors or stimulators binds preferentially to either single-stranded or to double-stranded DNA. In every case for which adequate data are available (Table 1), a strong correlation exists between the form of DNA preferred for binding and the effect of the ligand on RNA synthesis within pre-selected portions of the genome. These strong correlations suggest that such ligands may exert their characteristic effects on RNA synthesis by preferentially stabilizing either the inactive helical form or the active loop form of DNA2,10 in the equilibrium:"

https://openalex.org/W2051463007,THE interaction of high-energy radiation with proteins has received a great deal of attention and in the past few years much has been published on this subject.

https://openalex.org/W2091030393,"UNTIL recently there was little evidence that the plane of nutrition in early pregnancy could affect ovine foetal growth or survival1–3. In the past year or so, however, it has been shown that maternal undernutrition during the first 90 days of gestation may influence foetal weight at 90 days4 and possibly embryo survival5."

https://openalex.org/W1976060559,"TEMPERATURE and texture have both been suggested as possible normal explanations of the ‘skin-vision’ phenomenon1. Neither of them explains Russian claims of perception at a distance (claims not supported by Barrett and Rice-Evans2 using a low level of illumination); however, they do provide potential cues in situations where touch is involved. Colourants may give surfaces with characteristic textures and the colour of a surface will affect the amount of heat it absorbs. Recently, Buckhout3 found that, even with illumination provided by a 40-W bulb (a good source of infrared radiation), out of 80 subjects not one could distinguish between 10 colours in 90 presentations. He controlled texture by covering the colours with a thin layer of plastic. In the experiment reported here I investigated what part both texture and temperature might play in a very simple situation: that of a black–white discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W2062591856,"IN a series of investigations dealing with the comparative studies of relative growth in various groups of arthropods and man1–7 I have confirmed a tendency that the growth ratios of rapidly growing parts of the body tend to be more similar than those of slowly growing parts when two or more closely related forms (such as geographically isolated populations, subspecies, parthenogenetic and bisexual strains of the same arthropod species, interspecific-hybrid and very closely related species in arthropods, Negro and Caucasian children) are compared. This indicates that in incipient stages of structural divergence during evolution the slowly growing parts would tend to be more affected than rapidly growing parts."
