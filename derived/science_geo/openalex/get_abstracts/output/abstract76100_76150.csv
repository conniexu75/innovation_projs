This communication reports the occurrence of trace quantities of this acid in the rumen bacteria from a fistulated cow fed clover-grass hay."

There was a constant rise in urea excretion during the first 24 h. Adrenalectomy inhibited the response to 2 DG, and no effect was observed when 2 DG was injected together with glucose or insulin."

https://openalex.org/W2092405954,"ZUMPT1 in his comprehensive work on myiasis in the Old World includes Anisopus (Anisopodidae) under intestinal myiasis, James2, writing on myiasig from the New World, also includes Anisopus (as Sylvicola) in the same category. Smart3 states that there are records of Anisopus larvae in cases of intestinal and urino-genital myiasis. Many of the early text-books of medical entomology do not include the genus."

https://openalex.org/W2076488010,"INTESTINAL absorption of radio-iron in intact rats was increased during the enhanced erythropoiesis which followed haemolysis induced by phenylhydrazine1. Similarly, erythropoiesis stimulated by acetylphenylhydrazine in dogs also increased iron absorption in vivo2. This report describes experiments designed to study the effects of increased erythropoiesis in the rat on iron transport across everted duodenal gut sacs in vitro. The in vitro technique has defined an active transport mechanism for iron absorption3,4 which varies adaptively with dietary iron and pregnancy5 and, as will be shown, the cellular mechanism is also involved in the response to increased erythropoiesis."

https://openalex.org/W2070861068,"THE post-mortem pH decline in a tissue has been accepted as an indication of the underlying, concomitant physical and chemical changes1,2. The relationship of this acidity development to subsequent tissue processing and organoleptic properties has also been established3,4. Although such investigations with muscle tissue have received considerable attention5–9, similar investigations have not been undertaken with adipose tissue. Consequently, this investigation was conducted to determine the rate and extent of pH decline, if any, in adipose tissue."

Red fluorescence has been observed in the Harderian gland of hamsters and some other rodents5, but its significance is obscure. Red fluorescence is also seen in many tumours3,4. In all these cases the red fluorescence is due to the presence of porphyrins."
