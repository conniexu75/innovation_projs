https://openalex.org/W2120470126,"NPR1 is an essential regulator of plant systemic acquired resistance (SAR), which confers immunity to a broad-spectrum of pathogens. SAR induction results in accumulation of the signal molecule salicylic acid (SA), which induces defense gene expression via activation of NPR1. We found that in an uninduced state, NPR1 is present as an oligomer formed through intermolecular disulfide bonds. Upon SAR induction, a biphasic change in cellular reduction potential occurs, resulting in reduction of NPR1 to a monomeric form. Monomeric NPR1 accumulates in the nucleus and activates gene expression. Inhibition of NPR1 reduction prevents defense gene expression, whereas mutation of Cys82 or Cys216 in NPR1 leads to constitutive monomerization, nuclear localization of the mutant proteins, and defense gene expression. These data provide a missing link between accumulation of SA and activation of NPR1 in the SAR signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2051673088,"Arrhythmias, a common cause of sudden cardiac death, can occur in structurally normal hearts, although the mechanism is not known. In cardiac muscle, the ryanodine receptor (RyR2) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum releases the calcium required for muscle contraction. The FK506 binding protein (FKBP12.6) stabilizes RyR2, preventing aberrant activation of the channel during the resting phase of the cardiac cycle. We show that during exercise, RyR2 phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) partially dissociates FKBP12.6 from the channel, increasing intracellular Ca(2+) release and cardiac contractility. FKBP12.6(-/-) mice consistently exhibited exercise-induced cardiac ventricular arrhythmias that cause sudden cardiac death. Mutations in RyR2 linked to exercise-induced arrhythmias (in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [CPVT]) reduced the affinity of FKBP12.6 for RyR2 and increased single-channel activity under conditions that simulate exercise. These data suggest that ""leaky"" RyR2 channels can trigger fatal cardiac arrhythmias, providing a possible explanation for CPVT."
https://openalex.org/W2009259931,"Intercellular communication involves either direct cell-cell contact or release and uptake of diffusible signals, two strategies mediated by distinct and largely nonoverlapping sets of molecules. Here, we show that the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM can function as a signaling receptor for members of the GDNF ligand family. Association of NCAM with GFRalpha1, a GPI-anchored receptor for GDNF, downregulates NCAM-mediated cell adhesion and promotes high-affinity binding of GDNF to p140(NCAM), resulting in rapid activation of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases Fyn and FAK in cells lacking RET, a known GDNF signaling receptor. GDNF stimulates Schwann cell migration and axonal growth in hippocampal and cortical neurons via binding to NCAM and activation of Fyn, but independently of RET. These results uncover an unexpected intersection between short- and long-range mechanisms of intercellular communication and reveal a pathway for GDNF signaling that does not require the RET receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2062578421,"The observation that CD45(+) stem cells injected into the circulation participate in muscle regeneration raised the question of whether CD45(+) stem cells resident in muscle play a physiological role during regeneration. We found that CD45(+) cells cultured from uninjured muscle were uniformly nonmyogenic. However, CD45(+) cells purified from regenerating muscle readily gave rise to determined myoblasts. The number of CD45(+) cells in muscle rapidly expanded following injury, and a high proportion entered the cell cycle. Investigation of candidate pathways involved in embryonic myogenesis revealed that Wnt signaling was sufficient to induce the myogenic specification of muscle-derived CD45(+) stem cells. Moreover, injection of the Wnt antagonists sFRP2/3 into regenerating muscle markedly reduced CD45(+) stem cell proliferation and myogenic specification. Our data therefore suggest that mobilization of resident CD45(+) stem cells is an important factor in regeneration after injury and highlight the Wnt pathway as a potential therapeutic target for degenerative neuromuscular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2122878396,"The chordate central nervous system has been hypothesized to originate from either a dorsal centralized, or a ventral centralized, or a noncentralized nervous system of a deuterostome ancestor. In an effort to resolve these issues, we examined the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii and studied the expression of orthologs of genes that are involved in patterning the chordate central nervous system. All 22 orthologs studied are expressed in the ectoderm in an anteroposterior arrangement nearly identical to that found in chordates. Domain topography is conserved between hemichordates and chordates despite the fact that hemichordates have a diffuse nerve net, whereas chordates have a centralized system. We propose that the deuterostome ancestor may have had a diffuse nervous system, which was later centralized during the evolution of the chordate lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2020329784,"Telomerase expression is repressed in most somatic cells but is observed in stem cells and a high percentage of human cancers and has been hypothesized to contribute to tumorigenesis and maintenance of stem cell states. To explore telomerase regulation, we employed a general genetic screen to identify negative regulators of hTERT. We discovered three tumor suppressor/oncogene pathways involved in hTERT repression. One, the Mad1/c-Myc pathway, had been previously implicated in hTERT regulation. The second, SIP1, a transcriptional target of the TGF-beta pathway, mediates the TGF-beta regulated repression of hTERT. The third, the tumor suppressor Menin, is a direct repressor of hTERT. Depleting Menin immortalizes primary human fibroblasts and causes a transformation phenotype when coupled with expression of SV40 Large and Small T antigen and oncogenic ras. These studies suggest that multiple tumor suppressor/oncogene pathways coordinately repress hTERT expression and imply that telomerase is reactivated in human tumors through oncogenic mutations."

https://openalex.org/W2110388058,"There are two isoforms of sphingosine kinase (SphK) that catalyze the formation of sphingosine 1-phosphate, a potent sphingolipid mediator. Whereas SphK1 stimulates growth and survival, here we show that SphK2 enhanced apoptosis in diverse cell types and also suppressed cellular proliferation. Apoptosis was preceded by cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-3. SphK2-induced apoptosis was independent of activation of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors. Sequence analysis revealed that SphK2 contains a 9-amino acid motif similar to that present in BH3-only proteins, a pro-apoptotic subgroup of the Bcl-2 family. As with other BH3-only proteins, co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that SphK2 interacted with Bcl-xL. Moreover, site-directed mutation of Leu-219, the conserved leucine residue present in all BH3 domains, markedly suppressed SphK2-induced apoptosis. Hence, the apoptotic effect of SphK2 might be because of its putative BH3 domain.

For analysis of cytochrome c and caspase-3, cytosolic fractions were prepared by resuspending cells in buffer B containing 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, and 700 μg/ml digitonin. Lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. Equal amounts (20 μg) of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transblotted to nitrocellulose. Anti-cytochrome c, anti-HA, anti-ERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-caspase-3 (Stressgen) were used as primary antibodies. Proteins were visualized by ECL (Pierce) with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.). Staining of Apoptotic Nuclei—Cells were fixed by addition of an equal volume of PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose, and apoptosis was assessed by staining with 4 μg/ml Hoechst 33342. Cells expressing GFP were examined with an inverted fluorescence microscope, and apoptotic cells were distinguished by condensed, fragmented nuclear regions (20Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L.C. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The percentage of intact and apoptotic nuclei in cells expressing GFP fluorescence was determined. A minimum of 300 cells was scored in a double-blind manner. Incorporation of Bromodeoxyuridine—24 h after transfection, NIH 3T3 cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 μg/ml insulin, 2 μg/ml transferrin, and 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and then stimulated with serum. After 16 h, cells were incubated for 3 h with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd, 10 μm) and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 5% sucrose (pH 7.0) for 20 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated in permeabilization buffer (0.5% Triton/PBS, pH 7.4, containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 20 min at room temperature and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody in the presence of DNase (50 units/ml). After being washed with PBS, cells were stained with Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse antibody in 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 1 h, washed with PBS, and then photographed using a Nikon Eclipse TE200 inverted fluorescence microscope connected to a CoolSnap digital camera (Roper). Cells expressing GFP with positive BrdUrd staining were counted. At least 10 different fields with a minimum of 10-50 cells were scored per field. Fluorogenic DEVD Cleavage Enzyme Assays—Enzyme reactions were performed in 96-well plates with 20 μg of cytosolic proteins and a final concentration of 20 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC substrate as described previously (35Cuvillier O. Rosenthal D.S. Smulson M.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2910-2916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Opposite Actions of SphK1 and SphK2 in Apoptosis—SphK1 and concomitant formation of S1P has generally been associated with growth and survival (20Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L.C. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 23Edsall L.C. Cuvillier O. Twitty S. Spiegel S. Milstien S. J.

In agreement, overexpression of SphK1 in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts almost completely prevented apoptosis induced by serum starvation (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, expression of SphK2 markedly enhanced apoptosis of serum-starved NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 1A), where shrinkage and condensation of nuclei were clearly evident. Although S1P has been shown to protect cells against anticancer drug-induced apoptosis (22Morita Y. Perez G.I. Paris F. Miranda S.R. Ehleiter D. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Xie Z. Reed J.C. Schuchman E.H. Kolesnick R.N. Tilly J.L. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1109-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), SphK2 unexpectedly increased doxorubicin- and oxidation-induced cell death (Fig. 1A). Expression of SphK2 in HEK 293 cells has previously been shown to increase cellular S1P (25Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). It was of interest to examine S1P levels in SphK1 and SphK2 transfectants in serum-free conditions where expression of SphK1 suppresses and SphK2 enhances apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 1B, S1P levels were significantly increased by overexpression of SphK2 even in the absence of serum, albeit to a lesser extent than SphK1 (Fig 1B). Inhibition of SphK1 and decreased S1P has previously been shown to sensitize TSU-Pr1 prostate cancer cells to apoptotic anticancer therapies (33Nava V.E. Cuvillier O. Edsall L.C. Kimura K. Milstien S. Gelmann E.P. Spiegel S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4468-4474PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, overexpression of SphK2 in these cells also markedly increased cell death because of serum withdrawal and the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, as well as the DNA-damaging drugs doxorubicin and etoposide (Fig. 1C). S1P and activation of SphK1 have also been implicated in NGF-mediated neuronal survival (23Edsall L.C. Cuvillier O. Twitty S. Spiegel S. Milstien S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1573-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Similar to previous studies (23Edsall L.C. Cuvillier O. Twitty S. Spiegel S. Milstien S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1573-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 36Edsall L.C. Pirianov G.G. Spiegel S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6952-6960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), overexpression of SphK1, or addition of S1P, but not dihydro-S1P, suppressed apoptosis of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells induced by trophic factor withdrawal (Fig. 2A). In sharp contrast, expression of SphK2 enhanced apoptosis induced by serum deprivation (Fig. 2A). Even in the presence of 2% serum or nerve growth factor, which protect nal̈ve PC12 cells from serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis, ectopic expression of SphK2 was still strongly apoptotic (Fig. 2B). Moreover, SphK2 fused to GFP, which has the same sphingosine phosphorylating activity as wild type SphK2 (data not shown), also induced apoptosis to a similar extent of PC12 cells cultured in the presence of 2% serum or NGF (Fig. 2B). Because overexpression of SphK1 markedly enhanced growth of many types of cells and increased the proportion of cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle (20Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L.C. Nava V.

In agreement with previous reports (20Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L.C. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 30Xia P.

In contrast however, transfection of SphK2 not only reduced DNA synthesis in serum-starved cells, it also significantly reduced DNA synthesis induced by several concentrations of serum (Fig. 3, A, B, and C). SphK2-induced Apoptosis Is Independent of S1PR Activation—Mitochondria are a key regulatory element of stress-induced apoptosis as release of cytochrome c and its subsequent complex with cytosolic Apaf-1 leads to activation of caspase-9 that in turn activates caspase-3 (37Reed J.C. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). SphK2 increased release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol and activated caspase-3 as determined by processing to the p17 form (Fig. 4), which preceded the appearance of fragmented nuclei after 24 h. Moreover, SphK2 expression induced a time-dependent increase of caspase activity, as measured with the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC, in NIH 3T3 cells after serum deprivation or treatment with C2-ceramide or doxorubicin (Fig. 5A) and in PC12 cells after serum withdrawal (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5SphK2 enhances caspase activation because of trophic factor withdrawal. A, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts stably expressing empty vector (open bars) or SphK2 (filled bars) were cultured for 24 h in 10% fetal bovine serum in the absence or presence of doxorubicin (DOXO, 1 μg/ml), or in serum-free media in the absence or presence of C2-ceramide (5 μm). Activation of DEVD-specific caspases was measured by the cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC. For all treatments except serum, p ≤ 0.01 for SphK2 transfectants compared with vector transfected cells. B, extracts from vector (open circles) and SphK2 (filled squares) PC12 cell transfectants were prepared at the indicated times after trophic factor withdrawal, and DEVDase activity was measured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the most well known functions of S1P, the product of SphK2, are elicited by binding to S1P1-5, it was of interest to examine whether they are involved in SphK2-mediated apoptosis. To this end, we utilized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from single or double S1P2/S1P3 knock-out mice (34Ishii I. Ye X. Friedman B. Kawamura S. Contos J.J. Kingsbury M.A. Yang A.H.

Serum deprivation-induced apoptosis of MEFs was clearly evident after 24 h, and deletion of S1P2, S1P3, or both, did not have a significant effect (Fig. 6, A and B). In agreement with previous results with wild type MEFs (9Rosenfeldt H.M. Hobson J.P. Maceyka M. Olivera A. Nava V.E. Milstien S. Spiegel S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2649-2659Crossref PubMed"

In this study, we examined the expression and functional aspects of the third PGES enzyme, mPGES-2, in mammalian cells and tissues. mPGES-2 was synthesized as a Golgi membrane-associated protein, and spontaneous cleavage of the N-terminal hydrophobic domain led to the formation of a truncated mature protein that was distributed in the cytosol with a trend to be enriched in the perinuclear region. In several cell lines, mPGES-2 promoted PGE2 production via both COX-1 and COX-2 in the immediate and delayed responses with modest COX-2 preference. In contrast to the marked inducibility of mPGES-1, mPGES-2 was constitutively expressed in various cells and tissues and was not increased appreciably during tissue inflammation or damage. Interestingly, a considerable elevation of mPGES-2 expression was observed in human colorectal cancer. Collectively, mPGES-2 is a unique PGES that can be coupled with both COXs and may play a role in the production of the PGE2 involved in both tissue homeostasis and disease.

E2, which is produced by a variety of cells and tissues and exhibits diverse bioactivities, is mediated by three enzymatic reactions involving phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase (COX), and PGE synthase (PGES). In this biosynthetic pathway, arachidonic acid (AA) released from membrane phospholipids by cytosolic or secretory PLA2s is converted to PGH2 by COX-1 or COX-2 and is then isomerized to PGE2 by terminal PGES enzymes. The constitutive COX-1 mainly promotes immediate PG production elicited by agonists promptly mobilizing intracellular Ca2+, a situation in which a burst release of AA occurs (1Murakami M. Nakatani Y.

The inducible COX-2 is essential for delayed PG generation induced by proinflammatory stimuli, during which AA is gradually supplied over long periods, and also promotes immediate PG production if it already exists in cells primed by particular stimuli (1Murakami M.

A cytosolic form of PGES (cPGES) is ubiquitously and constitutively expressed in cells and is an accessory protein for the molecular chaperone Hsp90 (15Tanioka T. Nakatani Y. Semmyo N. Murakami M.

This enzyme, in cooperation with Hsp90, converts COX-1-derived PGH2 to PGE2 in a situation where high concentrations of AA are promptly supplied by strong activation of cytosolic PLA2. Recently, a third PGES, which shows broad specificity of thiol requirement, was purified from the microsomal fraction of bovine heart (27Watanabe K. Kurihara K. Suzuki T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and the whole sequences of the human and monkey enzymes were determined (28Tanikawa N. Ohmiya Y. Ohkubo H. Hashimoto K. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Ito S. Watanabe K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This enzyme, designated mPGES-2, has an N-terminal hydrophobic domain followed by a glutaredoxin or thioredoxin homology region. The N-terminal 22 amino acid sequence of the purified bovine enzyme was identical to residues 88–109 of the full-length mPGES-2 protein predicted from its cDNA, suggesting the occurrence of proteolytic cleavage at this position. The full-length and N-terminally truncated mPGES-2 proteins expressed by a bacterial expression system displayed similar PGES activity in vitro (28Tanikawa N. Ohmiya Y. Ohkubo H. Hashimoto K. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Ito S. Watanabe K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), indicating that the N-terminal hydrophobic region is dispensable for its enzymatic function. However, it has remained obscure whether this protein indeed acts as a functional PGES in mammalian cells and, if so, how the expression of this protein is regulated. In this paper, we report the cellular PGE2 biosynthetic function and tissue expression of mPGES-2 in comparison with those of mPGES-1. We provide evidence that mPGES-2 undergoes N-terminal cleavage during protein maturation in the Golgi membrane, is coupled with both COX-1 and COX-2 leading to PGE2 production, and is expressed relatively constitutively, rather than inducibly, in various cells and tissues. Moreover, immunohistochemical analyses of mPGES-1 and mPGES-2 in human tissues with various diseases allowed us to speculate on their general roles in human pathophysiology.

After culture for an appropriate period with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-(-)-thiogalactopyranoside, cells were spun down, freeze-thawed, and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 μg/ml antipain, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After sonication and centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g, the resulting supernatant was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl (TBS) and 1 mm EDTA overnight. Then the dialyzed sample was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Novagen), and the bound proteins were eluted with 40–80 mm imidazole at a flow rate of 10 ml/h. Fractions containing pure His6-tagged mPGES-2 protein were collected and dialyzed against PBS. The purified protein gave a single band with a predicted size on SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. New Zealand White rabbits (male, 1 kg; Saitama Animal Center) were immunized subcutaneously with the purified mPGES-2-del-N protein (0.3 mg each) mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant (Difco). After several booster immunizations with Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Difco) at 2-week intervals, blood was collected, and the serum titer was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting with recombinant mPGES-2-del-N protein as purified above. The specific binding of the antibody to mPGES-2 was verified by immunoblotting using mPGES-2-transfected mammalian cell lines (see below) in comparison with parental cells. Transfection Studies—Transfection of cDNAs into HEK293 cells was performed by lipofection as described previously (4Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3103-3115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 14Murakami M. Naraba H. Tanioka T. Semmyo N. Nakatani Y. Kojima F. Ikeda T. Fueki M. Ueno A. Oh-Ishi S.

Briefly, 1 μg of plasmid (the N-terminally FLAG-tagged full-length mPGES-2 (mPGES-2-FL) in pCMV-Tag2 (Stratagene), FLAG-tagged, N-terminally truncated mPGES-2 (mPGES-2-del-N) in pCDNA3.1/hyg (+), and COX-1 or -2 in pCDNA3.1/neo (+)) was mixed with 2 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 in 100 μl of Opti-MEM medium for 30 min and then added to cells that had attained 40–60% confluence in 12-well plates (Iwaki Glass) containing 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM. After incubation for 6 h, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of fresh culture medium. After overnight culture, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of fresh medium, and culture was continued at 37 °C in an incubator flushed with 5% CO2 in humidified air. To obtain stable transfectants, the cells were cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates in culture medium containing appropriate antibiotics (5 μg/ml hygromycin or 1 mg/ml geneticin). After culture for 3–4 weeks, wells containing a single colony were chosen, and the expression of each protein was monitored by RNA blotting and/or Western blotting. The established clones were expanded and used for the experiments described below. To establish BEAS-2B cells stably expressing COX-1 or COX-2, their cDNAs in pCDNA3.1/neo (+) were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000, and the geneticin-resistant clones were selected in a similar way. C-terminally FLAG-tagged mPGES-1 and N-terminally FLAG-tagged mPGES-2-del-N cDNAs were transfected into BEAS-2B and 3Y1 cells with the ViraPower lentiviral expression system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the FLAG-tagged mPGES-1 or mPGES-2-del-N cDNA insert was amplified by PCR with the Advantage cDNA polymerase mix (Clontech) and was subcloned into the pLenti6/V4-D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was transfected into 293FT cells (Invitrogen) with LipofectAMINE 2000, and an aliquot of the supernatant harvested 3 days after transfection was then added to BEAS-2B and 3Y1 cells. The cells were cultured in the presence of 30 μg/ml blastcidin, and the surviving cells that expressed appropriate levels of mPGES-1 or mPGES-2-del-N proteins were used in subsequent studies. Construction of mPGES-2 Mutant—To construct the catalytically inactive mutant mPGES-2-CS, in which cysteine residues in the thioredoxin/glutaredoxin motif have been replaced by serine residues (31Watanabe K. Ohkubo H. Niwa H. Tanikawa N. Koda N. Ito S. Ohmiya Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), mismatched PCR was conducted with the Advantage cDNA polymerase mix, as reported previously (14Murakami M. Naraba H. Tanioka T. Semmyo N. Nakatani Y. Kojima F. Ikeda T. Fueki M. Ueno A. Oh-Ishi S. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32783-32792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). The primers used for construction of the mutant were as follows. FLAG-del-N primer, 5′-CACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGAGCGCTCAGCAGTGCAGCTC-3′ (FLAG sequence underlined), m2-3′ primer, 5′-TCAGTGCGCTGGGGAGGCCTCG-3′; CS-S primer, 5′-TACAAGACGAGTCCCTTCAGCAGCAAGG-3′; and CS-AS primer, 5′-CCTTGCTGCTGAAGGGACTCGTCTTGTA-3′. The first PCR was performed with a set of FLAG-del-N and CS-AS primers and a set of CS-S and m2-3′ primers with mPGES-2 cDNA as a template. The resulting fragments were mixed, annealed, and then subjected to a second PCR with a set of FLAG-del-N and m2-3′ primers. The PCR conditions were 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The resulting fragment was purified by the Wizard SV gel and PCR clean-up system (Promega), subcloned into the pLenti6/V4-D-TOPO vector, and sequenced with an autofluorometric DNA sequencer 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) to confirm the mutation. The plasmid was then transfected into COX-2-expressing HEK293 cells with the ViraPower lentiviral expression system, and virus-infected cells were selected by culturing with blastcidin, as noted above. RNA Blotting—Approximately equal amounts (5–10 μg as required for experiments) of total RNA obtained from the cells were applied to separate lanes of 1.2% (w/v) formaldehyde-agarose gels, electrophoresed, and transferred to Immobilon-N membranes (Millipore). The resulting blots were then probed with the respective cDNA probes that had been labeled with [32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) by random priming (Takara Biomedicals). All hybridizations were carried out as described previously (4Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. Kudo I. J. Biol.

Western Blotting—Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 7.5 (for COXs) or 12.5% (for mPGESs) gels under reducing conditions. The separated proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) with a semi-dry blotter (MilliBlot-SDE system; Millipore). After blocking with 3% (w/v) skim milk in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS/Tween), the membranes were probed with the respective antibodies (1:5,000 dilution in TBS/Tween for COX-2, mPGES-1, and mPGES-2; 1:20,000 dilution for COX-1 and FLAG epitope) for 2 h, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (for mPGES-1 and mPGES-2), anti-goat (for COXs), or anti-mouse (for FLAG) antibody (1:5,000 dilution in TBS/Tween) for 2 h, and were visualized with the ECL Western blot system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (4Murakami M.

https://openalex.org/W2010325815,"Predictive analysis using publicly available yeast functional genomics and proteomics data suggests that many more proteins may be involved in biogenesis of ribonucleoproteins than are currently known. Using a microarray that monitors abundance and processing of noncoding RNAs, we analyzed 468 yeast strains carrying mutations in protein-coding genes, most of which have not previously been associated with RNA or RNP synthesis. Many strains mutated in uncharacterized genes displayed aberrant noncoding RNA profiles. Ten factors involved in noncoding RNA biogenesis were verified by further experimentation, including a protein required for 20S pre-rRNA processing (Tsr2p), a protein associated with the nuclear exosome (Lrp1p), and a factor required for box C/D snoRNA accumulation (Bcd1p). These data present a global view of yeast noncoding RNA processing and confirm that many currently uncharacterized yeast proteins are involved in biogenesis of noncoding RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1995430085,"One of the most intriguing aspects of mitosis is the ability of kinetochores to hold onto plus ends of microtubules that are actively gaining or losing tubulin subunits. Here, we show that CLASP1, a microtubule-associated protein, localizes preferentially near the plus ends of growing spindle microtubules and is also a component of a kinetochore region that we term the outer corona. A truncated form of CLASP1 lacking the kinetochore binding domain behaves as a dominant negative, leading to the formation of radial arrays of microtubule bundles that are highly resistant to depolymerization. Microinjection of CLASP1-specific antibodies suppresses microtubule dynamics at kinetochores and throughout the spindle, resulting in the formation of monopolar asters with chromosomes buried in the interior. Incubation with microtubule-stabilizing drugs rescues the kinetochore association with microtubule plus ends at the periphery of the asters. Our data suggest that CLASP1 is required at kinetochores for attached microtubules to exhibit normal dynamic behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2009885873,"The mature serine protease Omi/HtrA2 is released from the mitochondria into the cytosol during apoptosis. Suppression of Omi/HtrA2 by RNA interference in human cell lines reduces cell death in response to TRAIL and etoposide. In contrast, ectopic expression of mature wildtype Omi/HtrA2, but not an active site mutant, induces potent caspase activation and apoptosis. In vitro assays demonstrated that Omi/HtrA2 could degrade inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). Consistent with this observation, increased expression of Omi/HtrA2 in cells increases degradation of XIAP, while suppression of Omi/HtrA2 by RNA interference has an opposite effect. Combined, our data demonstrate that IAPs are substrates for Omi/HtrA2, and their degradation could be a mechanism by which the mitochondrially released Omi/HtrA2 activates caspases during apoptosis.

Some IAPs, such as human XIAP, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2, and Drosophila DIAP1 and DIAP2, also contain C-terminal RING domains. The RING domain is important for ubiquitination and proteosome degradation of IAPs and IAP-associated proteins (reviewed in Refs. 5Salvesen G.S. Duckett C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Both Smac/Diablo and Omi/HtrA2 are synthesized as precursor proteins with N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal peptides that are removed during maturation in the mitochondria to expose their N-terminal IBM. During apoptosis both proteins are released from the intermembrane space of the mitochondria into the cytoplasm and promote caspase activation and apoptosis by binding to the BIR3 domain of XIAP (11Hegde R.

Unlike Smac/Diablo, Omi/HtrA2 is a serine protease with a high degree of homology to the bacterial heat inducible serine protease HtrA/DegP (16Clausen T. Southan C. Ehrmann M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 17Maurizi M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In bacteria DegP aids in the degradation or refolding of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the periplasmic space. The high degree of similarity between bacterial HtrA/DegP and mammalian Omi/HtrA2 suggests that the later might also have a similar function in the mitochondria. However, very little is known about the protease activity or substrates of Omi/HtrA2 after its release from the mitochondria during cell death. In this report we provide evidence demonstrating for the first time that IAPs are substrates for Omi/HtrA2 and their degradation could be a mechanism by which Omi/HtrA2 activates caspases and induces cell death. Cell Culture—Cells were cultured either in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (HeLa cells) or DMEM/F-12 (293T cells) or RPMI 1640 (MCF-7 cells) (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 μg·ml–1 penicillin and 100 μg·ml–1 streptomycin sulfate. Expression Constructs—Expression constructs for Omi/HtrA2 variants and IAPs were described before (11Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R. Cilenti L. DuBois G. Lazebnik Y.

RNA Interference—Cells were seeded in 6-well or 12-well plates and then transfected with nonspecific small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex (UGU UGU UUG AGG GGA ACG G TT) or Omi-specific siRNA duplex (GGC AAG GGG AGU UUG UUG UTT) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer's recommendations. 48 h after the transfection cells were either treated with TRAIL (100 ng/ml) for 6 h or etoposide (100 μm) for 24 h. Cells were collected for immunoblot analysis. A duplicate set of cells was stained with annexin V and propidium iodide as per the manufacturer's recommendations (Clontech) to assay for cell death. Dead cells in each field (annexin V and/or propidium iodide-positive) were counted using fluorescence microscopy. The total number of cells (live plus dead) in each field was counted by light microscopy. The percentage of cell death in each experiment was calculated from the values of dead cells divided on total cells. Data represent mean values ± S.D. of three independent experiments. In Vitro Protease Assay—The protease activity of Omi was assayed with in vitro translated 35S-labeled XIAP, c-IAP1, or c-IAP2 as substrates. Bacterially expressed Omi/HtrA2 was purified on Talon affinity resins and then incubated with 35S-labeled proteins in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2,1mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA with protease inhibitors in a total 20-μl reaction. The cleavage products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Endogenous Omi/HtrA2 was isolated by immunoprecpitation from 293T S100 extracts. The S100 extracts were incubated with Omi polyclonal antibody (made in the laboratory) for 1 h. After incubation, the Omi-antibody complexes were bound to protein G-Sepharose and washed several times. The protein G-Sepharose-bound complexes were incubated with 35S-labeled XIAP in buffer A for 1 h at 37 °C in a total 20-μl reaction. The cleavage products were analyzed as outlined above. Omi/HtrA2-induced Cell Death Assay—The ability of Omi/HtrA2 variants to induce cell death in transfected cells was assayed as described previously (11Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R. Cilenti L. DuBois G. Lazebnik Y. Zervos A.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). 293T cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well and then transfected with 0.4 μg of pEG-FPN1 reporter plasmid (Clontech) and 1.0 μg of empty vector or constructs encoding Omi/HtrA2 variants using the LipofectAMINE™ method. After 36 h of transfection normal and apoptotic GFP-expressing cells were counted using fluorescence microscopy. The percentage of cell death in each experiment was calculated from the values of dead cells divided on total cells. Data represent mean values ± S.D. of three independent experiments. DEVD Cleavage Assay—To assay caspase activity in 293T S-100 extracts (50 mg), an equal amount of the extracts were incubated with 100 μm DEVD-AFC fluorogenic substrate for 60 min at 37 °C. The amount of cleaved AFC was measured using 400 and 505 nm as the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Results were expressed as DEVD cleavage activity in relative fluorescence units. The data represent the average of three independent experiments. Suppression of Omi/HtrA2 by RNA Interference Suppresses Cell Death—Treatment of cancer cell lines with death stimuli causes the release of Omi/HtrA2 from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm (11Hegde R.

To evaluate the role of Omi/HtrA2 in the extrinsic (TRAIL) or intrinsic (etoposide) cell death pathways we used Omi/HtrA2-specific siRNA oligonucleotides to reduce the protein level of Omi/HtrA2 in HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells (Fig. 1A). Transfection of these cells with Omi/HtrA2-specific siRNA-resulted in almost 40–50% reduction in the extent of TRAIL- or etoposide-induced cell death compared with untransfected or control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 1, B and C). These results indicate that Omi/HtrA2 plays an important proapoptotic role in the extrinsic and intrinsic cell death pathways in cancer cell lines. Mature Omi/HtrA2 Can Promote Caspase Activation and Cell Death—Recent results suggest that the serine protease activity of Omi/HtrA2 could be responsible for its potent killing activity (18Li W. Srinivasula S.M. Chai J. Li P. Wu J.W. Zhang Z. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To determine whether Omi/HtrA2 protease activity can activate the caspase pathway, we measured caspase activity in 293T cells transfected with constructs encoding mature wildtype or active site mutant Omi/HtrA2 proteins. Expression of mature wild type, but not the active site mutant, Omi/HtrA2 resulted in significant caspase activation (Fig. 2A). This enhanced caspase activation was associated with increased cell death (Fig. 2B). Similar results were observed in MCF-7 and HeLa cell lines (Ref. 11Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R. Cilenti L. DuBois G. Lazebnik Y. Zervos A.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar and data not shown). These results suggest that the ability of Omi/HtrA2 to promote caspase activation and cell death in transfected cells is largely dependent on its serine protease activity. Omi/HtrA2 Can Degrade IAPs in Vitro—Western blot analysis revealed that expression of mature wild type Omi/HtrA2, but not an active site mutant protein, results in significant reduction in the amount of XIAP in the transfected cells (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that degradation of XIAP by Omi/HtrA2 could be responsible for this effect. To test this hypothesis we first determined the physiological concentration of Omi/HtrA2 in 293T and HeLa cells by immunoblot analysis with Omi/HtrA2 antibodies. The concentration of Omi/HtrA2 in 293 was found to be ∼150 nm and in HeLa cells ∼60 nm. Next we assayed the activity of physiological amounts of recombinant Omi/HtrA2 with 35S-labeled XIAP, c-IAP1, or c-IAP2 as substrates. As shown in Fig. 3A, physiological amounts of Omi/HtrA2 were able to degrade these IAPs in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with these results, physiological amounts of endogenous Omi/HtrA2 protein isolated by immunoprecipitation from 293T cells were also able to degrade XIAP in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that IAPs are physiological substrates for Omi/HtrA2 protein. Next we tested the effect of Omi/HtrA2 on the ability of IAPs to inhibit caspase activation in S100 extracts stimulated with cytochrome c and dATP (Fig. 3C). Incubation of XIAP with mature wildtype Omi resulted in a large dose-dependent reduction in the inhibitory activity of XIAP. Similar results were obtained with the active site mutant Omi/HtrA2-S306A. In contrast, incubation of XIAP with protease active Omi/HtrA2 without its IAP binding motif (ΔAVPS) did not cause significant reduction in the inhibitory activity of XIAP. Western blot analysis showed that XIAP is degraded in the reaction mixtures containing wildtype Omi/HtrA2 and Omi/HtrA2 ΔAVPS, but not Omi/HtrA2-S306A. The IAP binding motif of Omi/HtrA2 seems to enhance its ability to cleave XIAP, because the Omi/HtrA2 ΔAVPS was less efficient in cleaving XIAP. In addition, a distinct pattern of cleavage was observed with the wildtype Omi/HtrA2 compared with Omi/HtrA2 ΔAVPS. Nevertheless, the cleavage products generated by Omi/HtrA2 ΔAVPS were able to inhibit caspases, indicating that cleavage alone might not be sufficient for inactivation of XIAP. These interesting results suggest that the presence of the IAP binding motif enhances the ability of Omi/HtrA2 to cleave and disrupt the association of the cleavage products of XIAP with caspases. In contrast, in the absence of the IAP binding motif, Omi/HtrA2 cleaves XIAP less efficiently at multiple sites and is not able to disrupt the association of the cleavage products with caspases. IAP Degradation during Apoptosis Is Dependent on Omi/HtrA2 Expression Levels—To provide additional support for the role of Omi/HtrA2 in IAP-degradation we decreased the expression levels of Omi/HtrA2 in the mitochondria by transfection of MCF-7 cells with Omi/HtrA2-specific or nonspecific siRNAs and then treated the cells with etoposide for different periods of time. Less IAP degradation was observed in cells transfected with the Omi-specific siRNA compared with the cells transfected with the nonspecific siRNA (Fig. 4). Taken together, these results indicate that Omi/HtrA2 plays a direct role in the degradation of IAPs during cell death. IAP degradation is an important mechanism for caspase activation during developmental and perhaps p53-induded cell death in Drosophila (5Salvesen G.S. Duckett C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar, 6Martin S.J. Cell. 2002; 109: 793-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 19Steller H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E100-E102Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Drosophila DIAP1 destruction is stimulated by binding of IAP-binding proteins such as Reaper, which is induced during development or DNA damage, to the BIR2 domain of DIAP1. This binding induces autoubiquitination of DIAP1, which targets it for degradation by the proteosomal pathways. So far, a similar mechanism of IAP destruction has not been identified in mammalian cells during cell death. However, recent results demonstrated that c-IAP1 is cleaved in human HeLa cells during p53-dependent apoptosis by a serine protease (20Jin S. Kalkum M. Overholtzer M. Stoffel A. Chait B.T. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Based on results showing up-regulation of Omi/HtrA2 mRNA by p53, it was suggested that Omi/HtrA2 could be responsible for the observed degradation of c-IAP1 during p53-dependent apoptosis (20Jin S. Kalkum M. Overholtzer M. Stoffel A. Chait B.T. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Our biochemical and cellular data indicate that XIAP is also degraded in human cancer cell lines during cell death. Omi/HtrA2 appears to be directly responsible for degradation of XIAP, since increased level of Omi/HtrA2 induces more degradation (Fig. 2C), while decreased level has an opposite effect (Fig. 4). In addition, purified Omi/HtrA2 can directly degrade XIAP and other human IAPs in vitro (Fig. 3). The new results also indicate that the IAP binding motif of Omi/HtrA2 is important for efficient cleavage of IAPs at distinct sites and for disruption of the association between caspases and the IAP fragments. In the absence of the IAP-binding motif, Omi/HtrA2 can still cleave IAPs with less efficiency but is unable to disrupt the association between caspases and the IAP fragments. Thus, the presence of the IAP-binding motif enhances the ability of Omi/HtrA2 to find and destroy IAPs after its release from the mitochondria into the cytosol during mammalian cell death. Although the level of XIAP was reduced by the transfected wild type Omi/HtrA2, there were no XIAP fragments detectable in the cellular extracts of the transfected cells (Fig. 2B). In contrast multiple fragments were detectable in vitro after incubation of Omi/HtrA2 with IAPs (Fig. 3). These interesting results suggest that in cells, the Omi/HtrA2-generated IAP fragments could be targeted for further degradation by the N-end rule degradation pathway. This is consistent with recent results, which demonstrated that caspase-cleavage of the Drosophila DIAP1 makes it unstable and targets it for degradation by the N-end rule degradation pathway (21Ditzel M. Wilson R. Tenev T. Zachariou A. Paul A. Deas E. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Thus Omi/HtrA2 could promote apoptosis in mammalian cells by two mechanisms. One mechanism relies on its IAP-binding motif to bind to IAPs and disrupts association of active caspases with IAPs, and the other mechanism relies on its protease activity to cleave bound IAPs and targets them for further degradation by the proteosomal pathways. However, both mechanisms might be necessary for efficient killing by Omi/HtrA2. This could explain why the active site mutant Omi/HtrA2-S306A can disrupts IAP-caspase association and promote caspase activation in vitro (Fig. 3C), while it is not able to induce efficient cell death or caspase activation in transfected cells (Fig. 2). Ironically, the similarity between Omi/HtrA2 and the bacterial survival chaperone-protease DegP/HtrA suggests that Omi/HtrA2 could have an important survival function in the mitochondria (16Clausen T. Southan C. Ehrmann M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 17Maurizi M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Omi/HtrA2 may protect the mitochondria against cellular stresses by recognizing unfolded or misfolded proteins in the intermembrane space and helps refold or degrade them. If this is the case, then loss of this protein could lead to accumulation of damaged proteins in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria over a long period of time. This is likely to be deleterious to mitochondrial function and increase sensitivity of cells to stress-induced cell death. These possibilities are currently under investigation. Addendum—While this paper was under review, Yang et al. (22Yang Q.H. Church-Hajduk R. Ren J. Newton M.L. Du C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) reported that IAPs are substrates for Omi/HtrA2. Their paper presents essentially the same results as ours."

Lokesh B. Broughton S. Whelan J. Nutrition. 1990; 6: 24-44PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of VLC-PUFAs in the human diet affects diverse physiological processes involved in cardiovascular, immune, neuronal, and visual functions (2Spector A.A. Lipids. 1999; 34: S1-S3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many clinical studies have linked PUFA intake with normal health and development, particularly in the case of newborns and infants (3Simopoulos A.P. Prostaglandins Leuk. Essent. Fatty Acids. 1999; 60: 421-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). VLC-PUFAs are mainly found in fish, in some fungi and lower plants, as well as in a variety of microorganisms of the phytoplankton. With the exception of the anaerobically operating polyketide synthase-like systems found in some marine bacteria and primitive eukaryotes (4Metz J.G. Roessler P. Facciotti D. Levering C. Dittrich F. Lassner M. Valentine R. Lardizabal K. Domergue F. Yamada A. Yazawa K. Knauf V. Browse J. Science. 2001; 293: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), VLC-PUFAs are synthesized by elongation and desaturation of linoleic acid (LA, 18:2Δ9,12)or α-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3Δ9,12,15) in the endoplasmic reticulum. Most algae, fungi, and lower plants producing VLC-PUFAs possess the entire biosynthetic pathway to synthesize these fatty acids from acetate, whereas mammalia, which lack Δ12- and Δ15-desaturases, use as precursors LA and ALA that have to be supplied in their diet and thus are essential fatty acids. The numerous health benefits attributed to VLC-PUFAs as well as the absence of sustainable and low cost sources has led to the long-term goal of producing such fatty acids in transgenic oilseed crops (5Abbadi A. Domergue F. Meyer A. Riedel K. Sperling P. Zank T.K. Heinz E. Eur. J. Lipid Sci. Technol. 2001; 103: 106-113Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Using organisms producing VLC-PUFAs such as the fungus Mortierella alpina, the moss Physcomitrella patens, the worm Caenorhaditis elegans, and the diatom Phaeo-dactylum tricornutum as gene sources, a large collection of sequences coding for elongases and desaturases was created in the last 10 years (reviewed in Ref. 6Drexler H.

Each coding sequence was separately expressed in yeast or plant and the substrate specificity of the encoded enzyme verified so that cDNAs encoding all the enzymatic activities required for DHA synthesis are available. The fatty acid desaturases involved in VLC-PUFA biosynthesis can be divided into two groups, the ω6-/ω3-desaturases and the so-called front-end desaturases (7Aitzetmüller K. Tsevegsüren N. J. Plant. Physiol. 1994; 143: 538-543Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which contain a cytochrome b 5-domain fused to their N terminus (8Sperling P. Heinz E. Eur. J. Lipid Sci. Technol. 2001; 103: 158-180Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Whereas the latter group of desaturases inserts the new double bond between the fatty acid carboxyl group and a pre-existing double bond, the ω6-/ω3-desaturases insert it between a pre-existing double bond and the fatty acid methyl end. Using alkenylether glycerolipids and tomato cell cultures, it was unambiguously proven that plant ω6- and ω3-desaturases are acting on lipid-linked substrates (9Sperling P. Linscheid M. Stocker S.

In addition, biochemical studies with plants and fungi strongly suggest that ω6-desaturases are acting on both positions (sn-1 and sn-2) of phosphatidylcholine (PC), whereas Δ6-desaturases are confined to the sn-2 position of PC (10Galle-Le Bastard A.M.

In contrast to the fatty acid desaturases involved in VLC-PUFA biosynthesis, the elongation activities remain to be biochemically characterized. Elongation of PUFAs has been linked to ELO sequences. ELO-type proteins were first characterized in yeast, where ELO1 is involved in the elongation of medium-chain saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, whereas ELO2 and ELO3 catalyze the subsequent elongation yielding the C24–26 saturated fatty acids present in sphingolipids (15Oh C.S.

Zähringer U. Beckmann C. Pohnert G. Boland W. Holtorf H. Reski R. Lerchl J. Heinz E. Plant J. 2002; 31: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and their involvement in the elongation of PUFAs was demonstrated by expression in yeast. Nevertheless, so far there is no unequivocal evidence that any polypeptide encoded by an ELO sequence catalyzes the actual condensation reaction involved in fatty acid elongation. Compared with the poorly described elongation of PUFAs, the elongation of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids has been extensively characterized biochemically in both plant and rat liver microsomes. Each C2 elongation is a four-step process (condensation-reduction-dehydration-reduction), which involves four different enzymes, most probably organized in a multifunctional complex. The rate-limiting step of this process is the condensation of the acyl primer with malonyl-CoA catalyzed by the β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS or FAE for fatty acid elongation), which also confers substrate specificity to the whole elongase complex. Expression of the KCS/FAE condensing enzyme or of an ELO-type protein alone is sufficient to restore elongation activity in yeast, suggesting that the three other enzymes are ubiquitously expressed. Recently, using an Arabidopsis thaliana KCS/FAE condensing enzyme purified nearly to homogeneity, Ghanevati and Jaworski (21Ghanevati M. Jaworski J.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) measured high in vitro activities with various acyl-CoAs, indicating that acyl-CoAs are most probably the substrates of this type of elongase. Since the elongation process condenses an acyl-CoA primer with malonyl-CoA and finally results in the production of a C2-elongated acyl-CoA, the entire elongation process most probably takes place within the acyl-CoA pool. When the biosynthesis of VLC-PUFAs was reconstituted in yeast by co-expressing the Δ6-desaturase from Borago officinalis, the Δ6-elongase from C. elegans and the Δ5-desaturase from M. alpina in the presence of LA or ALA, small but significant amounts of ARA and EPA, respectively, were detected (18Beaudoin F. Michaelson L.V. Hey S.J. Lewis M.J. Shewry P.R. Sayanova O. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6421-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We obtained similar results by co-expressing the Δ5- and Δ6-desaturases from P. tricornutum together with the Δ6-elongase from P. patens (22Bröker M. Bauml O. Gottig A. Ochs J. Bodenbenner M. Amann E. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1991; 34: 756-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Despite this success, these reconstitution experiments were rather inefficient compared with the situation in the genuine organisms and regarding the relatively high activities measured with the separately expressed enzymes. A closer look at the activities of the different enzymes expressed to reconstitute VLC-PUFAs biosynthesis in yeast showed that the elongation of endogenously produced Δ6-fatty acids was less than half that observed with exogenously supplied Δ6-fatty acids. These results suggest a great difference in the availability of exogenously added or in situ produced Δ6-fatty acids for elongation: in contrast to exogenously supplied fatty acids, those produced endogenously by Δ6-desaturation may remain in a pool that is not available for elongation, which consequently limits VLC-PUFAs biosynthesis. In the present work we sought to identify which acyl carriers could be used as substrate by the different enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of ARA reconstituted in S. cerevisiae. In view of the data presented above, special attention was paid to phosphatidylcholine and the acyl-CoA pool. Using cDNAs from various organisms, the four activities leading to the synthesis of arachidonic acid from oleic acid (Δ12-desaturase, Δ6-desaturase, Δ6-elongase, and Δ5-desaturase) were expressed in yeast separately or in combination. After short or long incubation times, the fatty acid profiles of various lipid pools were determined in order to evaluate which acyl carriers are preferentially used by the different desaturases and the elongase. Materials—Restriction enzymes, polymerases, and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Bioloabs (Frankfurt, Germany) unless indicated otherwise. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Construction of Vectors—The different fatty acid desaturases and yeast expression constructs used in this study are listed in Table I. Usually, complete open reading frames (ORF) were modified by PCR to create appropriate restriction sites adjacent to the start and stop codons. The amplified DNAs were cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) before being released and cloned into a yeast expression vector (pVT102-U, pYES2 or pESC-LEU) using the restriction sites inserted by PCR.Table IFatty acid desaturases used in this studySource organismRegio-specificityGenBank™ Accession No.Yeast expression vectorRestriction sites usedSource Ref.Phaeodactylum tricornutumΔ5AY082392pESC-LEU-PSEISpeI/SacI(22Bröker M.

Transformation, selection and growth of the transgenic yeast cells have already been described (23Domergue F. Lerchl J. Zähringer U. Heinz E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4105-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). When the cultures had reached an OD600 of about 0.2, expressions were induced by supplementing galactose (2%, w/v) and the appropriate fatty acids to a final concentration of 500 μm. All cultures were then grown for another 24 or 48 h at 20 or 30 °C, as indicated, and harvested by centrifugation. For short time pulses, cultures were grown for 24 h at 30 °C, reaching an OD600 of about 1.5, before the exogenous fatty acid was added. After 1 min, 2.2-ml aliquots were harvested and the cells sedimented by short centrifugation (20 s). After removal of the supernatant, the cell pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until needed. Lipid Analysis—Lipid analysis of transgenic yeast cells were made from 150-ml cultures grown for 24 h at 20 °C unless otherwise indicated. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 30 ml of 0.1 m NaHCO3 and the lipids were extracted on a shaker for 4 h with 15 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and then for 20 h with 15 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1). The resulting organic phase was extracted with 9 ml of 0.45% NaCl, dried with Na2SO4, and evaporated under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in 2 ml of chloroform and corresponded to the total lipid extract. The major lipid classes PC (phosphatidylcholine), PI+PS (phosphatidylinositol and -serine), PE (phosphatidylethanolamine) and NL (neutral lipids) were purified by thin layer chromatography using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:35:8; v/v/v) as solvent mixture. The different spots were scraped off the plate and the lipids were extracted from silica by adding successively 400 μl of water, 2 ml of methanol, and 2 ml of chloroform and vigorously shaking. After adding 2 ml of 0.2 m H3PO4/1 m KCl, the organic phase was extracted and the resulting aqueous phase re-extracted with 2 ml of chloroform. Both organic phases were combined, dried with Na2SO4 and evaporated under argon. The residues dissolved in 2 ml of chloroform corresponded to the different lipid fractions. For quantification, an aliquot of the total lipid extract was resolved by thin layer chromatography using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:35:8; v/v/v) as solvent mixture. After drying, the plate was dipped in 10% CuSO4 in 8% (v/v) phosphoric acid, dried at 100 °C and heated to 178 °C until the spots appeared (24Weerheim A.M. Kolb A.M. Sturk A. Nieuwland R. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 302: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The different spots were then quantified by scanning densitometry using a CAMAG TLC Scanner 3 (CAMAG, Muttenz, Switzerland) as already described (25Grether-Beck S. Bonizzi G. Schmitt-Brenden H. Felsner I. Timmer A. Sies H. Johnson J.P. Piette J. Krutmann J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5793-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Positional Analysis—Positional analyses were conducted using the Rhizopus arrhizus lipase (26Fischer W. Heinz E. Zeus M. Hoppe Seylers Z Physiol. Chem. 1973; 354: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) from Sigma. Samples containing PC or PE in chloroform were dried under argon and resuspended in 1 ml of 0.03% Triton X-100, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 by sonication. 10,000 units of lipase were added and the digestions were conducted for 2 h at 37 °C. The aqueous phase was extracted with 2.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and then 2 ml of chloroform. The resulting organic phase was dried under argon and separated by thin layer chromatography using chloroform/methanol/aqueous ammonia (65:25:0.7; v/v/v) as solvent mix. The spots corresponding to free fatty acids and lysophospholipids were scraped and directly transmethylated for gas-liquid chromatography analysis. Total and Esterified Fatty Acid Analysis—For the analysis of total fatty acids, fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were prepared from sedimented cell pellets or lipid extracts by direct transmethylation with 0.5 m sulfuric acid in methanol containing 2% (v/v) dimethoxypropane. After 1 h at 80 °C, 0.2 ml of 5 m NaCl were added and FAMEs were extracted with 1 ml of petroleum-ether. For the analysis of esterified fatty acids, 1.35 ml of toluene/methanol (1:2, v/v), and 0.5 ml of 0.5 m NaOCH3 in methanol were successively added to sedimented cell pellets. After homogenization, samples were shaken for 1 h at room temperature before adding 2 ml of petroleum-ether and 0.4 ml of 5 m NaCl and extracting FAMEs. FAMEs were then analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography as previously described (23Domergue F. Lerchl J. Zähringer U. Heinz E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4105-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Acyl-CoA Analysis—For acyl-CoA analysis, the highly sensitive method relying on the fluorescence of etheno derivatives developed by Larson and Graham for plant tissues (27Larson T.R. Graham I.A. Plant J. 2001; 25: 115-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Frozen yeast cell pellets equivalent to 2.2 ml of yeast culture (OD600 of 1.5) were used as starting material and the extraction of acyl-CoAs was performed exactly as described (27Larson T.R. Graham I.A. Plant J. 2001; 25: 115-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After drying the extracted acyl-CoAs under argon at 50 °C, derivatization was carried out in 300 μl of chloracetaldehyde derivatization reagent (27Larson T.R. Graham I.A. Plant J. 2001; 25: 115-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 85 °C for 20 min. HPLC analysis was made using a Thermoquest HPLC system (Thermoquest, Egels-bach, Germany) equipped with a LUNA 150 × 2.0 mm column with phenylhexyl-coated 5 μm silica particles (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) under the same conditions as described by Larson et al. (28Larson T.R. Edgell T. Byrne J. Dehesh K. Graham I.A. Plant J. 2002; 32: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Acyl-CoA were identified using saturated and mono-unsaturated acyl-CoAs from Sigma or enzymatically synthesized polyunsaturated acyl-CoAs (18:2Δ9,12-, 18:3Δ6,9,12-, 20:2Δ11,14-, 20:3Δ8,11,14-, and 20:4Δ5,8,11,14-CoA) as standards. Synthesis was achieved in 200 μl reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CoASH, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μm free fatty acid, and 2.5 units of acyl-coenzyme A synthetase from Pseudomanas sp. (Sigma). After2hof incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with 50 μl of glacial acetic acid/ethanol 1:1 (v/v), and the samples were washed with petroleum ether to extract unreacted fatty acids. Acyl-CoAs were purified on a short reverse phase column (Strata C18-E, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) using acetonitrile as eluent, dried under argon, and dissolved in 50 mm MES, pH 5.0. Exogenously Supplied Fatty Acids Enter the Yeast Lipid Metabolism via the Acyl-CoA Pool—A large body of evidence suggests that exogenously supplied fatty acids enter the yeast cell by concomitant conversion to acyl-CoAs before their use for various metabolic purposes. Nevertheless, to our knowledge the time course of this conversion has not yet been studied experimentally. For a first approximate evaluation of this time scale, a yeast growing culture was pulsed for 1 min with LA before evaluating the fatty acid profile in three different fractions: the total fatty acids, the esterified fatty acids and the acyl-CoA pool (Fig. 1). These patterns were compared with control samples prepared from the same culture just before the addition of LA. Before adding LA (Fig. 1A), the fatty acid composition of total and esterified fatty acids were practically identical, indicating the absence of a significant pool of free fatty acids. The monounsaturated fatty acids (16:1 and 18:1) represented about 76% of the total fatty acids, whereas the saturated 16:0 and 18:0 accounted for about 18 and 6%, respectively. These major fatty acids were also found in the acyl-CoA pool, but in significantly different proportions. Palmitoleoyl-CoA was the major acyl-CoA species (about 36%), 16:0-CoA, 18:0-CoA, and 18:1-CoA accounted each for about 20%, and myristoyl-CoA represented less than 1%. One minute after adding LA (Fig. 1B), the profiles of the total and esterified fatty acids clearly differed, since LA represented about 50% of the total, but only 4% of the esterified acyl groups. This difference indicates that after 1 min in the presence of LA, only a very small proportion of the exogenously supplied fatty acid has already been channeled into lipids, and that most of the LA, which has been bound to and/or incorporated by the yeast cells, remains in the form of the free fatty acid. In marked contrast, the fatty acid profile of the acyl-CoA pool is dominated by LA, which represents about 60% of the acyl groups, supporting the assumption that exogenously supplied fatty acids are converted to acyl-CoAs when entering the yeast cells. These data also indicated that the acyl-CoA pool could be extensively and specifically flooded with a particular fatty acid within a very short time, enabling the possibility to detect acyl-group modifications taking place in that pool. It should be added that after 24 h, LA was still dominating the acyl-CoA pool, but that the profile of the esterified and total fatty acids were similar (data not shown), indicating that all the LA exogenously supplied had been incorporated and acylated into the yeast lipids. Elongation of GLA Takes Place in the Acyl-CoA Pool—We then used the same approach with a yeast expressing an ELO-type elongase in order to see whether the elongation of GLA takes place within the acyl-CoA pool. For this experiment, a yeast culture transformed with a construct carrying the gene of the Δ6-elongase from P. patens was grown in the presence of galactose for 24 h before adding GLA so that the elongase was present within the cells before supplying its substrate. The fatty acid composition of the three different fractions defined above were then determined before and 1 min after the addition of GLA. Before the pulse, the fatty acid profiles were similar to those reported in Fig. 1A (data not shown). After 1 min in the presence of GLA (Fig. 1C), GLA represented about 40% of the total, but only 2.5% of the esterified fatty acids, confirming the data obtained with LA. In these two fractions, the elongation product of GLA, i.e. 20:3Δ8,11,14, could not be detected. On the other hand, both GLA and 20:3Δ8,11,14 were present in high proportions in the acyl-CoA pool. Besides the predominant 16:1, each represented more than 25% of the acyl-CoA species only 1 min after the addition of GLA, reflecting an elongation of about 50% in that pool. These data strongly suggest that upon entrance into yeast cells exogenously supplied GLA is converted into GLA-CoA and thus becomes immediately available for Δ6-elongation. Next we analyzed the distribution of GLA and 20:3Δ8,11,14 in the different lipids of a yeast culture that had expressed the Δ6-elongase in the presence of GLA for 24 h.

Recently, the orphan nuclear receptor fetoprotein transcription factor/cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase promoter factor (CPF/FTF/Lrh-1) has been shown to activate Mrp3 expression. However, whether inflammatory cytokines or elevated bile acid levels increased Lrh-1/Mrp3 expression in obstructive cholestasis was not known. We hypothesized that induction of Mrp3 would be associated with Lrh-1 up-regulation and would require intact cytokine signaling. Male tumor necrosis factor (Tnf) receptor I (Tnfr–/–) mice and C57BLJ wild type (WT) controls were subjected to sham surgery or bile duct ligation. HepG2 cells were treated with bile acids or cytokines. Immunoblot assay and real time reverse transcriptase-PCR were used to determine expression of MRP3/Mrp3, CPF/Lrh-1, Mrp2, and Bsep. CPF/Lrh-1 DNA binding to the MRP3/Mrp3 promoter was assessed using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and promoter activity was determined by luciferase assay. Total bile acids and lactate dehydrogenase were measured using colorimetric assays, and cytokine abundance was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Lrh-1 and Mrp3 were significantly induced after BDL in WT but not Tnfr–/– mice. This was associated with more severe hepatocellular necrosis in Tnfr–/– mice. Lrh-1 binding to the Mrp3 promoter increased after BDL in WT but not in Tnfr–/– mice. Tnfα treatment of HepG2 cells also up-regulated CPF and MRP3, increased CPF binding to the MRP3 promoter, and up-regulated MRP3 promoter activity. These results indicate that induction of Mrp3 after BDL is due to Tnfα-dependent up-regulation of Lrh-1. They provide strong evidence that induction of Mrp3 plays a significant role in hepatocyte protection during obstructive cholestasis.

It is thought to function primarily as an inducible basolateral efflux pump for bile salts, thereby limiting hepatocellular injury and playing a significant role in hepatocyte cytoprotection during cholestasis. However, the molecular basis for this response is not known. The dramatic induction of Mrp3 seen in obstructive cholestasis indicates that substances that accumulate within the hepatocyte specifically regulate this gene. It has been reported previously that some nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) ligands including bile acids (8Ogawa K. Suzuki H. Hirohashi T. Ishikawa T. Meier P.J. Hirose K. Azikawa T. Yoshioka M. Sugiyama Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G438-G466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and phenobarbital induce Mrp3, although the specific transcriptional pathways have not been elucidated. Phenobarbital induces Mrp3 without bile acid elevation, whereas the pregnane X receptor null mouse has normal Mrp3 expression (9Staudinger J.L. Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Hawkins-Brown D. MacKenzie K.I. LaTour A. Klassen C.D. Brown K.K. Reinhard J. Willson T.M. Koller B.J. Kliewer S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3369-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar), suggesting that more than one transcriptional pathway may exist. This implies that other regulators, which may include cytokines or other potential Mrp3 substrates, may lead to induction of Mrp3. Recently, adjacent response elements for the orphan NHR, fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF/CPF/Lrh-1), have been identified in the MRP3 promoter in the intestine (10Shwu-Jen T. Huang J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 11Inokuchi A. Hinoshita E. Iwamoto Y. Kohno K. Kuwano M. Uchumi T. J. Biol.

The transcriptional function of Lrh-1 is negatively regulated by small heterodimer partner (Shp-1), which is, in turn, up-regulated by the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and its heterodimeric partner, the retinoid X receptor (RXRα) (12Goodwin B.

Hepatology. 2001; 34 (abstr.): 261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (88) Google Scholar) that BDL is associated with a rapid reduction in FXR:RXRα and Shp-1 and that this is associated with induction of Mrp3 expression. Inflammatory cytokines including Tnfα, IL1β, and IL6 are also induced after BDL, and for IL1β this induction persists at significant levels for time points up to 14 days (15Bemelmans M.H.A. Gouma D.J. Greve J.W. Burman W.A. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 16Plebani M. Panozzo M.P. Basso D. DePaoli M. Biasin R. Infantolino D. Clin. Exp.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8835-8843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) that inflammatory cholestasis induced by LPS administration is associated with a reduction of RXRα protein and target genes including Mrp2 and the basolateral bile acid transporter Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide. Moreover, we have also reported that these NHR alterations observed following BDL are associated with elevation of hepatic cytokines, in particular IL1β (18Denson L.A. Bohan A. Held M.A. Boyer J.L. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 599-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, whether bile acids and/or cytokines regulated hepatocyte nuclear Lrh-1 abundance and activity directly or indirectly via FXR:RXRα and Shp-1 down-regulation, with subsequent induction of Mrp3 expression, was not known. We hypothesized that up-regulation of hepatic Mrp3 and the severity of liver injury following BDL would be dependent upon Lrh-1 expression and intact cytokine signaling. In this study we have shown that Mrp3 may be transcriptionally regulated by Lrh-1, and the expression of both is dependent on Tnfα signaling. Our findings confirm that Mrp3 induction is hepatoprotective in obstructive cholestasis. Materials—Synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen. The primers and probes for human MRP3 and FTF and for murine Mrp3, Mrp2, Bsep, Lrh-1, FXR, RXRα, and Shp-1 were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The antibodies to Lrh-1, FXR, RXRα, actin, and Shptp1 were purchased form Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to Mrp2 and Bsep were kindly provided by D. Keppler (Heidelberg, Germany) and B. Stieger (Zurich, Switzerland), respectively. Anti-human MRP3 antibody was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego). ELISA was performed using the assay kit from Sigma. Gel shifts were performed using the digoxigenin Gel Shift Kit from Roche Applied Science. Reporter assay reagents and vectors were purchased from Invitrogen and Promega (Madison, WI). Immunoblot detection was performed using the Western blot chemiluminescence kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cell culture media and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen. Serum and tissue bile acids were assayed using a colorimetric assay from Sigma. LDH assay was performed using a commercially available kit (Roche Applied Science). All other routine biochemicals and reagents were of the highest quality commercially available and were purchased from J. T. Baker Inc., Bio-Rad, Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA), Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), Eastman Kodak Co., Invitrogen, Sigma, and Collaborative Biomedical (Bedford, MA). Bile Duct Ligation—Male TNF receptor I knockout (TnfrI–/–) mice and age-matched C57BLJ wild type (WT) controls were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories. Animals were maintained in the Yale Animal Research Center and housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment under a constant light cycle where they had free access to water. The protocol was approved by the Yale Animal Care and Use Committee, and all animals received humane care as outlined in Ref. 28National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda1985Google Scholar. Common bile duct ligation was performed under sterile conditions as described previously (4Soroka C.J. Lee J.M. Azzaroli F. Boyer J.L. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The common bile duct was exposed, ligated twice close to the hilum of the liver, immediately below the cystic duct, and then cut between the ligatures. Sham animals underwent sham surgery in which the bile duct was exposed but not ligated. The animals were exsanguinated; serum was saved, and the livers harvested 14 days after surgery. HepG2 Cell Culture and Treatment—HepG2 cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, and 1× penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen). The cells were plated (4–6 million cells/plate) on 10-cm plates (Collaborative Biomedical). Following adhesion the cells were treated with Tnfα (100 ng/ml), IL1β (100 ng/ml), IL6 (100 ng/ml), and chenodeoxycholic acid (100 μm). Control cells were treated with serum-free medium, and all cells were recovered after 24 h. Transient transfection was performed according to the LipofectAMINE 2000 method (Invitrogen). In general, HepG2 cells were plated in 12-well plates to 40–60% confluency and were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and medium was replaced with 100 μl of Opti-MEM medium before a mixture of LipofectAMINE and DNA was added to the well. 1.25 μg of reporter DNA, 100 ng of pCMVβGal (Promega, Madison, WI), and 200 ng of mouse FTF receptor expression plasmid DNA were used in each transfection experiment. Empty pcDNA3.1 expression vector was used as carrier DNA to maintain equal amounts of DNA for each transfection where required. After 12 h of transfection, the cells were cultured in serum-free minimum Eagle's medium or 1, 10, or 100 ng/ml human TNFα for 12–48 h. Then cells were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with 200 μl of Luciferase Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega). Luciferase activities were measured using Promega Luciferase assay system by luminometer and normalized by dividing the relative light units by β-galactosidase activity. Murine Hepatic Histopathology—Following organ harvest, 100-mg wedge of liver tissue was fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) and trichrome staining were performed on each sample. The histology was assessed and scored blindly, and necrosis was quantified using an Olympus IX70 microscope and ImagePro software (ImagePro Inc., Boston). Serum and Tissue Bile Acid Levels—At organ harvest, inferior vena caval serum was isolated from all animals and stored at –20 °C until analysis. Liver tissue (50 mg) was frozen in liquid nitrogen, and bile acids were extracted and measured as described previously (18Denson L.A. Bohan A. Held M.A. Boyer J.L. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 599-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 mg of frozen liver tissue was ground finely and incubated overnight at room temperature with 1:1 t-butyl alcohol/double distilled H2O. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was stored at –20 °C until analysis. All samples subsequently underwent analysis by standard enzymatic-colorimetric assay using a bile acid assay kit in accordance with the manufacturer's protocols (Sigma). The absorption of each sample was assessed by spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 530 nm (Ultrospec 3000, Amersham Biosciences). Serum Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Assay—Serum stored at –20 °C was used for this assay (20Jacobs E. Hissin P.J. Propper W. Mayer L. Sarkozi L. Clin. Biochem. 1996; 19: 183-188Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Peters T.J. Neale G. Heath J.R. Clin. Sci. Mol. Med. 1975; 48: 307-313PubMed Google Scholar), which was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, 100 μl of serum was transferred into an optically clear 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plate. To determine LDH activity, 100 μl of reaction mixture was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at 15–25 °C. The absorbance of the samples was measured at 490 nm using an ELISA reader. Real Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Analysis—RT reactions were performed on 5 μg of the isolated mouse or HepG2 RNA using established protocols and the ProSTAR RT-PCR kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). TaqMan real time quantitative PCR assay was performed on an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems). The following primers and probes were used for the TaqMan RT-PCR assay: murine Lrh1: forward, CCTCCTGAGTCTCGCACAGG, reverse, AACTCCCGCTGATCGAACTG, and probe, CTGGTGGTGAGGCTCCGTTCCCT; murine FXR: forward, AACCCACAGCATTTCGCCT, reverse, TGATGGTTGAATGTCCGGAGT, and probe, CCTCCTGGGTCGCCTGACGG; murine RXRα: forward, GAAAGATGGGATTCTCCTGGC, reverse, CCAGCACTGTGAGCGCTG, and probe, CGGCCTGCACGTACACCGGA; murine Shp-1: forward, CCCAAGGAGTATGCGTACCTG, reverse, GGCACGGAGGCCTGG and probe, AGGGCACGATCCTCTTCAACCCAGA; murine Mrp3: forward, TGAGATCGTCATTGATGGGC, and reverse, AGCTGAGAGCGCAGGTCG, and probe, CAACGTGGCACACATTGGCCTCC; murine Mrp2: forward, CGACCATCCGGAACGAGTT, reverse, GCAGCCTGTGTGCGATAGTG, and probe, CCCAGTGCACGGTCA; murine Bsep: forward, TGGGCAGAAGCAAAGGGTAG, reverse, GCAGGATCTTGGGTTTCCGT, and probe, CATCGCCCGCGCCCCTCA; human MRP3: forward, CACACGGATCTGACAGACAATGA, reverse, ACAGGGCACTCAGCTGTCTCA, and probe, CCAGTCACCTATGTGGTCCAGAAGCAGTTT; human FTF: forward, TGCACGGCAGCCTGC, reverse, TGGGTACTCAGACTTGATGGCC, and probe, AGGTTACCAAACATATGGCCACTTTCCTAGCC (all designed by ABI Primer Express software and obtained from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Rodent GAPDH was proprietary (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA); human β-actin was proprietary (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Amplification of GAPDH or β-actin was performed to standardize the quantification of target cDNA, allowing relative quantitation using the ABI Prism 7700 SDS software. Briefly, 2.0, 1.0, 0.5, and 0.25 μl of synthesized mouse liver or HepG2 cDNA was amplified in triplicate for both GAPDH or β-actin and each target gene to create a standard curve. Likewise, 2.0 μl of cDNA was amplified in triplicate in all isolated mouse liver or HepG2 samples for each primer/probe combination and GAPDH or β-actin. Each sample was supplemented with both respective forward and reverse primer and fluorescent probe and made up to 50 μl using TaqMan Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Each target probe was amplified in a separate 96-well plate. All samples were incubated at 50 °C for 2 min and at 95 °C for 10 min and then cycled at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. The input amounts of cDNA of the unknown samples were then calculated for all target probes and normalized to GAPDH or β-actin. Western Blot Analyses—For Western immunoblot analysis, 50 μg of nuclear extract or membrane protein was loaded on 12 or 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis, gels were subjected to electroblot onto nitrocellulose membranes, and uniformity of loading and transfer was confirmed by Ponceau staining. The membranes were blocked overnight in TS complete (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5% non-fat dry milk, and 0.1% Tween 20) at 4 °C. Blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with CPF (1:200), FXR (1:2000), RXRα (1: 2000), Mrp3 (1:10,000), MRP3 (1:50), Mrp2 (1:10,000), Bsep (1:5,000), mouse, rabbit, or goat polyclonal IgG antibodies. Blots were washed and then incubated with anti-mouse, -rabbit, or -goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:2,000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immune complexes were detected with the Western blot chemiluminescence reagent kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Tissue ELISA Assay—Cytoplasmic extract isolated from 50 mg of liver tissue was prepared using the NE-PER Kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol and as described previously (18Denson L.A. Bohan A. Held M.A. Boyer J.L. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 599-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Concentrations of mouse Tnfα, IL-1β, and IL6 were determined using a commercially available kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 50 μl of sample and assay diluent were added to TNFα-, IL-1β-, and IL6-coated 96-well plates and incubated for 2 h. After washing, 100 μl of conjugate was added to each well and incubated for 2 h, after which 100 μl of substrate solution was added and then incubated, in the dark, for 30 min. Spectrophotometric absorbance was read at 450 nm. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear protein was prepared from sham and BDL mouse liver and treated HepG2 cells as described previously (18Denson L.A. Bohan A. Held M.A. Boyer J.L. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 599-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A synthetic CPF/FTF oligonucleotide corresponding to the MRP3 promoter element (10Shwu-Jen T. Huang J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and a double-site mutated oligonucleotide were used in the experiments: CPF forward, GTGCCAAGGGCCCCCCCACCTCTGCCCCAAAGTCCCTCCCAG, reverse, CTGGGTGGGACTTTGGGGCAGAGGTGGGGGGGCCCTTGGCAC; CPFMutant(1 + 2) forward, GTGCTACATGCCCCCCCACCTCTGCCCTACATTCCCTCCCAG, reverse, CTGGGAGGGAATGTAGGGCAGAGGTGGGGGGGCATGTAGCAC. The oligonucleotide was end-labeled with digoxigenin-11-ddUTP, and EMSA was performed using the digoxigenin Gel Shift Kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, 5 μg of nuclear extract per sample was preincubated in binding buffer. Labeled oligonucleotide was added, and the binding reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min on ice. For competition assays, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the binding reaction. For supershift assays, 0.2 μg of polyclonal antibody was added to the binding reaction 2 h before addition of the labeled oligonucleotide. The samples were then resolved through a non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel and subsequently transferred to a nylon membrane using an electroblotter (Bio-Rad). After chemiluminescent detection, the membrane was exposed to Biomax ML Photographic Film (Eastman Kodak Co.), and quantitation was assessed by densitometry. Construction of Human MRP3 Promoter/Luciferase Reporter Plasmids—To characterize the 5′-flanking region of the human MRP3 gene transcriptional ability, a series of 5′ deletions ranging from –4134, –2000, –1000, –500, and –200 bp of human MRP3 upstream sequence from +19 nucleotides were amplified by the PCR from a BAC clone (hCIT,22_K_21 complete sequence, AC004590, Research Genetics Inc., Huntsville, AL), which contains the 5′-flanking region of human MRP3 gene. MRP3 upstream primers contained an internal KpnI restriction site, and one common downstream primer contained an internal SmaI site. MRP3 reporter gene constructs are as follows: 4KBMRP3F, 5′-CGGGGTACCAACACCGATGGACACCTTC-3′; 2KBMRP3F, 5′-CGGGGTACCCTCAAGCCCAGAGCAATCTG-3′; 1KBMRP3F, 5′-CGGGGTACCGAGGCAAGCAGGAGAAGGAGAG-3′; 0.5KBMRP3F, 5′-CGGGGTACCGAGGTCAGCTTCCTGATTGAGC-3′; 0.2KBMRP3F, 5′-CGGGGTACCCAGGGGCTGTCGCCGTGCCAAG-3′; and MRP3R2, 5′-TCCCCCGGGCGCGGCTGCAAGGAAGGCGAGC-3′. The PCR products were digested with KpnI/SmaI and ligated into the luciferase promoterless vector pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, WI) predigested with those indicated restriction enzymes. Primers were prepared, and sequence identity of promoter inserts of those constructs was verified by the W. M. Keck DNA Synthesis and Sequencing Facility at the Yale University School of Medicine. Two CPF-like elements were identified at –223/–217 (site 1) and –210/–202 (site 2) in the upstream sequence. Mutations were introduced into p-500bpLuc construct by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Two pairs of complementary oligonucleotide sets were designed as PCR primers as follows: Mut1F, 5′-GGGCTGTCGCCGTGCtAcatGCCCCCCCACCTCTGC-3′; Mut1R, 5′-GCAGAGGTGGGGGGGCatgTaGCACGGCGACAGCCC-3′; Mut2F, 5′-CCCCCCACCTCTGCCCtAcAtTCCCTCCCAGGGAGGC-3′; Mut2R, 5′-GCCTCCCTGGGAGGGAaTgTaGGGCAGAGGTGGGGGG-3′. A pair of primers Mut1F and Mut1R or Mut2F and Mut2R was used to generate CPF site 1 mutant construct, Mut-CPF1, or CPF site 2 mutant, Mut-CPF2, that converted the sequence TGCCAAGGGCC to TGCtAcatGCC, or CCCCAAAGTCC to CCCtAcAtTCC, respectively. The CPF site 1 and site 2 double mutation construct was derived from Mut-CPF1 construct with Mut2F and Mut2R primer by the same method. Statistical Analysis—All data were expressed as mean ± S.D. or mean ± S.E. Differences among groups were analyzed by analysis of variance, and statistical significance was accepted when p < 0.05. Differences between specific groups were determined using an unpaired Student's t test and analyzed by the Instat software package (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Hepatic Necrosis After BDL Is More Severe in the Absence of TnfrI Signaling—Two weeks after BDL, Tnfr–/– mice exhibited increased weight loss and liver injury relative to WT. We found that WT had lost 23.7 ± 3% of initial body weight versus 34.7 ± 4% in Tnfr–/– mice (p < 0.05). Liver weights were not significantly different. In addition, 4/18 Tnfr–/– mice died following BDL in contrast to 2/18 WT. As shown in Fig. 1, histological examination revealed that sham liver (Fig. 1, A and B) did not differ between the two groups. Hepatocellular necrosis, portal inflammation, and bile duct proliferation were observed after BDL (Fig. 1, C and D). However, significantly more necrosis (Figs. 1D and 2A) was observed in Tnfr–/– (8.44 ± 5.2%) liver relative to WT (1.7 ± 1.3%). To confirm differences in hepatocyte injury, we also measured serum LDH levels in all groups and, as shown in Fig. 2B, found a significantly higher serum LDH level in BDL Tnfr–/– mice (2.5-fold) relative to WT. As accumulation of intrahepatic bile acids represented a likely source of the more severe liver damage seen in Tnfr–/– mice following BDL, we examined bile acid levels in the serum and liver of all animals.Fig. 2Hepatocellular necrosis is associated with elevated tissue bile acid levels. Software analysis of the following is shown: tissue necrosis (*, p < 0.005) (A); relative LDH concentration (*, p < 0.0001 relative to sham; #, p < 0.0005 Tnfr–/– BDL relative to WT BDL) (B); serum bile acid concentration (*, p < 0.001 relative to sham; #, p < 0.005 Tnfr–/– BDL relative to WT BDL) (C); and liver bile acid concentration (*, p < 0.0001 relative to Tnfr–/–sham; #, p < 0.001 Tnfr–/– BDL relative to WT BDL; *, p < 0.02 relative to WT sham) (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Bile Salts Accumulate in the Liver to a Greater Degree in the Absence of TnfrI Signaling—Previous reports from our laboratory and others have demonstrated the hepatotoxicity of bile acids (22Jaeschke H. Gores G.J. Cederbaum A.I. Hinson J.A. Pessayre D. Lemasters J.J. Toxicol. Sci. 2002; 565: 166-176Crossref Scopus (1066) Google Scholar) and therefore serum and liver tissue bile acids were measured in WT and Tnfr–/– mice. As shown in Fig. 2C, serum bile acid levels rose in both groups after BDL, but to a significantly lower level in the serum of Tnfr–/– mice (240.7 ± 71.6 μmol/liter) versus WT (458.3 ± 119 μmol/liter). We then measured the bile acid concentration in BDL liver tissue. As shown in Fig. 2D, we found a significantly higher concentration of bile acids in the liver of Tnfr–/– mice (9.73 ± 2.38 mmol/kg) relative to WT (3.93 ± 2.12 mmol/kg). These findings suggested differences in the hepatocellular efflux of bile acids following bile duct obstruction. We have demonstrated previously alterations in bile salt efflux pumps following BDL and thus proceeded to determine whether differences in apical Mrp2 or Bsep, or basolateral Mrp3 expression were associated with the differences in serum and hepatocellular bile acid levels in Tnfr–/– and WT bile duct ligated mice. Expression of Hepatic Mrp2 and Bsep Is Similar in Tnfr–/– and WT Mice after BDL—Previous studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated down-regulation of Mrp2 and relative preservation of Bsep expression after 14 days BDL in the rat (23Lee J.M. Trauner M. Soroka C.J. Steiger B. Meier P.J. Boyer J.L. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To assess whether differences in the expression of these apical efflux pumps could account for the differences in the hepatic concentration of bile acids observed in the study, Western blot and real time RT-PCR were performed on membrane protein and total RNA isolated from the liver of WT and Tnfr–/– mice. As shown in Fig. 3, we confirmed that Mrp2 protein (Fig. 3A) and RNA expressi"
https://openalex.org/W2034894104,"Sp3 transcription factor can either activate or repress target gene expression. However, the molecular event that controls this dual function is unclear. We previously reported (Ammanamanchi, S., and Brattain, M. G. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 3348–3352) that unmodified Sp3 acts as a transcriptional repressor of transforming growth factor-β receptors in MCF-7L breast cancer cells. We now report that histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) induces acetylation of Sp3, which acts as a transcriptional activator of transforming growth factor-β receptor type II (RII) in MCF-7L cells. Mutation analysis indicated the TSA response is mediated through a GC box located on the RII promoter, which was previously identified as an Sp1/Sp3-binding site that was critical for RII promoter activity. Ectopic Sp3 expression in Sp3-deficient MCF-7E breast cancer cells repressed RII promoter activity in the absence of TSA. However, in the TSA-treated MCF-7E cells ectopic Sp3 activated RII promoter. Histone acetyltransferase p300 was shown to acetylate Sp3. Sp3-mediated RII promoter activity was stimulated by wild type p300 but not the histone acetyltransferase domain-deleted mutant p300 in MCF-7L cells, suggesting the positive effect of p300 acetylase activity on Sp3. Consequently, the results presented in this manuscript demonstrate that acetylation acts as a switch that controls the repressor and activator role of Sp3."

https://openalex.org/W2156560354,"Lipid metabolism plays an important role in glucose homeostasis under normal and pathological conditions. In adipocytes, skeletal muscle, and pancreatic β-cells, lipids are mobilized from acylglycerides by the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Here, the consequences of a targeted disruption of the HSL gene for glucose homeostasis were examined. HSL null mice were slightly hyperglycemic in the fasted, but not fed state, which was accompanied by moderate hyperinsulinemia. During glucose challenges, however, disposal of the sugar was not affected in HSL null mice, presumably because of release of increased amounts of insulin. Impaired insulin sensitivity was further indicated by retarded glucose disposal during an insulin tolerance test. A euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp revealed that hepatic glucose production was insufficiently blocked by insulin in HSL null mice. In vitro, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into soleus muscle, and lipogenesis in adipocytes were moderately reduced, suggesting additional sites of insulin resistance. Morphometric analysis of pancreatic islets revealed a doubling of β-cell mass in HSL null mice, which is consistent with an adaptation to insulin resistance. Insulin secretion in vitro, examined by perifusion of isolated islets, was not impacted by HSL deficiency. Thus, HSL deficiency results in a moderate impairment of insulin sensitivity in multiple target tissues of the hormone but is compensated by hyperinsulinemia. Lipid metabolism plays an important role in glucose homeostasis under normal and pathological conditions. In adipocytes, skeletal muscle, and pancreatic β-cells, lipids are mobilized from acylglycerides by the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Here, the consequences of a targeted disruption of the HSL gene for glucose homeostasis were examined. HSL null mice were slightly hyperglycemic in the fasted, but not fed state, which was accompanied by moderate hyperinsulinemia. During glucose challenges, however, disposal of the sugar was not affected in HSL null mice, presumably because of release of increased amounts of insulin. Impaired insulin sensitivity was further indicated by retarded glucose disposal during an insulin tolerance test. A euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp revealed that hepatic glucose production was insufficiently blocked by insulin in HSL null mice. In vitro, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into soleus muscle, and lipogenesis in adipocytes were moderately reduced, suggesting additional sites of insulin resistance. Morphometric analysis of pancreatic islets revealed a doubling of β-cell mass in HSL null mice, which is consistent with an adaptation to insulin resistance. Insulin secretion in vitro, examined by perifusion of isolated islets, was not impacted by HSL deficiency. Thus, HSL deficiency results in a moderate impairment of insulin sensitivity in multiple target tissues of the hormone but is compensated by hyperinsulinemia. Perturbation of plasma lipids is a hallmark of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (1DeFronzo R.A. Bonadonna R.C. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 318-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar). In fact, circulating free fatty acids (FFA) 1The abbreviations used are: FFA, free fatty acids; AUC, area under curve; EGO, endogenous glucose output; GIR, glucose infusion rate; GSIS, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion; Ra , glucose rate of appearance; GLUT2, glucose transporter-2; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; NCEH, neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: FFA, free fatty acids; AUC, area under curve; EGO, endogenous glucose output; GIR, glucose infusion rate; GSIS, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion; Ra , glucose rate of appearance; GLUT2, glucose transporter-2; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; NCEH, neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase; WT, wild type. and triglycerides are elevated in many, if not most, individuals with impaired insulin sensitivity, obese individuals in particular. Therefore, much attention has been drawn to the possibility that hyperlipidemia is a cause, as well as a consequence, of insulin resistance (2McGarry J.D. Dobbins R.L. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). For instance, in skeletal muscle, infusion of lipids has been shown to interfere with glucose disposal (3Dresner A. Laurent D. Marcucci M. Griffin M.E. Dufour S. Cline G.W. Slezak L.A. Andersen D.K. Hundal R.S. Rothman D.L. Petersen K.F. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). On a molecular level, it was proposed that lipids activate IκB kinase-β (4Kim J.K. Kim Y.J. Fillmore J.J. Chen Y. Moore I. Lee J. Yuan M. Li Z.W. Karin M. Perret P. Shoelson S.E. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) and/or atypical protein kinase C species in skeletal muscle (5Griffin M.E. Marcucci M.J. Cline G.W. Bell K. Barucci N. Lee D. Goodyear L.J. Kraegen E.W. White M.F. Shulman G.I. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar); these kinases may attenuate insulin signaling by inappropriately phosphorylating serine residues of insulin receptor substrate proteins. Once these processes have commenced, insulin resistance will result in an inability of insulin to block mobilization of lipids from adipose tissue (6Degerman E. Belfrage P. Manganiello V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6823-6826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), i.e. lipolysis. Hyperlipidemia will be aggravated, fat deposition will ultimately also occur in non-adipocyte cells, and insulin sensitivity will be further impaired. Indeed, patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus accumulate triglycerides in muscle fibers (7Levin K. Daa Schroeder H. Alford F.P. Beck-Nielsen H. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 824-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), an event correlating inversely with insulin sensitivity (8Krssak M. Falk Petersen K. Dresner A. DiPietro L. Vogel S.M. Rothman D.L. Roden M. Shulman G.I. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar), whereas treatment of insulin resistance by thiazolidinediones depletes these accumulations and enhances insulin sensitivity (9Mayerson A.B. Hundal R.S. Dufour S. Lebon V. Befroy D. Cline G.W. Enocksson S. Inzucchi S.E. Shulman G.I. Petersen K.F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Given the potential pathogenetic role of both circulating and stored lipids, the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) may play an important role in the development of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The lipase is the key regulator of lipid mobilization from white adipose tissue (10Holm C. Österlund T. Laurell H. Contreras J.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), catalyzing the hydrolysis of tri- and diglycerides. HSL is unique among lipases in that it is regulated by hormones (10Holm C. Österlund T. Laurell H. Contreras J.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar); thus, between meals HSL provides circulating FFA, a process stimulated by cAMP-raising hormones, such as glucagon and catecholamines. cAMP activates protein kinase A, which turns on the lipase by reversible phosphorylation of three serine residues (11Anthonsen M.W. Rönnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Degerman E. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). By contrast, in the post-prandial state, insulin signaling in adipocytes activates phosphodiesterase 3B, which hydrolyzes cAMP (6Degerman E. Belfrage P. Manganiello V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6823-6826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), hereby preventing activation of HSL and lipolysis. These processes may also be in operation in cells other than adipocytes. In fact, we demonstrated recently that HSL is expressed and active in skeletal muscle (12Langfort J. Ploug T. Ihlemann J. Saldo M. Holm C. Galbo H. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and pancreatic β-cells (13Mulder H. Holst L.S. Svensson H. Degerman E. Sundler F. Ahren B. Rorsman P. Holm C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that perturbed function of HSL could lead to accumulation of acylglycerides in non-adipocytes, such as skeletal muscle and β-cells, subsequently impairing insulin sensitivity and β-cell function (14Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 863-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To address the role of HSL in these events, generation of mice with a disruption of the HSL gene should be helpful. A number of such lines have been created (15Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 18: 787-792Crossref Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 16Wang S.P. Laurin N. Himms-Hagen J. Rudnicki M.A. Levy E. Robert M.F. Pan L. Oligny L. Mitchell G.A. Obes. Res. 2001; 9: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 17Roduit R. Masiello P. Wang S.P. Li H. Mitchell G.A. Prentki M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1970-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Haemmerle G. Zimmermann R. Hayn M. Theussl C. Waeg G. Wagner E. Sattler W. Magin T.M. Wagner E.F. Zechner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4806-4815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), all exhibiting quite similar phenotypes. Unexpectedly, HSL null mice maintain normal body weight, and accumulation of triglycerides is not apparent. Instead, increased levels of diglycerides are detected in some tissues (18Haemmerle G. Zimmermann R. Hayn M. Theussl C. Waeg G. Wagner E. Sattler W. Magin T.M. Wagner E.F. Zechner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4806-4815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), suggesting that in vivo HSL primarily acts as a diglyceride lipase and that other, as yet unknown, lipases are responsible for hydrolysis of acylglycerides. In one line (17Roduit R. Masiello P. Wang S.P. Li H. Mitchell G.A. Prentki M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1970-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), glucose intolerance was observed, which could be accounted for by a combination of insulin resistance and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Here, we demonstrate in an independent HSL null mouse line that lack of HSL is associated with a moderate impairment of insulin sensitivity whereas insulin secretion remains intact. Impaired insulin sensitivity is most apparent in liver, but reduced lipogenesis in white adipose tissue and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle observed in vitro likely contribute to the phenotype. The findings emphasize the essential metabolic role of a regulated mobilization of cellular lipids by HSL in normal glucose homeostasis. Inactivation of the HSL Gene—HSL null mice were generated by targeted disruption of the HSL gene in 129SV-derived embryonic stem cells by standard procedures (19Talts J.F. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 129: 153-187PubMed Google Scholar), as described elsewhere (20Grober J. Lucas S. Sörhede-Winzell M. Zaghini I. Mairal A. Contreras J.A. Besnard P. Holm C. Langin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6510-6515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In brief, the cDNA encoding the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein was inserted in-frame into exon 5 of the HSL gene, followed by a neomycin resistance gene, hereby disrupting the catalytic domain. Two recombinant embryonic stem cell colonies were used for generation of two independent HSL null mouse lines. Preliminary experiments showed that both HSL null lines were similar with regard to glucose homeostasis and in that diglyceride hydrolysis in white adipocytes was virtually absent (data not shown); therefore, mice from both HSL null lines were pooled for the experiments in this work. The studies were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee at Lund University. Western Blot Analysis—Soleus muscle and white adipose tissue were homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml antipain, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. For homogenates of adipose tissue, fat-free infranatants were prepared by centrifugation at 110,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blot analysis was performed by an enhanced chemiluminescence system (SuperSignal ULTRA; Pierce, Rockford, IL), using an affinity-purified chicken anti-rat HSL primary antibody. Enzyme Activity and Acylglyceride Assays—Infranatants of white adipose tissue and homogenates of skeletal muscle (see above) and liver were assayed for diglyceride lipase activity; the diglyceride analogue mono-oleoyl-2-O-mono-oleylglycerol was used as substrate, as described elsewhere (21Tornqvist H. Björgell P. Krabbisch L. Belfrage P. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 654-656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Österlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (NCEH) activity was determined as described previously (22Österlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Acylglycerides were extracted from the homogenates using methanol/chloroform according to the method of Folch et al. (23Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and hydrolyzed by KOH; acylglyceride levels were determined as glycerol, using a bioluminescence assay (24Hellmer J. Arner P. Lundin A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Lipolysis in Isolated White Adipose Cells—Parametrial adipose tissue was excised, cut into small pieces, and incubated in Krebs-Ringer solution supplemented with 3.5% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm glucose, and collagenase (0.6 mg/ml; Sigma) in a shaking incubator for 90–100 min according to a modification (25Honnor R.C. Dhillon G.S. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15122-15129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the Rodbell method (26Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The digested tissue was filtered, and the isolated cells were washed. The cells were suspended at a final concentration of 5% (v/v) in Krebs-Ringer buffer with 1% bovine serum albumin, 200 nm adenosine, and 2 mm glucose and aliquoted (100 μl/well) into microtiter filterplates (Millipore). Varying concentrations of isoproterenol were added, and after incubation in a shaking incubator for 1 h at 36.5 °C, the cell medium was collected using an Eppendorf 5 Prime device. Glycerol in the medium was determined using a bioluminescence assay (24Hellmer J. Arner P. Lundin A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and FFA were determined using the NEFA-C kit (Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany). Immunocytochemistry and Morphometry—Pancreatic tissue was prepared for immunocytochemistry as described previously (27Mulder H. Lindh A.C. Sundler F. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 274: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and sections were cut on a cryostat (15 μm). An affinity-purified rabbit anti-human HSL antibody (diluted 1:640) and antibodies to insulin (diluted 1:1280; code 9003; Euro-Diagnostica, Malmö, Sweden) and glucose transporter-2 (GLUT2; diluted 1:640; code 1342; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) were used for indirect immunofluorescence, as described previously (27Mulder H. Lindh A.C. Sundler F. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 274: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Islet number and β-cell volume were determined in an unbiased procedure, according to the principles of stereological morphometry. To this end, serial sections (n = 100–120) were prepared and immunostained for insulin, using the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase method as described (27Mulder H. Lindh A.C. Sundler F. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 274: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Islet numbers were determined by dissector analysis (28Sterio D.C. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 1984; 134: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar), employing adjacent sections as reference and look-up sections, respectively. Total β-cell volume was determined in serial sections using point-counting and Cavalieri's principle (29Coggeshall R.E. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 9-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). As an index of β-cell mass, mean islet β-cell volume was calculated by dividing total islet β-cell volume by total number of islets in the sections; these numbers were compared statistically. The investigator was unaware of the identity of the sections during analysis. Glucose and Insulin Tolerance Tests—For the intravenous glucose tolerance test, d-glucose (1g/kg) was injected into the tail vein of anesthetized mice (midazolam (0.4 mg/mouse; Dormicum®; Hoffmann-La Roche) and a combination of fluanison (0.9 mg/mouse) and fentanyl (0.02 mg/mouse; Hypnorm®; Janssen, Beerse, Belgium)). In an additional experiment, 5 mg of arginine (Sigma) were injected intravenously to elicit insulin and glucagon secretion. In the oral glucose tolerance test, 150 mg of d-glucose were administered by oral gavage to the anesthetized mice after a 12-h fast. In the insulin tolerance test, 0.75 milliunits/g human insulin (Actrapid; Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) were given intraperitoneally to non-fasted anesthetized mice. In all in vivo investigations, plasma glucose and hormone levels were determined in retro-orbital blood samples collected at the time points indicated in the figures. For fasting samples, mice were deprived of food at 8:00 a.m., and retro-orbital blood was drawn from anesthetized mice at 2:00 p.m. Euglycemic Hyperinsulinemic Clamp—A euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp was performed in HSL null (n = 5) and wild type mice (n = 7); the mice were anesthetized as described above. The clamp was carried out as described previously (30Pacini G. Thomaseth K. Ahren B. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 281: E693-E703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the addition of an infusion of [3H]glucose to enable measurements of glucose turnover rate. Briefly, the right jugular vein and the left carotid artery were catheterized. The venous catheter was used for infusion of glucose and insulin (Actrapid); the arterial catheter was used for sampling. Thirty min after introduction of the catheters (t = –100 min), infusion of [3H]glucose (Amersham Biosciences) was started. At t = 0 min, insulin was infused at a rate of 60 milliunits·kg–1·min–1 for 1 min, followed by a constant infusion of 20 milliunits·kg–1·min–1. Blood glucose levels were determined at 5-min intervals for 90 min. A variable rate of glucose infusion kept blood glucose at 6 mm. A blood sample was taken at t = 0, t = 60, and t = 90 min for determination of plasma insulin. Insulin sensitivity was calculated as the glucose infusion rate (GIR) during the second hour (M) divided by the mean insulin concentration at 60, 90, and 120 min (I). At t = 0 and t = 90 min, a blood sample was drawn for measurement of [3H]glucose specific activity by liquid scintillation counting. Glucose rate of appearance (Ra) was calculated by dividing the rate of infusion of [3H]glucose by the plasma glucose specific activity. Endogenous glucose output (EGO), which represents the glucose production from mainly hepatic, but to a slight extent also from renal sources, equals Ra before insulin infusion. During the insulin infusion, EGO was calculated as the difference between Ra and GIR. In cases in which Ra was less than GIR, EGO was considered to be zero. Finally, we also calculated the glucose clearance rate by dividing glucose disposal rate (being the highest of Ra and GIR) divided by the plasma glucose concentration. Plasma Analyses—Insulin and glucagon were measured radioimmunochemically (Linco Research, St. Louis, MO). Leptin was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Chrystal Chemistry, Chicago, IL); glucose was determined by the glucose oxidase method (Sigma). Plasma FFA and triglycerides were determined according to the manufacturer's specifications (Wako Chemicals and Sigma, respectively). Isolation and Perifusion of Islets—Islets were isolated by standard collagenase digestion and hand-picked under a stereo microscope. Insulin content in islets was measured radioimmunochemically (Linco Research) after acid ethanol extraction of the hormone. Perifusion of islets was performed as described previously in detail (31Skoglund G. Lundquist I. Ahren B. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1988; 132: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In brief, islets were pre-incubated in HEPES balanced salt solution (125 mm NaCl, 5.9 mmol KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 1.28 mm CaCl2, 0.1% human serum albumin, pH 7.36) containing 2.8 mm glucose for 60 min. Then, batches of 20 islets were sandwiched between two layers of gel (Bio-Gel P4; Bio-Rad). The HEPES balanced salt solution was kept at 37 °C, and islets were perifused at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min; fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. Insulin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). Glucose Uptake into Skeletal Muscle in Vitro—Glucose uptake into soleus muscle was determined as described previously (32Ihlemann J. Ploug T. Hellsten Y. Galbo H. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 277: E208-E214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the soleus muscle in anesthetized mice (see above) was gently dissected free with intact tendons at both ends and incubated for up to 4 h in test tubes at 29 °C in Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer containing 8 mm glucose, 1 mm pyruvic acid, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The medium was continuously gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Muscles were then placed in glucose-free Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 2 mm pyruvic acid and 0.2% bovine serum albumin with or without 1000 microunit/ml of insulin (Actrapid). After 30 min, glucose transport was measured as [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake with [14C]sucrose as extracellular marker. Isotopes and unlabeled sugars were added to the incubation medium to yield final concentrations of 0.81 μCi of [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose and 0.64 μCi of [14C]-sucrose per ml and 1 mm of both unlabeled 2-deoxy-d-glucose and sucrose. After a 10-min exposure to isotopes, muscles were briefly blotted on filter paper and immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C until analyzed. Lipogenesis in White Adipose Cells in Vitro—Lipogenesis was determined as described (33Moody A.J. Stan M.A. Stan M. Gliemann J. Horm. Metab. Res. 1974; 6: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 1-ml aliquots of 2% (v/v) cell suspension of adipocytes, prepared as described above, and suspended in Krebs-Ringer solution with 25 mm HEPES, 3.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.55 mm glucose, were added to vials containing d-[6-14C]glucose (0.4 μCi/ml), 30 nm isoproterenol, and varying concentrations of insulin. A low concentration of isoproterenol, in the absence of adenosine deaminase, has been shown to increase the sensitivity of the lipogenesis assay by reducing basal lipogenesis (no insulin) while leaving insulin-stimulated lipogenesis unaffacted. 2Eva Degerman, personal communication. Incubations at 37 °C lasted for 3 h with shaking. Reactions were terminated by addition of 8 ml of a toluol-based scintillation mixture, containing 0.3 mg/ml 1,4-bis[2-(4-methyl-5-phenyloxazolyl)]benzene and 5 mg/ml 2,5-diphenyloxazole (Sigma). De novo synthesis of lipids was determined by liquid scintillation counting of radioactivity incorporated into total cellular lipids. d-[6-14C]Glucose is superior to several other glucose analogs in reflecting fatty acid synthesis and thus lipogenic status of the cell (34Sekar N. Qian S. Shechter Y. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2514-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Means ± S.E. were given. Data were analyzed statistically with a two-tailed unpaired t test with the following exceptions: for analysis of total insulin secretion during glucose challenges, area under curve (AUC) was calculated by use of the trapezoid rule; because the null hypothesis in this case concerned rejection of a decreased insulin secretion, AUC was compared with a one-tailed t test. In the lipogenesis experiments, data were compared with a paired one-tailed Wilcoxon's singed rank test, because arbitrary values were used (-fold changes), and pairing was made, because absolute values varied between experiments. Again, a one-tailed t test was used, because the null hypothesis in this case concerned rejection of an increase in lipogenesis, based on the previous observation of decreased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Numerical p values rather than cut-off values are given in most instances. General Characteristics of the HSL Null Mice—Male HSL null mice were sterile because of oligo- and azospermia (data not shown), which is in agreement with previous reports on other lines of HSL null mice (15Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Offspring, which are SV129/C57/BL/6J hybrids, were born in the expected Mendelian frequency. HSL null mice appeared grossly normal. Body weight (Table I) and food intake (data not shown) were similar in HSL null and wild type mice.Table IMetabolic characteristics of HSL wild type and null miceAnalysisWild typeHSL nulln/genotypep valueBody weight (g)-female23.7 ± 0.824.1 ± 0.660.7Body weight (g)-male31.6 ± 0.730.1 ± 1.140.3Fasting plasma glucose (mm)7.6 ± 0.310.2 ± 0.9300.009Fasting plasma insulin (ng/ml)1.07 ± 0.21.85 ± 0.2230.015Fasting plasma glucagon (pg/ml)56.5 ± 6.255.0 ± 5.9160.49Plasma FFA (mm)0.27 ± 0.020.30 ± 0.0146-70.24Plasma triglycerides (mg/dl)57 ± 6.161 ± 9.616-170.75Plasma leptin (ng/ml)2.5 ± 0.42.1 ± 0.6250.55 Open table in a new tab HSL Expression in Adipocytes and Skeletal Muscle—Using Western blot analysis of extracts from white adipose tissue and soleus muscle, HSL was detected in HSL wild type, but not null, tissues (see Fig. 1A and Fig. 7A), confirming that the disruption of the HSL gene has resulted in mice that do not express HSL protein.Fig. 7In vitro glucose uptake in soleus muscle and lipogenesis in white adipose cells. The soleus muscle was excised in its entirety, and [3H]2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake was determined in the presence and absence of 1000 microunit/ml insulin (A), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The inset in A shows a Western blot of a homogenate of soleus muscle (80 μg of protein resolved on the gel) probed with anti-HSL antibodies. *, p = 0.025; two-tailed unpaired t test. For lipogenesis, white adipocytes were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of insulin, and incorporation of 14C into total cellular lipids was determined by scintillation counting (B). Data were compared with a paired one-tailed Wilcoxon's singed rank test, because arbitrary values were used (-fold changes); four independent experiments were performed in triplicate; *, p = 0.034.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Lipolysis in Isolated White Adipose Cells—To assess the consequences of the lack of HSL for catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis, we performed lipolysis experiments in isolated paragonadal adipocytes, using the non-selective β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. We found that adipocytes of HSL null mice exhibited a completely blunted catecholamine-stimulated release of glycerol (Fig. 1A) and a reduced release of FFA (Fig. 1B) into the medium. These findings are in agreement with results from another line of HSL null mice (18Haemmerle G. Zimmermann R. Hayn M. Theussl C. Waeg G. Wagner E. Sattler W. Magin T.M. Wagner E.F. Zechner R. J.

Concurrent with results in this strain, we also observe an accumulation of diglycerides in HSL null white adipocytes (data not shown). This suggests that HSL is the sole lipase in these cells capable of hydrolyzing diglycerides, whereas an additional lipase may hydrolyze triglycerides to diglycerides. Also, this would explain the moderate release of FFA from HSL null adipocytes, whereas glycerol remains within cells as diglycerides. However, the isoproterenol-induced increase in FFA release into the medium from HSL null adipocytes does not necessarily prove the existence of an alternative activable lipase. Rather, it may be the result of perilipin phosphorylation (35Clifford G.M. Londos C. Kraemer F.B. Vernon R.G. Yeaman S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5011-5015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), with the consequent loss of the barrier function of this protein, allowing alternative triglyceride lipases access to the lipid droplet. The nature of these triglyceride lipases remains to be established (36Okazaki H. Osuga J. Tamura Y. Yahagi N. Tomita S. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Kimura S. Gotoda T."
https://openalex.org/W2040912449,"The ErbB-2 interacting protein receptor-associated late transducer (RALT) was previously identified as a feedback inhibitor of ErbB-2 mitogenic signals. We now report that RALT binds to ligand-activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ErbB-4 and ErbB-2.ErbB-3 dimers. When ectopically expressed in 32D cells reconstituted with the above ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) RALT behaved as a pan-ErbB inhibitor. Importantly, when tested in either cell proliferation assays or biochemical experiments measuring activation of ERK and AKT, RALT affected the signalling activity of distinct ErbB dimers with different relative potencies. RALT deltaEBR, a mutant unable to bind to ErbB RTKs, did not inhibit ErbB-dependent activation of ERK and AKT, consistent with RALT exerting its suppressive activity towards these pathways at a receptor-proximal level. Remarkably, RALT deltaEBR retained the ability to suppress largely the proliferative activity of ErbB-2.ErbB-3 dimers over a wide range of ligand concentrations, indicating that RALT can intercept ErbB-2.ErbB-3 mitogenic signals also at a receptor-distal level. A suppressive function of RALT deltaEBR towards the mitogenic activity of EGFR and ErbB-4 was detected at low levels of receptor occupancy, but was completely overcome by saturating concentrations of ligand. We propose that quantitative and qualitative aspects of RALT signalling concur in defining identity, strength and duration of signals generated by the ErbB network."
https://openalex.org/W1967562709,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), stimulated by hormones and sensory stimuli, act as molecular switches to relay activation to heterotrimeric G proteins. Recent studies suggest that GPCRs form dimeric or oligomeric structures, a phenomenon that has long been established for growth factor receptors. The elucidation of the domains of GPCRs that mediate receptor association is of critical importance for understanding the function of GPCR oligomers. Using a disulfide-trapping strategy to probe the intermolecular contact surfaces, we demonstrate cross-linking of C5a receptors in membranes prepared from both human neutrophils and stably transfected mammalian cells that is mediated by a cysteine in the second intracellular loop. To explore other surfaces that might be involved in the oligomerization of C5a receptors, we constructed receptors with individual cysteines in other intracellular regions. C5a receptors with a cysteine in the first intracellular loop or the carboxyl terminus displayed the fastest kinetics of dimer formation, whereas an intracellular loop 3 cysteine displayed minimal cross-linking. Since the rate of disulfide trapping reflects the proximity of sulfhydryl groups, assuming similar accessibility and flexibility, these results imply a symmetric dimer interface that may involve either transmembrane helices 1 and 2 or helix 4. However, neither model can account for the ability of the native cysteine in the second intracellular loop to mediate efficient crosslinking. Based on these observations, we propose that C5a receptors form higher order oligomers (i.e. tetramers) or clusters in the membrane.

GPCRs mediate a multitude of physiologic responses and serve as common pharmacological targets; more than half of all pharmacological agents that are currently prescribed target GPCRs (3Leurs R. Smit M.J. Alewijnse A.E. Timmerman H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Receptor activation is accomplished by a remarkably diverse group of ligands to catalyze the exchange of GTP for GDP on the α subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins. This exchange results in the dissociation of the α-GTP subunit from the βγ dimer. Both complexes can then activate downstream targets, such as effector enzymes and ion channels (4Hamm H.E. J. Biol.

Despite numerous structure-function studies of many different GPCRs, a fundamental question remains: Do GPCRs function as monomers or as oligomers? For the ∼25 members of class C receptors, the answer is clear. These receptors form dimers through specialized structures, such as disulfide-bonded extracellular domains (metabotropic glutamate receptors) (6Romano C. Yang W.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol.

Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). For the more than 500 members of the rhodopsin family of GPCRs and the 60 members of the secretin family of GPCRs, studies now demonstrate that a rapidly increasing number of these GPCRs form oligomers (9Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 10Rios C.D. Jordan B.A. Gomes I. Devi L.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 92: 71-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Early work on members of the rhodopsin family of GPCRs, such as dopamine receptor subtypes and opioid receptors, utilized detergent-solubilized membranes to show that GPCR molecules can co-immunoprecipitate as homodimers and heterodimers (11Ng G.Y. O'Dowd B.F. Lee S.P. Chung H.T. Brann M.R. Seeman P. George S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 12Jordan B.A. Devi L.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Heterodimerization of opioid receptors κ and δ results in novel ligand binding and function, proving that GPCR oligomerization has physiologic relevance (12Jordan B.A. Devi L.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). More recently, energy transfer studies, using either fluorescence (FRET) or bioluminescence (BRET), have also shown the proximity of monomers of many members of the rhodopsin family of GPCRs, including β2-adrenergic receptor (13Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), somatostatin receptors (14Rocheville M.

Despite intense investigation, the domains critical for oligomerization remain elusive. Recently, two works (16Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. Nature. 2003; 421: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 17Liang Y. Fotiadis D. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Palczewski K. Engel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21655-21662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) have proposed that TM 4 plays a vital role in homodimerization of two members of the rhodopsin family of GPCRs. Elegant studies using atomic force microscopy showed that rhodopsin molecules in rod outer segments in mouse retinas are arranged in orderly rows of dimers. In studies of the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), disulfide-trapping experiments demonstrated crosslinking of receptors when exposed to cupric orthophenanthroline (18Guo W. Shi L. Javitch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4385-4388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Moreover, a single cysteine substitution on the extracellular side of TM 4 abolished the cross-linking. The authors conclude that dopamine D2 receptors reside in the membrane as symmetric dimers, oriented about a TM 4 interface, in an arrangement similar to that observed by electron microscopy studies of crystals of squid rhodopsin (19Davies A. Gowen B.E. Krebs A.M. Schertler G.F. Saibil H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It will be of great interest to determine if other GPCRs utilize similar dimer interfaces and, if so, what role dimerization plays in receptor function. As a model receptor in this study, we examine the complement factor 5a receptor (C5aR), a member of the rhodopsin family of G protein-coupled receptors that activates both Gαi and Gα16 (20Buhl A.M. Osawa S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19828-19832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). C5a is a 74-amino acid glycoprotein that is liberated during complement activation and mediates such processes as neutrophil chemotaxis, platelet activation, and vascular permeability (21Gerard C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Binding of C5a to its receptor involves a two-site binding model with the COOH terminus of the ligand inserting into the receptor interhelical crevice and other portions of the ligand interacting with the NH2 terminus of C5aR to enhance ligand affinity (22DeMartino J.A. Van Riper G. Siciliano S.J. Molineaux C.J. Konteatis Z.D. Rosen H. Springer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14446-14450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C5aR serves as a useful model to study GPCR oligomerization for two major reasons. First, the molecular architecture of C5aR is very similar to bovine rhodopsin. C5aR has 350 amino acids versus 348 for rhodopsin, and the sizes of the intra- and extracellular loops and termini are comparable (Fig. 1). Bovine rhodopsin is the only GPCR whose crystal structure has been elucidated (23Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4970) Google Scholar); therefore, we have been able to generate a model of C5aR that we believe is consistent with its native structure. Second, we have performed high throughput structure-function studies of C5a receptors expressed in yeast to map the most essential residues in each of the transmembrane segments (24Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O. Trueheart J. Meng E.C. Iiri T. Sheikh S.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15757-15765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 25Geva A. Lassere T.B. Lichtarge O. Pollitt S.K. Baranski T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35393-35401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These comprehensive studies provide the largest mutational data base of any GPCR in the rhodopsin family. In the second and fourth transmembrane segments of the C5a receptor, essential residues, identified by random saturation mutagenesis analysis, map onto positions in the rhodopsin structure that could mediate dimer/oligomer interactions. Moreover, FRET studies on human C5a receptors tagged with YFP and cyan fluorescent protein demonstrate that C5a receptors form oligomers when expressed in yeast, which should provide a useful genetic system to begin to characterize the oligomerization of C5a receptors (57Floyd D.H. Geva A. Bruinsma S.P. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Baranski T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35354-35361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, we use disulfide trapping to explore oligomerization of C5a receptors. Disulfide trapping has been used to demonstrate the spatial arrangement of dimers of the E. coli aspartate receptor (26Lynch B.A. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10402-10406Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), bacterial Trg chemoreceptor (27Lee G.F. Burrows G.G. Lebert M.R. Dutton D.P. Hazelbauer G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29920-29927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the above-mentioned dopamine D2 receptor (18Guo W. Shi L. Javitch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4385-4388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar); this technique has also been applied to the analysis of intramolecular contacts between transmembrane domains of GPCRs, such as the M3 muscarinic receptor (28Hamdan F.F. Ward S.D. Siddiqui N.A. Bloodworth L.M. Wess J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7647-7658Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that the oxidation of endogenous C5aR molecules in human neutrophils results in disulfide-linked dimers. Further probing of this finding, using intact membranes prepared from CHO cells expressing C5aR, revealed that a cysteine in the second intracellular loop is the only native cysteine that mediates the observed cross-linking. We extend these studies by generating C5a receptors that contain single cysteine substitutions in each of the intracellular loops and the carboxyl terminus. Using these receptors as collisional probes, the most rapid rates of crosslinking revealed preferred interfaces near IC1 and the COOH terminus of the receptor. These results support either of two potential symmetric dimer models, a TM 1,2 contact dimer or a TM 4 contact dimer. In addition, we believe that these results provide the basis for a model of oligomerization that proposes higher order structures. Materials—Cupric sulfate and 1,10-phenanthroline were obtained from Sigma. The rabbit polyclonal C5aR amino-terminal antibody, raised against a peptide corresponding to residues 9–29 (29Morgan E.L. Ember J.A. Sanderson S.D. Scholz W. Buchner R. Ye R.D. Hugli T.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 377-388PubMed Google Scholar), was prepared by Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA) and affinity-purified using Sulfolink Gel from Pierce. The rabbit polyclonal GFP(FL) antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) horseradish peroxidase was obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Lumi-LightPLUS Western blotting Substrate was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Prestained molecular mass markers and other SDS-PAGE reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. Ham's F-12 and fetal bovine serum were from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). G418 sulfate was from Invitrogen. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) using pcDNA3 C5aR-YFP as the template. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Stable Cell Line Generation and Maintenance—CHO cells were split 1:15 the day before transfection and fed 9.0 ml of fresh Ham's F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum 2 h before precipitation. A 450-μl aqueous solution containing 40 μg of plasmid DNA was combined with 50 μl of 2.5 m CaCl2. The DNA/CaCl2 mixture was added dropwise to 500 μl of HeBS. After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the precipitate was distributed evenly over a 10-cm plate of cells at 75% confluence. After the cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the medium was removed, and 2.0 ml of 10% Me2SO was added. Cells were shocked for 1 min and then washed with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were allowed to double twice before 1 mg/ml G418 and/or 250 μg/ml zeocin was added. Colonies were selected and expanded after 14 days and removed from selection. CHO Membrane Preparation—Membranes were prepared as described (30Sheikh S.P. Vilardarga J.P. Baranski T.J. Lichtarge O. Iiri T. Meng E.C. Nissenson R.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17033-17041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO cells were grown to 90% confluence in three 10-cm plates, culture medium was removed, and cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS/EDTA solution (1× PBS, 10 mm EDTA, 4 mm EGTA, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The wash solution was removed, and the cells were incubated with 2 ml of PBS/EDTA solution at room temperature for 5 min. The cells were harvested into 2-ml tubes and centrifuged at 960 × g for 5 min. The PBS/EDTA was aspirated, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and homogenized by aspirating through a 27-gauge needle 10 times. The lysed solution was centrifuged at 960 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged again. The supernatant was removed and overlaid on 1.5 ml of sucrose cushion (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) in TLA100.3 centrifuge tubes (Sorvall). The mixture was centrifuged at 217,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 6 m urea (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 2.5 mm EGTA). The solution was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, and then the membranes were pelleted at 217,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. After a second urea wash and sedimentation, the membranes were resuspended in sucrose buffer and either exposed to crosslinking or frozen and stored at –80 °C. Neutrophil Isolation and Membrane Preparation—Polymorphonuclear leukocytes were isolated as described (31Rollins T.E. Siciliano S. Springer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 520-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, blood (20 ml) was treated with 25 units heparin and diluted 1:1 with saline. Cells were separated on Ficoll-Hypaque and resuspended in lysis solution (150 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm KHCO3, 90 mm EDTA). Cells were washed once in lysis buffer and resuspended at 107/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 2.5 mm CaCl2, 100 units/ml DNase I, 0.1% gelatin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and chymostatin. The mixture was equilibrated to 400 p.s.i. for 20 min at 4 °C in a nitrogen bomb. The bomb was evacuated into an equal volume of 0.5 m KHCO3. The material was centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min, 104 × g for 20 min, and 105 × g for 45 min. The pellet was resuspended in 10 mm HEPES and homogenized with 20 strokes in a ground glass homogenizer. Membranes were treated with 6 m urea. Membrane aliquots were stored at –80 °C. Disulfide Trapping—The cross-linking procedure was modified from that described previously (32Falke J.J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1987; 237: 1596-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Cross-linking buffer (final concentrations 1.5 mm Cu(II)-(o-phenanthroline)3, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm Mg2+, 16.7 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) was added to membrane preparations for the desired amount of time. The reaction was terminated with 2× SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The samples were heated at 50 °C for 10 min and then resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of reducing agents. If reducing agents were used, the samples were treated with 200 mm dithiothreitol, after cross-linking was quenched with N-ethylmaleimide, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min, followed by 50 °C for 10 min in SDS sample buffer. The effects of cross-linking were examined by immunoblotting with anti-C5aR or anti-GFP antibodies and treatment with goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) horseradish peroxidase, followed by incubation with Lumi-LightPLUS substrate. Images were acquired by using the ChemiDoc Gel Documentation System (Bio-Rad) and analyzed with the program Quantity One (version 4). Disulfide Trapping of C5aR—To examine the oligomer structure of the C5a receptor, we utilized a disulfide-trapping strategy. In this analysis, cupric orthophenanthroline (CuP) acts as a redox catalyst in a reaction that uses dioxygen to oxidize free sulfhydryls. This reaction proceeds through a sulfur radical intermediate that can collide with a free sulfhydryl or another sulfur radical to form a disulfide bond (33Careaga C.L. Falke J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1219-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Therefore, if the C5a receptor oligomerizes, cupric orthophenanthroline treatment may produce a disulfide-linked dimer or oligomer if the interface has cysteine residues in close proximity. Disulfide trapping is a useful method to study contact interfaces, because the rate of disulfide bond formation is dependent upon the proximity and accessibility of the residues as well as the flexibility of the local protein structure. To facilitate this analysis, we generated stable cell lines expressing a C5aR-YFP fusion protein to aid in selection. Also, we used native membranes prepared in the absence of detergents to remove detergent-induced artifacts and then subsequently stripped the membranes with 6 m urea. Crosslinking with 1.5 mm cupric orthophenanthroline was performed for 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA to chelate the copper and N-ethylmaleimide to react with any free sulfhydryls. Reactions were resolved on a nonreducing SDS-PAGE gel. Probing with an antibody that recognizes the NH2 terminus of the C5a receptor shows that the C5aR-YFP monomer that migrates at 80 kDa is the predominant species in the absence of cupric orthophenanthroline treatment. The addition of oxidizing agent shows a time-dependent decrease in the 80-kDa species coupled with an increase in a 180-kDa immunoreactive species, near the expected size of a C5aRYFP dimer (Fig. 2A). The difference in size between the expected mobility of a C5aR-YFP dimer (160 kDa) and the observed mobility (180 kDa) was not unexpected, since the mobility on SDS-PAGE of disulfide-linked proteins can vary depending on the location of the disulfide bond and the resultant effects on secondary structure. For example, the mobility of dimeric forms of the aspartate sensory receptor, a 60-kDa monomer, varied from 120–150 kDa to 180 kDa, depending on which cysteines were involved in disulfide bond formation, yet all three dimeric complexes had a similar size as determined by gel filtration (34Milligan D.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6268-6275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that the observed dimer was not affected by epitope masking, we performed similar experiments using an antibody that recognizes YFP (Fig. 2B). In general, similar results were obtained, but the C5aR antibody recognizes proportionally more dimer (Fig. 2D). We believe this to be the result of NH2-terminal proteolysis that reduces the amount of monomer detected by the C5aR antibody, which recognizes an NH2-terminal epitope. Treatment with 200 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min after exposure to cupric orthophenanthroline demonstrated a nearly complete collapse of the 180-kDa species to the 80-kDa monomer (Fig. 2C), thus demonstrating that C5aR dimers are linked by a disulfide bond. Quantification of dimer formation demonstrated saturation of cross-linking after 16 min with 75 and 50% dimer formation detected by C5aR and GFP immunoblotting, respectively, yet with both antibodies the time required to reach half-maximal cross-linking is approximately 3 min. To determine whether accessory proteins have an effect on cross-linking efficiency, membranes that have been treated with urea were compared with untreated membranes (Fig. 3A). An identical cross-linking pattern was obtained, indicating that the presence of peripheral membrane proteins does not influence the ability of C5a receptors to cross-link. Treatment of membranes with urea has been shown to uncouple GPCRs from G proteins yet maintain receptor activity (35Lim W.K. Neubig R.R. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 337-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hartman J.I. Northup J.K. J. Biol.

Also, 5 m urea treatment can remove InaD, a PDZ domain-containing scaffold protein, from photoreceptor membranes (37Huber A. Sander P. Gobert A. Bahner M. Hermann R. Paulsen R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7036-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Similarly, 6 m urea treatment of CHO membranes containing C5aR receptor can uncouple receptor from G proteins. 2T. J. Baranski, unpublished observation. The C5a receptor has been shown to interact with β-arrestins (38Braun L. Christophe T. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4277-4285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and recently the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (39Tardif M. Brouchon L. Rabiet M.J. Boulay F. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 453-463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); interactions with these or other peripheral membrane proteins may aid in receptor oligomerization. The ability of C5aR to cross-link in the absence of peripheral membrane proteins argues that the oligomerization that we observe is a receptor-autonomous process. Moreover, we demonstrated that urea treatment had little effect on the ability of C5aR molecules to FRET in yeast (57Floyd D.H. Geva A. Bruinsma S.P. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Baranski T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35354-35361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To prove that the 180-kDa species is indeed a dimer of C5aR-YFP and to ensure that the YFP does not significantly influence dimer formation, we generated stable cell lines that express both C5aR (45 kDa) and C5aR-YFP (80 kDa). When cross-linking was performed in membranes containing both large (C5aR-YFP) and small (C5aR) receptors, we observed three predominant cross-linking products at 100, 140, and 180 kDa (Fig. 3B). These correspond to C5aR homodimer (100 kDa), C5aR/C5aR-YFP heterodimer (140 kDa), and C5aR-YFP homodimer (180 kDa). These data demonstrate that the YFP molecule, which has two additional cysteines, when fused to the COOH terminus of C5aR does not influence the crosslinking reaction, as evidenced by the nearly binomial distribution of the three C5aR dimer species. It is not surprising that the cysteines in YFP do not participate in cross-linking, since in the crystal structure they are not surface-accessible (40Wachter R.M. Elsliger M.A. Kallio K. Hanson G.T. Remington S.J. Structure. 1998; 6: 1267-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). However, it was important to dismiss YFP as a mediator of C5aR interaction, since it has been shown that GFP molecules can dimerize at high concentrations (41Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). Importantly, these results also support the claim that C5aR is cross-linking with other C5aR molecules and not a membrane-associated protein with a mass similar to the C5aR-YFP fusion protein. Cross-linking of Endogenous C5aR Molecules from Human Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes—To examine the oligomerization status of endogenously expressed C5aR molecules, we performed disulfide-trapping studies on membranes isolated from human neutrophils. Polymorphonuclear leukocyte membranes were prepared and treated with 6 m urea; membranes were then exposed to 1.5 mm cupric orthophenanthroline for 16 min before the reaction was terminated with N-ethylmaleimide and EDTA. In the absence of cupric orthophenanthroline treatment, immunoblotting with a C5aR antibody reveals one distinct band at 45 kDa corresponding to a C5aR monomer, whereas membrane oxidation resulted in an additional species migrating at 95 kDa (Fig. 4A). To examine the effect of C5a ligand on the extent of disulfide trapping, membranes were treated with 5 nm C5a for 30 min, and cross-linking was monitored. Ligand treatment has little or no effect on the extent of dimerization (Fig. 4B). These results strongly suggest that C5aR molecules form endogenous oligomers in their native environment and that oligomerization is not altered by ligand activation. Mutation of Cysteine 144 Abrogates Disulfide Trapping— C5aR has nine cysteines, two of which form the conserved TM 3-extracellular loop 2 disulfide bridge common among nearly all mammalian GPCRs (Fig. 1). To identify which of the native cysteines mediate the observed disulfide trapping, our strategy was to sequentially mutate the remaining seven cysteines in C5aR and to monitor the ability of these"

We describe here the structure and the biological action of a new cyclic peptide derived from vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This 17-amino acid molecule designated cyclopeptidic vascular endothelial growth inhibitor (cyclo-VEGI, CBO-P11) encompasses residues 79–93 of VEGF which are involved in the interaction with VEGF receptor-2. In aqueous solution, cyclo-VEGI presents a propensity to adopt a helix conformation that was largely unexpected because only β-sheet structures or random coil conformations have been observed for macrocyclic peptides. Cyclo-VEGI inhibits binding of iodinated VEGF165 to endothelial cells, endothelial cells proliferation, migration, and signaling induced by VEGF165. This peptide also exhibits anti-angiogenic activity in vivo on the differentiated chicken chorioallantoic membrane. Furthermore, cyclo-VEGI significantly blocks the growth of established intracranial glioma in nude and syngeneic mice and improves survival without side effects. Taken together, these results suggest that cyclo-VEGI is an attractive candidate for the development of novel angiogenesis inhibitor molecules useful for the treatment of cancer and other angiogenesis-related diseases.

Some of the residues important for the interaction between VEGF and kinase domain receptor are clustered within region 79–93 of VEGF which forms a β-hairpin, Arg82, Lys84, and His86 being key residues (27Muller Y.A.

Based on these structural and mutagenesis studies, a number of cyclic and linear peptides have been synthesized. One of the most potent compound was the cyclic peptide CBO-P11 (d-Phe-Pro79–93) designated herein cyclopeptidic vascular endothelial growth inhibitor (cyclo-VEGI). 2S. Shinkaruk, L. Zilberberg, X. Canron, C. Chauseau, M. Bayle, B. Desbas, A. Bikfalvi, and G. Deleris, manuscript in preparation. In the present report, we determined the structural features of this peptide and characterized its biological properties. We show that this peptide adopts an unexpected three-dimensional structure and is able to inhibit critical steps of angiogenesis. Moreover, this peptide inhibits the growth of both established human intracranial and syngeneic glioma in mice. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR samples were prepared at a 2 mm peptide concentration in water or in mixtures of TFE-d 3/water containing 10% D2O. All NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance spectrometers operating at a 1H frequency of 500 MHz and were processed with the Bruker XWINNMR program. One-dimensional spectra were acquired over 16 K data points using a spectral width of 5000 Hz and a reference to internal sodium 3-trimethylsilyl-(2,2,3,3-2H4)propionate at 0 ppm. Solvent suppression was achieved by presaturation during the relaxation delay (1.5 s) or with a WATERGATE sequence using pulsed field gradients (30Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3548) Google Scholar). Proton assignments were obtained at 288 and 298 K from the analysis of TOCSY (20- and 80-ms isotropic mixing times) and NOESY (150-, 200-, or 300-ms mixing times) spectra (31Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar, 32Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). Typically, two-dimensional data were collected with 400–600 t 1 increments and 2048 data points in t 2, over a spectral width of 6000 Hz in both dimensions. Prior to Fourier transformation in t 2 and t 1, the time domain data were multiplied by a π/3 shifted square sinebell function and zero-filled. Base-line distortions were corrected with a fifth-order polynomial function. 1H-13C HSQC experiments were acquired using pulsed field gradients for coherence selection (33Schleucher J. Schwendinger M. Sattler M. Schmidt P. Schedletzky O. Glaser S.J. Sorensen O.W. Griesinger C. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The chemical shift deviations of Ha and Ca were calculated using random coil values reported in water (34Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). The temperature gradients of the amide proton chemical shifts were derived from a series of TOCSY spectra recorded at different temperatures (from 283 to 303 K). The resonances assignments are listed in Tables S1–S3 in the Supplemental Material. Structure Calculation—Interproton distance restraints were derived from the analysis of NOESY spectra. NOE cross-peaks were categorized as strong, medium, and weak and converted into distance ranges of 0.18–0.28, 0.18–0.38, and 0.18–0.5 nm, accordingly. Pseudoatoms were introduced for distances involving methyl protons and non-resolved methylene protons, and upper limits were corrected appropriately (35Wuthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). The ϕ angle of l-amino acid residues was restrained to negative values because all these residues did not exhibit strong intraresidual dαN NOEs. Structures were calculated using InsightII version 98.0 and Discover (Accelrys, San Diego, Inc.), running on SGI O2 R10000 workstations, and AMBER forcefield (36Weiner S.J. Kollmann P.A. Nguyen D.T. Case D.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1986; 7: 230-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3609) Google Scholar). The simulated annealing protocol first comprised 15 ps of dynamics at 1000 K during which the force constants of the distance and dihedral restraint terms were gradually increased. The non-bond interaction, defined by a simple quartic repulsive potential, was slowly increased during the next 10 ps of dynamics. Finally, the structures were cooled from 1000 to 0 K over 25 ps. The structures were then minimized by steepest descent and conjugated gradient algorithms, using a Lennard-Jones potential for the van der Waals interaction and a distance-dependent dielectric screening of 4 ·r for the electrostatic term. Recombinant human FGF-2 was kindly provided by Dr. Hervé Prats (INSERM U397, Toulouse, France) and stored in sterile, double-distilled water at –80 °C. Recombinant human VEGF165 was produced in insect cells and purified as described elsewhere (37Cohen T. Gitay-Goren H. Neufeld G. Levi B.Z.

Human VEGF165-encoding baculovirus was a kind gift of Dr. Jean Plouët (Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Stucturale, UMR 5089, Toulouse, France). CBO-P11 (cyclo-VEGI) (DFPQIMRIKPHQGQHIGE) and linear control CBO-P14 (PQIMRIKPHQGQHIGE) peptides were synthesized by Fmoc/t-butyl batch solid phase synthesis on an Applied Biosystems 430A automated peptide synthesizer. For preparation of protected peptide fragments, pre-loaded acid-labile 2-chlorotrityl resins (H-His(Trt)2-ClTrt and H-Ile2-ClTrt resin) or HMPB-BHA resins based on BHA polystyrene functionalized with Rink's 4-hydroxymethyl-3-methoxyphenoxybutanoic acid linker (Fmoc-Gly-HMPB-BHA resin) were utilized. Subsequent Fmoc amino acids were coupled using a 4-fold excess of amino acids activated as HOBt ester by means of DCC. The crude linear protected peptides were analyzed by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a Lichrosorb RP-18 column (Merck) and purified on semi-preparative high pressure liquid chromatography. Cyclization of the protected linear precursor (head-to-tail) was performed by Fmoc/t-butyl/allyl strategy. 2S. Shinkaruk, L. Zilberberg, X. Canron, C. Chauseau, M. Bayle, B. Desbas, A.

Bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells were from Dr. Georg Breier (Department of Molecular Biology, Max-Planck-Institut für physiologische und Klinische Forschung, Bad Nauheim, Germany). All endothelial cells were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in DMEM containing 10% newborn calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 IU/ml streptomycin antibiotics and were used up to passage 25. BCE cells were grown in the presence of 2 ng/ml FGF-2. CHO-VEGFR2 and CHO-VEGFR1 cells were a kind gift of Dr. J. Plouët (GDR CNRS 1927 “Angiogenèse,” Toulouse, France). CHO-VEGFR2 and CHO-VEGFR1 were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids and antibiotics (Invitrogen). Balb3T3 were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. U87 human glioma cells (ATCC) were grown in minimum Eagle's α-medium, 10% FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. GL261 murine glioblastoma cells (a gift from Dr. David Zagzag, New York University, New York) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, and antibiotics. VEGF165 was labeled with Na125I using IODO-GEN (Pierce) as coupling agent according to the manufacturer's instructions. BAE, CHO-VEGFR2, and CHO-VEGFR1 cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105 density in gelatin-coated 6-well plates and cultured in complete medium for 2 days. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 10 ng/ml 125I-VEGF and peptides at indicated concentrations in binding medium (DMEM; 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4; 0.15% gelatin) on a shaker at 4 °C. After 2 h, cells were washed 3 times with PBS and solubilized by the addition of 2% Triton, 10% glycerol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin prior to γ-counting. Each condition was tested in duplicate and repeated at least two times. Data are expressed as percentage of total radioactivity. BCE and BAE cells were seeded in 24-well culture plates overnight in 10% newborn calf serum at 7500 cells per well. Medium was changed to 1% newborn calf serum, 10 ng/ml growth factor, and peptides at indicated concentrations were added to duplicate wells. After 48 h, medium was changed, and stimulation with growth factor and peptide treatment were repeated. One day later, cells were counted on a Coulter counter. Balb3T3 were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells/well in complete medium. Medium was changed to 0.5% fetal calf serum and 20 ng/ml human recombinant PDGF-BB (Sigma), and peptides at indicated concentrations were added to duplicate wells. Cells were counted 2 days later. U87 and GL261 cells were seeded at 10,000 cells/well in 1% FBS, treated with peptides at the same concentrations as ECs, and counted 72 h later. Each condition was tested in duplicate and repeated at least two times. BAE cells were plated in 35-mm plates. Subconfluent cultures were serum-deprived for 24 h. Peptides were then added for 6 min in the presence of 10 ng/ml VEGF165. Cells were scraped off the dish and lysed for 10 min on ice in Nonidet P-40/SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4; 75 mm NaCl; 1 mm EDTA; 1% Nonidet P-40; 0.1% SDS) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. The cleared supernatant was stored at –80 °C. Protein concentration was measured by using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). The cytoplasmic extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels under reducing conditions and electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blocked membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies (phospho-specific mitogen-activated protein kinase p42/p44 or mitogen-activated protein kinase p42/p44 were obtained from New England Biolabs, Ozyme, France), washed, and incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse or rabbit antibodies (Dako SA, Trappes, France). Detection of antibodies was performed using the ECLplus Western blot detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Each condition was tested at least two times. Migration test with BAE cells was performed using a method described earlier (39Hagedorn M. Zilberberg L. Lozano R.M. Cuevas P. Canron X. Redondo-Horcajo M. Gimenez-Gallego G. Bikfalvi A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 550-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In brief, ECs were seeded in 350-mm culture plates and were allowed to grow to confluence. Complete medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM, and incubation was continued overnight. One linear scar was drawn in the monolayer and divided into seven equal fields. A set of digital photos was taken of each scar, and the denuded area was marked using digital image analysis software (Lucia G, www.lim.cz). The dishes were washed and incubated with fresh serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10 ng/ml VEGF165, and peptides at indicated concentrations. After 16 h, cells were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde and counterstained (Giemsa), and a second set of photos was taken. Photos were superposed, and endothelial cells having migrated across the line drawn at the border of the scar in the first photo set were counted. Each condition was tested in two independent experiments. Means for all fields of each group were calculated; data are expressed in percentage of the mean number of migrated cells over VEGF165-induced cell migration. Fertilized chicken eggs (Gallus gallus) (E.A.R.L. Morizeau, Dangers, France) were incubated at 37 °C and 80% humidified atmosphere. On day 4 of development, a window was made in the eggshell and sealed with Durapore® tape. On day 13, plastic rings (made from Nunc Thermanox® coverslips) were put on the CAM. 3 μg of VEGF165 was premixed with 50 μg of peptides or with the equivalent volume of sterile water alone and deposed in the center of the plastic ring as described previously (21Hagedorn M. Zilberberg L. Wilting J. Canron X. Carrabba G. Giussani C. Pluderi M. Bello L. Bikfalvi A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6884-6890PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment was repeated the following day. On day 17, the CAMs were fixed in vivo with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and the area containing the ring was cut out for further analysis. Photos of each CAM were taken under a stereomicroscope (Nikon SMZ800) using a digital camera (Nikon Coolpix 950). Two observers scored the angiogenic response from 0 to 3 (0 = none, 1 = medium, 2 = medium/high, and 3 = high). The angiogenic score was indicated as the mean number from the two observers. Statistical analysis was carried out using Student's two-tailed t test. For confocal studies, 6 CAM samples for each condition were processed. Each sample was washed by incubation with 0.1% Triton in PBS. Fluorescein-Sambucus nigra lectin (M0928 Vector Laboratories) at 40 μg/ml was added, and incubation was performed in 0.1% Triton/PBS for half an hour at room temperature. Samples were washed 3 times with 0.1% Triton/PBS, 3 times with PBS, and rinsed 3 times with water. The samples were finally mounted and embedded with Antifading Prolong (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and viewed by confocal fluorescent microscopy at ×600 magnification equipped with an anti-bleed through control system based on sequential capture of the green signal (Nikon, PCM2000). Short-term Experiments—Groups of 10 6-week-old nude mice (Charles River Italia, Italy) were implanted intracranially with 50,000 U87 glioma cells using an open window technique. For the syngeneic model, groups of 10 6-week-old BALB/c mice (Charles River Italia) were implanted intracranially with 50,000 GL261 glioma cells using the same technique. In a first group of experiments, 12 days after tumor cell injection, groups of 10 nude or BALB/c mice each were treated intraperitoneally with 2 mg/kg/day of cyclo-VEGI or saline in a single shot. Treatment was continued for 28 days. Afterward, animals were sacrificed, and their brains were removed, embedded in OCT, and stored at –70 °C. In a second group of experiments, 12 days after tumor cell injection, two groups of 10 nude mice each were implanted subcutaneously with 2004 Alzet osmotic minipumps. The pumps used in these experiments afford a constant period of work of 28 days. In the first group, the pump reservoir was filled with 0.45 mg (total amount) of the cyclo-VEGI, which corresponds to 0.45 mg/kg/day. The second group of 10 animals was implanted with pumps containing PBS, and a third additional group did not receive any pumps. The last two groups served as the controls for the experiment. Animals were sacrificed when signs of any distress were evident and after 29 days from implantation of the pumps. Then the brains were removed, embedded in OCT, and stored at –70 °C. Long-term Experiments—For the long term experiments, groups of 10 nude mice each were implanted intracranially with 50,000 U87 glioblastoma cells using the same procedure described previously. Twelve days after tumor cell injection, a first group of animals was implanted subcutaneously with Alzet minipumps, and the reservoir was filled with 0.45 mg (total amount) of cyclo-VEGI (0.45 mg/kg/day). A second group of nude mice received subcutaneous minipumps containing saline and served as a control. Twenty-eight days later, the pump was changed with a new one containing the same amount of the inhibitor, in order to afford a 58-day period of treatment. Animals were carefully monitored for the occurrence of any side effects and immediately sacrificed at the occurrence of any neurological deficits. Seventy days after tumor cell implantation, all the remaining animals were sacrificed. All animal experiments were repeated at least two times. All brains were fixed in 5% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 24 h at 4 °C, dehydrated in 30% sucrose in PBS for 24 h at 4 °C, embedded in OCT, and stored at –70 °C. The brains were then sectioned, and a portion of them submitted to routine histological examination with hematoxylin and eosin staining. Tumor volume was calculated and expressed as a mean ± S.E. Tumor volume was estimated using the formula for ellipsoid (width2 × length)/2. The remaining slides were used for the immunohistochemistry analysis as described below. Kaplan-Meyer survival curves were statistically analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 5-μm sections. Immunohistochemistry on 5-μm sections was carried using the Vectastain Elite kit (Vector Laboratories). Primary antibodies include anti-CD31 (1:100 dilution, BD Biosciences) and anti-Ki-67 (1:100 dilution, Dako). Detection was carried out using DAB chromogen. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Negative control slides were obtained by omitting the primary antibody. Ki-67 staining was quantified by counting the number of positively stained cells of 100 nuclei in 20 randomly chosen fields (40Bello L. Giussani C. Carrabba G. Pluderi M. Lucini V. Pannacci M.

Microvessel count and density were scored as reported previously (40Bello L. Giussani C. Carrabba G. Pluderi M. Lucini V. Pannacci M. Caronzolo D. Tomei G. Villani R. Scaglione F. Carroll R.S.

Apoptotic cells were detected with ApopTag™ plus kit (Genenco International, New York) with 1% methyl green as a counterstain. Apoptosis and proliferative indices were quantified by determining the percentage of positively stained cells for all nuclei in 20 randomly chosen fields per section at ×200 magnification (40Bello L. Giussani C. Carrabba G. Pluderi M. Lucini V. Pannacci M. Caronzolo D. Tomei G. Villani R. Scaglione F. Carroll R.S. Bikfalvi A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 3539-3548PubMed Google Scholar). Secondary Structure—Standard NMR methodology was used to obtain sequence-specific assignments of proton resonances in water and in TFE/water mixtures at two different ratios, 15:85 or 30:70 (v/v). TOCSY spectra were used to identify spin systems, and NOESY spectra were used to obtain inter residue connectivities (42Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The 13C resonances of Cα carbons were assigned from 13C-1H HSQC spectra. Weak additional resonances could be observed in the"
https://openalex.org/W2067042270,"A recombinant form of CAMP factor of Streptococcus agalactiae has been expressed as glutathione S-transferase-CAMP fusion protein in Escherichia coli. After thrombin cleavage of the fusion protein, the recombinant CAMP factor exhibited hemolytic activity comparable with that of the native form. Osmotic protection experiments with polyethylene glycols show that CAMP factor forms discrete transmembrane pores with a diameter upward of 1.6 nm on susceptible membranes; electron microscopy reveals circular membrane lesions of heterogeneous size, up to 12–15 nm in diameter. Liposome permeabilization studies show that pore formation is a highly cooperative process, which suggests that it involves the oligomerization of CAMP factor. Chemical cross-linking experiments also support an oligomeric mode of action. A recombinant form of CAMP factor of Streptococcus agalactiae has been expressed as glutathione S-transferase-CAMP fusion protein in Escherichia coli.

Liposome permeabilization studies show that pore formation is a highly cooperative process, which suggests that it involves the oligomerization of CAMP factor. Chemical cross-linking experiments also support an oligomeric mode of action. The CAMP reaction consists of a distinct zone of hemolysis on blood agar plates produced by Streptococcus agalactiae when grown near the colonies of Staphylococcus aureus (1Christie R. Atkins N.E. Munch-Peterson E. Aust. J. Exp. Biol. Med. Sci. 1944; 22: 197-200Crossref Google Scholar). It has been used in diagnostic microbiology to identify the S. agalactiae strains ever since its discovery in 1944 by Christie et al. (1Christie R. Atkins N.E. Munch-Peterson E. Aust. J. Exp. Biol. Med. Sci. 1944; 22: 197-200Crossref Google Scholar). The proteins responsible for the CAMP reaction are sphingomyelinase from S. aureus and CAMP factor, a protein secreted by S. agalactiae that has a molecular weight of 25 kDa and a pI of 8.9 (2Jurgens D. Shalaby F.Y. Fehrenbach F.J. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 348: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Sphingomyelinase initially hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to ceramide, which renders the erythrocytes susceptible to the lytic activity of CAMP factor. Erythrocytes from different mammalian species support the CAMP reaction to different extents depending on the sphingomyelin content in their cell membranes (3Sterzik B. Fehrenbach F.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 817-820PubMed Google Scholar). Sheep red blood cells are the most susceptible, in keeping with their sphingomyelin content as high as 51% (by moles) (4Ways P. Hanahan D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 318-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human red blood cells and rabbit red blood cells, with 26 and 19% mol of sphingomyelin, respectively (4Ways P. Hanahan D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 318-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nelson G.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 144: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), were reportedly not sensitive to CAMP factor after sphingomyelinase treatment (3Sterzik B. Fehrenbach F.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 817-820PubMed Google Scholar). The latter, however, were rendered susceptible to the CAMP factor after phospholipase C treatment, which converted the glycerophospholipids to diacylglycerol (6Fehrenbach F.J. Schmidt C.M. Sterizik B. Jürgens D. Alouf J.E. Fehrenbach F.J. Freer J.H. Jeljaszewicz J. Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, San Diego1984: 317-324Google Scholar), indicating that ceramide is not specifically required for CAMP activity. Previous work with liposomes also suggested that the fraction of cholesterol in the membrane influences the activity of CAMP factor (6Fehrenbach F.J. Schmidt C.M. Sterizik B. Jürgens D. Alouf J.E. Fehrenbach F.J. Freer J.H. Jeljaszewicz J. Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, San Diego1984: 317-324Google Scholar, 7Sterzik B. Schmidt C.M. Fehrenbach F.J. Alouf J.E. Fehrenbach F.J. Freer J.H. Jeljaszewicz J. Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, San Diego1984: 195-196Google Scholar). CAMP factor has long been known as a pathogenic determinant that exerted lethal effects when administered to rabbits and mice (8Skalka B. Smola J. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. A. 1981; 249: 190-194PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from its membrane damaging activity, CAMP factor was found to bind to the Fc fragments of immunoglobulins, and it was therefore designated as protein B in analogy to protein A of S. aureus (9Jurgens D. Sterzik B. Fehrenbach F.J. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 720-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The CAMP factor genes of S. agalactiae (10Schneewind O. Friedrich K. Lutticken R. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2174-2179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Streptococcus uberis (11Jiang M. Babiuk L.A. Potter A.A. Microb. Pathog. 1996; 20: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and Streptococcus pyogenes (12Gase K. Ferretti J.J. Primeaux C. McShan W.M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4725-4731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been cloned in Escherichia coli, and their sequences were found to be highly homologous with each other (12Gase K. Ferretti J.J. Primeaux C. McShan W.M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4725-4731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Co-hemolytic phenomena have also been reported with various other bacterial genera, but the proteins responsible for those, although sometimes referred to by the name “CAMP factor” as well, are not closely related to streptococcal CAMP factor. In this study, we expressed the CAMP factor as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in E. coli. The fusion protein was purified to homogeneity and cleaved by thrombin to yield the recombinant CAMP factor, which exhibited hemolytic activity similar to the native protein. We show that CAMP factor forms pores of finite yet heterogeneous size in the membranes of susceptible cells. Additional studies with liposomes show that the process of CAMP factor pore formation is highly cooperative, supporting an oligomeric nature of the membrane lesion. Cloning, Plasmids, and Bacterial Strains—pGEX-KG (13Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Jingya Li (National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai, China). The coding sequence of CAMP factor mature peptide was amplified from S. agalactiae genomic DNA. The following primers were used: forward, 5′-TTT GCC GAT CAA GTG ACA ACT CCA C-3′; reverse, 5′-CAA TCA TGG TAG TAC AAA ATC ACG A-3′. The amplified DNA was cloned into the pET-30a+ plasmid. The insert was then digested with NcoI and XhoI and ligated into NcoI-XhoI-digested pGEX-KG vector. The insert from pET-30a+ was sequenced and matched the published mature peptide sequence for CAMP factor (14Ruhlmann J. Wittmann-Liebold B. Jurgens D. Fehrenbach F.J. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of CAMP Factor—The protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells. A starter culture (20 ml of Luria Bertani broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin) of transformed cells was grown at 37 °C overnight. This overnight culture was then inoculated into 1 liter of Luria Bertani broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The culture was shaken vigorously at 30 °C until the A 600 reached 0.8. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was grown for an additional 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –20 °C overnight. The frozen cells were thawed on ice for 15 min and resuspended in 20 ml of PBS buffer (16 mm K2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The cells were then lysed by sonication. Triton X-100 was added to the bacterial lysate to a final concentration of 1% (w/v). The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The fusion protein was purified from the supernatant. The purification procedure was essentially as described by Guan and Dixon (13Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). The supernatant was mixed with 20 ml of 50% (v/v) glutathione-agarose beads and gently shaken at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were washed four times with 10 ml of PBST buffer (PBS buffer with 1% Triton) at 4 °C, once with PBS buffer, and twice with thrombin cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0) at room temperature. After centrifugation, the agarose beads were mixed with 2 ml of thrombin cleavage buffer containing 12 μg of thrombin. The suspension was incubated with gentle shaking at room temperature for 1 h and centrifuged. The beads were washed with thrombin cleavage buffer twice to retrieve the cleaved protein, and the supernatants were pooled. This procedure typically yielded about 4 mg of purified CAMP factor/liter of liquid culture. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method. Purification of Glutathione S-Transferase-CAMP Fusion Protein— The GST 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; PEG, polyethylene glycol; PC, phosphatidylcholine; C12-ceramide, N-lauroryl-d-erythro-sphingosine; C20-ceramide, N-arachidoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine.-CAMP protein (15Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5036) Google Scholar) bound to the glutathione agarose beads was eluted three times with 2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm glutathione (pH 7.5). Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were measured using a Jasco J-715 circular dichroism spectrometer (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) with a 1-mm path length cuvette. The protein (0.08 mg/ml, 3 μm) was in 8 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The samples were scanned 10 times from 180 to 250 nm with an 0.5-nm interval. CD spectra were corrected for background and analyzed for protein secondary structure using the CONTIN, CDSSTR and SELCON programs with the 43-protein reference set (cryst.bbk.ac.uk/cdweb/) (16Lobley A. Wallace B.A. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 373aGoogle Scholar, 17Lobley A. Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 18Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2486) Google Scholar). The secondary structure was also analyzed with the prediction program GOR IV (npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr). Lysis of Sheep Red Blood Cells—Sheep red blood cells (Cedarlane, Hornby, Ontario, Canada) were washed five times in hemolysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) by centrifugation. The erythrocytes were then resuspended in hemolysis buffer to 0.5% (v/v). The cells were incubated at room temperature for 5 min in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 and with or without 50 milliunits/ml sphingomyelinase from S. aureus (EC 3.1.4.12, Sigma). 180 μl of cell suspension was added to the wells of a microplate containing different amounts of CAMP factor in 20 μl of the former buffer. Hemolysis was measured by the decrease in turbidity (A 650) using a 96-well plate reader (Spectramax 190, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For osmotic protection by polyethylene glycol (PEG), the red cells were made to 5% (v/v) suspension followed by incubation with 500 milliunits/ml sphingomyelinase at room temperature. 20 μl of the erythrocyte suspension was added to 180 μl of hemolysis buffer containing CAMP factor and PEGs of various molecular weights at 30 mm. Hemolysis was assayed by cell turbidity as described above (experiments depicted in Fig. 4A) or by measuring the optical density of the released hemoglobin at 540 nm (after spinning down cells and membranes; experiments shown in Fig. 4B). Control samples without CAMP factor remained stable during the assay period. Binding of CAMP Factor to Erythrocyte Membranes—Sheep erythrocytes were lysed osmotically in 5 mm phosphate buffer and washed several times until the membrane pellets became white. Membranes were suspended in hemolysis buffer with 10 mm MgCl2 and pretreated with or without 0.18 units/ml sphingomyelinase for 10 min at 37 °C. CAMP factor protein or GST-CAMP fusion protein was added. After incubation at 37 °C for one-half hour, the mixtures were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min and washed twice with the hemolysis buffer. The membrane pellet was dissolved in 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 10% sodium deoxycholate (w/v), pH 8.0. The dissolved membrane pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE or by gel filtration. For SDS-PAGE, 300 μg/ml lipids and 17 μg/ml protein were used. For gel filtration, the concentration of lipids and CAMP factor was 150 and 174 μg/ml, respectively. The protein concentration of the membrane was determined by the Bradford method, and the lipid concentration was estimated by assuming the lipid to protein ratio is 1:1 by weight. Preparation of Liposomes—All lipids were purchased from Avanti Lipids (Alabaster, AL), with the exception of bovine brain ceramide (Sigma). The lipids, dissolved in chloroform, were mixed in various molar ratios (see “Results”), dried down under nitrogen in a round-bottom flask, and then dried under vacuum for an additional 3 h to remove the residual solvent. The dried lipids were hydrated at room temperature for 1 h in 1 ml of 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm calcein, pH 7.4, by vigorous vortexing. For ceramide-containing liposomes, the suspension was warmed to 45 °C during hydration. The suspension was frozen at –20 °C and thawed at room temperature. The lipid suspension was sized down to unilamellar liposomes using a liposome extruder (Northern Lipids, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) by extrusion 10 times through a polycarbonate membrane with a 100-nm pore size. The extruder was thermostatted to 45 °C to facilitate processing of the ceramide-containing liposomes. The non-entrapped calcein was removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 pre-equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The lipid concentration was determined by an enzymatic cholesterol assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For liposomes without cholesterol, the lipid concentration was estimated from the encapsulated liposome volume (19Deamer D.W. Uster P.S. Osco M.J. in Liposomes. Marcel Dekker, New York1983: 27-51Google Scholar). Calcein Release Assay—All fluorescence measurements were performed on a Fuorolog 3 spectrofluorimeter (Instruments S.A., Jobin Yvon/Spex Division, Edison, NJ). The liposomes with entrapped calcein (final lipid concentration 60 μg/ml) were mixed with various amounts of CAMP factor in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4 buffer. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the samples were diluted with the same buffer, and calcein fluorescence intensity was measured immediately (excitation, 480 nm; emission, 520 nm). The fraction of calcein released was calculated by deducting the fluorescence intensity of a control sample incubated without CAMP factor. 100% release was obtained from a liposome sample lysed by sodium deoxycholate. Gel Filtration—Gel filtration chromatography of solubilized membranes and CAMP factor was performed using a Sephacryl HR 300 (Amersham Biosciences) column (diameter, 16 mm; length, 25 cm). The column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 6 mm sodium deoxycholate, pH 8.0. The samples containing erythrocyte membranes were pelleted and dissolved in 500 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10% sodium deoxycholate, pH 8.0), applied to the column and eluted with equilibration buffer. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Chemical Cross-linking of CAMP Factor—CAMP factor (final concentration 0.17 mg/ml) was first incubated with the liposomes (total lipids, 0.2 mg/ml) in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4 at 37 °C for 30 min. The cross-linking reagent, glutaraldehyde (Sigma), was then added to 2.5 mm, and the samples were incubated again at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Tris to 0.1 m. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Electron Microscopy—Sheep red blood cells were treated with sphingomyelinase as described above, incubated, and lysed with 70 μg/ml CAMP factor, and the membranes were collected by centrifugation. The membranes were washed three times with 5 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) and mounted onto carbon-coated grids (Formvar/copper, 200 mesh, Marivac Ltd.) followed by negative staining with sodium phosphotungstate (2% (w/v), pH 7.4) for 5 s. Membranes were then examined in a LEO 912 AB Omega electron microscope operated at 100 kV. Cloning, Recombinant Expression, and Purification of CAMP Factor—The coding sequence for CAMP factor was amplified by PCR, cloned, and sequenced from a laboratory strain of S. agalactiae. A BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) search was performed. The coding sequence was found to deviate at two positions from the published sequence of CAMP factor of S. agalactiae (20Podbielski A. Blankenstein O. Lutticken R. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. (Berl.). 1994; 183: 239-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels. However, the coding sequence of the CAMP factor mature peptide exactly matched the amino acid sequence of protein B, the alias of CAMP factor of S. agalactiae (14Ruhlmann J. Wittmann-Liebold B. Jurgens D. Fehrenbach F.J. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These differences may arise from the different sources of the bacterial strains. We initially tried to clone the CAMP factor gene into a high copy number vector, pT7-α vector in E. coli, but failed to get any positive clones. This result may be related to previous reports on the cloning of CAMP factor genes from different bacterial strains (10Schneewind O. Friedrich K. Lutticken R. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2174-2179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jiang M. Babiuk L.A. Potter A.A. Microb. Pathog. 1996; 20: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12Gase K. Ferretti J.J. Primeaux C. McShan W.M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4725-4731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which either used low copy number plasmids, resulting in very low expression levels in E. coli, or recovered clones carrying mutations in the promoter region. This suggests that CAMP factor may be toxic to the bacterial cells. We next tried to express the CAMP factor, including its signal peptide, in Bacillus subtilis, reasoning that secretion from a Gram-positive cell should be more similar to the physiological situation in streptococci and, therefore, be less hampered by toxicity. However, when expression was induced by xylose (21Rygus T. Hillen W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1991; 35: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the cultures became lytic, and very low CAMP activity was obtained. Therefore, toxicity appears to pertain to Gram-positive cells as well. We finally used the pGEX-KG expression vector, which yields a protein expressed as glutathione S-transferase-CAMP factor fusion protein. The 53-kDa fusion protein was purified following a well established protocol (13Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar, 15Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5036) Google Scholar). The fusion protein absorbed to the glutathione-agarose beads was directly cleaved by thrombin, and the 27-kDa cleavage product was released immediately from the agarose beads (Fig. 1A). The cleaved protein has 20 amino acids derived from the vector attached to the N terminus of the wild-type CAMP factor. This N-terminal extension had no apparent effect on the activity of CAMP factor. Secondary Structure Prediction and Circular Dichroism— The GOR IV secondary structure prediction program suggests that the protein consists mainly of an α-helix (42%) with 16% β-strand. The percentage of α-helix is somewhat lower in the estimate derived from the observed CD spectrum of the CAMP factor (Fig. 1B). The three programs, CONTIN, SELCON, and CDSSTR, yielded similar results, which indicates that there is about 30% α-helix, 19% β-strands, 22% turns, and 29% random coil. Hemolytic Activity of CAMP Factor on Sheep Erythrocytes—We found that 50% hemolysis of could be achieved in 25 min at 25 °C with 1.25 ng/ml CAMP factor (Fig. 2A). The hemolytic activity of the recombinant CAMP factor thus is comparable with the previous data obtained with wild-type CAMP factor, for which values of 1.75 ng/ml (22Bernheimer A.W. Linder R. Avigad L.S. Infect. Immun. 1979; 23: 838-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or 1 ng/ml (7Sterzik B. Schmidt C.M. Fehrenbach F.J. Alouf J.E. Fehrenbach F.J. Freer J.H. Jeljaszewicz J. Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, San Diego1984: 195-196Google Scholar) have been reported. The CAMP factor could lyse the sheep red blood cells alone even without sphingomyelinase treatment. However, a concentration of 12 μg/ml CAMP factor was needed to achieve an equivalent extent of hemolysis (also note that the kinetics is somewhat different; Fig. 2B). The untreated cells thus are about 10,000 times less susceptible to CAMP factor than the sphingomyelinase-treated ones. The uncleaved GST-CAMP fusion protein possessed very low hemolytic activity, being about 5,000 times less active than the thrombin-cleaved protein (data not shown). This finding may be related to the observed lack of toxicity during expression. Binding of CAMP Factor to Sheep Erythrocyte Membranes— The CAMP protein was incubated with red blood cell membranes with or without prior sphingomyelinase treatment. After incubation, the mixture was centrifuged and washed twice to remove the unbound protein. Fig. 3 shows that CAMP factor bound efficiently to the sphingomyelinase-treated membranes. It also shows that CAMP factor could bind to the untreated cell membranes, although the binding efficiency was much lower. GST-CAMP fusion protein also bound efficiently to the sphingomyelinase-treated red blood cell membranes. The intact binding but low hemolytic activity of GST-CAMP suggests that membrane binding and cell lysis are separate, successive events, and that the N terminus of the CAMP molecule may be involved in the latter step. CAMP Factor Is a Pore-forming Protein—Membrane-damaging toxins may act through two mechanisms. One mechanism involves enzymatic hydrolysis of phospholipids, which will directly disrupt the membrane structure and eventually lead to the cell lysis. In contrast, pore-forming proteins damage erythrocytes through a colloid-osmotic mechanism. They form channels on the target cell membranes, causing the leakage of small molecules such as ions and metabolites, whereas large molecules such as hemoglobin cannot pass through the channels. This will lead to an increased intracellular osmotic pressure and the influx of water into the cell, resulting in the bursting of cells. Adding polymeric solutes to the cell suspension can inhibit this colloid-osmotic process. With increasing molecular weight, these solutes will finally become too large to move freely through the pores, thus counterbalancing the osmotic pressure caused by the intracellular macromolecules. Therefore, the osmotic protection can be used to detect pores of defined size. Previous studies on CAMP factor showed that after lysis of liposomes with CAMP factor, no change in lipid composition had occurred, so that enzymatic activity was not required for membrane damage (22Bernheimer A.W. Linder R. Avigad L.S. Infect. Immun. 1979; 23: 838-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that CAMP factor might possess pore-forming activity. Fig. 4A shows that PEG 6000 and PEG 8000 cause a pronounced delay of hemolysis; lysis is even slower with PEG 10,000. In contrast, PEG 1000 and PEG 4000 have no protective effect on CAMP factor-mediated hemolysis. When cells were incubated with CAMP factor in the presence of PEG 10,000, washed twice in the same buffer, and resuspended in buffer without PEG, hemolysis occurred immediately. This confirmed that pore formation had indeed proceeded in the presence of PEG, indicating that PEG had worked by osmotic protection but not by directly inhibiting the binding or lytic action of CAMP factor. These data strongly suggest that CAMP factor forms pores with a defined diameter on susceptible membranes. Given that the hydrodynamic radii of PEG 4000 and PEG 6000 are 1.6 and 2.7 nm, respectively (23Kuga S. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 206: 449-461Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar), these experiments suggested that the diameter of CAMP factor pore is between these two values. Prompted by the finding of larger pores by electron microscopy (see below, Fig. 5), we repeated the osmotic protection experiments with different dosages of CAMP factor. Fig. 4B shows that the osmo-protective effect of PEG 6000 is diminished and finally abrogated at higher concentrations of toxin. This finding is in line with the assumption of heterogeneous pore size, with the smaller pores being more prevalent than large ones, at least at low concentrations of toxin. Electron Microscopy of CAMP Factor Pores—On sheep red cell membranes pretreated with sphingomyelinase and then exposed to high concentrations of CAMP factor, we observed discrete, circumscribed membrane lesions of various sizes (Fig. 5). Although the smallest pores were just discernible against the background, larger ones reached diameters of 12 nm and beyond. Some pores were round and regular in shape (Fig. 5D), whereas others appeared quite irregular (Fig. 5, B and C). Similar findings have been reported previously with streptolysin O (24Bhakdi S. Tranum-Jensen J. Sziegoleit A. Infect. Immun. 1985; 47: 52-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Palmer M. Harris R. Freytag C. Kehoe M. Tranum-Jensen J. Bhakdi S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1598-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In comparison with the latter toxin, the pores created by CAMP factor appear to be lined by a more delicate seam of protein, which may reflect the smaller molecular mass of CAMP factor (27 kDa as compared with 60 kDa for streptolysin O). Oligomeric State of CAMP Factor—Gel filtration performed on CAMP factor showed that it was monomeric in solution, as it was eluted from a Sephacryl HR 300 column between β-lactoglobulin (35 kDa) and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa) markers (data not shown). With many pore-forming toxins, the pore oligomers are stable upon membrane solubilization by SDS or other detergents. However, we could not detect any oligomer formation on membranes by SDS-PAGE (cf. Fig. 6B, lane 4). To test whether the pore oligomer is stable in nondenaturing detergents, we incubated the CAMP protein with susceptible membranes, which were then solubilized with deoxycholate and analyzed by gel filtration. Again, only one peak was observed (Fig. 6A), which eluted at the same position as the toxin sample that had not been incubated with membranes. Therefore, no stable oligomers were observed after membrane solubilization with either denaturing or nondenaturing detergent, suggesting either that CAMP factor does not oligomerize or that the oligomer is stable only on the lipid membrane. To detect oligomers on membranes, we performed chemical cross-linking on CAMP factor incubated with liposomes consisting of ceramide (40%), cholesterol (45%), and phosphatidylcholine (15%). Fig. 6B shows that oligomeric forms were indeed produced upon treatment with glutaraldehyde. Considering the low susceptibility of the liposomal membranes to CAMP factor (see below), the relatively high efficiency of cross-linking also suggests the existence of non-lytic oligomeric stages on liposome membranes. Liposome Permeabilization Studies—In previous studies, the activity of CAMP factor was found to be related to the amount of diacylglycerol or ceramide and the amount of cholesterol in both natural and artificial membranes (6Fehrenbach F.J. Schmidt C.M. Sterizik B. Jürgens D. Alouf J.E. Fehrenbach F.J. Freer J.H. Jeljaszewicz J. Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, San Diego1984: 317-324Google Scholar, 7Sterzik B. Schmidt C.M. Fehrenbach F.J. Alouf J.E. Fehrenbach F.J. Freer J.H. Jeljaszewicz J. Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, San Diego1984: 195-196Google Scholar). Therefore, liposome membranes containing different concentrations of ceramide or diacylglycerol might offer a good model for studying the action of CAMP factor on bilayers and for better understanding the effects of lipid composition on the activity of CAMP factor. Fig. 7 shows the CAMP-induced calcein release from liposomes of various lipid compositions. The following observations were made. 1) The extent of liposome permeabilization is not linearly related to the CAMP factor concentration. Instead, there is very little permeabilization until a threshold concentration is reached; the percentage of calcein release then increases from 20 to 100% by merely doubling the protein concentration. This cooperative dose-effect correlation is in line with an oligomeric mode of action of CAMP factor during membrane permeabilization. 2) Contrary to what we had expected, ceramide did not augment the activity of CAMP factor on the liposomes, even at molar fractions as high as 40%; this applied to C12-ceramide (Fig. 7A) and to C20-ceramide as well as ceramide isolated from bovine brain (not shown). We found, however, that cholesterol was important. When the cholesterol concentration was increased from 25 to 45%, the liposomes became three times more sensitive, whereas cholesterol-free liposomes were insensitive (Fig. 7B). The latter finding concurs with previous reports that the cholesterol content in the membrane affected the CAMP activity on liposome membranes (6Fehrenbach F.J. Schmidt C.M. Sterizik B. Jürgens D. Alouf J.E. Fehrenbach F.J. Freer J.H. Jeljaszewicz J. Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, San Diego1984: 317-324Google Scholar). 3) Even with the most susceptible model membranes used, the concentration of CAMP factor needed to elicit a substantial liposome permeabilization was more than a thousand times higher than that required with sphingomyelinase-treated red blood cells but was very similar to the concentration required with untreated erythrocytes (cf. Fig. 2). The low activity of CAMP factor on the liposomes might potentially arise from inefficient membrane binding or from low activity of membrane-bound CAMP factor. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed the following experiments. First, the ratio of membrane lipids and CAMP factor was kept constant, whereas the absolute amounts of both were varied. If binding were efficient and quantitative at low concentrations, then the extent of membrane permeabilization should be the same. This effect, however, was not observed (Fig. 8A). On the other hand, if binding were very inefficient, then increasing amounts of membranes should not significantly deplete CAMP factor from solution; a fixed amount of CAMP factor should therefore permeabilize any amount of liposomes to approximately the same degree, which was not observed either (Fig. 8B). This suggests that CAMP factor is partially depleted with increasing membrane concentration. The weak effect of CAMP factor on the liposome membrane therefore probably is not due to weak binding only but in part to the low pore forming activity of the bound toxin. The present study shows that CAMP factor forms large oligomeric pores in susceptible membranes. The size of these pores is between those of streptolysin O (24Bhakdi S. Tranum-Jensen J. Sziegoleit A. Infect. Immun. 1985; 47: 52-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the terminal complement complex (and perforin) (24Bhakdi S. Tranum-Jensen J. Sziegoleit A. Infect. Immun. 1985; 47: 52-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sauer H. Pratsch L. Fritzsch G. Bhakdi S. Peters R. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). With both streptolysin O and complement, pores may vary considerably in functional diameter (24Bhakdi S. Tranum-Jensen J. Sziegoleit A. Infect. Immun. 1985; 47: 52-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Palmer M. Harris R. Freytag C. Kehoe M. Tranum-Jensen J. Bhakdi S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1598-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 26Sauer H. Pratsch L. Fritzsch G. Bhakdi S. Peters R. Biochem.

In contrast to many other pore-forming proteins (including streptolysin O and complement), the oligomers of CAMP factor are not stable following membrane solubilization. This finding is not unprecedented with pore-forming peptides and proteins; e.g. even though evidence of oligomerization on membranes has been obtained with several pore-forming peptides such as melittin (28Hider R.C. Khader F. Tatham A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 728: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or magainin (29Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11361-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) and with Bacillus thuringiensis δ-endotoxin (30Soberon M. Perez R.V. Nunez-Valdez M.E. Lorence A. Gomez I. Sanchez J. Bravo A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 191: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), stable oligomers of these molecules have not been recovered from the membranes. (With δ-endotoxin, aggregates do form pores on brush border membrane vesicles; from these, only trimers were extracted, whereas the stoichiometry of the oligomer was expected to be larger than 3 (31Aronson A.I. Geng C. Wu L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 2503-2507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). CAMP factor displays little sequence homology to other poreforming proteins, the closest match being colicin Ia, which scores 20% identity when allowing for 10 gaps in the alignment. Because this alignment does not span the putative poreforming domains of colicin Ia (32Ghosh P. Mel S.F. Stroud R.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 134: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), this homology does not permit the prediction of the tertiary structure of CAMP factor in the membrane-inserted oligomeric form. Structure and structure-function relationships therefore await experimental elucidation. As with other pore-forming proteins, two phases can be distinguished in the action of CAMP factor: membrane binding, and pore formation, which presumably involves oligomerization. Although sphingomyelinase treatment very clearly increased membrane binding, this difference does not fully account for the observed difference in membrane susceptibility. It therefore seems that the oligomerization/pore formation step is affected by the change in lipid composition as well. Although model liposomes were susceptible to CAMP factor to limited extent, CAMP factor was not any more active on liposomes containing ceramide than on those without. This is in striking contrast to the red cells, which were sensitized 10,000-fold by sphingomyelinase treatment, and suggests that the role of ceramide does not consist in a direct interaction with the protein. It remains to be determined what property or component of the red cell membrane accounts for the sensitizing effect of ceramide. Another open question is what the physiological role of CAMP factor might be. The apparent toxicity of CAMP factor for bacterial cells, which was observed in the initial attempts to achieve expression, led us to speculate that bacteria might be relevant as a target of CAMP factor in vivo. However, addition of purified CAMP factor to E. coli or B. subtilis cultures did not detectably affect cell viability; CAMP factor may therefore be toxic to bacterial cells only from the inside. Further studies on its mode of action need to be performed with different types of cells and model membranes to reach a better understanding of the physiological significance of CAMP factor. Although cholesterol has a strong effect on membrane susceptibility, the specificity of the sterol requirement has not yet been examined in detail, and the apparent toxicity of CAMP factor for bacterial cells suggests that it might be functionally replaced by nonsterol lipids in the target membrane.

Here we show that the Y-box-binding protein, YB1, acts as a negative regulator of p53. Using reporter assays we show that YB1 represses transcription of the p53 promoter in a sequence-specific manner. We also show that YB1 reduces endogenous levels of p53, which in turn reduces p53 activity. Conversely, inhibiting YB1 in a variety of tumor cell lines induces p53 activity, resulting in significant apoptosis via a p53-dependent pathway. These data suggest that YB1 may, in some situations, protect cells from p53-mediated apoptosis, indicating that YB1 may be a good target for the development of new therapeutics.

These data suggest that YB1 may, in some situations, protect cells from p53-mediated apoptosis, indicating that YB1 may be a good target for the development of new therapeutics. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is the mechanism by which damaged, modified or superfluous cells are removed from a complex organism (1Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar). Another important role for apoptosis is preventing the development of cancer by removing cells with mutated or damaged DNA in order to preserve the integrity of the genome (2Lane D. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4401) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a pivotal part in this and consequently has been termed the “guardian of the genome” (2Lane D. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4401) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage, p53 is “activated” and initiates either growth arrest or apoptosis pathways (3Kastan M.B. Canman C.E. Leonard C.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). This allows DNA damage to be repaired or potential tumor precursor cells to be removed from tissues. Both pathways are initiated probably via the transcriptional activation of specific genes by p53.

Consistent with its important tumor suppressor role, more than 50% of human cancers contain mutations in the p53 gene, encoding a protein that is inactive for some or all of the functions of p53 (10Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar). In the other 50% of cancers there is selection against other components of the p53 signaling pathway, suggesting that p53 may be functionally inactive in the vast majority of cancers. Thus, there appears to be a powerful selection against functional p53 during tumor development. The Y-box-binding protein, YB1, belongs to the family of cold shock proteins, which is highly conserved from bacteria to man. YB1 is multifunctional and appears to regulate gene expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels (11Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P.

For example, the fas gene promoter is repressed by YB1 (13Lasham A. Lindridge E. Rudert F. Onrust R. Watson J. Gene. 2000; 252: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and stimulated by wt p53 (19Tamura T. Aoyama N. Saya H. Haga H. Futami S. Miyamoto M. Koh T. Ariyasu T. Tachi M. Kasuga M.

Science. 1992; 255: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). These data suggest that YB1 might negatively regulate p53. In this study we present evidence that YB1 represses the p53 promoter and down-regulates endogenous p53 expression. We then show that a reduction of YB1 in several tumor cell lines results in an induction of apoptosis via the activation of a p53 pathway. If this occurs in vivo, then these observations suggest that YB1 may play a role in the development of some tumors by protecting cells from apoptosis induced by p53. Oligonucleotides—For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, oligonucleotides were synthesized as follows: –169 to –117 of the mouse p53 promoter (20Bienz-Tadmor B. Zakut-Houri R. Libresco S. Givol D. Oren M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3209-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), strand 1, 5′-AGGAGCCCTCCGAATCGGTTTCCACCCATTTTGCCCTCACAGCTCTATATCTT-3′, and strand 2, 5′-AAGATATAGAGCTGTGAGGGCAAAATGGGTGGAAACCGATTCGGAGG GCTCCT-3′; YB1 cis-element derived from the fas silencer region (–1035 to –1008 bp of the 5′-flanking sequence of the human fas gene (13Lasham A.

For transfection, phosphorothioated oligonucleotides were synthesized as follows. YB1 cis-element decoy was derived from the fas silencer region (as described above): 5′-GAACCTGAATTTGGATGCAGTTCCAGAC-3′; and antisense YB1 oligonucleotides were used as a combination of five: 5′-GGGCCGGCGTTGTTGGGCCTGG-3′, 5′-CTGCACAGGAGGGTTGGAATAC-3′, 5′-GGAATCGTGGTCTATATCCCCG-3′, 5′-TCTGCGTCGGTAATTGAAGTTG-3′, 5′-AAGCCGGCATTTACTCAGCCCC-3′; negative control oligonucleotide-5′-GCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGG-3′. The antisense YB1 oligonucleotides were designed to cover the region encoding the C-terminal portion of YB1, termed the multimerization domain (21Wolffe A.P. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Phosphorothioated oligonucleotides corresponding to the p53 binding site of the human GADD45 promoter (22Hollander M.C.

Negative control double-stranded phosphorothioated oligonucleotides were synthesized (5′-GCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTGTG TGAAATTGTTATCCGC-3′) and annealed as described above. Plasmids—Rat YB1 was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 as described previously (13Lasham A. Lindridge E. Rudert F. Onrust R. Watson J. Gene. 2000; 252: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The promoterless reporter construct (pCAT3M) contains the CAT gene but no upstream eukaryotic promoter sequences (20Bienz-Tadmor B. Zakut-Houri R. Libresco S. Givol D. Oren M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3209-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The 446-bp mouse p53 reporter construct contains –320 to +116 of the promoter cloned into pCAT3M as described previously (20Bienz-Tadmor B. Zakut-Houri R. Libresco S. Givol D. Oren M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3209-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The adenovirus-5 E3 promoter-CAT reporter construct (pKCAT23) was as described previously (23Weeks D.L. Jones N.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1983; 3: 1222-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The Y-box deletion construct was prepared by deleting the region –143 to –121 from the mouse p53 promoter using inverse PCR as described previously (24Hale T.K. Braithwaite A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The –93 to –51 deletion mouse p53 reporter construct has been described (24Hale T.K. Braithwaite A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The p21 reporter constructs contain the promoter of the p21WAF1 / CIP1 gene linked to the luciferase reporter and a variant promoter (p21Δ53) without the p53 binding site.

Reporter Gene Assays—Two × 105 cells were transfected with 1 μg of reporter plasmid and 1, 2, or 3 μg of rat YB1 expression construct (13Lasham A. Lindridge E. Rudert F. Onrust R. Watson J. Gene. 2000; 252: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Control transfections were performed using the equivalent amount of either pUC19 or pCDNA3 empty vector (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection. Samples to be assayed for CAT activity were lysed in 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, by repeated freeze-thaw cycles, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. Supernatants were normalized for protein content using a BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce), and CAT and luciferase activities were determined. CAT activity was measured according to a previously described method (27Sleigh M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), and luciferase activity was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) and then standardized to cell number. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extract preparation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (13Lasham A. Lindridge E. Rudert F. Onrust R. Watson J. Gene. 2000; 252: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide Transfections—Cells were washed twice with serum-free medium prior to transfection with 160 pmol/ml each oligonucleotide and 6.7 μl/ml Lipofectin (Invitrogen) except for HepG2, which was transfected with 10 μl/ml Lipofectin. The cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C, washed once with the appropriate medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and recovered in fresh medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum until harvested. The control oligonucleotide was used at an equimolar concentration. All transfections were performed in replicates of two or more, and all experiments were performed at least twice. Apoptosis Analysis—After harvesting, cell pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.2% (w/v) trypan blue. Viable cells were determined by trypan blue staining and counted in quadruplicate on a hemocytometer. Cells undergoing apoptosis were analyzed by in situ TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling). Assays were performed using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's instructions, except that cell permeabilization was performed using a microwave as described previously (28Negoescu A. Lorimier P. Labat-Moleur F. Azoti L. Robert C. Guillermet C. Brambilla C. Brambilla E. Biochemica. 1997; 2: 12-17Google Scholar). Cells were visualized by fluorescent microscopy and Nomarsky optics. DNA fragmentation of the transfected cells was analyzed by a previously described procedure (29Barry M.A. Eastman A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested, counted in quadruplicate, and resuspended in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 158 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, protease inhibitors 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) at 2 μg/μl. Lysates of the treated cells were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels prior to electrophoretic transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blotting was performed using antibodies to YB1 (αFRGY2), p53 (clone DO-1, Santa Cruz), Bax (Upstate Biotechnology), ERK1 (Santa Cruz), and α-actin (Santa Cruz). Quantitation was done by densitometry. YB1 Can Repress p53 Transcription—Analysis of a 446-bp region of the mouse p53 promoter (20Bienz-Tadmor B. Zakut-Houri R. Libresco S. Givol D. Oren M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3209-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) identified several potential Y-box sequences (30Didier D.K. Schiffenbauer J. Woulfe S.L. Zacheis M. Schwartz B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7322-7326Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), one of which is between nucleotides –138 and –127 bp relative to the start site of transcription (Fig. 1A). The mouse and human p53 promoters are conserved within this region, although their transcriptional start sites differ. The putative YB1 site shows an 8 of 11 bp identity between the two promoter species (20Bienz-Tadmor B. Zakut-Houri R. Libresco S. Givol D. Oren M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3209-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As YB1 is a single-stranded DNA-binding protein (31MacDonald G.H. Itoh-Lindstrom Y. Ting J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3527-3533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), single-stranded oligonucleotides spanning this region were tested in electrophoretic mobility shift assays with purified YB1 protein. These assays showed that YB1 binds this Y-box-like region of the p53 promoter although preferentially to the pyrimidine-rich upper strand (Fig. 1B). As two shifted complexes were observed, competition with a known YB1 binding site, the YB1 cis-element of the human fas promoter (13Lasham A. Lindridge E. Rudert F. Onrust R. Watson J. Gene. 2000; 252: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), was used to confirm the specificity of the interaction. The slower migrating complex was effectively competed out with increasing amounts of single-stranded competitor DNA (Fig. 1B). To further confirm specificity, oligonucleotides designed to other regions of the p53 promoter showed no YB1 binding (data not shown). These results demonstrate that YB1 specifically binds to certain sequences within the mouse p53 promoter in vitro. Specific regulation of p53 transcription by YB1 in vitro was demonstrated using reporter gene assays. The human melanoma cell line SK Mel 5, was co-transfected with a 446-bp fragment of the p53 promoter linked to a CAT reporter (20Bienz-Tadmor B. Zakut-Houri R. Libresco S. Givol D. Oren M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3209-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and a YB1 expression construct (13Lasham A. Lindridge E. Rudert F. Onrust R. Watson J. Gene. 2000; 252: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). YB1 was found to completely repress transcription from the p53 promoter (equivalent to the level of the promoterless control), whereas transcription from the adenovirus-5 E3 promoter (23Weeks D.L. Jones N.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1983; 3: 1222-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was not repressed by YB1 (Fig. 1C). In addition, the cytomegalovirus and proliferating cell nuclear antigen promoters also were not repressed by co-transfected YB1 (data not shown). This observation was extended to a further three cell lines of mouse and human origin, where between 75 and 95% of the p53 promoter activity was abolished following co-transfection with YB1 (Fig 1D). Similar results were obtained when a human p53 reporter construct (32Reisman D. Greenberg M. Rotter V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5146-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) was used in these same cells (data not shown). These data show that YB1 is capable of repressing transcription of both mouse and human p53 promoters in what appears to be a sequence-specific manner. To further explore the sequence specificity of this repression, YB1 was transfected into SK Mel 5 cells along with two deletion constructs of the mouse p53 promoter, one of which is deleted for the putative Y-box binding site (–143 to –121 bp relative to the transcriptional start site; see Fig 1A) and another deleted between –93 and –51 bp relative to the start site. Results (Fig 1E) show that YB1 was able to repress neither the Y-box deleted promoter nor a smaller deletion (–138 to –121 bp) within this region but was still able to repress transcription from the –93 to –51-bp construct. This latter result excludes structural effects as being responsible for loss of YB1 repression. We conclude that YB1 is capable of repressing transcription of the p53 promoter in vitro. YB1 Reduces p53 Expression and Activity in Transfected Cells—To determine whether YB1 also reduces expression of endogenous p53, A549 and SK Mel 5 cells, both expressing wild type p53 protein, were transfected with a YB1 expression construct, and p53 levels were measured. In the first part of this investigation, Western blotting was carried out. Results for A549 cells (Fig 2A) show that actin protein levels were essentially invariant after transfection of YB1, whereas by 18 h p53 levels were reduced to 75% (1 μg of YB1 plasmid) and 65% (2 μg of YB1 plasmid) of control and were further reduced to about 50% of control by 48 h after transfection. This was also evident at the same times after transfection of SK Mel 5 cells (Fig 2A) in which, for example, p53 levels were reduced to 50% of control by 18 h after transfection with 2 μg of YB1 plasmid and actin levels were unchanged. A Northern blot was also done, and consistent with the protein experiments, YB1 reduced p53 mRNA levels (data not shown). Finally, the effect of transfection of YB1 on p53 function was measured. A549 cells were transfected with YB1 along with a luciferase reporter construct linked to the p21WAF1 / CIP1 promoter, known to be transactivated by wt p53. In parallel, a similar experiment was carried out using a mutant p21WAF1 / CIP1 reporter construct without the p53 response element (p21Δ53). Results (Fig 2B) show that YB1 markedly reduces activity of the p21WAF1 / CIP1 promoter but has no effect on the activity of the p21Δ53 reporter. In other experiments, YB1 does not inhibit p21WAF1 / CIP1 promoter activity in Skov3 and Saos2 cells, both of which are p53-deficient (data not shown). These data show that the inhibition of p21WAF1 / CIP1 promoter activity by exogenous YB1 parallels the decline in p53 expression and is not a direct effect of YB1. The experiments shown in both Figs. 1 and 2 are consistent with the interpretation that YB1 down-regulates p53 expression, which in turn leads to reduced p53 activity. Reducing YB1 Up-regulates p53—Because over-expression of YB1 leads to reduced p53 activity, the converse experiment, in which YB1 levels are reduced, may lead to up-regulation of p53. To test this possibility we used a YB1 cis-element from the human fas promoter (13Lasham A. Lindridge E. Rudert F. Onrust R. Watson J. Gene. 2000; 252: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which should effectively function as a YB1 decoy to sequester YB1 from endogenous promoters. This approach has been used successfully for several transcription factors (33Morishita R. Sugimoto T. Aoki M. Kida I. Tomita N. Moriguchi A. Maeda K. Sawa Y. Kaneda Y. Higaki J. Ogihara T. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 894-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 34Park Y.G. Nesterova M. Agrawal S. Cho-Chung Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1573-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). An equimolar concentration of a random sequence oligonucleotide was also transfected as a negative control. First, the endogenous levels of p53 and the pro-apoptotic p53-regulated gene Bax (7Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) were determined by Western blotting. The results for transfected SK Mel 5 cells (Fig 3A) show that the levels of p53 increased 3–4-fold in cells receiving the decoy oligonucleotide, peaking at 4 h post-transfection. The levels of Bax also increased about 3-fold, peaking at 4–6 h post-transfection, whereas the levels of ERK1 remained unchanged. In contrast, there was essentially no change in the levels of p53, Bax, or ERK1 after transfection with control oligonucleotides (Fig. 3A). We next asked whether the YB1 decoy would increase a p53 response as measured by the p21WAF1 / CIP1 reporter constructs used in Fig 2A. A549 cells were transfected with the p21WAF1 / CIP1 reporter constructs along with decoy or control oligonucleotides or with a human p53 expression construct. The results (Fig 3B) show that both human p53 and YB1 decoy increased the activity of the p21WAF1 / CIP1 reporter, but this did not happen with control oligonucleotides. Furthermore, only the reporter with the p53 response element was up-regulated, showing that the effect of the oligonucleotides was p53-specific. To confirm that the decoy oligonucleotide was specifically able to target YB1, SK Mel 5 cells were transfected with biotinylated decoy or control oligonucleotides. At 18 h post-transfection, oligonucleotides were removed by incubating lysates from transfected cells with streptavidin beads. The level of YB1 remaining in the supernatant of cells that had received the decoy oligonucleotide was 60% less than that found in control lysates (Fig 3C), but ERK1 levels were the same. This experiment therefore confirms the specificity of the decoy oligonucleotide. Reduction of YB1 Induces Cells to Undergo Apoptosis—The results described above show that reducing YB1 causes an up-regulation of p53. We therefore asked whether reducing YB1 can cause cells to undergo apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. At 18 h post-transfection of SK Mel 5 cells with either antisense YB1 or YB1 decoy oligonucleotides, about 30% of cells were in the late stages of apoptosis as assessed by in situ TUNEL assay (Fig 4A) and DNA laddering (Fig 4B). However, much less apoptosis was observed with the control oligonucleotide. To confirm that the antisense YB1 oligonucleotides did in fact reduce the level of YB1 protein, SK Mel 5 cell lysates were prepared from antisense and negative control oligonucleotide transfectants. Western blotting with a YB1 antibody showed that in cells transfected with the YB1 antisense oligonucleotide, 75% less YB1 protein was detected than from cells transfected with control oligonucleotide (Fig. 4C), whereas ERK1 levels were unchanged. This confirmed that the antisense YB1 oligonucleotides were able to target YB1 specifically. To determine whether wt p53 is required for the apoptosis observed when YB1 is reduced by the antisense or decoy oligonucleotides, RKO and RKO p53.13 cells were used. RKO are colorectal cells expressing wt p53, and RKO p53.13 are a variant cell line containing a dominant-negative mouse p53 mutant (25Slichenmyer W.J. Nelson W.G. Slebos R.J. Kastan M.B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4164-4168PubMed Google Scholar). Thus RKO p53.13 are functionally p53 null. Both cell lines were transfected with the YB1 decoy or negative control oligonucleotides. Results (Fig 4D) show that at 18 h post-transfection there was a 53% decline in the viability of RKO cells when transfected with the YB1 decoy compared with the control oligonucleotide, however, there was no reduction in viability of RKO p53.13 cells. These results provide evidence that the induction of apoptosis caused by reduction of YB1 is via a p53-mediated pathway. This experiment was repeated in a panel of human and mouse tumor cell lines that differed in their p53 status. Apoptosis/cell death was measured by TUNEL assay and/or by trypan blue exclusion. Some of the TUNEL staining results are shown in Fig 4E, and a summary of these and other results is shown in Table I. Collectively these experiments show that at 18 h post-transfection, >30% apoptosis occurred after the addition of decoy oligonucleotide to cells expressing wt p53, but no apoptosis was observed in cells with a mutant p53 (e.g. HaCAT, Fig 4E, Table I) or in cells expressing no p53 (e.g. HL60, Table I). Additionally, we were also able to prevent YB1 decoy-induced apoptosis by co-transfecting a p53 decoy (a double-stranded p53 oligonucleotide) from the human GADD45 promoter (see “Experimental Procedures” for the sequence) but not with the control oligonucleotide (data not shown).Table IResults of TUNEL assayCell lineSourcep53 statusInduction of apoptosisSK Mel 5Melanomawt+HepG2Hepatomawt+A549Adenocarcinomawt+NZM9Melanomawt+RKOColon carcinomawt+B10.2Fibrosarcomawt+B10.5Fibrosarcomawt+JurkatT-cell leukemiaMutant-U937Histiocytic lymphomaNull-HL60Promyelocytic leukemiaNull-RKO p53.13Colon carcinomaDominant negative-HaCaTTransformed keratinocyteMutant-SaOS2OsteosarcomaNull-IIICF/cLiFraumeni skin fibroblastsNull- Open table in a new tab The effect of transfection of antisense and decoy oligonucleotides was also examined at later times. We generally found that more extensive cell death occurred by 42 h post-transfection (about 50%), but was no greater beyond this time (data not shown). This may be because of oligonucleotide instability, but the reasons for this are not clear. This qualification notwithstanding, the above experiments show that apoptosis/cell death is induced by inhibiting YB1 and that this appears to require wt p53. There is growing evidence that the Y-box-binding protein, YB1, may be important in tumor biology. YB1 is activated in response to genotoxic stress (35Ohga T. Koike K. Ono M. Makino Y. Itagaki Y.

https://openalex.org/W2012385890,"The site of the 'first hit' in the APC tumour suppressor gene determines the type of the 'second hit', both in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and sporadic colorectal tumours. Mutations near codon 1300 are associated with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the wild-type allele; other tumours tend to have two protein-truncating mutations. In this study, we have confirmed and refined the LOH-associated region in colorectal FAP: allelic loss in adenomatous polyps tended to occur when the germline mutation lay in the region of the APC gene between the first and second beta-catenin degradation repeats (codons 1285-1378). LOH generally occurred by mitotic recombination, leaving two identical alleles, each encoding a protein with one remaining beta-catenin degradation repeat. For patients with germline mutations that truncated the protein before the first repeat (codon 1264), LOH was very rare and tumours generally acquired a somatic mutation which left two, or less often one, repeats remaining in the protein. In our sample set, patients with germline mutations after the second beta-catenin degradation repeat tended to have undetectable, presumably cryptic, somatic mutations in their polyps. Exceptions to these rules were, however, not uncommon. Although the site of the germline mutation was the strongest determinant of the somatic mutation in FAP tumours and most patients showed no clear tendency to acquire specific types of truncating 'second hit', a minority of patients did have unusual somatic mutation spectra in their polyps. Thus, some individuals may be predisposed to particular types of 'second hit' (for example, frameshift rather than nonsense changes). Overall, disease severity (polyp number) did not vary with individuals' spectrum of somatic APC mutations, providing no clear evidence for modifier genes that influence disease severity in this fashion. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that there exists an optimal level of beta-catenin signalling in colorectal tumours and that the APC mutation spectrum principally reflects this fact. The association between 'first hits' and 'second hits' at APC is not, however, so strong as to suggest that tumorigenesis only occurs if the genotype is optimum; we suggest 'relaxed' terminology, the 'loose fit' model, to describe this situation."
https://openalex.org/W1981088394,"Several mutations in the human ether-a-go-go-related K+ channel gene (HERG or KCNH2) cause long QT syndrome (LQT2) by reducing the intracellular transport (trafficking) of the channel protein to the cell surface. Drugs that bind to and block HERG channels (i.e. E4031) rescue the surface expression of some trafficking defective LQT2 mutations. Because these drugs potently block HERG current, their ability to correct congenital LQT is confounded by their risk of causing acquired LQT. We tested the hypothesis that pharmacological rescue can occur without HERG channel block. Thapsigargin (1 μm), a sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, rescued the surface expression of G601S, and it did so without blocking current. Thapsigargin-induced rescue and E4031-induced rescue caused complex glycosylation that was evident within 3 h of drug exposure. Disruption of the Golgi apparatus with brefeldin A prevented thapsigargin- and E4031-induced rescue of IG01S. Confocal imaging showed that G601S protein is predominantly “trapped” intracellularly and that both thapsigargin and E4031 promote its relocation to the surface membrane. We also studied two other trafficking defective LQT2 mutations. Thapsigargin rescued the C terminus mutation F805C but not N470D, whereas E4031 rescued N470D but not F805C. Other sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitors did not rescue G601S or F805C. This study 1) supports the hypothesis that the LQT2 trafficking defective phenotype can be reversed without blocking the channel; 2) demonstrates pharmacological rescue of a C terminus LQT2 mutation; and 3) shows that thapsigargin can correct trafficking defective phenotypes in more than one channel type and disease (i.e. LQT2 and cystic fibrosis).

The rescue of trafficking defective LQT2 channels can increase functional I HERG, and therefore has therapeutic potential. Amino acid residues on the inner portion of the 6th transmembrane segment (S6) of HERG channel protein constitute a binding domain for drugs that cause high affinity I HERG block, and this binding domain is also thought to mediate pharmacological rescue of trafficking defective LQT2 mutations by high affinity HERG blockers (5Ficker E.

Therefore, using drugs that cause high affinity HERG channel block as a means of restoring protein trafficking negates their therapeutic potential. We tested the hypothesis that we could pharmacologically rescue trafficking defective LQT2 channels without using drugs that block I HERG. Our approach has similarity to cystic fibrosis, where the predominant mutation, ΔF508 (deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 in the CFTR transporter), prevents the trafficking of the CFTR channel protein to the surface membrane (for review, see Ref. 10Kopito R.R.

We speculated that if similar molecular chaperone proteins regulated LQT2 trafficking defective mutations, then these drugs might cause the pharmacological rescue in some LQT2 mutations without blocking I HERG. We first studied the mechanism of pharmacological rescue using the G601S LQT2 mutation, and then compared these findings with two additional LQT2 mutations, N470D and F805C.

Tunicamycin (Sigma), thapsigargin (Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel), 2,5-(di-tert)-butyl-1,4-hydroquinone (DBHQ) (Sigma), cyclopiazonic acid (Alomone), and 4-PBA (Sigma) were added to the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium after being dissolved in Me2SO. The final Me2SO concentration in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was <0.1%. Incubating HEK293 cells expressing the N470D, G601S, or F805C mutations overnight in 0.1% Me2SO had no effect on I HERG or complex glycosylation. E4031 (Eisai Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was added to the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium after being dissolved in distilled H2O to make a 10 mm stock solution. Electrophysiology—Functional analysis was done using the standard whole cell patch clamp technique as previously described (21Delisle B.P. Satin J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1895-1905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Ionic currents were measured using an external solution that contained (in mm) 137 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and an internal pipette solution that contained (in mm) 130 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 5 MgATP, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH). An Axopatch-200 patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) was used to record membrane currents and measure capacitance. The uncompensated pipette resistance was 1–1.5 MΩ and series resistance was compensated between 75 and 85%. After obtaining intracellular access, only cells with seal resistances >1 GΩ were used. Computer software (pCLAMP 8.0; Axon Instruments) was used to generate voltage-clamp protocols, acquire current signals, and analyze data. Data were filtered at 10 kHz and were capacitance corrected. Origin (6.0, Microcal, Northampton, MA) was used for curve fitting and generating graphs. The holding potential in all experiments was –80 mV, and the 0 current baseline is indicated as a dotted line in all figures. In Fig. 1, A and B, the peak tail current was measured at –120 mV for 3 s following depolarizing steps (V Step) to voltages from –70 to 60 mV in 10-mV increments for 5 s. The voltage protocol was applied every 20 s. Data are given as current density (peak tail current normalized in each cell to its cell capacitance). Data were fit by the Boltzmann function (22Hille B.

All voltage-clamp experiments were performed at 22–23 °C within 1–2 h of removing the cells from their culture conditions. Western Blot—HEK293 cells from similarly confluent cultures were used to isolate cell proteins. The Western blot procedure was similar to that previously described (1Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 2Furutani M. Trudeau M.C. Hagiwara N. Seki A. Gong Q. Zhou Z. Imamura S.

Whole cell lysates were obtained by treating cells with Nonidet P-40 buffer and determining protein concentration using a micro-BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with HERG antibody directed against the C terminus (1Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The antibody was detected with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Imaging—HEK293 cells expressing the G601S mutation were plated in 35-mm Petri dishes containing collagen-coated coverslips. Cells were fixed with 4% buffered paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.1%) for 10 min, and rinsed in 0.75% glycine buffer for 10 min to quench background fluorescence. The cells were incubated with 2 ml of blocking solution (10% goat serum, 0.05% NaN3 in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h to block nonspecific binding sites, and the cells were subsequently incubated with the HERG antibody (1:3000) in blocking solution at room temperature. Excess antibody was washed off with three 10-min long rinses of blocking solution. The cells were then incubated with highly cross-absorbed Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody (1:500; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in the blocking solution, and then were washed with four 10-min long treatments with blocking solution alone. After the final wash, the coverslips containing the stained cells were mounted on to a slide using 50% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline. To determine nonspecific binding, control experiments with secondary antibody alone were also done. Imaging was performed with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a mixed gas (Ar/Kr) laser operated by 24-bit Lasersharp software (Bio-Rad). Image acquisition utilized excitation at 568 nm with emission detected at 605 ± 16 nm. Cells were randomly selected and used for imaging and analysis. Z-scan sections were taken at 0.5 μm. The number of Z-scans required to image the full thickness of a cell ranged between 15 and 25 sections. Data are shown as single z-scan images and as superimposed (stacked) z-scan images. Statistics—Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Student's t test is used for statistical analysis with p < 0.05 considered significant. Incubating HEK293 Cells in Thapsigargin Increases IG601S— Thapsigargin alters cytoplasmic and ER [Ca2+] by inhibiting the sarcoplasmic/ER Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA, Ref. 24Treiman M. Caspersen C. Christensen S.B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 131-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Egan and colleagues (12Egan M.E. Glockner-Pagel J. Ambrose C. Cahill P.A. Pappoe L. Balamuth N. Cho E. Canny S. Wagner C.A. Geibel J. Caplan M.J. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) speculated that thapsigargin rescued ΔF508 CFTR by altering the activity of Ca2+-dependent chaperone proteins in the ER. We tested if thapsigargin could also rescue the trafficking defective LQT2 mutation G601S. We incubated HEK293 cells expressing G601S in 1 μm thapsigargin for 8–10 h and we compared the G601S current (IG601S) to control (no drug treatment) current. Fig. 1A shows representative whole cell currents with the voltage protocol shown in the inset. In control conditions there is only a low amplitude tail I G601S (left panels). After 8–10 h of incubation in 1 μm thapsigargin, I G601S during the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing (–120 mV) steps was increased (right panels). The tail I G601S is shown in the lower panels on an expanded time base. Fig. 1B shows the absolute mean peak tail I G601S densities recorded at –120 mV plotted as a function of V Step (n = 5 cells in each group). The data were fit with a Boltzmann function (solid line) to calculate the maximal tail I G601S density. Thapsigargin exposure significantly increased the maximal tail I G601S density from –11.6 ± 1.5 pA/pF in control cells to –38.2 ± 5.2 pA/pF in thapsigargin-exposed cells (p < 0.05). HERG channels undergo core and complex glycosylation during normal biogenesis. The core-glycosylated (immature) form of the channel protein has a M r of ∼135,000, and the complexly glycosylated (mature) form of the channel protein has a M r of ∼155,000 (1Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 25Gong Q. Anderson C.L. January C.T. Zhou Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H77-H84Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C (left panel) shows a representative Western blot (n = 3) of WT HERG channel protein from control cells (left lane) and cells incubated with 5 μg/ml tunicamycin for 48 h (right lane). Tunicamycin, which disrupts N-linked glycosylation, eliminated the 155-kDa protein band. Fig. 1C (right panel) shows a representative Western blot (n = 4) of G601S channel protein from cells incubated in 5 μm E4031 for 10 h (left lane), control cells (middle lane), and cells incubated in 1 μm thapsigargin for 10 h (right lane). E4031 and thapsigargin caused the appearance of the 155-kDa protein band, although the effect of thapsigargin was less robust. The appearance of the 155-kDa band is commonly used as an indicator of channel rescue (3Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31123-31126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 5Ficker E. Obejero-Paz C.A. Zhao S. Brown A.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 48610-48616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the time course of I G601S rescue with thapsigargin after 2–3 and 8–10 h of exposure. Cells expressing G601S were depolarized for3sto20mVto fully activate I G601S and tail currents were recorded at –120 mV. Representative tail I G601S from control cells and from cells exposed to 1 μm thapsigargin show a progressive, time-dependent increase in the tail I G601S amplitude. Fig. 2B shows the absolute mean peak tail I G601S density from control cells and cells incubated in thapsigargin. After incubating 2–3 h, thapsigargin increased I G601S density (n = 5 cells in each group, p < 0.05), which was further increased after 8–10 h. I G601S did not increase further after 8–10 h of exposure. Fig. 2C shows that incubating in 1 μm thapsigargin or 5 μm E4031 for 3 h, compared with control conditions, was sufficient to cause the appearance of the 155-kDa protein band on Western blots. Thapsigargin Does Not Block IG601S—We wanted to determine whether thapsigargin rescue of G601S protein involved drug block of the channel. We first pharmacologically rescued I G601S by incubating G601S expressing cells overnight with 5 μm E4031. Following this, cell culture media was replaced with E4031-free media for 1–2 h before cells were harvested for patch clamp recording (3Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31123-31126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). From the holding potential of –80 mV, I G601S was recorded by depolarizing cells to 0 mV for 3 s, then repolarizing to –50 mV for 5 s to record tail current. The voltage protocol was repeated every 20 s, and I G601S was recorded before and during the application of 1 μm thapsigargin or 5 μm E4031. Fig. 3A shows representative current traces of pharmacologically rescued I G601S before and during the application of 1 μm thapsigargin (upper panel) or 5 μm E4031 (lower panel). Thapsigargin, unlike E4031, did not cause block of I G601S. Fig. 3B shows averaged normalized peak tail I G601S amplitude data recorded at –50 mV from G601S expressing cells, and the effect of thapsigargin or E4031. Thapsigargin did not affect the peak tail I G601S (circles). In contrast, 5 μm E4031 rapidly blocked I G601S (triangles). We conclude that thapsigargin-induced pharmacological rescue of G601S does not involve drug block of IHERG. Pharmacological Rescue of G601S Protein Requires the Golgi Apparatus—Thapsigargin and E4031 rescue I G601S and cause complex glycosylation of the protein. This suggests that pharmacological rescue by both drugs results in G601S trafficking through the Golgi apparatus where complex sugars are modified and added to the protein. Intracellular protein trafficking is a complex process that requires vesicular budding via the assembly of coat proteins. Coat protein I and the GTPase ADP ribosylating factor regulate the vesicular trafficking between the ER and Golgi apparatus. Brefeldin A (BFA) is a fungal metabolite that potently inhibits ADP ribosylating factor-mediated vesicular transport and disrupts the Golgi apparatus (26Donaldson J.G. Kahn R.A. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. Science. 1991; 254: 1197-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 27Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). We tested the hypothesis that disruption of the Golgi apparatus with BFA would prevent pharmacological rescue of G601S. For this experiment, G601S expressing cells were incubated with 1 μm thapsigargin or 5 μm E4031 for 2–3 h to induce pharmacological rescue of the channel. As shown in Fig. 2, this incubation period is sufficient to rescue G601S channels. Thirty minutes after adding thapsigargin or E4031, 5 μg/ml BFA was added to some of the cell culture dishes. Fig. 4A shows representative tail I G601S recorded at –120 mV from cells cultured with and without BFA, and Fig. 4B shows the absolute mean peak tail I G601S density (n = 4 cell in each group). BFA reduced I G601S rescue in cells exposed to thapsigargin or E4031 (p < 0.05 in each group). For comparison, we incubated cells expressing WT HERG channels with 5 μg/ml BFA. BFA exposure for 3 h did not affect I HERG; control peak tail I HERG was 157 ± 20 pA/pF (n = 6 cells) and after BFA exposure for 2–3 h peak tail I HERG was 168 ± 21 pA/pF (n = 8 cells). Because co-incubating BFA inhibited the increase of I G601S by either thapsigargin or E4031 exposure, the data suggest that pharmacological rescue is dependent on an intact Golgi apparatus. Pharmacological Rescue Redistributes Intracellular G601S Protein to the Cell Surface—The results suggest that incubation in thapsigargin or E4031 mobilizes G601S protein that is present in an intracellular compartment(s). To test this, we used confocal microscopy to image G601S protein in control cells, and in cells incubated for 10 h with 1 μm thapsigargin or 5 μm E4031 to induce pharmacological rescue. Fig. 5 shows representative (n = 7–8 cells in each group) phase-contrast and their corresponding z-scan images from control (no E4031 or thapsigargin) cells and pharmacologically rescued cells. The phase-contrast images show the cell and its surface membrane, the z-scan images show G601S HERG protein staining. The single and stacked z-scan images show that G601S HERG protein staining is predominantly perinuclear in control cells with only faint staining into the cell processes and cell surface membrane. In contrast, cells incubated with thapsigargin or E4031 exhibit greater staining throughout the cell processes and on the cell surface. Thapsigargin and E4031 Selectively Rescue Different LQT2 Mutations—Three methods to increase functional I G601S are reduced culture temperature (<30 °C, Ref. 2Furutani M. Trudeau M.C. Hagiwara N. Seki A. Gong Q. Zhou Z. Imamura S. Nagashima H. Kasanuki H. Takao A. Momma K. January C.T. Robertson G.A. Matsuoka R. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2290-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and incubating cells in high affinity HERG blockers or thapsigargin. We compared findings obtained with the G601S mutation with two other trafficking defective LQT2 mutations. Fig. 6A shows representative tail currents recorded at –120 mV from cells stably expressing the G601S, F805C, or N470D mutations under control conditions; after incubating at 27 °C for 24 h; and after incubating in thapsigargin (1 μm) or E4031 (5 μm) for 24 h. Fig. 6B shows that the absolute mean peak tail current density increased in all three LQT2 mutations after cell incubation at 27 °C (see also Refs. 3Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31123-31126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar and 5Ficker E. Obejero-Paz C.A. Zhao S. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 7: 4989-4998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In contrast, E4031 selectively increased peak tail I G601S and I N470D densities, but not I F805C density. Incubating cells in thapsigargin for 24 h selectively increased peak tail I G601S and I F805C densities, but not I N470D density (n = 5–8 cells in each group). Fig. 6C shows corresponding Western blots from cells stably expressing each mutation for control conditions; after incubating cells at 27 °C for 24 h; and after cells were exposed to either thapsigargin or E4031 at 37 °C for 24 h. Complex glycosylation (the presence of the 155-kDa protein band) was minimal or absent for control conditions, but was apparent for all three mutations incubated at 27 °C. Complex glycosylation was apparent only in N470D and G601S after incubation in E4031, and only in G601S and F805C after incubation in thapsigargin. These data demonstrate that the presence of the 155-kDa band correlates with increased I HERG shown in panels A and B. These data also show mutation-specific, selective pharmacological rescue, and demonstrate pharmacological rescue of a C terminus trafficking defective LQT2 mutation. Other SERCA Inhibitors Do Not Rescue G601S or F805C—We tested whether a different SERCA inhibitor could also rescue G601S or F805C by using DBHQ (10 μm). We measured peak tail current using the same voltage-clamp protocol in Fig. 2. In control cells (n = 5) and for cells incubated with 10 μm DBHQ (n = 4) for 8–10 h the mean peak tail I G601S density remained unchanged, 8 ± 2 pA/pF. DBHQ exposure for 8–10 h also failed to increase trafficking of F805C. The mean peak tail I F805C density in control cells was 30 ± 6 (n = 7) and 27 ± 3 pA/pF (n = 3) after exposure to DBHQ. Similarly, incubating G601S expressing cells in DBHQ (10 μm) or cyclopiazonic acid (1 or 10 μm), another inhibitor of the SERCA, for 10 h failed to cause complex glycosylation of G601S protein (data not shown, n = 5 and 2, respectively). Thapsigargin rescues trafficking of ΔF508 CFTR (12Egan M.E. Glockner-Pagel J. Ambrose C. Cahill P.A. Pappoe L. Balamuth N. Cho E. Canny S. Wagner C.A. Geibel J. Caplan M.J. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and to our knowledge our report is the first to show that a low concentration of a single drug can rescue the trafficking of mutant channel proteins found in different diseases. 4-PBA also rescues ΔF508 CFTR after 48 h of exposure (14Rubenstein R.C. Egan M.E. Zeitlin P.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2457-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), therefore we tested if 4-PBA could increase G601S trafficking. 4-PBA (1 or 10 mm) incubation for 48 h did not cause the appearance of the 155-kDa protein band using Western blot analysis (data not shown; n = 2). We conclude that unlike thapsigargin, 4-PBA does not rescue trafficking of the G601S mutation, and this is in agreement with the previous report that 4-PBA did not rescue I N470D (9Rajamani S. Anderson C.L. Anson B.D. January C.T. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2830-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We show that thapsigargin causes pharmacological rescue of the LQT2 mutations G601S and F805C. This is the first study to show that thapsigargin can correct trafficking defective phenotypes in more than one channel type and disease (e.g. HERG and CFTR in LQT2 and cystic fibrosis). This is also the first study to show pharmacological rescue of F805C, a mutation that is not rescued by high affinity HERG channel blockers (5Ficker E. Obejero-Paz C.A. Zhao S. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 7: 4989-4998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Unlike drugs that cause high affinity block of I HERG and pharmacological rescue of some LQT2 mutations, thapsigargin does not block I HERG. Recently, fexofenadine (terfenadine carboxylate, see Ref. 9Rajamani S. Anderson C.L. Anson B.D. January C.T. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2830-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) was shown to rescue I G601S and I N470D at drug concentrations below that required for block of I HERG. Incubating cells stably expressing F805C in 5 μm fexofenadine for 24 h did not increase I F805C density (data not shown). We conclude that thapsigargin-induced pharmacological rescue is a mechanistically novel approach to increase the surface expression of some LQT2 trafficking defective channels. The Mechanism of Thapsigargin-induced Rescue of G601S Is Different Than ΔF508 CFTR—The mechanism proposed for thapsigargin-induced pharmacological rescue of the ΔF508 CFTR mutation was SERCA inhibition, and finding that other SERCA inhibitors such as DBHQ and cyclopiazonic acid also rescued the trafficking of ΔF508 CFTR supported this (12Egan M.E. Glockner-Pagel J. Ambrose C. Cahill P.A. Pappoe L. Balamuth N. Cho E. Canny S. Wagner C.A. Geibel J. Caplan M.J. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These drugs deplete ER luminal [Ca2+] and are thought to alter Ca2+-dependent molecular chaperone activity (for review, see Ref. 28Corbett E.F. Michalak M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 307-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In the present work, we speculated that if similar molecular chaperone proteins regulated LQT2 trafficking defective mutations, then these drugs might also cause the pharmacological rescue in some LQT2 mutations. Our findings suggest that the mechanism for thapsigargin-induced rescue in LQT2 is different from that for ΔF508 in CFTR. The principal difference is that other SERCA inhibitors failed to rescue the G601S or F805C mutation. Thus one possibility is that SERCA inhibition similar to that found with the ΔF508 CFTR mutation is not responsible for the rescue of G601S. Clearly, additional studies are needed to confirm this. Our findings do show that thapsigargin-induced rescue of G601S was evident within 2–3 h of drug exposure. This short time course suggests that thapsigargin acts post-translationally to promote the relocation of intracellular protein to the membrane surface and that changes in gene expression are not essential. Pharmacological Rescue Requires the Golgi Apparatus for Surface Expression of G601S—Complex glycosylation, or the generation of the 155-kDa protein band on Western blot, is a hallmark of HERG protein maturation and pharmacological rescue (2Furutani M.

The immunocytochemical and confocal imaging results support this; pharmacological rescue redistributed G601S protein from predominantly perinuclear intracellular compartment(s) to the cytoplasm and surface membrane. Furthermore, disrupting the Golgi apparatus using BFA prevented rescue of I G601S. We conclude that the G601S mutation is trapped within an intracellular compartment, presumably the ER (1Zhou Z.

Taken together, our data suggest that thapsigarin-induced and E4031-induced pharmacological rescue of G601 channels follow a similar pathway to the surface membrane. In contrast, brief disruption of the Golgi apparatus by BFA had no effect on WT I HERG. In summary, these findings show that thapsigargin selectively rescues the G601S and F805C, but not the N470D LQT2 mutant channels. Thapsigargin-induced rescue does not involve HERG channel block, thus these experiments uncouple HERG channel block from pharmacological rescue. Although thapsigargin also rescues the ΔF508 mutation in CFTR, the mechanisms for pharmacological rescue appear to be different for these two channel types and therefore may not involve common molecular chaperone proteins or processing checkpoints. Furthermore, given the differences in the pharmacological rescue of N470D, G601S, and F805C, we suggest that trafficking of these mutations is differentially regulated and that multiple rescue mechanisms may exist. A more detailed understanding of pharmacological rescue in LQT2 trafficking defective mutations is needed. Although not directly clinically applicable, these findings provide new information about potential mechanisms that may be exploited to develop new therapies for diseases caused by proteins with trafficking defects. We thank Jennifer Kilby for technical assistance in generating the F805C mutation, and Drs. Qiuming Gong and Zhengfeng Zhou for the generation of the WT and N470D cell lines used in these experiments. We also thank Todd Clark Brelje for assistance with the confocal microscopy."

https://openalex.org/W2075759604,"Radiation-induced destruction of the hematopoietic system is the primary cause of death based on the findings that transfer of normal bone marrow cells prevents death from lethal irradiation. The stem cell factor-c-kit signaling pathway (SCF/c-kit) has been previously implicated in the hematopoietic recovery which prevents death from lethal irradiation, but the molecular mechanisms that mediate this biological effect are unknown. Since mutations on SCF, c-kit and Slug genes have a similar phenotype in mice, we examined if Slug could complement the radiosensitivity of kit-deficient mice. In this report, we show that Slug acts as a radioprotection agent as lack of Slug results in increased radiosensitivity. This effect cannot be recovered by activating SCF/c-kit in lethally irradiated Slug-deficient mice, as SCF-treated mice did not demonstrate stimulation of hematopoietic recovery leading to survival of the Slug-deficient mice. We found that we could complement the hematopoietic failure in lethally irradiated c-kit-deficient mice by transducing them with a TAT-Slug protein. We conclude that the zinc-finger transcription factor Slug is absolutely necessary for survival from lethal irradiation and identify Slug as the molecular target that mediates the radioprotection through SCF/c-kit. These results indicate that Slug may be a molecular component conferring radioresistance to cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2086981199,"Exposure of human cells to genotoxic agents induces various signaling pathways involved in the execution of stress- and DNA-damage responses. Inappropriate functioning of the DNA-damage response to ionizing radiation (IR) is associated with the human diseases ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) and Nijmegen Breakage syndrome (NBS). Here, we show that IR efficiently induces Jun/ATF transcription factor activity in normal human diploid fibroblasts, but not in fibroblasts derived from A-T and NBS patients. IR was found to enhance the expression of c-Jun and, in particular, ATF3, but, in contrast to various other stress stimuli, did not induce the expression of c-Fos. Using specific inhibitors, we found that the ATM- and Nibrin1-dependent activation of ATF3 does neither require p53 nor reactive oxygen species, but is dependent on the p38 and JNK MAPkinases. Via these kinases, IR activates ATF-2, one of the transcription factors acting on the atf3 promoter. The activation of ATF-2 by IR resembles ATF-2 activation by certain growth factors, since IR mainly induced the second step of ATF-2 phosphorylation via the stress-inducible MAPkinases, phosphorylation of Thr69. As IR does not enhance ATF-2 phosphorylation in ATM and Nibrin1-deficient cells, both ATF-2 and ATF3 seem to play an important role in the protective response of human cells to IR."
https://openalex.org/W2060957264,"Cell proliferation and differentiation are highly coordinated during normal development. Many tumor cells exhibit both uncontrolled proliferation and a block to terminal differentiation. To understand the mechanisms coordinating these two processes, we have investigated the relation between cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activities and the block to differentiation in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. We found that CDK6 (but not CDK4) is rapidly downregulated as MEL cells are induced to re-enter erythroid differentiation and that maintenance of CDK6 (but not CDK4) activity by transfection blocks differentiation. Moreover, we found that PU.1, an Ets transcription factor that is oncogenic in erythroid cells and also can block their differentiation, controls the synthesis of CDK6 mRNA. These results suggest a mechanism for coupling proliferation and the block to differentiation in these leukemic cells through the action of an oncogenic transcription factor (PU.1) on a key cell cycle regulator (CDK6). Our findings suggest that studying the relative roles of CDK6 and CDK4 in other types of malignant cells will be important in designing approaches for cell cycle inhibition and differentiation therapy in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2025430681,"α4 integrins mediate increased cell migration and decreased cell spreading because the α4 cytoplasmic domain (tail) binds tightly to paxillin, a signaling adaptor protein. Paxillin binding to the α4 tail is blocked by α4 phosphorylation at Ser988. To establish the biological role of α4 phosphorylation, we reconstituted α4-deficient Jurkat T cells with phosphorylation-mimicking (α4(S988D)) or non-phosphorylatable (α4(S988A)) mutants. α4(S988D) disrupted paxillin binding and also inhibited cell migration and promoted cell spreading. In contrast, the non-phosphorylatable α4(S988A) resulted in a further reduction in cell spreading; however, this mutation led to an unexpected suppression of cell migration. The suppression of cell migration by α4(S988A) was ascribable to enhanced α4-paxillin association, because enforced association by an α4-paxillin fusion led to a phenotype similar to that of the non-phosphorylatable α4(S988A) mutant. These data establish that optimal α4-mediated cell migration requires both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the α4 cytoplasmic domain to regulate the reversible binding of paxillin."

It consists of five kinds of subunits with a stoichiometry of α3β3γ1δ1ϵ1 in which the catalytic nucleotide-binding sites are located on the β subunits and the non-catalytic nucleotide-binding sites are on the α subunits. The γ subunit inserts its long coiled-coil helices into the central cavity of the α3β3 cylinder (3Abrahams J.P. Leslie A. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar), and ATP hydrolysis occurring in the α3β3 drives rotation of the γ subunit along with the ϵ subunit that is associated with the γ subunit (reviewed in Ref. 2Yoshida M.

More ubiquitous is the inhibition by the ϵ subunit, which was noticed since the early stage of studies of ATP synthase (7Smith J.B. Sternweis P.C. Heppel L.A. J. Supramol.

The structures of the isolated ϵ from Escherichia coli represent the down-state conformation that does not exhibit the inhibitory effect. The exact conformation of the upstate ϵ subunit in F1 and F0F1 is not known, but it is certain that the C-terminal helical hairpin in the down state is opened in the up state (19Rodgers A.J.W. Wilce M.C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1051-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and comes in contact with the α and β subunits (20Hara K.Y. Kato-Yamada Y. Kikuchi Y. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23969-23973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The up-state ϵ exerts the inhibitory effect on ATP hydrolysis activity but, interestingly, not on ATP synthesis activity of F0F1 (21Tsunoda S.P. Rodgers A.J.W. Aggeler R. Wilce M.C.J. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6560-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).Several factors are known to induce the conformational transitions of the ϵ subunit. Illumination of thylakoid membranes resulted in the change of the arrangement of the ϵ subunit in chloroplast F0F1 as probed by the accessibility of the antibody against the ϵ subunit (22Richter M.L.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2446-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Also addition of ATP to F1 stabilizes the down-state conformation of the ϵ subunit (17Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35746-35750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26645-26651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Since it has been thought that nucleotide-binding sites of F0F1 are exclusively located in α and β subunits and the mutant F1 with incompetent nucleotide-binding sites on α subunits still shows ATP-dependent conformational transition of the ϵ subunit (17Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35746-35750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we have concluded that the ATP binding to the catalytic site(s) on the β subunit(s) triggers the conformational transitions of the ϵ subunit. Here, however, we report that the isolated ϵ subunit of F1 from thermophilic Bacillus strain PS3 (TF1) has a binding site for ATP. This unexpected finding raises a new possibility that the ϵ subunit in F0F1 acts not only as a regulator of F0F1 but also as a sensor for cellular ATP level.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Expression Plasmids for ϵ Subunits—To obtain the wild-type ϵ subunit of TF1, the expression plasmid pTE2 (14Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24906-24912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and pET21c vector carrying TF1 ϵ subunit gene (20Hara K.Y. Kato-Yamada Y. Kikuchi Y. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23969-23973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) were used. The expression plasmid for the ϵ subunit of F1 from E. coli (EF1) was generated as follows. The gene for EF1-ϵ subunit was amplified by PCR with two primers, one containing NdeI site and 5′ region of EF1-ϵ gene and the other containing complementary sequence to 3′ region of EF1-ϵ gene and HindIII site, using a plasmid containing E. coli F0F1 operon as a template. The resulting DNA fragment was digested with NdeI and HindIII and introduced into the respective sites of the pET21c expression vector (Novagen). The expression plasmid for the ϵ subunit of F1 from Bacillus subtilis (BF1) was generated by the same procedures by using genomic DNA of B. subtilis as a template for PCR. The expression plasmid for a mutant, Lys-109 to Ala (K109A), ϵ subunit of F1 from Spinacia oleracea L. chloroplast (CF1) was generated by the method of Kunkel et al. (25Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) from an expression plasmid for the wild-type CF1-ϵ subunit, pMCE1 (26Hisabori T. Kato Y. Motohashi K. Kroth-Pancic P. Strotmann H. Amano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). DNA sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Wild-type and a truncated mutant (Val-90 to Stop) of TF1-ϵ (ϵΔC) were purified as described (16Kato-Yamada Y. Bald D. Koike M. Motohashi K. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33991-33994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The ϵ subunits of EF1 and BF1 were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (26Hisabori T. Kato Y. Motohashi K. Kroth-Pancic P. Strotmann H. Amano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). EF1-ϵ subunit was purified by the same method as used for the TF1-ϵ subunit. BF1-ϵ subunit was also purified by the same method except that flow-through fractions of the butyl-Toyopearl column chromatography were used because BF1-ϵ subunit did not bind to the column. The isolation of the mutant (K109A) CF1-ϵ subunit was carried out at 4 °C as follows. The cells were disrupted by sonication (S-250 Sonifier, Branson Ultrasonics, Japan), and the inclusion bodies were collected by a centrifugation at 8400 × g for 20 min. The precipitate was suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, and 4% (v/v) Triton X-100. The mixture was mildly shaken for 30 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 8400 × g for 20 min. The washing was repeated 3 times. Then the precipitate was suspended in distilled water and centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 20 min. The precipitate was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, and 6 m urea and was subjected to a DEAE-toyopearl column equilibrated with the same buffer. The flow-through was collected, and urea was removed by dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), and 1 mm EDTA. The solution was subjected to a butyl-Toyopearl column and eluted with the same conditions as used for TF1-ϵ subunit purification. The mutant (K109A) CF1-ϵ subunit, whose inhibitory effect on ATPase activity of CF1 was unchanged, was used in the experiments. For simplicity, we call this mutant (K109A) CF1-ϵ subunit as just CF1-ϵ in this paper. Molecular masses of purified ϵ subunits examined by mass spectrography agreed with the values predicted from amino acid sequences (data not shown).Preparation of Nucleotide-depleted TF1-ϵ—The TF1-ϵ subunits purified as above contained 0.3 to 1.1 mol/mol of bound ATP. To remove this bound ATP, TF1-ϵ subunit was mixed with hexokinase (Roche Diagnostics) (15 units/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8), 100 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 200 mm glucose. The mixture was dialyzed against a 200-fold volume of the same buffer without hexokinase overnight at room temperature. Then the mixture was concentrated by a centrifugal ultrafiltration device (MWCO 5000K, Vivaspin, Vivascience) and subjected to a gel filtration HPLC column (Superdex 200HR 10/30, inner diameter 10 × 300 mm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 100 mm KCl to remove hexokinase and glucose. The collected peak contained 0.06 mol of bound ATP/mol of ϵ (termed as ϵ(nd) for nucleotide-depleted ϵ subunit) and used in the experiments. As the ϵ subunits from other sources did not contain bound nucleotides, they were used for the gel filtration assay without such treatment.Detection of ATP Binding to ϵ Subunit—TF1-ϵ(nd) or ϵ subunits from other F1-ATPase (25 μm) were preincubated with the indicated concentrations of nucleotides in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8), 100 mm KCl, and 4 mm MgCl2 for 10 min at room temperature. Then the mixtures were subjected to a Sephadex G-25F (Amersham Biosciences) HPLC column (inner diameter 10 × 300 mm) at room temperature and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8), and 100 mm KCl at flow rate 1.5 ml/min. The elution of proteins was monitored by absorbance at 290 nm, and the elution of the nucleotides was monitored by absorbance at 260 nm. In the case when Mg2+ requirement was examined, MgCl2 was omitted from the incubation buffer and 10 mm EDTA or 1,2-cyclohexanediaminetetraacetic acid (CyDTA) was included instead. For ADP, hexokinase (15 units/ml) and 200 mm glucose were included in the mixture during preincubation to remove the contaminated ATP in the commercial ADP.Photoaffinity Labeling of ϵ Subunit by BzATP—TF1-ϵ(nd) (5 μm) was incubated with 20 μm 3′(2′)-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyladenosine 5′-triphosphate (BzATP, Sigma) (27Williams N. Coleman P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2834-2841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 10 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm KCl, and 4 mm MgCl2. UV irradiation was carried out with a UV transilluminator (CSF-10CF, Cosmo bio, Japan) with 5-cm spacing for 10 min. DTT (10 mm) was added after UV irradiation, and 30 μl of the reaction mixture was subjected to analysis with 15% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250.Other Procedures—UV absorption spectra of TF1-ϵ subunit were measured with a UV absorbance meter (V-550, Jasco, Japan) with a slit width at 5 nm. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213510) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For TF1-ϵ subunit, the values of Bradford assays were corrected according to the quantitative amino acids analyses.RESULTSUnusual Absorption Spectrum of Purified TF1-ϵ—We noticed that the UV absorption spectra of the TF1-ϵ subunit isolated from expressing E. coli were unusual because the peak was ∼265 nm and magnitude was varied from preparation to preparation (Fig. 1). As the difference spectra among the preparations showed the peak around 262 nm, it was suspected that the TF1-ϵ preparations might contain bound nucleotides. We denatured TF1-ϵ by acid treatment, removed the denatured proteins, analyzed the supernatant fraction with HPLC as described (29Hisabori T. Muneyuki E. Odaka M. Yokoyama K. Mochizuki K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4551-4556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and found that the preparations indeed contained 0.3–1.1 mol of ATP per mol of ϵ subunit (data not shown). When the isolated TF1-ϵ was incubated with hexokinase and glucose (see “Experimental Procedures”), the amount of the bound ATP decreased to 0.06 mol/mol of TF1-ϵ, and the UV absorption spectrum of the thus treated TF1-ϵ(nd) (Fig. 1) agreed roughly to the spectrum expected from the content of aromatic amino acid residues in TF1-ϵ (two Tyrs and no Trp).TF1-ϵ(nd) Binds ATP—To know if TF1-ϵ(nd) was able to bind ATP again, TF1-ϵ(nd) was mixed with ATP, preincubated, and subjected to the gel filtration column chromatography. The TF1-ϵ was eluted at 6.2 min, and the small peak of TF1-ϵ(nd) without ATP preincubation seen in the elution profile monitored at 260 nm was attributed to the absorption of TF1-ϵ(nd) itself (Fig. 2A). Elution of the TF1-ϵ(nd):ATP (1:0.4) mixture showed the 6.2-min peak with increased height and no peak corresponding to the free ATP, indicating that all of the added ATP was associated to TF1-ϵ(nd). The 6.2-min peak height was further increased for the elution of the TF1-ϵ(nd):ATP (1:1) mixture but saturated for the 1:2 mixture elution in which the peak of free ATP appeared. These results suggest that TF1-ϵ(nd) binds 1 mol of ATP and that the TF1-ϵ-ATP complex is stable as far as giving rise to an isolated peak in the gel filtration column chromatography. A notice should be added, however, that some fraction of the complex dissociated during chromatography because there was small tailing after the 6.2-min peak in the elution of the TF1-ϵ(nd):ATP (1:1) mixture. Mg2+ was not required for ATP to bind to TF1-ϵ(nd), because even when we omitted Mg2+ from the mixture and supplemented EDTA or CyDTA instead, ATP was still co-eluted with TF1-ϵ(nd) at 6.2 min (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Gel filtration analyses of the nucleotides binding to TF1-ϵ subunit. The mixtures of ϵ subunits (25 μm) and nucleotides at indicated molar ratios containing 4 mm Mg2+ (except for B) were incubated at room temperature, and binding of nucleotide to ϵ subunit was analyzed with a Sephadex G-25F HPLC column. Elutions monitored by absorbance at 260 nm are shown. ϵ subunit was eluted at 6.2 min (arrows). A, binding analysis of ATP to TF1-ϵ(nd). The mixtures with 1:0, 1:0.4, 1:1, and 1:2 TF1-ϵ(nd):ATP molar ratios were analyzed. B, binding analysis of Mg2+-free ATP to TF1-ϵ(nd). The TF1-ϵ(nd):ATP (1:1) mixtures in Mg2+-free buffer supplemented with 10 mm EDTA or CyDTA were analyzed. Elutions of TF1-ϵ(nd) only and the TF1-ϵ(nd): ATP (1:1) mixture with Mg2+ are also shown as thin lines for reference. C, binding analysis of the ADP, GTP, CTP, and UTP to TF1-ϵ(nd). The TF1-ϵ(nd):nucleotide (1:2) mixtures were analyzed. Elutions of TF1-ϵ(nd) only and the TF1-ϵ(nd):ATP (1:2) mixture are also shown as thin lines for reference. The vertical scale bar in A represents absorbance unit of 0.005 at 260 nm. Other experimental conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Photoaffinity Label of TF1-ϵ by BzATP—ATP binding to TF1-ϵ(nd) was also confirmed by a different means. A photoaffinity ATP analog, BzATP, was added to the solution of TF1-ϵ(nd) and irradiated by UV. As shown in Fig. 3, the irradiated TF1-ϵ(nd) generated a new band in SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3, arrowhead). This represents the TF1-ϵ(nd) labeled by BzATP. The new band disappeared by addition of ATP, ensuring that BzATP competes for the same site with ATP.Fig. 3Photoaffinity labeling of TF1-ϵ subunit by BzATP. The TF1-ϵ(nd) was incubated with BzATP and irradiated with UV light. The reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Lane 1, TF1-ϵ(nd) without UV irradiation; lane 2, TF1-ϵ(nd) irradiated without nucleotides; lane 3, TF1-ϵ(nd) irradiated in the presence of 20 μm of BzATP; lane 4,TF1-ϵ(nd) irradiated in the presence of 20 μm BzATP and 200 μm ATP. A newly appeared band by irradiation in the presence of BzATP is marked with an arrowhead. Only the region around ϵ subunit bands is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Specificity of Nucleotides That Bind to TF1-ϵ—The bindings of ADP, GTP, UTP, and CTP were also tested by gel filtration chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2C, none of them changed the height of the 6.2-min peak of TF1-ϵ(nd) but rather they were eluted as free nucleotides. Thus TF1-ϵ(nd) only binds ATP but not other nucleotides under the examined conditions. This is in sharp contrast to the nucleotide binding specificity to the α and β subunits of F1; ADP and GTP can bind to the α and β subunits (30Senior A.E. Lee R.S.F. Al-Shawi M.K. Weber J. Arch.

The strict discrimination of ATP from ADP by TF1-ϵ is indicative of a possible role of the ϵ subunit as a sensor for cellular ATP concentration.TF1-ϵΔC Did Not Bind ATP—It has been demonstrated that the C-terminally truncated TF1-ϵΔC (Met1–Val90) is capable of mediating the binding of F1 to F0 to form F0F1 that catalyzes ATP-driven H+ pumping although it does not exert an inhibitory effect on ATPase activity (16Kato-Yamada Y. Bald D. Koike M. Motohashi K. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33991-33994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We examined the binding of ATP to the isolated TF1-ϵΔC, but the binding was not detected (Fig. 4A). Therefore, the helical hairpin of the C-terminal domain is indispensable to generate the ATP-binding site on the ϵ subunit.Fig. 4Gel filtration analyses of the nucleotides binding to TF1-ϵΔC and ϵ subunits from other sources. A, binding analysis of ATP to TF1-ϵΔC. Elution of TF1-ϵΔC only is shown as a reference. B–D, binding analysis of ATP to EF1-ϵ, BF1-ϵ and CF1-ϵ. The ϵ:ATP (1:2) mixtures were analyzed. Other conditions of analyses were the same as described in the legend of Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)F1-ϵ Subunits from Other Sources Did Not Bind ATP—Expecting that the ATP binding nature of F1-ϵ would be common to wide range of organisms, we tested ATP binding to the isolated F1-ϵ subunits from three sources as follows: a Gram-negative bacterium, E. coli; a Gram-positive bacterium, B. subtilis; and chloroplasts of the plant Spinacia oleracea L. However, none of them bound ATP under the conditions where TF1-ϵ bound ATP (Fig. 4, B–D).DISCUSSIONSince its isolation as the smallest subunit of F1 3 decade ago (32Nelson N. Nelson H. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7657-7662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the idea has never come to attention that the ϵ subunit has the ability to bind nucleotide. No typical nucleotide-binding motif has been found in the amino acid sequence of the ϵ subunit, and no typical nucleotide binding domain has been noticed in the three-dimensional structures of the ϵ subunit either as an isolated one or in the F1 (11Uhlin U.

However, now we know that the ϵ subunit, at least the one from thermophilic Bacillus, is an ATP-binding protein. It is surprising that such a small protein (14 kDa) can generate a very specific ATP-binding site in its structure, and probably TF1-ϵ is one of the smallest proteins that bind nucleotide.The finding raises an attractive possibility that the ϵ subunit of F0F1 senses the varying cellular ATP concentration, i.e. when ATP concentration is elevated, ATP binding to the ϵ subunit in the down state facilitates the conformational transition of the ϵ subunit in F0F1 from the up state, which is an ATP synthesis mode, to the down state, which is presumably the mode less favorable for ATP synthesis. In this hypothetical scenario, the ϵ subunit plays dual roles, sensing the ATP level in the cell and regulating the activity of F0F1 by conformational transition. However, apparently inconsistent with this hypothesis, the ϵ subunits from other sources do not bind ATP. Also, ATP binding to the ϵ subunit assembled in F0F1 (or F1) has not been demonstrated yet. The affinity of ATP to the ϵ subunit in F0F1 is probably around the cellular ATP concentration, i.e. the order of mm, for effective sensing of cellular energy conditions. If so, detection of such weak binding might be difficult by usual binding measurements. The isolated TF1-ϵ shows strong affinity to ATP probably only at temperatures much lower than the living temperature of the organism. Actually, ATP was dissociated from TF1-ϵ rapidly at 50 °C. 2Y.

It consists of five kinds of subunits with a stoichiometry of α3β3γ1δ1ϵ1 in which the catalytic nucleotide-binding sites are located on the β subunits and the non-catalytic nucleotide-binding sites are on the α subunits. The γ subunit inserts its long coiled-coil helices into the central cavity of the α3β3 cylinder (3Abrahams J.P. Leslie A. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar), and ATP hydrolysis occurring in the α3β3 drives rotation of the γ subunit along with the ϵ subunit that is associated with the γ subunit (reviewed in Ref. 2Yoshida M.

Responding to the varying energy supply for ATP synthesis in living organisms, the activity of F0F1 must be regulated. Eukaryotic organellar F0F1 has developed unique regulatory systems; mitochondrial F0F1 has a specific ATPase inhibitor protein and its cofactor proteins (4Pullman M.E. Monroy G.C. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2139478442,"Fallopian tube carcinoma (FTC) is a rare, poorly studied and aggressive cancer, associated with poor survival. Since tumorigenesis is related to the acquisition of genetic changes, we used genome-wide array comparative genomic hybridization to analyse copy number aberrations occurring in FTC in order to obtain a better understanding of FTC carcinogenesis and to identify prognostic events and targets for therapy. We used arrays of 2464 genomic clones, providing approximately 1.4 Mb resolution across the genome to map genomic DNA copy number aberrations quantitatively from 14 FTC onto the human genome sequence. All tumors showed a high frequency of copy number aberrations with recurrent gains on 3q, 6p, 7q, 8q, 12p, 17q, 19 and 20q, and losses involving chromosomes 4, 5q, 8p, 16q, 17p, 18q and X. Recurrent regions of amplification included 1p34, 8p11-q11, 8q24, 12p, 17p13, 17q12-q21, 19p13, 19q12-q13 and 19q13. Candidate, known oncogenes mapping to these amplicons included CMYC (8q24), CCNE1 (19q12-q21) and AKT2 (19q13), whereas PIK3CA and KRAS, previously suggested to be candidate driver genes for amplification, mapped outside copy number maxima on 3q and 12p, respectively. The FTC were remarkably homogeneous, with some recurrent aberrations occurring in more than 70% of samples, which suggests a stereotyped pattern of tumor evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1997618475,"Gastric carcinoma is the fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide but its molecular biology is poorly understood. We catalogued the genes expressed in two gastric adenocarcinomas and normal stomach, using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), and compared the profiles on-line with other glandular epithelia. Candidates were validated by Northern blotting and immunohistochemistry. A total of 29 480 transcripts, derived from 10 866 genes, were identified. In all, 1% of the genes were differentially expressed (>/=fivefold difference plus P-value </=0.01) between cancers and normal stomach. The most abundant transcripts included ribosomal and mitochondrial proteins, of which most were upregulated in the tumours, as were other widely expressed genes including transcription factors, signalling molecules (serine/threonine protein kinases), thymosin beta 10 and collagenase I. Transcripts abundant in normal stomach were functionally important, including gastrin, immunoglobulin alpha, lysozyme, MUC5, pS2 and pepsinogens, which were among 55 gastric-specific genes. Many transcripts were minimally characterized or new, some cancer-associated genes reflected their intestinal morphology, and some normal gastric genes had previously been considered as pancreatic carcinoma markers. The gastric carcinoma profiles resembled other tumours', supporting the existence of common cancer-associated targets. These data provide a catalogue from which to develop markers for better diagnosis and therapy of gastric carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2050851430,"Genetic studies, together with amino acid and structural similarities to the clamp loaders of DNA polymerase sliding clamps, have suggested that the Cdc6 protein may function as a loader for the eukaryotic replicative helicase, the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex. Thus, Cdc6 may act as the functional homologue of the bacterial DnaC that utilizes ATP hydrolysis to assemble the DnaB helicase at the origin. This report shows that the helicase activity of an MCM homologue from the archaeon Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus is inhibited in the presence of the Cdc6 homologues. This inhibitory activity is dependent, as for DnaC, on ATP binding to Cdc6. Moreover, an intact Cdc6 winged helix domain is required for efficient inhibition. Two-hybrid analyses indicated that MCM and Cdc6 interact and that the interaction is mediated by the winged helix domain.

In all organisms, the initiation of DNA replication requires the assembly of multiprotein complexes at the origin. In Escherichia coli, the origin recognition factor, DnaA, binds to oriC where, aided by additional proteins, it unwinds the origin. The DnaB helicase complexed to ATP-bound DnaC is then recruited to the origin to form a prepriming complex. On binding to the origin DNA, the DnaC ATP is hydrolyzed, releasing DnaC and activating the DnaB helicase (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H.

In eukarya, initiation starts with the assembly of a six subunit origin recognition complex (ORC) 1The abbreviations used are: ORC, origin recognition complex; AD, activation domain; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CSM, complete supplement mixture; DB, DNA binding domain; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; h, human; MCM, minichromosome maintenance; mt, M. thermautotrophicus ΔH; pre-RC, pre-replication complex; sc, S. cerevisiae; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; ss, S. solfataricus; pa, P. aerophilum; WH, winged helix; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; WH, winged helix.1The abbreviations used are: ORC, origin recognition complex; AD, activation domain; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CSM, complete supplement mixture; DB, DNA binding domain; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; h, human; MCM, minichromosome maintenance; mt, M. thermautotrophicus ΔH; pre-RC, pre-replication complex; sc, S. cerevisiae; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; ss, S. solfataricus; pa, P. aerophilum; WH, winged helix; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; WH, winged helix. at the origin, with ORC serving as a platform on which the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) is assembled. The pre-RC includes, in addition to ORC, the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase, Cdc6, Cdt1, and several additional proteins. The release of the helicase and the initiation of DNA synthesis depend on the activity of several proteins including MCM10, geminin, Cdc45, and several cell cycle-dependent kinases (3Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar, 4Bell S.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic MCM is a family of six essential proteins (MCM2–7) with highly conserved amino acid sequences. In vivo and in vitro studies have revealed that in addition to the heterohexameric form, the proteins can form several additional complexes with different combinations of the MCM proteins (5Tye B.K. Sawyer S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34833-34836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies with the various complexes have shown that a dimeric complex of the MCM4,6,7 heterotrimer contained 3′–5′-DNA helicase activity, ssDNA binding, and DNA-dependent ATPase activities, whereas its interactions with either MCM2 or MCM3,5 inhibited the helicase activity (5Tye B.K.

Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F. Science. 2000; 288: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), and mutational analyses have shown that physical interactions between specific members of the two subgroups (MCM4,6,7 and MCM2,3,5) are required for efficient ATPase activity (9Schwacha A. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1093-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic Cdc6 has been shown to be an essential component of the pre-RC, required for the recruitment of the MCM helicase to the origin (10Weinreich M. Liang C. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It has also been shown to modulate ORC structure and its DNA binding properties (11Mizushima T. Takahashi N. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1631-1641PubMed Google Scholar). Following MCM loading and the initiation of S phase, Cdc6 is phosphorylated by CDKs, transported to the cytoplasm, and eventually degraded in a ubiquitin-dependent manner (12Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z.H. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Cdc6 protein shows significant similarity to the clamp loaders of DNA polymerase processivity factors (13Perkins G. Diffley J.F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which assemble a ring-shaped sliding clamp that associates with the replicative polymerase on primed DNA and serves as its processivity factor (14Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The similarities between Cdc6 and the clamp loaders of DNA polymerase, together with the genetic and in vivo observations, suggest that Cdc6 may act as a loading factor for MCM (10Weinreich M. Liang C. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 13Perkins G. Diffley J.F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In the 3rd domain of life, the archaea, DNA replication proteins resemble those of eukarya but assume somewhat simpler forms. Most archaeal species that have been sequenced contain at least one Cdc6 homologue and one MCM homologue (15Grabowski B. Kelman Z. Annu. Rev.

In the archaeon Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus (mt) one MCM and two Cdc6 homologues (mtCdc6-1 and mtCdc6-2) have been identified. Biochemical studies with the mtMCM protein demonstrated that the enzyme possesses properties similar to those of the eukaryotic MCM4,6,7 complex, including ssDNA binding, ATPase activity stimulated by DNA, and 3′–5′-helicase activity that is dependent on ATP or dATP hydrolysis (17Kelman Z.

Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the Cdc6 homologue from the archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum (pa) revealed the expected domains found in other members of the AAA+ super-family of ATPases (22Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). The protein also contains a C-terminal winged helix (WH) domain (domain III), which has been identified in Cdc6 proteins from all organisms. Studies with the archaeal homologues of Cdc6 revealed the need for an intact WH domain for dsDNA interactions (16Kelman L.M. Kelman Z. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Grabowski B. Kelman Z. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5459-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To date, only one biochemical study has been reported on mtCdc6-1 and -2 proteins (23Grabowski B. Kelman Z. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5459-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It was shown that the proteins interact with both ssDNA and dsDNA and that dsDNA binding is mediated by the WH motif at the C terminus. It was also demonstrated that the proteins undergo autophosphorylation on Ser residues utilizing the γ-phosphate of ATP or dATP. This autophosphorylation is inhibited in the presence of ssDNA and dsDNA. Although helicase loading and the initiation process are not yet well understood in eukarya, the well characterized bacterial system may provide a model for the loading mechanism. In eukarya, the Cdc6 protein is presumed to be the helicase loader functioning in a fashion similar to the bacterial DnaC (24Lee D.G. Bell S.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which assembles the DnaB helicase around the origin DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. When complexed with DnaB, DnaC inhibits the ATPase and helicase activities of DnaB, but on ATP hydrolysis by DnaC and assembly of the helicase around origin DNA, DnaC is released from both DnaB and the origin (25Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2463-2468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2469-2475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP binding to DnaC is not necessary for its interaction with DnaB but is needed for the inhibition of DnaB activity (27Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This inhibition is thought to prevent DnaB from functioning in an origin-independent manner. Thus, if the Cdc6 protein is the helicase loader, it may function in a manner similar to DnaC, and its interaction with MCM should also inhibit the helicase. In this study, the effects of mtCdc6-1 and -2 on mtMCM helicase activity were examined. The results show that the helicase activity of mtMCM is inhibited in the presence of either mtCdc6-1, mtCdc6-2, or both simultaneously. The data demonstrate that the inhibition is dependent on ATP binding by mtCdc6. Moreover, the mtCdc6 WH motif is required for the inhibitory activity. It also appears that the inhibition is different for different archaeal Cdc6 and MCM proteins, suggesting functional divergence in the archaeal Cdc6 and MCM homologues. Labeled and unlabeled ATP and dATP were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. ssM13mp19 was from New England Biolabs, and oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. mtMCM and paCdc6 were purified as described previously (23Grabowski B. Kelman Z. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5459-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the purification of Sulfolobus solfataricus (ss) MCM will be described elsewhere. Constructing the mtCdc6-1 and -2 Mutants—The mtCdc6-1 and -2 single amino acid mutants were generated with the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using a pET-16b plasmid (Novagen) containing the wild-type gene as a template. Following mutagenesis, the genes were sequenced to ensure that no additional mutations were created. The truncated forms of mtCdc6-1 and -2 were generated using PCR in which the 3′ primers contained a stop codon after residue 286 (mtCdc6-1) or 291 (mtCdc6-2), as suggested by Liu et al. (28Liu J. Smith C.L. DeRyckere D. DeAngelis K. Martin G.S. Berger J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of mtCdc6 Recombinant Proteins—All proteins were overexpressed and purified to near-homogeneity from E. coli (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen) using a modification of a protocol provided by Dr. James Berger. Cells harboring the different plasmids were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium in the presence of appropriate antibiotics. When the culture reached an A 600 of 0.5, protein expression was induced by incubation in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, after which time the cells were harvested. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl, and 20% glycerol. After sonication, the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C, and the lysate was bound to the appropriate amount of Ni2+ beads with gentle shaking for 1 h at 4 °C. Following binding, the mixture was poured into a column and washed with lysis buffer followed by a wash with lysis buffer containing 10 mm imidazole at 4 °C. The column was moved to 22 °C, and all subsequent elution steps were carried out at that temperature. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of 100 mm and 2 column volumes of 150 mm imidazole in elution buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.4 m potassium acetate, and 20% glycerol. The proteins were then eluted in 0.5–1-ml fractions with increasing concentrations of imidazole (200, 250, 300, and 350 mm) in the same elution buffer. Each protein eluted in a different imidazole concentration in this range. The protein in the eluted fractions was visualized with SDS-PAGE, and protein concentrations were measured by Bradford (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. Protein samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 °C. Preparation of Substrates for Helicase Assays—Three oligonucleotides were used for the preparation of the helicase substrates. These included a 100-mer, 5′-CTGCCCGCTTTCCAGTCGGGAAACCTGTCGTGCCAGCTGC(TTTG)15-3′, corresponding to the longer strand of partial duplex substrates (100-mer); an 80-mer, 5′-(GTTT)10GCAGCTGGCACGACAGGTTTCCCGACTGGAAAGCGGGCAG-3′ (80-mer); and a 5′-GCAGCTGGCACGACAGGTTTCCCGACTGGAAAGCGGGCAG-3′ (40-mer). Annealing of the 40-mer to the 100-mer or to ssM13mp19 results in substrates with a 3′ single-stranded overhang, referred to as a flat substrate. Annealing of the 80-mer to the 100-mer or to ssM13mp19 results in substrates with both 3′ and 5′ single-stranded overhangs and is referred to as a forked substrate. To prepare the helicase substrates, the short oligonucleotides (either the 40- or the 80-mers) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed either to the 100-mer oligonucleotide or to ssM13mp19. Following annealing, the M13 substrate was purified over a 1-ml Sephacryl HS-300-HR column, and the oligonucleotide substrates were purified from a polyacrylamide gel. DNA Helicase Assay—DNA helicase activity was measured in a reaction mixture (15 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml BSA, 5 mm ATP or dATP, 10 fmol of 32P-labeled DNA substrate (3,000 cpm/fmol), and 25 ng of MCM (0.05 pmol as hexamer). After incubation at 60 °C for 1 h, the reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of 5 × loading buffer (100 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromophenol blue, and 50% glycerol), and aliquots were loaded onto an 8% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, 4.5 mm boric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA) and electrophoresed for 30 min at 200 V and 4 °C. The extent of helicase activity was quantitated by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and presented as the percentage of product released from the substrate. The inhibitory effects of Cdc6 were determined by comparing the product released by the helicase in the presence and absence of the Cdc6 proteins as indicated in the figure legends. Protein Phosphorylation—Protein autophosphorylation assays were performed with 500 ng of protein in a reaction mixture containing 3.3 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP, 25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 500 ng of BSA. The samples were incubated for 20 min at 65 °C in the presence or absence of 0.33 mm ATP or dATP. Following incubation, the proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and autoradiography. Two-hybrid Analyses—For the two-hybrid analyses, the genes encoding mtCdc6-1, truncated mtCdc6-1 (mtCdc6-1T), paCdc6, and mtMCM were cloned into the pDBLeu vector (Invitrogen) resulting in a fusion protein with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DB) (pDBLeu-mtCdc6, pDBLeu-mtCdc6T, pDBLeu-paCdc6, and pDBLeu-MCM, respectively). The gene encoding mtMCM was also cloned into the pPC86 (Invitrogen) resulting in a fusion protein with the GAL4 activation domain (AD) (pPC86-MCM). Plasmids encoding for AD and DB fusion proteins were co-transformed into yeast MaV203 cells (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were plated on complete supplement mixture (CSM) plates without Leu and Trp and grown for 2–3 days at 30 °C. Colonies were streaked on CSM plates minus Leu, Trp, and His and containing 10 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole to suppress glycerol phosphate dehydratase, an enzyme involved in histidine biosynthesis. Colonies were also streaked on CSM plates minus Leu, Trp, and Ura. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2–3 days. Growth on these plates indicates that the proteins fused to the AD and DB interact. mtCdc6 Proteins Inhibit the Helicase Activity of mtMCM—As a first step in determining whether Cdc6 is the helicase loader, the ability of the archaeal Cdc6 to inhibit MCM helicase activity was determined. As shown in Fig. 1A, both mtCdc6-1 and -2, individually (lanes 4–6 and 8–10) and in combination (lanes 12–14), inhibited MCM helicase activity in a concentration-dependent manner (compare lanes 4–6, 8–10, and 12–14 to lanes 3, 7, and 11). The molar ratios of mtCdc6:mtMCM in the experiments shown in Fig. 1 ranged from 1.5 to 15. However, unlike DnaC, which was shown to stimulate the helicase activity of DnaB at a ratio of 1:1 and to inhibit it at higher molar ratios (26Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2469-2475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), neither inhibition nor stimulation was seen when lower ratios (0.013–1.5) of mtCdc6:mtMCM were used (data not shown). Although both proteins inhibited helicase activity, mtCdc6-2 was a consistently better inhibitor than mtCdc6-1 in all substrates used (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Notably, the combined inhibition of the two proteins was at the level of mtCdc6-1, which, although a less effective inhibitor of helicase activity, may be a better competitor for interaction with MCM. The two proteins may also act as heterodimers, with mtCdc6-1 suppressing the inhibitory activity of mtCdc6-2. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments indicated that mtCdc6-2 may dimerize in solution, and in vivo and in vitro studies of eukaryotic Cdc6 have also suggested that the Cdc6 proteins may form oligomers (12Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z.H. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 29Herbig U. Marlar C.A. Fanning E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2631-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although all experiments were performed with both proteins, only the results with mtCdc6-2 will be presented, unless otherwise specified. ATP Binding by mtCdc6-2 Is Required for Inhibition of mt-MCM Helicase Activity—ATP binding was found to be necessary for the inhibition of helicase activity by DnaC, whereas ATP hydrolysis was found to release that inhibition and activate DnaB (27Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This could be demonstrated because DnaB and DnaC can utilize different nucleotides, i.e. DnaB can function with CTP but DnaC does not (27Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the presence of CTP, DnaC did not inhibit DnaB helicase activity, even at high DnaC concentrations, and DnaC-ATP-γ-S inhibited DnaB helicase activity better than DnaC-ATP. However, unlike DnaB and DnaC, mtMCM and mtCdc6 can only utilize ATP or dATP (17Kelman Z. Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14783-14788Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 23Grabowski B. Kelman Z. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5459-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, the requirement for ATP binding and/or hydrolysis for the inhibition of MCM helicase activity was determined using wild-type mtCdc6-2 protein as well as proteins with mutations at the Walker-A (Lys71 → Glu) and Walker-B (Asp148 → Asn) sites. mtCdc6-1 and -2 exhibit extremely weak ATPase activity, 2Z. Kelman, unpublished observations. and their ability to hydrolyze ATP has been demonstrated indirectly by their ability to autophosphorylate (23Grabowski B. Kelman Z. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5459-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). On the basis of mutational analyses in other members of the AAA+ family of ATPases and the autophosphorylation assays of mtCdc6, it appears that the Walker-A mutant of mtCdc6-2 can neither bind nor hydrolyze ATP, whereas the Walker-B mutant can bind ATP but has reduced ATPase activity. As shown in Fig. 2A, the mtCdc6-2 Lys → Glu mutant is a much less efficient inhibitor of helicase activity than the wild-type protein or the Asp → Asn mutant (A, compare lanes 7–9 to lanes 4–6 and 10–12). This suggests that ATP binding but not hydrolysis is needed for the inhibitory activity of mtCdc6-2. In addition, just as DnaC-ATP-γ-S inhibited DnaB activity better than DnaC-ATP, mtCdc6 Asp → Asn inhibited mtMCM activity better than the wild-type protein (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 10–12 to lanes 4–6; see also C), suggesting that its ability to bind ATP but its lower level of ATP hydrolysis resulted in a more efficient inhibition of the helicase. These results are further supported by the use of dATP instead of ATP in the reaction. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, wild-type mtCdc6-2 inhibited mtMCM helicase activity to a similar extent with either ATP or dATP (lanes 4–6, see also C). As expected, the inhibition by the Lys → Glu mutant was the same whether ATP or dATP was used (A and B, lanes 7–9; see also C), as neither nucleotide can bind to this mutant. However, the inhibitory behavior of the Asp → Asn mutant with dATP (B, lanes 10–12) differed from that with ATP. Although this mutant inhibited the helicase more efficiently than wild-type when ATP was used (A, lanes 10–12, see also C), its inhibitory effect was diminished when dATP was used (B, lanes 10–12), with helicase inhibition intermediate between the wild-type and the Lys → Glu mutant (Fig. 2, A–C), suggesting a lower affinity for the deoxyribose. To determine whether the reduced inhibitory effect is indeed due to the inability of the Asp → Asn mutant to interact efficiently with dATP, an autophosphorylation assay was performed in the presence or absence of unlabeled nucleotides (Fig. 2D). It was previously shown that the archaeal Cdc6 proteins can undergo in vitro autophosphorylation on Ser residues using the γ-phosphate of ATP or dATP (16Kelman L.M. Kelman Z. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Grabowski B. Kelman Z. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5459-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It was postulated that the enzyme has to bind the nucleotide and to sever the interactions between the β- and γ-phosphates prior to the transfer of the γ-phosphate to the Ser residue (23Grabowski B. Kelman Z. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5459-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Whereas an excess of either ATP or dATP inhibits the autophosphorylation of the wild-type protein (compare lane 2 to lanes 3 and 4), only ATP could effectively inhibit the Asp → Asn mutant (compare lane 5 to lanes 6 and 7). The Lys → Glu mutant does not autophosphorylate, as it does not bind any nucleotide (lanes 8–10). These results strongly suggest that the mtCdc6-2 Asp → Asn mutant has a reduced ability to bind dATP, possibly due to structural changes in the Walker-B site of the mutant protein. Both DnaC and human (h) Cdc6 show different affinities for ATP and dATP. DnaC was shown to have a 2–3 order of magnitude lower affinity for dATP compared with ATP (30Galletto R. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8921-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Similarly, hCdc6 showed little direct binding to dATP (29Herbig U. Marlar C.A. Fanning E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2631-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A suggested explanation for the differences between the effect of ATP and dATP on the Asp → Asn mutant of mtCdc6-2 comes from an examination of the crystal structure of the paCdc6 (28Liu J. Smith C.L. DeRyckere D. DeAngelis K. Martin G.S. Berger J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). It was shown that the 2′-OH group of the nucleotide ribose participates in local interactions with an Arg residue located between the sensor I and sensor II regions of the protein (28Liu J. Smith C.L. DeRyckere D. DeAngelis K. Martin G.S. Berger J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, these interactions are disrupted with dATP. In addition, the crystal structure of paCdc6 shows that the acidic groups of the Walker-B motif (D(D/E)XX) stabilize nucleotide binding. Thus, although the wild-type protein with intact Walker-A and -B sites may compensate for the reduced affinity of the deoxyribose, the Asp → Asn mutant with a weakened Walker-B site may no longer efficiently bind dATP. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that, similar to the observation in E. coli, efficient inhibition of MCM helicase activity requires ATP binding but not hydrolysis by the Cdc6 proteins. The Winged Helix Domain of Cdc6 Is Needed for Efficient Inhibition of Helicase Activity—The three-dimensional structure of paCdc6 protein revealed the presence of a WH fold at the C terminus of the protein (28Liu J. Smith C.L. DeRyckere D. DeAngelis K. Martin G.S. Berger J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Subsequent biochemical studies demonstrated that the WH domain of several archaeal Cdc6 proteins is involved in interactions with dsDNA (16Kelman L.M. Kelman Z. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Grabowski B. Kelman Z. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5459-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The need for the WH domain in the inhibition of helicase activity was examined with truncated forms of mtCdc6-1 and -2, in which this domain was removed. As shown in Fig. 3, the inhibition of helicase activity by the truncated forms of mtCdc6-2 was lower than that of the full-length proteins (compare B to A, E to D; see also C and F). This was true for the truncated wild-type as well as the truncated Walker-A and -B mutants. Similar results were obtained with mtCdc6-1 (data not shown). These results suggest that dsDNA binding by the Cdc6 proteins may be required for efficient inhibition of helicase activity. It is also possible, however, that the WH domain participates in the interactions with MCM. Indeed, two-hybrid analyses showed that mtCdc6 and mtMCM interact (Fig. 4), as has also been found in budding yeast (32Jang S.W. Elsasser S. Campbell J.L. Kim J. Biochem. J."
https://openalex.org/W2080987438,"Many flowering plants possess a self-incompatibility system to prevent inbreeding. In Brassica rapa, self/non-self recognition in mating is established through S-haplotype-specific interactions between stigma receptors and S-locus protein 11 (SP11, also called S-locus cysteine-rich protein) that is encoded at the highly polymorphic S-locus. Here we describe the solution structure of the SP11 protein of the S 8-haplotype (S 8-SP11), which specifically binds to the stigma factor of the same haplotype.

Kao T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). SI is based on self and non-self discrimination processes between pollens and stigmas, followed by selective inhibition of self pollen germination and/or growth. For Brassica rapa, the SI system is controlled sporophytically by multiple haplotypes at a single locus, termed the S-locus. Recognition between pollen and stigma is achieved by gene products of the S-locus, which contains three highly polymorphic genes: SP11/SCR (2Suzuki G. Kai N. Hirose T. Fukui K. Nishio T. Takayama S. Isogai A. Watanabe M. Hinata K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 391-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Schopfer C.R. Nasrallah M.E. Nasrallah J.B. Science. 1999; 286: 1697-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), S-locus receptor kinase (SRK) (4Stein J.C. Howlett B. Boyes D.C. Nasrallah M.E. Nasrallah J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8816-8820Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), and S-locus glycoprotein (SLG) (5Nasrallah J.B. Kao T.-h. Chen C.-H. Goldgerg M.L. Nasrallah M.E. Nature. 1987; 326: 617-619Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 6Takayama S. Isogai A. Tsukamoto C. Ueda Y. Hinata K. Okazaki K. Suzuki A. Nature. 1987; 326: 102-105Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). SP11 encodes a small cysteine-rich protein that determines the S-haplotype specificity of pollen, whereas SRK encodes a transmembrane receptor-like serine-threonine kinase that determines the S-haplotype specificity of the stigma. SLG is an abundant cell wall-associated glycoprotein similar in sequence to the extracellular domain of SRK. Among these pollen and stigma factors, SRK and SLG, the female factors, exhibited several features typical of SI factors. They are predominantly expressed in stigma papilla cells immediately prior to flower opening concomitant with the acquisition of SI in the stigma. Their sequence variations are correlated with the S-haplotypes. Following the accumulation of such circumstantial evidence, “gain-of-function” experiments employing transgenics established that SRK alone determines the S-haplotype specificity of the stigma, whereas SLG facilitates the recognition process (7Takasaki T. Hatakeyama K. Suzuki G. Watanabe M. Isogai A. Hinata K. Nature. 2000; 403: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In contrast to these female factors, the identification of the male S determinant remained elusive. Two approaches were used for its eventual identification: one approach concerned the genome analysis of the S-locus region to identify genes specifically expressed in anthers (8Suzuki G. Watanabe M. Toriyama K. Isogai A. Hinata K. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 199: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), whereas the other employed a fluorescent differential display methodology to identify anther-expressed genes that were specific for the S-haplotype (9Takayama S. Shiba H. Iwano M. Shimosato H. Che F.S. Kai N. Watanabe M. Suzuki G. Hinata K. Isogai A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1920-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). These investigations identified SP11 as a candidate for the male determinant in Brassica. Confirmation was provided through the use of transgenic gain-of-function experiments and a pollination bioassay using purified SP11 (3Schopfer C.R. Nasrallah M.E. Nasrallah J.B. Science. 1999; 286: 1697-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 9Takayama S. Shiba H. Iwano M. Shimosato H. Che F.S. Kai N. Watanabe M. Suzuki G. Hinata K. Isogai A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1920-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). SP11 is predominantly expressed in anther tapetum and accumulates in the pollen coat during pollen maturation (10Iwano M. Shiba H. Funato M. Shimosato H. Takayama S. Isogai A. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 428-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and exists as a monomer in the pollen coat, forming four intramolecular disulfide bonds (11Takayama S. Shimosato H. Shiba H. Funato M. Che F.S. Watanabe M. Iwano M. Isogai A. Nature. 2001; 413: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Chemically synthesized S 8-SP11 has been shown to specifically bind to the stigma membrane of the S 8-haplotype with high affinity (Kd = 0.7 nm) (11Takayama S. Shimosato H. Shiba H. Funato M. Che F.S. Watanabe M. Iwano M. Isogai A. Nature. 2001; 413: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 12Takayama S. Isogai A. J. Exp. Bot. 2003; 54: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A chemical cross-linking experiment suggested that the S 8-SP11 binding site in the stigma membrane was composed of SRK8 and SLG8 (or its relatives) (11Takayama S. Shimosato H. Shiba H. Funato M. Che F.S. Watanabe M. Iwano M. Isogai A. Nature. 2001; 413: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 12Takayama S. Isogai A. J. Exp. Bot. 2003; 54: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The binding of SP11 to the stigma cell membrane was shown to induce the auto-phosphorylation of SRK, which is likely to trigger the signaling cascade that results in the rejection of self-pollen. This ligand-receptor interaction occurs in an S-haplotype-specific manner, serving as the molecular basis for self-pollen recognition (11Takayama S. Shimosato H. Shiba H. Funato M. Che F.S. Watanabe M. Iwano M. Isogai A. Nature. 2001; 413: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Whole genome analyses of Arabidopsis thaliana suggested that more than 340 genes encode serine/threonine receptor-like kinases (13The Arabidopsis Genome InitiativeNature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7006) Google Scholar). Studies have begun to reveal the involvement of these receptors in intercellular signaling pathways that mediate a wide variety of physiological events in plants (14Shiu, S. H., and Bleecker, A. B. (2001) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/113/re22.Google Scholar). Nevertheless, only a limited number of extracellular ligands for the receptors have been identified (15Takayama S. Sakagami Y. Curr. Opin. Plant. Biol. 2002; 5: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To date, no reports have been published concerning the tertiary structure of the plant receptor kinase or its ligand. Insofar as these receptor kinases are concerned, the interaction between SP11 and the stigma receptor is one of the best characterized at the molecular level (14Shiu, S. H., and Bleecker, A. B. (2001) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/113/re22.Google Scholar, 15Takayama S. Sakagami Y. Curr. Opin. Plant. Biol. 2002; 5: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As a first step toward understanding the SI mechanism, we present here the solution structure of S 8-SP11. Based on the structure and structure-based sequence alignment of allelic SP11s of different S-haplotypes, we identified a loop region that might determine the allele-specific binding to the stigma receptors. Although S 8-SP11 adopts a fold similar to plant defensins, the edges of the loop region are extensively stabilized by disulfide bonds and hydrophobic packing. This feature seems unique to SP11 and thus could be used as a fingerprint to identify SP11s and thus distinguishing them from defensins and other PCP (pollen coat protein) family proteins. NMR Spectroscopy—The mature form of S 8-SP11, a 50-residue peptide without signal sequence, was used for this study. The chemically synthesized peptide fragment was prepared, and the disulfide bond arrangement was determined as previously described (11Takayama S. Shimosato H. Shiba H. Funato M. Che F.S. Watanabe M. Iwano M. Isogai A. Nature. 2001; 413: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The fragment was shown to specifically bind to stigmatic microsomal membrane that contains cognate receptors, and the activity was examined by a pollination bioassay (11Takayama S. Shimosato H. Shiba H. Funato M. Che F.S. Watanabe M. Iwano M. Isogai A. Nature. 2001; 413: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The lyophilized sample was dissolved to 0.5 mm in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 50 mm KCl in either 95% H2O/5% 2H2O or 99.8% 2H2O at pH 6.5. All proton NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX-800 spectrometer equipped with a pulsed-field gradient probe at 10 or 30 °C. All two-dimensional NMR spectra were acquired in a phase-sensitive mode employing a States-TPPI manner. TOCSY spectra were recorded using a DIPSI-2 isotropic mixing sequence with a field strength of 9.6 kHz. Water suppressions in both TOCSY and NOESY were achieved by the WATERGATE scheme (16Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3486) Google Scholar). DQF-COSY spectra were acquired using gradient coherence selection. The identification of spin systems and sequential resonance assignments were carried out by DQF-COSY, TOCSY recorded with a mixing time of 70 ms, and NOESY recorded with a mixing time of 80 or 150 ms. In an effort to identify slow exchanging amide protons, TOCSY spectra were measured at 10 °C immediately after the lyophilized sample was dissolved in 99.8% 2H2O. Lorentz-to-Gauss transformations or shifted sine-bell window functions were applied to the NMR data before zero-filling and Fourier transformation. The processing was performed using the NMRPipe package (17Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (11279) Google Scholar). NMR spectra were analyzed using SPARKY version 3.106 (18Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY3. University of California, San Francisco1999Google Scholar). Chemical shifts were referenced to 4.4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate. Structure Calculations—The structure of S 8-SP11 was calculated using CNS version 1.1 (19Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16918) Google Scholar). In the first step, low resolution structures were calculated using distance, hydrogen bond, and ϕ dihedral angle restraints. Distance restraints were obtained from unambiguous NOEs, hydrogen bonds were estimated from slow exchanging amide protons, whereas ϕ dihedral angles were derived by 3 J HNHα coupling constants obtained from the DQF-COSY spectra. The ϕ angle restraints were classified to –60° ± 25° for 3 J HNHα < 6 Hz, and 120° ± 25° for 3 J HNHa > 10 Hz. In the second stage, the protein structures were further refined using ARIA version 1.1.2 (20Linge J.P. O' Donoghue S. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) with additional restraints, including those derived from ambiguous NOEs, and ψ and χ1 angle restraints. The 13 ψ angle restraints were applied for residues in α-helical and β-strand regions that were estimated by NOE patterns and low resolution structures obtained through the first calculation step. The ψ angles were restrained to –50° ± 35° in the α-helical regions and 135° ± 35° in the β-strand regions. The side-chain χ1 angles were derived by 3 J HαHB-coupling constants obtained from DQF-COSY, and NH-Hβ and Hα-Hβ NOE patterns obtained from NOESY spectra with a mixing time of 80 ms. Finally, six χ1 angles were restrained to 60° ± 25°. A total of 100 structures were refined in the final (ninth) iteration, and the 30 lowest energy structures were analyzed using MOLMOL (21Koradi R. Billete M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6454) Google Scholar) and PROCHEK-NMR (22Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4283) Google Scholar). Sequence Alignment and Homology Modeling—Tertiary structures of other haplotype SP11s were modeled using the NMR structure of S 8-SP11 as a template. Sequences (42Watanabe M. Ito A. Takada Y. Ninomiya C. Kakizaki T. Takahata Y. Hatakeyama K. Hinata K. Suzuki G. Takasaki T. Satta Y. Shiba H. Takayama S. Isogai A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were initially aligned against that of S 8-SP11 so that all of the cysteines lay in the same positions using ClustalW version 1.4 (23Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54899) Google Scholar) of the Bioedit package (24Hall T.A. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1999; 41: 95-98Google Scholar). Homology models were then generated by using the MODELLER program (25Šali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10292) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment was changed manually in an iterative manner until the scoring function of MODELLER reached a minimum value. The modeled structures were superimposed using the “nalgn” utility of the Jackal package version 1.5. 2trantor.bioc.columbia.edu/~xiang/jackal/. The possibility that Cys-36 in S 26-SP11, an additional cysteine located in the unaligned region, was involved in disulfide bond formation was also examined. This was achieved by aligning Cys-36 in S 26-SP11 at cysteine positions of other sequences known to be involved in disulphide bond formation. Homology structures were then generated. The modeled structures displayed severe steric clashes and were unable to assume reasonable folding. Based on these observations, we concluded that Cys-36 of S 26-SP11 was not involved in disulfide bond formation. Resonance Assignments—Proton resonance assignments of S 8-SP11 were obtained by using two-dimensional DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra. Backbone assignment was carried out by a sequential resonance assignment procedure according to Wüthrich (27Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, 1986Crossref Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the NOE sequential walk using cross-peaks between Hα and amide protons. The presence of well dispersed resonance peaks in both dimensions indicated that S 8-SP11 was highly structured. The three-stranded β-sheet was readily characterized by Hα-Hα NOE cross-peaks between strands and strong intensities of the NOE cross-peaks between Hα and the amide proton of the subsequent residues. The resonances of the unique helix were also assigned by characteristic medium-range NOEs. The observation of sequential dαδ(i, i + 1) connectivity clearly indicates that the unique proline residue at position 29 adopts a trans conformation. All proton assignments were obtained except for those of the first three N-terminal residues (residues 1–3), whose backbone signals were not observed in the spectra possibly due to conformational exchange. Structure Determination—The structure of S 8-SP11 was determined from a total of 674 NMR-derived distance and torsion angle restraints. The four disulfide bonds previously identified through proteolytic analyses (11Takayama S. Shimosato H. Shiba H. Funato M. Che F.S. Watanabe M. Iwano M. Isogai A. Nature. 2001; 413: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) were implemented in the molecular topology file. To refine the structure obtained from the CNS calculation using unambiguous restraints, ambiguous restraints were gradually added to the input of the ARIA calculation (20Linge J.P. O' Donoghue S. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). With this process we could add 84 distance restraints. The statistics for the 30 lowest energy structures are shown in Table I. The backbone and side chains in the protein core have been well defined, except for the N-terminal residues and part of the loop regions (residues 1–5, 29–32, and 38–41). Fig. 2A depicts the 30 final structures. Average r.m.s. differences from the averaged structure were 0.36 and 0.81 Å for the backbone and all heavy atoms of well defined regions, respectively.Table IStructural statistics for the final 30 NMR structures of S8-SP11Total distance restraints628Unambiguous522Ambiguous84Hydrogen bonds11 × 2Total dihedral angle restraintsφ angle27ψ angle13χ1 angle6r.m.s.d. from experimental restraintsNOE2.50 × 10-2 ± 5.5 × 10-3 ÅDihedral angle0.85 ± 0.14°r.m.s.d. from ideal covalent geometryBonds2.53 ± 10-3 ± 2 × 10-4 ÅAngles0.48 ± 0.02°Improper0.37 ± 0.02°Van der Waals59.60 ± 4.83 kcal/molRamachandran plot analysisaAs determined by PROCHECK-NMR for the residues 6-28, 33-37, and 42-50.Most favored62.5%Additionally allowed29.0%Generously allowed5.6%Disallowed2.9%r.m.s.d. from the averaged structurebCalculated by MOLMOL for residues 6-28, 33-37, and 42-50.Backbone (N, Cα, C′, and O)0.36 ÅAll heavy atoms0.81 Åa As determined by PROCHECK-NMR for the residues 6-28, 33-37, and 42-50.b Calculated by MOLMOL for residues 6-28, 33-37, and 42-50. Open table in a new tab Structure Description of S8-SP11—The tertiary structure of S 8-SP11 has a compact fold, with the N and C termini located near each other. It folds into an α/β sandwich structure comprising a layer of a twisted three-stranded β-sheet backed by another layer formed by an α-helix with loops flanking it (Fig. 2B). The layers are united by two disulfide bonds between cysteine residues 16–35 and 24–45, forming an α/β barrel (Fig. 2B). Another disulfide bond between Cys-33 and Cys-47 seems important for the stabilization of the β-sheet, because it bridges the N- and C-terminal ends of a β-hairpin segment formed by strands β2 and β3 and their connecting loop, termed loop L2 (Fig. 2B). Finally, the fourth disulfide bond between Cys-6 and Cys-50 bundles the N- and C-terminal segments of this protein (Fig. 2B). Several residues make close contacts with the disulfide bond-forming residues, thereby establishing the hydrophobic core. Tyr-28 is a key residue for maintaining structural integrity through its multiple interactions. It makes hydrophobic contacts on one face with the sulfur atom of Cys-47 and on the other face with the aliphatic side chain portions of Leu-27 and Arg-8 (Fig. 3). This contact presumably results in the unusually up-field chemical shift of the Hγ resonance of Leu-27 (0.60 ppm) due to a ring current shift caused by the aromatic ring of Tyr-28. Another contribution to the protein core was made by the side chain of Thr-34, whose hydroxyl oxygen accepts a hydrogen bond from the main chain amide group of Cys-35 (Fig. 3). Two segments connecting the helix to the sheet display distinct structural features. The N-terminal flanking segment of the helix connects it to stand β1 through a type II β-turn at Gly-14 to Thr-17 (Fig. 2B). This is characterized by positive ϕ and ψ angles of Gly-14 and Cys-16 (ϕ = 100° ± 4° and ψ = 52° ± 7° for Gly-14, whereas ϕ = 52° ± 2° and ψ = 55° ± 5° for Cys-16, calculated from the final 30 lowest energy structures). The presence of Gly-14 and the disulfide bond between Cys-16 and Cys-35 are both probably indispensable for the formation of a stable type II β-turn at this position. In contrast, the C-terminal flanking segment of the helix (residues 29–32), and described as loop L1, contains no regular secondary structure. This loop bulges out from the body of the protein and creates a lobe on the protein surface (Figs. 2 and 3). Loop L2 resides at the opposite surface from loop L1, connecting strands β2 and β3 (Fig. 2). Structure of Allelic SP11s—Residues important for maintaining the structural integrity of S 8-SP11 are highly conserved among the allelic SP-11s of various S-haplotypes. Eight cysteines at positions 6, 16, 24, 33, 35, 45, 47, and 50 are mostly invariant throughout the SP11s. An aromatic residue is well conserved at S 8-SP11 Tyr-28, which contributes to the hydrophobic core of the protein by mainly associating with disulfide bond-forming residues. Gly-14 is totally conserved in the allelic SP11s, which enables the formation of a type II β-turn at residues 14–17 of S 8-SP11. These observations suggest that the allelic SP11s maintain an overall similar structure. Assuming a similar overall structure, we performed homology modeling of SP11 of the various haplotypes using MODELLER (25Šali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10292) Google Scholar). Distance restraints derived from the coordinate of S 8-SP11 and energy minimization using CHARMM force field (28MacKerell A.D.J. Bashford D. Bellott R.L. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Evanseck J.D. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J. Guo H. Ha S. Joseph-McCarthy D. Kuchnir L. Kuczera K. Lau F.T.K. Mattos C. Michnick S. Ngo T. Nguyen D.T. Prodhom B. Reiher III, W.E. Roux B. Schlenkrich M.S.J.C. Stote R. Straub J. Watanabe M. Wiorkiewicz-Kuczera J. Yin D. Karplus M. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 3586-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (11420) Google Scholar) were implemented for the modeling. Superimposed models display similar global folds to S 8-SP11, except for loop L1 that connects the helix and strand β2 (Fig. 4B). This loop contains a high degree of insertion and deletion among allelic SP11s. Hyper-variable Region and Conserved Exposed Hydrophobic Residues—The model structures of allelic SP11 indicate that sequences in loop L1 are more variable in length than in any other region, which we have designated as the hyper-variable (HV) region (Figs. 4 and 5B). Amino acids in the HV region tend to be rich in charge and, in particular, positive charge. Sandwiched by conserved aromatic and cysteine residues at positions 28 and 33 (using the S 8-SP11 numbering), the HV region bulges out from the top of the α/β barrel of the model structures, providing additional protein surfaces (Figs. 2B and 4B). Consistent with our model structures, the PHD secondary structure prediction server (29Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar) gave high scores of loop structures for the HV region of all known SP11s. Allelic SP11s of all haplotypes, except for S 48, possess a hydrophobic amino acid at either position 10 or 44, or both (S 8 numbering; Fig. 4A). Residues at these positions are located adjacent to each other at the protein surface opposite to the helix in the structure of S 8-SP11 and the model structures of other haplotypes (Fig. 6). Therefore, SP11 commonly possesses a hydrophobic patch at this position. Tyr-7 (S 8 numbering) of S 48-SP11 is also located at the protein surface opposite to the helix. Structure Comparison with a Plant Defensin—We searched for proteins whose folds were similar to that of S 8-SP11 using the DALI server (30Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that there is no previously determined structure with Z scores ≥ 2.0, suggesting that S 8-SP11 is like no other structure in the data base. A defensin family protein, Rs-AFP1, gave the highest Z scores of 1.8. Despite the low DALI Z scores, the global fold of S 8-SP11 is similar to those of defensins. The structures of three plant defensins, Rs-AFP1, γ1P-thionins, and γ1H-thionins, have thus far been determined, all of which have an identical disulfide bond topology to that of S 8-SP11 (31Bruix M. Jimenez M.A. Santoro J. Gonzalez C. Colilla F.J. Mendez E. Rico M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 32Fant F. Vranken W. Broekaert W. Borremans F. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Fig. 5A compares the structure of Rs-AFP1 with that of S 8-SP11. The fold of Rs-AFP1 shows similarity to that of S 8-SP11, where both are composed of a three-stranded anti-parallel β sheet and an α helix. Topology of the secondary structure elements and paring of the β-strands are identical (Fig. 4B). The r.m.s.d. between S 8-SP11 and Rs-AFP1 (Protein Data Bank code: 1ayj) is 1.86 Å over 18 Cα coordinates for residues in the regions of secondary structure elements (S 8-SP11 residues 12, 13, 35, 36, 42–45, and 18–27). In contrast to the aforementioned similarities, the position of one of the disulfide bonds in relation to the secondary structure elements is different. In Rs-AFP1, the bond between the fourth and seventh cysteine residues (Cys-25 and Cys-47) links the C-terminal segments of the unique α helix and strand β3, establishing the close association between the helix and the strand (Fig. 5B). In S 8-SP11, the corresponding disulfide bond is formed between Cys-33 and Cys-47, and facilitates the association of the ends of a β hairpin comprising β2-L2-β3. The sulfur atoms in the bond make hydrophobic contacts with the aromatic ring of Tyr-28, bringing the C terminus of the α helix near the terminus of the β hairpin (Fig. 3). Consequently, the association of the helix and strands β2 and β3 are established through the hydrophobic and disulfide bond linkages. This feature is unique to S 8-SP11 and is not observed in defensins (Fig. 5B). The high conservation of aromatic residues at position 28 in the allelic SP11s suggests that the hydrophobic and disulfide bond linkage are conserved throughout the allelic SP11s. In contrast, no aromatic amino acid is found at the corresponding position in defensin sequences, indicating the absence of such a hydrophobic and disulfide bond linkage. Thus, the presence of an aromatic residue at position 28, together with the position of the fourth cysteine (for S 8-SP11, Cys-33), could be regarded as a fingerprint of SP11s, providing a means of distinguishing SP11-type peptides from defensins. Notably, these fingerprint residues are observed in SP11 peptides from Arabidopsis lyrata (33Kusaba M. Dwyer K. Hendershot J. Vrebalov J. Nasrallah J.B. Nasrallah M.E. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In contrast, the sequence of PCP-A1, a 55-residue peptide containing eight cysteines, does not display such features. Consistent with the aforementioned discussion, the PCP-A1 gene has been shown to be non-SI, although the peptide product is a member of the pollen coat proteins that interact with SLG (34Doughty J. Dixon S. Hiscock S.J. Willis A.C. Parkin I.A. Dickinson H.G. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1333-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Hyper-variable Region—Structure-based sequence alignment of all haplotype allelic SP11s resulted in the identification of the HV region. The flanking residues of the HV region of S 8-SP11, Tyr-28 and Cys-33, are tightly packed to each other through the hydrophobic contacts between the side chain of Tyr-28 and the disulfide bond between Cys-33 and Cys-47, which form part of the protein core (Fig. 3). It seems that the protein core is resistant to structural change around the HV region owing to the close association of these residues surrounding HV region. These residues are highly conserved throughout the SP11 peptides, suggesting that this structural feature is conserved throughout the allelic SP11s. Therefore, it is attractive to speculate that the stabilization of these residues could allow the HV region in allelic SP11s to adopt various lengths. In contrast, the tight association of the N-terminal segment of the second β strand with the α helix is not observed in the Rs-AFP1 structure. The loop connecting these secondary structure elements of Rs-AFP1, which corresponds to the HV region of S 8-SP11, displays less length variability than SP11 (35Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68351) Google Scholar). The stabilization of the flanking residues of the HV region is reminiscent of the H3 loop in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of immunoglobulins. Like the HV region of SP11s, CDRs display high degrees of variation in length and sequence, with lengths ranging from 3 to 25 residues. 3A. C. R. Martin, www.bioinf.org.uk. This length variation is thought to be facilitated through the stabilization of CDR flanking segments through disulfide bonds or hydrophobic interactions mediated by conserved cysteine or tryptophan residues. Interestingly, both SP11 and immunoglobulins are involved in self/non-self recognition, where CDR H3 plays an important role in the recognition of antigens by immunoglobulins (37Segal D.M. Padlan E.A. Cohen G.H. Rudikoff S. Potter M. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4298-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 38Sharon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4814-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The allele-specific discrimination of SP11 by the stigma receptor is quite stringent. S 8-SP11 binds to the stigma membrane of the same haplotype with a Kd value of 0.7 nm, whereas no meaningful binding was observed for the non-cognate receptors. Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that such a large difference between homo- and hetero-allelic SP11-receptor interactions would be conferred by the structural variation of SP11. Thus, we speculate that the HV region of SP11s could serve as a binding interface with the stigma receptor, SRK. This region consists mainly of hydrophobic and charged residues, which have been often observed in protein-protein interfaces (39Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar, 40Xu D. Lin S.L. Nussinov R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 68-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The HV region of S 8-SP11 is the shortest among all the known SP11s, which contributes a protein surface area of 470 Å2. Data base analysis has shown that the average interfacial buried surface for protein-protein interactions is 1600 ± 400 Å2 (41Conte L.L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). The area of the interaction surface stemming from the HV region of S 8-SP11 is probably too small to confer the high affinity observed with the stigma receptor. Therefore, it is assumed that the protein surface outside of the HV region could function as an additional interface. A possible candidate site for this could be a surface-exposed hydrophobic residue at either position 10 or 44, which may serve as an allele-nonspecific interaction with the receptor, because it would create a conserved hydrophobic patch at a similar position on the protein surface (see “Results”). We suggest the possibility that this conserved hydrophobic surface patch, in combination with the HV region, forms the interfacial surface that confers the efficient and specific binding with the stigma receptor. Future experiments are needed to address this issue. In the present study, we have determined the solution structure of S 8-SP11. The overall structure of S 8-SP11 is similar to that of the defensins except for loop 1. Homology modeling of allelic SP11 and structure-based alignment identified this loop as a hyper-variable (HV) region in allelic SP11s. The presence of the HV region probably results from the disulfide bond between cysteines 33 and 47 and tyrosine 28, which are conserved among all the allelic SP11 S-haplotypes. Thus, the presence of these residues is regarded as a characteristic feature and may be used to distinguish SP11s from other eight cysteine-containing peptides such as defensins and PCP-A1. Residues in the HV region are likely to be responsible for imparting the allele-specific interaction with receptors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first structure determination of known ligands for a large family of serine/threonine receptor kinases in plants, which were recently identified through genome analyses (14Shiu, S. H., and Bleecker, A. B. (2001) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/113/re22.Google Scholar). Thus, the present structure determination may provide a molecular basis for our understanding and search for new protein ligands of these receptors."

The lipopolysaccharide headgroups are cross-linked by divalent cations, thereby providing an impermeable network for hydrophilic solutes and protecting the cell from damaging agents such as bile salts, lipases, and proteases. Uptake of nutrients or secretion of proteins through this barrier is accomplished by several channel forming proteins called porins (1Nikaido H. Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With a lack of other carbohydrate sources, the entry of maltodextrins has been optimized by the bacteria through the specific channel maltoporin, also called LamB (2Luckey M. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 3Nikaido H. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 4Boos W. Shuman H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 204-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high resolution x-ray structure of maltoporin has been solved to 3.1 Å (5Schirmer T. Keller T.A. Wang Y.F. Rosenbusch J.P. Science. 1995; 267: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The protein forms a homotrimer presenting three water-filled channels. A monomer consists of an 18-stranded antiparallel β-barrel embedded in the membrane, with large extracellular loops and short turns at the periplasmic side. The third loop, L3, folds inside the pore, contributing to a considerable constriction at the middle of the channel formed by the residue Tyr118. Interestingly, a line of six aromatic residues composed by Trp74* of an adjacent subunit, Tyr41, Tyr6, Trp420, Trp358, and Phe227, called the “greasy slide,” extends from the entrance vestibule to the periplasmic outlet (see Fig. 1A) and follows the left-handed helical shape of the longer maltodextrins, conferring a screw-like character to the translocation process. Crystal structures of maltodextrins bound to maltoporin reveal that the sugar molecule is oriented with its nonreducing end pointing toward the periplasmic exit of the pore (6Dutzler R. Wang Y.F. Rizkallah P.J. Rosenbusch J.P. Schirmer T. Structure. 1996; 4: 127-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 7Meyer J.E.W. Hofnung M. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 761-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The complex also reveals three glucosyl-binding subsites where the apolar pyranose rings are in van der Waals' interaction with the residues Tyr41, Tyr6, and Trp420 at the central part of the greasy slide, whereas the moieties at either end of the sugar curl away from the residues at the periphery (Trp74* at the vestibule and Trp358 and Phe227 at the periplasmic end). Simultaneously, sugar-hydroxyl groups are engaged in hydrogen bonds with two “polar tracks.” All of these interactions are supposed to provide a specific sugar translocation pathway. Specific binding of maltodextrins increases the local concentration inside the channel and thus facilitates translocation at low substrates concentrations. Maltoporin has been extensively studied using the black lipid membrane technique. The maltoporin proteins are incorporated into planar lipid bilayers and characterized by their conductance (8Schindler G. Rosenbusch J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3751-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 9Benz R. Schmid A. Vos-Sheperkeuter G.H. J. Membr.

Biophys. Chem. 2000; 85: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Based on the observation that sugar addition reduces channel conductance in a concentration-dependent manner, conductance measurements can be used as a probe to reveal the thermodynamic parameter of the sugar binding. Information about the rate constants of sugar translocation can be obtained using the spectral analysis of the ion current fluctuations (10Winterhalter M. Colloids Surf. 1999; 149: 547-551Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Van Gelder P. Dumas F. Winterhalter M. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 85: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Nekolla S.

Physiol. 1995; 105: 385-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In previous studies conducted on a large ensemble of porins, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to probe the functional role of the greasy slide (14Hilty C. Winterhalter M. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2001; 86: 5624-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Van Gelder P. Dumas F. Bartoldus I. Saint N. Prilipov A. Winterhalter M. Wang Y. Philippsen A. Rosenbusch J.P. Schirmer T. J.

J. 2002; 83: 309-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The mutations affecting the aromatic residues at the channel center considerably reduces the stability constants as suggested by the crystallographic data. The effect of the mutation is less pronounced for residues located at either end of the slide (W74*A, W358A and F227A) but demonstrates that they are also involved in the facilitated substrate transport through maltoporin channels. Recent conductance measurements performed on single maltoporin trimers show that the temporary binding of a maltodextrin molecule inside the channel can be observed as ion current fluctuation as penetrating sugar molecules constrain the passage of ions (17Bezrukov S.M. Kullman L. Winterhalter M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Kullman L. Winterhalter M. Bezrukov S.M. Biophys.

J. 2003; 84: 2990-2998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Reconstitution experiments at the single-channel level allowed unambiguous exploration of the directional properties of maltoporin channels. These studies clearly showed that the channel is highly asymmetric with respect to the sugar entrance side and applied voltages and revealed that the maltoporin insertion in artificial membranes is always unidirectional (17Bezrukov S.M. Kullman L. Winterhalter M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Kullman L. Winterhalter M. Bezrukov S.M. Biophys.

J. 2003; 84: 2990-2998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the real orientation of maltoporin remained an open question. In multichannel reconstitution experiments, the direction of maltoporin incorporation has been a matter of debate. Based on the binding asymmetry of a pseudooligosaccharide modified at its nonreducing end (20Brunkhorst C. Andersen C. Schneider C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2612-2619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), on mutants deleted in the large extracellular loops, and on asymmetrical pH-induced closure of the channel proteins, Benz and co-workers (21Andersen C. Schiffler B. Charbit A. Benz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41318-41325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Andersen C. Bachmeyer C. Täuber H. Benz R. Wang J. Michel V. Newton S.M.C. Hofnung M. Charbit A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) propose that maltoporin preferentially inserts with the short periplasmic turns moving through the membrane. In contrast, Van Gelder et al. (23Van Gelder P. Dumas F. Rosenbusch J.P. Winterhalter M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) used bacteriophage-λ and observed the opposite orientation. In the present study, we address the question of maltoporin orientation at the single channel level. First we investigate the influence of the mutations W74A at the extracellular vestibule and F227A at the periplasmic exit on the kinetics of maltohexaose binding. A second method to probe the orientation is based on the obvious asymmetric binding process of maltodextrin to maltoporin requiring an orientated penetration. We synthesized an ANDS 1The abbreviations used are: ANDS, 3-amino-naphtalene-2,7-disulfonic acid; M6-ANDS, ANDS-maltoheptaose derivative.1The abbreviations used are: ANDS, 3-amino-naphtalene-2,7-disulfonic acid; M6-ANDS, ANDS-maltoheptaose derivative.-maltoheptaose derivative (noted M6-ANDS in the following), a maltohexaose analogue with a bulky ANDS cap at its reducing end (see Fig. 1B). This modification prevents sugar molecules from penetrating the channel with the reducing end. The knowledge of maltoporin orientation associated with the functional role of the outermost residues of the greasy slide allowed us for the first time to provide a quantitative description of carbohydrates transport involving an asymmetric energy profile for a sugar molecule permeating the channel. Preparation and Characterization of M6-ANDS—Maltoheptaose was purchased from Senn Chemicals (Basel, Switzerland), and ANDS was from Interchim (Paris, France). 60 mg of maltoheptaose (around 50 μmol) were labeled as a result of reductive amination by the adding of 250 μl of 0.2 m ANDS in 15% acetic acid and the same volume of NaBH3CN 1 m in tetrahydrofuran. The reaction was incubated for 3 h at 55 °C. The choice of ANDS-maltodextrin cap to probe maltoporin orientation was motivated by the fact that synthesis and characterization of ANDS-oligosaccharide derivatives have already been described (24Chiesa C. Horvàth C. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 645: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Maltoheptaose ANDS-derivative, called here M6-ANDS (see Fig. 1B), was first analyzed by capillary electrophoresis, and the major peak of M6-ANDS was identified. Characterization of this peak was performed by capillary electrophoresis coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry under the conditions described below. The negative mass spectrum obtained was dominated by peaks at m/z 1438 and 718.9 assigned to single and doubly charged deprotonated molecular ions (M – H)– and (M – 2H)2– of M6-ANDS. Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectroscopy analyses were carried out on a CE system P/ACE™ MDQ (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) with a 75-μm × 80-cm fused silica capillary. The outlet of the capillary was integrated into the ESI spray needle that was directly coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometry system (LCQ™ DUO; Thermofinnigan, Inc.). The separations were monitored with a Beckman laser-induced fluorescence detection system using a 4 mW argon ion laser with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission filter of 520 nm. During analysis, the temperature was maintained constant (25 °C) along the capillary, and a voltage of 4 kV was applied at the outlet end of this capillary. The sheath liquid (water/isopropanol, 20/80, v/v) at the rate of 5 μl/min and the sheath gas (nitrogen, 20 units) were infused coaxially to the CE capillary. For measurements, the negative mode was used, and all of the data were collected on X Calibur software (see Ref. 25Monsarrat B. Brando T. Coudouret P. Nigou J. Puzo G. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar for details). Planar Lipid Bilayer Experiments—Planar lipid bilayers have been prepared of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.) according to the technique of Montal and Mueller (26Montal M. Mueller P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3561-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). They are formed across a 60-μm-diameter hole in a 25-μm-thick Teflon film (Goodfellow, Cambridge, UK) being sandwiched between two Delrine chambers, each containing 2 ml of an aqueous solution (1 m KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Tris buffered to pH 7.4). The whole set-up was shielded from external electromagnetic fields as well as from vibrations to minimize extra noise from other sources. The Delrine cell was enclosed in a double isolated Faraday cage connected with the signal ground and also with a homemade acoustically isolating closet placed on a piezo-electric vibration isolating table (model “Elite 3”; Newport Corp., Irvine, CA). The quality of the bilayer membranes was checked by capacitance and residual conductance measurements. The capacitance of the whole system proved to be about 150 picofarads. The residual membrane conductance (less than 7 picosiemens) was subtracted from the overall conductance. The apparatus had been connected with the external circuit through a pair of homemade Ag/AgCl electrodes encased in 200-μl pipette tips filled with 5% agarose soaked with 1 m KCl during the fabrication process. The electrode on the so called cis-side of the measuring cell was grounded, whereas the other (on trans) was connected with the head stage of an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) in the voltage clamp mode. The mutagenesis and purification of maltoporin have previously been described in detail (15Van Gelder P. Dumas F. Bartoldus I. Saint N. Prilipov A. Winterhalter M. Wang Y. Philippsen A. Rosenbusch J.P. Schirmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2994-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Small amounts of wild type maltoporin from a 0.1 μg/ml buffer solution with 1% octyl-POE detergent (Alexis, Lauchringen, Switzerland) were injected into the cis-side compartment. Incorporation of maltoporin into the bilayer was promoted by applying a transmembrane voltage of 100–200 mV to tentatively disturb the membrane and by stirring for a few seconds after addition. We have optimized the protocol to observe single porin insertion in less than 10 min and to inhibit further insertion. A single maltoporin molecule in the bilayer could be kept stable for several hours without any significant change of its physical properties. The concentration of maltohexaose (Senn Chemicals) was adjusted by adding appropriate small amounts of a concentrated stock solution. The exact sugar concentration was then determined by means of optical polarization measurements (Perkin-Elmer 241). After sugar addition the aqueous solution was homogenized by stirring during a few seconds. Then signals were recorded 20 min later. Titrations for the whole range of applied voltages were carried out with the same maltoporin molecule to avoid possible divergences between different individual single protein molecules. All of the measurements were performed at room temperature. The applied transmembrane voltage refers to the potential on the cis-side relative to the trans-side. The data were filtered with the low pass Bessel filter of the amplifier at 2–5 kHz and then monitored with a Lecroy (Geneva, Switzerland) LT342 digital storage oscilloscope. The entire experiment was recorded on video tape with a digital type recorder (DTR-1204; Biologic, Claix, France). The average power spectrum of the current noise was recorded using the fast Fourier transform module of the oscilloscope. To overcome the additional noise sources mentioned above, the background spectrum of the membrane without sugar was subtracted from each individual spectrum. The curve fitting was carried out using the Marquart-Levenberg method. The total current recording was transferred to a personal computer via a GPIB card using the graphical program LabVIEW 4.01 from National Instruments. Statistical analysis of the blockade events was performed by means of the BioPatch Analysis (Science Instruments) and homemade software. Derivation of the Individual Rate Constants of Sugar Binding—The binding of carbohydrates to the maltoporin channels was assumed for a long time to be symmetric (9Benz R. Schmid A. Vos-Sheperkeuter G.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 100: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 12Nekolla S. Andersen C. Benz R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1388-1397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), so that once a sugar molecule is bound inside the pore it would have equal probability to translocate or to exit to the same side. Only recent measurements performed on individual maltoporin trimers demonstrated that the association rate is 3–5-fold different depending on the sugar entrance side (18Kullman L. Winterhalter M. Bezrukov S.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 803-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 19Schwarz G. Danelon C. Winterhalter M. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2990-2998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The reaction for maltodextrin (M) binding has been proposed to be of first order. The internal binding site, P, is accessible from either side of the membrane (cis as well as trans). A bound substrate molecule, PM, closes the channel to ion current. The related reaction scheme is written as follows, P+Mcis⇄koffciskoncisPM⇄kontranskofftransP+MtransReactionIREACTION 1 where koncis and kontrans refer to the association rate constants for a sugar molecule entering the channel from the cis- and the trans-sides, respectively; and koffcis and kofftrans stand for the dissociation rate constants of a sugar molecule exiting from the binding site, respectively, to the cis- and the trans-sides. The two respective pairs of on-off rate constants associated with the cis- and trans-sides are related to the single thermodynamic equilibrium constant, K, according to the detailed balance principle. K=koncis/koffcis=kontrans/kofftrans(Eq. 1) The on rate constants koncis and kontrans can individually be found out from the respective simple cases where sugar is only added to the cis-side or the trans-side of the channel. We cannot directly access the off rate constants koffcis and kofftrans from the current fluctuation measurements because they are not distinguishable. Nevertheless, they can easily be derived from the apparent koff=koffcis+kofftrans and Equation 1. The relaxation time constant of the binding process, τ, that modulates the ion current depends on the rate constants and sugar concentration, [M], as follows. τ-1=2πfc=koncis·[M]cis+kontrans·[M]trans+koffcis+kofftrans(Eq. 2) The parameter f c can be determined by fitting the power spectral density of the sugar-induced ion fluctuations with the Lorentzian form (12Nekolla S. Andersen C. Benz R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1388-1397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), S(f)=S0/(1+(f/fc)2)(Eq. 3) where S 0 is the plateau power density at frequencies f ≪ f c, and f c is the corner frequency at S(f) = S 0/2. Effect of the Mutations W74A and F227A on Ion Conduction—As seen in Fig. 1A, the residue Trp74 is located at the entrance, and Phe227 is located at the periplasmic exit, and both were changed into alanine. To study the influence of these mutations on the directional insertion of maltoporin channels, we first recorded the ion current through single mutant W74A at different applied voltages and calculated the corresponding conductance values. In a second series of measurements, we repeated the recording with the F227A mutant. The results of both recordings are shown in Fig. 2. We observe that the conductance of the wild type and mutated channels increases with the applied voltage and depends on the sign of the external potential. Repeated recordings on porin insertion revealed in all the cases (more than 200 attempts for the wild type maltoporin and more than 50 attempts for each mutated proteins) an orientation having the high conductance under smaller potentials on the side of channel addition, i.e. at negative voltages according to our sign convention. At ±190 mV, the asymmetry is 14% for both mutant channels. It is noteworthy that larger conductance at negative voltages has been obtained for all insertions independently on the sign of the potential applied during channel incorporation. However, it depends on the side of protein addition. Conductance of the mutated channels is slightly higher than the wild type maltoporin. Apparently the mutagenesis did not modify the asymmetry in ion conduction, suggesting that the mutations W74A and F227A do not affect the unidirectional insertion of the maltoporin channels into artificial membranes. Effect of the Mutations W74A and F227A on Maltodextrin Binding—After showing the directional incorporation through the asymmetry in conductance, we titrated maltohexaose molecules on one side only to probe the orientation of reconstituted maltoporin channels. Typical current recordings obtained from single wild type, W74A, and F227A maltoporin channels in the presence of one-side addition of maltohexaose are shown in A, B, and C of Fig. 3, respectively. We observed transient blockade events whatever the side of sugar addition was. Kinetic analysis shows that the power spectral density of the fluctuations in the current through individual maltoporin mutants have a Lorentzian form (Fig. 4). Similar behavior has already been reported for the wild type maltoporin channels (17Bezrukov S.M. Kullman L. Winterhalter M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The rate constants governing the open-close sequences experienced by a given channel can then be determined using Equation 2 by means of a linear plot of the reciprocal relaxation times versus maltohexaose concentrations. The on and off rate constants are reported in Table I. The first observation is that the apparent dissociation rate constant does not depend on the side of sugar addition. The mutation W74A leads to an increase of the off rate comparing with the wild type channels, whereas a significant decrease is found for the modification F227A. This result is directly related to the longer average sugar residence time in F227A channels as observed in Fig. 3. At +150 mV, maltohexaose stays 1.1, 0.7, and 1.7 ms on average inside wild type, W74A, and F227A maltoporin channels, respectively. The second observation is that the mutation W74A introduces a pronounced on rate asymmetry with the side of sugar addition, whereas the asymmetry tends to be reduced in F227A. koncis is smaller than kontrans by factors of 9.4 and 2.3 for W74A and F227A channels, respectively. A comparison of the on rate constants with wild type maltoporin channels reveals a higher contribution of Trp74 than Phe227. The replacement F227A displays a small reduction of the on rate at the trans-side, whereas a small increase is observed at the cis-side. Mutant W74A shows a major reduction of the on rate constant at the cis-side compared with wild type by a factor of 3.9 at +150 mV.Fig. 4Spectral analysis of maltohexaose-induced fluctuations in the current. The power spectral densities of the current noise through W74A channels (A) and F227A channels (B) show a single Lorentzian form, implying that sugar binding to W74A and F227A channels is still a simple two-state model with no memory effect. They also indicate that W74A channel is highly asymmetric with the side of sugar addition. The applied voltage was +150 mV, and the maltohexaose concentration was 60 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IApparent kinetic and thermodynamic constants for maltohexaose binding to wild type maltoporin and point mutants W74A and F227ASide of sugar additionWild typeW74AF227AkonkoffKkonkoffKkonkoffK×106m-1·s-1s-1m-1×106m-1·s-1s-1m-1×106m-1·s-1s-1m-1cis2.793528900.713005403.25505820trans9.3855108806.6168039307.260012000 Open table in a new tab The kinetics of maltohexaose binding through wild type maltoporin channels has been shown to be sensitive to the external voltage with higher influence on the apparent dissociation rate of bound substrates (17Bezrukov S.M. Kullman L. Winterhalter M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Kullman L. Winterhalter M. Bezrukov S.M. Biophys.

J. 2003; 84: 2990-2998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This binding property has been also used to detect the directional insertion of wild type maltoporin. We studied whether the mutations W74A and F227A influence this voltage dependence by determining the individual off rate constants, koffcis and kofftrans, at ±75 and ±150 mV from one-sided sugar addition experiments (see “Materials and Methods”). The results are presented in Fig. 5. Elementary dissociation rate constants of maltohexaose binding to wild type and mutated channels exhibit the same voltage dependence. Off rates are always higher at negative voltages. This voltage-induced asymmetry is more pronounced at high applied potentials and predominantly concerns kofftrans. About 50–60% difference in kofftrans is seen at –150 mV versus +150 mV for all three channels studied. Asymmetrical Addition of M6-ANDS—In a second series of measurements we probe the orientation using an asymmetric substrate. Covalent linkage of a bulky ANDS substituent at the reducing end of maltooligosaccharides strongly increases the inherent asymmetry of substrates. The mechanism of M6-ANDS transport through maltoporin channels was investigated at the single protein level by reconstituting one wild type maltoporin trimer into lipid bilayers. Further evidence of the asymmetry of the channel is observed after one-sided sugar addition (18Kullman L. Winterhalter M. Bezrukov S.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 803-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 19Schwarz G. Danelon C. Winterhalter M. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2990-2998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Typical recordings of maltohexaose-mediated current fluctuations are shown in Fig. 3A. It is interesting to note that the natural substrate closes the channels independently of which side it enters. In clear contrast to maltohexaose, Fig. 6A shows that one-sided addition of M6-ANDS generates conductance interruptions by multiples of one-third of the initial value only for substrate molecules entering from the cis- side, i.e. the side of maltoporin addition. On the other hand, no modification occurs in the current through maltoporin channels when M6-ANDS is added to the trans-side of the membrane. When maltoporin is injected to the trans-side, open channel conductance asymmetry is inverted, and the side of M6-ANDS addition that generates blockade events becomes the trans-side (data not shown). Importantly, the side of blockade events is independent of the sign of the external voltage, demonstrating that the introduction of two negative charges on the substrate molecule is not at the origin of the directional binding. Interestingly, the averaged residence time of a bound maltohexaose molecule, τr, is 1.1 ms, whereas M6-ANDS closes channels for about 5.0 ms. We verified that the presence of M6-ANDS to either side of the membrane does not modify channel permeability for natural substrate"
https://openalex.org/W2052878767,"Density-enhanced protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1 (DEP-1 also CD148) is a transmembrane molecule with a single intracellular PTP domain. It has recently been proposed to function as a tumor suppressor. We have previously shown that DEP-1 dephosphorylates the activated platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) beta-receptor in a site-selective manner (Kovalenko et al. (2000). J. Biol. Chem. 275, 16219-16226). We analysed cell lines with inducible DEP-1 expression for cellular functions of DEP-1. Several aspects of PDGFbeta-receptor signaling were negatively affected by DEP-1 expression. These include PDGF-stimulated activation of inositol trisphosphate formation, Erk1/2, p21Ras, and Src. Activation of receptor-associated phosphoinositide-3 kinase activity and of Akt/PKB were weakly attenuated at early time points of stimulation. Inhibition of PDGF-stimulated signaling depended on DEP-1 catalytic activity. Importantly, DEP-1 inhibited PDGF-stimulated cell migration. The catalytically inactive DEP-1 C1239S variant enhanced cell migration and PDGF-stimulated Erk1/2 activation, suggesting a dominant negative interference with endogenous DEP-1. In contrast to cell migration, cell-substrate adhesion was promoted by active DEP-1 and delayed or suppressed by DEP-1 C1239S, correlating with positive effects of DEP-1 on adhesion-stimulated Src kinase. We propose that negative regulation of growth-factor stimulated cell migration and promotion of cell-matrix adhesion may be related to the function of DEP-1 as tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W2042712875,"Based on the now available crystallographic data of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) prototype rhodopsin, many studies have been undertaken to build or verify models of other GPCRs. Here, we mined evolution as an additional source of structural information that may guide GPCR model generation as well as mutagenesis studies. The sequence information of 61 cloned orthologs of a P2Y-like receptor (GPR34) enabled us to identify motifs and residues that are important for maintaining the receptor function. The sequence data were compared with available sequences of 77 rhodopsin orthologs. Under a negative selection mode, only 17% of amino acid residues were preserved during 450 million years of GPR34 evolution. On the contrary, in rhodopsin evolution ∼43% residues were absolutely conserved between fish and mammals. Despite major differences in their structural conservation, a comparison of structural data suggests that the global arrangement of the transmembrane core of GPR34 orthologs is similar to rhodopsin. The evolutionary approach was further applied to functionally analyze the relevance of common scaffold residues and motifs found in most of the rhodopsin-like GPCRs. Our analysis indicates that, in contrast to other GPCRs, maintaining the unique function of rhodopsin requires a more stringent network of relevant intramolecular constrains. Based on the now available crystallographic data of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) prototype rhodopsin, many studies have been undertaken to build or verify models of other GPCRs. Here, we mined evolution as an additional source of structural information that may guide GPCR model generation as well as mutagenesis studies. The sequence information of 61 cloned orthologs of a P2Y-like receptor (GPR34) enabled us to identify motifs and residues that are important for maintaining the receptor function. The sequence data were compared with available sequences of 77 rhodopsin orthologs. Under a negative selection mode, only 17% of amino acid residues were preserved during 450 million years of GPR34 evolution. On the contrary, in rhodopsin evolution ∼43% residues were absolutely conserved between fish and mammals. Despite major differences in their structural conservation, a comparison of structural data suggests that the global arrangement of the transmembrane core of GPR34 orthologs is similar to rhodopsin. The evolutionary approach was further applied to functionally analyze the relevance of common scaffold residues and motifs found in most of the rhodopsin-like GPCRs. Our analysis indicates that, in contrast to other GPCRs, maintaining the unique function of rhodopsin requires a more stringent network of relevant intramolecular constrains. Among the different families of transmembrane receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; dN, non-synonymous substitution; dS, synonymous substitution; EL, extracellular loop; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IL, intracellular loop; IP, inositol phosphate; TMD, transmembrane domain.1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; dN, non-synonymous substitution; dS, synonymous substitution; EL, extracellular loop; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IL, intracellular loop; IP, inositol phosphate; TMD, transmembrane domain. form the largest superfamily. Molecular cloning studies and genome data analyses have revealed ∼1200–1300 members of the GPCR superfamily in mammalian genomes (1Schöneberg T. Schulz A. Gudermann T. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 143-227PubMed Google Scholar). To predict and understand ligand binding and signal transduction as well as the consequences of structural changes (e.g. disease-causing mutations) within a receptor molecule, detailed information about the native receptor structure in its inactive and active conformations is required. Currently, a high-resolution structure is available only for bovine rhodopsin (2Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4992) Google Scholar), which now provides the basis to generate models of other GPCRs (3Vaidehi N. Floriano W.B. Trabanino R. Hall S.E. Freddolino P. Choi E.J. Zamanakos G. Goddard III, W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12622-12627Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, recent studies point out that even with a crystal structure in hand, construction of reliable receptor models still requires time-consuming refinements based on data from mutagenesis, cross-linking, and NMR studies (4Archer E. Maigret B. Escrieut C. Pradayrol L. Fourmy D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 36-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Herein, we mined evolution as an additional source of structural information that may direct GPCR modeling and mutagenesis studies. This idea has been successfully applied in an early stage of GPCR structure/function analysis. The sequences of >200 different members of the GPCR family were used to predict the approximate arrangements of the seven transmembrane helices (5Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). To determine more distinct structural determinants that participate in ligand recognition and signal transduction, sequence analysis has to be focused on a single receptor subtype. The structural diversity of a given receptor among different species is the result of a long evolutionary process characterized by a continuous accumulation of mutations. However, the maintenance of vital functions in an organism strictly requires enough structural conservation to ensure the functionality of the receptor protein. Studying the structural diversity of a single GPCR will help to determine evolutionary preserved elements and may disclose the “spatial freedom” of each amino acid position.For a valid evolutionary analysis, the chosen GPCR should meet the following requirements. First, the GPCR should be “evolutionarily old” to allow for a broad structural variety during evolution. Second, GPCRs with structurally indistinguishable subtypes or pseudogenes should be avoided, because the interpretation of data will be more difficult. Third, the physiological agonist should not be a peptide or a protein because of problems in separating co-evolutionary processes. Fourth, the coding region of the GPCR gene should contain no or only small introns to allow for an easy amplification from genomic DNA.Among the GPCRs of family 1, only a few receptors meet these requirements. The group of ADP receptor-like GPCRs includes P2Y12, P2Y13, GPR105, GPR87, and GPR34. In an initial study we have shown that GPR34 is an evolutionarily old single-copy gene and has clear structural and functional features that allows its differentiation from other members of the group of ADP-like GPCRs (6Schöneberg T. Schulz A. Grosse R. Schade R. Henklein P. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, GPR34 was chosen to identify structural and functional determinants by an evolutionary approach. Our analysis includes 61 full-length or partial sequences of GPR34 and GPR34-like GPCRs that were cloned from 52 species, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, teleost fish, and sharks. This large set of sequence information enabled us to identify motifs and residues that are important for maintaining the receptor function. The sequence data were compared with sequences of 77 rhodopsin orthologs. Despite the fact that GPR34 orthologs and vertebrate rhodopsins share less than 7% identical amino acid residues, the gross global structure appears to have been maintained between both receptor groups as judged by analyzing the periodicity of conserved residues and hydrophobicity. During 450 million years of evolution, only 17% of all amino acid residues remained unchanged in GPR34 orthologs. In contrast, in rhodopsin evolution ∼43% of residues were absolutely conserved in fish and mammalian orthologs. This indicates that maintaining the unique function of rhodopsin requires a more stringent network of relevant determinants.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of GPR34-like and ADP-like Receptor Orthologs and Generation of GPR34 Mutants—To identify GPR34 sequence in other vertebrates, genomic DNA samples were prepared from tissue or peripheral mononuclear blood cells of various species or were kindly provided by several other labs (supplemental Table S1, available in the on-line version of this article). Tissue samples were digested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubated at 55 °C for 18 h. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Based on the sequence of the human, mouse, and carp GPR34 sequences (6Schöneberg T. Schulz A. Grosse R. Schade R. Henklein P. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), sets of degenerated primer pairs (supplemental Table S3, available in the on-line version of this article) were tested for their ability to amplify GPR34-specific sequences. Standard PCR reaction was performed with Taq polymerase under the following conditions (35 cycles): 1 min at 94 °C; 1 min at 56–62 °C; and 2 min at 72 °C. Specific fragments were directly sequenced and/or subcloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and at least three different clones were sequenced.For identification of complete GPR34 open reading frames, a 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) strategy was used. Thus, 1 μg of genomic DNA per reaction was digested with various blunt end cutting enzymes (EcoRV, HincII, MscI, and DraI; New England Biolabs). Then, an amidated oligonucleotide adapter (Marathon cDNA amplification kit, Clontech) was linked to the digested DNA. 5′- and 3′-RACE PCR reactions were performed with the AP1 primer (Clontech) and species-specific primers using the tagged genomic DNA as a template in the Expand™ high fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). PCR reactions were carried out under the following conditions (35 cycles): 1 min at 94 °C; 1 min at 62 °C; and 3 min at 68 °C. After treatment with Taq polymerase for 10 min at 72 °C, PCR products were subcloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector and sequenced with Thermo-Sequenase and dye-labeled terminator chemistry by an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).Comparison of the 5′-untranslated region of human and rodent GPR34 genes revealed high sequence similarity, allowing the use of a primer derived from the sequence upstream of the coding sequence for ortholog amplification from mammalian genomic DNA (see supplemental Table S3, available in the on-line version of this article). Thus, sequences encoding the N termini of GPR34 orthologs were identified from several mammals.Full-length GPR34 sequences were inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDps. GPR34 mutations (N137A and A265Y) were introduced into the hemagglutinin-tagged version of the human GPR34 (6Schöneberg T. Schulz A. Grosse R. Schade R. Henklein P. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) using a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis and restriction fragment replacement strategy. The identity of the various constructs and the correctness of all PCR-derived sequences were confirmed by restriction analysis and sequencing.Based on the mRNA sequence of the human P2Y12 (AF313449), primers were designed, and the coding region was amplified from genomic DNA. The product was subcloned into the eucaryotic expression vector pcDps and verified by sequencing.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Functional Assays—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 7% CO2 incubator. For transient transfection of COS-7 cells, a calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (7Hitt M. Bett A.J. Addison C.L. Prevec L. Graham F.L. Adolph K.W. Viral Gene Techniques. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995: 13-30Google Scholar) was applied. Thus, cells were split into 12-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) and transfected with a total amount of 5 μg of plasmid DNA per well. For cyclic AMP accumulation assays, cells were prelabeled with 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine (31.7 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) 48 h after transfection and incubated overnight. Then, transfected cells were washed once in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) followed by incubation with or without the indicated substances for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by aspiration of the medium and the addition of 1 ml of 5% trichloracetic acid. The cAMP content of cell extracts was determined after chromatography as described (8Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3368) Google Scholar).To measure inositol phosphate (IP) formation, transfected COS-7 cells were incubated with 2 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (18.6 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 18 h. Thereafter, cells were washed once with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm LiCl followed by incubation for1hat37 °C. Intracellular IP levels were determined by anion-exchange chromatography as described (9Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). To estimate cell surface expression of receptors carrying an N-terminal hemagglutinin tag, we used an indirect cellular enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (10Schöneberg T. Sandig V. Wess J. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Sequence Analyses and Model Generation—Nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments were made with Clustal X (11Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 4876-4882Crossref Scopus (35214) Google Scholar) and the PHYLIP software package (12Felsenstein J. PHYLIP: Phylogeny Inference Package, Version 3.6a2.1. Dept. of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle2001Google Scholar) with visual adjustments. The conservation of all positions in the receptor protein was determined using the algorithm and the PAM matrices implemented in the Clustal X software package. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the Neighbor-Joining method (13Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar), the PHYLIP software package (12Felsenstein J. PHYLIP: Phylogeny Inference Package, Version 3.6a2.1. Dept. of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle2001Google Scholar), and maximum likelihood analysis (14Yang Z. Nielsen R. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), and 1,000 bootstrap replications were conducted to evaluate the reliability of the trees. The PAML software package was used to estimate synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates in GPR34 and rhodopsin sequences (15Yang Z. Nielsen R. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). The primer-encoded regions as well as those sites that contain gaps in the alignment were not used in phylogenetic analyses.To visualize the position of conserved amino acid residues in a GPR34 receptor model, crystal structure data of the bovine rhodopsin (1L9H, molecule A) were taken as template. The homology modeling algorithms implemented in Deep View Swiss-PDB Viewer 3.7 (16Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9474) Google Scholar) was used to generate a rough model of the human GPR34. For refinement, the rough model was submitted to www.expasy.org/spdbv/. The final model was checked for clashes. For clarity, the model was generated to visualize the relative position of conserved GPR34 residues within the rhodopsin crystal structure and highlight molecule portions that are probably similar or different between rhodopsin and GPR34 receptors. Therefore, proline-induced distortions of helices in the rhodopsin molecules were kept in the receptor model.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONGPR34 Has Existed for More than 450 Million Years—A long phylogenetic history is a prerequisite to making structural changes during evolution significant. To address this point, we set out to identify GPR34 orthologs from all eight vertebrate classes. Degenerate primers derived from human, mouse, and carp GPR34 (6Schöneberg T. Schulz A. Grosse R. Schade R. Henklein P. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) were used to amplify partial GPR34 sequences from various vertebrate species including mammals, marsupials, monotremes, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and teleost and cartilage fish (sequences were deposited in GenBank™). As shown for selected GPR34 orthologs (Fig. 1; for all cloned orthologs and full-length receptors see supplemental Fig. S1, available in the on-line version of this article), analysis revealed the expected vertebrate ancestry. The largest variety of GPR34 sequences, including subtypes and intron-containing genes, were found in teleost fish (see below). We were also successful in cloning GPR34 orthologs from sharks, which are common ancestors of ray-finned fish and tetrapods. This indicates that GPR34 may have existed for at least 450 million years. All attempts to identify GPR34-like sequences in primitive chordate species such as lamprey and hagfish have failed so far, although primer pairs yielded partial sequences of other related GPCRs (data not shown). Similarly, sequence analyses of the known genomes of Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Anopheles gambiae (NCBI data base) as well as cloning attempts from other insects (Spodoptera frugiperda and Melolontha melolontha) revealed no GPR34-like sequences.Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that, in all tetrapod species investigated, GPR34 coding regions are obviously intronless and lack any subtypes in their genomes. This picture completely changed when phylogenetic analysis was extended to teleost fish. First, up to three structurally distinct GPR34 subtypes were identified in various fish species (e.g. carp) (Fig. 2A). Second, several fish species (e.g. tilapia) present a single intron in phase one (inserted after codon position one) within the coding region of EL2, which was identified by sequence comparison with other orthologs and intron/exon prediction tools.Fig. 2Phylogenetic diversity of GPR34 in fish. A, degenerated primers were designed to amplify genomic fragments encoding the sequence from TMD1 or TMD3 to TMD7. Most amplification attempts led to more than one GPR34-like ortholog. The open reading frame of several ortholog sequences was disrupted by a small intron sequence (subgroup 2). The resulting amino acid sequences between the relative codon positions 3.52 to 7.48 were aligned. The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed by using the Neighbor-Joining method (13Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar), and 1,000 bootstrap replications were conducted to evaluate the reliability of the tree. Bootstrap values >750 are shown on the tree branches. B, several fish species (cod, tilapia, platyfish, red perch, and salmon) presented a single intron within the coding region of EL2. The relative position within the coding sequence is conserved, and an almost identical splice acceptor site indicates a common evolutionary origin (shaded boxes). The intron size between species and receptor subtypes varies only marginally (for exact intron sizes see panel A).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sequence comparison, duplicated genes, and appearance/loss of introns provide a valid basis for unveiling the evolutionary history of a protein. Based on our genomic and amino acid sequence analyses, at least two subgroups of GPR34 sequences in teleost fish can be distinguished already in evolutionarily old teleost fish (Anguillidae and Cyprinidae). The first intronless receptor subgroup, which includes e.g. tilapia type 1 and GPR34 receptors from fugu and tetraodon (see Fig. 2A), displays some unique structural features such as a conserved Trp residue at the C-terminal end of IL2 (relative position 4.43) and a second Pro residue in TMD6 (relative position 6.56) (supplemental Fig. S2, available in the on-line version of this article). The second subgroup clusters intron-containing GPR34 genes. Some species present more than one ortholog of the second subgroup (cod and carp). This receptor divergence may be the result of an additional gene or even genome duplication. However, the proposed sub-grouping is probably restricted to the evolutionarily younger Acanthopteryii (e.g. fugu and tilapia) and cannot be applied to more ancient orders such as Anguillidae (eel), Cyprinidae (carp and zebrafish), and Siluridae (catfish). It is interesting to note that in some Acanthopteryii GPR34 is only a single-copy gene (fugu and tetraodon) as judged by PCR and data base search. Tetraodontidae are phylogenetically young, and it is therefore reasonable to assume that the second gene was lost again during evolution. Similarly, all attempts to amplify a second GPR34 subtype from two cartilaginous fish and two sturgeon species failed, indicating the existence of only one GPR34 ortholog at the very beginning of fish evolution. Low stringency genomic PCR yielded only a new and structurally distinguishable intermediate group of GPR34-like/ADP-like receptors (see Fig. 1).Another interesting marker of GPR34 evolution in fish is the presence of an intron in some orthologs (subgroup 2 in Fig. 2A). The consensus sequence flanking the introns is highly preserved (Fig. 2B). The intron size between species and receptor subtypes varies only marginally. The relative position within the coding sequence is conserved, and almost identical splice acceptor sites indicate a common evolutionary origin. No other obvious introns were found within the coding region between TMD1 and TMD7 as analyzed in cod GPR34 receptors. Gain and loss of spliceosomal introns in a lineage is a unique event that occurs at a specific point in its evolution. Two hypotheses to explain the origin of spliceosomal introns could be proposed. The “intron early” hypothesis would suggest that introns were ancient and were lost during evolution, whereas the “intron late” hypothesis would suggest that introns were inserted into the gene later in evolution (17de Souza S.J. Long M. Klein R.J. Roy S. Lin S. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5094-5099Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The obvious absence of introns in GPR34 genes in cartilaginous fish and evolutionarily old teleost fish (eel, carp, and zebrafish) and a relative uniform intron size suggest that the intron was an evolutionarily new invention after gene duplication. Additional support for an intron late introduction in GPR34 genes comes from the ADP receptor evolution. Some ADP receptors (fugu and tetraodon P2Y12) also contain a spliceosomal intron. 2K. Zierau, A. Schulz, and T. Schöneberg, unpublished results. However, the position within the coding region and the size are different, excluding a common ancestral origin of the introns found in GPR34 and ADP-like receptors.Taken together, the evolution of GPR34 probably started in the Cambrian period more than 450 million years ago as suggested by its presence in cartilaginous and ray-finned fish genomes. The evolutionary split between GPR34 and ADP-like receptors is already found in teleost fish, indicating their coexistence for at least 450 million years. Identification of a clear, distinguishable ADP-like receptor from cartilaginous fish may set this evolutionary point even earlier. Furthermore, our data suggest that a GPR34 gene duplication took place in early teleost fish evolution. Then, a single intron was introduced in one of the two GPR34 genes before the divergence of Acanthopteryii. GPR34 diversification was further increased by gene or genome duplication in some teleost fish species.GPR34 and ADP-like Receptors Have a Common Evolutionary Origin—While this study was being conducted, P2Y12 and P2Y13 receptors were cloned, and ADP was found to be the agonist for both receptors (18Hollopeter G. Jantzen H.M. Vincent D. Li G. England L. Ramakrishnan V. Yang R.B. Nurden P. Nurden A. Julius D. Conley P.B. Nature. 2001; 409: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 19Communi D.

A high overall amino acid sequence homology already implicated a common ancestral origin of GPR34- and ADP-like receptors (20Abbracchio M.P. Boeynaems J.M. Barnard E.A. Boyer J.L. Kennedy C. Miras-Portugal M.T. King B.F. Gachet C. Jacobson K.A. Weisman G.A. Burnstock G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 52-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 21Joost P. Methner A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 63Crossref Google Scholar). Further evidence for a close structural relation between GPR34- and ADP-like receptors came from our genomic PCR experiments. Using the same sets of degenerate primers, we amplified several other GPCR fragments from fish genomic DNA (carp, salmon, pike, zebrafish, sturgeon, dog, and shark), which are closely related to both the GPR34- and the ADP-like receptors. Comparative structural analyses revealed that two carp receptors (carp ADP-like type 1 and type 2; see Fig. 1) and one receptor from salmon and pike (not shown) were more closely related to ADP-like receptors, whereas zebrafish GPR34-like, sturgeon GPR34-like, and dog shark GPR34-like receptors combine structural features of GPR34 and ADP-like receptors, thus forming an intermediate subgroup (see Fig. 1).To support a common evolutionary origin of GPR34- and ADP-like receptors by functional data, we initiated studies to determine the signal transduction and agonist specificity of the GPR34 receptors. P2Y12 and P2Y13 are coupled to Gi/o proteins, which inhibit adenylyl cyclases and, therefore, decrease intracellular cAMP levels. According to the current model of GPCR function (22Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 603-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), receptor overexpression can result in a constitutive activation of signaling pathways. Thus, the coupling abilities of several receptors, including “orphan” receptors, have been characterized by overexpression in the absence of an agonist. For example, the wild-type ACCA, an orphan GPCR, stimulates the Gs/adenylyl cyclase system to some extent when expressed in COS-7 cells (23Eggerickx D. Denef J.F. Labbe O. Hayashi Y. Refetoff S. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Libert F. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that replacement of the four or five C-terminal amino acids of Gαq with the corresponding Gαi residues (referred to as Gαqi4) confers the ability to stimulate the PLC-β pathway onto Gi-coupled receptors (24Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). As expected, ADP stimulation (10 μm ADP) of P2Y12 and Gαqi4-transfected COS-7 cells resulted in a robust increase in intracellular IP levels (Fig. 3A). COS-7 cells co-transfected with GFP and Gαqi4 responded to ADP stimulation with only a 1.7-fold increase in IP levels because of endogenous ADP receptor expression. However, cells expressing the human GPR34 and Gαqi4 did not show an effect above the endogenous response following ADP application (see Fig. 3A). Interestingly, P2Y12 and human GPR34 displayed some degree of basal activities when compared with GFP-transfected cells. To verify the basal activation of the Gi pathway, we measured the inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP formation. Indeed, the forskolin-induced cAMP formation was significantly reduced in cells transfected with the human GPR34 (77.2 ± 8.8%), the murine GPR34 (72.7 ± 4.8%), and the human P2Y12 receptor (73.4 ± 5.5%) when compared with GFP-transfected COS-7 cells (100%).Fig. 3High basal activity is preserved among GPR34 receptors. To evaluate signaling specificity of GPR34 and ADP receptors, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with the indicated receptor construct and the chimeric Gα protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). IP assays were performed 72 h after transfection as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, plasmids encoding GFP (control), the human GPR34, and the human ADP receptor were co-transfected with Gαqi4. IP formation under basal conditions (light gray bars) and in the presence of 10 μm ADP (dark gray bars) was determined. Data are presented as means ± S.E. (cpm/well) of three independent experiments, each carried out in triplicate. B, to verify the constitutive activity of GPR34 and ADP receptors, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with the designated GPR34 ortholog constructs and the chimeric GαΔ6qi4myr plasmid (see “Experimental Procedures”). Basal IP formation is expressed as fold over basal levels of GFP-transfected cells (404 ± 167 cpm/well). Data are presented as means ± S.E. of three independent experiments, each carried out in triplicate.View Large Image Figure"

Leishmania donovani is a protozoan parasite that causes visceral leishmaniasis, a devastating and often fatal disease in humans. The parasite exhibits a digenetic life cycle; the extracellular, flagellated, and motile promastigote that resides within the insect vector, members of the phlebotomine sandfly family, and the intracellular, aflagellar, and nonmotile amastigote that exists within the phagolysosome of macrophages and other reticuloendothelial cells of the infected mammalian host. The drugs used to treat visceral leishmaniasis have been empirically derived and are toxic, require prolonged and multiple administrations, and are often ineffective. The toxicity can be ascribed to the lack of target specificity within the parasite. Thus, the need for more efficacious and specific drugs is acute. The design of selective antiparasitic drugs depends on the exploitation of fundamental biochemical differences between parasite and host. Perhaps the most remarkable metabolic discrepancy between protozoan parasites and their human host is that the former are incapable of synthesizing the purine ring de novo (1Carter N.S. Rager N. Ullman B. Marr J.J. Nilsen T. Komuniecki R. Molecular and Medical Parasitology. Academic Press, London2003: 197-223Google Scholar). Thus, all protozoan parasites studied to date have evolved a unique series of purine salvage enzymes that enable parasites to scavenge purines from their host. Purine acquisition by the parasite is initiated by the translocation of extracellular purines across the parasite cell surface membranes, a process that is mediated by nutritionally indispensable nucleoside and nucleobase transporters. Genetic and biochemical investigations (2Aronow B. Kaur K. McCartan K. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 22: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 3Iovannisci D.M. Kaur K. Young L. Ullman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that L. donovani express two nucleoside transporter activities of nonoverlapping ligand specificities; LdNT1, which recognizes adenosine and pyrimidine nucleosides, and LdNT2, which mediates the transport of inosine and guanosine. Subsequently, the genes encoding LdNT1 (4Vasudevan G. Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Beverley S.M. Sanchez M.A. Seyfang A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and LdNT2 (5Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Sanchez M. Vasudevan G. Landfear S.M. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20935-20941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) were isolated by functional rescue of nucleoside transport-deficient L. donovani. The LdNT1 locus encompasses two closely related genes, LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2, and although both are functional after expression in either Xenopus laevis oocytes or L. donovani, only LdNT1.1 transcript is detected by Northern blot analysis of promastigote mRNA (6Vasudevan G. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6092-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Predicted amino acid sequences and membrane topologies of LdNT1.1, LdNT1.2, and LdNT2 reveal that all three transporter proteins are members of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) 1The abbreviations used are: ENT, equilibrative nucleoside transporter; DPA, dipyridamole; I max, maximum current; pC, picoCoulombs; RMP, resting membrane potential; TMD, transmembrane domain; Vm , membrane potential; V max, maximum transport velocity; V rev, reversal potential; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethan sulfonic acid. family (7Hyde R.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membrane Biol. 2001; 18: 53-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian cells and other eukaryotes also express a battery of ENTs, as well as sodium-dependent concentrative nucleoside transporters, which are unrelated in sequence to the ENTs (8Baldwin S.A. Mackey J.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 216-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Leishmania parasites maintain a large proton electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane with a resting potential near –100 mV (9Zilberstein D. Philosoph H. Gepstein A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 36: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 10Vieira L. Slotik I. Cabantchik Z.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5299-5304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and it has been conjectured that these organisms generally exploit this electrochemical gradient to drive concentrative uptake of nutrients into the parasite (11Zilberstein D. Adv. Parasitol. 1993; 32: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). One example of proton driven transport emerged from studies on the proton/myo-inositol co-transporter of L. donovani (12Drew M.E. Langford C.K. Klamo E.M. Russell D.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5508-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Klamo E.M. Drew M.E. Landfear S.M. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14937-14943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether nucleoside uptake into Leishmania could utilize this proton gradient, LdNT1.1, LdNT1.2, and LdNT2 cRNAs were expressed into X. laevis oocytes. Two-electrode voltage clamp measurements on these oocytes revealed that all three carriers were electrogenic. It was further shown that LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2 mediate two pharmacologically separable ion permeation mechanisms, a proton-dependent, inwardly rectifying transport current, and a tonic, linear, and reversible current carried by protons, respectively. From these results, we conclude that these three nucleoside permeases are likely concentrative proton symporters and that some members of the ENT family are thus active transporters. Nucleoside Transporter cRNA Expression in Oocytes—Defolliculated stage V-VI X. laevis oocytes were microinjected with ∼50 ng of capped mRNA that was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (Invitrogen) from linearized pL2–5 plasmids (14Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Fairman W.A. Wu Y.-N. Murdoch G.H. North R.A. Amara S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15329-15332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing either LdNT1.1, LdNT1.2, or LdNT2 using a nanoliter injector from World Precision Instruments (Sarasota, FL). Oocytes were stored at 16 °C in frog Ringer's solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, and 1.5% heat-inactivated horse serum. Electrophysiological and radiolabel uptake measurements were performed 4–7 days after cRNA injection. Electrophysiological Recording—Unless otherwise indicated, recording solutions contained 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and a buffer of either 10 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MES-Tris, pH 5.5, 10 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.5, or 10 mm Tris-HEPES, pH 8.5. In experiments where Na+ was varied or replaced, equimolar concentrations of choline were substituted for the Na+. Two microelectrode voltage-clamp recordings were performed at room temperature using a Gene Clamp 500 interfaced to an IBM compatible PC-AT using a Digidata 1200 A/D controlled by the pCLAMP program suite (version 6.0.3; Axon Instruments). A MacLab/2e analog/digital converter (AD-Instruments) was used to continuously monitor currents. Microelectrodes were filled with a 3 m KCl solution and had resistances of less than 1.5 mΩ. Substrates and antagonists were introduced by gravity flow into a bath that was continuously perfused with Ringer's solution. Dipyridamole (DPA) was dissolved in 0.1% Me2SO, which did not induce a current itself in either LdNT-injected or uninjected oocytes (data not shown). Current-voltage measurements were made during 250-ms voltage pulses to a series of command potentials. Current data were digitized at 1 kHz. The normalized mean concentration response of currents induced by substrate was fitted by least squares to the Michaelis-Menten equation: I = I max ([S]/([S] + Km), where S represents either nucleoside or protons. Unless otherwise indicated, Km values are expressed as mean ± S.E. from fits to individual oocytes. Presteady-state current measurements were recorded at the lowest gain possible to avoid saturation of the amplifier response during the peak of the capacitance transient. For each oocyte, the charge movements carried by the capacitive transient currents were calculated by time integration of the substrate-dependent current after subtraction of steady-state current, which was defined as the current recorded during the last 10 ms of the voltage pulse (16Wadiche J.I. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Charge movements were plotted versus voltage and fitted by least squares to the Boltzmann equation: Q tot = (1 + exp[e 0zδ(Vm – V 0.5)/kT]) + Q offset, where Q tot is the total charge movement, V 0.5 is the midpoint of the charge movement, Vm is the membrane potential, zδ is the product of the valence of the charge and apparent fraction of the field sensed by that charge, Q offset is the offset that depended on the holding potential, e 0 is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. For comparisons among oocytes, charge movements were offset vertically by Q offset and normalized to the Q tot in the same oocytes. Radiolabeled Nucleoside Flux—Oocytes expressing LdNT1.1 or LdNT1.2 were incubated in wells containing either 10 μm [3H]adenosine or [3H]uridine (∼3 × 10–5 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min. Oocytes were then washed for 20 s with Ringer's buffer, transferred into a scintillation tube, solubilized in 1% SDS, and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Electrogenic Nucleoside Transport—Inward currents were observed in oocytes that were voltage-clamped at –100 mV and injected with LdNT1.2 cRNA after application of adenosine, AMP, uridine, thymidine, or cytidine at a concentration of 10 μm (Fig. 1A). No current was observed when the same concentration of inosine, guanosine, adenine, ADP, or ATP, was added (Fig. 1A). In contrast, oocytes microinjected with LdNT1.1 cRNA exhibited an outward current in response to either adenosine or AMP but an inward current when the pyrimidine nucleosides uridine, cytidine, and thymidine were applied (Fig. 1B). No currents were observed in uninjected oocytes in response to the application of any substrate of LdNT1 permeases (Fig. 1C). When DPA (0.1% Me2SO), a potent inhibitor of mammalian nucleoside transporters (7Hyde R.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membrane Biol. 2001; 18: 53-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was superfused over oocytes expressing LdNT1.1 or LdNT1.2 cRNA, an outward current similar to that observed with adenosine or AMP for LdNT1.1 was observed (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, DPA application to uninjected oocytes induced a small inward current (∼20% of the outward current observed after injection with LdNT1.2 cRNA, Fig. 1B). In summary, the known substrates of LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2, as well as AMP and DPA, induced currents in each permease. Although LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2 differ in sequence by only 6 residues (4Vasudevan G. Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Beverley S.M. Sanchez M.A. Seyfang A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), an interesting distinction in the adenosine and AMP response currents of these two transporters was observed. At Vm = –100 mV, adenosine and AMP generate outward currents similar to that observed with DPA when applied to LdNT1.1 (Fig. 1B). In LdNT1.2, however, a significant inward current developed in response to 10 μm adenosine and AMP (Fig. 1A). In order to correlate the differences in the electrical properties of LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2 with the potential function of these proteins as concentrative transporters, the elicited current was plotted as a function of voltage (I/V curves) for oocytes superfused with either 10 μm adenosine or uridine (Fig. 2). The adenosine-dependent currents for LdNT1.1 were outward at hyperpolarized membrane potentials, reversed at a membrane potential of ∼–20 mV, and were inward at depolarized potentials (Fig. 2A), whereas the adenosine currents mediated by LdNT1.2 were inwardly rectifying (Fig. 2B). However, the shape of the LdNT1.2 current versus voltage curve for adenosine exhibited a negative slope conductance at membrane potentials more positive than Vm = –10 mV. In contrast, 10 μm uridine triggered inward currents in both LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2. The data in Fig. 2 were used to estimate molar charge to substrate flux ratios for the two transporters. First, uptake of [3H]adenosine and [3H]uridine over a 30 min time course was measured for each permease using 5 oocytes (Fig. 2C). Using the average resting membrane potential (RMP) measured for these oocytes (LdNT1.1: RMP = –53.0 ± 5.0 mV; LdNT1.2: RMP = –27.0 ± 0.6 mV), the integrated charge crossing the membrane over the 30 min time course of the uptake assay was calculated from the currents in the same group of oocytes defined at each RMP by the curves in Fig. 2, A and B. The molar amounts of charge thus calculated were divided by the molar amounts of radiolabeled ligand that crossed the membrane during the 30 min assay to estimate the charge to substrate flux ratios. According to these calculations, LdNT1.1 counter-transported 0.029 charges per molecule of adenosine and co-transported 0.13 charges per molecule of uridine. LdNT1.2 co-transported 0.0035 charges per molecule of adenosine and co-transported 0.46 charges per molecule of uridine. These non-integer charge to flux values clearly indicate that substrate flux is not tightly coupled to the total currents mediated by LdNT1 transporters. An explanation for charge to flux ratios significantly below unity is offered under “Discussion.” However, the charge to flux ratio of 0.46 for the uridine-induced currents in LdNT1.2 suggests that there is a substantial coupling of transmembrane charge movement to substrate import. pH Dependence of Adenosine-induced Steady-state Currents—To further investigate the origin of the currents observed in Figs. 1 and 2, and to determine whether they might represent proton symport, the pH dependence of the steady-state adenosine-response currents was examined for LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2. Oocytes expressing each permease were exposed to voltage jumps from a holding potential of –60 mV to a range of command potentials. Currents elicited in the absence of adenosine were then subtracted from those recorded in the presence of 30 μm adenosine, resulting in the current versus time traces shown in Fig. 3A. At pH 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5 LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2-expressing oocytes revealed an initial transient capacitive or presteady-state current that then decayed to a steady-state value. No currents were observed in uninjected oocytes (data not shown, n > 5). The steady-state adenosine response currents for LdNT1.2 were plotted as a current-voltage curve (Fig. 3B). Adenosine induced an inward rectifying current at pH 6.5, which is consistent with an inward flux of protons that is coupled to import of adenosine. Notably, the currents at pH 7.5 and 8.5 were considerably smaller than at pH 6.5, again consistent with a coupled flux of protons that experiences a smaller driving force at increased external pH values. There were some differences however in the shapes of the curves, with negative slope conductances at positive potentials at both pH 7.5 and 8.5. In contrast, the shapes of the steady-state current-voltage curves for LdNT1.1 (Fig. 3C) were more complex than those for LdNT1.2. One notable difference between the two permeases is that the adenosine-elicited currents for LdNT1.1 generally exhibited negative slope conductances and reversal potentials that were shifted ∼25 mV per unit change in external pH, in contrast to LdNT1.2. These data suggest that a primary action of adenosine in LdNT1.1 is to block a membrane conductance that is carried in part by protons. It is notable that in contrast to the results at higher pH values, the outward current induced by LdNT1.1 at pH 6.5 decreased again at potentials more negative that –60 mV and again became inward at potentials more negative than ∼–120 mV, resulting in an inverted U-shaped curve (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that at low pH, LdNT1.1, like LdNT1.2, mediates an adenosine-coupled proton symport process that gives rise to an inward current. This substrate-coupled import of protons would be of the largest magnitude at pH 6.5 and at the most polarized membrane potentials, as demonstrated in Fig. 3B for the corresponding current for LdNT1.2. The inverted U-shaped curve for LdNT1.1 at pH 6.5 could thus be explained by the additive combination of the blockage of a proton leak current by adenosine, which predominates above a membrane potential of –60 mV, and an adenosine-coupled proton symport current that becomes apparent below a membrane potential of –60 mV. To further define the proton dependence of LdNT1.2 steadystate currents, the adenosine concentration dependence of these response currents was examined at Vm = –100 mV and at pH 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5 (Fig 4A). The magnitudes of the currents elicited by adenosine concentrations ranging from 0.1–100 μm adenosine were greatest at pH 6.5 and lowest at pH 8.5. The transporter affinity decreased and the maximal transport rate increased with increasing proton concentrations. Thus from the currents observed, a Km value of 1.00 ± 0.09 μm could be calculated for LdNT1.2 at pH 7.5. At pH 6.5, the transporter exhibited a Km value of 2.63 ± 0.45 μm and an I max of 600 ± 26% greater than the I max at pH 7.5. At pH 8.5, the Km was 0.50 ± 0.08 μm, and the I max was 5.2 ± 0.5% of its value at pH 7.5. In summary, the increase of adenosine-elicited currents in LdNT1.2 at lower pH values further supports proton symport as a mechanism for transport. Lack of Sodium Dependence of Adenosine Uptake or Adenosine-induced Currents—The observation of electrogenic transport for these protozoan nucleoside permeases contrasts with other members of the ENT family, which are equilibrative permeases and not electrogenic (7Hyde R.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membrane Biol. 2001; 18: 53-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast another family of nucleoside transporters, the CNTs, are sodium-dependent electrogenic active transporters (15Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Loewen S.K. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 283: C155-C168Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Consequently, whether LdNT1.1- or LdNT1.2-mediated adenosine uptake might be sodium dependent was also determined. Replacement of sodium in the bath with equimolar choline did not significantly affect either LdNT1.1- or LdNT1.2-mediated adenosine uptake (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the LdNT1.2 transporter exhibited no significant difference in either the affinity or maximal current when sodium was replaced with choline (Fig. 4C). Indeed, replacement of sodium with choline did not affect adenosine-induced currents for LdNT1.2 at any adenosine concentration, indicating that LdNT1.2 is not a sodium symporter. Capacitive Gating Currents—As noted above (Fig. 3), application of voltage jumps to oocytes expressing LdNT1.1 or LdNT1.2 induced adenosine-dependent presteady-state or transient currents that decayed with exponential time constants of <100 msec. For some transporters, such transient currents have been linked to binding of a co-transported ion to the permease (16Wadiche J.I. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). To determine whether the adenosine-induced transient currents could be explained by binding of protons to the permeases, and could thus be useful for probing interaction of protons with the transporters, the kinetic properties of these pre-steady-state currents were examined at several proton concentrations by time integration of the currents following the return of the clamped membrane to the holding potential from a voltage step (Fig. 5). The transient charge movement obeyed similar voltage dependences at pH 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5 (Fig. 5A, n = 4). The total charge movement induced by adenosine was similar at these pHs (Q tot (pH 6.5) is 35033 ± 3980 pC; Q tot (pH 7.5) is 44771 ± 2883 pC; Q tot (pH 8.5) is 39179 ± 1771 pC). The midpoint of the integrated current voltage dependence is a measurement of the transporter's affinity for the translocated charge (16Wadiche J.I. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The midpoint of the integrated transient current mediated by 30 μm adenosine was also found to be essentially independent of pH (V 0.5 (pH 6.5) is 3.31 ± 3.23 mV; V 0.5 (pH 7.5) is –9.53 ± 3.33 mV; V 0.5 (pH 8.5) is –4.93 ± 2.53 mV). The transient current elicited by 30 μm adenosine also exhibited a similar slope to its voltage dependence at the three pHs examined, which implies that the translocated charge experiences the same fraction of the membrane electric field under these conditions (slope (pH 6.5) is 60.90 ± 2.70 mV–1; slope (pH 7.5) is 81.88 ± 3.59 mV–1; slope (pH 8.5) is 74.40 ± 4.00 mV–1) (17Woodhull A.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 61: 687-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). The insensitivity of midpoint and slope values to changes in pH implies that the capacitive transient current is not due to a proton binding event. Rather, it may be a charge-moving conformational change in the transport protein. To verify that the transient current elicited by adenosine was associated with transporter function, the adenosine concentration dependence of the integrated capacitive current was examined (Fig. 5B). The magnitude of the capacitive current was dependent upon adenosine concentration in a dose-dependent manner, and the apparent affinity of the transporter for adenosine (Km is 1.35 ± 0.11 μm) when measured in this way was similar to that derived from analysis of the steady-state currents (Km is 1.00 ± 0.09 μm, Fig. 4). These results imply that the pre-steady-state currents reflect transporter function. It is possible to estimate the charge transfer rate of the transporter by dividing the steady-state current through the transporter (I, pC/sec) by the total number of elementary charges blocked by adenosine (Q/zδ, pC) and assuming a charge to flux stoichiometry of 1:1 (16Wadiche J.I. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The charge transfer rate was calculated at pHs between 5.5 and 8.5 (Fig. 5C). Performing this calculation at pH 7.5 revealed that the transporter moves 0.7 ± 0.05 times per second through the membrane at –100 mV. The proton dose dependence of the transporter's charge transfer rate was fitted with a proton affinity of 0.62 ± 0.05 μm, and the maximal cycling rate was found to be 10.4 ± 0.2 per sec. DPA Blocks a Tonic Proton Leak through LdNT1 Transporters—DPA is a high affinity antagonist of mammalian adenosine transporters (7Hyde R.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membrane Biol. 2001; 18: 53-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but does not significantly inhibit nucleoside transporters from parasitic protozoa (1Carter N.S. Rager N. Ullman B. Marr J.J. Nilsen T. Komuniecki R. Molecular and Medical Parasitology. Academic Press, London2003: 197-223Google Scholar). Despite its failure to significantly inhibit the Leishmania permeases, DPA activates a current in LdNT-expressing oocytes (Fig. 1, A and B). To further characterize the effect of DPA on these transporters, the transmembrane currents recorded prior to DPA application were subtracted from currents recorded during DPA application revealing a current in LdNT1-expressing cells that was not observed in uninjected oocytes (Fig. 6A ). The DPA-induced currents in LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2 were linear and reversible, and they were outward at more negative membrane potentials (Fig. 6, B and C). The LdNT1-mediated currents saturated with respect to the DPA concentration (Km is 35 ± 10 μm in LdNT1.2 at Vm = –100 mV; data not shown, n = 4). In contrast, the smaller current that was present in uninjected oocytes was inward and did not reverse (Fig. 6D), Similar to the behavior of the transporter current blocked by adenosine, the reversal potential of the DPA-elicted currents was observed to shift to more positive values as the extracellular concentration of protons was increased, suggesting that this current is carried substantially by protons (Fig. 6, B and C). A quantitative analysis of the reversal potential pH dependence is precluded by the DPA-induced current in uninjected oocytes (Fig. 6D). AMP Induces Currents for LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2—The observation that AMP was able to elicit currents in oocytes microinjected with either LdNT1.1 or LdNT1.2 cRNA (Fig. 1) was surprising in view of the negative charge of the nucleotide and the fact that nucleotides typically are not taken up by intact eukaryotic cells. To further investigate this phenomenon, we measured current-voltage curves for AMP-induced currents for LdNT1.2 (Fig. 7), the permease that elicited inward directed currents with this ligand. For LdNT1.2 the maximal AMP-induced current at Vm = –100 mV was 20.1% of the maximal current induced by a saturating (30 μm) concentration of adenosine in the same oocytes (Fig. 7A). The AMP response current in LdNT1.2 was saturable with respect to AMP, and its concentration dependence exhibited an apparent affinity of 9 ± 3 μm (Fig. 7B). The shapes of the AMP and adenosine response current-voltage relationships are qualitatively similar at pH 7.5 (compare Fig. 7A to Fig. 3B). It does not appear that the AMP-induced current could be ascribed to adenosine contamination because the purity of the AMP was verified by high performance liquid and thin layer chromatography (data not shown). Furthermore, when [3H]AMP was applied to LdNT1.2-expressing oocytes, the radiolabel was taken up robustly by the oocytes, but no significant amount of [3H]adenosine was liberated into the supernatant. 2S. M. Landfear, unpublished data. Hence, the AMP-induced currents cannot be ascribed to hydrolysis of AMP that liberates free adenosine into the medium followed by uptake of this liberated adenosine by the permease. The origin of these AMP-induced currents is currently under investigation. The LdNT2 Inosine-Guanosine Permease Is Also Electrogenic—The other nucleoside transporter of L. donovani, LdNT2, mediates the uptake of inosine and guanosine, is also a member of the ENT family, and exhibits 33% sequence identity to LdNT1.1 (5Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Sanchez M. Vasudevan G. Landfear S.M. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20935-20941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Oocytes injected with LdNT2 cRNA were also shown to elicit inward response currents to the application of ligands. Inosine and guanosine, but not adenosine or thymidine, mediated inward rectifying currents in a voltage-dependent fashion (Fig. 8A). LdNT2 also mediated a reversible DPA-induced outward current at negative membrane potentials, similar to that observed for LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2. Neither inosine, guanosine, adenosine, nor thymidine induced a current in uninjected oocytes, although 10 μm DPA elicited a small inward current (Fig. 8B). The induction of inward rectifying currents specifically by substrates of the LdNT2 permease implies that this transporter also couples the symport of protons to nucleosides, much as demonstrated above for the LdNT1.2 carrier. The outward directed currents elicited by DPA suggest that this compound blocks a constitutive leak current in LdNT2, in a manner similar to that observed for LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2 (Fig. 6). We have shown that adenosine/pyrimidine nucleoside transport through the LdNT1 transporters is associated with the activation of transmembrane currents. The magnitudes of the currents mediated by LdNT1.2 and the substrate fluxes mediated by both LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2 were dependent on the proton, but not the sodium, gradient, strongly suggesting that these proteins are proton/nucleoside symporters. Unlike the Leishmania proton/myo-inositol symporter MIT, which transports myo-inositol with a charge to flux ratio of 1 (13Klamo E.M. Drew M.E. Landfear S.M. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14937-14943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), LdNT1 did not mediate substrate flux that was tightly coupled to total charge translocation. Although LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2 are very similar in sequence, they exhibit striking differences with respect to their electrogenic properties, most notably that adenosine strongly blocks a leak current in LdNT1.1, whereas adenosine induces an inward proton current in LdNT1.2. It is likely that the adenosine blockage of the leak current in LdNT1.1 obscures an inward directed adenosine-coupled proton current similar to that observed in LdNT1.2. In fact, the inward directed current observed for LdNT1.1 at pH 6.5 below a transmembrane voltage of –120 mV (Fig. 3C) is likely to be such a transport-coupled current that overcomes the block of the leak current at this lower pH value and more negative membrane potential. Thus the essential difference between the two permeases may be that adenosine effects a more robust block of the leak current in LdNT1.1 compared with LdNT1.2. We have also shown that LdNT1 transporters mediate a constitutive proton conductance that is blocked by the compound DPA. Unlike the mammalian ENTs, the Leishmania nucleoside transporters are not significantly inhibited by DPA at concentrations that obliterate transport by mammalian ENTs (2Aronow B. Kaur K. McCartan K. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 22: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and thus the precise nature of the interaction between this compound and the LdNTs is not clear. Nonetheless the ability of DPA, which is very lipophilic and known to affect the entry of many structurally unrelated compounds into mammalian cells (18Kessel D. Dodd D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 288: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Graff J.C. Wohlhueter R.M. Plagemann P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4185-4190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to block the constitutive proton leak is instructive, as it likely reflects a similar block of this leak current that is induced by interaction of substrates with the LdNT1 permeases. We hypothesize that part of the reason charge translocation appears to be loosely coupled to substrate flux in LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2 is that adenosine transport blocks the constitutive proton conductance in a similar manner to DPA. By summing a linear current with a pH-dependent reversal potential such as the one observed upon application of DPA (Fig. 6, B and C) and a pH-dependent inwardly rectifying transport current such as that observed after application of adenosine to LdNT1.2 at pH 6.5 (Fig. 3B), it is possible to generate current-voltage curves with shapes corresponding to the adenosine response current-voltage curves. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that, while lower pH increases the relative contribution of inward adenosine response current at negative potentials in LdNT1.1, it also shifts the reversal potential of the current-voltage curve to more positive potentials (Fig. 3C), as would be expected for a current that represents blockage of a proton leak. The presence of this blocked proton conductance would cause our calculations of the charge to flux ratio to be significant underestimates of the actual value, especially when the measurements are made at the resting potentials of the oocytes (between –53 and –27 mV) rather than at highly polarized membrane potentials that favor the influx of protons that are coupled to adenosine transport. In summary, the blockage of a constitutive proton leak by substrates complicates the estimation of charge to substrate flux ratios for these protozoan nucleoside transporters. However, this constitutive leak is blocked less efficiently in LdNT1.2 than in LdNT1.1, and uridine blocks this leak less effectively in both transporters compared with adenosine (Fig. 2). Consequently, the charge to flux ratio calculated for uridine in LdNT1.2 (0.46 charges per molecule) is probably the estimate that most closely reflects the value for proton symport coupled to a substrate. Hence, substrates appear to mediate the import of at least ∼0.5 charge units per molecule. LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2 differ by only 6 amino acid residues in sequence, and three of these polymorphisms are located on the extreme COOH termini of the proteins. Despite the high degree of identity, these transporters exhibit different affinities for the substrates adenosine and uridine (4Vasudevan G. Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Beverley S.M. Sanchez M.A. Seyfang A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and mediate different currents during adenosine and AMP transport. The COOH-terminal residues are the uncharged ATY in LdNT1.1 compared with the highly charged ERH in LdNT1.2. While these sequences could be important in determining the distinct electrogenic properties of the proteins, perhaps a more likely residue for the observed differences is P43 in LdNT1.1. This proline is a serine in LdNT1.2, and it is the only polymorphism that lies within a predicted transmembrane domain (TMD1). The other polymorphisms include M107I (between TMD2 and TMD3) and T160A (between TMD4 and TMD5), which are located within predicted hydrophilic loops of the permeases. Mutational analysis outside the scope of this manuscript will be needed to evaluate the role of each polymorphism on the kinetic and electrophysiological differences between LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2. Our analysis of the transporters responsible for nucleoside transport in L. donovani, LdNT1.1, LdNT1.2, and LdNT2, has demonstrated that these proteins couple the large proton electrochemical gradient available to the parasites to nucleoside uptake. Purine uptake is vital to the survival of the parasites, as they are incapable of purine biosynthesis, and the ability of the parasite to concentrate essential purines from the extracellular medium may thus provide an evolutionary advantage by promoting its survival within both the insect vector and/or the vertebrate host. The parasite nucleoside transporters studied here exhibit ∼30% identity at the amino acid sequence level with members of the mammalian equilibrative nucleoside transporter family. Since LdNT1.1, LdNT1.2 and LdNT2 are apparently proton symporters, it now appears that some members of the ENT family are concentrative permeases. This conclusion is also consistent with previous studies performed on transport of nucleosides by intact procyclic forms of the related protozoan Trypanosoma brucei, in which the dependence of nucleoside transport upon the proton electrochemical gradient across the parasite plasma membrane strongly suggested proton symport as a mechanism of active transport (20de Koning H.P. Watson C.J. Jarvis S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9486-9494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Similar studies in which the ENT1 (At) permease from Arabidopsis thaliana was expressed in yeast also strongly suggest that this permease is a proton symporter (21Möhlmann T. Mezher Z. Schwerdtfeger G. Neuhaus H.E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is possible that relatively few changes in amino acid sequence determine whether a nucleoside transporter of this family functions as a concentrative or equilibrative permease. However, the extensive differences in sequence between equilibrative and concentrative members of the ENT family make it difficult to predict which residues may be required for proton symport and suggest that extensive structure-function studies will likely be required to elucidate determinants of active transport. The ability of the nucleotide AMP to induce currents in LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2 that are very similar to those induced by adenosine, as well as the ability of radiolabel from [3H]AMP to enter LdNT1.1 or LdNT1.2-expressing oocytes, is intriguing, as these anionic metabolites are thought not to be transported across the plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells. We are currently pursuing further studies to determine the nature of the interaction of AMP with the LdNT1.1 and LdNT1.2 permeases."

https://openalex.org/W1967036913,"p23 is an Hsp90-associated protein that regulates signal transduction by the estrogen receptor α (ER); however, the mechanism through which p23 governs ER function remains enigmatic. To obtain a collection of p23 molecules with distinct effects on ER signaling, we screened in yeast a series of random mutations as well as specific sequence alterations based on the p23 crystal structure and further analyzed these mutations for their effect on p23-Hsp90 association in vitro and in vivo. We found that the ability of the p23 mutants to decrease or increase ER signal transduction correlated with their association with Hsp90. We also identified a mutation in the C-terminal tail of p23, which displayed a dominant inhibitory effect on ER transcriptional activation and associates more avidly with Hsp90 relative to the wild type p23. Interestingly, this mutant interacts with Hsp90 in its non-ATP-bound state, whereas the wild type p23 protein interacts exclusively with the ATP-bound form of Hsp90, which may account for its dominant phenotype. In addition, we have uncovered a novel activity of p23 that antagonizes Hsp90 action during times of cell stress. Using molecular modeling and the p23 crystal structure, we found that the p23 mutations affecting ER signaling identified in the screen localized to one face of the molecule, whereas those that had no effect mapped to other parts of the protein. Thus, our structure/function analysis has identified an important regulatory surface on p23 involved in ER signaling and p23 binding to Hsp90."
https://openalex.org/W2095439647,"Epidemiological data have implicated the pituitary gonadotropin follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) as both a risk factor for and a protective agent against epithelial ovarian cancer. Yet, little is known about how this hormone could play such opposing roles in ovarian carcinogenesis. Complementary DNA microarrays containing 2400 named genes were used to examine FSH-induced gene expression changes in ovarian cancer (OC) and immortalized normal human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cell lines. Two-way t-statistics analyses of array data identified two distinct sets of FSH-regulated genes in HOSE and in established OC cell lines established from patients (OVCA cell lines). Among the HOSE cell lines, FSH increased expression of 57% of the 312 genes and downregulated 43%. In contrast, FSH diminished expression of 92% of the 177 genes in the OVCA cell lines. All but 18 of the genes affected by FSH in HOSE cell lines were different from those altered in OVCA cell lines. Among the 18 overlapping genes, nine genes exhibited the same direction of change following FSH challenge, while the other nine showed discordance in response between HOSE and OVCA cell lines. The FSH-induced differential expression of seven out of nine genes was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Gene-specific antisense oligonuleotides (ODNs) were used to inhibit the expression of genes encoding GTPase activating protein (rap1GAP), neogenin, and restin in HOSE and OVCA cells. Antisense ODNs to neogenin and restin, but not an antisense ODN to rap1GAP, were effective in inhibiting OVCA cell growth, diminishing proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, and increasing caspase 3 activities. Furthermore, the ODN to rap1GAP was further shown to be ineffective in altering migration properties of OVCA cell lines. HOSE cell proliferation was not affected by treatment with any of the antisense ODNs. In summary, gene profiling data reveal for the first time that FSH may exert different biological actions on OVCA cells than on HOSE cells, by differential regulation of a set of putative oncogenes/tumor suppressors. Specifically, neogenin and restin were found to exhibit proproliferation/survival action on OC cells."

We have used capacitance measurements to study the effects of InsP6 on Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in single mouse pancreatic β-cells.

The present study was designed to examine which PKC isoform mediates the stimulatory action of InsP6 on Ca2+-induced exocytosis. Using whole-cell patch clamp techniques and capacitance measurements of exocytosis, we demonstrate that PKC-ϵ regulates InsP6-induced exocytosis in single mouse pancreatic β-cells. Preparation of Islet Cells—Pancreatic islets were isolated from fed female NMRI mice (18–23 g) by collagenase digestion as described previously (3Høy M. Efanov A.M. Bertorello A.M. Zaitsev S.V. Olsen H.L. Bokvist K. Leibiger B. Leibiger I.B. Zwiller J. Berggren P.-O. Gromada J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6773-6777Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The local ethical committee in Copenhagen approved the methods of euthanasia. The islets were dispersed into single cells by shaking in a Ca2+-free solution, and the resulting cell suspension was plated on Nunc Petri dishes and maintained for up to 3 days in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 international units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Electrophysiology—Exocytosis was measured as increases in cell membrane capacitance using an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier and the Pulse software (v. 8.31; HEKA Elektronik, Lamprecht/Pfalz, Germany) as described previously (3Høy M. Efanov A.M. Bertorello A.M. Zaitsev S.V. Olsen H.L. Bokvist K. Leibiger B. Leibiger I.B. Zwiller J. Berggren P.-O. Gromada J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The interval between two successive points was 0.2 s, and the measurements of cell capacitance were initiated <5 s following establishment of the standard whole-cell configuration. The volume of the recording chamber was 0.4 ml, and the solution entering the bath (1.5 ml/min) was maintained at 33 °C. Exocytosis was elicited by infusion of an electrode solution consisting of 125 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 3 mm Mg-ATP, 10 mm EGTA, and 0.01, 5, 8, and 10 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.15 with KOH). The free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+] f) of the resulting buffers were 0.03, 0.22, 0.87, and 2.0 μm, using the binding constants described in Ref. 6Martell A.E. Smith R.M.

The extracellular solution was composed of 138 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and 5 mm d-glucose. Ins(1,4,5)P3, deltamethrin, and permethrin were from Alomone Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel), and (R p)-cAMP was obtained from Biolog Life Science Institute (Bremen, Germany).

Cultures of β-cells were co-transfected with green fluorescent protein (1 μg/ml) and 5 μm PKC oligonucleotides using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) and incubated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented as described above for 48 h before use. The antisense and sense oligonucleotides were synthesized at TAG Copenhagen (Copenhagen, Denmark). The oligonucleotides were phosphothioated at the underlined positions. Plasmid Construction—The cDNAs for PKC-ϵ and PKC-βI were kindly provided by Y. Nishizuka (Kobe University, Kobe, Japan). A dominant negative mutant of PKC-ϵ was obtained from K. Ridge (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). Transfection of mouse β-cells was performed using 3 μg of PKC cDNA and 1 μg of green fluorescent protein using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following transfection, cells were cultured for 48 h in RPMI 1640 supplemented as described above. Data Analysis—Results are presented as mean values ± S.E. for the indicated number of experiments. The exocytotic rate (ΔCm /Δt) is presented as the increase in cell capacitance measured 30–90 s following establishment of the whole-cell configuration. Statistical significance was evaluated using Student's t test for paired observations or Dunnett's test for multiple comparisons. Fig. 1A shows the exocytotic responses in single mouse pancreatic β-cells obtained using the standard whole-cell configuration in which the pipette-filling electrode solution replaces the cytosol. Exocytosis was stimulated by intracellular dialysis of an electrode solution with a Ca2+-EGTA buffer with a free Ca2+ concentration of 0.87 μm. Under control conditions, the rate of capacitance increase averaged 21 ± 4 femtofarads/s (n = 5). This corresponds to the release of seven granules/s as every granule contributes ≈3 femtofarads (10Olofsson C.S. Gopel S.O. Barg S. Galvanovskis J. Ma X. Salehi A. Rorsman P. Eliasson L. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2002; 444: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Inclusion of 100 μm InsP6 in the pipette-filling solution produced a delayed (23 ± 4 s; n = 5) decrease in cell capacitance, an effect that we attribute to stimulation of endocytosis (3Høy M. Efanov A.M. Bertorello A.M. Zaitsev S.V. Olsen H.L. Bokvist K. Leibiger B. Leibiger I.B. Zwiller J. Berggren P.-O. Gromada J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6773-6777Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). On average, the increase in cell capacitance was reduced by 62% (p < 0.05; n = 5) when measured after 30–90 s. We have previously reported that InsP6-induced endocytosis is mediated by the protein phosphatase calcineurin (3Høy M. Efanov A.M. Bertorello A.M. Zaitsev S.V. Olsen H.L. Bokvist K. Leibiger B. Leibiger I.B. Zwiller J. Berggren P.-O. Gromada J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6773-6777Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in cells pretreated for 15 min with 1.5 μm of the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A, rather different results were obtained (Fig. 1A). Under these conditions, InsP6 (100 μm) increased the exocytotic response by 86% (p < 0.01; n = 6). InsP6 also stimulated exocytosis in the presence of the calcineurin inhibitor deltamethrin (20 nm for 1.5 h) (96% stimulation; p < 0.01; n = 5), an effect that was not mimicked by permethrin, an inactive analogue of deltamethrin (Fig. 1B). In the presence of permethrin, InsP6-induced exocytosis was inhibited by 65% (p < 0.05; n = 5), which is not different from that observed under control conditions (Fig. 1B). Finally, okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1, 2A, and 3, did not affect the InsP6-induced reduction of exocytosis (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that InsP6 stimulates both exocytosis and endocytosis in pancreatic β-cells and that the endocytotic process dominates under the actual experimental conditions as suggested by the overall decrease in the rate of capacitance increase. In this respect, it is important to emphasize that capacitance measurements reflect net changes in plasma membrane area resulting from the summed activity of all endocytotic and exocytotic processes. The stimulatory action of InsP6 on exocytosis was revealed following inhibition of endocytosis. The stimulatory action of InsP6 on exocytosis was dependent on dose. No significant stimulation of exocytosis was observed at <10 μm InsP6, but higher concentrations elicited a dose-dependent acceleration of secretion (Fig. 1C). Approximating the average data points to the Hill equation yielded a half-maximal stimulatory effect at 22 μm and a cooperativity factor of 1.4. Maximal stimulation of exocytosis was seen at concentrations of InsP6 ≥100 μm (Fig. 1C), at which exocytosis was nearly doubled over the control rate of capacitance increase. The ability of InsP6 to stimulate exocytosis depends on the [Ca2+] f in the pipette-filling solution (Fig. 1D). No stimulation was observed at 30 nm [Ca2+] f , but increasing concentrations of Ca2+ elicited a progressive increase in the rate of exocytosis, which was further accelerated in the presence of InsP6. The lack of effect of InsP6 at low [Ca2+] f contrasts previous findings in HIT insulinoma cells (2Efanov A.M. Zaitsev S.V. Berggren P.-O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4435-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This difference in Ca2+ sensitivity of the stimulatory action of InsP6 on exocytosis most likely reflects the use of a clonal cell line versus primary β-cells but could also result from different experimental approaches (permeabilized cells and single cell capacitance measurements). Fig. 1E shows that the stimulatory action of InsP6 on exocytosis was also evoked, although to a lesser extent, by inositol tetrakisphosphate compounds and the inositol pentakisphosphate, Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5. These inositol polyphosphates stimulated exocytosis by only 48–66%, as compared with 86% increase in the presence of InsP6 (Fig. 1D). It is noteworthy that the required stimulatory concentrations of InsP4, but not InsP6, are 50–100 times higher than those measured in insulin-secreting cells (11Li G. Pralong W.F. Pittet D. Mayr G.W. Schlegel W. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4349-4356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No stimulation of exocytosis was observed in the presence of 100 μm Ins(1,3,4)P3 and Ins(1,4,5)P3 (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that a minimum of four phosphate groups are required for stimulation of exocytosis and that these phosphate groups can be randomly placed on the inositol ring. Furthermore, the data show that all six phosphate groups are required for maximal stimulation of exocytosis. InsP6 stimulates exocytosis by activation of PKC in permeabilized insulinoma cells (2Efanov A.M. Zaitsev S.V. Berggren P.-O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4435-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Here we extend this observation to mouse β-cells since the stimulatory action of InsP6 on exocytosis was abolished by the PKC inhibitors calphostin C (1.5 μm for >15 min), bisindolylmaleimide (4 μm for 20 min), and staurosporine (100 nm for >10 min) (Fig. 2). On the contrary, no effect was observed on the stimulatory action of InsP6 in the presence of the protein kinase A inhibitor (R p)-cAMP (100 μm for >30 min). Under these conditions, InsP6 stimulated exocytosis by 90% (p < 0.05; n = 5; Fig. 2). To investigate which isoform of PKC mediates the stimulatory action of InsP6 on exocytosis, cells were treated for 48 h with antisense oligonucleotides against PKC-α, -βII, -δ, -ϵ, and -ξ. Fig. 3A shows that InsP6 failed to increase exocytosis in cells exposed to antisense oligonucleotides against PKC-ϵ. However, InsP6 retained its stimulatory action when cells were treated with antisense oligonucleotides against PKC-α, -βII, -δ, -ξ, and sense PKC-ϵ oligonucleotides. These data argue that InsP6 stimulates exocytosis by a mechanism that involves activation of PKC-ϵ. The involvement of PKC-ϵ in InsP6-induced exocytosis was further supported by studies in mouse β-cells transiently transfected with either wild-type or a dominant negative mutant of PKC-ϵ. Fig. 3B shows that InsP6 (100 μm) evoked a robust increase in cell capacitance in mock-transfected cells and in cells expressing wild-type PKC-ϵ. On the contrary, the dominant negative PKC-ϵ isoform abolished the ability of InsP6 to stimulate exocytosis. Interestingly, the wild-type PKC-ϵ isoform significantly increased Ca2+-induced exocytosis, whereas the dominant negative isoform reduced the exocytotic response in the absence of InsP6 by 50% (Fig. 3B). Transfection of the wild-type PKC-βI isoform did not influence Ca2+- and InsP6-induced exocytosis (Fig. 3B). The results from this study show for the first time that PKC-ϵ is involved in the stimulatory action of InsP6 on Ca2+-evoked exocytosis. The molecular mechanism for the activation of PKC-ϵ by InsP6 remains to be explored. However, it is pertinent to emphasize that an InsP6-activated protein kinase has been identified in rat brain (12Hilton J.M. Plomann M. Ritter B. Modregger J. Freeman H.N. Falck J.R. Krishna U.M.

The substrate(s) for PKC-ϵ are poorly understood, but recent data from our laboratories demonstrate that PKC-ϵ associates with insulin-containing granules in response to glucose and clinically used sulfonylureas. 2C. F. Mendez, I. B. Leibiger, B. Leibiger, M. Hoøy, J. Gromada, P. O. Berggren, and A. M. Bertorello, manuscript submitted for publication. These data suggest that PKC-ϵ represents an important component of the secretory network in pancreatic β-cells. A model for the effects of glucose and InsP6 on exocytosis and endocytosis is presented in Fig. 4. Glucose acts to stimulate ATP synthesis, leading to closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, cell depolarization, and Ca2+ influx. The resulting increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration stimulates exocytosis. Not only activation of the phospholipase C system but also glucose stimulation result in InsP6 production, which leads to enhanced PKC-ϵ activity. PKC-ϵ potentiates Ca2+-induced exocytosis. An increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration is also required for stimulation of endocytosis. This process involves activation of calcineurin and PKC-ϵ, most likely resulting in a sequential phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins involved in endocytosis (for details, see Ref. 3Høy M. Efanov A.M. Bertorello A.M. Zaitsev S.V. Olsen H.L. Bokvist K. Leibiger B. Leibiger I.B. Zwiller J. Berggren P.-O. Gromada J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This suggests that InsP6 has an important integral role in pancreatic β-cell membrane trafficking, being part of the molecular mechanisms linking exocytosis and endocytosis."

Our previous results utilizing DT40 cells containing a conditional TAF9 allele indicated that the histone 3-like TAF9 is essential for cell viability but largely dispensable for general transcription. In this study, we investigated further the role of TAF9 structural domains in TFIID integrity and cell growth and the functions of a TAF9-related factor, TAF9L. We first show that TAF9 depletion severely disrupts TFIID, indicating that the observed ongoing transcription is initiated with at least partially TAF-free TATA-binding protein. We also provide evidence for specific roles of TAF HFMs, highlighting the functional significance of HFM specificity observed in vitro and, importantly, of the TAF9-histone 3 similarity. Although we provide evidence that TAF9 and TAF9L are partly redundant, RNA interference experiments suggest that TAF9L is essential for HeLa cell growth.

TFIID is composed of highly conserved subunits, including the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and about 12–14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs) (1Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev.

Despite their diverse sequence and structural features, most TAFs (9 of 14 in yeast) contain domains known as histone fold motifs (HFMs) that display varying degrees of similarity with canonical histone core domains (5Gangloff Y.G. Romier C. Thuault S. Werten S. Davidson I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 250-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). TAF HFMs have been shown to mediate highly specific pairwise TAF-TAF interactions in cocrystal structures, in vitro interaction assays, and coexpression analyses (5Gangloff Y.G. Romier C. Thuault S.

Furthermore, histone-like TAFs were shown in immunolabeling/electron microscopy analysis to colocalize to specific TFIID subdomains (10Andel III, F. Ladurner A.G. Inouye C. Tjian R. Nogales E. Science. 1999; 286: 2153-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11Brand M. Leurent C. Mallouh V. Tora L. Schultz P. Science. 1999; 286: 2151-2153Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) in a pattern consistent with the above pairwise TAF interactions (12Leurent C. Sanders S. Ruhlmann C. Mallouh V. Weil P.A. Kirschner D.B. Tora L. Schultz P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3424-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Additionally, four yeast histone-like TAFs, TAF6/9 (H4/H3-like) and TAF4/12 (H2A/H2B-like), were reconstituted into a histone octamer-like complex in vitro (13Selleck W. Howley R. Fang Q. Podolny V. Fried M.G. Buratowski S. Tan S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the roles of the HFMs in TFIID structure and function in vivo are still unclear for most TAFs, especially in vertebrates. For example, the highly conserved arginine residues in histones that contact DNA are missing in TAFs (14Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar), suggesting that histones and histone-like TAFs contact DNA differently. A subset of the histone-like TAFs were also found to be integral components of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) protein complexes, including SAGA in yeast and GCN5, PCAF, TFTC, and STAGA in vertebrates (2Albright S.R. Tjian R. Gene. 2000; 242: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 3Green M.R. Trends Biochem.

Lemon B.D. Tjian R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 475-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). These HAT complexes are larger than TFIID, containing GCN5 or PCAF HAT activity and other factors likely involved in diverse nuclear processes (17Brand M. Moggs J.G. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Lejeune F. Dilworth F.J. Stevenin J. Almouzni G. Tora L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3187-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 18Martinez E. Palhan V.B. Tjernberg A. Lymar E.S. Gamper A.M. Kundu T.K. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6782-6795Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Importantly, however, histone-like TAFs that are missing in the vertebrate HAT complexes are replaced with a different set of HFM-containing subunits, and the specific pairwise patterns mediated by TAF HFMs are well conserved in these HAT complexes (5Gangloff Y.G. Romier C. Thuault S. Werten S. Davidson I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 250-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13Selleck W. Howley R. Fang Q. Podolny V. Fried M.G. Buratowski S. Tan S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, electron microscopy images of TFTC showed an overall shape and subdomain organization similar to TFIID (11Brand M. Leurent C. Mallouh V. Tora L. Schultz P. Science. 1999; 286: 2151-2153Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These findings together strongly suggest that histone-like TAFs play important roles in maintaining the overall structures of TFIID and HAT complexes. More recently, several TAFs (including TAF4, TAF6, and TAF9) and TBP were also found in yet another multisubunit complex, the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) (19Saurin A.J. Shao Z. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kingston R.E. Nature. 2001; 412: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), in Drosophila. PRC1 functions to maintain transcriptional repression, or silencing, of certain regulatory genes, such as the HOX genes in flies and vertebrates (20Pirrotta V. Cell. 1998; 93: 333-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 21Mahmoudi T. Verrijzer C.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3055-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed the presence of GTFs on PRC1-repressed promoters (22Breiling A. Turner B.M. Bianchi M.E. Orlando V. Nature. 2001; 412: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), suggesting that promoter-bound GTFs are locked in a transcriptionally inactive conformation and that TBP and TAFs found in PRC1 could serve as a link between target promoters and PRC1. However, the precise TAF composition of PRC1 and the role of TAFs in transcriptional repression await further experiments. In addition to the core TAFs that exist in TFIID and related complexes, a number of variant TAFs have also been uncovered in metazoans. Some variant TAFs are derived from the same genes that encode core TAFs. For example, in response to apoptotic stimuli, a human TAF6 splicing isoform is induced and incorporated into a specialized TAF9-free TFIID required for an altered transcriptional program (23Bell B. Scheer E. Tora L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 591-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, a modified form of TAF9 was detected in both PCAF and STAGA but not in TFIID (18Martinez E. Palhan V.B. Tjernberg A. Lymar E.S. Gamper A.M. Kundu T.K. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6782-6795Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 24Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Alternatively, distinct genes encode many variant TAFs. Unlike core TAFs that display ubiquitous expression patterns (25Perletti L. Dantonel J.C. Davidson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15301-15304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), these TAFs are typically highly expressed only in selective tissues (26Freiman R.N. Albright S.R. Zheng S. Sha W.C. Hammer R.E. Tjian R. Science. 2001; 293: 2084-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 27Wang P.J. Page D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2341-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Disruption of one such tissue-specific TAF, TAF4B, in mice caused defective ovarian development (26Freiman R.N. Albright S.R. Zheng S. Sha W.C. Hammer R.E. Tjian R. Science. 2001; 293: 2084-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although yeast SAGA contains TAF5 and TAF6 (28Grant P.A. Schieltz D. Pray-Grant M.G. Steger D.J. Reese J.C. Yates III, J.R. Workman J.L. Cell. 1998; 94: 45-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), the human HAT complexes instead utilize related factors, TAF5L and TAF6L (17Brand M. Moggs J.G.

Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), and Drosophila TAF5L was shown to be required for normal spermatid differentiation (29Hiller M.A. Lin T.Y. Wood C. Fuller M.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In addition, an apparent TAF9-related factor was found in two murine cell lines (30Aoki T. Koike T. Nakano T. Shibahara K. Nishimura H. Kikuchi H. Honjo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 31Thompson A. Ravid K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and a systematic examination of the human genome uncovered six TAF9-related sequences (32Tupler R. Perini G. Green M.R. Nature. 2001; 409: 832-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Previously we constructed a conditional TAF9 knockout cell line in chicken DT40 cells (DT40-TAF9) (33Chen Z. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5064-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We provided evidence that TAF9 was not generally required for RNAP II-mediated transcription in vivo, although depletion of TAF9 resulted in codepletion of many other TAFs and apoptotic cell death. Here we use DT40-TAF9 cells to investigate further the properties and functions of TAF9. We show that depletion of TAF9 causes disruption of TFIID, illustrating both the key role of TAF9 in TFIID structural integrity and the functional competence of TFIID with greatly reduced TAF content. Complementation analyses with various TAF9 chimeras reveal stringent sequence requirements of the HFM, highlighting the significance of HFM specificity and of the TAF9-H3 similarity. Human TAF9 and the related factor, TAF9L, both restored essential functions of cTAF9 in DT40 cells. To study TAF9L expression further, we show that reduction of hTAF9L expression in HeLa cells by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) results in cell death. Interestingly, reduction of hTAF9L expression significantly induced transcription from several promoters, suggesting that TAF9L functions in transcriptional repression. Plamid Constructs—Mutant or chimeric cDNAs used in complementation experiments were generated by PCR. Human and Drosophila TAF9 cDNAs were kind gifts from Dr. R. Tjian. The HFM from cTAF9 and the CR from dTAF9 were subcloned into pKS(+) (Stratagene) via three-fragment ligation to create cTAF9(HFM)-dCR. To make cDNAs encoding chimeric TAF9 proteins containing HFMs from dTAF9, hTAF12, hTAF6, or chicken H3, the flu tag sequence and the cTAF9 CT region were first inserted into pKS(+) to make pflu-CT. HFMs, either PCR-amplified from cDNAs or cloned by RT-PCR, were inserted into pflu-CT. Single and triple point mutants of cTAF9 were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The chimeric hTAF6 cDNA containing cTAF9 HFM (cTAF9-ΔhTAF6) was created by replacing the dTAF9 CR region in the cTAF9(HFM)-dCR with a fragment of hTAF6 cDNA (kindly provided by Drs. P. Vikas and R. Roeder) corresponding to amino acids 89–677. Human TAF9L cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. H. Song. The above cDNAs were subcloned into expression vectors pAPSV-zeo (60Chen, Z., and Manley, J. L. (2003) Mol. Cell Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar) and/or PA-puro (33Chen Z. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5064-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), except that cTAF9-ΔhTAF6 was inserted into the expression vector pSV-Brs. The luciferase reporter constructs containing core or enhancer-containing promoters and the expression vector encoding TAF9 fused to three copies of the FLAG tag at the C terminus are described elsewhere (60Chen, Z., and Manley, J. L. (2003) Mol. Cell Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfections—Chicken DT40-TAF9 cells were maintained and transfected by either electroporation as previously described (33Chen Z. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5064-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's manual. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections of HeLa and 293 cells were carried out using standard CaPO4 method. For stable transfections of HeLa cells, 10 μg of linearized plasmid DNAs were incubated with cells from one 100-mm dish at 70% confluency in 0.7 ml of Hepes-buffered saline, and mixtures were electroporated at 250 V/950 uF. Two days later, cells were plated out to eight 100-mm dishes in selective media. Blasticidin (Calbiochem) and Zeocin (Invitrogen) were used at 10 μg/ml and 200 μg/ml, respectively. Protein and RNA Analyses—Western blotting and RNase protection analyses were carried out as previously described (33Chen Z. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5064-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Northern blotting analysis was carried out by standard procedures. Briefly, 15–50 μg of total RNAs were run on formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with 2 × 106 cpm/ml probe. Luciferase reporter assays were carried out as recommended (Promega) using a luminometer (Berthold). Briefly, 24–36 colonies of transfected HeLa cells were picked by cloning disks (Scienceware) from each transfection and analyzed for luciferase expression. Selected clones, with either median or high luciferase activities, were treated with siRNAs for 3.5 days prior to luciferase assays. Coimmunoprecipitation—Mini-nuclear extracts were prepared as followed: 3 × 107 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in hypotonic buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and rocked at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, supernatants were collected. For cells expressing hTAF6-CT or H3-CT, the above protocol did not yield quantitative solubilization of these chimeras. Whole-cell extracts of these cells were prepared as previously described (34Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Nature. 1994; 372: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Anti-TBP antibodies, including mAb 3G3 (0.5 μl of ascites/IP) (35Brou C. Chaudhary S. Davidson I. Lutz Y. Wu J. Egly J.M. Tora L. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and the polyclonal sc-273 (4 μg/IP, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), were cross-linked to protein G or A-Sepharose beads, respectively, using dimethylpimelimidate as described (36Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 522-523Google Scholar). The above mini-nuclear extracts or WCEs were diluted 1:1 with an IP binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.04% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) and incubated with antibody-conjugated beads for 4 h to overnight. After washing four times with the IP binding buffer, the beads were resuspended in sample buffer and loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels. Efficient expression of proteins of interest was confirmed in all experiments by Western blots, and in all cases at least two independent clones expressing the same exogenous protein at levels similar to or higher than those of TAF9 were subjected to co-IP analysis. TBP IP Western blots were routinely carried out, and similar IP efficiency was confirmed in all experiments. SiRNA Transfections and Analyses of Cell Growth—Design, reconstitution, and transfection of siRNAs were conducted essentially as described (37Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) with several modifications. Briefly, a TAF9L-specific nucleotide sequence just downstream of the conserved region was chosen for designing the siRNA specific for TAF9L (Dharmacon). After reconstitution, 4 μl of 20 mm siRNA duplex were transfected with 4 μl of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) into HeLa cells that were seeded at 2 × 104/well in 24-well plates 24 h before. Cotransfection of plasmid DNAs and siRNAs was carried out essentially as described (38Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 943-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Microscopy images were taken using a NIKON Diaphot 300 microscope. DNA fragmentation analysis was performed as previously described (39Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3514) Google Scholar). TAF9 Depletion Disrupts TFIID Complexes—Previously we showed that depletion of TAF9 in DT40-TAF9 cells resulted in significant codepletion of several other TAFs (33Chen Z. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5064-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). An important question was whether this also reflected the composition of TFIID: is TFIID disrupted by TAF9 depletion, or does it stay relatively intact such that only the levels of free TAFs are reduced? To distinguish between these possibilities, coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments using an anti-TBP mAb (35Brou C. Chaudhary S. Davidson I. Lutz Y. Wu J. Egly J.M. Tora L. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) were performed with extracts from DT40-TAF9 cells grown in the presence of tet (1 μg/ml) for 0, 36, and 72 h, and precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1). As observed previously (33Chen Z. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5064-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), only a slight reduction in TBP protein levels was observed upon TAF9 depletion (Input, top panel), whereas TAF7 (and several other TAFs) protein levels were significantly reduced. Among the TAFs tested, only TAF5 protein levels were not affected, even after 72 h of incubation in 10 μg/ml tet (Fig. 1 and data not shown) (33Chen Z. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5064-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Importantly, depletion of TAF9 from cell extracts coincided with its efficient removal from TFIID (IP). Strikingly, not only TAF7 but also TAF5 showed significant dissociation from TBP after 36 h in tet and were nearly undetectable by 72 h. This co-dissociation of TAF7 was especially remarkable given that it does not seem to interact directly with TAF9 (40Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). These results suggest that depletion of TAF9 significantly compromises TFIID complex integrity, likely leading to dissociation of the majority of TAFs from TBP. Coupled with our previous results indicating that RNAP II transcription is not significantly reduced after 72 h of tet treatment, these findings indicate that an intact TFIID complex is not generally required to maintain high levels of transcription. Dissection of TAF9 Functional Domains—The above results underscore the important role of TAF9 in TFIID complex integrity, and despite the fact that it is not generally required for transcription, TAF9 is essential for cell viability (33Chen Z.

To understand further the in vivo functions of TAF9, we next examined the role of TAF9 structural domains in supporting cell viability and TFIID complex assembly. To this end, we employed DT40-TAF9 cells for the following genetic complementation analysis: cDNAs encoding proteins of interest were cloned into an expression vector with a selectable marker (zeocin, or zeo), and DT40-TAF9 cells were transfected with these expression vectors and selected either in tet for surviving colonies or in zeo for clones expressing the protein of interest, which were then grown in tet to determine cell viability. Both selection methods gave consistent results in all cases. As shown in Fig. 2, mock (no DNA) or empty vector transfections resulted in no surviving colonies in tet, whereas chicken TAF9 (cTAF9) itself gave rise to high numbers of surviving colonies, validating this approach. To examine TFIID incorporation, co-IP experiments with the anti-TBP mAb were carried out with extracts prepared from clones expressing the protein of interest at levels comparable with or higher than those of TAF9. High and very similar IP efficiency in all experiments was confirmed by TBP Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A and data not shown). The C-terminal tail region of vertebrate TAF9 (TL), although accounting for almost one half of the protein and highly conserved between chicken and human, is not similar in sequence to the corresponding region in Drosophila TAF9 and is completely missing in yeast TAF9. When a C terminus-truncated cTAF9 mutant (cTAF9M1) was expressed in DT40-TAF9 cells, the cells grew normally in tet, and cTAF9M1 was incorporated efficiently into TFIID (Fig. 2A). In sharp contrast, deletion of the highly conserved HFM flanking region (CR), despite its relatively small size and lack of detectable secondary structure, resulted in a protein that was completely unable to rescue cell viability and was not incorporated into TFIID (cTAF9M2). A more limited truncation of the CR and complete removal of the C-terminal tail (cTAF9M3) resulted in a slow growth phenotype and significantly decreased TFIID incorporation efficiency relative to that of cTAF9. These results indicate that the CR, but not the C-terminal tail, plays an essential role in cell growth and TFIID complex assembly. Next we examined evolutionary conservation of TAF9. As expected, the highly similar human TAF9 (hTAF9; 86% identical in amino acid sequence) protein supported cell growth in tet and TFIID incorporation. Surprisingly, however, the number of hTAF9 colonies selected in tet was consistently lower than observed with cTAF9 despite similar protein expression levels (compare Fig. 2, A and B; data not shown), indicating that the minor sequence differences between hTAF9 and cTAF9 compromise hTAF9 function in DT40-TAF9 cells. Drosophila TAF9 (dTAF9), with significantly reduced sequence similarity (41% identity), failed to support cell growth and was not incorporated into TFIID (Fig. 2B). dTAF9 was shown to interact with hTAF6 in vitro (41Weinzierl R.O. Ruppert S. Dynlacht B.D. Tanese N. Tjian R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5303-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); our results thus suggest that other interactions are required for incorporation into TFIID. The inability of dTAF9 to function was not because of any negative effects from the long, non-conserved C-terminal tail, because a dTAF9 mutant lacking the tail also did not support cell growth or TFIID incorporation (Fig. 2B). Interestingly though, a chimeric dTAF9 containing the CR and C-terminal tail from cTAF9 (dTAF9-cCT) supported cell survival, as did a chimeric cTAF9 containing the CR from dTAF9 (cTAF9-dCR), although both chimeras displayed reduced TFIID incorporation efficiency and yielded fewer colonies than did cTAF9 (Fig. 2C, compare IP lanes with input lanes). These findings suggest the existence of a functional cooperation between the HFM and CR. Previous coexpression experiments in E. coli have established that specific pairwise TAF-TAF interactions are mediated through the HFMs (5Gangloff Y.G. Romier C. Thuault S. Werten S. Davidson I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 250-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To understand further how specific HFM interactions contribute to TFIID assembly, we next examined whether substituting the TAF9 HFM with HFMs from other TAFs generates functional TAFs. HFMs from hTAF12 (H2B-like) and hTAF6 (H4-like) were used to replace the cTAF9 HFM to make hTAF12-CT and hTAF6-CT, respectively (Fig. 3A). Although cells expressing these chimeras displayed normal growth rate in the absence of tet, both chimeric proteins failed to support cell growth upon cTAF9 depletion, emphasizing the essential role of the cTAF9 HFM in cell viability. Unexpectedly, however, both chimeras associated with TBP under normal growth conditions, indicating that they can be incorporated into TFIID. Significantly, cTAF9 depletion dramatically reduced the levels and TBP association of both chimeras (Fig. 3A), similar to the behavior of most other natural TAFs (Fig. 1; Ref. 33Chen Z. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5064-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), indicating that incorporation of the chimeras into TFIID was TAF9-dependent. By contrast, a chimeric hTAF6 with the cTAF9 HFM replacing the TAF6 HFM (cTAF9-ΔhTAF6) failed to rescue viability or, significantly, to associate with TBP (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, cotransfection of cTAF9-ΔhTAF6 and hTAF6-CT did not result in surviving colonies in tet or TFIID incorporation (data not shown). These results together indicate that in some cases distinct HFMs can function generically with respect to directing incorporation into TFIID but that they have distinct, TAF-specific functions beyond this. TAF9 and H3 HFMs are Functionally Related—Although the cTAF9 HFM is most similar to that of histone 3, the HFMs from these two proteins display only low sequence identity (28%), and, for example, the conserved Arg residues in histones that contact DNA are absent in all TAFs (14Luger K.
