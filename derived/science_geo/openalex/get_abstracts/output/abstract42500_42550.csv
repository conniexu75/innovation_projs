https://openalex.org/W1533778697,"Transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell lines were developed that expressed equivalent numbers of either normal human receptor or receptor that had alanine substituted for Lys-1018 in the ATP-binding domain of the beta subunit. The mutated receptor was processed into subunits and bound insulin but lacked protein tyrosine kinase activity. Five effects of insulin were assayed: deoxyglucose uptake, S6 kinase activity, endogenous protein-tyrosine phosphorylation, glycogen synthesis, and thymidine uptake. In each case, cells bearing normal human receptors were 10-100-fold more sensitive to insulin than the parental cells. Cells with the mutant receptor behaved like the parental cells with respect to S6 kinase activation, endogenous substrate phosphorylation, glycogen synthesis, and thymidine uptake, but their deoxyglucose uptake was significantly depressed and relatively insensitive to insulin. The analyses led to the following conclusions: substitution of alanine for lysine at amino acid 1018 inactivates the kinase activity of the receptor; a kinase-negative receptor can be properly processed and bind insulin; insulin-dependent deoxyglucose uptake, S6 kinase activation, endogenous substrate phosphorylation, glycogen synthesis, and thymidine incorporation into DNA are mediated by the normal but not by the kinase-deficient human receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2009373735,"Lysosphingolipids potently and reversibly inhibited protein kinase C activity and binding of phorbol dibutyrate in vitro and in human platelets. As with activation of protein kinase C by phosphatidylserine and sn-1,2-diacylglycerol, inhibition was subject to surface dilution. Accordingly, inhibition in mixed micelle assays was dependent on the molar percentage of lysosphingolipids rather than the bulk concentration. Lysosphingolipids inhibited protein kinase C activity at molar percentages similar to those required for activation by phosphatidylserine and sn-1,2-diacylglycerol. Since lysosphingolipids accumulate in Krabbe's disease, Gaucher's disease, and other sphingolipidoses, the hypothesis that lysosphingolipid inhibition of protein kinase C represents the missing functional link between the accumulation of sphingolipids and the pathogenesis of these disorders appears to unify existing data. The accumulation of lysosphingolipids would cause progressive dysfunction of signal transduction mechanisms vital for neural transmission, differentiation, development, and proliferation and would eventually lead to cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2062042301,"Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) is a powerful growth and differentiation factor which acts on hematopoietic progenitor cells and also activates differentiated granulocytes and macrophages. This study shows that mouse peritoneal macrophages can be induced to accumulate GM-CSF mRNA and to release GM-CSF by inflammatory agents (lipopolysaccharide, fetal calf serum, thioglycolate broth); phagocytosis; and adherence in the presence of fibronectin. GM-CSF mRNA accumulation, which is totally prevented by the corticosteroid dexamethasone and by interferon-gamma, is not accompanied by changes in the gene's transcriptional level. No interleukin 3 (multi-CSF) mRNA is detectable in induced macrophages. These findings have implications in the understanding of hematopoiesis and of the inflammation and repair process."
https://openalex.org/W1499695147,"Mg2+ interacts with the alpha subunits of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) in the presence of guanosine-5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP-gamma S) to form a highly fluorescent complex from which nucleotide dissociates very slowly. The apparent Kd for interaction of G alpha X GTP gamma S with Mg2+ is approximately 5 nM, similar to the Km for G protein GTPase activity X G beta gamma increases the rate of dissociation of GTP gamma S from G alpha X GTP gamma S or G alpha X GTP gamma S X Mg2+ at low concentrations of Mg2+. When the concentration of Mg2+ exceeds 1 mM, G beta gamma dissociates from G beta gamma X G alpha X GTP gamma S X Mg2+. Compared with the dramatic effect of Mg2+ on binding of GTP gamma S to G alpha, the metal has relatively little effect on the binding of GDP. However, G beta gamma increases the affinity of G alpha for GDP by more than 100-fold. High concentrations of Mg2+ promote the dissociation of GDP from G beta gamma X G alpha X GDP, apparently without causing subunit dissociation. The steady-state rate of GTP hydrolysis is strictly correlated with the rate of dissociation of GDP from G alpha under all conditions examined. Thus, there are at least two sites for interaction of Mg2+ with G protein-nucleotide complexes. Furthermore, binding of G beta gamma and GTP gamma S to G alpha is negatively cooperative, while the binding interaction between G beta gamma and GDP is strongly positive."

https://openalex.org/W1534834744,"The substrate specificity of protein kinase C has been examined using a series of synthetic peptide analogs of glycogen synthase, ribosomal protein S6, and the epidermal growth factor receptor. The glycogen synthase analog peptide Pro1-Leu-Ser-Arg-Thr-Leu-Ser-Val-Ala-Ala10 was phosphorylated at Ser7 with a Km of 40.3 microM. Peptide phosphorylation was strongly dependent on Arg4. When lysine was substituted for Arg4 the Km was increased approximately 20-fold. Addition of basic residues on either the NH2-terminal or COOH-terminal side of the phosphorylation site of the glycogen synthase peptide improved the kinetics of peptide phosphorylation. The analog Pro-Leu-Ser-Arg-Thr-Leu-Ser-Val-Ala-Ala-Lys-Lys was phosphorylated with a Km of 4.1 microM. Substitution of Ser7 with threonine increased the apparent Km to 151 microM. The truncated peptide Pro1-Leu-Ser-Arg-Thr-Leu-Ser-Val8 was phosphorylated with similar kinetic constants to the parent peptide, however, deletion of Val8 increased the apparent Km to 761 microM. The ribosomal peptide S6-(229-239) was phosphorylated with a Km of approximately 0.5 microM predominantly on Ser236 and is one of the most potent synthetic peptide substrates reported for a protein kinase. The apparent Km for S6 peptide phosphorylation was increased by either deletion of the NH2-terminal 3 residues Ala229-Arg-231 or by substitution of Arg238 on the COOH-terminal side of the phosphorylation site with alanine. This analog peptide, [Ala238]S6-(229-239) was phosphorylated with an approximate 6-fold reduction in Vmax and a switch in the preferred site of phosphorylation from Ser236 to Ser235. These results support the concept that basic residues on both sides of the phosphorylation site can have an important influence on the kinetics of phosphorylation and site specificity of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W2073141598,"Liver damage induced by the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) is believed to be mediated by an unsaturated metabolite of the drug, delta 4-VPA. In studies of the biological origin of this hepatotoxic compound, it was found that liver microsomes from phenobarbital-treated rats catalyzed the desaturation of VPA to delta 4-VPA. Indirect evidence suggested that cytochrome P-450 was the responsible enzyme, a conclusion that was verified by studies with a purified and reconstituted form of the hemoprotein, which catalyzed the oxidation of VPA to 4- and 5-hydroxyvalproic acid and to delta 4-VPA. Desaturation of a nonactivated alkyl substituent represents a novel metabolic function of cytochrome P-450 and probably proceeds via the conversion of substrate to a transient free radical intermediate, which partitions between recombination (alcohol formation) and elimination (olefin production) pathways. These findings have broad implications with respect to the metabolic generation of olefins and may explain the increased hepatotoxic potential of VPA when it is administered in combination with potent enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital."
https://openalex.org/W1994152829,"The messenger RNA (mRNA) that encodes alpha subunit of the guanosine triphosphate-binding protein transducin (T alpha) and T alpha immunoreactivity were localized and measured in the rat retina during the light-dark cycle with in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Both T alpha mRNA and T alpha immunoreactivity were observed only in photoreceptors. Within the photoreceptor T alpha mRNA was present primarily in the inner segments and to a lesser extent in the outer nuclear layer at all times during the day and night. However, the distribution of T alpha immunoreactivity varied profoundly with the light-dark cycle; during the day, T alpha immunoreactivity was highest in the inner segments, and at night the outer segments were more immunoreactive. The amounts of T alpha mRNA and T alpha immunoreactivity also depended on the light-dark cycle. Levels of T alpha mRNA were high immediately before and after lights on; levels were low for the rest of the light-dark cycle. During the day, T alpha immunoreactivity increased in the inner segments following the increase in T alpha mRNA. After the lights were turned off, T alpha immunoreactivity decreased in the inner segments and increased in the outer segments. Thus, it appears that T alpha is synthesized in the inner segments after a morning increase in T alpha mRNA. Newly synthesized T alpha remains in the inner segments until it is transported to the outer segments at night, where it may be involved in the increase in the sensitivity of photoreceptor rods at night."
https://openalex.org/W1604015258,"We have used platelets permeabilized with saponin to examine the mechanism by which platelet activation causes the exposure of surface receptors for fibrinogen. Receptor exposure was detected using 125I-fibrinogen and 125I-PAC1, a monoclonal antibody specific for the activated form of the fibrinogen receptor. The potential mediators that were studied included guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) and guanosine 5'O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S), which cause G protein-dependent phospholipase C activation in platelets; inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), which causes Ca2+ release from the platelet dense tubular system; and diacylglycerol and phorbol ester, which activate protein kinase C. Each of these molecules caused fibrinogen and PAC1 binding. The effect of IP3 was mimicked by raising the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in the permeabilized platelets. However, IP3 and Ca2+-induced PAC1 binding were abolished by indomethacin or aspirin, which had no effect on PAC1 binding caused by Gpp(NH)p, phorbol ester, or diacylglycerol. This suggests that the response to IP3 and Ca2+ is due to the formation of metabolites of arachidonic acid. One such metabolite, TxA2, is believed to activate platelets by stimulating G protein-dependent phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Indeed, we found that the G protein inhibitor guanyl-5'-yl thiophosphate (GDP beta S) inhibited PAC1 binding caused by a thromboxane A2 analog (U46619), IP3, and Ca2+, but had no effect on diacylglycerol or phorbol ester-induced PAC1 binding. Thrombin-induced PAC1 binding and phosphoinositide hydrolysis were also inhibited by GDP beta S and by pertussis toxin. Increasing the thrombin concentration overcame the inhibition of PAC1 binding caused by GDP beta S but did not overcome the inhibition of phosphoinositide hydrolysis. These observations demonstrate that fibrinogen receptor exposure occurs by at least two routes. One of these, in response to agonists such as thrombin and U46619, is initiated by G protein-dependent phosphoinositide hydrolysis and involves the formation of IP3 and diacylglycerol. IP3 appears to act by stimulating Ca2+-dependent arachidonic acid metabolism which, in turn, triggers further phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Diacylglycerol acts by stimulating protein kinase C. A second route is activated by high concentrations of thrombin and is independent of phosphoinositide hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1596621826,"The formation of prostaglandins by prostaglandin H synthase can be limited by the availability of the fatty acid substrate or the hydroperoxide activator and also by a self-catalyzed inactivation associated with the oxygenation reaction. Each pmol of synthase appeared able to form only about 1300 pmol of prostaglandin from arachidonate before it was inactivated. This extent of synthesis was not diminished when substrate fatty acid was complexed with cytosolic proteins even though the velocity of the oxygenation reaction was greatly decreased by the lower availability of substrate acid. When the availability of hydroperoxide activator was decreased by added glutathione peroxidase, the extent of oxygenation per mol of synthase was decreased irrespective of the amount of cytosolic protein present. Approximately 65% of the total prostaglandin synthesis by homogenates was suppressed with a glutathione peroxidase to prostaglandin H synthase ratio of about 90. The remaining prostaglandin synthetic activity was more resistant, being completely suppressed only when the ratio of peroxidase to synthase exceeded 750. The overall ratio of glutathione peroxidase (peroxide-removing) capacity to prostaglandin synthetic (peroxide-forming) capacity in selected tissues ranged from over 1800 in rat liver to less than 30 in leukocytes. A comparison between the daily urinary output of prostaglandin metabolites and tissue prostaglandin synthetic capacity suggested that prostaglandin H synthase inactivation along with glutathione peroxidase suppression of the extent of prostaglandin synthase may be important in limiting prostaglandin biosynthesis within cells."
https://openalex.org/W1487679352,"Exposure of A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells to epidermal growth factor (EGF), bradykinin, and histamine resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent accumulation of the inositol phosphates (InsP) inositol monophosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol trisphosphate (InsP3). Maximal concentrations of EGF (316 ng/ml; approximately 50 nM), bradykinin (1 microM), and histamine (1 mM) resulted in 3-, 6-, and 3-fold increases, respectively, in the amounts of inositol phosphates formed over a 10-min period. The K0.5 values for stimulation were approximately 10 nM, 3 nM, and 10 microM for EGF, bradykinin, and histamine, respectively. EGF and bradykinin stimulated the rapid accumulation of the two isomers of InsP3, Ins(1,3,4)P3, and Ins(1,4,5)P3 as determined by high performance liquid chromatography analysis; maximal accumulation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 occurred within 15 s. EGF and bradykinin also stimulated a rapid (maximal levels attained within 30 s after addition of hormone) and a sustained 4- and 6-fold rise, respectively, in cytosolic free Ca2+ levels as measured by Fura-2 fluorescence. EGF and bradykinin also produced a rapid, although transient, 3- and 5-fold increase, respectively, in cytosolic free Ca2+ after chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with 3 mM EGTA. These data are consistent with the idea that EGF elevates intracellular Ca2+ levels in A431 cells, at least in part, as a result of the rapid formation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and the consequential release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores."
https://openalex.org/W2133226609,"The intensity of the tryptophan fluorescence of the alpha subunits of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins increases when they bind guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (GTY gamma S). The kinetics of the fluorescence enhancement and of the measured binding of [35S]GTP gamma S are well correlated. The addition of Mg2+ to the nucleotide-bound proteins causes a further, rapid increase in the fluorescence intensity. Similar effects result from exposure of the proteins to F- and Mg2+, and the required concentration of F- is reduced by the inclusion of Al3+. It is presumed that the more highly fluorescent state of the G protein alpha subunits represents their active conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1587717751,"We have recently shown that the domain of von Willebrand factor (vWF) which interacts with the platelet glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) is located in a 52/48-kDa tryptic fragment of the molecule which begins with amino acid residue Val-449. We have now established that the fragment extends to residue Lys-728 and demonstrate here that a high affinity heparin-binding domain of vWF also lies within this region and in close proximity to that for GPIb. We have used an assay employing heparin coupled to Sepharose CL-6B to show that 125I-vWF binds to heparin in a time-dependent, saturable, and reversible manner. Binding could be completely inhibited by the 52/48-kDa fragment, but was not affected by other tryptic fragments of 55, 41, 13, and 22 kDa. NH2-terminal sequencing of these fragments showed that they were derived from different parts of the molecule, as follows: 13 kDa, Gln290-Thr-Met-Val-Asp-Ser-Ser; 55 kDa, Asn730-Ser-Met-Val-Leu-Asp-Val-Ala-Phe-Val-Leu-Glu; 41 kDa, Thr1352-Val-Gln-Arg-Pro-Gly-Gln-Thr-Cys-Gln-Pro-Ile-Leu-Glu-Glu-Gl n-Cys-Leu-Val ; 22 kDa, Val1927-Thr-Gly-Cys-Pro-Pro. Direct binding of the purified 52/48-kDa fragment to heparin-Sepharose was also shown. Furthermore, crossed immunoelectrophoresis revealed complex formation between the purified 52/48-kDa fragment and free heparin. Twelve monoclonal antibodies to the 52/48-kDa fragment were evaluated for their ability to block binding of 125I-vWF to heparin. With the exception of one weak inhibitor of heparin binding, their relative efficacy in blocking heparin binding was similar to that for blocking ristocetin-induced binding to GPIb. However heparin failed to block ristocetin-independent binding of the 52/48-kDa fragment to GPIb. It is therefore likely that the two binding domains are adjacent to one another, but are not precisely congruent."
https://openalex.org/W2103138603,"We have used an in vitro assay to characterize some of the motile properties of sea urchin egg kinesin. Egg kinesin is purified via 5'-adenylyl imidodiphosphate-induced binding to taxol-assembled microtubules, extraction from the microtubules in ATP, and gel filtration chromatography (Scholey, J. M., Porter, M. E., Grissom, P. M., and McIntosh, J. R. (1985) Nature 318, 483-486). This partially purified kinesin is then adsorbed to a glass coverslip, mixed with microtubules and ATP, and viewed by video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy. The microtubule translocating activity of the purified egg kinesin is qualitatively similar to the analogous activity observed in crude extracts of sea urchin eggs and resembles the activity of neuronal kinesin with respect to both the maximal rate (greater than 0.5 micron/s) and the direction of movement. Axonemes glide on a kinesin-coated coverslip toward their minus ends, and kinesin-coated beads translocate toward the plus ends of centrosome microtubules. Sea urchin egg kinesin is inhibited by high concentrations of SH reagents ([N-ethylmaleimide] greater than 3-5 mM), vanadate greater than 50 microM, and [nonhydrolyzable nucleotides] greater than or equal to [MgATP]. The nucleotide requirement of sea urchin egg kinesin is fairly broad (ATP greater than GTP greater than ITP), and the rate of microtubule movement increases in a saturable fashion with the [ATP]. We conclude that the motile activity of egg kinesin is indistinguishable from that of neuronal kinesin. We propose that egg kinesin may be associated with microtubule-based motility in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1595315589,"The activities of GTP-dependent regulatory proteins (G proteins) are modulated by anions. Thus, NaCl stimulated the intensity of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of Go alpha with bound guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) and GTP, but not GDP. This mimics the effect of Mg2+. The salt also increased the affinity of Go alpha for GTP gamma S and GTP, but not GDP, an effect primarily due to decreases in rates of dissociation of the nucleotides. Among the effects of NaCl on the hydrolysis of GTP was an inhibition of the catalytic rate. The modulation of these activities occurred with half-maximal effects in the range of 3-20 mM NaCl. Salts of both chloride and bromide increased the affinity of Go alpha for GTP gamma S; fluoride and iodide were essentially ineffective. Nitrates produced only small and variable effects while SO4(2-) always reduced the affinity. The different cations utilized altered the effect of the anions slightly. The demonstration of direct effects of anions on the alpha subunit of Go suggests that G proteins are one site of action for anion modulation of systems that utilize these proteins. The effects of chloride at modest concentrations suggest potential physiological importance. Chloride may allow activation of G proteins with GTP in the absence of Mg2+ and without subsequent hydrolysis of the nucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1529389226,"The major macromolecular component of the porcine oocyte zona pellucida is a Mr = 55,000 antigen, termed ZP3, comprised of greater than 25 charge isomers. ZP3 was purified to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity from nonreduced, sodium dodecyl sulfate-treated porcine zonae pellucidae by chromatography on Sephacryl S-400 and hydroxylapatite resins. The carbohydrate moiety of purified ZP3 was comprised of a heterogeneous population of acidic lactosaminoglycans as evidenced by the saccharide composition and size distribution of glycopeptides produced by Pronase digestion of ZP3, as well as by the sensitivity of ZP3 to digestion with Escherichia freundii endo-beta-galactosidase. Endo-beta-galactosidase-digested ZP3 was resolved by gel electrophoresis into two components, termed alpha-glycoprotein and beta-glycoprotein, with Mr values (nonreduced) of 46,000 and 42,000, respectively. Each was comprised of fewer and more neutral charge isomers than ZP3. Following purification by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, the alpha- and beta-glycoproteins of endo-beta-galactosidase-digested ZP3 were distinguished on the basis of amino acid and carbohydrate compositions, amino-terminal sequence analyses and peptide mapping experiments, thus suggesting differences in the primary structures of their respective polypeptide moieties. Corresponding dissimilarities in the immunoreactivities of the alpha- and beta-glycoproteins toward polyclonal antisera raised against ZP3, alpha-glycoprotein, and beta-glycoprotein were revealed by competitive binding radioimmunoassays as well as by immunoblotting experiments. Collectively, the data were interpreted to indicate that the Mr = 55,000 antigen of porcine oocyte zona pellucida is in fact comprised of overlapping families of charge isomers corresponding to two structurally and immunologically distinct lactosaminoglycan-containing glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1598395017,"Linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, prostaglandin E1, and prostaglandin E2 stimulated the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells in serum-free primary cultures only in the presence of epidermal growth factor. Linoleate-stimulated growth was manifest later in culture when proliferation, initiated by epidermal growth factor only, reached a plateau while linoleate-supplemented epidermal growth factor cultures continued to proliferate. The cultures in the plateau phase of growth could be restimulated to grow by adding either linoleic acid or prostaglandin E2 to the media. While the linoleate response could be abolished by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, prostaglandin E2-stimulated growth remained unaffected. Linoleic acid was metabolized to arachidonic acid and prostaglandin E2, both in the growing and resting cultures. Proliferating cells metabolized linoleate and prostaglandin E2 extensively so that neither the fatty acid nor prostaglandin E2 accumulated in large quantities in the proliferating cultures. The concentrations of prostaglandin E2 in growing cultures supplemented with linoleic acid were much higher than in cultures without it. These results suggest that the metabolism of linoleic acid leading to prostaglandin production, not its contribution to membrane polyunsaturation, is necessary for sustained growth of mammary epithelial cells in the presence of epidermal growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W1582556784,"Mass changes in the various molecular species of phospholipids were determined after stimulation of human platelets with thrombin and collagen. Upon stimulation, every molecular species of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine was equally hydrolyzed, whereas the molecular species of phosphatidylcholine and diacyl- and alkenylacylphosphatidylethanolamine containing arachidonic acid were selectively hydrolyzed. At low Ca2+ concentrations, which result from mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine, and diacylphosphatidylethanolamine were hydrolyzed after stimulation with thrombin, whereas only phosphatidylinositol was hydrolyzed with production of thromboxane B2 after stimulation with collagen. At high Ca2+ concentrations, phosphatidylcholine and diacylphosphatidylethanolamine were hydrolyzed after stimulation with collagen, and phosphatidylserine and alkenylacylphosphatidylethanolamine were degraded after stimulation with both thrombin and collagen. [1-14C]Arachidonic acid was heterogeneously incorporated into the individual molecular species of the various phospholipid classes, indicating that the determination of mass is essential for an accurate picture of phospholipid hydrolysis. The data reported here indicate that the Ca2+ concentration affects the differential degradation of phospholipid molecular species in activated human platelets."

https://openalex.org/W1608814723,"A nerve growth factor (NGF)-sensitive S6 kinase was purified by alkaline lysis of PC12 cells. The activity in lysates from NGF-treated cells was 10-20-fold higher than that from controls. Half-maximal stimulation of the S6 kinase by NGF treatment occurred in approximately 5 min, and the activity returned almost to basal levels by 2 h. A rapid purification method was devised in which crude extract was applied directly to a PBE 94 column after buffer exchange on a PD-10 column (Sephadex G-25 M). The activated S6 kinase was purified at least 673-fold with a recovery of approximately 70%. The S6 kinase has an apparent molecular weight of 45,000 and is highly specific for S6. It is not inhibited by the specific inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinases, or by chlorpromazine or sodium vanadate, nor is it activated by Ca2+/calmodulin. It was inhibited by EGTA, beta-glycerophosphate, or NaF. Phosphorylation occurred solely on serine residues. The S6 kinase activity from control cells and from NGF-treated cells eluted at pH 5.69 and 5.58, respectively, during PBE 94 column chromatography. Pretreatment of crude extract from NGF-stimulated cells with alkaline phosphatase resulted in an elution of the enzyme at the position of S6 kinase from control cells and a concomitant decrease in activity. These results indicate that phosphorylation is involved in the mechanism of S6 kinase activation."
https://openalex.org/W1552867332,"Splenic lymphocytes from mice immunized with a partially purified prostaglandin (PG) H-PGE isomerase from sheep vesicular glands were fused with SP2/0-Ag14 myeloma cells. Two spleen cell-myeloma hybrids (hei-7 and hei-26) were selected and cloned. The mouse antibodies secreted by the two hybrids, IgG1 (hei-7) and IgG1 (hei-26), caused immunoprecipitation of a maximum of 45 and 22%, respectively, of the solubilized PGH-PGE isomerase activity of sheep vesicular gland; immunoprecipitation of activity by the two antibodies was additive. The antigens reactive with IgG1 (hei-7) and IgG1 (hei-26) were identified as proteins with Mr = 17,500 and 180,000, respectively, by Western transfer blotting or sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of immunoprecipitated 125I-labeled microsomes. The PGH-PGE isomerase activities precipitated by IgG1 (hei-7) and IgG1 (hei-26) exhibited different kinetic properties with respect to time course, Km for PGH2, and concentration dependence for GSH. No significant GSH-S-transferase activity was present in these immunoprecipitates. These data indicate that there are at least two different proteins in sheep vesicular gland microsomes capable of catalyzing GSH-dependent PGH-PGE isomerase reactions. IgG1 (hei-7), but not IgG1 (hei-26), caused coprecipitation of PGH synthase and PGH-PGE isomerase activities when incubated with intact right-side-out vesicular gland microsomes. Thus, the epitope for IgG1 (hei-7) is located on the cytoplasmic surface of those microsomal spheres which contain PGH synthase. This latter finding suggests that the isomerase reactive with IgG1 (hei-7) is involved in PGE synthesis in sheep vesicular glands."

https://openalex.org/W1603783081,"Whole rat liver nuclei were reacted with UDP-[14C]galactose in the presence of bovine beta(1----4) galactosyltransferase. The reaction mixture was electrophoresed on a reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. Autoradiograms of the gel demonstrated a major labeled broad band migrating with an apparent molecular weight of 65,000-66,000. A number of other less prominently labeled bands were also present. The labeled 65,000-66,000 band when cut from the gel and subjected to alkaline reduction while in the gel matrix exclusively yielded a 14C-labeled disaccharide that co-migrated with a [14C]Gal-GlcNAcol standard in descending paper chromatography. Treatment of this disaccharide with beta-galactosidase (beta-D-galactoside galactohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.23) from Aspergillus niger removed all the [14C]galactose label. Treatment of the labeled 65,000-66,000 polypeptide with Endoglycosidase F, however, did not remove the [14C]galactose label. Western transfer blots of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels performed with horseradish peroxidase-labeled succinyl wheat germ agglutinin, a lectin specific for GlcNAc, on unlabeled nuclei revealed a dominant band at 63,000-64,000. Subjecting 14C-labeled nuclei to this procedure resulted in a shift of the major horseradish peroxidase-labeled succinyl wheat germ agglutinin band to 65,000-66,000. The shifted band was coincident with the [14C]galactose band as visualized on an autoradiogram. A survey of other rat tissue nuclei revealed the same spectrum of [14C]galactose acceptor proteins with a dominant 65,000-66,000 galactose-labeled band."
https://openalex.org/W1506618346,"Purified and microsomal preparations of prostaglandin H synthase catalyzed the arachidonic acid-dependent polymerization of acetaminophen and, in the presence of GSH, catalyzed the formation of 3-(glutathion-S-yl)acetaminophen. The formation of these products was inhibited by indomethacin and by purging reaction mixtures with argon. When H2O2 replaced arachidonic acid, neither indomethacin nor argon purging inhibited product formation. These results suggest that the peroxidase activity of prostaglandin H synthase catalyzed the oxidation of acetaminophen. Addition of GSH to reaction mixtures decreased acetaminophen polymerization; however, 3-(glutathion-S-yl)acetaminophen formation was maximal with 40 microM GSH, and higher concentrations of GSH did not substantially alter its formation. In the presence of GSH, either ascorbic acid or NADPH decreased polymerization by greater than 97% while 3-(glutathion-S-yl)acetaminophen formation was still observed. These data suggest that polymers and conjugates were formed by two different pathways. Since polymerization of acetaminophen involves radical termination of N-acetyl-p-benzosemiquinone imine whereas 3-(glutathion-S-yl)acetaminophen is formed by conjugation of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine with GSH, the data suggest that prostaglandin H synthase catalyzed both the overall 1- and 2-electron oxidation of acetaminophen."
https://openalex.org/W1526354959,"Abstract In the mitochondria of Tetrahymena pyriformis ST, the large subunit ribosomal RNA (LSU rRNA) is discontinuous, consisting of two species, alpha (280 nucleotides in length) and beta (approximately equal to 2.45 kilobases long). LSU alpha is the 5'-terminal portion (i.e. a 5.8 S-like rRNA), and LSU beta constitutes the rest of this LSU rRNA, as judged by both primary and secondary structure homology to other LSU rRNAs. Remarkably, LSU alpha is encoded downstream of LSU beta, the two genes being separated by a tRNALeu gene. This is the first demonstration of a discontinuous rRNA whose coding sequences are rearranged, deviating from the conventional, highly conserved, 5'----3' order of sequence domains in the LSU rRNA gene. This novel gene organization (5'-LSU beta-2-base pair spacer-tRNALeu-10-base pair spacer-LSU alpha) is identical in both copies of the subterminal inverted repeat in the linear T. pyriformis mitochondrial genome. Sequence heterogeneity in the LSU alpha transcript and its genes, together with Northern hybridization data, suggest that both copies of the inverted repeat are expressed."

This disulfide was then condensed with DL-threonine phosphate using N-hydroxysuccinimide and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The product was reduced with dithiothreitol to give HS-HTP. It could be oxidized in air in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol to give the compound as it was isolated from cell extracts. The resulting product was identical to the authentic compound by 1H NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and coelution using high performance liquid chromatography. The synthetic compound is active in the in vitro methanogenic assay at concentrations comparable to the authentic compound. This confirms the structure of component B as HS-HTP and provides a means to synthesize quantities sufficient for studies of the methylreductase system."
https://openalex.org/W75471125,"Covalent cross-linking of radiolabeled mouse growth hormone (125I-mGH) with the homobifunctional cross-linking agent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) to microsomal membranes prepared from late pregnant mouse liver resulted in the labeling of three specific mGH binding proteins (receptors) with apparent Mr = 125,000, 62,000, and 56,000, as measured by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. These same three specifically labeled proteins were present, but with slightly lower apparent molecular weights, when samples were electrophoresed in the absence of reductant. Cross-linking of 125I-mGH to plasma membrane-enriched fractions of late pregnant mouse liver resulted only in the specific labeling of the two lower molecular weight receptors. Removal of all N-linked carbohydrate with peptide: N-glycosidase F resulted in decreasing the apparent molecular weights of the three receptor forms to 110,000, 50,000, and 46,000 for the 125,000, 62,000, and 56,000 molecular weight forms of the receptor, respectively. Smaller decreases in the molecular weights of all three receptor forms were also apparent after treatment with neuraminidase. However, the differences seen in the intact forms of the growth hormone receptor were also present in the deglycosylated receptors. The relationship between the three forms of the growth hormone receptor was further investigated by comparing the fragments produced by proteolytic digestion of the cross-linked receptors with Staphylococcus aureus protease and endoproteinase Lys-C. The fragments produced from all three receptor forms had very similar molecular weights, although there were slight molecular weight differences in the fragments produced by endoproteinase Lys-C digestion. The overall similarity of the fragments produced by the proteolytic digestions suggests that the three forms of the receptor are related."
https://openalex.org/W1504827503,"A class of Paramecium behavioral mutants called pantophobiacs have a deficiency in calcium-dependent potassium efflux, and this deficiency can be corrected by the microinjection of wild-type Paramecium calmodulin (Hinrichsen, R. D., Burgess-Cassler, A., Soltvelt, B. C., Hennessey, T., and Kung, C. (1986) Science 232, 503-506). As a starting point in investigations of which features allow wild-type Paramecium calmodulin to fully restore this behavior while other calmodulins are inactive or poorly effective, we elucidated the amino acid sequence of the wild-type calmodulin. We utilized an approach that combined Edman chemistry with mass spectrometry. This approach resulted in the identification of a new post-translational modification in calmodulin: N epsilon,N epsilon-dimethyllysine at residue 13. This particular modification has not been described for calmodulins studied previously. The only other first-domain modification that has been described for any calmodulin is acetylation of the amino terminus (Watterson, D. M., Sharief, F., and Vanaman, T. C. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 962-975). These results along with analyses of pantophobiac calmodulin and calmodulin binding proteins will provide insight into calmodulin's role in a well-defined behavioral mutant."
https://openalex.org/W48180253,"Granulosa cells from immature rats produce tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in response to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or luteinizing hormone (LH) both in vitro and in vivo. We have used the in vitro system to investigate the level at which the hormonal induction of tPA is regulated. Within 12 h following FSH addition, a dramatic but transient increase in tPA secretion occurs for by 24 h secretion returns to basal levels. This pattern of enzyme induction is similar with LH, but the onset of the increase is delayed. When steady-state tPA mRNA levels are examined after hormone treatment, the results mirror those obtained if one measures enzyme activity; a large increase in tPA mRNA followed by a decrease to basal levels is observed with both hormones, and the lag in induction by LH is also apparent. These results demonstrate that the regulation of tPA activity by gonadotropins occurs at the level of the steady-state concentration of the mRNA. In the presence of cycloheximide, the induction of tPA mRNA by FSH or LH is not greatly affected, indicating that this phase of the response to gonadotropins does not require the synthesis of new protein. However, the decrease in tPA mRNA levels observed 24 h after FSH treatment is affected by cycloheximide, in that the drug delays the reduction in mRNA levels seen with hormone alone."
https://openalex.org/W1591153919,"Synapsin I, a major neuron-specific substrate for cAMP-dependent and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, associates in in vitro assays with brain integral membrane protein site(s) distinct from secretory vesicles and with the neurofilament Mr = 68,000 subunit. The membrane sites for synapsin involve protein(s) and are likely to have physiological relevance since the binding of 125I-labeled synapsin is abolished by digestion with chymotrypsin, is displaced by unlabeled synapsin, is of high affinity (KD = 10 nM), and has a capacity (42 pmol/mg membrane protein) that is comparable to the amount of synapsin in brain, optimal binding occurs at physiological pH (6.8-7.2) and salt concentrations (50 mM), and synapsin binding to membranes is inhibited by phosphorylation with Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. The brain membrane protein sites for synapsin are not due to synaptic vesicles, since synaptic vesicles do not sediment under the conditions of the binding assay. Association between synapsin and the Mr = 68,000 neurofilament subunit has also been demonstrated. The binding of synapsin with the neurofilament subunit is specific since this binding interaction is saturable, with a 1:1 stoichiometry, the binding involves only certain proteolytically derived domains of synapsin, and is therefore not a simple electrostatic interaction between the basic domains of synapsin and the acidic regions in the neurofilament subunit, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of synapsin inhibits this interaction. Synapsin promotes cross-linking of synaptic vesicles to brain membranes, and these complexes are reduced by phosphorylation of synapsin. This interconnecting function of synapsin may be a general characteristic of synapsin binding, with a membrane (synaptic vesicle or nonsecretory vesicle)-bound synapsin associating with microtubules, neurofilaments, or spectrin."
https://openalex.org/W1583600599,"Affinity labeling and comparative sequence analyses have placed Lys-166 of ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from Rhodospirillum rubrum at the active site. The unusual nucleophilicity and acidity of the epsilon-amino group of Lys 166 (pKa = 7.9) suggest its involvement in catalysis, perhaps as the base that enolizes ribulosebisphosphate (Hartman, F.C., Milanez, S., and Lee, E.H. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 13968-13975). In attempts to clarify the role of Lys-166 of the carboxylase, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to replace this lysyl residue with glycine, alanine, serine, glutamine, arginine, cysteine, or histidine. All seven of these mutant proteins, purified by immunoaffinity chromatography, are severely deficient in carboxylase activity; the serine mutant, which is the most active, has a kcat only 0.2% that of the wild-type enzyme. Although low, the carboxylase activity displayed by some of the mutant proteins proves that Lys-166 is not required for substrate binding and argues that the detrimental effects brought about by amino acid substitutions at position 166 do not reflect gross conformational changes. As demonstrated by their ability to tightly bind a transition-state analogue (2-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate) in the presence of CO2 and Mg2+, some of the mutant proteins undergo the carbamylation reaction that is required for activation of the wild-type enzyme. Since Lys-166 is required neither for activation (i.e. carbamylation by CO2) nor for substrate binding, it must be essential to catalysis. When viewed within the context of previous related studies, the results of site-directed mutagenesis are entirely consistent with Lys-166 functioning as the base that initiates catalysis by abstracting the C-3 proton from ribulosebisphosphate. An alternative possibility that Lys-166 acts to stabilize a transition state in the reaction pathway cannot be rigorously excluded."
https://openalex.org/W1545585691,"A fraction of the 125I-thrombin that binds to human platelets is taken into a sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant 77 kDa complex with a factor (Bennett, W. F., and Glenn, K. C. (1980) Cell 22, 621-627). Here we show that this factor is in several respects similar to protease nexin I (PNI), a fibroblast thrombin inhibitor. The complexes are of the appropriate size, bind to Sepharose that has been derivatized with anti-PNI antibody, do not form when the thrombin active site has been blocked with diisopropylphosphofluoridate, and do not appear on platelets when heparin is present. However, the factor does not bind urokinase, indicating that this platelet may be distinct from PNI. Following brief incubation with 125I-thrombin, PN X 125I X thrombin complexes are found both associated with the platelets and free in the binding medium. 125I-Thrombin has a higher affinity for PN than for receptors. In 30-s binding incubations carried out with thrombin at concentrations below 0.3 nM, formation of the 77-kDa complex accounts for most of the specific binding of 125I-thrombin. Subtracting this large contribution to 125I-thrombin-specific binding reveals that the reversible binding of 125I-thrombin to receptors exhibits sigmoidal thrombin dose-dependence. Thrombin stimulation of [14C]serotonin release exhibits similar thrombin dose dependence. These results indicate that platelets may possess a mechanism for suppressing their interaction with active thrombin at thrombin doses below 0.3 nM. It is possible that PN carries out this function by capturing thrombin before thrombin binds to its signal-transmitting receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1521426764,"GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins) were identified in chemosensory membranes from the channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus. The common G-protein beta-subunit was identified by immunoblotting in both isolated olfactory cilia and purified taste plasma membranes. A cholera toxin substrate (Mr 45,000), corresponding to the G-protein that stimulates adenylate cyclase, was identified in both membranes. Both membranes also contained a single pertussis toxin substrate. In taste membranes, this component co-migrated with the alpha-subunit of the G-protein that inhibits adenylate cyclase. In olfactory cilia, the Mr 40,000 pertussis toxin substrate cross-reacted with antiserum to the common amino acid sequence of G-protein alpha-subunits, but did not cross-react with antiserum to the alpha-subunit of the G-protein from brain of unknown function. The interaction of G-proteins with chemosensory receptors was determined by monitoring receptor binding affinity in the presence of exogenous guanine nucleotides. L-Alanine and L-arginine bind with similar affinity to separate receptors in both olfactory and gustatory membranes from the catfish. GTP and a nonhydrolyzable analogue decreased the affinity of olfactory L-alanine and L-arginine receptors by about 1 order of magnitude. In contrast, the binding affinities of the corresponding taste receptors were unaffected. These results suggest that olfactory receptors are functionally coupled to G-proteins in a manner similar to some hormone and neurotransmitter receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1914561217,"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone, pDTD55, complementary to rat liver quinone reductase mRNA (Williams, J.B., Lu, A.Y.H., Cameron, R.G., and Pickett, C.B. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5524-5528). The cDNA clone contains an open reading frame of 759 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide comprised of 253 amino acids with a Mr = 28,564. To verify the predicted amino acid sequence of quinone reductase, we have been able to align the amino acid sequences of a cyanogen bromide digest of the purified enzyme to the sequence deduced from the cDNA clone. A comparison of the quinone reductase sequence with other known flavoenzymes did not reveal a significant degree of amino acid sequence homology. These data suggest that the quinone reductase gene has evolved independently from genes encoding other flavoenzymes."
https://openalex.org/W166781430,"A single release factor has been isolated and partially purified from rat mitochondria. It requires ethanol in addition to the specific termination codon when assayed in a heterologous system with Escherichia coli ribosomes. The factor recognizes the codons UAA and UAG but not UGA, and therefore it has been designated mtRF-1. A factor of the bacterial RF-2 type, which in E. coli recognizes UGA, or of the mammalian type, which recognizes all three termination codons, has not been detected in mitochondria. The absence of a factor responding to UGA accommodates the use of this codon as a signal for tryptophan in the rat mitochondrial genetic code. The mtRF-1 could translate all of the known termination codons in the rat mitochondrial genome. It does not respond to AGG and AGA which in bovine and human mitochondrial DNA code for termination but which in rat mitochondria may not code for either an amino acid or for termination."
https://openalex.org/W1521129787,"Apolipoprotein A-II (apoA-II) has been shown to inhibit tissue factor participation in the activation of coagulation factor X by factor VIIa. The magnitude of inhibition was dependent on the concentration of the enzyme (factor VIIa) and substrate (factor X) present in the reaction. With factor VIIa at 0.86 nM, 0.41 microM apoA-II inhibited factor X activation as much as 50% at 200 nM factor X, with inhibition decreasing to 39% at 3 nM factor X. When factor X was held constant at 100 nM, 0.41 microM apoA-II inhibited its activation by 80% when factor VIIa was present at 26.7 pM, but the inhibition decreased to 47% when factor VIIa was increased to 1.75 nM. Kinetically, increasing apoA-II decreased the reaction Vmax. ApoA-II produced little effect on the apparent Km, but the apparent K1/2 for factor VIIa in the reaction increased as apoA-II concentration increased. In the presence of 0.75 pM bovine tissue factor, reconstituted with 4.31 microM phosphatidylserine-phosphatidylcholine (30:70, w/w) vesicles, and in the absence of apoA-II, the apparent Km was near 7 nM factor X when factor VIIa was present at 0.86 nM. Under the same conditions with factor X at 100 nM, the apparent K1/2 was near 56 pM factor VIIa. As apoA-II was added to 0.41 microM, the apparent K1/2 increased to about 200 pM factor VIIa. The aggregate results support a model in which apoA-II inhibits tissue factor potentiation of factor VIIa activity. Because the apparent K1/2 increases when apoA-II is added, the factor VIIa can apparently protect tissue factor from the effects of apoA-II. Thus, apoA-II appears to inhibit factor X activation by preventing the appropriate association of tissue factor with factor VIIa."

https://openalex.org/W1575276327,"Bacillus subtilis responds to chemotactic attractants by demethylating certain membrane-bound proteins, termed methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) and by augmenting the evolution of methanol. We propose that the methanol comes from a methylated intermediate rather than directly from the MCPs themselves. First, repellent blocks attractant-induced smooth swimming and methanol formation, but not MCP demethylation. Second, prior treatment of cells with much attractant to reduce radiolabeling of MCPs and increase that of the putative intermediate caused increased, rather than decreased, production of methanol upon addition and then removal of the repellent. Third, such cells also produced much, rather than little, methanol upon addition of less attractant than during the pretreatment. We speculate that unmethylated intermediate causes tumbling; attractant causes its methylation and hence absence of tumbling (smooth swimming). Its demethylation during the period of smooth swimming affords adaptation."

Tryptic peptide mapping demonstrated that a single unique site on calmodulin reacts at low molar ratios of POS-TP. Labeled peptides were isolated and analyzed by amino acid composition and sequence analysis. The unique site was identified as Lys148 of calmodulin, the carboxyl-terminal residue.

https://openalex.org/W1606031181,"The complete amino acid sequence of rhizopuspepsin, an aspartic proteinase from the fungus Rhizopus chinensis was determined by conventional protein sequencing, using peptide fragments obtained mainly by several enzymatic cleavages of the reduced and carboxymethylated (RCm-) protein. The RCm-protein was first cleaved by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were purified and their amino acid sequences determined extensively. These tryptic peptides were aligned by the aid of overlapping peptides isolated from a tryptic and a chymotryptic digest of the citraconylated RCm-protein and the RCm-protein, respectively. The amino acid sequence thus deduced was further confirmed by isolation and sequence determination of peptides obtained by digestion of the RCm-protein with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. The location of the disulfide bonds was determined by isolation and analysis of cystine-containing peptides from a chymotryptic digest of intact rhizopuspepsin. These results showed that the protein is composed of a single polypeptide chain of 325 amino acid residues cross-linked by two disulfide bonds, and shows overall homology with other aspartic proteinases, including 36% identity with penicillopepsin and 38% identity with porcine pepsin."

Double reciprocal plots of initial velocity versus substrate concentration, using bisubstrate kinetic analysis, gave a sequential mechanism. Product inhibition studies were compatible with either a rapid equilibrium, random-order kinetic mechanism or an ordered Theorell-Chance mechanism. Results of dead-end competitive inhibition studies excluded an ordered Theorell-Chance mechanism. The cumulative results are consistent with a rapid equilibrium random-order sequential kinetic mechanism for the glucuronidation of testosterone by purified 17 beta-hydroxysteroid UDP-glucuronosyltransferase and of androsterone by purified 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid UDP-glucuronosyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1569717734,"Cultured rat hepatocytes were used to characterize the relationship between cellular glycogen content and the basal rate, as well as response to insulin of glycogen synthesis. Depending on the concentration of medium glucose, glycogen-depleted monolayers accumulated glycogen between 24 and 48 h of culture up to the fed in vivo level. Insulin at 100 nM stimulated glycogen deposition 20-fold at 1 mM and 1.5-fold at 50 mM glucose. The rate of further glycogen storage decreased with time and increasing glycogen content. In hepatocytes preincubated with 1-50 mM glucose during 24-48 h, short-term basal and insulin-dependent incorporation of 10 mM [14C]glucose into glycogen was inversely related to the actual cellular glycogen content. This was not due to different intracellular dilution of the label, since the specific radioactivity of UDP-glucose was similar in all groups. 125I-Insulin binding indicated that insulin receptors were also not involved in this phenomenon. An inverse relationship was also found between glycogen content and the stimulation of glycogen synthase I activity by insulin, whereas the basal activity of the enzyme was dissociated from the rate of incorporation of [14C]glucose. Basal net glycogen deposition at 10 mM glucose was also inversely related to cellular glycogen; however, no such relation was evident in the presence of insulin due to the overlapping inhibition of glycogenolysis. These studies suggest that the glycogen-mediated inhibition of the activation of glycogen synthase I is operative in the cultured hepatocyte and leads to an apparent inverse relationship between the actual glycogen content and basal as well as insulin-dependent glycogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1582739238,"The specific activity of the mitochondrial CO2 + bicarbonate system has been measured in perfused livers using the specific activities of urea and acetoacetate derived from 2-ketoisocaproate catabolism. Label was supplied either as NaH14CO3, 2-keto[1-14C]isocaproate, [1-14C]pyruvate, [1-14C]glutamine, or [14C]formate. With labeled bicarbonate, pyruvate, or 2-ketoisocaproate, the specific activities of effluent bicarbonate, urea, and acetoacetate were equal (acetoacetate was labeled only on C-1). In the presence of [14C]formate, the specific activity of acetoacetate was double that of urea. Acetazolamide (0.2 mM), an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, decreased the specific activities of urea and acetoacetate labeled from NaH14CO3 and increased the specific activities of urea and acetoacetate labeled from the other tracers. We conclude that: acetoacetate derived from 2-ketoisocaproate is, like urea, an index of the specific activity of mitochondrial CO2 in liver, carbonic anhydrase activity equalizes the specific activities of the CO2 + bicarbonate system on both sides of the mitochondrial membrane, and a fraction of [14C] formate-derived 14CO2 appears to be generated in a mitochondrial compartment, in the close vicinity of methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase."

https://openalex.org/W1541409191,"The enzyme, exo-beta-(1-3)-D-glucanase, (EC 3.2.1-) obtained from a culture filtrate of Basidiomycete sp. QM 806, has been obtained in a highly purified form and preliminary investigations on its mechanism of action have been reported (Peterson, D. R., and Kirkwood, S. (1975) Carbohydr. Res. 41, 273-283). Studies reported in this paper, have provided strong evidence for the role of histidine in the catalytic site of this carbohydrase. Chemical modifications of the amino acid residues in the enzyme with diazotized 5-amino-1H-tetrazole or tetranitromethane caused irreversible loss of enzyme activity which varied according to the time of exposure to, or concentration of the inhibitor. Prior incubation of the enzyme with a substrate considerably reduced the extent of this inhibition. Amino acid analysis of the enzyme treated in these ways clearly indicated that the substrate protected histidine residues from chemical modification by the diazotized 5-amino-1H-tetrazole. Chemical modification of both histidine and tyrosine residues were effected by incubating the enzyme with the inhibitors described above. Although evidence is presented to suggest that tyrosine is not directly involved in the active site of the enzyme (the catalytic site or the binding site), the role of this residue in the maintenance of the enzyme conformation is discussed. Enzyme assays carried out either in aqueous or deuterated buffer systems provided further evidence which is consistent with the proposed enzyme mechanism."

When ammonium sulfate is the source of nitrogen, the glycyl moiety of glyphosate is utilized intact for the biosynthesis of purines and proteins. But when the organism is grown on glycine as the source of nitrogen, the carbons and nitrogen of glyphosate are scrambled, consistent with incorporation into serine and pyruvate, and hence participation in general metabolism. When both ammonium and glycine are present in the growth medium, regulation of the metabolic fluxes along each of the two major pathways appears to be determined by the intracellular glycine concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1527397389,"Rat serum phosphorylcholine-binding protein (PCBP), a member of the pentraxin family of proteins, was previously shown to bind multilamellar liposomes prepared with egg phosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine. The results suggested that the phosphorylcholine groups on the surface of liposomes play an important role in the binding process (Nagpurkar, A., Saxena, U., and Mookerjea, S. (1983) J. Biol Chem. 258, 10518-10523). A study on the binding of human plasma lipoproteins to PCBP immobilized on Sepharose has now been initiated. Very low density lipoproteins were partially bound to a Sepharose-PCBP column, and the bound fraction contained higher concentrations of apoprotein B and E. All the low density lipoproteins applied were bound to the column. In the case of high density lipoproteins, only a small fraction was retained on the column (based on protein analysis), and that bound fraction contained all the apoprotein E and Lp(a) lipoprotein. The binding of very low, low, and high density lipoproteins to Sepharose-PCBP was Ca2+-dependent, and the bound lipoproteins were quantitatively eluted by a phosphorylcholine gradient. Apoprotein B and E were also bound when whole human plasma was applied to Sepharose-PCBP. The effect of selective modification of lysine residues by acetoacetylation and of arginine residues by cyclohexanedione on the binding of low density lipoproteins to Sepharose-PCBP was examined. Modification of arginyl residues resulted in marked reduction of binding, whereas modification of lysine had no effect. Removal of sialic acid from PCBP also had no effect on the binding of low density lipoproteins to immobilized-desialylated PCBP column. The preferential binding of apoprotein B- and E-containing lipoproteins to Sepharose-PCBP indicates a possible physiological role of PCBP and other similar circulating phosphorylcholine-binding proteins of the pentraxin family in lipoprotein metabolism."

The reaction was concentration-dependent with respect to Enzyme IImtl and did not occur in its absence. The reaction occurred in the absence of Mg2+ in the presence of 10 mM EDTA. Treatment of Enzyme IImtl with the histidyl reagent diethylpyrocarbonate inactivated it with respect to the exchange reaction. Levels of N-ethylmaleimide which inactivate Enzyme IImtl with respect to both P-enolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of mannitol and mannitol/mannitol-1-P transphosphorylation did not affect its activity in the exchange reaction; however, treatment with another sulfhydryl reagent, p-chloromercuribenzoate, resulted in partial inactivation. The pH optimum for the Enzyme IImtl-catalyzed exchange reaction was about 7.5.
