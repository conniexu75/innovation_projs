https://openalex.org/W2055507950,"Rate of dissoluton of calcium carbonate (calcite) was determined for a vertical profile 5000 mizeters deep in the central Pacific by measuring the loss of weight of optical calcite spheres arrayed on a mooring. Waters of the Pacific are undersaturated in all but the upper several hundred meters. A sharp increase in the rate of dissolution occurs at a depth of about 3700 meters, which corresponds closely to the depth below which calcite hias been dissolved from the sediments."
https://openalex.org/W2081551540,"Abstract. Deuterium and oxygen-18 measurements show that the Red Sea and Salton Sea brines are the results of a single process, the leaching of sediments by surface water circulating downward to a geothermal reservoir. The Salton Sea brine is derived from local precipitation but the Red Sea brine originates 1000 kilometers south of its basin, on the shallow sill which controls the circulation of the Red Sea. On this sill sea water penetrates a thick evaporite sequence to a depth of 2000 meters, and, driven by its increased density relative to sea water, flows northward to emerge in the brine-filled deeps."
https://openalex.org/W2033861740,"In a study of 35 white-throated sparrows five distinct karyotypes were observed. A chromosomal polymorphism is present which involves at least two pairs of macrochromosomes. This species is phenotypically polymorphic with selective breeding occurring between morphs. Phenotype is related to chromosomal constitution, and selective breeding appears to maintain heterozygosity within the population."
https://openalex.org/W1979442888,Abstract. Disturbance of the uranium-lead isotopic system in a metamict Ceylon zircon has been produced in a 2 molal NaCI solution at 500 degrees C and 1000 bars fluid pressure. Loss of radiogenic lead to the extent of 61 percent in 13 days was the most significant effect. The experimental results support the episodic rather than continuous lead-loss interpretation of natural zircon systems utilized in geochronology.
https://openalex.org/W2045936515,"Several foraminiferal assemblages are recognized in Spartina-Salicornia marshes along the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico coasts. Continuous recordings in one Pacific marsh show considerable diurnal and seasonal variation in pH, oxygen, water temperature, and salinity. This is related to tidal flushing, air temperature variations, sunlight duration, and marsh plant metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2042392758,"When exposed to a trace of iodine vapor, the submicroscopic particles of lead exhausted by automobiles produce nuclei for the formation of ice crystals. Concentrations of particles exceeding 10(6) per liter can be directly sampled from the exhaust pipe of an idling motor. Concentrations of from 10(4) to 10(5) per liter have been found in rural air downwind of auto roads; the concentration at one rural site has increased by an order of magnitude in 13 years. The phenomenon may provide a method of modifying clouds, and of determining ( and monitoring) the percentage of automobile exhaust in a polluted atmosphere. It may be an important factor in inadvertent modification by man of the climate."
https://openalex.org/W2010311513,"In the northeastern Pacific Ocean, north of 22 degrees N and east of 180 degrees W, a deep-sea pH maximum of 7.9 exists near 4000 meters. The effect of hydrostatic pressure on the dissociation constants of carbonic acid in sea water appears to be important in its formation."
https://openalex.org/W2060693454,Scan-line recording by means of a moving laser spot has been achieved on metallic and organic thin films Recording rates of the order of one million spots per second were obtained with a laser beam power of 38 milliwatts at the recording surface. Typical recorded line widths were of the order of 2 microns.
https://openalex.org/W1979726873,"Mitochondria from healthy oat seedlings oxidized succinate with good respiratory control and high ratios of adenosine diphosphate to oxygen. After treatment with victorin, the pathotoxin responsible for symptoms of Victoria blight of oats, susceptible seedlings yielded mitochondria with little respiratory control and lower ratios of adenosine diphosphate to oxygen. No such effects were obtained with victorin-treated resistant seedlings or when victorin was added directly to mitochondria from healthy susceptible or resistant plants. These data indicate that victorin-induced disease results in a reduction in efficiency of the energy-generating system of isolated mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W1999992371,"As another parent of two children
who have bad high school biology (both
had the Biological Sciences Curriculum
Study Blue Version course), I would
like to comment on Branson's letter
(28 Oct.). My children have both come
away, instilled with enthusiasm for the
study of biology, with the feeling that
it's a science, that it's understandable,
and that it bas principles. I feel that
the BSCS Blue Version high school
course is a great advance over its predecessors,
precisely because it is so intellectually
interesting and stimulating.
It teaches the excitement of modern
biology. It cannot, of course, teach all
of the facts. No course can. The most
that a high school biology course can
do is to awaken the student's interest,
and thence to help him to want to
learn for himself other related biological
matters."
