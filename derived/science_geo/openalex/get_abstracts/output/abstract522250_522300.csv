Various cell migration patterns have been reported, but no general rule has emerged so far. Here, we show on the basis of experimental data in vitro and in vivo that cell persistence, which quantifies the straightness of trajectories, is robustly coupled to cell migration speed. We suggest that this universal coupling constitutes a generic law of cell migration, which originates in the advection of polarity cues by an actin cytoskeleton undergoing flows at the cellular scale. Our analysis relies on a theoretical model that we validate by measuring the persistence of cells upon modulation of actin flow speeds and upon optogenetic manipulation of the binding of an actin regulator to actin filaments.

Eukaryotic cell migration is essential for a large set of biological processes. Assessing quantitatively the exploratory efficiency of cell trajectories is therefore crucial. In the absence of external guidance, cell movement can be described as a random motion, and proposed models have ranged from simple Brownian motion to persistent random walks (Selmeczi et al., 2008Selmeczi D. Li L. Pedersen L.I.I. Norrelykke S.F. Hagedorn P.H. Mosler S. Larsen N.B. Cox E.C. Flyvbjerg H. Cell motility as random motion: a review.Eur. Phys. J.

Luster A.D. et al.Generalized Lévy walks and the role of chemokines in migration of effector CD8+ T cells.Nature. 2012; 486: 545-548PubMed Google Scholar), or composite processes such as intermittent random walks (Bénichou et al., 2011Bénichou O. Loverdo C. Moreau M. Voituriez R. Intermittent search strategies.Rev. Mod. Phys. 2011; 83: 81-129Crossref Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Such models differ in the cell persistence, which quantifies the ability of a cell to maintain its direction of motion. The variety of behaviors, observed even along a single cell trajectory, stems from the fact that, as opposed to a passive tracer in a medium at thermal equilibrium, which performs a classical Brownian motion, a cell is self-propelled, and as such, belongs to the class of active Brownian particles (Romanczuk et al., 2012Romanczuk P. Bar M. Ebeling W. Lindner B. Schimansky-Geier L. Active Brownian particles from individual to collective stochastic dynamics.Eur. Phys. J. Special Topics. 2012; 202: 1-162Crossref Scopus (698) Google Scholar). This class of processes is extremely vast and needs to be restricted to have some predicting power. Up to now universal behaviors have emerged in the context of the collective dynamics of self-propelled particles (Czirók et al., 1998Czirók A. Schlett K. Madarász E. Vicsek T.

Recently, a vast amount of data of individual cell trajectories has been collected over many cell types in the context of the First World Cell Race (Maiuri et al., 2012Maiuri P. Terriac E. Paul-Gilloteaux P. Vignaud T. McNally K. Onuffer J. Thorn K. Nguyen P.A. Georgoulia N. Soong D. et al.The first world cell race.Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: R673-R675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (Figures 1A and 1B ). These data show that, despite an apparent diversity at the level of the whole population analyzed, correlations between the mean linear instantaneous cell speed and the persistence time, defined as the mean time during which a cell maintains its direction of motion, exist. This general trend that faster cells migrate more straight than slower cells, which has since been observed by others (Wu et al., 2014Wu P.-H. Giri A. Sun S.X. Wirtz D. Three-dimensional cell migration does not follow a random walk.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 3949-3954Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), remains unexplained and suggests that robust mechanisms could constrain the possible characteristics of cell trajectories. In this work, we analyzed trajectories of cells migrating in various in vitro assays and in live tissues. We reveal on the basis of this extensive data set a universal coupling between cell speed and cell persistence (UCSP). To explain what appears as a universal law of cell migration, we developed a physical model relying on minimal hypothesis that shows that actin flows, which are the hallmark of motile cells (Theriot and Mitchison, 1991Theriot J.A. Mitchison T.J. Actin microfilament dynamics in locomoting cells.Nature. 1991; 352: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, Svitkina et al., 1997Svitkina T.M. Verkhovsky A.B. McQuade K.M.

Myosin II contributes to cell-scale actin network treadmilling through network disassembly.Nature. 2010; 465: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), reinforce cell polarity and consequently cell persistence. The model was validated experimentally by two assays: one enabling a gradual modulation of actin flow speeds combined with pharmacological interference experiments, and a second, based on an engineered optogenetic molecular module, which allowed controlling an actin polymerization regulator, Arpin. Finally, the model has the following merits: it (1) quantitatively predicts the observed exponential correlation between speed and persistence that characterizes the UCSP, (2) provides from minimal microscopic hypothesis an explicit construction of single cells dynamics as active Brownian particles, and (3) yields a generic phase diagram of cellular trajectories, which recapitulates the full range of observed migration behaviors. The First World Cell Race (Maiuri et al., 2012Maiuri P. Terriac E. Paul-Gilloteaux P. Vignaud T. McNally K. Onuffer J. Thorn K. Nguyen P.A. Georgoulia N. Soong D. et al.The first world cell race.Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: R673-R675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), which gathered recordings of individual cell trajectories on 1D adhesive tracks for 54 different adherent cell types made available an unprecedented amount of data. We performed a further analysis of this data and confirmed a clear positive correlation between the population averaged mean linear instantaneous cell speed and the population averaged persistence time at the level of all cell types (Figure 1A), despite their variety. To assess the robustness of this observation and check its validity at the level of single cell trajectories, we performed new experiments on two representative examples of migrating cell with either a mesenchymal migration mode (hTERT-immortalized retinal pigment epithelial cell line [RPE1]) or an amoeboid migration mode (immature bone marrow-derived mice dendritic cells [BMDC]), in various geometries (Figures S1 and S2; Movie S1): 1D adhesive tracks (Figure 1C), 1D microchannels (Figure 1D), 2D non-confined adhesive substrates (Figure 1E) and 2D confined substrates (Figure 1F). Very long cell trajectories were recorded (see Supplemental Information), allowing a clear assessment of individual cell persistence. In all cases, for which cell concentrations were low enough to treat cell trajectories as independent, we found a striking correlation between persistence time τ and mean instantaneous velocity v, which is well fitted by a simple exponential curve τ=Aeλv before eventually saturating at larger v (see Discussion). We then checked whether this correlation was still valid when cells were migrating in more complex environments. We recorded BMDCs migrating in 3D collagen gels (Figure 1G) and myeloid cells migrating in live Medaka fish (Grabher et al., 2007Grabher C. Cliffe A. Miura K. Hayflick J. Pepperkok R. Rørth P. Wittbrodt J. Birth and life of tissue macrophages and their migration in embryogenesis and inflammation in medaka.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2007; 81: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Figure 1H). In both cases, persistence and speed were still highly correlated. Overall, these results show that the UCSP is robust when tested in different migration environments and organisms, and that the correlation, observed at the population level or at the level of individual cells exists all along a cell trajectory: a faster displacement is correlated with a straighter path. The analysis of this remarkably robust correlation that defines the UCSP is at the core of this work.Figure S2Cell Trajectories in 1D, 2D, 3D, and In Vivo, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A and B) Rpe1 cells on 9 μm width fibronectin micropatterned lines and BMDC in fibronectine treated channels of 7 × 5 μm2 section, respectively.

To elucidate the origin of the UCSP, we reasoned that, as this law applies to all cell types we tested, including cells with very different modes of migration (mesenchymal and amoeboid cells), it had to rely on a very conserved aspect of cell locomotion. Even if many details might vary from one cell type to the other, the most conserved aspect of cell locomotion is the retrograde translocation of actin filaments in the frame of reference of the cell, from the front to the rear of its locomotory parts. Actin flows can either exist over large portions of the cell (in particular in amoeboid cells) (Renkawitz et al., 2009Renkawitz J. Schumann K. Weber M. Lämmermann T. Pflicke H. Piel M. Polleux J.

This retrograde movement is powered by the combined forces of actin polymerization at the leading edge and actomyosin contraction at the trailing edge and represents the driving force for locomotion. Upon coupling to the environment either via transmembrane adhesion receptors of the integrin family or via friction, retrograde actin flow is turned into traction forces, which pull the cell forward while actin filaments slide to the back of the cell (Mogilner and Oster, 1996Mogilner A.

Spontaneous contractility-mediated cortical flow generates cell migration in three-dimensional environments.Biophys. J. 2011; 101: 1041-1045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To test if actin flows are involved in the coupling between cell persistence and cell speed, we used mature bone marrow dendritic cells (mBMDCs), for which it was already demonstrated that actin retrograde flow can be varied without affecting cell speed when substrate adhesion strength is modulated (Renkawitz et al., 2009Renkawitz J. Schumann K. Weber M. Lämmermann T. Pflicke H. Piel M. Polleux J. Spatz J.P. Sixt M. Adaptive force transmission in amoeboid cell migration.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1438-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Indeed, the cell speed v and the velocity of the actin flow V (defined hereafter in the frame of reference of the moving cell) are usually linearly coupled according to v=αV (Jurado et al., 2005Jurado C. Haserick J.R. Lee J. Slipping or gripping? Fluorescent speckle microscopy in fish keratocytes reveals two different mechanisms for generating a retrograde flow of actin.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), such linear approximation being valid at least in the lower range of velocities for each cell type. The coefficient α models the effective friction between actin filaments and the substrate, usually mediated by specific adhesion proteins (Mitchison and Kirschner, 1988Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Cytoskeletal dynamics and nerve growth.Neuron. 1988; 1: 761-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, Gardel et al., 2010Gardel M.L. Schneider I.C. Aratyn-Schaus Y. Waterman C.M. Mechanical integration of actin and adhesion dynamics in cell migration.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 26: 315-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) and therefore depends on experimental conditions. In some cell types, varying the actin/substrate coupling parameterized by α induces an adaptive response, which allows a cell to keep the speed of locomotion v relatively constant, despite different retrograde velocities V of the loosely coupled actin network. Such adaptation has been extensively characterized in mBMDCs. When placed in confined environments, these cells can flexibly shift between integrin-independent and integrin-dependent force transduction as even in the absence of these adhesion receptors the cells are able to generate sufficient traction to migrate. However, depletion of integrins or their ligands and the associated drop in friction causes retrograde actin slippage, which is then compensated by up to 2-fold increase in actin polymerization speed (Renkawitz et al., 2009Renkawitz J. Schumann K. Weber M. Lämmermann T. Pflicke H. Piel M. Polleux J. Spatz J.P. Sixt M. Adaptive force transmission in amoeboid cell migration.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1438-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This property of mBMDCs moving in confined environments allowed us to independently study the influence of retrograde actin flow and actual cell speed on migratory persistence. Surface adhesion was independently controlled by depletion of β2 integrins and their ligands (coating the surfaces with an inert PEG layer), while cell speed was gradually varied by temperature changes and by pharmacological inhibition of actomyosin contractility (blebbistatin). This allowed us to tune retrograde flows from 3 to 15 μm/min independently of cell speed (Figure 2A). Strikingly, we observed that the mean persistence time τ measured for each experimental condition was strongly correlated with the mean speed V of the actin retrograde flow and was well-fitted by a simple exponential τ=A′eλ′V (Figure 2B; Movie S2), whereas no correlation between τ and cell speed v was observed. Note, however, that within each experimental condition (α fixed) the linear scaling between v and V still held, so that the correlation between cell speed and cell persistence was preserved at the level of each experimental condition. These data strongly suggest that the observed UCSP originates from a coupling between cell persistence and the actin flow. A simple hypothesis to explain these effects of actin flows would be that, in polarized migrating cells, actin flows reinforce cell polarity by enhancing the asymmetry of polarity cues, as was proposed for the establishment of polarity in early Caenorhabditis elegans embryos (Munro et al., 2004Munro E. Nance J. Priess J.R. Cortical flows powered by asymmetrical contraction transport PAR proteins to establish and maintain anterior-posterior polarity in the early C. elegans embryo.Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, Goehring et al., 2011Goehring N.W. Trong P.K. Bois J.S. Chowdhury D. Nicola E.M. Hyman A.A. Grill S.W. Polarization of PAR proteins by advective triggering of a pattern-forming system.Science. 2011; 334: 1137-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) (Figures 2C and 2D). Examples of such cues, which are likely to vary with cell type, could be molecules responsible for the generation of contractile stress, such as myosin motors or their activators, actin polymerization regulators, or could alternatively be involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics (Zhang et al., 2014Zhang J. Guo W.-H. Wang Y.-L. Microtubules stabilize cell polarity by localizing rear signals.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 16383-16388Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We introduce a first element of physical modeling to test this hypothesis. We consider a migrating cell and denote by x the coordinate in the reference frame of the moving cell, defined by the instantaneous direction of migration and by L the cell extension along this axis (Figure 2C). We are interested in the dynamics of the concentration of a generic polarity cue c(x,t), which we assume here depends only on x. This cue is assumed to specify the rear part of the cell, so that c(x=0,t)>c(x=L,t) for a cell moving in the + direction. The polarity cue can either diffuse in the cytosol, with diffusion coefficient D, or, depending on its affinity for actin, be advected by the cytoskeletal flow, whose velocity along x is denoted by −V (with V>0) in the cell reference frame. We denote by kon and koff the corresponding binding and unbinding rates of the cue to the actin cytoskeleton. In the limit of fast exchange (kon,koff large), the dynamics of c(x,t) depends on advective transport and on diffusion as follows:∂tc(x,t)−∂x[V˜c(x,t)]=D˜∂x2c(x,t)+∂xζc,(Equation 1) where V˜=Vkon/(kon+koff) and D˜=Dkoff/(kon+koff) ; here ζc is a Gaussian white noise that encompasses the fluctuations of the flux of cue molecules. At steady state, assuming V constant and the conservation of the total amount of cues, the mean cue concentration profile is therefore given by:c¯V(x)=Ce−V˜x/D˜,(Equation 2) where C is a normalization constant and the dependence on the retrograde flow is denoted in subscript. This simple argument, which does not take into account heterogeneities in actin flows predicts simple exponential concentration profiles, whose steepness is controlled by the speed of the effective retrograde flow V˜ (Figure 2D). Non-uniform actin flow profiles, as observed for example in (Wilson et al., 2010Wilson C.A. Tsuchida M.A. Allen G.M. Barnhart E.L. Applegate K.T. Yam P.T. Ji L. Keren K. Danuser G. Theriot J.A.

Keren K. Actin disassembly clock determines shape and speed of lamellipodial fragments.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 20394-20399Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) would change the exponential shape of concentration profiles, but would leave the dependence on the actin flow speed qualitatively unchanged. To check this general prediction, we measured on motile mBMDCs the concentration profiles along the polarity axis for various molecules with different affinity for actin (Figure 2E; Movie S3): Tamra (that unspecifically labels cytoplasmic proteins), Lifeact-GFP (low affinity) (Riedl et al., 2008Riedl J. Crevenna A.H. Kessenbrock K. Yu J.H. Neukirchen D. Bista M. Bradke F. Jenne D. Holak T.A. Werb Z. et al.Lifeact: a versatile marker to visualize F-actin.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar), MLC-GFP (high affinity) (Kondo et al., 2011Kondo T. Hamao K. Kamijo K. Kimura H. Morita M. Takahashi M. Hosoya H. Enhancement of myosin II/actin turnover at the contractile ring induces slower furrowing in dividing HeLa cells.Biochem. J. 2011; 435: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and Utrophin-GFP (high affinity) (Burkel et al., 2007Burkel B.M. von Dassow G. Bement W.M. Versatile fluorescent probes for actin filaments based on the actin-binding domain of utrophin.Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2007; 64: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). As expected from the model, we observed that increasing the actin retrograde flow could significantly increase the slope of the concentration profile of strong actin binders (MLC, Utrophin), whereas the profiles of molecules with low (Lifeact) or no (Tamra) affinity to actin remained unchanged (Figures 2E and 2F). This validates our hypothesis that actin flows reinforce the asymmetry of concentration profiles of actin binding molecules. We next reasoned that such mechanism in principle applies to any diffusing molecule that interacts with actin, and in particular, to polarity cues. It is then expected that increasing actin flows should increase the asymmetry of the concentration profile of any polarity cue, thereby stabilizing cell polarization and consequently increasing cell persistence, according to a mechanism discussed in Svitkina et al., 1997Svitkina T.M. Verkhovsky A.B. McQuade K.M. Borisy G.G. Analysis of the actin-myosin II system in fish epidermal keratocytes: mechanism of cell body translocation.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 397-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar (note that the connection to persistence was, however, absent in this reference). To further support this hypothesis, we measured the number of protrusions for each cell, using the same nine experimental conditions to vary the actin flow and found that in conditions in which cells had a faster actin flow, there was a larger proportion of cells with a single well-polarized lamellipodium (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3). We then measured the life time of such unipolar configurations, that we call polarization time τp, and the actin retrograde flow speed in each protrusion, and found that they showed the same exponential correlation (Figure 3C). This suggests that the observed coupling between actin retrograde flow and cell persistence originates from the stabilization of polarity by faster actin flows, by favoring a unipolar configuration of the cell and by lengthening the protrusion lifetime.Figure S3Stability of Cell Polarity in mBMDCs, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) images showing representative examples for Wt mBMDCs, Itg−/− mBMDCs, Itg−/− mBMDCs treated with 20 μM Blebbistatin and Itg−/− mBMDCs treated with 20 μM ML-141.(B and C) Polarization lifetime analysis for (B) Itg−/− dendritic cells and (C) Itg−/− dendritic cells treated with 20 μM Blebbistatin.

While in principle this mechanism can apply to any diffusing polarity cue that interacts with actin, species involved in the regulation of actin flow are the most susceptible to mediate the UCSP. Cdc42, a member of the Rho GTPase family is a central regulator of polarity, mediating its function via the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton (Heasman and Ridley, 2008Heasman S.J. Ridley A.J. Mammalian Rho GTPases: new insights into their functions from in vivo studies.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 690-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar), and thus appeared as a natural candidate. Loss of Cdc42 in dendritic cells severely affects cell polarization and migration efficiency in vitro and in vivo (Lämmermann et al., 2009Lämmermann T. Renkawitz J. Wu X. Hirsch K. Brakebusch C. Sixt M. Cdc42-dependent leading edge coordination is essential for interstitial dendritic cell migration.Blood. 2009; 113: 5703-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To test if the Cdc42 polarity module was involved in coupling rearward cortical flows to polarity we selectively inhibited Cdc42 using ML-141 (Hong et al., 2013Hong L. Kenney S.R. Phillips G.K. Simpson D. Schroeder C.E. Nöth J. Romero E. Swanson S. Waller A. Strouse J.J. et al.Characterization of a Cdc42 protein inhibitor and its use as a molecular probe.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 8531-8543Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and measured the lifetime of cell polarization τp in dependence of cortical flow speed V that was modulated via a set of five independent experimental conditions as discussed above (Figure 2A). As expected, inhibition of Cdc42 led to an overall reduction of the polarization lifetime for all conditions but, importantly, longer polarization lifetimes were observed for increasing actin flow speeds V and the UCSP was preserved (Figure 3D). These results indicate that the UCSP can function independently of a Cdc42-mediated signaling pathway. We next sought to unravel key molecular polarity cues closely affected by the cortical network flow. Myosin-II is a prominent candidate, which strongly binds to actin; it is thus transported with actin flows and tends to accumu"
https://openalex.org/W2071163278,"Nicotine acts on adipocytes to induce activation of AMPK, promoting excess lipolysis and weight loss but also the development of whole-body insulin resistance. Cigarette smoking promotes body weight reduction in humans while paradoxically also promoting insulin resistance (IR) and hyperinsulinemia. However, the mechanisms behind these effects are unclear. Here we show that nicotine, a major constituent of cigarette smoke, selectively activates AMP-activated protein kinase α2 (AMPKα2) in adipocytes, which in turn phosphorylates MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP1) at serine 334, initiating its proteasome-dependent degradation. The nicotine-dependent reduction of MKP1 induces the aberrant activation of both p38 mitogen–activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, leading to increased phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) at serine 307. Phosphorylation of IRS1 leads to its degradation, protein kinase B inhibition, and the loss of insulin-mediated inhibition of lipolysis. Consequently, nicotine increases lipolysis, which results in body weight reduction, but this increase also elevates the levels of circulating free fatty acids and thus causes IR in insulin-sensitive tissues.

These viruses persist in part because continuous antigenic stimulation causes the deterioration of virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) function and survival. Additionally, antiviral CTLs autonomously suppress their responses to limit immunopathology by upregulating inhibitory receptors such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1). Identification and blockade of the pathways that induce CTL dysfunction may facilitate the clearance of chronic viral infections. We found that the prostaglandin E2 (PGE₂) receptors EP2 and EP4 were upregulated on virus-specific CTLs during chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection and suppressed CTL survival and function. We show that the combined blockade of PGE₂ and PD-1 signaling was therapeutic in terms of improving viral control and augmenting the numbers of functional virus-specific CTLs. Thus, PGE₂ inhibition is both an independent candidate therapeutic target and a promising adjunct therapy to PD-1 blockade for the treatment of HIV and other chronic viral infections."

Contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), which is a cessation of forward movement upon migratory collision, is a process common to many cell types (Abercrombie and Heaysman, 1953Abercrombie M.

This multifaceted phenomenon requires cells to specifically recognize each other, modulate their migratory capacity, and depending on the cell-type, subsequently repolarize. As a result of this complexity, the mechanisms behind CIL are largely unknown, and it is additionally unclear how these various behaviors during the process are integrated to induce a seamless response. A range of inter-cellular adhesions and intracellular signaling pathways are postulated to be involved in CIL (e.g., Eph-ephrin [Astin et al., 2010Astin J.W. Batson J. Kadir S. Charlet J. Persad R.A.

USA. 1998; 95: 4362-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar]). However, it is unclear exactly how these various signals feed into the cytoskeletal machinery to control the response. More crucially, nothing is known about the actin dynamics involved in CIL. As a central aspect of CIL is a rapid change in migration, it is clear that to understand the mechanisms behind this phenomenon it will be crucial to elucidate the dynamics of the actin network during the response. During cell migration, the actin network provides the propulsion that allows a cell to generate movement. The actin cytoskeleton within the lamella of a migrating cell is in a constant state of retrograde flow. Actin polymerizes at the leading edge, which pushes the cell membrane forward. Subsequently, the force of polymerization against the membrane along with Myosin II driven contraction drives retrograde movement of the actin network; it is this treadmill that generates the forces behind cell motility. When a cell moves, cell-matrix receptors, such as integrins, become engaged and bind to the extracellular matrix. Integrin activation leads to a slowing of the actin flow at this integrin-based point of friction, and the force of the moving actin network is then transformed into extracellular traction stresses (Gardel et al., 2008Gardel M.L. Sabass B. Ji L. Danuser G. Schwarz U.S. Waterman C.M. Traction stress in focal adhesions correlates biphasically with actin retrograde flow speed.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). This integrin-dependent actin-clutch, and the resultant inverse correlation between actin flow and traction force, is hypothesized to be involved in the movement of numerous cell types. We have been exploiting the embryonic migration of Drosophila macrophages (hemocytes) to understand the regulatory mechanisms of CIL and the function of this process during embryogenesis (Davis et al., 2012Davis J.R. Huang C.Y. Zanet J. Harrison S. Rosten E. Cox S. Soong D.Y. Dunn G.A. Stramer B.M.

Clasp-mediated microtubule bundling regulates persistent motility and contact repulsion in Drosophila macrophages in vivo.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 189: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These cells develop from the head mesoderm and disperse throughout the Drosophila embryo taking defined migratory routes. One of these routes occurs just beneath the epithelium along the ventral surface where their superficial location in the embryo allows them to be imaged live at high spatio-temporal resolution approaching what can be achieved from cells in culture. This has revealed that hemocytes spread out to form an evenly distributed pattern beneath the ventral surface within a thin acellular cavity (the hemocoel) (Stramer et al., 2010Stramer B. Moreira S. Millard T. Evans I. Huang C.Y. Sabet O. Milner M. Dunn G. Martin P. Wood W. Clasp-mediated microtubule bundling regulates persistent motility and contact repulsion in Drosophila macrophages in vivo.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 189: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We previously developed a mathematical model of hemocyte dispersal, and computer simulations revealed that this uniform cell spacing may be driven by contact inhibition (Davis et al., 2012Davis J.R. Huang C.Y. Zanet J. Harrison S. Rosten E. Cox S. Soong D.Y. Dunn G.A. Stramer B.M. Emergence of embryonic pattern through contact inhibition of locomotion.Development. 2012; 139: 4555-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Indeed, a similar analysis of Cajal Retzius cell migration in the cerebral cortex showed an identical requirement for CIL in their dispersion (Villar-Cerviño et al., 2013Villar-Cerviño V. Molano-Mazón M. Catchpole T. Valdeolmillos M. Henkemeyer M. Martínez L.M. Borrell V. Marín O. Contact repulsion controls the dispersion and final distribution of Cajal-Retzius cells.Neuron. 2013; 77: 457-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting that CIL is a conserved mechanism capable of generating tiled cellular arrays. Here, we show that hemocyte developmental dispersal requires precise contact inhibition dynamics. Quantification of changes in speed and direction during cellular collisions reveals that their CIL response is not stochastic but involves distinct kinematic stages that are synchronized between colliding partners. We also show that this choreographed movement involves a coordinated change in actin dynamics. Tracking actin flow within hemocytes in vivo reveals a physical coupling of the colliding actin networks through engagement of a transient inter-cellular adhesion. It is this “inter-cellular actin-clutch” and the coordinated build-up and release of lamellar tension in colliding cells that orchestrates their behaviors, allowing CIL to behave as an instructive migratory cue. Hemocytes disperse evenly within the ventral hemocoel during Drosophila embryogenesis and their CIL dynamics can be precisely analyzed during this process (Figure 1A; Movie S1) (Davis et al., 2012Davis J.R. Huang C.Y. Zanet J. Harrison S. Rosten E. Cox S. Soong D.Y. Dunn G.A. Stramer B.M.

Clasp-mediated microtubule bundling regulates persistent motility and contact repulsion in Drosophila macrophages in vivo.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 189: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To elucidate the migratory phases of CIL, we first analyzed the changes in acceleration throughout the response with reference to the time of microtubule alignment between colliding hemocytes (Figure 1B; Movie S1), which we previously revealed is a hallmark of CIL that is associated with a change in hemocyte motility (Stramer et al., 2010Stramer B. Moreira S. Millard T. Evans I. Huang C.Y. Sabet O. Milner M. Dunn G. Martin P. Wood W. Clasp-mediated microtubule bundling regulates persistent motility and contact repulsion in Drosophila macrophages in vivo.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 189: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our data revealed that there is a back acceleration upon microtubule alignment, signifying that cells were slowing down and/or changing direction (Figure 1C) (Davis et al., 2012Davis J.R. Huang C.Y. Zanet J. Harrison S. Rosten E. Cox S. Soong D.Y. Dunn G.A. Stramer B.M. Emergence of embryonic pattern through contact inhibition of locomotion.Development. 2012; 139: 4555-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This was significant when calculated at either 60- or 20-s intervals (Figures 1C and S1A) highlighting that the time of microtubule alignment is correlated with a sudden change of motion during CIL.Figure S1Hemocyte Contact Inhibition Is Precisely Controlled, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Time course of hemocyte accelerations at 20 s intervals (black arrows) surrounding a collision event with reference to the colliding partner (red arrow).

Note that during CIL, lamellar retraction at the front precedes new lamellae formation at the back of the cell. Error bars represent SEM. The time of microtubule alignment allowed us to temporally register collisions and extend the time course of the acceleration analysis. We observed that 120 s before microtubule alignment there was a sudden forward acceleration, and 180 s after, an additional back acceleration event (Figure 1C). To determine whether these accelerations were due to changes in cell speed and/or direction, we quantified the internuclear distance of colliding cells during the CIL time course. Two minutes prior to microtubule alignment, the graph of internuclear distance over time revealed a sudden increase in slope (Figure 1D). This suggested that the cell speed increased, which was confirmed by analyzing the nuclear displacement rates (Figure 1E). Immediately upon microtubule alignment, the speed reduced (Figure 1E), which explained the sudden back acceleration (Figure S1A), and ∼120 s later the nuclei moved apart (Figure 1D). Analysis of the SD of the internuclear distance over time also highlighted these stages by showing an abrupt decrease in variance as cells progressed from one phase to the next, suggesting that these stages were differentially regulated (Figure S1B). These distinct phases were also visualized by calculating the average velocity vector of left and right colliding cells (Movie S1), which additionally revealed the coordinated behavior of hemocytes during CIL. As we previously revealed that the lamellae of colliding cells overlap before microtubule alignment (Stramer et al., 2010Stramer B. Moreira S. Millard T. Evans I. Huang C.Y. Sabet O. Milner M. Dunn G. Martin P. Wood W. Clasp-mediated microtubule bundling regulates persistent motility and contact repulsion in Drosophila macrophages in vivo.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 189: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that this initial interaction was instigating the kinematic changes. Indeed, lamellae of colliding cells made contact 105 ± 22 s prior to microtubule alignment (Figures 1F and 1G; Movie S1), coinciding with the forward acceleration phase of CIL. Furthermore, an actin fiber developed after lamellae contact that connected the colliding cells, which microtubules subsequently utilized as guides during alignment (Figure 1G). It is important to note that the formation of this actin fiber, and the subsequent repulsion, was not observed when a hemocyte contacted the rear of another cell (i.e., not the lamella), or collided with the lamella of a static cell (Movie S1). This analysis highlights that an interaction between lamellar actin networks of migrating cells is initiating the CIL response. Analysis of the separation phase of CIL also revealed a synchronous response between colliding cells. Kymography of lamellar retraction revealed that colliding partners simultaneously retracted their lamellae at two to three times the speed of retraction events of freely moving cells (Figures 1H–1J). This retraction event initiated 32 ± 22 s after microtubule alignment, which coincided with the initiation of movement away from the colliding partner. The retraction of lamellae occurred prior to the development of new protrusions away from the colliding partner, suggesting that rapid lamellar retraction initiates cell repolarization (Figures S1C and S1D). Different cell-types exhibit distinct CIL behaviors, which are classified as either type 1 (involving contact-induced lamellar contraction) or type 2 (inhibition of locomotion without contraction) responses (Stramer et al., 2013Stramer B.M. Dunn G.A. Davis J.R. Mayor R. Rediscovering contact inhibition in the embryo.J. Microsc. 2013; 251: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our analysis suggests that hemocytes undergo a classical type 1 response similar in description to chick heart fibroblasts, which were also observed to exhibit sudden lamellar recoil (Abercrombie and Heaysman, 1953Abercrombie M. Heaysman J.E. Observations on the social behaviour of cells in tissue culture. I. Speed of movement of chick heart fibroblasts in relation to their mutual contacts.Exp. Cell Res. 1953; 5: 111-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To understand how the actin networks were mediating the response, we analyzed the actin retrograde flow dynamics during CIL. Time-lapse movies of freely moving hemocytes, labeled with the actin probe, LifeAct-GFP, during their developmental dispersal revealed a highly dynamic actin network within their lamellae (Movie S2). We adapted a fluorescent pseudo-speckle tracking technique (Betz et al., 2009Betz T. Koch D. Lim D. Käs J.A. Stochastic actin polymerization and steady retrograde flow determine growth cone advancement.Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 5130-5138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) to quantify the precise speed and direction changes of actin flow within hemocytes in vivo (Figure S2A; Movie S2). This revealed that freely moving hemocytes in vivo have a mean actin flow rate of 3.2 ± 1.8 μm/min, which is similar to growth cones in vitro (Betz et al., 2009Betz T. Koch D. Lim D. Käs J.A. Stochastic actin polymerization and steady retrograde flow determine growth cone advancement.Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 5130-5138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Live imaging of collisions revealed significant reorganization of the actin networks during the response (Figure 2A; Movie S2). This reorganization coincided with the development of an actin fiber, which ran perpendicular to the leading edge, linking the lamellae of colliding cells (Figures 2A and S2B). Pseudo-speckle microscopy of collisions highlighted a slowing of the actin flow within a corridor that colocalized with the actin fiber (Figure 2A; Movie S2) and the aligned microtubule bundle (Figure 2B; Movie S2). Quantification of the actin flow rate within the region surrounding the actin fiber revealed a decrease in magnitude during the response, which suddenly increased upon lamellae separation (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2C; Movie S2). It is interesting to note that these analyses highlight that the increase in actin flow speed occurred in two phases; there was an abrupt spike immediately upon lamellae separation lasting ∼20 s (that coincided with the duration of lamella recoil) (Figure 1I), followed by an additional increase during cellular repolarization (Figures 2D and S2C). Analysis of instantaneous changes in flow direction also revealed an increase in rotation after lamellae contact (Figure 2E), which rapidly returned to levels observed in freely moving cells after lamellae separation (Figure 2F; Movie S2). The change in flow direction coincided with a movement of actin fibers within the lamella toward the nascent actin cable, which contributed to its formation (Figure S2D). Upon lamellae separation, the actin fiber deformed and was subsequently lost as the actin flow rapidly returned to its normal retrograde direction (Figure 2A; Movie S2). These data highlight that CIL involves a dramatic reorganization of the lamellar actin network. As a number of cell types have been reported to form transient inter-cellular adhesions during CIL (Gloushankova et al., 1998Gloushankova N.A. Krendel M.F. Alieva N.O. Bonder E.M. Feder H.H. Vasiliev J.M. Gelfand I.M. Dynamics of contacts between lamellae of fibroblasts: essential role of the actin cytoskeleton.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 4362-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, Theveneau et al., 2010Theveneau E. Marchant L. Kuriyama S. Gull M. Moepps B. Parsons M. Mayor R. Collective chemotaxis requires contact-dependent cell polarity.Dev. Cell. 2010; 19: 39-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether a cell-cell adhesion was responsible for the rapid and seemingly coordinated actin network changes in colliding hemocytes. As Zyxin is known to be a marker of both cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesions (Hirata et al., 2008Hirata H. Tatsumi H. Sokabe M. Zyxin emerges as a key player in the mechanotransduction at cell adhesive structures.Commun. Integr. Biol. 2008; 1: 192-195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we expressed mCherry-Zyxin in hemocytes and colocalized Zyxin-labeled adhesions with actin during CIL. Immediately upon lamellae overlap, a punctum of Zyxin developed at the site of cell-cell contact and persisted for the duration of the response (Figures 3A and 3B ; Movie S3). Subsequently, the actin fiber formed immediately behind this concentration of Zyxin (Figures 3A and 3B; Movie S3). We hypothesized that Zyxin foci represented transient cell-cell adhesions that modulate actin retrograde flow in a process analogous to the integrin-based actin-clutch reported in migrating cells in vitro (Gardel et al., 2008Gardel M.L. Sabass B. Ji L. Danuser G. Schwarz U.S. Waterman C.M. Traction stress in focal adhesions correlates biphasically with actin retrograde flow speed.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Indeed, visualization of Zyxin while analyzing actin flow revealed that after development of the Zyxin puncta the retrograde flow rate decreased within a corridor immediately behind (Figures 3C and 3D; Movie S3). Furthermore, microtubules polymerized toward this site of adhesion (Figure 3E; Movie S3). Immediately upon microtubule targeting of this adhesion, Zyxin levels decreased (Figure 3F). The development of an inter-cellular adhesion during CIL suggested that the colliding actin networks were becoming physically coupled. We therefore examined whether this coupling could lead to synchronous changes in actin retrograde flow in colliding cells. Investigation of the correlation between instantaneous changes in flow speed in colliding partners revealed an increase immediately upon lamellae overlap, which slowly diminished as cells remained in contact (Figure 3G). Subsequently, at the time of lamellae separation there was an additional abrupt increase in the correlation of instantaneous changes in flow speed (Figure 3H; Movie S3). Similarly, correlation between the instantaneous changes in flow direction of colliding partners showed an increase ∼20 s after lamellae contact, which remained high until the time of separation (Figures 3I and 3J). These data reveal that, similar to the orchestrated motion of colliding cells, the actin networks are behaving in a coordinated fashion during CIL. The sudden and synchronous retraction event that occurred upon cell separation (Figure 1H) suggested that tension is developing within the actin network during CIL. We therefore analyzed lamellar tension by laser abscission of the actin cytoskeleton as the recoil rate of the network is indicative of tension within the lamella. Ablating the leading edge or an actin fiber within the lamellae of a freely moving cell led to an initial recoil rate of 28.6 ± 6.8 and 33.2 ± 4.3 μm/min, respectively. Interestingly, the recoil was unidirectional toward the cell body when the ablation was performed within the lamella (Figures 4A and 4B ; Movie S4), which may be explained by a bias of myosin contraction toward the rear of the lamella (Svitkina et al., 1997Svitkina T.M. Verkhovsky A.B. McQuade K.M. Borisy G.G. Analysis of the actin-myosin II system in fish epidermal keratocytes: mechanism of cell body translocation.J.

Actin-myosin network reorganization breaks symmetry at the cell rear to spontaneously initiate polarized cell motility.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 1207-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In contrast, cutting the region of lamella overlap across the actin fiber linking colliding cells led to a significantly enhanced retraction rate of 65.8 ± 11.1 μm/min suggesting increased tension was stored within the actin network during CIL (Figures 4A and 4B; Movie S4). We subsequently modeled the amount of force present within the actin network by assuming that the actin cytoskeleton behaves elastically over short time scales (Gardel et al., 2004Gardel M.L. Shin J.H. MacKintosh F.C. Mahadevan L. Matsudaira P. Weitz D.A. Elastic behavior of cross-linked and bundled actin networks.Science. 2004; 304: 1301-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). Tracking edge displacement of the lamellae upon laser abscission allowed us to measure the changes in strain of the lamellar network as it retracts. This revealed that laser abscission of the lamellae leads to an initial rapid exponential decay that is caused by the sudden release of lamellar tension, followed by a slower linear phase as the retrograde actin flow continuously pulls in the network (Figure 4C). Assuming a lamellar stiffness similar to growth cones, the measured strain upon the release of the lamellar tension allowed us to infer the forces present within the actin network in freely moving and colliding cells. This revealed that forces in colliding lamellae were ∼3-fold higher than freely moving cells (Figure 4C). Furthermore, release of this tension by laser abscission during cell collision was sufficient to induce a rearward movement of the cell body away from the ablation site (Figure 4D; Movie S4). We also adapted previously developed techniques to infer the localization of stresses that drive the retrogr"

Proximal and distal social environmental factors and physical environmental factors have been associated with mental health, but the underlying mechanisms explaining these associations remain unclear. The study objective was to examine the contribution of different types of physical activity in mediating the relationship of social and physical environmental factors with mental health-related quality of life in middle-aged and older adults. Methods Baseline data from the Wellbeing, Eating and Exercise for a Long Life (WELL) study were used. WELL is a prospective cohort study, conducted in Victoria, Australia. Baseline data collection took place in 2010. In total, 3,965 middle-aged and older adults (55–65 years, 47.4% males) completed the SF-36 Health Survey, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and a questionnaire on socio-demographic, social and physical environmental attributes. Mediation analyses were conducted using the MacKinnon product-of-coefficients test. Results Personal safety, the neighbourhood physical activity environment, social support for physical activity from family or friends, and neighbourhood social cohesion were positively associated with mental health-related quality of life. Active transportation and leisure-time physical activity mediated 32.9% of the association between social support for physical activity from family or friends and mental health-related quality of life. These physical activity behaviours also mediated 11.0%, 3.4% and 2.3% respectively, of the relationship between the neighbourhood physical activity environment, personal safety and neighbourhood social cohesion and mental health-related quality of life. Conclusions If these results are replicated in future longitudinal studies, tailored interventions to improve mental health-related quality of life in middle-aged and older adults should use a combined strategy, focusing on increasing physical activity as well as social and physical environmental attributes."
https://openalex.org/W1996562004,"Background Macrophages are a heterogeneous cell population which in response to the cytokine milieu polarize in either classically activated macrophages (M1) or alternatively activated macrophages (M2). This plasticity makes macrophages essential in regulating inflammation, immune response and tissue remodeling and a novel therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis. The aim of the study was to describe the transcriptomic profiles of differently polarized human macrophages to generate new hypotheses on the biological function of the different macrophage subtypes. Methods and Results Polarization of circulating monocytes/macrophages of blood donors was induced in vitro by IFN-γ and LPS (M1), by IL-4 (M2a), and by IL-10 (M2c). Unstimulated cells (RM) served as time controls. Gene expression profile of M1, M2a, M2c and RM was assessed at 6, 12 and 24h after polarization with Whole Human Genome Agilent Microarray technique. When compared to RM, M1 significantly upregulated pathways involved in immunity and inflammation, whereas M2a did the opposite. Conversely, decreased and increased expression of mitochondrial metabolism, consistent with insulin resistant and insulin sensitive patterns, was seen in M1 and M2a, respectively. The time sequence in the expression of some pathways appeared to have some specific bearing on M1 function. Finally, canonical and non-canonical Wnt genes and gene groups, promoting inflammation and tissue remodeling, were upregulated in M2a compared to RM. Conclusion Our data in in vitro polarized human macrophages: 1. confirm and extend known inflammatory and anti-inflammatory gene expression patterns; 2. demonstrate changes in mitochondrial metabolism associated to insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity in M1 and M2a, respectively; 3. highlight the potential relevance of gene expression timing in M1 function; 4. unveil enhanced expression of Wnt pathways in M2a suggesting a potential dual (pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory) role of M2a in inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2035977785,"Isorhamnetin (Iso) is a flavonoid compound extracted from the Chinese herb Hippophae rhamnoides L. Previous studies have revealed its anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant activities. This study investigated the ability of Iso to inhibit oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced cell apoptosis in THP-1-derived macrophages. The effects of Iso on atherosclerosis in vivo were also evaluated in apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-/-) mice fed a high fat diet.Iso showed significant inhibitory effects on ox-LDL-induced THP-1-derived macrophage injuries via decreasing reactive oxygen species levels, lipid deposition, and caspase-3 activation, restoring mitochondrial membrane potential, reducing the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells, and regulating apoptosis-related proteins. We also determined the protective effects of Iso by PI3K/AKT activation and HO-1 induction. Iso reduced the atherosclerotic plaque size in vivo in ApoE-/- mice as assessed by oil red O, Sudan IV staining, and CD68-positive cells, and reduced macrophage apoptosis as assessed by caspase-3 and TUNEL assays in lesions.In conclusion, our results show that Iso inhibited atherosclerotic plaque development in ApoE-/- mice by PI3K/AKT activation and HO-1 induction."
https://openalex.org/W2017045575,"Photoimmunotherapy (PIT) of cancer utilizes tumor-specific monoclonal antibodies conjugated to a photosensitizer phthalocyanine dye IR700 which becomes cytotoxic upon irradiation with near infrared light. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of PIT on human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo in an orthotopic nude mouse model. The binding capacity of anti-CEA antibody to BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer cells was determined by FACS analysis. An in vitro cytotoxicity assay was used to determine cell death following treatment with PIT. For in vivo determination of PIT efficacy, nude mice were orthotopically implanted with BxPC-3 pancreatic tumors expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). After tumor engraftment, the mice were divided into two groups: (1) treatment with anti-CEA-IR700 + 690 nm laser and (2) treatment with 690 nm laser only. Anti-CEA-IR700 (100 μg) was administered to group (1) via tail vein injection 24 hours prior to therapy. Tumors were then surgically exposed and treated with phototherapy at an intensity of 150 mW/cm2 for 30 minutes. Whole body imaging was done subsequently for 5 weeks using an OV-100 small animal imaging system. Anti-CEA-IR700 antibody bound to the BxPC3 cells to a high degree as shown by FACS analysis. Anti-CEA-IR700 caused extensive cancer cell killing after light activation compared to control cells in cytotoxicity assays. In the orthotopic models of pancreatic cancer, the anti-CEA-IR700 group had significantly smaller tumors than the control after 5 weeks (p<0.001). There was no significant difference in the body weights of mice in the anti-CEA-IR700 and control groups indicating that PIT was well tolerated by the mice."
https://openalex.org/W2013084035,"Objective 
Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to improve wound healing, but the mechanism underlying this function is not well defined. Here, we explored the effect of NO on the migration of a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) and its possible mechanism.


Methods 
The effects of NO on HaCaT cells in the presence of different concentrations of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were evaluated in a cell migration assay. Subsequently, the cytoskeleton reorganization of cultured HaCaT cells stained with rhodamine-phalloidin was observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope. The mRNA expression and active proteins of CDC42, Rac1 and RhoA in the cultured cells were determined via RT-PCR and pull-down assays, respectively. Furthermore, the roles of various inhibitors or agonists specific to cGMP, PKG and CDC42, Rac1, RhoA in the effects of NO on HaCaT cell migration, F-actin stress fibre formation, and Rho GTPase expression were observed.


Results 
It was also found HaCaT cell migration was increased by SNP in a dose-dependent manner, and the other two NO donors either spermine NONOate or SNAP had almost the same effects on HaCat cell migrations. The formation of F-actin stress fibres in SNP-treated HaCaT cells was increased. The mRNA expression and the active proteins of CDC42, Rac1 and RhoA were found to be upregulated after SNP treatment. Similar effects were observed after the cells were treated with a cGMP or PKG agonist. Additionally, the SNP-mediated upregulation of the mRNA expression and the active proteins of CDC42, Rac1 and RhoA were inhibited by the addition of an inhibitor of cGMP or PKG. Moreover, the SNP-mediated promoting effects of migration and cytoskeleton reorganization were inhibited by treatment with inhibitors of cGMP, PKG, CDC42, Rac1 and RhoA respectively.


Conclusion 
Our data indicated that the stimulatory effects of NO on cell migration of HaCaT cells are mediated by the cGMP signalling pathway via the upregulation of Rho-GTPase expression, which might promote cytoskeleton reorganization."
https://openalex.org/W2063885268,"Hepatic expression profiling has revealed miRNA changes in liver diseases, while hepatic miR-155 expression was increased in murine non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, suggesting that miR-155 might regulate the biological process of lipid metabolism. To illustrate the effects of miR-155 gain of function in transgenic mouse liver on lipid metabolism, transgenic mice (i.e., Rm155LG mice) for the conditional overexpression of mouse miR-155 transgene mediated by Cre/lox P system were firstly generated around the world in this study. Rm155LG mice were further crossed to Alb-Cre mice to realize the liver-specific overexpression of miR-155 transgene in Rm155LG/Alb-Cre double transgenic mice which showed the unaltered body weight, liver weight, epididymal fat pad weight and gross morphology and appearance of liver. Furthermore, liver-specific overexpression of miR-155 transgene resulted in significantly reduced levels of serum total cholesterol, triglycerides (TG) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), as well as remarkably decreased contents of hepatic lipid, TG, HDL and free fatty acid in Rm155LG/Alb-Cre transgenic mice. More importantly, microarray data revealed a general downward trend in the expression profile of hepatic genes with functions typically associated with fatty acid, cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism, which is likely at least partially responsible for serum cholesterol and triglyceride lowering observed in Rm155LG/Alb-Cre mice. In this study, we demonstrated that hepatic overexpression of miR-155 alleviated nonalcoholic fatty liver induced by a high-fat diet. Additionally, carboxylesterase 3/triacylglycerol hydrolase (Ces3/TGH) was identified as a direct miR-155 target gene that is potentially responsible for the partial liver phenotypes observed in Rm155LG/Alb-Cre mice. Taken together, these data from miR-155 gain of function study suggest, for what we believe is the first time, the altered lipid metabolism and provide new insights into the metabolic state of the liver in Rm155LG/Alb-Cre mice."
https://openalex.org/W1998642098,"Matrix 2 protein ectodomain (M2e) is considered a promising candidate for a broadly protective influenza vaccine. M2e-based vaccines against human influenza A provide only partial protection against avian influenza viruses because of differences in the M2e sequences. In this work, we evaluated the possibility of obtaining equal protection and immune response by using recombinant protein on the basis of flagellin as a carrier of the M2e peptides of human and avian influenza A viruses. Recombinant protein was generated by the fusion of two tandem copies of consensus M2e sequence from human influenza A and two copies of M2e from avian A/H5N1 viruses to flagellin (Flg-2M2eh2M2ek). Intranasal immunisation of Balb/c mice with recombinant protein significantly elicited anti-M2e IgG in serum, IgG and sIgA in BAL. Antibodies induced by the fusion protein Flg-2M2eh2M2ek bound efficiently to synthetic peptides corresponding to the human consensus M2e sequence as well as to the M2e sequence of A/Chicken/Kurgan/05/05 RG (H5N1) and recognised native M2e epitopes exposed on the surface of the MDCK cells infected with A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Chicken/Kurgan/05/05 RG (H5N1) to an equal degree. Immunisation led to both anti-M2e IgG1 and IgG2a response with IgG1 prevalence. We observed a significant intracellular production of IL-4, but not IFN-γ, by CD4+ T-cells in spleen of mice following immunisation with Flg-2M2eh2M2ek. Immunisation with the Flg-2M2eh2M2ek fusion protein provided similar protection from lethal challenge with human influenza A viruses (H1N1, H3N2) and avian influenza virus (H5N1). Immunised mice experienced significantly less weight loss and decreased lung viral titres compared to control mice. The data obtained show the potential for the development of an M2e-flagellin candidate influenza vaccine with broad spectrum protection against influenza A viruses of various origins."
https://openalex.org/W2000874499,"Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7), a non-selective cation channel, is highly expressed expressed in the brain and plays a critical role in ischemic neuronal death. Astrocyte, the most abundant cell type in central nervous system (CNS), exerts many essential functions in the physiological and pathological conditions. Here we investigated the expression and functions of the TRPM7 channel in mouse cortical astrocytes. Using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, immunostaining, western blot and patch clamp recording, we showed that functional TRPM7 channel is expressed in cultured mouse cortical astrocytes. Knocking down TRPM7 with specific siRNA impairs the proliferation and migration of astrocytes by 40.2% ± 3.9% and 40.1% ± 11.5%, respectively. Consistently, inhibition of TRPM7 with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) also decreases astrocyte proliferation and migration by 46.1% ± 2.5% and 64.2% ± 2.4%. MAPKs and Akt signaling pathways have been shown to be implicated in TRPM7-mediated responses including cell proliferation and migration. Our data show that suppression of TRPM7 in astrocytes reduces the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), but not p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt. In addition, TRPM7, as a cation channel, has been involved in the Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ homeostasis in several types of cells. In our study, we found that silencing TRPM7 decreases the intracellular basal Mg²⁺ concentration without affecting Ca²⁺ concentration in astrocytes. However, an addition of Mg²⁺ to the growth medium could not rescue the impaired proliferation of astrocytes. Together, our data suggest that TRPM7 channel may play a critical role in the proliferation and migration of astrocytes via the ERK and JNK pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2092548622,"Functional neuroimaging has provided evidence for altered function of mesolimbic circuits implicated in reward processing, first and foremost the ventral striatum, in patients with schizophrenia. While such findings based on significant group differences in brain activations can provide important insights into the pathomechanisms of mental disorders, the use of neuroimaging results from standard univariate statistical analysis for individual diagnosis has proven difficult. In this proof of concept study, we tested whether the predictive accuracy for the diagnostic classification of schizophrenia patients vs. healthy controls could be improved using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of regional functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation patterns for the anticipation of monetary reward. With a searchlight MVPA approach using support vector machine classification, we found that the diagnostic category could be predicted from local activation patterns in frontal, temporal, occipital and midbrain regions, with a maximal cluster peak classification accuracy of 93% for the right pallidum. Region-of-interest based MVPA for the ventral striatum achieved a maximal cluster peak accuracy of 88%, whereas the classification accuracy on the basis of standard univariate analysis reached only 75%. Moreover, using support vector regression we could additionally predict the severity of negative symptoms from ventral striatal activation patterns. These results show that MVPA can be used to substantially increase the accuracy of diagnostic classification on the basis of task-related fMRI signal patterns in a regionally specific way."
https://openalex.org/W2046356600,"Increased level of oxidative stress, a major actor of cellular aging, impairs the regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle and leads to the reduction in the number and size of muscle fibers causing sarcopenia. Caveolin 1 is the major component of caveolae, small membrane invaginations involved in signaling and endocytic trafficking. Their role has recently expanded to mechanosensing and to the regulation of oxidative stress-induced pathways. Here, we increased the amount of reactive oxidative species in myoblasts by addition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at non-toxic concentrations. The expression level of caveolin 1 was significantly decreased as early as 10 min after 500 μM H2O2 treatment. This reduction was not observed in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that caveolin 1 was rapidly degraded by the proteasome. In spite of caveolin 1 decrease, caveolae were still able to assemble at the plasma membrane. Their functions however were significantly perturbed by oxidative stress. Endocytosis of a ceramide analog monitored by flow cytometry was significantly diminished after H2O2 treatment, indicating that oxidative stress impaired its selective internalization via caveolae. The contribution of caveolae to the plasma membrane reservoir has been monitored after osmotic cell swelling. H2O2 treatment increased membrane fragility revealing that treated cells were more sensitive to an acute mechanical stress. Altogether, our results indicate that H2O2 decreased caveolin 1 expression and impaired caveolae functions. These data give new insights on age-related deficiencies in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2043191931,"Radiation dose reconstruction systems for large-scale epidemiological studies are sophisticated both in providing estimates of dose and in representing dosimetry uncertainty. For example, a computer program was used by the Hanford Thyroid Disease Study to provide 100 realizations of possible dose to study participants. The variation in realizations reflected the range of possible dose for each cohort member consistent with the data on dose determinates in the cohort. Another example is the Mayak Worker Dosimetry System 2013 which estimates both external and internal exposures and provides multiple realizations of ""possible"" dose history to workers given dose determinants. This paper takes up the problem of dealing with complex dosimetry systems that provide multiple realizations of dose in an epidemiologic analysis. In this paper we derive expected scores and the information matrix for a model used widely in radiation epidemiology, namely the linear excess relative risk (ERR) model that allows for a linear dose response (risk in relation to radiation) and distinguishes between modifiers of background rates and of the excess risk due to exposure. We show that treating the mean dose for each individual (calculated by averaging over the realizations) as if it was true dose (ignoring both shared and unshared dosimetry errors) gives asymptotically unbiased estimates (i.e. the score has expectation zero) and valid tests of the null hypothesis that the ERR slope β is zero. Although the score is unbiased the information matrix (and hence the standard errors of the estimate of β) is biased for β≠0 when ignoring errors in dose estimates, and we show how to adjust the information matrix to remove this bias, using the multiple realizations of dose. The use of these methods in the context of several studies including, the Mayak Worker Cohort, and the U.S. Atomic Veterans Study, is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1964440935,"Given the diminished role of biotic interactions in soils of continental Antarctica, abiotic factors are believed to play a dominant role in structuring of microbial communities. However, many ice-free regions remain unexplored, and it is unclear which environmental gradients are primarily responsible for the variations among bacterial communities. In this study, we investigated the soil bacterial community around Terra Nova Bay of Victoria Land by pyrosequencing and determined which environmental variables govern the bacterial community structure at the local scale. Six bacterial phyla, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, were dominant, but their relative abundance varied greatly across locations. Bacterial community structures were affected little by spatial distance, but structured more strongly by site, which was in accordance with the soil physicochemical compositions. At both the phylum and species levels, bacterial community structure was explained primarily by pH and water content, while certain earth elements and trace metals also played important roles in shaping community variation. The higher heterogeneity of the bacterial community structure found at this site indicates how soil bacterial communities have adapted to different compositions of edaphic variables under extreme environmental conditions. Taken together, these findings greatly advance our understanding of the adaption of soil bacterial populations to this harsh environment."
https://openalex.org/W2018332716,"In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), hallmark β-amyloid deposits are characterized by the presence of activated microglia around them. Despite an extensive characterization of the relation of amyloid plaques with microglia, little is known about the initiation of this interaction. In this study, the detailed investigation of very small plaques in brain slices in AD transgenic mice of the line APP-PS1(dE9) revealed different levels of microglia recruitment. Analysing plaques with a diameter of up to 10 μm we find that only the half are associated with clear morphologically activated microglia. Utilizing in vivo imaging of new appearing amyloid plaques in double-transgenic APP-PS1(dE9)xCX3CR1+/- mice further characterized the dynamic of morphological microglia activation. We observed no correlation of morphological microglia activation and plaque volume or plaque lifetime. Taken together, our results demonstrate a very prominent variation in size as well as in lifetime of new plaques relative to the state of microglia reaction. These observations might question the existing view that amyloid deposits by themselves are sufficient to attract and activate microglia in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1512803352,"This study analyzes data sharing regarding mitochondrial, Y chromosomal and autosomal polymorphisms in a total of 162 papers on ancient human DNA published between 1988 and 2013. The estimated sharing rate was not far from totality (97.6% ± 2.1%) and substantially higher than observed in other fields of genetic research (evolutionary, medical and forensic genetics). Both a questionnaire-based survey and the examination of Journals’ editorial policies suggest that this high sharing rate cannot be simply explained by the need to comply with stakeholders requests. Most data were made available through body text, but the use of primary databases increased in coincidence with the introduction of complete mitochondrial and next-generation sequencing methods. Our study highlights three important aspects. First, our results imply that researchers’ awareness of the importance of openness and transparency for scientific progress may complement stakeholders’ policies in achieving very high sharing rates. Second, widespread data sharing does not necessarily coincide with a prevalent use of practices which maximize data findability, accessibility, useability and preservation. A detailed look at the different ways in which data are released can be very useful to detect failures to adopt the best sharing modalities and understand how to correct them. Third and finally, the case of human paleogenetics tells us that a widespread awareness of the importance of Open Science may be important to build reliable scientific practices even in the presence of complex experimental challenges."
https://openalex.org/W1991790682,"Several natural and synthetic flavone derivatives have been reported to inhibit formation of amyloid fibrils or to remodel existing fibrils. These studies suggest that the numbers and positions of hydroxyl groups on the flavone rings determine their effectiveness as amyloid inhibitors. In many studies the primary method for determining the effectiveness of inhibition is measuring Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence. This method demonstrably results in a number of false positives for inhibition. We studied the effects of 265 commercially available flavone derivatives on insulin fibril formation. We enhanced the effectiveness of ThT fluorescence measurements by fitting kinetic curves to obtain halftime of aggregation (t50). Maximal values of ThT fluorescence varied two fold or more in one third of all cases, but this did not correlate with changes in t50. Changes in t50 values were more accurate measures of inhibition of amyloid formation. We showed that without a change in an assay, but just by observing complete kinetic curves it is possible to eliminate numbers of false positive and sometimes even false negative results. Examining the data from all 265 flavones we confirmed previous observations that identified the importance of hydroxyl groups for inhibition. Our evidence suggests the importance of hydroxyl groups at locations 5, 6, 7, and 4’, and the absence of a hydroxyl group at location 3, for inhibiting amyloid formation. However, the main conclusion is that the positions are not additive. The structures and their effects must be thought of in the context of the whole molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2123661100,"Introduction Rural communities in low-income countries lack vital registrations to track birth outcomes. We aimed to examine the feasibility of community-based birth registration and measure maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in rural south Ethiopia. Methods In 2010, health extension workers (HEWs) registered births and maternal deaths among 421,639 people in three districts (Derashe, Bonke, and Arba Minch Zuria). One nurse-supervisor per district provided administrative and technical support to HEWs. The primary outcomes were the feasibility of registration of a high proportion of births and measuring MMR. The secondary outcome was the proportion of skilled birth attendance. We validated the completeness of the registry and the MMR by conducting a house-to-house survey in 15 randomly selected villages in Bonke. Results We registered 10,987 births (81·4% of expected 13,492 births) with annual crude birth rate of 32 per 1,000 population. The validation study showed that, of 2,401 births occurred in the surveyed households within eight months of the initiation of the registry, 71·6% (1,718) were registered with similar MMRs (474 vs. 439) between the registered and unregistered births. Overall, we recorded 53 maternal deaths; MMR was 489 per 100,000 live births and 83% (44 of 53 maternal deaths) occurred at home. Ninety percent (9,863 births) were at home, 4% (430) at health posts, 2·5% (282) at health centres, and 3·5% (412) in hospitals. MMR increased if: the male partners were illiterate (609 vs. 346; p= 0·051) and the villages had no road access (946 vs. 410; p= 0·039). The validation helped to increase the registration coverage by 10% through feedback discussions. Conclusion It is possible to obtain a high-coverage birth registration and measure MMR in rural communities where a functional system of community health workers exists. The MMR was high in rural south Ethiopia and most births and maternal deaths occurred at home."
https://openalex.org/W1997766027,"Inflammasomes coordinate the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18 in response to danger signals. They are vital for maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and have been linked to chronic intestinal inflammation in humans. Probiotics have been advocated as treatment in intestinal inflammation. So far, no study has investigated the role of the inflammasome in canine chronic enteropathy (CE). In this study the intestinal expression of inflammasome components was assessed in CE dogs compared to controls, when treated with probiotic Enterococcus faecium (EF) ex-vivo and in-vivo. RNA extraction from endoscopic biopsies and reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR was performed for NLRP3, casp-1, IL-1β and IL-18. Immunohistochemistry was performed to investigate protein expression in tissues. Gene expression of casp-1 and NLRP3 was lower in CE samples than controls. Ex-vivo treatment with EF reduced NLRP3 expression in control samples. Treatment of CE dogs with EF alongside dietary intervention had no effect on gene expression. In contrast, IL-1β protein expression in CE decreased with dietary treatment (but not with probiotics). The results of this study suggest that the inflammasome or its components may be partially involved in the inflammatory process seen in CE, but distinct from intestinal inflammation in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2076202104,"Aberrant glycosylation changes normal cellular functions and represents a specific hallmark of cancer. Lewisy (Ley) carbohydrate upregulation has been reported in a variety of cancers, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). A high level of Ley expression is related to poor prognosis of patients with oral cancer. However, it is unclear how Ley mediates oral cancer progression. In this study, the role of Ley in OSCC was explored. Our data showed that Ley was upregulated in HSC-3 and OC-2 OSCC cell lines. Particularly, glycosylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with Ley was found in OC-2 cells, and this modification was absent upon inhibition of Ley synthesis. The absence of Ley glycosylation of EGFR weakened phosphorylation of AKT and ERK in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF). Additionally, EGF-triggered cell migration was reduced, but cell proliferation was not affected. Ley modification stabilized EGFR upon ligand activation. Conversely, absence of Ley glycosylation accelerated EGFR degradation. In summary, these results indicate that increased expression of Ley in OSCC cells is able to promote cell migration by modifying EGFR which in turn stabilizes EGFR expression and downstream signaling. Targeting Ley on EGFR could have a potential therapeutic effect on oral cancer."

In this paper, we report a data processing algorithm based on the one-dimensional Hilbert transform, which needs only two raw images with arbitrary phase-shift for each single slice. The proposed algorithm is different from the previous two-dimensional Hilbert spiral transform algorithm in theory. The presented algorithm has the advantages of simpler data processing procedure, faster computation speed and better reconstructed image quality. The validity of the scheme is verified by imaging biological samples in our developed DMD-based LED-illumination SIM system."

To accelerate the pummelo breeding program, it is essential to obtain extensive genetic information and develop relative molecular markers. Here, we obtained a 12-Gb transcriptome dataset of pummelo through a mixture of RNA from seven tissues using Illumina pair-end sequencing, assembled into 57,212 unigenes with an average length of 1010 bp. The annotation and classification results showed that a total of 39,584 unigenes had similar hits to the known proteins of four public databases, and 31,501 were classified into 55 Gene Ontology (GO) functional sub-categories. The search for putative molecular markers among 57,212 unigenes identified 10,276 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 64,720 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). High-quality primers of 1174 SSR loci were designed, of which 88.16% were localized to nine chromosomes of sweet orange. Of 100 SSR primers that were randomly selected for testing, 87 successfully amplified clear banding patterns. Of these primers, 29 with a mean PIC (polymorphic information content) value of 0.52 were effectively applied for phylogenetic analysis. Of the 20 SNP primers, 14 primers, including 54 potential SNPs, yielded target amplifications, and 46 loci were verified via Sanger sequencing. This new dataset will be a valuable resource for molecular biology studies of pummelo and provides reliable information regarding SNP and SSR marker development, thus expediting the breeding program of pummelo."
https://openalex.org/W2061146896,"A worldwide survey of Wallemia occurring in house dust and indoor air was conducted. The isolated strains were identified as W. sebi and W. muriae. Previous studies suggested that the W. sebi phylogenetic clade contained cryptic species but conclusive evidence was lacking because only the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) marker was analyzed. The ITS and four protein-coding genes (MCM7, RPB1, RPB2, and TSR1) were sequenced for 85 isolates. Based on an initial neighbor joining analysis of the concatenated genes, W. muriae remained monophyletic but four clades were found in W. sebi, which we designated as W. sebi clades 1, 2, 3, and 4. We hypothesized that these clades represent distinct phylogenetic species within the Wallemia sebi species complex (WSSC). We then conducted multiple phylogenetic analyses and demonstrated genealogical concordance, which supports the existence of four phylogenetic species within the WSSC. Geographically, W. muriae was only found in Europe, W. sebi clade 3 was only found in Canada, W. sebi clade 4 was found in subtropical regions, while W. sebi clade 1 and 2 were found worldwide. Haplotype analysis showed that W. sebi clades 1 and 2 had multiple haplotypes while W. sebi clades 3 and 4 had one haplotype and may have been under sampled. We describe W. sebi clades 2, 3, and 4 as new species in a companion study."
https://openalex.org/W2008897130,"Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystemic disease caused by toxic RNA from a DMPK gene carrying an expanded (CTG•CAG)n repeat. Promising strategies for treatment of DM1 patients are currently being tested. These include antisense oligonucleotides and drugs for elimination of expanded RNA or prevention of aberrant binding to RNP proteins. A significant hurdle for preclinical development along these lines is efficient systemic delivery of compounds across endothelial and target cell membranes. It has been reported that DM1 patients show elevated levels of markers of muscle damage or loss of sarcolemmal integrity in their serum and that splicing of dystrophin, an essential protein for muscle membrane structure, is abnormal. Therefore, we studied cell membrane integrity in DM1 mouse models commonly used for preclinical testing. We found that membranes in skeletal muscle, heart and brain were impermeable to Evans Blue Dye. Creatine kinase levels in serum were similar to those in wild type mice and expression of dystrophin protein was unaffected. Also in patient muscle biopsies cell surface expression of dystrophin was normal and calcium-positive fibers, indicating elevated intracellular calcium levels, were only rarely seen. Combined, our findings indicate that cells in DM1 tissues do not display compromised membrane integrity. Hence, the cell membrane is a barrier that must be overcome in future work towards effective drug delivery in DM1 therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1978971469,"Larger, and deeper, root systems of new maize varieties, compared to older varieties, are thought to have enabled improved acquisition of soil resources and, consequently, greater grain yields. To compare the spatial distributions of the root systems of new and old maize varieties and their relationships with spatial variations in soil concentrations of available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), two years of field experiments were performed using six Chinese maize varieties released in different eras. Vertical distributions of roots, and available N, P and K in the 0-60 cm soil profile were determined in excavated soil monoliths at silking and maturity. The results demonstrated that new maize varieties had larger root dry weight, higher grain yield and greater nutrient accumulation than older varieties. All varieties had similar total root length and vertical root distribution at silking, but newer varieties maintained greater total root length and had more roots in the 30-60 cm soil layers at maturity. The spatial variation of soil mineral N (Nmin) in each soil horizon was larger than that of Olsen-P and ammonium-acetate-extractable K, and was inversely correlated with root length density (RLD), especially in the 0-20 cm soil layer. It was concluded that greater acquisition of mineral nutrients and higher yields of newer varieties were associated with greater total root length at maturity. The negative relationship between RLD and soil Nmin at harvest for all varieties suggests the importance of the spatial distribution of the root system for N uptake by maize."
https://openalex.org/W1980310166,"Since 1986, studies about the escape decisions made by prey are grounded in optimal escape theory (OET) which states that prey will initiate escape when the risk of remaining and the costs of leaving are equal. However, a recent hypothesis, Flush Early and Avoid the Rush (FEAR), acknowledged that the cost of monitoring approaching predators might be a ubiquitous cost. The FEAR hypothesis predicts that prey will generally flee soon after they detect a predator so as to minimize the costs incurred by monitoring the predator. Knowing whether animals flee to reduce monitoring costs is of applied interest because wildlife managers use escape behavior to create set-back zones to reduce human-wildlife conflict. Here we provide the most comprehensive assessment of the FEAR hypothesis using data collected from 178 bird species representing 67 families from two continents. The FEAR hypothesis explains escape behavior in 79% of studied species. Because the FEAR hypothesis is a widespread phenomenon that drives escape behavior in birds, alert distance must be systematically incorporated into the design of set-back zones to protect vulnerable species."

Here we report the analytical sensitivities of the Versant CT/GC 1.0 assay (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY, USA) on rectal and pharyngeal swabs, and an evaluation about the suitability for this assay with two widely used swab collection devices (E-Swab and eNAT, Copan, Brescia, Italy). The limits of detection for rectal and pharyngeal specimens with the Versant assay were 10 copies/ml and 1.0 copies/ml, for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae, respectively. False positive results due to the presence of non-gonococcal Neisseria species were excluded when clinical rectal and pharyngeal samples containing organisms identified as N. meningitidis, N. sicca, N. flavescens and N. subflava were tested. Due to its sensitivity and specificity, the Versant assay represents a good choice for the diagnosis of chlamydial and/or gonococcal infections not only in genito-urinary samples, but also on rectal and pharyngeal swabs."
https://openalex.org/W2067497615,"Although there is a substantial body of work on how temperature shapes coastal marine ecosystems, the spatiotemporal variability of seawater pH and corresponding in situ biological responses remain largely unknown across biogeographic ranges of tropical coral species. Environmental variability is important to characterize because it can amplify or dampen the biological consequences of global change, depending on the functional relationship between mean temperature or pH and organismal traits. Here, we characterize the spatiotemporal variability of pH, temperature, and salinity at fringing reefs in Moorea, French Polynesia and Nanwan Bay, Taiwan using advanced time series analysis, including wavelet analysis, and infer their potential impact on the persistence and stability of coral populations. Our results demonstrate that both the mean and variance of pH and temperature differed significantly between sites in Moorea and Taiwan. Seawater temperature at the Moorea site passed the local bleaching threshold several times within the ~45 day deployment while aragonite saturation state at the Taiwan site was often below commonly observed levels for coral reefs. Our results showcase how a better understanding of the differences in environmental conditions between sites can (1) provide an important frame of reference for designing laboratory experiments to study the effects of environmental variability, (2) identify the proximity of current environmental conditions to predicted biological thresholds for the coral reef, and (3) help predict when the temporal variability and mean of environmental conditions will interact synergistically or antagonistically to alter the abundance and stability of marine populations experiencing climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2131622333,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have already identified at least 22 common susceptibility loci associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). This study examined the relationship between these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the clinical outcomes of patients with colorectal cancer. Seven hundred seventy-six patients with surgically resected colorectal adenocarcinoma were enrolled in the present study. Twenty-two of the GWAS-identified SNPs were genotyped using a Sequenom MassARRAY. Among the 22 SNPs, two (rs1321311G>T in CDKN1A and rs10411210C>T in RHPN2) were significantly associated with the survival outcomes of CRC in a multivariate survival analysis. In a recessive model, the rs1321311 TT genotype (vs. GG + GT) and rs10411210 TT genotype (vs. CC + CT) were associated with a worse prognosis for disease-free survival (adjusted HR = 1.90; 95% confidence interval = 1.00-3.60; P = 0.050, adjusted HR = 1.94; 95% confidence interval = 1.05-3.57; P = 0.034, respectively) and overall survival (adjusted HR = 2.05; 95% confidence interval = 1.00-4.20; P = 0.049, adjusted HR = 2.06; 95% confidence interval = 1.05-4.05; P = 0.036, respectively). None of the other SNPs was significantly associated with any clinicopathologic features or survival. The present results suggest that the genetic variants of the CDKN1A (rs1321311) and RHPN2 (rs10411210) genes can be used as prognostic biomarkers for patients with surgically resected colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2141338484,"Many regions around the world concentrate a large number of highly endangered species that have very restricted distributions. The mountainous region of central Veracruz, Mexico, is considered a priority area for amphibian conservation because of its high level of endemism and the number of threatened species. The original tropical montane cloud forest in the region has been dramatically reduced and fragmented and is now mainly confined to ravines and hillsides. We evaluated the current situation of amphibian diversity in the cloud forest fragments of this region by analyzing species richness and abundance, comparing assemblage structure and species composition, examining the distribution and abundance of threatened species, and identifying the local and landscape variables associated with the observed amphibian diversity. From June to October 2012 we sampled ten forest fragments, investing 944 person-hours of sampling effort. A total of 895 amphibians belonging to 16 species were recorded. Notable differences in species richness, abundance, and assemblage structure between forest fragments were observed. Species composition between pairs of fragments differed by an average of 53%, with the majority (58%) resulting from species replacement and the rest (42%) explained by differences in species richness. Half of the species detected are under threat of extinction according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and although their distribution and abundance varied markedly, there were also ubiquitous and abundant species, along with rare species of restricted distribution. The evident heterogeneity of the ten study sites indicates that to conserve amphibians in a mountainous region such as this one it is necessary to protect groups of fragments which represent the variability of the system. Both individually and together cloud forest fragments are very important to conservation because each remnant is inhabited by several threatened species, some of them at imminent risk of extinction."
https://openalex.org/W2038491972,"Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) contributes to the high mortality and morbidity in patients. Although the pathogenesis of AKI during sepsis is poorly understood, it is well accepted that plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and vitronectin (Vn) are involved in AKI. However, the functional cooperation between PAI-1 and Vn in septic AKI has not been completely elucidated. To address this issue, mice were utilized lacking either PAI-1 (PAI-1-/-) or expressing a PAI-1-mutant (PAI-1R101A/Q123K) in which the interaction between PAI-1 and Vn is abrogated, while other functions of PAI-1 are retained. It was found that both PAI-1-/- and PAI-1R101A/Q123K mice are associated with decreased renal dysfunction, apoptosis, inflammation, and ERK activation as compared to wild-type (WT) mice after LPS challenge. Also, PAI-1-/- mice showed attenuated fibrin deposition in the kidneys. Furthermore, a lack of PAI-1 or PAI-1-Vn interaction was found to be associated with an increase in activated Protein C (aPC) in plasma. These results demonstrate that PAI-1, through its interaction with Vn, exerts multiple deleterious mechanisms to induce AKI. Therefore, targeting of the PAI-1-Vn interaction in kidney represents an appealing therapeutic strategy for the treatment of septic AKI by not only altering the fibrinolytic capacity but also regulating PC activity."
https://openalex.org/W2060017979,"Purpose Combination of percutaneous microwave ablation (PMWA) and intravenous injection of 131I-hypericin(IIIH) may bear potential as a mini-invasive treatment for tumor. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of PMWA and IIIH in breast tumor growth. Methods Ten New Zealand White rabbits bearing VX2 breast carcinomas were randomly divided into two groups (each 5 examples) and processed using PMWA followed by IIIH and IIIH alone. The IIIH activity was evaluated using planar scintigraphy, autoradiography and biodistribution analysis. The maximum effective safe dose of IIIH was found through 48 rabbits with VX2 breast tumor, which were randomized into six groups (n=8 per group). Subsequently, a further 75 rabbits bearing VX2 breast solid tumors were randomly divided into five groups (each 15 examples) and treated as follows: A, no treatment group; B, PMWA alone; C, IIIH alone; D, PMWA+IIIH×1 (at 8 h post-PMWA); and E, PMWA+IIIH×2 (at 8 h and at 8 days post-PMWA). The therapeutic effect was assessed by measurement of tumor size and performation of positron emission tomography/computed tomograph (PET/CT) scans, liver and renal function tests and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results The planar scintigraphy findings suggested a significant uptake of 131I in necrotic tumor tissue. The autoradiography gray scales indicated higher selective uptake of IIIH by necrotic tissue, with significant differences between the groups with and those without necrotic tumor tissue (P<0.05). The maximum effective safe dose of IIIH was 1mCi/kg. The PET/CT scans and tumor size measurement suggested improvements in treatment groups at all time points (P<0.01). Significant differences were detected among Groups A, B, D and E (P<0.05). Lower levels of lung metastasis were detected in Groups D and E (P<0.05). There were no abnormalities in liver and renal functions tests or other reported side effects. Conclusion IIIH exhibited selective uptake by necrotic tumor tissue. Sequential therapy involving PMWA+IIIH was successfully inhibiting tumor growth and prolonging survival."
https://openalex.org/W1974016658,"Codon optimization of nucleotide sequences is a widely used method to achieve high levels of transgene expression for basic and clinical research. Until now, immunological side effects have not been described. To trigger T cell responses against human papillomavirus, we incubated T cells with dendritic cells that were pulsed with RNA encoding the codon-optimized E7 oncogene. All T cell receptors isolated from responding T cell clones recognized target cells expressing the codon-optimized E7 gene but not the wild type E7 sequence. Epitope mapping revealed recognition of a cryptic epitope from the +3 alternative reading frame of codon-optimized E7, which is not encoded by the wild type E7 sequence. The introduction of a stop codon into the +3 alternative reading frame protected the transgene product from recognition by T cell receptor gene-modified T cells. This is the first experimental study demonstrating that codon optimization can render a transgene artificially immunogenic through generation of a dominant cryptic epitope. This finding may be of great importance for the clinical field of gene therapy to avoid rejection of gene-corrected cells and for the design of DNA- and RNA-based vaccines, where codon optimization may artificially add a strong immunogenic component to the vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W1990406743,"Background and Objectives Acute kidney injury (AKI) necessitating renal replacement therapy (RRT) is associated with high mortality and increased risk for end stage renal disease. However, it is unknown if this applies to patients with a preliminary unremarkable medical history. The purpose of this study was to describe overall and renal survival in critically ill patients with AKI necessitating RRT stratified by the presence of comorbidity. Design, Setting, Participants, and Measurements A retrospective cohort study was performed, between 1994 and 2010, including all adult critically ill patients with AKI necessitating RRT, stratified by the presence of comorbidity. Logistic regression, survival curve and cox proportional hazards analyses were used to evaluate overall and renal survival. Standardized mortality rate (SMR) analysis was performed to compare long-term survival to the predicted survival in the Dutch population. Results Of the 1067 patients included only 96(9.0%) had no comorbidity. Hospital mortality was 56.6% versus 43.8% in patients with and without comorbidity, respectively. In those who survived hospitalization 10-year survival was 45.0% and 86.0%, respectively. Adjusted for age, sex and year of treatment, absence of comorbidity was not associated with hospital mortality (OR=0.74, 95%-CI=0.47-1.15), while absence of comorbidity was associated with better long-term survival (adjusted HR=0.28, 95%-CI = 0.14-0.58). Compared to the Dutch population, patients without comorbidity had a similar mortality risk (SMR=1.6, 95%-CI=0.7-3.2), while this was increased in patients with comorbidity (SMR=4.8, 95%-CI=4.1-5.5). Regarding chronic dialysis dependency, 10-year renal survival rates were 76.0% and 92.9% in patients with and without comorbidity, respectively. Absence of comorbidity was associated with better renal survival (adjusted HR=0.24, 95%-CI=0.07-0.76). Conclusions While hospital mortality remains excessively high, the absence of comorbidity in critically ill patients with RRT-requiring AKI is associated with a relative good long-term prognosis in those who survive hospitalization."
https://openalex.org/W1980598402,"Aims Resident cardiac progenitor cells show homing properties when injected into the injured but not to the healthy myocardium. The molecular background behind this difference in behavior needs to be studied to elucidate how adult progenitor cells can restore cardiac function of the damaged myocardium. Since the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) moderates cardioprotection in injured hearts, we focused on delineating its regulatory role in the damaged myocardium. Methods and Results Comparative gene expression profiling of freshly isolated undifferentiated Sca-1 progenitor cells derived either from heart failure transgenic αMHC-CyclinT1/Gαq overexpressing mice or wildtype littermates revealed transcriptional variations. Bdnf expression was up regulated 5-fold during heart failure which was verified by qRT-PCR and confirmed at protein level. The migratory capacity of Sca-1 cells from transgenic hearts was improved by 15% in the presence of 25ng/ml BDNF. Furthermore, BDNF-mediated effects on Sca-1 cells were studied via pulsed Stable Isotope Labeling of Amino acids in Cell Culture (pSILAC) proteomics approach. After BDNF treatment significant differences between newly synthesized proteins in Sca-1 cells from control and transgenic hearts were observed for CDK1, SRRT, HDGF, and MAP2K3 which are known to regulate cell cycle, survival and differentiation. Moreover BDNF repressed the proliferation of Sca-1 cells from transgenic hearts. Conclusion Comparative profiling of resident Sca-1 cells revealed elevated BDNF levels in the failing heart. Exogenous BDNF (i) stimulated migration, which might improve the homing ability of Sca-1 cells derived from the failing heart and (ii) repressed the cell cycle progression suggesting its potency to ameliorate heart failure."

Methods 716 students were recruited from 6 middle or high schools in Hangzhou, China. The Chinese version of the Youth Quality of Life Instrument–Weight Module (YQOL-W) was self administered. The YQOL-W scores were compared among different BMI groups, gender, educational status, annual household income, parental education and recruitment community using t test or one-way analysis of variance. The independent association of these variables with QOL among overweight and obese students was examined using multivariable linear regression modeling. Results Overweight and obese students reported lower total scores, self, social and environment scores than their normal weight peers (all P<0.001). The QOL of overweight and obese middle and high school students was associated with BMI value, gender, educational status, parental education, and recruitment community. Girls had lower total scores, self, social and environment domain scores than boys (all P<0.001); high school students had lower total and three domain scores than middle school students (all P<0.05). Students whose fathers had higher education reported higher total scores, self and social scores than students with less educated fathers (all P<0.05). Students whose mothers had higher education reported higher environment scores than students with less educated mothers (P = 0.01). Students from migrant communities reported significantly lower total scores, self and social scores than those from rural communities (all P<0.05), but comparable scores with those from urban communities (P>0.05). Students from migrant communities reported comparable environment scores with those from rural and urban communities (P>0.05). Conclusions Overweight and obesity have negative effects on students’ quality of life. Therefore weight specific QOL could be included in weight reduction interventions as a relevant outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2003244597,"The way we experience the space around us is highly subjective. It has been shown that motion potentialities that are intrinsic to our body influence our space categorization. Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that in the extrapersonal space, our categorization also depends on the movement potential of other agents. When we have to categorize the space as “Near” or “Far” between a reference and a target, the space categorized as “Near” is wider if the reference corresponds to a biological agent that has the potential to walk, instead of a biological and non-biological agent that cannot walk. But what exactly drives this “Near space extension”? In the present paper, we tested whether abstract beliefs about the biological nature of an agent determine how we categorize the space between the agent and an object. Participants were asked to first read a Pinocchio story and watch a correspondent video in which Pinocchio acts like a real human, in order to become more transported into the initial story. Then they had to categorize the location (""Near"" or ""Far"") of a target object located at progressively increasing or decreasing distances from a non-biological agent (i.e., a wooden dummy) and from a biological agent (i.e., a human-like avatar). The results indicate that being transported into the Pinocchio story, induces an equal “Near” space threshold with both the avatar and the wooden dummy as reference frames."
https://openalex.org/W2317978146,"Empirical findings on public goods dilemmas indicate an unresolved dilemma: that increasing size—the number of people in the dilemma—sometimes increases, decreases, or does not influence cooperation. We clarify this dilemma by first classifying public goods dilemma properties that specify individual outcomes as individual properties (e.g., Marginal Per Capita Return) and group outcomes as group properties (e.g., public good multiplier), mathematically showing how only one set of properties can remain constant as the dilemma size increases. Underpinning decision-making regarding individual and group properties, we propose that individuals are motivated by both individual and group preferences based on a theory of collective rationality. We use Van Lange's integrated model of social value orientations to operationalize these preferences as an amalgamation of outcomes for self, outcomes for others, and equality of outcomes. Based on this model, we then predict how the public good's benefit and size, combined with controlling individual versus group properties, produce different levels of cooperation in public goods dilemmas. A two (low vs. high benefit) by three (2-person baseline vs. 5-person holding constant individual properties vs. 5-person holding constant group properties) factorial experiment (group n = 99; participant n = 390) confirms our hypotheses. The results indicate that when holding constant group properties, size decreases cooperation. Yet when holding constant individual properties, size increases cooperation when benefit is low and does not affect cooperation when benefit is high. Using agent-based simulations of individual and group preferences vis-à-vis the integrative model, we fit a weighted simulation model to the empirical data. This fitted model is sufficient to reproduce the empirical results, but only when both individual (self-interest) and group (other-interest and equality) preference are included. Our research contributes to understanding how people's motivations and behaviors within public goods dilemmas interact with the properties of the dilemma to lead to collective outcomes."

The differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) within 7 sub-regions of the CC were compared between the two groups. Compared to the controls, PTSD coal miners exhibited significantly reduced FA values in the anterior sub-regions of the CC (P < 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected), which mainly interconnect the bilateral frontal cortices. Our findings indicated that the anterior part of the CC was more severely impaired than the posterior part in young adult-onset PTSD, which suggested the patterns of CC impairment may depend on the developmental stage of the structure when the PTSD occurs."

SPR immunoassay with a regular competitive inhibition assay cannot be directly verified to detect CLB residuals. In this study, the binding of Au film with mercaptopropionic acid was investigated using the known form of the strong S-Au covalent bonds formed by the chemical radical of the mercaptopropionic acid and the Au film. After that, the immunoglobulin IgG of swine (SwIgG-CLB) was bonded with the mercaptopropionic acid by covalent -CO-NH- amide bonding. The modified comprehensive analysis of how the membrane structure works was introduced together with the customized SPR bioanalyzer. In order to evaluate the performance of this biomembrane structure, the concentrations of CLB-contained solutions of 0 ng•mL-1, 10 ng•mL-1, 20 ng•mL-1, 33.3 ng•mL-1, and 40 ng•mL-1 were prepared by adding CLB reagents into the solutions of CLB antibody (Clenbuterol Hydrochloride Antibody, CLB-Ab), successively and then the response unit (RU) was measured individually. Using the data collected from the linear CCD array, the fitting curve was established with the R-Square value of 0.9929. Correspondingly, the recovery rate ranged from 88.48% to 103.21% was experimented and the limit of detection of CLB in 1.26 ng•mL-1 was obtained efficiently. It was concluded that the detection method associated with biomembrane properties is expected to contribute much to the determination of residual CLB in pork liver quantitatively by using the customized SPR bioanalyzer."
https://openalex.org/W1987611593,"Vital cellular processes, from cell growth to synaptic transmission, rely on membrane-bounded carriers and vesicles to transport molecular cargo to and from specific intracellular compartments throughout the cell. Compartment-specific proteins are required for the final step, membrane fission, which releases the transport carrier from the intracellular compartment. The role of fission proteins, especially at intracellular locations and in non-neuronal cells, while informed by the dynamin-1 paradigm, remains to be resolved. In this study, we introduce a highly sensitive approach for the identification and analysis of membrane fission machinery, called burst analysis spectroscopy (BAS). BAS is a single particle, free-solution approach, well suited for quantitative measurements of membrane dynamics. Here, we use BAS to analyze membrane fission induced by the potent, fission-active ENTH domain of epsin. Using this method, we obtained temperature-dependent, time-resolved measurements of liposome size and concentration changes, even at sub-micromolar concentration of the epsin ENTH domain. We also uncovered, at 37°C, fission activity for the full-length epsin protein, supporting the argument that the membrane-fission activity observed with the ENTH domain represents a native function of the full-length epsin protein."
https://openalex.org/W2001657674,"The formation of new genes is a primary driving force of evolution in all organisms. The de novo evolution of new genes from non-protein-coding genomic regions is emerging as an important additional mechanism for novel gene creation. Y chromosomes underlie sex determination in mammals and contain genes that are required for male-specific functions. In this study, a search was undertaken for Y chromosome de novo genes derived from non-protein-coding sequences. The Y chromosome orphan gene variable charge, Y-linked (VCY)2, is an autosome-derived gene that has sequence similarity to large autosomal fragments but lacks an autosomal protein-coding homolog. VCY2 locates in the amplicon containing long DNA fragments that were transposed from autosomes to the Y chromosome before the ape-monkey split. We confirmed that VCY2cannot be encoded by autosomes due to the presence of multiple disablers that disrupt the open reading frame, such as the absence of start or stop codons and the presence of premature stop codons. Similar observations have been made for homologs in the autosomes of the chimpanzee, gorilla, rhesus macaque, baboon and out-group marmoset, which suggests that there was a non-protein-coding ancestral VCY2 that was common to apes and monkeys that predated the transposition event. Furthermore, while protein-coding orthologs are absent, a putative non-protein-coding VCY2 with conserved disablers was identified in the rhesus macaque Y chromosome male-specific region. This finding implies that VCY2 might have not acquired its protein-coding ability before the ape-monkey split. VCY2 encodes a testis-specific expressed protein and is involved in the pathologic process of male infertility, and the acquisition of this gene might improve male fertility. This is the first evidence that de novo genes can be generated from transposed autosomal non-protein-coding segments, and this evidence provides novel insights into the evolutionary history of the Y chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2039670689,"Introduction Early nCPAP seems to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury in humans, although the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this beneficial effect have not been clarified yet. Objective To evaluate plasma levels IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α immediately before the start of nCPAP and 2 hours later in preterm infants. Methods Prospective cohort including preterm infants with 28 to 35 weeks gestational age with moderate respiratory distress requiring nCPAP. Extreme preemies, newborns with malformations, congenital infections, sepsis, surfactant treatment, and receiving ventilatory support in the delivery room were excluded. Blood samples were collected right before and 2 hours after the start of nCPAP. Results 23 preterm infants (birth weight 1851±403 grams; GA 32.3±1.7 weeks) were treated with nCPAP. IL-1β, IL-10, TNF-α levels were similar, IL-8 levels were reduced in 18/23 preterm infants and a significant decrease in IL-6 levels was observed after 2 hours of nCPAP. All newborns whose mothers received antenatal steroids had lower cytokine levels at the onset of nCPAP than those whose mothers didn’t receive it; this effect was not sustained after 2 hours of nCPAP. Conclusion Early use nCPAP is not associated with rising of plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines and it seems to be a less harmful respiratory strategy for preterm with moderate respiratory distress."
https://openalex.org/W2048081243,"Improving detection rates for elusive species with clumped distributions is often accomplished through adaptive sampling designs. This approach can be extended to include species with temporally variable detection probabilities. By concentrating survey effort in years when the focal species are most abundant or visible, overall detection rates can be improved. This requires either long-term monitoring at a few locations where the species are known to occur or models capable of predicting population trends using climatic and demographic data. For marbled salamanders (Ambystoma opacum) in Massachusetts, we demonstrate that annual variation in detection probability of larvae is regionally correlated. In our data, the difference in survey success between years was far more important than the difference among the three survey methods we employed: diurnal surveys, nocturnal surveys, and dipnet surveys. Based on these data, we simulate future surveys to locate unknown populations under a temporally adaptive sampling framework. In the simulations, when pond dynamics are correlated over the focal region, the temporally adaptive design improved mean survey success by as much as 26% over a non-adaptive sampling design. Employing a temporally adaptive strategy costs very little, is simple, and has the potential to substantially improve the efficient use of scarce conservation funds."
https://openalex.org/W2007052459,"Protein P7 is a component of the cystovirus viral polymerase complex. In the unpackaged procapsid, the protein is situated in close proximity to the viral directed RNA polymerase, P2. Cryo-electron microscopy difference maps from the species ϕ6 procapsid have demonstrated that P7 and P2 likely interact prior to viral RNA packaging. The location of P7 in the post-packaged nucleocapsid (NC) remains unknown. P7 may translocate closer to the five-fold axis of a filled procapsid but this has not been directly visualized. We propose that monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) can be selected that serve as probe- reagents for viral assembly and structure. A set of Mabs have been isolated that recognize and bind to the ϕ6 P7. The antibody set contains five unique Mabs, four of which recognize a linear epitope and one which recognizes a conformational epitope. The four unique Mabs that recognize a linear epitope display restricted utilization of Vκ and VH genes. The restricted genetic range among 4 of the 5 antibodies implies that the antibody repertoire is limited. The limitation could be the consequence of a paucity of exposed antigenic sites on the ϕ6 P7 surface. It is further demonstrated that within ϕ6 nucleocapsids that are primed for early-phase transcription, P7 is partially accessible to the Mabs, indicating that the nucleocapsid shell (protein P8) has undergone partial disassembly exposing the protein’s antigenic sites."
