https://openalex.org/W3167327839,"Spatial barcoding technologies have the potential to reveal histological details of transcriptomic profiles; however, they are currently limited by their low resolution. Here, we report Seq-Scope, a spatial barcoding technology with a resolution comparable to an optical microscope. Seq-Scope is based on a solid-phase amplification of randomly barcoded single-molecule oligonucleotides using an Illumina sequencing platform. The resulting clusters annotated with spatial coordinates are processed to expose RNA-capture moiety. These RNA-capturing barcoded clusters define the pixels of Seq-Scope that are ∼0.5-0.8 μm apart from each other. From tissue sections, Seq-Scope visualizes spatial transcriptome heterogeneity at multiple histological scales, including tissue zonation according to the portal-central (liver), crypt-surface (colon) and inflammation-fibrosis (injured liver) axes, cellular components including single-cell types and subtypes, and subcellular architectures of nucleus and cytoplasm. Seq-Scope is quick, straightforward, precise, and easy-to-implement and makes spatial single-cell analysis accessible to a wide group of biomedical researchers."

https://openalex.org/W3167791317,"Biomolecular condensation is a widespread mechanism of cellular compartmentalization. Because the ""survival of motor neuron protein"" (SMN) is implicated in the formation of three different membraneless organelles (MLOs), we hypothesized that SMN promotes condensation. Unexpectedly, we found that SMN's globular tudor domain was sufficient for dimerization-induced condensation in vivo, whereas its two intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) were not. Binding to dimethylarginine (DMA) modified protein ligands was required for condensate formation by the tudor domains in SMN and at least seven other fly and human proteins. Remarkably, asymmetric versus symmetric DMA determined whether two distinct nuclear MLOs-gems and Cajal bodies-were separate or ""docked"" to one another. This substructure depended on the presence of either asymmetric or symmetric DMA as visualized with sub-diffraction microscopy. Thus, DMA-tudor interaction modules-combinations of tudor domains bound to their DMA ligand(s)-represent versatile yet specific regulators of MLO assembly, composition, and morphology."
https://openalex.org/W3172510351,"Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) have co-evolved with their mammalian hosts for millions of years, leading to remarkable host specificity and high infection prevalence. Macrophages, which already populate barrier tissues in the embryo, are the predominant immune cells at potential CMV entry sites. Here we show that, upon CMV infection, macrophages undergo a morphological, immunophenotypic, and metabolic transformation process with features of stemness, altered migration, enhanced invasiveness, and provision of the cell cycle machinery for viral proliferation. This complex process depends on Wnt signaling and the transcription factor ZEB1. In pulmonary infection, mouse CMV primarily targets and reprograms alveolar macrophages, which alters lung physiology and facilitates primary CMV and secondary bacterial infection by attenuating the inflammatory response. Thus, CMV profoundly perturbs macrophage identity beyond established limits of plasticity and rewires specific differentiation processes, allowing viral spread and impairing innate tissue immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3172095392,"A species-specific composite pain scale is a prerequisite for adequate pain assessment. The aim of this study was to develop a multidimensional pain scale specific to rabbits ( Oryctolagus cuniculus ) called the Bristol Rabbit Pain Scale (BRPS). The scale was developed over five phases using a unique combination of methods: focus groups and behavioural observation. The first two phases aimed at identifying descriptors to describe a rabbit in pain, and then reducing their number, both using focus groups. A total of 72 pain descriptors were grouped under six categories (Demeanour, Posture, Facial expression, Attention to the painful area, Audible and Other) and ‘No pain’ descriptors were added. The third phase aimed to confirm, through video observation of rabbits, the categories and descriptors previously described, to reject those terms that were ambiguous, and identify any new descriptors that had not been included in the previous list of descriptors. This led to the rejection of the categories Audible and Attention to the painful area and of 34 descriptors. Seven new descriptors were identified. The last two phases constructed the final format of the BRPS by refining the categories, ranking the descriptors on an ordinal scale and testing the internal reliability of the scale using Cronbach’s alpha test. This led to a composite pain scale of six categories (Demeanour, Posture, Locomotion, Ears, Eyes and Grooming) with four intensities of pain (0, 1, 2, and 3), a total score of 0–18, and a high Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (alpha = 0.843). This BRPS fills an important gap in the field of rabbit medicine and has the potential to improve the assessment and management of pain in rabbits providing veterinary professionals with a novel multidimensional pain assessment tool. Further studies will investigate the clinical utility, validity and reliability of the BRPS."

The interaction between the gut microbiome and the disease manifestation remains unclear. The changing of tight junction proteins and cytokines expression throughout the gastrointestinal tract in IBS patients has not been studied yet.To assess the changes of gut microbiome composition, tight junction proteins, and cytokines expression of intestinal mucosa from the duodenum to the distal part of the colon in IBS patients and healthy volunteers.In 31 IBS patients (16 patients with IBS-D; 15 patients with IBS-C) and 10 healthy volunteers the expression of CLD-2, CLD-3, CLD-5, IL-2, IL-10, and TNF-α in mucosal biopsy specimens was determined by morphological and immune-histochemical methods. The qualitative and quantitative composition of the intestinal microbiota was assessed based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing in both groups of patients.The expression of IL-2 and TNF-α was significantly increased in IBS patients compared with the controls (p<0.001), with a gradual increase from the duodenum to the sigmoid colon. The expression of IL-10, CLD-3, and CLD-5 in mucosal biopsy specimens of these patients was lower than in the control group (p<0.001). Increased ratios of Bacteroidetes and decreased ratios of Firmicutes were noted in IBS patients compared to healthy volunteers (p<0.05).IBS patients have impaired gut permeability and persisting low-grade inflammation throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Changes in the gut microbiota may support or exacerbate these changes."
https://openalex.org/W3171152075,"Illicit drugs are known to affect central nervous system (CNS). Majorly psychostimulants such as cocaine, methamphetamine (METH) and opioids such as morphine are known to induce epigenetic changes of histone modifications and chromatin remodeling which are mediated by histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC). Aberrant changes in histone acetylation-deacetylation process further exacerbate dysregulation of gene expression and protein modification which has been linked with neuronal impairments including memory formation and synaptic plasticity. In CNS, astrocytes play a pivotal role in cellular homeostasis. However, the impact of psychostimulants and opioid mediated epigenetic changes of HAT/HADCs in astrocytes has not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, we have investigated the effects of the psychostimulants and opioid on the acetylation-regulating enzymes- HAT and HDACs role in astrocytes. In this study, Class I and II HDACs and HATs gene expression, protein changes and global level changes of acetylation of H3 histones at specific lysines were analyzed. In addition, we have explored the neuroprotective “nootropic” drug piracetam were exposed with or without psychostimulants and opioid in the human primary astrocytes. Results revealed that psychostimulants and opioid upregulated HDAC1, HDAC4 and p300 expression, while HDAC5 and GCN5 expression were downregulated. These effects were reversed by piracetam coexposure. Psychostimulants and opioid exposure upregulated global acetylation levels of all H3Ks, except H3K14. These results suggest that psychostimulants and opioids differentially influence HATs and HDACs."
https://openalex.org/W3172311067,"Studies of the outcome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia (Pab) have focused mainly on antibiotic appropriateness. However, P. aeruginosa possesses many virulence factors whose roles in outcomes have not been examined in humans, except for the type III secretion system (T3SS) toxins. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of virulence factors other than the T3SS toxins. Bacterial isolates were collected from 75 patients who suffered from Pa blood stream infections. Host factors such as neutropenia, immunosuppression, comorbidities, time to effective antibiotics, source of bacteremia, and presence of multidrug resistant (MDR) isolate were studied. The isolates were analyzed for the presence of toxin genes, proteolytic activity, swimming and twitching motility, and pyocyanin production. The data were analyzed to ascertain which virulence factors correlated with poor outcomes defined as septic shock or death (SS) within 7 days. Septic shock or death occurred in 25/75 patients. Univariate analysis identified age as a host factor that exerted a significant effect on these outcomes. Ineffective antibiotics administered during the first 24 hours of treatment or MDR P. aeruginosa did not influence the frequency of SS, nor did the presence of lasB, exoA, exoS exoU, plcH genes and proteolytic activity. However, 6/8 patients infected with non-motile isolates, developed SS, p = 0.014 and 5/6 isolates that produced large amounts of pyocyanin (>18ug/ml), were associated with SS, p = 0.014. Multivariate analysis indicated that the odds ratio (OR) for development of SS with a non-motile isolate was 6.8, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.37, 51.5), p = 0.030 and with high pyocyanin producing isolates, an OR of 16.9, 95% CI = (2.27, 360), p = .017. This study evaluating the role of microbial factors that significantly effect outcomes following Pa bloodstream infection suggests that P. aeruginosa strains showing high pyocyanin production and the lack of motility independently increase the risk of SS."
https://openalex.org/W3172044353,"Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) poses a serious threat to TB control. Early diagnosis and proper treatment are essential factors to limit the spread of the disease. The existing molecular tests for MDR-TB usually require specific instruments, steady power supply, and routine maintenance, which might be obstacles for low-resource settings. This study aimed to develop allele-specific isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (allele-specific RPA) to simultaneously detect the most common mutations in the rpoB gene at codons 516, 526, and 531, which are associated with rifampicin resistance, and in the katG gene at codon 315, which is related to isoniazid resistance. Allele-specific primers targeting four major mutations, rpoB516, rpoB526, rpoB531, and katG315, were constructed and used in individual RPA reactions. The RPA amplicons were endpoints detected by the naked eye immediately after applying SYBR Green I. The optimised RPA assay was evaluated with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis wild-type strain H37Rv and 141 clinical M. tuberculosis isolates. The results revealed that allele-specific RPA combined with SYBR Green I detection (AS-RPA/SYBR) detected these four major mutations with 100% sensitivity and specificity relative to DNA sequencing. The limits of detection for these particular mutations with AS-RPA/SYBR were 5 ng. As a result of the outstanding performance of AS-RPA/SYBR, including its easy setup, speed, lack of a specific instrument requirement, and lack of cross-reaction with other bacteria, this technique may be integrated for the molecular diagnosis of MDR-TB, especially in low-resource settings."
https://openalex.org/W3166065961,"Modern radiologic images comply with DICOM (digital imaging and communications in medicine) standard, which, upon conversion to other image format, would lose its image detail and information such as patient demographics or type of image modality that DICOM format carries. As there is a growing interest in using large amount of image data for research purpose and acquisition of large amount of medical image is now a standard practice in the clinical setting, efficient handling and storage of large amount of image data is important in both the clinical and research setting. In this study, four classes of images were created, namely, CT (computed tomography) of abdomen, CT of brain, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of brain and MRI of spine. After converting these images into JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) format, our proposed CNN architecture could automatically classify these 4 groups of medical images by both their image modality and anatomic location. We achieved excellent overall classification accuracy in both validation and test sets (> 99.5%), specificity and F1 score (> 99%) in each category of this dataset which contained both diseased and normal images. Our study has shown that using CNN for medical image classification is a promising methodology and could work on non-DICOM images, which could potentially save image processing time and storage space."
https://openalex.org/W3167280450,"In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) 90 percent of babies acquired HIV/AIDS from infected mothers. Maternal knowledge about mother to child transmission (MTCT) of HIV/AIDS and its prevention is a cornerstone for elimination of MTCT of HIV/AIDS. Despite this, there is limited evidence about knowledge about MTCT of HIV/AIDS and its prevention and associated factors in SSA. Therefore, this study aimed to assess knowledge of MTCT of HIV/AIDS, its prevention (PMTCT) and, associated factors among reproductive-age women in sub-Saharan Africa.To assess Knowledge about mother to child transmission of HIV/AIDS and its prevention and associated factors among reproductive-age women in Sub-Saharan Africa.The recent SSA countries' Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), which were conducted from 2008/09 to 2018/19, was our data source. We appended 33 countries' DHS data for our analysis. For our study, a total weighted sample of 350,888 reproductive-age women was used. Due to the hierarchical nature of the DHS data, we conducted a multilevel analysis. Finally, the adjusted odds ratio with its 95% confidence interval was reported, and variables with p-value≤0.05 were considered as significant predictors of knowledge of MTCT of HIV/AIDS and its prevention.In this study, 56.21% (95% CI: 56.05-56.38) of respondents had correct knowledge about MTCT of HIV/AIDS and its prevention among reproductive-age women in SSA. In the multilevel logistic regression analysis: being in the older age group, better education level, being from a rich household, having mass media exposure, having parity of one and above were associated with higher odds of knowledge about MTCT of HIV/AIDS and its prevention. However, being perceiving distance from the health facility as a big problem was associated with lower odds of knowledge about MTCT of HIV/AIDS and its prevention.Knowledge about MTCT of HIV/AIDS and its prevention among reproductive-age women in SSA was low. Therefore, it is better to consider the high-risk groups during the intervention to increase awareness about this essential public health issue and to tackle its devastating outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3169258223,"The arguable claims of levels of trust in politics and business situations motivated this study, which investigates the degree of trust within micro, small, and medium categories of Hungarian Information and Communication Technology (ICT) companies. Different sizes of companies have varying interactions between internal members and their business partners. This study concentrated on exploring Hungarian ICT companies due to their significant role in supporting Industry 4.0. The study population are active Hungarian ICT companies. This research implemented random cluster selection related to the location of ICT firms. It exploited 100 samples, including micro, small, and medium-sized companies, and implemented discriminant analysis to examine the description and hypotheses. First, this study found that the level of trust in institutions within micro, small, and medium-sized companies varies significantly. The level of trust in institutions proliferates within corporations due to the capability of the formal institution to provide fair public services. This research additionally underlined that the performance of the Hungarian government would improve trust amongst the companies. Second, this study concluded that the level of interpersonal trust within three categories of companies was similar. A high level of interpersonal trust would expand internal engagement among the members of companies. Finally, the level of trust in business partners varied significantly within the distinct sizes of Hungarian ICT companies. A high level of trust in corporate associates improves business collaboration, reduces uncertainty, and supports long-term business connections. Levels of institutional trust and inter-organizational trust differed amongst different categories of companies. However, the level of interpersonal trust remained similar within companies of the various sizes."
https://openalex.org/W3169407429,"On August 25 2017, an unprecedented influx of Rohingya refugees began from Rakhine State in Myanmar into Bangladesh’s district of Cox’s Bazar. The scale and acuteness of this humanitarian crisis was unprecedented and unique globally, requiring strong coordination of a multitude of actors. This paper reflects on the health sector coordination from August 2017 to October 2019, focusing on selected achievements and persisting challenges of the health sector strategic advisory group (HSSAG), and the health sector working groups including epidemiology and case management, sexual and reproductive health, community health, mental health and psychosocial support, and emergency preparedness. In the early days of the response, minimum service standards for primary health care were established, a fundamental initial step which enabled the standardization of services based on critical needs. Similarly, establishing standards for community health outreach was the backbone for capitalizing on this important health workforce. Novel approaches were adopted for infectious disease responses for acute watery diarrhoea and varicella, drawing on inter-sectoral collaborations. Sexual and reproductive health services were prioritized from the initial onset of the crisis and improvements in skilled delivery attendance, gender-based violence services, abortion care and family planning were recorded. Mental health service provision was strengthened through community-based approaches although integration of mental health programmes into primary health care has been limited by availability of specialist psychiatrists. Strong, collaborative and legitimate leadership by the health sector strategic advisory group, drawing on inter-sectoral collaborations and the technical expertise of the different technical working groups, were critical in the response and proved effective, despite the remaining challenges to be addressed. Anticipated reductions in funding as the crisis moves into protracted status threatens the achievements of the health sector in provision of health services to the Rohingya refugees."
https://openalex.org/W3170799867,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are increasingly used in cancer therapy. Elevated liver enzymes frequently occur in patients treated with ICI but evaluation is poorly described. We sought to better understand causes of liver enzyme elevation, investigation and management.Patients treated with anti-PD-1, PDL-1 or CTLA-4 therapy in Phase I/II clinical trials between August 2012 and December 2018 were included. Clinical records of patients with significant liver enzyme elevations were retrospectively reviewed.Of 470 ICI-treated patients, liver enzyme elevation occurred in 102 (21.6%), attributed to disease progression (56; 54.9%), other drugs/toxins (7; 6.9%), other causes (22; 21.6%) and ICI immunotoxicity (17; 16.7%; 3.6% of total cohort). Immunotoxicity was associated with higher peak ALT than other causes of enzyme elevation (N = 17; M = 217, 95% CI 145-324 for immunotoxicity, N = 103; M = 74, 95% CI 59-92 for other causes; ratio of means 0.34, 95% CI 0.19-0.60, p = <0.001) and higher ALT:AST ratio (M = 1.27, 95% CI 0.78-2.06 for immunotoxicity, M = 0.69, 95% CI 0.59-0.80 for other causes, ratio of means 0.54, 95% CI 0.36-0.82, p = 0.004). Immunotoxicity was more often seen in patients with prior CPI exposure (41.2% of immunotoxicity vs 15.9% of patients without, p = 0.01), anti-CTLA-4 -containing ICI treatments (29.4% of immunotoxicity vs 6.8% of patients without, p = <0.001) and other organ immunotoxicity (76.5% of immunotoxicity vs 19.2% of patients without, p = <0.001). Cause for enzyme elevation was established in most patients after non-invasive investigation. Liver biopsy was reserved for four patients with atypical treatment response.Liver enzyme elevation is common in patients receiving ICI, but often has a cause other than immunotoxicity. A biochemical signature with higher ALT and ALT/AST ratio, a history of prior ICI exposure and other organ immunotoxicities may help to identify patients at a higher likelihood of immunotoxicity. Liver biopsy can be safely deferred in most patients. We propose an approach to diagnostic evaluation in patients with liver enzyme elevations following ICI exposure."

The registry is an ongoing, retrospective, single-center hospital-based registry.The 30-day mortality rate and in-hospital mortality rate were 7.7% and 9.2%, respectively. Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality were ejection fraction (EF) < 40% [adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR), 4.446, p < 0.001], culprit lesions in the left coronary artery (LCA) (aOR, 2.940, p < 0.001) compared with those in the right coronary artery, Killip class > II (aOR, 7.438; p < 0.001), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (aOR, 4.056; p < 0.001), final thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grades 0/1/2 (aOR, 1.809; p = 0.03), absence of robust collaterals (aOR, 17.309; p = 0.01) and hypertension (aOR, 0.449; p = 0.01).Among the consecutive patients with STEMI, the in-hospital mortality rate after p-PCI significantly improved in the second half. Not only CKD, Killip class > II, and EF < 40%, but also the angiographic findings such as culprit lesions in the LCA, absence of very robust collaterals, and final TIMI grades <3 were associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3115689304,"The spatial diffusion of epidemic disease follows distance decay law in geography, but different diffusion processes may be modeled by different mathematical functions under different spatio-temporal conditions. This paper is devoted to modeling spatial diffusion patterns of COVID-19 stemming from Wuhan city to Hubei province. The methods include gravity and spatial auto-regression analyses. The local gravity model is derived from allometric scaling and global gravity model, and then the parameters of the local gravity model are estimated by observational data and linear regression. The main results are as below. The local gravity model based on power law decay can effectively describe the diffusion patterns and process of COVID-19 in Hubei Province, and the goodness of fit of the gravity model based on negative exponential decay to the observation data is not satisfactory. Further, the goodness of fit of the model to data entirely became better and better over time, the size elasticity coefficient increases first and then decreases, and the distance attenuation exponent decreases first and then increases. Moreover, the significance of spatial autoregressive coefficient in the model is low, and the confidence level is less than 80%. The conclusions can be reached as follows. (1) The spatial diffusion of COVID-19 of Hubei bears long range effect, and the size of a city and the distance of the city to Wuhan affect the total number of confirmed cases. (2) Wuhan direct transmission is the main process in the spatial diffusion of COVID-19 in Hubei at the early stage, and the horizontal transmission between regions is not significant. (3) The effect of spatial isolation measures taken by Chinese government against the transmission of COVID-19 is obvious. This study suggests that the role of gravity should be taken into account to prevent and control epidemic disease."
https://openalex.org/W3166962994,"Background Huntington’s disease (HD) is an inherited, progressive neurodegenerative disease that has no cure. Striatal atrophy and hypometabolism has been described in HD as far as 15 years before clinical onset and therefore structural and functional imaging biomarkers are the most applied biomarker modalities which call for these to be exact; however, most studies are not considering the partial volume effect and thereby tend to overestimate metabolic reductions, which may bias imaging outcome measures of interventions. Objective Evaluation of partial volume effects in a cohort of premanifest HD gene-expansion carriers (HDGECs). Methods 21 HDGECs and 17 controls had a hybrid 2-[ 18 F]FDG PET/MRI scan performed. Volume measurements and striatal metabolism, both corrected and uncorrected for partial volume effect were correlated to an estimate of disease burden, the CAG age product scaled (CAP S ). Results We found significantly reduced striatal metabolism in HDGECs, but not in striatal volume. There was a negative correlation between the CAP S and striatal metabolism, both corrected and uncorrected for the partial volume effect. The partial volume effect was largest in the smallest structures and increased the difference in metabolism between the HDGEC with high and low CAP S scores. Statistical parametric mapping confirmed the results. Conclusions A hybrid 2-[ 18 F]FDG PET/MRI scan provides simultaneous information on structure and metabolism. Using this approach for the first time on HDGECs, we highlight the importance of partial volume effect correction in order not to underestimate the standardized uptake value and thereby the risk of overestimating the metabolic effect on the striatal structures, which potentially could bias studies determining imaging outcome measures of interventions in HDGECs and probably also symptomatic HD."

However, the significance of CD155 expression in patients with triple-negative breast cancer, and the relationship between CD155 and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, have not yet been analyzed in detail.Using immunohistochemical staining and tissue microarrays, we analyzed the expression profiles of CD155 and PD-L1 in 61 patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Relapse-free survival and overall survival rates were compared according to CD155 expression. The correlation between CD155 expression and clinicopathological factors, including PD-L1 expression (using SP142 and 73-10 assays), was also examined.CD155 expression was noted in 25 patients (41.0%) in this cohort. CD155 expression did not correlate with pathological stage, histological grade, Ki-67 labeling index, or stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Only PD-L1 expression in tumor cells by SP142 assay significantly correlated with CD155 expression (p = 0.035); however, PD-L1 expression in tumor cells by 73-10 assay did not show a correlation (p = 0.115). Using the 73-10 assay, 59% of patients showed CD155 and/or PD-L1 expression in tumor cells. Moreover, using the SP142 assay, 63.3% of patients showed CD155 and/or PD-L1 expression in immune cells. CD155 expression did not correlate with either relapse-free survival or overall survival (p = 0.485 and 0.843, respectively).CD155 may be a novel target for antitumor immunotherapy. The results of this study indicate that CD155 may expand the pool of candidates with triple-negative breast cancer who could benefit from antitumor immunotherapy."

It has given much attention globally, following the concerns that healthcare often falls significantly; however, less research emphasis was paid in the last decade. Therefore, this study aims to assess compassionate and respectful care and associated factors among outpatient clients at public health facilities in Northwest Ethiopia, 2020.A facility-based quantitative cross-sectional study supplemented with the qualitative findings was conducted from 30 February to 30 March 2020. A semi-structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect the quantitative data among 593 participants. Systematic and purposive sampling techniques were used to select the quantitative and qualitative participants, respectively. A semi-structured interview guide was also employed for the qualitative data collection. Epi-Data version 4.6 and SPSS version 25 were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. The bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify the factors associated with each outcome variable (compassionate and respectful care separately). Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-value less than 0.05 were used to declare the strength and factors statistically associated with the outcome variables.Overall, 72.8% and 82.6% of the respondents experienced compassionate and respectful care, respectively. Patients attending primary or above education (AOR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.21-0.59), attending at the hospital (AOR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.39-0.88), new clients (AOR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.16-0.70) and service users who had three or more visits (AOR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.17-0.71) were negatively associated with compassionate care.

However, our result suggests that immediate actions are necessary to address respectful and compassionate care at hospitals, and hospital management should adopt mitigation measures. Consideration should be given to foster patient-centric services and educate the health care workers about compassionate and respectful care."

Setting This prospective study was conducted in a tertiary hospital in Abu Dhabi city, UAE, among COVID-19 confirmed patients. The virus-specific IgG were measured quantitatively in serum samples from the patients during three visits over a period of 6 months. Serum IgG levels ≥15 AU/ml was used to define a positive response. Participants 113 patients were analyzed at first visit, with a mean (SD) age of participants of 45.9 (11.8) years 87.5% of the patients were men. 63 and 27 participants had data available for visits 2 and 3, respectively. Primary outcome Change in SARS-CoV2 IgG antibody titers over the visits. Results No mortality or re-infection were reported. 69% of the patients developed positive IgG response within the first month after the onset of symptoms. The levels of IgG showed a consistent increase during the first three months with a peak level during the third month. Increasing trend in the levels of IgG were observed in 82.5%, 55.6% and 70.4% of patients between visit 1 to visit 2, visit 2 to visit 3, and from visit 1 to visit 3, respectively. Furthermore, about 64.3% of the patients showed sustained increase in IgG response for more than 120 days. Conclusions Our study indicates a sustained and prolonged positive immune response in COVID-19 recovered patients. The consistent rise in antibody and positive levels of IgG titers within the first 5 months suggest that immunization is possible, and the chances of reinfection minimal."

When 48 (out of 86) PCR positive samples were genotyped, two species were identified: C. parvum (n = 40) and C. hominis (n = 8). When 15 of the 40 C. parvum isolates were subtyped, zoonotic subtypes of IIaA14G1R1 (n = 1), IIaA15G2R1 (n = 1), IIaA16G1R1 (n = 2), IIaA16G3R1 (n = 2), IIaA17G1R1 (n = 1), IIaA19G1R1 (n = 1), IIaA20G1R1 (n = 3), IIaA22G1R1 (n = 1), IIaA22G2R1 (n = 1), IIdA23G1 (n = 1) and IIdA24G1 (n = 1) were identified. When 6 of the 8 C. hominis isolates were subtyped, subtypes IaA20 (n = 5), and IdA21(n = 1) were identified. This study suggests that C. parvum and C. hominis are causes of cryptosporidiosis in human in the Wurgissa district and Hawassa in Ethiopia. Zoonotic transmission might be the main route of transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3172799480,"The Ca2+-binding photoprotein aequorin is a complex of apoAequorin (apoprotein) and (S)-2-peroxycoelenterazine. Aequorin can be regenerated by the incubation of apoAequorin with coelenterazine and molecular oxygen (O2). In this study, to investigate the molecular recognition of apoAequorin for coelenterazine using chemical probes, the chiral deaza-analogs of (S)- and (R)-deaza-CTZ (daCTZ) for coelenterazine and of (S)-2- and (R)-2-hydroxymethyl-deaza-CTZ (HM-daCTZ) for 2-peroxycoelenterazine were efficiently prepared by the improvement method. The chiral deaza-analogs of (S)-daCTZ and (S)-HM-daCTZ selectively inhibited the regeneration step to aequorin by binding the catalytic site of coelenterazine in the apoAequorin molecule. The crystal structures of the apoAequorin complexes with (S)-daCTZ and (S)-HM-daCTZ were determined, suggesting that the hydroxy moiety at the C6-hydroxyphenyl group and the carbonyl moiety of the imidazopyrazinone ring in coelenterazine are essential to bind the apoAequorin molecule through hydrogen bonding. Therefore, the chiral deaza-analogs of coelenterazine can be used as a probe to study the interaction between coelenterazine and the related proteins including photoprotein, luciferase, and coelenterazine-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W3166499791,"Chemicals reactivating epigenetically silenced genes target diverse classes of enzymes, including DNMTs, HDACs, HMTs and BET protein family members. They can strongly influence the expression of genes and endogenous retroviral elements with concomitant dsRNA synthesis and massive transcription of LTRs. Chemicals reactivating gene expression may cause both beneficial effects in cancer cells and may be hazardous by promoting carcinogenesis. Among chemicals used in medicine and commerce, only a small fraction has been studied with respect to their influence on epigenetic silencing. Screening of chemicals reactivating silent genes requires adequate systems mimicking whole-genome processes. We used a HeLa TSA-inducible cell population (HeLa TI cells) obtained by retroviral infection of a GFP-containing vector followed by several rounds of cell sorting for screening purposes. Previously, the details of GFP epigenetic silencing in HeLa TI cells were thoroughly described. Herein, we show that the epigenetically repressed gene GFP is reactivated by 15 agents, including HDAC inhibitors-vorinostat, sodium butyrate, valproic acid, depsipeptide, pomiferin, and entinostat; DNMT inhibitors-decitabine, 5-azacytidine, RG108; HMT inhibitors-UNC0638, BIX01294, DZNep; a chromatin remodeler-curaxin CBL0137; and BET inhibitors-JQ-1 and JQ-35. We demonstrate that combinations of epigenetic modulators caused a significant increase in cell number with reactivated GFP compared to the individual effects of each agent. HeLa TI cells are competent to metabolize xenobiotics and possess constitutively expressed and inducible cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenases involved in xenobiotic biotransformation. Thus, HeLa TI cells may be used as an adequate test system for the extensive screening of chemicals, including those that must be metabolically activated. Studying the additional metabolic activation of xenobiotics, we surprisingly found that the rat liver S9 fraction, which has been widely used for xenobiotic activation in genotoxicity tests, reactivated epigenetically silenced genes. Applying the HeLa TI system, we show that N-nitrosodiphenylamine and N-nitrosodimethylamine reactivate epigenetically silenced genes, probably by affecting DNA methylation."
https://openalex.org/W3168531724,"Information on the genetic diversity, population structure, and trait associations of germplasm resources is crucial for predicting hybrid performance. The objective of this study was to dissect the genetic diversity and population structure of extra-early yellow and orange quality protein maize (QPM) inbred lines and identify secondary traits for indirect selection for enhanced grain yield under low-soil nitrogen (LN). One hundred and ten inbred lines were assessed under LN (30 kg ha -1) and assayed for tryptophan content. The lines were genotyped using 2500 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Majority (85.4%) of the inbred lines exhibited wide pairwise genetic distances between 0.4801 and 0.600. Genetic distances were wider between yellow and orange endosperm lines and predicted high heterosis in crosses between parents of different endosperm colors. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) and the admixture model-based population structure method both grouped the lines into five clusters. The clustering was based on endosperm color, pedigree, and selection history but not on LN tolerance or tryptophan content. Genotype by trait biplot analysis revealed association of grain yield with plant height and ear height. TZEEQI 394 and TZEEIORQ 73A had high expressivity for these traits. Indirect selection for high grain yield among the inbred lines could be achieved using plant and ear heights as selection criteria. The wide genetic variability observed in this study suggested that the inbred lines could be important sources of beneficial alleles for LN breeding programs in SSA."

The results show that there is a positive long-term balance between energy consumption and economic growth: economic growth of 1%, total energy consumption growth of 1.53%, which means that economic growth needs higher energy support in the former short term. At the same time, the error correction term will converge energy consumption to a long-term equilibrium state with an adjustment intensity of 134.59%. From the results of variance decomposition, we can also see that as the number of periods increases, the part of real economic growth explained by energy consumption gradually increases."
https://openalex.org/W3170067028,"Tropical forests represent vast carbon stocks and continue to be key carbon sinks and buffer climate changes. The international policy constructed several mechanisms aiming at conservation and sustainable use of these forests. Illegal logging is an important threat of forests, especially in the tropics. Several laws and regulations have been set up to combat illegal timber trade. Despite significant enforcement efforts of these regulations, illegal logging continues to be a serious problem and impacts for the functioning of the forest ecosystem and global biodiversity in the tropics. Microscopic analysis of wood samples and the use of conventional plant DNA barcodes often do not allow to distinguish closely-related species. The use of novel molecular technologies could make an important contribution for the identification of tree species. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools to obtain the complete de-novo chloroplast genome of 62 commercial African timber species using the genome skimming method. Then, we performed a comparative genomic analysis that revealed new candidate genetic regions for the discrimination of closely-related species. We concluded that genome skimming is a promising method for the development of plant genetic markers to combat illegal logging activities supporting CITES, FLEGT and the EU Timber Regulation."

In the safety population, mean (standard deviation) age was 73.1 (9.8) years and Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥75 years, Diabetes mellitus, previous Stroke/TIA (2 points) (CHADS2) score was 2.2 (1.3). Incidences (95% confidence intervals) of any and major bleeding were 3.77 (3.53-4.01) and 1.16 (1.03-1.29) events per 100 patient-years, respectively. Age ≥75 years, creatinine clearance <50 mL/min, diabetes mellitus, and vascular disease were independently associated with incidence of major bleeding. The primary composite effectiveness outcome of stroke, non-central nervous system systemic embolism, and myocardial infarction occurred at an incidence (95% confidence interval) of 1.32 (1.18-1.46) events per 100 patient-years. Age ≥75 years, hypertension, prior ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack, and concomitant use of antiplatelets were independently associated with incidence of the composite outcome of stroke, non-central nervous system systemic embolism, and myocardial infarction.In the XAPASS, a large-scale study involving a broad range of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation newly prescribed rivaroxaban using Japan-specific dosage in real-world clinical practice, no unexpected safety or effectiveness concerns were detected during up to 5 years of follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W3168606383,"The United States (US) has been at war for almost two decades, resulting in a high prevalence of injuries and illnesses in service members and veterans. Family members and friends are frequently becoming the caregivers of service members and veterans who require long-term assistance for their medical conditions. There is a significant body of research regarding the physical, emotional, and social toll of caregiving and the associated adverse health-related outcomes. Despite strong evidence of the emotional toll and associated mental health conditions in family caregivers, the literature regarding suicidal ideation among family caregivers is scarce and even less is known about suicidal ideation in military caregivers. This study sought to identify clusters of characteristics and health factors (phenotypes) associated with suicidal ideation in a sample of military caregivers using a cross-sectional, web-based survey. Measures included the context of caregiving, physical, emotional, social health, and health history of caregivers. Military caregivers in this sample (n = 458) were mostly young adults (M = 39.8, SD = 9.9), caring for complex medical conditions for five or more years. They reported high symptomology on measures of pain, depression, and stress. Many (39%) experienced interruptions in their education and 23.6% reported suicidal ideation since becoming a caregiver. General latent variable analyses revealed three distinct classes or phenotypes (low, medium, high) associated with suicidality. Individuals in the high suicidality phenotype were significantly more likely to have interrupted their education due to caregiving and live closer (within 25 miles) to a VA medical center. This study indicates that interruption of life events, loss of self, and caring for a veteran with mental health conditions/suicidality are significant predictors of suicidality in military caregivers. Future research should examine caregiver life experiences in more detail to determine the feasibility of developing effective interventions to mitigate suicide-related risk for military caregivers."
https://openalex.org/W3169438549,"Three months of weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid (3HP) is a short course regimen for latent tuberculosis infection treatment with satisfied safety and efficacy. However, research on its use in children is limited. In this study, we evaluated the completion rate and safety of the 3HP regimen among children in China. Participants aged 1-14 years receiving 3HP for TB prevention at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center were followed from December 2019 to November 2020 to evaluate the safety and completion rate of the treatment. Thirty-one children were eligible for inclusion, but five were excluded from the analysis (three were treated with a lower than recommended dose, and two were lost to follow-up). Of the 26 children included in the analysis, the treatment completion rate was 100%. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported in 38.5% (10/26) of the patients. The most common ADRs were gastrointestinal symptoms (19.2%,5/26), and all ADRs were rated as Grade 1. The 3HP regimen has a high completion rate, and it seems well tolerated in our study population. However, further randomized controlled clinical trial with larger sample size are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3173127736,"Current therapeutic approaches to avoid or reverse bronchoconstriction rely primarily on β2 adrenoceptor agonists (β-agonists) that regulate pharmacomechanical coupling/cross bridge cycling in airway smooth muscle (ASM). Targeting actin cytoskeleton polymerization in ASM represents an alternative means to regulate ASM contraction. Herein we report the cooperative effects of targeting these distinct pathways with β-agonists and inhibitors of the mammalian Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl1 or c-Abl). The cooperative effect of β-agonists (isoproterenol) and c-Abl inhibitors (GNF-5, or imatinib) on contractile agonist (methacholine, or histamine) -induced ASM contraction was assessed in cultured human ASM cells (using Fourier Transfer Traction Microscopy), in murine precision cut lung slices, and in vivo (flexiVent in mice). Regulation of intracellular signaling that regulates contraction (pMLC20, pMYPT1, pHSP20), and actin polymerization state (F:G actin ratio) were assessed in cultured primary human ASM cells. In each (cell, tissue, in vivo) model, c-Abl inhibitors and β-agonist exhibited additive effects in either preventing or reversing ASM contraction. Treatment of contracted ASM cells with c-Abl inhibitors and β-agonist cooperatively increased actin disassembly as evidenced by a significant reduction in the F:G actin ratio. Mechanistic studies indicated that the inhibition of pharmacomechanical coupling by β-agonists is near optimal and is not increased by c-Abl inhibitors, and the cooperative effect on ASM relaxation resides in further relaxation of ASM tension development caused by actin cytoskeleton depolymerization, which is regulated by both β-agonists and c-Abl inhibitors. Thus, targeting actin cytoskeleton polymerization represents an untapped therapeutic reserve for managing airway resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3167292314,"Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) of pathogenic bacteria is a promising technology in different applications. Thereby, a photosensitizer (PS) absorbs visible light and transfers the energy to oxygen yielding reactive oxygen species (ROS). The produced ROS are then capable of killing microorganisms via oxidative damage of cellular constituents. Among other PS, some flavins are capable of producing ROS and cationic flavins are already successfully applied in PDI. When PDI is used for example on tap water, PS like flavins will encounter various ions and other small organic molecules which might hamper the efficacy of PDI. Thus, the impact of carbonate and phosphate ions on PDI using two different cationic flavins (FLASH-02a, FLASH-06a) was investigated using Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as model organisms. Both were inactivated in vitro at a low light exposure of 0.72 J cm - 2 . Upon irradiation, FLASH-02a reacts to single substances in the presence of carbonate or phosphate, whereas the photochemical reaction for FLASH-06a was more unspecific. DPBF-assays indicated that carbonate and phosphate ions decreased the generation of singlet oxygen of both flavins. Both microorganisms could be easily inactivated by at least one PS with up to 6 log 10 steps of cell counts in low ion concentrations. Using the constant radiation exposure of 0.72 J cm -2 , the inactivation efficacy decreased somewhat at medium ion concentrations but reached almost zero for high ion concentrations. Depending on the application of PDI, the presence of carbonate and phosphate ions is unavoidable. Only upon light irradiation such ions may attack the PS molecule and reduce the efficacy of PDI. Our results indicate concentrations for carbonate and phosphate, in which PDI can still lead to efficient reduction of bacterial cells when using flavin based PS."
https://openalex.org/W3168422525,"Given clinicians' frequent concerns about unfavourable outcomes, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) triage decisions in acutely ill cancer patients can be difficult, as clinicians may have doubts about the appropriateness of an ICU admission. To aid to this decision making, we studied the survival and performance status of cancer patients 2 years following an unplanned ICU admission.This was a retrospective cohort study in a large tertiary referral university hospital in the Netherlands. We categorized all adult patients with an unplanned ICU admission in 2017 into two groups: patients with or without an active malignancy. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's Chi-square tests and the Mann-Whitney U tests were used to evaluate the primary objective 2-year mortality and performance status. A good performance status was defined as ECOG performance status 0 (fully active) or 1 (restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out light work). A multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with 2-year mortality within cancer patients.Of the 1046 unplanned ICU admissions, 125 (12%) patients had cancer. The 2-year mortality in patients with cancer was significantly higher than in patients without cancer (72% and 42.5%, P <0.001). The median performance status at 2 years in cancer patients was 1 (IQR 0-2). Only an ECOG performance status of 2 (OR 8.94; 95% CI 1.21-65.89) was independently associated with 2-year mortality.In our study, the majority of the survivors have a good performance status 2 years after ICU admission. However, at that point, three-quarter of these cancer patients had died, and mortality in cancer patients was significantly higher than in patients without cancer. ICU admission decisions in acutely ill cancer patients should be based on performance status, severity of illness and long-term prognosis, and this should be communicated in the shared decision making. An ICU admission decision should not solely be based on the presence of a malignancy."

Early recurrence was defined as newly diagnosed breast cancer and/or axillary metastasis within 12 months of surgery. Late recurrence was defined as recurrence after 12months of surgery. We assessed the detectability of recurrent lesions in each postoperative imaging modality and evaluated characteristics of recurrent lesions on postoperative MRI by comparing early and late recurrence groups.Of the 2026 cases, 103 were confirmed as recurrent breast cancer by biopsy or surgery. Thirty-one cases were early recurrence, and 72 cases were late recurrence. MRI showed significantly higher detectability for recurrent lesions (102 cases, 99%) than mammography (59.4%, p < 0.001) or ultrasound (68.9%, p < 0.001), or both mammography and ultrasound (81.6%, p < 0.001). The recurrent lesions did not have typical malignant morphologic features, but variable features on MRI. However, early recurrent lesions showed fast enhancement in early dynamic phase regardless of the kinetic pattern of delayed dynamic phase; and late recurrence lesions showed early fast enhancement and delayed washout pattern. There were 19 cases which were not detected on mammography or ultrasound but could only be detected with MRI.Postoperative breast MRI showed significantly higher detectability for recurrent lesions than mammography and ultrasound. Early fast enhancement is the most important feature of recurrent lesions on postoperative breast MRI for both early and late recurrence groups. Due to its high possibility of recurrence, further work-up should be considered regardless of their morphologic features."

Although the shape changes associated with variation in average water velocity and ontogeny are well documented, few studies have tested for the interaction between these two variables (i.e., does ontogenetic shape variation differ between velocity environments). We use geometric morphometrics to characterize shape differences in Trichomycterus areolatus, a freshwater catfish found in high and low-velocity environments in Chile. We identify a significant interaction between velocity environment and body size (i.e., ontogeny). Ontogenetic patterns of shape change are consistent with other studies, but velocity environment differentially affects the ontogenetic trajectory of shape development in T. areolatus. Shape change over ontogeny appears more constrained in high-velocity environments compared to low-velocity environments."

The socio-cultural context in sub-Saharan Africa presents some difficulty for the attainment of preferred fertility for many women. Few studies in sub-Saharan Africa have examined the extent to which women are unable to achieve their preferred family sizes. This study, therefore, examines the factors that are associated with the non-attainment of women's preferred fertility by the end of their reproductive years.The study analyzed pooled cross-sectional data with a sub-sample of 1,888 currently married women aged 45-49 years from five rounds of the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, 1993 to 2014. Test of associations and multinomial logistic regression analysis were used to examine the predictors of underachieved and overachieved fertility relative to achieved fertility.The results indicate that 44 per cent of the women recorded overachieved fertility while about 36 per cent underachieved their fertility. Partner wants more, experiencing child loss and married more than once were significantly associated with overachieved fertility. Nonetheless, increased years of a woman's education and delaying her at first birth were negatively associated with overachieved fertility. On the other hand, underachieved fertility was significantly associated with having a partner with fewer fertility preference, being of the Islamic faith and ever use of modern contraception.Partner's fertility preference, child loss experience, marrying more than once and ever use of modern contraception were important predictors of a woman's inability to achieve her fertility preference. Policies to regulate men's fertility behaviour, delaying age at first birth, use of modern contraception, encouraging longer years of education, and reducing infant and child mortality are important strategies to achieve fertility preference in Ghana."

Eligibility criteria included an age older than 20 years, a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. The diagnosis of OSA was defined as an oxygen desaturation index of at least 5, was established with the use of polysomnographic examination at hospital. Patients were excluded from the study if they had head injury, brain tumour, headache history and hearing loss. Patients who had vertigo were labeled as Vertigo group. In the other hand, patients who had no dizziness were labeled as control group. 58 patients were in the Vertigo group, and 113 were in the control group.After PSG examination, 58 patients who had vertigo, were diagnosed OSA (29 males, average age = 57.07 years old, BMI = 26.64, RDI = 24.69, ESS = 8.65), and 24 patients of them (41.3%) were REM-related OSA. Meanwhile, in the control group, 113 patients had OSA (92male, average age = 49.66 years old, BMI = 26.06, RDI = 35.19, ESS = 11.43), and 18 patients of them (15.9%) were REM-related OSA (Table 1). Therefore, patient who had vertigo, would have higher proportion of REM OSA (P<0.001).The vertigo patients have a higher rate of REM-related OSA, and the acceptance rate to CPAP use is low. Further research is needed to explore novel therapeutic approaches, or combination of currently available non-CPAP therapies, in patients with REM OSA."
https://openalex.org/W3172203059,"Three infant regulatory behavior patterns have been identified during the Face-to-Face Still-Face paradigm (FFSF) in prior research samples: a Social-Positive Oriented pattern (i . e ., infants exhibit predominantly positive social engagement), a Distressed-Inconsolable pattern (i . e ., infants display conspicuous negative affect that persists or increases across FFSF episodes), and a Self-Comfort Oriented pattern (e.g., infants primarily engage in self-comforting behaviors such as thumb-sucking). However, few studies have examined these patterns outside US and European countries or evaluated potential cross-country differences in these patterns. In this study, we compared the regulatory behavior patterns of 74 Brazilian and 124 Portuguese infants in the FFSF at 3 months of age, and evaluated their links to demographic and birth variables. The prevalence of the three regulatory patterns varied by country. The most frequent pattern in the Portuguese sample was the Social-Positive Oriented, followed by the Distressed-Inconsolable and the Self-Comfort Oriented. However, in the Brazilian sample, the Distressed-Inconsolable pattern was the most prevalent, followed by the Social-Positive Oriented and the Self-Comfort Oriented. Moreover, in the Brazilian sample, familial SES was higher among infants with a Social-Positive pattern whereas 1 st -minute Apgar scores were lower among Portuguese infants with a Distressed-Inconsolable Oriented pattern of regulatory behavior. In each sample, Social Positive pattern of regulatory behavior was associated with maternal sensitivity, Self-Comfort Oriented pattern of regulatory behavior with maternal control, and Distressed-Inconsolable pattern with maternal unresponsivity."
https://openalex.org/W3172627932,"To acquire the words of their language, learners face the challenge of tracking regularities at multiple levels of abstraction from continuous speech. In the current study, we examined adults' ability to track two types of regularities from a continuous artificial speech stream: the individual words in the speech stream (token level information), and a phonotactic pattern shared by a subset of those words (type level information). We additionally manipulated exposure time to the language to examine the relationship between the acquisition of these two regularities. Using a ratings test procedure, we found that adults can extract both the words in the language and their phonotactic patterns from continuous speech in as little as 3.5 minutes of listening time. Results from a 2AFC testing method provide converging evidence that adults rapidly learn both words and their phonotactic patterns. Together, the findings suggest that adults are capable of concurrently tracking regularities at multiple levels of abstraction from brief exposures to a continuous stream of speech."

Based on 597 observations along with soil profiles of 0-20cm depth in the 1980s and the 2010s, the temporal and spatial variations of soil C, N contents and C:N stoichiometry in the major grain-producing region of the North China Plain were illustrated. Results showed that there were significant changes in soil C, N contents over time, with increasing rates of 60.47% and 50%, respectively. The changes of C, N contents resulting in a general improvement of C:N stoichiometry. There was a significant decline in nugget effects of soil C, N contents from the 1980s to 2010s, the spatial autocorrelation of soil nutrients showed an increasing trend, and the effect of random variation was reduced. C:N stoichiometry was higher in Huixian City and Weihui City, and lower in Yanjin County, an apparent decline was observed in the spatial difference of soil C:N stoichiometry from the 1980s to 2010s. Soil C, N contents and C:N stoichiometry differed among soil types, agricultural land-use types, and topography in space. The temperature, precipitation, and fertilization structure were considered as the main factors that induce the temporal variations. These findings indicated that the soil nutrient elements in the farmland ecosystems changed in varying degrees in both time and space scales, and the variation was influenced by soil types, land-use types, topography, meteorological factors, and fertilization structure."

To study abnormal lung mechanics isolated from heterogeneities of obstructive disease, we measured pulmonary function in healthy adults with expiratory loading. Thirty-seven volunteers (25±5 yr) completed spirometry and body plethysmography under control and threshold expiratory loading of 7, 11 cmH2O, and a subset at 20 cmH2O (n = 11). We analyzed the shape of the flow-volume relationship with rectangular area ratio (RAR; Ma et al., Respir Med 2010). Airway resistance was increased (p<0.0001) with 7 and 11 cmH2O loading vs control (9.20±1.02 and 11.76±1.68 vs. 2.53± 0.80 cmH2O/L/s). RAR was reduced (p = 0.0319) in loading vs control (0.45±0.07 and 0.47±0.09L vs. 0.48±0.08). FEV1 was reduced (p<0.0001) in loading vs control (3.24±0.81 and 3.23±0.80 vs. 4.04±1.05 L). FVC was reduced (p<0.0001) in loading vs control (4.11±1.01 and 4.14±1.03 vs. 5.03±1.34 L). Peak expiratory flow (PEF) was reduced (p<0.0001) in loading vs control (6.03±1.67 and 6.02±1.84 vs. 8.50±2.81 L/s). FEV1/FVC (p<0.0068) was not clinically significant and FRC (p = 0.4) was not different in loading vs control. Supra-physiologic loading at 20 cmH2O did not result in further limitation. Expiratory loading reduced FEV1, FVC, PEF, but there were no clinically meaningful differences in FEV1/FVC, FRC, or RAR. Imposed expiratory loading likely leads to high airway pressures that resist dynamic airway compression. Thus, a concave expiratory flow-volume relationship was consistently absent-a key limitation for model comparison with pulmonary function in COPD. Threshold loading may be a useful strategy to increase work of breathing or induce dynamic hyperinflation."

All patients had at least one cardiovascular risk factor in addition to diabetes (overweight, hypertension, insufficient nocturnal BP fall, dyslipidemia, or renal dysfunction) and 86% had ≥ 3 risk factors.DME patients are characterized by highly prevalent cardiovascular risk factors that are poorly controlled. These comorbidities reduce the prognosis and negatively influence existing DR and DME. The data reveal an important opportunity for improving patient care by interaction of the ophthalmologist with the general practitioner and internal specialists for the detection and treatment of these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3169254937,"Pancreatic islet-cell tumors (PICT) often present with atypical signal-characteristics and are often missed on preoperative imaging. The aim of this study is to provide a multiparametric PICT characterization and investigate factors impeding PICT detection.This is a detailed MRI analysis of a prospective, monocenter study, including 49 consecutive patients (37 female, 12 male; median age 50) with symptoms due to endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (EHH) and mostly negative prior-imaging. All patients received a 3-T MRI and a 68Ga-DOTA-exendin-4-PET/CT. Pooled accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and inter-reader agreement were calculated. Reference-standard was histopathology and 68Ga-DOTA-Exendin-4-PET/CT in one patient who refused surgery. For PICT analyses, 34 patients with 49 PICTs (48 histologically proven; one 68Ga-DOTA-exendin-4-PET/CT positive) were assessed. Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) with Golden-Angle-Radial-Sparse-Parallel (GRASP) reconstruction, enabling imaging at high spatial and temporal resolution, was used to assess enhancement-patterns of PICTs. Tumor-to-background (T2B) ratio for each sequence and the employed quantitative threshold for conspicuity of PICTs were analyzed in regard to prediction of true-positive PICTs.Evaluation of 49 patients revealed a pooled lesion-based accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 70.3%, 72.9% and 62.5%, respectively. Mean PICT size was 12.9±5.3mm for detected, 9.0±2.9mm for undetected PICTs (p-value 0.0112). In-phase T1w detected the most PICT (67.3%). Depending on the sequence, PICTs were isointense and poorly visible in 29-68%. Only 2/41(4.9%) PICTs showed typical signal-characteristics across T1w, T2w, DWI and ceT1w combined. 66.6% of PICTs enhanced simultaneously to the parenchyma, 17.8% early and 15.6% late. Predictor screening analysis showed number of sequences detecting a PICT, lesion size and in-phase T1w T2B ratio had the highest contribution for detecting a true-positive PICT.The majority of PICTs enhance simultaneously to surrounding parenchyma, present with atypical signal-characteristics and thus are poorly visible. In non-enhancing PICTs, radiologists should search for small lesions most likely conspicuous on unenhanced T1w or DWI."
https://openalex.org/W3169665144,"Voluntary medical male circumcision is a crucial HIV prevention program for men in sub-Saharan Africa. Kenya is one of the first countries to achieve high population coverage and seek to transition the program to a more sustainable structure designed to maintain coverage while making all aspects of service provision domestically owned and implemented. Using pre-defined metrics, we created and evaluated three models of circumcision service delivery (static, mobile and mixed) to identify which had potential for sustaining high circumcision coverage among 10-14-year-olds group, a historically high-demand and accessible age group, at the lowest possible cost. We implemented each model in two distinct geographic areas, one in Siaya and the other in Migori county, and assessed multiple aspects of each model’s sustainability. These included numerical achievements against targets designed to reach 80% coverage over two years; quantitative expenditure outcomes including unit expenditure plus its primary drivers; and qualitative community perception of program quality and sustainability based on Likert scale. Outcome values at baseline were compared with those for year one of model implementation using bivariate linear regression, unpaired t-tests and Wilcoxon rank tests as appropriate. Across models, numerical target achievement ranged from 45–140%, with the mixed models performing best in both counties. Unit expenditures varied from approximately $57 in both countries at baseline to $44-$124 in year 1, with the lowest values in the mixed and static models. Mean key informant perception scores generally rose significantly from baseline to year 1, with a notable drop in the area of community engagement. Consistently low scores were in the aspects of domestic financing for service provision. Sustainability-focused circumcision service delivery models can successfully achieve target volumes at lower unit expenditures than existing models, but strategies for domestic financing remain a crucial challenge to address for long-term maintenance of the program."
https://openalex.org/W3168370392,"Object control skills are one of the most important abilities in daily life. Knowledge of object manipulation is an essential factor in improving object control skills. Although males and females equally try to use object manipulation knowledge, their object control abilities often differ. To explain this difference, we investigated how structural brain networks in males and females are differentially organized in the tool-preferring areas of the object manipulation network. The structural connectivity between the primary motor and premotor regions and between the inferior parietal regions in males was significantly higher than that in females. However, females showed greater structural connectivity in various regions of the object manipulation network, including the paracentral lobule, inferior parietal regions, superior parietal cortices, MT+ complex and neighboring visual areas, and dorsal stream visual cortex. The global node strength found in the female parietal network was significantly higher than that in males but not for the entire object manipulation, ventral temporal, and motor networks. These findings indicated that the parietal network in females has greater inter-regional structural connectivity to retrieve manipulation knowledge than that in males. This study suggests that differential structural networks in males and females might influence object manipulation knowledge retrieval."
https://openalex.org/W3169523992,"With the increasing incidence of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), PTC continues to garner attention worldwide; however its pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. The purpose of this study was to explore key biomarkers and potential new therapeutic targets for, PTC.GEO2R and Venn online software were used for screening of differentially expressed genes. Hub genes were screened via STRING and Cytoscape, followed by Gene Ontology and KEGG enrichment analysis. Finally, survival analysis and expression validation were performed using the UALCAN online software and immunohistochemistry.We identified 334 consistently differentially expressed genes (DEGs) comprising 136 upregulated and 198 downregulated genes. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis results suggested that the DEGs were mainly enriched in cancer-related pathways and functions. PPI network visualization was performed and 17 upregulated and 13 downregulated DEGs were selected. Finally, the expression verification and overall survival analysis conducted using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis Tool (GEPIA) and UALCAN showed that LPAR5, TFPI, and ENTPD1 were associated with the development of PTC and the prognosis of PTC patients, and the expression of LPAR5, TFPI and ENTPD1 was verified using a tissue chip.In summary, the hub genes and pathways identified in the present study not only provide information for the development of new biomarkers for PTC but will also be useful for elucidation of the pathogenesis of PTC."
https://openalex.org/W3172692211,"Health care workers (HCWs) are at an increased risk of acquiring tuberculosis (TB) compared to the general population, because of the frequent face to face contact or potential exposure to TB through shared air or space with infectious patient(s), regardless of economic setting and local TB incidence. Information on the burden of active TB disease among HCWs will help guide control measures, can be utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of TB infection prevention programs in the health care setting, and guide necessary actions. However, data on TB among HCW in Ethiopia is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of active TB disease among healthcare workers and support staff in healthcare settings in the Amhara region of Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study design was used to recruit a total of 580 randomly selected study participants in the Amhara region. Data were collected over four months in selected hospitals and health centers. Implementation of TB prevention and control measures was evaluated using a standardized checklist. The main outcome indicator was active TB as measured by a laboratory diagnosis using GeneXpert technology.A total of 580 study participants were enrolled. The mean age was 31.3 (±7.8 standard deviation) years, with about two-thirds (65.3%) aged between 18-24 years. A total of 9 (1.6%) MTB cases were detected, 4 (1.4%) in HCWs and 5 (1.7%) in support staff, which did not significantly differ (P = 0.50). About 90% of the participants had not received TB infection prevention and control training ever. More than half (54%) of the study participants worked in poorly ventilated rooms. Triage of coughing patients was not practiced in 32% of the studied facilities (health centers and hospitals).The magnitude of TB among healthcare workers and support staff in healthcare settings was higher than in the general population (140 per 100000 population). The status of implementation of tuberculosis prevention and control measures indicated missed opportunities. Hence, strict implementation of developed infection control plans of TB in healthcare settings needs to be improved."
https://openalex.org/W3173041439,"Meningitis is a medical emergency with permanent disabilities and high mortality worldwide. We aimed to determine causative microorganisms and potential markers for differentiation between bacterial and viral meningitis.Adult patients with acute meningitis were subjected to lumber puncture. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) microorganisms were identified using Real-time PCR. PCT and CRP levels, peripheral and CSF-leucocyte count, CSF-protein and CSF-glucose levels were assessed.Out of 80 patients, infectious meningitis was confirmed in 75 cases; 38 cases were bacterial meningitis, 34 cases were viral meningitis and three cases were mixed infection. Higher PCT, peripheral and CSF-leukocytosis, higher CSF-protein and lower CSF-glucose levels were more significant in bacterial than viral meningitis patients. Neisseria meningitides was the most frequent bacteria and varicella-zoster virus was the most common virus. Using ROC analyses, serum PCT and CSF-parameters can discriminate bacterial from viral meningitis. Combined ROC analyses of PCT and CSF-protein significantly improved the effectiveness in predicting bacterial meningitis (AUC of 0.998, 100%sensitivity and 97.1%specificity) than each parameter alone (AUC of 0.951 for PCT and 0.996 for CSF-protein).CSF-protein and serum PCT are considered as potential markers for differentiating bacterial from viral meningitis and their combination improved their predictive accuracy to bacterial meningitis."
https://openalex.org/W3169246885,"Theanine (L-glutamylethylamide) contained in green tea is a functional food component that has been attracting attention due to its relaxation effect. It was shown that the ingredients added to the theanine formulations increased the absorption of theanine. If this mechanism can be elucidated, it would be possible to contribute to development of evidence-based formulations. In this study, we investigated the effect of ingredients in the formulations on the absorption of theanine in detail.After oral administration of a mixture of theanine and additional components to Wistar rats the plasma concentration was determined by an HPLC and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. In addition, a new system for evaluating intestinal blood flow was developed since the involvement of intestinal blood flow was considered as a factor that increased absorption of theanine.Plasma concentration of theanine increased significantly in the combined use group with eight ingredients containing piperine as compared with theanine only group. Piperine would increase theanine absorption by increased blood flow, not an inhibition of metabolism. We succeeded to develop a visual and quantitative system to evaluate the effect of these ingredients directly including piperine on the intestinal blood flow using indocyanine green while maintaining physiological conditions.Increased intestinal blood flow by these ingredients including piperine enhanced the absorption of theanine. Other mechanisms may also be considered as the mechanism by which theanine absorption is increased in addition to increased blood flow."
https://openalex.org/W3172046226,"In this study, we investigated serum epidermal growth factor (EGF) in an oncological population of head- and neck and pulmonary neoplasms and whether serum EGF could serve as a prognostic marker of survival and as a predictive marker for treatment response to platinum-based chemotherapy. A total of 59 oncological patients and a control group of age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were included in this study. Pre-treatment serum EGF from both groups was determined. Patient's and tumour characteristics and mortality were recorded during a 5-year follow up period. Baseline serum EGF significantly differed between the oncological patients and the healthy volunteers (p<0.001). Serum EGF was associated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.004) but not with sex (p = 0.753), age (p = 1.00), TNM stage (p = 0.191) or tumour size (p = 0.077). Neither serum EGF (p = 0.81) nor age (p = 0.55) showed an effect on the patient's survival. Tumour location was significantly associated with overall 5-year survival (p = 0.003). The predictive capacity of serum EGF of response to chemotherapy was limited (AUC = 0.606), a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 56% was observed resulting in a likelihood ratio of a positive and negative test equal to 1.81 and 0.36, respectively. In conclusion, serum EGF levels are 5.5 times higher in an oncological population compared to a control group. Within the oncological population, low serum EGF values are associated with the presence of lymph node metastasis. Further investigation is necessary to determine if the serum EGF levels could serve as a diagnostic biomarker."
