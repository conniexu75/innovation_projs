https://openalex.org/W2007429249,"N6-methyl-adenosine (m(6)A) is the most abundant modification on messenger RNAs and is linked to human diseases, but its functions in mammalian development are poorly understood. Here we reveal the evolutionary conservation and function of m(6)A by mapping the m(6)A methylome in mouse and human embryonic stem cells. Thousands of messenger and long noncoding RNAs show conserved m(6)A modification, including transcripts encoding core pluripotency transcription factors. m(6)A is enriched over 3' untranslated regions at defined sequence motifs and marks unstable transcripts, including transcripts turned over upon differentiation. Genetic inactivation or depletion of mouse and human Mettl3, one of the m(6)A methylases, led to m(6)A erasure on select target genes, prolonged Nanog expression upon differentiation, and impaired ESC exit from self-renewal toward differentiation into several lineages in vitro and in vivo. Thus, m(6)A is a mark of transcriptome flexibility required for stem cells to differentiate to specific lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2062605351,"Dendritic structure critically determines the electrical properties of neurons and, thereby, defines the fundamental process of input-to-output conversion. The diversity of dendritic architectures enables neurons to fulfill their specialized circuit functions during cognitive processes. It is known that this dendritic integrity is impaired in patients with Alzheimer's disease and in relevant mouse models. It is unknown, however, whether this structural degeneration translates into aberrant neuronal function. Here we use in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, high-resolution STED imaging, and computational modeling of CA1 pyramidal neurons in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease to show that structural degeneration and neuronal hyperexcitability are crucially linked. Our results demonstrate that a structure-dependent amplification of synaptic input to action potential output conversion might constitute a novel cellular pathomechanism underlying network dysfunction with potential relevance for other neurodegenerative diseases with abnormal changes of dendritic morphology."
https://openalex.org/W1966782946,"In recent years, some substantial advances in understanding human (and nonhuman) brain organization have emerged from a relatively unusual approach: the observation of spontaneous activity, and correlated patterns in spontaneous activity, in the ""resting"" brain. Most commonly, spontaneous neural activity is measured indirectly via fMRI signal in subjects who are lying quietly in the scanner, the so-called ""resting state."" This Primer introduces the fMRI-based study of spontaneous brain activity, some of the methodological issues active in the field, and some ways in which resting-state fMRI has been used to delineate aspects of area-level and supra-areal brain organization."
https://openalex.org/W2133512499,"Maintaining accurate beliefs in a changing environment requires dynamically adapting the rate at which one learns from new experiences. Beliefs should be stable in the face of noisy data but malleable in periods of change or uncertainty. Here we used computational modeling, psychophysics, and fMRI to show that adaptive learning is not a unitary phenomenon in the brain. Rather, it can be decomposed into three computationally and neuroanatomically distinct factors that were evident in human subjects performing a spatial-prediction task: (1) surprise-driven belief updating, related to BOLD activity in visual cortex; (2) uncertainty-driven belief updating, related to anterior prefrontal and parietal activity; and (3) reward-driven belief updating, a context-inappropriate behavioral tendency related to activity in ventral striatum. These distinct factors converged in a core system governing adaptive learning. This system, which included dorsomedial frontal cortex, responded to all three factors and predicted belief updating both across trials and across individuals."

We have developed a molecular-specific approach for the simultaneous imaging and quantitation of multiple neurotransmitters, precursors, and metabolites, such as tyrosine, tryptamine, tyramine, phenethylamine, dopamine, 3-methoxytyramine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine, and L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine, in histological tissue sections at high spatial resolutions. The method is employed to directly measure changes in the absolute and relative levels of neurotransmitters in specific brain structures in animal disease models and in response to drug treatments, demonstrating the power of mass spectrometry imaging in neuroscience."

Despite compelling laboratory experiments and ongoing FDA pilot clinical trials, system performance, robustness, and generalization remain challenges. We provide a perspective on how two complementary lines of investigation, that have focused on decoder design and neural adaptation largely separately, could be brought together to advance BMIs. This BMI paradigm should also yield new scientific insights into the function and dysfunction of the nervous system."

Somatosensory integration and transduction in the spinal cord and the trigeminal brainstem are subject to monoaminergic modulation. As an integral part of an animal’s adaptive response to an ever-changing environment, facilitatory and inhibitory modulation of somatosensory neural circuits is crucial for the maintenance of homeostasis. Monoaminergic modulation of neural circuits serves an important role in regulating behavioral responses to somatosensory inputs. One notable example is that an array of monoamine neuromodulators produced by supraspinal regions is important for the modulation of nociceptive transmission (Basbaum and Fields, 1984Basbaum A.I.

Given the fundamental role of central modulation in sensory transduction, one can presume that itch sensation is similarly modulated at several levels. Imaging studies in human subjects indicated that pain-mediated inhibition of itch is associated with an activity level of the midbrain regions such as periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), an area known for pain modulation (Mochizuki et al., 2003Mochizuki H.

Experiments in humans also indicated that noxious counterirritants reduce itch sensation (Murray and Weaver, 1975Murray F.S. Weaver M.M.

Interruption of the upper cervical spinal cord of rodents attenuated dry skin-induced itch, suggesting an involvement of the descending spinal pathway in itch responses (Akiyama et al., 2011Akiyama T.

Transmitters and pathways mediating inhibition of spinal itch-signaling neurons by scratching and other counterstimuli.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e22665Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), or seven trans-membrane proteins, constitute a large repertoire of cellular sensors required for transducing sensory signals from the skin to the brain (Jeffry et al., 2011Jeffry J.

GRPR is expressed in laminae I–II of spinal cord neurons and has an important role in the transmission of pruritogenic information (Liu et al., 2011Liu X.Y. Liu Z.C. Sun Y.G. Ross M. Kim S. Tsai F.F.

Conversely, loss of GRPR or GRP markedly reduces chronic itch (Lagerström et al., 2010Lagerström M.C. Rogoz K. Abrahamsen B. Persson E. Reinius B. Nordenankar K. Olund C. Smith C. Mendez J.A.

Despite these studies, molecular mechanisms by which the function of GRPR is modulated remain elusive. Serotonergic neurons reside principally in the brainstem raphe nuclei and modulate a myriad of behavioral and physiological functions through descending and ascending pathways (Barnes and Sharp, 1999Barnes N.M.

Serotonergic neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), including nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) and surrounding reticular formation, project to both the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (SpVc) and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and modulate nociceptive transmission in a bidirectional fashion (Basbaum and Fields, 1984Basbaum A.I.

In contrast to numerous studies of serotonergic modulation of pain, little is known about the involvement of central 5-HT and receptor mechanisms in itch modulation. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that 5-HT signaling has a pivotal role in itch modulation. To evaluate the involvement of the central serotonergic system in modulation of itch transmission, we first examined the scratching behavior of Lmx1bf/f/p mice to intradermal injection (i.d.) of chloroquine (CQ), a representative nonhistaminergic pruritogen that acts, in part, via a Mas-related GPCR (MrgprA3) in sensory neurons and GRPR in the spinal cord (Liu et al., 2009Liu Q.

Chen Z.F. A gastrin-releasing peptide receptor mediates the itch sensation in the spinal cord.Nature. 2007; 448: 700-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). LMX1B is a LIM homeodomain-containing transcription factor that is required for the development of all central 5-HT neurons (Ding et al., 2003Ding Y.Q. Marklund U. Yuan W. Yin J. Wegman L. Ericson J. Deneris E. Johnson R.L. Chen Z.F. Lmx1b is essential for the development of serotonergic neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We previously generated conditional Lmx1bf/f/p mice in which Lmx1b is conditionally ablated in Pet1-expressing serotonergic neurons in the raphe nuclei. As a result, all central 5-HT neurons of Lmx1bf/f/p mice were ablated due to lack of Lmx1b (Zhao et al., 2006Zhao Z.Q. Scott M. Chiechio S. Wang J.S. Renner K.J. Gereau 4th, R.W. Johnson R.L. Deneris E.S. Chen Z.F. Lmx1b is required for maintenance of central serotonergic neurons and mice lacking central serotonergic system exhibit normal locomotor activity.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12781-12788Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, these mice survive and exhibit normal motor function and thus represent a unique genetic model for investigating the role of central 5-HT neurons in diverse physiological functions (Zhao et al., 2007aZhao Z.Q. Chiechio S. Sun Y.G. Zhang K.H. Zhao C.S. Scott M. Johnson R.L. Deneris E.S. Renner K.J. Gereau 4th, R.W. Chen Z.F.

USA. 2007; 104: 14519-14524Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Compared with wild-type (WT) mice, CQ-evoked scratching responses were significantly reduced in Lmx1bf/f/p mice (Figure 1A), demonstrating that central 5-HT neurons exert a constitutive tone for positively modulating itch transmission. To determine whether the decrease was specifically due to a loss of 5-HT or whether other factors originating in central 5-HT neurons were involved, we generated mice lacking tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2), which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme for 5-HT synthesis in the brain (Walther et al., 2003Walther D.J. Peter J.U. Bashammakh S. Hörtnagl H. Voits M. Fink H. Bader M. Synthesis of serotonin by a second tryptophan hydroxylase isoform.Science. 2003; 299: 76Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar) using gene targeting strategy (Figure 1B). Tph2−/− mice showed no expression of Tph2 and 5-HT in the central nervous system but maintained normal presumptive 5-HT neurons (Figure 1B) (Kim et al., 2014Kim J.Y. Kim A. Zhao Z.Q. Liu X.Y.

Unidirectional cross-activation of GRPR by MOR1D uncouples itch and analgesia induced by opioids.Cell. 2011; 147: 447-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Tph2−/− mice displayed a significant reduction in scratching response after i.d. injection of CQ in nape models (Figure 1C), recapitulating the phenotype of Lmx1bf/f/p mice. Since 5-HT signaling in the brain and the spinal cord may contribute differentially to the modulation of itch sensation, next we asked whether impaired itch sensation observed in Lmx1bf/f/p mice and Tph2−/− mice may be ascribed to a blockage of the descending 5-HT pathway. We selectively degenerated spinal 5-HT+ terminals in the spinal cord by an intrathecal injection (i.t.) of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) following pretreatment with desipramine to prevent the transport of 5,7-DHT into noradrenergic and dopaminergic terminals (Björklund et al., 1975Björklund A. Baumgarten H.G. Rensch A. 5,7-Dihydroxytryptamine: improvement of its selectivity for serotonin neurons in the CNS by pretreatment with desipramine.J. Neurochem. 1975; 24: 833-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). At 2 weeks after 5,7-DHT injection, when spinal 5-HT+ fibers were depleted (Figure S1A, available online), mice exhibited an attenuated scratching response to CQ (Figure 1D), mimicking the phenotype of Lmx1bf/f/p mice and Tph2−/− mice. These loss-of-function studies confirm the contribution of descending 5-HT signaling to the modulation of itch sensation. To complement the loss-of-function approaches, we next determined whether we could rescue the attenuated itch transmission of Tph2−/− mice and Lmx1bf/f/p mice using an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of the 5-HT precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), to boost 5-HT tone. Exogenous 5-HTP can be decarboxylated to 5-HT by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), thereby bypassing the need for TPH2 for 5-HT synthesis (Figure 1B) (Birdsall, 1998Birdsall T.C. 5-Hydroxytryptophan: a clinically-effective serotonin precursor.Altern. Med. Rev. 1998; 3: 271-280PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, immunohistochemical staining (IHC) revealed abundant 5-HT staining in the spinal cord of Tph2−/− mice after 5-HTP injection (Figure 1E, top panel). In contrast, Lmx1bf/f/p mice treated with 5-HTP failed to produce 5-HT in the brain (Figure 1E, lower row). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis also revealed a significant increase in 5-HT concentrations and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), in the brain and spinal cord of Tph2−/− and wild-type mice treated with 5-HTP (Figures S1B–S1E). These studies demonstrate a successful conversion of 5-HT from 5-HTP in the absence of TPH2 and that 5-HT synthesis is critically dependent on 5-HT neurons that express AADC. We next examined scratching responses of Tph2−/− mice after 5-HTP injection and found that 5-HTP injection indeed restored normal scratching responses of Tph2−/− mice to CQ (Figure 1F). However, the same treatment failed to enhance CQ-elicited scratching in Lmx1bf/f/p mice (Figure 1G). This finding complements the results from the 5,7-DHT lesion study suggesting that 5-HT is important in the facilitation of CQ-induced itch and supports the notion that AADC in 5-HT neurons is required for catalyzing the conversion of 5-HTP into 5-HT. These results also demonstrate that peripheral 5-HT is not involved in modulation of itch transmission. Consistently, WT mice treated with 5-HTP showed a dramatic increase of CQ-elicited scratching (Figure 1H). Since CQ-elicited itch is dependent on GRP-GRPR signaling (Sun and Chen, 2007Sun Y.G. Chen Z.F. A gastrin-releasing peptide receptor mediates the itch sensation in the spinal cord.Nature. 2007; 448: 700-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), we reasoned that 5-HT might synergistically act with GRP to enhance the function of GRPR. We tested this possibility by examining the GRP-induced scratching (GIS) with an intracisternal injection in mice treated with 5-HTP. Indeed, GIS was markedly potentiated by 5-HTP (Figure 1I), revealing a positive correlation between the activity of GRPR and central 5-HT tone. Importantly, 5-HTP injection did not affect the scratching response induced by CQ in Grpr KO mice (Figure 1J). Taken together, we conclude that spinal 5-HT signaling facilitates itch transmission through GRPR. To identify the 5-HT receptor subtype that mediates the facilitating effect of descending 5-HT on itch transmission, we carried out pharmacological and behavioral screening by injecting a variety of 5-HT receptor agonists and GRP into the spinal cord of WT mice. GRP at 0.01 nmol was used because this dose was insufficient to elicit scratching behavior greater than vehicle (Figure 2A). The use of a minimal concentration of GRP serves to enhance the sensitivity of screening for identifying 5-HT receptor agonists that may potentiate GRP action. Of all the agonists tested for the 5-HT receptor subtypes, only R-(+)-8-OH-DPAT (DPAT), a 5-HT1A agonist, showed a robust facilitating effect on GIS (Figure 2A), and the effect of DPAT is dose dependent (Figure 2B). Notably, i.t. DPAT alone failed to induce scratch behavior (Figure 2A). Although DPAT is also a partial agonist for 5-HT7 receptor, it is unlikely that 5-HT7 is involved since AS-19, an agonist for 5-HT7, did not enhance GIS significantly (Figure 2A). Furthermore, agonists for other 5-HT receptor subtypes failed to increase GIS (Figure 2A). We next employed WAY100635 (WAY), a highly specific 5-HT1A antagonist, to verify whether the robust scratching response elicited by DPAT/GRP is mediated by 5-HT1A. Pretreatment of mice with WAY (10 μg, i.t.) for 5 min nearly abolished scratching behavior evoked by DPAT/GRP coinjection (Figure 2C). Importantly, DPAT failed to enhance scratching behavior in Htr1a−/− mice and Grpr KO mice (Figure 2D). These data demonstrate that activation of spinal 5-HT1A is required for the facilitation of GRPR function in itch transmission. Since an elevated 5-HT level facilitates itch elicited by CQ, it is likely that 5-HT1A activation may facilitate CQ-elicited itch as well. Indeed, CQ-induced scratching behavior was greatly enhanced by i.t. DPAT (Figure 2E), mimicking the effect of 5-HTP (Figure 1H). Conversely, preinjection of WAY markedly attenuated CQ-induced scratching behavior (Figure 2F). Furthermore, CQ-induced scratching behavior was significantly attenuated after spinal siRNA knockdown of Htr1a (Figure 2G), which was functionally confirmed by reduced facilitatory effect of DPAT on GIS (Figure 2H). These results suggest that activation of spinal 5-HT1A is important for mediating descending 5-HT signaling to facilitate the function of GRPR in pruriceptive transmission. 5-HT terminals mainly originated from the NRM are densely distributed in the superficial part (laminae I and IIo) of the dorsal spinal cord and SpVc of the brainstem (Li et al., 1997Li J.L. Kaneko T. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Distribution of trigeminohypothalamic and spinohypothalamic tract neurons displaying substance P receptor-like immunoreactivity in the rat.J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 378: 508-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To examine whether 5-HT+ terminals make connections with GRPR+ neurons in the dorsal spinal cord, we performed double immunohistochemistry IHC for 5-HT and eGFP in GRPR-eGFP mice. Indeed, numerous 5-HT+ fibers and GRPR+ neurons were detected in the superficial laminae of the dorsal spinal cord, and 5-HT+ fibers overlap with all GRPR+ neurons (Figures 3A–3F). Synaptic connections between 5-HT+ terminals and GRPR+ neurons were further examined by electron microscopy using a double-immunolabeling method (Li et al., 1997Li J.L. Kaneko T. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Distribution of trigeminohypothalamic and spinohypothalamic tract neurons displaying substance P receptor-like immunoreactivity in the rat.J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 378: 508-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) for 5-HT and eGFP. In the lumbar cord, both 5-HT+ terminals identified by the nanogold-silver enhancement and eGFP (GRPR)+ neurons revealed by the immunoperoxidase products were observed to distribute in the same pattern as found by our double IHC (Figures 3A–3F). 5-HT+ terminals form synapses with GRPR+ dendritic profiles (Figures 3G and 3H). Of the synaptic types characterized (Uchizono, 1965Uchizono K. Characteristics of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the central nervous system of the cat.Nature. 1965; 207: 642-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), 85.5% (71/83) were symmetric synapses (Figure 3G), while 14.5% (12/83) were asymmetric ones (Figure 3H). Therefore, serotoninergic descending terminals predominantly make symmetrical synapses with GRPR+ neurons in the dorsal spinal cord. One prerequisite for 5-HT1A and GRPR crosstalk is the coexpression of two partner receptors in the same neurons (Pin et al., 2007Pin J.P. Neubig R. Bouvier M. Devi L. Filizola M. Javitch J.A. Lohse M.J. Milligan G. Palczewski K. Parmentier M. Spedding M. International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology. LXVII. Recommendations for the recognition and nomenclature of G protein-coupled receptor heteromultimers.Pharmacol. Rev. 2007; 59: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The expression of 5-HT1A is heavily concentrated in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (Zhang et al., 2002Zhang Y.Q. Gao X. Ji G.C. Huang Y.L. Wu G.C. Zhao Z.Q. Expression of 5-HT1A receptor mRNA in rat lumbar spinal dorsal horn neurons after peripheral inflammation.Pain. 2002; 98: 287-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To examine whether 5-HT1A is also expressed in GRPR+ neurons, we performed double IHC of 5-HT1A and GFP in the spinal cord of GRPR-eGFP mice using anti-GFP antibody and anti-5-HT1A antibody (Figure S2). 5-HT1A is broadly expressed in the dorsal horn (Figures 3I–3N). Double IHC revealed that the overwhelming majority (91%) of GFP-expressing cells in the dorsal spinal cord were costained with 5-HT1A (Figure 3N). Moreover, we examined the coexpression of Htr1a and Grpr in GRPR-eGFP neurons using single-cell RT-PCR (Figure S3B) and found Htr1a mRNA signals in 78% (7/9) of eGFP+ neurons (Table S1). Furthermore, all eGFP+ neurons expressed Grpr mRNA (Table S1), validating the usage of eGFP as a marker for GRPR expression in GRPR-eGFP mice. GRPR mediates itch sensation through the PLCβ/IP3 pathway and intracellular Ca2+ release (Liu et al., 2011Liu X.Y. Liu Z.C. Sun Y.G. Ross M. Kim S. Tsai F.F. Li Q.F. Jeffry J. Kim J.Y. Loh H.H.

https://openalex.org/W2016873833,"In the vertebrate retina, glutamate is traditionally thought to be released only by photoreceptors and bipolar cells to transmit visual signals radially along parallel ON and OFF channels. Lateral interactions in the inner retina are mediated by amacrine cells, which are thought to be inhibitory neurons. Here, we report calcium-dependent glutamate release from vGluT3-expressing amacrine cells (GACs) in the mouse retina. GACs provide an excitatory glutamatergic input to ON-OFF and ON direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) and a subpopulation of W3 ganglion cells, but not to starburst amacrine cells. GACs receive excitatory inputs from both ON and OFF channels, generate ON-OFF light responses with a medium-center, wide-surround receptive field structure, and directly regulate ganglion cell activity. The results reveal a functional glutamatergic circuit that mediates noncanonical excitatory interactions in the retina and probably plays a role in generating ON-OFF responses, crossover excitation, and lateral excitation."

Thus, neural precursors are transcriptionally primed to generate neurons, but an eIF4E/4E-T complex sequesters and represses translation of proneurogenic proteins to determine appropriate neurogenesis. Developmental genesis of the correct numbers and types of mammalian neurons involves a tightly regulated interplay between mechanisms intrinsic to neural precursors and the environment that surrounds them. These interactions ensure that neurons are generated appropriately and that neural precursors are not prematurely exhausted, since the same precursor pool also generates astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and adult neural stem cells. When this process is disrupted, as in some neurodevelopmental disorders, it causes aberrant neural circuit formation and cognitive dysfunction (Gauthier et al., 2007Gauthier A.S. Furstoss O. Araki T.

For example, sustained expression of proneurogenic basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors like the neurogenins is necessary for mammalian cortical precursors to make neurons (Bertrand et al., 2002Bertrand N.

Intriguingly, recent data suggest that translational regulation is also important. For example, the RNA-binding protein Staufen2 asymmetrically localizes mRNAs in cortical radial glial precursors, thereby promoting maintenance of the stem cell state (Vessey et al., 2012Vessey J.P. Amadei G. Burns S.E. Kiebler M.A. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D.

As a second example, the translational regulator eIF4E1 has been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in humans (Neves-Pereira et al., 2009Neves-Pereira M. Müller B. Massie D. Williams J.H. O’Brien P.C. Hughes A. Shen S.B. Clair D.S. Miedzybrodzka Z. Deregulation of EIF4E: a novel mechanism for autism.J. Med. Genet. 2009; 46: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and increasing neural eIF4E function caused aberrant circuitry and ASD-like behavior in mice (Santini et al., 2013Santini E. Huynh T.N. MacAskill A.F. Carter A.G. Pierre P. Ruggero D. Kaphzan H. Klann E.

Dallaire P. et al.Autism-related deficits via dysregulated eIF4E-dependent translational control.Nature. 2013; 493: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). How might eIF4E-dependent translational regulation determine neurogenesis? Mammalian cells express three eIF4E family members (eIF4E1–eIF4E3) that can both initiate and suppress translation in response to extracellular signals (Rhoads, 2009Rhoads R.E. eIF4E: new family members, new binding partners, new roles.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16711-16715Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). eIF4E1, the best studied eIF4E, initiates translation by binding the 5′ cap of mRNA and the scaffolding protein eIF4G (Jackson et al., 2010Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Pestova T.V. The mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation and principles of its regulation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). eIF4E1 can be sequestered from eIF4G and positive initiation complexes by eIF4E binding proteins 1–3 (Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009Sonenberg N. Hinnebusch A.G. Regulation of translation initiation in eukaryotes: mechanisms and biological targets.Cell. 2009; 136: 731-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). eIF4E is also present in multiprotein complexes that repress translation such as the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)/CYFIP1 complex that suppresses FMRP target mRNAs at synapses (Napoli et al., 2008Napoli I. Mercaldo V. Boyl P.P. Eleuteri B. Zalfa F. De Rubeis S. Di Marino D. Mohr E. Massimi M. Falconi M. et al.The fragile X syndrome protein represses activity-dependent translation through CYFIP1, a new 4E-BP.Cell. 2008; 134: 1042-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). eIF4E1 also binds a protein called 4E-T that associates with granules that silence translation called processing bodies, or P-bodies (Ferraiuolo et al., 2005Ferraiuolo M.A. Basak S. Dostie J. Murray E.L. Schoenberg D.R. Sonenberg N. A role for the eIF4E-binding protein 4E-T in P-body formation and mRNA decay.J.

P bodies: at the crossroads of post-transcriptional pathways.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Thus, eIF4E proteins, depending on the complexes they form, can either initiate translation or specifically suppress the translation of subsets of mRNAs. Here, we have asked whether translational regulation is important for genesis of neurons in the embryonic cortex. We identify an eIF4E1/4E-T complex that is present in P-body-like granules in neural precursors and that coordinately represses translation of proneurogenic proteins to maintain the stem cell state while, at the same time, allowing neurogenesis. These findings suggest that neural precursors are transcriptionally primed to generate neurons, and an eIF4E1/4E-T complex sequesters and represses translation of mRNAs encoding proneurogenic proteins to ultimately determine appropriate neurogenesis. To ask about eIF4E during cortical development, we analyzed its expression. RT-PCR and western blots showed that eIF4E1 was expressed in the E11/12 cortex (Figures 1A and 1B ). Immunostaining of E14.5 cortical sections showed robust eIF4E1 expression in ventricular and subventricular zones (VZ/SVZ) (Figure 1C), where it localized to punctate cytoplasmic granules in radial precursors expressing Pax6 (Figures 1C and 1D). eIF4E1 was also detectable in neurons of the cortical plate (CP) but was lower in the intermediate zone (IZ), which contains UNC5D-positive migrating newborn neurons (Figure 1C). Immunostaining of E12.5 precursors cultured for 3 days confirmed that eIF4E1 was localized to punctate foci in Sox2- and Ki67-positive proliferating precursors and in βIII-tubulin-positive neurons (Figure 1E). We asked about eIF4E1 function with two small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that knocked down expression of a FLAG-tagged murine eIF4E1 when cotransfected into human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells (Figure 1F). We cotransfected cultured precursors with these shRNAs and a nuclear EGFP expression plasmid. Three days later, eIF4E1 immunoreactivity was significantly reduced in cells transfected with eIF4E1 but not control shRNA (Figures 1G and 1H). eIF4E1 knockdown had no effect on cell survival, as indicated by EGFP-positive cells with condensed apoptotic nuclei (control shRNA, 10.1% ± 0.6%; eIF4E shRNA1, 11.4% ± 0.5%; eIF4E shRNA2, 14.2% ± 1.1%). It did, however, decrease EGFP-positive, Pax6-positive radial precursors (Figures 1I and 1J), although the precursor proliferation index was unaffected, as monitored by double labeling for Sox2 and Ki67 (Figures 1I and 1K). In contrast, EGFP-positive βIII-tubulin neurons were increased by eIF4E1 knockdown (Figures 1I and 1L). Since almost all EGFP-positive cells expressed either Pax6 or βIII-tubulin (92%–100% in all conditions; Figures 1J and 1L), then this indicates that eIF4E1 knockdown depletes radial precursors by promoting their differentiation to neurons. Further support for this conclusion came from clonal analysis performed using the piggybac (PB) transposon to stably express EGFP in cultured precursors (Tsui et al., 2013Tsui D. Vessey J.P. Tomita H. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. FoxP2 regulates neurogenesis during embryonic cortical development.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 244-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, Zander et al., 2014Zander M.A. Burns S.E. Yang G. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Snail coordinately regulates downstream pathways to control multiple aspects of mammalian neural precursor development.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 5164-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). E12.5 cortical precursors were cotransfected at low efficiency (at most, 1% to 3%) with control or eIF4E1 shRNAs plus plasmids encoding PB transposase and the PB EGFP reporter. Immunostaining 3 days later showed that clone size, indicative of self-renewal, was significantly smaller following eIF4E1 knockdown (Figures 1M and 1N). To ask if eIF4E1 regulates neurogenesis in vivo, we electroporated E13/14 cortices in utero with a nuclear EGFP expression plasmid and eIF4E1 shRNA2, thereby transfecting radial precursors that generate neurons in the VZ/SVZ that subsequently migrate through the IZ to the CP (Gauthier et al., 2007Gauthier A.S. Furstoss O. Araki T. Chan R. Neel B.G. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Control of CNS cell-fate decisions by SHP-2 and its dysregulation in Noonan syndrome.Neuron. 2007; 54: 245-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Immunostaining 3 days later showed that eIF4E1 knockdown perturbed the location of EGFP-positive cells, with fewer in the VZ/SVZ and CP and more in the IZ (Figures 2A and 2B ). eIF4E1 knockdown also robustly decreased EGFP-positive, Pax6-positive radial precursors and Ki67-positive proliferating precursors, although, as seen in culture, the radial precursor proliferation index (Ki67-positive, Pax6-positive, EGFP-positive/Pax6-positive, EGFP-positive cells) was unaffected (Figures 2C–2G; Figures S1A and S1B available online). To ask if neurons were coincidentally increased, we analyzed the cortical neuron markers Satb2, Ctip2, and Tbr1 (Figure 2H; Figures S1C–S1H). As we previously reported (Tsui et al., 2013Tsui D. Vessey J.P. Tomita H. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. FoxP2 regulates neurogenesis during embryonic cortical development.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 244-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), almost all EGFP-positive neurons generated over this time frame expressed Satb2, and very few expressed Ctip2 or Tbr1 (Figures 2H and 2I). eIF4E1 knockdown did not affect Ctip2- or Tbr1-positive neurons, but it significantly increased those expressing Satb2 (Figures 2H and 2I) or βIII-tubulin (Figure 2K). The magnitude of the neuronal increase was similar to that of the radial precursor decrease (22% versus 19% of total EGFP-positive cells, respectively). In addition, almost all EGFP-positive neurons were mislocalized to the IZ following eIF4E1 knockdown (Figure 2J; Figure S1C). To ensure the specificity of these phenotypes, we performed rescue experiments with an shRNA-resistant wild-type murine eIF4E1. We also performed rescue experiments with eIF4E1 proteins that were mutated to prevent binding to mRNA (W56A mutant) or to protein partners that mediate translational activation or suppression (W73A mutant) (Ferraiuolo et al., 2005Ferraiuolo M.A. Basak S. Dostie J. Murray E.L. Schoenberg D.R. Sonenberg N. A role for the eIF4E-binding protein 4E-T in P-body formation and mRNA decay.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We confirmed that these proteins were expressed equally well (Figure 2L) and electroporated them with eIF4E1 shRNA into the E13/14 cortex. Analysis 3 days later showed that wild-type eIF4E1, but not the two mutant eIF4E1s (which were also shRNA resistant), rescued the aberrant location of EGFP-positive cells caused by eIF4E1 knockdown (Figure 2M; Figure S1I). Wild-type, but not mutant, eIF4E1s also rescued EGFP-positive, Pax6-positive, and Ki67-positive proliferating precursors and Satb2-positive neurons to control levels (Figures 2N–2P). These experiments validate the eIF4E1 knockdown phenotype and show that eIF4E1 must form a complex with a protein partner and bind to mRNAs to inhibit neurogenesis. These data indicate a critical role for eIF4E1 but do not distinguish its roles in translational activation versus repression. To do this, we examined eIF4G, a necessary eIF4E partner for translation initiation (Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009Sonenberg N. Hinnebusch A.G. Regulation of translation initiation in eukaryotes: mechanisms and biological targets.Cell. 2009; 136: 731-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). Immunostaining showed that eIF4G was localized to punctate cytoplasmic foci in radial precursors of the E14.5 cortical VZ/SVZ (Figures 3A and 3B ). To ask about its functional role, we used murine eIF4G1 shRNAs that were validated in HEK293 cells (Figure 3C). We electroporated E13/14 cortices with the most efficacious of these (eIF4G1 shRNA1) and analyzed sections 3 days later. eIF4G1 knockdown increased EGFP-positive, Pax6-positive radial precursors in the VZ/SVZ (Figures 3D–3F; Figure S2). However, the proliferation index of these radial precursors was reduced (Figure 3G). In addition, EGFP-positive, Satb2-positive neurons were decreased (Figure 3H). Thus, eIF4G1 knockdown decreased the proliferation and differentiation of radial precursors, a phenotype that is different from that seen following eIF4E1 knockdown. These findings suggest that the enhanced neurogenesis seen following eIF4E1 knockdown might be due to derepression of translation of proneurogenic mRNAs. If so, then coincident eIF4G knockdown might inhibit this aberrant proneurogenic translation and rescue the eIF4E knockdown phenotype. To test this idea, we coelectroporated E13/14 cortices with shRNAs for both eIF4E1 and eIF4G1. Analysis 3 days later showed that coincident eIF4G1 knockdown normalized the aberrant distribution of EGFP-positive cells seen with eIF4E1 knockdown (Figures 3I and 3J) and rescued EGFP-positive, Pax6-positive precursors and Satb2-positive neurons to control levels (Figures 3K and 3L). The data obtained with the W73A eIF4E1 protein binding mutant (Figures 2M–2P) suggest that eIF4E1 binds to a protein partner to repress neurogenesis and maintain radial precursors. We asked whether this was 4E-T since it binds to the eIF4E1 W73 site (Ferraiuolo et al., 2005Ferraiuolo M.A. Basak S. Dostie J. Murray E.L. Schoenberg D.R. Sonenberg N.

Human 4E-T represses translation of bound mRNAs and enhances microRNA-mediated silencing.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 3298-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Western blots showed expression of 4E-T in the E12 cortex (Figure 4A), and immunostaining showed that it was expressed in the same cells as eIF4E1 in the E15.5 VZ/SVZ (Figure 4B). To ask whether 4E-T was bound to eIF4E1 in the embryonic cortex, we used two approaches. First, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments, after confirming that the 4E-T antibody immunoprecipitated 4E-T from the embryonic cortex (Figure S3A). Immunoprecipitation of E12.5 cortical lysates with anti-4E-T followed by western blotting showed that eIF4E1 was present in the 4E-T immunoprecipitates (Figure 4C). Second, we double-labeled E14.5 cortical sections with antibodies for 4E-T and eIF4E1. These proteins were colocalized in a subpopulation of punctate cytoplasmic foci in radial precursor cell bodies and apical endfeet adjacent to the ventricle (Figure 4D). Since 4E-T and eIF4G both bind eIF4E1 at the W73 site, we asked about the relative distribution of granules containing these three proteins. Triple labeling of cultured precursors showed that many fewer foci were positive for 4E-T than for either eIF4E1 or eIF4G (Figure 4E; Figure S3B). Almost 70% of 4E-T-positive foci were positive for eIF4E1, but almost none were positive for eIF4G (Figure 4F). Conversely, only 2.7% ± 0.4% of eIF4E1-positive foci were positive for 4E-T (Figure 4E; Figure S3B). An additional 10.3% ± 0.8% of the eIF4E1-positive foci were positive for eIF4G, but most eIF4E1 foci were negative for both eIF4G and 4E-T (Figure 4E; Figure S3B), as previously seen in cell lines (Rau et al., 1996Rau M. Ohlmann T. Morley S.J. Pain V.M.J. A reevaluation of the cap-binding protein, eIF4E, as a rate-limiting factor for initiation of translation in reticulocyte lysate.J. Biol.

A role for the eIF4E-binding protein 4E-T in P-body formation and mRNA decay.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thus, 4E-T is present in a distinct population of granules, most of which contain eIF4E1 but not eIF4G. To test the idea that 4E-T might be the relevant repressive eIF4E1 binding partner, we used 4E-T shRNAs that knocked down cotransfected murine 4E-T in HEK293 cells (Figure 4G). When one of these shRNAs (4E-T shRNA2) was transfected into cultured precursors, it effectively reduced the bright 4E-T-positive granules present in control cells (Figure 4H; Figure S3C). We electroporated this 4E-T shRNA into E13/14 cortices and immunostained sections 3 days later. 4E-T knockdown decreased EGFP-positive cells in the VZ/SVZ and increased those in the CP (Figure 4I; Figure S3D), coincident with a decrease in EGFP-positive proliferating radial precursors (Figures 4J and 4K) and an increase in EGFP-positive, Satb2-positive, and βIII-tubulin-positive neurons (Figures 4L and 4M). As for eIF4E1 knockdown, Ctip2-positive and Tbr1-positive neurons were unaffected (Figure 4L; Figure S3E). Thus, 4E-T normally inhibits genesis of neurons from radial precursors. To ask if 4E-T requires binding to eIF4E to inhibit neurogenesis, we performed rescue experiments with shRNA-resistant constructs encoding wild-type 4E-T and mutant 4E-T incapable of binding eIF4E (Y30A mutant) (Ferraiuolo et al., 2005Ferraiuolo M.A. Basak S. Dostie J. Murray E.L. Schoenberg D.R. Sonenberg N. A role for the eIF4E-binding protein 4E-T in P-body formation and mRNA decay.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We showed that both 4E-T proteins were expressed equally well (Figure 4N) and then coelectroporated them with 4E-T shRNA into E13/14 cortices. Analysis 3 days later showed that wild-type, but not Y30A, 4E-T normalized all of the 4E-T knockdown-induced phenotypes, including the aberrant distribution of EGFP-positive cells (Figure 4O; Figure S3F), the decrease in proliferating radial precursors (Figures 4P and 4Q) and the increase in Satb2-positive neurons (Figure 4R). These data validate the specificity of the 4E-T knockdown phenotype and indicate that 4E-T requires binding to eIF4E to repress neurogenesis. These data suggest that an eIF4E1/4E-T complex is necessary to maintain radial precursors. To further test this idea, we overexpressed eIF4E1 and 4E-T, electroporating them into E13/14 cortices. Analysis 3 days later showed that eIF4E1 and 4E-T both significantly increased EGFP-positive cells in the VZ/SVZ (Figures S4A–S4C). eIF4E1 or 4E-T overexpression also caused a significant increase in Pax6-positive radial precursors (Figure 5A) and a decrease in Satb2-positive neurons (Figure 5B). Thus, eIF4E1 and 4E-T are each sufficient to maintain precursors and repress neurogenesis. 4E-T is thought to repress translation, in part, by association with P-bodies (Andrei et al., 2005Andrei M.A. Ingelfinger D. Heintzmann R. Achsel T. Rivera-Pomar R. Lührmann R.

A role for the eIF4E-binding protein 4E-T in P-body formation and mRNA decay.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To ask if eIF4E1 and 4E-T were associated with P-bodies in radial precursors, we analyzed two P-body proteins, the RNA-binding complex protein Lsm1 and the Dead box RNA helicase Rck/p54 (Eulalio et al., 2007Eulalio A. Behm-Ansmant I. Izaurralde E. P bodies: at the crossroads of post-transcriptional pathways.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Immunostaining showed that Lsm1 and Rck were present in cultured precursors, where they were highly colocalized with 4E-T (Figure 5C); almost all 4E-T-positive foci were colabeled for Lsm1 or Rck, while most Lsm1-positive or Rck-positive foci were colabeled for 4E-T (Figure 5D). Moreover, more than half of the Lsm1 granules also colabeled for eIF4E1, and almost none were colabeled for eIF4G (Figures 5E and 5F). Thus, radial precursors contain a P-body-like complex that includes 4E-T, Lsm1, and Rck, and more than half of the 4E-T-containing granules also contain eIF4E1 but not eIF4G. In cell lines, Lsm1 is required for P-body formation and for 4E-T association with P-bodies (Andrei et al., 2005Andrei M.A. Ingelfinger D. Heintzmann R. Achsel T. Rivera-Pomar R. Lührmann R. A role for eIF4E and eIF4E-transporter in targeting mRNPs to mammalian processing bodies.RNA. 2005; 11: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, Novotny et al., 2012Novotny I. Podolská K.

Cell. 2012; 23: 3776-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To ask if Lsm1 was necessary for 4E-T P-body association in radial precursors, we used an Lsm1 shRNA that knocked down FLAG-tagged murine Lsm1 when cotransfected in HEK293 cells (Figure 5G). Cultured precursors were transfected with Lsm1 shRNA and immunostained 3 days later (Figure 5H). Lsm1 knockdown reduced the number of 4E-T-positive granules per cell almost 3-fold (Figure 5I). These data suggest that P-body-like granules might be necessary for the repressive eIF4E1/4E-T complex in radial precursors. To test this idea, we electroporated E13/14 cortices with shRNAs for Lsm1 or Rck (Figure 5G) and immunostained sections 3 days later. As seen with knockdown of eIF4E or 4E-T, Lsm1 and Rck knockdown depleted EGFP-positive cells from the VZ/SVZ (Figures 5J and 5K), decreased EGFP-positive Pax6- or Ki67-positive radial precursors (Figures 5L and 5M), and increased Satb2-positive neurons (Figure 5N). These findings suggest that an eIF4E/4E-T complex localizes and represses translation of mRNAs that promote neurogenesis. Therefore, we isolated 4E-T-binding mRNAs from the E12/13 cortex, focusing on 4E-T since only a small proportion (3%) of the total eIF4E1 foci in radial precursors contained 4E-T. To do this, we immunoprecipitated cortical lysates with anti-4E-T and analyzed coimmunoprecipitated mRNAs by microarrays (Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO] accession number GSE61729). To control for nonspecific binding, we performed similar immunoprecipitations with control immunoglobulin G (IgG). We focused on transcripts that were at least 1.5-fold enriched in the 4E-T immunoprecipitates relative to the total input lysate and that were absent from the control IgG immunoprecipitates (see Experimental Procedures). This approach identified 1,545 4E-T-enriched precipitated mRNAs, of which 1,439 encoded known proteins (Table S1). Analysis of this latter group (Figure 6A) showed that the top six gene ontology categories were transcriptional regulators, with a particularly robust enrichment for transcription factors; of 1,439 4E-T target mRNAs, 253 (or 17.6%) were transcription factors. The next nine categories all had to do with cell differentiation, proliferation, and migration, with a particularly robust enrichment in mRNAs associated with differentiation of neural stem cells and the differentiation, development, and migration of neurons (Figure 6A). To analyze these mRNAs further, we categorized them into those involved in gene expression, cellular development, and cell growth and proliferation and looked at the overlap between these categories using a Venn diagram (Figure 6B). One hundred fifty-three of the mRNAs in these groups encoded proteins that were included in all three categories, and more than half of these encoded transcription factors (Figure 6C). Many of these transcription factors have been previously implicated in the regulation of neurogenesis, as shown by a heatmap (Figure 6D). To validate these findings, we focused on a subset of 4E-T-associated mRNAs that encoded neurogenic bHLHs known to be essential for cortical neurogenesis: ascl1, neurod1, neurod4, neurogenin1, and neurogenin2 mRNAs. We first used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to analyze their relative levels in three independent immunoprecipitates each with the 4E-T antibody and the nonspecific IgG. As controls, we performed a similar analysis for (1) godz and eIF4E mRNAs, which were not enriched in the 4E-T immunoprecipitates; (2) sprouty2 mRNA, which was robustly enriched; and (3) rpl27a mRNA, which was significantly decreased (Table S1). This analysis validated the microarray data and showed that all of the neurogenic bHLH mRNAs were enriched in the 4E-T immunoprecipitates, with at least a 4-fold enrichment for all except ascl1 (Figure 6E). In contrast, godz and eIF4E mRNAs were unchanged, and rpl27a mRNA was lower in the immunoprecipitates (Figure 6E). A comparison of the relative fold enrichment seen on the microarrays and by qPCR showed excellent correspondence between the two approaches (Figure 6F). Since neurod1, neurogenin2, and neurogenin1 mRNAs were all enriched more than 4-fold in 4E-T immunoprecipitates, we asked whether they colocalized with 4E-T in radial precursors in vivo. To do this, we performed fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for these mRNAs, coupled with immunocytochemistry for 4E-T on E15 cortical sections. neu"

The Masquelet technique is a relatively new innovation involving the induction of a fibrous tissue membrane around the bone defect site taking advantage of the body’s foreign body reaction to the presence of a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) spacer. The aim of this study was to investigate the properties and characteristics of this induced membrane and its effectiveness when used in conjunction with allograft or an allograft/autograft mix as filler materials in an ovine critical sized defect model. The resultant induced membrane was found to be effective in containing the graft materials in situ. It was demonstrated to be an organised pseudosynovial membrane which expressed bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2), transforming growth factor- beta (TGFβ), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), von Willerbrand factor (vWF), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 8 (IL-8). While more new bone growth was evident in the test groups compared to the controls animals at 12 weeks, the volumes were not statistically different and no defects were fully bridged. Of the two graft material groups, the allograft/autograft mix was shown to have a more rapid graft resorption rate than the allograft only group. While the Masquelet technique proved effective in producing a membrane to enclose graft materials, its ability to assist in the healing of critical sized segmental defects when compared to empty controls remained inconclusive."

We hypothesized that oral quercetin treatment might be protective in a rat model of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Three weeks after injection of monocrotaline, quercetin (10 mg/kg/d per os) or vehicle was administered for 10 days to adult Wistar rats. Quercetin significantly reduced mortality. In surviving animals, quercetin decreased pulmonary arterial pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy and muscularization of small pulmonary arteries. Classic biomarkers of pulmonary arterial hypertension such as the downregulated expression of lung BMPR2, Kv1.5, Kv2.1, upregulated survivin, endothelial dysfunction and hyperresponsiveness to 5-HT were unaffected by quercetin. Quercetin significantly restored the decrease in Kv currents, the upregulation of 5-HT2A receptors and reduced the Akt and S6 phosphorylation. In vitro, quercetin induced pulmonary artery vasodilator effects, inhibited pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. In conclusion, quercetin is partially protective in this rat model of PAH. It delayed mortality by lowering PAP, RVH and vascular remodeling. Quercetin exerted effective vasodilator effects in isolated PA, inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in PASMCs. These effects were associated with decreased 5-HT2A receptor expression and Akt and S6 phosphorylation and partially restored Kv currents. Therefore, quercetin could be useful in the treatment of PAH."
https://openalex.org/W1976676978,"The signaling capacity of seven-transmembrane/G-protein-coupled receptors (7TM/GPCRs) can be regulated through ligand-mediated receptor trafficking. Classically, the recycling of internalized receptors is associated with resensitization, whereas receptor degradation terminates signaling. We have shown previously that the incretin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) internalizes fast and is primarily resensitized through recycling back to the cell surface. GLP-1R is expressed in pancreatic islets together with the closely related glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIPR) and glucagon (GCGR) receptors. The interaction and cross-talk between coexpressed receptors is a wide phenomenon of the 7TM/GPCR superfamily. Numerous reports show functional consequences for signaling and trafficking of the involved receptors. On the basis of the high structural similarity and tissue coexpression, we here investigated the potential cross-talk between GLP-1R and GIPR or GCGR in both trafficking and signaling pathways. Using a real-time time-resolved FRET-based internalization assay, we show that GLP-1R, GIPR, and GCGR internalize with differential properties. Remarkably, upon coexpression of the internalizing GLP-1R and the non-internalizing GIPR, GLP-1-mediated GLP-1R internalization was impaired in a GIPR concentration-dependent manner. As a functional consequence of such impaired internalization capability, GLP-1-mediated GLP-1R signaling was abrogated. A similar compromised signaling was found when GLP-1R internalization was abrogated by a dominant-negative version of dynamin (dynamin-1 K44E), which provides a mechanistic link between GLP-1R trafficking and signaling. This study highlights the importance of receptor internalization for full functionality of GLP-1R. Moreover, cross-talk between the two incretin receptors GLP-1R and GIPR is shown to alter receptor trafficking with functional consequences for GLP-1R signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2073203830,"Mammalian Sterile 20 (Ste20)-like kinase 3 (MST3) is a ubiquitously expressed kinase capable of enhancing axon outgrowth. Whether and how MST3 kinase signaling might regulate development of dendritic filopodia and spine synapses is unknown. Through shRNA-mediated depletion of MST3 and kinase-dead MST3 expression in developing hippocampal cultures, we found that MST3 is necessary for proper filopodia, dendritic spine, and excitatory synapse development. Knockdown of MST3 in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons via in utero electroporation also reduced spine density in vivo. Using chemical genetics, we discovered thirteen candidate MST3 substrates and identified the phosphorylation sites. Among the identified MST3 substrates, TAO kinases regulate dendritic filopodia and spine development, similar to MST3. Furthermore, using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in culture (SILAC), we show that phosphorylated TAO1/2 associates with Myosin Va and is necessary for its dendritic localization, thus revealing a mechanism for excitatory synapse development in the mammalian CNS."
https://openalex.org/W1985103972,"Neighboring cortical excitatory neurons show considerable heterogeneity in their responses to sensory stimulation. We hypothesized that a subset of layer 2 excitatory neurons in the juvenile (P18 to 27) mouse whisker somatosensory cortex, distinguished by expression of the activity-dependent fosGFP reporter gene, would be preferentially activated by whisker stimulation. In fact, two-photon targeted, dual whole-cell recordings showed that principal whisker stimulation elicits similar amplitude synaptic responses in fosGFP-expressing and fosGFP(-) neurons. FosGFP(+) neurons instead displayed shorter latency and larger amplitude subthreshold responses to surround whisker stimulation. Using optogenetic stimulation, we determined that these neurons are targeted by axons from the posteromedial nucleus (POm), a paralemniscal thalamic nucleus associated with broad receptive fields and widespread cortical projections. We conclude that fosGFP expression discriminates between single- and multi-whisker receptive field layer 2 pyramidal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2040771014,"Most real-world odors are complex mixtures of distinct molecular components. Olfactory systems can adopt different strategies to contend with this stimulus complexity. In elemental processing, odor perception is derived from the sum of its parts; in configural processing, the parts are integrated into unique perceptual wholes. Here we used gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry techniques to deconstruct a complex natural food smell and assess whether olfactory salience is confined to the whole odor or is also embodied in its parts. By implementing an fMRI sensory-specific satiety paradigm, we identified reward-based changes in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) for the whole odor and for a small subset of components. Moreover, component-specific changes in OFC-amygdala connectivity correlated with perceived value. Our findings imply that the human brain has direct access to the elemental content of a natural food odor, and highlight the dynamic capacity of the olfactory system to engage both object-level and component-level mechanisms to subserve behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2080040231,"Both functional and also more recently resting state magnetic resonance imaging have become established tools to investigate functional brain networks. Most studies use these tools to compare different populations without controlling for potential differences in underlying brain structure which might affect the functional measurements of interest. Here, we adapt a simulation approach combined with evaluation of real resting state magnetic resonance imaging data to investigate the potential impact of partial volume effects on established functional and resting state magnetic resonance imaging analyses. We demonstrate that differences in the underlying structure lead to a significant increase in detected functional differences in both types of analyses. Largest increases in functional differences are observed for highest signal-to-noise ratios and when signal with the lowest amount of partial volume effects is compared to any other partial volume effect constellation. In real data, structural information explains about 25% of within-subject variance observed in degree centrality – an established resting state connectivity measurement. Controlling this measurement for structural information can substantially alter correlational maps obtained in group analyses. Our results question current approaches of evaluating these measurements in diseased population with known structural changes without controlling for potential differences in these measurements."

ITF2357 inhibits both Class I and II HDACs and reduces caspase-1 activity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the secretion of IL-1β and other cytokines at 25-100 nm; at concentrations >200 nm, ITF2357 is toxic in vitro. ITF3056, an analog of ITF2357, inhibits only HDAC8 (IC50 of 285 nm). Here we compared the production of IL-1β, IL-1α, TNFα, and IL-6 by ITF2357 with that of ITF3056 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), heat-killed Candida albicans, or anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies. ITF3056 reduced LPS-induced cytokines from 100 to 1000 nm; at 1000 nm, the secretion of IL-1β was reduced by 76%, secretion of TNFα was reduced by 88%, and secretion of IL-6 was reduced by 61%. The intracellular levels of IL-1α were 30% lower. There was no evidence of cell toxicity at ITF3056 concentrations of 100-1000 nm. Gene expression of TNFα was markedly reduced (80%), whereas IL-6 gene expression was 40% lower. Although anti-CD3/28 and Candida stimulation of IL-1β and TNFα was modestly reduced, IFNγ production was 75% lower. Mechanistically, ITF3056 reduced the secretion of processed IL-1β independent of inhibition of caspase-1 activity; however, synthesis of the IL-1β precursor was reduced by 40% without significant decrease in IL-1β mRNA levels. In mice, ITF3056 reduced LPS-induced serum TNFα by 85% and reduced IL-1β by 88%. These data suggest that specific inhibition of HDAC8 results in reduced inflammation without cell toxicity."

An analysis of trends and differentials in case notifications and treatment outcomes of TB may help improve our understanding of the performance of TB control services. Methods A retrospective trend analysis of TB cases was conducted in the Sidama Zone in southern Ethiopia. We registered all TB cases diagnosed and treated during 2003–2012 from all health facilities in the Sidama Zone, and analysed trends of TB case notification rates and treatment outcomes. Results The smear positive (PTB+) case notification rate (CNR) increased from 55 (95% CI 52.5–58.4) to 111 (95% CI 107.4–114.4) per 105 people. The CNRs of PTB+ in people older than 45 years increased by fourfold, while the mortality of cases during treatment declined from 11% to 3% for smear negative (PTB-) (X2trend, P<0.001) and from 5% to 2% for PTB+ (X2trend, P<0.001). The treatment success was higher in rural areas (AOR 1.11; CI 95%: 1.03–1.2), less for PTB- (AOR 0.86; CI 95%: 0.80–0.92) and higher for extra-pulmonary TB (AOR 1.10; CI 95%: 1.02–1.19) compared to PTB+. A higher lost-to-follow up was observed in men (AOR 1.15; CI 95%: 1.06–1.24) and among PTB- cases (AOR 1.14; CI 95%: 1.03–1.25). More deaths occurred in PTB-cases (AOR 1.65; 95% CI: 1.44–1.90) and among cases older than 65 years (AOR 3.86; CI 95%: 2.94–5.10). Lastly, retreatment cases had a higher mortality than new cases (6% vs 3%). Conclusion Over the past decade TB CNRs and treatment outcomes improved, whereas the disparities of disease burden by gender and place of residence reduced and mortality declined. Strategies should be devised to address higher risk groups for poor treatment outcomes."

After NOGA-guided transendocardial injection, we quantified engraftment of escalating doses of allogeneic cardiospheres or cardiosphere-derived cells in minipigs (n = 22) post-MI. Next, a dose-ranging, blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled (""dose optimization"") study of transendocardial injection of the better-engrafting product was performed in infarcted minipigs (n = 16). Finally, the superior product and dose (150 million cardiospheres) were tested in a blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled (""pivotal"") study (n = 22). Contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI revealed that all cardiosphere doses preserved systolic function and attenuated remodeling. The maximum feasible dose (150 million cells) was most effective in reducing scar size, increasing viable myocardium and improving ejection fraction. In the pivotal study, eight weeks post-injection, histopathology demonstrated no excess inflammation, and no myocyte hypertrophy, in treated minipigs versus controls. No alloreactive donor-specific antibodies developed over time. MRI showed reduced scar size, increased viable mass, and attenuation of cardiac dilatation with no effect on ejection fraction in the treated group compared to placebo.Dose-optimized injection of allogeneic cardiospheres is safe, decreases scar size, increases viable myocardium, and attenuates cardiac dilatation in porcine chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy. The decreases in scar size, mirrored by increases in viable myocardium, are consistent with therapeutic regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2058943028,"Aims/Hypothesis To investigate secular trends in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors during a decade of follow-up in a Middle Eastern cohort, and to compare observed trends between diabetic and non-diabetic populations. Methods In a population of 6181 participants (2622 males and 3559 females), diabetes status and CVD risk factors were evaluated in 4 study phases from 1999–2011. 1045 subjects had type 2 diabetes mellitus at baseline and 5136 participants were diabetes-free. To examine the trends of CVD risk factors, generalized estimation equation models were constructed. The interaction between the diabetes status and each phase of the study was checked in a separate model. Results During the follow-up period diabetic females significantly gained better control of their blood pressure, serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol and general and central obesity measures compared to non-diabetic counterparts, although 60% of them had high BP and 64% had high serum LDL-C levels till the end of the study. Diabetic males however, experienced significantly better control on their serum LDL-C and general and central obesity measures compared to their non-diabetic controls; but 24% of them were still smoker, 63% had high BP and 60% had high serum LDL-C levels at the end of the follow-up (all Ps interaction <0.05). Use of lipid-lowering and antihypertensive medications increased consistently in both diabetic and non-diabetic populations.

https://openalex.org/W2068179227,"Background Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a progressive disease that is characterized by dyspnea and exercise intolerance. Impairment in skeletal muscle has recently been described in PAH, although the degree to which this impairment is solely determined by the hemodynamic profile remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to verify the association of structural and functional skeletal muscle characteristics with maximum exercise in PAH. Methods The exercise capacity, body composition, CT area of limb muscle, quality of life, quadriceps biopsy and hemodynamics of 16 PAH patients were compared with those of 10 controls. Results PAH patients had a significantly poorer quality of life, reduced percentage of lean body mass, reduced respiratory muscle strength, reduced resistance and strength of quadriceps and increased functional limitation at 6MWT and CPET. VO2 max was correlated with muscular variables and cardiac output. Bivariate linear regression models showed that the association between muscular structural and functional variables remained significant even after correcting for cardiac output. Conclusion Our study showed the coexistence of ventilatory and quadriceps weakness in face of exercise intolerance in the same group of PAH patients. More interestingly, it is the first time that the independent association between muscular pattern and maximum exercise capacity is evidenced in PAH, independently of cardiac index highlighting the importance of considering rehabilitation in the treatment strategy for PAH."
https://openalex.org/W2070014120,"Background Aim of this study was to evaluate the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of carbon (12C) and oxygen ion (16O)-irradiation applied in the raster-scanning technique at the Heidelberg Ion beam Therapy center (HIT) based on clonogenic survival in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines compared to photon irradiation. Methods Four human HCC lines Hep3B, PLC, HepG2 and HUH7 were irradiated with photons, 12C and 16O using a customized experimental setting at HIT for in-vitro trials. Cells were irradiated with increasing physical photon single doses of 0, 2, 4 and 6 Gy and heavy ionsingle doses of 0, 0.125, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 Gy (12C and 16O). SOBP-penetration depth and extension was 35 mm +/−4 mm and 36 mm +/−5 mm for carbon ions and oxygen ions respectively. Mean energy level and mean linear energy transfer (LET) were 130 MeV/u and 112 keV/um for 12C, and 154 MeV/u and 146 keV/um for 16O. Clonogenic survival was computated and realtive biological effectiveness (RBE) values were defined. Results For all cell lines and both particle modalities α- and β-values were determined. As expected, α-values were significantly higher for 12C and 16O than for photons, reflecting a steeper decline of the initial slope of the survival curves for high-LET beams. RBE-values were in the range of 2.1–3.3 and 1.9–3.1 for 12C and 16O, respectively. Conclusion Both irradiation with 12C and 16O using the rasterscanning technique leads to an enhanced RBE in HCC cell lines. No relevant differences between achieved RBE-values for 12C and 16O were found. Results of this work will further influence biological-adapted treatment planning for HCC patients that will undergo particle therapy with 12C or 16O."

Recent data suggest that LKB1 is essential in regulating homeostasis of hematopoietic cells and immune responses. However, its role in macrophages and innate immune system remains unclear. Here we report that macrophage LKB1 inhibits pro-inflammatory signaling in response to LPS. LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory enzymes were monitored in bone marrow-derived macrophages isolated from myeloid cell-specific LKB1 knock out mice and their wild type littermate control mice. LPS induced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory enzymes in bone marrow-derived macrophages from LKB1 KO than those from wild type mice. Consistently, LPS induced higher levels of NF-κB activation in LKB1-deficient macrophages than those in wild type. Further, LPS stimulation significantly increased LKB1 phosphorylation at serine 428, which promoted its binding to IκB kinaseβ (IKKβ), resulting in the inhibition of NF-κB.

https://openalex.org/W2066806063,"Emotion expression in human-human interaction takes place via various types of information, including body motion. Research on the perceptual-cognitive mechanisms underlying the processing of natural emotional body language can benefit greatly from datasets of natural emotional body expressions that facilitate stimulus manipulation and analysis. The existing databases have so far focused on few emotion categories which display predominantly prototypical, exaggerated emotion expressions. Moreover, many of these databases consist of video recordings which limit the ability to manipulate and analyse the physical properties of these stimuli. We present a new database consisting of a large set (over 1400) of natural emotional body expressions typical of monologues. To achieve close-to-natural emotional body expressions, amateur actors were narrating coherent stories while their body movements were recorded with motion capture technology. The resulting 3-dimensional motion data recorded at a high frame rate (120 frames per second) provides fine-grained information about body movements and allows the manipulation of movement on a body joint basis. For each expression it gives the positions and orientations in space of 23 body joints for every frame. We report the results of physical motion properties analysis and of an emotion categorisation study. The reactions of observers from the emotion categorisation study are included in the database. Moreover, we recorded the intended emotion expression for each motion sequence from the actor to allow for investigations regarding the link between intended and perceived emotions. The motion sequences along with the accompanying information are made available in a searchable MPI Emotional Body Expression Database. We hope that this database will enable researchers to study expression and perception of naturally occurring emotional body expressions in greater depth."
https://openalex.org/W2052781090,"Purpose The diagnosis and monitoring of liver fibrosis is an important clinical issue; however, this is usually achieved by invasive methods such as biopsy. We aimed to determine whether histogram analysis of hepatobiliary phase images of gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide non-invasive quantitative measurement of liver fibrosis. Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and a waiver of informed consent was obtained. Hepatobiliary phase images of preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI studies of 105 patients (69 males, 36 females; age 56.1±12.2) with pathologically documented liver fibrosis grades were analyzed. Fibrosis staging was F0/F1/F2/F3/F4 (METAVIR system) for 11/20/13/15/46 patients, respectively. Four regions-of-interest (ROI, each about 2 cm2) were placed on predetermined locations of representative images. The measured signal intensity of pixels in each ROI was used to calculate corrected coefficient of variation (cCV), skewness, and kurtosis. An average value of each parameter was calculated for comparison. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and linear regression. Results The cCV showed statistically significant differences among pathological fibrosis grades (P<0.001) whereas skewness and kurtosis did not. Univariable linear regression analysis suggested cCV to be a meaningful parameter in predicting the fibrosis grade (P<0.001, β = 0.40 and standard error = 0.06). For discriminating F0-3 from F4, the area under ROC score was 0.857, standard deviation 0.036, 95% confidence interval 0.785–0.928. Conclusion Histogram analysis of hepatobiliary phase images of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI can provide non-invasive quantitative measurements of hepatic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W1992398556,"Banana Fusarium wilt is a soil–spread fungal disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum. In China, the main virulence fungi in banana are F. oxysporum race 1 (F1, weak virulence) and race 4 (F4, strong virulence). To date, no proteomic analyses have compared the two races, but the difference in virulence between F1 and F4 might result from their differentially expressed proteins. Here we report the first comparative proteomics of F1 and F4 cultured under various conditions, and finally identify 99 protein species, which represent 59 unique proteins. These proteins are mainly involved in carbohydrate metabolism, post-translational modification, energy production, and inorganic ion transport. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that among the 46 proteins identified from F4 were several enzymes that might be important for virulence. Reverse transcription PCR analysis of the genes for 15 of the 56 proteins revealed that their transcriptional patterns were similar to their protein expression patterns. Taken together, these data suggest that proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism and ion transport may be important in the pathogenesis of banana Fusarium wilt. Some enzymes such as catalase-peroxidase, galactosidase and chitinase might contribute to the strong virulence of F4. Overexpression or knockout of the genes for the F4-specific proteins will help us to further understand the molecular mechanism of Fusarium-induced banana wilt."
https://openalex.org/W2152312218,"Hypothermia is ineffective in 45% of neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Xenon has additive neuroprotective properties, but is expensive, and its application complicated. Argon gas is cheaper, easier to apply, and also has neuroprotective properties in experimental settings. The aim was to explore the safety of argon ventilation in newborn piglets. Methods Eight newborn piglets (weight 1.4–3.0 kg) were used. Heart rate, blood pressure, regional cerebral saturation, and electrocortical brain activity were measured continuously. All experiments had a 30 min. baseline period, followed by three 60 min. periods of argon ventilation alternated with 30 min argon washout periods. Two animals were ventilated with increasing concentrations of argon (1h 30%, 1 h 50%, and 1 h 80%), two were subjected to 60 min. hypoxia (FiO2 0.08) before commencing 50% argon ventilation, and two animals received hypothermia following hypoxia as well as 50% argon ventilation. Two animals served as home cage controls and were terminated immediately. Results Argon ventilation did not result in a significant change of heart rate (mean ± s.d. −3.5±3.6 bpm), blood pressure (−0.60±1.11 mmHg), cerebral oxygen saturation (0.3±0.9%), electrocortical brain activity (−0.4±0.7 µV), or blood gas values. Argon ventilation resulted in elevated argon concentrations compared to the home cage controls (34.5, 25.4, and 22.4 vs. 7.3 µl/ml). Conclusion Ventilation with up to 80% argon during normoxia, and 50% argon after hypoxia did not affect heart rate, blood pressure, cerebral saturation and electrocortical brain activity. Clinical safety studies of argon ventilation in humans seem justified."
https://openalex.org/W2170678790,"Wnt signaling pathway is an essential player during vertebrate embryonic development which has been associated with several developmental processes such as gastrulation, body axis formation and morphogenesis of numerous organs, namely the lung. Wnt proteins act through specific transmembrane receptors, which activate intracellular pathways that regulate cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation and death. Morphogenesis of the fetal lung depends on epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that are governed by several growth and transcription factors that regulate cell proliferation, fate, migration and differentiation. This process is controlled by different signaling pathways such as FGF, Shh and Wnt among others. Wnt signaling is recognized as a key molecular player in mammalian pulmonary development but little is known about its function in avian lung development. The present work characterizes, for the first time, the expression pattern of several Wnt signaling members, such as wnt-1, wnt-2b, wnt-3a, wnt-5a, wnt-7b, wnt-8b, wnt-9a, lrp5, lrp6, sfrp1, dkk1, β-catenin and axin2 at early stages of chick lung development. In general, their expression is similar to their mammalian counterparts. By assessing protein expression levels of active/total β-catenin and phospho-LRP6/LRP6 it is revealed that canonical Wnt signaling is active in this embryonic tissue. In vitro inhibition studies were performed in order to evaluate the function of Wnt signaling pathway in lung branching. Lung explants treated with canonical Wnt signaling inhibitors (FH535 and PK115-584) presented an impairment of secondary branch formation after 48 h of culture along with a decrease in axin2 expression levels. Branching analysis confirmed this inhibition. Wnt-FGF crosstalk assessment revealed that this interaction is preserved in the chick lung. This study demonstrates that Wnt signaling is crucial for precise chick lung branching and further supports the avian lung as a good model for branching studies since it recapitulates early mammalian pulmonary development."
https://openalex.org/W1984900217,"Divergent selection and adaptive divergence can increase phenotypic diversification amongst populations and lineages. Yet adaptive divergence between different environments, habitats or niches does not occur in all lineages. For example, the colonization of freshwater environments by ancestral marine species has triggered adaptive radiation and phenotypic diversification in some taxa but not in others. Studying closely related lineages differing in their ability to diversify is an excellent means of understanding the factors promoting and constraining adaptive evolution. A well-known example of the evolution of increased phenotypic diversification following freshwater colonization is the three-spined stickleback. Two closely related stickleback lineages, the Pacific Ocean and the Japan Sea occur in Japan. However, Japanese freshwater stickleback populations are derived from the Pacific Ocean lineage only, suggesting the Japan Sea lineage is unable to colonize freshwater. Using stable isotope data and trophic morphology, we first show higher rates of phenotypic and ecological diversification between marine and freshwater populations within the Pacific Ocean lineage, confirming adaptive divergence has occurred between the two lineages and within the Pacific Ocean lineage but not in the Japan Sea lineage. We further identified consistent divergence in diet and foraging behaviour between marine forms from each lineage, confirming Pacific Ocean marine sticklebacks, from which all Japanese freshwater populations are derived, are better adapted to freshwater environments than Japan Sea sticklebacks. We suggest adaptive divergence between ancestral marine populations may have played a role in constraining phenotypic diversification and adaptive evolution in Japanese sticklebacks."
https://openalex.org/W2087091883,"Due to its ability to be rapidly generated and propagated over long distances, H2O2 is an important second messenger for biotic and abiotic stress signaling in plants. In response to low water potential and high salt concentrations sensed in the roots of plants, the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA) activates NADPH oxidase to generate H2O2, which is propagated in guard cells in leaves to induce stomatal closure and prevent water loss from transpiration. Using a reconstituted system, we demonstrate that H2O2 reversibly prevents the protein phosphatase HAB1, a key component of the core ABA-signaling pathway, from inhibiting its main target in guard cells, SnRK2.6/OST1 kinase. We have identified HAB1 C186 and C274 as H2O2-sensitive thiols and demonstrate that their oxidation inhibits both HAB1 catalytic activity and its ability to physically associate with SnRK2.6 by formation of intermolecular dimers."
https://openalex.org/W2116383803,"Introduction As part of maternal mortality reducing strategies, coverage of delivery care among sub-Saharan African rural poor will improve, with a range of facilities providing services. Whether high coverage will benefit all socio-economic groups is unknown. Iringa rural District, Southern Tanzania, with high facility delivery coverage, offers a paradigm to address this question. Delivery services are available in first-line facilities (dispensaries, health centres) and one hospital. We assessed whether all socio-economic groups access the only comprehensive emergency obstetric care facility equally, and surveyed existing delivery services. Methods District population characteristics were obtained from a household community survey (n = 463). A Hospital survey collected data on women who delivered in this facility (n = 1072). Principal component analysis on household assets was used to assess socio-economic status. Hospital population socio-demographic characteristics were compared to District population using multivariable logistic regression. Deliveries' distribution in District facilities and staffing were analysed using routine data. Results Women from the hospital compared to the District population were more likely to be wealthier. Adjusted odds ratio of hospital delivery increased progressively across socio-economic groups, from 1.73 for the poorer (p = 0.0031) to 4.53 (p<0.0001) for the richest. Remarkable dispersion of deliveries and poor staffing were found. In 2012, 5505/7645 (72%) institutional deliveries took place in 68 first-line facilities, the remaining in the hospital. 56/68 (67.6%) first-line facilities reported ≤100 deliveries/year, attending 33% of deliveries. Insufficient numbers of skilled birth attendants were found in 42.9% of facilities. Discussion Poorer women remain disadvantaged in high coverage, as they access lower level facilities and are under-represented where life-saving transfusions and caesarean sections are available. Tackling the challenges posed by low caseloads and staffing on first-line rural care requires confronting a dilemma between coverage and quality. Reducing number of delivery sites is recommended to improve quality and equity of care."
https://openalex.org/W1993225970,"Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1), one of two SK enzymes, is highly regulated and has been shown to act as a focal point for the action of many growth factors and cytokines. SK1 leads to generation of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and potentially the activation of S1P receptors to mediate biologic effects. Our previous studies implicated SK1/S1P in the regulation of inflammatory processes, specifically in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These studies were conducted using a total body knockout mouse for SK1 and were unable to determine the source of SK1/S1P (hematopoietic or extra-hematopoietic) involved in the inflammatory responses. Therefore, bone marrow transplants were performed with wild-type (WT) and SK1-/- mice and colitis induced with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Irrespective of the source of SK1/S1P, bone marrow or tissue, DSS induced colitis in all mice; however, mice lacking SK1 in both hematopoietic and extra-hematopoietic compartments exhibited decreased crypt damage. Systemic inflammation was assessed, and mice with WT bone marrow demonstrated significant neutrophilia in response to DSS. In the local inflammatory response, mice lacking SK1/S1P in either bone marrow or tissue exhibited decreased induction of cytokines and less activation of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3). Interestingly, we determined that extra-hematopoietic SK1 is necessary for the induction of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) in colon epithelium in response to DSS-induced colitis. Taken together our data suggest that hematopoietic-derived SK1/S1P regulates specific aspects of the systemic inflammatory response, while extra-hematopoietic SK1 in the colon epithelium is necessary for the autocrine induction of COX2 in DSS-induced colitis."

Maintaining regulated cell growth ensures an intact protective layer towards microbial-induced cellular damage. Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections disrupt host cell cycle regulation machinery and the infection causes DNA double strand breaks that delay progression through the G2/M phase. We show that intracellular gonococci upregulate and release restriction endonucleases that enter the nucleus and damage human chromosomal DNA. Bacterial lysates containing restriction endonucleases were able to fragment genomic DNA as detected by PFGE. Lysates were also microinjected into the cytoplasm of cells in interphase and after 20 h, DNA double strand breaks were identified by 53BP1 staining. In addition, by using live-cell microscopy and NHS-ester stained live gonococci we visualized the subcellular location of the bacteria upon mitosis. Infected cells show dysregulation of the spindle assembly checkpoint proteins MAD1 and MAD2, impaired and prolonged M-phase, nuclear swelling, micronuclei formation and chromosomal instability. These data highlight basic molecular functions of how gonococcal infections affect host cell cycle regulation, cause DNA double strand breaks and predispose cellular malignancies."

We performed exome analyses of tumors and matched normal tissues of 34 Japanese patients with HGSOC and observed a substantial number of patients without TP53 mutation (24%, 8/34). Combined with the results of copy number variation analyses, we subdivided the 34 patients with HGSOC into subtypes designated ST1 and ST2. ST1 showed intact p53 pathway and was characterized by fewer somatic mutations and copy number alterations. In contrast, the p53 pathway was impaired in ST2, which is characterized by abundant somatic mutations and copy number alterations. Gene expression profiles combined with analyses using the Gene Ontology resource indicate the involvement of specific biological processes (mitosis and DNA helicase) that are relevant to genomic stability and cancer etiology. In particular we demonstrate the presence of a novel subtype of patients with HGSOC that is characterized by an intact p53 pathway, with limited genomic alterations and specific gene expression profiles."
https://openalex.org/W2000431623,"In mice the chemokine Cxcl12 and its receptor Cxcr4 participate in maintenance of the spermatogonial population during postnatal development. More complexity arises since Cxcl12 also binds to the non-classical/atypical chemokine receptor Cxcr7. We explored the expression pattern of Cxcl12, Cxcr4 and Cxcr7 during postnatal development in mouse testes and investigated the response of Cxcl12, Cxcr4, Cxcr7 and SSC-niche associated factors to busulfan-induced germ cell depletion and subsequent recovery by RNA expression analysis and localization of the proteins. In neonatal testes transcript levels of Cxcl12, Cxcr4 and Cxcr7 were relatively low and protein expression of Cxcr7 was restricted to gonocytes and spermatogonia. During development, RNA expression of Cxcl12 remained stable but that of Cxcr4 and Cxcr7 increased. Cxcr7 was expressed in germ cells located at the basement membrane of the seminiferous tubules. In adult testes, transcript levels of Cxcl12 were highest while the localization of Cxcr7 did not change. Following germ cell depletion, a significantly increased expression of Cxcl12 and a decreased expression of Cxcr7 were observed. Germ cells repopulating the seminiferous tubules were immunopositive for Cxcr7. We conclude that Cxcr7 expression to be restricted to premeiotic germ cells throughout postnatal testicular development and during testicular recovery. Hence, the spermatogonial population may not only be simply controlled by interaction of Cxcl12 with Cxcr4 but may also involve Cxcr7 as an important player."

Here we report on the misleading high MICs of Candida spp. to azoles using the ATB FUNGUS 3 (bioMérieux, La Balme-les Grottes, France) with automated readings in China to highlight the dangers of introducing a diagnostic assay without validation. ATB FUNGUS 3 is the most commonly used commercial antifungal susceptibility testing method in China. An in-depth analysis of data showed higher levels of resistance to azoles when ATB FUNGUS 3 strips were read automatically than when read visually. Based on this finding, the performance of ATB FUNGUS 3, read both visually and automatically, was evaluated by testing 218 isolates of five clinically important Candida species, using broth microdilution (BMD) following CLSI M27-A3 as the gold-standard. The overall essential agreement (EA) between ATB visual readings and BMD was 99.1%. In contrast, the ATB automated readings showed higher discrepancies with BMD, with overall EA of 86.2%, and specifically lower EA was observed for fluconazole (80.7%), voriconazole (77.5%), and itraconazole (73.4%), which was most likely due to the trailing effect of azoles. The major errors in azole drug susceptibilities by ATB automated readings is a concern in China that can result in misleading clinical antifungal drug selection and pseudo high rates of antifungal resistance. Therefore, the ATB visual reading is generally recommended. In the meantime, we propose a practical algorithm to be followed for ATB FUNGUS 3 antifungal susceptibility for Candida spp. before the improvement in the automated reading system."

Patients who had dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) grades III-IV, organ failure (cardiovascular, respiratory, liver, renal or hematologic), impaired consciousness, or aspartate aminotransferase more than 1,000 units/L, were classified as having severe DVI. To determine the fatality risk factors of severe DVI, the classification trees were constructed based on manual recursive partitioning.Of the 238 children with severe DVI, 30 (12.6%) died. Compared to the non-fatal DVI cases, the fatal cases had higher rates of DHF grade IV (96.7% vs 24.5%), repeated shock (93.3% vs 27.9%), acute respiratory failure (ARF) (100% vs 6.7%), acute liver failure (ALF) (96.6% vs 6.3%), acute kidney injury (AKI) (79.3% vs 4.5%), and active bleeding requiring blood transfusion (93.3% vs 5.4%), all p<0.01. The combined risk factors of ARF and active bleeding considered together predicted fatal outcome with sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of 0.93 (0.78-0.99), 0.97 (0.93-0.99), 0.99 (0.97-1.00), and 0.82 (0.65-0.93), respectively. The likelihood ratios for a fatal outcome in the patients who had and did not have this risk combination were 32.4 (14.6-71.7) and 0.07 (0.02-0.26), respectively.Severe DVI patients who have ARF and active bleeding are at a high risk of death, while patients without these things together should survive."

Biodistribution studies showed that both 90Y- and 177Lu-anti-murine CD45 Ab conjugates (DOTA-30F11) targeted hematologic tissues, as at 24 hours 48.8±21.2 and 156±14.6% injected dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g) of 90Y-DOTA-30F11 and 54.2±9.5 and 199±11.7% ID/g of 177Lu-DOTA-30F11 accumulated in bone marrow (BM) and spleen, respectively. However, 90Y-DOTA-30F11 RIT demonstrated a dose-dependent survival benefit: 60% of mice treated with 300 µCi 90Y-DOTA-30F11 lived over 180 days after therapy, and mice treated with 100 µCi 90Y-DOTA-30F11 had a median survival 66 days. 90Y-anti-CD45 RIT was associated with transient, mild myelotoxicity without hepatic or renal toxicity. Conversely, 177Lu- anti-CD45 RIT yielded no long-term survivors. Thus, 90Y was more effective than 177Lu for anti-CD45 RIT of AML in this murine leukemia model."

Methods In a prospective observational study, we included 55 patients with a macula-off RRD. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), color vision (saturated and desaturated color confusion indices (CCI)) and contrast acuity were measured at 12 months postoperatively in both the RRD eye and the fellow control eye, and the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) was filled out. Results Operated and fellow control eyes differed significantly in mean LogMAR BCVA (P<0.0001), median Log contrast acuity (P<0.0001), saturated CCI (P = 0.009), and desaturated CCI (P = 0.016). Significant correlations were observed between the NEI VFQ-25 overall composite score and postoperative LogMAR BCVA (R = −0.551, P<0.0001), contrast acuity (R = 0.472, P<0.0001), saturated CCI (R = −0.315, P = 0.023), and desaturated CCI (R = −0.283, P = 0.044). Conclusions A lower VR-QOL was highly correlated to a worse postoperative BCVA and contrast acuity and to a lesser extent to color vision disturbances."

Comparing the effect of CFS-1686 on cell cycle progression with the topoisomerase 1 inhibitor camptothecin revealed that CFS-1686 and camptothecin reduced DNA synthesis in S-phase, resulting in cell cycle arrest at the intra-S phase and G1-S boundary, respectively. The DNA damage in CFS-1686 and camptothecin treated cells was evaluated by the level of ATM phosphorylation, γH2AX, and γH2AX foci, showing that camptothecin was more effective than CFS-1686. However, despite its lower DNA damage capacity, CFS-1686 demonstrated 4-fold higher inhibition of topoisomerase 1 than camptothecin in a DNA relaxation assay. Unlike camptothecin, CFS-1686 demonstrated no activity on topoisomerase 1 in a DNA cleavage assay, but nevertheless it reduced the camptothecin-induced DNA cleavage of topoisomerase 1 in a dose-dependent manner. Our results indicate that CFS-1686 might bind to topoisomerase 1 to inhibit this enzyme from interacting with DNA relaxation activity, unlike campothecin's induction of a topoisomerase 1-DNA cleavage complex. Finally, we used a computer docking strategy to localize the potential binding site of CFS-1686 to topoisomerase 1, further indicating that CFS-1686 might inhibit the binding of Top1 to DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2082494591,"An ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) method using ethanol was applied for extracting arabinogalactan (AG) and dihydroquercetin (DHQ) simultaneously from larch wood, as a pretreatment for pulping and papermaking. The extraction parameters were optimized by a Box-Behnken experimental design with the yields of AG and DHQ as the response values. Under optimum conditions (three extractions, each using 40% ethanol, for 50 min, 200 W ultrasound power and 1∶18 solid-liquid ratio), the yields of AG and DHQ were 183.4 and 36.76 mg/g, respectively. After UAE pretreated, the wood chips were used for Kraft pulping (KP) and high boiling solvent pulping (HBSP). The pulping yield after pretreatment was higher than that of untreated (the pulping yields of untreated HBSP and KP were 42.37% and 39.60%, and the pulping yields of HBSP and KP after UAE-pretreated were 44.23% and 41.50% respectively), as indicated by a lower kappa number (77.91 and 27.30 for untreated HBSP and KP; 77.01 and 26.83 for UAE-pretreated HBSP and KP). Furthermore, the characteristics of paper produced from pretreated wood chips were superior to those from the untreated chips: the basis weight was lower (85.67 and 82.48 g·cm−2 for paper from untreated KP and HBSP; 79.94 and 80.25 g·cm−2 for paper from UAE-pretreated KP and HBSP), and the tensile strengths, tearing strengths, bursting strengths, and folding strengths were higher than these of paper after UAE-pretreated, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2116886973,"Branching morphogenesis is a critical step in the development of many epithelial organs. The phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway has been identified as a central component of this process but the precise role has not been fully established. Herein we sought to determine the role of PI3K in murine lung branching using a series of pharmacological inhibitors directed at this pathway. The pan-class I PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474 greatly enhanced the branching potential of whole murine lung explants as measured by an increase in the number of terminal branches compared with controls over 48 hours. This enhancement of branching was also observed following inhibition of the downstream signalling components of PI3K, Akt and mTOR. Isoform selective inhibitors of PI3K identified that the alpha isoform of PI3K is a key driver in branching morphogenesis. To determine if the effect of PI3K inhibition on branching was specific to the lung epithelium or secondary to an effect on the mesenchyme we assessed the impact of PI3K inhibition in cultures of mesenchyme-free lung epithelium. Isolated lung epithelium cultured with FGF7 formed large cyst-like structures, whereas co-culture with FGF7 and ZSTK474 induced the formation of defined branches with an intact lumen. Together these data suggest a novel role for PI3K in the branching program of the murine embryonic lung contradictory to that reported in other branching organs. Our observations also point towards PI3K acting as a morphogenic switch for FGF7 signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2069874241,"Multi-dose radiotherapy protocols (fraction dose and timing) currently used in the clinic are the product of human selection based on habit, received wisdom, physician experience and intra-day patient timetabling. However, due to combinatorial considerations, the potential treatment protocol space for a given total dose or treatment length is enormous, even for relatively coarse search; well beyond the capacity of traditional in-vitro methods. In constrast, high fidelity numerical simulation of tumor development is well suited to the challenge. Building on our previous single-dose numerical simulation model of EMT6/Ro spheroids, a multi-dose irradiation response module is added and calibrated to the effective dose arising from 18 independent multi-dose treatment programs available in the experimental literature. With the developed model a constrained, non-linear, search for better performing cadidate protocols is conducted within the vicinity of two benchmarks by genetic algorithm (GA) techniques. After evaluating less than 0.01% of the potential benchmark protocol space, candidate protocols were identified by the GA which conferred an average of 9.4% (max benefit 16.5%) and 7.1% (13.3%) improvement (reduction) on tumour cell count compared to the two benchmarks, respectively. Noticing that a convergent phenomenon of the top performing protocols was their temporal synchronicity, a further series of numerical experiments was conducted with periodic time-gap protocols (10 h to 23 h), leading to the discovery that the performance of the GA search candidates could be replicated by 17–18 h periodic candidates. Further dynamic irradiation-response cell-phase analysis revealed that such periodicity cohered with latent EMT6/Ro cell-phase temporal patterning. Taken together, this study provides powerful evidence towards the hypothesis that even simple inter-fraction timing variations for a given fractional dose program may present a facile, and highly cost-effecitive means of significantly improving clinical efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2048609059,"Silencing of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) in tumors, mainly through promoter methylation, correlates with a better therapeutic response and with increased survival. Therefore, it is conceivable to consider MGMT as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cancers. Our previous results demonstrated the pivotal role of NF-kappaB in MGMT expression, mediated mainly through p65/NF-kappaB homodimers. Here we show that the non-canonical NF-KappaB motif (MGMT-kappaB1) within MGMT enhancer is probably the major inducer of MGMT expression following NF-kappaB activation. Thus, in an attempt to attenuate the transcription activity of MGMT in tumors we designed locked nucleic acids (LNA) modified decoy oligonucleotides corresponding to the specific sequence of MGMT-kappaB1 (MGMT-kB1-LODN). Following confirmation of the ability of MGMT-kB1-LODN to interfere with the binding of p65/NF-kappaB to the NF-KappaB motif within MGMT enhancer, the efficacy of the decoy was studied in-vitro and in-vivo. The results of these experiments show that the decoy MGMT-kB1-LODN have a substantial antineoplastic effect when used either in combination with temozolomide or as monotherapy. Our results suggest that MGMT-kB1-LODN may provide a novel strategy for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2064896725,"Background Influenza A virus has a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that is composed of three subunits (PB1, PB2 and PA subunit), which assemble with nucleoproteins (NP) and a viral RNA (vRNA) to form a RNP complex in the host nucleus. Recently, we demonstrated that the combination of influenza ribonucleoprotein (RNP) components is important for both its assembly and activity. Therefore, we questioned whether the inhibition of the RNP combination via an incompatible component in the RNP complex could become a methodology for an anti-influenza drug. Methodology/Principal Findings We found that a H5N1 PB2 subunit efficiently inhibits H1N1 RNP assembly and activity. Moreover, we determined the domains and important amino acids on the N-terminus of the PB2 subunit that are required for a strong inhibitory effect. The NP binding site of the PB2 subunit is important for the inhibition of RNP activity by another strain. A plaque assay also confirmed that a fragment of the PB2 subunit could inhibit viral replication. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that the N-terminal fragment of a PB2 subunit becomes an inhibitor that targets influenza RNP activity that is different from that targeted by current drugs such as M2 and NA inhibitors."
