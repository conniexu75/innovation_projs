https://openalex.org/W4308620605,"A spinal cord injury interrupts pathways from the brain and brainstem that project to the lumbar spinal cord, leading to paralysis. Here we show that spatiotemporal epidural electrical stimulation (EES) of the lumbar spinal cord1-3 applied during neurorehabilitation4,5 (EESREHAB) restored walking in nine individuals with chronic spinal cord injury. This recovery involved a reduction in neuronal activity in the lumbar spinal cord of humans during walking. We hypothesized that this unexpected reduction reflects activity-dependent selection of specific neuronal subpopulations that become essential for a patient to walk after spinal cord injury. To identify these putative neurons, we modelled the technological and therapeutic features underlying EESREHAB in mice. We applied single-nucleus RNA sequencing6-9 and spatial transcriptomics10,11 to the spinal cords of these mice to chart a spatially resolved molecular atlas of recovery from paralysis. We then employed cell type12,13 and spatial prioritization to identify the neurons involved in the recovery of walking. A single population of excitatory interneurons nested within intermediate laminae emerged. Although these neurons are not required for walking before spinal cord injury, we demonstrate that they are essential for the recovery of walking with EES following spinal cord injury. Augmenting the activity of these neurons phenocopied the recovery of walking enabled by EESREHAB, whereas ablating them prevented the recovery of walking that occurs spontaneously after moderate spinal cord injury. We thus identified a recovery-organizing neuronal subpopulation that is necessary and sufficient to regain walking after paralysis. Moreover, our methodology establishes a framework for using molecular cartography to identify the neurons that produce complex behaviours."

Therapies to prevent disease relapse remain an unmet medical need. Here we uncover the identity and features of the residual tumour cells responsible for CRC relapse. An analysis of single-cell transcriptomes of samples from patients with CRC revealed that the majority of genes associated with a poor prognosis are expressed by a unique tumour cell population that we named high-relapse cells (HRCs). We established a human-like mouse model of microsatellite-stable CRC that undergoes metastatic relapse after surgical resection of the primary tumour. Residual HRCs occult in mouse livers after primary CRC surgery gave rise to multiple cell types over time, including LGR5+ stem-like tumour cells2–4, and caused overt metastatic disease. Using Emp1 (encoding epithelial membrane protein 1) as a marker gene for HRCs, we tracked and selectively eliminated this cell population. Genetic ablation of EMP1high cells prevented metastatic recurrence and mice remained disease-free after surgery. We also found that HRC-rich micrometastases were infiltrated with T cells, yet became progressively immune-excluded during outgrowth. Treatment with neoadjuvant immunotherapy eliminated residual metastatic cells and prevented mice from relapsing after surgery. Together, our findings reveal the cell-state dynamics of residual disease in CRC and anticipate that therapies targeting HRCs may help to avoid metastatic relapse. A poor prognosis gene programme in patients with colorectal cancer is expressed by a unique tumour cell population that we name high-relapse cells (HRCs), and ablation of cells expressing the HRC marker EMP1 or neoadjuvant immunotherapy prevented metastatic recurrence in mice."
https://openalex.org/W4308620632,"Expanding our global testing capacity is critical to preventing and containing pandemics1–9. Accordingly, accessible and adaptable automated platforms that in decentralized settings perform nucleic acid amplification tests resource-efficiently are required10–14. Pooled testing can be extremely efficient if the pooling strategy is based on local viral prevalence15–20; however, it requires automation, small sample volume handling and feedback not available in current bulky, capital-intensive liquid handling technologies21–29. Here we use a swarm of millimetre-sized magnets as mobile robotic agents (‘ferrobots’) for precise and robust handling of magnetized sample droplets and high-fidelity delivery of flexible workflows based on nucleic acid amplification tests to overcome these limitations. Within a palm-sized printed circuit board-based programmable platform, we demonstrated the myriad of laboratory-equivalent operations involved in pooled testing. These operations were guided by an introduced square matrix pooled testing algorithm to identify the samples from infected patients, while maximizing the testing efficiency. We applied this automated technology for the loop-mediated isothermal amplification and detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in clinical samples, in which the test results completely matched those obtained off-chip. This technology is easily manufacturable and distributable, and its adoption for viral testing could lead to a 10–300-fold reduction in reagent costs (depending on the viral prevalence) and three orders of magnitude reduction in instrumentation cost. Therefore, it is a promising solution to expand our testing capacity for pandemic preparedness and to reimagine the automated clinical laboratory of the future. A handheld printed circuit board-based programmable platform using ferrobots can perform the complex, laboratory-equivalent procedures involved in multiplexed and pooled nucleic acid amplification testing, allowing for the decentralization of viral diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W4308620642,"Ferroelectricity in atomically thin bilayer structures has been recently predicted1 and measured2,3,4 in two-dimensional materials with hexagonal non-centrosymmetric unit-cells. The crystal symmetry translates lateral shifts between parallel two-dimensional layers to sign changes in their out-of-plane electric polarization, a mechanism termed ‘slide-tronics’4. These observations have been restricted to switching between only two polarization states under low charge carrier densities5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12, limiting the practical application of the revealed phenomena13. To overcome these issues, one should explore the nature of polarization in multi-layered van der Waals stacks, how it is governed by intra- and interlayer charge redistribution and to what extent it survives the addition of mobile charge carriers14. To explore these questions, we conduct surface potential measurements of parallel WSe2 and MoS2 multi-layers with aligned and anti-aligned configurations of the polar interfaces. We find evenly spaced, nearly decoupled potential steps, indicating highly confined interfacial electric fields that provide a means to design multi-state ‘ladder-ferroelectrics’. Furthermore, we find that the internal polarization remains notable on electrostatic doping of mobile charge carrier densities as high as 1013 cm−2, with substantial in-plane conductivity. Using density functional theory calculations, we trace the extra charge redistribution in real and momentum spaces and identify an eventual doping-induced depolarization mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W4308705850,"According to the World Health Organization, pandemic fatigue poses a serious threat for managing COVID-19. Pandemic fatigue is characterized by progressive decline in adherence to social distancing (SDIS) guidelines, and is thought to be associated with pandemic-related emotional burnout. Little is known about the nature of pandemic fatigue; for example, it is unclear who is most likely to develop pandemic fatigue. We sought to evaluate this issue based on data from 5,812 American and Canadian adults recruited during the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Past-year decline in adherence to SDIS had a categorical latent structure according to Latent Class Analysis, consisting of a group adherent to SDIS (Class 1: 92% of the sample) and a group reporting a progressive decline in adherence to SDIS (i.e., pandemic fatigue; Class 2: 8% of the sample). Class 2, compared to Class 1, was associated with greater pandemic-related burnout, pessimism, and apathy about the COVID-19 pandemic. They also tended to be younger, perceived themselves to be more affluent, tended to have greater levels of narcissism, entitlement, and gregariousness, and were more likely to report having been previously infected with SARSCOV2, which they regarded as an exaggerated threat. People in Class 2 also self-reported higher levels of pandemic-related stress, anxiety, and depression, and described making active efforts at coping with SDIS restrictions, which they perceived as unnecessary and stressful. People in Class 1 generally reported that they engaged in SDIS for the benefit of themselves and their community, although 35% of this class also feared they would be publicly shamed if they did not comply with SDIS guidelines. The findings suggest that pandemic fatigue affects a substantial minority of people and even many SDIS-adherent people experience emotionally adverse effects (i.e., fear of being shamed). Implications for the future of SDIS are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W4308620574,"Over the past two decades, ice loss from the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) has increased owing to enhanced surface melting and ice discharge to the ocean1-5. Whether continuing increased ice loss will accelerate further, and by how much, remains contentious6-9. A main contributor to future ice loss is the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS), Greenland's largest basin and a prominent feature of fast-flowing ice that reaches the interior of the GrIS10-12. Owing to its topographic setting, this sector is vulnerable to rapid retreat, leading to unstable conditions similar to those in the marine-based setting of ice streams in Antarctica13-20. Here we show that extensive speed-up and thinning triggered by frontal changes in 2012 have already propagated more than 200 km inland. We use unique global navigation satellite system (GNSS) observations, combined with surface elevation changes and surface speeds obtained from satellite data, to select the correct basal conditions to be used in ice flow numerical models, which we then use for future simulations. Our model results indicate that this marine-based sector alone will contribute 13.5-15.5 mm sea-level rise by 2100 (equivalent to the contribution of the entire ice sheet over the past 50 years) and will cause precipitous changes in the coming century. This study shows that measurements of subtle changes in the ice speed and elevation inland help to constrain numerical models of the future mass balance and higher-end projections show better agreement with observations."
https://openalex.org/W4308706017,"When asked to decide if an ungrammatical sequence of words is grammatically correct or not readers find it more difficult to do so (longer response times (RTs) and more errors) if the ungrammatical sequence is created by transposing two words from a correct sentence (e.g., the white was cat big) compared with a set of matched ungrammatical sequences for which transposing any two words could not produce a correct sentence (e.g., the white was cat slowly). Here, we provide a further exploration of transposed-word effects while imposing serial reading by using rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) in Experiments 1 (respond at the end of the sequence) and 2 (respond as soon as possible-which could be during the sequence). Crucially, in Experiment 3 we compared performance under serial RSVP conditions with parallel presentation of the same stimuli for the same total duration and with the same group of participants. We found robust transposed-word effects in the RSVP conditions tested in all experiments, but only in error rates and not in RTs. This contrasts with the effects found in both errors and RTs in our prior work using parallel presentation, as well as the parallel presentation conditions tested in Experiment 3. We provide a tentative account of why, under conditions that impose a serial word-by-word reading strategy, transposed-word effects are only seen in error rates and not in RTs."
https://openalex.org/W4308705711,"Background Predicting patient’s Length of Stay (LOS) before total joint replacement (TJR) surgery is vital for hospitals to optimally manage costs and resources. Many hospitals including in rural areas use publicly available models such as National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) calculator which, unfortunately, performs suboptimally when predicting LOS for TJR procedures. Objective The objective of this research was to develop a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict LOS for TJR procedures performed at a Perioperative Surgical Home implemented rural community hospital for better accuracy and interpretation than the NSQIP calculator. Methods A total of 158 TJR patients were collected and analyzed from a rural community hospital located in Montana. A random forest (RF) model was used to predict patient’s LOS. For interpretation, permuted feature importance and partial dependence plot methods were used to identify the important variables and their relationship with the LOS. Results The root mean square error for the RF model (0.7) was lower than the NSQIP calculator (1.21). The five most important variables for predicting LOS were BMI, Duke Activity Status-Index, diabetes, patient’s household income, and patient’s age. Conclusion This pilot study is the first of its kind to develop an ML model to predict LOS for TJR procedures that were performed at a small-scale rural community hospital. This pilot study contributes an approach for rural hospitals, making them more independent by developing their own predictions instead of relying on public models."
https://openalex.org/W4308700984,"Objectives Gain insight into the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors of mental health problems among the Dutch general population and different age groups in November-December 2020, compared with the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors in the same period in 2018 and 2019. More specifically, the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors of anxiety and depression symptoms, sleep problems, fatigue, impaired functioning due to health problems, and use of medicines for sleep problems, medicines for anxiety and depression, and mental health service. Methods We extracted data from the Longitudinal Internet studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel that is based on a probability sample of the Dutch population of 16 years and older by Statistics Netherlands. We focused on three waves of the longitudinal Health module in November-December 2018 (T1), November-December 2019 (T2), and November-December 2020 (T3), and selected respondents who were 18 years and older at T1. In total, 4,064 respondents participated in all three surveys. Data were weighted using 16 demographics profiles of the Dutch adult population. The course of mental health problems was examined using generalized estimating equations (GEE) for longitudinal ordinal data and differences in incidence with logistic regression analyses. In both types of analyses, we controlled for sex, age, marital status, employment status, education level, and physical disease. Results Among the total study sample, no significant increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms, sleep problems, fatigue, impaired functioning due to health problems, use of medicines for sleep problems, of medicines for anxiety and depression, and of mental health service in November-December 2020 was observed, compared with the prevalence in November-December 2018 and 2019 (T3 did not differ from T1 and T2). Among the four different age categories (18–34, 35–49, 50–64, and 65 years old and older respondents), 50–64 years respondents had a significantly lower prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms at T3 than at T1 and T2, while the prevalence at T1 and T2 did not differ. A similar pattern among 65+ respondents was found for mental health service use. We found no indications that the incidence of examined health problems at T2 (no problems at T1, problems at T2) and T3 (no problems at T2, problems at T3) differed. Risk factors for mental health problems at T2 were mostly similar to risk factors at T3; sex and age were less/not a risk factor for sleep problems at T3 compared with at T2. Conclusions The prevalence, incidence, and risk factors of the examined mental health problems examined nine months after the COVID-19 outbreak appear to be very stable across the end of 2018, 2019, and 2020 among the Dutch adult population and different age categories, suggesting that the Dutch adult population in general is rather resilient given all disruptions due to this pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4308705991,"Current methods of the conversion between a rotation quaternion and Euler angles are either a complicated set of multiple sequence-specific implementations, or a complicated method relying on multiple matrix multiplications. In this paper a general formula is presented for extracting the Euler angles in any desired sequence from a unit quaternion. This is a direct method, in that no intermediate conversion step is required (no quaternion-to-rotation matrix conversion, for example) and it is general because it works with all 12 possible sequences of rotations. A closed formula was first developed for extracting angles in any of the 12 possible sequences, both ""Proper Euler angles"" and ""Tait-Bryan angles"". The resulting algorithm was compared with a popular implementation of the matrix-to-Euler angle algorithm, which involves a quaternion-to-matrix conversion in the first computational step. Lastly, a single-page pseudo-code implementation of this algorithm is presented, illustrating its conciseness and straightforward implementation. With an execution speed 30 times faster than the classical method, our algorithm can be of great interest in every aspect."
https://openalex.org/W4308705738,"To characterize species of viral mRNA transcripts generated during respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, human fibroblast-like MRC-5 lung cells were infected with subgroup A RSV for 6, 16 and 24 hours. In addition, we characterised the viral transcriptome in infected Calu-3 lung epithelial cells at 48 hours post infection. Total RNA was harvested and polyadenylated mRNA was enriched and sequenced by direct RNA sequencing using an Oxford nanopore device. This platform yielded over 450,000 direct mRNA transcript reads which were mapped to the viral genome and analysed to determine the relative mRNA levels of viral genes using our in-house ORF-centric pipeline. We examined the frequency of polycistronic readthrough mRNAs were generated and assessed the length of the polyadenylated tails for each group of transcripts. We show a general but non-linear decline in gene transcript abundance across the viral genome, as predicted by the model of RSV gene transcription. However, the decline in transcript abundance is not uniform. The polyadenylate tails generated by the viral polymerase are similar in length to those generated by the host polyadenylation machinery and broadly declined in length for most transcripts as the infection progressed. Finally, we observed that the steady state abundance of transcripts with very short polyadenylate tails less than 20 nucleotides is less for N, SH and G transcripts in both cell lines compared to NS1, NS2, P, M, F and M2 which may reflect differences in mRNA stability and/or translation rates within and between the cell lines."

Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the factors associated with real knowledge of COVID-19 among Ghanaians to promote effective dissemination of appropriate information aimed at containing the spread.A cross-sectional online survey and computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI) was conducted among Ghanaians aged 18 years and above across the 260 districts of Ghana. The survey assessed the level of knowledge of COVID-19 and its associated factors and compared differences between perceived and real knowledge. One district health promotion officer per district was trained for the data collection. Participants were recruited via use of phone directories of both organized and non-organized local district groups. Phone calls were made to randomly selected phone contacts to schedule options for participation in the study. We used multivariable logistic regression to investigate the associated factors of COVID-19 knowledge among respondents.Of the 2,721 participants who completed the survey, the majority (99.3%) were aware of the existence of the COVID-19 outbreak, had good knowledge on infection prevention (87.0%) and rated their knowledge about COVID-19 as good (81.7%). Factors associated with COVID-19 knowledge were: age ≥56 years (aOR = 0.5; CI: 0.3-0.8; p = 0.002), tertiary education (aOR = 1.8; CI: 1.2-2.6; p = 0.003), residing in Greater Accra region (aOR = 2.0; CI: 1.1-3.6; p = 0.019), not infected with the novel coronavirus (aOR = 1.5; Cl: 1.0-2.1; p = 0.045), knowing an infected person (aOR = 3.5; CI = 1.5-7.9; p = 0.003), good practice of effective preventive measures (aOR = 1.2: Cl: 1.1-1.5: 0.008), not misinformed (aOR = 0.7; Cl: 0.5-0.9; 0.015), and perceiving spreading speed of the virus as slow (aOR = 0.7; Cl: 0.5-0.9; 0.007).The study found good knowledge regarding COVID-19, control measures, and preventive strategies. The Ghana Health Service should continuously provide accurate information to educate the media and citizens to prevent misinformation, which is vital in stopping the spread of the COVID-19 virus."
https://openalex.org/W4308700782,"CT contrast media improves vessel visualization but can also confound calcification measurements. We evaluated variance in aorta attenuation from varied contrast-enhancement scans, and quantified expected plaque detection errors when thresholding for calcification.We measured aorta attenuation (AoHU) in central vessel regions from 10K abdominal CT scans and report AoHU relationships to contrast phase (non-contrast, arterial, venous, delayed), demographic variables (age, sex, weight), body location, and scan slice thickness. We also report expected plaque segmentation false-negative errors (plaque pixels misidentified as non-plaque pixels) and false-positive errors (vessel pixels falsely identified as plaque), comparing a uniform thresholding approach and a dynamic approach based on local mean/SD aorta attenuation.Females had higher AoHU than males in contrast-enhanced scans by 65/22/20 HU for arterial/venous/delayed phases (p &lt; 0.001) but not in non-contrast scans (p &gt; 0.05). Weight was negatively correlated with AoHU by 2.3HU/10kg but other predictors explained only small portions of intra-cohort variance (R2 &lt; 0.1 in contrast-enhanced scans). Average AoHU differed by contrast phase, but considerable overlap was seen between distributions. Increasing uniform plaque thresholds from 130HU to 200HU/300HU/400HU produces respective false-negative plaque content losses of 35%/60%/75% from all scans with corresponding false-positive errors in arterial-phase scans of 95%/60%/15%. Dynamic segmentation at 3SD above mean AoHU reduces false-positive errors to 0.13% and false-negative errors to 8%, 25%, and 70% in delayed, venous, and arterial scans, respectively.CT contrast produces heterogeneous aortic enhancements not readily determined by demographic or scan protocol factors. Uniform CT thresholds for calcified plaques incur high rates of pixel classification errors in contrast-enhanced scans which can be minimized using dynamic thresholds based on local aorta attenuation. Care should be taken to address these errors and sex-based biases in baseline attenuation when designing automatic calcification detection algorithms intended for broad use in contrast-enhanced CTs."
https://openalex.org/W4308705661,"This study explores whether and, if so, how efficiently consumers’ greenwashing (GW) influences green brand equity (GBE) by integrating the mediation role of green brand image (GBI), green satisfaction (GSA), and green trust (GTR) and the moderating role of green concern (GC), using the legitimacy and signaling theories. A quantitative study was conducted by means of a questionnaire-based survey using a cluster random sampling technique with a sample of 436 consumers who purchased electronic products in supermarkets in Vietnam. A partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) approach was used to analyze data. Our findings show that GW is not significantly associated with GBE, possibly due to the halo effect. The findings also show that GW is adversely related to GBI, GSA, and GTR, which would positively influence GBE, except for the GW-GSA relationship. This means that, although GW does not directly affect GBE, it does indirectly influence it via GBI and GTR. Furthermore, GC significantly moderates the relationship between GW and GBE. Our work is the first to combine GBI, GSA, and GTR as mediators, and GC as a moderator using PLS-SEM approach to advance the theory of green brand equity on green marketing and to contribute significantly toward a unified theory of brand equity. Furthermore, our findings extend our understanding regarding the different mechanisms for which GBI and GTR play as mediators, and with GC as a moderator in the GW-GBE relationship in the electronics products setting of Vietnamese consumers."
https://openalex.org/W4308705734,"The rising prevalence of multimorbidity poses challenges to health systems globally. The objectives of this study were to investigate: 1) the association between multimorbidity and depressive symptoms; and 2) whether social support plays a protective role in this association.A prospective population-based cohort study was conducted to analyze baseline and 3-year follow-up data of 16,729 community dwelling participants aged 65 and above in the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging (CLSA). Multimorbidity was defined as having three or more chronic conditions. The 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CESD-10) was used to measure depressive symptoms. The 19-item Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Social Support Survey was employed to assess perceived social support. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the association between multimorbidity, social support and depressive symptoms.Multimorbidity was very common among participants with a prevalence of 70.6%. Fifteen percent of participants had depressive symptoms at baseline. Multimorbidity was associated with increased odds of having depressive symptoms at 3-year follow-up (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.33, 1.71), and developing depressive symptoms by follow-up among those with no depressive symptoms at baseline (aOR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.42, 1.92). Social support was consistently associated with decreased odds of depressive symptoms, regardless of level of multimorbidity.Multimorbidity was positively associated with depressive symptoms over time, but social support served as a protective factor. As a modifiable, protective factor, emphasis should be placed in clinical practice to assess social support and refer patients to appropriate services, such as support groups. Similarly, health policy should focus on ensuring that older adults have access to social support opportunities as a way to promote mental health among older adults. Community organizations that offer social activities or support groups play a key role in this respect and should be adequately supported (e.g., with funding)."
https://openalex.org/W4308705920,"This study was to investigate the protective effect of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) on HT22 and PC12 cell damage caused by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion-induced ferroptosis. A 2-h oxygen-glucose deprivation and 24-h reperfusion model on HT22 and PC12 cells was used to simulate cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Cell viabilities were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) method. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid reactive oxygen species (Lipid ROS) were detected by fluorescent probes Dihydroethidium (DHE) and C11 BODIPY 581/591. Iron Colorimetric Assay Kit, malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) activity assay kits were used to detect intracellular iron ion, MDA and GSHcontent. Cell ferroptosis-related ultrastructures were visualized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, PCR and Western blot analyses were used to detect the expressions of ferroptosis-related genes and proteins. After receiving oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion, the viabilities of HT22 and PC12 cells were significantly decreased; ROS, Lipid ROS, iron ions and MDA accumulation occurred in the cells; GSH contents decreased; TEM showed that cells were ruptured and blebbed, mitochondria atrophied and became smaller, mitochondrial ridges were reduced or even disappeared, and apoptotic bodies appeared. And the expressions of Nrf2, SLC7A11 and GPX4 genes were reduced; the expressions of p-Nrf2/Nrf2, xCT and GPX4 proteins were reduced. Notably, these parameters were significantly reversed by HBO, indicating that HBO can protect HT22 cells and PC12 cells from damage caused by oxygen-glucosedeprivation/reperfusion via the inhibition of Nrf2/System Xc-/GPX4 axis-mediated ferroptosis."
https://openalex.org/W4308705956,"Low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth are leading causes of under-five and neonatal mortality globally. Data about the timing of death and outcomes for LBW and preterm births are limited in Ethiopia and could be used to strengthen neonatal healthcare. This study describes the incidence of neonatal mortality rates (NMR) stratified by newborn size at birth for gestational age and identifies its predictors at five public hospitals in Ethiopia.A prospective follow-up study enrolled 808 LBW neonates from March 2017 to February 2019. Sex-specific birthweight for gestational age percentile was constructed using Intergrowth 21st charts. Mortality patterns by birthweight for-gestational-age-specific survival curves were compared using the log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. A random-effects frailty survival model was employed to identify predictors of time to death.Among the 808 newborns, the birthweight distribution was 3.2% &lt;1000 g, 28.3% &lt;1500 g, and 68.1% &lt;2000 g, respectively. Birthweight for gestational age categories were 40.0% both preterm and small for gestational age (SGA), 20.4% term SGA, 35.4% appropriate weight for gestational age, and 4.2% large for gestational age (LGA). The sample included 242 deaths, of which 47.5% were both preterm and SGA. The incidence rate of mortality was 16.17/1000 (95% CI 14.26-18.34) neonatal-days of observation. Neonatal characteristics independently related to increased risk of time-to-death were male sex (adjusted hazards ratio [AHR] 3.21 95% CI 1.33-7.76), born preterm (AHR 8.56 95% CI 1.59-46.14), having been diagnosed with a complication (AHR 4.68 95% CI 1.49-14.76); some maternal characteristics and newborn care practices (like lack of effective KMC, AHR 3.54 95% CI 1.14-11.02) were also significantly associated with time-to-death.High mortality rates were measured for low birthweight neonates-especially those both preterm and SGA births-even in the context of tertiary care. These findings highlight the need for improved quality of neonatal care, especially for the smallest newborns."
https://openalex.org/W4308705995,"Background Conversion of sputum culture from positive to negative for M . tuberculosis is a key indicator of treatment response. An initial positive culture is a pre-requisite to observe conversion. Consequently, patients with a missing or negative initial culture are excluded from analyses of conversion outcomes. To identify the initial, or “baseline” culture, researchers must define a sample collection interval. An interval extending past treatment initiation can increase sample size but may introduce selection bias because patients without a positive pre-treatment culture must survive and remain in care to have a culture in the post-treatment interval. Methods We used simulated data and data from the endTB observational cohort to investigate the potential for bias when extending baseline culture intervals past treatment initiation. We evaluated bias in the proportion with six-month conversion. Results In simulation studies, the potential for bias depended on the proportion of patients missing a pre-treatment culture, proportion with conversion, proportion culture positive at treatment initiation, and proportion of patients missing a pre-treatment culture who would have been observed to be culture positive, had they had a culture. In observational data, the maximum potential for bias when reporting the proportion with conversion reached five percentage points in some sites. Conclusion Extending the allowable baseline interval past treatment initiation may introduce selection bias. If investigators choose to extend the baseline collection interval past treatment initiation, the proportion missing a pre-treatment culture and the number of deaths and losses to follow up during the post-treatment allowable interval should be clearly enumerated."
https://openalex.org/W4308708649,"This study presents the results of HPLC, a gentler and rapid separation method in comparison with the conventional ultracentrifugation, for 55 human serum samples. The elution patterns were analysed parametrically, and the attribute of each class was confirmed biochemically. Human samples contained 12 classes of lipoproteins, each of which may consist primarily of proteins. There are three classes of VLDLs. The level of each class was distributed lognormally, and the standard amount and the 95% range were estimated. Some lipoprotein classes with a narrow range could become ideal indicators of specific diseases. This lognormal character suggests that the levels are controlled by the synergy of multiple factors; multiple undesirable lifestyle habits may drastically increase the levels of specific lipoprotein classes. Lipoproteins in medical samples have been measured by enzymatic methods that coincide with conventional ultracentrifugation; however, the high gravity and time required for ultracentrifugation can cause sample degradation. Actually, the enzymatic methods measured the levels of several mixed classes. The targets of enzymatic methods have to be revised."

https://openalex.org/W4308700500,"Skeletal alterations in the head and neck region, such as midfacial hypoplasia, foramen magnum stenosis and spinal canal stenosis, are commonly observed in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS). However, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), one of the major treatment approaches for MPS, shows limited efficacy for skeletal conditions. In this study, we analysed the craniofacial morphology of mice with MPS type VII, and investigated the underlying mechanisms promoting jaw deformities in these animals. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), a potent endochondral ossification promoter, on growth impairment of the craniofacial region in MPS VII mice when administered alone or in combination with ERT. MPS VII mice exhibited midfacial hypoplasia caused by impaired endochondral ossification, and histological analysis revealed increased number of swelling cells in the resting zone of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis (SOS), an important growth centre for craniomaxillofacial skeletogenesis. We crossed MPS VII mice with transgenic mice in which CNP was expressed in the liver under the control of the human serum amyloid-P component promoter, resulting in elevated levels of circulatory CNP. The maxillofacial morphological abnormalities associated with MPS VII were ameliorated by CNP expression, and further prevented by a combination of CNP and ERT. Histological analysis showed that ERT decreased the swelling cell number, and CNP treatment increased the width of the proliferative and hypertrophic zones of the SOS. Furthermore, the foramen magnum and spinal stenoses observed in MPS VII mice were significantly alleviated by CNP and ERT combination. These results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of CNP, which can be used to enhance ERT outcome for MPS VII-associated head and neck abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W4308700505,"Taro is a valuable staple food crop among resource-poor rural people in countries such as Nigeria and Ghana, among others. Characterization of genetic diversity is a prerequisite for proper management of breeding programs and conservation of genetic resources. Two hundred seventy one taro accessions obtained from Nigeria and Vanuatu were genotyped using DArTseq-based SNP markers with the objectives of investigating the genetic diversity and population structure. In the analysis, 10,391 SNP markers were filtered from the sequence and used. The analysis revealed higher transition than transversion types of SNPs in the ratio of 1.43:1. The polymorphism ranged from 0.26 to 0.29 for the markers, indicating moderate genetic diversity. A model-based Bayesian clustering analysis of taro accessions yielded five subgroups and revealed the admixture situation in 19.19% of all accessions in the study. Vanuatu taro accessions exhibited more genetic diversity than Nigerian taro accessions. The population diversity estimate (PhiPt) was relatively higher (0.52) for accessions originating from Vanuatu than for Nigerian accessions. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that most variation existed among individuals within a population at 52%. Nei’s genetic distance showed that relatedness is based on geographical proximity. Collection of taro genetic resources should give more emphasis to within regions to utilize diversity in taro breeding program. This study also demonstrated the efficiency of DArTseq-based SNP genotyping for large-scale genome analysis in taro. The genotypic markers provided in this study are useful for association mapping studies."
https://openalex.org/W4308701383,"Background The risk of hospitalization or death after influenza infection is higher at the extremes of age and in individuals with comorbidities. We estimated the number of hospitalizations with influenza and characterized the cumulative risk of comorbidities and age on severe outcomes in Mexico and Brazil. Methods We used national hospital discharge data from Brazil (SIH/SUS) from 2010–2018 and Mexico (SAEH) from 2010–2017 to estimate the number of influenza admissions using ICD-10 discharge codes, stratified by age (0–4, 5–17, 18–49, 50–64, and ≥65 years). Duration of hospital stay, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and in-hospital case fatality rates (CFRs) defined the severe outcomes. Rates were compared between patients with or without pre-specified comorbidities and by age. Results A total of 327,572 admissions with influenza were recorded in Brazil and 20,613 in Mexico, with peaks period most years. In Brazil, the median hospital stay duration was 3.0 days (interquartile range, 2.0–5.0), ICU admission rate was 3.3% (95% CI, 3.2–3.3%), and in-hospital CFR was 4.6% (95% CI, 4.5–4.7). In Mexico, the median duration of stay was 5.0 days (interquartile range, 3.0–7.0), ICU admission rate was 1.8% (95% CI, 1.6–2.0%), and in-hospital CFR was 6.9% (95% CI, 6.5–7.2). In Brazil, ICU admission and in-hospital CFR were higher in adults aged ≥50 years and increased in the presence of comorbidities, especially cardiovascular disease. In Mexico, comorbidities increased the risk of ICU admission by 1.9 (95% CI, 1.0–3.5) and in-hospital CFR by 13.9 (95% CI, 8.4–22.9) in children 0–4 years. Conclusion The SIH/SUS and SAEH databases can be used to estimate hospital admissions with influenza, and the disease severity. Age and comorbidities, especially cardiovascular disease, are cumulatively associated with more severe outcomes, with differences between countries. This association should be further analyzed in prospective surveillance studies designed to support influenza vaccination strategy decisions."
https://openalex.org/W4308705701,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting the mental health of hospital workers. During the prolonged pandemic, hospital workers may experience much more severe psychological distress, leading to an increased risk of suicide. This study aimed to investigate changes in psychological effects on hospital workers over 12 months from the beginning of the pandemic and clarify factors associated with psychological distress and suicide-related ideation 1-year after the pandemic’s beginning. These repeated, cross-sectional surveys collected demographic, mental health, and stress-related data from workers in 2 hospitals in Yokohama, Japan. The first survey, conducted in March-April 2020, contained the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) assessing general distress and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) assessing event-related distress. In the second survey in March 2021, hospital workers at the same two hospitals were reassessed using the same questionnaire, and Item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was added to assess their suicide-related ideation. The findings of the first and second surveys revealed that the average score of GHQ-12 (3.08 and 3.73, respectively), the IES-R total score (6.8 and 12.12, respectively), and the prevalence rates of severe general distress (35.0% and 44.0%, respectively) and severe event-related distress (7.0% and 17.1%, respectively) deteriorated. The second survey showed that 8.6% of the hospital workers were experiencing suicide-related ideation. Both the general and event-related distress were associated with suicide-related ideation. In these surveys, mental health outcomes among the hospital workers deteriorated over one year from the pandemic’s beginning, and their severe psychological distress was the risk factor for the suicide-related ideation. Further studies are needed to compare the psychological effects on hospital workers during and after the prolonged pandemic and to explore appropriate measures to support hospital workers’ mental health."
https://openalex.org/W4308705736,"In mice, CD9 expression on the egg is required for efficient sperm-egg fusion and no effects on ovulation or male fertility are observed in CD9 null animals. Here we show that cd9b knockout zebrafish also appear to have fertility defects. In contrast to mice, fewer eggs were laid by cd9b knockout zebrafish pairs and, of the eggs laid, a lower percentage were fertilised. These effects could not be linked to primordial germ cell numbers or migration as these were not altered in the cd9b mutants. The decrease in egg numbers could be rescued by exchanging either cd9b knockout partner, male or female, for a wildtype partner. However, the fertilisation defect was only rescued by crossing a cd9b knockout female with a wildtype male. To exclude effects of mating behaviour we analysed clutch size and fertilisation using in vitro fertilisation techniques. Number of eggs and fertilisation rates were significantly reduced in the cd9b mutants suggesting the fertility defects are not solely due to courtship behaviours. Our results indicate that CD9 plays a more complex role in fish fertility than in mammals, with effects in both males and females."
https://openalex.org/W4308705746,"Poverty alleviation is a common cause for all human beings. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of financial poverty alleviation in 18 cities in Henan, China, and to explore the factors affecting the efficiency of financial poverty alleviation, so as to contribute new knowledge to the cause of poverty alleviation. Based on the relevant data of 18 cities in Henan, using output-oriented DEA model and Tobit regression model with bootstrap method, this study evaluates the efficiency of financial poverty alleviation in various cities in Henan, and explores the determinants of the efficiency of financial poverty alleviation. The results show that the overall poverty alleviation efficiency of Henan is high, and the financial poverty alleviation efficiencies of different cities show distinct heterogeneities. The efficiencies of financial poverty alleviation in Zhengzhou and Luoyang are 1, and there are different spaces for improvement in the efficiency of financial poverty alleviation in other cities. Financial subsidies are the most important positive factors affecting the efficiency of financial poverty alleviation. For every 1% increase in the value of financial subsidies, the poverty alleviation efficiency will increase by 0.213%. The urban-rural dualistic economic structure is negatively correlated with the efficiency of financial poverty alleviation. Every 1% increase in the value of the urban-rural dualistic economic structure will reduce the poverty alleviation efficiency by 0.11%. Industrial structure is positively related to the efficiency of financial poverty alleviation. For every 1% increase in the value of the industrial structure, the poverty alleviation efficiency will increase by 0.072%. The formulation of financial poverty alleviation policies in various regions should be combined with their own characteristics, and promote the efficiency of financial poverty alleviation by strengthening the advantages and making up for the deficiencies."
https://openalex.org/W4308705847,"Low back pain (LBP) is an important condition associated with high healthcare burden. However, the relationship of this condition with physical function (PF) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) remains unclear. This is a cross-sectional study that aims to investigate the association between presence and intensity of non-chronic LBP with PF and HRQoL in middle-and older-aged adults. Participants answered questions about presence and intensity of LBP in the previous year, self-reported their PF and HRQoL (SF-12), and underwent objective measures of PF ([ExSPPB] including usual gait speed, narrow walk, chair stands, and standing balance), endurance performance ([EP] long-distance corridor walk) and fatigability. Generalized linear models and logistic regression models were performed. A total of 1500 participants (52.5% women, 70.3% white) aged 69.0 (SD 13.1) years were included. Of those, 642 (42.8%) reported LBP and the mean pain intensity was 4.1 (SD 2.2). After adjustments for potential confounders, presence of LBP was associated with lower self-reported PF (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.37), lower physical component of HRQoL (β -0.03, 95% CI -0.04 to -0.02) and poorer chair stand performance (β -0.05, 95% CI -0.09 to -0.008). Higher intensity of LBP was associated with lower physical component of HRQoL (β -0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to -0.007), poorer ExSPPB performance (β -0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to -0.004), slower usual gait speed (β -0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to -0.004), lower total standing balance time (β -0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to -0.001) and higher fatigability (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.25). The presence of non-chronic LBP was more consistently associated with lower self-reported PF, while higher intensity non-chronic LBP was associated with poorer objectively measured PF and fatigability. Collectively, this evidence suggests that although presence of pain may affect perception of function, greater pain intensity appears more strongly associated with unfavorable functional performance in mid-to-late life."

A sample of 329 Turkish speakers of high socioeconomic status completed an online survey including measures of self-reported sarcasm use, personality traits, positive and negative affect, self-presentation styles, self-esteem, as well as age and gender. Participants who reported being more likely to use sarcasm in social situations had scores indicating that they were less agreeable, less conscientious, and less emotional stable (i.e., more neurotic). Also, those who reported using sarcasm more often tended to be younger and had lower self-esteem. Self-reported sarcasm use was also positively related to both the self-promoting and the self-depreciating presentation styles. In addition to highlighting the complex relationship between individual differences and language production, these findings underscore the importance of expanding sarcasm research to include non-Western samples."
https://openalex.org/W4308705989,"If several relatives died with no will, the order of their deaths could affect the inheritance result. When the order of death is unknown, there are three approaches to determine the inheritance result in this simultaneous death situation: apply an inheritance method that is not affected by the order of death; artificially assign the order of death; stipulate that persons with unknown orders do not inherit each other. The last approach is adopted by the current French Civil Code (denoted as the French Approach). We prove that under some basic requirements, the French Approach is the only valid solution to the order of death problem. Therefore, the inheritance law of a country that does not adopt the French Approach either has unsolvable inheritance problems or violates basic requirements. In the appendix, we study the existence and uniqueness of inheritance methods that are invariant for different orders of death and only violate one requirement, such as gender equality."
https://openalex.org/W4308705998,"Background Despite a considerable reduction in alcohol consumption, Russia has one of the highest levels of alcohol-attributable burden of disease worldwide due to heavy episodic drinking patterns. Further improvement of alcohol control measures, including early provision of screening and brief interventions (SBI), is needed. The legislative framework for delivering SBI in Russia was introduced in 2013. As part of the creation and validation of a Russian version of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), the present contribution explored challenges in using the AUDIT in Russia to inform a subsequent validation study of the tool. Methods Qualitative in-depth expert interviews with patients and healthcare professionals from four primary healthcare and narcology facilities in Moscow. A total of 25 patients were interviewed, 9 from a preventive medicine hospital, 8 from a polyclinic, and 9 from narcology clinics. Also, 12 healthcare professionals were interviewed, 5 of whom were primary healthcare doctors and 7 were narcologists. Results Patients and healthcare professionals expressed difficulties in dealing with the concept of a “standard drink” in the AUDIT, which is not used in Russia. Various patients struggled with understanding the meaning of “one drinking occasion” on the test, mainly because Russian drinking patterns center around festivities and special occasions with prolonged alcohol intake. Narcology patients had specific difficulties because many of them experienced zapoi– a dynamic drinking pattern with heavy use and a withdrawal from social life, followed by prolonged periods of abstinence. Surrogate alcohol use was described as a common marker of alcohol dependence in Russia, not accounted for in the AUDIT. Conclusions The provided analyses on the perception of the Russian AUDIT in different patient and professional groups suggest that a series of amendments in the test should be considered to capture the specific drinking pattern and its potential harms."

We aimed to study the relationship between prothrombin G20210A (PT20210) and factor V Leiden (FVL) mutations and the progression of fibrosis and liver function in chronic HCV patients. Methods The study included 100 subjects, 88 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis (compensated: 38, decompensated: 50), and 12 controls. Patients with other viral hepatitis or coinfection, inherited metabolic disease, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatic or extrahepatic malignancy, in addition to patients with causes of hypoalbuminemia, elevated bilirubin or prolonged INR not related to cirrhosis were excluded from the study. Relevant clinical data were collected and basic laboratory tests were performed. Liver fibrosis was assessed using APRI and FIB-4 scores. FVL and PT20210 mutations were analyzed. Results FVL and PT20210 mutations were significantly higher in decompensated vs. compensated patients (32% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.001; 20% vs. 5.3%, 0.043, respectively) and absent in controls. Both mutations significantly correlated to the duration of infection, platelet count and fibrosis scores. PT20210 mutation significantly correlated to serum albumin and INR. Both mutations significantly predicted fibrosis scores, especially PT20210 (AUROC: 0.833 for APRI and 0.895 for FIB-4). Conclusions Both mutations are significantly correlated to fibrosis progression and liver profile and could be considered as markers predicting the need for early and different intervention."
https://openalex.org/W4308706074,"The China-India border is the longest disputed border in the world. The countries went to war in 1962 and there have been recurring border skirmishes ever since. Reports of Chinese incursions into Indian territory are now a frequent occurrence. This rising tension between the world's most populous countries not only poses risks for global security and the world economy, but also has a negative impact on the unique ecology of the Himalayas, because of the expanding military infrastructure. We have assembled a unique data set of the dates and locations of the major incursions over the past 15 years. We find that the conflict can be separated into two independent conflicts, the western and eastern sectors. The incursions in these sectors are statistically independent. However, major incidents do lead to an increased tension that persists for years all along the entire Line of Actual Control (LAC). This leads us to conclude that an agreement on the exact location of a limited number of contested regions, such as the Doklam plateau on the China-Bhutan border, has the potential to significantly defuse the conflict, and could potentially settle the dispute at a further date. Building on insights from game theory, we find that the Chinese incursions in the west are strategically planned and may aim for a more permanent control over specific contested areas. This finding is in agreement with other studies into the expansionist strategy of the current Chinese government."

A formal description of autoencoders for explainable binary predictions is presented, along with two objective functions that allows for filtering and inverting negative examples during training. A methodology to model and transform complex medical event logs is also proposed, which keeps the pathway information in terms of events and time, as well as the hierarchy information carried in medical codes. A case study is presented, in which the short-term mortality after the implementation of an Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator is predicted. Proposed methodologies have been tested and compared to other predictive methods, both explainable and not explainable. Results show the competitiveness of the method in terms of performances, particularly the use of a Variational Auto Encoder with an inverse objective function. Finally, the explainability of the method has been demonstrated, allowing for the identification of interesting predictive factors validated using relative risks."
https://openalex.org/W4308700501,"Covid represents major changes in teaching across the world. This study examined some of those changes through tweets that contained threats and insulators to habitualization of newer teaching practices. The investigator harvested tweets to determine sentiment differences between teaching and schools and teaching and online. Topic modeling explored the topics in two separate corpora. Omnibus Yuen's robust bootstrapped t-tests tested for sentiment differences between the two corpora based on emotions such as fear, anger, disgust, etc. Qualitative responses voiced ideas of insulation and threats to teaching modalities institutionalized during the pandemic. The investigator found that 'teaching and school' was associated with higher anger, distrust, and negative emotions than 'teaching and online' corpus sets. Qualitative responses indicated support for online instruction, albeit complicated by topic modeling concerns with the modality. Some twitter responses criticized government actions as restrictive. The investigator concluded that insulation and threats towards habitualization and institutionalization of newer teaching modalities during covid are rich and sometimes at odds with each other, showing tension at times."

Among them, Lee-Carter method is one of the most influential method. In this paper, Lee-Carter method is applied to forecast mortality and life expectancy of Bangladesh. A functional data analysis approach is used to decompose the smoothed log-mortality rates in Lee-Carter framework for higher goodness-of-fit of the models and for longer forecast horizons. Bangladesh has been experiencing a mortality transition and has gained life expectancy in last few decades. The fitted model here showed higher pace of mortality decline for women in Bangladesh than that of men. The forecasts showed continuation of mortality improvement in long run and by 2060 life expectancy at birth is expected to reach over 80 years for both sexes in Bangladesh. The study also predicts the effect of reduction in infant mortality on the life expectancy in Bangladesh."

In this paper, we present evidence from what may be one of the most recent non-agricultural sites in the region, where a marine hunter-gatherer lifestyle may have continued until as late as the 15th–16th centuries AD. The isotope composition of incremental dental analysis suggests a significant, long-term dependence on seals. This indicates that vestiges of this means of subsistence might have been present in Europe for much longer than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W4308705666,"Background The performance of a clinical task depends on an individual’s skills, knowledge, and beliefs. However, there is no reliable and valid tool for measuring self-efficacy beliefs toward clinical skills in the Turkish language. This research work aims to study the linguistic equivalence, validity, and reliability of a Self-Efficacy Scale for Clinical Skills (L-SES). Materials and methods After reaching the original item pool of the scale, applying both forward and backward translation processes, and collecting responses of 11 experts from health professional sciences and educational sciences, the translation and adoption processes were completed. We randomly divided 651 medical students’ responses to a 15-item questionnaire into two datasets and conducted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) analyses. Results CFA validated the three-factor model, and the model fit indexes were found to have acceptable values. The item factor loads ranged from .34 to .84, and items in the scale explained 47% of the total variance. Cronbach’s alpha (.91), Spearman-Brown (.88), and Guttman Split-Half (.88) coefficients obtained within the scope of internal consistency reliability demonstrated that the scale had the desired internal consistency. Conclusion The Turkish version of the short and universal learning self-efficacy scale for clinical skills questionnaire is a valid and reliable scale for measuring medical students’ self-efficacy for clinical skills. Adopted questionnaires may have different factor structures when applied to two different cultures. We also discussed this issue as a hidden pattern in our study."

These sectors have to buy waxy maize from abroad because there is no waxy maize variety registered yet in Turkey. In vivo maternal haploid technique was applied to obtain doubled haploid (DH) waxy lines in a short time. RWS, RWK-76, and their hybrid RWS × RWK-76 maternal haploid inducers were used as male parents in vivo maternal haploid. SSRs markers were used to identify the genetic similarity between the number of 17 DH waxy lines. Similarity ratio ranged from 12% to 68% between DH waxy lines. DH waxy lines were used in crossbreeding and created 24 hybrids. Iodine tests were made on DH waxy lines and their hybrids and analyzed some quality parameters of hybrids. Candidate waxy hybrids were selected from the progeny nursery trial. Several 16 waxy and 3 check hybrids were experimented within three locations and the average grain yield of waxy and check hybrids ranged from 8.4-12.7 t/ha and 12.7-16.2 t/ha respectively. PCA biplot analysis using the data of the average of three locations and genotype × environment interaction was determined. PC1 and PC2 variation percentages were found to be 18.32% and 75.22%, respectively. ADAX-14, ADAX-13R, ADAX-13, and ADAX-19 waxy varieties are more stable in terms of yield than other hybrids.

https://openalex.org/W4308705750,"The Mediterranean Sea is a renowned biodiversity hotspot influenced by multiple interacting ecological and human forces. A gap analysis on the biology of Mediterranean marine fishes was conducted in 2017, revealing the most studied species and biological characteristics, as well as identifying knowledge gaps and areas of potential future research. Here, we updated this gap analysis five years later by reviewing the literature containing information on the same eight biological characteristics, namely length-weight relationships, growth, maximum age, mortality, spawning, maturity, fecundity and diet, for the 722 fish species of the Mediterranean Sea. The results revealed a considerable knowledge gap as 37% of the species had no information for any of the studied characteristics, while 13% had information on only one characteristic. Out of all the biological characteristics, the smallest knowledge gap was found in the length-weight relationships (studied for 51% of the species, mainly in the eastern Mediterranean), while the least studied characteristic was mortality (studied for 10% of the species). The western and eastern Mediterranean Sea were leading forces in data collection exhibiting the narrowest gaps between current and desired knowledge. The most studied species across the entire region were the highly commercial European hake (Merluccius merluccius), red mullet (Mullus barbatus), European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus), common pandora (Pagellus erythrinus), and annular seabream (Diplodus annularis). The knowledge gap has shrunk by 6% during the last five years, with 40 new species having at least one study on their biology. Moreover, research has slightly shifted towards species that have been traditionally neglected, e.g., sharks, rays and chimaeras (chondrichthyans). It is recommended that research becomes less focused on commercial species and more targeted towards the identified gaps, vulnerable species (e.g., deep-sea species and chondrichthyans) and species that could potentially pose a threat (e.g., non-indigenous species) to the ecosystems of the everchanging Mediterranean Sea."
https://openalex.org/W4308705825,"The use of head fixation has become routine in systems neuroscience. However, whether the behavior changes with head fixation, whether animals can learn aspects of a task while freely moving and transfer this knowledge to the head fixed condition, has not been examined in much detail. Here, we used a novel floating platform, the ""Air-Track"", which simulates free movement in a real-world environment to address the effect of head fixation and developed methods to accelerate training of behavioral tasks for head fixed mice. We trained mice in a Y maze two choice discrimination task. One group was trained while head fixed and compared to a separate group that was pre-trained while freely moving and then trained on the same task while head fixed. Pre-training significantly reduced the time needed to relearn the discrimination task while head fixed. Freely moving and head fixed mice displayed similar behavioral patterns, however, head fixation significantly slowed movement speed. The speed of movement in the head fixed mice depended on the weight of the platform. We conclude that home-cage pre-training improves learning performance of head fixed mice and that while head fixation obviously limits some aspects of movement, the patterns of behavior observed in head fixed and freely moving mice are similar."
https://openalex.org/W4308705921,"Transcriptional responses to adjuvanted vaccines can vary substantially among populations. Interindividual diversity in levels of pathogen exposure, and thus of cell-mediated immunological memory at baseline, may be an important determinant of population differences in vaccine responses. Adjuvant System AS01 is used in licensed or candidate vaccines for several diseases and populations, yet the impact of pre-existing immunity on its adjuvanticity remains to be elucidated. In this exploratory post-hoc analysis of clinical trial samples (clinicalTrials.gov: NCT01424501), we compared gene expression patterns elicited by two immunizations with the candidate tuberculosis (TB) vaccine M72/AS01, between three groups of individuals with different levels of memory responses to TB antigens before vaccination. Analyzed were one group of TB-disease-treated individuals, and two groups of TB-disease-naïve individuals who were (based on purified protein derivative [PPD] skin-test results) stratified into PPD-positive and PPD-negative groups. Although TB-disease-treated individuals displayed slightly stronger transcriptional responses after each vaccine dose, functional gene signatures were overall not distinctly different between groups. Considering the similarities with the signatures found previously for other AS01-adjuvanted vaccines, many features of the response appeared to be adjuvant-driven. Across groups, cell proliferation-related signals at 7 days post-dose 1 were associated with increased anti-M72 antibody response magnitudes. These early signals were stronger in the TB-disease-treated group as compared to both TB-disease-naïve groups. Interindividual homogeneity in gene expression levels was also higher for TB-disease-treated individuals post-dose 1, but increased in all groups post-dose 2 to attain similar levels between the three groups. Altogether, strong cell-mediated memory responses at baseline accelerated and amplified transcriptional responses to a single dose of this AS01-adjuvanted vaccine, resulting in more homogenous gene expression levels among the highly-primed individuals as compared to the disease-naïve individuals. However, after a second vaccination, response heterogeneity decreased and was similar across groups, irrespective of the degree of immune memory acquired at baseline. This information can support the design and analysis of future clinical trials evaluating AS01-adjuvanted vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W4308705987,"Approximately 10% non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) cases progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Liver biopsy, the gold standard for diagnosing NASH and associated liver fibrosis, is invasive with a risk of life-threatening complications. Therefore, reliable non-invasive biomarkers for predicting NASH are required to prevent unnecessary liver biopsies. We evaluated the performance of two non-invasive fibrosis markers, Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) and the FIB-4 index for predicting the fibrosis staging, NAFLD activity scoring (NAS) index, and NASH. We also analyzed the correlation between the two markers. The sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values (PPV), and negative predictive values of the FIB-4 index, M2BPGi, and a combination of both markers for NASH diagnosis were evaluated. The M2BPGi and FIB-4 index showed a good performance in diagnosing NASH, the fibrosis stage, and the NAS index in NAFLD patients. While both markers were well-correlated with each other in most cases, no correlation was found in some patients. Compared with the FIB-4 index or the M2BPGi alone, a combination of the two showed a higher specificity, PPV, and accuracy for NASH diagnosis. The M2BPGi and the FIB-4 index are easily accessible and reliable liver fibrosis markers. Diseases other than liver disease may cause dissociation between the two markers, causing failure to predict NASH. However, the combination of both markers can compensate for their disadvantages. Because the PPV of the combination was relatively high, patients who test positive for both markers should undergo liver biopsy for NASH diagnosis."

The majority of patients presenting in the cathlab however do not endure MACE over time, and identification of low-risk groups has remained underexposed. This study evaluates the combined prognostic value of SS, PB and LCBI in identifying patients with low MACE risk. This post-hoc analysis combines the ATHEROREMO and IBIS-3 studies and included 798 patients undergoing coronary angiography. Anatomical SS was calculated (N = 617) and ≥40mm non-stenotic segment of a non-target vessel was investigated with IVUS (N = 645) and NIRS (N = 273) to determine PB and maximum 4mm LCBI (LCBI 4mm ). During five-year follow-up, 191 MACE were observed. Patients with PB ≤70%, LCBI 4mm ≤227 (median), or SS ≤8 (median) had lower MACE incidence than their counterparts with higher values. Combined into one model, LCBI 4mm ≤227 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.30–0.78; p-value = 0.003) and SS ≤8 (aHR 0.67, 95%CI 0.48–0.96, p-value = 0.027) were independently associated with (lower) MACE rate, but PB was not. Additionally, negative predictive value (NPV) of this model was high (SS&lt;8: 0.80, PB&lt;70%: 0.77, LCBI 4mm &lt;227: 0.79). In this cohort, SS and LCBI 4mm proved to be independent predictors of MACE-free survival during five-year follow-up. Combination of SS and LCBI 4mm is useful to identify a low-risk population. Furthermore, NPV of SS, PB and LCBI 4mm for prediction of MACE is high."
https://openalex.org/W4308706018,"Many anticipated physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) applications in the near future are overground tasks such as walking assistance. For investigating the biomechanics of human movement during pHRI, this work presents Ophrie, a novel interactive robot dedicated for physical interaction tasks with a human in overground settings. Unique design requirements for pHRI were considered in implementing the one-arm mobile robot, such as the low output impedance and the ability to apply small interaction forces. The robot can measure the human arm stiffness, an important physical quantity that can reveal human biomechanics during overground pHRI, while the human walks alongside the robot. This robot is anticipated to enable novel pHRI experiments and advance our understanding of intuitive and effective overground pHRI."
https://openalex.org/W4308706069,"As our society ages and healthcare costs escalate, researchers and policymakers urgently seek potentially modifiable predictors of reduced healthcare utilization. We aimed to determine whether changes in 62 candidate predictors were associated with reduced frequency, and duration, of overnight hospitalizations. We used data from 11,374 participants in the Health and Retirement Study-a national sample of adults aged &gt;50 in the United States. Using generalized linear regression models with a lagged exposure-wide approach, we evaluated if changes in 62 predictors over four years (between t0;2006/2008 and t1;2010/2012) were associated with subsequent hospitalizations during the two years prior to t2 (2012-2014 (Cohort A) or 2014-2016 (Cohort B)). After robust covariate-adjustment, we observed that changes in some health behaviors (e.g., those engaging in frequent physical activity had 0.80 the rate of overnight hospital stays (95% CI [0.74, 0.87])), physical health conditions (e.g., those with cancer had 1.57 the rate of overnight hospital stays (95% CI [1.35, 1.82])), and psychosocial factors (e.g., those who helped friends/neighbors/relatives 100-199 hours/year had 0.73 the rate of overnight hospital stays (95% CI [0.63, 0.85])) were associated with subsequent hospitalizations. Findings for both the frequency, and duration, of hospitalizations were mostly similar. Changes in a number of diverse factors were associated with decreased frequency, and duration, of overnight hospitalizations. Notably, some psychosocial factors (e.g., informal helping) had effect sizes equivalent to or larger than some physical health conditions (e.g., diabetes) and health behaviors (e.g., smoking). These psychosocial factors are mostly modifiable and with further research could be novel intervention targets for reducing hospitalizations."
https://openalex.org/W4308708581,"Over 90% of Ethiopians still rely on solid fuels for cooking food. The pollution from the burning process causes adverse respiratory outcomes including respiratory infections. This study aimed to assess the association of the pollution with nasopharyngeal occurrence of potential pathogens.We conducted a comparative cross-sectional study in urban and rural settings in Ethiopia in 2016. Questionnaire-based data were collected from 168 mothers and 175 children aged below two years. Multiplex real-time PCR assays were performed on nasopharyngeal secretions for detection of bacteria and viruses and for the identification of pneumococcal serotypes/groups.High rates of bacteria and viruses in the nasopharynx were detected by PCR among both the children and the mothers. Among the detected viruses, enterovirus was more commonly detected among rural children than among children from urban areas. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were both more prevalent among children and mothers from rural areas compared with urban groups and among those using solid fuels compared with cleaner fuel users. Children from rural households using solid fuels and children whose mothers had educational status below high school had four times higher odds for detection of S. pneumoniae compared with those households using cleaner energy or those children having mothers with a higher educational status, respectively. One or more serotype/serogroup was identified in about 40% of the samples that were positive for pneumococci. Out of all identified serotypes/serogroups, 43% in the children and 45% in the mothers belonged to PCV13, indicating the larger majority of detected pneumococci being non-PCV13 serotypes.This study presented a high carriage rate of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae among both children and their mothers, especially in rural areas and among solid fuel users. Thus, interventions should target cleaner energy sources to the public and promote maternal education."
https://openalex.org/W4308708624,"The hydroclimate of South America is characterized by the South American summer monsoon (SASM), a tropical atmospheric circulation that induces a summer precipitation regime, and the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies (SHW), an extratropical atmospheric circulation that induces a winter precipitation regime. Stretched between these two systems is a NW-SE-oriented region dominated by descending air masses, resulting in the South American subtropical dry zone (SASDZ), also known as the arid diagonal. We investigated the Cerro Tuzgle cushion peatland (CTP) located on the Argentine Altiplano, north of the present-day SASDZ. Previous work revealed that the CTP was consistently in the SASM regime during the last 2900 cal yr BP. Here, we extend the CTP record to the middle Holocene covering the last 7200 cal yr BP to gain further knowledge of the Holocene development of the SASM and potential modulations of the SASDZ. The prominent feature of the entire record is a distinct and lasting transition centred around 3100 cal yr BP characterized by declining minerogenic content, increasing organic carbon content, rising stable carbon isotope values of organic matter and cellulose, and increasing stable oxygen isotope values of cellulose. We interpret this specific proxy pattern as a hydroclimatic transition towards less arid conditions at the CTP after 3100 cal yr BP. The transition corresponds with the end of the continuous Holocene strengthening of the SASM between 3500 cal yr BP and 3000 cal yr BP indicated by proxy records from north and east of the CTP. The CTP does not reflect this strengthening of the SASM and rather exhibits a threshold response indicating the effective establishment of the SASM summer precipitation regime at 24°S. This suggests that moisture supply during a more arid middle Holocene was provided by isotopically depleted precipitation, while moisture supply after the transition originated from isotopically enriched SASM summer precipitation. Concurrent hydroclimatic changes in the SHW winter precipitation regime south of the SASDZ are documented in a distinct lake level rise of Laguna Aculeo (33°50´S) around 3200 cal yr BP. These coinciding hydrological changes of the SASM and the SHW precipitation regimes indicate larger scale reorganisations of atmospheric circulation components, potentially connected to major modulations of the SASDZ. Thus, our CTP record sheds light on the middle to late Holocene development of the SASM at its southern limit and corroborates connections between the tropical and extratropical hydroclimate of South America."
