https://openalex.org/W3156155522,"Background In almost all lower and lower middle-income countries, the healthcare system is structured in the customary model of in-person or face to face model of care. With the current global COVID-19 pandemics, the usual health care service has been significantly altered in many aspects. Given the fragile health system and high number of immunocompromised populations in lower and lower-middle income countries, the economic impacts of COVID-19 are anticipated to be worse. In such scenarios, technological solutions like, Telemedicine which is defined as the delivery of healthcare service remotely using telecommunication technologies for exchange of medical information, diagnosis, consultation and treatment is critical. The aim of this study was to assess healthcare providers’ acceptance and preferred modality of telemedicine and factors thereof among health professionals working in Ethiopia. Methods A multi-centric online survey was conducted via social media platforms such as telegram channels, Facebook groups/pages and email during Jul 1- Sep 21, 2020. The questionnaire was adopted from previously validated model in low income setting. Internal consistency of items was assessed using Cronbach alpha (α), composite reliability (CR) and average variance extracted (AVE) to evaluate both discriminant and convergent validity of constructs. The extent of relationship among variables were evaluated by Structural equation modeling (SEM) using SPSS Amos version 23. Results From the expected 423 responses, 319 (75.4%) participants responded to the survey questionnaire during the data collection period. The majority of participants were male (78.1%), age &lt;30 (76.8%) and had less than five years of work experience (78.1%). The structural model result confirmed the hypothesis “self-efficacy has a significant positive effect on effort expectancy” with a standardized coefficient estimate (β) of 0.76 and p-value &lt;0.001. The result also indicated that self-efficacy, effort expectancy, performance expectancy, facilitating conditions and social influence have a significant direct effect on user’s attitude toward using telemedicine. User’s behavioral intention to use telemedicine was also influenced by effort expectancy and attitude. The model also ruled out that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions and social influence does not directly influence user’s intention to use telemedicine. The squared multiple correlations (r 2 ) value indicated that 57.1% of the variance in attitude toward using telemedicine and 63.6% of the variance in behavioral intention to use telemedicine is explained by the current structural model. Conclusion This study found that effort expectancy and attitude were significantly predictors of healthcare professionals’ acceptance of telemedicine. Attitude toward using telemedicine systems was also highly influenced by performance expectancy, self-efficacy and facilitating conditions. effort expectancy and attitude were also significant mediators in predicting users’ acceptance of telemedicine. In addition, mHealth approach was the most preferred modality of telemedicine and this opens an opportunity to integrate telemedicine systems in the health system during and post pandemic health services in low-income countries."
https://openalex.org/W3126120112,"Introduction Assessing the process used to synthesize the evidence in clinical practice guidelines enables users to determine the trustworthiness of the recommendations. Clinicians are increasingly dependent on guidelines to keep up with vast quantities of medical literature, and guidelines are followed to avoid malpractice suits. We aimed to assess whether systematic methods were used when synthesizing the evidence for guidelines; and to determine the type of review cited in support of recommendations. Methods Guidelines published in 2017 and 2018 were retrieved from the TRIP and Epistemonikos databases. We randomly sorted and sequentially screened clinical guidelines on all topics to select the first 50 that met our inclusion criteria. Our primary outcomes were the number of guidelines using either a systematic or non-systematic process to gather, assess, and synthesise evidence; and the numbers of recommendations within guidelines based on different types of evidence synthesis (systematic or non-systematic reviews). If a review was cited, we looked for evidence that it was critically appraised, and recorded which quality assessment tool was used. Finally, we examined the relation between the use of the GRADE approach, systematic review process, and type of funder. Results Of the 50 guidelines, 17 (34%) systematically synthesised the evidence to inform recommendations. These 17 guidelines clearly reported their objectives and eligibility criteria, conducted comprehensive search strategies, and assessed the quality of the studies. Of the 29/50 guidelines that included reviews, 6 (21%) assessed the risk of bias of the review. The quality of primary studies was reported in 30/50 (60%) guidelines. Conclusions High quality, systematic review products provide the best available evidence to inform guideline recommendations. Using non-systematic methods compromises the validity and reliability of the evidence used to inform guideline recommendations, leading to potentially misleading and untrustworthy results."
https://openalex.org/W3156631411,"Due to the sudden emergence of the novel coronavirus as a worldwide pandemic, this study aimed to evaluate the awareness and practices of both the Jordanian and Iraqi populations during the early stages of the pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between the 19 th and 22 nd of March to assess the public’s awareness toward COVID-19. Multiple scored domains were used to assess the differences between the two populations. Statistical analysis was conducted to reveal the influence of sociodemographic variables on these scores. A total of 3167 participants were recruited in the study, of which, 1599 (50.5%) were from Jordan and 1568 (49.5%) were from Iraq. More than half of the Jordanian (56.8%) and Iraqi participants (53.2%) showed average or adequate awareness about COVID-19. More than 60% of both populations relied on medical staff for COVID-19 related information. Social media was the second most common COVID-19 information source, as it was reported by 53.7% of Jordanian participants and 62.8% of Iraqi participants. More than 90% of both populations participated in precautionary measurements. Finally, about 20% of both populations failed to recognize droplet inhalation as a source of transmission. Despite the portrayed awareness levels, governmental involvement is warranted to increase the public’s awareness and fill the gaps within their knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W3154292860,"Over the past years, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were shown to contribute to states of acute and chronic inflammatory disease. They are composed of expelled chromatin and decorated by neutrophil-derived proteins. Therefore, the analysis of DNA complexes with myeloperoxidase (MPO) by ELISA has become an attractive tool to measure NET formation in in vitro and in vivo samples. When we used a published MPO-DNA ELISA protocol and included an isotype control for the anti-MPO coating antibody, we observed high assay specificity for in vitro prepared NET samples, whereas the specificity for in vivo plasma samples was low. In addition, the assay failed to detect in vitro generated MPO-DNA complexes when spiked into plasma. Therefore, we set out to improve the specificity of the MPO-DNA ELISA for plasma samples. We found that the use of Fab fragments or immunoglobulins from different species or reversal of the antibody pair led to either a high background or a low dynamic range of detection that did not improve the specificity for plasma samples. Also, the use of higher plasma dilutions or pre-clearing of plasma immunoglobulins were ineffective. Finally, we found that a commercial reagent designed to block human anti-mouse antibodies and multivalent substances increased the detection window between the MPO antibody and isotype control for highly diluted plasma. We applied this modified ELISA protocol to analyze MPO-DNA complexes in human blood samples of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. While markers of neutrophil activation and NET formation such as MPO, elastase and citrullinated histone H3 correlated significantly, we observed no correlation with the levels of MPO-DNA complexes. Therefore, we conclude that ELISA measurements of MPO-DNA complexes in human plasma are highly questionable regarding specificity of NET detection. In general, plasma analyses by ELISA should more frequently include isotype controls for antibodies to demonstrate target specificity."
https://openalex.org/W3153057760,"Falls are a major public health issue not only for older adults but also young adults, with fall-related injuries occurring more frequently in adult females than males. However, the sex differences in the frequency and circumstances of falls in young adults are understudied. This research quantified the frequency and circumstances of falls as a function of sex, physical activity, and prescription medications in young adults. For 16 weeks, young adult participants (N = 325; 89 males; 19.9±1.1 years) responded to a daily email asking if they had slipped, tripped, or fallen in the past 24 hours. Falls and fall-related injuries were not uncommon in young adults: 48% fell at least once, 25% fell more than once, and 10% reported an injury. The most common activities at the time of the fall for females were walking (44%) and sports (33%), and for males, sports (49%) and walking (37%). A zero-inflated Poisson model revealed that higher number of falls were associated with the following: higher levels of physical activity ( p = 0.025), higher numbers of medications ( p &lt;0.0001), and being male ( p = 0.008). Regarding circumstances of falling, females were more likely to be talking to a friend at the time of the fall (OR (95% CI): 0.35 (0.14–0.73); p = 0.01). For slips and trips without a fall, males and females reported the same number of slips (OR (95% CI): 0.885 (0.638–1.227) p = 0.46), but females reported more trips (OR (95% CI): 0.45 (0.30–0.67); p &lt;0.01). Only females reported serious injuries such as concussion and fracture. In conclusion, the rate of falls in young adults was affected by physical activity levels, number of medications, and sex. Quantifying and understanding these differences leads to increased knowledge of falls across the lifespan and is instrumental in developing interventions to prevent falls."
https://openalex.org/W3153301199,"Background Walking speed is often used in the clinic to assess the level of gait impairment following stroke. Nonetheless, post-stroke individuals may employ the same walking speed but at a distinct movement quality. The main objective of this study was to explore a novel movement quality metric, the estimation of gait smoothness by the spectral arc length (SPARC), in individuals with a chronic stroke displaying mild/moderate or severe motor impairment while walking in an outdoor environment. Also, to quantify the correlation between SPARC, gait speed, motor impairment, and lower limb spasticity focused on understanding the relationship between the movement smoothness metric and common clinical assessments. Methods Thirty-two individuals with a chronic stroke and 32 control subjects participated in this study. The 10 meters walking test (10 MWT) was performed at the self-selected speed in an outdoor environment. The 10 MWT was instrumented with an inertial measurement unit system (IMU), which afforded the extraction of trunk angular velocities (yaw, roll, and pitch) and subsequent SPARC calculation. Results Movement smoothness was not influenced by gait speed in the control group, indicating that SPARC may constitute an additional and independent metric in the gait assessment. Individuals with a chronic stroke displayed reduced smoothness in the yaw and roll angular velocities (lower SPARC) compared with the control group. Also, severely impaired participants presented greater variability in smoothness along the 10 MWT. In the stroke group, a smoother gait in the pitch angular velocity was correlated with lower limb spasticity, likely indicating adaptive use of spasticity to maintain the pendular walking mechanics. Conversely, reduced smoothness in the roll angular velocity was related to pronounced spasticity. Conclusions Individuals with a chronic stroke displayed reduced smoothness in the yaw and roll angular velocities while walking in an outdoor environment. The quantification of gait smoothness using the SPARC metric may represent an additional outcome in clinical assessments of gait in individuals with a chronic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W3155634054,"Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) are one of the key technologies in soft robotics, and they enable actuation in mobile robots, in wearable devices and exoskeletons for assistive and rehabilitative purposes. While they recently showed relevant improvements, they still present quite low payload, limited bandwidth, and lack of repeatability, controllability and robustness. Vacuum-based actuation has been recently demonstrated as a very promising solution, and many challenges are still open, like generating at the same time a large contraction ratio, and a high blocking force with enhanced axial stiffness. In this paper, a novel Ultralight Hybrid PAM (UH-PAM), based on bellow-type elastomeric skin and vacuum actuation, is presented. In particular, open-cell foam is exploited as a structural backbone, together with plastic rings, all embedded in a thin skin. The design and optimization combine numerical, analytical, and experimental data. Both static and dynamic analysis are performed. The weight of the optimized actuator is only 20 g. Nevertheless, a contraction ratio up to 50% and a maximum payload of 3 kg can be achieved. From a dynamic point of view, a rise time of 0.5 s for the contraction phase is observed. Although hysteresis is significant when using the whole contraction span, it can be reduced (down to 11.5%) by tuning both the vacuum range and the operating frequency for cyclic movements. Finally, to demonstrate the potentiality of this soft actuation approach, a 3 DoFs Stewart platform is built. The feasibility of performing smooth movements by exploiting open-loop control is shown through simple and more complex handwriting figures projected on the XY plane."
https://openalex.org/W3156062736,"Smokeless tobacco (SLT) use is associated with multiple adverse health effects. It is prominent in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, but disparities in use within and across these countries are not well documented or understood. This study assessed the prevalence, patterns, and correlates of SLT use in these three countries.Data came from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey, a household survey of adults aged ≥15 years. Data were collected in 2014 (Pakistan), 2017 (Bangladesh), and India (2016-2017). Current SLT use (nasal or oral use) was defined as reported SLT use daily or less than daily at the time of the survey. Prevalence of both overall and specific SLT types were assessed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess correlates of SLT use.Overall, SLT use among adults ≥15 years of age was 20.6% in Bangladesh, 21.4% in India, and 7.7% in Pakistan, corresponding to 22.0 million SLT users in Bangladesh, 199.4 million in India, and 9.6 million in Pakistan. Among current tobacco users overall, the percentage of those who used SLT was 58.4% (CI: 56.0-60.7) in Bangladesh, 74.7% (CI: 73.4-76.0) in India, and 40.3% (CI: 36.2-44.5) in Pakistan. The most commonly used oral SLT product was Zarda (14.5%) in Bangladesh, Khaini (11.2%) in India, and Naswar (5.1%) in Pakistan. Females had greater odds of SLT use than males in Bangladesh, but lower odds of SLT use than males in India and Pakistan. In all three countries, the odds of SLT use was higher among those 25 years and older, lower education, lower wealth index, and greater exposure to SLT marketing.An estimated 231 million adults aged 15 years or older currently use SLT in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, comprising 40.3%-74.7% of overall tobacco product use in these countries. Moreover, marked variations in SLT use exist by population groups. Furthermore, exposure to pro-SLT marketing was found to be associated with higher SLT use compared to non-exposed. It is important that tobacco control strategies address all forms of tobacco product use, including SLT."
https://openalex.org/W3156463194,"Currently, one of the most important challenges is to provide sufficient and affordable food and energy for a fast-growing world population, alongside preserving natural habitats and maintaining biodiversity. About 35% of the global food production depends on animals for pollination. In recent years, an alarming worldwide decline in pollinators has been reported, putting our food production under additional pressure. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find sustainable ways to ensure this crucial ecosystem service. Recent studies have shown that floral nectar is generally colonized by microorganisms, specifically yeasts and bacteria, which may alter nectar chemistry and enhance attraction of pollinators. In this study, we investigated changes in pollinator foraging behavior and pollination success in European pear ( Pyrus communis L.) cultivars ‘Regal Red’ and ‘Sweet Sensation’ (red sports of ‘Doyenné de Comice’) after flower inoculation with the typical nectar-inhabiting microorganisms Metschnikowia reukaufii and Acinetobacter nectaris , and a combination of both. Pollination success was monitored by measuring the number of flower visits, fruit set and seed set in two consecutive years, 2019 and 2020. Results revealed that application of a mixture of M . reukaufii and A . nectaris resulted in significantly higher visitation rates of honeybees and hoverflies. By contrast, no effects on flower visits were found when yeasts and bacteria were applied separately. Fruit set and seed set were not significantly affected by any of the inoculation treatments. The only factors affecting fruit set were initial number of flower clusters on the trees and the year. The absence of treatment effects can most likely be attributed to the fact that pollination was not a limiting factor for fruit set in our experiments. Altogether, our results show that inoculation of flowers with nectar microbes can modify pollinator foraging patterns, but did not lead to increased pollination success under the conditions tested."
https://openalex.org/W3122276074,"The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed multiple public health, socio-economic, and institutional crises. Measures taken to slow the spread of the virus have fostered significant strain between authorities and citizens, leading to waves of social unrest and anti-government demonstrations. We study the temporal nature of pandemic-related disorder events as tallied by the ""COVID-19 Disorder Tracker"" initiative by focusing on the three countries with the largest number of incidents, India, Israel, and Mexico. By fitting Poisson and Hawkes processes to the stream of data, we find that disorder events are inter-dependent and self-excite in all three countries. Geographic clustering confirms these features at the subnational level, indicating that nationwide disorders emerge as the convergence of meso-scale patterns of self-excitation. Considerable diversity is observed among countries when computing correlations of events between subnational clusters; these are discussed in the context of specific political, societal and geographic characteristics. Israel, the most territorially compact and where large scale protests were coordinated in response to government lockdowns, displays the largest reactivity and the shortest period of influence following an event, as well as the strongest nationwide synchrony. In Mexico, where complete lockdown orders were never mandated, reactivity and nationwide synchrony are lowest. Our work highlights the need for authorities to promote local information campaigns to ensure that livelihoods and virus containment policies are not perceived as mutually exclusive."
https://openalex.org/W3152927785,"Background Although adolescents are highly vulnerable to mental health challenges, they receive little attention, especially in developing countries. We investigated the mental health difficulties (MHDs) faced by adolescent students in four senior high schools in Ghana, their coping strategies and support systems. Methods In this convergent mixed-methods study, quantitative data was obtained using validated strengths and difficulties questionnaire to assess the mental health of 405 adolescents. Qualitative data was collected through in-depth interview with 18 teachers and seven focused group discussions with 35 students. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) for MHDs were estimated through ordinal logistic regression in Stata 14.2. Qualitative data was analyzed inductively and deductively using ATLAS.ti 7.1. Results Over half (58.5%) experienced peer (20.5%), emotional (16.3%), conduct (13.3%) and hyperactivity (3.0%) problems, whereas 5.4% exhibited prosocial behaviours. MHDs were associated with females (OR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.47–3.50), bullying (OR = 1.72, CI: 1.07–2.75), domestic violence (OR = 1.87, CI: 1.10–3.17), substance abuse (OR = 8.14, CI: 1.41–46.8), academic pressure (OR = 2.40, CI: 1.30–4.42) and self-perceived poor school performance (OR = 7.36 CI: 2.83–19.16). Qualitatively, we identified financial challenges, spiritual influences, intimate relationships, bullying, and domestic violence as the main themes attributed to MHDs. Coping strategies included isolation, substance use and spiritual help. The main school-based support system was the guidance and counselling unit, but there were complaints of it been ineffective due to trust and confidentially issues, and non-engagement of qualified counsellors. Conclusions As many triggers of MHDs emanate in schools, we need mental health-friendly school environments where trained psychotherapists head counselling centres. We propose incorporating mental health education into school curricula and generating surveillance data on adolescent’s mental health."
https://openalex.org/W3156317697,"Prior research showed that there is a growing consensus among researchers, which point out a key role of external knowledge sources such as external R&amp;D and technologies in enhancing firms´ innovation. However, firms´ from catching-up Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries have already shown in the past that their innovation models differ from those applied, for example, in Western Europe. This study therefore introduces a novel two-staged model combining artificial neural networks and random forests to reveal the importance of internal and external factors influencing firms´ innovation performance in the case of 3,361 firms from six catching-up CEE countries (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), by using the World Banks´ Enterprise Survey data from 2019. We confirm the hypothesis that innovators in the catching-up CEE countries depend more on internal knowledge sources and, moreover, that participation in the firms groups represents an important factor of firms´ innovation. Surprisingly, we reject the hypothesis that foreign technologies are a crucial source of external knowledge. This study contributes to the theories of open innovation and absorptive capacity in the context of selected CEE countries and provides several practical implications for firms."
https://openalex.org/W3152586863,"Adolescents and young people globally are highly vulnerable to poor mental health especially depression, and they account for 36% of new HIV infections in Eastern and Southern Africa. HIV services remain inadequate for this population and their adherence to ART is low. The Friendship Bench (FB), an evidence-based model developed in Zimbabwe to bridge the mental health gap, is a brief psychological intervention delivered on benches in primary care facilities by lay health workers (""grandmothers"") trained in problem-solving therapy. This study explored the experience of young people living with HIV attending FB, and their perception of how problem-solving therapy impacted their adherence to ART.Semi-structured interviews were conducted in July 2019 with 10 young people living with HIV aged 18-24 years, who had recently completed FB counselling in Harare. Participants were purposively sampled and recruited from three primary care facilities. Interviews were conducted in Shona, audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and translated into English. Transcripts were analysed in NVivo12 using inductive thematic analysis.Study findings revealed a clear emotional denial towards HIV, particularly for young people infected perinatally, and a resulting low adherence to ART. The study also unpacked the issues of internal stigma and how young people living with perinatally acquired HIV are informed of their HIV status. Participants reported that FB had a critical role in helping them accept their HIV status. Grandmothers' empathic attitude was key during counselling on adherence to ART, to demystify the disease and treatment, normalize the reality of living with HIV, encourage young people to socialize with peers and free them of guilt. Interviewees unanimously reported improved ART adherence following FB counselling, and many described enhanced health and wellbeing.Participants saw FB as a strong contributor to their general well-being, evident in decreased symptoms of depression and improved adherence to ART. FB problem-solving therapy should be rolled out to further support young people after post-test counselling or HIV serostatus disclosure for perinatally acquired HIV, for acceptance of HIV status and adherence to ART."
https://openalex.org/W3153016485,"China’s rare earth export trade has developed so rapidly since 1990s that China has gradually occupied a leading position in the international market. However, this fast development was proceeding at the cost of the rare earth energy consumption and environmental devastation. Now China begins to attach great importance to environmental protection, which attracts many researchers. This study aims to analyze the influence of environmental regulation on China’s rare earth export trade. And the original study is amongst the few to examine the relationship between environmental regulation and China’s rare earth export with the product-level data. Different from previous studies, this paper selects China’s rare earth export data from 1995 to 2015 and introduces product heterogeneity based on the rare earth production process. Moreover, this study uses the entropy weight method to measure the intensity of environmental regulation. The core conclusions are as follows: (1) Environmental regulation significantly promotes rather than restrains China’s rare earth export. (2) According to the rare earth production process, this paper divides rare earth products into 3 kinds, that is, rare earth raw materials, rare earth useful components and rare earth end-use applications. Then, it is found that rare earth useful component export in processing and smelting is positively affected by environmental regulation. Rare earth raw materials and end-use applications in China’s export are hardly affected. (3) Technological innovation has a mediating effect on the impact mechanism of environmental regulation on China’s rare earth export, which means that environmental regulation significantly promotes technological innovation of enterprises, and thereby the rare earth export is increased. The findings are helpful for policymakers to resolve the issue of environmental devastation."
https://openalex.org/W3153502293,"Insights from biome-wide experiments can improve efficacy of landscape-scale ecological restoration projects. Such insights enable implementers to set temporal and geographical benchmarks and to identify key drivers of success during the often decades-long restoration trajectory. Here we report on a biome-wide experiment aimed at informing the ecological restoration of thousands of hectares of degraded subtropical thicket dominated by the succulent shrub, Portulacaria afra (spekboom). Restoration using spekboom truncheons has the potential to sequester, for a semi-arid region, large amounts of ecosystem carbon, while regenerating a host of associated ecosystem services. This study evaluates, after about three years post-propagation, the effects of spekboom truncheon size and treatment on survivorship in 40 fence-enclosed (0.25 ha) plots located in target habitat across the entire spekboom thicket biome. In each plot, locally harvested spekboom truncheons, comprising eight size/treatment combinations, were planted in replicated rows of between 24 and 49 individuals, depending on treatment. The experiment assessed the role of truncheon size, spacing, application of rooting hormone and watering at planting on survivorship percentage as an indicator of restoration success. All eight combinations recorded extreme minimum survivorship values of zero, while the range of extreme maximum values was 70-100%. Larger truncheons (&gt;22.5 mm diameter) had almost double the survivorship (ca. 45%) than smaller truncheons (&lt; 15 mm) (ca. 25%). Planting large, untreated truncheons at 1 m intervals—as opposed to 2 m intervals recommended in the current restoration protocol—resulted in no significant change in survivorship. The application of rooting hormone and water at planting had no significant effect on restoration success for both large and small truncheons. While our results do not provide an evidence base for changing the current spekboom planting protocol, we recommend research on the financial and economic costs and benefits of different propagation strategies in real-world contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3156092910,"Legionellosis is an infection acquired through inhalation of aerosols that are contaminated with environmental bacteria Legionella spp. The bacteria require warm temperature for proliferation in bodies of water and moist soil. The legionellosis incidence in the United States has been rising rapidly in the past two decades without a clear explanation. In the meantime, the US has recorded consecutive years of above-norm temperature since 1997 and precipitation surplus since 2008. The present study analyzed the legionellosis incidence in the US during the 20-year period of 1999 to 2018 and correlated with concurrent temperature, precipitation, solar ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, and vehicle mileage data. The age-adjusted legionellosis incidence rates rose exponentially from 0.40/100,000 in 1999 (with 1108 cases) to 2.69/100,000 in 2018 (with 9933 cases) at a calculated annual increase of 110%. In regression analyses, the rise correlated with an increase in vehicle miles driven and with temperature and precipitation levels that have been above the 1901–2000 mean since 1997 and 2008, respectively, suggesting more road exposure to traffic-generated aerosols and promotive effects of anomalous climate. Remarkably, the regressions with cumulative anomalies of temperature and precipitation were robust (R 2 ≥ 0.9145, P ≤ 4.7E-11), implying possible changes to microbial ecology in the terrestrial and aquatic environments. An interactive synergy between annual precipitation and vehicle miles was also found in multiple regressions. Meanwhile, the bactericidal UVB radiation has been decreasing, which also contributed to the rising incidence in an inverse correlation. The 2018 legionellosis incidence peak corresponded to cumulative effects of the climate anomalies, vast vehicle miles (3,240 billion miles, 15904 km per capita), record high precipitation (880.1 mm), near record low UVB radiation (7488 kJ/m 2 ), and continued above-norm temperature (11.96°C). These effects were examined and demonstrated in California, Florida, New Jersey, Ohio, and Wisconsin, states that represent diverse incidence rates and climates. The incidence and above-norm temperature both rose most in cold Wisconsin. These results suggest that warming temperature and precipitation surplus have likely elevated the density of Legionella bacteria in the environment, and together with road exposure explain the rapidly rising incidence of legionellosis in the United States. These trends are expected to continue, warranting further research and efforts to prevent infection."
https://openalex.org/W3156645707,"While a broad spectrum of technologies is integrated in everyday life and routines, most research on ageing, health and technology has focused on attitudes toward and adoption of digital technologies including e-health, or home based monitoring systems. The aim of this study was to explore differences and similarities in attitudes and experiences with different types of technologies and development within and between three generations. We applied a qualitative, descriptive design and recruited a purposeful sample of participants from three generations (30–39, 50–59, 70–79 year old). The 25 participants took part in 3 x 2 focus groups. Forming four categories, the findings show that technologies enable as well as complicate everyday life. Participants expressed trust as well as uncertainty about risks when using technology and stated that use of digital services is required while support is limited. They identified that technology development is inevitable but not always in the service of users. In conclusion, experiences of and attitudes towards technologies and technology development are not limited to generation; perspectives sometimes unite individuals across rather than within generations. Thus future technologies and technology development, as well as services and policies aiming to support the use of said technologies should consider individual user perspectives including needs, desires, beliefs or goals neglected in the existing technology models, and involve users beyond generations defined by chronological age. Such strategies are likely to be more successful in supporting development of technologies usable for all."
https://openalex.org/W3156993385,"Intestinal ischemia results in mucosal injury, including paracellular barrier loss due to disruption of tight junctions. Larazotide acetate (LA), a small peptide studied in Phase III clinical trials for treatment of celiac disease, regulates tight junctions (TJs). We hypothesized that LA would dose-dependently hasten recovery of intestinal ischemic injury via modulation of TJs. Ischemia-injured tissue from 6-8-week-old pigs was recovered in Ussing chambers for 240-minutes in the presence of LA. LA (1 μM but not 0.1 μM or 10 μM) significantly enhanced transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) above ischemic injured controls and significantly reduced serosal-to-mucosal flux LPS (P<0.05). LA (1 μM) enhanced localization of the sealing tight junction protein claudin-4 in repairing epithelium. To assess for the possibility of fragmentation of LA, an in vitro enzyme degradation assay using the brush border enzyme aminopeptidase M, revealed generation of peptide fragments. Western blot analysis of total protein isolated from uninjured and ischemia-injured porcine intestine showed aminopeptidase M enzyme presence in both tissue types, and mass spectrometry analysis of samples collected during ex vivo analysis confirmed formation of LA fragments. Treatment of tissues with LA fragments had no effect alone, but treatment with a fragment missing both amino-terminus glycines inhibited barrier recovery stimulated by 1 μM LA. To reduce potential LA inhibition by fragments, a D-amino acid analog of larazotide Analog #6, resulted in a significant recovery response at a 10-fold lower dose (0.1 μM) similar in magnitude to that of 1 μM LA. We conclude that LA stimulates repair of ischemic-injured epithelium at the level of the tight junctions, at an optimal dose of 1 μM LA. Higher doses were less effective because of inhibition by LA fragments, which could be subverted by chirally-modifying the molecule, or microdosing LA."

Setting Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database based in the United States. Patients Adult patients 18 years and older were included. Exclusion criteria comprised of patients who expired during their hospital stay or presented with overdose; patients with cancer, anoxic brain injury, non-prescription opioid use; or if an accurate medication reconciliation was unable to be obtained. Patients prescribed chronic opioids were compared with those who had not been prescribed opioids in the outpatient setting. Interventions None. Measurements and main results The final sample included a total of 22,385 patients, with 2,621 (11.7%) in the opioid group and 19,764 (88.3%) in the control group. After proceeding with bivariate analyses, statistically significant and clinically relevant differences were identified between opioid and non-opioid users in sex, length of hospital stay, and comorbidities. Opioid use was associated with increased mortality in both the 30-day and 1-year windows with a respective odds ratios of 1.81 (95% CI, 1.63–2.01; p&lt;0.001) and 1.88 (95% CI, 1.77–1.99; p&lt;0.001), respectively. Conclusions Chronic opioid usage was associated with increased hospital length of stay and increased mortality at both 30 days and 1 year after ICU admission. Knowledge of this will help providers make better choices in patient care and have a more informed risk-benefits discussion when prescribing opioids for chronic usage."
https://openalex.org/W3154109175,"Antimicrobials are included in commercial animal feed rations in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We measured antimicrobial use (AMU) in commercial feed products consumed by 338 small-scale chicken flocks in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam, before a gradual nationwide ban on prophylactic use of antimicrobials (including in commercial feeds) to be introduced in the country over the coming five years. We inspected the labels of commercial feeds and calculated amounts of antimicrobial active ingredients (AAIs) given to flocks. We framed these results in the context of overall AMU in chicken production, and highlighted those products that did not comply with Government regulations. Thirty-five of 99 (35.3%) different antimicrobial-containing feed products included at least one AAI. Eight different AAIs (avilamycin, bacitracin, chlortetracycline, colistin, enramycin, flavomycin, oxytetracycline, virginamycin) belonging to five classes were identified. Brooding feeds contained antimicrobials the most (60.0%), followed by grower (40.9%) and finisher feeds (20.0%). Quantitatively, chlortetracycline was consumed most (42.2 mg/kg SEM ±0.34; 50.0% of total use), followed by enramycin (18.4 mg/kg SEM ±0.03, 21.8%), bacitracin (16.4 mg/kg SEM ±0.20, 19.4%) and colistin (6.40 mg/kg SEM ± 4.21;7.6%). Other antimicrobials consumed were virgianamycin, avilamycin, flavomycin and oxytetracycline (each ≤0.50 mg/kg). Antimicrobials in commercial feeds were more commonly given to flocks in the earlier part of the production cycle. A total of 10 (9.3%) products were not compliant with existing Vietnamese regulation (06/2016/TT-BNNPTNT) either because they included a non-authorised AAI (4), had AAIs over the permitted limits (4), or both (2). A number of commercial feed formulations examined included colistin (polymyxin E), a critically important antimicrobial of highest priority for human medicine. These results illustrate the challenges for effective implementation and enforcement of restrictions of antimicrobials in commercial feeds in LMICs. Results from this study should help encourage discussion about policies on medicated feeds in LMICs."

However, only a few studies have focused on the prevalence of contamination by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and effectiveness of disinfection training to reduce. This study is to investigate the burden of stethoscope contamination with nosocomial pathogens and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and to analyze habit changes in disinfection of stethoscopes among healthcare workers (HCWs) before and after education and training. We performed a prospective pre and post quasi-experimental study. A total of 100 HCWs (55 doctors and 45 nurses) were recruited. HCWs were surveyed on their disinfection behavior and stethoscopes were cultured by pressing the diaphragm directly onto a blood agar plate before and after education on disinfection. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed to determine the relatedness of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae . Most of the stethoscopes were contaminated with microorganisms before and after the intervention (97.9% and 91.5%, respectively). The contamination rate of stethoscopes with nosocomial pathogens before and after education was 20.8% and 19.2%, respectively. Stethoscope disinfection habits improved (55.1% vs 31.0%; p &lt;0.001), and the overall bacterial loads of contamination were reduced (median colony-forming units, 15 vs 10; p = 0.019) after the intervention. However, the contamination rate by nosocomial pathogens and MDR bacteria did not decrease significantly. A carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from a stethoscope was closely related to isolates from the patients admitted at the same ward where the stethoscope was used. Stethoscopes were contaminated with various nosocomial pathogens including MDR bacteria and might act as a vehicle of MDR bacteria. Continuous, consistent education and training should be provided to HCWs using multifaceted approach to reduce the nosocomial transmission via stethoscopes."

Objective This study aims to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 admitted to Mercy Hospitals. Design and methods Retrospective, observational cohort study designed to include every COVID-19 subject aged 18 years or older admitted to Mercy Saint (St) Vincent, Mercy St Charles, and Mercy St Anne’s hospital in Toledo, Ohio from January 1, 2020 through June 15 th , 2020. Primary Outcome Measure was mortality in the emergency department or as an in-patient. Results 470 subjects including 224 males and 246 females met the inclusion criteria for the study. Subjects with the following characteristics had higher odds (OR) of death: Older age [OR 8.3 (95% CI 1.1–63.1, p = 0.04)] for subjects age 70 or more compared to subjects age 18–29); Hypertension [OR 3.6 (95% CI 1.6–7.8, p = 0.001)]; Diabetes [OR 3.1 (95% CI 1.7–5.6, p&lt;0.001)]; COPD [OR 3.4 (95% CI 1.8–6.3, p&lt;0.001)] and CKD stage 2 or greater [OR 2.5 (95% CI 1.3–4.9, p = 0.006)]. Combining all age groups, subjects with hypertension had significantly greater odds of the following adverse outcomes: requiring hospital admission (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4–3.4, p&lt;0.001); needing respiratory support in 24 hours (OR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.7–3.7, p&lt;0.001); ICU admission (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.7–4.4, p&lt;0.001); and death (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6–7.8, p = 0.001). Hypertension was not associated with needing vent in 24 hours (p = 0.07). Conclusion Age and hypertension were associated with significant comorbidity and mortality in Covid-19 Positive patients. Furthermore, people who were older than 70, and had hypertension, diabetes, COPD, or CKD had higher odds of dying from the disease as compared to patients who hadn’t. Subjects with hypertension also had significantly greater odds of other adverse outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3154408476,"Fresh mechanically deboned meat (MDM) is usually claimed as high-quality ingredient on dry pet food recipes and this aspect may positively influence consumer choice. It is important to determine the scientifically sustainability of this claim and to assess the microbiological safety of MDM inclusion in dry pet food. Objectives were: 1) to evaluate the effect of inclusion of MDM in dry dog food on fatty acid profile and in vivo and in vitro digestibility, proposing a new system (Daisy II Incubator) to measure the in vitro digestibility for dogs; 2) to compare palatability of dry dog food containing MDM with dry dog food in which meat by-products (MBP) are the only animal protein sources; 3) to determine, whether or not, the inclusion of that ingredient changes the microbiology and the storage quality. Results indicated that MDM product was characterized by significant higher nutritional value in terms of fatty acids profile, in vitro digestibility (HV-IVD method) and lower palatability than the MBP product. Microbiological risk assessment showed no microbiological hazards for either product. After 6-months storage, the total mesophilic bacterial count ranged between 1.77 and 2.09 log CFU/g feed, while polyamine values were higher in the MDM (0.37 g/kg) than in the MBP (0.27 g/kg). The Daisy II Incubator was found to be a valid instrument for studying in vitro digestibility also for dogs, providing data simply, quickly, with less variability and costs than in vivo trials. In conclusion, MDM inclusion in dry dog food is microbiologically safe and it can improve its nutritional quality, at the expense of a reduced palatability. The higher polyamine levels fount in MDM-enriched petfood after 6-months storage, however, may represent a possible hazard, and further studies are still warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3154977611,"Nitrogen deficiency and toxicity, primarily in its ammonium form (NH 4 + ), can suppress plant growth and development. The use of silicon (Si) or salicylic acid (SA) may be an alternative to minimize the harmful effects of nutrient imbalances caused by NH 4 + , thereby improving the photosynthetic efficiency of plants. The aim of the present study was to assess the action of fertigation-applied Si and SA foliar spraying in mitigating NH 4 + toxicity and deficiency in eucalyptus clonal seedlings. Two experiments were performed with eucalyptus clonal seedlings ( Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grandis ), in a greenhouse. Both were carried out using a 4x2 factorial design and four concentrations of NH 4 + (5, 15, 30 and 60 mmol L -1 ), in the absence and presence of Si (2 mmol L -1 ), in experiment I; or with and without SA foliar application (10 −2 mmol L -1 ), in experiment II, with six repetitions. Nitrogen content rose as a result of increasing N-NH 4 + concentration in the nutrient solution, and Si supplied via the nutrient solution was efficient in increasing the Si content in eucalyptus seedlings. The rise in N-NH 4 + concentration favored the maintenance of the photosynthetic apparatus, but high N-NH 4 + concentration increased energy loss through fluorescence and decreased the efficiency of photosystem II. The addition of Si to the nutrient solution proved to be beneficial to the photosynthetic apparatus by decreasing F 0 at 15 and 30 mmol L -1 of NH 4 + ; and F m at all NH 4 + concentrations studied. In addition, the beneficial element also increases F v /F m at all NH 4 + concentrations studied. SA foliar application was also efficient in reducing photosynthetic energy losses by decreasing F 0 and F m at all NH 4 + concentrations studied. However, SA only increased the F v /F m at the high concentrations studied (30 and 60 mmol L -1 of NH 4 + ). Nitrogen disorder by deficiency or N-NH 4 + toxicity reduced shoot dry mass production. The addition of Si to the nutrient solution and SA foliar application increased shoot dry mass production at all N-NH 4 + concentrations studied, and benefitted the photosynthetic apparatus by decreasing fluorescence and improving the quantum efficiency of photosystem II as well as dry mass production."
https://openalex.org/W3153195500,"Interventional studies targeting environment enteropathy (EE) are impeded by the lack of appropriate, validated, non-invasive biomarkers of EE. Thus, we aimed to validate the association of potential biomarkers for EE with enteric infections and nutritional status in a longitudinal birth cohort study. We measured endotoxin core antibody (EndoCab) and soluble CD14 (sCD14) in serum, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in feces using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. We found that levels of serum EndoCab and sCD14 increase with the cumulative incidence of enteric infections. We observed a significant correlation between the fecal MPO level in the children at 24 months of age with the total number of bacterial and viral infections, the total number of parasitic infections, and the total number of diarrheal episodes and diarrheal duration. We observed that the levels of serum EndoCab, sCD14, and fecal MPO at 3 months of age were significantly associated with whether children were malnourished at 18 months of age or not. Biomarkers such as fecal MPO, serum EndoCab and sCD14 in children at an early age may be useful as a measure of cumulative burden of preceding enteric infections, which are predictive of subsequent malnutrition status and may be useful non-invasive biomarkers for EE."

The river is constantly affected by different types of contamination including mine tailings in the Andes and urban sewage in the metropolitan area. In this work, we aim to produce the first characterization of aquatic bacterial communities in the Rimac river using a 16S rRNA metabarcoding approach which would be useful to identify bacterial diversity and potential understudied pathogens. We report a lower diversity in bacterial communities from the Lower Rimac (Metropolitan zone) in comparison to other sub-basins. Samples were generally grouped according to their geographical location. Bacterial classes Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia, Campylobacteria, Fusobacteriia, and Gammaproteobacteria were the most frequent along the river. Arcobacter cryaerophilus (Campylobacteria) was the most frequent species in the Lower Rimac while Flavobacterium succinicans (Bacteroidia) and Hypnocyclicus (Fusobacteriia) were the most predominant in the Upper Rimac. Predicted metabolic functions in the microbiota include bacterial motility and quorum sensing. Additional metabolomic analyses showed the presence of some insecticides and herbicides in the Parac-Upper Rimac and Santa Eulalia-Parac sub-basins. The dominance in the Metropolitan area of Arcobacter cryaerophilus , an emergent pathogen associated with fecal contamination and antibiotic multiresistance, that is not usually reported in traditional microbiological quality assessments, highlights the necessity to apply next-generation sequencing tools to improve pathogen surveillance. We believe that our study will encourage the integration of omics sciences in Peru and its application on current environmental and public health issues."
https://openalex.org/W3152705812,"Obtaining an accurate prediction of the number of influenza patients in specific areas is a crucial task undertaken by medical institutions. Infections (such as influenza) spread from person to person, and people are rarely confined to a single area. Therefore, creating a regional influenza prediction model should consider the flow of people between different areas. Although various regional flu prediction models have previously been proposed, they do not consider the flow of people among areas. In this study, we propose a method that can predict the geographical distribution of influenza patients using commuting data to represent the flow of people. To elucidate the complex spatial dependence relations, our model uses an extension of the graph convolutional network (GCN). Additionally, a prediction interval for medical institutions is proposed, which is suitable for cyclic time series. Subsequently, we used the weekly data of flu patients from health authorities as the ground-truth to evaluate the prediction interval and performance of influenza patient prediction in each prefecture in Japan. The results indicate that our GCN-based model, which used commuting data, considerably improved the predictive accuracy over baseline values both temporally and spatially to provide an appropriate prediction interval. The proposed model is vital in practical settings, such as in the decision making of public health authorities and addressing growth in vaccine demand and workload. This paper primarily presents a GCN as a useful means for predicting the spread of an epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W3153047440,"Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by the pathogenic Leptospira spp. Canine and human leptospirosis sometimes occur on Amami Oshima Island, located in the Nansei Archipelago, southwestern Japan; however, information on the causative Leptospira spp. on this island is quite limited. This study aimed to investigate the molecular and serological characteristics of Leptospira spp. isolated from wild animals and a dog in Amami Oshima Island. We obtained seven Leptospira strains by culturing kidney tissues of wild animals, such as black rats (2), wild boars (3), and rabbit (1) as well as blood from a symptomatic dog. Using flaB sequencing and microscopic agglutination test with antisera for 18 serovars, the isolates were identified as Leptospira borgpetersenii serogroups Javanica (black rat), L . interrogans serogroup Australis (black rat and dog), and L . interrogans serogroup Hebdomadis (wild boar and rabbit). The sequence type (ST) of L . borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica was determined to be ST143 via multilocus sequence typing (MLST) using seven housekeeping genes. For L . interrogans , MLST and multiple-locus variable-tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) revealed identical ST and MLVA types in rat and canine isolates, whereas two STs and MLVA types were identified in wild boar isolates. The STs and MLVA types of rabbit and one of the wild boars were identical. Bacterial culture and flaB -nested polymerase chain reaction demonstrated a high rate of Leptospira infection in wild boars (58.3%, 7/12), whereas Leptospira spp. were detected in 4.8% of black rats (2/42). This study revealed diverse Leptospira genotype and serotype maintenance in wild mammals on Amami Oshima Island. MLST and MLVA indicated that black rats were a source of canine infection. Wild boars carry L . interrogans and are considered an important maintenance host because antibodies against serogroup Hebdomadis were detected in human and canine leptospirosis patients on this island."
https://openalex.org/W3154835407,"Background Delirium in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Although some medications have been reported as risk factors for delirium, their impact on patients with ADHF is still unclear. This study aimed to determine the association of specific medication use with delirium and their additive predictive value in models based on conventional risk factors. Methods and results In this single-center, retrospective study, 650 patients treated for ADHF were included. Fifty-nine patients (9.1%) had delirium. In multivariate analysis, anxiolytic benzodiazepines [odds ratio (OR): 6.4, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.8–15], mechanical ventilation or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (OR: 6.0, 95% CI: 2.9–12), depression (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.5–6.5), intensive care or high care unit admission (OR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.5–5.6), male sex (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1–3.7), and age (OR: 1.1, 95% CI: 1–1.1) were independently associated with severe delirium. The predictive model that included anxiolytic benzodiazepines had a significantly better discriminatory ability for the incidence of severe delirium than the conventional model. Conclusions The use of anxiolytic benzodiazepines was independently correlated with severe delirium, and their use in models based on conventional risk factors had an additive value for predicting delirium in patients with ADHF."
https://openalex.org/W3154926909,"Background Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is a widely accepted scientific advancement in clinical settings that helps achieve better, safer, and more cost-effective healthcare. However, presently, validated instruments to evaluate healthcare professionals’ attitude and practices toward implementing EBM are not widely available. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the validity and reliability of a newly developed knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) questionnaire on EBM for use among healthcare professionals. Methods The Noor Evidence-Based Medicine Questionnaire was tested among physicians in a government hospital between July and August 2018. Exploratory factor analysis and internal consistency reliability-based Cronbach’s alpha statistic were conducted. Results The questionnaire was distributed among 94 physicians, and 90 responded (response rate of 95.7%). The initial number of items in the KAP domains of the Noor Evidence-Based Medicine Questionnaire were 15, 17, and 13, respectively; however, two items in the practice domain with communalities &lt;0.25 and factor loadings &lt;0.4 were removed. The factor structure accounted for 52.33%, 66.29%, and 55.39% of data variance in the KAP domains, respectively. Cronbach’s alpha values were 0.81, 0.81, and 0.84 for KAP domains, respectively, indicating high reliability. Conclusions This questionnaire can be used to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour of healthcare professionals toward EBM. Future testing of this questionnaire among other medical personnel groups will help expand the scope of this tool."

In the present study, patients with a solitary erythema migrans (EM) who had a positive blood culture for either Borrelia afzelii (n = 116) or Borrelia garinii (n = 37) were compared with age- and sex-matched patients who had a negative blood culture, but were culture positive for the corresponding Borrelia species from skin. Collectively, spirochetemic patients significantly more often recalled a tick bite at the site of the EM skin lesion, had a shorter time interval from the bite to the onset of EM, had a shorter duration of the skin lesion prior to diagnosis, and had a smaller EM skin lesion that was more often homogeneous in appearance. Similar results were found for the subset of spirochetemic patients infected with B . afzelii but not for those infected with B . garinii . However, patients with B . garinii bacteremia had faster-spreading and larger EM skin lesions, and more often reported itching at the site of the lesion than patients with B . afzelii bacteremia. Treatment failures were rare (7/306 patients, 2.3%) and were not associated with having spirochetemia or with which Borrelia species was causing the infection."

https://openalex.org/W3153062964,"Cyclooxygenase (COX) is a two-step enzyme that converts arachidonic acid into prostaglandin H 2 , a labile intermediate used in the production of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) and prostaglandin F 2α (PGF 2α ). In vertebrates and corals, COX must be N -glycosylated on at least two asparagine residues in the N-(X)-S/T motif to be catalytically active. Although COX glycosylation requirement is well-characterized in many species, whether crustacean COXs require N -glycosylation for their enzymatic function have not been investigated. In this study, a 1,842-base pair cox gene was obtained from ovarian cDNA of the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon . Sequence analysis revealed that essential catalytic residues and putative catalytic domains of P . monodon COX (PmCOX) were well-conserved in relation to other vertebrate and crustacean COXs. Expression of PmCOX in 293T cells increased levels of secreted PGE 2 and PGF 2α up to 60- and 77-fold, respectively, compared to control cells. Incubation of purified PmCOX with endoglycosidase H, which cleaves oligosaccharides from N -linked glycoproteins, reduced the molecular mass of PmCOX. Similarly, addition of tunicamycin, which inhibits N -linked glycosylation, in PmCOX-expressing cells resulted in PmCOX protein with lower molecular mass than those obtained from untreated cells, suggesting that PmCOX was N -glycosylated. Three potential glycosylation sites of PmCOX were identified at N79, N170 and N424. Mutational analysis revealed that although all three residues were glycosylated, only mutations at N170 and N424 completely abolished catalytic function. Inhibition of COX activity by ibuprofen treatment also decreased the levels of PGE 2 in shrimp haemolymph. This study not only establishes the presence of the COX enzyme in penaeid shrimp, but also reveals that N -glycosylation sites are highly conserved and required for COX function in crustaceans."

Serum samples were collected and probed with a protein microarray expressing 864/894 (96.4%) of the open reading frames of the C. trachomatis serovar D genome. The antibody response to the primary infection was analyzed in 72 serum samples from 12 inoculated monkeys. The following criteria were utilized to identify immunodominant antigens: proteins found to be recognized by at least 75% (9/12) of the infected monkeys with at least 15% elevations in signal intensity from week 0 to week 8 post infection. All infected monkeys developed Chlamydia specific serum antibodies. Eight proteins satisfied the selection criteria for immunodominant antigens: CT242 (OmpH-like protein), CT541 (mip), CT681 (ompA), CT381 (artJ), CT443 (omcB), CT119 (incA), CT486 (fliY), and CT110 (groEL). Of these, three antigens, CT119, CT486 and CT381, were not previously identified as immunodominant antigens using non-human primate sera. Following the secondary infection, the antibody responses to the eight immunodominant antigens were analyzed and found to be quite different in intensity and duration to the primary infection. In conclusion, these eight immunodominant antigens can now be tested for their ability to identify individuals with a primary C. trachomatis genital infection and to design vaccine strategies to protect against a primary infection with this pathogen."

https://openalex.org/W3155882523,"Onset detection of P-wave in seismic signals is of vital importance to seismologists because it is not only crucial to the development of early warning systems but it also aids in estimating the seismic source parameters. All the existing P-wave onset detection methods are based on a combination of statistical signal processing and time-series modeling ideas. However, these methods do not adequately accommodate some advanced ideas that exist in fault detection literature, especially those based on predictive analytics. When combined with a time-frequency (t-f) / temporal-spectral localization method, the effectiveness of such methods is enhanced significantly. This work proposes a novel real-time automatic P-wave detector and picker in the prediction framework with a time-frequency localization feature. The proposed approach brings a diverse set of capabilities in accurately detecting the P-wave onset, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions that all the existing methods fail to attain. The core idea is to monitor the difference in squared magnitudes of one-step-ahead predictions and measurements in the time-frequency bands with a statistically determined threshold. The proposed framework essentially accommodates any suitable prediction methodology and time-frequency transformation. We demonstrate the proposed framework by deploying auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models for predictions and the well-known maximal overlap discrete wavelet packet transform (MODWPT) for the t-f projection of measurements. The ability and efficacy of the proposed method, especially in detecting P-waves embedded in low SNR measurements, is illustrated on a synthetic data set and 200 real-time data sets spanning four different geographical regions. A comparison with three prominently used detectors, namely, STA/LTA, AIC, and DWT-AIC, shows improved detection rate for low SNR events, better accuracy of detection and picking, decreased false alarm rate, and robustness to outliers in data. Specifically, the proposed method yields a detection rate of 89% and a false alarm rate of 11.11%, which are significantly better than those of existing methods."

While masks are known to prevent transmission towards other individuals, it is unclear if different types of facial masks can protect the user from inhalation. The present study compares in-vitro different commercial and custom-made facial masks at different distances and breathing patterns. Methods Masks were placed on a head mannequin connected to a lung simulator, using a collecting filter placed after the mannequin airway. Certified, commercial and custom-made masks were tested at three different distances between the emitter and the mannequin: 40 cm, 80 cm and 120 cm. Two patterns of breathing were used, simulating normal and polypneic respiration. A solution of methylene blue was nebulized with a jet nebulizer and different mask-distance-breathing pattern combinations were tested. The primary endpoint was the inhaled fraction, defined as the amount of methylene blue detected with spectrophotometry expressed as percent of the amount detected in a reference condition of zero distance and no mask. Findings We observed a significant effect of distance (p &lt; 0.001), pattern of breathing (p = 0.040) and type of mask (p &lt; 0.001) on inhaled fraction. All masks resulted in lower inhaled fraction compared to breathing without mask (p &lt; 0.001 in all comparisons), ranging from 41.1% ± 0.3% obtained with a cotton mask at 40 cm distance with polypneic pattern to &lt;1% for certified FFP3 and the combination of FFP2 + surgical mask at all distances and both breathing pattern conditions. Discussion Distance, type of device and breathing pattern resulted in highly variable inhaled fraction. While the use of all types of masks resulted relevantly less inhalation compared to distancing alone, only high-grade certified devices (FFP3 and the combination of FFP2 + surgical mask) ensured negligible inhaled fraction in all conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3156294539,"Purpose We investigated the effect of octreotide, a long-acting somatostatin (SST) analogue, on IGF-1 secretion and its possible mechanism of action in orbital fibroblasts (OFs) from patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO). Materials and methods OFs were isolated from the orbital fat of patients with TAO or healthy individuals. The expression level of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, at the protein and mRNA level, was determined with ELISA and quantitative RT-PCR, respectively. The expression pattern of somatostatin receptor (SSTR) 2, which has the highest affinity for octreotide, was examined by flow cytometry. The activity of NF-κB pathway was determined by examining the levels of phosphorylation of IKKα/β and p65, and degradation of IκB via western blot analysis, and by measuring the activity of NF-kB-dependent luciferase via transfection with plasmids containing luciferase and NF-κB binding site. Results OFs from patients with TAO showed significantly higher levels of IGF-1 secretion and NF-κB activity even in the absence of stimulation, compared to those from controls. Treatment with octreotide reduced the level of IGF-1 secretion in OFs from patients with TAO, but not in OFs from controls. OFs from patients with TAO expressed higher levels of SSTR2 on the cell surface, compared to controls. In addition, the expression of IGF-1 at the protein and mRNA level was dependent on the activity of NF-κB pathway in OFs from patients with TAO. Furthermore, treatment with octreotide reduced on the activity of NF-κB pathway in OFs from patients with TAO. Conclusion OFs from patients with TAO showed significantly higher levels of IGF-1 secretion via up-regulation of NF-κB activity. Treatment with octreotide inhibited the secretion of IGF-1 by reducing the NF-κB pathway in OFs, which expressed higher levels of SSRT2 on the cell surface, from patients with TAO."
https://openalex.org/W3156948534,"PRISM ( Projet Réaffiliation Itinérance Santé Mentale –mental health and homelessness reaffiliation project), is a new shelter-based mental health service in Montreal, Canada. It offers short-term residential services in a shelter with the aim of housing and connecting the person to the appropriate services in the community. This qualitative research project was designed to gain a rich understanding of service-user experience within this program, and to apply these impressions to a broader reflection concerning how to best serve the needs of homeless people living with severe mental illness. We conducted in-depth interviews with 20 clients from the all-male PRISM-Welcome Hall Mission at program intake and departure between May 2018 and March 2019. We used methods stemming from grounded theory to analyze themes emerging from the interviews. Analysis revealed three core aspects endorsed by PRISM clients as helpful to their recovery: first, the community-based and flexible PRISM structure allows for continuity in daily routine through the preservation and expansion of the client’s existing informal resource network; second, the secure environment is conducive to improving one’s physical and mental health; and third, the multimodal mental health and social service approach used at PRISM is appreciated and stands in contrast to what most have experienced during other inpatient experiences. This led us to reflect more broadly on the benefits of a shelter-based intervention, as a catalyst to the achievement of longer-term goals such as housing, as well as flexible care adapted to the specific needs of these individuals. Even though this study took place in a specific program in Quebec, it sheds light more broadly on how to best meet the needs of individuals with mental illness living in homeless situations and contributes to the growing literature on men’s mental health."
https://openalex.org/W3153813586,"Numerous health insurers offer bonus programmes that score customers’ health behaviour, and car insurers offer telematics tariffs that score driving behaviour. In many countries, however, only a minority of customers participate in these programmes. In a population-representative survey of private households in Germany (N = 2,215), we study the acceptance of the criteria (features) on which the scoring programmes are based: the features for driver scoring (speed, texting while driving, time of driving, area of driving, accelerating and braking behaviour, respectively) and for health scoring (walking distance per day, sleeping hours per night, alcohol consumption, weight, participation in recommended cancer screenings, smoking status). In a second step, we model participants’ acceptance of both programmes with regard to the underlying feature acceptance. We find that insurers in Germany rarely use the features which the participants consider to be the most relevant and justifiable, that is, smoking status for health scoring and smartphone use for driver scoring. Heuristic models (fast-and-frugal trees) show that programme acceptance depends on the acceptance of a few features. These models can help to understand customers’ preferences and to design scoring programmes that are based on scientific evidence regarding behaviours and factors associated with good health and safe driving and are thus more likely to be accepted."
https://openalex.org/W3153890652,"Versican is a large proteoglycan in the extracellular matrix. During embryonic stages, it plays a crucial role in the development of cartilage, heart, and dermis. Previously, we reported that Prx1-Vcan conditional knockout mice, lacking Vcan expression in mesenchymal condensation areas of the limb bud, show the impaired joint formation and delayed cartilage development. Here, we investigated their phenotype in adults and found that they develop swelling of the knee joint. Histologically, their newborn joint exhibited impaired formation of both anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments. Immunostaining revealed a decrease in scleraxis-positive cells in both articular cartilage and ligament of Prx1-Vcan knee joint, spotty patterns of type I collagen, and the presence of type II collagen concomitant with the absence of versican expression. These results suggest that versican expression during the perinatal period is required for cruciate ligaments’ formation and that its depletion affects joint function in later ages."
https://openalex.org/W3155215844,"This study aims to explore the freight demand network spatial patterns in six provinces of central China from the perspective of the spread of the epidemic and the freight imbalance and breakout. To achieve this purpose, the big data of “cart search” demand information provided by small and medium freight enterprises on the freight information platform are analyzed. 343,690 pieces of freight demand big data on the freight information platform and Python, ArcGIS, UCINET, and Gephi software are used. The results show that: (1) The choke-point of unbalanced freight demand network is Wuhan, and the secondary choke-points are Hefei and Zhengzhou. (2) In southern China, a chain reaction circle of freight imbalance is formed with Wuhan, Hefei, and Nanchang as the centers. In northern China, a chain reaction circle of freight imbalance is formed with Zhengzhou and Taiyuan as the centers. (3) The freight demand of the six provinces in central China exhibits typical characteristics of long tail distribution with large span and unbalanced distribution. (4) The import and export of freight in different cities vary greatly, and the distribution is unbalanced. This study indicates the imbalance difference, chain reaction, keys and hidden troubles posed by the freight demand network. From the perspectives of freight transfer breakout, freight balance breakout, freight strength breakout, and breakout of freight periphery cities, we propose solutions to breakouts in the freight market in six provinces of central China in the post-epidemic era."
https://openalex.org/W3155429532,"This study aimed to elucidate whether ballistic, maximal strength and strength-endurance performances are affected by the sex of the evaluator. Sixteen young male handball players attended two testing sessions that only differed in the sex of the evaluators (2 women vs . 2 men). The two sessions were performed in a counterbalanced order. Ballistic performance (countermovement jump height and throwing velocity), maximal strength performance (squat and bench press [BP] one-repetition maximum [1RM]), and strength-endurance performance (number of repetitions-to-failure in BP and average velocity of the set in the squat) were assessed in both sessions. BP 1RM was greater in the presence of women evaluators ( p = 0.036, ES = 0.09), whereas no differences were observed for the remaining variables ( p ≥ 0.254, ES ≤ 0.19). Low correlations ( r median [range] = -0.074 [-0.693, 0.326]) were observed between the different performance tests for the percent differences between both testing sessions. The sex of the evaluators has minimal influence on a number of physical traits in young male handball players when they are tested in the presence of other members of the team, while the low correlations indicate that a higher performance in one test under the presence of women does not imply a higher performance under the presence of women in other performance tests."
https://openalex.org/W3156607418,"Assessment has long played an important role as a measurement tool of student mastery over course content. However, testing has also been shown to be an effective learning tool. Cumulative testing, in which all material from the entire learning period is covered, has been assumed to be effective, yet few studies have explicitly tested its effectiveness compared to non-cumulative testing. Studies in psychology and mathematics courses suggest that cumulative final exams increase long-term retention of information, and cumulative testing during the semester can increase cumulative final exam performance and long-term retention. Because frequent testing has also been shown to increase student learning, the purpose of this quasi-experimental study is to investigate the effects of cumulative versus non-cumulative midterms on student learning in a course that uses frequent assessment. In this study, one section of an introductory biology course for non-majors was given seven cumulative midterms, with about half of the questions drawn from previous units and the rest covering the current unit. The other section was given seven non-cumulative midterms that focused on current material while other course characteristics were held constant. Student performance on a common, cumulative final exam and a retention exam five months later were compared. Midterm format had no effect on final exam performance, contradicting the few studies done in psychology and mathematics courses. Thus, there may be no additional benefit of cumulative testing if exams are given frequently. Cumulative midterms appeared to increase retention after five months, but only for students who entered the course with low reasoning skills. Interestingly, students with high reasoning skills appeared to retain more from the course if they were given non-cumulative midterms. Possible explanations and ideas for future research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3156800513,"Purpose To investigate retinal vessel shift (RVS) and its association with axial length (AL) elongation in junior high school students. Methods Total 161 eyes of 161 healthy junior high school students were prospectively studied. Optical AL and anterior chamber depth (ACD) measurements, and fundus photography were performed in the first and third grades. Eyes of subjects in the first and third grade that had perfect matching among all the retinal vessels were allocated to the RVS(−) group, otherwise allocated to the RVS(+) group. In the RVS(+) group, the peripapillary retinal arteries angle (PRAA) was measured for quantitative analysis of RVS; the angle between the major retinal arteries. The variables related to PRAA were identified using model selection with the corrected Akaike information criterion. Results Forty-two eyes (26.1%) were allocated to the RVS(+) group. There were seven patterns in the RVS of those in the RVS(+) group, including clockwise shift in the supra temporal area (5 eyes), infra temporal area (7 eyes), and nasal area (9 eyes); anticlockwise shift in the supra temporal area (7 eyes), infra temporal area (5 eyes), and nasal area (2 eyes); and distal shift in the temporal area (7 eyes). The optimal model for the PRAA narrowing included larger AL and body weight in the first grade, and greater AL elongation. Conclusion Various (seven) RVS patterns were observed in about 25% of the junior high school students within two years. RVS was associated with AL elongation, and useful to reveal the mechanism of myopic retinal stretch."
https://openalex.org/W3153741570,"Introduction Atrial fibrillation (AF) comes along with high risk of stroke. This risk continues even after re-establishing sinus rhythm with cardioversion. Aim of this study is to evaluate the contribution of electric cardioversion (EC) to platelet activation and procoagulatory tendency. Methods Extent of platelet activation before and after electric cardioversion was quantified using flow cytometry, impedance aggregation measurements with Multiplate®, and quantification of serum levels of platelet factor 4 (PF4) and ß-thromboglobulin (ß-TG) in patients with AF (N = 10). Results No significant differences were observed in any of the measured parameters comparing the values from before and after cardioversion. Geometric means of P-selectin expression and integrin αIIbβ3 activation were 0.27 (+/- 0.07) and 2.30 (+/- 2.61) before EC and 0.28 (+/- 0.17) and 1.67 (+/- 1.82) after EC. Levels of ß-TG were 110.11 ng/ml (+/- 3.78) before and 110.51 ng/ml (+/- 2.56) after EC, levels of PF4 were 35.64 ng/ml (+/- 12.94) before and 32.40 ng/ml (+/- 4.95) after EC. Platelet aggregation triggered with adenosine diphosphate (ADP), arachidonic acid, collagen, Ristocetin, or thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) revealed results within the normally expected ranges without significant changes before and after EC. Discussion Electric cardioversion has no influence on platelet activation markers which is in agreement with other studies reporting electrical cardioversion to be safe."
https://openalex.org/W3154612266,"Introduction Sport and recreation is beneficial for health and wellbeing but comes with a probability of loss, including occasional fatal injuries. Following high-profile injury deaths in Australia, concerns are raised regarding the safety of sport participation. To understand the scale and scope of injury deaths, and identify potential prevention opportunities, the aim of this investigation was to describe the number and nature of fatal injuries in Australian sport and recreation. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of injury deaths reported between 1 July 2000 to 31 December 2019 using data from the National Coronial Information System, Australia. Unintentional deaths with an external cause, where the activity was recorded as sport and exercise during leisure time were included. Drowning deaths were excluded. Presented are the number and % of cases by age, sex, sport, broad cause and annual crude death rate (population). Results There were 1192 deaths, averaging 63 per year. Deaths were mostly in males (84.4%), with the largest proportion in people aged 15–24 years (23.1%). Wheeled motor (26.9%) and non-motor (16.2%) sports accounted for the highest proportion of cases. The primary mechanism of death was most commonly blunt force (85.4%), followed by piercing/penetrating force (5.0%). The years 2001 and 2005 recorded the highest crude injury death rate (2001, n = 92, 0.47 per 100,000 population; 2005, n = 95, 0.47 per 100,000 population). Conclusions On average, there is more than one injury death per week in a sport or recreation setting in Australia. Cases occurred in many sports and recreation activities, including those generally considered to be safe (e.g. individual athletic activities, team ball sports.) Detailed investigation of the coronial recommendations that are present within each case is now needed to understand and identify potential prevention opportunities."
