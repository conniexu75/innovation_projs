The procedures of Svaetichin2 and Grundfest1 call for special apparatus, and the method of Hubel3, employing tungsten, in our hands gives rather noisy electrodes which are difficult to straighten. Steel electrodes, which have the advantages of low noise, low electrode potential, ease of straightening and, in particular, offer the possibility of accurate localization of the recording site, may be made as follows."

https://openalex.org/W2079211047,"DURING the past few years, it has become apparent that an important action of the cardiac glycosides involves the transport of potassium ions into the cell. It has also become possible, by the use of potassium-depleted erythrocytes, to test the relative inhibitory potency of such glycosides or their aglycones in vitro
1,2. Approximately 80 per cent of the potassium influx can be inhibited by the glycoside by an action that appears to involve competition by drug and potassium ions for the active transport site. The transport of chloride ions in the stomach appears to be similarly affected3. Since the maintenance of a concentration gradient for iodide by an ‘active transport’ is one of the fundamental properties of thyroid tissue, we determined whether or not iodide transport was likewise inhibited by the cardiac glycosides."

5. We have shown that all these sugars are 3,6-dideoxy-hexoses6,7."

https://openalex.org/W1987265712,"Salhanick and Berliner1 studied a feminizing adrenal tumour from a man of 22. It weighed 920 gm., of which 523 gm. were used for chemical extraction. The frozen tissue was homogenized and extracted with acetone, leaving a ‘protein’ residue. The aqueous acetone was extracted with chloroform and the resulting lipid was partitioned between hexane and 75 per cent methanol. The latter was reduced to small bulk and extracted with chloroform to yield 0.67 gm. of yellow oil. The protein residue was digested with alkali (1 l. 5 per cent sodium hydroxide) for two days and extracted first with ether at pH 10 and then at pH 3 after acidification. After partitioning the extract, 0.26 gm. of oil was obtained. Chromatography on silica gel yielded progesterone, equilenin and two unidentified materials designated AAE-I-BI (44 µgm.) and AAE-I-AI (23 µgm.) from the acetone extract. From the protein hydrolysate extract the same materials were obtained in somewhat larger amounts (AAE-I-AI, 109 µgm.) together with three further unidentified fractions."

https://openalex.org/W1979988003,"Moskowitz and Carb1 have reported that treatment of human red cells with formalin inhibits their agglutinability without impairing their absorptive power for the corresponding blood-group agglutinin. During the course of a similar investigation, we have confirmed these findings and also the observation of Weinbach2 that formol-treated red cells are sufficiently ‘toughened’ to withstand freeze-drying by lyophilization. We have found that such lyophilized cells re-suspended in normal saline retain their original absorptive capacity for blood-group agglutinins, and that eluates prepared from these cells by Landsteiner's heat method, following absorption, are as active as those from untreated cells. No haemolysis has occurred during elution."

https://openalex.org/W2034266150,"CURRENT literature contains confusing reports about the number and nature of the free amino-acids normally present in human cerebrospinal fluid1. Thus, while some investigators have detected only three to eight amino-acids2, others have found as many as eighteen3. In many instances, a particular amino-acid was not present regularly, but was only observed in a few cases. For this reason, reports which suggest that certain amino-acids occur exclusively in certain diseases can only be regarded as speculative. The aim of the present work has been to establish whether or not a regular pattern of amino-acids exists in normal and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid."

https://openalex.org/W1979042449,"PREVIOUS investigators have shown that human plasma cholinesterase is strongly inhibited by both lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and its 2-bromo derivative (BOL). The cholinesterases of other species were less sensitive to the effects of both these substances1–3. Recent reports described certain newer choline esters, namely, imidazoleacrylylcholine4 5 (murexine), imidazoleacetylcholine6 and imidazolepropionylcholine (dihydromurexine) which are hydrolysed most readily by human plasma cholinesterase7–10. These observations have led us to evaluate the possible relationship between cholinesterase inhibition by lysergic acid diethylamide and BOL and cholinesterase hydrolysis of dihydromurexine. Dihydromurexine was chosen as the model substrate because it is the most active of the three esters."
https://openalex.org/W2046279996,"DURING a survey of soil- and root-invading fungi in swards of perennial rye-grass carried out in 1956 and 1957 particular attention was given to the occurrence of Fusarium culmorum (W.G.Sm.) Sacc. This species, which is considered to be a soil inhabitant, is also a weak parasite of the roots of many members of the Gramineae, and during the survey it was isolated regularly from soil and from the roots of rye-grass. We find that its occurrence in both of these substrates is influenced by microbial antagonisms."
