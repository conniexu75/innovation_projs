Gao et al. report preclinical results of an early vaccine candidate called PiCoVacc, which protected rhesus macaque monkeys against SARS-CoV-2 infection when analyzed in short-term studies. The researchers obtained multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains from 11 hospitalized patients across the world and then chemically inactivated the harmful properties of the virus. Animals were immunized with one of two vaccine doses and then inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Those that received the lowest dose showed signs of controlling the infection, and those receiving the highest dose appeared more protected and did not have detectable viral loads in the pharynx or lungs at 7 days after infection. The next steps will be testing for safety and efficacy in humans. Science , this issue p. 77"

Recent studies have suggested that breakdown of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is an early biomarker of human cognitive dysfunction7, including the early clinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease5,8–10. The E4 variant of apolipoprotein E (APOE4), the main susceptibility gene for Alzheimer’s disease11–14, leads to accelerated breakdown of the BBB and degeneration of brain capillary pericytes15–19, which maintain BBB integrity20–22. It is unclear, however, whether the cerebrovascular effects of APOE4 contribute to cognitive impairment. Here we show that individuals bearing APOE4 (with the ε3/ε4 or ε4/ε4 alleles) are distinguished from those without APOE4 (ε3/ε3) by breakdown of the BBB in the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe. This finding is apparent in cognitively unimpaired APOE4 carriers and more severe in those with cognitive impairment, but is not related to amyloid-β or tau pathology measured in cerebrospinal fluid or by positron emission tomography23. High baseline levels of the BBB pericyte injury biomarker soluble PDGFRβ7,8 in the cerebrospinal fluid predicted future cognitive decline in APOE4 carriers but not in non-carriers, even after controlling for amyloid-β and tau status, and were correlated with increased activity of the BBB-degrading cyclophilin A-matrix metalloproteinase-9 pathway19 in cerebrospinal fluid. Our findings suggest that breakdown of the BBB contributes to APOE4-associated cognitive decline independently of Alzheimer’s disease pathology, and might be a therapeutic target in APOE4 carriers. Breakdown of the blood–brain barrier in individuals carrying the ε4 allele of the APOE gene, but not the ε3 allele, increases with and predicts cognitive impairment and is independent of amyloid β or tau pathology."
https://openalex.org/W3020766569,"Immune evasion is a major obstacle for cancer treatment. Common mechanisms of evasion include impaired antigen presentation caused by mutations or loss of heterozygosity of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), which has been implicated in resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy1–3. However, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is resistant to most therapies including ICB4, mutations that cause loss of MHC-I are rarely found5 despite the frequent downregulation of MHC-I expression6–8. Here we show that, in PDAC, MHC-I molecules are selectively targeted for lysosomal degradation by an autophagy-dependent mechanism that involves the autophagy cargo receptor NBR1. PDAC cells display reduced expression of MHC-I at the cell surface and instead demonstrate predominant localization within autophagosomes and lysosomes. Notably, inhibition of autophagy restores surface levels of MHC-I and leads to improved antigen presentation, enhanced anti-tumour T cell responses and reduced tumour growth in syngeneic host mice. Accordingly, the anti-tumour effects of autophagy inhibition are reversed by depleting CD8+ T cells or reducing surface expression of MHC-I. Inhibition of autophagy, either genetically or pharmacologically with chloroquine, synergizes with dual ICB therapy (anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies), and leads to an enhanced anti-tumour immune response. Our findings demonstrate a role for enhanced autophagy or lysosome function in immune evasion by selective targeting of MHC-I molecules for degradation, and provide a rationale for the combination of autophagy inhibition and dual ICB therapy as a therapeutic strategy against PDAC. Inhibition of the autophagy–lysosome system upregulates surface expression of MHC class I proteins and enhances antigen presentation, and evokes a potent anti-tumour immune response that is mediated by CD8+ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2967788151,"The emergence of flat electronic bands and of the recently discovered strongly correlated and superconducting phases in twisted bilayer graphene crucially depends on the interlayer twist angle upon approaching the magic angle $\theta_M \approx 1.1\deg$. Although advanced fabrication methods allow alignment of graphene layers with global twist angle control of about 0.1$\deg$, little information is currently available on the distribution of the local twist angles in actual magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) transport devices. Here we map the local $\theta$ variations in hBN encapsulated devices with relative precision better than 0.002$\deg$ and spatial resolution of a few moir$\'e$ periods. Utilizing a scanning nanoSQUID-on-tip, we attain tomographic imaging of the Landau levels in the quantum Hall state in MATBG, which provides a highly sensitive probe of the charge disorder and of the local band structure determined by the local $\theta$. We find that even state-of-the-art devices, exhibiting high-quality global MATBG features including superconductivity, display significant variations in the local $\theta$ with a span close to 0.1$\deg$. Devices may even have substantial areas where no local MATBG behavior is detected, yet still display global MATBG characteristics in transport, highlighting the importance of percolation physics. The derived $\theta$ maps reveal substantial gradients and a network of jumps. We show that the twist angle gradients generate large unscreened electric fields that drastically change the quantum Hall state by forming edge states in the bulk of the sample, and may also significantly affect the phase diagram of correlated and superconducting states. The findings call for exploration of band structure engineering utilizing twist-angle gradients and gate-tunable built-in planar electric fields for novel correlated phenomena and applications."
https://openalex.org/W3020184170,"Thermoelectric generation using the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) has great potential for application in energy harvesting technology because the transverse geometry of the Nernst effect should enable efficient, large-area and flexible coverage of a heat source. For such applications to be viable, substantial improvements will be necessary not only for their performance but also for the associated material costs, safety and stability. In terms of the electronic structure, the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) originates from the Berry curvature of the conduction electrons near the Fermi energy1,2. To design a large Berry curvature, several approaches have been considered using nodal points and lines in momentum space3–10. Here we perform a high-throughput computational search and find that 25 percent doping of aluminium and gallium in alpha iron, a naturally abundant and low-cost element, dramatically enhances the ANE by a factor of more than ten, reaching about 4 and 6 microvolts per kelvin at room temperature, respectively, close to the highest value reported so far. The comparison between experiment and theory indicates that the Fermi energy tuning to the nodal web—a flat band structure made of interconnected nodal lines—is the key for the strong enhancement in the transverse thermoelectric coefficient, reaching a value of about 5 amperes per kelvin per metre with a logarithmic temperature dependence. We have also succeeded in fabricating thin films that exhibit a large ANE at zero field, which could be suitable for designing low-cost, flexible microelectronic thermoelectric generators11–13. Aluminium- and gallium-doped iron compounds show a large anomalous Nernst effect owing to a topological electronic structure, and their films are potentially suitable for designing low-cost, flexible microelectronic thermoelectric generators."

https://openalex.org/W3022018326,"When miniaturizing fluidic circuitry, the solid walls of the fluid channels become increasingly important1 because they limit the flow rates achievable for a given pressure drop, and they are prone to fouling2. Approaches for reducing the wall interactions include hydrophobic coatings3, liquid-infused porous surfaces4–6, nanoparticle surfactant jamming7, changes to surface electronic structure8, electrowetting9,10, surface tension pinning11,12 and use of atomically flat channels13. A better solution may be to avoid the solid walls altogether. Droplet microfluidics and sheath flow achieve this but require continuous flow of the central liquid and the surrounding liquid1,14. Here we demonstrate an approach in which aqueous liquid channels are surrounded by an immiscible magnetic liquid, both of which are stabilized by a quadrupolar magnetic field. This creates self-healing, non-clogging, anti-fouling and near-frictionless liquid-in-liquid fluidic channels. Manipulation of the field provides flow control, such as valving, splitting, merging and pumping. The latter is achieved by moving permanent magnets that have no physical contact with the liquid channel. We show that this magnetostaltic pumping method can be used to transport whole human blood with very little damage due to shear forces. Haemolysis (rupture of blood cells) is reduced by an order of magnitude compared with traditional peristaltic pumping, in which blood is mechanically squeezed through a plastic tube. Our liquid-in-liquid approach provides new ways to transport delicate liquids, particularly when scaling channels down to the micrometre scale, with no need for high pressures, and could also be used for microfluidic circuitry. Wall-free liquid channels surrounded by an immiscible magnetic liquid can be used to create liquid circuitry or to transport human blood without damaging the blood cells by moving permanent magnets."
https://openalex.org/W3020979633,"Abstract Vaccines may reduce the burden of antimicrobial resistance, in part by preventing infections for which treatment often includes the use of antibiotics 1–4 . However, the effects of vaccination on antibiotic consumption remain poorly understood—especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where the burden of antimicrobial resistance is greatest 5 . Here we show that vaccines that have recently been implemented in the World Health Organization’s Expanded Programme on Immunization reduce antibiotic consumption substantially among children under five years of age in LMICs. By analysing data from large-scale studies of households, we estimate that pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and live attenuated rotavirus vaccines confer 19.7% (95% confidence interval, 3.4–43.4%) and 11.4% (4.0–18.6%) protection against antibiotic-treated episodes of acute respiratory infection and diarrhoea, respectively, in age groups that experience the greatest disease burden attributable to the vaccine-targeted pathogens 6,7 . Under current coverage levels, pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines prevent 23.8 million and 13.6 million episodes of antibiotic-treated illness, respectively, among children under five years of age in LMICs each year. Direct protection resulting from the achievement of universal coverage targets for these vaccines could prevent an additional 40.0 million episodes of antibiotic-treated illness. This evidence supports the prioritization of vaccines within the global strategy to combat antimicrobial resistance 8 ."
https://openalex.org/W3017093300,"Photoreceptor loss is the final common endpoint in most retinopathies that lead to irreversible blindness, and there are no effective treatments to restore vision1,2. Chemical reprogramming of fibroblasts offers an opportunity to reverse vision loss; however, the generation of sensory neuronal subtypes such as photoreceptors remains a challenge. Here we report that the administration of a set of five small molecules can chemically induce the transformation of fibroblasts into rod photoreceptor-like cells. The transplantation of these chemically induced photoreceptor-like cells (CiPCs) into the subretinal space of rod degeneration mice (homozygous for rd1, also known as Pde6b) leads to partial restoration of the pupil reflex and visual function. We show that mitonuclear communication is a key determining factor for the reprogramming of fibroblasts into CiPCs. Specifically, treatment with these five compounds leads to the translocation of AXIN2 to the mitochondria, which results in the production of reactive oxygen species, the activation of NF-κB and the upregulation of Ascl1. We anticipate that CiPCs could have therapeutic potential for restoring vision."
https://openalex.org/W3021436433,"GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansions (HREs) in C9orf72 cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and lead to the production of aggregating dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) via repeat associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. Here, we show the similar intronic GGCCTG HREs that causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (SCA36) is also translated into DPRs, including poly(GP) and poly(PR). We demonstrate that poly(GP) is more abundant in SCA36 compared to c9ALS/FTD patient tissue due to canonical AUG-mediated translation from intron-retained GGCCTG repeat RNAs. However, the frequency of the antisense RAN translation product poly(PR) is comparable between c9ALS/FTD and SCA36 patient samples. Interestingly, in SCA36 patient tissue, poly(GP) exists as a soluble species, and no TDP-43 pathology is present. We show that aggregate-prone chimeric DPR (cDPR) species underlie the divergent DPR pathology between c9ALS/FTD and SCA36. These findings reveal key differences in translation, solubility, and protein aggregation of DPRs between c9ALS/FTD and SCA36."

https://openalex.org/W3021112387,"Many therapies for lysosomal storage disorders rely on cross-correction of lysosomal enzymes. In globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD), mutations in GALC cause psychosine accumulation, inducing demyelination, a neuroinflammatory “globoid” reaction and neurodegeneration. The efficiency of GALC cross-correction in vivo, the role of the GALC substrate galactosylceramide, and the origin of psychosine are poorly understood. Using a novel GLD model, we show that cross-correction does not occur efficiently in vivo and that Galc-deficient Schwann cells autonomously produce psychosine. Furthermore, macrophages require GALC to degrade myelin, as Galc-deficient macrophages are transformed into globoid cells by exposure to galactosylceramide and produce a more severe GLD phenotype. Finally, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients reduces globoid cells in nerves, suggesting that the phagocytic response of healthy macrophages, rather than cross-correction, contributes to the therapeutic effect. Thus, GLD may be caused by at least two mechanisms: psychosine-induced demyelination and secondary neuroinflammation from galactosylceramide storage in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W3023571117,"8-Oxoguanine DNA glycosylase1 (OGG1)-initiated base excision repair (BER) is the primary pathway to remove the pre-mutagenic 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG) from DNA. Recent studies documented 8-oxoG serves as an epigenetic-like mark and OGG1 modulates gene expression in oxidatively stressed cells. For this new role of OGG1, two distinct mechanisms have been proposed: one is coupled to base excision, while the other only requires substrate binding of OGG1––both resulting in conformational adjustment in the adjacent DNA sequences providing access for transcription factors to their cis-elements. The present study aimed to examine if BER activity of OGG1 is required for pro-inflammatory gene expression. To this end, Ogg1/OGG1 knockout/depleted cells were transfected with constructs expressing wild-type (wt) and repair-deficient mutants of OGG1. OGG1's promoter enrichment, oxidative state, and gene expression were examined. Results showed that TNFα exposure increased levels of oxidatively modified cysteine(s) of wt OGG1 without impairing its association with promoter and facilitated gene expression. The excision deficient K249Q mutant was even a more potent activator of gene expression; whereas, mutant OGG1 with impaired substrate recognition/binding was not. These data suggested the interaction of OGG1 with its substrate at regulatory regions followed by conformational adjustment in the adjacent DNA is the primary mode to modulate inflammatory gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W3022746100,"Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite which is capable of establishing life-long chronic infection in any mammalian host. During the intracellular life cycle, the parasite secretes an array of proteins into the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) where it resides. Specialized organelles called the dense granules secrete GRA proteins that are known to participate in nutrient acquisition, immune evasion, and host cell-cycle manipulation. Although many GRAs have been discovered which are expressed during the acute infection mediated by tachyzoites, little is known about those that participate in the chronic infection mediated by the bradyzoite form of the parasite. In this study, we sought to uncover novel bradyzoite-upregulated GRA proteins using proximity biotinylation, which we previously used to examine the secreted proteome of the tachyzoites. Using a fusion of the bradyzoite upregulated protein MAG1 to BirA* as bait and a strain with improved switch efficiency, we identified a number of novel GRA proteins which are expressed in bradyzoites. After using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to characterize these proteins by gene knockout, we focused on one of these GRAs (GRA55) and found it was important for the establishment or maintenance of cysts in the mouse brain. These findings highlight new components of the GRA proteome of the tissue-cyst life stage of T. gondii and identify potential targets that are important for maintenance of parasite persistence in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3022942894,"Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fundamental biological process that occurs during development and tumorigenesis. The Rho family of GTPases (Rho-family) is a well-characterized regulator of actin cytoskeleton that gives rise to EMT-associated cell activities. Meanwhile, there are in total at least 66 different Rho-GTPase-activating proteins (Rho-GAPs), which, as an upstream regulator, inactivate specific members of the Rho-family in a cell context-dependent manner. However, molecular roles of individual Rho-GAPs are poorly understood, particularly regarding their involvements in EMT. Here, based on comprehensive screening on the whole Rho-GAP family, we identified specific Rho-GAPs that are responsible for the maintenance of epithelial cell phenotypes, suppressing EMT in human mammary epithelial cells. Specifically, we revealed that at least two Rho-GAPs, that is, ARHGAP4 and SH3BP1, critically regulate the cell morphology. Among them, we focused on ARHGAP4 and demonstrated with multidisciplinary approaches that this specific Rho-GAP regulates epithelial/mesenchymal-selective marker expression, cell proliferation, migration, 3D morphogenesis, and focal adhesion/stress fiber-driven physical force generation in a manner reminiscent of the EMT process. Furthermore, we identified Septin9 with proteomic analyses as a negative regulator of ARHGAP4, which promotes the occurrence of EMT by activation of the FAK/Src signaling pathway. These findings shed light on the novel Rho-GAP-associated pathway in the EMT process under development and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3023311945,"Malus halliana is an iron (Fe)-efficient apple rootstock growing in calcareous soil that shows obvious 'greenness' traits during Fe deficiency. Recent studies have shown that exogenous sugars can be involved in abiotic stress. To identify the key regulatory steps of chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis in M. halliana under Fe deficiency and to verify whether exogenous sucrose (Suc) is involved in Fe deficiency stress, we determined the contents of the Chl precursor and the expression of several Chl biosynthetic genes in M. halliana. The results showed that Fe deficiency caused a significant increase in the contents of protoporphyrin IX (Proto IX), Mg-protoporphyrin IX (Mg-Proto IX) and protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) in M. halliana compared to the Fe-sensitive rootstock Malus hupehensis. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) also showed that the expression of protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPOX), which synthesizes Proto IX, was upregulated in M. halliana and downregulated in M. hupehensis under Fe deficiency. Exogenous Suc application prominently enhanced the contents of porphobilinogen (PBG) and the subsequent precursor, whereas it decreased the level of δ-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA), suggesting that the transformation from ALA to PBG was catalyzed in M. halliana. Additionally, the transcript level of δ-aminolevulinate acid dehydratase (ALAD) was noticeably upregulated after exogenous Suc treatment. This result, combined with the precursor contents, indicated that Suc accelerated the steps of Chl biosynthesis by modulating the ALAD gene. Therefore, we conclude that PPOX is the key regulatory gene of M. halliana in response to Fe deficiency. Exogenous Suc enhances M. halliana tolerance to Fe deficiency stress by regulating Chl biosynthesis."

Promising candidates for novel clocks are highly charged ions (HCIs) and nuclear transitions, which are largely insensitive to external perturbations and reach wavelengths beyond the optical range, now becoming accessible to frequency combs. However, insufficiently accurate atomic structure calculations still hinder the identification of suitable transitions in HCIs. Here, we report on the discovery of a long-lived metastable electronic state in a HCI by measuring the mass difference of the ground and the excited state in Re, the first non-destructive, direct determination of an electronic excitation energy. This result agrees with our advanced calculations, and we confirmed them with an Os ion with the same electronic configuration. We used the high-precision Penning-trap mass spectrometer PENTATRAP, unique in its synchronous use of five individual traps for simultaneous mass measurements. The cyclotron frequency ratio $R$ of the ion in the ground state to the metastable state could be determined to a precision of $\delta R=1\cdot 10^{-11}$, unprecedented in the heavy atom regime. With a lifetime of about 130 days, the potential soft x-ray frequency reference at $\nu=4.86\cdot 10^{16}\,\text{Hz}$ has a linewidth of only $\Delta \nu\approx 5\cdot 10^{-8}\,\text{Hz}$, and one of the highest electronic quality factor ($Q=\frac{\nu}{\Delta \nu}\approx 10^{24}$) ever seen in an experiment. Our low uncertainty enables searching for more HCI soft x-ray clock transitions, needed for promising precision studies of fundamental physics in a thus far unexplored frontier."
https://openalex.org/W3023343150,"Heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is associated with multiple comorbidities, such as old age, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and obesity and is more prevalent in females. Although the male obese ZSF1 rat has been proposed as a suitable model to study the development of diastolic dysfunction and early HFpEF, studies in female animals have not been performed yet. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the cardiac phenotype in female obese ZSF1 rats and their lean counterparts. Additionally, we aimed to investigate whether differences exist in disease progression in obese male and female ZSF1 rats. Therefore, male and female ZSF1 rats, lean as well as obese (N = 6-9/subgroup), were used. Every two weeks, from 12 to 26 weeks of age, systolic blood pressure and echocardiographic measurements were performed, and venous blood was sampled. Female obese ZSF1 rats, as compared to female lean ZSF1 rats, developed diastolic dysfunction with cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in the presence of severe dyslipidemia, increased plasma growth differentiation factor 15 and mild hypertension, and preservation of systolic function. Although obese female ZSF1 rats did not develop hyperglycemia, their diastolic dysfunction was as severe as in the obese males. Taken together, the results from the present study suggest that the female obese ZSF1 rat is a relevant animal model for HFpEF with multiple comorbidities, suitable for investigating novel therapeutic interventions."

Background Segmentation of cardiovascular images is resource-intensive. We design an automated deep learning method for the segmentation of multiple structures from Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) images. Methods Images from a multicenter registry of patients that underwent clinically-indicated CCTA were used. The proximal ascending and descending aorta (PAA, DA), superior and inferior vena cavae (SVC, IVC), pulmonary artery (PA), coronary sinus (CS), right ventricular wall (RVW) and left atrial wall (LAW) were annotated as ground truth. The U-net-derived deep learning model was trained, validated and tested in a 70:20:10 split. Results The dataset comprised 206 patients, with 5.130 billion pixels. Mean age was 59.9 ± 9.4 yrs., and was 42.7% female. An overall median Dice score of 0.820 (0.782, 0.843) was achieved. Median Dice scores for PAA, DA, SVC, IVC, PA, CS, RVW and LAW were 0.969 (0.979, 0.988), 0.953 (0.955, 0.983), 0.937 (0.934, 0.965), 0.903 (0.897, 0.948), 0.775 (0.724, 0.925), 0.720 (0.642, 0.809), 0.685 (0.631, 0.761) and 0.625 (0.596, 0.749) respectively. Apart from the CS, there were no significant differences in performance between sexes or age groups. Conclusions An automated deep learning model demonstrated segmentation of multiple cardiovascular structures from CCTA images with reasonable overall accuracy when evaluated on a pixel level."

In this study, we focused on histone acetylation, one of the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of gene expression, to attempt to clarify the role of polyamines in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. We found that activities of histone acetyltransferases in both the nucleus and cytoplasm decreased significantly in polyamine-reduced mouse mammary carcinoma FM3A cells. Although protein levels of histones H3 and H4 did not change in control and polyamine-reduced cells, acetylation of histones H3 and H4 was greatly decreased in the polyamine-reduced cells. Next, we used control and polyamine-reduced cells to identify histone acetyltransferases whose synthesis is stimulated by polyamines. We found that polyamines stimulate the translation of histone acetyltransferases GCN5 and HAT1. Accordingly, GCN5- and HAT1-catalyzed acetylation of specific lysine residues on histones H3 and H4 was stimulated by polyamines. Consistent with these findings, transcription of genes required for cell proliferation was enhanced by polyamines. These results indicate that polyamines regulate gene expression by enhancing the expression of the histone acetyltransferases GCN5 and HAT1 at the level of translation. Mechanistically, polyamines enhanced the interaction of microRNA-7648-5p (miR-7648-5p) with the 5′-UTR of GCN5 mRNA, resulting in stimulation of translation due to the destabilization of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) between the 5′-UTR and the ORF of GCN5 mRNA.

Because HAT1 mRNA has a short 5′-UTR, polyamines may enhance initiation complex formation directly on this mRNA. Gene expression independent of DNA sequence is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic control of gene expression comprises three pathways: histone modifications, DNA methylation, and RNA-based pathways. A number of different posttranslational modifications are known to occur on histone tails, including acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and sumoylation (1Grunstein M.

Acetylation of lysine residues on histones, in particular, has been shown to play important roles in the regulation of chromatin structure and nucleosome dynamics. The dynamic structural change of chromatin by histone acetylation is linked to cellular processes, including transcriptional activation, DNA damage repair, and cell cycle. Reversible lysine acetylation is regulated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), which add or remove acetyl groups to or from target histones, respectively. HATs and HDACs are also known as transcription coactivators and corepressors. These enzymes are highly conserved from yeast to human. Aberrations of HATs and HDACs have been reported in many diseases, such as cancer. However, the cause of the collapse of the balance between HATs and HDACs remains unknown (3Di Martile M.

In E. coli, using a polyamine-requiring mutant, MA261, it was found that polyamines regulate gene expression because many proteins encoded by the polyamine modulon are transcription factors.

First, polyamines enhance ribosome shunting, which involves discontinuous scanning by 40S ribosomal subunits during the scanning of the 5′-UTR of mRNA. This was observed in Cct2 (T-complex protein 1, β subunit) synthesis. Second, in the 5′-UTR of mRNA, a complementary sequence, consisting of more than five nucleotides, to the nucleotide sequences at the 3′-end of 18S rRNA, i.e. a CR sequence (complementary sequence to 18S rRNA), is normally present at -17 to -32 upstream from the initiation codon AUG. When the CR sequence is located more distally from the initiation codon AUG, e.g. –33 to –39, polyamines stimulated protein synthesis. This was observed in eEF1A (a translation elongation factor). Third, when a microRNA inhibits protein synthesis through the interaction with the complementary sequence in some mRNAs, polyamines release the microRNA from mRNA and stimulate protein synthesis. This was observed in EXT2 (a protein involved in extension of polysaccharide chains) synthesis. Fourth, when an RNA G-quadruplex exists at the 5′-UTR of mRNA, polyamines stimulate protein synthesis through the unfolding of the G-quadruplex. This was observed in CHSY1 (chondroitin synthase 1) synthesis (15Yamaguchi K. Asakura K. Imamura M. Kawai G. Sakamoto T. Furihata T. Linhardt R.J. Igarashi K. Toida T. Higashi K.

The polyamine modulon involved in gene expression has not been identified, and the role of polyamines in gene expression is unknown in eukaryotes. In this study, we have found another two members of the polyamine modulon, Gcn5 and Hat1 histone acetyltransferases. We have studied the physiological functions of polyamines through stimulation of histone acetyltransferase synthesis and the mechanisms by which polyamines stimulate synthesis of these two proteins. We looked for transcription factors in mammalian cells whose synthesis is stimulated by polyamines, because synthesis of many transcription factors in Escherichia coli are stimulated by polyamines at the translational level (6Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Modulation of cellular function by polyamines.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2010; 42 (19643201): 39-5110.1016/j.biocel.2009.07.009Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 7Igarashi K.

However, synthesis of none of the 10 transcription factors was stimulated by polyamines (Fig. S1). We then focused on epigenetic regulation of gene expression and looked for a polyamine modulon among genes encoding histone modification enzymes such as histone acetyltransferases (HATs) (16Lee K.K. Workman J.L. Histone acetyltransferase complexes: one size doesn't fit all.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8 (17380162): 284-29510.1038/nrm2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). For this purpose, HAT activities were first compared in control FM3A cells and DFMO-treated, polyamine-reduced FM3A cells, in which putrescine and spermidine became negligible and spermine decreased to about half of control cells (13Terui Y. Sakamoto A. Yoshida T. Kasahara T. Tomitori H. Higashi K. Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Polyamine stimulation of eEF1A synthesis based on the unusual position of a complementary sequence to 18S rRNA in eEF1A mRNA.Amino Acids. 2015; 47 (25425115): 345-35610.1007/s00726-014-1867-zCrossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, HAT activities in both nuclei and cytoplasm were significantly higher in control cells than in polyamine-reduced cells, when the activity was measured using the mixture of histones as substrates. Under these conditions, the level of histone acetylation (H3 and H4) was higher in control cells than polyamine-reduced cells, although protein levels of H3 and H4 were nearly equal in both cells (Fig. 1B). We searched 13 HATs for proteins whose synthesis is stimulated by polyamines using control and polyamine-reduced cells. As shown in Fig. 2, protein levels of Gcn5 (also known as Kat2a in mouse), located in the nucleus (type A), and Hat1 (also known as Kat1 in mouse), located in the cytoplasm (type B), were higher in control cells than polyamine-reduced cells, although mRNA levels of these proteins did not alter, suggesting that synthesis of Gcn5 and Hat1 was stimulated significantly by polyamines at the level of translation. The degree of polyamine stimulation of both Gcn5 and Hat1 was ∼3-fold. We then sought to determine which lysine was subject to more polyamine-stimulated acetylation. Gcn5 catalyzes acetylation of Lys-9, -14, -18, and -27 in histone H3 and Lys-8 in histone H4. Hat1 catalyzes acetylation of Lys-5 and -12 in histone H4 (Fig. 3A) (17Peterson C.L. Laniel M.A. Histones and histone modifications.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14 (15268870): R546-R55110.1016/j.cub.2004.07.007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, the acetylation of Lys-14 and -27 in histone H3 and that of Lys-5, -8, and -12 in histone H4 was stimulated by polyamines more than 1.5-fold. Stimulation of acetylation of Lys-9 and -18 in histone H3 by polyamines was also significant, although the degree of stimulation was less compared with the acetylation in other Lys residues. Protein levels of H3 and H4 were nearly equal in both cells as shown in Fig. 1B. These results indicate that acetylation by Gcn5 and Hat1 of all lysine residues located in the NH2-terminal region of histones H3 and H4 is stimulated by polyamines. It is expected that synthesis of specific mRNAs which are involved in cell proliferation is stimulated by polyamines through stimulation of Gcn5 and Hat1 synthesis. Consistent with this idea, synthesis of mRNAs encoding Ki-67 protein associated with proliferation (18Scholzen T. Gerdes J. The Ki-67 protein: from the known and the unknown.J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182 (10653597): 311-32210.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(200003)182:3<311::AID-JCP1>3.0.CO;2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar), Lyar (a nucleolar protein with zinc finger DNA binding motif) protein (19Su L.

The degree of polyamine stimulation of these mRNAs was 2- to 3-fold. As a control, the level of RPL30 (ribosomal protein L30) mRNA was measured. Synthesis of RPL30 mRNA was nearly equal in control and polyamine-reduced cells. The results indicate that synthesis of specific mRNAs, which are important for the functions of mouse mammary gland FM3A cells, is increased by polyamines through stimulation of Gcn5 and Hat1 synthesis. Hyperacetylation of histones can open compacted chromatin to induce transcription activation. The correlation between an increase in acetylation in histones H3 and H4 by polyamines and an increase in mRNA synthesis encoding factors involved in proliferation in FM3A cells was examined using a ChIP assay. Chromatin was isolated from control and polyamine-reduced cells, immunoprecipitated with anti-acetyl histone H3 and H4 antibodies, and analyzed with PCR amplification of promoter regions of the specific genes involved in proliferation in FM3A cells. The promoter regions of these genes were searched using the Eukaryotic Promoter Database (RRID:SCR_002485). As shown in Fig. 4B, the promoter regions of Ki-67, Lyar, Pcna, and MCM-2 genes in chromatin immunoprecipitated with antiacetyl histones H3 and H4 antibodies was increased significantly by polyamines. In particular, acetylation of Lys-27 in histone H3 was most strongly enhanced by polyamines (Fig. 3B), and promoters of genes for Lyar, Pcna, and MCM-2 were increased most strongly by polyamines in chromatin immunoprecipitated with anti-H3K27ac antibody (Fig. 4B). As a control, the level of RPL30 promoter in immunoprecipitated chromatin was examined, and it did not alter in control and polyamine-reduced cells. Therefore, synthesis of specific mRNAs that are important for the functions of mouse mammary gland FM3A cells is stimulated by polyamines. These results indicate that polyamines regulate gene expression through stimulation of histone acetylations. To analyze the mechanism of polyamine stimulation, we employed fusion mRNAs containing a 5′-UTR and part of the ORF of Gcn5 or Hat1 mRNA fused to EGFP (enhanced GFP) mRNA. Plasmids encoding fusion mRNAs were transfected into NIH3T3 cells, and the effect of polyamines was examined in control and 500 µm DFMO-treated, polyamine-reduced cells. As shown in Fig. 5, the size of the 5′-UTR of Gcn5 and Hat1 mRNA was 63 and 38 nucleotides, respectively. In the case of Hat1-EGFP, synthesis of the fusion protein from the wide-type (WT) construct was stimulated 3.3-fold by polyamines, similarly to FM3A cells, and the deletion of –28 to –38 or –2 to –30 nucleotides of the 5′-UTR of Hat1 mRNA did not influence the degree of polyamine stimulation of Hat1-EGFP synthesis (Figs. 5C and 5D). These results suggest that the 5′-UTR of Hat1 mRNA is not involved in the translational regulation by polyamines. Since it was previously reported that formation of the initiation complex consisting of mRNA, Met-tRNAi, and 40S ribosomal subunits was enhanced by spermidine, Hat1 synthesis may be stimulated due to the enhancement of initiation complex formation by polyamines (22Shimogori T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Spermidine regulation of protein synthesis at the level of initiation complex formation of Met-tRNAi, mRNA and ribosomes.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223 (8687432): 544-54810.1006/bbrc.1996.0931Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the case of Gcn5-EGFP (Figs. 5A and 5B), synthesis of fusion protein from the WT construct was stimulated 2.7-fold by polyamines, similarly to FM3A cells, and the deletion of –55 to –63, –21 to –54 and –6 to 24 nucleotides of the 5′-UTR of mRNA decreased the degree of stimulation from 2.7-fold to 1.9-, 1.2-, and 1.5-fold, respectively. These results suggest that –21 to –54 nucleotides in the 5′-UTR of Gcn5 mRNA are involved in the polyamine stimulation of Gcn5 synthesis. When this region was removed from Gcn5 mRNA, protein synthetic activity in polyamine-reduced cells increased more than 3-fold, whereas polyamine stimulation almost disappeared. The mechanism of polyamine stimulation of Gcn5 synthesis was studied further. As shown in Fig. 6A, the –21 to –39 nucleotides of the 5′-UTR can interact with the +50 to +70 nucleotides in the ORF of Gcn5 mRNA. This suggests that the scanning of the initiation complex consisting of Met-tRNAi-40S ribosomal subunits may be perturbed. Among microRNAs in mammalian cells, there is a miR-7648-5p, which interacts with the –20 to –39 nucleotides of the 5′-UTR of Gcn5 mRNA (Fig. 6A and 6B). To study the role of miR-7648-5p, two forms of mutated 5′-UTR of Gcn5-EGFP mRNAs were constructed: one interacts more strongly with miR-7648-5p, i.e. C-miR-7648-5p-Gcn5-EGFP mRNA, and the other interacts more weakly with miR-7648-5p, i.e. NC-miR-7648-5p-Gcn5-EGFP mRNA (Fig. 6B). When the NC-miR-7648-5p-Gcn5-EGFP construct was transfected into NIH3T3 cells, Gcn5-EGFP synthesis was greatly reduced with or without polyamines (Fig. 6C and 6D). In contrast, Gcn5-EGFP synthesis was increased ∼2.2-fold in polyamine-reduced cells compared with the WT construct when the C-miR-7648-5p-Gcn5-EGFP construct was transfected into NIH3T3 cells. Accordingly, polyamine stimulation disappeared. From these results, it was hypothesized that miR-7648-5p binds to the 5′-UTR of Gcn5 mRNA and stimulates its translation. To test this hypothesis, microRNA expression plasmid pCMV-MIR7648 or its vector was transfected into NIH3T3 cells for overexpression of miR-7648-5p. As shown in Fig. 7A, polyamine stimulation of Gcn5 synthesis disappeared, although Gcn5 synthesis was enhanced by miR-7648-5p in DFMO-treated, polyamine-reduced cells. In contrast, when NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the vector, Gcn5 synthesis was stimulated 3.2-fold by polyamines, similarly to FM3A cells. In addition, when the pGcn5-EGFP fusion plasmid and pCMV-MIR7648 were cotransfected into NIH3T3 cells, the same results were obtained (Fig. 7B). These results indicate that scanning of the initiation complex was stimulated by weakening the intramolecular interaction between the –21 to –39 and the +50 to +70 nucleotides of Gcn5 mRNA, due to the interaction between the –20 to –39 nucleotides of Gcn5 mRNA and miR-7648-5p and that polyamines enhance the interaction between the –20 to –39 segment of Gcn5 mRNA and miR-7648-5p.Figure 7Effect of miR-7648-5p on polyamine stimulation of Gcn5 synthesis.

This RNA can make a dsRNA with a bulged-out region, which can be recognized by polyamines (Fig. 8A) (23Higashi K. Terui Y. Inomata E. Katagiri D. Nomura Y. Someya T. Nishimura K. Kashiwagi K. Kawai G. Igarashi K. Selective structural change of bulged-out region of double-stranded RNA containing bulged nucleotides by spermidine.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A substantial increase in the relative intensity of the negative band at 208 nm in CD reflects stabilization (or an increase) of the A-form dsRNA (24Nakano S. Kanzaki T. Sugimoto N. Influences of ribonucleotide on a duplex conformation and its thermal stability: study with the chimeric RNA-DNA strands.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126 (14746477): 1088-109510.1021/ja037314hCrossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although this interaction was not enhanced by Mg2+, it was strongly enhanced by spermine in the presence and absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 8C). Similar results were obtained with spermidine. The results suggest that polyamines enhance the interaction between the 5′-UTR of Gcn5 mRNA with miR-7648-5p, resulting in stimulation of translation of Gcn5 mRNA. In this study, to elucidate a mechanism of regulation of gene expression by polyamines in eukaryotes, we looked for new members of the polyamine modulon, which are involved in transcription, because many members of the polyamine modulon are transcription factors in E. coli. However, there was no polyamine modulon among the transcription factors tested. Thus, we started to study the effects of polyamines on the epigenetic control of gene expression. It was found that synthesis of two histone acetyltransferases, Gcn5 and Hat1, was stimulated by polyamines at the level of translation. HATs play an important role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression in eukaryotes and perform both global and specific histone acetylation, as well as acetylation of nonhistone proteins such as transcriptional factors (25Nagy Z. Tora L. Distinct GCN5/PCAF-containing complexes function as co-activators and are involved in transcription factor and global histone acetylation.Oncogene. 2007; 26 (17694077): 5341-535710.1038/sj.onc.1210604Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 26Narita T.

Gcn5 was originally characterized as a transcriptional coactivator, which is thought to be recruited to regulatory gene regions where it contributes to gene activation by acetylation of histones. We found that the acetylation of histone lysine residues (H3 K9, K14, K18, and K27 and H4 K8) that can be acetylated by Gcn5 was increased by polyamines (Fig. 3). In addition, the synthesis of several mRNAs which are important for cell proliferation is stimulated by polyamines (Fig. 4). Hat1 plays an important role in chromatin assembly and DNA damage repair through acetylation of histones (27Parthun M.R. Hat1: the emerging cellular roles of a type B histone acetyltransferase.Oncogene. 2007; 26 (17694075): 5319-532810.1038/sj.onc.1210602Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28Yang X. Li L.

Furthermore, it has been reported that polyamines promote DNA damage repair (29Lee C.Y. Su G.C. Huang W.Y. Ko M.Y. Yeh H.Y. Chang G.D. Lin S.J. Chi P. Promotion of homology-directed DNA repair by polyamines.Nat.

Our results also strongly suggest that polyamines are involved in cellular processes such as DNA damage repair and transcription activation by stimulation of Gcn5 and Hat1 synthesis. The mechanism of polyamine stimulation of synthesis of the two proteins was then studied. In the case of Hat1 synthesis, the size of the 5′-UTR of mRNA was short, i.e. 38 nucleotides, and the 5′-UTR of Hat1 mRNA was not involved in polyamine stimulation of Hat1 synthesis. In the case of Gcn5 synthesis, a microRNA was involved in the polyamine stimulation. Usually, most microRNAs are involved in the inhibition of protein synthesis (31Pillai R.S. Bhattacharyya S.N.

https://openalex.org/W3021174835,"Background In Côte d’Ivoire, induced abortion is legally restricted unless a pregnancy threatens a woman’s life. Yet the limited available evidence suggests abortion is common and that unsafe abortion is contributing to the country’s high maternal mortality. Our study aimed to estimate the one-year incidence of induced abortion in Côte d’Ivoire using both direct and indirect methodologies, determine the safety of reported abortions, and identify the women most likely to experience a recent induced abortion or an unsafe abortion. Methods In 2018, we conducted a nationally representative, population-based survey of women age 15 to 49 in Côte d’Ivoire. Women reported their own abortion experiences and those of their closest female confidante. We estimated the one-year incidence of induced abortion, and the safety of the abortions women experienced. Using bivariate and multivariate regression, we separately assessed sociodemographic characteristics associated with having had a recent abortion or an unsafe abortion. Results Overall, 2,738 women participated in the survey, approximately two-thirds of whom reported on the abortion experiences of their closest female friend. Based on respondent data, the one-year incidence of induced abortion was 27.9 (95% CI 18.6–37.1) per 1,000 women of reproductive age, while the confidante incidence was higher at 40.7 (95% CI 33.3–48.1) per 1,000. Among respondents, 62.4% of abortions were most unsafe, while 78.5% of confidante abortions were most unsafe. Adolescents, less educated women, and the poorest women had the most unsafe abortions. Conclusion This study provides the first national estimates of induced abortion incidence and safety in Côte d’Ivoire, using a population-based approach to explore social determinants of abortion and unsafe abortion. Consistent with other research, our results suggest that legal restrictions on abortion in Côte d’Ivoire are not preventing women from having abortions, but rather pushing women to use unsafe, potentially dangerous abortion methods. Efforts to reduce the harms of unsafe abortion are urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W3021624387,"The complement system is a tightly controlled proteolytic cascade in the innate immune system, which tags intruding pathogens and dying host cells for clearance. An essential protein in this process is complement component C3. Uncontrolled complement activation has been implicated in several human diseases and disorders and has spurred the development of therapeutic approaches that modulate the complement system. Here, using purified proteins and several biochemical assays and surface plasmon resonance, we report that our nanobody, hC3Nb2, inhibits C3 deposition by all complement pathways. We observe that the hC3Nb2 nanobody binds human native C3 and its degradation products with low nanomolar affinity and does not interfere with the endogenous regulation of C3b deposition mediated by Factors H and I. Using negative stain EM analysis and functional assays, we demonstrate that hC3Nb2 inhibits the substrate–convertase interaction by binding to the MG3 and MG4 domains of C3 and C3b. Furthermore, we notice that hC3Nb2 is cross-reactive and inhibits the lectin and alternative pathway in murine serum. We conclude that hC3Nb2 is a potent, general, and versatile inhibitor of the human and murine complement cascades. Its cross-reactivity suggests that this nanobody may be valuable for analysis of complement activation within animal models of both acute and chronic diseases. The complement system is a tightly controlled proteolytic cascade in the innate immune system, which tags intruding pathogens and dying host cells for clearance.

Uncontrolled complement activation has been implicated in several human diseases and disorders and has spurred the development of therapeutic approaches that modulate the complement system. Here, using purified proteins and several biochemical assays and surface plasmon resonance, we report that our nanobody, hC3Nb2, inhibits C3 deposition by all complement pathways. We observe that the hC3Nb2 nanobody binds human native C3 and its degradation products with low nanomolar affinity and does not interfere with the endogenous regulation of C3b deposition mediated by Factors H and I. Using negative stain EM analysis and functional assays, we demonstrate that hC3Nb2 inhibits the substrate–convertase interaction by binding to the MG3 and MG4 domains of C3 and C3b. Furthermore, we notice that hC3Nb2 is cross-reactive and inhibits the lectin and alternative pathway in murine serum. We conclude that hC3Nb2 is a potent, general, and versatile inhibitor of the human and murine complement cascades. Its cross-reactivity suggests that this nanobody may be valuable for analysis of complement activation within animal models of both acute and chronic diseases. The complement system is a prominent part of our innate immune system and serves as a first line of defense through opsonization and lysis of intruding pathogens. Likewise, complement contributes to the clearance of dying host cells, which is crucial in homeostasis and minimizes the development of autoimmune diseases (1Merle N.S. Noe R. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Fremeaux-Bacchi V. Roumenina L.T. Complement system part II: role in immunity.Front. Immunol. 2015; 6 (26074922): 25710.3389/fimmu.2015.00257Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The system also plays a role in development and aids the sculpting of the early developing brain by promoting the pruning of excess synapses (2Stephan A.H. Barres B.A. Stevens B. The complement system: an unexpected role in synaptic pruning during development and disease.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 35 (22715882): 369-38910.1146/annurev-neuro-061010-113810Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Complement is activated through three pathways, the classical pathway (CP), the lectin pathway (LP), and the alternative pathway (AP). The complement cascade may be triggered upon binding of pattern-recognizing molecules (PRMs) to pathogen-associated molecular patterns and danger-associated molecular patterns presented on the activating surface. In the CP, the PRM C1q detects antibody-antigen complexes and multiple other patterns (3Kojouharova M. Reid K. Gadjeva M. New insights into the molecular mechanisms of classical complement activation.Mol. Immunol. 2010; 47 (20542571): 2154-216010.1016/j.molimm.2010.05.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas five different PRMs of the LP recognize specific carbohydrate structures or patterns of acetyl groups (4Kjaer T.R. Thiel S. Andersen G.R. Toward a structure-based comprehension of the lectin pathway of complement.Mol. Immunol. 2013; 56 (23810291): 222-23110.1016/j.molimm.2013.05.220Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Serine proteases associated with the PRMs cleave complement factor C4 (C4) and C2, leading to the appearance of the classical pathway C3 convertase C4b2a formed by C4b and the active serine protease C2a on the activator surface (5Bajic G. Degn S.E. Thiel S. Andersen G.R. Complement activation, regulation, and molecular basis for complement-related diseases.EMBO J. 2015; 34 (26489954): 2735-275710.15252/embj.201591881Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). This C3 convertase cleaves C3 into C3b and the anaphylatoxin C3a. The C3b deposited on the activator associates with Factor B (FB) to form the AP proconvertase C3bB that, upon activation by Factor D (FD), gives rise to the active AP C3 convertase, C3bBb (Fig. 1A). The alternative pathway strongly amplifies the outcome of the CP and LP (6Harboe M. Garred P. Karlstrøm E. Lindstad J.K. Stahl G.L. Mollnes T.E. The down-stream effects of mannan-induced lectin complement pathway activation depend quantitatively on alternative pathway amplification.Mol.

Here, the thioester of C3 hydrolyzes, which induces structural rearrangements in C3 giving rise to C3(H2O), a functional homologue of C3b. This allows for the association with FB and ultimately the formation of a fluid-phase AP C3 convertase, C3(H2O)Bb (8Bexborn F. Andersson P.O. Chen H. Nilsson B. Ekdahl K.N. The tick-over theory revisited: formation and regulation of the soluble alternative complement C3 convertase (C3(H2O)Bb).Mol.

Once C3b reaches a threshold surface density on the activator, the C3 convertases switch substrate specificity to C5. The appearance of these C5 convertases, which cleave C5 into C5b and the potent anaphylatoxin C5a, demarcates the initiation of the terminal pathway. C5b nucleates the assembly of the membrane attack complex that perforates and lyses pathogens (9Heesterbeek D.A.C. Angelier M.L. Harrison R.A. Rooijakkers S.H.M. Complement and bacterial infections: from molecular mechanisms to therapeutic applications.J. Innate Immun. 2018; 10 (30149378): 455-46410.1159/000491439Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On healthy host cells, the terminal pathway is not activated because deposited C3b is rapidly degraded to iC3b by Factor I (FI) with the help of the co-factors factor H (FH), membrane cofactor protein (MCP/CD46), and complement receptor 1 (CR1). The resulting iC3b is incapable of forming a C3 convertase with FB. Additionally, decay acceleration factor (DAF/CD55), CR1, and FH irreversibly dissociate the AP C3 convertase (5Bajic G. Degn S.E. Thiel S. Andersen G.R. Complement activation, regulation, and molecular basis for complement-related diseases.EMBO J. 2015; 34 (26489954): 2735-275710.15252/embj.201591881Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In contrast, properdin, also known as Factor P, is the only positive regulator of the AP C3 and C5 convertases and acts by stimulating AP proconvertase assembly, inhibiting AP convertase dissociation, and competing with FI for binding to C3b (10Pedersen D.V.

Mutations in AP components are associated with the development of a number of diseases, including the chronic renal diseases C3 glomerulopathies (C3G) and atypical hemolytic uraemic syndrome (12Smith R.J.H.

In the chronic disease paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), dysregulation of the terminal pathway due to mutations in genes required for glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor synthesis leads to erythrocyte lysis (15Hill A.

Furthermore, complement activation has also been linked to multiple neurological diseases, including schizophrenia (16Sekar A. Bialas A.R. de Rivera H. Davis A. Hammond T.R. Kamitaki N. Tooley K.

In addition to these chronic diseases, the complement system plays a cardinal role in the progression of various acute diseases, such as ischemia-reperfusion injury (18Mastellos D.C. Ricklin D. Lambris J.D. Clinical promise of next-generation complement therapeutics.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2019; 18 (31324874): 707-72910.1038/s41573-019-0031-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). With the aim of controlling such dysregulated complement in patients, a plethora of different molecules, targeting receptors, proteases, and their substrates, have been developed (19Zelek W.M. Xie L. Morgan B.P. Harris C.L. Compendium of current complement therapeutics.Mol. Immunol. 2019; 114 (31446305): 341-35210.1016/j.molimm.2019.07.030Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have recently described the first nanobody (Nb)-based complement modulator, called hC3Nb1, that inhibits the AP in both human and murine serum (20Jensen R.K. Pihl R. Gadeberg T.A.F. Jensen J.K. Andersen K.R. Thiel S. Laursen N.S. Andersen G.R. A potent complement factor C3 specific nanobody inhibiting multiple functions in the alternative pathway of human and murine complement.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 (29497000): 6269-628110.1074/jbc.RA117.001179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Nbs originate from the VHH domain of the heavy chain–only antibodies present in camelids. However, hC3Nb1 only exerts subtle effects on C3 cleavage by the CP C3 convertase, thus limiting the use of the Nb in the assessment of CP- and LP-driven diseases. Furthermore, hC3Nb1 prevents FI degradation of C3b, which may be undesirable for in vivo applications. We thus set out to develop a C3-specific Nb that broadly inhibits complement through complete shutdown of the cascade, while still allowing negative regulation of C3b on host cells. Here we describe hC3Nb2, which binds C3, C3b, and a C3(H2O) mimic with low nanomolar affinity. The Nb inhibits both the AP and CP C3 convertase in human serum without interfering with the degradation of C3b to iC3b and is also cross-reactive with mouse C3 and is functional in murine serum. Through a combination of biochemical assays and negative stain EM (nsEM), we rationalize that hC3Nb2 exerts its function through inhibition of substrate binding to C3 convertases. We thus present a potent complement-specific nanobody, suitable for studies of the complement pathway in human diseases and murine models that may develop into a candidate for therapeutic control of complement-driven pathogenesis. We previously described the generation of a phage library presenting C3-specific nanobodies after immunization of a llama with human C3b. From this library, we selected nanobodies against immobilized human C3b. Using this approach, we not only selected the AP inhibitor, hC3Nb1 (20Jensen R.K. Pihl R. Gadeberg T.A.F. Jensen J.K. Andersen K.R. Thiel S. Laursen N.S. Andersen G.R. A potent complement factor C3 specific nanobody inhibiting multiple functions in the alternative pathway of human and murine complement.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 (29497000): 6269-628110.1074/jbc.RA117.001179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), but also the hC3Nb2 nanobody presented here. First, we tested the effect of hC3Nb2 in classical and lectin pathway assays conducted in ELISA plates coated with either aggregated IgG or mannan. We compared the hC3Nb2 nanobody with our AP inhibitor hC3Nb1 and quantified the inhibition of the pathways by measuring the C3 fragments deposited on the surface. In our CP assay, we observed that, in contrast to the AP-specific hC3Nb1, the hC3Nb2 nanobody inhibits the C3 fragment deposition upon activation of the classical pathway when present in molar excess compared with C3 (Fig. 1B). Similarly, the nanobody inhibits C3 fragment deposition through the lectin pathway, indicating that hC3Nb2 inhibits C3 cleavage by the C4bC2a C3 convertase generated through the CP and the LP (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the AP-specific hC3Nb1 nanobody has only a very modest effect on this convertase. We proceeded to test the effect of the nanobody in an assay in which zymosan drives activation of the AP at conditions where the CP and LP are nonfunctional. This assay revealed that the nanobody also inhibits the alternative pathway in both human and mouse serum (Fig. 1, D and E). To confirm the cross-reactivity of the nanobody, we tested the effect of the nanobody in the lectin pathway in murine serum (Fig. 1F). Similar to the lectin pathway in human serum, hC3Nb2 inhibited the progression of the murine lectin pathway. Overall, these assays showed that hC3Nb2 is a broad inhibitor of the complement system capable of inhibiting C3 cleavage in all three pathways. Next, we tested whether the inhibitory effect of the nanobody extends to hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes onto which classical pathway activity was induced with rabbit anti-sheep erythrocyte antibodies. We incubated the antibody-decorated cells in normal human serum (NHS) in the presence or absence of hC3Nb2. Again, we compared the effect to hC3Nb1 to confirm that the effect of hC3Nb2 was due to inhibition of the classical pathway, because hC3Nb1 effectively inhibits generation of C3b through the AP. In accordance with the observation that hC3Nb2 inhibits the classical pathway–mediated deposition of C3, the nanobody also inhibited the lysis of the sheep erythrocytes at concentrations exceeding that of C3 in the assay (Fig. 2A). The nanobody inhibited the hemolysis to ∼15% at a concentration of 1 µm in these assay conditions where C3 was present at 0.4 µm. When hC3Nb2 was replaced by the AP-specific inhibitor hC3Nb1 or its inactive derivative hC3Nb1 W102A, no inhibition of lysis was observed, indicating that AP amplification played an insignificant role in this hemolysis assay. To confirm that the CP was the dominating driver of hemolysis in this assay, we also conducted the hemolysis assay in FB-depleted serum in which AP amplification is absent (Fig. 2B). Again, hC3Nb2 inhibited the hemolysis when present in molar excess to C3, and the remaining lysis plateaued at ∼15%. These lysis experiments demonstrated that in addition to preventing C3 deposition, hC3Nb2 is a potent inhibitor of the progression of the complement cascade from the classical pathway to the terminal pathway. The C3b deposition and hemolysis assays in Figure 1, Figure 2 indicate that a 1:1 molar ratio between hC3Nb2 and the C3 is needed for efficient inhibition of complement. However, the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) as well as the rate constants for binding and dissociation are other key parameters for evaluating the potential of an inhibitory antibody. We assessed these constants by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Here, hC3Nb2 was immobilized as ligand, utilizing a biotinylated C-terminal AviTag for binding to a streptavidin-coated chip. Increasing concentrations in the range of 5-60 nm of C3, C3b, and the C3(H2O) analog C3MA were injected as analytes over the chip. The rate and dissociation constants for complex formation with hC3Nb2 were determined by fitting the binding curves to a 1:1 binding mode (Fig. 3, A–D). The nanobody binds the three functional states of C3 with similar dissociation constants in the low nanomolar range (Fig. 3D). The off-rates were likewise similar between the three states and were on the order of 10−4 s−1. These SPR data showed that the nanobody binds with high affinity to a structurally conserved epitope present in C3, C3b, and the C3 tick-over mimic C3MA. We next analyzed the binding of hC3Nb2 to murine C3b. To this end, we coated bio-layer interferometry (BLI) sensors with biotinylated hC3Nb2 and transferred the sensors to wells containing murine C3b at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 6.25 nm. Similar to the SPR data, we fitted the sensorgrams to a 1:1 binding mode (Fig. S1A). These data revealed that hC3Nb2 binds murine C3b with sub-nanomolar affinity (Fig. 3D). To allow direct comparison with binding to human C3b, we performed a parallel BLI experiment with human C3b and similarly fitted the data in a 1:1 model (Fig. S1B). Collectively, these data confirmed that the hC3Nb2 binds with similar affinity to murine and human C3b (Fig. 3D). Based on the similarity of dissociation constants for hC3Nb2 interaction with human C3 degradation fragments, we predict that the hC3Nb2 exhibits comparable affinities toward degradation products of murine C3. The hC3Nb2 nanobody was selected against human C3b and inhibits both CP mediated C3 deposition and hemolysis (Figure 1, Figure 2). Together with the strong binding to native C3 observed by SPR, these data prompted the hypothesis that hC3Nb2 inhibits the C3 cleavage on the C3 substrate level rather than on the product level, because C3b has no function in the CP C3 convertase. To challenge this model, we tested whether the nanobody inhibits C3 cleavage by the alternative pathway analog, Cobra venom factor Bb (CVFBb). We assembled and activated CVFB with Factor D prior to mixing with C3 in the presence or absence of a 2-fold excess of hC3Nb2. Here, we observed that the nanobody potently inhibits the C3 cleavage, which was completed within the first 30 min in the absence of the nanobody but barely detectable after 24 h in the presence of hC3Nb2 (Fig. 4A). To preclude the possibility that this effect was due to hC3Nb2 interaction with CVF, we investigated their interaction by SPR. Again, hC3Nb2 was immobilized as ligand on the chip while CVF was applied as analyte. Sensorgrams obtained in the presence of CVF were indistinguishable from buffer control sensorgrams, indicating that the nanobody does not interact with CVF (Fig. S2). In summary, the data obtained with CVF confirmed the model that hC3Nb2 inhibits the C3 cleavage on the substrate level. Prompted by the observation that the hC3Nb2 inhibits the C3 cleavage on substrate level by the C3 convertases, we turned to analyze its effect on the alternative pathway convertase. This is more difficult, because C3 is the substrate of the convertase and C3b is the noncatalytic subunit of the AP C3 convertase. We first tested whether the nanobody inhibits the assembly of the AP convertase because our hC3Nb1 has this effect (20Jensen R.K. Pihl R. Gadeberg T.A.F. Jensen J.K. Andersen K.R. Thiel S. Laursen N.S. Andersen G.R. A potent complement factor C3 specific nanobody inhibiting multiple functions in the alternative pathway of human and murine complement.J. Biol.

For the assembly of the AP C3 proconvertase, we used FB comprising the S699A and the D279G mutations; whereas the S699A renders the FB proteolytically inactive, the D279G mutation extends the t½ of the convertase (21Roumenina L.T. Jablonski M. Hue C. Blouin J. Dimitrov J.D. Dragon-Durey M.A. Cayla M. Fridman W.H. Macher M.A. Ribes D. Moulonguet L. Rostaing L. Satchell S.C. Mathieson P.W. Sautes-Fridman C. et al.Hyperfunctional C3 convertase leads to complement deposition on endothelial cells and contributes to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.Blood. 2009; 114 (19584399): 2837-284510.1182/blood-2009-01-197640Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We incubated the FB S699A/D279G with C3b in the absence or presence of a 2-fold molar excess of hC3Nb2. A subsequent size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis (Fig. 4B) indicated that the nanobody allows the assembly of the proconvertase, as indicated by a slightly earlier elution of the proconvertase in the presence of hC3Nb2. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed the presence of a ternary complex of C3b, FB, and hC3Nb2 in the SEC peak fractions (Fig. 4C). To validate the SEC results in an orthogonal approach, we performed a BLI-based assessment of the effect of hC3Nb2 on proconvertase assembly. To this end, we immobilized hC3Nb2 on BLI sensors and loaded C3b from the well. Next, we applied FB (D279G) to the nanobody-bound C3b, which resulted in a marked increase in the signal compared with C3b alone (Fig. 4D). This confirms that the FB- and hC3Nb2-binding sites do not compete and underscores that the nanobody does not prevent the AP C3 convertase assembly. The data presented thus far show that hC3Nb2 is a potent inhibitor of C3 cleavage through the three activation pathways. However, a potential inhibition of the endogenous regulatory function undertaken by FI could result in an accumulation of C3b on activating surfaces. In an in vivo setting, such an accumulation may result in a burst of AP activation under conditions where the hC3Nb2 concentration becomes too low and the activity of the endogenous complement regulators is insufficient for FI degradation of host cell bound C3b to iC3b. Our AP-specific hC3Nb1 potently inhibits FI degradation (20Jensen R.K. Pihl R. Gadeberg T.A.F. Jensen J.K. Andersen K.R. Thiel S. Laursen N.S. Andersen G.R. A potent complement factor C3 specific nanobody inhibiting multiple functions in the alternative pathway of human and murine complement.J. Biol.

Maximal inhibition of complement at the C3 level would occur if the C3 cleavage was inhibited while the degradation of C3b to iC3b could still proceed. To test whether hC3Nb2 allows such C3b degradation, we mixed C3b with Factor H and Factor I and monitored the C3b cleavage in a time course experiment by SDS-PAGE. This showed that hC3Nb2 allows the FH-assisted cleavage by FI (Fig. 4E), as evident by the similar progress of C3b degradation in the absence and presence of hC3Nb2. However, if FI cleavage itself is the rate-limiting step in this assay, this approach may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect a partial interference by hC3Nb2 with FH binding to C3b that may have undesirable consequences in vivo. To investigate in an FI-independent manner whether the nanobody interferes with the FH-C3b interaction, we used a BLI competition assay to evaluate whether hC3Nb2 and FH can bind simultaneously to C3b. Similar to our BLI-based FB competition assay, we immobilized hC3Nb2 on BLI sensors, dipped the sensors in C3b, and transferred the sensors to FH. The BLI binding curves displayed in Fig. 4D document that hC3Nb2 and FH do not compete for binding to C3b. This indicates that hC3Nb2 does not interfere with the function of FH with respect to FI degradation. To gain further insight into the inhibitory mechanism of hC3Nb2, we performed nsEM. To this end, we first isolated the hC3Nb2:C3c complex by SEC and obtained the complex from the early peak fractions. We applied the complex to EM grids and stained with uranyl formate. The 2D class averages obtained from micrographs recorded from these grids displayed recognizable features of C3c, including the C345c domain and the macroglobulin (MG) ring (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, hC3Nb2 could clearly be recognized as a density protruding from the MG ring on the “back” of the C3c MG ring opposite the C345c domain (Fig. 5A). To determine the domains involved in the interaction, stochastic gradient descent was used to generate an initial reference model, which was used for 3D classification and subsequent refinement. This gave rise to a high-quality 3D reconstruction with a good distribution of views (Fig. S3, A and B). Similar to the 2D class averages, the 3D reconstruction revealed clear density for the C345c domain and the MG ring (Fig. 5B). After rigid-body fitting of the crystal structure of C3c (22Janssen B.J. Huizinga E.G. Raaijmakers H.C. Roos A. Daha M.R. Nilsson-Ekdahl K. Nilsson B. Gros P. Structures of complement component C3 provide insights into the function and evolution of immunity.Nature. 2005; 437 (16177781): 505-51110.1038/nature04005Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) into the 3D reconstruction, a clear density remained that was not occupied by C3c but matches the dimension of a nanobody (Fig. 5C). The density was present on the back of the MG ring, in agreement with the 2D class averages. The 3D reconstruction further revealed that hC3Nb2 binds at the interface between MG3 and MG4, with the major part of the epitope being present in the MG3 domain (Fig. 5C). To assess whether the hC3Nb2 epitope is conserved between different C3 fragments, the nsEM experiment was repeated using C3b instead of C3c. The data gave rise to 2D class averages where the MG ring, C345c, TE domain, and hC3Nb2 could easily be recognized (Fig. S4A). However, the 2D class averages also show that the hC3Nb2:C3b complex has a high tendency toward preferred orientations on the carbon-coated grid. This is also evident in the resulting 3D reconstruction, which severely limits the final resolution (Fig. S4, B–E). C3b can still be reliably rigid body–fitted into the 3D reconstruction, and comparison with the hC3Nb2:C3c complex reveals that hC3Nb2 binds the same epitope in both C3 fragments (Fig. S4, F and G). We next investigated whether an hC3Nb2 epitope on the back of C3b with contributions from the MG3 and MG4 domains could explain our functional data.

In the same manner, the suggested epitope agrees with the observation that the hC3Nb2 does not interfere with FH association and FI degradation (Fig. 4, D and E).

We performed an analysis to assess the cost-effectiveness of RAM from a Chinese perspective and recognized the range of drug costs.By building a Markov model to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life-years (LYs) and lifetime costs. Transition probabilities, costs and utilities were estimated for the published literature, Chinese health care system and local price setting. We performed threshold analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to evaluate the uncertainty of the model.Compared with PLA strategy, RAM strategy provided an incremental survival benefit of 1.22 LYs and 0.64 QALYs. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that when RAM costs less than $151 or $753 per 4 weeks, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) approximated the willingness-to-pay threshold (WTP), suggesting that there was 50% likelihood that the ICER for RAM + PAC would be less than $44528.4 per QALY or $48121 per QALY, respectively.For patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who fail first-line chemotherapy, our results are conducive to the multilateral drug price guidance negotiations of RAM in China."
https://openalex.org/W3021612871,"Measuring health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with chronic low back pain (LBP) is crucial to monitor and improve the patients' health status through effective rehabilitation. While the 12-item short-form health survey (SF-12) was developed as a shorter alternative to the 36-item short-form health survey for assessing HRQOL in large-scale studies, to date, no cross-culturally adapted and validated Hausa version exists. This study aimed to translate and cross-culturally adapt the SF-12 into Hausa language, and test its psychometric properties in mixed urban and rural Nigerian populations with chronic LBP.The Hausa version of the SF-12 was developed following the guidelines of the International Quality of Life Assessment project. Fifteen patients with chronic LBP recruited from urban and rural communities of Nigeria pre-tested the Hausa SF-12. A consecutive sample of 200 patients with chronic LBP recruited from urban and rural clinics of Nigeria completed the instrument, among which 100 respondents re-tested the instrument after two weeks. Factorial structure and invariance were assessed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multi-group CFA respectively. Multi-trait scaling analysis (for convergent and divergent validity) and known-groups validity were performed to assess construct validity. Composite reliability (CR), internal consistency (Cronbach's α), intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and Bland-Altman plots were computed to assess reliability.After the CFA of the original conceptual SF-12 model, 2 redundant items were removed and 4 error terms were allowed to covary, thus providing adequate fit to the sample. The refined model demonstrated good fit and evidence of factorial invariance in three demographic groups (age, gender, and habitation). Convergent (11:12; 91% success rate) and divergent (10:12; 83% success rate) validity were satisfactory. Known-groups comparison showed that the instrument discriminated well for those who differed in age (p < 0.05) but in gender and habitation (p > 0.05). The physical component summary and the mental component summary demonstrated acceptable CR (0.69 and 0.79 respectively), internal consistency (α = 0.73 and 0.78 respectively), test-rest reliability (ICC = 0.79 and 0.85 respectively), and good agreement between test-retest values.The Hausa SF-12 was successfully developed and showed evidence of factorial invariance across age, gender, and habitation. The instrument demonstrated satisfactory construct validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. However, stronger psychometric properties need to be established in general population and other patients groups in future studies. The instrument can be used clinically and for research in Hausa-speaking patients with chronic LBP."

Despite this obvious significance, the cellular machineries that control the trafficking of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors in the central nervous system have not been studied in detail. The post-synaptic scaffolding protein tamalin has been shown to interact with group I mGluRs and also with many other proteins involved in protein trafficking in neurons. Using a molecular replacement approach in mouse hippocampal neurons, we show here that tamalin plays a critical role in the ligand-dependent internalization of mGluR1 and mGluR5, members of the group I mGluR family. Specifically, knockdown of endogenous tamalin inhibited the ligand-dependent internalization of these two receptors. Both N-terminal and C-terminal regions of tamalin played critical roles in mGluR1 endocytosis. Furthermore, we found that tamalin regulates mGluR1 internalization by interacting with S-SCAM, a protein that has been implicated in vesicular trafficking.

Therefore, trafficking of these receptors, which is a tightly regulated process, controls both the spatiotemporal localization and activity of these receptors. Despite the obvious significance of trafficking of mGluRs, the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes are not well understood. Group I mGluRs are tightly regulated by a macromolecular protein complex at the post-synaptic membrane, a key component of which is the scaffolding protein tamalin. Tamalin is a 394-amino-acid protein comprising multiple protein-protein interaction domains. It is composed of a PDZ domain, a proline-rich region, a leucine zipper region, and a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. The PDZ domain of tamalin interacts with the C terminus of group I mGluRs (23Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. Tamalin, a PDZ domain-containing protein, links a protein complex formation of group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor cytohesins.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-128910.1523/JNEUROSCI.22-04-01280.2002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, tamalin also interacts with many other important scaffold proteins involved in post-synaptic organization and protein trafficking in neurons. For example, tamalin binds to PSD-95 and also interacts with proteins implicated in trafficking, including MINT2 and GRP-1 (24Kitano J. Yamazaki Y. Kimura K. Masukado T. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. Tamalin is a scaffold protein that interacts with multiple neuronal proteins in distinct modes of protein-protein association.J. Biol.

The C terminus of tamalin interacts with S-SCAM, another scaffolding protein which directly interacts with motor proteins and thus regulates cargo delivery to and from the membrane (24Kitano J. Yamazaki Y. Kimura K. Masukado T. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. Tamalin is a scaffold protein that interacts with multiple neuronal proteins in distinct modes of protein-protein association.J. Biol.

In light of all the above observations, we investigated the role of tamalin, if any, in the trafficking of group I mGluRs in primary hippocampal neurons. We studied the role of tamalin in ligand-mediated trafficking of group I mGluRs using a “molecular replacement” approach that allows simultaneous shRNA-mediated acute knockdown of endogenous tamalin and expression of various forms of recombinant tamalin in primary hippocampal neurons (22Sharma R. Gulia R. Bhattacharyya S. A critical role for sorting nexin 1 in the trafficking of metabotropic glutamate receptors.J.

First, developmental compensatory adaptations that may occur during synaptogenesis and synapse maturation as a result of the loss of endogenous tamalin are minimized. Second, the function of heterologous constructs can be studied without the necessity of a dominant effect, which is required by a standard overexpression approach. We show here that tamalin plays a critical role in the trafficking of mGluR1 and mGluR5. We observed that knockdown of the endogenous tamalin led to the inhibition in the ligand-mediated endocytosis of these receptors. Both N-terminal and C-terminal regions of tamalin were critical for the internalization of mGluR1. Importantly, tamalin regulated the endocytosis of mGluR1 through interaction with S-SCAM. Knockdown of S-SCAM also resulted in the inhibition of the ligand-dependent endocytosis of group I mGluRs. Finally, we show that tamalin also controls mGluR-mediated AMPAR internalization, which is the cellular correlate for the mGluR-dependent synaptic plasticity, through interaction with S-SCAM. In order to investigate the role of tamalin in the trafficking of group I mGluRs, we employed the molecular replacement strategy. This strategy allows simultaneous shRNA-mediated acute knockdown of the endogenous tamalin and expression of mutant forms of recombinant tamalin in primary hippocampal neurons. To examine the role of tamalin in the ligand-induced endocytosis of mGluR1, we initially screened and identified a shRNA against tamalin (shTam) that could effectively knock down the endogenous tamalin. In the cultured neurons, the shTam construct was effective in knocking down endogenous tamalin, as evidenced by the significant knockdown of the endogenous tamalin measured through Western blotting 3 to 4 days after transfection (control, 1 ± 0.04; shTam, 0.55 ± 0.09; shTam:Tam, 1.15 ± 0.1) (Fig. 1, A and B). We then examined the effect of tamalin knockdown on the surface expression of Myc-mGluR1. shTam-mediated knockdown of tamalin did not have any effect on the surface expression of Myc-mGluR1 (Fig. 1, C and D). In addition, simultaneous expression of both shTam and HA-tagged WT tamalin (shTam resistant) also had no effect on the surface expression of Myc-mGluR1 (control, 1 ± 0.06; shTam, 1.02 ± 0.05; shTam:Tam, 1.02 ± 0.04) (Fig. 1, C and D). We subsequently investigated the effect of the knockdown of endogenous tamalin on the ligand-mediated trafficking of Myc-mGluR1. Primary hippocampal neurons were cotransfected with Myc-mGluR1 and shTam or shTam:Tam constructs. Live cells expressing Myc-mGluR1 were stained with anti-Myc primary antibody. Subsequent application of 100 μm R,S-DHPG, an agonist of mGluR1, led to the internalization of Myc-mGluR1 at 30 min in control cells. However, cells expressing shTam did not show significant internalized receptors on 100 μm R,S-DHPG application at 30 min, and most of the receptors were observed to be localized at the cell surface (control, 1 ± 0.03; control + DHPG, 1.77 ± 0.06; shTam + DHPG, 1.09 ± 0.05) (Fig. 1, E and F). Replacement of the endogenous tamalin with WT tamalin (shTam resistant) rescued the normal endocytosis of the receptor, as was evident from the presence of the endocytosed receptors in the intracellular compartments at 30 min after 100 μm R,S-DHPG application (shTam:Tam + DHPG, 1.81 ± 0.08), indicating that the observed phenotype was not due to nonspecific effects of shTam (Fig. 1, E and F). We chose 30 min as the time point because our previous studies suggested that R,S-DHPG-mediated internalization of Myc-mGluR1 reaches a maximum level at 30 min after ligand application (20Pandey S. Mahato P.K. Bhattacharyya S. Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 recycles to the cell surface in protein phosphatase 2A-dependent manner in non-neuronal and neuronal cell lines.J.

On the other hand, the inhibition of the R,S-DHPG-mediated internalization of Myc-mGluR1 due to the knockdown of the endogenous tamalin could not be rescued by replacing the endogenous tamalin with another post-synaptic density protein that interacts with the group I mGluRs, Norbin, suggesting the specificity of the rescue experiment (control, 1 ± 0.05; control + DHPG, 1.58 ± 0.09; shTam + DHPG, 0.95 ± 0.03; shTam:Norbin + DHPG, 1.13 ± 0.06) (Fig. S1, A and B) (27Wang H.

Norbin is an endogenous regulator of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 signaling.Science. 2009; 326 (20007903): 1554-155710.1126/science.1178496Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We subsequently investigated the role of tamalin, if any, in the ligand-mediated endocytosis of the other member of the group I mGluR family, viz., mGluR5. Knockdown of the endogenous tamalin had no effect on the surface expression of Myc-mGluR5 (control, 1 ± 0.04; shTam, 0.98 ± 0.04; shTam:Tam, 0.98 ± 0.06) (Fig. S2, A and B). On the other hand, 100 μm R,S-DHPG-mediated internalization of Myc-mGluR5 was inhibited upon knockdown of the endogenous tamalin and replacement of the endogenous tamalin with WT tamalin rescued the normal internalization of the receptor (control, 1 ± 0.05; control + DHPG, 2 ± 0.06; shTam + DHPG, 1.03 ± 0.04; shTam:Tam + DHPG, 1.96 ± 0.05) (Fig. S2, C and D). These results suggest that tamalin plays a critical role in the ligand-mediated internalization of both members of group I mGluRs, viz., mGluR1 and mGluR5. Since trafficking of both mGluR1 and mGluR5 was regulated by tamalin, we concentrated on mGluR1 for rest of the study. Tamalin is a scaffold protein that comprises multiple protein-interacting domains (23Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-128910.1523/JNEUROSCI.22-04-01280.2002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the PDZ domain of tamalin binds to the carboxyl-terminal tail of group I mGluRs, and the leucine zipper region of tamalin binds the coiled-coil region of guanine nucleotide exchange factor cytohesins (23Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. Tamalin, a PDZ domain-containing protein, links a protein complex formation of group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor cytohesins.J.

In order to determine the role of tamalin in group I mGluR trafficking, we first investigated the effect of various deletion mutants of tamalin in mGluR1 trafficking. To examine whether the N-terminal region of tamalin is sufficient for the normal trafficking of group I mGluRs, we first replaced the endogenous tamalin with a form of tamalin (N-Tam) having only the N-terminal region (amino acids 1 to 209 of tamalin) and lacking the C-terminal region of the protein. N-Tam was observed to have normal expression levels in primary neurons (control, 1 ± 0.11; shTam, 0.47 ± 0.21; shTam:N-Tam, 0.97 ± 0.09) (Fig. 2, A and B). Acute knockdown of the endogenous tamalin and expression of shTam:N-Tam did not have any effect on the surface expression of Myc-mGluR1 (control, 1 ± 0.02; shTam, 0.94 ± 0.04; shTam:N-Tam, 0.99 ± 0.03) (Fig. 2, C and D). However, unlike WT tamalin, N-Tam did not rescue the R,S-DHPG-mediated endocytosis of Myc-mGluR1, and the receptor did not internalize on application of 100 μm R,S-DHPG in shTam:N-Tam-expressing cells, similar to what was observed in cells where endogenous tamalin was knocked down (control, 1 ± 0.04; control + DHPG, 1.87 ± 0.04; shTam + DHPG, 1.11 ± 0.04; shTam:N-Tam + DHPG, 1.05 ± 0.04) (Fig. 2, E and F). Subsequently, we investigated whether the C-terminal region of tamalin alone was sufficient for the ligand-mediated internalization of mGluR1 by replacing the WT tamalin with a form of tamalin (C-Tam) containing the C-terminal region alone (amino acids 173 to 394 of tamalin) and lacking the N-terminal region of the protein. Similar to other constructs of tamalin, C-Tam also appeared to express properly, as observed by Western blotting (control, 1 ± 0.06; shTam, 0.54 ± 0.03; shTam:C-Tam, 1 ± 0.04) (Fig. 3, A and B). Expression of this replacement construct (shTam:C-Tam) had no effect on the surface expression of Myc-mGluR1 (control, 1.0 ± 0.02; shTam, 0.94 ± 0.04; shTam:C-Tam, 0.98 ± 0.04) (Fig. 3, C and D). Similar to N-Tam, C-Tam also did not rescue the R,S-DHPG-mediated internalization of Myc-mGluR1. No significant internalization of Myc-mGluR1 was observed 30 min after the application of 100 μm R,S-DHPG in shTam:C-Tam-expressing cells, similar to what was observed in tamalin knockdown cells (control, 1 ± 0.04; control + DHPG, 1.84 ± 0.04; shTam + DHPG, 1.07 ± 0.04; shTam:C-Tam + DHPG, 1 ± 0.02) (Fig. 3, E and F). These results suggest that both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of tamalin play a critical role in the ligand-induced trafficking of mGluR1.Figure 3The C-terminal domain of tamalin alone is not sufficient for the ligand-mediated endocytosis of mGluR1.

E and F, Representative images (E) and quantitation (F) suggested that knockdown of the endogenous tamalin inhibited the R,S-DHPG-mediated endocytosis of Myc-mGluR1, and replacement of the endogenous tamalin with C-Tam failed to rescue the normal internalization of the receptor (n values: control, 44; control + DHPG, 44; shTam + DHPG, 42; shTam:C-Tam + DHPG, 42).

In order to ascertain what role, if any, this domain has in the trafficking of group I mGluRs, the last 8 amino acids of the tamalin protein were deleted (TamΔ8) and a replacement construct was generated (shTam:TamΔ8). This replacement construct showed normal expression levels in Western blotting (control, 1 ± 0.11; shTam, 0.39 ± 0.14; shTam:TamΔ8: 1.16 ± 0.04) (Fig. 4, A and B). Initially, the role of this domain in the surface expression of Myc-mGluR1 was investigated. Deletion of the last 8 amino acids of tamalin had no effect on the surface expression of Myc-mGluR1 (control, 1.0 ± 0.04; shTam, 0.99 ± 0.05; shTam:TamΔ8, 1.02 ± 0.05) (Fig. 4, C and D). However, unlike WT tamalin, TamΔ8 did not rescue the ligand-mediated endocytosis of Myc-mGluR1. In shTam:TamΔ8-transfected cells, the receptors did not endocytose upon application of 100 μm R,S-DHPG, similar to what was observed in shTam-transfected cells (control, 1 ± 0.05; control + DHPG, 1.95 ± 0.07; shTam + DHPG, 1 ± 0.05; shTam:TamΔ8 + DHPG, 1 ± 0.03) (Fig. 4, E and F). We subsequently investigated whether binding of tamalin and S-SCAM is important for the ligand-mediated trafficking of mGluR1 (24Kitano J. Yamazaki Y. Kimura K. Masukado T. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S.

Our data indicated that deletion of the last 8 amino acids of tamalin disrupted the binding of S-SCAM to tamalin, suggesting that the interaction of tamalin with S-SCAM is critical for the trafficking of mGluR1 (S-SCAM + tamalin, 1 ± 0.06; S-SCAM + TamΔ8, 0.18 ± 0.07) (Fig. 4, G and H). These results suggest that the last 8 amino acids in the C-terminal region of tamalin play a critical role in the ligand-mediated trafficking of mGluR1 through interaction with S-SCAM. Thus far, our results suggested that tamalin controls the ligand-mediated trafficking of mGluR1 and that the last 8 amino acids at the C-terminal tail of tamalin play a critical role in this process.

Hypercaloric Western diets are associated with both obesity and type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study was to determine if obesity and type 2 diabetes result in spinal pathology in a sex-specific manner using in vivo diabetic and dietary mouse models. Leptin is an appetite-regulating hormone, and its deficiency leads to polyphagia, resulting in obesity and diabetes. Leptin is also associated with IVD degeneration, and increased expression of its receptor was identified in degenerated IVDs. We used young, leptin receptor deficient (Db/Db) mice to mimic the effect of diet and diabetes on adolescents. Db/Db and Control mice were fed either Western or Control diets, and were sacrificed at 3 months of age. Db/Db mice were obese, while only female mice developed diabetes. Female Db/Db mice displayed altered IVD morphology, with increased intradiscal notochordal band area, suggesting delayed IVD cell proliferation and differentiation, rather than IVD degeneration. Motion segments from Db/Db mice exhibited increased failure risk with decreased torsional failure strength. Db/Db mice also had inferior bone quality, which was most prominent in females. We conclude that obesity and diabetes due to impaired leptin signaling contribute to pathological changes in vertebrae, as well as an immature IVD phenotype, particularly of females, suggesting a sex-dependent role of leptin in the spine."
https://openalex.org/W3022119894,"Influential theoretical accounts take the position that classical conditioning can induce placebo effects through conscious expectancies. In the current study two different conditioning procedures (hidden and open) were used to separate expectancy from conditioning in order to reveal the role of expectancy in the formation of nocebo hyperalgesia. Eighty-seven healthy females were randomly assigned to three groups (hidden conditioning, open conditioning, and control). Participants were selected according to the Fear of Pain Questionnaire scores and assigned to two subgroups: high and low level of fear of pain (trait). They received electrocutaneous pain stimuli preceded by either an orange or blue color. During the conditioning phase, one color was paired with pain stimuli of moderate intensity (control stimuli) and the other color was paired with pain stimuli of high intensity (nocebo stimuli) in both hidden and open conditioning groups. Only participants in the open conditioning group were informed about this association, however just before the testing phase the expectancy of hyperalgesia induced in this way was withdrawn. In the control group, both colors were followed by control pain stimuli. During the testing phase all participants received a series of stimuli of the same intensity, regardless of the preceding color. Participants rated pain intensity, expectancy of pain intensity and fear (state). We found that nocebo hyperalgesia was induced by hidden rather than open conditioning. The hidden conditioning procedure did not produce conscious expectancies related to pain. Nocebo hyperalgesia was induced in participants with low and high fear of pain and there was no difference in the magnitude of the nocebo effect between both groups. Nocebo hyperalgesia was not predicted by the fear of upcoming painful stimuli."

This phenomenon is called collinear lateral inhibition and it may contribute to crowding in peripheral vision. Perceptual learning can reduce collinear lateral inhibition in peripheral vision, however intensive training is required. Our aim was to assess whether modulation of collinear lateral inhibition can be achieved within a short time-frame using a single 20-minute session of primary visual cortex anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS). Thirteen observers with normal vision performed a 2AFC contrast detection task with collinear flankers positioned at a distance of 2λ from the target (lateral inhibition) or 6λ (control condition). The stimuli were presented 6° to the left of a central cross and fixation was monitored with an infra-red eye tracker. Participants each completed two randomly sequenced, single-masked stimulation sessions; real anodal tDCS and sham tDCS. For the 2λ separation condition, a-tDCS induced a significant reduction in detection threshold (reduced lateral inhibition). Sham stimulation had no effect. No effects of a-tDCS were observed for the 6λ separation condition. This result lays the foundation for future work investigating whether a-tDCS may be useful as a visual rehabilitation tool for individuals with central vision loss who are reliant on peripheral vision."
https://openalex.org/W3021959665,"We present novel multi-energy X-ray imaging methods for direct radiography and computed tomography. The goal is to determine the contribution of thickness, mass density and atomic composition to the measured X-ray absorption in the sample. Algorithms have been developed by our own to calculate new X-ray images using data from an unlimited amount of scans/images of different tube voltages by pixelwise fitting of the detected gray levels. The resulting images then show a contrast that is influenced either by the atomic number of the elements in the sample (photoelectric interactions) or by the mass density (Compton scattering). For better visualization, those images can be combined to a color image where different materials can easily be distinguished. In the case of computed tomography no established true multi-energy methodology that does not require an energy sensitive detector is known to the authors. The existing dual-energy methods often yield noisy results that need spatial averaging for clear interpretation. The goal of the method presented here is to qualitatively calculate atomic number and mass density images without loosing resolution while reducing the noise by the use of more than two X-ray energies. The resulting images are generated without the need of calibration stan-dards in an automatic and fast data processing routine. They provide additional information that might be of special interest in cases like archaeology where the destruction of a sample to determine its composition is no option, but a increase in measurement time is of little concern."
https://openalex.org/W3023945286,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain-specific O-GlcNAc transferase (EOGT) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein that modifies EGF repeats of Notch receptors and thereby regulates Delta-like ligand-mediated Notch signaling. Several EOGT mutations that may affect putative N-glycosylation consensus sites are recorded in the cancer database, but the presence and function of N-glycans in EOGT have not yet been characterized. Here, we identified N-glycosylation sites in mouse EOGT and elucidated their molecular functions. Three predicted N-glycosylation consensus sequences on EOGT are highly conserved among mammalian species. Within these sites, we found that Asn-263 and Asn-354, but not Asn-493, are modified with N-glycans. Lectin blotting, endoglycosidase H digestion, and MS analysis revealed that both residues are modified with oligomannose N-glycans. Loss of an individual N-glycan on EOGT did not affect its endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization, enzyme activity, and ability to O-GlcNAcylate Notch1 in HEK293T cells. However, simultaneous substitution of both N-glycosylation sites affected both EOGT maturation and expression levels without an apparent change in enzymatic activity, suggesting that N-glycosylation at a single site is sufficient for EOGT maturation and expression. Accordingly, a decrease in O-GlcNAc stoichiometry was observed in Notch1 co-expressed with an N263Q/N354Q variant compared with WT EOGT. Moreover, the N263Q/N354Q variant exhibited altered subcellular distribution within the ER in HEK293T cells, indicating that N-glycosylation of EOGT is required for its ER localization at the cell periphery. These results suggest critical roles of N-glycans in sustaining O-GlcNAc transferase function both by maintaining EOGT levels and by ensuring its proper subcellular localization in the ER."
https://openalex.org/W3021203471,"Purpose To evaluate the clinical characteristics and evolution of lamellar macular hole (LMH) in high myopia and the parameters associated with structural worsening, defined as the development of foveal detachment or full-thickness macular hole. Methods Patients with high myopia and LMH were retrospectively recruited. The clinical characteristics and various parameters of optical coherence tomography were identified at baseline and during follow-up visits. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the hazard ratios for foveal detachment and full-thickness macular hole. Results Among 112 eyes (98 patients), 64.3% were female; the mean axial length of all eyes was 29.6 ± 1.9 mm. The ‘LMH without retinoschisis’ group accounted for 39.3% of the eyes. Forty-two percent developed structural worsening within a median follow-up of 67 months. Multivariable regression on all cases showed elevated tissue inside the LMH (P = 0.003) protected against structural worsening while V-shaped LMH (P = 0.006) predicted it. In the “LMH with retinoschisis group”, ellipsoid zone disruption (P = 0.035), and V-shaped LMH (P = 0.014) predicted structural worsening, while elevated tissue inside the LMH (P = 0.028) protected against it. In the “LMH without retinoschisis group”, no associated factor was identified. Conclusions LMHs in high myopia are unstable, especially those with V-shaped LMH. Elevated tissue inside LMHs have a protective effect against further structural worsening."
https://openalex.org/W3021444077,"Objectives To assess the association between having suffered a fall in the month prior to interview and long-term overall survival in nursing-home residents. Methods Retrospective cohort study conducting an overall survival follow-up of 689 representative nursing-home residents from Madrid, Spain. Residents lived in three types of facilities: public, subsidized and private and its information was collected by interviewing the residents, caregivers and/or facility physicians. Residents contributed to follow-up time from their baseline interviews until death or being censored at the end of the 5-year follow-up period. The association between suffering a fall during the month prior to interview and long-term overall survival was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. To adjust for potential confounders we used progressive adjusted models. We then repeated the analyses with severity of the fall (no fall, non-severe, severe) as the main independent variable. Results After a 2408 person-year follow-up (median 4.5 years), 372 participants had died. In fully-adjusted models, residents who had suffered any kind of fall in the previous month showed virtually the same survival rates compared to non-fallers (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.03; 95% CI = 0.75–1.40). There was a weak graded relationship between increased fall severity and survival rates for the non-severe fall group (HR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.58–1.45) and the severe fall group (HR = 1.36; 95% CI = 0.73–2.53) compared with residents who had not suffered any kind of fall. The hazard ratios for severe falls were higher in men, residents with less comorbidity, fewer medications, and those functionally independent. Conclusion We found no associations between having suffered a fall in the month prior to interview and long-term survival; neither did we find a marked association when severity of fall was accounted for in the whole population. In some subgroups, however, the results merit further scrutiny."

Our published study suggests that androgen hormone signaling regulates the nuclear–cytoplasmic translocation of YAP1 (7Kuser-Abali G. Alptekin A. Lewis M. Garraway I.P. Cinar B. YAP1 and AR interactions contribute to the switch from androgen-dependent to castration-resistant growth in prostate cancer.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (28230103): 812610.1038/ncomms9126Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but the mechanism is unknown. In this study, we have demonstrated that androgen exposure can suppress the inhibitory phospho–Ser-127 on YAP1, which causes increases in YAP1 protein levels and nuclear abundance. We showed that androgen receptor (AR) signaling was critical for the regulation of YAP1 by androgen. We also showed that androgen exposure antagonized the Hippo/STK4 signaling and promoted PP2A activity. Our data further demonstrate that androgen signaling regulates the YAP1-dependent gene expression. Thus, our study uncovers a new mechanism of YAP1 regulation that involves androgen hormone signaling. To identify suitable cell lines that allow studying the effects of androgen on YAP1, we analyzed the levels of YAP1, WWTR1, and AR in the established prostate cancer cell models. We found that the levels of YAP1, WWTR1, and AR protein varied among the cell lines tested (Fig. 1, A and B). Surprisingly, LNCaP and its androgen-insensitive LN-81 and C4-2 sublines showed no detectable WWTR1 protein. Also, the 22Rv1 cell line was YAP1-deficient compared with LNCaP and C4-2. The ARCaP and PC3 cell lines expressed YAP1, but they were AR-negative. Similarly, the expression of YAP1 transcripts also varied in the select cell lines (Fig. 1C). Thus, LNCaP is the ideal cell model to study the mechanism of YAP1 regulation by androgen because it harbors an intact AR and YAP1 signaling pathway (7Kuser-Abali G. Alptekin A. Lewis M.

Both cell lines were exposed to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) at varying times (0, 4, 16, or 24 h). We also examined the levels of phospho–Ser-397 on YAP1 as a control. Androgen significantly inhibited phospho–Ser-127 in LNCaP cells but without affecting phospho–Ser-397 (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that androgen specifically regulates phospho–Ser-127 on YAP1. Notably, the inhibition of phospho–Ser-127 by androgen correlated with increases in the total amount of YAP1 protein (13Manning S.A. Dent L.G. Kondo S. Zhao Z.W. Plachta N. Harvey K.F.

Surprisingly, androgen did not significantly alter the levels of the phospho–Ser-127 and the total amount of YAP1 protein in C4-2 cells compared with that of LNCaP (23Thalmann G.N. Anezinis P.E.

To further confirm the specificity of the effects of androgen on YAP1, we analyzed the levels of phospho–Ser-127 and total YAP1 in the PC3 cell line, which is AR-negative (24Kaighn M.E. Narayan K.S. Ohnuki Y. Lechner J.F. Jones L.W. Establishment and characterization of a human prostatic carcinoma cell line (PC-3).Invest.

Treatment of these cells with DHT did not alter the phospho–Ser-127 in PC3 cells (Fig. 2E). Surprisingly, MCF7 cells did not show detectable YAP1 protein, although expressing its paralog WWTR1 protein (Fig. 2F). Androgen did not alter the levels of the WWTR1 protein in both PC3 and MCF7 cells. Taken together, the effects of androgen on phospho–Ser-127 are specific. To demonstrate whether the AR activity is critical for the inhibition of phospho–Ser-127 by androgen, we performed a series of experiments. First, we evaluated the levels of phospho–Ser-127 and total YAP1 protein in LNCaP cells after treatment with a vehicle, DHT, and DHT plus enzalutamide (ENZ), a direct pharmacological inhibitor of the AR (Fig. 3, A and B). Compared with DHT, ENZ exposure reversed the inhibitory effects of androgen on phospho–Ser-127, accompanied by a reduction in the total YAP1 protein, which likely occurred because of the induction of phospho–Ser-127 (Fig. 3A, lane 2 versus lane 3). Second, we also examined the levels of phospho–Ser-127 and total YAP1 protein in LNCaP with or without AR knockdown by siRNA (Fig. 3, C and D). The results showed that androgen was unable to reduce phospho–Ser-127 in LNCaP cells with AR silencing compared with the scrambled siRNA control (lane 4 versus lane 5), which overlapped with a diminished total amount of YAP1 protein. The treatment of cells with ENZ had the opposite effect (Fig. 3C, lane 6 versus lane 5). Nevertheless, AR knockdown reduced the total YAP1 protein relative to the control siRNA (Fig. 3, C and D). We also wanted to know whether androgen antagonizes STK3/4 signaling in a way that suppresses phospho–Ser-127, given that the STK3/4 kinase mediates phospho–Ser-127 on YAP1 (16Zhou D. Conrad C. Xia F. Park J.S. Payer B. Yin Y. Lauwers G.Y. Thasler W. Lee J.T. Avruch J. Bardeesy N. Mst1 and Mst2 maintain hepatocyte quiescence and suppress hepatocellular carcinoma development through inactivation of the Yap1 oncogene.Cancer Cell. 2009; 16 (19878874): 425-43810.1016/j.ccr.2009.09.026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we assessed the levels of phospho–Ser-127 and total YAP1 protein in LNCaP cells with LATS1/2 and STK3/4 knockdown. Compared with the vehicle, androgen exposure slightly decreased phospho–Ser-127 in LATS1/2 knockdown, but without altering the levels of phospho–Ser-127 in STK3/4 knockdown cells (Fig. 3, E and F). Previously, we reported that controlled, ectopic expression of MST1/STK4 in the engineered C4-2/HA-MST1/STK4 cell line prevented YAP1 nuclear localization (7Kuser-Abali G. Alptekin A. Lewis M. Garraway I.P. Cinar B. YAP1 and AR interactions contribute to the switch from androgen-dependent to castration-resistant growth in prostate cancer.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (28230103): 812610.1038/ncomms9126Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We utilized this cell line to demonstrate whether androgen antagonizes Hippo/STK4 signaling in a way that inhibits phospho–Ser-127. In addressing this idea, we analyzed the levels of phospho–Ser-127 and total YAP1 protein in C4-2/HA-STK4 cells that were exposed to doxycycline (Dox) along with the vehicle, or DHT. Dox was used to induce ectopic MST1/STK4 expression. Compared with vehicle control, androgen exposure significantly reduced phospho–Ser-127, which resulted in increases in total YAP1 protein (Fig. 4, A and B). The Ser/Thr phosphatases PP1/PP2A are known to inactivate the STK4/3 signaling (27Couzens A.L. Knight J.D. Kean M.J. Teo G. Weiss A. Dunham W.H. Lin Z.Y. Bagshaw R.D. Sicheri F. Pawson T. Wrana J.L.

Okadaic acid (OKA), a potent inhibitor of the PP1/PP2A phosphatases, activates STK4/MST1 (30). Thus, we proposed that androgen positively regulates PP2A, which, in turn, attenuates Hippo/STK4 signaling. To test this possibility, we assessed the levels of phospho–Ser-127 and total YAP1 protein in LNCaP cells after treatment with DMSO (mock) control and OKA. Compared with DMSO treatment, OKA reduced the mobility of phospho–Ser-127 and YAP1 protein in the reduced SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4, C and D). We suggest that a reduction in the mobility of YAP1 protein accounts for its persistent multiple phosphorylation sites that increased the molecular weight of the YAP1 protein. This is likely due to the inactivation of the Ser/Thr phosphatases by OKA (30Hata Y. Timalsina S. Maimaiti S. Okadaic Acid: a tool to study the Hippo pathway.Mar. Drugs. 2013; 11 (23493077): 896-90210.3390/md11030896Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, compared with the vehicle, androgen slightly accelerated the YAP1 mobility, most likely by activating the Ser/The phosphatases, which in turn decreased the phosphomodifications on YAP1 (29O'Neill E.

Role of the kinase MST2 in suppression of apoptosis by the proto-oncogene product Raf-1.Science. 2004; 306 (15618521): 2267-227010.1126/science.1103233Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 31Ory S.

Furthermore, immunofluorescence imaging showed that androgen exposure enhanced YAP1 nuclear abundance in Dox-treated C4-2/HA-STK4 cells compared with vehicle treatment (Fig. 4, E and F). Hence, androgen may activate the Ser/Thr phosphatases to attenuate the Hippo/STK4 activity. To examine whether AR activity is necessary for the androgen-induced nuclear accumulation of YAP1, we conducted a coimmunofluorescence analysis of native AR and YAP1 proteins in LNCaP cells after treatment with vehicle, DHT, or DHT plus ENZ (Fig. 5A). Compared with the mock treatment, androgen exposure significantly increased the colocalization of YAP1 and AR protein in the cell nuclei. ENZ, however, reversed the effects of androgen on YAP1 and AR nuclear abundance (Fig. 5B). Consistently, coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments demonstrated that androgen enhanced the interaction of YAP1 with AR and the catalytic C subunit of the PP22A, particularly in the nuclear fraction, under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 5C). These findings indicate that AR, in concert with PP2A, mediates the reduction of phospho–Ser-127 and induction of YAP1 nuclear localization by androgen. The CCN1-encoded CYR61, the CCN2-encoded CTGF, and the ANKRD1 genes are well-characterized YAP1 targets (32Wang K.C. Yeh Y.T. Nguyen P. Limqueco E. Lopez J. Thorossian S. Guan K.L. Li Y.J. Chien S.

To test whether androgen regulates the transacting functions of YAP1, we assessed the levels of CYR61, CTGF, and ANKRD1 transcripts, including YAP1 in the YAP1-WT (WT) and YAP1–knockout (KO) LNCaP cell lines after treatment with the vehicle, DHT, or DHT plus ENZ (Fig. 6, A–E). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) demonstrated that androgen signaling differentially modulated the expression of CYR61, CTGF, and ANKRD1 transcripts in YAP1-WT cells. Regulation of these genes by androgen was YAP1-dependent because the silencing of YAP1 by CRISPR/Cas9 gene KO technology completely abolished the expression of CYR61, CTGF, and ANKRD1, including YAP1. To verify the physiological significance of our observations in cultures, we conducted a computational analysis of prostate cancer data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which is accessible via the cBioPortal website (RRID:SCR_014555). The results revealed that the expression of AR and YAP1 transcripts were significantly positively correlated (Pearson correlation = 0.45, p = 1.57e−14) in 493 prostate cancer patients (Fig. 6F). Overall, our data indicate that the regulation of YAP1 activity by androgen is physiologically and clinically relevant. Here, we have demonstrated that androgen attenuates the phospho–Ser-127 modification to promote YAP1 nuclear localization and activity. We have also shown that the AR-Hippo/STK4-PP2A axis mediates the effects of androgen on YAP1. Our findings suggest a new mechanism of YAP1 regulation that involves androgen hormone signaling. Our data have revealed that androgen signaling suppressed phospho–Ser-127 on YAP1 in an AR-dependent manner because the disruption of AR activity by genetic and pharmacological methods attenuated the inhibition of phospho–Ser-127 modification by androgen. Also, inhibition of phospho–Ser-127 resulted in increases in the total YAP protein and nuclear abundance. Our current and published (7Kuser-Abali G. Alptekin A. Lewis M. Garraway I.P. Cinar B.

https://openalex.org/W3023040279,"The transport layer security (TLS) protocol is widely adopted by apps as well as malware. With the geometric growth of TLS traffic, accurate and efficient detection of malicious TLS flows is becoming an imperative. However, current studies focus on either detection accuracy or detection efficiency, and few studies take into account both indicators. In this paper, we propose a two-layer detection framework composed of a filtering model (FM) and a malware family classification model (MFCM). In the first layer, a new set of TLS handshake features is presented to train the FM, which is devised to filter out a majority of benign TLS flows. For identifying malware families, both TLS handshake features and statistical features are applied to construct the MFCM in the second layer. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to substantiate the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed two-layer framework. A total of 96.32% of benign TLS flows can be filtered out by the FM with few malicious TLS flows being discarded provided the threshold of the FM is set to 0.01. Moreover, a multiclassifier is selected to construct the MFCM to provide better performance than a set of binary classifiers under the same feature set. In addition, when the ratio of benign and malicious TLS flows is set to 10:1, the detection efficiency of the two-layer framework is 188% faster than that of the single-layer framework, while the average detection accuracy reaches 99.45%."

Structural equation models (SEM) showed that Conscientiousness directly influenced inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms, while Neuroticism, Agreeableness, and Extraversion directly affected hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Only Conscientiousness exerted indirect effects on inattention, but not on hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms, via EF; higher scores on Conscientiousness were related to higher scores on EF, which in turn were related to lower scores on inattentive symptoms. These findings corroborate the relationships between ADHD symptoms, FFM personality traits and EF and indicate the mediating effect of EF on the relationship between Conscientiousness and inattention."

They are the first generation to grow up with computers, the Internet, smartphones, online social media, and online shopping. The individuals that belong to this generational cohort have one thing in common—their online shopping behavior. To understand the shopping behavior of the younger Chinese generation, this study draws on the theoretical foundation of generational cohort theory. This study proposes an integrated model that examines the effects of information adoption, personalized service, perceived switching risk, and habitual behavior on purchase intention in the online shopping environment. Survey data have been collected from 407 Chinese people that belong to the post-90s generation. Structural equation modeling is used to analyze the data. Empirical findings show that information adoption, personalized service, and perceived switching risk are the most important predictors of online purchase intention. However, habitual behavior is negatively related to online purchase intention."
https://openalex.org/W3021938720,"The eastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) is a climatically sensitive area affected by the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). A new pollen record from a lacustrine sediment in Mao County shows that the study area was covered mainly by shrubs and herbs during the last deglaciation, indicating open and sparse forest grasslands. Hydrophilous herbs were mainly dominated by Cyperaceae, Poaceae, Myriophyllum, Polygonum and Typha, and they gradually increased from 18.7 to 16.8 ka, suggesting a transition to a more humid climate. This corresponds to climate cooling over the same period. From 16.8 to 14.6 ka, hydrophilous herbs continued to increase, coincident with a general ameliorating trend indicated by δ18O records from East Asia. Between 14.6 and 14.0 ka, the mean content of hydrophilous herbs reached peak in the sequence, corresponding to relatively high δ18O values during this period. From ~14.0 to 12.9 ka, the abundance of hydrophilous herbs decreased significantly. Over the same period, the Greenland ice core shows a decrease in δ18O and low-latitude cave stalagmites in China record an increase in δ18O. This implies that longitudinal temperature gradients increased and drove the southward retreat of the ISM, which in turn drove a continuous decrease in the abundance of hydrophilous herbs in the study area. From 12.9 to 11.6 ka, the mean content of hydrophilous herbs decreased to the lowest (8.3%) in the whole sequence, indicating a cold and dry climate in the study area. A positive shift in δ18O records during 11.6–10.6 ka was matched by a significant increase in the abundance of hydrophilous herbs in the study area, indicating a warm and humid climate trending. Hence, the ISM has had a significant impact on the climate of the eastern TP since the onset of deglaciation around ~16.8 ka."

Of the long ncRNAs unique to bacteria, the OLE (ornate, large, extremophilic) RNA class is among the largest and most structurally complex. OLE RNAs form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex by partnering with at least two proteins, OapA and OapB, that directly bind OLE RNA. The biochemical functions of the OLE RNP complex remain unknown, but are required for proper adaptation to certain environmental stresses, such as cold temperatures, short chain alcohols, and high magnesium concentrations. In the current study, we used electrophoretic mobility shift assays to examine the binding of OLE RNA fragments by OapB and found that OapB recognizes a small subregion of OLE RNA, including stem P13, with a dissociation constant (KD) of ∼700 pm. Analyses with mutated RNA constructs, and the application of in vitro selection, revealed that strong binding of OLE RNA by OapB requires a stem containing a precisely located single-nucleotide bulge and a GNRA tetraloop. Although the vast majority of bacteria with the ole gene also have the oapB gene, there are many whose genomes contain oapB but lack ole, suggesting that OapB has other RNA partners in some species that might exhibit similar structural features.

Currently, we detect the presence of nucleotide sequences matching the OLE RNA consensus sequence and secondary structure model in the genomes of 296 Gram-positive bacterial species, and in several hundred additional metagenomic DNA sequences (12Harris K.A.

This distribution among various Firmicutes, particularly in extremophilic and anaerobic species of Bacilli and Clostridia, makes OLE RNA one of the most widespread large ncRNAs in bacteria whose biochemical function has yet to be determined. Although the precise biological function of OLE RNA is unknown, various lines of evidence indicate that the RNA participates in the formation of an abundant ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. For example, the gene for OLE RNA (ole) is almost always located upstream of a gene (oapA) coding for a 21-kDa transmembrane protein of unknown function, termed OLE-associated protein A (OapA) (8Puerta-Fernandez E. Barrick J.E. Roth A. Breaker R.R. Identification of a large noncoding RNA in extremophilic eubacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The ole and oapA genes are mutually inclusive (each only residing in genomes that include the other), suggesting that they are functionally linked. Indeed, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were used to demonstrate that OapA homodimers bind to OLE RNA by recognizing two short palindromic sequences, among other contacts with the RNA (14Block K.F.

In previous work, we developed protocols to efficiently genetically alter the alkaliphile Bacillus halodurans and created knockouts of ole and oapA (15Takami H. Horikoshi K.

Roth A. Breaker R.R. Identification of a large noncoding RNA in extremophilic eubacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Intriguingly, the stress phenotypes noted above are substantially worsened through mutation of a highly conserved DXXXD amino acid sequence in OapA (where X is less conserved) to the sequence AXXXA (referred to as OapA protein mutation 1 or “PM1”) (13Harris K.A. Zhou Z. Peters M.L. Wilkins S.G. Breaker R.R. A second RNA-binding protein is essential for ethanol tolerance provided by the bacterial OLE ribonucleoprotein complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2018; 115 (29915070): E6319-E632810.1073/pnas.1803191115Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These phenotypes are only seen when OLE RNA is also present. These findings are notable for three reasons. First, the fact that PM1 causes more severe versions of the same phenotypes compared with an oapA or ole knockout (KO) suggests that the OLE RNP complex has one or more other constituents whose function is disrupted by the PM1 changes. Second, the loss of the severe phenotype in PM1 when OLE RNA is absent indicates that the RNA is essential for the stress-related functions of the RNP complex. Third, the severity of the stress phenotypes offers a powerful selective pressure to pursue genetic selections for mutations elsewhere in the genome that convert the severe phenotypes of a PM1 strain to the milder stress phenotypes experienced by the ole and/or oapA KO strains. In one such genetic selection (13Harris K.A. Zhou Z. Peters M.L. Wilkins S.G. Breaker R.R. A second RNA-binding protein is essential for ethanol tolerance provided by the bacterial OLE ribonucleoprotein complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2018; 115 (29915070): E6319-E632810.1073/pnas.1803191115Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), 6 of 10 isolated B. halodurans strains acquired genomic mutations in the gene ybzG to overcome the severe PM1 phenotypes. The YbzG protein had not been characterized previously but was known to carry a KOW motif (17Kyrpides N.C. Woese C.R. Ouzounis C.A. KOW: a novel motif linking a bacterial transcription factor with ribosomal proteins.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21 (8987397): 425-42610.1016/S0968-0004(96)30036-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), which is a putative RNA-binding domain. Indeed, it has recently been demonstrated that the YbzG protein from B. halodurans selectively binds full-length OLE RNA, and it was thus renamed OLE-associated protein B (OapB) (13Harris K.A. Zhou Z. Peters M.L. Wilkins S.G. Breaker R.R. A second RNA-binding protein is essential for ethanol tolerance provided by the bacterial OLE ribonucleoprotein complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Additionally, the H57Y mutant version of OapB, encountered in two independent PM1-resistant strains from the genetic selection, does not bind OLE RNA. These data demonstrate that OapB plays an essential role in forming the functional OLE RNP complex in B. halodurans. Furthermore, OapB was found to bind a 160-nucleotide fragment of OLE RNA containing base-paired regions P12 through P15, suggesting that the RNA-binding target of OapB is limited to this OLE substructure (13Harris K.A. Zhou Z. Peters M.L. Wilkins S.G. Breaker R.R. A second RNA-binding protein is essential for ethanol tolerance provided by the bacterial OLE ribonucleoprotein complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In the current study, we further examined the interaction of OLE RNA and OapB to establish the precise nucleotides and structural features required for forming the OLE-OapB RNP complex. Specifically, we employed EMSAs with truncated and mutated RNA constructs to localize the binding sites for OapB. In addition, we used an in vitro selection strategy to more precisely define the sequence and structural features of OLE RNA important for high-affinity binding by OapB. Our findings provide a more detailed understanding of the structures involved in the function of this large bacterial ncRNA. Recently reported data (13Harris K.A. Zhou Z. Peters M.L. Wilkins S.G. Breaker R.R. A second RNA-binding protein is essential for ethanol tolerance provided by the bacterial OLE ribonucleoprotein complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2018; 115 (29915070): E6319-E632810.1073/pnas.1803191115Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) suggests that the partnership between OLE RNA and OapB (protein formerly called YbzG) is essential for the biological function of the OLE RNP complex in B. halodurans. Specifically, mutations to OapB were found to overcome the strong growth and survival deficiencies of the OapA PM1 strain as noted above. Likewise, deletion of the gene for OLE RNA similarly overcomes the PM1 phenotype. These results suggest that an intact OLE RNP complex is needed for cells to exhibit the strong PM1 phenotype, and that both OLE RNA and OapB are necessary to form a functional complex. Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to produce a viable genetic deletion of the oapB gene in B. halodurans to determine if the loss of OapB alone is phenotypically equivalent to strains lacking OapA or OLE RNA. The oapB gene is located between two essential genes: map (type 1 methionyl aminopeptidase) and infA (translation initiation factor IF-1) (18Kobayashi K. Ehrlich S.D. Albertini A. Amati G.

Replacement of the entire oapB gene with a selectable marker gene might affect expression of the two flanking genes, causing propagation of the intended KO strain to fail due to polar effects, or other reasons unrelated to the function of OapB, as we suspect that oapB is a nonessential gene. Regardless, there remain several questions about the natural role(s) of OapB. For example, do OLE RNAs from all species form a complex with OapB? Does OapB have a functional role beyond serving as a partner in the formation of OLE RNP complexes? To date, there are no additional validated functions for OapB proteins in any other species. Therefore, these uncertainties prompted us to conduct a quantitative examination of the co-occurrences of the ole and oapB genes, which can yield clues relevant to these questions. To evaluate the distributions of ole and oapB genes, we used a bioinformatic analysis approach both to expand the number of representatives and identify instances of co-occurrences. Specifically, by using BLAST, we compiled a list of oapB-containing organisms and compared it to a previously generated list of ole-containing organisms (13Harris K.A. Zhou Z. Peters M.L. Wilkins S.G. Breaker R.R. A second RNA-binding protein is essential for ethanol tolerance provided by the bacterial OLE ribonucleoprotein complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Representatives of the oapB gene are found exclusively in Firmicutes, with 1,952 examples in annotated genomes (Fig. 1, right). Importantly, over 85% of oapB-containing genomes lack ole. This indicates that, in species lacking OLE RNA, OapB has a separate biological role. Presumably, this role involves RNA binding because these additional OapB representatives are also generally very small (∼100 amino acids), and only carry well-conserved KOW RNA-binding domains. However, oapB is known to be nonessential in Bacillus subtilis (18Kobayashi K. Ehrlich S.D. Albertini A. Amati G. Andersen K.K. Arnaud M. Asai K. Ashikaga S. Aymerich S. Bessieres P. Boland F.

Additionally, a mutation to the B. halodurans oapB start codon resulted in a viable strain with no growth defects under normal laboratory culture conditions (13Harris K.A. Zhou Z. Peters M.L.

Thus, OapB function might be important in B. subtilis and other organisms lacking OLE RNA only under certain stress conditions. Of the 296 fully sequenced bacterial genomes that were found to carry a representative ole gene, all but 14 species also harbor an oapB gene, corresponding to a greater than 95% co-occurrence (Fig. 1, left). Among the 14 species that lack oapB, no clear differences are observed in the structure or nucleotide conservation of OLE RNA in the P12 to P15 region (Fig. S1). Of the species that contain both ole and oapB it is unknown how many utilize OapB as a necessary factor in assembling a functional OLE RNP complex. Given the importance of OapB to the function of the B. halodurans OLE RNP complex and its broader importance to species lacking OLE RNA, we sought to further define the RNA-binding site of this protein. Previous work demonstrated that OapB interacts with a 162-nucleotide construct spanning positions 449-608 of the full-length WT B. halodurans OLE RNA (13Harris K.A. Zhou Z. Peters M.L. Wilkins S.G. Breaker R.R. A second RNA-binding protein is essential for ethanol tolerance provided by the bacterial OLE ribonucleoprotein complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A dissociation constant (KD) of ∼60 nm reported for the 449-608 OLE RNA construct provides a basis of comparison for the assessment of the function of various RNA constructs examined in the current study. Initially, we created a 100-nucleotide construct, called OLE-1 (Fig. 2A), which encompasses positions 481-580 of the WT OLE RNA. By generating and evaluating EMSA data using trace amounts of 32P-labeled RNA, it was determined that OLE-1 appears to be bound by two OapB proteins in a manner indicative of two separate binding events (Fig. 2B). The initial shift in RNA electrophoretic mobility exhibits an OapB concentration-response curve that is consistent with a stoichiometry of 1:1 and a KD of ∼800 pm (Fig. 2C). The second event causes a further reduction in mobility of the RNA, or a “supershift,” suggesting that a second OapB protein is binding to the existing RNA-OapB complex, albeit with a KD that appears to be in the micromolar range. Under our assay conditions, we do not see evidence of cooperative binding between OLE-1 and two OapB proteins. A prominent characteristic of OLE RNAs encompassed by the OLE-1 construct is the presence of a semi-repetitive architecture, primarily represented by the P13 and P14.1 stems, and the regions immediately flanking these stems (Fig. 2A). For example, both stems are formed by 8 base pairs that are interrupted by one or two unpaired nucleotides. In addition, both hairpins are closed by GNRA tetraloops. Loop sequences conforming to this consensus are commonly present in naturally occurring structured RNAs, where they can both stabilize base-pairing interactions of adjoining stems (20Correll C.C. Swinger K. Common and distinctive features of GNRA tetraloops based on a GUAA tetraloop structure at 1.4 Å resolution.RNA. 2003; 9 (12592009): 355-36310.1261/rna.2147803Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and present unique tertiary folding opportunities by docking with tetraloop receptor structures (21Costa M. Michel F. Rules for RNA recognition of GNRA tetraloops deduced by in vitro selection: comparison with in vivo evolution.EMBO J. 1997; 16 (9214644): 3289-330210.1093/emboj/16.11.3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 22Fiore J.L. Nesbitt D.J. An RNA folding motif: GNRA tetraloop-receptor interactions.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2013; 46 (23915736): 223-26410.1017/S0033583513000048Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Given the architectural similarity of P13 and P14.1, we hypothesized that an OapB molecule might individually bind to each of these repeated substructures. We observed that replacement of the highly conserved GNRA tetraloop linking the left and right shoulders of base-paired region P14.1 with an alternative stable UNCG tetraloop (23Molinaro M. Tinoco Jr., I. Use of ultra stable UNCG tetraloop hairpins to fold RNA structures: thermodynamic and spectroscopic applications.Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23 (7544890): 3056-306310.1093/nar/23.15.3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (mutant construct M1, Fig. 2A) causes a loss of the second (weaker) OapB binding event, but has no effect on the first (stronger) binding interaction (Fig. 2B). The OapB-binding curves and the KD values for the WT and M1 constructs are essentially identical (Fig. 2C). In contrast, replacement of the GNRA tetraloop linking the shoulders of P13 with a UNCG sequence (mutant construct M2) causes a loss of the first, but not the second OapB-binding interaction. A construct wherein both GNRA loops were replaced (M3) exhibits no OapB binding, even at concentrations as high as 3.2 μm (Fig. 2B), again demonstrating the importance of the tetraloop sequences for formation of the OLE-OapB RNP complex. To further establish the specific portions of OLE RNA required for the OapB-binding events, we created RNA constructs OLE-2 and OLE-3 to examine each binding site in isolation. Construct OLE-2, encompassing P13 and flanking regions, exhibits robust single-event binding by OapB, again with a KD value (∼700 pm) that is essentially identical to that observed for the OLE-1 construct (Fig. 3A). In contrast, we did not observe binding of OapB to construct OLE-3, which encompasses P14.1 and its flanking regions (Fig. 3B). Given the small size of OLE-3 and its strong predicted secondary structure features, it is unlikely that the absence OapB binding is due to RNA misfolding. A mutated version of the OLE-2 construct also was examined, wherein the P13 GNRA tetraloop was replaced with a UNCG tetraloop (OLE-4) (Fig. S2A). This alteration results in the complete loss of OapB binding, which matches that observed for the OLE-1 M2 mutant and further demonstrates the requirement of the P13 GNRA tetraloop. However, a construct called OLE-5 encompassing only the P13 stem plus a partial P14 stem does not serve as a binding site for OapB (Fig. S2B). These findings demonstrate that the P13 stem and GNRA tetraloop alone are insufficient for high-affinity OapB binding. To observe if these effects hold true for the binding of full-length OLE RNA to OapB, a construct (FL-OLE M2) was made wherein the P13 GNRA tetraloop was replaced with a UNCG tetraloop. Comparison of the WT (FL-OLE) and mutated full-length OLE RNA by EMSA (Fig. S3) reveals that disruption of the P13 GNRA tetraloop leads to a reduction in affinity to OapB, although the effects are less substantial than in truncated constructs due to the overall poorer affinity of the full-length RNA. Taken together, these results localize the high-affinity OapB-binding site to P13, but only when embedded in its larger natural structural context. Although the P14.1 region is similar in appearance to P13, the poor affinity binding of OapB to construct OLE-1 (∼10−3 weaker) and the lack of binding to OLE-3 casts doubt on the biological relevance of this second, weaker interaction with P14.1. In its native cellular context, the OLE RNP might involve the binding of two OapB proteins, but our current in vitro data supports only one strong RNA-binding site with no evidence for cooperative interactions between two OapB molecules. Upon confirming that the P13 region forms a high-affinity OapB-binding site compared with the P14.1 region, we further examined these two regions to determine what differences might explain our results. The preceding experiments highlight the critical importance of the GNRA tetraloops for both binding sites, although additional binding site discrimination must rely on other features of these two regions. The most obvious difference is that P13 contains a single bulged nucleotide in the stem (U497), whereas P14.1 contains a mismatched pair of nucleotides (C539 and A550) (Fig. 2A). To assess the importance of U497, constructs were made in which this nucleotide was either mutated or deleted. The mutation of U497 to any of the other three common nucleotides only weakens binding (Fig. 4A), whereas deletion of this bulged nucleotide completely eliminates binding (Fig. 4B). Specifically, the KD values range from 4 to 7 nm for constructs wherein the nucleotide identity at position 497 has been changed (Fig. 4C), compared with 700 pm for the WT OLE-2 construct (Fig. 2C). These findings suggest that U497 might form one or more additional contacts with OapB, thereby resulting in a tighter RNA-protein complex. However, a far greater contributor to binding affinity is the presence of a bulge in the P13 helix. Perhaps the protein makes direct contact with the ribose and/or phosphate moieties of this bulged nucleotide, or perhaps the binding site of the protein prefers a distorted or bent RNA helix that results from the bulged nucleotide at this location. To generate a more detailed consensus sequence and structural model for the OapB-binding site, we created a mutagenized RNA population that presents a single, high-affinity binding site based on the OLE-2 RNA construct (Fig. 3A). The mutagenized version of this construct, called OLE-6 (Fig. 5A), was formed by synthesizing a DNA population (Table S1) for in vitro transcription that carried a central 56-nucleotide region with 6% sequence degeneracy. This region was flanked by invariant 15-nucleotide primer-binding sites to enable reverse transcription and subsequent PCR to amplify RNAs that were selected for their ability to be bound by OapB. The initial population (generation zero or “G0”) included ∼6 × 1011 molecules (1 pmol), and is expected to fully sample all possible sequences with 6 or fewer mutations relative to the WT sequence. Starting from the G0 population, two rounds of in vitro selection were performed, which were sufficient to produce a G2 population that is bound by OapB with characteristics that are comparable to that observed for WT OLE-6 RNA (Fig. 5B). A minor band (d, Fig. 5B) appears to be dimers of OLE-6 that have mobility similar to that of the RNA-protein complex. However, the mobility of the dimer was sufficiently different from that of RNAs bound by OapB, to exclude RNA-only dimers from amplification in subsequent generations. The G2 population was then subjected to RNA-Seq, and the results were used to generate a consensus model for the OapB-binding site (Fig. 5C). The overall secondary structure appears to be retained by the vast majority of the members of the G2 population, wherein the most highly conserved nucleotides are present in the P13 stem-loop substructure. In particular, the GNRA tetraloop and the terminal base pair of the P13 stem are conserved to a greater extent than any other region, with G501 of this tetraloop appearing in 100% of the sequence reads represented 500 times or more. Finally, although the U nucleotide identity at position 497 was not strictly conserved, the presence of the bulge at this location was retained. These results are consistent with our earlier data revealing that the bulge is essential for high-affinity binding by OapB, whereas the nucleotide identity is not (Fig. 4). After obtaining the consensus model for the RNA-binding site of B. halodurans OapB, we searched for matches to the model by employing comparative sequence analyses (24Nawrocki E.P. Eddy S.R. Infernal 1.1 100-fold faster RNA homology searches.Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 (24008419): 2933-293510.1093/bioinformatics/btt509Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) of B. halodurans (Table S2) and B. subtilis (Table S3) genomes. All candidate OapB-binding sites with an E value of less than or equal to 1 reside within protein-coding genes. These candidates appear to be false positives, as coding regions are an uncommon location for protein-RNA interactions to occur. Furthermore, there is no apparent trend regarding gene functionality, and there is no overlap in the specific genes identified from the B. halodurans and B. subtilis genome analyses. These findings highlight the mystery regarding the predominant biological function of OapB for each species in which this protein is carried. Perhaps the B. halodurans OapB has a single function: to serve as an essential RNA-binding partner in the OLE RNP complex. The features of its RNA-binding site might be distinct for B. halodurans. If true, then the consensus model might not be useful for identifying biologically relevant binding sites in other species. Regardless, the majority of bacterial species that carry OapB do not have OLE RNAs (Fig. 1), and therefore the primary biological role for OapB in these species remains undiscovered. Whereas the vast majority of species that carry OLE RNA also code for OapB, we have identified 14 species that appear to lack OapB (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the consensus model for the high-affinity RNA target site for B. halodurans is not strictly conserved across all OLE RNA representatives (13Harris K.A. Zhou Z. Peters M.L. Wilkins S.G. Breaker R.R. A second RNA-binding protein is essential for ethanol tolerance provided by the bacterial OLE ribonucleoprotein complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2018; 115 (29915070): E6319-E632810.1073/pnas.1803191115Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that OapB is not an essential partner in OLE RNP complexes from all species, and that the determinants of OapB binding might have co-evolved with the RNA if OapB is more widely essential for OLE RNP function. Overall, these observations suggest that OapB might function as a remarkably small RNA-binding protein that recognizes simple sequence and structural features to assist in the folding and functioning of certain RNA transcripts. In B. halodurans, its primary function might be to assist in the formation of the OLE RNP complex, but additional functional roles cannot be ruled out. In the current study, we have specifically mapped two binding sites for OapB within OLE RNA. Both sites are located considerable distances 3ˊ relative to the specific binding sites of the previously established protein partner, OapA (14Block K.F. Puerta-Fernandez E. Wallace J.G. Breaker R.R. Association of OLE RNA with bacterial membranes via an RNA-protein interaction.Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 79 (21166891): 21-3410.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07439.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). OapA presumably binds as a homodimer and relies on two YAGNCUR consensus sequence motifs located in the P2 and P4a regions of OLE RNA. This separation suggests that both OapA and OapB might bind full-length OLE RNA molecules simultaneously (Fig. 6). It is already known that shortened OLE RNA constructs that exclude P13 are tightly bound by OapA proteins (14Block K.F. Puerta-Fernandez E. Wallace J.G. Breaker R.R. Association of OLE RNA with bacterial membranes via an RNA-protein interaction.Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 79 (21166891): 21-3410.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07439.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), whereas shortened constructs such as OLE-1 (Fig. 2) and OLE-2 (Fig. 3) that lack the two YAGNCUR consensus sequences are tightly bound by OapB. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that both proteins can bind OLE RNA at the same time. Unfortunately, given the large shift in gel mobility upon the binding of OapA to OLE RNA (14Block K.F. Puerta-Fernandez E. Wallace J.G. Breaker R.R. Association of OLE RNA with bacterial membranes via an RNA-protein interaction.Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 79 (21166891): 21-3410.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07439.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and given the small size of OapB, we have not been able to demonstrate simultaneous binding using the EMSA methods described herein. Importantly, the protein-binding regions noted above encompass only small portions of OLE RNA. There are ∼80 highly conserved nucleotides that reside outside of the key molecular recognition motifs important for binding of OapA and OapB (Fig. 6). Therefore, we expect that these other well-conserved sequence and structural features are recognized by other protein factors or, perhaps more likely, are critical for OLE RNA to perform a complex biochemical function as exemplified by all other large, highly structured, and widespread ncRNAs in bacteria. The OapB protein from B. halodurans binds the P13 region of OLE RNA with an affinity in the mid-picomolar range. This strong interaction is required for cells to exhibit the most severe sensitivity phenotypes when exposed to cold, short-chain alcohols, or slightly elevated Mg2+ concentrations. Despite its small size (102 amino acids), the protein is remarkably selective for its RNA-binding site. The consensus sequence for OapB binding includes a GNRA tetraloop on a stem closed with a G-C base-pair, and a bulged nucleotide (preferably uridine) located 3 base pairs away and on the 5ˊ side of the tetraloop (Fig. 5C)."

To date, regulation of transcriptional activity at target gene promoters is the only molecular event known to underlie the oncogenic function of GLI1. Here, we provide evidence that GLI1 controls chromatin accessibility at distal regulatory regions by modulating the recruitment of SMARCA2 (SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A, member 2) to these elements. We demonstrate that SMARCA2 endogenously interacts with GLI1 and enhances its transcriptional activity. Mapping experiments indicated that the C-terminal transcriptional activation domain of GLI1 and SMARCA2's central domains, including its ATPase motif, are required for this interaction. Interestingly, similar to SMARCA2, GLI1 overexpression increased chromatin accessibility, as indicated by results of the micrococcal nuclease assay. Further, results of assays for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) after GLI1 knockdown supported these findings, revealing that GLI1 regulates chromatin accessibility at several regions distal to gene promoters. Integrated RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data analyses identified a subset of differentially expressed genes located in cis to these regulated chromatin sites. Finally, using the GLI1-regulated gene HHIP (Hedgehog-interacting protein) as a model, we demonstrate that GLI1 and SMARCA2 co-occupy a distal chromatin peak and that SMARCA2 recruitment to this HHIP putative enhancer requires intact GLI1.

In this model, knockout of GLI1 disrupts tumor formation. Although there are established roles for GLI1 in several cancers, the mechanisms by which GLI1 operates to regulate gene transcription are not well-understood. We therefore approached the role of GLI1 in cancer by studying the gene transcriptional regulation mechanisms by which GLI1 controls gene expression. The central role of transcription factors in converting upstream signaling to downstream gene expression depends on their binding to specific DNA sequences and recruiting co-factors that modify the chromatin landscape and the activity of RNA polymerase. The zinc finger domain of GLI1 recognizes a GC-rich nine-nucleotide sequence motif. The binding of GLI1 to that motif and the effect on gene regulation has been extensively characterized for the promoters of many target genes activated via Hedgehog (HH) (9Ågren M. Kogerman P.

Here, using a combination of a Gal4–UAS reporter system (12Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Targeted gene expression as a means of altering cell fates and generating dominant phenotypes.Development. 1993; 118 (8223268): 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mapping experiments, and immunoprecipitation studies, we identified the ATPase SMARCA2, a component of the BAF (SWI-SNF) chromatin remodeling complex (13Chiba H. Muramatsu M. Nomoto A. Kato H. Two human homologues of saccharomyces cerevisiae SWI2/SNF2 and Drosophila brahma are transcriptional coactivators cooperating with the estrogen receptor and the retinoic acid receptor.Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22 (8208605): 1815-182010.1093/nar/22.10.1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), as a co-regulator of GLI1-mediated transcription. We found that ectopic expression of GLI1 increases chromatin accessibility using a MNase assay. Further, ATAC-seq assays supported the MNase data and indicated genome-wide changes in chromatin accessibility regulated by GLI1. It also showed that GLI1 is involved in regulation of chromatin opening predominately at sites distal to promoters. Similarly, SMARCA2 modifies chromatin access at sites distal to the promoters. We further evaluated the link between GLI1-mediated gene expression and these distal chromatin sites by integrating RNA-seq with the ATAC-seq data. We identified 32 genes differentially regulated by GLI1 with cis chromatin sites regulated by both GLI1 and SMARCA2. At the GLI1-regulated HHIP gene, we confirmed the presence of both GLI1 and SMARCA2 at the putative enhancer and a dependence upon GLI1 for SMARCA2 occupation at this site. Together, these results point to a transcription regulation mechanism in which GLI1 and SMARCA2 cooperatively alter chromatin accessibility at sites located distally to target genes. We initially sought to identify which GLI1 domains have transcriptional activity using GLI1–Gal4–DBD chimeras (Fig. 1A) in HEK293G cells stably transfected with a Gal4-responsive UAS–luciferase reporter. Using this system, the C-terminal TAD region (539–1106 aa) of GLI1 was shown to possess very strong transcriptional activity, 68-fold higher than control expressing only the Gal4–DBD (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the regions N-terminal to the TAD, which encode the SUFU (Suppressor of Fused) binding, DNA binding, and nuclear localization motifs, had transcriptional activity similar to the control, indicating little to no activator function in these domains. Further mapping shows that smaller fragments within the 539–1106 aa TAD retain activity at reduced levels. In particular, the chimera including GLI1 aa 946–1106 retains ∼50% activity compared with the chimera with the full 539–1106 aa TAD, (Fig. 1B). Reporter assays in RMS13 and PANC-1 cells transiently transfected to express both the UAS reporter and GLI1–peptide/Gal4–DBD chimeric proteins similarly demonstrated that transcriptional activity of GLI1 is found in its TAD and within TAD subdomains (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1A). Expression of individual chimeras and UAS–promoter binding for the above experiments was evaluated in HEK293G cells by Western blotting (WB) and ChIP–PCR assays, respectively. An antibody against Gal4 revealed the expression of chimeras aa 1–232, 232–394, 383–595, 594–787, and 787–946, whereas chimeras 539–1106 and 946–1106 were only detected using an antibody against the C terminus of GLI1 (Fig. S1B). All chimeras were detected, with 232–394 and 787–946 having the lowest signals, weakly above background. Using ChIP–PCR assays to detect binding to the UAS promoter, all chimeras were found to be enriched 10–40-fold over background using the Gal4 or GLI1 antibodies, except the aa 594–787 construct, which exhibited a much higher level of enrichment (Fig. S1C). Thus, all constructs appear to be expressed and bind to the UAS promoter. However, no conclusion could be reached regarding their relative expression because of the apparent variable recognition of the different chimeras by the Gal4 antibody in the WB and ChIP assays. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that differential expression of the chimeras affects the results of the reporter assays. Nonetheless, our results indicate that all transcriptional activating function resides in different subdomains within the 539–1106-aa C terminus of GLI1. To define mediators of GLI1 activity through these newly identified TAD domains, we used the aforementioned Gal4–UAS reporter system to screen a panel of potential transcriptional co-regulators. We co-transfected the GLI1–TAD with the chromatin remodeling ATPases SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 (14Zhan X. Shi X. Zhang Z. Chen Y. Wu J.I.

Interestingly SMARCA2 exhibited a 2.5-fold increase in GLI1 transcription activity above the GLI1–TAD alone (Fig. 1D). In contrast, the related ATPase SMARCA4 did not increase the transcriptional activity of the GLI1–TAD. PCAF and TAF9 increased transcriptional activity, but this increase was less than 50% above the GLI1–TAD threshold (Fig. S1E). SMARCA2 co-expressed with Gal4-chimera–containing fragments of the GLI1–TAD has significantly increased luciferase activity of the 946–1106-amino acid region of GLI1 (Fig. 1E), indicating a specific interaction of SMARCA2 with the region of GLI1 having the highest transcriptional activity. Finally, we investigated the functional interaction between full-length GLI1 and SMARCA2 with a luciferase reporter containing an 8× GLI-binding site (GLI-BS) in the promoter (19Hyman J.M. Firestone A.J. Heine V.M. Zhao Y. Ocasio C.A. Han K. Sun M. Rack P.G. Sinha S. Wu J.J. Solow-Cordero D.E. Jiang J. Rowitch D.H. Chen J.K. Small-molecule inhibitors reveal multiple strategies for Hedgehog pathway blockade.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Following transient transfection in PANC-1 cells, SMARCA2 had little effect on transcriptional activity however, GLI1 alone stimulated activity ∼8-fold (Fig. 1F). When SMARCA2 and GLI1 were expressed together, luciferase expression was increased dramatically to over 2-fold compared with GLI1 alone, indicating that SMARCA2 enhances full-length GLI1 transcriptional activity at a GLI1-BS–containing promoter (Fig. 1F). Thus, this screening identifies SMARCA2 as a co-regulator of GLI1 transcriptional activity. We next determined whether GLI1 and SMARCA2 have a physical interaction using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays. In RMS13 cells, the IP of GLI1 resulted in the co-IP of SMARCA2, for both co-expressed transfected proteins (Fig. 2A, left panel) and endogenous GLI1 and SMARCA2 (Fig. 2A, right panel). Further mapping of the GLI1–SMARCA2 interaction was performed by co-expressing full-length GLI1–HA with fragments of SMARCA2 tagged with FLAG in RMS13 cells. GLI1 was found to co-IP multiple regions of SMARCA2 including fragments 393–786 and 786–1179, with a possible weaker interaction with the bromodomain fragment (amino acids 1180–1590) of SMARCA2 (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, there is a stronger co-IP of the SMARCA2 fragments compared with the full-length proteins; this may be due to improved exposure of GLI1-binding regions or increased stability of the SMARCA2 fragments that facilitate the interaction. The lower diagram in Fig. 2B summarizes the domains of SMARCA2 that were tested. Together, these data indicate SMARCA2 is co-regulator of GLI1 activity at target genes, and multiple regions of SMARCA2 are important for SMARCA2–GLI1 interaction. With the identification of SMARCA2 as a co-regulator of GLI1, we tested whether GLI1, like SMARCA2, can modulate chromatin accessibility using a MNase digestion assay. In triplicate assays, a time course showed, interestingly, that GLI1 overexpression caused a reduction in the overall nucleosome fragment sizes similar to the SMARCA2 overexpression (Fig. 3A). Expression of the transfected constructs was confirmed by WB (Fig. S2A). These results show that increased GLI1 expression enhances chromatin accessibility and led us to inquire what regions GLI1 and SMARCA2 co-regulate via alteration of chromatin density. We assessed the genome-wide chromatin accessibility site alterations utilizing ATAC-seq. In triplicate experiments in RMS13 cells, GLI1 and SMARCA2 were knocked down with siRNAs. The efficacy of knockdown was confirmed for the ATAC-seq assays with the average mRNA reduction being greater than 85% for both siRNAs and corresponding strong protein reduction (Fig. S2B). The number of significantly changed peaks was statistically determined among three replicates comparing the siGLI1 or siSMARCA2 to their matched controls (siNTs) using the DiffBind program with a 0.1 FDR. There were 440 and 3875 significantly changed ATAC-seq peaks (156,745 and 158,446 total peaks) for GLI1 and SMARCA2 siRNA treatment, respectively. Only a few peaks, 5 of 440 and 28 of 3875, showed an increase in chromatin accessibility, with the majority showing a decrease in accessibility upon GLI1 and SMARCA2 knockdown. This is revealed in Fig. 3B, in which significantly changed peaks (in red) are predominately in the lower portion of the graph, and only a few red points occur in the upper portions of the graphs (indicating increased chromatin accessibility). These results, along with the MNase data, provide evidence that GLI1 and SMARCA2 predominantly enhance chromatin accessibility. We next characterized the chromatin sites regulated by GLI1 and SMARCA2. First, we determined whether GLI1 sites are also regulated by SMARCA2. The average peak score for the 440 GLI1 ATAC-seq peaks was sorted and plotted on a heat map using Deeptools (20Ramírez F. Ryan D.P. Grüning B. Bhardwaj V. Kilpert F. Richter A.S. Heyne S. Dündar F. Manke T. deepTools2: a next generation web server for deep-sequencing data analysis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (27079975): W160-W16510.1093/nar/gkw257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C, left panel). The same peaks and sort order were then used to show that SMARCA2 knockdown also reduces the chromatin accessibility at the same 440 sites (Fig. 3C, right panel). We then mapped the differentially regulated ATAC-seq peak locations relative to gene transcription start sites (TSSs) using GREAT (21McLean C.Y. Bristor D. Hiller M. Clarke S.L. Schaar B.T. Lowe C.B. Wenger A.M. Bejerano G. GREAT improves functional interpretation of cis-regulatory regions.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 (20436461): 495-50110.1038/nbt.1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar) with basal parameters. Although regulatory regions can be very distal to their respective genes, most characterized GLI1-BSs have been in promoter regions (9Ågren M. Kogerman P. Kleman M.I. Wessling M. Toftgård R. Expression of the PTCH1 tumor suppressor gene is regulated by alternative promoters and a single functional Gli-binding site.Gene. 2004; 330 (15087129): 101-11410.1016/j.gene.2004.01.010Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22Dai P.

Unexpectedly, we found most of the identified GLI1- and SMARCA2-regulated ATAC peaks to be outside the 5-kb promoter regions of the nearest cis-gene, in either direction (Fig. 3D). To compare the distribution of regulated peaks to all peaks, a comprehensive list was generated from the MACS2 peak lists by combining lists and merging overlapping peaks to generate a single, nonredundant list for each group, GLI1 and SMARACA2, which includes peaks in both the control and knockdown samples from all replicates. Mapping all the ATAC-seq peaks (Fig. S2C) showed a similar pattern, but the percentage of peaks in the 0–5 kb regions is higher at 7.5 and 7.3% compared with 2.3 and 1.3% for the differentially regulated peaks, GLI1 and SMARCA2, respectively. There is also an enrichment of GLI-BS in 66 and 13% of these respective GLI1 and SMARCA2 regulated ATAC-seq peaks (Fig. 3E). Next, we examined the overlap between GLI1- and SMARCA2-regulated ATAC-seq peaks and identified 67 sites (Fig. 3F) with at least 10% overlap (average overlap, 515 bp; range, 197–940 bp). We explored whether there were additional chromatin regions in which GLI1 and SMARCA2 work in very close proximity. However, expansion of all the peak domains to include 500 additional bases in each direction (1000 bp added) did not add additional shared peak regions. Of the 67 co-regulated sites, 38 (56.7%) contain GLI-BS. Using GREAT with basal setting, 123 genes were identified to be cis-located (5′ or 3′) to these 67 overlapping peaks. Together, these data identify the 123 genes associated with sites in which GLI1 and SMARCA2 together regulate chromatin accessibility and identify these chromatin sites to be mostly outside the promoters, possibly enhancers. We next investigated the association between GLI1 regulation of gene expression and chromatin accessibility modulated by GLI1 and SMARCA2 depletion. We focused on GLI1 as the key regulator of gene expression because SMARCA2 alone showed little gene expression change in our reporter assays (Fig. 1F). GLI1 was depleted using siRNA in RMS13 cells in triplicate. Genes differentially regulated (DE) by GLI1 siRNA compared with control siRNA were determined using DESeq2 with a 1.5-fold cutoff and a p value at less than or equal to 0.05. GLI1 mRNA and protein reduction was confirmed by RT-PCR and WB (Fig. S2B). There were 3666 significantly DE genes as shown in red in Fig. 4A; 49% of the DE genes were down-regulated, including the known GLI1 target genes PTCH1, PTCH2, and HHIP (9Ågren M. Kogerman P. Kleman M.I. Wessling M. Toftgård R. Expression of the PTCH1 tumor suppressor gene is regulated by alternative promoters and a single functional Gli-binding site.Gene. 2004; 330 (15087129): 101-11410.1016/j.gene.2004.01.010Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 23Diao Y.

To focus on chromatin accessibility, we limited our search to genes near the 440 identified GLI1-regulated ATAC-seq peaks. As diagramed in Fig. 4B, 725 genes located cis to the 440 peaks were identified using GREAT. This list of 725 genes was intersected with the list of 3666 DE genes from RNA-seq to identify 174 DE genes in cis to the GLI1-regulated peaks. We further characterized the ATAC-seq peaks associated with these 174 genes and found that 97% (376 of 387) of these peaks are located outside the 5-kb promoter regions of the associated genes (Fig. 4C), and 74% (126/174) are enriched with GLI-BS (Fig. 4D). In contrast, we found the presence of GLI-BS in the promoter regions (2000 bp upstream and 100 bp downstream) of these 174 genes to be low at only 20% (35/174). In summary, we identified 174 GLI1-regulated genes that also possess GLI1-regulated chromatin sites enriched with GLI-BS. Finally, we found the intersection between the 174 GLI1-centric genes and the 123 genes identified near GLI1 and SMARCA2 co-regulated ATAC-seq peaks. This identifies 32 GLI1-regulated genes (Fig. 4E and Table 1) potentially controlled through enhancers in which GLI1 and SMARCA2 modulate the chromatin accessibility.Table 1Differentially expressed gene cis to chromatin sites regulated by GLI1 and SMARCA2GeneDescriptionGLI1 RNA Log2FCGLI1 peak fold changeSMARCA2 peak fold changeMMP11Matrix metallopeptidase 11−2.72−2.02−1.5MRAP2Melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein 2−1.91−1.79−1.77A4GALTα1,4-Galactosyl-transferase (P blood group)−1.80−2.38−1.55HHIPHedgehog interacting protein−1.72−3−1.6CHCHD10Coiled-coil–helix–coiled-coil–helix domain containing 10−1.10−2.02−1.5GORASP2Golgi reassembly stacking protein 2−1.07−3.01−1.79DCCDCC netrin 1 receptor−0.84−2.28−1.73ZCCHC8Zinc finger CCHC-type containing 8−0.74−2.01−1.45FSTL4Follistatin like 4−0.73−1.77−1.48FRMD4AFERM domain containing 4A−0.72−1.81−1.66NFIANuclear factor I A−0.67−1.99−1.57LRCH1Leucine-rich repeats and calponin homology domain containing 10.58−1.88−1.21ACVR2AActivin A receptor type 2A0.61−2.22−1.49PDCD6IPProgrammed cell death 6 interacting protein0.62−2.36−1.5FBXO11F-box protein 110.68−1.85−1.44SPRY2Sprouty RTK signaling antagonist 20.73−1.99−1.7PRKG1Protein kinase cGMP-dependent 10.76−1.82−1.88MEF2CMyocyte enhancer factor 2C0.80−1.97−1.68CDC42EP3CDC42 effector protein 30.84−1.88−1.58DARSAspartyl-tRNA synthetase0.84−2.24−1.6FOXN2Forkhead box N20.89−1.85−1.38NOGNoggin1.07−1.87−1.44CXCR4CXC motif chemokine receptor 41.21−2.24−1.78ANXA3Annexin A31.29−2.05−1.79ELAVL2ELAV like RNA binding protein 21.46−2−1.33OTUD1OTU deubiquitinase 11.46−1.78−1.54GALNT10Polypeptide N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase 101.51−2.2−1.94DCXDoublecortin1.57−1.67−1.77KLHL31Kelch like family member 311.62−2.11−1.74RND3Rho family GTPase 31.68−1.63−1.56ADAMTS5ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 51.69−2.38−1.78SEMA3ESemaphorin 3E1.82−2.1−1.58 Open table in a new tab With the identification of putative regulatory regions where GLI1 and SMARCA2 both regulate accessibility, we looked for the presence of GLI1 and SMARCA2 at these sites to confirm their role.

We targeted liver because turkeys fed 5 μg Se/g have hepatic Se concentrations 6-fold above Se-adequate (0.4 μg Se/g) levels without effects on growth or health. Our objectives were (i) to identify transcript biomarkers for high Se status, which in turn would (ii) suggest proteins and pathways used by animals to adapt to high Se. Turkey poults were fed 0, 0.025, 0.4, 0.75 and 1.0 μg Se/g diet in experiment 1, and fed 0.4, 2.0 and 5.0 μg Se/g in experiment 2, as selenite, and the full liver transcriptome determined by RNA-Seq. The major effect of Se-deficiency was to down-regulate expression of a subset of selenoprotein transcripts, with little significant effect on general transcript expression. In response to high Se intake (2 and 5 μg Se/g) relative to Se-adequate turkeys, there were only a limited number of significant differentially expressed transcripts, all with only relatively small fold-changes. No transcript showed a consistent pattern of altered expression in response to high Se intakes across the 1, 2 and 5 μg Se/g treatments, and there were no associated metabolic pathways and biological functions that were significant and consistently found with high Se supplementation. Gene set enrichment analysis also found no gene sets that were consistently altered by high-Se and supernutritional-Se. A comparison of differentially expressed transcript sets with high Se transcript sets identified in mice provided high Se (~3 μg Se/g) also failed to identify common differentially expressed transcript sets between these two species. Collectively, this study indicates that turkeys do not alter gene expression in the liver as a homeostatic mechanism to adapt to high Se."

https://openalex.org/W3023810896,"Due to the lack of efficiency to control malaria elicited by sub-unit vaccine preparations, vaccination with live-attenuated Plasmodium parasite as reported 70 years ago with irradiated sporozoites regained recently a significant interest. The complex life cycle of the parasite and the different stages of development between mammal host and anopheles do not help to propose an easy vaccine strategy. In order to achieve a complete long-lasting protection against Plasmodium infection and disease, we considered a genetically attenuated blood stage parasite in the hmgb2 gene coding for the high-mobility-group-box 2 (HMGB2). This Plasmodium protein belongs to the HMGB family and hold as the mammal proteins, a double life since it acts first as a nuclear factor involved in chromatin remodelling and transcription regulation and second, when secreted as an active pro-inflammatory alarmin protein. Even though the number of reports on whole living attenuated blood stage parasites is limited when compared to attenuated sporozoites, the results reported with Plasmodium KO parasites are very encouraging. In this report, we present a novel strategy based on pre-immunization with Δhmgb2PbNK65 parasitized red blood cells that confer long-lasting protection in a murine experimental cerebral malaria model against two highly pathogenic homologous and heterologous parasites."
https://openalex.org/W3022058215,"Background There is little evidence on the child and family factors that affect the intensity of care use by children with complex problems. We therefore wished to identify changes in these factors associated with changes in care service use and its intensity, for care use in general and psychosocial care in particular. Methods Parents of 272 children with problems in several life domains completed questionnaires at baseline (response 69.1%) and after 12 months. Negative binominal Hurdle analyses enabled us to distinguish between using care services (yes/ no) and its intensity, i.e. number of contacts when using care. Results Change in care use was more likely if the burden of adverse life events (ALE) decreased (odds ratio, OR = 0.94, 95% confidence interval, CI = 0.90–0.99) and if parenting concerns increased (OR = 1.29, CI = 1.11–1.51). Psychosocial care use became more likely for school-age children (vs. pre-school) (OR = 1.99, CI = 1.09–3.63) if ALE decreased (OR = 0.93, CI = 0.89–0.97) and if parenting concerns increased (OR = 1.26, CI = 1.10–1.45). Intensity of use (>0 contacts) of any care decreased when ALE decreased (relative risk, RR = 0.95, CI = 0.92–0.98) and when psychosocial problems became less severe (RR = 0.38, CI = 0.20–0.73). Intensity of psychosocial care also decreased when severe psychosocial problems became less severe (RR = 0.39, CI = 0.18–0.84). Conclusions Changes in care-service use (vs. no use) and its intensity (>0 contacts) are explained by background characteristics and changes in a child’s problems. Care use is related to factors other than changes in its intensity, indicating that care use and its intensity have different drivers. ALE in particular contribute to intensity of any care use."
https://openalex.org/W3022878911,"Many statistical models have been proposed to analyse small area disease data with the aim of describing spatial variation in disease risk. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that simultaneously allows for risk estimation and cluster identification. Our model formulation assumes that there is an unknown number of risk classes and small areas are assigned to a risk class by means of independent allocation variables. Therefore, areas within each cluster are assumed to share a common risk but they may be geographically separated. The posterior distribution of the parameter representing the number of risk classes is estimated using a novel procedure that combines its prior distribution with an efficient estimate of the marginal likelihood of the data given this parameter. An extension of the model incorporating covariates is also shown. These covariates may incorporate additional information on the problem or they may account for spatial correlation in the data. We illustrate the performance of the proposed model through both a simulation study and a case study of reported cases of varicella in the city of Valencia, Spain."
