https://openalex.org/W1968873679,"Peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or with signs or symptoms that frequently precede AIDS (pre-AIDS) were grown in vitro with added T-cell growth factor and assayed for the expression and release of human T-lymphotropic retroviruses (HTLV). Retroviruses belonging to the HTLV family and collectively designated HTLV-III were isolated from a total of 48 subjects including 18 of 21 patients wih pre-AIDS, three of four clinically normal mothers of juveniles with AIDS, 26 of 72 adult and juvenile patients with AIDS, and from one of 22 normal male homosexual subjects. No HTLV-III was detected in or isolated from 115 normal heterosexual subjects. The number of HTLV-III isolates reported here underestimates the true prevalence of the virus since many specimens were received in unsatisfactory condition. Other data show that serum samples from a high proportion of AIDS patients contain antibodies to HTLV-III. That these new isolates are members of the HTLV family but differ from the previous isolates known as HTLV-I and HTLV-II is indicated by their morphological, biological, and immunological characteristics. These results and those reported elsewhere in this issue suggest that HTLV-III may be the primary cause of AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W1991670386,"A cell system was developed for the reproducible detection of human T-lymphotropic retroviruses (HTLV family) from patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or with signs or symptoms that frequently precede AIDS (pre-AIDS). The cells are specific clones from a permissive human neoplastic T-cell line. Some of the clones permanently grow and continuously produce large amounts of virus after infection with cytopathic (HTLV-III) variants of these viruses. One cytopathic effect of HTLV-III in this system is the arrangement of multiple nuclei in a characteristic ring formation in giant cells of the infected T-cell population. These structures can be used as an indicator to detect HTLV-III in clinical specimens. This system opens the way to the routine detection of HTLV-III and related cytopathic variants of HTLV in patients with AIDS or pre-AIDS and in healthy carriers, and it provides large amounts of virus for detailed molecular and immunological analyses."

https://openalex.org/W2061230824,"A tumor-derived growth factor that stimulates the proliferation of capillary endothelial cells has a very strong affinity for heparin. This heparin affinity makes it possible to purify the growth factor to a single-band preparation in a rapid two-step procedure. The purified growth factor is a cationic polypeptide, has a molecular weight of about 18,000, and stimulates capillary endothelial cell proliferation at a concentration of about 1 nanogram per milliliter."

https://openalex.org/W2073557222,"The sequence of the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor shows great homology with the avian erythroblastosis virus v-erb B oncogene, raising the possibility that the receptor gene is identical to the c-erb B protooncogene. Human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells, which have an unusually high number of EGF receptors, were examined to determine whether elevated EGF receptor levels correlate with gene amplification. Southern blots of genomic DNA's from A431 and other human cell lines were probed with either a v-erb B gene fragment or a human EGF receptor complementary DNA clone (pE7), previously isolated from an A431 complementary DNA library. When either probe was used to analyze Eco RI- or Hind III-generated DNA fragments, EGF receptor DNA sequences were amplified about 30-fold in A431. Differences in the banding pattern of A431 DNA fragments relative to normal fibroblast DNA indicate the occurrence of a rearrangement in the region of the receptor gene. Furthermore, A431 cells contain a characteristic, prominent 2.9-kilobase RNA. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that, in A431 cells, gene amplification, possibly associated with a translocation event, may result in the overproduction of EGF receptor protein or the appearance of the transformed phenotype (or both)."

https://openalex.org/W1989468162,"Cultured keratinocytes, like those in natural squamous epithelia, form submembranous protein envelopes cross-linked by cellular transglutaminase. During the cross-linking, the cytosolic protein involucrin becomes incorporated into the envelope and can no longer be extracted by detergents. We show here that when transglutaminase is activated in cultured keratinocytes, at least six other proteins also become nonextractable. In contrast to involucrin, these proteins are associated with membranes. Two of the proteins (210 and 195 kd) are differentiated products specific to the keratinocyte; like involucrin, they are absent from small keratinocytes and fibroblasts, but appear in larger keratinocytes during the course of their terminal differentiation. The other proteins that become nonextractable cannot be destined exclusively for envelope formation since they are also present in fibroblasts. Transglutaminase is used by the mature (large) keratinocyte to make a detergent-resistant envelope from what appears to be a mixture of differentiation-specific and nonspecific proteins, both membrane-bound and cytosolic."
https://openalex.org/W2032479241,Ribonuclease P is a ribonucleoprotein that cleaves precursors to transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to yield the correct 5' terminal sequences of the mature tRNA's. The RNA moiety M1 RNA of ribonuclease P from Escherichia coli and the unprocessed transcript prepared in vitro of the gene for M1 RNA can both perform the cleavage reactions of the canonical enzyme in the absence of the protein moiety. When the transcript of the M1 RNA gene is combined with the protein moiety not only is a tRNA precursor cleaved but also the precursor to 4.5S RNA from Escherichia coli.
https://openalex.org/W1644493000,"A series of glycolipids having the X determinant (Gal beta 1----4 [Fuc alpha----3]GlcNAc) at the terminus and a fucosyl alpha 1----3 residue at the internal GlcNAc residue have been isolated and characterized from tumor tissues (Hakomori, S., Nudelman, E., Levery, S.B., and Kannagi, R. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 4672-4680. A series of monoclonal antibodies that differentially recognize glycolipids with mono-, di-, and trifucosylated type 2 chain have been isolated and characterized. The antibody FH4 shows a remarkable preferential reactivity towards di-/or trifucosylated type 2 chain, i.e. it does not react with monofucosylated structures, including lactofucopentaosyl (III) ceramide (III3FucnLc4), monofucosyl neolactonorhexaosylceramide (y2, V3FucnLc6), and monofucosyl neolactonoroctaosylceramide (Z1, VII3FucnLc8), but reacts well with di- and trifucosylated type 2 chain structures such as difucosyl neolactonorhexaosylceramide (III3V3Fuc2nLc6) and trifucosyl neolactonoroctaosylceramide (III3V3VII3Fuc3nLc8). Two other monoclonal antibodies, FH5 and ACFH18, preferentially react with trifucosylated type 2 chain structure (III3V3VII3Fuc3nLc8), although cross-reactivity with difucosylated type 2 chain (III3V3Fuc2nLc6) was observed. They showed a minimal cross-reaction with monofucosylated type 2 chain. In contrast, the antibody FH1 does not react with III3FucnLc4 but reacts with V3FucnLc6, III3V3Fuc2nLc6, and III3V3VII3Fuc3nLc8. Two monoclonal antibodies, FH2 and FH3, do not discriminate among various glycolipids having fucosylated type 2 chain, and their reactivities are essentially similar to previously established antibodies directed to the X determinant, such as anti-SSEA-1, WGHS 29, VEP8 and 9, My-1, etc. This series of antibodies will be useful to detect the specific type of glycolipid with fucosylated type 2 chain accumulating in human cancer and in undifferentiated cells."

https://openalex.org/W1969292324,"The excised intervening sequence of the Tetrahymena ribosomal RNA precursor mediates its own covalent cyclization in the absence of any protein. The circular molecule undergoes slow reopening at a single phosphodiester bond, the one that was formed during cyclization. The resulting linear molecule has 5'-phosphate and 3'-hydroxyl termini; these are unusual products for RNA hydrolysis but are typical of the other reactions mediated by this molecule. The reopened circle retains cleavage-ligation activity, as evidenced by its ability to undergo another round of cyclization and reopening. The finding that an RNA molecule can be folded so that a specific phosphate can be strained or activated helps to explain how the activation energy is lowered for RNA self-splicing. The proposed mechanisms may be relevant to several other RNA cleavage reactions that are RNA-mediated."

https://openalex.org/W1987154634,"Immunodominant, disulfide-bond independent epitopes recognized by human antibodies to hepatitis B virus (HBV) are located within the 55-residue amino terminal portion (coded for by the pre-S region of HBV DNA) of minor HBV envelope components larger than the major protein constituents encoded by the S gene. A peptide having the sequence of the first 26 amino acids from the amino terminal methionine was synthesized and elicited antibodies (at dilutions of â‰¥ 1 to 105) to the HBV envelope. These antibodies can be utilized for diagnostic tests. The immunogenicity of the peptide was substantially increased by covalent attachment to liposomes. The disulfide bond-independent determinants on sequences coded for by the pre-S gene may be more easily mimicked by peptide analogs than ""conformational"" determinants on the S-gene product."

https://openalex.org/W1539664383,"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of a cloned cDNA derived from liver poly(A) RNA of pentobarbital-treated rats encoding a glutathione S-transferase subunit. This cDNA clone pGTR261 contains one open reading frame of 222 amino acids, a complete 3' noncoding region, and 63 nucleotides in the 5' noncoding region. The cloned DNA hybridizes to rat poly(A) RNA in a tissue-specific fashion, with strong signals to liver and kidney poly(A) RNA(s) of approximately 1100 and approximately 1400 nucleotides in size but little or no hybridization to poly(A) RNAs from heart, lung, seminal vesicles, spleen, or testis under stringent conditions. Our sequence covers the cDNA sequence of pGST94 which contains a partial coding sequence for a liver glutathione S-transferase subunit of Ya size. Comparison of sequences with our earlier clone pGTR112 suggests that there are at least two mRNA species coding for two different subunits of the Ya (Mr = 25,600) subunit family with very limited amino acid substitutions mainly of conserved polarity. The divergent 3' noncoding sequences should be useful molecular probes in differentiating these two different but otherwise very similar subunits in induction and genomic structure analyses. Our results suggest that tissue-specific expression of the glutathione S-transferase subunits represented by the sequences of pGTR261 and pGTR112 may occur at or prior to the level of RNA processing."

https://openalex.org/W2022529274,"Arabinosylcytosine, a compound that inhibits DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, stimulates fetal hemoglobin in adult baboons and produces significant perturbations in the pools of erythroid progenitors. It appears that changes in the kinetics of erythroid cell differentiation rather than direct action on the gamma genes underlie stimulation of fetal hemoglobin in the adult animals in vivo. These results also suggest that chemotherapeutic agents selected for their low carcinogenic or mutagenic potential could be used for therapeutic induction of fetal hemoglobin in patients with sickle cell anemia."

Undiluted human follicular fluid stimulated angiogenesis in every case, with new blood vessels visible 3 days after injection and extending 2.0 millimeters from the corneal scleral limbus into the injection site by day 15. Stimulation of angiogenesis was lost by heating or diluting the follicular fluid but was retained after charcoal stripping or dialysis. Human follicular fluid contains an angiogenic factor that may be associated with perifollicular neovascularization during folliculogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2063616691,"The gene coding for the circumsporozoite antigen of the malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi was inserted into the vaccinia virus genome under the control of a defined vaccinia virus promoter. Cells infected with the recombinant virus synthesized polypeptides of 53,000 to 56,000 daltons that reacted with monoclonal antibody against the repeating epitope of the malaria protein. Furthermore, rabbits vaccinated with the recombinant virus produced antibodies that bound specifically to sporozoites. These data provide evidence for expression of a cloned malaria gene in mammalian cells and illustrate the potential of vaccinia virus recombinants as live malaria vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2035234400,"5-Amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside triphosphate (ZTP) is thought to play a regulatory role in cellular metabolism. Unlike other nucleoside triphosphates, ZTP is synthesized in a one-step reaction in which the pyrophosphate group of 5-phosphoribosyl-l-pyrophosphate is transferred to the riboside monophosphate (ZMP) in a reaction catalyzed by 5-phosphoribosyl-l-pyrophosphate synthetase; reversal of this reaction leads to dephosphorylation of ZTP to ZMP. This unusual route of synthesis (and catabolism) of ZTP may be important in defining its metabolic effects in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1485624324,"The interaction between RNA polymerase II and its specific stimulatory factor S-II was studied using each component purified to near homogeneity. It was found that RNA polymerase II and S-II form a complex in the absence of DNA and nucleoside triphosphates, although their interaction was weak. This interaction became stable in the presence of a template and substrates, and a stoichiometric amount of S-II was found to remain in the transcription machinery during RNA chain elongation."

https://openalex.org/W2089119659,"Recent data suggest that size polymorphism of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase is due to variable fusions of additional functional domains to a catalytic core so that, in a large synthetase, a substantial part of the polypeptide is dispensable for catalytic activity. We demonstrate here that a dispensable domain, joined to the catalytic core of a large synthetase, can activate the catalytic sites. This is shown by complementation of an activity-deficient mutant enzyme by protein fragments that contain internal deletions within the catalytic domain and are themselves devoid of activity. The complementation is dependent upon the presence of a defined segment of polypeptide that is remote in the sequence from the catalytic core. Substantial coupling has been established between dispensable and indispensable component pieces. This could be a mechanism to build efficiently large enzymes which integrate the catalytic sites with other previously shown functional roles."
https://openalex.org/W2155995610,"We have isolated poly (A)+ RNA, highly enriched in keratin mRNA from bovine muzzle epidermis, and injected it into epithelial cells of a different type, i.e., cultured kidney epithelial cells of the same (MDBK) or taxonomically distant (PtK2) species. Both recipient cell lines contain keratin polypeptides that are different from those present in epidermal cells. Using keratin subtype-specific antibodies in immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, we show that foreign keratin mRNAs when injected into a different type of epithelial cell can recruit polyribosomes and are translated together with the keratin mRNAs of the host cell. Foreign epidermal keratins are excluded from vimentin filaments and other structures but readily coassemble with the endogenous keratins and appear to be integrated into the meshwork of the preexisting kidney-type keratin filaments. Our observations indicate that different sets of keratin polypeptides from the same or different species can coassemble in the living cell into a common filament system. Thus we have developed a procedure that allows experimental alteration of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton within living epithelial cells."

https://openalex.org/W1525046238,"N-[3H]Methylscopolamine (NMS) binding, amylase secretion, and 45Ca efflux from dispersed rat pancreatic acini were investigated in parallel, in the presence or absence of 4 muscarinic agonists and 3 muscarinic antagonists. Scatchard analysis of [3H]NMS saturation isotherms gave a KD of 0.9 nM and an average binding capacity of 24,000 sites per cell. Binding competition curves with the antagonists atropine, dexetimide, and NMS gave KD values of 3.5, 3.5, and 0.5 nM, respectively. With the 3 full agonists oxotremorine, muscarine, and carbamylcholine, the receptor population could be divided into two classes of binding sites: a minor one (15%) with high affinity (KD = 20-35 nM) and a major one (85%) with low affinity (KD = 3-65 microM). There was a receptor reserve of about 50% with respect to carbamylcholine-stimulated amylase secretion. Further analysis of dose-effect curves suggests that low affinity binding sites were involved in the secretory response to muscarinic stimulation. Pilocarpine, like muscarinic antagonists, recognized all binding sites with the same affinity but acted as a partial agonist on amylase secretion and 45Ca efflux."
https://openalex.org/W1603444330,"We determined the site of synthesis of apolipoprotein (apo) E and apo-A-I in rabbit by measuring in vitro translational activity of their mRNAs from the liver and from the intestine. Poly(A+) RNA isolated from liver and intestinal epithelium of rabbits fed either a chow diet or a cholesterol-rich diet was translated in vitro in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system using [35S] methionine as the labeled precursor. Newly synthesized apolipoproteins were immunoprecipitated with specific antisera and quantitated after electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide slab gels in the presence of 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The levels of liver apo-E and apo-A-I mRNAs from chow-fed rabbits are 0.41 and 0.002% of total translatable mRNA, respectively. The level of liver apo-A-I mRNA in the rabbit is approximately 500-fold lower than the reported level of apo-A-I mRNA in rat and human livers. Rabbit intestinal apo-E and apo-A-I mRNAs levels are 0.0036 and 0.67%, respectively. Our results indicate that in rabbits apo-E is synthesized primarily in the liver and that apo-A-I is synthesized primarily in the intestine. When rabbits are fed a cholesterol-rich diet, liver and intestinal apo-E in mRNA levels and intestinal apo-A-I mRNA levels are not changed. In contrast, the liver apo-A-I mRNA level increases 5-fold in response to the cholesterol-rich diet. However, because the intestinal liver apo-A-I mRNA level is so low, the 5-fold induction only increases liver mRNA levels to 2.7% of the corresponding intestinal apo-A-I mRNA level."
https://openalex.org/W1580333464,"Chronic injection of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol causes a 6- to 10-fold increase in the specific activity of the Golgi membrane marker enzyme UDP-galactose:D-glucose 4-beta-D-galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.22) in rat parotid glands. Using a combination of size exclusion chromatography and affinity chromatography on alpha-lactalbumin-agarose, the Triton X-100-solubilized enzyme was purified to homogeneity from treated and control animals. The enzyme purified from both sources had a single Mr = 60,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme isolated from control and isoproterenol-treated animals had identical amino acid compositions and isoelectric points (pI = 5.9). Neutral sugar content as determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid assay was 10%. UDP-galactose:N-acetylglucosamine 4 beta-galactosyltransferase activity purified by alpha-lactalbumin column chromatography was inhibited by the presence of 200 mM N-acetylglucosamine and by the inclusion of alpha-lactalbumin in assays using 10 mM N-acetylglucosamine as acceptor. Increased enzyme activity was immune precipitated from Triton X-100-solubilized membrane prepared from isoproterenol-treated animals versus control animals. This was also true of protein synthesized by in vitro translation of poly(A+) RNA prepared from parotid glands, indicating an increase in mRNA levels for the enzyme. The molecular mass of the immune-precipitated, in vitro translation product was determined to be 45,000 Da."
https://openalex.org/W1953834341,"Abstract Pedersen fetuin contains a contaminant, previously named that exhibits immuno-cross reactivity with human alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2Mh). In the present study, it is demonstrated that this protein coelutes with alpha2Mh in gel filtration chromatography and can be purified to homogeneity by Zn2+ chelate chromatography. By sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), this contaminant exhibited similar subunit size, protease-induced cleavage fragments, and heat fragmentation as alpha2Mh. 125I-trypsin and 125I-chymotrypsin each bound at a ratio of 0.9 mol/mol to this fetuin-derived native alpha2M (alpha2Mf) and at a ratio of less than 0.2 mol/mol to methylamine-treated alpha2Mf. As determined by SDS-PAGE, 1:1 molar ratio of protease to alpha2Mf cleaved each alpha2Mf subunit to fragments of Mr approximately 72,000. At a 0.2:1 molar ratio of trypsin to alpha2Mf-methylamine, every alpha2Mf-methylamine subunit was cleaved to polypeptide chains of Mr approximately 72,000 and 110,000. In native PAGE, alpha2Mf and alpha2Mf-methylamine migrated with the same mobility; after reaction with trypsin their mobilities increased similarly. 125I-alpha2Mf cleared from the circulation of mice with a t1/2 of 30 min. The trypsin or methylamine derivative of 125I-alpha2Mf cleared with t1/2 of less than 5 min and clearance was competable when the ligand was co-injected with a large molar excess of unlabeled alpha2Mh-methylamine. alpha2Mf, 0.3 nM, treated with trypsin or methylamine, inhibited 50% of the binding of 0.1 nM 125I-alpha2Mh-methylamine to specific receptors on mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro. Native alpha2Mf did not inhibit significantly the binding of the ligand at this concentration. Bovine alpha2M (alpha2Mb) was purified from plasma by Ni2+ chelate chromatography. By SDS-PAGE, amino acid analysis, and cyanogen bromide peptide mapping, it was indistinguishable from the alpha2M purified from fetuin. It is concluded that embryonin is bovine alpha2M."
https://openalex.org/W1574489141,"A protein in highly purified synaptic vesicles from elasmobranch electric organ is recognized by two specific antisera that recognize different determinants of calmodulin. The protein is indistinguishable from authentic calmodulin by migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence or absence of calcium. It is tightly associated with the intact synaptic vesicle membrane even in the absence of calcium. It is on vesicles rather than membrane contaminants and cytoplasmically oriented since a calmodulin antibody (sheep anti-calmodulin antibody) immunoprecipitates at least 86% of intact synaptic vesicles. Surprisingly, another calmodulin antiserum (rabbit anti-calmodulin serum) specifically precipitates less than 20% of the intact vesicles. This antiserum (rabbit anti-calmodulin serum) also detects 4-15 times less calmodulin immunoreactivity than sheep anti-calmodulin antibody by radioimmunoassay of vesicles solubilized with nondenaturing detergents. The difference essentially disappears if the vesicle calmodulin is solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate. We suggest that the antigenic determinant recognized by rabbit anti-calmodulin serum is concealed in vesicle-associated calmodulin and may be involved in binding calmodulin to the vesicle."
https://openalex.org/W1546170450,"Abstract In order to resolve the uncertainties about the primary structure of human myelin basic protein at residues 45-89, the sequence of this peptide and its tryptic fragments were reinvestigated by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The sequence at positions 77-78 was found to be His-Gly and the sequence at positions 83-84 was shown to be Glu-Asn. The Ser at position 56 was not phosphorylated, whereas the residue at position 46 or 47 showed a heterogeneity of Gly and Ser in this peptide fragment in one of two protein preparations from different patients. These results demonstrate the usefulness of fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry for primary structure information.

https://openalex.org/W1544074981,"The biosynthesis and degradation of two lipogenic enzymes were studied during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes. The activity and mass of malic enzyme, rose by an order of magnitude during adipocyte development and the enzyme accounted for 0.3% of the cytosol protein in mature fat cells. Similarly, the activity and amount of ATP-citrate lyase increased approximately 7-fold during the adipose conversion. The relative rates of synthesis of the two enzymes were less than or equal to 0.02% in preadipocytes, but increased sharply as the cells began to differentiate. Maximal steady state rates of malic enzyme and ATP-citrate lyase synthesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes were 13- and 8-fold higher, respectively, than the basal rates in preadipocytes. In contrast, the half-lives of malic enzyme (67 h) and ATP-citrate lyase (47 h) were not altered during adipocyte development. Thus, accelerated rates of enzyme synthesis account for the differentiation-dependent accumulation of the two lipogenic enzymes. Increased rates of malic enzyme, ATP-citrate lyase, and fatty acid synthetase biosynthesis are expressed in a highly coordinated manner during adipocyte differentiation and are associated with parallel elevations in the levels of translatable mRNAs for these enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1480632017,The structure of 5 S RNA within the 70 S ribosome from Escherichia coli was studied using the chemical reagent kethoxal (alpha-keto-beta-ethoxybutyraldehyde) to modify accessible guanosines. The modification pattern of 5 S RNA from free 70 S ribosomes was compared with that of poly(U) programmed ribosomes where tRNA had been bound to both the A- and P-sites. Binding to the ribosomal A-site was achieved enzymatically using the elongation factor Tu and GTP in the presence of deacylated tRNA which blocks the ribosomal P-site. Modified guanosines were identified after partial RNase T1 hydrolysis and separation of the hydrolysis products on sequencing gels. Binding of tRNA to the ribosome leads to a strong protection of 5 S RNA guanosine G-41 and to some degree G-44 from kethoxal modification. The limited RNase T1 hydrolysis pattern provides evidence for the existence of a 5 S RNA conformation different from the known 5 S RNA A- and B-forms which are characterized by their gel electrophoretic mobility. The importance of 5 S RNA for the binding of tRNA to the ribosome is discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1511863214,"Abstract Rat liver total RNA was translated in a reticulocyte lysate, and the precursor of rat liver mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase was identified by a monospecific antibody against the denatured mature enzyme. The precursor is about Mr = 1500 to 2000 larger than the monomeric form of the mature protein. The major spots of the two-dimensional peptide map of the two proteins were identical. The precursor was synthesized on free polysomes, but not membrane-bound polysomes. Upon fractionation by molecular sieve chromatography on Sephadex G-100, the size of the precursor was slightly larger than the dimeric form of the mature protein. Incubation of the precursor with isolated mitochondria from Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in uptake and processing of the precursor to the mature size. The processed form was resistant to trypsin indicating that it was translocated into mitochondria. Processing was complete in 10 to 30 min at 30 degrees C. Rapid binding of the precursor to mitochondria was also observed at 0 or 30 degrees C. Processing but not binding was inhibited by an uncoupler."
https://openalex.org/W1527135717,"Low frequency (S-band) EPR and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) data have been used to provide a detailed description of the magnetic environment of the cupric complex of the antitumor antibiotic, bleomycin. S-band EPR spectra show well resolved nitrogen hyperfine structure in both gl and g regions. Computer simulation of these spectra are consistent with binding to four donor nitrogen atoms, three with AN = 10 gauss and one with AN = 15 G. ENDOR data confirm the presence of at least two inequivalent nitrogens with AN approximately 11 and 15 G. In addition, at least six proton couplings were evident in the ENDOR spectrum although these could not be unambiguously assigned. Diminution of the matrix ENDOR signal in D2O relative to that in H2O was found; this demonstrates the accessibility of H2O to the metal site."
https://openalex.org/W2165448445,"A study was made of the kinetics of utilization of [9,10-3H]palmitate by 3T3 L1 cells undergoing slow spontaneous adipose differentiation and by a population of 3T3 L1 cells treated with 1-methylisobutylxanthine (MIX) and dexamethasone (DEX) to accelerate adipose differentiation. The results showed that, early in the course of the induced differentiation, the specific rate of beta-oxidation of long chain fatty acids (kappa 1) fell precipitously, particularly during the 2 days of exposure of the cells to MIX + DEX. The value of kappa 1 decreased slowly with the passage of time in untreated cells, a small proportion of which differentiated to adipocytes. In MIX + DEX-treated cells the abrupt decline in the rate of fatty acid oxidation was followed by a decrease in the rate of carnitine uptake. Both changes preceded the appearance of detectable alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity, a sensitive indicator of adipose differentiation, and came well before the appearance of lipid droplets. Esterification was found to be the principal route of fatty acid utilization both by preadipocytes and by cells committed to adipose differentiation. With the passage of time, the specific rate of fatty acid esterification (kappa 2) increased by two-thirds in untreated cells but in the same period more than doubled in MIX + DEX-treated cells. Thus, while the ratio of kappa 2/kappa 1 rose in 9 days to 7.6 in untreated cells, it increased to 28.3 in treated cells. Measurements of the rate of lipolysis (kappa 3) showed no significant difference between preadipocytes and cells committed to adipose differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1496301141,"Stable hybridomas generated by fusion of spleen cells from hyperimmunized mice and mouse myeloma cells were cloned to prepare monoclonal antibodies to alpha 2u-globulin, an androgen-dependent urinary protein of hepatic origin. One of these monoclonal antibodies was used as a probe for immunocytofluorometric analysis of alpha 2u-globulin producing hepatocytes during androgenic induction and aging through fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). FACS patterns of hepatocytes from mature male rats that produce high levels of alpha 2u-globulin showed tow distinct peaks, arbitrarily designated as peak I (weakly fluorescent) and peak II (brightly fluorescent). In the mature male rat, peak II represented about 40% of the total hepatocytes, and the fluorescence intensity of this subpopulation decreased in direct correspondence with the gradual decline of alpha 2u-globulin synthesis during aging. Similarly the androgenic induction of this protein in ovariectomized female rats was associated with an increase in the fluorescence intensity of the hepatocyte subpopulation under peak II rather than an increase in the relative number of these cells. From these results we conclude that the androgen-dependent synthesis of alpha 2u-globulin and its alteration during aging are confined to a specific subpopulation of hepatocytes within the liver."

The Z-DNA determinants were analyzed by examination of the antisera and of antibody preparations purified on immunoadsorbents. The following was found: AAF-poly(dG-dC) X poly(dG-dC) shared Z-DNA determinants in common with poly(dG-dC) X poly(dG-dC) in 3.0 M NaCl, poly(dG-m5dC) X poly(dG-m5dC) in 1.5 M NaCl, and brominated poly(dG-dC) X poly(dG-dC) in 0.2, 1.5, and 3.0 M NaCl. Included among the antibodies induced by these determinants was a subpopulation whose reaction with brominated poly(dG-dC) X poly(dG-dC) was sensitive to increased ionic strength. Another distinct population of antibodies recognized determinants present on AAF-poly(dG-dC) X poly(dG-dC) but not on the other Z-DNAs. Only a small portion of this population was specific for the AAF moiety; the greater part appeared to recognize Z-DNA-associated conformational characteristics that were unique to AAF-poly(dG-dC) X poly(dG-dC). These findings are consistent with the existence of a continuum of Z-DNA determinants, which might be capable of functioning as recognition signals for regulatory DNA-binding proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1524551194,"The major anionic proline-rich proteins in the parotid and submandibular secretions of subhuman primates and man perform the important biological function of inhibiting crystal growth of calcium phosphate salts from saliva, which is supersaturated with calcium phosphate salts, thereby preventing excess deposition of hydroxylapatite on tooth surfaces. The present work was initiated as a first step towards investigating proline-rich protein biosynthesis in parotid glands using the subhuman primate, Macaca fascicularis, as a model system. RNA was isolated from macaque parotid glands and separated into poly(A)-enriched and poly(A)-deficient fractions by chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose. The mRNAs in both fractions promoted incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids into polypeptides in an mRNA-dependent reticulocyte lysate translation system. Five major proline-rich polypeptides were detected and one of these was shown to be the in vitro precursor of the major anionic macaque proline-rich protein (MPRP), which is the structural and functional counterpart of the major anionic proline-rich proteins in the parotid and submandibular secretions of man (Oppenheim, F.G., Offner, G.D., and Troxler, R.F. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 9271-9282). Radiosequencing of the material in anti-MPRP immune precipitates showed that the in vitro precursor of MPRP contained an 18-residue signal peptide. The in vitro precursor of MPRP was processed in dog pancreas vesicles to a form with a lower apparent Mr and with an NH2-terminal amino acid sequence identical to that of native MPRP. The phenylthiohydantoin derivatives of Ala and Ile were detected at residue 9 and those of Val and Met were detected at residue 16 of the signal peptide. This indicated that the in vitro precursor of MPRP, which migrated electrophoretically as a single band in anti-MPRP immune precipitates, contained two different in vitro polypeptides derived from two different mRNAs. These results are discussed in the context of the genetic polymorphism among the major anionic proline-rich proteins in the parotid and submandibular secretions of man."
https://openalex.org/W1508355071,"Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase from a young man with purine overproduction and decreased purine salvage in fibroblast cultures was found to have low activity at concentrations of purine substrates at which the enzyme from normal individuals showed near maximal activity. The low enzyme activity was not associated with changes in the values of the Km(app) and Vmax(app) for any of the enzyme substrates. However, the enzyme activity was susceptible to substrate inhibition by hypoxanthine and guanine. The values obtained for the true Km, true Vmax, and true Ki for hypoxanthine were 26 +/- 10 microM, 1761 +/- 382 microunits/mg of protein, and 80 +/- 20 microM, respectively. The pattern of the substrate inhibition, as seen on a plot of 1/v versus hypoxanthine concentration, was characteristic of that associated with the formation of a dead-end complex between the inhibitory substrate and an enzyme form with which it normally does not react. The nature of this enzyme form and that of the dead-end complex was determined from double inhibition experiments, which indicated that hypoxanthine interacted with an enzyme-PPi intermediate to form an enzyme-hypoxanthine-PPi dead-end complex. The trapping of the enzyme in this inactive form explains the low activity at high purine base concentrations. Further information as to the nature of the reaction mechanism was obtained from plots of the reciprocal of enzyme activity versus the reciprocal of PP-ribose-P concentration at different fixed hypoxanthine concentrations. A pattern characteristic of uncompetitive substrate inhibition was obtained. This is indicative of an ordered sequential binding of substrates on the enzyme; PP-ribose-P binding before hypoxanthine. Thus, the variant enzyme showed an ordered sequential reaction mechanism, with the inhibitory substrate forming a dead-end complex with an enzyme-PPi intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1552470994,"Incubation of synthetic dolichyl pyrophosphate tetrasaccharide and GDP-[14C]mannose with calf pancreas microsomes gave three lipid-linked oligosaccharides, which could be extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1) and separated on silica gel plates. The fastest migrating product was characterized as dolichyl pyrophosphate pentasaccharide based on gel filtration and high pressure liquid chromatography. The formation of the pentasaccharide-lipid was greatly stimulated by addition of synthetic tetrasaccharide-lipid and required the presence of Triton X-100. Dolichyl phosphate mannose could not replace GDP-mannose as a sugar donor. The structure of the pentasaccharide was determined by degradation with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase D, acetolysis, alpha-D-mannosidase, and concanavalin A-Sepharose chromatography, showing that the following reaction was taking place: alpha-D-Manp-(1 leads to 3)-beta-D-Manp-(1 leads to 4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1 leads to 4)-alpha-D-GlcpNAcPPDol + GDPMan leads to GDP + alpha-D-Manp-(1 leads to 3)-[alpha-D-Manp-(1 leads to 6)]-beta-D-Manp-(1 leads to 4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1 leads to 4)-alpha-D-GlcpNAcPPDol. The mannosyltransferase was partially characterized."
https://openalex.org/W1981478300,"A molecular model is presented for a messenger RNA (mRNA) ""splice region."" The model requires cation coordination to reduce backbone-backbone electrostatic repulsion and it allows for every base residue on the pre-mRNA to be stacked in A-form helical geometry with a recognition element on the intron or exon (or both) sides of the splice junction. The two nucleotides involved in the initial steps of the cleavage-ligation mechanism must adopt a non-A-form geometry, which ideally positions reactive groups on the pre-mRNA for the necessary catalytic chemistry. The model is also consistent with available biochemical data on splicing reactions."
