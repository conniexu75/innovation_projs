https://openalex.org/W2149963584,"Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–coupled receptors (GPCRs) respond to a variety of different external stimuli and activate G proteins. GPCRs share many structural features, including a bundle of seven transmembrane α helices connected by six loops of varying lengths. We determined the structure of rhodopsin from diffraction data extending to 2.8 angstroms resolution. The highly organized structure in the extracellular region, including a conserved disulfide bridge, forms a basis for the arrangement of the seven-helix transmembrane motif. The ground-state chromophore, 11- cis -retinal, holds the transmembrane region of the protein in the inactive conformation. Interactions of the chromophore with a cluster of key residues determine the wavelength of the maximum absorption. Changes in these interactions among rhodopsins facilitate color discrimination. Identification of a set of residues that mediate interactions between the transmembrane helices and the cytoplasmic surface, where G-protein activation occurs, also suggests a possible structural change upon photoactivation."

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy of biomineralization products of iron-oxidizing bacteria revealed an alternative coarsening mechanism in which adjacent 2- to 3-nanometer particles aggregate and rotate so their structures adopt parallel orientations in three dimensions. Crystal growth is accomplished by eliminating water molecules at interfaces and forming iron-oxygen bonds. Self-assembly occurs at multiple sites, leading to a coarser, polycrystalline material. Point defects (from surface-adsorbed impurities), dislocations, and slabs of structurally distinct material are created as a consequence of this growth mechanism and can dramatically impact subsequent reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2081383679,"Mass-independent isotopic signatures for delta(33)S, delta(34)S, and delta(36)S from sulfide and sulfate in Precambrian rocks indicate that a change occurred in the sulfur cycle between 2090 and 2450 million years ago (Ma). Before 2450 Ma, the cycle was influenced by gas-phase atmospheric reactions. These atmospheric reactions also played a role in determining the oxidation state of sulfur, implying that atmospheric oxygen partial pressures were low and that the roles of oxidative weathering and of microbial oxidation and reduction of sulfur were minimal. Atmospheric fractionation processes should be considered in the use of sulfur isotopes to study the onset and consequences of microbial fractionation processes in Earth's early history."
https://openalex.org/W2005048776,The radiation performance of a variety of complex oxides is predicted on the basis of a material's propensity to accommodate lattice point defects. The calculations indicate that a particular class of oxides possessing the fluorite crystal structure should accept radiation-induced defects into their lattices far more readily than a structurally similar class of oxides based on the pyrochlore crystal structure. Preliminary radiation damage experiments substantiate the prediction that fluorites are inherently more radiation resistant than pyrochlores. These results may permit the chemical durability and radiation tolerance of potential hosts for actinides and radioactive wastes to be tailored.

Here, we report the same toc1 effect in the absence of light input to the clock. We also show that TOC1 controls photoperiodic flowering response through clock function. The TOC1 gene was isolated and found to encode a nuclear protein containing an atypical response regulator receiver domain and two motifs that suggest a role in transcriptional regulation: a basic motif conserved within the CONSTANS family of transcription factors and an acidic domain. TOC1 is itself circadianly regulated and participates in a feedback loop to control its own expression."
https://openalex.org/W2020289420,"Surface waters of the subtropical Sargasso Sea contain dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) concentrations of 0.2 to 1.0 nanomolar, which are sufficiently low to result in phosphorus control of primary production. The DIP concentrations in this area (which receives high inputs of iron-rich dust from arid regions of North Africa) are one to two orders of magnitude lower than surface levels in the North Pacific (where eolian iron inputs are much lower and water column denitrification is much more substantial). These data indicate a severe relative phosphorus depletion in the Atlantic. We hypothesize that nitrogen versus phosphorus limitation of primary production in the present-day ocean may be closely linked to iron supply through control of dinitrogen (N2) fixation, an iron-intensive metabolic process. Although the oceanic phosphorus inventory may set the upper limit for the total amount of organic matter produced in the ocean over geological time scales, at any instant in geological time, oceanic primary production may fall below this limit because of a persistent insufficient iron supply. By controlling N2 fixation, iron may control not only nitrogen versus phosphorus limitation but also carbon fixation and export stoichiometry and hence biological sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide."
https://openalex.org/W2085752695,"Autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia is a rare human disease that shows a Mendelian inheritance pattern, but is characterized by large-scale mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions. We have identified two heterozygous missense mutations in the nuclear gene encoding the heart/skeletal muscle isoform of the adenine nucleotide translocator ( ANT1 ) in five families and one sporadic patient. The familial mutation substitutes a proline for a highly conserved alanine at position 114 in the ANT1 protein. The analogous mutation in yeast caused a respiratory defect. These results indicate that ANT has a role in mtDNA maintenance and that a mitochondrial disease can be caused by a dominant mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1997181834,"Caveolae are subcellular structures implicated in the import and transcytosis of macromolecules and in transmembrane signaling. To date, evidence for the existence of caveolae in hematopoietic cells has been ambiguous. Caveolae were detected in the microvilli and intracellular vesicles of cultured mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). CD48, a receptor for FimH-expressing (type 1 fimbriated) Escherichia coli, was specifically localized to plasmalemmal caveolae in BMMCs. The involvement of caveolae in bacterial entry into BMMCs was indicated because caveolae-disrupting and -usurping agents specifically blocked E. coli entry, and markers of caveolae were actively recruited to sites of bacterial entry. The formation of bacteria-encapsulating caveolar chambers in BMMCs represents a distinct mechanism of microbial entry into phagocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2045182653,"LEAFY ( LFY ) and APETALA1 ( AP1 ) encode unrelated transcription factors that activate overlapping sets of homeotic genes in Arabidopsis flowers. Sector analysis and targeted expression in transgenic plants were used to study whether LFY and AP1 can participate in cell-cell signaling between and within different layers of the floral meristem. LFY signaled equally well from all layers and had substantial long-range action within layers. Nonautonomous action of LFY was accompanied by movement of the protein to adjacent cells, where it directly activated homeotic target genes. In contrast, AP1 had only limited nonautonomous effects, apparently mediated by downstream genes because activation of early target genes by AP1 was cell-autonomous."
https://openalex.org/W2047598339,"The circadian oscillator of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, like those in eukaryotes, is entrained by environmental cues. Inactivation of the gene cikA (circadian input kinase) shortens the circadian period of gene expression rhythms in S. elongatus by approximately 2 hours, changes the phasing of a subset of rhythms, and nearly abolishes resetting of phase by a pulse of darkness. The CikA protein sequence reveals that it is a divergent bacteriophytochrome with characteristic histidine protein kinase motifs and a cryptic response regulator motif. CikA is likely a key component of a pathway that provides environmental input to the circadian oscillator in S. elongatus."
https://openalex.org/W2012221118,"We have studied the effects of hyperoxia and of cell loading with artificial lipofuscin or ceroid pigment on the postmitotic aging of human lung fibroblast cell cultures. Normobaric hyperoxia (40% oxygen) caused an irreversible senescence-like growth arrest after about 4 wk and shortened postmitotic life span from 1-1/2 years down to 3 months. During the first 8 wk of hyperoxia-induced 'aging', overall protein degradation (breakdown of [(35)S]methionine metabolically radiolabeled cell proteins) increased somewhat, but by 12 wk and thereafter overall proteolysis was significantly depressed. In contrast, protein synthesis rates were unaffected by 12 wk of hyperoxia. Lysosomal cathepsin-specific activity (using the fluorogenic substrate z-FR-MCA) and cytoplasmic proteasome-specific activity (measured with suc-LLVY-MCA) both declined by 80% or more over 12 wk. Hyperoxia also caused a remarkable increase in lipofuscin/ceroid formation and accumulation over 12 wk, as judged by both fluorescence measurements and FACscan methods. To test whether the association between lipofuscin/ceroid accumulation and decreased proteolysis might be causal, we next exposed cells to lipofuscin/ceroid loading under normoxic conditions. Lipofuscin/ceroid-loaded cells indeed exhibited a gradual decrease in overall protein degradation over 4 wk of treatment, whereas protein synthesis was unaffected. Proteasome specific activity decreased by 25% over this period, which is important since proteasome is normally responsible for degrading oxidized cell proteins. In contrast, an apparent increase in lysosomal cathepsin activity was actually caused by a large increase in the number of lysosomes per cell. To test whether lipofuscin/ceroid could in fact directly inhibit proteasome activity, thus causing oxidized proteins to accumulate, we incubated purified proteasome with lipofuscin/ceroid preparations in vitro. We found that proteasome is directly inhibited by lipofuscin/ceroid. Our results indicate that an accumulation of oxidized proteins (and lipids) such as lipofuscin/ceroid may actually cause further increases in damage accumulation during aging by inhibiting the proteasome."
https://openalex.org/W2075665556,"Mutations in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae PIF1 gene, which encodes a 5'-to-3' DNA helicase, cause telomere lengthening and a large increase in the formation rate of new telomeres. Here, we show that Pif1p acts by inhibiting telomerase rather than telomere-telomere recombination, and this inhibition requires the helicase activity of Pif1p. Overexpression of enzymatically active Pif1p causes telomere shortening. Thus, Pif1p is a catalytic inhibitor of telomerase-mediated telomere lengthening. Because Pif1p is associated with telomeric DNA in vivo, its effects on telomeres are likely direct. Pif1p-like helicases are found in diverse organisms, including humans. We propose that Pif1p-mediated inhibition of telomerase promotes genetic stability by suppressing telomerase-mediated healing of double-strand breaks."
https://openalex.org/W2072932595,"Ferromagnetic (FM) spin fluctuations are believed to mediate the spin-triplet pairing for the p-wave superconductivity in Sr(2)RuO(4). Our experiments show that, at the surface, a bulk soft-phonon mode freezes into a static lattice distortion associated with an in-plane rotation of the RuO(6) octahedron. First-principle calculations confirm this structure and predict a FM ground state at the surface. This coupling between structure and magnetism in the environment of broken symmetry at the surface allows a reconsideration of the coupling mechanism in the bulk."
https://openalex.org/W2026061099,"Establishment of cohesion between sister chromatids is coupled to replication fork passage through an unknown mechanism. Here we report that TRF4 , an evolutionarily conserved gene necessary for chromosome segregation, encodes a DNA polymerase with β-polymerase–like properties. A double mutant in the redundant homologs, TRF4 and TRF5 , is unable to complete S phase, whereas a trf4 single mutant completes a presumably defective S phase that results in a failure of cohesion between the replicated sister chromatids. This suggests that TRF s are a key link in the coordination between DNA replication and sister chromatid cohesion. Trf4 and Trf5 represent the fourth class of essential nuclear DNA polymerases (designated DNA polymerase kappa) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and probably in all eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2163350914,"Copper is an essential nutrient required for the activity of a number of enzymes with diverse biological roles. In the bakers' yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, copper is transported into cells by two high affinity copper transport proteins, Ctr1 and Ctr3. Although Ctr1 and Ctr3 are functionally redundant, they bear little homology at the amino acid sequence level. In this report, we characterize Ctr3 with respect to its localization, assembly, and post-transcriptional regulation. Ctr3 is an integral membrane protein that assembles as a trimer to form a competent copper uptake permease at the plasma membrane. Whereas the CTR1 andCTR3 genes are similarly regulated at the transcriptional level in response to copper, post-transcriptional regulation of these proteins is distinct. Unlike Ctr1, the Ctr3 transporter is neither regulated at the level of protein degradation nor endocytosis as a function of elevated copper levels.

Frieden E. Biochemistry of Copper. 10. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1991Google Scholar). When allowed to accumulate in excess, copper is toxic due to its proclivity to participate in Fenton-like reactions that lead to the generation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (2Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (4577) Google Scholar). Consequently, organisms have developed sophisticated mechanisms for maintaining the balance between essential and toxic copper levels. Studies of copper uptake inSaccharomyces cerevisiae have shown that copper is reduced from Cu(II) to Cu(I) by cell surface metalloreductases (3Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol.

Within cells copper is distributed to specific subcellular compartments or proteins by copper chaperones that include Atx1 which delivers copper to the Fet3 high affinity iron transport subunit in the secretory compartment (7Lin S.J.

Although inactivation of the yeast copper chaperone genes generates phenotypes specific for each copper delivery pathway, mutations in the both the CTR1 andCTR3 genes result in yeast cells that exhibit phenotypic defects associated with mutations in all three of the copper chaperone genes (5Dancis A.

Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1917-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In addition, these cells are defective in high affinity copper uptake resulting in poor growth on low copper media and defective in their ability to activate transcription of theCUP1-encoded metallothionein, except at copper concentrations beyond the high affinity range, due to an inability to provide copper to the metalloregulatory transcription factor Ace1 (5Dancis A.

Because copper uptake at the cell membrane is a crucial step in copper acquisition, yeast genes encoding the high affinity copper transport proteins are tightly regulated in response to copper levels to ensure that sufficient copper is present for cellular needs. In S. cerevisiae transcription of the CTR1 andCTR3 genes is activated during copper starvation and repressed under conditions of copper adequacy (11Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17711-17718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). At the post-transcriptional level Ctr1 protein has been shown to be regulated by two distinct processes (14Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). At low copper concentrations (0.1–1 μm) Ctr1 undergoes copper-induced endocytosis, although the role of Ctr1 internalization in copper uptake is currently unclear. Furthermore, exposure of yeast cells to high copper concentrations (≥10 μm) triggers the degradation of Ctr1 at the plasma membrane in a mechanism that is independent of endocytosis and vacuolar proteases (14Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The Ctr1 and Ctr3 high affinity copper transport proteins are functionally redundant. However, there is little homology between their amino acid sequences, and they are structurally distinct (15Labbe S. Thiele D.J. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 500-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although both proteins possess three potential membrane spanning domains, Ctr1 is a 406-amino acid protein that is highly glycosylated and harbors eight repeats of the potential metal-binding motif MX 2MXM (Mets domain) in the predicted amino-terminal extracellular domain (5Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). These motifs are repeated twice in the putative human and mouse copper transport proteins, hCtr1 and mCtr1, and five times in the fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe copper transport protein Ctr4 (15Labbe S. Thiele D.J. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 500-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Ctr3 lacks this motif but has an abundance of cysteine residues throughout the protein (11 Cys of 241 total residues) and within its putative transmembrane domains. Since both methionine and cysteine are potential copper-binding ligands (16Koch K.A. Pena M.M. Thiele D.J. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 549-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), these residues may be important for copper uptake. Alignment of the sequences of Ctr1 and Ctr3 with theS. pombe Ctr4, human and mouse Ctr1, and putative copper transport proteins in existing data bases from Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster reveal the following observations. First, the copper transport family of proteins is defined by the presence of three transmembrane domains. Second, with the exception of S. cerevisiae Ctr1, the transmembrane spanning regions exhibit high similarity to the Ctr3 transmembrane domains with several highly conserved residues present in all sequences. Third, the predicted ectodomains of the known copper transporters, and some of the putative copper transporters, are similar to Ctr1 with respect to the presence of the MX 2MXM motif that is predicted to bind copper. The conservation of these domains between yeast and mammalian systems suggests an important functional role in copper binding and transport. Taken together, it appears possible that the fusion of S. cerevisiae Ctr1 and Ctr3-like proteins may be an early event that led to the evolution of high affinity copper transport proteins of other eukaryotes (15Labbe S. Thiele D.J. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 500-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 17Labbe S. Pena M.M. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36252-36260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Since most eukaryotic high affinity copper transporters identified to date have strong homology to Ctr3, it is important to understand the structure, function, and regulation of this protein. Here we show that Ctr3 exists as a trimer at the plasma membrane to form the competent copper uptake permease. Of the 11 cysteine residues distributed throughout Ctr3, only mutations in four of these amino acid residues affect Ctr3 function and localization. These mutants can assemble as a trimer, as assessed by in vitro cross-linking experiments; however, the mutant protein complexes fail to localize at the plasma membrane suggesting that assembly of the competent permease takes place in the secretory pathway. At the post-transcriptional level, Ctr3 is distinctly regulated compared with Ctr1 in response to copper. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Strains were maintained in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% BactoPeptone, 2% dextrose) or in the corresponding drop-out media for the maintenance of yeast strains transformed with plasmids.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeRef.MPY17MATa ctr1::ura3::Kanr ctr3::TRP1 his3 lys2-802 CUP1r44Pena M.M.

The plasmids pRS426-CTR3 and pRS426-CTR3-NotI have the sameCTR3 fragments on a 2 μm plasmid. pRS416-CTR3-GFP and pRS426-CTR3-GFP were constructed by inserting a NotI fragment containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP)1 (18Inouye S. Tsuji F.I. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) derived from pSF1-GP1 at the NotI sites of pRS416-CTR3-NOTIand pRS426-CTR3-NOTI. Construction of pRS416-CTR3-FLAG(2) was carried out as follows: two oligonucleotides, FLAG(2)UP (5′-GGCCGAGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAAGGCGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAAGAC-3′) and FLAG(2)LOW (5′-GGCCGTCTTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGCCTTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCTC-3′), encoding two copies of the FLAG epitope (19Knappik A. Pluckthun A. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 754-761PubMed Google Scholar), were boiled and annealed in the presence of 50 mm NaCl and 1× BRL ligation buffer generating EagI overhangs. These oligonucleotides were ligated into NotI-digested pRS416-CTR3-NotI and pRS426-CTR3-NotI plasmids and digested with NotI prior to transformation into Escherichia coli DH5α′ cells. Proper orientation of the FLAG(2) tag was verified by dideoxy DNA sequencing. The plasmid pRS413-CTR3-myc(2) was constructed as described above using the following oligonucleotides: MYC(2)UP (5′-GGCCGAGAACAAAAGCTTATTTCTGAAGAAGACTTAGGCGAACAAAAGCTTATTTCTGAAGAAGACTTAGAC-3′) and MYC(2)DOWN (5′-GGCCGTCTAAGTCTTCTTCAGAAATAAGCTTTTGTTCGCCTAAGTCTTCTTCAGAAATAAGCTTTTGTTCTC-3′), encoding two copies of the c-myc epitope (20Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). To test whether insertion of the epitope tags and GFP interfered with Ctr3 function, the tagged CTR3 genes were transformed into MPY17, a ctr1Δ ctr3Δ double deletion strain, and serial dilutions of the transformants tested for their ability to grow in ethanol, a non-fermentable carbon source. Plasmids pRS423-GAL1-CTR3-myc(2) and pRS423-GAL1-CTR3-FLAG(2) were constructed as follows: two polymerase chain reaction fragments encompassing theCTR3 open reading frame starting at −50 from the translational start codon up to +21 after the stop codon, including the epitope tags, were amplified using Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene) from pRS413-CTR3-myc(2) and pRS416-CTR3-FLAG(2), respectively with the primers CTR3-START (5′-CGAAGAAGAGGGATACAACAG-3′) and CTR3-END (5′-CAAACCTCTCGGCTTTCCTCT-3′). These fragments were then cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pRS423-GAL1 (21Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Plasmid p426-GAL1-CTR1-GFP was constructed by amplifying theCTR1 open reading frame from genomic DNA usingPfu Turbo polymerase and the primers CTR1atgS (5′-GGACCCGGGATGGAAGGTATGAATATGGGT-3′) and CTR1tNPH (5′-CGGCTTTTTAAGTGAGTATTGCCGCCGGCGATTGACGTCTTCGAACCC-3′). The polymerase chain reaction fragment was cloned into the SmaI and HindIII sites on p426-Gal1 (21Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) and the GFP tag inserted into a NotI site engineered prior to the CTR1STOP codon. For localization of Ctr3, MPY17 cells transformed with plasmids harboring the CTR3-GFPfusion were grown on YPE medium (1% yeast extract, 2% BactoPeptone, 3% ethanol). Cells were resuspended in liquid YPE and immobilized on slides with 1% low melting agarose. Ctr3-GFP was visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioskop photomicroscope with filters for observing green fluorescence. Cells were photographed with Kodak TMAX 400 print film. The negatives were digitized to CD-ROM and optimized for contrast and sharpness using Adobe Photoshop 3.0. For copper-dependent endocytosis of Ctr1 and Ctr3, fluorescence microscopy was carried out using a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescent microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-2 cooled CCD camera. Images were obtained using ESee and ISee software packages from Innovision, Corp. (Raleigh-Durham, NC) and processed using Adobe Photoshop 3.0. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, MPY17 cells were co-transformed with pRS416-CTR3-FLAG(2) andpRS413-CTR3-myc(2). Cells were grown to OD650 = 1.0 in the presence of 10 μm of the copper chelator bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS). Total cell lysates were obtained by glass bead disruption in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 tablet of Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per 10 ml of lysis buffer) followed by solubilization with 1% Triton X-100 on ice for 30 min and centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Protein extracts were quantitated using bicinchoninic acid (Pierce). Co-immunoprecipitation of Ctr3-FLAG(2) and Ctr3-myc(2) was carried out on Triton X-100 extracts using anti-FLAG M2 Affi-Gel (Sigma) or anti-c-myc 9E10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) antibody as described previously (11Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and heated at 37 °C for 5 min prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis using standard protocols (22). For in vitro cross-linking experiments, total cell lysate was prepared from cells expressing Ctr3-FLAG(2) as described above using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) instead of Tris-HCl. Lysates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with increasing concentrations of ethylene glycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS) (Pierce) using stock solutions of 15 and 50 mm EGS in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The cross-linking reaction was quenched with 45 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, followed by incubation for 30 min at room temperature. The cross-linked products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Cross-linking experiments using EGS were also carried out on intact membranes obtained from lysed spheroplasts as described previously (23Belden W.J. Barlowe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26939-26946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 24Marcusson E.G. Horazdovsky B.F. Cereghino J.L. Gharakhanian E. Emr S.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 579-586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The membranes were washed with PBS prior to cross-linking. After cross-linking, the membranes were incubated with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice to solubilize the membranes followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The cross-linked complexes were immunoprecipitated from the clarified extracts using anti-FLAG M2 Affi-Gel beads for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of fresh protease inhibitors. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and the complexes were eluted from the beads with 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.0 and neutralized with 1.0 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The immunoprecipitated complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under denaturing and non-denaturing conditions and immunoblotting. For the analysis of copper-induced degradation of Ctr3 and Ctr1, W303 cells were transformed with p426-Gal1-CTR3-FLAG(2) and p426-Gal1-CTR1-myc. For copper-dependent endocytosis wild type (RH1800) cells and the corresponding endocytosis-deficient mutant, RH3777 (end3–1) (25Raths S. Rohrer J. Crausaz F. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), were transformed with p426-Gal1-CTR3-GFP and p426-Gal1-CTR1-GFP. Cells were grown and treated with copper or BCS as described previously (14Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For endocytosis experiments, cells were incubated at 15 °C for 15 min while shaking at 300 rpm, followed by the addition of 10 μm copper sulfate or BCS. After 1 h incubation, cells were treated with one-tenth volume of KILL buffer (1.0 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmsodium azide, 100 mm sodium fluoride) to stop endocytosis (26Urbanowski J.L. Piper R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38061-38070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Endocytosis of Ctr3-GFP and Ctr1-GFP was observed using a Nikon microscope as described above. Site-directed mutagenesis of theCTR3 gene was performed using the ChameleonTMDouble-stranded Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. Specific oligonucleotides were synthesized to convert cysteine residues to serine or alanine and tyrosine residues to phenylalanine. The template used for mutagenesis was pIBI30-CTR3 containing the CTR3 open reading frame with 349 base pairs of the 5′ promoter and 328 base pairs of the 3′-flanking regions. The mutated genes were cloned into pRS316 at theXhoI and SstI sites and transformed into S. cerevisiae MPY17 cells to test for function. Our previous localization studies of Ctr3, using a Ctr3-HA-tagged allele, found that it predominantly localized to intracellular vesicles consistent with the secretory compartment (6Knight S.A. Labbe S. Kwon L.F. Kosman D.J. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1917-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, subsequent phenotypic analysis of the Ctr3-HA epitope-tagged protein demonstrated that it is only partially functional in high affinity copper transport. To facilitate a re-analysis of the localization and biochemical characterization of Ctr3, a plasmid-borne copy of CTR3 was engineered to add aNotI site at the carboxyl terminus just prior to the STOP codon for the insertion of different epitopes. Two copies each of the FLAG epitope, c-myc epitope, and a single copy of the GFP were inserted into the NotI site. Plasmids expressing the tagged Ctr3 proteins were transformed into a ctr1Δctr3Δ strain, and a serial dilution series of each culture was analyzed for respiratory competency as compared with the wild typeCTR3 gene. As shown in Fig.1 A, all of the epitope-tagged alleles used in this study functionally complement the respiratory deficiency of a ctr1Δ ctr3Δ strain in a manner indistinguishable from the CTR3 wild type allele. The Ctr3-GFP fusion protein was localized to the plasma membrane by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1 B). As a control, a functional fusion between the yeast heat shock transcription factor and GFP was localized to the nucleus (27Liu X.D. Liu P.C. Santoro N. Thiele D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6466-6477Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the unfused GFP protein was distributed throughout cells. To ascertain if Ctr3 traverses the normal route for plasma membrane proteins through the secretory pathway for localization to the plasma membrane, Ctr3-GFP was expressed and localized in temperature-sensitive sec12-4 mutant cells. Although at the permissive temperature protein secretion is normal in the sec12-4 background, at the non-permissive temperature (37 °C) transport from the ER to the Golgi is blocked in this mutant (28Nakano A. Brada D. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 29Kaiser C.A. Schekman R. Cell. 1990; 61: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The sec12-4 mutant cells expressing Ctr3-GFP were grown at the permissive (25 °C) and non-permissive temperatures, and Ctr3-GFP protein was localized by fluorescence microscopy. At the permissive temperature in both wild type and sec12-4 cells Ctr3-GFP was localized to the plasma membrane. However, at the restrictive temperature in sec12-4 cells, but not wild type cells, Ctr3-GFP was trapped in a perinuclear compartment that is likely to be the ER (Fig. 1 C). This was observed for the Ctr3-GFP fusion protein expressed from either a single copy plasmid or a high copy plasmid where ER extensions approaching the plasma membrane are visible. These experiments demonstrate that, consistent with its role in copper uptake, the normal localization of Ctr3 is at the plasma membrane. The primary sequences of the known or predicted high affinity copper transport proteins in yeast, mouse, and human all predict the presence of three membrane spanning domains. This feature is unique in that the numerous membrane permeases and transport proteins that have been characterized in yeast possess at least 6 and up to 12 or more transmembrane domains (30Serrano R. Broach J.R. Pringle J. Jones E.W. Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 523-585Google Scholar). Furthermore, metal ion transporters that have been characterized in both yeast and mammalian cells that transport zinc, iron, intracellular copper, and other metals have at least 6 and up to 12 transmembrane domains (31Rolfs A. Hediger M.A. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 518: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because several membrane spanning domains are thought to be important for the formation of a membrane channel, we examined the possibility that Ctr3 multimerizes to form the competent copper-transporting permease. Ctr3-FLAG(2) and Ctr3-myc(2) were co-expressed from different plasmids in a ctr1Δ ctr3Δ double deletion strain. Total Triton X-100-solubilized extracts from these cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody, immunoprecipitates resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-c-myc 9E10 antibody. The converse experiment was performed by immunoprecipitation with the anti-c-myc 9E10 antibody and immunoblot analysis using anti-FLAG M2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2, Ctr3-myc(2) and Ctr3-FLAG(2) can be detected in total protein extracts from cells expressing either protein by itself (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3) or with the other protein (Fig. 2, lane 4). However, immunoprecipitation of Ctr3-myc(2) with anti-FLAG M2 antibody can be accomplished only when it is co-expressed with Ctr3-FLAG(2) (Fig. 2,lane 8). Conversely, Ctr3-FLAG(2) can be immunoprecipitated with anti-c-myc 9E10 antibody only when it is co-expressed with Ctr3-myc(2) (Fig. 2, lane 8), suggesting that these differentially tagged Ctr3 molecules can assemble into a multimeric complex when co-expressed in the same cells. Neither protein can be detected in cells that were transformed with vectors only (Fig. 2,lane 1). To assess the specificity of the co-immunoprecipitations, the total cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were probed with polyclonal antibodies against Pma1, the plasma membrane H+ATPase that is detected as a 100-kDa protein (32Wang Q. Chang A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5972-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and Gas1, a glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane glycoprotein (33Fankhauser C. Conzelmann A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Two forms of Gas1 are detected, the 125-kDa plasma membrane-bound protein and the 113-kDa ER form of the protein (33Fankhauser C. Conzelmann A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, both Pma1 and Gas1 are present in the total cell extracts (lanes 1–4) but not in the immunoprecipitates. These observations suggest that the Ctr3-FLAG(2) and Ctr3-myc(2) proteins specifically associate with each other to form a stable mixed multimer that can be co-immunoprecipitated from cell extracts. A similar observation has been reported for the S. cerevisiaeCtr1 protein (11Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To estimate the stoichiometry of Ctr3 molecules present in a copper transport complex, cross-linking experiments were carried out on Triton X-100-solubilized total cell extracts from cells expressing Ctr3-FLAG(2) using the cross-linking agent EGS (34Abdella P.M. Smith P.K. Royer G.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1979; 87: 734-742Google Scholar). The cross-linked products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-FLAG M2 antibody. In the absence of EGS, Ctr3-FLAG(2) migrates as a 27-kDa monomeric protein (Fig.3 A, lane 1) consistent with its predicted mass and suggesting little or no glycosylation. As the EGS concentration is increased, Ctr3-FLAG(2) forms a ∼54-kDa complex consistent with the size expected for a Ctr3 homodimer (Fig. 3 A, lane 2), and at 0.5 mm EGS an ∼82-kDa complex, equivalent to the size expected for a Ctr3 homotrimer, is detected (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). As the EGS concentration is increased to 1.0 mm, the dimeric and trimeric forms are detected with concomitant disappearance of the 27-kDa monomeric Ctr3-FLAG(2) (lane 4). In the presence of 2 and 3 mm EGS, th"

Previous studies indicated that the virus-mediated transcription of type I interferon (IFN) genes required activation of two members of IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family, IRF-3 and IRF-7, where the expression of IRF-7 was found to be indispensable for the induction of IFNA genes. To determine the factors that regulate expression of IRF-7 gene, as well as its inducibility by type I IFNs, we have isolated and characterized the promoter and first intron of the human IRF-7 gene. This region shows a presence of two potential interferon-sensitive response elements (ISRE/IRF-E). However, only the ISRE present in the first intron was functional and conferred interferon inducibility in a transient transfection assay. Using a pull-down assay with an oligodeoxynucleotide corresponding to this ISRE immobilized to magnetic beads, we have demonstrated that this ISRE binds ISGF3 complex and IRF-1 from the extract of IFN-treated cells but not from the untreated cells. We have further shown that the previously observed lack of expression of IRF-7 in 2fTGH fibrosarcoma cell line, correlated with hypermethylation of the CpG island in the human IRF-7 promoter. The repression of the promoter activity was relieved by treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-deoxycytidine. In vitro methylation ofIRF-7 promoter silenced IRF-7 directed expression of luciferase gene in HeLa cells that express endogenous IRF-7 gene. Whether silencing of IRF-7 by methylation is instrumental for the process of tumorigenesis remains to be determined.

The molecular mechanism by which virus activates expression of the early inflammatory genes has not yet been completely elucidated. It was shown, however, that activation of the NFκB family of transcription factors in infected cells plays a critical role in the transcriptional activation of many cytokine and chemokine genes, since large number of these genes contains NFκB-binding sites in their promoters. Recently the importance of another family of transcription factors as the mediators of virus induced signaling has emerged. These factors designated interferon (IFN)1 regulatory factors (IRF) were shown to play an important role in the induction of the early inflammatory genes in infected cells as well as in development of cells of lymphoid lineage (1Pitha P.M.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The IRF-3 and IRF-7 have been identified as direct transducers of virus mediated signaling and were shown to play a critical role in the induction of Type I IFN genes (3Au W.-C. Moore P.A. Lowther W.

In infected cells, these factors are phosphorylated on C-terminal serines and majority of the phosphorylated IRFs was localized in the nucleus (8Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Genin P. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J.

Biol. 2000; 20: 4159-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). There are, however, differences in their expression. IRF-3 is expressed constitutively in most of the cells examined and its expression is enhanced neither by viral infection or IFN treatment (3Au W.-C. Moore P.A. Lowther W. Juang Y.T. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11657-11661Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 12Lowther W.J. Moore P.A. Carter K.C. Pitha P.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, human IRF-7 is expressed effectively only in lymphoid tissues, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and some cell lines of lymphoid origin and its transcription can be further stimulated by treatment with IFNα. However, none or very little expression of IRF-7 could be detected in established cell lines of fibroblast or epithelial origin (4Au W.-C. Moore P.A. LaFleur D.W. Tombal B. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29210-29217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated the critical role of IRF-7 in the virus-mediated induction of IFNA genes both in human and mouse cells and closely correlated the virus mediated, cell type-specific expression of IFN genes with the presence of IRF-7 in the cells (13Yeow W.-S.

Thus, the cells that were not able to express IFNA genes upon viral infection were able to do so upon reconstitution of IRF-7 expression (13Yeow W.-S. Au W.-C. Juang Y.T. Fields C.D. Dent C.L. Gewert D.R. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6313-6320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 14Sato M. Hata N. Asagiri M. Nakaya T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The role of IRF-7 was also implied in virus-mediated induction ofIFNB and RANTES genes (7Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 16Genin P. Algarte M. Roof P. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5352-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the levels of IRF-7 were found to be an important determinant in the regulated expression of the EBV-encoded EBNA-1 gene, where the silencing of Qp promoter, that regulates expression ofEBNA-1 gene in EBV-associated tumors, was correlated with the expression of IRF-7 (17Zhang L. Pagano J.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18Zhang L. Pagano J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5748-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). These results indicated that the levels of IRF-7 in the cells may not only modulate the virus-mediated inflammatory responses but may also affect the EBV-associated malignancies. The hereditary silencing of gene expression can occur by mutational and epigenetic pathways. The silencing of gene expression by methylation of the CpG dinucleotides, especially those located in the CpG clusters, has been shown to occur relatively frequently in immortalized and transformed cells (19Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 168-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). The aberrant methylation has been associated with the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in human cancers and may also play a role in the control of cell type-specific gene expression. Recent studies have shown that the methyl-CpG-binding protein can bind transcriptional co-repressor Sin3A and recruits histone deacetylase to methylated DNA (20Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar). This results in deacetylation of the chromatin and formation of a transcriptionally repressive chromatin around the methylated DNA. What determine the methylation status of CpG islands is still not clear. Several DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) were identified. The DNMT-1 was shown to preferentially methylate hemimethylated DNA and is therefore believed to function as maintenance methyltransferase (21Bird A. Science. 1999; 286: 2287-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Elevated levels and activity of DNMT-1 were observed in cancer cells in vitro(22Bakin A.V. Curran T. Science. 1999; 283: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, the knock-out studies (23Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4348) Google Scholar) suggested that two other methyltransferase, DNMT-3a and DNMT-3b, are responsible forde novo DNA methylation and mutations in DNMT-3b gene are associated with the ICF immunodeficiency syndrome (23Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4348) Google Scholar, 24Hansen R.S. Wijmenga C. Luo P. Stanek A.M. Canfield T.K. Weemaes C.M. Gartler S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14412-14417Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to determine the critical factors that regulate type I IFN-stimulated expression of IRF-7 gene as well as the mechanism by which expression of IRF-7 gene is silenced in some cell lines. To this effect we have isolated the promoter of the human IRF-7 gene and have shown by deletion and mutation analyses that it contained two interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE)/IRF-E like elements. However, only one of them was functionally active and able to confer the IFN-α mediated activation of IRF-7 promoter. Furthermore, we have shown that hypermethylation of the CpG island in the IRF-7 promoter is responsible for the silencing of the IRF-7 gene in 2fTGH fibrosarcoma line. Expression of IRF-7 gene and stimulation by IFN could be rescued in non-expressing cells by treatment with 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-AzaC). Human cells HeLa, 2fTGH, and U2A were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Jurkat T cells were cultivated in RPMI plus 10% FBS. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against IRF-1 (C-20), IRF-2 (C-19), STAT 1 (E-23), STAT 2 (N-17), and ISGF-3γ (C-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. λ DASH II genomic library containing the BamHI genomic DNA fragment of human lung carcinoma NCI H157 cell line, was screened by hybridization with full-length IRF-7 cDNA probe for the phage harboring theIRF-7 genomic DNA. Two plaques (from 2.50 × 105 plated) showing positive hybridization withIRF-7 cDNA probe were purified by three rounds of purification. The corresponding phage DNA was purified (Qiagen λ phage DNA isolation kit) and digested with various restriction enzymes to construct a restriction map. The result indicated that the insert containing genomic DNA was about 12 kb (data not shown). TheEcoRI-digested genomic DNA fragments were then cloned into pBluescript vector (Stratagene). The clone containing EcoRI insert with IRF-7 sequences was identified by colony hybridization, and PCR amplification. The insert DNA was sequenced and the sequences were compared with the IRF-7 cDNA sequence. Cells were transfected in 60-mm dishes by Superfect transfection method (Qiagen). One microgram of the reporter plasmid DNA and 0.1 μg of β-galactosidase expressing plasmid (internal control) were used for each transfection. In a co-transfection experiment, 1:1 ratio of the reporter and expression plasmid (1 μg of each) were used. The final concentration of transfected DNA was kept constant in all co-transfection assays. Transfected cells were split 12 h after transfection into 35-mm 6-well plates, and incubated for another 6 h after which the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 2% FBS and recombinant IFN-α2 (500 units/ml). After an additional 12 h, the cells were harvested, lysed, and luciferase activity was measured as described previously (25Ye J. Xu R.H. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6178-6189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated at least three times. A 1.6-kb fragment of IRF-7 promoter containing the TATA box and the first intron was amplified by PCR, using primer set RL1S, RL1AS (see Table I), andEcoRI fragment of IRF-7 genomic DNA as template. The fidelity of PCR transcription was confirmed by sequencing and the amplified fragment was inserted into XhoI andHindIII sites of pGL3-basic vector (Invitrogen). This plasmid (designated RL1) was used as the parental plasmid to generate (by PCR) a serial of mutation and deletion constructs (Fig.2 B). A PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method (26Deyrup A.T.

The primers IRF-EMS and IRF-EMAS (Table I) were used for mutation of the IRF-E site (RL2 plasmid). The primers ISRE-MS and ISRE-MAS were used to mutate the ISRE site (RL3 plasmid). The deletion construct RL5 was generated using RL5S and RL1AS primers and RL1S and RL6AS primers were used to construct RL6. The plasmids containing IRF-E or ISRE sites and their flanking sequences (RL7, RL7M, RL8, and RL8M plasmids) were generated by inserting the respective double stranded oligodeoxynucleotide fragments into XhoI andHindIII sites of pGL3-promoter vector (Invitrogen). The oligonucleotides used for generation of RL7 plasmid were IRF-ES and IRF-EAS; for RL7M plasmid, IRF-EMS, and IRF-E1MAS; for RL8 plasmid, ISRE-S, and ISRE-AS; and for RL8M plasmid ISRE-MS and ISRE-MAS (TableI).Table IPrimers and oligonucleotidesNameSequenceRL1S5′ AGCTAGTCTGGAAGTTCTTCTTC 3′RL1AS5′ GAGCCAAGGCCATTGCTCTTC 3′IRF-ES5′ CGCTTGGGTAACAAAAGCGAAACTCCATCTCAAC 3′IRF-EAS5′ GTTGAGATGGAGTTTCGCTTTTGTTACCCAAGCG 3′IRF-EMS5′ CGCTTGGGTAACAAAAGCTTAACTCCATCTCAAC 3′IRF-EMAS5′ GTTGAGATGGAGTTAAGCTTTTGTTACCCAAGCG 3′ISRE-S5′ GGGTCAGGCTCCCGGGAAAGCGAAACCTAAACAGTGGCGC 3′ISRE-AS5′ GCGCCACTGTTTAGGTTTCGCTTTCCCGGGAGCCTGACCC 3′ISRE-MS5′ GGGTCAGGCTCCCGGGAAAGCATAACCTAAACAGTGGCGC 3′ISRE-MAS5′ GCGCCACTGTTTAGGTTATGCTTTCCCGGGAGCCTGACCC 3′RL5S5′ CGCAAACGGTGCAGCTGC 3′RL6AS5′ CAGTGGCGCTTCGC 3′MS15′ GTCGGTTTTTCGTTTTTTCGC 3′MAS15′ CGTCCGATTCTCAACTCCG 3′UMS15′ TAAAAGTGTTGGTTTTTTGTTTTTTTGT 3′UMAS15′ CATCCAATTCTCAACTCCA 3′MS25′ GCGGAGTTGAGAATCGGAC 3′MAS25′ AAAAAACGCAAACCGAACCCTACG 3′Primers and oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized at Life Technologies CustomePrimers.

HeLa cells were cultivated in the presence of 5 μm 5-AzaC for 4 days in DMEM and 10% FBS with fresh drug added every 24 h. Control cells were grown under identical conditions in medium without 5-AzaC. At day 5, cells were either treated with 500 units/ml interferon-α for 6 h or only incubated for additional 6 h. Total RNA from control and stimulated cells was analyzed by Northern blot. Northern blot analysis was done as described before (4Au W.-C. Moore P.A. LaFleur D.W. Tombal B. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

Random-primed32P-labeled human IRF-7 cDNA encoding the entire open reading frame was used as a probe. Biotinylated antisense oligonucleotides (IRF-EAS and ISRE-AS) containing IRF-E/ISRE sites were synthesized (Life Technologies. Inc.) and then annealed with the corresponding sense oligodeoxynucleotides. Biotinylated DNA (4 μg) was then mixed with 100 μg of DynaBeads M-280 streptavidin (Dynal) in 200 μl of binding buffer I containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.1 m NaCl. After 1 h incubation at room temperature, the beads were washed three times with binding buffer I and then resuspended in 330 μl of binding buffer II (10% glycerol, 12 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described before (13Yeow W.-S. Au W.-C. Juang Y.T. Fields C.D. Dent C.L. Gewert D.R. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6313-6320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) from control cells and cells stimulated with 500 units/ml interferon-α for 2 h. Then 150 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with 40 μl of DNA-conjugated beads, containing either IRF-E or ISRE oligodeoxynucleotides in binding buffer II, for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with binding buffer II three times before the bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in sample buffer. The proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to membranes. The membranes were blocked by 10% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% of Tween 20. The individual proteins were identified by immunoblotting with antibodies against IRF-1, IRF-2, P48/IRF-9, STAT 1, and STAT 2 used at a dilution of 1:1000. The signals on the blots were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) Genomic DNA was prepared as described (27Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Myohanen S. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9821-9826Crossref PubMed Scopus (5174) Google Scholar). One microgram of DNA was denatured in 50 μl of 0.2m NaOH for 10 min at 37 °C. For the chemical modification of DNA, 520 μl of 3 m sodium bisulfite (Sigma) and 30 μl of 10 mm hydroquinone (Sigma) were added to the DNA solution and the samples were incubated for 16 h at 50 °C. Modified DNA was purified on Wizard purification resin (Promega) and eluted in water (50 μl). As a final step, NaOH was added to a final concentration of 0.3 m and the samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. DNA was precipitated by ethanol and resuspended in water. DNA methylation status in the CpG islands ofIRF-7 promoter was analyzed by treatment with sodium bisulfite and subsequent PCR amplification (MSP). The rationale of using MSP method to detect methylation status of the CpG-rich region is based on the conversion of cytosine to uracil after bisulfite treatment of DNA and has been previously validated for number of methylated genes (27Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Myohanen S. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9821-9826Crossref PubMed Scopus (5174) Google Scholar). The sodium bisulfite treatment of DNA and MSP were performed as described previously (27Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Myohanen S. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9821-9826Crossref PubMed Scopus (5174) Google Scholar). The primer sequences for the amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA fragments are listed in Table I. The size of amplified DNA fragment using these primers is 226 bp. PCR conditions for the amplification of methylated and ummethylated DNA were as follows: reaction was started at 94 °C for 5 min before the addition of Taq polymerase (Promega). Amplification was 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The final extension was done at 72 °C for 7 min. Controls without DNA were performed for each set of amplifications. Amplified products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel, and visualized after staining with ethidium bromide. The amplified DNA was purified using a GENECLEAN kit II (BIO-101) and sequenced. Plasmid DNA isolated from RL1 plasmid, containing a CpG island (as determined by GeneTool program) was methylated in vitro usingSssI methylase (1 units/μg; New England Biolabs), which methylates every CpG site. Complete methylation was verified by digestion with the methylation sensitive restriction enzymeHpaII. Only plasmids that showed a complete protection fromHpaII digestion were used in the transfection experiments. To establish stably transfected cell lines, HeLa cells plated in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 10 μg of either the methylated or unmethylated RL1 plasmid together with 1 μg of β-galactosidase expressing plasmid, used as an internal control, and pSV2neo vector which confers resistance to G418 (1 μg). The transfectants were selected in medium containing 800 μg/ml G418, and surviving colonies were pooled after 4 weeks. The pooled cells were treated with recombinant IFN alpha (500 units/ml) for 12 h and luciferase activity was measured in cell lysated prepared from treated and untreated cells. Using the full-length IRF-7 cDNA as probe we have screened the human genomic library (see “Experimental Procedures”), and isolated a 3-kb fragment of genomic IRF-7 DNA containing 5′-flanking DNA and the first intron of IRF-7 gene. The sequence of the 1.3-kb fragment containing the promoter region and the first intron of the IRF-7 gene are shown in Fig.1 (GenBank accession number AF277159). Using TRANSFAC data base and TESS-String-based search, we have identified the TATA box in this sequence and several potential transcription factor-binding sites such as NFκB, STAT6, C/EBP, NF-IL2A, and sterol response element-binding protein, SREBP, that may be involved in the modulation of the transcriptional activity of IRF-7 promoter. In addition, we have identified two IRF-E/ISRE elements: one is located 5′ of the TATA box and the other in the first intron. The translation start sites for the two spliced variants of IRF-7, IRF-7A, and IRF-7H, as well as the beginning of the second intron are marked by arrows in Fig. 1. Sequence analysis of the 1.6-kb fragment containing the IRF-7 promoter and the first intron shows a presence of two potential ISRE/IRF-E-binding sites (TableII). One is in the 5′-flanking region of the IRF-7 gene and its sequence closely resembles the IRF-E site, the second one that is closely related to ISRE is in the first intron of the IRF-7 gene (Fig. 1). In order to determine the role of the IRF-E and ISRE sites in the IFN-α mediated stimulation ofIRF-7 gene, we have constructed reporter plasmids containing either the entire 1.6-kb region (RL1) or its deletion (RL5 and 6) and mutation fragments (RL2, -3, and -4) inserted 5′ of the luciferase gene in the pGL-3 vector (Fig. 2 B). The transcriptional activities of these promoters were analyzed in a transient transfection assay in HeLa cells before and after induction with IFN-α. We have chosen HeLa cells for these studies because these cells express IRF-7 gene constitutively (IRF-7 mRNA can be detected in these cells by RT-PCR, data not shown) and its levels can be further enhanced by treatment with IFN-α (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, the transfection efficiency of these cells is consistently high. As can be seen in Fig. 2 C, transfection of RL1 plasmid, that contains an entire 1.6-kb fragment of the 5′ end flanking region and the first intron, resulted in a significant level of luciferase activity that was about 6 times higher than when the promoterless pGL-3 vector was transfected. These results indicated that in HeLa cells this promoter is activated constitutively which correlated with the observed constitutive expression of the endogenousIRF-7 gene. Treatment of the transfected cells with IFN-α for 12 h resulted in about 3.5-fold increase in luciferase activity. The mutation in the IRF-E site that is localized in the promoter region (RL2 plasmid) resulted only in a slight decrease in both constitutive and inducible promoter activity (81 and 72% of RL1 activity, respectively). These results suggested that this IRF-E alone cannot confer IFN inducibility. In contrast, mutation of the ISRE site that is present in the first intron (RL3 plasmid) essentially abolished the response to IFN-α while it had little effect on the constitutive expression of this promoter. These results suggested that ISRE is the functional element that confers the response to IFN-α. The RL4 plasmid in which both IRF-E and ISRE were mutated had the same activity as RL3, supporting the observation that ISRE is the functional element that confers the IFN-α-mediated stimulation.Table IIComparison of IFN-responsive DNA sequences within the promoter of human IRF-7 gene with ISRE and IRF-E consensus sequencesGeneSequenceRef.IRF-7 (IRF-E)CA AAA GCGAAACTIRF-7 (ISRE)GG AAA GCGAAACCISRE consensus(A/G)NG AAA NNGAAACT29Darnell Jr., J.E.

In the RL-5 plasmid we have deleted the 5′-upstream region of RL1 including the IRF-E and inserted the remaining 600-bp fragment that contains the ISRE site into pGL3 plasmid. When transfected into HeLa cells the overall transcription activity of this plasmid was lower than that of RL1 but the ability to respond to IFN treatment was preserved and the luciferase activity was increased by about 3 fold upon IFN-α stimulation. The RL6 plasmid contains only the 5′-flanking region ofIRF-7 promoter and has the first intron including the ISRE site deleted. This construct had only low constitutive activity and did not respond to IFN-α. Thus, the deletion analysis supports the finding that only the ISRE site is able to mediate the response to IFN. Finally, we wanted to further confirm our findings and to examine whether either IRF-E or ISRE can, alone, confer the stimulation by IFN-α. We therefore inserted IRF-E or ISRE element together with the respective flanking sequences (about 35 bp in length) into pGL3-promoter vector, 5′ of a basic SV40 promoter and luciferase gene. As a control, we inserted into this vector the same fragments, which contained mutations in the respective IRF-E/ISRE sites. These plasmids were transfected into HeLa cells and their expression was analyzed before and after IFN stimulation. The results showed that RL7 plasmid as well as its mutated analogue did not respond to IFN stimulation. In contrast, expression of RL8 plasmid was significantly increased (8-fold) in IFN-treated cells. Mutation in the ISRE site (RL8M) completely abolished the IFN-mediated stimulation. Thus, altogether, these data indicate that ISRE is the functional element that mediates the response of IRF-7 gene to IFN-α. These data also indicate that this element alone is able to confer IFN inducibility indicating that it functions as an enhancer in IFN-treated cells. We have demonstrated the importance of the ISRE domain in response ofIRF-7 promoter to IFN-α stimulation. It was shown that the stimulation of interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) promoters by IFN-α and -β is generally mediated by ISGF3 complex, although IRF-1 w"
https://openalex.org/W1989697191,"Deposition of laminin 5 over exposed dermal collagen in epidermal wounds is an early event in repair of the basement membrane. We report that deposition of laminin 5 onto collagen switches adhesion and signaling from collagen-dependent to laminin 5-dependent. Ligation of laminin 5 by integrin α6β4 activates phosphoinositide 3-OH-kinase (PI3K) signaling. This activation allows for adhesion and spreading via integrin α3β1 on laminin 5 independent of RhoGTPase, a regulator of actin stress fibers. In contrast, adhesion and spreading on collagen via α2β1 is Rho-dependent and is inhibited by toxin B, a Rho inhibitor. Deposition of laminin 5 and ligation of α6β4 increases PI3K-dependent production of phosphoinositide di- and triphosphates, PI3K activity, and phosphorylation of downstream target protein c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. Conversely, blocking laminin 5-deposition with brefeldin A, an inhibitor of vesicle transport, or with anti-laminin 5 monoclonal antibodies abolishes the PI3K-dependent spreading mediated by α3β1 and phosphorylation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. Studies with keratinocytes lacking α6β4 or laminin 5 confirm that deposition of laminin 5 and ligation by α6β4 are required for PI3K-dependent spreading via α3β1. We suggest that deposition of laminin 5 onto the collagen substratum, as in wound repair, enables human foreskin keratinocytes to interact via α6β4and to switch from a RhoGTPase-dependent adhesion on collagen to a PI3K-dependent adhesion and spreading mediated by integrin α3β1 on laminin 5."

We describe here the biochemical basis for a cross-talk between intracellular Ca2+ and the D2 receptor. By activation of calmodulin (CaM), Ca2+ directly inhibits the D2 receptor; this conclusion is based on the following observations: (i) The receptor contains a CaM-binding motif in the NH2-terminal end of the third loop, a domain involved in activating Gi/o. A peptide fragment encompassing this domain (D2N) bound dansylated CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner (KD ∼ 0.1 μm). (ii) Activation of purified Gαi1 by D2N, and D2receptor-promoted GTPγS (guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphate) binding in membranes was suppressed by Ca2+/CaM (IC50 ∼ 0.1 μm). (iii) If Ca2+ influx was elicited in D2 receptor-expressing HEK293 cells, agonist-dependent inhibition of cAMP formation decreased. This effect was not seen with other Gi-coupled receptors (A1-adenosine and Mel1A-melatonin receptor). (iv) The D2 receptor was retained by immobilized CaM and radiolabeled CaM was co-immunoprecipitated with the receptor. Specifically, inhibition by CaM does not result from uncoupling the D2 receptor from its cognate G protein(s); rather, CaM directly targets the D2 receptor to block the receptor-operated G protein activation switch.

The receptors for dopamine belong to the class of G protein-coupled receptors. Five receptor subtypes representing two subfamilies have been identified by molecular cloning; D1/D5 receptors stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity, whereas D2, D3, and D4 receptors couple to G proteins of the Gi/oclass to inhibit adenylyl cyclase. Gi/o-mediated signal transduction in excitable cells is also known to inhibit voltage-activated N-type Ca2+-channels and to gate inwardly rectifying K+-channels via the release of βγ-subunit; the former effect was also demonstrated for D2-dopamine receptors (for a review, see Ref. 1Huff R.M. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). D1 and D2 receptors, the “classical” dopamine receptor subtypes, are abundantly expressed in the basal ganglia and are important targets in pharmacotherapy, yet the basis for their neuromodulatory effects is not well understood at the cellular level. The D2-dopamine receptor is found (as an autoreceptor) on presynaptic nerve terminals of nigrostriatal projections and, postsynaptically, on the medium spiny neuron, the predominant nerve cell of the neostriatum (2Surmeier D.J. Reiner A. Levine M.S. Ariano M.J. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 299-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The excitatory drive for the medium spiny neuron is provided by glutamatergic afferents which through NMDA receptors trigger Ca2+ influx (3Mori A. Takahashi T. Miyashita Y. Kasai H. Brain Res. 1994; 654: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Hence, neuronal signal transduction by dopamine receptors proceeds in the presence of oscillating intracellular Ca2+ concentrations and there is reason to assume that the signaling mechanism is interrelated with the intracellular Ca2+ level. Calmodulin (CaM),1 a small acidic protein, can be considered the primary decoder of Ca2+ information in the cell. CaM has a Ca2+affinity of 10−6m and thus acts as a switch when the concentration rises from a resting value of ∼10−7m to 10−5m. Calmodulin can be activated by persistent elevation of intracellular Ca2+ and by Ca2+ oscillations, as they occur on repeated depolarizations of nerve cells (4De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). It has long been known that major effectors regulated by the D2-dopamine receptor can be regulated by Ca2+ and that these effector molecules are enriched in striatal neurons. In these instances, increases in Ca2+ levels elicit effects similar to D2receptor activation. For example, Ca2+ reduces the intracellular cAMP levels by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase type V (and type VI) and by activating CaM-sensitive phosphodiesterases, which break down cAMP; both type V adenylyl cyclase (5Mons N. Cooper D.M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 22: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 6Cooper D.M. Mons N. Karpen J.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) and a 63-kDa isoform of phosphodiesterase (PDE1B1) are expressed in striatal neurons (7Yan C. Bentley J.K. Sonnenburg W.K. Beavo J.A. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 973-984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Polli J.W. Kincaid R.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another example for the cross-talk between D2receptor signaling and Ca2+/CaM is the target protein DARPP-32, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1. DARPP-32 is dephosphorylated on D2-dopamine receptor activation and thus becomes active; this effect is strongly enhanced by Ca2+/CaM through activation of calcineurin (9Nishi A. Snyder G.L. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8147-8155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These examples suggest that the signal transduced by Ca2+/CaM and signaling initiated by the intracellular D2 receptor overlap and may add to each other. We have found in the primary peptide sequence of the human D2-dopamine receptor a CaM-binding motif, which is located in the NH2 terminus of the third cytoplasmic loop of the receptor. In the present work, we report that CaM can convey a Ca2+ signal directly to the receptor through binding to this receptor domain. When Ca2+/CaM binds to the receptor, it antagonizes signaling by the receptor at the level of receptor-mediated G protein turnover. Based on these observations, we propose to extend the concept of a cross-talk between CaM activation and D2 receptor signaling; by binding to the receptor, CaM exerts feed-back inhibition to down-tone the signaling efficiency of the D2 receptor. In the presence of repetitive Ca2+ oscillations, i.e. when the neuron is actively firing action potentials, CaM is suggested to suppress overt enhancement of dopamine receptor signal transduction in striatal nerve cells.

Complementary DNA encoding for the human D2-dopamine receptor (short isoform) was amplified from the D2 receptor cDNA inserted into the pCMV-5 expression vector as a template. Extension of the coding sequence on the NH2 terminus of the receptor was performed using a 5′-sense primer in which the sequence for one copy of the c-Myc (EQKLISEEDLN) or the hemagglutinin epitope (YPYDVPDYA) was flanked by the sequence for the HindIII restriction site (5′-end) and by the first 24 nucleotides of the receptor coding sequence following the start codon (3′-end). The 3′-antisense primer encoded for a unique BstE restriction site present in the sequence of the D2-dopamine receptor followed by the up-stream 5′-nucleotide sequence. The appropriate fragment was generated and amplified in 37 amplification cycles using Ex-Taq Polymerase at 58 °C annealing temperature in the first two and at 72 °C in the consecutive amplification cycles.

The cells were transfected using the Ca2+ phosphate precipitation method with 7.5 μg of the plasmid encoding the c-Myc-labeled human D2S-dopamine receptor (c-Myc-D2R) and 0.75 μg of the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), which carries the Geneticin resistance cassette. Positive clones were selected in the presence of G418 (0.8 mg/ml). A positive cell clone, which expressed the D2-dopamine receptor to high density (∼2 pmol/mg of membrane protein), was propagated in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml G418. The generation of stable HEK293 cell lines stably expressing receptors has been described (D2-dopamine receptor and the human A1-adenosine receptor in Ref. 11Waldhoer M. Bofill-Cardona E. Milligan G.

The D2-dopamine receptor tagged with the hemagglutinin epitope was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells using the Ca2+phosphate precipitation procedure; after 60 h, the cells were harvested for the preparation of membranes. HEK293 cells were grown to confluence in six-well plates. The adenine nucleotide pool was labeled by incubating the cells for 16 h with [3H]adenine (2 μCi/well). After that the medium was replaced, and the cells were pre-incubated for 1 h with 100 μm of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram. The production of cAMP was stimulated by the addition of 25 μm forskolin; receptor-mediated inhibition of cAMP formation was assessed in the absence and presence of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (calcimycin) at a concentration of 3 μm (Ca2+concentration in the assay medium = 1.8 mm) and of the receptor agonists at the indicated concentrations. Accumulation of cAMP was allowed to proceed for 15 min at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped by adding 2.5% perchloric acid with 100 μmcAMP (1 ml/dish). The supernatant (0.9 ml) was aspirated, neutralized with 100 μl of 0.4 m KOH, and diluted with 1.5 ml 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. [3H]cAMP was isolated by sequential chromatography on Dowex AG 50W-X4 and neutral alumina columns (13Johnson R.A. Salomon Y. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Membranes from HEK293 cells were prepared as described in Ref. 11Waldhoer M. Bofill-Cardona E. Milligan G. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 808-818PubMed Google Scholar. For some experiments the membranes were washed three times with 10 mm EGTA in Hepes, pH 7.5, to chelate free Ca2+and thus deplete membrane-bound CaM. Subsequently, membranes were resuspended in HME buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA) at a protein concentration of 8–10 mg/ml and were stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Recombinant, myristoylated Gαi1 was produced inEscherichia coli and purified from bacterial lysates as described in Ref. 14Mumby S.M. Linder M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar. Receptor-promoted G protein activation was determined by measuring the association rate of [35S]GTPγS in Hek293 membranes expressing the D2-dopamine and the A1-adenosine receptor as described (11Waldhoer M. Bofill-Cardona E. Milligan G. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 808-818PubMed Google Scholar); the A1-adenosine receptor was used as a control instead of the Mel1a receptor. The latter only weakly stimulates GTPγS binding because of its tight association with G proteins (15Roka F. Brydon L. Waldhoer M. Strosberg A.D. Freissmuth M. Jockers R. Nanoff C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1014-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). EGTA-washed cell membranes (∼10 μg) were suspended in an assay volume of 30 μl of buffer containing 25 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.01 mmGDP. When indicated 0.1 mm CaCl2 was added. Following preincubation of the membranes (10 min at 25 °C) with a receptor agonist or receptor antagonist, the reaction was initiated by adding [35S]GTPγS to a final concentration of ∼3 nm (specific activity = 2400 cpm/fmol). Quinpirol (1 μm) and sulpirid (10 μm) were used as agonist and antagonist, respectively, for the D2-dopamine receptor, N 6-cyclopentyladenosine (1 μm) was used as an agonist and 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) (1 μm) as an antagonist for the A1-adenosine receptor. When indicated, calmodulin (CaM) (1 μm) was included in the preincubation mixture. After the indicated reaction times, 0.9 ml of ice-cold stop buffer containing (mm): 10 Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 NaCl, 10 MgCl2, and 0.1 GTP were added. Bound and free radioactivity were separated by filtration over glass fiber filters. Binding of [35S]GTPγS to purified Gαi1 was carried out in an assay volume of 40 μl comprising buffer (50 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 0.01% Lubrol, 10 mmMgSO4, and 2 mm CaCl2), 1.3 pmol of protein, and 1 μm [35S]GTPγS (specific activity, 30 cpm/fmol) in the absence or presence of 1 μmCaM. The reaction proceeded at 30 °C and was terminated by the addition of ice-cold stop buffer at the indicated time points. Bound and free radioactivity were separated by filtration over BA-85 nitrocellulose filters. Acceleration of [35S]GTPγS binding to Gαi1 by a peptide derived from the third intracellular loop of the D2-dopamine receptor (D2N) and its inhibition by calmodulin was performed on 0.8 pmol of Gαi1 in the absence or presence of 0.3 or 1 μm CaM. The binding reaction was carried out over a period of 15 min in the assay buffer described above. Binding of the D2-dopamine receptor agonist radioligand [125I]OH-PIPAT and of the A1-adenosine receptor agonist radioligand [125I]HPIA to membranes from stable HEK293 cell lines was carried out as described (11Waldhoer M. Bofill-Cardona E. Milligan G. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 808-818PubMed Google Scholar). Before the binding assay, cell membranes were washed with 10 mm EGTA as described above. The binding reaction was carried out for 90 min at 25 °C in the absence or presence of 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 μm CaM as indicated. The reaction was terminated by filtration over glass fiber filters using a cell harvester (Skatron, Lier, Norway). Nonspecific binding of [125I]OH-PIPAT and of [125I]HPIA was determined in the presence of 10 μm sulpirid and of 1 μm DPCPX, respectively, and amounted to less than 10% of the total binding of either radioligand in the KD concentration range. D2N (10 μm) was incubated with 40 μl of a 50% slurry of calmodulin-Sepharose in buffer consisting of 20 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, 100 μm CaCl2, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm GTP, and 0.01% Lubrol for 30 min at 22 °C. Subsequently, the Sepharose beads were sedimented by centrifugation and washed once to remove excess D2N. The D2N-loaded CaM-Sepharose was resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer including 1.5 μg of purified Gαi1. After 45 min at 22 °C, the CaM-Sepharose was washed three times with 100 μl of buffer each time and finally resuspended in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer; 30-μl aliquots were boiled and separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the blot was probed with a Gαi1-specific antiserum (I1C, directed against the residues 160–169 of Gαi1; Ref. 16Selzer E. Wilfing A. Schiferer A. Hermann M. Grubeck-Loebenstein B. Freissmuth M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1609-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin. The interaction between D2N and dansyl-CaM were examined by measuring peptide-induced changes in the fluorescence intensity of dansyl-CaM on excitation with UV light at a wavelength of 340 nm. The fluorescence emission spectrum of dansyl-CaM was recorded using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer in a cuvette at a volume of 0.24 ml. The fluorescence maximum was detected at a wavelength of 510 nm in the absence and at 495 nm in the presence of dansyl-CaM ligands (i.e. Ca2+ or receptor peptides). Dansyl-CaM and the D2-dopamine receptor-derived peptides (D2N or D2C) were diluted in assay buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and (as indicated) 2 mm CaCl2). The concentrations of dansyl-CaM were varied from 0.1 to 0.5 μm, and concentration-response curves for fluorescence enhancement by D2N were generated at each dansyl-CaM concentration. EC50 estimates were derived by fitting the concentration-response curves to the Hill equation and replotted versus the concentration of dansyl-CaM in the cuvette. Binding of D2N to CaM was examined by cross-linking. CaM (6.6 μm) and D2N (3 μm) were incubated in 50 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 in a volume of 30 μl. The bifunctional amine-reactive cross-linking reagent DSS was added at a concentration of 1 mm if indicated. After 30 min at room temperature, SDS-sample buffer was added to the reaction mixture followed by heating to 90 °C for 5 min. The samples were resolved on a 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue. To verify the presence of calmodulin in cross-linked complexes, the proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes, cross-linked with glutaraldehyde, and visualized with a monoclonal antibody raised against calmodulin. Alternatively, the formation of receptor peptide-CaM complexes was evaluated by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. D2N (aa 208–226) and the related D2 receptor peptides with overlapping sequences, D2N′ (aa 214–232) and D2N""(aa 217–235) were incubated with CaM in the presence of 0.1 mmCa2+ for 30 min at room temperature. The incubation mixture was taken up in SDS-less sample buffer and applied to an 8% acrylamide gel, which contained 0.1 mm Ca2+. Electrophoresis was performed at a current of 10–15 mA with the addition of 0.1 mm Ca2+ in the electrophoresis buffer. CaM and CaM-peptide complexes were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Membranes prepared from the cells stably expressing c-Myc-D2R were washed with EGTA as described above; subsequently, the membranes (2 mg) were solubilized with 0.6% cholate (the ratio of detergent to membrane protein was 3:1) in HME buffer containing 750 mm NaCl and protease inhibitors (Pefabloc, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The insoluble material was collected by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was concentrated over a porous polycarbonate membrane (Amicon, cut-off size = 30 kDa); subsequently, 0.1% digitonin was added, the concentration of cholate adjusted to 0.12%, and the concentration of NaCl adjusted to 150 mm. In a volume of 0.25 ml, the soluble extract was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 10 μg of a monoclonal c-Myc antibody (clone 9E10) and 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The Sepharose was collected by centrifugation at 500 rpm and washed three times with 200 μl of ice-cold detergent-containing buffer. To determine the efficiency of the immunoprecipitation, 30-μl aliquots were diluted in SDS sample buffer, which contained 6 m urea and 40 mm DTT. The samples were brought to 30 °C for 30 min and were applied to a SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 6m urea. The supernatant, the last of three washes, and the immunoprecipitate were analyzed. The c-Myc-tagged D2R was detected by immunoblotting using a polyclonal antiserum directed against c-Myc; in addition, the blot was probed with a G protein β-subunit-specific rabbit antiserum (17Hohenegger M. Mitterauer T. Voss T. Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 73-80PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the immunoprecipitate that had been prepared as described above was resuspended and gently mixed with 5 nm125I-CaM (corresponding to 0.3 μCi) in the detergent-containing buffer to which 2 mm CaCl2was added for 2 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose was then washed three times with the buffer containing CaCl2 and detergents and was taken up in 40 μl of sample buffer, which included 6m urea and 40 mm DTT. After separating the samples on a 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, 125I-CaM was visualized by autoradiography. Membranes from HEK293 cells expressing the D2-dopamine receptor (B max ∼ 2 pmol/mg) or the A1-adenosine receptor (B max ∼ 2 pmol/mg) were washed free of Ca2+ and were incubated with saturating concentrations of the high affinity antagonist radioligands [125I]epidepride (for the D2 receptor) and [3H]DPCPX (for the A1-adenosine receptor) for 90 min at 25 °C. Matched amounts of receptor (∼ 0.3 pmol) were solubilized with 0.6% cholate in HME buffer containing 750 mm NaCl and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C for 60 min (detergent:protein = 3: 1). This mixture was then centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 20 min; 0.1% digitonin and 2 mm CaCl2 were added to the supernatant, and the concentrations of cholate and of NaCl were adjusted to 0.06% and 150 mm, respectively. Of this an aliquot was removed and kept at 4 °C. The solubilized receptors were then incubated with CaM immobilized on a Sepharose matrix (packed matrix = 1/10 of the volume of the soluble extract), which had been equilibrated in matrix buffer (HME, 0.06% cholate, 0.1% digitonin, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2) for 2 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the CaM-Sepharose was washed three times in 200 μl of matrix buffer and bound receptors were eluted with 200 μl of matrix buffer, which contained 10 mm EGTA instead of CaCl2. The aliquots of the soluble extract, of the supernatant, the wash fractions, and the eluate were then filtrated through glass fiber filters pretreated with 1% polyethyleneimine. Radioactivity that failed to elute from the CaM-Sepharose was recovered by boiling in 2% SDS. The filter-bound radioactivity and the radioactivity recovered by boiling the matrix were measured. Alternatively, CaM immobilized on an agarose resin was utilized to assay the retention of solubilized D2-dopamine receptors following the same procedure. Nonspecific radioligand binding to the CaM matrix was determined with matched amounts of [125I]epidepride and [3H]DPCPX incubated with membrane protein from nontransfected cells; the obtained values amounted to 5–15% of the values for receptor-bound radioactivity from which they were subtracted. In order to control for ligand dissociation from the solubilized receptors, the decrease in binding was quantified for each of the time points at which a wash or elution step was performed. At 4 °C the recovery of labeled D2 receptors was 98% and 85% after 15 and 20 min, respectively. In the case of the A1-adenosine receptor, the recovery amounted to 70% and 56% at the respective intervals. The values obtained were used to correct for the proportion of radioligand that dissociated during the wash and elution procedure. A soluble extract was also prepared from COS-7 cell membranes expressing the HA-tagged D2-dopamine receptor (0.14 mg containing about 0.12 pmol of receptors) and was incubated with equilibrated CaM-Sepharose (150 μl of packed matrix) under the conditions described above for 2 h. Thereafter, the CaM-Sepharose was washed with 750 μl of matrix buffer and finally taken up in 150 μl of SDS-sample buffer. An aliquot was electrophoretically resolved and immunoblotted using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (clone 16B12). The D2-dopamine receptor couples to G proteins of the Gi/o subfamily and mediates inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. In HEK293 cells stably transfected with the human D2 receptor, quinpirol completely inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation (Fig.1 A). If the cells were incubated with the Ca2+ ionophore calcimycin (3 μm), the inhibition elicited by quinpirol was attenuated; quinpirol failed to completely reverse the forskolin-induced cAMP production and the concentration-response curve shifted to higher agonist concentrations. The calcimycin effect on adenylyl cyclase inhibition was not seen in HEK293 cells expressing a different Gi/o-coupled receptor, the melatonin Mel1areceptor (Fig. 1 B). In all cell lines, stimulation by forskolin was moderately decreased (to ∼75%) by calcimycin. The data shown in Fig. 1 suggest that the ionophore-induced Ca2+ influx interfered with the signaling pathway activated by the D2-dopamine receptor but not by other Gi-coupled receptors. The Ca2+-sensing protein calmodulin is a mediator of Ca2+ signals, which it conveys to the target either by direct protein-protein interaction or indirectly by activating protein kinases that phosphorylate the target protein. In isolated membranes that had been washed with EGTA to chelate free Ca2+ and to deplete membrane-bound CaM, we examined whether CaM directly inhibited the receptor-mediated G protein activation. The addition of 1 μm Ca2+/CaM (▴) but not of 100 μm Ca2+ alone (▪) slowed the receptor-enhanced association of [35S]GTPγS as compared with the time course observed in the absence of Ca2+/CaM (Fig. 2 A). No effect of Ca2+/CaM was found on agonist-promoted GTPγS binding if elicited by the A1-adenosine receptor expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2 B). The inhibitory effect of Ca2+/CaM was increased by increasing the concentration of CaM. Fig. 2 C shows that Ca2+/CaM suppressed quinpirol-stimulated GTPγS binding with an IC50 of ∼ 0.1 μm. Binding of GTPγS in the presence of the receptor antagonist was only slightly affected. This selective inhibition of the D2 receptor-mediated G protein activation is indicative of a direct interaction of CaM with the membrane-bound receptor. An antagonism by CaM was also observed when inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was measured in membranes; Ca2+/CaM reversed the inhibition by quinpirol and reduced forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity to a similar extent as did calcimycin in intact cells (data not shown). We therefore tested if CaM added exogenously to isolated membranes blocked the ligand binding pocket of the D2-dopamine receptor. This was not the case, as saturation isotherms wi"

To produce novel DNA binding domains, three-finger proteins binding specific 9-base pair sequences were constructed from modular building blocks. Fusion of these zinc finger proteins to a transcriptional activation domain and to modified ligand binding domains derived from either the estrogen or progesterone receptors yielded potent ligand-dependent transcriptional regulators. Together with optimized minimal promoters, these regulators provide 4-hydroxytamoxifen- or RU486-inducible expression systems with induction ratios of up to 3 orders of magnitude. These inducible expression systems are functionally independent, and each can be selectively switched on within the same cell. The potential use of zinc finger-steroid receptor fusion proteins for the regulation of natural promoters was also explored. A gene-specific six-finger protein binding an 18-base pair target sequence was converted into a ligand-dependent regulator by fusion with either two estrogen receptor ligand binding domains or one ecdysone receptor and one retinoid X receptor ligand binding domain. These single-chain receptor proteins undergo an intramolecular rearrangement, rather than intermolecular dimerization and are functional as monomers. Thus, the ability to engineer DNA binding specificities of zinc finger proteins enables the construction of ligand-dependent transcriptional regulators with potential for the regulation of virtually any desired artificial or natural promoter. It is anticipated that the novel chemically regulated gene switches described herein will find many applications in applied and basic research, where the specific modulation of gene expression can be exploited.

Accordingly, the design of sequence-specific DNA binding domains has been the subject of intense interest for the last 2 decades. Of the many classes of DNA-binding proteins studied, the modular Cys2-His2 zinc finger DNA binding motif has shown the most promise for the production of proteins with tailored DNA binding specificity (1Desjarlais J.R. Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7345-7349Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 2Choo Y. Klug A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The novel architecture of this class of proteins provides for the rapid construction of gene-specific targeting devices. Polydactyl zinc finger proteins are most readily prepared by assembly of modular zinc finger domains recognizing predefined three-nucleotide sequences (6Segal D.J. Dreier B. Beerli R.R.

Polydactyl proteins may be assembled using variable numbers of zinc finger domains of varied specificity providing DNA-binding proteins that not only recognize novel sequences but also sequences of varied length. By combining six zinc finger domains, proteins have been produced that recognize 18 contiguous base pairs of DNA sequence, a DNA address sufficiently complex to specify any locus in the 4 billion-base pair human genome (or any other genome). Fusion of polydactyl zinc finger proteins of this type to activation or repression domains provides transcription factors that efficiently and specifically modulate the expression of both transgenes and endogenous genes (8Beerli R.R.

While the availability of designed transcription factors with tailored DNA binding specificities provides novel opportunities in transcriptional regulation, additional applications would be available to ligand-dependent transcription factors. Designer zinc finger proteins dependent on small molecule inducers would have a number of applications, both for the regulation of endogenous genes and for the development of inducible expression systems for the regulation of transgenes. Natural transcription factors are regulated by a number of different mechanisms, including posttranslational modification such as phosphorylation (10Janknecht R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1620-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 11Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar), or by ligand binding. The prototype ligand-activated transcription factors are members of the nuclear hormone receptor family, including the receptors for sex steroids or adrenocorticoids (12Carson-Jurica M.A. Schrader W.T. O'Malley W. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 13Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6276) Google Scholar). These receptors are held inactive in the absence of hormone, by association with a number of inactivating factors including hsp90 (14Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, nuclear hormone receptors dissociate from the inactivating complex, dimerize, and become able to bind DNA and activate transcription (12Carson-Jurica M.A. Schrader W.T. O'Malley W. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 13Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6276) Google Scholar, 14Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). Significantly, not only hormone binding but also inactivation and dimerization functions reside within the ligand binding domain (LBD)1 of these proteins (15Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2838) Google Scholar). This fact has been exploited experimentally and steroid hormone receptor LBDs have found wide use as tools to render heterologous proteins hormone-dependent. In particular, the estrogen receptor (ER) LBD has been used to render the functions of c-Myc (16Eilers M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Bishop J.M.

To develop an inducible expression system for use in basic research and gene therapy, the availability of ligand-dependent transcriptional regulators is a prerequisite. Preferentially, these regulators would be activated by a small molecule inducer with no other biological activity, bind specific sequences present only in the target promoter, and have low immunogenicity. A number of ligand-regulated artificial transcription factors have been generated by various means, using functional domains derived from either prokaryotes (19Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In particular, regulators based on the Gal4 DNA binding domain (DBD) fused to a human ER (27Braselmann S. Graninger P. Busslinger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Compared with the heterodimeric EcR/RXR system, regulators based on the ER and PR LBDs have the important advantage that they function as homodimers and require the delivery of only one cDNA. However, while ecdysone has no known biological effect on mammalian cells, estrogen and progesterone elicit a biological response in cells or tissues that express the endogenous steroid receptors. With the availability of a modified ER and PR LBDs that have lost responsiveness to their natural ligands but not to synthetic antagonists such as 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) (30Littlewood T.D.

McDonnell D.P. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 1992; 69: 703-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), respectively, this is no longer of great concern. Thus, steroid hormone receptor LBD-based inducible expression systems can be developed that function independently of the endogenous steroid receptors. To date, this has been shown for the PR LBD through the development of an RU486-inducible expression system based on the Gal4 DBD (25Wang Y. O'Malley Jr., B.W. Tsai S. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) that has lost the responsiveness to estrogen but not the antagonist 4-OHT has not been described to date. Designed zinc finger proteins have a number of advantages as compared with other DBDs, including the one derived from Gal4, since the ability to engineer DNA binding specificities allows ligand-dependent regulators to be directed to any desired artificial or natural promoter. Here we explore the utility of fusion proteins between designed zinc finger proteins and nuclear hormone receptor LBDs for the inducible control of gene expression. For the construction of the B3 and N1 zinc finger proteins, DNA recognition helices from the Zif268 finger 2 variants pmGAA, pmGAC, pmGGA, pmGGG, and pGTA were utilized (6Segal D.J. Dreier B. Beerli R.R. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2758-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). 2Dreier, B., Segal, D, J., and Barbas, C. F., III (2000) J. Mol. Biol., in press. Three-finger proteins binding the respective 9-bp target sites were constructed by grafting the appropriate DNA recognition helices into the framework of the three-finger protein Sp1C (33Desjarlais J.R. Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2256-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar); DNA fragments encoding the two three-finger proteins were assembled from six overlapping oligonucleotides as described (8Beerli R.R. Segal D.J. Dreier B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14628-14633Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The three-finger protein coding regions were then cloned into the bacterial expression vector pMal-CSS, a derivative of the bacterial expression plasmid pMal-C2 (New England Biolabs) using SfiI restriction sites. Maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins were purified to >90% homogeneity using the Protein Fusion and Purification System (New England Biolabs), except that zinc buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 90 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 90 μmZnCl2), 1% BSA, 5 mm dithiothreitol was used as the column buffer. Protein purity and concentration were determined from Coomassie Blue-stained 15% SDS-PAGE gels by comparison with BSA standards. In 96-well ELISA plates, 0.2 μg of streptavidin (Pierce) was applied to each well for 1 h at 37 °C and then washed twice with water. Biotinylated target oligonucleotide (0.025 μg) was applied in the same manner. Zinc buffer A plus 3% BSA was applied for blocking, but the wells were not washed after incubation. All subsequent incubations were performed at room temperature. Starting with 2 μg of purified MBP fusion protein in the top wells, 2-fold serial dilutions were applied in 1× binding buffer (zinc buffer A, 1% BSA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.12 μg/μl sheared herring sperm DNA). The samples were incubated 1 h, followed by 10 washes with water. Mouse anti-maltose binding protein monoclonal antibody (Sigma) in zinc buffer A plus 1% BSA was applied to the wells for 30 min, followed by 10 washes with water. Goat anti-mouse IgG monoclonal antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) was applied to the wells for 30 min, followed by 10 washes with water. Alkaline phosphatase substrate (Sigma) was applied, and theA 405 was quantitated with SOFTmax 2.35 (Molecular Devices). Target oligonucleotides were labeled at their 3′-ends with 32P and gel-purified. Eleven 3-fold serial dilutions of protein were incubated in 20 μl of binding reactions (1× binding buffer, 10% glycerol, 1 pM target oligonucleotide) for 3 h at room temperature and then resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer. Quantitation of dried gels was performed using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) The K D was determined by Scatchard analysis. The VP16 coding region was PCR-amplified from pcDNA3/C7-VP16 using the primers VPNhe-F (5′-GAG GAG GAG GAG GCT AGC GCC ACC ATG GGG CGC GCC GGC GCT CCC CCG ACC GAT GTC AGC CTG-3′) and VPHind-B (5′-GAG GAG GAG GAG AAG CTT GTT AAT TAA ACC GTA CTC GTC AAT TCC AAG GGC ATC G-3′). The C7 coding region was amplified from the same plasmid, using the primers C7Hind-F (5′-GAG GAG GAG GAG AAG CTT GGG GCC ACG GCG GCC CTC GAG CCC TAT GC-3′) and C7Bam-B (5′-GAG GAG GGA TCC CCC TGG CCG GCC TGG CCA CTA GTT CTA GAG TC-3′). The truncated human PR LBD (aa 645–914) was amplified from PAPCMVGL914VPc′-SV (26Wang Y. Xu J. Pierson T. O'Malley B.W. Tsai S.Y. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using the primers PRBam-F (5′-GAG GAG GAG GAG GGA TCC AGT CAG AGT TGT GAG AGC ACT GGA TGC TG-3′) and PREco-B (5′-GAG GAG GAA TTC TCA AGC AAT AAC TTC AGA CAT CAT TTC TGG AAA TTC-3′). The VP16-C7-PR coding region was then assembled in pcDNA3.1(+)Zeo (Invitrogen) using the NheI,HindIII, BamHI, and EcoRI restriction sites incorporated in the PCR primers. In the resulting constructs, the C7 coding region was flanked by two SfiI sites, and the VP16 coding region was flanked by AscI and PacI sites. These restriction sites were introduced to facilitate the exchange of DBDs and effector domains, respectively. To generate VP16-C7-ER, the point-mutated murine ER LBD coding region (aa 282–599, G525R) was excised from pBSKS+ER (30Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) and used to replace the PR LBD coding region via BamHI–EcoRI restriction digestion. Fusion constructs containing a VP64 effector domain were produced by replacing VP16 with the VP64 coding region viaAscI–PacI digestion. To generate fusion constructs with B3 or N1 DBDs, C7 was replaced by the B3 or N1 coding regions via SfiI digestion. The truncated human PR LBD was amplified from PAPCMVGL914VPc′-SV (26Wang Y. Xu J.

The point-mutated mouse ER LBD was amplified from pBSKS+ER (30Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I.

The resulting PCR products were then inserted into pcDNA3/E2C-VP16 (8Beerli R.R. Segal D.J. Dreier B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To generate fusion constructs with B3 or N1 DBDs, E2C was replaced by the B3 or N1 coding regions via SfiI digestion. Fusion constructs containing a VP64 effector domain were produced by replacing VP16 by the VP64 coding region via AscI–PacI digestion. For construction of the E2C-ER fusion, the point-mutated mouse ER LBD was amplified from pBSKS+ER (30Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I.

The PCR product was then inserted into the construct pcDNA3/E2C-VP64, replacing the VP64 coding region, via FseI–PacI digestion. To generate the ER-VP64 fusion, the ER LBD was amplified using the primers ERATGBam-F (5′-GAG GAG GAG GAG GGA TCC GCC ACC ATG CGA AAT GAA ATG GGT GCT TCA GGA GAC-3′) and ERAsc-B.

For construction of single-chain fusions with two ER LBDs, the point-mutated mouse ER LBD was amplified from pBSKS+ER (30Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I.

The PCR products were then digested with, respectively,FseI and SpeI, or NheI andAscI, and inserted intoFseI–AscI-linearized pcDNA3/E2C-VP64 (8Beerli R.R. Segal D.J. Dreier B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14628-14633Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). For construction of RXR-EcR single-chain fusions, the ligand binding domain of the human retinoid X receptor (hRXRα; aa 373–654) was PCR-amplified from pVgRXR (Invitrogen) using the primers RXRFse-F (5′-GAG GAG GAG GGC CGG CCG GGA AGC CGT GCA GGA GGA GCG GC-3′) and RXRSpe-B (5′-GAG GAG GAG GAG GAG ACT AGT GGA ACC ACC CCC ACC ACC GCC CGA GCC ACC GCC ACC AGA GGA AGT CAT TTG GTG CGG CGC CTC CAG C-3′). The ligand binding domain of the ecdysone receptor (EcR, aa 202–462;Drosophila melanogaster) was PCR-amplified from pVgRXR using the primers EcRNhe-F1 (for the 18-aa linker construct; 5′-GAG GAG GAG GAG GCT AGC TCT TCC GGT GGC GGC CAA GAC TTT GTT AAG AAG G-3′) or EcRNhe-F2 (for the 30-aa linker construct; 5′-GAG GAG GAG GAG GCT AGC GGC GGT GGC GGT GGC TCC TCT GGT GGC GGT GGC GGT TCT TCC GGT GGC GGC CAA GAC TTT GTT AAG AAG G-3′) and EcRAsc-B (5′-GAG GAG GAG GGC GCG CCC GGC ATG AAC GTC CCA GAT CTC CTC GAG-3′). The PCR products were then digested with, respectively, FseI and SpeI, orNheI and AscI, and inserted intoFseI–AscI-linearized pcDNA3/E2C-VP64 (8Beerli R.R. Segal D.J. Dreier B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14628-14633Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). DNA binding domains were exchanged via SfiI digestion, and effector domains were exchanged viaAscI–PacI digestion. To generate the 36-aa linker E2C-RLLE-VP64 fusion construct, the RXR LBD was PCR-amplified from pcDNA3/E2C-RE-VP64 using the primers RXRFse-F and RXRSpeLL-B (5′-GAG GAG GAG GAG GAG ACT AGT AGA GCC ACC GCC CCC TTC AGA ACC GCC CGA GCC ACC GCC ACC AGA GG-3′). The EcR LBD was amplified from the same plasmid, using the primers EcRNheLL-F (5′-GAG GAG GAG GAG GCT AGC GGG GGT TCG GAG GGT GGC GGG TCT GAG GGT GGG GGT GGT TCC ACT AGC TCT TCC-3′) and EcRAsc-B. The PCR products were inserted into pcDNA3/E2C-VP64 as described above. C7 dimer-TATA fragments were generated by PCR amplification with C7 dimer-TATA primers (5′-GAG GGT ACC GCG TGG GCG A0–5GCG TGG GCGAGT CGA CTC TAG AGG GTA TAT AAT GG-3′ for direct repeats; 5′-GAG GGT ACC GCG TGG GCG A0–5CGC CCA CGCAGT CGA CTC TAG AGG GTA TAT AAT GG-3′ for inverted repeats; 5′-GAG GGT ACC CGC CCA CGC A0–5GCG TGG GCGAGT CGA CTC TAG AGG GTA TAT AAT GG-3′ for everted repeats) and GLprimer2 (5′-CTT TAT GTT TTT GGC GTC TTC C-3′; Promega), using p17x4TATA-luc (gift from S. Y. Tsai) as a template. PCR products were cloned into pGL3-Basic (Promega) via digestion with the restriction endonucleases KpnI and NcoI. 10xB3-TATA and 10xN1-TATA fragments were assembled from two pairs of complementary oligonucleotides each and cloned intoSacI–XbaI-linearized pGL3-Basic (Promega), upstream of the firefly luciferase coding region, creating the plasmids 10xB3-TATA-luc and 10xN1-TATA-luc. To generate the 10xN1-TATA-lacZ reporter construct, the lacZ coding region was excised from pβgal-Basic (CLONTECH) and used to replace the luciferase coding region of 10xN1-TATA-luc viaHindIII–BamHI digestion. For all transfections, HeLa cells were plated in 24-well dishes and used at a confluency of 40–60%. For luciferase reporter assays, 175 ng of reporter plasmid (promotor constructs in pGL3 or, as negative control, pGL3-Basic) and 25 ng of effector plasmid (zinc finger-steroid receptor fusions in pcDNA3 or, as negative control, empty pcDNA3) were transfected using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After approximately 24 h, expression was induced by the addition of 10 nm RU486 (Biomol), 100 nm 4-OHT (Sigma), or 5 μm ponasterone A (Invitrogen). Cell extracts were prepared approximately 48 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity using the Promega luciferase assay reagent in a MicroLumat LB96P luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Gaithersburg, MD). For dual reporter assays, 85 ng of luciferase reporter plasmid, 85 ng of β-galactosidase reporter plasmid, and 15 ng of each of the two effector plasmids were transfected. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using the luminescent β-galactosidase detection kit II (CLONTECH). Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of engineered C2-H2 zinc finger proteins for the regulation of target gene expression (8Beerli R.R. Segal D.J. Dreier B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl.

However, to fully realize the potential of engineered zinc finger proteins, it is desirable that their otherwise constitutive DNA binding activity be rendered ligand-dependent. The LBDs of the human PR and the murine ER have previously been used for the regulation of heterologous proteins, after having been modified to remove their responsiveness to their natural hormone inducers while retaining activity with synthetic antagonists (26Wang Y. Xu J. Pierson T. O'Malley B.W. Tsai S.Y. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I.

The VP64-C7-PR fusion protein contains an N-terminal VP64 activation domain (8Beerli R.R. Segal D.J. Dreier B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W1986699895,"MSH4 is a meiosis-specific MutS homolog. In yeast, it is required for reciprocal recombination and proper segregation of homologous chromosomes at meiosis I. MLH1 (MutL homolog 1) facilitates both mismatch repair and crossing over during meiosis in yeast. Germ-line mutations in the MLH1 human gene are responsible for hereditary nonpolyposis cancer, but the analysis of MLH1-deficient mice has revealed that MLH1 is also required for reciprocal recombination in mammals. Here we show that hMSH4 interacts with hMLH1. The two proteins are coimmunoprecipitated regardless of the presence of DNA or ATP, suggesting that the interaction does not require the binding of MSH4 to DNA. The domain of hMSH4 responsible for the interaction is in the amino-terminal part of the protein whereas the region that contains the ATP binding site and helix-turn-helix motif does not bind to hMLH1. Immunolocalization analysis shows that MSH4 is present at sites along the synaptonemal complex as soon as homologous chromosomes synapse. T..."
https://openalex.org/W2015029448,"dHAND and eHAND are basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors expressed during embryogenesis and are required for the proper development of cardiac and extraembryonic tissues. HAND genes, like the myogenic bHLH genes, are classified as class B bHLH genes, which are expressed in a tissue-restricted pattern and function by forming heterodimers with class A bHLH proteins. Myogenic bHLH genes are shown not to form homodimers efficiently, suggesting that their activity is dependent on their E-protein partners. To identify HIPs (HAND-interactingproteins) that regulate the activity of the HAND genes, we screened an 9.5–10.5-day-old mouse embryonic yeast two-hybrid library with eHAND. Several HIPs held high sequence identity to eHAND, indicating that eHAND could form and function as a homodimer. Based on the high degree of amino acid identity between eHAND and dHAND, it is possible that dHAND could also form homodimers and heterodimers with eHAND. We show using yeast and mammalian two-hybrid assays as well as biochemical pull-down assays that eHAND and dHAND are capable of forming both HAND homo- and heterodimers in vivo. To investigate whether HAND genes form heterodimers with other biologically relevant bHLH proteins, we tested and show HAND heterodimerization with the recently identified Hairy-related transcription factors, HRT1–3. This finding is exciting, because both HRT and HAND genes are coexpressed in the developing heart and limb and both have been implicated in establishing tissue boundaries and pattern formation. Moreover, competition gel shift analysis demonstrates that dHAND and eHAND can negatively regulate the DNA binding of MyoD/E12 heterodimers in a manner similar to MISTI and Id proteins, suggesting a possible transcriptional inhibitory role for HAND genes. Taken together, these results show that dHAND and eHAND can form homo- and heterodimer combinations with multiple bHLH partners and that this broad dimerization profile reflects the mechanisms by which HAND genes regulate transcription. dHAND and eHAND are basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors expressed during embryogenesis and are required for the proper development of cardiac and extraembryonic tissues.

Moreover, competition gel shift analysis demonstrates that dHAND and eHAND can negatively regulate the DNA binding of MyoD/E12 heterodimers in a manner similar to MISTI and Id proteins, suggesting a possible transcriptional inhibitory role for HAND genes. Taken together, these results show that dHAND and eHAND can form homo- and heterodimer combinations with multiple bHLH partners and that this broad dimerization profile reflects the mechanisms by which HAND genes regulate transcription. basic helix-loop-helix polymerase chain reaction embryonic day n glutathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis muscle creatine kinase Members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)1 superfamily of transcription factors are expressed in a wide range of tissues during development and play a major role in cell specification and differentiation (1Lee J.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 2Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). bHLH proteins bind DNA as either homo- or heterodimers, such that the juxtaposition of the basic region of each factor creates a combined DNA binding domain that recognizes 6-base pair sequences termed an E box (3Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the bHLH superfamily have been categorized into two main groups. The Class A bHLH genes, which include the gene products of the E2A gene, E12 and E47, and HEB, are defined by their ubiquitous expression in all tissues and their ability to form homodimers as well as heterodimers with a large range of other bHLH proteins (4Hu J.S. Olson E.N. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 5Neuman T. Keen A. Knapik E. Shain D. Ross M. Nornes H.O. Zuber M.X. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, the class B bHLH genes exhibit tissue-restricted expression and in the example the myogenic bHLH genes, MyoD, myogenin, Myf5, and MRF4, do not form homodimers efficiently (7Chakraborty T. Brennan T.J. Li L. Edmondson D. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3633-3641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus requiring the formation of heterodimers with Class A bHLH genes (1Lee J.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 6Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). This observation established the paradigm that class B bHLH proteins form heterodimers with class A bHLH factors to bind DNA and regulate transcription. This paradigm has prompted numerous laboratories to use Class A bHLH proteins as bait to identify novel Class B genes in yeast two-hybrid screens (8Staudinger J. Perry M. Elledge S.J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4608-4611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HAND genes, dHAND (HAND2, Thing2, and Hed) and eHAND (HAND1, Thing1, and Hxt) are class B bHLH transcription factors that were cloned using Class A proteins as bait (9Cserjesi P. Brown D.

Both HAND genes exhibit tissue-restricted expression patterns that are partially overlapping during development (9Cserjesi P. Brown D. Lyons G.E. Olson E.N. Dev.

Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Science. 1995; 270: 1995-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Although eHAND expression overlaps with that of dHAND in the lateral mesoderm, neural crest, and outflow tract of the heart, eHAND is expressed uniquely in extraembryonic mesoderm (9Cserjesi P. Brown D. Lyons G.E. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 664-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 10Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell.

In the developing ventricles, the HAND genes exhibit a sided expression pattern where dHAND is expressed predominantly within the developing right ventricle and eHAND is expressed predominantly within the left ventricle (9Cserjesi P. Brown D. Lyons G.E. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 664-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 10Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell.

Genet. 1997; 16: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The result of high levels of dHAND expression in the right ventricle, high levels of eHAND expression in the left ventricle, and overlapping expression of d- and eHAND in the outflow tract and at the boundary of both ventricles, is a gradient of HAND transcription factors within the developing heart. In addition, the expression of the HAND genes within the developing heart has been shown to be essential for proper cardiac development because mice harboring null mutations of both dHAND and eHAND show severe developmental defects in both cardiac and extraembryonic mesoderm (13Firulli A.B. McFadden D.G. Lin Q. Srivastava D. Olson E.N. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 14Srivastava D. Thomas T. Lin Q. Kirby M.L. Brown D. Olson E.N. Nat.

Taken together, these results demonstrate that the HAND genes are critical for proper embryonic development, but the mechanism by which these genes function has yet to be determined. In our efforts to determine the functional role the HAND genes play in development, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screen with full-length eHAND as bait using an E9.5–10.5 embryonic library. Several HIPs isolated from this screen were homologous to eHAND, suggesting that eHAND could form homodimers. Given that the amino acid identity between the bHLH regions of d- and eHAND is greater than 90%, we hypothesized that dHAND could form homodimers and that dHAND and eHAND could form heterodimers. To address these questions, we employed yeast and mammalian two-hybrid analysis as well as biochemical pull-down techniques to show that eHAND and dHAND are capable of forming homodimer and heterodimers with each other. To determine whether d- and eHAND were capable of forming heterodimers with other class B bHLH factors, we tested heterodimerization of the HAND genes with the newly described Hairy-related transcription factors, HRT1–3. HRTs are coexpressed with HAND genes within the developing heart, limb buds, and other mesodermally derived tissues and thus are biologically relevant HAND partners (16Nakagawa O. Nakagawa M. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Srivastava D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 17Kokubo H. Lun Y. Johnson R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Steidl C. Leimeister C. Klaunt B. Maier M. Nanda I. Dixon D. Clarke R. Schmid M. M. G. Genomics. 2000; 66: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Our data show that indeed HAND genes can form heterodimers with the HRT genes, which is an intriguing finding because both HRT and HAND genes have implicated roles in establishing tissue boundaries and tissue patterning. Moreover, competitive gel shift assays using an E box probe demonstrate that both dHAND and eHAND can negatively regulate the DNA binding of MyoD/E12 heterodimers and thus can regulate the transcription of other bHLH genes independent of direct DNA binding. When considering the slightly overlapping sided expression of the HAND genes in cardiac development, a complex combinatorial array of interactions between d- and eHAND, E-proteins, HRTs, and any unknown bHLH factors are possible. The dimerization properties of the HAND genes suggests complex regulatory functions that allow extremely fine transcriptional control of downstream target genes. This multitude of dimeric complexes may facilitate gene transcription via DNA binding or repress transcription by preventing the dimerization and DNA binding of other bHLH factors. The plasmids pAS eHAND and VP16 eHAND were generated using a 650-base pair PCR product of eHAND beginning at the initiating methionine and ending at the termination codon 5′ primer 5′-GACGGCGAATTCATGAACCTCGTGGGCAGCTAC-3′ and 3′ primer 5′-GACGGCCCGGGTCACTGCAAATCGAGGTCGCG-3′. PCR conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. This PCR fragment was subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and excised as an EcoRI fragment for cloning into pAS and VP16–3 vectors. pACT PAN1 is a HIP (HAND-interacting protein) that contains the bHLH region of PAN1 and was isolated from a yeast two-hybrid screen of an E9.5–10.5 embryo library using pAS eHAND as bait (19Xin X.Q. Nelson C. Collins L. Dorshkind K. Journal of Immunology. 1993; 151: 5398-5407PubMed Google Scholar). WW3NEDD4 and 5.68VP16 were gifts from Dr. Guy James (UTHSCSA). WW3NEDD4 is the third WW domain of NEDD4 cloned into pGBD (20Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). 5.68VP16 is a nonspecific prey that was cloned from a yeast two-hybrid screen using the WW domains 1 and 2 of MAGI-I (21Dobrosotskaya I. Guy R.K. James G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31589-31597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). pAS dHAND-bHLH was generated by restricting pSG424 dHAND-bHLH (a gift from Dr. Brian Black, UCSF) with EcoRI and subcloning the dHAND-bHLH insert into the EcoRI site of pAS. pACT HEIRI, pCITE E12, and pSVE47VP16 were generous gifts from Dr. Brian Black (UCSF). The plasmids pBIND, pBIND ID, pACT, pACT MyoD, and G5 Luciferase were obtained from the Promega CheckMate mammalian two-hybrid system. pBIND eHAND and pACT eHAND were constructed using the same EcoRI insert from pAS eHAND, but the insert was digested out of VP16 eHAND as a BamHI/NotI fragment. pACT dHAND was constructed by digesting the dHAND cDNA with BssHII, filling in the site with Klenow, ligating on a BamHI linker, and digesting withBamHI and XbaI for subcloning. pGEX eHAND was generated using the EcoRI fragment from VP16 eHAND. pGEX dHAND was generated by taking an NcoI/XbaI dHAND fragment from pCITE dHAND. pGEX 5.68 was a generous gift from Dr. Guy James (UTHSCSA). PCRII Topo HRT 1, HRT2, and HRT3 were generous gifts from Dr. Eric Olson (UTSWMC Dallas). These clones were digested withEcoRV and BamHI, the inserts were cloned into PCITE4B, and the resulting constructs were used to generate in vitro labeled proteins. The yeast strain PJ69-4a (22James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed with the various baits (pAS eHAND, pAS dHAND-bHLH, or WW3NEDD4) and prey plasmids (VP16-3, eHANDVP16-3, 5.68VP16-3, pACT Heir I, or pACT PAN1) as described previously using a lithium acetate procedure (22James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After transformation, the yeast were plated on selective media that lacked tryptophan (−Trp) and leucine (−Leu) and media that lacked tryptophan, leucine, histidine (−His), and adenine (−Ade) and were grown at 30 °C as described (22James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast grown on the −Trp/−Leu plates was then inoculated into liquid cultures in −Trp/−Leu medium and grown at 30 °C, and protein lysates from these yeast were prepared and used in liquid β-galactosidase analysis as described previously (22James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bacteria BL21 (Novagen) were transfected with the constructs pGEX eHAND, pGEX dHAND, or pGEX 5.68 and then were induced to produce GST fusion proteins (23Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). The proteins were isolated from bacteria using standard methods and bound to glutathione-linked agarose beads (23Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeledin vitro transcribed and translated proteins for the bHLH genes, eHAND, dHAND, HRT1, HRT2, HRT3, and E12, were made using TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) and were incubated with the bound beads for18 h at 4 °C in binding buffer (0.3 msucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (24Rhodes K.J. Monaghan M.M. Barrezueta N.X. Nawoschik S. Bekele-Arciri Z. Matos M.F. Nakahira K. Schechter L.E. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4846-4860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were then washed four times in wash buffer (binding buffer with 0.6 m NaCl). The beads were boiled in loading buffer and run through a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Gels were then dried and exposed to PhosphorImager screens or x-ray film. Equal amounts (2 μg) of pG5LUC, pBIND bait plasmid (pBIND, pBIND eHAND, or pBIND Id), and prey plasmid (pACT, pACT eHAND, pACT dHAND, pACT MyoD or pSVE47VP16) were transfected into COS cells seeded onto 3.5-cm dishes usingTransIT PanPak (Mirus Corp.) Lipofectin using the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 48 h post transfection, lysates were prepared, and luciferase assays were performed using the Dual Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) or Bioluminescent reporter gene assay system (Tropix Inc.) following recommended protocols. All samples were read on a Dynex MLX microtitre plate Luminometer. The various bHLH proteins were in vitro transcribed and translated using the Promega TNT system as described in the manufacture's protocol. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the E box from the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) enhancer E box 5′-CCCCCCCAACACCTGCTGCCTGAGC-3′ reported to bind myogenic bHLH/E12 complexes were 5′ end labeled and annealed with their cold complement. 40 fmol of the labeled oligo were incubated with 10 μl of unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate or a total of 10 μl of programmed reticulocyte lysate with the indicated bHLH factor with or without 100 fold cold oligo or mutant oligo 5′-GATTCCATTGGTGCTTGATTCCAGAG-3′ as described (25Molkentin J.D. Firulli A.B. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Hustad C.M. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Lyons G. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3814-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and then run through a 5% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and exposed via PhosphorImager. To identify HIPs that are potentially involved in the regulation of HAND bioactivity, we screened an E9.5–10.5 embryo library using full-length eHAND as bait. Several of these HIPs exhibited high levels of LacZ activation and were sequenced. Surprisingly, one of these HIPs held a 98% sequence identity to mouse eHAND between amino acids 44 and 217 that includes the entire bHLH domain (data not shown). Southern blot analysis of PCR products generated from the 80 HIPs identified in this screen showed an additional four clones to be mouse eHAND (data not shown). The concept that eHAND could form an efficient homodimer had never occurred to us because its expression pattern defined the gene within class B of the bHLH superfamily, which are generally thought not to form homodimers efficiently. To investigate this finding in more detail, we constructed a full-length eHANDVP16 fusion to determine whether full-length eHAND could form homodimers in yeast. Concurrently, we looked at the ability of eHAND to form heterodimers with the HLH protein Heir I, the mouse E-protein PAN1, and the bHLH domain of dHAND. As expected from our initial findings, eHAND failed to rescue yeast plated on quadruple dropout medium when transfected with our empty VP16–3 containing prey construct or when transfected with irrelevant prey clone 5.68 (Fig.1 A). β-Galactosidase activity confirms that no significant interaction occurs between eHAND and VP16 or with clone 5.68 (Fig. 1 B). We also observed no significant interaction by growth or β-galactosidase analysis of eHAND with the HLH protein HEIR1. As expected, eHAND and PAN1 rescues growth of yeast plated on quadruple dropout medium and shows 25-fold increase in activation of β-galactosidase activity (Fig.1 B). The nonspecific control bait containing the WW 3 domain of NEDD4 (WW3NEDD4) did not rescue significantly yeast plated on quadruple drop out medium when cotransformed with eHANDVP16 or any of our other preys and only accounted for a slight increase in β-galactosidase activity over control when cotransformed with eHAND (Fig. 1). Full-length eHAND transfected with itself, rescued yeast growth, and produced a more than 70-fold activation of β-galactosidase activity over control (Fig. 1). As expected, we observe yeast rescue when eHAND is cotransfected with the bHLH of dHAND. The HAND proteins share a high amino acid identity within their bHLH domains and growth rescue and a 25-fold increase in β-galactosidase activity for the HAND heterodimer are similar to results obtained with PAN1 (Fig. 1). Moreover, because only the bHLH of dHAND was used in this assay, it indicates that the interactions observed between d- and eHAND and e- and eHAND are likely to be through the bHLH domain. Although these results are suggestive that the HAND genes are capable of forming homo- and heterodimers with each other, it is not clear whether these interactions occur in a nonyeast system. To address this question, we used a biochemical pull-down approach to determine whether the dimerization properties of d- and eHAND observed in yeast would occur in an in vitro system. To demonstrate the ability of the HAND genes to form homo- and heterodimers in a nonyeast system, we employed a pull-down assay using a bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins of dHAND and eHAND that were immobilized onto glutathione-linked agarose beads and performed co-incubations with 35S-labeled in vitro transcribed and translated proteins. Co-incubations were then washed, and all protein retained on the beads was separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography or PhosphorImager exposure (Fig. 2). As a control, the irrelevant bait 5.68 was constructed as a GST fusion to ensure that interactions observed are specific. Completely consistent with the yeast two-hybrid results, both dHAND and eHAND are retained on the GSTeHAND beads, indicating that the eHAND can form homo- and dHAND/eHAND heterodimers. The lack of retention of the radiolabeled d- and eHAND with an equal amount of GST5.68 protein shows that interaction with these bHLH factors is occurring specifically. (Fig. 2). When GSTdHAND linked beads were incubated with the radiolabeled proteins, results similar to those obtained with eHAND were observed (Fig. 2). As expected, GSTdHAND pulled down dHAND, eHAND, and E12, which demonstrates that full-length dHAND can form homodimers and heterodimers with eHAND and E12 (Fig. 2). No significant retention of the radiolabeled proteins with GST5.68 occurred consistent with the yeast two-hybrid results (Fig. 2). Taken together, the yeast two-hybrid results and biochemical pull-down results strongly suggest that the bHLH domains of both d- and eHAND have dimerization properties that allow for efficient homodimer formation and the formation of efficient dHAND/eHAND heterodimers. To determine whether HAND genes could interact in vivo, we looked at the ability of eHAND to homo/heterodimerize within a mammalian cell using a mammalian two-hybrid assay. Bait plasmids for eHAND and Id were used against a panel of preys in COS cells (Fig.3). When the empty bait plasmid pBIND was cotransfected with our series of prey plasmids, no significant luciferase activity is observed (Fig. 3). Analysis of pBIND Id shows no significant interaction with empty prey plasmid; however, a strong activation of the luciferase reporter is seen when the Id bait is cotransfected with pSVE47VP16 (7.5-fold) and pACT MyoD (9.0-fold) (Fig.3). These results confirm previous findings that Id can interact with both of these factors and confirms that our interaction assay is working (Fig. 2). Interaction of Id with eHAND and dHAND, however, showed background levels of luciferase activity confirming our yeast two-hybrid results, suggesting that HAND genes do not interact with Id to any significant degree (Fig. 3). When pBIND eHAND is cotransfected with the empty prey vector pACT in our mammalian two-hybrid assay basal levels of luciferase activity are observed (Fig. 3). In agreement with our yeast and pull-down data, eHAND shows strong interaction when cotransfected with pSVE47VP16, further confirming the ability of the HAND genes to form heterodimers with the Class A family of bHLH genes. (Fig. 3). When pBIND eHAND is co transfected with pACT eHAND or pACT dHAND, we observe a significant increase in luciferase activity, indicating that HAND homodimers and heterodimers can form efficiently within mammalian cells (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, eHAND also showed a noticeable increase in luciferase activity when cotransfected with pACT MyoD (Fig. 3). The biological significance of this interaction is unclear as eHAND and MyoD are not coexpressed during development; however, the fact that eHAND can heterodimerize with another non-HAND Class B bHLH factor suggests that HAND genes may regulate transcription by dimerizing with both class A and class B bHLH partners. The observation that eHAND could form heterodimers with MyoD suggested to us that HAND genes might have a wide range of dimerization partners such that any coexpressed bHLH gene could potentially be a biologically important HAND partner. Recently the HRT family of bHLH transcription factors was identified, and HRT1 and HRT2 were shown to be expressed within the early stages of the developing heart concurrent with both d- and eHAND as well as within the developing limb (16Nakagawa O. Nakagawa M. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Srivastava D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 17Kokubo H. Lun Y. Johnson R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Steidl C. Leimeister C. Klaunt B. Maier M. Nanda I. Dixon D. Clarke R. Schmid M. M. G. Genomics. 2000; 66: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To look at interaction, we performed GST pull downs with all three HRT factors (Fig. 4). Results show that both GSTdHAND and GSTeHAND retain significant amounts of radiolabeled HRT1, 2, and 3 when compared with levels of pulled-down HRT proteins observed with GST or GST 5.68 beads, indicating efficient heterodimerization. Yeast two-hybrid interactions confirm these observations (data not shown). Taken together these results suggest that d- and eHAND can dimerize with HRT factors and thus could effect transcription by directly binding DNA in an HRT/HAND complex. To examine the DNA binding properties of the HAND homodimers and heterodimers, gel mobility shift assays were performed using double-stranded oligonucleotides containing an E box sequence that was reported to bind eHAND/E12 using in vitro transcribed and translated proteins (10Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Results of these experiments recapitulated previously published results showing no HAND homodimer binding (data not shown and Ref. 10Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Given the heterodimerization of MyoD with eHAND, we wanted to determine whether HAND dimerization could negatively regulate MyoD/E12 DNA binding by titration of both E12 and MyoD (Fig. 5). In this experiment,in vitro transcribed and translated MyoD and E12 were incubated with an E box sequence from the MCK enhancer previously shown to bind this heterodimer (3Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected MyoD/E12 complexes shifted the migration of the labeled oligo, and this migration was inhibited by the addition of excess cold oligo but not by the addition of a mutant oligo that did not contain an E box (Fig. 5). Interestingly, addition of an equal amount of either eHAND or dHAND reduced the intensity of the shifted MyoD/E12 complex showing a disruption of DNA binding (Fig.5). Clearly in light of the mammalian two-hybrid results showing MyoD/eHAND and E12/eHAND dimerization, the reduction of MyoD/E12 bound to DNA is a result of dHAND and eHAND directly competing for dimerization with both of these factors. Thus, HAND genes may act as negative regulators of certain class A and class B bHLH genes in a manner analogous to MISTI and Id family members. In our efforts to find novel HIPs that interact with eHAND using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have uncovered the ability of eHAND and dHAND to form homodimers and heterodimers in vivo. This is an important finding because HAND genes, based on expression patterns and their initial isolation in yeast two-hybrid screens using E12 as bait, have been assumed to be biologically active only when dimerized with E-proteins. Unlike the myogenic bHLH genes, HAND genes are fully capable of forming homodimers and heterodimers with themselves in mammalian cells, suggesting that the various dimeric forms of the HAND genes can control the transcription of a diverse set of presently unknown downstream genes. The skeletal muscle bHLH gene MISTI has been shown to form homodimers and heterodimers with MyoD. (26Lemcercier C. To R.Q. Carrasco K. Kinieczny S.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1412-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The MyoD/MISTI heterodimer is thought to form an inactive complex, blocking MyoD from forming E-protein heterodimers and thus inhibiting its activity. Our data show that HAND genes can function in the same manner as MISTI, and although HAND/MyoD interaction appears to be biologically irrelevant, it does strongly suggest that HAND genes could sequester yet to be discovered, coexpressed bHLH factors by a similar mechanisms. The HRTs (also known as HESRs and HEYs) are expressed within the somatic mesoderm, central nervous system, kidney, and nasal epithelium and like the Hairy and Enhancer of Split (HES) bHLH factors, HRTs have been shown to depend on notch signaling (16Nakagawa O. Nakagawa M. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Srivastava D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 17Kokubo H. Lun Y. Johnson R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Steidl C. Leimeister C. Klaunt B. Maier M. Nanda I. Dixon D. Clarke R. Schmid M. M. G. Genomics. 2000; 66: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). HRT1 and HRT2 are also coexpressed with the HAND genes during both limb and cardiac development. Members of the HES family of bHLH factors repress transcription via binding a cis-acting element termed a N box and are thought to establish boundaries of expression within the tissue in which they are expressed. Because HRTs respond to the same signaling pathway as HES factors, these genes are thought to play a similar biological role (16Nakagawa O. Nakagawa M. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Srivastava D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 17Kokubo H. Lun Y. Johnson R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Very recently expression studies of dHAND within the developing limbs of mice, chickens, and fish show that dHAND plays an important role in limb anterior-posterior patterning (27Charite J. McFadden D.G. Olson E.N. Development. 2000; 127: 2461-2470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Fernandez-Teran M. Piedra M.E. Kathiriya I.S. Srivastava D. Rodriguez-Rey J.C. Ros M.A. Development. 2000; 127: 2133-2142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yelon D. Ticho B. Halpern M.E. Ruvinsky I. Ho R.K. Silver L.M. Stainier D.Y.R. Development. 2000; 127: 2573-2582PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that HAND genes play a direct role in anterior-posterior patterning taken together with our data showing that HAND genes can interact with HRT genes, which are postulated to establish discrete boundaries of gene expression that set up embryonic patterning, strongly suggest that HAND and HRT gene function in controlling anterior-posterior patterning may be through heterodimerization and possibly independent of E protein dimerization. The ability of E proteins to form heterodimers with class B genes established the paradigm of how these ubiquitously expressed genes play a role in tissue-specific transcription. Myogenic bHLH family members that are expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle give the E proteins their specificity to implement skeletal muscle specification and differentiation. HAND genes are expressed within heart, neural crest, lateral, and extraembryonic mesoderm, developing sympathetic nerves and maternally derived deciduum. When considering this complex expression profile, it is difficult to imagine how these genes could control specific gene expression in these diverse tissues solely by heterodimerization with E proteins. It has been recently reported that E12/E47 is not expressed within trophoblast giant cells, a cell type that has been shown to require eHAND for proper development (13Firulli A.B. McFadden D.G. Lin Q. Srivastava D. Olson E.N. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 15Riley P. Anson-Cartwright L. Cross J.C. Nat Genet. 1998; 18: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar,30Scott I.C. Anson-Cartwright L. RIiley P. Reda D. Cross J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 530-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus, eHAND homodimers and/or an eHAND heterodimer with an unidentified bHLH protein regulate transcription in an E-protein independent environment. The observation that d and eHAND can interact with MyoD and HRTs suggests that HAND genes are not limited in their choice of dimeric partners. Therefore, it is likely that transcription of HAND-regulated genes within different tissues as well as affinity of DNA binding of cis-acting targets may be mediated by the bHLH partner, as is the case with E proteins. Speculation on the role of HAND dimerization in the developing heart becomes extremely compelling. Most interesting the sided expression of dHAND in the right ventricle and eHAND in the left ventricle represents an anterior-posterior expression that is made left-right through cardiac looping (31Olson E.N. Srivastava D. Science. 1996; 272: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In light of the role of dHAND in the developing limb, it suggests that HAND genes may play a role in heart patterning. dHAND is expressed in the developing right ventricle and eHAND is expressed in the developing left ventricle and with both genes being coexpressed at the ventricle boundary and within the outflow tract, a transcription factor gradient is formed (Fig.6). dHAND homodimers would form preferentially within the right ventricle, eHAND homodimers within the left ventricle, and the boundary of the developing ventricles and outflow tract would have a mixture of dHAND and eHAND allowing for dHAND/eHAND heterodimers (Fig. 6). Considering the ubiquitous expression of E proteins within the heart, as well as HRT factors and yet to be discovered cardiac bHLH factors, an extremely diverse population of HAND transcriptional dimers is possible. The ability of HAND proteins to form homo- and heterodimers with themselves and other class B bHLH factors allows for both direct transcriptional activation/repression via DNA binding and the negative regulation of itself and other bHLH factors via the formation of nonbinding dimer complexes. Recently, eHAND was shown to inhibit the DNA binding of MASH2 to the MCK E box by competing with MASH2 for E12 (30Scott I.C. Anson-Cartwright L. RIiley P. Reda D. Cross J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 530-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In biochemical pull-down analysis, we show that eHAND can heterodimerize with MASH1 (unpublished results). In light of this data and interaction of eHAND with MyoD and the HRTs, it is possible that eHAND can heterodimerize with MASH2, and thus the reduction of DNA binding of the MASH2/E12 complex is a dual competition of eHAND for both bHLH factors. This type of negative regulation is observed in the Id family of HLH genes (32Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). The Id HLH proteins lack a basic region that is used to contact DNA and can form heterodimers with E proteins locking E12/E47 in inactive complexes. When considering the variations in gene expression and protein modifications such as phosphorylation that can alter protein-protein interactions, a resulting shift of dimerization choices of the HAND genes may represent the mechanism by which these proteins regulate function. Although reports on the dHAND and eHAND knockout mice show down-regulation of several genes, only a report on the regulation of the adenylosuccinate synthetase I gene shows direct regulation by dHAND or eHAND, and the exact cis-acting elements within the adenylosuccinate synthetase gene promoter that respond to HAND activation have yet to be identified (33Lewis A.L. Xia Y. Datta S.K. McMillin J. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). bHLH genes have been shown to bind to either E box or N box sequences, but it has not been established whether other sequences can be utilized for DNA binding. In detailed analysis of the DNA binding characteristics of the myogenic bHLH genes and E-proteins using binding site selection protocols, it has been established that each member of the bHLH dimer recognizes a specific half-site within the E box and that different combinations of these factors selectively bind different E boxes (34Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 35Writght W.E. Binder M. Funk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4101-4110Google Scholar). Casting experiments done on eHAND show that eHAND/E12 heterodimers bind a degenerate E box NNTCTG and that eHAND homodimers can not bind this sequence (10Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Because of the lack of any cis-acting elements known to be transcriptionally regulated by d- or eHAND, the question of whether HAND homodimers, heterodimers, and/or HAND/E-protein heterodimers can regulate expression remains unanswered. In the previous DNA binding analysis, eHAND was combined with an E-protein in the casting procedure. DNA binding sequences for HAND homodimers and E-protein-independent heterodimers casting experiments will need to be performed to determine whether any HAND dimer pair has the ability to bind DNA. It is possible that HAND homodimers and dHAND/eHAND heterodimers recognize a non-E box DNA target sequence. This situation is seen with the bHLH factor HES-1, which does not bind efficiently to an E box but recognizes a CACNAG motif termed a N box (32Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 36Ishibashi M. Ang S.L. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Guillemot F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3136-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Interestingly eHAND, like HES-1, contains a proline within its basic domain that is atypical for bHLH family members. However, we do not see DNA binding of eHAND to oligonucleotides containing N box sequences with or without E12 (data not shown). Taken together our results show that, unlike most class B bHLH factors, eHAND and dHAND have expanded dimerization specificity that allows them to form a variety of dimeric complexes in vivo. This observation suggests that HAND genes can function to negatively regulate themselves as well as other bHLH proteins by directly competing for bHLH partners. By forming homo- and heterodimers, HAND genes can alter their own DNA binding recognition and the DNA binding properties of other bHLH genes revealing a complex mechanism for HAND gene regulation of biological function.

This unique topological linkage between protein and DNA allows the clamp to tether DNA polymerase to the template and move along with the polymerase as it extends a new DNA strand (1Hingorani M.M.

Thus, the circular clamp serves as a processivity factor, allowing DNA polymerase to replicate several thousand nucleotides without dissociation from the template (2Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev.

The two core polymerases function in a coordinated fashion, with one replicating the leading strand DNA and the other replicating the lagging strand DNA (Fig. 1) (14Yuzhakov A. Turner J. O'Donnell M.

When the holoenzyme is assembled at the DNA replication fork, the cores assume their roles as leading or lagging strand polymerase and consequently perform in distinctly different styles. The leading strand polymerase remains continuously associated with its sliding clamp and the DNA template during replication. Conversely, the lagging strand polymerase must repeatedly bind and release DNA as it synthesizes discrete Okazaki fragments, due to the antiparallel nature of the double helix (17Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 18O'Donnell M.E. J. Biol.

As illustrated in the scheme, (A), the core polymerase replicates an Okazaki fragment to completion, after which it “hops” onto an upstream primer loaded with β to start a new fragment and continue lagging strand DNA synthesis. B, the β clamp left behind remains stably bound to DNA. C, “used” clamps accumulate on the lagging strand until removed by a clamp unloader (γ complex, pol III*, or δ) for reuse at new primed sites.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The mechanism underlying this “polymerase hopping” behavior is based on the ability of the β clamp to serve as a target for the polymerase on DNA (17Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The γ complex clamp loader within pol III* (holoenzyme without β), or γ complex free in solution, assembles β around newly primed sites on the lagging strand DNA template, in preparation for the polymerase. When the polymerase finishes an Okazaki fragment, it releases both the DNA and sliding clamp and cycles rapidly upstream to the new primer and clamp to continue DNA replication (Fig.1) (17Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 18O'Donnell M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16558-16565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This model mechanism predicts that if β remains stably associated with DNA, the clamps abandoned by the polymerase will accumulate along the lagging strand DNA. Indeed, in vitrorolling circle assays performed with pol III* detect increasing amounts of β on the lagging strand DNA as replication proceeds, confirming that clamps left behind by the polymerase remain on the DNA (14Yuzhakov A. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Given that one clamp is used per Okazaki fragment and theEscherichia coli genome size is 4.4 megabases, about 2000–4000 clamps are needed for one round of DNA replication. There are, however, only about 300 β clamps in each cell (19Burgers P.M. Kornberg A. Sakakibara Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5391-5395Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Consequently, each of these clamps must be used more than once during replication of the E. coli genome. Previous studies have shown that β remains stably encircled around DNA with a half-life greater than 70 min (20Yao N. Turner J. Kelman Z. Stukenberg P.T. Dean F. Shechter D. Pan Z.Q. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Therefore, β does not recycle by simply falling off DNA; rather, there exists an active mechanism for retrieving and reusing the clamps during DNA synthesis. In vitro studies suggest there are at least three pathways by which β can be actively removed from DNA. The clamp loader, γ complex, can unload β from DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction (Fig.1) (20Yao N. Turner J. Kelman Z. Stukenberg P.T. Dean F. Shechter D. Pan Z.Q. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 21Naktinis V. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 84: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). pol III* also unloads β from nicked DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction, presumably via the unloading activity of its clamp loading component, γ/τ complex (17Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Finally, we have noted that the δ subunit of γ complex appears capable of removing β from DNA by itself, in the absence of any nucleotide cofactors (22Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The observation that γ complex can unload β from DNA was surprising, since the clamp loader is known primarily for catalyzing β assembly onto DNA. Clearly, these opposing clamp loading and unloading activities must be regulated such that γ complex performs the right function at the right time. Previous studies have shown that the core DNA polymerase and γ complex compete for interaction with β (21Naktinis V. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 84: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). β binds preferentially to γ complex when free in solution, but once γ complex places β on primed DNA, the polymerase binds β with higher affinity, barring further contact between the clamp and clamp loader (21Naktinis V. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 84: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Presumably, only when the lagging strand polymerase abandons β after completing an Okazaki fragment does γ complex regain access to β and unload it from DNA. The process of β loading is complex and requires that multiple subunits of the clamp loader function together. First, the γ subunits bind ATP and trigger conformational changes in γ complex that expose the δ subunit (which is normally occluded by δ′ in the absence of ATP) for interaction with β (22Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 23Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The ATP- and β-bound γ complex also binds a primed DNA template with high affinity (24Hingorani M.M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24550-24563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar,25Bertram J.G. Bloom L.B. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Beechem J.M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24564-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The δ subunit opens the β ring before the γ complex hydrolyzes ATP (22Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 24Hingorani M.M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24550-24563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Finally, two ATP molecules are hydrolyzed, coupled to conformational changes that lead to closure of the clamp around DNA and release of β·DNA from γ complex (22Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 26Hingorani M.M. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5131-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A minimal subcomplex of γ2–4δ1δ′1 without χ and ψ appears sufficient for clamp loading (27Onrust R. Stukenberg P.T. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21681-21686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although their presence facilitates holoenzyme activity under high ionic conditions (28O'Donnell M. Studwell P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1179-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This effect may be due to a stabilizing interaction between the χ subunit of γ complex and single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) on DNA (29Kelman Z. Yuzhakov A. Andjelkovic J. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2436-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The χ-SSB interaction also helps displace the primase from a new primer, allowing γ complex to access the DNA and assemble β around it in preparation for the polymerase (30Yuzhakov A. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6189-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In comparison with clamp loading, the clamp unloading process appears relatively simple in that it only requires opening of the β ring such that it can slip free from DNA (22Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of γ complex-catalyzed clamp unloading has not been defined in detail, it is an ATP-dependent reaction; therefore, the initial steps are probably similar to those of clamp loading. In this case, ATP binding to γ subunits and consequent conformational changes expose the δ subunit, which binds β on DNA and opens the ring, but then instead of closing the ring back around DNA, γ complex allows it to slip free from DNA. The most critical step in this process is ring opening, and δ can open the ring by itself (independent of other proteins as well as ATP). Therefore, it is likely that δ functions just as well as γ complex for clamp unloading and perhaps with greater efficiency, since it does not require ATP to power its activity; nor does it catalyze the reverse reaction and reassemble β onto DNA. In this study, we examined the clamp unloading activities of both γ complex and the δ protein, in order to determine whether δ can serve as the physiological clamp unloader in E. coli. Quantitative Western analyses of cellular protein content were used to determine if there is any free δ protein in E. coli, and quantitative β unloading assays were designed to directly compare γ complex and δ activities. The results show that δ unloads β from DNA as fast as γ complex does, and it is present in 5–7-fold excess over γ complex in E. coli cells. Thus, δ probably performs the clamp unloading function in E. coli, sparing the limited number of γ complex and pol III* molecules in the cell for other important functions such as processive DNA replication.

Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Hexokinase was purchased from Sigma. The catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase produced in E. coli was a gift from Dr. Susan Taylor (University of California, San Diego). Buffer A is 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 4% (v/v) glycerol, 8 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mmATP. Buffer B is buffer A without ATP. Buffer C is 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. SDS cell cracking buffer contains 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mmdithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol. TTBS is 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 136 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. The unloading substrate, β·DNA, was prepared as follows. βPK (2 μm), 32P-labeled at the C-terminal kinase site (21Naktinis V. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 84: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), was incubated with 1 μm γ complex and 1.25 pmol of gpII nicked pBluescript plasmid DNA (20Yao N. Turner J. Kelman Z. Stukenberg P.T. Dean F. Shechter D. Pan Z.Q. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) in buffer A. Following a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was applied to a 5-ml A-15m gel filtration column equilibrated in buffer B at 4 °C in the cold room (to maximize stability of the β·DNA complex), and 200-μl fractions were collected. 32P-β·DNA (in the excluded fractions) separates from free 32P-β, γ complex, and ATP (in the included fractions). Two peak fractions containing 32P-β·DNA were pooled for use in the unloading reactions. Clamp-unloading reactions (45 μl in buffer B) contained approximately 15 nm32P-β·DNA and were initiated by the addition of γ complex (0.18, 0.3, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 μm) in the presence of 0.5 mm ATP, pol III* (0.18 μm) in the presence of 0.5 mm ATP or by the addition of δ (0.3, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 μm) in the absence of ATP. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 0–1500 s. Reactions containing γ complex or pol III* were quenched by rapid depletion of ATP upon adding 0.5 units of hexokinase and 500 nmol of glucose. Reactions containing δ were quenched by the addition of 5 μm βmonomer. 32P-β was separated from 32P-β·DNA by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel for 2 h (100 V) at 4 °C in Tris borate buffer. Gels were fixed with 5% acetic acid for 10 min; placed under DE-81 paper, nitrocellulose membrane, and paper towels; and flattened under a heavy weight. Bands corresponding to 32P-β on and off DNA were visualized and quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The amount of total β bound to DNA at time 0 was measured (with no unloader in the reaction), and the fraction of β remaining on DNA (after adding the unloader) was then plottedversus time of reaction. Unloading assays testing the efficacy of βmonomer as a quencher of δ activity were performed as follows: 5 μm βmonomer was added to a 45-μl unloading reaction (containing 15 nmβ·DNA in buffer B), followed by the addition of 0.3–2 μm δ. After 25 min, the reaction was analyzed for β unloading as described above. No detectable unloading was observed, similar to the negative control with 32P-β·DNA alone, in contrast to the positive control performed with δ without the addition of βmonomer. In qualitative assays comparing the unloading activity of γ complex and δ, 80 nm32P-β·DNA was mixed with increasing concentrations of γ complex or δ (final concentrations: 0, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 nm) in buffer A (25 μl) or buffer B (25 μl), respectively. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and loaded directly onto a 1.2% agarose gel, and, following electrophoresis, 32P-β was analyzed as described above. Antibodies used to determine the cellular abundance of γ complex subunits (γ, δ, δ′, χ, and ψ) and β were produced by collecting serum from rabbits injected with purified proteins. Sources for the rabbit polyclonal sera were as follows. δ sera was produced by BabCo (Berkley, CA); β and γ sera were produced by Poccono Rabbit Farms; and sera for δ′, χ, and ψ were produced by Covance (Radnor, PA). The antibodies were purified further using a modification described in Ref. 37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.16-18.18Google Scholar. Each highly purified protein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell), and detected by staining with Ponceau S. A narrow strip of the membrane containing the protein was cut out and blocked with SuperBlock (Pierce) for 15 min, washed with TTBS (2 times, 5 min each), and layered with 200–600 μl of crude serum. The depleted serum was removed after incubation for 2 h at 25 °C (with gentle shaking). The membrane was washed with TTBS and then layered with 200 μl of 0.2 m glycine, 1 mm EGTA (pH 2.5) to recover the antibody. After 20 min, the liquid was collected and neutralized immediately with an equal volume of 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5). E. coli cells (Strain C600) were plated from a glycerol stock and grown overnight at 37 °C, and a single colony was used to inoculate 1 liter of liquid Luria broth. The E. coli were grown at 37 °C with continuous shaking, and cell growth was monitored by measuring absorbance at 600 nm at various times. At A 600 = 0.44, 0.88, and 4.87, aliquots were removed, and serial dilutions of 1 in 104, 105, 106, 107, and 108 were prepared. Next, 100 μl of each dilution was plated onto LB agar plates, and colonies were counted the next day to determine the number of cells per ml of culture at eachA 600. The cells were also counted directly under a high power microscope (Olympus IX70) using a hemacytometer (Hausser-Scientific). Additionally, 1- and 10-ml aliquots of the cells were removed at A 600 = 0.44, 0.88, and 4.87 and collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. The cells were resuspended in SDS cell cracking buffer and frozen rapidly at −70 °C to prevent proteolysis. These aliquots of crude cell extract (containing known quantities of cells) were used to quantitate intracellular amounts of γ complex subunits and β by Western analysis. Protein standards for quantitative Western analysis were generated by subjecting known concentrations of pure γ, δ, δ′, χ, ψ, and β proteins to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were calculated from absorbance at 280 nm and known molar extinction coefficients of 20,940 (γ monomer), 46,830 (δ), 60,440 (δ′), 29,400 (χ), 24,280 (ψ), and 15,130 (β monomer) as well as by Bradford assays. The proteins were diluted in SDS cell cracking buffer containing 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and varying amounts of each protein were applied to 12% gels to prepare a standard curve. Additionally, samples of the crude extracts, prepared as described above (A 600 = 0.44, 0.88, and 4.87), were also applied to the same gels and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (100 V for 45 min). The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 100 V for 2 h (4 °C). The membranes were blocked by a 15-min incubation with SuperBlock, washed with TTBS (2 × 5 min), and incubated overnight with a 1:2000 dilution of purified antibody in TTBS plus 1% gelatin. The antibody was washed off with TTBS (3 × 5 min), followed by incubation with a 1:10,000 dilution of anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Sigma) for 30 min. The membranes were washed again with TTBS, developed with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and exposed to film for 15–60 s. The films were scanned on a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics), and bands corresponding to protein standards as well as bands of appropriate molecular weight in the crude extract were quantitated. The signals were plotted versus protein concentration (ng) to yield standard plots. The linear slope from the standard plot of each protein was used to calculate the amount of that protein present in the crude cell extract. Finally, the number of protein molecules per cell (C) was calculated using the equation,C=M×A/L×NEquation 1 where M is the amount of protein in the crude cell extract (grams), A is Avogadro's number (6.023 × 1023 molecules/mol), L is the molecular mass of the protein (g/mol), and N is the number of cells (in the volume of crude cell extract used for Western analysis). The molecular masses of the proteins are as follows: γ (tetramer), 190 kDa; δ, 38.7 kDa; δ′, 36.9 kDa; χ, 16.6 kDa; ψ, 15.2 kDa; β (dimer), 81.2 kDa. E. coli strain C600 was grown in 1 liter of Luria broth and harvested at A 600 = 0.88. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10% sucrose. The following procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were lysed with lysozyme (38Kornberg T. Gefter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5369-5375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and two passes through the French press at 20,000 psi. The crude lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 17,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected and diluted with buffer C (0 NaCl) to lower the conductivity to that of 50 mm NaCl. The supernatant was loaded onto an 8-ml Mono-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed with 80 ml of buffer C (100 mm NaCl). Proteins were eluted from the column using a 100–500 mm NaCl gradient (160 ml total). 2-ml fractions were collected and split into 0.5- and 1.5-ml aliquots. SDS cell cracking buffer (0.5 ml) was added to the smaller aliquots (for Western analysis), and the fractions were frozen rapidly at −70 °C to prevent proteolysis. The larger aliquots were stored frozen at −70 °C for activity assays. 20-μl aliquots of every other Mono-Q column fraction from 8 to 48 (saved for Western analysis as described above) were subjected to electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed for δ by Western blotting as described above. The state of δ in the fractions (free or in γ complex) was determined by DNA replication activity assays as follows. Reactions testing for γ complex contained 35 fmol of primed M13mp18 single-stranded DNA; 0.2 pmol of β; 0.12 pmol of polymerase core (αεθ); 60 μm dATP, dGTP, and dCTP; 20 μm [α-32P]dTTP (final concentrations); 10.5 pmol of SSB (tetramer); and no γ complex in 20 μl of buffer A. 5-μl aliquots of the fractions were added to the reactions, and the amount of DNA synthesized after 30 min at 37 °C was quantitated as described (31Studwell P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1171-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test for free δ in the fractions, a similar experiment was performed using the same reaction mixture plus 300 fmol of γδ′χψ without δ. The incubation time was reduced to 3 min to minimize background DNA synthesis (due to γ complex in the crude lysate), and the reactions were analyzed as described above. In earlier studies, we found that γ complex, alone and in pol III*, unloads clamps from DNA (17Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF Pub"
https://openalex.org/W2015999323,"A new class of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) is reported. The GDH of Streptomyces clavuligerus was purified to homogeneity and characterized. It has a native molecular mass of 1,100 kDa and exists as an α6 oligomeric structure composed of 183-kDa subunits. GDH, which requires AMP as an essential activator, shows a maximal rate of catalysis in 100 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 30 °C. Under these conditions, GDH displayed hyperbolic behavior toward ammonia (Km, 33 mm) and sigmoidal responses to changes in α-ketoglutarate (S0.5 1.3 mm;nH 1.50) and NADH (S0.5 20 μm; nH 1.52) concentrations. Aspartate and asparagine were found to be allosteric activators. This enzyme is inhibited by an excess of NADH or NH4+, by some tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and by ATP. This GDH seems to be a catabolic enzyme as indicated by the following: (i) it is NAD-specific; (ii) it shows a high value of Km for ammonia; and (iii) when S. clavuligerus was cultured in minimal medium containing glutamate as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen, a 5-fold increase in specific activity of GDH was detected compared with cultures provided with glycerol and ammonia. GDH has 1,651 amino acids, and it is encoded by a DNA fragment of 4,953 base pairs (gdh gene). It shows strong sequence similarity to proteins encoded by unidentified open reading frames present in the genomes of species belonging to the genera Mycobacterium,Rickettsia, Pseudomonas, Vibrio,Shewanella, and Caulobacter, suggesting that it has a broad distribution.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 23-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 2Merrick M.J. Edwards R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 604-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that catalyze the reversible oxidative deamination of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate and ammonia according to Reaction 1.glutamate+NAD(P) ++H2O⇋αKG+NAD(P)H+H++NH4+Reaction1Accordingly, GDHs, as well as aminotransferases, are enzymes that participate in the reapportionment of α-amino groups inside cells, playing a central role in the regulation of the flux of intermediates between different biosynthetic and catabolic pathways (3Reitzer L.J. Magasanik B. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1987; 1: 302-320Google Scholar, 4Jensen R.A. Gu W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).The GDHs identified in lower eukaryotes, or in prokaryotes, usually act with one particular coenzyme (NAD+ or NADP+), whereas those of higher eukaryotes have a dual coenzyme specificity (NAD(P)-GDH, EC 1.4.1.3) (5Nomenclature Committee of the IUBEnzyme Nomenclature. Academic Press, New York1992Google Scholar). In line with the generally observed biochemical rules for oxidative catabolic steps and reductive biosynthetic steps, NAD-GDHs (EC 1.4.1.2) are usually geared to catabolism of glutamate (6Duncan P.A. White B.A. Mackie R.I. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 4032-4037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and by contrast, NADP-GDHs (EC 1.4.1.4) are anabolic enzymes engaged in ammonia assimilation (7Consalvi V. Chiaraluce R. Politi L. Vaccaro R. de Rosa M. Scandurra R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).All GDHs reported to date are oligomeric enzymes (1Barker H.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 23-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 2Merrick M.J. Edwards R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 604-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Reitzer L.J. Magasanik B. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1987; 1: 302-320Google Scholar) and, depending on the subunit size and monomer composition, can be grouped into the following two different structural types: hexameric GDHs (with six identical subunits of about 50 kDa) and tetrameric GDHs (with four identical subunits having a molecular mass close to 115 kDa). The hexameric type includes the NAD- or NADP-GDHs from most known bacterial species (8Rice D.W. Hornby D.P. Engel P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the NADP-GDHs from lower eukaryotes (9Kinnaird J.H. Fincham J.R.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1983; 26: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and the NAD(P)-GDHs from vertebrates (10Nakatani Y. Schneider M. Banner C. Freese E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The tetrameric type includes the NAD-GDHs found in lower eukaryotes (9Kinnaird J.H. Fincham J.R.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1983; 26: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Dehydrogenase enzymes that utilize glutamate, leucine, valine, and phenylalanine have been recognized as common members of a large superfamily (11Baker P.J. Turnbull A.P. Sedelnikova S.E. Stillman T.J. Rice D.W. Cur. Biol. 1995; 3: 693-705Google Scholar, 12Britton K.L. Baker P.J. Engel P.C. Rice D.W. Stillman T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 938-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, in line with proper hierarchical ordering, GDHs should be considered as a family of enzymes that includes two subfamilies as follows: small GDHs (S_GDHs, which contain the two member classes 50I kDa GDHs and 50II kDa GDHs) and large GDHs (L_GDHs, which until now contained only the 115-kDa GDHs). Some interesting considerations of the evolutionary relationship between tetrameric and hexameric GDHs have been ventured (13Benachenhou-Lahfa N. Forterre P. Labedan B. J. Mol. Evol. 1993; 36: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 14Britton K.L. Baker P.J. Rice D.W. Stillman T.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 851-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and this topic area can now be reevaluated and expanded with the current discovery of a more diverse and complex GDH membership than previously known.Despite the fact that GDH has an ubiquitous distribution in nature, this enzyme had not been previously detected in the important industrial species Streptomyces clavuligerus (15Aharonowitz Y. Friedrich C.G. Arch. Microbiol. 1980; 125: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For this reason, it was proposed that the catabolism of glutamic acid inS. clavuligerus does not require the participation of this enzymatic activity (15Aharonowitz Y. Friedrich C.G. Arch. Microbiol. 1980; 125: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast with the latter conclusion, we found that when the assimilation of glutamic acid by S. clavuligerus cultured in a medium containing this amino acid as the carbon and nitrogen source was studied, a GDH activity was, in fact, present. Here we report the purification, characterization, and sequence of the encoding gene of this enzyme, thus providing a first documentation of a previously unknown class of GDH. Phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships are discussed. Glutamate dehydrogenases (GDHs)1 are a broadly distributed group of enzymes (1Barker H.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 23-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 2Merrick M.J. Edwards R.A. Microbiol.

Thus, in line with proper hierarchical ordering, GDHs should be considered as a family of enzymes that includes two subfamilies as follows: small GDHs (S_GDHs, which contain the two member classes 50I kDa GDHs and 50II kDa GDHs) and large GDHs (L_GDHs, which until now contained only the 115-kDa GDHs). Some interesting considerations of the evolutionary relationship between tetrameric and hexameric GDHs have been ventured (13Benachenhou-Lahfa N. Forterre P. Labedan B. J. Mol. Evol. 1993; 36: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 14Britton K.L. Baker P.J. Rice D.W. Stillman T.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 851-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and this topic area can now be reevaluated and expanded with the current discovery of a more diverse and complex GDH membership than previously known. Despite the fact that GDH has an ubiquitous distribution in nature, this enzyme had not been previously detected in the important industrial species Streptomyces clavuligerus (15Aharonowitz Y. Friedrich C.G. Arch. Microbiol. 1980; 125: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For this reason, it was proposed that the catabolism of glutamic acid inS. clavuligerus does not require the participation of this enzymatic activity (15Aharonowitz Y. Friedrich C.G. Arch. Microbiol. 1980; 125: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast with the latter conclusion, we found that when the assimilation of glutamic acid by S. clavuligerus cultured in a medium containing this amino acid as the carbon and nitrogen source was studied, a GDH activity was, in fact, present. Here we report the purification, characterization, and sequence of the encoding gene of this enzyme, thus providing a first documentation of a previously unknown class of GDH. Phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships are discussed. We appreciate the helpful and insightful comments of Professor David W. Rice on some aspects of our analysis.

https://openalex.org/W4250556639,"MSH4 is a meiosis-specific MutS homolog. In yeast, it is required for reciprocal recombination and proper segregation of homologous chromosomes at meiosis I. MLH1 (MutL homolog 1) facilitates both mismatch repair and crossing over during meiosis in yeast. Germ-line mutations in the MLH1 human gene are responsible for hereditary nonpolyposis cancer, but the analysis of MLH1-deficient mice has revealed that MLH1 is also required for reciprocal recombination in mammals. Here we show that hMSH4 interacts with hMLH1. The two proteins are coimmunoprecipitated regardless of the presence of DNA or ATP, suggesting that the interaction does not require the binding of MSH4 to DNA. The domain of hMSH4 responsible for the interaction is in the amino-terminal part of the protein whereas the region that contains the ATP binding site and helix-turn-helix motif does not bind to hMLH1. Immunolocalization analysis shows that MSH4 is present at sites along the synaptonemal complex as soon as homologous chromosomes synapse. The number of MSH4 foci decreases gradually as pachynema progresses. During this transition, MLH1 foci begin to appear and colocalize with MSH4. These results suggest that MSH4 is first required for chromosome synapsis and that this MutS homologue is involved later with MLH1 in meiotic reciprocal recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2142729196,"The integrin α9β1 is expressed on epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, skeletal muscle, and neutrophils and recognizes at least three distinct ligands: vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), tenascin-C, and osteopontin. The α9 subunit is structurally similar to the integrin α4 subunit, and α9β1 and α4β1 both recognize VCAM-1 as a ligand. We therefore examined whether the disintegrin EC3, which we have recently shown specifically inhibits the binding of α4 integrins to ligands, would also be a functional inhibitor of α9β1. EC3 and a novel heterodimeric disintegrin that we identified, EC6, both were potent inhibitors of α9β1-mediated adhesion to VCAM-1 and of neutrophil migration across tumor necrosis factor-activated endothelial cells. A peptide containing a novel MLDG motif shared by both of these disintegrins also inhibited α9β1- and α4β1-mediated adhesion to VCAM-1. Surprisingly though, concentrations of EC3 that completely inhibited adhesion of α9-transfected cells to VCAM-1 had little or no effect on adhesion to either of the other α9β1 ligands, osteopontin and tenascin-C. Furthermore, peptides AEIDGIEL and SVVYGLR, which we have previously shown inhibit binding of α9β1-expressing cells to tenascin-C and osteopontin, respectively, had no effect on adhesion to VCAM-1. These data suggest that there are structurally distinct requirements for interactions of the α9β1 integrin with VCAM-1 and the extracellular matrix ligands osteopontin and tenascin-C.

We have mapped the ligand-binding site in tenascin-C to an exposed peptide loop in the third fibronectin type III repeat containing the sequence AEIDGIEL (7Yokosaki Y. Matsuura N. Higashiyama S.

We have also mapped the α9β1 ligand-binding site in osteopontin (6Yokosaki Y. Matsuura N. Sasaki T. Murakami I. Schneider H. Higashiyama S. Saitoh Y. Yamakido M. Taooka Y. Sheppard D. J. Biol.

Although an initial report suggested that α9β1 might bind to an RGD-containing sequence in osteopontin (5Smith L.L. Giachelli C.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we were able to demonstrate by extensive mutagenesis that the binding site is within the linear peptide sequence SVVYGLR immediately adjacent to the RGD site (6Yokosaki Y. Matsuura N. Sasaki T. Murakami I. Schneider H. Higashiyama S. Saitoh Y. Yamakido M. Taooka Y. Sheppard D. J. Biol.

Structurally, the α9 subunit is closely related to the α4 subunit, and on the basis of sequence homology α4 and α9 appear to be the only known members of a subfamily of integrin α subunits that lack both an insertional domain and an extracellular disulfide-linked cleavage site (2Palmer E.L. Ruegg C. Ferrando R. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both subunits are expressed on leukocytes and mediate leukocyte migration (1Taooka Y. Chen J. Yednock T. Sheppard D. J.

Finally, both integrins recognize VCAM-1 as a ligand (1Taooka Y. Chen J. Yednock T. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 9Elices M.J. Osborn L.

We have shown that both α4β1 and α9β1 contribute to the chemotactic migration of human neutrophils across endothelial cell monolayers activated by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), an effect that is due at least in part to interaction of these integrins with VCAM-1 induced in response to TNFα (1Taooka Y. Chen J. Yednock T. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Disintegrins are a family of low molecular weight, cysteine-rich, anti-adhesive proteins that are present in the venoms of various vipers and selectively block the function of integrins (10McLane M.A. Marcinkiewicz C. Vijay-Kumar S. Wierzbicka-Patynowski I. Niewiarowski S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 210: 109-119Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 11Niewiarowski S. McLane M.A. Kloczewiak M. Stewart G.J. Semin. Hematol. 1994; 31: 289-300PubMed Google Scholar). Early studies focused on monomeric disintegrins that express an RGD motif within a 13-amino acid putative hairpin loop that is maintained in an appropriate conformation by a disulfide bridge. Not surprisingly, these disintegrins selectively inhibit integrins that bind to ligands through RGD sites, such as β3 integrins (for eristostatin, kistrin, and bitistatin) or β3 integrins and the fibronectin receptor α5β1 (for echistatin and flavoridin). Recently, however, we isolated a disintegrin from the venom of Echis carinatuscalled EC3 that potently and preferentially inhibited the interactions of α4 integrins with the immunoglobulin family members VCAM-1 and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (12Brando C. Marcinkiewicz C. Goldman B. McLane M.A. Niewiarowski S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). EC3 is composed of two subunits, A and B, in which the RGD motif is substituted by VGD and MLD sequences, respectively (13Marcinkiewicz C. Calvete J.J. Vijay-Kumar S. Marcinkiewicz M.M. Raida M. Schick P. Lobb R.R. Niewiarowski S. Biochem. 1999; 38: 13302-13309Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because of the sequence similarity between α9 and α4, and because both α4 integrins and α9β1 recognize VCAM-1 as a ligand, in this manuscript we examined the effects of EC3 on α9β1-mediated adhesion and neutrophil migration. We also purified a novel related heterodimeric disintegrin, EC6, fromE. carinatus venom, demonstrated that, like EC3, it also has a substitution of MLD for the RGD sequence in one subunit, and examined the effects of this disintegrin on integrin-mediated adhesion and migration.

Mouse monoclonal antibodies SAM1 (against α5), Lia (against β1), and HP2/1 (against α4) were from Immunotech (Westbrook, MA). Mouse monoclonal antibody IB4, against the integrin β2 subunit, was prepared from a hybridoma obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Mouse monoclonal antibody 15/7, which recognizes a ligand binding-dependent epitope on the integrin β1 subunit, was obtained from Ted Yednock (Elan Pharmaceuticals). Human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA), grown in endothelial cell growth medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum, human recombinant epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), gentamycin (50 μg/ml), amphotericin B (50 ng/ml), bovine brain extract (12 μg/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 μg/ml), and were used between passage 4 and 8. α9- and mock-transfected SW480 cells and CHO cells were generated by transfection with the previously described full-length α9 expression plasmid pcDNAIneoα9 (3Yokosaki Y.

Transfected cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and the neomycin analog G-418 (1 mg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Both cell lines continuously expressed high surface levels of α9β1 as determined by flow cytometry with Y9A2. CHO cells expressing αIIbβ3 were a gift from M. Ginsberg (Scripps Research Institute), and all other cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cultured cells were harvested by trypsinization and rinsed with Tris-buffered saline containing 1 nm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2(TBS). Nonspecific binding was blocked with normal goat serum at 4 °C for 10 min. To evaluate the effects of disintegrins on expression of a ligand binding-dependent epitope on the integrin β1 subunit, mock- or α9-transfected SW480 cells were incubated with or without various concentrations of disintegrins in DMEM for 15 min at 4 °C and then incubated with primary antibodies (15/7) at 15 μg/ml for 20 min at 4 °C, followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with phycoerythrin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Between incubations, cells were washed twice with TBS. The stained cells were re-suspended in 100 μl of TBS, and fluorescence was quantified on 5,000 cells with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Rutherford, N.J.). Monomeric and heterodimeric disintegrins were purified from lyophilized viper venoms provided by Latoxan (Valence, France) by one or two steps of HPLC. Echistatin, EC3, and EC6 were purified from E. carinatus suchoreki venom. Lyophilized venom was dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (30 mg/ml). The solution was centrifuged for 5 min at 37 °C to remove insoluble proteins, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was applied to a C-18 HPLC column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA). The column was eluted with an acetonitrile gradient (0–85%) over 45 min. Fig. 1shows that several fractions were eluted from the column under these conditions. Fraction 1 was identified as echistatin, fraction 3 was called EC3, and fraction 6 was called EC6. To obtain higher purity, fractions were re-chromatographed over the same column with a more gradual gradient. A similar method was used to purify eristostatin and EMF-10 from Eristocophis macmahoni venom, kistrin fromAgkistrodon rhodostoma venom, and flavoridin fromTrimeresuris flavoriridis venom. The purity and molecular mass of each disintegrin was evaluated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Amino acid sequencing was carried out by Edman degradation following reduction and ethylpyridylation (13Marcinkiewicz C. Calvete J.J. Vijay-Kumar S. Marcinkiewicz M.M. Raida M. Schick P. Lobb R.R. Niewiarowski S. Biochem. 1999; 38: 13302-13309Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Huang T.-F. Holt J.C. Lukasiewicz H. Niewiarowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 262: 16157-16163Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Monomeric disintegrins, tested according to McLane et al. (19McLane M.A. Kowalska M.A. Silver L. Shattil S. Niewiarowski S. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), were potent inhibitors of platelet aggregation. IC50 values for echistatin, eristostatin, flavoridin, and kistrin were 136, 59, 51, and 40 nm, respectively. All of the heterodimeric disintegrins had IC50 values above 1000 nm. Initial screening cell adhesion assays were performed at Temple University using cells labeled with 5-chloromethyfluorescein diacetate, as described previously (20Marcinkiewicz C. Vijay-Kumar S. McLane M.A. Niewiarowski S. Blood. 1997; 90: 1565-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, various ligands, disintegrins, or antibodies were immobilized on 96-well microtiter plates (Falcon, Pittsburgh, PA) by overnight incubation in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. The coating concentrations used were 2 μg/ml for VCAM-1, 10 μg/ml for fibronectin, and 10 μg/ml for fibrinogen. Antibodies were coated at 10 μg/ml, and disintegrins were coated at 20 μg/ml. Wells were blocked with 1% BSA at 37 °C. Cells were labeled by incubation with 12.5 μm 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1% BSA for 15 min. Unbound label was removed by washing in the same buffer. Labeled cells were added to the well in the presence and absence of inhibitors and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Unbound cells were removed by washing, and bound cells were lysed by the addition of 0.5% Triton X-100. A standard curve was prepared using known concentrations of labeled cells. Plates were read using a Cytofluor 2350 fluorescence plate reader (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with a 485-nm excitation filter and a 530-nm emission filter. Subsequent adhesion assays were performed in San Francisco and Hiroshima using unlabeled cells. For these assays, wells of non-tissue culture-treated polystyrene 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) were coated by incubation with 100 μl of VCAM-1/Ig (10 μg/ml), TNfn3RAA (1 μg/ml), or nOPNb RAA (1 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then blocked with 1% BSA in DMEM at 37 °C for 30 min. Control wells were filled with 1% BSA in DMEM. SW480 or CHO cells were detached using trypsin/EDTA and resuspended in serum-free DMEM. For blocking experiments, cells were incubated with or without 10 μg/ml of Y9A2 or various disintegrins or with or without peptides for 15 min at 4 °C before plating. The plates were centrifuged (top-side up) at 10 × g for 5 min before incubation for 1 h at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2. Non-adherent cells were removed by centrifugation top-side down at 48 × g for 5 min. Attached cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet, and the wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The relative number of cells in each well was evaluated after solubilization in 40 μl of 2% Triton X-100 by measuring the absorbance at 595 nm in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). All determinations were carried out in triplicate. Neutrophils were purified from human peripheral venous blood containing 20 units/ml heparin. Neutrophils were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation, followed by 3% dextran sedimentation (21Gresham H.D. Clement L.T. Lehmeyer J.E. Griffin Jr., F.M. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 868-875PubMed Google Scholar). Erythrocytes were subjected to hypotonic lysis, and remaining neutrophils were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. The isolated neutrophils were more than 95% pure and more than 95% viable as assessed by Wright-Giemsa staining and trypan blue exclusion, respectively. Transendothelial neutrophil migration was assessed as described by Cooper et al. (22Cooper D. Lindberg F.P. Gamble J.R. Brown E.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3978-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). HUVE cells were plated onto polycarbonate inserts (Transwell, Costar, Cambridge, MA; diameter, 6.5 mm; pore size, 8 μm for a 24-well plate) in serum-containing endothelial cell growth medium and allowed to grow to confluence over 72 h. 24 h before assays, upper chambers were washed twice with serum-free medium, and new medium with or without 3 ng/ml TNFα was added. Immediately prior to the addition of neutrophils, the upper chambers were washed twice with serum-free DMEM, and medium in the lower chamber was replaced with 500 μl of serum-free DMEM with or without 10 nm fMLP. Purified neutrophils were incubated with no antibody, Y9A2 (10 μg/ml), IB4 (20 μg/ml), or various disintegrins for 15 min at 4 °C, and 2 × 105 cells in 200 μl of medium were added to each upper chamber. After 3 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, non-adherent cells in the upper chamber were removed. Medium including migrated neutrophils from the lower chamber was collected, the lower chamber was rinsed several times to collect all of the neutrophils that had transmigrated, and the absence of additional adherent neutrophils was confirmed microscopically. The medium and all washes were pooled and resuspended, and cells were counted with a hemocytometer. All determinations were carried out in duplicate and repeated at least twice. Results were analyzed for statistical significance with an analysis of variance followed by the Fisher exact test. We have previously described a heterodimeric disintegrin, EC3, that specifically inhibited α4 integrins, with much less effect on β3 integrins or the integrin α5β1, which recognize RGD-containing ligands. In contrast to most of the previously described disintegrins, each chain of EC3 contained a novel sequence in the hairpin loop known to interact with integrins. In one loop the usual RGD (or KGD) sequence was replaced with VGD, and in the other loop RGD (or KGD) was replaced with the even more divergent sequence MLD. As part of an ongoing effort to improve the design of integrin inhibitors based on sequences in naturally occurring snake venom disintegrins, we identified and purified a novel heterodimeric disintegrin, EC6, from the venom of E. carinatus. Purification was performed from crude venom as described previously (19McLane M.A. Kowalska M.A. Silver L. Shattil S. Niewiarowski S. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a Vydac C-18 column and an acetonitrile gradient. EC6 eluted as a single peak at an acetonitrile concentration of 60% (Fig. 1). After reduction and ethylpyridylation, EC6 yielded two fractions that we called EC6A and EC6B (based on the elution pattern of reduced and alkylated subunits). By mass spectrometry we determined that the molecular mass of EC6 was 14,807 ± 2 Da, composed of subunits EC6A (8524 Da) and EC6B (8411 Da), each containing 10 ethylpyridylated cysteine residues. By SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, purified EC6 ran as a single band, and the apparent molecular mass was reduced by ∼50% upon reduction, consistent with a disulfide-linked dimer (Fig. 2 A). Peptide sequencing after CNBr degradation and proteolytic digestions allowed us to determine the complete amino acid sequence of each subunit, as shown in Fig. 2 B. Alignment of the sequences of EC6A and EC6B with the previously described heterodimeric disintegrins EC3 and EMF10 and with the monomeric disintegrins echistatin, eristostatin, kistrin, and flavoridin is shown in Fig. 3. It is apparent that there is considerable homology among all of these disintegrins, including alignment of all 10 conserved cysteine residues in each subunit of each heterodimeric disintegrin (Fig. 3). However, like EC3B, EC6A contains an MLDG (instead of RGDX) motif in the putative hairpin loop region. In contrast to EC3, the other subunit of EC6 contains a typical RGD sequence.Figure 3Alignment of amino acid sequences of echistatin, eristostatin, kistrin (32Gould R.J. Polokoff M.A. Friedman P.A.

Conserved cysteine residues are enclosed in boxes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the MLDG motif was the critical disintegrin motif involved in inhibition of α4β1-mediated adhesion to VCAM-1, we performed adhesion assays with Jurkat cells, which express α4β1 but not α4β7. We compared the ability of EC3 and EC6, each of which contain a subunit expressing the MLDG motif, to five other disintegrins that lack this motif. In parallel, we evaluated the effects of each of these disintegrins on the adhesion of K562 cells to fibronectin (mediated through an RGD site by the integrin α5β1) and of αIIbβ3-transfected CHO cells to fibrinogen (an effect that has previously been shown to be inhibited specifically by the disintegrin eristostatin). As we have previously reported (12Brando C. Marcinkiewicz C. Goldman B. McLane M.A. Niewiarowski S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), EC3 potently inhibited the α4β1-mediated adhesion but was considerably less potent in inhibiting adhesion mediated by αIIbβ3 or α5β1 (Fig.4). With the exception of eristostatin, the RGD-containing disintegrins preferentially inhibited α5β1-mediated adhesion, with no effect on adhesion mediated by α4β1. However, EC6 inhibited adhesion mediated by α4β1 as well as α5β1. These results suggest that the MLDG motif, uniquely shared by EC3 and EC6, is critical for inhibition of α4β1-mediated adhesion to VCAM-1. The potent inhibition of α5β1-mediated adhesion by EC6 is probably due to the presence of a typical RGD sequence in the EC6B subunit. Because α9β1 is the only integrin other than α4 integrins that has been reported to recognize VCAM-1 as a ligand, we next sought to determine whether α9β1 would bind to EC3 and/or EC6. As a first step, adhesion assays were performed to examine the attachment of α9- or mock-transfected SW480 colon carcinoma cells to immobilized EC3 or EC6 or to immobilized antibodies to α9β1 or α5β1 integrins (Fig.5). We also examined attachment to immobilized antibody against the integrin β1 subunit (as a positive control) and the integrin β7 subunit (as a negative control). As expected, both cell lines attached to antibodies to α5β1, because this integrin is highly expressed on SW480 cells, but only the α9 transfectants attached to antibody to α9β1. α9-transfected cells, but not mock-transfected cells, attached to immobilized EC3, an effect that was completely blocked by antibody to α9β1 or antibody to β1 but unaffected by antibody to α5 (data not shown). Both cell types attached to immobilized EC6, consistent with the potent effect of EC6 in inhibiting α5β1-mediated cell adhesion, and both cell types attached to EMF10, another potent antagonist of α5β1. Similar results were obtained when disintegrin binding was assessed by flow cytometry using the ligand binding-dependent epitope on the integrin β1 subunit recognized by monoclonal antibody 15/7. Incubation with EC3 only induced 15/7 binding in α9-transfected cells, whereas EC6 induced expression in both mock and α9 transfectants (Fig. 6). These data are consistent with binding of EC3 preferentially to α9β1. Because SW480 cells also expresss α5β1, which is potently inhibited by EC6, we could not evaluate interaction of EC6 with α9β1 by these assays. We initially screened a range of concentrations of monomeric and dimeric disintegrins for their ability to inhibit the adhesion of α9-transfected SW480 cells to immobilized VCAM-1. Only EC6 and EC3 potently inhibited adhesion, with IC50 values of approximately 30 nm (Fig.7). To confirm that these effects were not cell type-specific and to confirm that the inhibitory effect observed was due to the inhibition of α9β1-mediated adhesion, we also examined the effects of EC3, EC6, and the control disintegrin echistatin on adhesion of mock- or α9-transfected CHO cells to VCAM-1. Both EC3 and EC6, but not echistatin, potently inhibited adhesion of α9-transfected CHO cells, whereas the minimal adhesion of mock-transfected cells was unaffected by any disintegrin (Fig.8).Figure 8Effects of various concentrations of disintegrins on the adhesion of α9- and mock-transfected CHO cells to VCAM-1. A, α9- or mock-transfected CHO cells incubated with or without echistatin (30 nm), EC3 (30 nm), and EC6 (30 nm) were added to 96-well plates coated with VCAM-1/Ig (10 μg/ml).

Certain pathogenic bacteria have evolved exotoxins that severely alter the internal cAMP levels of infected cells. These exotoxins work through two common mechanisms. The first is to ADP-ribosylate the α-subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins.1 Cholera and pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylate Gs and Gi, respectively. In doing so the toxins increase the activity of endogenous adenylyl cyclases to pathogenic levels (1Domenighini M. Pizza M. Rappuoli R. Moss J. Iglewski B. Vaughan M. Tu A.T. Handbook of Natural Toxins-Bacterial Toxins and Virulence Factors in Disease. 8. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, Basel, Hong Kong1995: 59-80Google Scholar). The second strategy is to secrete an adenylyl cyclase directly into the host. This strategy is employed by Bordetella pertussis, Bacillus anthracis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To overcome the problem of unregulated cAMP production within the pathogen, these cyclases have evolved to become active only upon binding a factor endogenous to the host (2Hanna P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 225: 13-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mock M. Ullmann A. Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclases from B. pertussis and B. anthracis are activated by calmodulin (CaM). The exotoxin from P. aeruginosa is activated by an unknown, soluble cellular factor (4Yahr T.L. Vallis A.J. Hancock M.K. Barbieri J.T. Frank D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13899-13904Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The adenylyl cyclase from B. anthracis, also known as edema factor, is secreted as an inactive enzyme by bacterial cells and associates with protective antigen, another B. anthracis exotoxin. Protective antigen is a pH-dependent protein transporter that upon proteolytic activation, endocytosis, and pH change, translocates edema factor into the cytoplasm of the target cells (5Petosa C. Collier R.J. Klimpel K.R. Leppla S.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 385: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). After gaining access to the cytoplasm, edema factor binds CaM at the resting calcium concentration and is thus activated to produce unregulated levels of cAMP within the cytosol (6Leppla S.H. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1984; 17: 189-198PubMed Google Scholar, 7Leppla S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3162-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). The rate of ATP conversion to cAMP by edema factor is two to three orders of magnitude greater than membrane-bound eukaryotic adenylyl cyclases (8Labruyẽre E. Mock M. Ladant D. Michelson S. Gilles A.M. Laoide B. Barzu O. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4922-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 9Tang W.J. Krupinski J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8595-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This catalytic activity is thought to be involved in both cutaneous and systemic anthrax infection (10Leppla S.H. Moss J. Iglewski B. Vaughan M. Tu A.T. Bacterial Toxins and Virulence Factors in Disease. Mercel Dekker, Inc., New York, Basel, Hong Kong1995: 543-572Google Scholar). In the course of anthrax pathogenesis, edema factor works in concert with another enzyme exotoxin, lethal factor. Lethal factor has been shown to proteolytically inactivate ERK kinase (MAP-kinase kinase) (11Duesbery N.S. Webb C.P. Leppla S.H. Gordon V.M. Klimpel K.R. Copeland T.D. Ahn N.G. Oskarsson M.K. Fukasawa K. Paull K.D. Vande Woude G.F. Science. 1998; 280: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). The adenylyl cyclase from B. anthracis is a 92.5-kDa soluble protein and can be divided into N- and C-terminal functional domains (10Leppla S.H. Moss J. Iglewski B. Vaughan M. Tu A.T. Bacterial Toxins and Virulence Factors in Disease. Mercel Dekker, Inc., New York, Basel, Hong Kong1995: 543-572Google Scholar). The N-terminal 30-kDa domain bears strong homology to the N-terminal domain of lethal factor and is centrally involved in edema factor association with protective antigen and entrance into host cells. The C-terminal 60-kDa domain consists of CaM-sensitive adenylyl cyclase activity. The N-terminal portion of this 60-kDa region is similar to the adenylyl cyclase exotoxins from B. pertussisand P. aeruginosa, with 34 and 29% sequence identity, respectively. However, this region has no significant similarity to the adenylyl cyclases from enterobacteria and eukaryotes. In contrast to mammalian adenylyl cyclases that contain a catalytic core composed of two homologous domains, edema factor and its related exotoxins have no internal sequence repeat and are active as monomers (12Tang W.-J. Hurley J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). CaM, a 16.5-kDa soluble protein, is a four-site member of the EF-hand family of Ca2+-binding proteins (13Kretsinger R.H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). CaM is present in all eukaryotic cells, and it binds to and modulates, in a Ca2+-dependent manner, a number of enzymes including myosin light chain kinase, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, calcineurin, phosphorylase kinase, and adenylyl cyclase (14Means A.R. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1988; 44: 223-262PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular structures of Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free CaM have been determined by x-ray crystallography and NMR, respectively (15Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 16Babu Y.S. Sack J.S. Greenhough T.J. Bugg C.E. Means A.R. Cook W.J.

There are two globular domains in CaM, each containing two Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs. The two globular domains are connected by a continuous single α-helix that gives CaM its characteristic dumbbell shape. Binding of calcium ions has been shown to induce the movement of a pair of helices in a two EF-hand domain. This leads to an opening of the domain and an exposure of a hydrophobic pocket, which becomes a target interaction site. Blocking this opening by introducing a disulfide bond in either domain reversibly inactivates CaM (20Tan R.Y. Mabuchi Y. Grabarek Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7479-7483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). CaM binding sites have been identified in a number of enzymes. With a few exceptions they are amphipathic helices capable of interacting with both domains of CaM in a 1:1 complex. The structures of the Ca2+/CaM complexes with the CaM-binding domain of MLCK and CaM-dependent kinase type II have been solved (21Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 22Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A.

In both structures, the two globular domains of CaM (residues 6–73 and 83–146) remain essentially unchanged upon complex formation. However, the long central helix (residues 65–93) of CaM, which connects the two domains in the crystal structure of calcium-bound CaM, is disrupted. This enables the C- and N-terminal domains to clamp the helical peptide, bringing the two domains of CaM close to each other. In this study, we use biochemical, genetic, and spectroscopic methods to analyze the regulation of edema factor by CaM and gain insight into its catalytic mechanism. Our results show that whereas the mode of activation for edema factor is distinctly different from that seen in mammalian adenylyl cyclases, these two classes of enzymes are likely to share a common catalytic mechanism. The gene encoding edema factor was kindly provided by Dr. S. Leppla (NIDR, National Institutes of Health). Restriction enzymes and Vent DNA polymerase were from New England BioLabs; QuikChange kit and XL-1 red competent cells were from Stratagene; Bradford reagent was from Bio-Rad; Ni2+-NTA resin and anti-H5 antisera were from Qiagen.N-iodoacetyl-N′-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine (1,5-IAEDANS) andN-(dimethylamino-3,5-dinitrophenyl)-maleimide (DAB)-mal probes were from Molecular Probes. To construct the plasmid for the expression of EF-cya62 (aa 262–800) and EF3 (aa 291–800) (pProExH6-EF-cya62 and pProExH6-EF3, respectively), restriction siteNotI was first introduced to the appropriate codons by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange kit, Stratagene). The resulting plasmid was then digested with NotI and KpnI, and the fragment that encoded EF-cya62 or EF3 was isolated and ligated to pProEx-H6, which was digested with the same enzymes to express a recombinant edema factor, hexahistidine-tagged at its N terminus. A similar strategy was employed to generate pProEx-CH6-EF3 that had a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. The plasmid for the expression of EF3-N (aa 291–640) was generated by introducing a termination codon at residue 641 using pProExH6-cya62 as a template. The plasmid for the expression of EF3-C (aa 641–800) was made by first introducing aNotI site at the codons for aa 638–640 of pProExCH6-EF3 and subsequent removal of the fragment for the coding region (aa 291 to 640). To express the truncated forms of edema factor, the appropriate plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells that harbored pUBS520, a plasmid that encodes tRNA for the AGA and AGG codons. The resulting cells were grown in a modified T7 medium with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin at 25–30 °C toA 600 = 0.4, induced by adding isopropyl-1-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 100 μm and harvested 12–19-h postinduction. All the subsequent procedures were performed in a 4 °C cold room. E. coli cells were lysed in T20β5P0.1 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C; 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol; 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with added lysozyme to 0.1 mg/ml final concentration and a 4-min sonication with a 1-s on and 3-s off cycle. The supernatant of E. coli lysate was applied directly onto a Ni2+-NTA column that was equilibrated with T20β5P0.1N100(T20β5P0.1 containing 100 mm NaCl). The Ni2+-NTA column was washed with T20β5P0.1N500 and then T20β5P0.1N100I20(T20β5P0.1N100containing 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0. The column was then eluted with the high imidazole buffer, T20β5P0.1N100I150. The eluate was diluted 5-fold with M20E1D1P0.1 (30 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and applied to an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC SP-Sepharose column that had been equilibrated with M20E1D1P0.1, pH 6.5. The column was washed with one-column volume of M20E1D1P0.1, pH 6.5, and absorbed protein was eluted at 2 ml/min with a linear NaCl gradient (500–550 mm, 350–400 mm, and 450–500 mm NaCl for purification of EF3, EF3-N, and EF3-C, respectively) in M20E1D1P0.1. The protein peaks of edema factor fragments were analysed for molecular size on SDS-PAGE and for EF3 by adenylyl cyclase activity. Purified EF3, EF3-N, and EF3-C were concentrated in a Centricon 10 microconcentrator (Amicon) and stored at −80 °C (protein concentration >5 mg/ml). An alternative scheme was also used to purify EF3 based on the fact that little binding of EF3 to a DEAE column at pH 7.0 was observed. In this case, E. coli cells were lysed in M30E4N25P0.1, pH 7.0, as described above. Lysate was passed first through a DEAE column and then directly onto an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC SP-Sepharose column, and columns were washed with three volumes of M30E4P0.1, pH 7.0. EF3 protein was then eluted off with a NaCl gradient in M30P0.1as the major protein peak and identified by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing EF3 were pooled and loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA column. The Ni2+-NTA column was washed with T20β5P0.1N100I20and eluted with T20β5P0.1N100I150. Purified EF3 protein was concentrated as described above. This procedure modestly increased purification of the protein. Purified EF3 and CaM were exchanged into digest solution (10% glycerol, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2) by dialysis and two protein stock solutions were prepared for digestion. One contained only EF3, the other a 1:2 molar mixture of EF3 and CaM. The concentration of EF3 (0.5 mg/ml) was identical in both samples. Nine different protease stock solutions were prepared in the same digest solution. Digests with thermolysin, endoproteinase Lys-C, endoproteinase Glu-C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), elastase, chymotrypsin, trypsin, protease type X, endoproteinase Arg-C (Sigma) and thrombin (heme Tech) were performed at two different protease concentrations, one 10-fold more dilute that the other. The protease concentrations were 1:100 and 1:1000 (w/w) for all proteases except for endoproteinase Lys-C, which was used at 0.03 and 0.003 units of protease/mg of protein. All digestions were held at 4 °C. Samples were taken after 10 min and 1, 4, and 14 h. All samples were transferred directly from the digestion mixture into hot SDS loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Activity was assayed for 5–20 min at 30 °C in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 (9Tang W.J. Krupinski J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8595-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length human and fruit fly CaM was expressed in bacteria and purified using a previously published protocol and yielded ∼5–10 mg of purified protein per liter of culture (25Maune J.F. Klee C.B.

When applicable, recombinant EF3 was premixed with CaM on ice for 5 min before the assay, and assays were done in the presence of 50 μmCaCl2. This screen is based on the observation that overexpression of EF3 and CaM significantly reduces the viability of E. coli. The coding region encoding fruit fly CaM was generated by polymerase chain reaction using Vent DNA polymerase and cloned into pBB131, resulting in pBB131-dCaM. A library of plasmids that had mutations in the coding region of EF3 were constructed by propagating plasmid pProExH6-EF3 inE. coli mutator strain, XL-1 red (mutD5, mutS, mutT). Plasmid DNAs were isolated and transformed to E. coli Δcya strain, TP2000 that harbored pBB131-dCaM[TP2000(dCaM)]. The transformants were plated directly onto Luria broth plate containing 100 μmisopropyl-1-thiogalactopyranoside, 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and 25 μg/ml kanamycin). Plasmid DNAs from the resulting colonies were isolated and retransformed into TP2000(dCaM) to confirm the viability. The coding region of EF3 was then sequenced. Steady-state fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a SPEX Fluorolog 2/2/2 photon-counting spectrofluorometer (Edison, NJ). Fluorescence lifetime measurements were carried out by the method of time-correlated single photon-counting on a modified ORTEC 9200 nanosecond fluorometer (27Fairclough R.H. Cantor C.R.

Our approach began with modifications of the edema factor gene that replaced the binding region of protective antigen with a hexahistidine tag at the N terminus. The expression of the truncated protein was monitored both by adenylyl cyclase assay and by immunoblot with anti-H5 antisera. We first constructed and analyzed the truncation mutant, EF-cya62 (aa 262–800) as previously reported (8Labruyẽre E. Mock M. Ladant D. Michelson S. Gilles A.M. Laoide B. Barzu O. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4922-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As expected, it had high adenylyl cyclase activity when stimulated by Ca2+/CaM. A progressive deletion of residues from the N and C termini of EF-cya62 was performed to search for an optimal construct for the expression of the functional, CaM-sensitive adenylyl cyclase. Deletion of 290 amino acids from the N terminus significantly improved the expression of a functional protein, and the product could be clearly visualized after the whole-cell lysate was run on a gel under the optimum induction conditions (100 μmisopropyl-1-thiogalactopyranoside over 12 h in enriched media at 25–30 °C). This construct is designated “EF3” (aa 291–800). Further deletion from either the N- or C-terminal end progressively reduced both protein expression and catalytic activity. EF3 can be effectively purified using Ni2+-NTA and SP-Sepharose, resulting in greater than 95% pure protein as judged by SDS-PAGE. This preparation yields approximately 42 mg/liter E. coli culture, roughly 10-fold better than that from cells expressing EF-cya62. The enzyme activity of EF3 is similar to that of EF-cya62. Both exhibit relatively low activity without CaM (0.5–1 μmol/mg/min) and can be stimulated by CaM by about 1000-fold. Because of its relatively basic pI (8.9), EF3 does not bind to the DEAE column at pH 7.0. Injecting the cell lysate through the DEAE column and then purifying it on SP-Sepharose and Ni2+-NTA columns, produced a slightly purer EF3 (∼97% pure) preparation. A C-terminal-tagged EF3 was also constructed and purified. Its yield was lower, 12 mg/liter culture, though the proteolytic contamination was mildly reduced. We analyzed the molecular weight of native EF3 by Superdex 200 gel permeation column and found that EF3 migrated as a 60-kDa protein. This is consistent with the notion that EF3 is a monomer. We have probed the structural stability of EF3 with digestion by nine different proteases (thermolysin, endoproteinase Lys-C, elastase, chymotrypsin, trypsin, protease type X, endoproteinase Glu-C, endoproteinase Arg-C, and thrombin) in the presence or absence of Ca2+/CaM. The first six of these proteases showed a very similar digestion pattern (Fig. 1). In the presence of CaM (Fig. 1, bottom), little digestion of EF3 was observed. In the absence of CaM (Fig. 1, top), all six enzymes digested EF3 producing a 43-kDa fragment. Using N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry we found that the most stable proteolytic fragment (that generated by endoproteinase Lys-C) is a product of C-terminal truncation of 160 amino acids. These results suggest that the N-terminal 43-kDa fragment of EF3 constitutes an independent structural domain and that the 160-residue C-terminal of EF3 is structurally disordered in the absence of CaM. To address the question of whether the catalytic domain of edema factor can indeed be further divided into two subdomains, we constructed and purified EF3-N (aa 291–640) and EF3-C (aa 641–800) (Fig.2 A). The 43-kDa EF3-N was expressed and purified with a yield of 2 mg/liter. It had only one-tenth of the basal activity of the EF3 fragment and was only modestly activated by CaM (about 10–30-fold compared with more than 1000-fold stimulation for the EF3 fragment, Fig. 2 B). The 19-kDa EF3-C fragment was also expressed and purified with a yield of only 0.5 mg/liter and a minor contamination of a 25-kDa protein (Fig.2 A). By itself, EF3-C had no detectable catalytic activity (data not shown); however, with addition to EF3-N, EF3-C fully restored the CaM activation of EF3-N (Fig. 2 B). Taken together with the proteolysis data, these results indicate that the 43-kDa EF3-N fragment indeed comprises the catalytic core of the edema factor. This domain appears to be structurally independent and capable of being regulated by Ca2+/CaM. It appears that the C-terminal 160-residue long EF3-C fragment has little structure on its own, but greatly enhances the Ca2+/CaM-dependent activation of EF3-N. In the presence of Ca2+/CaM, both segments of EF3 form a structurally stable catalytic-active entity. We further infer from these data that both EF3-N and EF3-C contain CaM binding sites. To determine the conformation of CaM in the complex with EF3, we employed a fluorescence energy transfer technique. With CaM34/110, a two-cysteine CaM mutant in which Cys residues had been substituted for Thr-34 and Thr-110 in the N- and C-terminal domain, respectively.2 The Cα atoms of Thr-34 and Thr-110 are 54 Å apart in the crystal structure of Ca2+-bound CaM and ∼16 Å apart in CaM complexes with the synthetic peptides corresponding to the CaM-binding sites of myosin light chain kinase (M13) and CaM-kinase II. Thus, when labeled with a resonance energy transfer pair of probes, CaM34/110 is an extremely sensitive indicator of the global conformation of CaM.2 CaM34/110 was randomly labeled with 1,5-IAEDANS as a donor and DAB as an acceptor. For the control experiments, the protein was labeled with the donor alone. The fluorescence signal and the lifetime of IAEDANS alone attached to CaM34/110 are virtually insensitive to Ca2+ and to the addition of EF3 or M13 (Figs. 3 and 4), indicating that the immediate environment of the probes attached to CaM34/110 is not affected. Addition of Ca2+ to CaM34/110-IAEDANS/DAB causes a small decrease in fluorescence, which apparently reflects an increased dynamic of CaM and consequently a decrease in the average distance between the two domains of CaM in solution. An addition of M13 causes a large decrease in fluorescence intensity and a decrease in the lifetime to 3 ns, consistent with the compact conformation of the CaM·M13 complex (Fig. 3).2 In contrast to the M13 peptide, EF3 did not cause any decrease in fluorescence of CaM34/110-AEDANS, DAB. On the contrary, an addition of EF3 causes a reversal of the Ca2+ effect, and the fluorescence intensity of the complex exceeds that of CaM34/110-AEDANS, DAB alone in the absence of Ca2+ (Figs. 3 and 4). Because the CaM34/110 labeled only with the donor showed little change in fluorescence upon EF3 binding, we conclude that the change observed for the donor/acceptor-labeled CaM34/110 results from an increase in the distance between the N- and C-terminal domains of CaM upon interaction with EF3. The fluorescence decay of CaM34/110-AEDANS, DAB in the presence of CaCl2 could be fitted with two lifetimes (τ1 = 10.8 ns and τ2 = 6.9 ns) with relative contributions of 0.63 and 0.34, respectively, consistent with the dynamic nature of CaM in solution.2 In contrast, the fluorescence decay of EF3 complexes with singly and doubly labeled CaM34/110 were strictly monoexponential with lifetimes of 12.9 ns and 10.3 ns, respectively (Fig. 4). The distance between the probes calculated from these values assuming the orientation factor κ2 = 2/3 was 49.6 Å. We conclude that CaM adopts an extended conformation in its complex with EF3, approximately similar to the conformation in the crystal structure of the Ca2+-bound free CaM.Figure 4Effect of EF3 on the fluorescence emission decay of CaM34/110 labeled with AEDANS and AEDANS, DAB. Fluorescence decay is shown for the EF3 complex with CaM34/110 labeled with AEDANS only (dots) and AEDANS, DAB (solid line), as well as for CaM34/110-AEDANS, DAB in the absence of EF3 (dashed line). The measurements were performed in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Protein concentrations were 1 and 2 μm for CaM34/110 and EF3, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have utilized the change in fluorescence signal of CaM34/110, AEDANS, DAB upon binding EF3 to estimate the apparent equilibrium binding constant for the complex formation. Fig.5 shows a fluorescence titration of CaM34/110, AEDANS, DAB with a concentrated solution of EF3 in the presence of Ca2+. Fitting of the data gaveK d = 2.9 × 10−8, which is in excellent agreement with the K d = 2.3 × 10−8 value obtained by Labruyẽre et al.(8) from the EC50 of the EF-cya62 fragment activation by bovine brain calmodulin. Thus, neither the mutations introduced into CaM34/110, nor the attached spectroscopic probes affect in any measurable way the interaction between CaM and edema factor.

Through the multiple alignment of all known eukaryotic glycogen synthases we have found an invariant 17-amino acid stretch enclosed within the most conserved region of the members of this family. This peptide includes an E-X 7-E motif, which is highly conserved in four families of retaining glycosyltransferases.

The acceptor in glycosidases is water, the end result being hydrolysis of the glycoconjugate. For transferases the acceptor molecule is in most cases a growing carbohydrate chain, but it can also be a protein, a lipid, or a range of other compounds such as steroids, bilirubin, flavonones, carotenoids, etc., that are modified by glycosylation (1Davies G. Sinnott M.L. Withers S.G. Sinnott M.L. Glycosyl Transfer. Academic Press, New York1998: 119-208Google Scholar). Glycosyltransferases can be further divided into two groups depending on whether they use a nucleotide phosphosugar (Leloir-type) or an oligosaccharide as the glycosyl donor. In all cases, the reaction catalyzed is a substitution at the anomeric carbon of a sugar moiety and may occur with retention or inversion of the configuration at this center. Accordingly, enzymes that catalyze glycosyltransfer can be divided into retaining or inverting enzymes.Glycogen synthase (GS)1catalyzes the key step of glycogen formation. In mammals, two major isoforms of the enzyme have been described, the muscle isoenzyme (2Browner M.F. Nakano K. Bang A.G. Fletterick R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1443-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which is expressed in several tissues (3Kaslow H.R. Lesikar D.D.

Chem. 1985; 260: 9953-9956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GS plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism and homeostasis, and its malfunction has been associated with several metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus (6Thorburn A.W. Gumbiner B. Bulacan F. Brechtel G. Henry R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 7Bak J.F. Moller N. Schmitz O. Saaek A. Pedersen O.

Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Mammalian GSs catalyze the transfer of a glucosyl moiety from UDP-α-glucose to a nascent chain of glycogen through an α1→4 linkage. The stereochemistry of the resulting glycosidic bond is the same as that of the donor sugar nucleotide, thus GS is classified as a retaining Leloir-type glycosyltransferase. The stereochemical course of the reaction, analogously to what has been found for retaining glycosidases (9Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1486) Google Scholar), determines the presence of two catalytic amino acids, which allow a double displacement mechanism. According to this model, these two essential residues must be close within the active center of the enzyme (10Koshland Jr., D.E. Biol. Rev. 1953; 28: 416-436Crossref Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 11Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Although many genes encoding glycosyltransferases have been sequenced and expressed, no structural information from x-ray crystallography or high resolution NMR spectroscopy is available for a retaining glycosyltransferase. The only structures known to date are those of the β-glucosyltransferase of T4 bacteriophage (12Vrielink A. Ruger W. Driessen H.P. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3413-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), the hypothetical nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferase SpsA from Bacillus subtilis (13Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), and the catalytic domain of the bovine β1,4-galactosyltransferase T1 (14Gastinel L.N. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3546-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, all these enzymes operate with inversion of configuration at the anomeric carbon and presumably have different active site geometry.Almost all the studies of muscle and liver GS have focused on the covalent and allosteric regulation by hormonal and metabolic stimuli (15Roach P.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 16Roach P.J. Cao Y. Corbett C.A. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Farkas I. Fiol C.J. Flotow H. Graves P.R. Hardy T.A. Hrubey T.W. Adv.

J. 1998; 336: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), and few attempts have been made to elucidate the catalytic mechanism (18Mahrenholz A.M. Wang Y.H. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10561-10567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to identify conserved regions and putative catalytic residues through the comparison of the amino acid sequences of mammalian GSs with those of other known retaining glycosyltransferases. Moreover, using site-directed mutagenesis and human muscle glycogen synthase (HMGS) as a model, we have probed the function of two conserved Glu residues in catalysis by this family of enzymes.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have combined bioinformatic and experimental techniques to identify two Glu residues at the active site of eukaryotic GSs, using HMGS as a model. We have taken advantage of the classification of glycosyltransferases into 43 families proposed by Campbell et al. (24Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 25Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), according to sequence similarity and the stereochemical course of the reaction. Through the use of BLAST searches and multiple alignments we have found an E-X 7-E motif that is highly conserved among the members of families 3, 4, 5, and 15 of glycosyltransferases, all of which operate with retention of configuration at the anomeric carbon. Hydrophobic cluster analysis and secondary structure prediction of this region supported the hypothesis that these four families are related. In eukaryotic GSs, all belonging to family 3, this motif is enclosed within an invariant 17-amino acid stretch found roughly in the last third of the corresponding coding sequences and in the region where these proteins exhibit the largest degree of similarity. This conserved core region has previously been assumed to contain the catalytic site, in contrast to the more variable N and C termini, which harbor the phosphorylation sites that regulate the enzyme activity (4Bai G. Zhang Z.J. Werner R. Nuttall F.Q. Tan A.W. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7843-7848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The functional role of Glu-510 and Glu-518 in the E-X 7-E motif of HMGS was probed by site-directed mutagenesis. The wild-type enzyme and two single point mutants, in which the conserved Glu residues were replaced by Ala, were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells as fusions to GFP. The structural integrity of the chimerical mutant proteins was shown in several ways. They were expressed to similar levels and showed the same molecular mass as the wild-type. The variant proteins retained the ability to concentrate in the nuclear compartment in the absence of glucose and translocate to the cytosol when the monosaccharide was added (26Ferrer J.C. Baque S. Guinovart J.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Finally, they were able to bind to intracellular glycogen, as the wild-type enzyme. However, the E518A mutant retained approximately 6% of the activity shown by the GFP-HMGS fusion protein, whereas the E510A had undetectable activity. This finding indicates that the catalytic mechanism of HMGS has been impaired by the mutations.Assuming that highly conserved regions in enzymes contain crucial residues for catalytic activity, the E-X 7-E motif must be involved either in substrate recognition and binding or in catalysis. However, considering the large variety of glycosyl donors (GDP-mannose, ADP- and UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, etc.) and acceptors (mono- and polysaccharides, glycolipids, glycoproteins, etc.) used by the proteins of families 3, 4, 5, and 15, only the active site would be clearly conserved in all of them. The observation that both mutant forms of GFP-HMGS bound to glycogen was also an indication that the glycogen-binding site of the enzyme was not significantly disturbed by the single point mutations. Additionally, Lys-38 of the rabbit muscle GS has been implicated in UDP-glucose binding, suggesting that this substrate binds to the N-terminal half of the enzyme (18Mahrenholz A.M. Wang Y.H. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10561-10567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore reasonable to assume that Glu-510 and Glu-518 are part of the HMGS active site machinery, and by analogy, the corresponding residues of other eukaryotic GSs play an identical role. The same may be true for the glycosyltransferases from families 4, 5, and 15 of Campbell's classification, although in these cases, experimental confirmation would be required. This type of evidence has been obtained for Ace-A (35Geremia R.A. Roux M. Ferreiro D.U. Dauphin-Dubois R. Lellouch A.C. Ielpi L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 261: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 46Petroni E.A. Ielpi L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4814-4821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an α-mannosyltransferase that belongs to family 4. Geremiaet al. (42Geremia R.A. Petroni E.A. Ielpi L. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) found an E-X 7-E motif similar to that described here in a group of prokaryotic α-mannosyltransferases and proposed that both conserved Glu residues were important for catalysis. The replacement by Ala residues of Glu-287 or Glu-295 in Ace-A (equivalent to Glu-510 and Glu-518 in HMGS, respectively) led to the same changes in enzymatic activity as those observed in HMGS. The E287A variant was inactive, whereas Ace-A (E295A) showed very little activity. 6P. Abdian, A. C. Lellouch, C. Gautier, D. U. Ferreiro, L. Ielpi, and R. A. Geremia, submitted for publication.Very recently, Nichols et al. (37Nichols D.J. Keeling P.L. Spalding M. Guan H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7820-7825Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have shown that Glu-391 of maize starch synthase IIb-2, a glycosyltransferase from family 5, is essential for activity. According to our alignments, this residue corresponds to the indispensable Glu-510 in HMGS.Enzymatic reactions that involve the substitution of a group at an asymmetric carbon atom and yield a product with the same configuration as the substrate generally operate by two successive displacements on the asymmetric carbon (10Koshland Jr., D.E. Biol. Rev. 1953; 28: 416-436Crossref Scopus (799) Google Scholar). In retaining glycosidases, the first step involves the formation of an inverted substrate-enzyme intermediate through the coordinated attack of a nucleophile at the sugar anomeric center and the protonation of the glycosidic oxygen by a residue acting as a general acid catalyst. In the second step, the latter provides general base catalytic assistance and deprotonates a water molecule, which in turn attacks the anomeric carbon once again, thus yielding the final product. Through site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analysis of the mutants, the catalytic residues of several retaining glycosidases, always Asp or Glu residues, have been identified and their respective roles assigned (39Ly H.D. Withers S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 487-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Mutant enzymes in which the nucleophile has been replaced by an Ala residue are essentially inactive. When the acid/base catalytic residue is eliminated, the resulting protein retains some activity with very good substrates,i.e. those bearing good leaving groups. In this situation, protonation of the leaving group is not crucial for catalysis (39Ly H.D. Withers S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 487-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).Kapitonov and Yu described a domain (NRD1α), present in several members of the glycosyltransferases of family 4 different from the α-mannosyltransferases analyzed by Geremia et al. (42Geremia R.A. Petroni E.A. Ielpi L. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which also contained an E-X 7-E segment. The authors arbitrarily proposed, by analogy with the mechanism of retaining glycosidases, that the first conserved Glu residue was be the general acid/base catalyst, while the second one acted as the nucleophile (43Kapitonov D. Yu R.K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 961-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, these assumptions were not supported experimentally.Our results argue against the roles assigned to the two conserved Glu residues by Kapitonov and Yu. First, the sequence comparisons with selected glycosyltransferases show that, although the first Glu residue of the motif is invariant, the second Glu is more variable and therefore better fits the secondary role of the acid/base catalyst. It has to be noted that, in all the enzymes analyzed in this study, the second residue is always an amino acid whose lateral chain can putatively act as a proton donor/acceptor. Second, the E510A mutation in HMGS completely inactivates the enzyme, whereas the E518A mutant maintains some residual activity. The glycosyl donor in the synthesis of glycogen is UDP-glucose. The chemical nature of UDP dictates that this moiety can act as a good leaving group even when it is not protonated and thus the glycogenic reaction might still proceed at a measurable rate in the absence of an acid catalyst. Our results are consistent with Glu-510 being the fundamental nucleophile and with Glu-518 providing important but not essential catalytic assistance, possibly as the general acid/base catalyst. Further experiments are in progress to determine the exact roles of both conserved Glu residues of the E-X 7-E motif in the catalysis by GS. Glycosyltransferases and glycosidases catalyze the transfer of glycosyl residues from a donor sugar to an acceptor. The acceptor in glycosidases is water, the end result being hydrolysis of the glycoconjugate. For transferases the acceptor molecule is in most cases a growing carbohydrate chain, but it can also be a protein, a lipid, or a range of other compounds such as steroids, bilirubin, flavonones, carotenoids, etc., that are modified by glycosylation (1Davies G.

The stereochemistry of the resulting glycosidic bond is the same as that of the donor sugar nucleotide, thus GS is classified as a retaining Leloir-type glycosyltransferase. The stereochemical course of the reaction, analogously to what has been found for retaining glycosidases (9Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1486) Google Scholar), determines the presence of two catalytic amino acids, which allow a double displacement mechanism. According to this model, these two essential residues must be close within the active center of the enzyme (10Koshland Jr., D.E. Biol. Rev. 1953; 28: 416-436Crossref Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 11Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although many genes encoding glycosyltransferases have been sequenced and expressed, no structural information from x-ray crystallography or high resolution NMR spectroscopy is available for a retaining glycosyltransferase. The only structures known to date are those of the β-glucosyltransferase of T4 bacteriophage (12Vrielink A. Ruger W. Driessen H.P. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3413-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), the hypothetical nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferase SpsA from Bacillus subtilis (13Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), and the catalytic domain of the bovine β1,4-galactosyltransferase T1 (14Gastinel L.N. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3546-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, all these enzymes operate with inversion of configuration at the anomeric carbon and presumably have different active site geometry. Almost all the studies of muscle and liver GS have focused on the covalent and allosteric regulation by hormonal and metabolic stimuli (15Roach P.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 16Roach P.J. Cao Y. Corbett C.A. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Farkas I. Fiol C.J. Flotow H. Graves P.R. Hardy T.A. Hrubey T.W. Adv.

J. 1998; 336: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), and few attempts have been made to elucidate the catalytic mechanism (18Mahrenholz A.M. Wang Y.H. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10561-10567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to identify conserved regions and putative catalytic residues through the comparison of the amino acid sequences of mammalian GSs with those of other known retaining glycosyltransferases. Moreover, using site-directed mutagenesis and human muscle glycogen synthase (HMGS) as a model, we have probed the function of two conserved Glu residues in catalysis by this family of enzymes. DISCUSSIONIn this study we have combined bioinformatic and experimental techniques to identify two Glu residues at the active site of eukaryotic GSs, using HMGS as a model. We have taken advantage of the classification of glycosyltransferases into 43 families proposed by Campbell et al. (24Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 25Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), according to sequence similarity and the stereochemical course of the reaction. Through the use of BLAST searches and multiple alignments we have found an E-X 7-E motif that is highly conserved among the members of families 3, 4, 5, and 15 of glycosyltransferases, all of which operate with retention of configuration at the anomeric carbon. Hydrophobic cluster analysis and secondary structure prediction of this region supported the hypothesis that these four families are related. In eukaryotic GSs, all belonging to family 3, this motif is enclosed within an invariant 17-amino acid stretch found roughly in the last third of the corresponding coding sequences and in the region where these proteins exhibit the largest degree of similarity. This conserved core region has previously been assumed to contain the catalytic site, in contrast to the more variable N and C termini, which harbor the phosphorylation sites that regulate the enzyme activity (4Bai G. Zhang Z.J. Werner R. Nuttall F.Q. Tan A.W. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7843-7848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The functional role of Glu-510 and Glu-518 in the E-X 7-E motif of HMGS was probed by site-directed mutagenesis. The wild-type enzyme and two single point mutants, in which the conserved Glu residues were replaced by Ala, were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells as fusions to GFP. The structural integrity of the chimerical mutant proteins was shown in several ways. They were expressed to similar levels and showed the same molecular mass as the wild-type. The variant proteins retained the ability to concentrate in the nuclear compartment in the absence of glucose and translocate to the cytosol when the monosaccharide was added (26Ferrer J.C. Baque S. Guinovart J.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Finally, they were able to bind to intracellular glycogen, as the wild-type enzyme. However, the E518A mutant retained approximately 6% of the activity shown by the GFP-HMGS fusion protein, whereas the E510A had undetectable activity. This finding indicates that the catalytic mechanism of HMGS has been impaired by the mutations.Assuming that highly conserved regions in enzymes contain crucial residues for catalytic activity, the E-X 7-E motif must be involved either in substrate recognition and binding or in catalysis. However, considering the large variety of glycosyl donors (GDP-mannose, ADP- and UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, etc.) and acceptors (mono- and polysaccharides, glycolipids, glycoproteins, etc.) used by the proteins of families 3, 4, 5, and 15, only the active site would be clearly conserved in all of them. The observation that both mutant forms of GFP-HMGS bound to glycogen was also an indication that the glycogen-binding site of the enzyme was not significantly disturbed by the single point mutations. Additionally, Lys-38 of the rabbit muscle GS has been implicated in UDP-glucose binding, suggesting that this substrate binds to the N-terminal half of the enzyme (18Mahrenholz A.M. Wang Y.H. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10561-10567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore reasonable to assume that Glu-510 and Glu-518 are part of the HMGS active site machinery, and by analogy, the corresponding residues of other eukaryotic GSs play an identical role. The same may be true for the glycosyltransferases from families 4, 5, and 15 of Campbell's classification, although in these cases, experimental confirmation would be required. This type of evidence has been obtained for Ace-A (35Geremia R.A. Roux M. Ferreiro D.U. Dauphin-Dubois R. Lellouch A.C. Ielpi L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 261: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 46Petroni E.A. Ielpi L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4814-4821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an α-mannosyltransferase that belongs to family 4. Geremiaet al. (42Geremia R.A. Petroni E.A. Ielpi L. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) found an E-X 7-E motif similar to that described here in a group of prokaryotic α-mannosyltransferases and proposed that both conserved Glu residues were important for catalysis. The replacement by Ala residues of Glu-287 or Glu-295 in Ace-A (equivalent to Glu-510 and Glu-518 in HMGS, respectively) led to the same changes in enzymatic activity as those observed in HMGS. The E287A variant was inactive, whereas Ace-A (E295A) showed very little activity. 6P. Abdian, A. C. Lellouch, C. Gautier, D. U. Ferreiro, L. Ielpi, and R. A. Geremia, submitted for publication.Very recently, Nichols et al. (37Nichols D.J. Keeling P.L. Spalding M. Guan H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7820-7825Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have shown that Glu-391 of maize starch synthase IIb-2, a glycosyltransferase from family 5, is essential for activity. According to our alignments, this residue corresponds to the indispensable Glu-510 in HMGS.Enzymatic reactions that involve the substitution of a group at an asymmetric carbon atom and yield a product with the same configuration as the substrate generally operate by two successive displacements on the asymmetric carbon (10Koshland Jr., D.E. Biol. Rev. 1953; 28: 416-436Crossref Scopus (799) Google Scholar). In retaining glycosidases, the first step involves the formation of an inverted substrate-enzyme intermediate through the coordinated attack of a nucleophile at the sugar anomeric center and the protonation of the glycosidic oxygen by a residue acting as a general acid catalyst. In the second step, the latter provides general base catalytic assistance and deprotonates a water molecule, which in turn attacks the anomeric carbon once again, thus yielding the final product. Through site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analysis of the mutants, the catalytic residues of several retaining glycosidases, always Asp or Glu residues, have been identified and their respective roles assigned (39Ly H.D. Withers S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 487-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Mutant enzymes in which the nucleophile has been replaced by an Ala residue are essentially inactive. When the acid/base catalytic residue is eliminated, the resulting protein retains some activity with very good substrates,i.e. those bearing good leaving groups. In this situation, protonation of the leaving group is not crucial for catalysis (39Ly H.D. Withers S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 487-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).Kapitonov and Yu described a domain (NRD1α), present in several members of the glycosyltransferases of family 4 different from the α-mannosyltransferases analyzed by Geremia et al. (42Geremia R.A. Petroni E.A. Ielpi L. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which also contained an E-X 7-E segment. The authors arbitrarily proposed, by analogy with the mechanism of retaining glycosidases, that the first conserved Glu residue was be the general acid/base catalyst, while the second one acted as the nucleophile (43Kapitonov D. Yu R.K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 961-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, these assumptions were not supported experimentally.Our results argue against the roles assigned to the two conserved Glu residues by Kapitonov and Yu. First, the sequence comparisons with selected glycosyltransferases show that, although the first Glu residue of the motif is invariant, the second Glu is more variable and therefore better fits the secondary role of the acid/base catalyst. It has to be noted that, in all the enzymes analyzed in this study, the second residue is always an amino acid whose lateral chain can putatively act as a proton donor/acceptor. Second, the E510A mutation in HMGS completely inactivates the enzyme, whereas the E518A mutant maintains some residual activity. The glycosyl donor in the synthesis of glycogen is UDP-glucose. The chemical nature of UDP dictates that this moiety can act as a good leaving group even when it is not protonated and thus the glycogenic reaction might still proceed at a measurable rate in the absence of an acid catalyst. Our results are consistent with Glu-510 being the fundamental nucleophile and with Glu-518 providing important but not essential catalytic assistance, possibly as the general acid/base catalyst. Further experiments are in progress to determine the exact roles of both conserved Glu residues of the E-X 7-E motif in the catalysis by GS. In this study we have combined bioinformatic and experimental techniques to identify two Glu residues at the active site of eukaryotic GSs, using HMGS as a model.

https://openalex.org/W2048423346,"In current models, protein translocation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) occurs in the context of two cycles, the signal recognition particle (SRP) cycle and the ribosome cycle. Both SRP and ribosomes bind to the ER membrane as a consequence of the targeting process of translocation. Whereas SRP release from the ER membrane is regulated by the GTPase activities of SRP and the SRP receptor, ribosome release from the ER membrane is thought to occur in response to the termination of protein synthesis. We report that ER-bound ribosomes remain membrane-bound following the termination of protein synthesis and in the bound state can initiate the translation of secretory and cytoplasmic proteins. Two principal observations are reported. 1) Membrane-bound ribosomes engaged in the synthesis of proteins lacking a signal sequence are released from the ER membrane as ribosome-nascent polypeptide complexes. 2) Membrane-bound ribosomes translating secretory proteins can access the translocon in an SRP receptor-independent manner. We propose that ribosome release from the ER membrane occurs in the context of protein translation, with release occurring by default in the absence of productive nascent polypeptide-membrane interactions.

While free in the cytoplasm, such ribosome-nascent polypeptide complexes (RNCs) are recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP) and targeted to the ER membrane via interaction with the SRP receptor (1Meyer D.I.

The targeting reaction culminates in the association of RNCs with the translocon, the cohort of ER membrane components that mediates protein translocation, and transfer of the nascent polypeptide across the ER membrane ensues (3Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 4Matlack K.E.S. Mothes W. Rapoport T.A.

Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). For translocation to proceed, the signal sequence must engage components of the ER membrane, fulfilling a postulated second signal sequence recognition event (6Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 7Belin D. Bost S. Vassalli J.-D. Strub K.

Via the targeting phase of the translocation cycle, SRP and biosynthetically active ribosomes associate with the ER membrane. How are these components recycled back to the cytoplasm to complete an exchange cycle? It is now established that SRP release from the ER membrane occurs through the combined GTP binding and GTPase activities of SRP and the SRP receptor complex (9Rapiejko P.J. Gilmore R. Cell. 1997; 89: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 10Stroud R.M. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known regarding the fate of the membrane-bound ribosome following the termination of protein translation. Many models depict that upon termination, the ribosome dissociates into its component 60 S and 40 S subunits and subsequently detaches from the ER membrane (11Mechler B. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Blobel G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 835-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). In these models, the release of ribosomal subunits from the ER membrane supports a ribosome cycle in which ribosomes engaged in the synthesis of signal sequence-bearing nascent polypeptides are selected from a free cytoplasmic pool, trafficked to the ER membrane, and subsequent to protein translocation, recycled back to the cytoplasm. This series of reactions provides a rationale for the segregation of ribosomes into free and membrane-bound pools. Although ribosome release from the ER membrane represents a fundamental element of the protein translocation cycle, it remains to be determined experimentally how ribosome release from the ER membrane is coupled to the termination of protein translation. In vitro studies with rat liver rough microsomes (RM) have demonstrated that following treatment with puromycin, free 40 S ribosomal subunits are capable of exchanging with membrane-bound 40 S subunits, whereas free 60 S subunits do not participate in exchange reactions with membrane-bound 60 S subunits (13Borgese D. Blobel G. Sabatini D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 74: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These data suggest that following puromycin-induced termination, the 60 S subunits remain in stable association with the ER membrane in the absence of protein synthesis. Indeed, in tissue culture cells it has been proposed that the release of 60 S ribosomal subunits from the ER membrane is kinetically delayed from the termination of protein synthesis (14Mechler B. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 16-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 48Seiser R.M. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33820-333827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, experiments in which RM are solubilized with digitonin and subsequently treated with puromycin indicate that membrane-bound ribosomes remain associated with the translocon (15Görlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.-U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). These data suggest that ribosome release from the ER membrane may be subject to as yet undefined regulatory influences and further emphasize the need for experimental analysis of the regulation of ribosome dissociation from the ER membrane. Our studies utilized the well established in vitrotranslation/translocation system consisting of rabbit reticulocyte lysate and canine pancreas rough microsomes. In examining the distribution of ribosomes during the elongation and termination stages of protein synthesis, we report that ribosome release from the ER membrane does not accompany termination. Rather, ribosome release was observed to occur in response to the synthesis of a cytosolic protein on a membrane-bound ribosome. In addition, we report that secretory precursors whose synthesis is initiated on membrane-bound ribosomes can access the translocon in an SRP receptor-independent manner. Canine pancreas RM were isolated and treated withStaphylococcus aureus nuclease (Calbiochem) as described (16Walter P. Blobel G.

Nuclease treatment was required to degrade microsome-associated mRNAs, thereby increasing the translation of exogenously added mRNA by membrane-bound ribosomes. However, this treatment decreased the overall translational capacity of the RM, presumably by stranding ribosomes on cleaved mRNA fragments, as reported previously for free reticulocyte lysate ribosomes (17Jackson R.J. Hunt T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 50-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). To remove any contaminating free ribosomes from RM preparations, 100 equivalents (eq; as defined in Ref. 16Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) of RM were diluted 5-fold with 2.5 m sucrose, 25 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.2), 350 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 1 mm DTT. This solution is then overlaid with 750 μl of 1.9m sucrose, 25 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.2), 350 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm DTT, and 200 μl of the same buffer lacking sucrose. The sample was centrifuged in an SW55 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) at 55,000 rpm for 4 h at 4 °C. Under these conditions, the RM float, whereas any contaminating free ribosomes sediment to yield a pellet fraction. The upper 400 μl of the gradient were collected and diluted 3-fold with RM buffer (250 mmsucrose, 25 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.2), 50 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 1 mm DTT) and were centrifuged at 60,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in a TLA100.2 rotor (Beckman Instruments). The membrane pellet was then resuspended in RM buffer. For some experiments, SRP receptor was inactivated by mild proteolysis prior to flotation of the RM. 100 eq of RM were diluted 20-fold with RM buffer, and chymotrypsin (Worthington) was then added to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. The sample was placed on ice for 30 min; the digestion was subsequently quenched by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 1 mm, and membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 60,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in a TLA100.2 rotor. Pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of RM buffer and processed for flotation as described above. Ribosomes were removed from reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI) by centrifugation at 80,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in a TLA100 rotor (Beckman Instruments). The supernatant was removed and then centrifuged again under identical conditions to ensure that ribosomes and ribosomal subunits were quantitatively depleted. The resulting ribosome-free post-ribosomal supernatant (PRS) was aliquoted and frozen in liquid nitrogen, and the pelleted ribosomes were resuspended in RM buffer. To fuse N-terminal luciferase extensions with pPL, the pPL-encoding plasmid pGEMBP1 (18Connolly T. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2253-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was first modified using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). An NcoI site was created at the extreme N terminus of the pPL coding region, using the primers 5′-GGC-AGA-CTC-TAG-ACC-ATG-GAC-AGC-AAA-GGT-TC-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-GAA-CCT-TTG-CTG-TCC-ATG-GTC-TAG-AGT-CTG-CC-3′ (antisense primer). An internal NcoI site was removed using the primers 5′-GGC-AAA-GGG-TTC-ATT-ACA-ATG-GCC-CTC-AAC-AGC-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-GCT-GTT-GAG-GGC-CAT-TGT-AAT-GAA-CCC-TTT-GCC-3′ (antisense primer). Neither modification altered the pPL amino acid sequence. Polymerase chain reaction products encoding the N-terminal 39, 59, or 93 amino acids of Rluc and flanked with NcoI sites were produced using the luciferase-containing plasmid pRL-null (Promega, Madison, WI) and the primers 5′-GTG-ACT-CCA-TGG-ATT-CGA-AAG-TTT-ATG-ATC-CAG-3′ (sense primer) and either 5′-GAG-ACA-CCA-TGG-TTT-CTG-AAT-CAT-AAT-AAT-TAA-TAA-ATG-3′ (antisense primer for Rluc40), 5′-GAG-ACA-CCA-TGG-TCC-ATA-AAT-AAG-AAG-AGG-CCG-3′ (antisense primer for Rluc60), or 5′-GAG-ACA-CCA-TGG-TAA-GTA-ACC-TAT-AAG-AAC-C-3′ (antisense primer for Rluc94). Rluc polymerase chain reaction fragments and the modified pGEMBP1 vector were digested with NcoI and ligated together. Ligation products were transformed into the Escherichia colistrain DH5α, and positive clones were isolated. A threonine residue was encoded between the Rluc and pPL coding regions as a result of the cloning strategy. Transcripts coding for pPL86 were generated by linearizing pGEMBP1 with PvuII. For pPL55, the plasmid was linearized with FokI. Transcripts coding for Rluc94 were generated by linearizing pRL-null withBclI. For Rluc56, the plasmid was linearized usingEarI, and for Rluc33, the plasmid was linearized withVspI. GFP146 was created by linearizing the GFP-containing plasmid (provided by T. Meyer) with XhoI. All restriction enzymes were obtained from either New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) or Promega. Transcription was carried out using a MEGAscript T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Translations were carried out as described (19Nicchitta C.V. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Where indicated, ribosome-free reticulocyte lysate was substituted for unfractionated lysate, and RM were used as the source of ribosomes. Translations were conducted at 25 °C for 30 min using35S-labeled Pro-Mix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Completed translation mixtures (20 μl) were diluted to 100 μl with 110 mmKOAc, 25 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.2), and 2.5 mmMg(OAc)2 and were then layered upon a 100-μl 0.5m sucrose cushion in the same buffer. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C in a TLA100 rotor and were resuspended directly into SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.5 m Tris, 5% SDS, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). The supernatants, containing unbound ribosomes, were precipitated by addition of saturated ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 66% and were washed once with 10% trichloroacetic acid before being resuspended in sample buffer. Samples were then processed for SDS-PAGE. Gels were visualized using a Fujix MacBAS1000 PhosphorImager, and digital images were prepared using Adobe Photoshop 4.0. All quantitation of the PhosphorImager output was performed using Fujix MacBAS version 2.0 software. Alternatively, RNC association with membranes was determined by flotation centrifugation. Completed translation mixtures (40 μl) containing free ribosomes were placed on ice, and cycloheximide was added to 1 mm to ensure that further translation could not occur. 4 eq of carrier RM were then added, and samples were incubated 10 min on ice, followed by 20 min at 25 °C. Completed translation mixtures using RM-bound ribosomes as the translation source were treated similarly, except additional RM were not added following the 30-min translation. Samples were then diluted to 100 μl with RM buffer and were mixed with 400 μl of 2.5 m sucrose, 150 mm KOAc, 25 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.2), 2.5 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 1 mm DTT. Samples were overlaid with 1 ml of 1.9 m sucrose and 200 μl of 250 mm sucrose, both containing 150 mm KOAc, 25 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.2), 2.5 mmMg(OAc)2, and 1 mm DTT, and were centrifuged in an SW55 rotor at 55,000 rpm for 4 h at 4 °C. For some samples, KOAc concentrations were adjusted to 0.5 m and were incubated for 15 min on ice immediately prior to flotation centrifugation. Sucrose solutions containing 0.5 m KOAc were then used for flotation centrifugation of these samples. Following centrifugation, all samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, cut into thirds using a sharp knife, and prepared for SDS-PAGE as described above. Release of polypeptides from ribosomes was conducted by diluting completed translation mixtures (20 μl) to 50 μl with 110 mm KOAc, 25 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.2), and 2.5 mm Mg(OAc)2 and then adding puromycin to 1 mm. Samples were incubated on ice for 5 min and then at 25 °C for 15 min. To analyze polypeptide accessibility to exogenous protease, proteinase K was added to translation mixtures to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, and samples were incubated on ice for 30 min. Where indicated, CHAPS was included at a final concentration of 0.5%. Immunoprecipitation of pPL nascent polypeptides using anti-pPL polyclonal antisera (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) was conducted as described (20Anderson D.J. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Samples were layered upon 10-ml 10–30% sucrose gradients containing 25 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm cycloheximide. Samples were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 2.5 h at 4 °C in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Gradients were manually fractionated by puncturing the tube bottoms, and fractions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As noted in the Introduction, little is known regarding the mechanism by which ribosomes and/or ribosomal subunits dissociate from the ER membrane following the termination of protein synthesis. The central role of SRP in regulating the association of biosynthetically active ribosomes with the ER membrane is, however, well established. To investigate the mechanism of ribosome dissociation from the ER membrane, we utilized an experimental system that in prior studies was used to establish the mechanism of SRP-dependent ribosome-membrane association (21Walter P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Necessarily, it was essential to these studies that the analysis be strictly limited to membrane-bound ribosomes, and so the canine pancreas microsome fraction used in these studies was further purified by flotation centrifugation through a high salt buffer. This purification step removes unbound and inactive bound ribosomes, leaving only those ribosomes that are tethered to the membrane by the presence of a nascent polypeptide (22Adelman M.R. Sabatini D.D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 56: 206-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To constrain further the analysis to membrane-bound ribosomes, a ribosome-free supernatant fraction of reticulocyte lysate was utilized as a source of the initiation, elongation, and termination factors necessary to support the protein translation cycle. As shown in Fig.1, when the protein translation activity of membrane-bound ribosomes was assayed in the presence of radiolabeled methionine, a number of prominent microsome-specific translation products were produced, and these nascent polypeptides were translocated into the ER lumen, as indicated by resistance to degradation by proteinase K in the absence, but not the presence, of detergent (Fig. 1 A). As the data in Fig. 1 A indicate, membrane-bound ribosomes retain protein translation activity. Given the presence of active, stably bound ribosomes on the membrane fraction, it was possible to investigate experimentally the process by which the membrane detachment of such ribosomes was regulated. To do so, the ability of the membrane-bound ribosomes to initiate translation of exogenously added mRNA was evaluated. As a control experiment, the addition of mRNA encoding truncated forms of preprolactin (pPL86; 86 amino acids), Renilla luciferase (Rluc94; 94 amino acids), or green fluorescent protein (GFP146; 146 amino acids) to the ribosome-free reticulocyte lysate PRS, in the absence of RM, did not yield protein translation (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and5). In contrast, when salt-washed, purified RM were present, translation of pPL86, Rluc94, and GFP146 was observed (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). The faint band apparent in all lanes represents the non-enzymatic labeling of globin and was observed in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (data not shown). To more rigorously determine whether the observed protein translation activity was derived from the membrane-bound ribosomes, the purified RM were pelleted using centrifugation conditions that retain free ribosomes and/or ribosomal subunits in the supernatant and allow recovery of the RM in the pellet fraction. The pellet and supernatant fractions from such centrifugations were then separately assayed for translation activity. As shown in Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and 4, the translation of exogenous mRNA was wholly initiated by membrane-bound ribosomes (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and4). The observation that membrane-bound ribosomes could initiate new rounds of translation was consistent with either of two models. 1) In the presence of PRS, membrane-bound ribosomes undergo run-off protein translation, yielding the release of the membrane-bound ribosomal subunits into a free ribosomal subunit pool and the subsequent initiation of protein synthesis on free ribosomes. 2) The ribosomes/ribosomal subunits remain in association with the ER membrane following termination, with initiation occurring on the bound ribosomes. To differentiate between these two possibilities, RM were preincubated under run-off translation conditions to allow the bound ribosomes to undergo termination reactions and were subsequently fractionated, as described above. As shown in Fig. 1 B, lanes 7 and 8, translation activity was again solely recovered in the membrane-bound ribosomal population, indicating that run-off translation does not result in the detachment of translationally active ribosomes from the ER membrane. These results were further corroborated by immunoblots for ribosomal proteins L3/L4, wherein we were unable to identify the release of ribosomes into the supernatant fraction (data not shown). Significantly, the data presented in Fig. 1 indicate that membrane-bound ribosomes can initiate translation of mRNA regardless of whether the encoded protein possesses (pPL86) or lacks (Rluc94 and GFP146) an ER signal sequence. The experiments depicted in Fig. 1 indicate that ribosomes engaged in the synthesis of endogenous mRNAs did not dissociate from the ER membrane following run-off translation. That such ribosomes were clearly capable of de novo protein synthesis suggests, but does not prove, that run-off translation had occurred. Because of the difficulties in unequivocally ascertaining the translation status of the endogenous mRNAs, we focused our analysis on those ribosomes engaged in the de novo synthesis of proteins from exogenous mRNAs. To determine the fates of ribosome-nascent polypeptide complexes following thede novo initiation of protein synthesis on membrane-bound ribosomes, a series of fractionation experiments was performed. In control experiments, proteins were synthesized by free reticulocyte lysate ribosomes in the presence or absence of RM and were then subjected to centrifugation to separate membrane-associated from free RNCs (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–4). When synthesized in the absence of RM, the majority of all RNCs were recovered in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 2). Minor amounts of RNCs were recovered in the pellet fraction in the absence of membranes, as is commonly observed in such experiments (23Siegel V. Walter P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1769-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 24Murphy III, E.C. Zheng T. Nicchitta C.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1213-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). When synthesis on free ribosomes was performed in the presence of RM, only RNCs engaged in the synthesis of signal sequence-bearing nascent polypeptides (pPL86) bound to the membranes; RNCs engaged in the synthesis of Rluc94 and GFP146 were recovered in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and4). These data are entirely consistent with previous studies in demonstrating that ribosomes engaged in the synthesis of secretory precursors associate with the ER membrane, whereas ribosomes engaged in the synthesis of cytosolic proteins remain in the supernatant (cytosol) fraction. As an additional note, in these and related experiments, protein translation can occur on both free and membrane-bound ribosomes. To determine the relative activities of the two modes of translation, the ribosome content and thus translation activity of the reticulocyte lysate fraction were titrated to define the point of translation equivalence with the membrane-bound ribosome fraction. The results of these experiments indicate that under standard reaction conditions (2 eq of RM (16Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) in 20 μl of translation medium) lysate-derived free ribosomes provide 10-fold greater translation activity versus membrane-bound ribosomes (data not shown). Thus, translation occurs predominantly on free ribosomes. Similar experiments were then performed under conditions where membrane-bound ribosomes were the sole source of ribosomes. Again, nascent pPL86 was recovered in association with the membranes; Rluc94 and GFP146 were, however, recovered in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 and 6). In the experiments described above, Rluc94 and GFP146 were synthesized on artificially truncated mRNAs lacking termination codons and thus should remain predominantly ribosome-associated. To determine whether Rluc94 and GFP146 translation products were released from the membrane in the context of intact RNCs, supernatant fractions, obtained by centrifugation of translation reactions conducted with membrane-bound ribosomes, were centrifuged through 10–30% sucrose gradients, and the distribution of the translation products was determined. An immunoblot for ribosomal proteins L3/L4 indicates the migration of 80 S ribosomes in the gradients (Fig. 2 B, upper panel). In comparing the relative migration of the ribosomal peak and the radiolabeled nascent polypeptides, it is clear that the majority of the Rluc94 and GFP146 nascent polypeptides had been released from the membrane as intact RNCs (Fig. 2 B, middle and lower panels). Thus, translation of proteins lacking a signal sequence on membrane-bound ribosomes yields the detachment of intact RNCs from the ER membrane. Following the translation of pPL86 on membrane-bound ribosomes, completed pPL86 nascent polypeptides sedimented in association with the ER membrane (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 and 6). However, the mechanism by which membrane association was conferred was not clear. Did the pPL86 RNCs remain membrane-bound throughout the translation period? Alternatively, did the RNCs release from the membrane early in synthesis, only to re-target by the SRP-dependent pathway? To address these questions, the following hypothesis was examined; if membrane-bound ribosomes engaged in the de novo protein synthesis of secretory precursors dissociate from the membrane early in synthesis, such RNCs would require the SRP receptor activity for re-targeting to the membrane. A stringent test of this hypothesis was performed by inhibiting SRP receptor activity. It is well established that the cytoplasmic domain of the SRP receptor can be inactivated by mild proteolysis, under conditions where the remainder of the translocation machinery is intact (25Walter P.

Therefore, RM were treated at a low concentration of chymotrypsin (5 μg/ml) to degrade the SRP receptor (SRα), while leaving the translocon component Sec61α intact (Fig. 3 A). From the data presented in Fig. 3 A, a conservative estimate indicates that 10 eq of proteolyzed RM may contain that quantity of SRα present in 0.5 eq of native RM (∼20-fold reduction). To assess the functional consequences of the proteolysis-dependent loss of SRα, the association of pPL86 RNCs with native and proteolyzed membranes was determined by flotation centrifugation (Fig. 3 B). A number of aspects of these experiments warrant mention. First, the experiments were performed with a truncated secretory precursor, pPL86. Previous studies have unequivocally demonstrated that this precursor remains in association with the ribosome and retains post-translational targeting and translocation competence (18Connolly T. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2253-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 19Nicchitta C.V. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, any functional SRα present in the proteolyzed RM fraction would be expected to be accessible to pPL86 RNCs and would display activity in the targeting assay. Second, as noted above, under standard reaction conditions, the total translation activity of the lysate-derived free ribosomes is approximately 10-fold higher than the membrane-bound ribosomes. To ensure that these experiments accurately depicted the activities of the free and membrane-bound ribosomes, the ribosome content of the reticulocyte lysate was titrated (by centrifugation and ribosome re-addition) such that identical quantities of precursor proteins were synthesized by either the free or membrane-bound ribosomes. Importantly, by so doing,"

This increased activation correlated with higher PLD1 protein expression levels, as marked by faster accumulation and longer persistence of PLD1 when PEA-15 was present. PEA-15 similarly increased protein expressions level of PLD2 and co-immunoprecipitated with it. These results suggest that PEA-15 may stabilize PLD or act as a PLD chaperone.

The fact that these activators and inhibitors regulate very important cellular functions has implied that PLD will also play important roles. These roles are just starting to be elucidated and include glucose transport (3Emoto M. Klarlund J.K. Waters S.B. Hu V. Buxton J.M. Chawla A. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Many of these processes involve protein-protein interactions that can be explored using the yeast two-hybrid system.An interaction between RhoA and the C terminus has already been reported (7Sung T.C.

In addition, the structure of the PLD superfamily indicates that the mammalian PLDs are likely to participate in several types of protein-protein interactions that as of yet wait to be defined.

Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The fact that these activators and inhibitors regulate very important cellular functions has implied that PLD will also play important roles. These roles are just starting to be elucidated and include glucose transport (3Emoto M. Klarlund J.K. Waters S.B. Hu V. Buxton J.M. Chawla A. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Little is known, though, about the regulation of other aspects of PLD cell biology, for example, how its subcellular localization is determined, if it translocates upon activation in some circumstances, why and how it is regulated on a transcriptional level in many cell types, and whether there are additional mechanisms such as phosphorylation or other post-translational mechanisms that are also important. Many of these processes involve protein-protein interactions that can be explored using the yeast two-hybrid system. An interaction between RhoA and the C terminus has already been reported (7Sung T.C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J.

In addition, the structure of the PLD superfamily indicates that the mammalian PLDs are likely to participate in several types of protein-protein interactions that as of yet wait to be defined. For example, mammalian PLD1 and PLD2 and theCaenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and yeast PLDs all encode N-terminal phox and pleckstrin homology domains that are not required for PLD activity (9Sung T.C.

Such domains can mediate protein-protein interactions and represent good candidate regions to regulate PLD subcellular localization (3Emoto M. Klarlund J.K. Waters S.B. Hu V. Buxton J.M. Chawla A.

Therefore, we hypothesized that a pathway leading to the inhibition of Akt might be utilized in the process of apoptosis. Accordingly, we used a yeast two-hybrid screening assay to identify the proteins that interact with and possibly inhibit Akt. We found that the C-terminal region of protein kinase C-related kinase 2 (PRK2), containing amino acids 862 to 908, specifically binds to Akt in yeast and mammalian cells. During early stages of apoptosis, the C-terminal region of PRK2 is cleaved from the inhibitory N-terminal region and can bind Akt. The protein-protein interaction between Akt and the PRK2 C-terminal region specifically down-modulates the protein kinase activities of Akt by inhibiting phosphorylation at threonine 308 and serine 473 of Akt. This inhibition of Akt leads to the inhibition of the downstream signaling of Aktin vivo. The PRK2 C-terminal fragment strongly inhibits the Akt-mediated phosphorylation of BAD, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, and blocks the anti-apoptotic activities of Aktin vivo. These results provide direct evidence that the products of protein cleavage during apoptosis inhibit pro-survival signalings, leading to the amplification of pro-apoptotic signalings in the cell.

Phosphorylation of Akt occurs on two residues; threonine 308, in the activation loop, and serine 473, within the C-terminal activation domain. Whereas the upstream kinase phophorylating serine 473 is still unknown, phosphorylation of the activation loop site by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) is dependent on the products of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, either phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate or 3,4,5-trikisphosphate (13Alessi D.R.

Akt exerts its anti-apoptotic effects in a variety of ways (28Khwaja A. Nature. 1999; 401: 33-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It phosphorylates and inactivates pro-apoptotic proteins, such as BAD (29Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar). In addition, two reports demonstrated that Akt can influence the production of nitric oxide, which is linked to the pathways that regulate apoptosis (32Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B.

Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Most recently, Akt has been found to yield anti-apoptotic signals via the nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and forkhead transcription factor pathways (34Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P.

Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar).However, apoptosis often occurs despite the presence of cytokines and growth factors that stimulate the anti-apoptotic pathway modulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (39Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). Moreover, the death signal molecule tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1induces apoptosis despite transiently activating Akt (37Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we hypothesized that cells undergoing apoptosis should possess a mechanism that inhibits Akt to secure cell death processes.In the present study, we show that Akt binds to the C-terminal fragments of PRK2 that is generated during the early stages of apoptosis. This protein-protein interaction specifically down-modulates the protein kinase activities of Akt by inhibiting phosphorylation at its threonine 308 and serine 473 residues and strongly inhibits the anti-apoptotic function of Akt. These results support a novel mechanism where PRK2 is involved in the regulation of Akt and its downstream targets in the cell.DISCUSSIONIn contrast to the recent flood of information concerning the activation mechanisms of Akt, we have a very limited understanding about how cells down-modulate the activities of Akt. Recently, several groups reported that Akt can be inhibited by stresses such as hyperosmotic shock and ceramide treatment (48Meier R. Thelen M. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7294-7303Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 49Summers S.A. Garza L.A. Zhou H. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5457-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 50Zhou H. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16568-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 51Zundel W. Giaccia A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These observations implicate that the inhibitory signaling mechanisms operate during stress-induced apoptosis to inhibit Akt, and this possibility was further supported by the fact that TNF induces apoptosis despite activating Akt (37Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tried to screen for negative regulators for Akt by yeast two-hybrid assay and found PRK2 as an Akt-binding protein. By conducting yeast two-hybrid and in vivo binding assays, we demonstrated that the C-terminal sequences (amino acids 862–908) of PRK2 are necessary for specific binding to Akt in vivo (Figs. 1 and 2). Because the production of C1 fragment (containing amino acids 700 to 984) during apoptosis was previously reported by others (46Cryns V.L. Byun Y. Rana A. Mellor H. Lustig K.D. Ghanem L. Parker P.J. Kirschner M.W. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29449-29453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and in our Fig. 3, we have focused our study on C1.C1 does not contain a complete structure required for protein serine/threonine kinase activity, which implies that protein phosphorylation is not involved in the C1-mediated effects on Akt. On the other hand, we believe that the protein-protein interaction between C1 and Akt is critical and that this binding leads to the inhibition of the EGF-induced Akt activity by C1 (Figs. 2 and 4). In addition, C1 expression strongly inhibited the phosphorylation and inactivation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD by constitutively active Akt (Fig. 7) while having no effect on the activation of JNK (Fig. 5). From these results, we concluded that C1 directly and specifically inhibits Akt and its downstream signalings.To determine the mechanism by which C1 inhibits the activity of Aktin vivo, we expressed C1 with Myr-Akt, the membrane localized form of Akt, in the cell and measured the activity of Myr-Akt. In this experiment, we found that C1 down-regulates the activity of Myr-Akt (Fig. 6), which confirms that the binding of C1 does not inhibit the activity of Akt by blocking the translocation of Akt to the membrane. Next, we examined whether C1 affects the phosphorylation of threonine 308 and serine 473 in Akt, and surprisingly, we found that C1 completely inhibited the phosphorylation of serine 473 and rather weakly inhibited the phosphorylation of threonine 308 (Fig. 6). Recently, Alessi and co-workers (47Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) group show that PIF, which encodes amino acids 908–984 of PRK2, acts as a positive regulator for PDK1 in vitro, allowing it to phosphorylate both threonine 308 and serine 473 residues of Akt, and thus, one can raise the possibility that C1 may regulate Akt by affecting PDK1 rather that Akt. However, in contrast to their results, we demonstrated that C1 inhibits rather than enhances the phosphorylation of serine 473 and threonine 308 in Akt (Fig. 6). In addition, in their in vivo experiment, co-expression of PIF had a negligible effect on the activity of Akt and had no effect on the phosphorylation of Akt (52Balendran A. Currie R. Armstrong C.G. Avruch J. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37400-37406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, we severely doubt the role of PIF in activating dual Akt kinase activities of PDK1. Moreover, C3, another PRK2 fragment binds to Akt, also specifically inhibits the phosphorylation and activity of Akt (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). Furthermore, we found that C1 binds to the tail region of Akt containing the serine 473 residue, close to the kinase domain containing the threonine 308 residue. 2H. Koh and J. Chung, unpublished results. Because of these findings, we believe that C1 directly inhibits Akt, not indirectly through binding with PDK1. However, we still cannot exclude the possibility that these contradicting experimental results may arise from the fact that C1 contains more regions of PRK2 than does PIF. Further studies on the functional differences between C1, C3, and PIF will be needed to elucidate this matter.Having identified C1 as an Akt inhibitor, we tried to elucidate the physiological roles of C1. C1 cleaved from PRK2, but not full-length PRK2, associates with Akt in apoptotic cells (Fig. 3). The phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD by constitutively active Gag-Akt is almost completely blocked by C1 expression (Fig. 7). Furthermore, expression of wild type PRK2 or C1 strongly inhibits the Akt-mediated protection against TNF-induced apoptosis (Fig. 8). In this experiment, wild type PRK2, which did not inhibit the activity of Akt in our previous experiments (Figs. 4, 6, and 7) without apoptotic stimulation, strongly down-regulated the anti-apoptotic activity of Akt. Therefore, we conclude that the C1 fragment of PRK2 generated by caspases potentiates apoptotic signals in vivo by inhibiting Akt.In previous studies, Akt has been reported to be cleaved during apoptosis (53Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 54Francois F. Grimes M.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1773-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, one may raise the argument that the binding between C1 and Akt may not have actual physiological significance. However, we have repeatedly demonstrated that Akt is not cleaved while C1 binds and inhibits Akt (Figs. 3 and 6) in our experimental conditions. In addition, we have demonstrated the inhibition of the pro-survival activity of Akt by C1 in vivo(Figs. 7 and 8). Therefore, we conclude that the binding between C1 and Akt, by inhibiting the pro-survival activity of Akt, is an important early step in the onset of apoptosis. From our results, the following model is proposed. After receiving a death signal, caspase cascades are activated. Activated caspases quickly cleave PRK2 and generate the C1 fragment. The C1 fragment binds to Akt and inhibits its anti-apoptotic activities. Consequently, apoptotic signalings become prevalent over survival signalings, and apoptosis is allowed to proceed. In support of this model, PRK2 mutated at a caspase cleavage site, aspartate 700 to glutamate, had a significantly diminished pro-apoptotic function compared with wild type PRK2 (Fig. 9).Although our results suggest a role for PRK2 during apoptosis in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway, PRK2 may also have a regular function in the pathway of normal cells. As described previously, Alessi and co-workers (47Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) show that the C-terminal 77 amino acids (or PIF) of PRK2 interact with PDK1 (47Balendran A. Casamayor A.

Interestingly, our study showed that the sequences directly upstream of this PIF specifically interact with Akt. In addition, PRK2 has been found to contain a GTPase binding domain, which interacts with small GTPases such as Rac and Rho (43Vincent S. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and an SH3-binding domain (44Quilliam L.A. Lambert Q.T. Mickelson-Young L.A. Westwick J.K. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Jenkins N.A.

These results suggest the role of PRK2 as a scaffold protein in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. We can find a similar example where a protein kinase acts as a scaffold in Pbs2p, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase in yeast (55Posas F. Saito H. Science. 1997; 276: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Akt, also termed RAC kinase (1Jones P.F. Jakubowicz T. Pitossi F.J. Maurer F. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Later, it was found that Akt is phosphorylated and activated in response to mitogens and survival factors in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner (4Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O.

Phosphorylation of Akt occurs on two residues; threonine 308, in the activation loop, and serine 473, within the C-terminal activation domain. Whereas the upstream kinase phophorylating serine 473 is still unknown, phosphorylation of the activation loop site by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) is dependent on the products of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, either phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate or 3,4,5-trikisphosphate (13Alessi D.R.

Many results support that Akt regulates various cellular metabolic pathways. It regulates glycogen synthesis by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3 (6Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M.

In addition, Akt has been implicated in the regulation of protein synthesis through indirect activation of the p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) (5Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J.

O'Leary M.A Sonenberg N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Akt is necessary for cell survival and the prevention of apoptosis (23Ahmed N.N.

Akt exerts its anti-apoptotic effects in a variety of ways (28Khwaja A. Nature. 1999; 401: 33-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It phosphorylates and inactivates pro-apoptotic proteins, such as BAD (29Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar). In addition, two reports demonstrated that Akt can influence the production of nitric oxide, which is linked to the pathways that regulate apoptosis (32Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar, 33Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Most recently, Akt has been found to yield anti-apoptotic signals via the nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and forkhead transcription factor pathways (34Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P.

However, apoptosis often occurs despite the presence of cytokines and growth factors that stimulate the anti-apoptotic pathway modulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (39Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). Moreover, the death signal molecule tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1induces apoptosis despite transiently activating Akt (37Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we hypothesized that cells undergoing apoptosis should possess a mechanism that inhibits Akt to secure cell death processes. In the present study, we show that Akt binds to the C-terminal fragments of PRK2 that is generated during the early stages of apoptosis. This protein-protein interaction specifically down-modulates the protein kinase activities of Akt by inhibiting phosphorylation at its threonine 308 and serine 473 residues and strongly inhibits the anti-apoptotic function of Akt. These results support a novel mechanism where PRK2 is involved in the regulation of Akt and its downstream targets in the cell. DISCUSSIONIn contrast to the recent flood of information concerning the activation mechanisms of Akt, we have a very limited understanding about how cells down-modulate the activities of Akt. Recently, several groups reported that Akt can be inhibited by stresses such as hyperosmotic shock and ceramide treatment (48Meier R. Thelen M. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7294-7303Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 49Summers S.A. Garza L.A. Zhou H. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5457-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 50Zhou H. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16568-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 51Zundel W. Giaccia A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These observations implicate that the inhibitory signaling mechanisms operate during stress-induced apoptosis to inhibit Akt, and this possibility was further supported by the fact that TNF induces apoptosis despite activating Akt (37Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tried to screen for negative regulators for Akt by yeast two-hybrid assay and found PRK2 as an Akt-binding protein. By conducting yeast two-hybrid and in vivo binding assays, we demonstrated that the C-terminal sequences (amino acids 862–908) of PRK2 are necessary for specific binding to Akt in vivo (Figs. 1 and 2). Because the production of C1 fragment (containing amino acids 700 to 984) during apoptosis was previously reported by others (46Cryns V.L. Byun Y. Rana A. Mellor H. Lustig K.D. Ghanem L. Parker P.J. Kirschner M.W. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29449-29453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and in our Fig. 3, we have focused our study on C1.C1 does not contain a complete structure required for protein serine/threonine kinase activity, which implies that protein phosphorylation is not involved in the C1-mediated effects on Akt. On the other hand, we believe that the protein-protein interaction between C1 and Akt is critical and that this binding leads to the inhibition of the EGF-induced Akt activity by C1 (Figs. 2 and 4). In addition, C1 expression strongly inhibited the phosphorylation and inactivation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD by constitutively active Akt (Fig. 7) while having no effect on the activation of JNK (Fig. 5). From these results, we concluded that C1 directly and specifically inhibits Akt and its downstream signalings.To determine the mechanism by which C1 inhibits the activity of Aktin vivo, we expressed C1 with Myr-Akt, the membrane localized form of Akt, in the cell and measured the activity of Myr-Akt. In this experiment, we found that C1 down-regulates the activity of Myr-Akt (Fig. 6), which confirms that the binding of C1 does not inhibit the activity of Akt by blocking the translocation of Akt to the membrane. Next, we examined whether C1 affects the phosphorylation of threonine 308 and serine 473 in Akt, and surprisingly, we found that C1 completely inhibited the phosphorylation of serine 473 and rather weakly inhibited the phosphorylation of threonine 308 (Fig. 6). Recently, Alessi and co-workers (47Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) group show that PIF, which encodes amino acids 908–984 of PRK2, acts as a positive regulator for PDK1 in vitro, allowing it to phosphorylate both threonine 308 and serine 473 residues of Akt, and thus, one can raise the possibility that C1 may regulate Akt by affecting PDK1 rather that Akt. However, in contrast to their results, we demonstrated that C1 inhibits rather than enhances the phosphorylation of serine 473 and threonine 308 in Akt (Fig. 6). In addition, in their in vivo experiment, co-expression of PIF had a negligible effect on the activity of Akt and had no effect on the phosphorylation of Akt (52Balendran A. Currie R. Armstrong C.G. Avruch J. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37400-37406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, we severely doubt the role of PIF in activating dual Akt kinase activities of PDK1. Moreover, C3, another PRK2 fragment binds to Akt, also specifically inhibits the phosphorylation and activity of Akt (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). Furthermore, we found that C1 binds to the tail region of Akt containing the serine 473 residue, close to the kinase domain containing the threonine 308 residue. 2H. Koh and J. Chung, unpublished results. Because of these findings, we believe that C1 directly inhibits Akt, not indirectly through binding with PDK1. However, we still cannot exclude the possibility that these contradicting experimental results may arise from the fact that C1 contains more regions of PRK2 than does PIF. Further studies on the functional differences between C1, C3, and PIF will be needed to elucidate this matter.Having identified C1 as an Akt inhibitor, we tried to elucidate the physiological roles of C1. C1 cleaved from PRK2, but not full-length PRK2, associates with Akt in apoptotic cells (Fig. 3). The phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD by constitutively active Gag-Akt is almost completely blocked by C1 expression (Fig. 7). Furthermore, expression of wild type PRK2 or C1 strongly inhibits the Akt-mediated protection against TNF-induced apoptosis (Fig. 8). In this experiment, wild type PRK2, which did not inhibit the activity of Akt in our previous experiments (Figs. 4, 6, and 7) without apoptotic stimulation, strongly down-regulated the anti-apoptotic activity of Akt. Therefore, we conclude that the C1 fragment of PRK2 generated by caspases potentiates apoptotic signals in vivo by inhibiting Akt.In previous studies, Akt has been reported to be cleaved during apoptosis (53Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 54Francois F. Grimes M.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1773-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, one may raise the argument that the binding between C1 and Akt may not have actual physiological significance. However, we have repeatedly demonstrated that Akt is not cleaved while C1 binds and inhibits Akt (Figs. 3 and 6) in our experimental conditions. In addition, we have demonstrated the inhibition of the pro-survival activity of Akt by C1 in vivo(Figs. 7 and 8). Therefore, we conclude that the binding between C1 and Akt, by inhibiting the pro-survival activity of Akt, is an important early step in the onset of apoptosis. From our results, the following model is proposed. After receiving a death signal, caspase cascades are activated. Activated caspases quickly cleave PRK2 and generate the C1 fragment. The C1 fragment binds to Akt and inhibits its anti-apoptotic activities. Consequently, apoptotic signalings become prevalent over survival signalings, and apoptosis is allowed to proceed. In support of this model, PRK2 mutated at a caspase cleavage site, aspartate 700 to glutamate, had a significantly diminished pro-apoptotic function compared with wild type PRK2 (Fig. 9).Although our results suggest a role for PRK2 during apoptosis in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway, PRK2 may also have a regular function in the pathway of normal cells. As described previously, Alessi and co-workers (47Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) show that the C-terminal 77 amino acids (or PIF) of PRK2 interact with PDK1 (47Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our study showed that the sequences directly upstream of this PIF specifically interact with Akt. In addition, PRK2 has been found to contain a GTPase binding domain, which interacts with small GTPases such as Rac and Rho (43Vincent S. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and an SH3-binding domain (44Quilliam L.A. Lambert Q.T. Mickelson-Young L.A. Westwick J.K. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Jenkins N.A.

Furthermore, expression of wild type PRK2 or C1 strongly inhibits the Akt-mediated protection against TNF-induced apoptosis (Fig. 8). In this experiment, wild type PRK2, which did not inhibit the activity of Akt in our previous experiments (Figs. 4, 6, and 7) without apoptotic stimulation, strongly down-regulated the anti-apoptotic activity of Akt. Therefore, we conclude that the C1 fragment of PRK2 generated by caspases potentiates apoptotic signals in vivo by inhibiting Akt. In previous studies, Akt has been reported to be cleaved during apoptosis (53Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 54Francois F. Grimes M.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1773-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, one may raise the argument that the binding between C1 and Akt may not have actual physiological significance. However, we have repeatedly demonstrated that Akt is not cleaved while C1 binds and inhibits Akt (Figs. 3 and 6) in our experimental conditions. In addition, we have demonstrated the inhibition of the pro-survival activity of Akt by C1 in vivo(Figs. 7 and 8). Therefore, we conclude that the binding between C1 and Akt, by inhibiting the pro-survival activity of Akt, is an important early step in the onset of apoptosis. From our results, the following model is proposed. After receiving a death signal, caspase cascades are activated. Activated caspases quickly cleave PRK2 and generate the C1 fragment. The C1 fragment binds to Akt and inhibits its anti-apoptotic activities. Consequently, apoptotic signalings become prevalent over survival signalings, and apoptosis is allowed to proceed. In support of this model, PRK2 mutated at a caspase cleavage site, aspartate 700 to glutamate, had a significantly diminished pro-apoptotic function compared with wild type PRK2 (Fig. 9). Although our results suggest a role for PRK2 during apoptosis in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway, PRK2 may also have a regular function in the pathway of normal cells. As described previously, Alessi and co-workers (47Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) show that the C-terminal 77 amino acids (or PIF) of PRK2 interact with PDK1 (47Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our study showed that the sequences directly upstream of this PIF specifically interact with Akt. In addition, PRK2 has been found to contain a GTPase binding domain, which interacts with small GTPases such as Rac and Rho (43Vincent S. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and an SH3-binding domain (44Quilliam L.A. Lambert Q.T. Mickelson-Young L.A. Westwick J.K. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Jenkins N.A.

These results suggest the role of PRK2 as a scaffold protein in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. We can find a similar example where a protein kinase acts as a scaffold in Pbs2p, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase in yeast (55Posas F. Saito H.

H., Elo, I., Eriksson, J. E., and Kähäri, V.-M. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 5137–5145). Here we show that C2-ceramide inhibits expression of type I and III collagen mRNAs in dermal fibroblasts, suppresses proα2(I) collagen promoter activity, and reduces stability of type I collagen mRNAs. The down-regulatory effect of C2-ceramide on type I collagen mRNA levels was abrogated by protein kinase C inhibitors H7, staurosporine, and Ro-31–8220 and potently inhibited by a combination of MEK1,2 inhibitor PD98059 and p38 inhibitor SB203580. Activation of ERK1/2 by adenovirus-mediated expression of constitutively active MEK1 resulted in marked down-regulation of type I collagen mRNA levels and production in fibroblasts, whereas activation of p38 by constitutively active MAPK kinase-3b and MAPK kinase-6b slightly up-regulated type I collagen expression. These results identify the ERK1/2 signaling cascade as a potent negative regulatory pathway with respect to type I collagen expression in fibroblasts, suggesting that it mediates inhibition of collagen production in response to mitogenic stimulation and transformation. Treatment with the lipid second messenger, ceramide, activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 in human skin fibroblasts and induces their collagenase-1 expression (Reunanen, N., Westermarck, J., Häkkinen, L., Holmström, T.

Type I collagen is a heterotrimeric molecule consisting of two α1 chains and one α2 chain.

TNF-α is a proinflammatory cytokine that inhibits the formation of ECM by suppressing the expression of type I collagen and by inducing the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by fibroblasts (2Kähäri V.-M.

Binding of TNF-α to its 55-kDa cell surface receptor activates neutral sphingomyelinase, which hydrolyzes cell membrane sphingomyelin to the lipid second messenger, ceramide. We have recently shown that synthetic cell-permeable C2-ceramide enhances fibroblast collagenase-1 (MMP-1) expression via coordinate activation of the following three distinct mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways: extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 (11Reunanen N.

Here we show that activation of ceramide signaling pathway potently inhibits the expression of type I collagen in human skin fibroblasts and that this involves coordinate activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs. In addition, we show that specific activation of ERK1/2 by adenovirus-mediated expression of constitutively active MEK1 results in potent suppression in type I and III collagen expression by normal skin fibroblasts. These results identify ERK1/2 as a potent negative regulatory pathway with respect to expression of type I collagen in fibroblasts, suggesting that it plays a role in the control of collagen deposition, e.g. in wound repair and tumor growth. C2-ceramide, H7, staurosporin, Ro-31–8220, PD98059, SB203580, and 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) were obtained from Calbiochem. Human recombinant transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) was from Sigma. Normal human skin fibroblast cultures were established from punch biopsy of a voluntary healthy male donor (age, 23) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml of penicillin-G, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in similar medium except with 10% CS. For experiments, fibroblasts were maintained for 18 h in culture medium supplemented with 0.5% FCS. C2-ceramide was added alone or in combination with TGF-β1, and the incubations were continued for 24 h. In experiments involving chemical signaling inhibitors, these were added 1 h prior to C2-ceramide. Cell viability was determined with trypan blue exclusion as described previously (8Westermarck J. Ilvonen E. Kähäri V.-M. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 995-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from cells using the single-step method (12Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal.

The [32P]cDNA-mRNA hybrids were visualized by autoradiography, quantitated by scanning densitometry, and corrected for the levels of GAPDH mRNA in the same samples. Confluent NIH-3T3 fibroblast cultures were transiently transfected with 2 μg of human proα2(I) collagen promoter/CAT construct −376α2(I)/CAT (18Boast S. Su M.-W. Ramirez F. Sanchez M.

Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation method followed by a 2-min glycerol shock (11Reunanen N. Westermarck J. Häkkinen L. Holmström T.H. Elo I. Eriksson J.E.

Confluent human skin fibroblasts in medium containing 1% FCS were incubated without or with C2-ceramide (50 μm) for 6 h, RNA polymerase II inhibitor DRB (60 μm) was added, and the cultures were harvested at 6-h intervals for RNA extraction and determination of proα1(I) and proα2(I) collagen and GAPDH mRNA abundance by Northern blot hybridizations.

To determine the infection efficiency of normal human skin fibroblasts, cells in suspension were mixed with RAdlacZ at different multiplicities of infection, plated, incubated for 18 h in DMEM with 1% FCS, fixed, and stained for β-galactosidase activity (22Ahonen M. Baker A.H. Kähäri V.-M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2310-2315PubMed Google Scholar,23Ravanti L. Häkkinen L. Larjava H. Saarialho-Kere U. Foschi M. Han J. Kähäri V.-M. J. Biol.

In experiments, 5 × 105 cells in suspension were infected with RAd66, RAdlacZ, RAdMEK1ca, RAdMKK3bE, or RAdMKK6bE, at multiplicities of infection of 500 pfu/cell, which gives 100% transduction efficiency, plated, and incubated for 18 h. Culture medium with 10% FCS was replaced with one containing 1% FCS, the incubations continued for 24 h, and the cells were harvested for RNA extraction. In experiments involving PD98059, this was added to cultures at the time of infection. Fibroblasts (5 × 105) were infected with RAdlacZ, RAdMEK1ca, RAdMKK3bE, or RAdMKK6bE, incubated, and lysed in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were sonicated, fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Hybond ECL membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Western blotting was performed with phosphospecific antibodies for ERK1/2 and p38 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), in 1:1000 dilution, as described previously (11Reunanen N. Westermarck J.

As loading controls, the same samples were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies specific for total ERK1/2 and p38 (New England Biolabs). Binding of primary antibodies was detected with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized by ECL. Cells were infected with adenovirus constructs RAd66, RAdMEK1ca, RAdMKK3bE, and RAdMKK6bE, as described above, and incubated for 18 h. The medium was then changed to glutamine-free DMEM with 2% FCS and 50 μg/ml ascorbate, and the incubation was continued for 24 h. The medium was then replaced with a similar medium containing, in addition, [3H]proline (20 μCi/ml) and β-aminopropionitrile (50 μg/ml). After a 24-h incubation, the conditioned media were dialyzed against 1 mm EDTA, and aliquots were fractionated by SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was processed for fluorography and exposed against Kodak X-Omat film as described previously (24Kähäri V.-M. Vuorio T. Näntö-Salonen K. Vuorio E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 781: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Collagenous polypeptides were quantified densitometrically. We have recently shown that the TNF-α-generated lipid second messenger, C2-ceramide, induces expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 in human skin fibroblasts (11Reunanen N. Westermarck J. Häkkinen L. Holmström T.H. Elo I. Eriksson J.E. Kähäri V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5137-5145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). As TNF-α also potently suppresses the expression of type I collagen by dermal fibroblasts, we wanted to examine the role of the ceramide signaling pathway in this respect. Treatment of human skin fibroblasts with C2-ceramide for 24 h resulted in marked suppression of the expression of mRNAs for type I collagen α1 and α2 chains noted with concentrations of 25 μm, and maximal inhibition was observed at a 50 μm concentration (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, induction of MMP-1 mRNA levels was also noted with C2-ceramide treatment with a concentration of 25 μm, and the maximal induction was obtained with 50 μm (Fig. 1 A). Suppression of type I and III collagen mRNAs was first noted at 6 h of incubation and was nearly maximal at the 12-h time point (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, the inhibition of type I and III collagen mRNA expression by C2-ceramide was quite persistent, as it lasted at least 48 h (Fig. 1 B). C2-ceramide also entirely inhibited proα1(I) and proα1(III) collagen mRNA expression in the presence of TGF-β1, a potent up-regulator of collagen expression in fibroblasts (Fig. 1 C). Interestingly, TGF-β1 had no effect on C2-ceramide-elicited induction of MMP-1 mRNA levels, regardless of whether they were added to cultures 1 h before or after C2-ceramide (Fig.1 C). To determine whether the inhibitory effect of C2-ceramide on type I collagen expression takes place at the transcriptional level, we transiently transfected NIH-3T3 fibroblasts with the human proα2(I) collagen promoter/CAT construct −376α2(I)/CAT and subsequently treated the cells with C2-ceramide (50 μm) for 40 h. Assay of CAT activity revealed that C2-ceramide inhibited the activity of the proα2(I) collagen promoter by 55 ± 9% (mean ± S.E. of three independent transfections each performed in duplicate), as compared with the untreated control cells. Next, we also examined whether the down-regulatory effect of C2-ceramide on type I collagen mRNA expression also involves reduced stability of the corresponding mRNAs. A 6-h pretreatment of human skin fibroblasts with C2-ceramide (50 μm) followed by co-treatment in the presence of the RNA polymerase II inhibitor DRB revealed that the decay rate of proα1(I) and proα2(I) collagen mRNAs was accelerated in cells treated with C2-ceramide (Fig. 2,A and B). We have recently observed that the maximal activation of fibroblast MMP-1 expression by C2-ceramide requires coordinate activation of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 (11Reunanen N. Westermarck J. Häkkinen L. Holmström T.H. Elo I. Eriksson J.E. Kähäri V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5137-5145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To examine the roles of these MAPK pathways in the ceramide-elicited down-regulation of type I collagen expression, human skin fibroblasts were treated with C2-ceramide alone or in combination with the selective MEK1,2 inhibitor PD98059 and with a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. As noted above, treatment with C2-ceramide (100 μm) resulted in nearly total inhibition of the expression of mRNA levels for proα1(I) and proα2(I) collagen in comparison with untreated control cells (Fig.3 A). Interestingly, treatment of cells with the combination of PD98059 and SB203580 markedly inhibited C2-ceramide-elicited down-regulation of proα1(I) and proα2(I) collagen mRNA abundance (Fig.3 A). PD98059 alone had a slight inhibitory effect, and SB203580 alone did not alter the effect of C2-ceramide on type I collagen mRNA levels (Fig. 3 A). In comparison, the up-regulation of MMP-1 mRNA levels by C2-ceramide was potently inhibited (by 62%) by PD98059, as shown previously (11Reunanen N. Westermarck J. Häkkinen L. Holmström T.H. Elo I. Eriksson J.E. Kähäri V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5137-5145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Together, PD98059 and SB203580 entirely abrogated the induction of MMP-1 mRNA expression by C2-ceramide (Fig.3 A). Treatment with SB203580 or PD98059 had no effect on viability of the fibroblasts, as determined with trypan blue exclusion assay (not shown). Next, we further elucidated the signaling pathways mediating the inhibitory effect of the ceramide signaling pathway on type I collagen expression using chemical protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors. Interestingly, the down-regulation of proα1(I) and proα2(I) collagen mRNA abundance by C2-ceramide was entirely abrogated by PKC inhibitors H7 (50 μm) and Ro-31–8220 (1 μm) and also potently by staurosporine (25 nm) (Fig. 3 B). The induction of MMP-1 expression by C2-ceramide was also entirely inhibited by all three PKC inhibitors (Fig. 3 B). Treatment of fibroblasts with PKC inhibitors H7 and Ro-31–8220 reduced the number of viable cells by 12%, whereas 24-h treatment with staurosporine resulted in reduced viability of nearly all cells, as determined with trypan blue exclusion assay (not shown). To directly examine the role of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways in the regulation of the expression of the endogenous type I collagen genes, we used adenovirus-mediated gene delivery of constitutively active MEK1, MKK3b, and MKK6b to human skin fibroblasts. Transduction of cells with 500 pfu/cell of recombinant adenovirus RAdMEK1ca, harboring constitutively active MEK1, resulted in specific activation of endogenous ERK1/2, but not p38, as compared with control virus (RAdlacZ)-infected cells (Fig.4 A). Interestingly, simultaneous treatment of RAdMEK1ca-infected fibroblasts with the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 entirely inhibited activation of ERK1/2 (Fig.4 A). In parallel, transduction of cells with adenoviruses RAdMKK3bE and RAdMKK6bE bearing constitutively active MKK3b and MKK6b, respectively, resulted in specific activation of p38 and in reduction in the basal levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Fig. 4 A). Interestingly, the activation of ERK1/2 by constitutively active MEK1 resulted in marked reduction in the endogenous mRNA levels for proα1(I) (85%), proα2(I) (89%), and proα1(III) (81%) collagen, as compared with cells transduced with control virus RAdlacZ(Fig. 4 B). Inhibition of ERK1/2 activation with PD98059 almost completely restored the expression of type I and III collagen mRNAs in RAdMEK1ca-transduced fibroblasts (Fig.4 B). In contrast, adenovirus-mediated expression of constitutively active MKK3b slightly enhanced type I and III collagen mRNA abundance, and MKK6b alone had no marked effect (Fig.4 B). Next, we also determined the effect of ERK1/2 and p38 activation on collagen production by dermal fibroblasts. For this, the cells were transduced with empty control adenovirus RAd66, or with RAdMEK1ca, RAdMKK3bE, and RAdMKK6bE, and subsequently labeled with3H-labeled proline for 24 h in the presence of ascorbic acid and β-aminopropionitrile, followed by fractionation of equal aliquots of conditioned media by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 4 C, expression of constitutively active MEK1 in dermal fibroblasts entirely inhibited their proα1(I) and proα2(I) collagen production, and this inhibition was potently abrogated by simultaneous incubation of cells with the MEK1,2 inhibitor PD98059. Expression of constitutively active MKK3b had no marked effect on type I collagen production, and MKK6b even slightly (1.8-fold) up-regulated collagen production by fibroblasts. MAPKs mediate extracellular signals, which regulate cell growth, differentiation, survival, and death (see Ref. 25Westermarck J. Kähäri V.-M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). At present, the following three mammalian MAPK pathways have been characterized in detail: ERK1/2 pathway (Raf/MEK1, 2/ERK1,2), which is activated by mitogenic signals, JNK/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) (MEK kinase-1–4/MKK4,7/JNK1–3), and p38 (MAPK kinase kinase/MKK3,6/p38α,β) pathways, which are activated by inflammatory cytokines and cellular stress (see Ref. 25Westermarck J. Kähäri V.-M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the conserved threonine and tyrosine residues of MAPKs by specific upstream dual-specificity kinases (MAPK kinases) results in activation and nuclear translocation of MAPKs, which in turn phosphorylate and activate nuclear protein kinases, e.g. MAPK-activated protein kinases 1, -2, and -3 or transcription factors including Elk-1, c-Jun, and activating transcription factor-2 (see Ref. 25Westermarck J. Kähäri V.-M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). It has been shown that activation of the ERK1/2 cascade by constitutively active Raf-1 or MEK1 results in transformation of fibroblasts (26Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J.

In addition, blocking the ERK1/2 pathway with specific MEK1,2 inhibitor reverses the transformed phenotype of colon carcinoma cells in vitro and arrests their growth in vivo (30Sebolt-Leopold J.S.

In the present study, we show that activation of ceramide signaling pathway potently inhibits type I collagen gene expression in fibroblasts at the level of transcription and mRNA stability and that this effect requires PKC activity, as well as coordinate activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs. Furthermore, induction of MMP-1 mRNA expression by C2-ceramide was entirely abrogated by blocking both ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways, as well as inhibition of PKC activity. Together with our previous observations (11Reunanen N. Westermarck J. Häkkinen L. Holmström T.H. Elo I. Eriksson J.E. Kähäri V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5137-5145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), these results show that activation of the ceramide signaling pathway results in potent suppression of type I collagen expression and in induction of MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression in dermal fibroblasts, suggesting that in these cells ceramide pathway plays an important role in mediating the inhibitory effects of TNF-α on ECM deposition. To examine the specific roles of ERK1/2 and p38 pathways in the regulation of type I collagen expression we utilized adenovirus-mediated gene delivery of the constitutively active ERK1/2 activator MEK1 and p38 activators MKK3b and MKK6b to normal human skin fibroblasts. The results of these experiments clearly identify the ERK1/2 cascade as a potent negative regulatory pathway with respect to type I and III collagen expression. In contrast, p38 appears to serve as a weak positive regulator of type I and type III collagen expression, possibly because of reduction in the basal levels of activated ERK1/2 in cells expressing constitutively active MKK3b or MKK6b. These observations are in accordance with previous studies showing that blocking the ERK1/2 pathway by dominant negative Raf-1 enhances α1(I) collagen promoter activity in transiently transfected hepatic stellate cells (34Davis B.H. Chen A. Beno D.W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11039-11042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and that transformation of fibroblasts with oncogenic Ras, the upstream activator of Raf-1, results in suppression of type I collagen gene expression (35Slack J.L.

However, the effects of ERK1/2 activation on type I collagen expression appear to be cell-specific, as in human osteoblastic cells the ERK1/2 pathway mediates the stimulation of type I collagen gene expression by TGF-β and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (37Palcy S. Goltzman D. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and hypergravity (38Gebken J. Lüders B. Notbohm H. Klein H.H. Brinckmann J. Müller P.K. Bätge B. J. Biochem. 1999; 126: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, blocking the ERK1/2 pathway with PD98059 in part inhibits the up-regulation of type I collagen gene expression by insulin-like growth factor-1 in hepatic stellate cells (39Svegliati-Baroni G. Ridolf F. Di Sario A. Casini A. Marucci L. Gaggiotti G. Orlandoni P. Macarri G. Perego L. Benedetti A. Folli F. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1743-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Controlled deposition of collagenous ECM is an important feature of normal tissue development, growth, and repair, whereas excessive collagen accumulation results in destruction of normal tissue architecture and function, as detected e.g. in lung fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, keloids, and hypertrophic scars (1Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar).

GAT-1 maintains low synaptic concentrations of neurotransmitter by coupling GABA uptake to the fluxes of sodium and chloride. Here we identify a stretch of four amino acid residues predicted to lie in the juxtamembrane region prior to transmembrane domain 1 in the cytoplasmic amino-terminal tail of GAT-1, which is critical for its function.

Only when it is replaced by lysine, low activity levels (around 15% of those of the wild type) are observed. Using a reconstitution assay, we show that mutants in which this residue is replaced by lysine or histidine exhibit sodium- and chloride-dependent GABA exchange similar to the wild type. This indicates that these mutants are selectively impaired in the reorientation of the unloaded transporter, a step in the translocation cycle by which net flux and exchange differ.

This family includes transporters for biogenic amines, amino acids, and four different GABA transporters (for a review see Ref. 1Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The transporters maintain low synaptic levels of their neurotransmitter substrates, which is necessary for effective synaptic transmission. One of the most direct pieces of evidence for this comes from studies using dopamine transporter knock-out mice; the decay of extracellular dopamine in brain slices of such mice is about 100 times longer than normal (2Giros B. Jaber M. Jones S.R. Wightman R.M. Caron M.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar). GAT-1, the first member of the family to be identified, was purified to homogeneity in a form active upon reconstitution (3Radian R. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15437-15441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned (4Guastella J. Nelson N. Nelson H. Czyzyk L. Keynan S. Miedel M.C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kanner B.I.

GAT-1, as well as the other members of the family, is predicted to have twelve transmembrane domains linked by hydrophilic loops, with the amino and carboxyl termini residing inside the cell (4Guastella J.

Many aspects of this model were verified experimentally, although the topology of the amino-terminal third of the transporter was controversial (10Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) has been shown to affect transport activity and substrate specificity. GAT-1 transporters cleaved at the amino and carboxyl termini by proteases were fully functional and retained sodium and chloride dependence as well as electrogenicity (19Mabjeesh N.J. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2563-2568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To define the exact length of the domains that are essential for transport activity, mutants truncated at both termini were constructed. Substantial activity was retained when the carboxyl tail was almost completely removed, but when part of transmembrane domain 12 was removed along with the tail, transport activity was completely abolished. In the amino-terminal, a construct in which amino acids 3–41 (Δ3–42) were deleted was fully active. When the deletion was extended to include the amino acids up to residue 49 (Δ3–49) the truncated transporter was completely inactive (20Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study we have determined which of the residues in the amino-terminal tail, between position 42 and the first transmembrane domain, are essential for GAT-1 function. We have made deletion mutants at each of the positions and substitution mutants where the deletions were inactive. We find that arginine 44 and tryptophan 47, which are fully conserved throughout the family of sodium- and chloride-dependent neurotransmitter transporters, are critical for transport activity. Many of the mutants that were severely impaired in net flux of GABA show significant activity in a partial reaction of the transport cycle, namely, the exchange of radiolabeled for unlabeled GABA. [3H]GABA (40 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. NHS-SS-Biotin and streptavidin beads were obtained from Pierce (catalogue numbers 21331 and 20349, respectively).

Secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxide) was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (catalogue number 111-035-144). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. All mutations were made by site-directed mutagenesis of the wild type GAT-1 according to the Kunkel method as described (21Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zarkour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar, 22Kleinberger-Doron N. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3063-3067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutations were planned to include diagnostic restriction sites and were identified by restriction analysis. All of the mutations at position 44 and all other inactive mutations were subcloned back into the wild type using pairs of restriction enzymes that cut the cDNA at both sides of the mutation. The constructs were sequenced in both directions between these two restriction sites. For all other mutants at least two independent Escherichia coli colonies carrying the mutant plasmids were characterized by transport activity. Heterologous expression of the wild type and mutant transporters was done as follows: HeLa cells plated on 24-well plates were infected with recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus vTF (23Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar) and transfected with cDNA (pBluescript SK with the wild type or mutant transporter inserted downstream to the T7 promoter) using the transfection reagent DOTAP as described (24Keynan S. Suh H.-J. Kanner B.I. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1974-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Uptake of [3H]GABA into whole cells was assayed 18–20 h post transfection. The wells were washed twice with a solution containing 150 mm choline chloride, 5 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, and 0.3 mmCaCl2. Each well was then incubated with 0.4 μCi of [3H]GABA (40 Ci/mmol) in a NaCl transport solution (150 mm NaCl, with KPi, MgSO4, and CaCl2as above). Transport reactions were carried out for 10 min at room temperature, and the assay was terminated by washing the wells twice with ice-cold NaCl transport solution. Cells were lysed with 1% SDS, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Reconstitution of the transporters into liposomes was done as described (25Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1703-1708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For net flux the liposomes contained 120 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 5 mmTris-SO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgSO4, and 1% glycerol. The external medium consisted of 150 mm NaCl supplemented with 2.8 μmvalinomycin and 1 μCi of [3H]GABA (40 Ci/mmol). For exchange the internal medium of the liposomes contained 10 mm GABA, 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaPi, pH 7.4, and Tris-SO4, EDTA, MgSO4, and glycerol as above, unless indicated otherwise in the figure legends. The liposomes were passed over another spin column of identical composition but lacking the GABA. The control liposomes (without entrapped GABA) were also passed over a second spin column. The external medium contained 150 mm NaCl and 2 μCi of [3H]GABA unless stated otherwise in the figure legends. Exchange reactions were carried out for 2 min, which corresponds to the end of the linear phase of the uptake. Total protein concentration in the liposomes was determined by the Lowry method (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeling of wild type and mutant transporters at the cell surface, using NHS-SS-Biotin, was done as described by Chen et al. (27Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) with the following changes. First, HeLa cells were plated in 12-well plates, and all volumes were increased accordingly, except the elution of the biotinylated proteins from the streptavidin beads which was kept at 100 μl. Second, for samples of total cell transporter, cells plated in 24-well plates and transfected as described above were lysed on ice for 30 min in 200 μl of 1× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer/well. The lysates were collected to Eppendorf test tubes, heated to 85 °C for 10 min, sonicated for 10 s, centrifuged, and frozen at −70 °C until loading together with the biotinylated samples. Samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gel) and transferred to nitrocellulose. The GAT-1 protein was detected with affinity purified antibody to GAT-1 at a 1:1,000 dilution, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at a 1:40,000 dilution, and ECL. 1% of goat serum was present in all antibody, blocking, and washing solutions to minimize the appearance of nonspecific bands. Scanning and quantification of bands on the developed films was done using a Fluor-STM MultiImager scanner with MultiAnalyst software, both from Bio-Rad. To understand the role that the stretch between proline 42 and the first transmembrane domain (PDRDTWKGRFDF) plays in GABA transport, we first measured the separate contribution of each of these amino acids to transport activity. We made single deletion mutations of the amino acid residues by site-directed mutagenesis of the wild type (wt) GAT-1. The mutants were expressed in HeLa cells using the vaccinia/T7 recombinant virus and uptake of [3H]GABA was measured. Constructs with deletions of arginine 44, threonine 46, and tryptophan 47 (ΔR44, ΔT46, and ΔW47) are almost totally inactive, with less than 1% of residual activity (Fig. 1 A). Constructs ΔP42, ΔD43, ΔK48, ΔR50, and ΔF51 are active and retain levels of activity that range from 39 to 85% of the wt activity. ΔD45 has 16% and ΔG49 has 20% of the wt activity. The first transmembrane domain is predicted to start with phenylalanine 53 (4). Deletion of residues that are, according to the model, close to or within the lipid bilayer, results basically in loss of activity; ΔD52 shows 5% of wt activity, and all deletions beyond it that we tested (until leucine 57) are totally inactive (data not shown). The inactivity of the deletion mutants at positions 44, 46, and 47 is not due to a defect in synthesis; when immunoprecipitation was performed, the expression levels of the mutants did not differ from the wt (data not shown, but see the right half of Fig.2 for their steady state levels). We examined the possibility of a defect in trafficking of the mutants to the cell membrane by solubilization of HeLa cells expressing the mutants and their reconstitution into liposomes. Measuring [3H]GABA uptake into the proteoliposomes can detect activity of transporters that were trapped in intracellular membranes. Fig. 1 B shows the level of radioactive GABA uptake into proteoliposomes obtained from the wt and mutants between positions 44 and 49. As can be seen, no significant elevation of activity is detected in ΔR44, ΔT46, ΔW47, ΔK48, and ΔG49. Only ΔD45 shows a significant increase in transport activity (Fig. 1). These results indicate that there is probably no defect in the targeting of ΔR44, ΔT46, and ΔW47 to the plasma membrane. To visualize the wt and mutant GABA transporters at the cell membrane directly, we labeled cell surface proteins using NHS-SS-Biotin. This nonpermeant biotinylation reagent modifies lysines located in extracellular domains of membrane proteins (14Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 28Barker E.L. Moore K.R. Rakshan F. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4705-4717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biotinylated proteins are recovered by incubation with streptavidin-agarose beads and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and GAT-1 is detected using a specific antibody. For every construct tested we ran both a biotinylated sample and a total cell lysate sample that was not subjected to biotin labeling or streptavidin purification. The results are shown in Fig. 2. In the total sample of the wild type transporter, the main form is a doublet band of ∼50 kDa that represents the glycosylated form of the transporter (10Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The adjacent lane shows the total sample of a mutant in which all three N-linked glycosylation consensus sequences have been removed (mutant DDD; Ref.10Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Here the doublet band is observed but its mobility is increased. The reason for the appearance of a doublet band in both the wild type and the aglyco-transporter is not clear; one possible explanation is that the lower band represents a proteolytic product. In the biotinylated wild type sample an additional form is observed, which runs as a wide band of ∼60 kDa. This is a form of the transporter found preferentially at the cell membrane and apparently represents the mature form of GAT-1. In addition, in both the total and the biotinylated samples, small amounts of a dimer form and sometimes also a high molecular weight aggregate form are observed. These latter forms are also seen in immunoprecipitation experiments (10Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The specificity of the antibody is seen in lanes labeled SK; when the cells are transfected with the vector alone, no bands are detected in the total or the biotinylated samples. Moreover, when the antibody was preincubated with the peptide against which it was raised, these bands were not observed (data not shown). The specificity of the biotinylation reaction was seen when cells expressing the wt transporters underwent all the labeling steps without NHS-SS-Biotin present. No transporter was observed in the fraction eluted from the streptavidin beads, and this indicates that there is no nonspecific binding of GAT-1 to the beads and that all the transporter detected in the biotinylated fraction is indeed labeled with biotin (data not shown). To make sure that in the vaccinia-based expression system used here, the biotinylation reagent modifies only proteins at the plasma membrane, we have stripped some of the blots and reprobed them with an antibody against calnexin, an endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein. As expected, calnexin was present in the total fractions but depleted in the biotinylated fractions (data not shown). The total and biotinylated fractions of the deletion mutants ΔR44, ΔD45, ΔT46, and ΔW47 are also shown in Fig. 2. The mutants do not differ from the wt in the levels of total cell transporter or in the mobility of the bands, and the same is true for the biotinylated samples. In addition to the mature form, the glycosylated form also reaches the plasma membrane, and the proportion of both bands is similar in all the constructs shown. In contrast to what is seen in the wild type and deletion mutants, the composition of the biotinylated and total samples of the aglyco-mutant is similar. Thus, although glycosylation appears to be a prerequisite for the formation of the mature form, it is not required for targeting to the membrane, at least in the expression system used here. To quantify the membrane targeting of mutants relative to the wt, we scanned between two and four developed films for each mutant, from different experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”). The ratio between the intensities of the biotinylated and the total sample of each construct was calculated, and this value was compared between the wt and the mutants. Alternatively, the intensities of the biotinylated fractions alone were compared. The intensities of the biotinylated form of the mutants relative to that of the wild type varied between experiments. For example, the biotinylated form of ΔR44 ranges from 50 to 140% of the wt. Other mutants range from 100 to 150% of the wild type. These values are similar for both methods of comparison. We conclude that although the mutants are not targeted to the membrane at exactly the same level as the wt, they are not expressed at levels consistently lower than the wt. Therefore, the inactivity of the mutants is not due to a targeting defect but to an intrinsic change in the transporter.Figure 2Cell surface biotinylation of wild type and deletion mutants at positions 44–47. HeLa cells expressing the wild type and indicated mutants were labeled and processed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The first seven lanesshow the biotinylated samples, and the subsequent lanes show the total samples. The first lanes of each group show biotinylated and total samples from HeLa cells expressing the vector alone. All samples were separated on the same SDS gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each biotinylated lane represents the lysate from one confluent well in a 12-well plate, and each total lane represents 15% of the lysate from one confluent well in a 24-well plate. The positions of the molecular mass standards are indicated at the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To understand why the deletion of amino acids at positions 44–47 leads to such a pronounced drop in activity, we made a number of substitution mutations at each of these positions. Transport of [3H]GABA into whole cells expressing these mutants is shown in Fig.3 A. As can be seen, replacement of arginine by serine or histidine at position 44 restores no transport activity. Partial activity (around 15% of the wt) is restored only when lysine substitutes for the arginine (R44K). At position 45 the negatively charged aspartic acid can be replaced by a polar residue (serine) or by a hydrophobic residue (leucine), yielding 44 and 56% of the wt activity, respectively. At position 46, within the transporter family there are either polar or positive residues. When replaced by a polar (T46N or T46S) or even hydrophobic (T46I) residue, over 85% of wt activity is seen. At position 47, replacement of tryptophan by the uncharged serine or the hydrophobic valine does not restore activity. Only in the case of W47F and W47Y, where the substitutions have an aromatic ring, activity of over 100% of wt levels is observed. The inactive substitution mutants R44S, R44H, W47S, and W47V and the partially active R44K were further examined as described above for the deletion mutants. First, these mutants were reconstituted into liposomes, and uptake of [3H]GABA was measured. Fig. 3 B shows the uptake activity for each of the mutants. R44S is inactive, whereas both R44H and R44K show a distinct gain in activity. R44H is elevated from 3.3 ± 1.2% (n = 6) to 15.4 ± 6.9% (n = 3), and R44K from 14.6 ± 3.4% (n = 11) to 34.2 ± 1.6% (n = 4) of the wt activity. In contrast, no gain in activity is seen in W47S and W47V. Transporter synthesis and targeting to the cell membrane was determined for these mutants using NHS-SS-Biotin labeling, exactly as described above for the deletion mutants. There was no difference between the wt and the mutants in the amount of total cell transporter synthesized or in the mobility of this form (data not shown). The biotinylated, mature plasma membrane form is seen in all of the mutants, and the bands were quantified as described above. Variability between experiments is seen here too, and the biotinylated form of R44S, for example, ranges from 65 to over 200% of the wt. The other mutants also show a range of expression that is close to or above wt expression. Thus, the inactivity (or partial activity, in the case of R44K) of these mutants is not due to faulty targeting to the plasma membrane but to an intrinsic change in transporter function that is caused by the mutation itself. To determine how the mutations affect transporter function, we examined the affinity of the active replacement mutants to each of the substrates of GAT-1. The sodium affinity for the mutants and the wt was determined by measuring uptake of radioactive GABA into HeLa cells with increasing concentrations of sodium. Fig.4 shows the profiles obtained for the wt, D45L, and R44K. As can be seen, D45L gives rise to a curve that is identical in shape to that of the wt. All the other mutants, with the exception of R44K, also exhibit sodium dependences identical to the wt, but they are not shown to simplify the figure. In contrast, R44K shows a clear shift in apparent sodium affinity, which is most marked at low sodium concentrations. The chloride affinity for the wt and the mutants was also determined by measuring uptake of radioactive GABA into HeLa cells with increasing concentrations of chloride. There was no difference between the wt and the mutants (data not shown). Next, the apparent K m for GABA and theV max of the transport reaction were determined for the wt and one active substitution at each of the positions. The results are shown in Table I. W47F does not differ significantly from the wt in either theK m or the V max. D45L shows a 3-fold decrease in K m, with a 5-fold decrease inV max, and T46I shows a 2-fold increase inK m with a similar increase inV max. R44K shows the most marked change of all the constructs examined; the K m is decreased almost 6-fold in comparison with the wt, and the V maxis decreased 40-fold.Table IKinetic constants for GABA uptakeWild typeR44KD45LT46IW47FK m1.40 ± 0.160.25 ± 0.010.42 ± 0.143.06 ± 0.351.48 ± 0.14V max6.47 ± 2.280.16 ± 0.071.29 ± 0.1415.74 ± 5.167.22 ± 2.55HeLa cells were transfected with the wild type and indicated active substitution mutations as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Transport was measured at GABA concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 2.5 μm.

We expressed trimeric envelope glycoprotein from three primary, macrophage tropic HIV-1 isolates in baby hamster kidney cells and analyzed the furin-mediated cleavage, stability, and receptor binding properties of the oligomers. The envelope glycoprotein was secreted in a soluble form deleted of its transmembrane anchor and the intracytoplasmic domain (gp140). A mixture of trimers, dimers, and monomers of gp140 as well as monomeric gp120 was detected on polyacrylamide gels. Analysis by sucrose gradient centrifugation revealed that trimers and dimers were essentially composed of uncleaved gp140, whereas most of the gp120 was found in the monomeric fraction. To analyze the effect of the cleavage of gp140 to gp120/Δ41 on trimerization, we co-expressed the furin protease along with gp140. Surprisingly, furin expression changed the subcellular localization of the envelope glycoprotein, which became in majority sequestered in the major furin compartment, the trans-Golgi network, as judged by confocal laser microscopy. The envelope glycoprotein secreted from furin-co-expressing cells was almost completely cleaved to gp120 and Δgp41, but gp120 was found exclusively in the monomeric fraction, with a few residual oligomers being composed of uncleaved gp140. Secreted uncleaved gp140 trimers were purified to homogeneity and analyzed for their capacity to interact with cellular receptors CD4 and CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5). Receptor binding was analyzed on CD4- and CCR5-expressing cells as well as on peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Trimers showed greatly reduced binding to CD4 as compared with monomers. Neither monomers nor trimers bound directly to CCR5. In conclusion, our results show that the cleaved form of the envelope glycoprotein does not form stable trimers, suggesting that gp120/gp41 oligomers on the virion surface might be stabilized by a yet to be identified mechanism and that the virion might attach to CD4 via a monomeric form of gp120.

The gp41 glycoprotein includes a fusion peptide and an ectodomain that is implicated in trimerization (8Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C.

Crystallization studies suggest that the core of the fusion-active envelope oligomer is a trimeric structure of 36 amino acids located toward the N terminus of gp41 (10Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar). This sequence forms an interior, parallel coiled-coil trimer, whereas three helices of a sequence closer to the C terminus of gp41 pack in an oblique, antiparallel manner into highly conserved, hydrophobic grooves on the surface of this trimer. This structure resembles the low pH-induced conformation of influenza hemagglutinin. The gp120 and gp41 glycoproteins are held together by noncovalent interactions between the gp41 ectodomain and discontinuous structures composed of N- and C-terminal gp120 sequences (11Helseth E. Olshevsky U. Furman C. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2119-2123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When they reach the infected cell surface, a fraction of these envelope glycoprotein complexes is incorporated into budding virus particles. gp120/gp41 complexes on the virion surface as well as at the plasma membrane of infected cells are functional as they can mediate fusion with CD4+/CCR5+ cells. Given their non-covalent association, these complexes can disassemble, releasing gp120 and exposing the previously buried gp41 ectodomain.

Binding to CD4 is a major determinant of HIV tropism in vivo, illustrated by the presence of CD4 on the surface of the main target cells,e.g. T lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and brain microglia.

Polymerase chain reaction fragments coding for the envelope sequences and CD4 were digested with BamHI, polymerase chain reaction fragments amplified from pGEMhfur were digested with BssHII and NsiI, and the SFV vector plasmid pSFV-1 (36Berglund P.

Fragments were purified and ligated with cut pSFV-1 or pSFV-2, resulting in plasmids pSFVΔenvBX08, pSFVΔenvBX17, pSFVΔenvE402, pSFVCD4, pSFVCCR5, and pSFVhfur. Plasmid pSFVlacZ was a gift from Peter Liljeström and Henrik Garoff (37Liljeström P. Garoff H. Biotechnology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). BHK-21 cells were grown in tissue culture flasks (Falcon) at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in GMEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 20 mm Hepes (Life Technologies, Inc.), tryptose phosphate broth (10%), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% fetal calf serum (FCS; Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombinant defective SFV particles were synthesized as described previously (36Berglund P. Sjoberg M. Garoff H. Atkins G.J. Sheahan B.J. Liljeström P. Biotechnology. 1993; 11: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 37Liljeström P. Garoff H. Biotechnology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmids pSFV-helper2, pSFVΔenvBX08, pSFVΔenvBX17, pSFVΔenvE402, pSFVCD4, pSFVCCR5, pSFVlacZ, and pSFVhfur were digested with SpeI or SphI (pSFVΔenvE402), purified, and in vitrotranscribed using SP6 RNA polymerase in a buffer containing cap analog. After analysis of RNAs on agarose gels, pSFV-helper2-derived RNA was admixed to equal quantities of RNA derived from plasmids pSFVΔenvBX08, pSFVΔenvBX17, pSFVΔenvE402, pSFVCD4, or pSFVCCR5. The RNA mixtures were added to 8 × 106 BHK-21 cells in 800 μl of PBS and immediately transferred to a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette (Eurogentec). The RNA-cell mixture was subjected to two 0.4-ms pulses at 830 V and 25 microfarads in a Bio-Rad gene pulser and plated into 75-cm2 flasks in GMEM medium containing 5% FCS. 24 h later the supernatant containing recombinant defective SFV particles was harvested, concentrated by ultracentrifugation, and separated into aliquots. Before infection aliquots were activated by chymotrypsin digestion. For infection with recombinant SFV, cells were washed with serum-free GMEM and incubated with dilutions of viral particles in 2% GMEM for 1 h at 37 °C followed by incubation in 5% FCS GMEM. At 6 h post-infection, the medium was replaced by 0% FCS GMEM for standard protein purification and by 0% FCS methionine free-DMEM containing 35S-labeled methionine for the production of radiolabeled gp140. Synthesis of gp140 was continued up to 24 h post-infection. Supernatants of SFVΔenv-infected BHK cells were harvested at 24 h post-infection, centrifuged at low speed to pellet cellular debris, and concentrated approximately 30-fold in Vivaspin concentration units (cut off 100 kDa). To cross-link gp140 oligomers, the supernatant was incubated with 5 mm ethylene glycolbis(sulfosuccinimidylsucccinate) (sulfo-EGS) (Pierce) in 20 mm Hepes for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by incubation in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for 15 min at room temperature. Sucrose gradients (5–20%) were prepared as described previously (2Earl P.L. Doms R.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Approximately 600 μl of concentrated untreated or cross-linked supernatant was carefully added to the top of the gradient followed by ultracentrifugation in a SW41 rotor at 37,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C. Fractions were collected at 2 ml/min from the bottom of the tube using a capillary hooked on a peristaltic pump (Gilson). Fractions were deposited on SDS-PAGE gradient gels and analyzed by Western blot. Protein concentration was determined by Western blot using gp140MN as a standard. If necessary, corresponding fractions were pooled, diluted in PBS, and concentrated in low binding Centriplus® units (Amicon). All samples were taken up in 1× Laemmli buffer and 300 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm dithiothreitol was added under reducing conditions. gp140s were separated on 4–12% SDS-PAGE gradient gels (Novex). Gels containing 35S-labeled proteins were fixed in 45% methanol and 10% acetic acid, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Storm 220, Molecular Dynamics). Intensity of labeled bands was analyzed by ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Western blot was performed by transferring proteins to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were saturated in Tris-buffered saline with Tween containing 5% skim milk before incubation with mouse anti-gp120 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) (V3) K24 (2 μg/ml) or F5.5 (2 μg/ml) (Laboratoire d'Ingénierie des Anticorps, Institut Pasteur), mouse anti-gp41 mAb 41A (2 μg/ml) (Laboratoire d'Ingénierie des Anticorps), or human anti-gp120 mAbs 2G12 (2 μg/ml) (16Trkola A.

Bound primary antibodies were revealed with species-specific peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Vector) using diaminobenzidine as substrate. BHK cells were infected with SFVCD4 or SFVCCR5 for 12 h and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde before incubation with PBS containing 5% normal horse serum. Subsequently, cells were incubated with mAb Q4120 directed against CD4 (40Healey D. Dianda L. Moore J.P. McDougal J.S. Moore M.J. Estess P. Buck D. Kwong P.D. Beverley P.C. Sattentau Q.J. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) or mAb 182 directed against CCR5 (R&D Systems). Specific binding was detected by FITC-labeled secondary antibodies. BHK cells were infected separately (MOI 5) or co-infected with SFVΔenvBX08 (MOI 5) and SFVhfur (MOI 1) for 12 h and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 15 min and permeabilized by incubation with 0.1% Triton in PBS at room temperature for 4 min. Then cells were washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with 5% normal horse serum in PBS. Subsequently, cells were incubated simultaneously with human mAb 2G12 (2 μg/ml) and mouse mAb MON-152 (1 μg/ml) directed against human furin (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA). Specific binding was detected by simultaneous incubation with anti-human IgG FITC-labeled antibody and anti-mouse IgG biotin-labeled antibody + avidin-rhodamine-labeled antibody (Vector). Labeled cells were analyzed with a Zeiss confocal laser microscope. For binding studies, BHK cells were infected at a MOI 5 with SFVCD4, SFVCCR5, or SFVlacZfor 12 h, washed 2× with GMEM 0% FCS, and incubated with ligands for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation with ligand, cells were washed 3 times with serum-free medium and incubated in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1%Triton X-100 with 1% sodium deoxycholate, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and cell-associated radioactivity was counted in biodegradable counting scintillant (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a liquid scintillation counter (Rackbeta, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified unlabeled gp120IIIB (Medical Research Council) or gp140MN (Aventis-Pasteur) were incubated on cells at 1 to 20 μg/ml in serum-free medium, washed, and fixed with methanol for 5 min at −20 °C. To detect bound glycoprotein, cells were incubated with mAb K24 at 2 μg/ml followed by incubation with125I-labeled anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 fragment. Radiolabeled secondary antibody was detached by incubation in lysis buffer.35S-Labeled purified oligomers and monomers of gp140 were incubated on cell monolayers at various concentrations for 30 min at 37 °C, after which the cells were washed, lysed, and counted. BHK cells infected with SFVCCR5 or SFVlacZ were incubated with125I-labeled MIP-1β (12000 cpm; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) alone or together with various concentrations of cold MIP-1β for 30 min at 37 °C and then washed, lysed, and counted. Human PBMC used for binding studies were isolated according to standard procedures on Ficoll-Paque® (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) cushions, stimulated with 1 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (Murex) for 3 days. PBMC (106 cells) were incubated with35S-labeled gp140BX08 monomers and dimers or trimers at various concentrations in a total volume of 200 μl of PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Control cells were preincubated for 30 min with 10 μg/ml mAb Q4120 directed against CD4. Binding was further controlled by preincubating 35S-labeled gp140BX08 monomers, dimers, or trimers at 1 μg/ml with soluble CD4 at 20 μg/ml. Soluble envelope glycoproteins (gp140) from three different HIV-1 isolates corresponding to clades A, B, and E were cloned and expressed in the Semliki Forest virus expression system (36Berglund P. Sjoberg M. Garoff H. Atkins G.J. Sheahan B.J. Liljeström P. Biotechnology. 1993; 11: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 38Meanger J. Peroulis I. Mills J. Biotechniques. 1997; 23: 432-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The expressed sequences, which include the entire gp120 region and the extracellular domain of gp41, correspond to gp160: amino acids 1 to 692 of isolate BX17, amino acids 1 to 666 of isolate BX08, and amino acids 1 to 679 of isolate E402. Envelope glycoproteins were expressed in BHK cells infected with recombinant vectors SFVΔenvBX17, SFVΔenvBX08, or SFVΔenvE402. gp140 could be detected in infected cells (data not shown) and in supernatants at approximately 1 to 5 μg/106 cells. Five different forms of the envelope glycoprotein could be visualized by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. The size of these different molecules was calculated based on migration of molecular weight markers identifying the main forms as trimers and dimers as well as monomers of uncleaved gp140, cleaved gp120, and Δgp41 (Fig.1 A). Oligomerization patterns of gp140 from the different isolates were very similar, although the gp140BX17 and gp140E402 bands migrated slightly faster than gp140BX08, possibly due to reduced glycosylation of these envelopes. Furthermore, cleavage of gp140BX17 and gp140E402 seemed to be less efficient, as demonstrated by the low level of gp120 in supernatants (Fig. 1 A). When supernatants from gp140BX08-secreting cells were analyzed on sucrose gradients (5 to 20%), different oligomeric and monomeric forms could be resolved. In addition to the main molecular entities (trimers, dimers, monomers), the existence of intermediate forms between monomers and dimers and dimers and trimers could be observed. Oligomers with a higher molecular weight than trimers, possibly tetramers, could also be detected (Fig. 1 B). About half of the secreted glycoprotein was present in the cleaved form (gp120). To find out whether gp140BX08 was secreted from cells as oligomers and subsequently disassembled into monomers before harvest of the supernatant at 24 h post-infection (p.i.), we performed the following time-course experiment. Secreted oligomers were collected in 3-h intervals until 36 h p.i. Samples from different time points were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoprecipitated with mAbs F5.5 and 41A (data not shown). At all time points, the supernatant was composed of a mixture of different forms of envelope glycoprotein-containing trimers, dimers, and monomers at the same ratio. No increase of monomeric forms was found in samples corresponding to the late time points (24–36 h p.i.) compared with samples from early time points (0–6 h p.i.), suggesting that monomers did not stem from disassembled oligomers but were already secreted as monomers. Mixed preparations of oligomers and monomers of gp140BX08, gp140BX17, and gp140E402 were probed with monoclonal antibodies known for their specificity for either linear or conformation-dependent epitopes. gp140BX08 and gp140E402, but not gp140BX17, could be immunoprecipitated by anti-V3-loop mAbs K24 and F5.5. All three isolates could be immunoprecipitated by anti-CD4 binding site antibody 110K as well as conformation-dependent antibodies 2G12 (16Trkola A. Purtscher M. Muster T. Ballaun C. Buchacher A.

McCutchan F. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3807-3815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that oligomers possessed a native conformation (data not shown). Consequently, recognition of gp140 or gp120 by 2G12 and 670D was greatly diminished when proteins were denatured and analyzed under reducing conditions. To identify whether oligomers were composed of uncleaved gp140BX08 or cleaved gp120/Δgp41, sucrose gradient fractions corresponding to trimers or dimers were treated with reducing agents and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. This experiment revealed that the trimers did not contain gp120 and that they were exclusively made of uncleaved gp140 (Fig. 1 C). Monomeric Δgp41 was not detected because of filtrat"
https://openalex.org/W2101636948,"Vascular injury after balloon angioplasty results in the rapid activation of platelets leading to the release of growth factors and vasoactive substances. In addition, up-regulation of tissue factor (TF) and an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been detected at sites of vascular injury. We investigated whether platelet-derived products (PDP) released from activated human platelets increase ROS production, resulting in the induction of TF expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC). PDP induced a time- and concentration-dependent increase in ROS generation in cultured SMC that was mediated mainly by PDGF-AB and TGF-β1 and impaired by the flavin inhibitor diphenylene iodonium. Increased ROS formation was associated with enhanced mRNA levels of the small NAD(P)H oxidase subunit p22phox or its smooth muscle isoform. Transient transfection with a p22phox antisense vector decreased PDP-induced ROS generation. PDP up-regulated TF mRNA expression, which was redox sensitive and reduced by transfection of the p22phox antisense vector. In addition, PDP-stimulated reporter gene activity of two TF promoter constructs was decreased by coexpression of the p22phox antisense vector. These results indicate that activated platelets up-regulate TF expression and that this response involves ROS generation and a p22phox-containing NAD(P)H oxidase in SMC.–Görlach, A., Brandes, R.

https://openalex.org/W4241661968,"Numerous lines of evidence indicate that some of the neurotoxicity associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is due to proteolytic fragments of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Most research has focused on the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta). However, the possible role of other cleaved products of APP is less clear. We have previously shown that a recombinant carboxy-terminal 105 amino acid fragment (CT 105) of APP induced strong nonselective inward currents in Xenopus oocyte; it also revealed neurotoxicity in PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons, blocked later phase of long-term potentiation in rat hippocampus in vivo, and induced memory deficits and neuropathological changes in mice. We report here that the pretreatment with CT 105 for 24 h at a 10 microM concentration increases intracellular calcium concentration by about twofold in SK-N-SH and PC 12 cells, but not in U251 cells, originated from human glioblastoma. In addition, the calcium increase and toxicity induced by CT 105 were reduced by cholesterol and MK 801 in SK-N-SH and PC 12 cells, whereas the toxicity of Abeta(1-42) was attenuated by nifedipine and verapamil. CT 105 rendered SK-N-SH cells and rat primary cortical neurons more vulnerable to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Also, conformational studies using circular dichroism experiments showed that CT 105 has approximately 15% of beta-sheet content in phosphate buffer and aqueous 2,2, 2-trifluoroethanol solutions. However, the content of beta-sheet conformation in dodecyl phosphocholine micelle or in the negatively charged vesicles, is increased to 22%-23%. The results of this study showed that CT 105 disrupts calcium homeostasis and renders neuronal cells more vulnerable to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, and that some portion of CT 105 has partial beta-sheet conformation in various environments, which may be related to the self-aggregation and toxicity. This may be significantly possibly involved in inducing the neurotoxicity characteristic of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2083271901,"Enteropathogenic Yersinia bacteria trigger the production of the proinflammatory chemokine IL-8, an important chemokine for the recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Yersinia is resistant to phagocytosis by PMN, and the recruitment of these cells is thought to be part of a pathogenic strategy of Yersinia to establish infection by allowing the pathogen to gain access to, and disseminate within, host tissue. We report here that Yersinia expressing the outer membrane protein invasin triggers IL-8 production in epithelial cells. The 195 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of invasin when linked to latex beads are sufficient to trigger IL-8 production. By means of IL-8 promoter reporter gene assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments, the minimal optimal region of the IL-8 promoter responsive to invasin was identified and invasin-responsive control elements were characterized. Invasin-induced activation of the IL-8 promoter was found to be mediated through a previously identified NF-кB element. This NF-κB binding site preferentially binds Rel p65-p65 homodimers as well as some p50-p65 heterodimers in response to stimulation by invasin. Invasin-induced NF-κB activation correlated with degradation of IκBα and the inhibition of NF-κB by specific inhibitors of IκB activation blocked invasin-induced IL-8 secretion. Invasin-triggered IL-8 production does not depend on invasin-triggered uptake of bacteria, and is independent of a functional PI3-kinase. This report is the first to demonstrate the molecular basis of IL-8 production triggered by enteropathogenic bacteria. Together, these data elucidate the possible early pathomechanisms operating in Yersinia infection and may have implications for the design of novel therapeutics directed against this enteropathogen.–Schulte, R., Grassl, G.

The pan-COX inhibitor ketorolac continuously and significantly decreased PGE2 production and IL-6 and IL-8 levels in all OPC cell lines tested, but did not affect IL-1a, GM-CSF levels, or in vitro tumor cell growth. In contrast, ketorolac reduced OPC growth in vivo. The OPC cell lines used express the IL-6 receptor, and IL-6 stimulation of these cells causes transduction to occur via STAT3 pathway activation. Coincubation with OPC cell lines with conditioned medium from a TPA-exposed HL-60 cells stimulated growth proportional to the IL-6 levels measured in the conditioned medium. This growth effect was specifically inhibited by anti-IL-6 antibody. These results are consistent with cytokine products of inflammatory cells having paracrine growth effects on OPC. If chronic inflammation plays a role in promoting the development of OPC, this mechanism may also apply to other epithelial tumor systems modulated by COX activity.–Hong, S. H., Ondrey, F.

Previous studies have implicated protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) HA2, a homologue of PTPase 1B, in the signaling cascade initiated by the differentiation inducers. Vanadate, a potent PTPase inhibitor, blocks adipocyte differentiation at an early stage in the program, but has no effect on the mitotic clonal expansion required for differentiation. Exposure of preadipocytes to vanadate along with the inducing agents led to the accumulation of pp35, a phosphotyrosyl protein that is a substrate for PTPase HA2. pp35 was purified to homogeneity and shown by amino acid sequence and mass analyses of tryptic peptides to be c-Crk, a known cytoplasmic target of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor tyrosine kinase. Transfection of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with a c-Crk antisense RNA expression vector markedly reduced c-Crk levels and prevented differentiation into adipocytes. Studies with C3G, a protein that binds to the SH3 domain in c-Crk, showed that phosphorylation of c-Crk rendered the SH3 domain inaccessible to C3G.

Thus, when caloric intake exceeds expenditure, metabolite flux is diverted into triglyceride synthesis for storage in adipocytes. Conversely, when caloric expenditure exceeds intake, this triglyceride reserve is mobilized as free fatty acids to provide physiological fuel for use by other tissue/cell types. The need for an energy reserve begins at birth when the newborn must be prepared to survive periods of energy deprivation. Adipocytes, which provide this reserve, develop late in embryonic life, with major expansion of this cell population occurring after birth. The adipose lineage arises from the same multipotent stem cells of mesodermal origin that give rise to the muscle and cartilage lineages. Established preadipocyte cell lines, e.g. the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, which can be induced to differentiate into adipocytes in cell culture, provide faithful models with which to investigate the adipocyte differentiation program (1Green H.

When exposed to the appropriate differentiation inducers, including IGF-1 1 (or insulin at a non-physiologically high concentration), dexamethasone (a glucocorticoid), and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (MIX; a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases intracellular cAMP), 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiate into cells that express the adipocyte phenotype (6Student A.K.

Induction of the adipocyte differentiation program involves at least three different signal transduction systems, including those mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and the IGF-1 receptor (6Student A.K.

Once adipocyte gene expression has been initiated, further stimulation with differentiation inducers is no longer required. Although the transcriptional activation of adipocyte-specific genes during differentiation has been studied intensively (17Christy R.J. Yang V.W. Ntambi J.M. Geiman D.E. Landschulz W.H. Friedman A.D.

Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar), far fewer studies have been conducted on the signal transduction pathways by which the differentiation inducers act. Upon exposure to these inducers, confluent growth-arrested preadipocytes synchronously reenter the cell cycle and undergo approximately two rounds of mitosis (25Bernlohr D.A. Bolanowski M.A. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5563-5567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), referred to as “mitotic clonal expansion.” Mitotic clonal expansion is required for progression through subsequent steps in the differentiation program (26Petal Y.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1279-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Tang Q. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2231-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). It appears that DNA replication and chromatin remodeling during mitotic clonal expansion rendercis-elements accessible to the trans-acting factors that activate (or derepress) transcription of genes critical to progression of the differentiation program (9MacDougald O.M. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). The requirement of IGF-1 (or a high level of insulin, which can also activate the IGF-1 receptor) as a differentiation inducer for 3T3-L1 preadipocytes implicated tyrosine phosphorylation in the induction process, as the IGF-1 receptor is a ligand-activated tyrosine kinase (8Smith P.J. Wise L.S. Berkowitz R. Wan C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9402-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that the expression of PTPase HA2 is both regulated during and required for differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (28Liao K. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12123-12132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The expression of PTPase HA2 increases dramatically for 2 days following induction of differentiation and then decreases (28Liao K. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12123-12132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, constitutive overexpression of PTPase HA2 by 3T3-L1 preadipocytes transfected with a PTPase HA2 expression vector blocks differentiation. Importantly, however, exposure of the transfected preadipocytes to vanadate (a potent PTPase inhibitor) at the time when the endogenous PTPase is normally down-regulated during differentiation, i.e. following clonal expansion, fully restores their capacity to differentiate into adipocytes (28Liao K. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12123-12132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Exposure to vanadate at any other time during the differentiation program, however, fails to restore differentiation. Moreover, inhibition of PTPase HA2 activity with vanadate in untransfected 3T3-L1 cells (between days 0 and 2 of the standard differentiation protocol) also blocks differentiation (28Liao K. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12123-12132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that fluctuation of PTPase HA2 activity early in the differentiation program is both regulated during and required for adipocyte differentiation. Thus, it appears that a protein, phosphorylated by the IGF-1 receptor, is generated early in the program and is subsequently dephosphorylated by PTPase HA2. Conceivably, the coordinated sequential actions of the IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase and PTPase HA2 generate a signal required for the induction process. In this work, we provide evidence that c-Crk (cellularCT10 regulator of kinase), abona fide substrate of the IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase, functions “early” in the induction of adipocyte differentiation. Our results suggest that signaling, initiated by IGF-1 and mediated by c-Crk, involves tyrosine phosphorylation, followed by dephosphorylation. It appears that in the phosphorylated state, the SH3 domain of c-Crk is blocked due to an intramolecular interaction of the SH2 domain with the phosphotyrosyl group, thereby preventing its interaction with a putative downstream signaling molecule. Presumably, dephosphorylation by PTPase HA2 would allow this interaction to occur at the appropriate time in the differentiation program. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-Crk antibody was from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-C3G antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody, sodium vanadate, dexamethasone, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, and insulin were purchased from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was from Life Technologies, Inc., and the Bio-Scale DEAE 10 column was from Bio-Rad. The HiTrap heparin column (1 ml), the Resource-Q column (1 ml), the Superose 12 column (HR 10/30), and the FPLC unit were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum and allowed to reach confluence. Differentiation of 2-day post-confluent preadipocytes (designated as day 0) was initiated with 1 μg/ml insulin, 1 μmdexamethasone, and 0.5 mm MIX in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (6Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Reed B.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). After 48 h (day 2), the culture medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 μg/ml insulin, and the cells were then fed every other day with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cytoplasmic triglyceride droplets were visible by day 4, and cells were fully differentiated by day 8. For vanadate treatment, 20 μm sodium vanadate was added to the culture medium along with MIX, dexamethasone, and insulin on day 0. After 48 h (day 2), the cells were shifted to normal medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 μg/ml insulin, and then the normal differentiation protocol was followed. For re-induction of differentiation after vanadate treatment, day 6 3T3-L1 cells that had been exposed to the differentiation protocol with vanadate were re-induced with MIX, dexamethasone, and insulin following the normal differentiation protocol. For delayed vanadate treatment, 20 μm sodium vanadate was added to the cells after induction with MIX, dexamethasone, and insulin for the indicated time periods. On day 2, the medium was changed, and the cells were cultured as usual. 3T3-L1 cells (6-cm plate) were trypsinized from the culture dishes and collected by centrifugation. An aliquot was subjected to cell counting using a hemocytometer plate. For oil red O staining, 3T3-L1 adipocyte monolayers (usually on day 8) were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed for 2 min with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. Oil red O (0.5%) in isopropyl alcohol was diluted with 1.5 volumes of water, filtered, and added to the fixed cell monolayers for 1 h at room temperature. Cell monolayers were then washed with water, and the stained triglyceride droplets in the cells were visualized and/or photographed. Total cellular RNA was isolated by the guanidine isothiocyanate method (30Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. Macdougald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 24: 5294-5299Crossref Scopus (16654) Google Scholar) from day 0 (2-day post-confluent) cells and cells at various times after induction of differentiation in the presence or absence of vanadate. For Northern blot analysis of C/EBPα and 422/aP2 mRNAs, 20 μg of total RNA were denatured with glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide and resolved by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) as described (31McMaster G.K. Carmichael G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4835-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar, 32Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar). After transfer to Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), UV cross-linking, and removal of glyoxal, RNA was stained with methylene blue to locate 28 S and 18 S rRNAs and to verify equal loading. Blots were then hybridized overnight at 42 °C with C/EBPα and 422/aP2 cDNA probes in 50% formamide, 4× SSC, 1× Denhardt's solution, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 0.5 mg/ml sodium pyrophosphate. The blots were washed twice with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50 °C and twice with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and then visualized with a PhosphorImager. For analysis of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, cell monolayers from cells treated as described in the figure legends were washed three times with cold PBS supplemented with 0.1 mm sodium vanadate. Cells were then scraped from the plates into hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 15 mm KCl, 0.1 mm phenylarsine oxide (PAO; a PTPase inhibitor) (33Liao K. Hoffman R.D.

A. 1990; 87: 9255-9259Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixtures 1 and 2 (PIC1 and PIC2, respectively) (35Ronnett G.V. Knutson V.P. Kohanski R.A. Simpson T.L. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4566-4575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 1 mm PMSF and then homogenized with a glass homogenizer. Cellular membranes and cytosol were separated by centrifugation of the cell lysate at 150,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Membranes were then extracted with 10 mmHepes (pH 7.0), 1% Triton X-100, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1 mm PAO, 1 mm PMSF, and 2 μl/ml PIC1 and PIC2 for 1 h at 4 °C. The extract was centrifuged at 150,000 × gfor 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant is referred to as the solubilized membrane extract, and the pellet as the insoluble membrane fraction. The total cell extract was prepared by washing the cell monolayers with cold PBS as described above, followed by lysis with 1× boiling Laemmli SDS sample buffer (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar) containing 20 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PAO, and 1 mm sodium vanadate. The cell lysate was then heated at 100 °C for 5 min. For analysis, cell extracts (usually containing 10–50 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.). After blocking with 2% nonfat dried milk in 1× Tween/Tris-buffered saline containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween, and 0.001% Merthiolate for 2 h at room temperature, membranes were incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 45 min. Target proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Unless otherwise indicated, all operations were carried out at 4 °C. 3T3-L1 preadipocyte extract containing PTPase HA2, a PTPase 1B homologue (28Liao K. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12123-12132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), was prepared as described previously (33Liao K. Hoffman R.D. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6544-6553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 3T3-L1 preadipocyte monolayers were washed twice with cold PBS; scraped from the culture dishes; resuspended in hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 15 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 2 μl/ml PIC1 and PIC2; and then homogenized using a glass homogenizer. Total cellular membranes were pelleted by centrifugation for 45 min at 150,000 × g. Membranes were washed once with the same hypotonic buffer and extracted with 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 1% Triton X-100, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 2 μl/ml PIC1 and PIC2. After rotating for 1 h, the membrane suspension was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 45 min, and the supernatant containing the PTPase HA2 activity was collected. Partial purification of PTPase HA2 was accomplished by hydroxylapatite and DEAE ion-exchange chromatography (33Liao K. Hoffman R.D. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6544-6553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pp35 protein for use as substrate was prepared from day 2 cells after hormonal stimulation and vanadate treatment. In brief, 2-day post-confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with 1 μg/ml insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm MIX, and 20 μm sodium vanadate for 2 days, after which cell monolayers were washed twice with PBS; scraped from the culture dishes into hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 15 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm PAO, 1 mm PMSF, and 2 μl/ml PIC1 and PIC2; and homogenized. The cytosolic fraction was separated by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 45 min. Vanadate was omitted from the hypotonic buffer since it interferes with the PTPase assay; the high concentration of DTT in the dephosphorylation assay neutralized the PAO. Dephosphorylation of pp35 by PTPase HA2 was followed using the PTPase HA2 activity assay described previously (33Liao K. Hoffman R.D. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6544-6553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PTPase HA2 preparation was incubated with pp35 for the indicated times at 30 °C in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm PIPES (pH 6.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm DTT. The reaction was terminated by adding 3-fold concentrated Laemmli SDS sample buffer. The amount of pp35 protein was quantitated by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody as described above. 650 10-cm cell monolayers, treated with 1 μg/ml insulin, 1 μmdexamethasone, 0.5 mm MIX, and vanadate (20 μm on day 1 and an additional 15 μm on day 2 to maximize pp35 accumulation) for 2 days, were washed twice with cold PBS containing 0.1 mm vanadate; scraped from the culture dishes; resuspended in hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 15 mm KCl, 0.1 mm PAO, 1 mm vanadate, 1 mm PMSF, and 2 μl/ml PIC1 and PIC2; and homogenized using a glass homogenizer. After centrifugation at 150,000 ×g for 45 min, the supernatant (∼500 ml) was retained, and proteins were precipitated by bringing the solution to 60% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate. After stirring slowly for 30 min on ice, the mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The protein pellet was redissolved in 80 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm vanadate, 0.1 mm PAO, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 μl/ml PIC1 and PIC2 (Buffer A). The solubilized proteins were then dialyzed against the same buffer for 3 h at 4 °C. After removal of undissolved proteins by centrifugation, the supernatant was used for subsequent chromatographic purification. With this cytosolic fractionation and the ammonium sulfate precipitation steps, 1400 mg of total cellular proteins were reduced to 350 mg, and the recovery of pp35 was >90%. The first chromatographic step was Bio-Scale DEAE 10 FPLC. The above solubilized proteins (∼90 mg of proteins were loaded onto the column each time) were applied to a 10-ml column equilibrated with Buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed with 30 ml of Buffer A and eluted with a two-step elution: 15 ml of 200 mm NaCl in Buffer A, followed by a linear gradient of 200–500 mm NaCl (85 ml) in the same buffer at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Twenty-five fractions (4 ml/fraction) were collected. The eluted fractions were monitored for pp35 by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody as described above. Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method. After this step, proteins were reduced to ∼3.6 mg, with a pp35 yield of ∼23%. Following Bio-Scale DEAE 10 FPLC, HiTrap heparin FPLC and Resource-Q FPLC were used to further separate pp35. pp35-containing fractions from the Bio-Scale DEAE 10 chromatography were pooled; buffer-exchanged to a column loading buffer containing 20 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm vanadate, 0.1 mm PAO, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 2 μl/ml PIC1 and PIC2; and then applied to a HiTrap heparin affinity column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer at flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. The flow-through fraction containing all of the pp35 was immediately applied to a Resource-Q column equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing the column with 5 ml of the equilibration buffer, proteins were eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient of 20–500 mm NaCl in the loading buffer (1 ml/fraction) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions containing pp35 were pooled and concentrated with a Centricon C-10 microconcentrator (Millipore Corp.) to ∼200 μl. The final purification step was gel filtration by Superose 12 FPLC. The concentrated pooled fraction (containing pp35) from the Resource-Q FPLC was applied to a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column and then eluted with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm vanadate, 0.1 mmPAO, and 0.1 mm PMSF at flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The first 8-ml eluate representing the void volume of the column was collected in one pool, and then 25 0.4-ml fractions were collected. After the chromatographic purification, the overall pp35 yield was ∼10%, and the pp35 enrichment was 40,000-fold. The pp35-containing fractions were pooled and stored at −70 °C. To verify that the purified protein was truly pp35, a sample from the Superose 12 FPLC was mixed with an equal volume of isoelectric focusing gel loading buffer containing 9.5 m urea, 1.8% CHAPS, 20 mm DTT, and 2% ampholyte 3–10. This sample mixture was loaded onto an isoelectric focusing tube gel (2 mm × 6.5 cm) that had been pre-electrophoresed at 200 V for 10 min, 300 V for 20 min, and 400 V for 20 min. The isoelectric focusing gel was then run at 500 V for 10 min and 750 V for 4 h. After equilibration in 1× Laemmli electrophoresis buffer for 15 min, the tube gel was cut into 14 fractions, each of which were divided into two parts and loaded onto two identical 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, one gel was fixed and silver-stained to reveal the protein, and the other was transferred to Immobilon-P membrane for immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody to reveal pp35. The resulting gels revealed that a single silver-stained protein band and the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody-detected pp35 band were at an identical place on the gels. For amino acid sequence analysis, the peak pp35-containing fractions from the Superose 12 FPLC were pooled and concentrated using the Centricon C-10 microconcentrator. The sample was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane in 10 mm CAPS (pH 11.0) and 10% methanol at 270 mA for 10 h. Protein on the membrane was stained with 0.1% Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid solution, and the pp35 band was cut out and destained in PBS. The protein on the membrane was extracted twice for 3 h at 37 °C with 200 μl of 40% acetonitrile and once for 20 min at 50 °C with 200 μl of 40% acetonitrile and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. All eluates were pooled and lyophilized. The dried protein was dissolved in 50 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and 2% acetonitrile solution and then digested with trypsin (one-twentieth the amount of pp35 protein) for 48 h at 37 °C. After digestion, the sample was dried in a Speed-Vac, dissolved in 100 μl of Buffer A (0.06% trifluoroacetic acid solution), and injected into a pre-equilibrated microbore C-18 reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography column (2.1 × 100 mm). After washing with Buffer A for 15 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with a two-step gradient: first, 100% Buffer A to 90% Buffer A and 10% Buffer B (0.052% trifluoroacetic acid and 80% acetonitrile solution) in 5 min; and second, 90% Buffer A and 10% Buffer B to 20% Buffer A and 80% Buffer B in 100 min. The effluent was monitored for UV absorbency at 214 nm, and the fractions were collected manually. Three peptide peaks (eluting at 42, 52, and 56 min) were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectral analysis and Edman amino acid sequencing. Four tryptic peptide sequences were obtained from these three peaks,i.e. peptide 1, SSWYWGR; peptide 2, DKPEEQWWNAEDSEGK; peptide 3, GMIPVPYVEK; and peptide 4, LLDQQNPDEDFS. Peptides 2 and 4 were each from a single peak. The amino acid assignments for these two peptides were verified by the mass spectral analysis. Peptides 1 and 3 were from one reverse-phase chromatographic peak. Owing to the large differences in the amounts of these two peptides, the amino acid sequences for both peptides could be readily deduced from each Edman degradation cycle. The amino acid sequences of the four peptides were used to search the GenBan"

The pan-COX inhibitor ketorolac continuously and significantly decreased PGE(2) production and IL-6 and IL-8 levels in all OPC cell lines tested, but did not affect IL-1alpha, GM-CSF levels, or in vitro tumor cell growth. In contrast, ketorolac reduced OPC growth in vivo. The OPC cell lines used express the IL-6 receptor, and IL-6 stimulation of these cells causes transduction to occur via STAT3 pathway activation. Coincubation with OPC cell lines with conditioned medium from a TPA-exposed HL-60 cells stimulated growth proportional to the IL-6 levels measured in the conditioned medium. This growth effect was specifically inhibited by anti-IL-6 antibody. These results are consistent with cytokine products of inflammatory cells having paracrine growth effects on OPC. If chronic inflammation plays a role in promoting the development of OPC, this mechanism may also apply to other epithelial tumor systems modulated by COX activity."
https://openalex.org/W2087947924,"In order to unravel the mechanism that regulates transcription of protein-coding genes, we investigated the function of the p44 subunit of TFIIH, a basal transcription factor that is also involved in DNA repair. We have shown previously that mutations in the C terminus of the XPD helicase, another subunit of TFIIH, prevent its regulation by p44 (Coin, F., Bergmann, E., Tremeau-Bravard, A., and Egly, J. M. (1999) EMBO 18, 1357–1366). By using a site-directed mutagenesis approach within the p44 region from amino acids 66 to 200, we indicate how a decrease in the interaction between p44 and XPD results in a decrease of the XPD helicase activity and leads to a defect in the first steps of the transcription reaction, namely the first phosphodiester bond formation and promoter clearance. We thus provide some explanation for the transcriptional defect found in SSL1 mutated yeast (Wang, Z., Buratowski, S., Svejstrup, J. Q., Feaver, W. J., Wu, X., Kornberg, R. D., Donahue, T. F., and Friedberg, E. C. (1995) Mol. Cell. Biol. 15, 2288–2293). Moreover, this study shows how the activity of the the cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase associated with TFIIH complex in stimulating transcription is mediated in part by p44/XPD interaction."

Presently investigated are effects of FOG and GATA-1 on the transcription of the megakaryocytic integrin gene,αIIb. In GATA-1-deficient FDCER cells (in the presence of endogenous FOG), ectopically expressed GATA-1 activated transcription 3–10-fold both from αIIbtemplates and the endogenous αIIb gene. The increased expression of FOG increased reporter construct transcription 30-fold overall. Unexpectedly, αIIb gene transcription also was stimulated efficiently upon the ectopic expression in of FOG per se. This occurred in the absence of any detectable expression of GATA-1 and was observed in multiple independent sublines for both the endogenousαIIb gene and transfected constructs yet proved to depend largely upon conserved GATA elements 457 and 55 base pairs upstream from the transcriptional start site. In 293 cells, FOG plus GATA-1 but not FOG alone only moderately stimulatedαIIb transcription, and no direct interactions of FOG with the αIIb promoter were detectable.

During megakaryopoiesis, important roles for GATA-1 have been illustrated by experiments wherein the targeted disruption of an upstream activating element in the GATA-1 gene results in an accumulation of early megakaryocytic progenitor cells and a deficiency in platelet production (18Shivdasani R.A. Fujiwara Y. McDevitt M.A. Orkin S.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3965-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). FOG is a 110,000-kDa multitype zinc finger protein that was discovered in a yeast two-hybrid screen based on its ability to interact specifically with the amino-terminal zinc finger of GATA-1 (8Tsang A.P.

In FOG−/− mice (and in FOG−/−embryonic stem (ES)1 cells differentiated in vitro) (19Tsang A.P. Fujiwara Y. Hom D.B. Orkin S.H.

Fujiwara Y. Hom D.B. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1176-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). This broad defect indicates that FOG expression is either essential for early commitment to this lineage and/or that FOG acts subsequently to promote the transcription of late megakaryocytic genes. Since FOG is a co-factor for GATA-1 (8Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y., Yu, C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H.

However, GATA-1 mutants that fail to bind FOG have been shown to activate the expression of the EKLF, heme-regulated eIF-α-kinase, and FOG (26Crispino J.D. Lodish M.B. MacKay J.P. Orkin S.H. Mol.

Thus, GATA-1 and/or FOG also may act in combination with alternate co-factors to regulate erythromegakaryocytic gene expression. With regards to megakaryocytic genes, investigations of roles for FOG are limited to two studies to date. In 416B cells, ectopically expressed FOG and GATA-1 increased the frequency of cells expressing acetylcholinesterase (8Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y., Yu, C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M.

To further determine how FOG might affect megakaryocytic gene expression, we presently have investigated whether FOG might regulate the expression of the megakaryocytic integrin subunit, αIIb. αIIb expression is restricted to megakaryocytes, platelets, and their progenitors (27Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Parise L.V. Fitzgerald L.A. Blood. 1988; 71: 831-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, together with a more broadly expressed subunit β3, forms an integrin receptor that functions in platelet aggregation (28Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1989; 9: 117-156PubMed Google Scholar). In the promoter domains of the rat and humanαIIb genes, upstream as well as TATA box-positioned GATA-1 elements previously have been shown to be important for transcription (22Lemarchandel V. Ghysdael J. Mignotte V. Rahuel C. Romeo P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 29Martin F. Prandini M.H. Thevenon D. Marguerie G. Uzan G. J. Biol.

Flanking each of these two GATA elements are elements for Ets factor binding that likewise contribute to efficient transcription from the proximal promoters of the rat and human αIIb genes (28Plow E.F.

FDCER cell lines were maintained at 37 °C (5% CO2) in Opti-MEM I medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum, and 25 units of erythropoietin/ml. 293-G1, 293-FOG, and 293-Ets1 cells were prepared by transfecting 293 cells with pREP4-G1, pEFNeoFOG, and pA2PuroEts1, respectively. Transfections were performed using calcium phosphate (Life Technologies), 15 μg of expression vector DNA, and 5 μg of sheared and purified salmon sperm DNA. 293-G1 cells were selected in hygromycin B (75 μg/ml), 293-FOG cells were selected in G418 (1 mg/ml), and 293-Ets1 cells were selected in puromycin (0.8 mg/ml). For 293-G1-FOG cells, 293-G1 cells were transfected with pEFNeoFOG, and sublines expressing FOG and GATA-1 were isolated by selection in G418 plus hygromycin. For 293-Ets1-G1-FOG cells, 293-G1-FOG cells were transfected with pAPuroEts1 and selected in G418, hygromycin, and puromycin. 293 cells and derived cell lines were maintained in Opti-MEM I medium supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum and PSF (penicillin at 100 units/ml, streptomycin at 100 μg/ml, and amphotericin B at 0.25 μg/ml).

Products (30 cycles) were cloned to pCR-Script, and a 577-bp proximal promoter domain was cloned (KpnI–XhoI fragment) to pGL2-Basic. Mutation of −457 bp or −55 bp GATA elements (to CATA) in pαIIb545-Luc was by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) using the following primer pairs: pαIIb545-Δ5′G-Luc (−457 mutation), 5′-TGA CAG CCT CTG GTC TTA TGA GGG GAG AAC AGC TTG-3′ plus 5′-GCA AGC TGT TCT CCC CTC ATA AGA CCA GAG GCT GTC−3′; pαIIb545-Δ3′G-Luc (−55 mutation), 5′-CCA TGA GCT CCA GTC TCA TAA GCT GAA ACT TCC GG-3′ plus 5′-CCG GAA GTT TCA GCT TAT GAG ACT GGA GCT CAT GG-3′. For each construct, PCR (12 cycles) was at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 2 min. The double mutant construct pαIIb545-Δ5′Δ3′G-Luc was generated by mutating the −55 bp GATA-1 element in pαIIb545-Δ5′G-Luc. All products were sequenced using 3′ BigDye-labeled dideoxynucleotide triphosphates and an ABI PRISM 377 PCR Sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Putative transcription factor binding elements were profiled using Sequence Interpretation Tools software (available on the World Wide Web). In transfections of FDCER and derived cell lines, exponentially growing cells were adjusted to 3 × 105 cells/ml and transferred to six-well plates (3 ml/well). For each single transfection, 12 μl of FuGENE-6 liposomes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added to 88 μl of Opti-MEM I medium, and this mixture then was combined with 1.8 μg of reporter plasmid DNA plus 0.2 μg of pCMV-SEAP (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Complexes were incubated at 23 °C for 15 min and added to cells. At 24 h of culture, transfected cells were collected (200 ×g for 10 min), washed in PBS, and lysed in reporter lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm 1, 2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 25 mmTris phosphate, pH 7.8) (Promega). Cleared supernatants were assayed for protein concentration (BCA protein assay; Pierce) and for luciferase activity. To control for limited variability in transfection efficiencies, secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) activities in culture medium were assayed (Phospha-light kit; Tropix, Bedford MA). The activities of reporter plasmids in 293 cell lines were assayed as follows. Cells (30% confluent, 100-mm dishes) were transfected using calcium phosphate (Life Technologies), 4.5 μg of reporter plasmid DNA, 0.2 μg of pCMV-βgal, and 15 μg of sheared and purified salmon sperm DNA. At 48 h of culture, transfected cells were collected (200 × g for 10 min), washed in phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, and 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2), and lysed in reporter lysis buffer. Cleared supernatants (10 min at 8000 ×g) were assayed for luciferase activities (luciferase assay reagent; Promega, Madison, WI) and for β-galactosidase activities (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F.

Cycles for each were 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. 1 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/nmol) was included in each reaction.

Gaines P. Wojchowski D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3278-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 2.5% SDS, 0.1 mdithiothreitol, 7.5% glycerol, 8.75 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8) (100 μl/106 cells). An antibody to GATA-1 (N6; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was used (1:300 dilution) and was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In primary studies, roles for GATA-1 and FOG on endogenous αIIb gene transcription were tested via their stable expression in FDCW2-derived cell lines. Recently, our laboratory has shown that these cells do not express GATA-1 at detectable levels, yet support the ability of exogenous GATA-1 to (auto)activate the de novo expression of the endogenous GATA-1 gene (38Seshasayee D. Geiger J.N. Gaines P. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22969-22977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, Northern blot analyses of FDCER-GATA-1 cells revealed that exogenous GATA-1 expression also activated the expression of the endogenous αIIbgene. To confirm that this result was not a fortuitous clonal effect, αIIb transcript expression in FDCER-G1 clones c.10, c.9, and c.11 (i.e. three independent clones) was analyzed by32P-labeled reverse transcriptase-PCR (Fig. 1 B). In each clone, αIIb transcript expression was elevated severalfold due to the expression of exogenous GATA-1 (as compared directly with parental FDCER cells). Next, to test whether this effect was mediated by cis elements within the αIIb promoter, an extended upstream region of the murine αIIb gene was cloned, sequenced, and used to prepare promoter-luciferase reporter constructs. Within this approximately 1000-bp promoter region, elements at −457 bp and −55 bp exist together with flanking consensus Ets factor binding elements (at −508 to −501 and −44 to −37 bp) (Fig.2). Within the human and ratαIIb promoters (45Heidenreich R. Eisman R. Surrey S. Delgrosso K. Bennett J.S. Schwartz E. Poncz M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1232-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), each of these elements are positionally conserved. Within the previously undescribed upstream region, no additional consensus elements for these or other possible transfactors were apparent. Extended and truncatedαIIb promoter-reporter constructs were prepared (i.e. pαIIb910-Luc and pαIIb545-Luc), and their activities first were assayed in FDCER-G1 cells versuscontrol parental FDCER cells (Fig. 3). Exogenous GATA-1 (in the presence of low to moderate levels of endogenous FOG; see below) stimulated transcription from pαIIb545-Luc and pαIIb910-Luc approximately 5.4- and 2.9-fold, respectively. Maximal rates of transcription from each construct in FDCER-G1 cells were comparable, but transcription from pαIIb910-Luc in parental FDCER cells was more pronounced. No effects of GATA-1 expression on low level transcription of the promoterless control template pGL2Basic were observed. For pαIIb545-Luc, essentially equivalent results were obtained in repeated transfections of independent clonal lines of FDCER-G1 cells (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3GATA-1 induction of m-αIIb gene expression in FDCER-G1 cells is mediated by a −545 bp proximal promoter domain. A, the test constructs pαIIb910-Luc and pαIIb545-Luc (upper panel) (and pGL2-Basic as a negative control) were transfected into FDCER and FDCER-G1 cells. Levels of luciferase activity then were assayed in triplicate. Plotted are mean activities ± S.D. Shown (in parenthesis) are -fold increases in transcriptional reporter activity due to the stable ectopic expression of GATA-1 in FDCER-G1 cells. Limited variability in transfection efficiencies was accounted for by co-transfection with pSEAP and the assay of secreted alkaline phosphatase activity.B, four independent clonal lines of FDCER-G1 cells also were transfected with the reporter construct pαIIb545-Luc and assayed for luciferase activity. Results illustrated in A andB are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In FDCER-G1 cells, possible effects of FOG on αIIb gene transcription next were tested by increasing FOG expression in these lines via stable transfection. In FDCER-G1-FOG, FDCER-FOG, FDCER-G1, and parental FDCER cells, Northern blotting first was used to assay levels of FOG and GATA-1 (as well as GATA-2) transcript expression (Fig.4). As a point of comparison, levels of these transcripts in erythroid B6SUt.EP cells (and lymphoid CTLL2-ER cells) were co-analyzed. FOG transcript levels in FDCER cells were appreciable yet below those observed in B6SUt.EP cells. In FDCER-G1 cells, the ectopic expression of GATA-1 interestingly led to an estimated 3-fold increase in FOG transcript levels. In contrast, levels of GATA-2 transcript expression in FDCER-G1 and FDCER-G1-FOG cells were diminished. With regard to αIIb expression, ectopic expression of FOG in FDCER-G1 cells proved to stimulate rates of αIIb transcription to levels at least 5-fold above levels in FDCER-G1 cells and 38-fold above levels in parental FDCER cells (Fig.5 A). This result also was observed in repeated independent experiments in FDCER-G1-FOG cell lines. Based on these results (and the knowledge that FOG does not affect GATA-1's DNA binding activity) (26Crispino J.D. Lodish M.B. MacKay J.P. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 219-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), it was predicted that levels of FOG in FDCER-G1 cells might limit αIIb expression. If so, further increases in ectopic GATA-1 expression in FDCER-G1 cells might squelch rather than enhance the activity of FOG-GATA-1 complexes. To test this prediction, FDCER-G1 cells were transfected stably with a second GATA-1 expression vector (pCINeoG1), and effects on transcription from m-αIIb reporter constructs were assayed. Increased expression of exogenous GATA-1 in FDCER-G1-pCG1 cells proved to inhibit transcription from pαIIb545-Luc (and pαIIb910-Luc) approximately 3-fold as compared with FDCER-G1 cells (Fig. 5 B). Results are representative of three independent experiments (and increased levels of GATA-1 expression in FDCER-G1-pCG1 cells have been documented previously) (33Seshasayee D. Gaines P. Wojchowski D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3278-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This apparent squelching effect demonstrates that levels of GATA-1 in FDCER-G1 cells do not limit αIIb transcription and is at l"

Since prothrombin (and Ca2+) can bind FXI and can substitute for HK (and Zn2+) as a cofactor for FXI binding to platelets, we have attempted to identify a prothrombin-binding site in FXI. The recombinant A1 domain (rA1, Glu1–Ser90) inhibited the saturable, specific and reversible binding of prothrombin to FXI, whereas neither the rA2 domain (Ser90–Ala181), rA3 domain (Ala181–Val271), nor rA4 domain (Phe272–Glu361) inhibited prothrombin binding to FXI. Kinetic binding studies using surface plasmon resonance showed binding of FXI (K d ∼71 nm) and the rA1 domain (K d ∼239 nm) but not rA2, rA3, or rA4 to immobilized prothrombin. Reciprocal binding studies revealed that synthetic peptides (encompassing residues Ala45–Ser86) containing both HK- and thrombin-binding sites, inhibit 125I-rA1 (Glu1–Ser90) binding to prothrombin,125I-prothrombin binding to FXI, and125I-prothrombin fragment 2 (Ser156–Arg271) binding to FXI. However, homologous prekallikrein-derived peptides (encompassing Pro45–Gly86) did not inhibit FXI rA1 binding to prothrombin. The peptides Ala45–Arg54, Phe56–Val71, and Asp72–Ser86, derived from sequences of the A1 domain of FXI, acted synergistically to inhibit 125I-rA1 binding to prothrombin. Mutant rA1 peptides (V64A and I77A), which did not inhibit FXI binding to HK, retained full capacity to inhibit rA1 domain binding to prothrombin, and mutant rA1 peptides Ala45–Ala54 (D51A) and Val59–Arg70 (E66A), which did not inhibit FXI binding to thrombin, retained full capacity to inhibit rA1 domain binding to prothrombin. Thus, these experiments demonstrate that a prothrombin binding site exists in the A1 domain of FXI spanning residues Ala45–Ser86 that is contiguous with but separate and distinct from the HK- and thrombin-binding sites and that this interaction occurs through the kringle II domain of prothrombin.

Blood. 1993; 81: 580-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, recently we have shown that the presence of physiological concentrations of prothrombin (∼1.5 μm) can reverse the inhibitory effects of HK in the presence of activated platelets, which provide a surface for potentiation of F-XI activation by thrombin (14Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Since prothrombin can also act as a cofactor for binding FXI to platelets (in place of HK), the activation of FXI by thrombin may be physiologically important on the platelet surface (14Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal portion of the FXI monomer consists of four tandem repeat sequences of 90–91 residues, each with 6–7 cysteine residues in a characteristic disulfide linkage termed Apple domains (4Fujikawa K. Chung D.W. Hendrickson L.E. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 5McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3652-3658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and HK (18Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4247-4252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4149-4154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our experiments also support the notion that prothrombin as well as thrombin bind FXI at a site encompassing residues Phe56–Ser86 that also mediates HK binding to the A1 domain (14Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The fact that prothrombin fragment 1.2 (PF1.2) but not PF1 displaced HK from its binding site on the A1 domain of FXI suggests that the kringle II domain of prothrombin binds to a site contiguous with the HK binding site in the A1 domain (14Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore, one objective of the present study is to identify the amino acid sequences in FXI that interact with prothrombin and PF2 (containing kringle II) in order to ascertain the relevant physiological mechanisms that promote activation of FXI by thrombin on the platelet surface. The conclusion drawn from these studies is that prothrombin kringle II can bind to the FXI A1 domain at a site contiguous with but separate and distinct from the A1 domain site utilized by thrombin to bind to and activate FXI. FXI (250 units/mg of protein) was purified from human plasma by immunoaffinity chromatography (21Sinha D. Koshy A. Seaman F.S. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10714-10719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FXI was assayed by a minor modification (22Scott C.F. Sinha D. Seaman F.S. Walsh P.N. Colman R.W. Blood. 1984; 63: 42-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the kaolin-activated partial thromboplastin time. The recombinant Apple 1 (rA1) domain (Glu1–Ser90) was prepared and characterized as described previously (15Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4247-4252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human prothrombin, PF1 and PF1.2, were purchased from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). HK (specific activity, 15 units/mg) was purified by the method of Kerbiriou and Griffin (23Kerbiriou D.M. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12020-12027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human α-thrombin (2,800 NIH units/mg) was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). The potent thrombin inhibitor d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone (PPACK) was purchased from Calbiochem (Indianapolis, IN). Active site-inhibited thrombin was prepared by incubation of a 10-fold excess of PPACK with α-thrombin for 1 h at 37 °C, and this mixture was dialyzed in Spectrophor tubing (M r 3,500 cut-off, Spectrum Medical Industries, Los Angeles, CA) overnight in phosphate-buffered saline at 5 °C. All purified proteins appeared homogeneous by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. PF2 was isolated from prothrombin activation material depleted of thrombin by SP chromatography (the source of this material was from Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN). This preparation contained 0.4 mg/ml protein in 50 mm sodium phosphate and 1 μm benzamidine, pH 6.5. To 50 ml of this material, PPACK (from Calbiochem, Indianapolis, IN) was added to a concentration of 10 μm. PF2 was isolated utilizing a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 23 °C using a MonoQ (HR 5/5) column according to the procedure of Stevens and Nesheim (24Stevens W.K. Nesheim M.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2787-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Preparative isolation of the material on this column results in PF1 and PF2 in two separate pools, with PF2 migrating at 14 kDa as a doublet on SDS-gel electrophoresis. From 50 ml (20 mg) of protein loaded on the column, approximately 7 mg of PF2 was recovered. An additional preparation of human PF2 was a generous gift from Dr. S. Krishnaswamy (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) and gave identical results in all experiments reported here. Purified FXI, prothrombin, rA1 (Glu1–Ser90), and PF2 (Ser156–Arg271) were radiolabeled with125I by a minor modification (21Sinha D. Koshy A. Seaman F.S. Walsh P.N. J. Biol.

The radiolabeled FXI and prothrombin retained >98% of their biological activity. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad dye-binding assay according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer.

All the peptides utilized in this work were rationally designed, conformationally constrained synthetic peptides based upon previously published (16Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol.

Jameson B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 65-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) was used to oxidize the two cysteine residues in each peptide to form a disulfide bond and to conformationally constrain the peptide. The HPLC system employed was from Waters (600 gradient module, model 740 data module, model 46K universal injector, and Lambda-Max model 481 detector; Waters, Milford, MA). Reverse phase chromatography was performed using a Waters C8 μBondapak column, whereas gel filtration was carried out using a Waters Protein-Pak 60 column as described previously (26Walsh P.N. Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 65-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). All the peptides utilized in this study were examined by HPLC (both reverse phase and gel filtration), and all demonstrated a single homogeneous peak (data not shown). When the peptides were examined by HPLC (both reverse phase and gel filtration), single homogeneous peaks with identical retention times to the original mixtures were observed, demonstrating the presence of a single homogenous mixture of refolded peptides. All peptides were examined for free SH groups using the Ellman reagent (5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)). It was determined (27Habeeb A.F.S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar) that there was less than 0.02 mol of free SH/mol of peptide, which further verifies that these peptides were homogeneous preparations consisting of intramolecular disulfide-bonded peptide. The binding of prothrombin, PF2, or PF1.2 to FXI was studied using polyvinyl chloride microtiter plates, the wells of which were coated with FXI by incubation with 100 μl of protein (100 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. After residual binding sites in the wells were blocked with bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 25 °C, 100 μl of125I-prothrombin, 125I-PF2, or125I-PF1.2 (50–3,000 nm) was added to the wells and incubated for 3–4 h at room temperature. The wells were thoroughly washed with phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin and dried and counted in a 1470 Wallac Wizard γ counter (Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The binding of the rA1 domain of FXI to prothrombin was studied using polyvinyl chloride microtiter plates, the wells of which were coated with prothrombin by incubation with 100 μl of protein (100 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. After residual binding sites in the wells were blocked with bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 25 °C, 100 μl of125I-rA1 (Glu1–Ser90) (50–3,000 nm) was added to the wells and incubated for 3–4 h at room temperature. The wells were thoroughly washed with phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin and dried and counted in a 1470 Wallac Wizard γ counter. Binding studies were performed on a Biacore 2000 Flow Biosensor (Biacore, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). Prothrombin was immobilized on a carboxymethyl dextran (CM5) flow cell surface using either aldehyde linkage of oxidized carbohydrate (on prothrombin) or amine-coupling chemistry. For aldehyde linkage, prothrombin was diluted to 1 mg/ml in 100 mmsodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, and placed on ice. After addition of sodium metaperiodate (1 mm), the prothrombin was incubated on ice in the dark for 20 min. The protein was desalted on a PD10 column that had been pre-equilibrated in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0. The CM5 cell surface was activated with a 3-min pulse of 1.15 mg of N-hydroxysuccinimide mixed with 7.5 mg ofN""-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride at 5 μl/min. The surface was then hydrazide-modified with a 7-min pulse of 5 mm carbohydrazide in water. Non-reacted sites were blocked with a 7-min pulse of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. The oxidized prothrombin, ∼10 μg/ml in sodium acetate, pH 4.0, was injected to a response level of ∼150 response units. The flow rate was lowered to 2 μl/min. Cyanoborohydride was injected for 20 min, followed by three 1-min injections of 0.1 m glycine. For amine coupling, a 7-min pulse ofN-hydroxysuccinimide/N""-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride was followed by injection of prothrombin, ∼10 μg/ml in sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, to a response level of ∼500 response units. Any remaining derivatized carboxymethyl groups were blocked by a 7-min injection of 1 m ethanolamine. Nonspecific binding was determined by protein binding to a derivatized and blocked flow cell with an unrelated antibody bound. Wild type FXI was studied using both the aldehyde-linked prothrombin and amine-coupled prothrombin. Recombinant Apple 1 domain was studied on the amine-coupled prothrombin flow cell alone. Serial dilutions of wild type FXI and recombinant Apple domains in Hepes-buffered saline (HBS; 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl), 0.005% surfactant P20, 5 mm Ca2+, were injected with a 6-min association time and 5-min dissociation time. After subtraction of nonspecific binding curves, the association and dissociation rate constants were determined using a global fit to a one to one Langmuir association model on Biaevaluation software (Biacore, Inc.). The best fit was determined by a χ2 value of less than 10 or less than 5% of the equilibrium response unit value for the highest concentration. The χ2 value is the square of the differences between the theoretical ideal curve and the actual curve and was calculated according to Equation 1. χ2=Σ(rf−rx) 2/n−pEquation 1 rf indicates the fitted value at a given point, rx indicates the experimental value at that point, n indicates the number of data points, andp indicates the fitted parameters. Since contiguous but distinct binding sites for HK (Val59–Lys83) and thrombin (Ala45–Arg70) reside within the A1 domain of FXI (18Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4247-4252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4149-4154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we previously examined the effects of prothrombin and its fragments on the binding of FXI to HK (14Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our published studies (14Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) show that active site-inhibited thrombin, prothrombin, and PF1.2 all inhibit the binding of FXI to HK, whereas PF1 had no such effect. We reported that prothrombin as well as thrombin bind FXI at or near the HK binding site in the A1 domain (Phe56–Ser86) (14Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These experiments suggest that the kringle II domain of prothrombin may interact with the A1 domain of FXI at a site close to but distinct from the thrombin-binding site. We therefore investigated whether prothrombin can interact with the Apple domains of FXI by examining whether peptides derived from the amino acid sequences of the heavy chain of FXI could affect the binding of125I-prothrombin to FXI. The rA1 domain (Glu1–Ser90) inhibited the binding of prothrombin to FXI with an IC50 of 4 × 10−7m (Fig.1 A, TableI). In contrast, neither the rA2 domain (Ser90–Ala181) containing a substrate binding site for FIX (19Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24190-24197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), nor the rA3 domain (Ala181–Val271) containing both platelet and heparin binding sites (16Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Walsh P.N.

Sequence analysis of this lymphocyte TK1 cDNA and 21 other cDNAs or genomic TK1 DNAs from healthy cells or leukemic or transformed cell lines revealed a valine at amino acid position 106. The TK1 sequence in NCBI GenBankTM has methionine at this position. The recombinant lymphocyte TK1Val-106 (rLy-TK1Val-106) has the same enzymatic and oligomerization properties as endogenous human lymphocyte TK1 (Ly-TK1); ATP exposure induces an enzyme concentration-dependent reversible transition from a dimer to a tetramer with 20–30-fold higher thymidine affinity (K m about 15 and 0.5 μm, respectively). Substitution of Val-106 with methionine to give rLy-TK1Met-106 results in a permanent tetramer with the high thymidine affinity (K m about 0.5 μm), even without ATP exposure. Furthermore, rLy-TK1Met-106 is considerably less stable than rLy-TK1Val-106 (t 12 at 15 °C is 41 and 392 min, respectively). Because valine with high probability is the naturally occurring amino acid at position 106 in human TK1 and because this position has high impact on the enzyme properties, the Val-106 form should be used in future investigations of recombinant human TK1.

Intracellular TMP is quickly phosphorylated to TDP and TTP. Because TTP is an allosteric effector of ribonucleotide reductase, imbalances in the TTP pool disturb the supply of both purines and pyrimidines for DNA synthesis and repair. In turn, imbalanced deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools increase the mutation rate and probability of carcinogenesis (1Lei H.X. Li Z.S. Xie D.Y. Liu B.C. Fang F.D. Biomed. Environ. Sci. 1998; 11: 354-362PubMed Google Scholar, 2Meuth M. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 181: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 3Oliver F.J. Collins M.K.L. López-Rivas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10624-10630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). TK1 is a cell cycle-regulated enzyme. Its activity fluctuates with DNA synthesis, being high in dividing and malignant cells and low in quiescent cells (4Sherley J.L. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8350-8358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kristensen T. Jensen H.K. Munch-Petersen B. Leuk. Res. 1994; 18: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The expression of TK1 is meticulously controlled on the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level (6Stewart C.J. Ito M. Conrad S.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar,7Kauffman M.G. Kelly T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2538-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). At the enzymatic level, ATP, besides being a cosubstrate, has been shown to be a regulator of the catalytic activity of TK1 (8Munch-Petersen B. Tyrsted G. Cloos L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15621-15625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, exposure to ATP induces a reversible enzyme concentration-dependent transition from a low thymidine affinity dimer of about 50 kDa (K m = 15 μm) to a high affinity tetramer (K m = 0.7 μm). To further investigate the effect of ATP, we constructed a pET3a-TK1 plasmid (9Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Jensen H.K. Tyrsted G. Advan. Enzyme Regul. 1995; 35: 69-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) containing the amino acid coding region of TK1 cDNA from the pTK11 plasmid of Bradshaw and Deininger (10Bradshaw Jr., H.D. Deininger P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2316-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), who had used SV40 transformed human fibroblasts as the mRNA source. We expressed the resulting recombinant TK1 (rTFi-TK1) inEscherichia coli, and purified and characterized the enzyme. To our surprise we found that the enzymatic properties of rTFi-TK1 differed markedly from those of the endogenous Ly-TK1 with respect to the regulatory effect of ATP (9Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Jensen H.K. Tyrsted G. Advan. Enzyme Regul. 1995; 35: 69-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Irrespective of pre-exposure to ATP, the recombinant rTFi-TK1 was a permanent tetramer of about 100 kDa with high affinity to thymidine with a K m value about 0.4 μm (9Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Jensen H.K. Tyrsted G. Advan. Enzyme Regul. 1995; 35: 69-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). At that time, we assumed that the amino acid sequences of rTFi-TK1 and Ly-TK1 were identical and explained the divergent properties of rTFi-TK1 by the absence of post-translational modification of TK1 when expressed in E. coli (9Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Jensen H.K. Tyrsted G. Advan. Enzyme Regul. 1995; 35: 69-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because the pET3a-TK1 expression system was not satisfactory in terms of amount of TK1 protein produced, we constructed another expression plasmid, pGEX-2T-LyTK1. Here, the amino acid coding region of TK1 from normal human lymphocytes was cloned into the pGEX-2T vector, and the recombinant TK1 was expressed as an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. In contrast to the findings with rTFi-TK1, our preliminary kinetic experiments showed that the recombinant lymphocyte TK1 (rLy-TK1)1 behaved essentially as the endogenous lymphocyte enzyme, Ly-TK1, regarding kinetic and oligomerization properties. Therefore, absence of post-translational modification of rTFi-TK1 in E. colicannot explain the divergent properties of recombinant TK1 expressed from the pET3a-TK1 plasmid. By comparison of the sequence of lymphocyte TK1 cDNA with that of TK1 cDNA in our pET3a-TK1 plasmid, as well as in the clone of Bradshaw and Deininger (10Bradshaw Jr., H.D. Deininger P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2316-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we discovered that lymphocyte TK1 cDNA had a GTG codon for valine at amino acid position 106, whereas TK1 cDNA cloned by Bradshaw and Deininger (10Bradshaw Jr., H.D. Deininger P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2316-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) had an ATG codon for methionine at this position. Amino acid 106 is located in a highly conserved area and is valine in TK1 from chicken, chinese hamster, mouse, and vaccinia virus. The present investigation was started to clarify the naturally occurring amino acid at site 106 in human TK1 and to examine the significance of valine or methionine at this site for the oligomerization and enzymatic properties. KY895, a thymidine kinase-deficient strain of E. coli (11Hiraga S. Igarashi K. Yura T. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1967; 145: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and E. coli strain BL21 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used for propagation of recombinant plasmids. BL21 was used for expression of recombinant TK1. E. coli XL1-Blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene) were used for transformation of DNA after site-directed mutagenesis. Unless otherwise indicated, the strains were grown in LB medium at 37 °C and with 50 μg/ml ampicillin for plasmid-containing strains. Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from normal human lymphocytes (donor 1) according to the procedure of Chomczynski and Sacchi (12Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar) and reverse transcribed by avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega). The resulting cDNA was PCR amplified under the following conditions: 40 cycles, 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min, and with a sense primer 5′-50GAGGATCCATGAGCTGCATTAAC72-3′ and an antisense primer 5′-754CAGGCATGCATTGCAGAATCTG733-3′ (the position numbers are according to Bradshaw and Deininger in Ref.10Bradshaw Jr., H.D. Deininger P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2316-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Bases shown in bold type were altered in comparison to the original sequence to introduce BamHI and SphI restriction sites into the cDNA. The PCR fragment was cloned intoBamHI-SphI restriction sites of pGEM-3Zf vector. The KpnI-HindIII fragment from pGEM-3Zf-TK1 plasmid, containing the entire TK1 coding sequence, was subcloned intoKpnI-HindIII sites of pBluescript II KS+. This plasmid was cleaved with BamHI andEcoRI, and the TK1 coding fragment was inserted intoBamHI and EcoRI cleaved pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting plasmid was called pGEX-2T-LyTK1Val-106, because sequencing showed a GTG codon for valine instead of an ATG codon for methionine at TK1 amino acid position 106. After propagation in E. coli KY895, pGEX-2T-LyTK1Val-106 was purified by the Wizard kit (Promega) and stored at 4 °C in 10 mm Tris, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. For insertion into the restriction sites and for introduction of thrombin cleavage site, it was necessary to modify the N-terminal to start with GSMCS instead of MCS and the C-terminal to end with ILQCMQA instead of ILQCSPAN. Neither of the 10 first N-terminal amino acids nor the C-terminal amino acids of thymidine kinases are evolutionary conserved (13Folkers G. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Gutbrod O. Krickl S. Fetzer J. Keil G.M. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1991; 5: 385-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and therefore these amino acid changes were regarded to be of no importance. This expectation was confirmed by our experimental results. The codon GTG at TK1 amino acid position 106 was replaced by ATG using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene according to the protocol supplied. The mutagenic primers were: sense primer 5′-361TTCCCTGACATC ATGGAATTCTGCGAGGCC390-3′, and antisense primer 5′-390GGCCTCGCAGAATTCCAT GATGTCAGGGAA361-3′. The ATG codon replacing GTG is underlined, and the altered bases are shown in bold type (the other base change G to A in the sense primer and C to T in the antisense primer was introduced to get a control EcoRI restriction site introduced in the cDNA without changing the amino acid; the numbering is according to Bradshaw and Deininger in Ref. 10Bradshaw Jr., H.D. Deininger P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2316-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The potentially correct plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21 and sequenced. After propagation inE. coli BL21, plasmid DNA was isolated by the Wizard kit (Promega). The cDNA inserts in pGEX-2T for rLy-TK1Val-106 and rLy-TK1Met-106 were sequenced on both strands using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Overnight bacterial cultures were diluted to A 600 = 0.6 in LB medium with 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and expression of the glutathione S-transferase-TK1 fusion protein was induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 6 h at 25 °C. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 120 of the original culture volume in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, and 50 mm ε-aminocaproic acid) and homogenized by the French Press. After centrifugation and filtration as described (14Munch-Petersen B. Knecht W. Lenz C. Sondergaard L. Piskur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6673-6679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the bacterial lysate was applied to a Glutathione Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with buffer B (Buffer A without EDTA and with Tris-HCl replaced by phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3). After washing with 20 column volumes of buffer B, the column was equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100, and TK1 was cleaved from the bound glutathione S-transferase by recirculation for 2 h at room temperature with one column volume of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 50 units/ml thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The eluate containing TK1 was collected on ice. For storage at −80 °C, glycerol, Triton X-100, DTT, and MgCl2 were added to 10%, 1%, 5 mm, and 5 mm, respectively. For kinetic and stability experiments, the thrombin cleavage fractions were pooled, desalted by Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in buffer C (10 mm potassium-phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 10% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm CHAPS, and 5 mmMgCl2), and further purified by CM-Sepharose CL6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer C. After washing with 20 column volumes of buffer C, the enzyme was eluted with buffer D (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm CHAPS, and 5 mmMgCl2). Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar) using BSA as standard. The yield of recombinant protein in the cleavage fractions obtained from 1 liter of bacterial culture was 4–8 mg. The enzymes were diluted in buffer E or F to 5 μg/ml without or with 2.5 mm ATP/MgCl2 and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h before storage at −80 °C. The cleavage fractions were diluted in buffer E (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2 mm CHAPS, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1m KCl) and the CM fractions were diluted in buffer F (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm CHAPS, and 3 mg/ml BSA). The enzymes stored without and with ATP are referred to as TK1−ATP and TK1+ATP, respectively. Discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed in Tris-HCl with 4.5% stacking gel, pH 6.8, and 15% separation gel, pH 8.8. As shown in Fig. 1, CM fractions of both rLy-TK1Val-106 and rLy-TK1Met-106 gave single bands corresponding to 25 kDa, the same size as the subunit size of Ly-TK1 (8Munch-Petersen B. Tyrsted G. Cloos L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15621-15625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent molecular size of nondenatured recombinant enzymes was determined by gel filtration on a Superose 12 column (10 × 300 mm) connected to a Gradifrac automatic sampler (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described earlier (8Munch-Petersen B. Tyrsted G. Cloos L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15621-15625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The column was equilibrated and eluted with 50 mmimidazole-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 2 mm CHAPS, and 0.1 m KCl. The fractions were assayed for thymidine kinase activity at standard assay conditions and 10 μmthymidine. The TK1 activity was assayed by the DE-81 filter paper method as described previously (8Munch-Petersen B. Tyrsted G. Cloos L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15621-15625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standard assay conditions were: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 0.5 mm CHAPS, 3 mg/ml BSA, 2.5 mm ATP, and the indicated concentrations of [methyl-3H]thymidine (925 GBq/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a total volume of 50 μl. The enzyme was diluted immediately before start of the reaction with ice-cold buffer F but without glycerol. For dilution of the TK1+ATP form, 2.5 mmATP/MgCl2 were included. The enzyme concentration in the kinetic experiments was 5 ng/ml in the assay mixture. The kinetic parameters and reaction mechanism were determined by fitting the data to the following equation. v=V·snKmn+snEquation 1 using the nonlinear regression software from Graphpad Prism®.V is the maximal velocity, and n is the Hill constant. The stored enzymes (5 μg/ml) were diluted 200-fold into 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mm CHAPS and 5 mm DTT and incubated at 15 °C. At various times, 10-μl samples were assayed for thymidine kinase activity at standard assay conditions and 100 μm thymidine. The leukemic cell lines: Raji, CEM-C, Molt-3, Reh, K-562, KG-1, RS4;11, AML-193; the colon cancer cell lines: DLD-1, Het-116, LoVo, SW480; and the HeLa cells were purchased through American Type Culture Collection. The human fibroblast cell line WI38 and the SV40 transformed human fibroblast cell line WI26 VA4 were purchased from European Collection of Cell Cultures. Lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood from healthy volunteers by the Isopaque-Ficoll technique. For isolation of mRNA, the lymphocytes were cultured for 72 h with PHA as described (16Munch-Petersen B. Tyrsted G. Dupont B. Exp. Cell Res. 1973; 79: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The harvested cells were stored at −80 °C. The cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) with l-glutamine, 15% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in atmospheric air with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Subculturing was performed routinely at a cell concentration of about 106 cells/ml. Genomic DNA was isolated by the phenol extraction standard method after SDS lysis and proteinase K treatment (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.16-9.19Google Scholar). DNA concentration was measured at 260 nm. A 166-base pair genomic DNA fragment containing the codon for amino acid 106 was amplified with the sense primer 5′-11824AGCGTCTTCGCTGGGGCTCC11843-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-11989TTCCTCTGGAAGGTCCCATCC11969-3′ (the numbers are according to Flemington et al. in Ref. 18Flemington E. Bradshaw Jr., H.D. Traina-Dorge V. Slagel V. Deininger P.L. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 52: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The PCR reaction conditions were optimized with the PCR OptimizerTM kit, version C (Invitrogen), and performed at the following parameters: 25–30 cycles, denaturation 94 °C for 1 min, annealing 55 °C for 2 min, and polymerization 72 °C for 3 min. RNA was isolated by the RNAqueousTM phenol-free total RNA isolation kit (Ambion, TX). cDNA was amplified with TitanTM one-tube reverse transcription-PCR kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturers instruction but with 400 nm of each primer. The sense primer was 5′-22GAGAGTACTCGGGTTCGTGAA42-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-825ATGCAGGGCAGCGTCCAGTAG805-3′ (the numbers are according to Bradshaw and Deininger in Ref. 10Bradshaw Jr., H.D. Deininger P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2316-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This gave an 804-base pair fragment containing the entire coding region of TK1 cDNA. Both strands were sequenced using the Thermo Sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the dITP nucleotide master mix. [α-33P]Dideoxynucleotides were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Two differences were uncovered when the nucleotide sequence of the lymphocyte TK1 cDNA insert in the pGEX-2T-LyTK1Val-106 plasmid was compared with the published human TK1 sequences, which are the coding sequence of TK1 derived from SV40 transformed human fibroblasts (the pTK11 clone) (10Bradshaw Jr., H.D. Deininger P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2316-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and the entire TK1 genomic sequence derived from HeLa cells (the λtk46 clone) (18Flemington E. Bradshaw Jr., H.D. Traina-Dorge V. Slagel V. Deininger P.L. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 52: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The differences were: Base 373, A, was changed to G in pGEX-2T-LyTK1, and base 689, A, was changed to G in pGEX-2T-LyTK1 (numbers refer to TK1 cDNA insert in the pTK11 clone). The first change resulted in change of codon ATG for methionine to GTG for valine. The second change was from codon AAG for lysine to codon AGG for arginine. Thus, at the amino acid level we observed two differences in our recombinant TK1 (rLy-TK1) when compared with the published human TK1 sequences: valine in place of methionine at position 106 and arginine in place of lysine at position 211 (A in the ATG codon for the first methionine is nucleotide number 58, according to the numbering of Bradshaw and Deininger in Ref. 10Bradshaw Jr., H.D. Deininger P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2316-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Alignment of TK1 amino acid sequences from mammals and vaccinia virus with isofunctional enzymes (adenylate kinase and protein elongation factor EF-Tu) has predicted the presence of several conserved regions essential for substrate binding and transfer of the phosphate group (13Folkers G. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Gutbrod O. Krickl S. Fetzer J. Keil G.M. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1991; 5: 385-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Amino acid 106 of human TK1 is in a region of 44 highly conserved amino acids starting with amino acid 93, and each amino acid in this region is expected to be functionally important (13Folkers G. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Gutbrod O. Krickl S. Fetzer J. Keil G.M. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1991; 5: 385-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All the published mammalian TK1 sequences, as well as the vaccinia virus TK sequence, have valine at the site corresponding to site 106 in human TK1, except for the published human TK1 sequence with methionine at position 106 (10Bradshaw Jr., H.D. Deininger P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2316-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 18Flemington E. Bradshaw Jr., H.D. Traina-Dorge V. Slagel V. Deininger P.L. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 52: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, the amino acid 106 derived from our nucleotide sequence of the lymphocyte cDNA clone is not a methionine but a valine in agreement with the known sequences from different mammalian enzymes. The second difference we found was arginine instead of lysine at position 211, which does not belong to any conserved region in the C-terminal of thymidine kinases. According to Bordo and Argos (19Bordo D. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), exchange of lysine for arginine belongs to so-called “safe” substitutions, resulting in very small conformational changes, if any. Further, the 40 C-terminal amino acids are not required for TK1 activity but are involved in cell cycle regulation of the enzyme (7Kauffman M.G. Kelly T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2538-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Therefore, the amino acid change at position 211 is not expected to be important for the enzymatic properties of TK1. We have investigated the significance of amino acid 106 by comparison of the properties of the recombinant lymphocyte TK1 enzymes, rLy-TK1Val-106 and rLy-TK1Met-106, with TK1 isolated from human lymphocytes, Ly-TK1. Because amino acid 211 is an arginine in both recombinant enzymes, eventual differences in enzymatic properties will solely be due to the different amino acids at position 106. Fig. 2 shows the relationship between the initial velocity of dTMP formation and the thymidine concentration at saturating concentration of ATP for both the TK1−ATP (TK1 incubated and stored without ATP) and TK1+ATP (TK1 incubated and stored with ATP) form of rLy-TK1Val-106 and rLy-TK1Met-106. The thymidine substrate kinetics of rLy-TK1Val-106 (Fig. 2 A) is essentially the same as that previously observed for Ly-TK1 (8Munch-Petersen B. Tyrsted G. Cloos L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15621-15625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): rLy-TK1Val-106−ATP displays a nonhyperbolic, “creeping” binding curve and gives a clear biphasic kinetic pattern in the Hofstee plot (Fig. 2 A, inset). From the nonlinear regression analysis, the K m value was determined to be 15 μm, and the Hill coefficient was determined to be 0.4, indicating a negative cooperative reaction mechanism. The rLy-TK1Val-106+ATP form displays rectangular hyperbolic kinetics and a straight line in the Hofstee plot, with aK m value of 0.6 μm and a Hill coefficient of about 1. The activating effect of ATP is dependent on the concentration of TK1 (8Munch-Petersen B. Tyrsted G. Cloos L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15621-15625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and does not occur at assay enzyme concentration. Similar experiments with rLy-TK1Met-106 (Fig.2 B) indicate that the kinetics of this enzyme was independent of preceding exposure to ATP; the same rectangular hyperbolic reaction mechanism and straight lines in the Hofstee plots were observed for both the +ATP and the −ATP form. Furthermore,K m for thymidine of the two forms is the same, about 0.5 μm, and the same as the K m of rLy-TK1Val-106+ATP and thus about 30-fold lower than the thymidine K m of rLy-TK1Val-106−ATP, which is 15 μm. Also, the Hill coefficients for the +ATP and −ATP forms of rLy-TK1Met-106 are the same, about 1, indicating hyperbolic reaction mechanism. In addition, rLy-TK1Met-106±ATP show the same relationship of velocity toward substrate concentration throughout the applied concentrations of thymidine (Fig. 2 B), whereas at thymidine concentrations below 15 μm, the velocity of rLy-TK1Val-106+ATP was 3–5-fold higher than the velocity of rLy-TK1Val-106−ATP (Fig. 2 A). These results demonstrate two important issues. Firstly, rLy-TK1Val-106 behaves like the endogenous Ly-TK1 purified from human lymphocytes, whereas rLy-TK1Met-106 differs by having a permanently high thymidine affinity irrespective of preceding ATP exposure. Secondly, the kinetic properties of rLy-TK1Met-106 are the same as those previously described by Munch-Petersen et al. (9Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Jensen H.K. Tyrsted G. Advan. Enzyme Regul. 1995; 35: 69-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) for rTFi-TK1 derived from the pTK11 cDNA of Bradshaw and Deininger (10Bradshaw Jr., H.D. Deininger P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2316-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The apparent sizes as determined by Superose 12 gel filtration were about 50 kDa for rLy-TK1Val-106 and 100 kDa for rLy-TK1Met-106(Fig. 3). According to the subunit size of about 25 kDa, native rLy-TK1Val-106−ATP elutes predominantly as a dimer, whereas rLy-TK1Met-106−ATP elutes predominantly as a tetramer. In the presence of ATP, both rly-TK1Val-106 and rly-TK1Met-106 elute as tetramers (results not shown). Thus, rLy-TK1Val-106 shows the same ATP-dependent dimer/tetramer transition as Ly-TK1, whereas rLy-TK1Met-106 is a permanent tetramer. This behavior of rLy-TK1Met-106 is in agreement with our earlier results (9Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Jensen H.K. Tyrsted G. Advan. Enzyme Regul. 1995; 35: 69-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) with rTFi-TK1, derived from the cDNA clone of Bradshaw and Deininger (10Bradshaw Jr., H.D. Deininger P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2316-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), with methionine as the amino acid at position 106. Fig. 4demonstrates that the stability of rLy-TK1Met-106 is considerably lower than that of the rLy-TK1Val-106. At 25 °C, rly-TK1Met-106 was very unstable, and more than 50% of the activity was lost within 4 min. Therefore, the stability experiments were performed at 15 °C. Also here, rLy-TK1Met-106 appeared unstable because thet 12 value was 41 min. In contrast, when incubated at 15 °C, more than 50% of the activity of rLy-TK1Val-106 was preserved after incubation for 6 h (t 12 was 392 min). At assay conditions, where ATP, BSA, and CHAPS are present, both enzymes are stable. The different stabilities stress the impact of amino acid 106 for the properties of TK1. To clarify the naturally occurring bases and the resulting amino acids at positions 106 and 211, we have sequenced genomic DNA and cDNA from a number of cell lines and from stimulated lymphocytes from several healthy donors. Genomic DNA fragments of 166 base pairs containing the codon for amino acid 106 from four colon cancer cell lines, HeLa cells, and lymphocytes from four healthy donors, all had a GTG codon for valine at position 106. The complete coding region of TK1 cDNAs from leukemic cell lines, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes from five healthy donors were sequenced, and the differences are summarized in TableI. As can be seen, sequence analysis of the TK1 cDNAs r"

This isomer has not been identified yet. In contrast, the attempted synthesis of a diphosphorus analog of amidinium salts leads to the cyclic carbanionic form. There is no precedent for such a transformation of a carbocationic center into a carbanionic center, but with the help of heavier main-group elements, numerous examples can be imagined.

https://openalex.org/W2133305838,"Numerous lines of evidence indicate that some of the neurotoxicity associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is due to proteolytic fragments of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Most research has focused on the amyloid β peptide (Aβ). However, the possible role of other cleaved products of APP is less clear. We have previously shown that a recombinant carboxy-terminal 105 amino acid fragment (CT 105) of APP induced strong nonselective inward currents in Xenopus oocyte; it also revealed neurotoxicity in PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons, blocked later phase of long-term potentiation in rat hippocampus in vivo, and induced memory deficits and neuropathological changes in mice. We report here that the pretreatment with CT 105 for 24 h at a 10 μM concentration increases intracellular calcium concentration by about twofold in SK-N-SH and PC 12 cells, but not in U251 cells, originated from human glioblastoma. In addition, the calcium increase and toxicity induced by CT 105 were reduced by cholesterol and MK 801 in SK-N-SH and PC 12 cells, whereas the toxicity of Aβ1–42 was attenuated by nifedipine and verapamil. CT 105 rendered SK-N-SH cells and rat primary cortical neurons more vulnerable to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Also, conformational studies using circular dichroism experiments showed that CT 105 has ~15% of β-sheet content in phosphate buffer and aqueous 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol solutions. However, the content of β-sheet conformation in dodecyl phosphocholine micelle or in the negatively charged vesicles, is increased to 22%-23%. The results of this study showed that CT 105 disrupts calcium homeostasis and renders neuronal cells more vulnerable to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, and that some portion of CT 105 has partial β-sheet conformation in various environments, which may be related to the self-aggregation and toxicity. This may be significantly possibly involved in inducing the neurotoxicity characteristic of AD.–Kim, H.-S., Park, C. H., Cha, S. H., Lee, J.-H., Lee, S., Kim, Y., Rah, J.-C., Jeong, S.-J., Suh, Y.-H.

https://openalex.org/W2163862459,"Bcr-Abl contributes prominently to the development of most chronic myeloid leukemias (CMLs). Prior work has identified the adapter protein CRKL as a major substrate of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. CRKL can also bind via its first SH3 domain [SH3(1)] to specific sequences in Bcr-Abl. Cell-penetrating peptides were developed that bind with high affinity and selectivity to the SH3(1) domain of CRKL. They disrupt Bcr-Abl-CRKL complexes and strongly reduce the proliferation of primary CML blast cells and cell lines established from Bcr-Abl-positive patients. Activation-specific antibodies against phosphorylated MAP kinase (MAPK) showed that MAPK activity is down-regulated in blast cells treated with the CRKLSH3(1) blocker peptides. We conclude that the Bcr-Abl-CRKL complexes are largely dependent on the CRKLSH3(1) domain, that the central mitogenic cascade is down-regulated as a consequence of the disruption of CRKLSH3(1) interactions, and that CRKL therefore contributes to the proliferation of CML blast cells.–Kardinal, C., Konkol, B., Schulz, A., Posern, G., Lin, H., Adermann, K., Eulitz, M., Estrov, Z., Talpaz, M., Arlinghaus, R.

https://openalex.org/W4229906281,"Enteropathogenic Yersinia bacteria trigger the production of the proinflammatory chemokine IL-8, an important chemokine for the recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Yersinia is resistant to phagocytosis by PMN, and the recruitment of these cells is thought to be part of a pathogenic strategy of Yersinia to establish infection by allowing the pathogen to gain access to, and disseminate within, host tissue. We report here that Yersinia expressing the outer membrane protein invasin triggers IL-8 production in epithelial cells. The 195 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of invasin when linked to latex beads are sufficient to trigger IL-8 production. By means of IL-8 promoter reporter gene assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments, the minimal optimal region of the IL-8 promoter responsive to invasin was identified and invasin-responsive control elements were characterized. Invasin-induced activation of the IL-8 promoter was found to be mediated through a previously identified NF-kappaB element. This NF-kappaB binding site preferentially binds Rel p65-p65 homodimers as well as some p50-p65 heterodimers in response to stimulation by invasin. Invasin-induced NF-kappaB activation correlated with degradation of IkappaBalpha and the inhibition of NF-kappaB by specific inhibitors of IkappaB activation blocked invasin-induced IL-8 secretion. Invasin-triggered IL-8 production does not depend on invasin-triggered uptake of bacteria, and is independent of a functional PI3-kinase. This report is the first to demonstrate the molecular basis of IL-8 production triggered by enteropathogenic bacteria. Together, these data elucidate the possible early pathomechanisms operating in Yersinia infection and may have implications for the design of novel therapeutics directed against this enteropathogen."
https://openalex.org/W4251884284,"Glial activation contiguous to deposits of amyloid peptide (Abeta) is a characteristic feature in Alzheimer's disease. We performed complementary in vitro and in vivo experiments to study the extent, kinetics, and mechanisms of microglial generation of nitric oxide (NO) induced by challenge with Abeta. We showed that Abeta fibrils dose-dependently induced a marked release of stable metabolites of NO in vivo that was strikingly similar regarding extent and temporal profile to the one in the parallel designed microglial cell culture experiments. However, costimulation with interferon gamma, which was a prerequisite for Abeta-induced NO generation in vitro, was not required in vivo, demonstrating that factors are present in the living brain that activate glial cells synergistically with Abeta. Therefore, in Alzheimer's disease, deposits of Abeta fibrils alone may be sufficient to induce a chronic release of neurotoxic microglial products, explaining the progressive neurodegeneration associated with this disease. Our observation that systemic administration of selective iNOS inhibitors abolishes Abeta-induced NO generation in vivo may have implications for therapy of Alzheimer's disease."

DesMarteau explains in his Perspective that many superacids have undesirable properties, because after proton donation, the resulting anion may interact strongly with the protonated base or the solvent. Reed et al. report the discovery of a superacid that overcomes this problem. In the anion, charge is distributed efficiently over many atoms, reducing unwanted interactions."

The identification of tetraplex d(CGG)n destabilizing proteins (Fry, M., and Loeb, L. A.(1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 12797–12803; Weisman-Shomer, P., Naot, Y., and Fry, M. (2000) J. Biol.

The principal binding protein was identified as Ku antigen by its partial amino acid sequence and antigenicity. The purified 88/75-kDa heterodimeric Ku bound with similar affinities (K d ∼1.8–10.2 × 10−9mol/liter) to double-stranded d(CGG)8·d(CCG)8, hairpin d(CGG)8, single-stranded d(CII)8, or tetraplex structures of telomeric or IgG switch region sequences.

In this work we searched for a protein that might act to stabilize secondary structures of d(CGG)n. We fractionated proteins from cultured human lymphoblastoid cells based on their binding to d(CGG)8. We report the purification of a major d(CGG)n binding protein of 88- and 75-kDa subunits. This heterodimeric d(CGG)n binding protein was identified as Ku antigen by its fully homologous partial amino acid sequence and recognition by monospecific anti-Ku antigen antibodies. The purified Ku antigen preferentially and tightly bound G′2 d(CGG)n bimolecular tetraplexes. Association with Ku antigen preferentially protected G′2 d(CGG)8 tetraplex against digestion by micrococcal nuclease and impeded its unwinding by the tetraplex d(CGG)n destabilizing protein qTBP42. We speculate that Ku antigen or other proteins that tightly bind secondary structures of d(CGG)n stretches may play a role in stabilizing folded structures of this sequence in genomic DNA.

Cells seeded into roller bottles at a density of 7.5 × 104 cells/ml were harvested at a density of 5.0 × 106 cells/ml by centrifugation at 4 °C at 1000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was rinsed twice with 10 volumes of ice-cold phosphate buffered saline and was immediately frozen and stored at −80 °C until used. A human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cell line was the gift of Dr. George M. Martin (University of Washington). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells seeded in 75-cm2 flasks were grown at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and were harvested by exposure to 0.25% trypsin after reaching 85% confluence. The cells were collected, rinsed, and stored as described above. DNA oligomers were purified by electrophoresis through an 8.0 m urea, 15% polyacrylamide denaturing gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 19:1) in 0.5× TBE buffer (1.25 mm EDTA in 45 mm Tris borate buffer, pH 8.3). The DNA was isolated from the gel as described previously (31Weisman-Shomer P. Fry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3306-3312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that salt and acrylamide residues were removed from the isolated DNA either by precipitation and wash of the DNA by ethanol or by Sep-Pak column chromatography. Purified DNA oligomers were 5′ end labeled with32P in a T4 polynucleotide kinase catalyzed reaction and maintained in their single-stranded conformation by being stored as 0.25 μm solution in water and by boiling immediately prior to use. Double-stranded hook(CGG)8·hook(CCG)8 DNA (oligomer sequences are listed in Table I) was prepared by heating at 90 °C for 2 min an equimolar mixture of the complementary 5′ end labeled oligomers (36 μm each in TE buffer), followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Bimolecular quadruplex DNA structures of32P-5′-labeled d(CGG)8 were formed by incubating 30–60 μm oligomers at 4 °C for ∼20 h in 10 μl of TE buffer containing 300 mm NaCl. Bimolecular tetraplex DNA structure of 32P-5′-labeled TeR2 were similarly generated except that the oligomers were incubated at 37 °C for ∼20 h in TE buffer containing 1 m KCl. Tetramolecular quadruplex DNA structure of oligomer Q was prepared by incubating 32P-5′-labeled oligomer at 50 °C for ∼20 h in TE buffer, 300 mm NaCl. Formed tetraplex DNA structures and residual single-stranded oligomers were precipitated and washed by ethanol and resuspended and stored at 4 °C in TE buffer containing 100 mm of the respective salt. For some experiments the tetraplex DNA structures were enriched by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (29Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol.

Briefly, 1.0–2.0 ng of32P-5′-labeled d(CGG)8 was incubated at 4 °C for 20 min with crude or purified protein fractions in 10 μl of final volume of buffer D (0.5 mm DTT, 1.0 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5). Protein-DNA complexes were resolved from unbound DNA by electrophoresis of the reaction mixture at 4 °C and at a constant current of 15 mA through a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE running buffer. Formed protein-DNA complexes were visualized in gels that were dried on Whatman 3MM filter paper and exposed to x-ray film. To quantify the electrophoretically resolved free and protein-bound DNA, the gels were dried on DE-81 filter paper and exposed to a PhosphorImager plate (Fuji). Amounts of protein-bound and unbound DNA were calculated by phosphorimaging quantification of their corresponding radioactive bands and the predetermined specific activity of the labeled DNA. One unit of DNA binding activity was defined as the amount of protein that formed a complex with 0.01 ng of32P-5′-labeled d(CGG)8. SDS-PAGE and silver or Coomassie Blue staining of resolved proteins were conducted as described previously (31Weisman-Shomer P. Fry M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3306-3312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Erlitzki R. Fry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15881-15890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10-μl aliquots of DNA binding reaction mixtures placed in microtiter plate wells at a distance of 6 cm from a UV light source (UVP, San Gabriel) were irradiated at 4 °C for 5 min at 254 nm (580 microwatts/cm2 at 6 inches). An equal volume of denaturing electrophoresis-loading buffer was added to the irradiated samples, which were than boiled for 5 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Frozen lymphoblastoid TK-6 cells (packed volume, 20 ml) or neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells (packed volume, 10 ml) were thawed at 4 °C and suspended in an equal volume of ice-cold buffer S (0.8m NaCl, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml STI, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm DTT, 1.0 mmEDTA, 20% glycerol, 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5). All the subsequent steps of protein purification were conducted at 4 °C. The cells were disrupted in a Dounce homogenizer equipped with a B pestle, and the cell extract was centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 45 min. The supernatant was collected, and the pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of the above buffer containing 0.4m NaCl (buffer S1), homogenized, and centrifuged as described above. The combined two supernatant fractions were chromatographed through a DE-52 column equilibrated in buffer D containing 0.4 m NaCl to remove residual DNA (31Weisman-Shomer P. Fry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3306-3312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following overnight dialysis against ∼200 volumes of buffer D, proteins were precipitated by addition of ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 55%, and the protein precipitate was suspended in and dialyzed against buffer D. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis detected most of the activity of a major d(CGG)8 binding protein in the 55% (NH4)2SO4precipitate. This fraction was chromatographed on a DE-52 column as described (33Sarig G. Weisman-Shomer P. Erlitzki R. Fry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4474-4482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) except that absorbed proteins were eluted from the column by a linear gradient of 50–400 mm NaCl in buffer D. To stabilize the eluted d(CGG)8 binding activity and to prevent its adsorption to glass or plastic, fractions were collected at each consecutive step of column chromatography into STI and Nonidet P-40 at final concentrations of 0.2 mg/ml and 0.05%, respectively. Aliquots of the collected fractions were dialyzed against ∼200 volumes of buffer D, and d(CGG)8 binding activity was detected in fractions that were eluted from the column by 120–250 mm NaCl. Pooled active fractions were dialyzed overnight against ∼200 volumes of buffer P (0.5 mm DTT, 1.0 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 50 mm KPO4buffer, pH 7.3) and loaded onto a P-11 column equilibrated with the same buffer (33Sarig G. Weisman-Shomer P. Erlitzki R. Fry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4474-4482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Adsorbed proteins were eluted by a linear gradient of buffer P containing 50–500 mm KPO4, and aliquots of each collected fraction were dialyzed against buffer D. The major portion of the d(CGG)8 binding activity was detected in fractions that were eluted from P-11 by 130–380 mmKPO4. Pooled active fractions were dialyzed overnight against ∼200 volumes of buffer D and loaded onto an affinity chromatography column of d(CGG)16 covalently linked to Sepharose 4B. To prepare the affinity matrix, CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B was suspended in water and washed over a Millipore funnel by 30 volumes each of 1.0 mm HCl and H2O followed by 10 volumes of 10 mm KPO4 buffer, pH 8.0. The matrix, suspended in the last wash buffer was mixed with a solution that contained in the same buffer, 250 μg/ml of unlabeled d(CGG)16 and 0.4 ng/ml of 32P-5′-labeled d(CGG)16, which served to monitor the efficacy of DNA binding to the matrix. The mixture was slowly rotated at room temperature overnight, and the matrix was subsequently washed over a Millipore funnel by 20 volumes of H2O and 10 volumes of 1.0m ethanolamine-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. After suspending the matrix in the last wash buffer it was rotated at room temperature for additional 4 h and washed by 10 volumes each of 10 mmKPO4 buffer, pH 8.0; 1.0 m KPO4buffer, pH 8.0; 1.0 m KCl; and 300 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3 in 10 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The washed matrix was packed into a column and stored at 4 °C under the final wash buffer until used. About 20% of the 32P-5′-labeled d(CGG)16 became covalently bound to the activated Sepharose to 20 μg of d(CGG)16/ml of packed Sepharose 4B matrix. After slowly loading the protein solution onto a column pre-equilibrated with buffer D, it was washed with one column volume of buffer D, and adsorbed proteins were eluted stepwise with a single column volume each of solutions that contained 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 m NaCl in buffer D. Collected fractions were dialyzed against buffer D, and the d(CGG)8 binding activity was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis in fractions eluted by 200–500 mmNaCl. The active fractions were stored at −80 °C in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml STI and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Under these conditions the DNA binding activity remained undiminished for at least 6 months. Amounts of protein were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Partial amino acid sequence of a d(CGG)16-Sepharose purified fraction of the d(CGG)nbinding protein was determined following its resolution by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Bands of 75 and 88 kDa that corresponded to the d(CGG)8 binding activity were excised, and protein was eluted from the gel slices. The isolated proteins were digested by Lys C protease, and resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC. Amino acid sequences of selected peptides were determined by standard automated procedures, utilizing Peptide Sequencer 476A (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Two immunoassays were used to verify the identification of the d(CGG)n binding protein as Ku antigen: (a) Gel supershift. P-11 purified fraction of the binding protein was incubated with 32P-5′-labeled d(CGG)7 under standard DNA binding conditions followed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min with 0.2–0.6 μg of nonimmune goat IgG or goat antibodies directed against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 713–730 of the 86-kDa subunit of human Ku antigen or to amino acids 577–595 of the 70-kDa subunit of this protein. Shifted and supershifted32P-5′-d(CGG)7-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis at 4 °C through a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer. (b) Immune precipitation. Aliquots of the P-11 fraction of the d(CGG)nbinding protein were incubated at 4 °C for 45 min with 0.6 μg of either nonimmune goat IgG or goat anti-Ku 86 antibodies. Swollen protein G-agarose beads were added at 1.5 mg/reaction mixture and adsorption of immune complexes onto protein G was conducted at 4 °C by rotation for 4 h. Protein G-adsorbed immune complexes were removed by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 5 min, and aliquots of the supernatant fractions were analyzed by mobility shift electrophoresis for their capacity to bind 32P-5′-labeled d(CGG)7.

Here we describe a novel signaling pathway activated by the IL-5 receptor in eosinophils involving the CrkL adapter protein. We determined whether IL-5 induces activation of CrkL and STAT5 in eosinophils using both the human eosinophil-differentiated AML14.3D10 cell line and purified peripheral blood eosinophils from normal donors. Stimulation of AML14.3D10 cells or blood eosinophils with IL-5 induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the CrkL adapter and STAT5 and the association of CrkL and STAT5 in vivo as evidenced by the detection of STAT5 in anti-CrkL immunoprecipitates. The resulting CrkL·STAT5 complexes translocated to the nucleus and bound STAT5 consensus DNA-binding sites present in the promoters of IL-5-regulated genes, as shown in gel mobility and antibody supershift assays. IL-5 also induced marked activity of an 8X-GAS (interferon γ-activated site)-luciferase reporter construct in transient transfections of AML14.3D10 eosinophils, demonstrating that these complexes play a functional role in IL-5 signaling. CrkL was also found to interact, via its N-terminal SH3 domain, with C3G, a guanine exchange factor for the small G-protein Rap1, which was also rapidly activated in an IL-5-dependent manner in these cells, establishing that CrkL mediates downstream activation of at least two signaling cascades in IL-5-stimulated eosinophils. Thus, the CrkL adapter plays an important role in IL-5 signaling in the eosinophil, acting as a nuclear adapter for STAT5 and as an upstream regulator of the C3G-Rap1 signaling pathway.

IL-5R has a heterodimeric high affinity structure composed of an eosinophil-specific IL-5-binding α subunit and a βcsubunit that is shared with the receptors for IL-3 and GM-CSF (19Tavernier J.

Engagement of IL-5R is critical for entry of multipotential hematopoietic progenitors into the eosinophil developmental program, especially since IL-5 up-regulates expression of its own receptor on CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors (23Robinson D.S.

The α subunit of the receptor is required both for high affinity ligand binding (28Tavernier J. Cornelis S. Devos R. Guisez Y. Plaetinck G. Van der Heyden J.

Elucidation of IL-5 signaling pathways is therefore extremely pertinent to understanding the mechanisms involved in regulating both the normal physiologic and pro-inflammatory activities of the eosinophil in allergic and related immune responses (31Adachi T. Alam R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C623-C633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Since neither subunit of IL-5R possesses inherent tyrosine kinase activity, its phosphorylation requires receptor-associated tyrosine kinases, including Lyn, JAK1, and JAK2 (33Pazdrak K. Schreiber D. Forsythe P. Justement L. Alam R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1827-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 34van der Bruggen T. Caldenhoven E. Kanters D. Coffer P. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W.

Stimulation of eosinophils with IL-5 rapidly induces the phosphorylation and activation of JAK1, JAK2, and Lyn (34van der Bruggen T. Caldenhoven E. Kanters D. Coffer P. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Blood. 1995; 85: 1442-1448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Alam R. Pazdrak K. Stafford S. Forsythe P. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1995; 107: 226-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which then phosphorylate both the α and βc subunits of the IL-5R, resulting in the recruitment and activation of Shc, Grb2, SHP-2, and the STAT proteins, primarily STAT1 and STAT5 (36Pazdrak K. Stafford S. Alam R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 397-402PubMed Google Scholar, 42Ogata N. Kikuchi Y. Kouro T. Tomonaga M. Takatsu K. Int. Arch.

The Janus kinases serve to couple these STAT proteins to IL-5R activation. Previous work suggests that signaling through the cytoplasmic tail of the α chain principally utilizes the JAK2-STAT5 pathway (42Ogata N. Kikuchi Y. Kouro T. Tomonaga M. Takatsu K. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1997; 114: 24-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 44Kouro T. Kikuchi Y. Kanazawa H. Hirokawa K. Harada N. Shiiba M. Wakao H. Takaki S. Takatsu K. Int.

Blood. 1998; 91: 2264-3371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas signaling through the βc chain involves the preferential binding and activation of the phosphatase SHP-2 as well as Shc-Grb2, leading to activation of the Ras-Raf1-MEK-ERK-MAPK pathway (43Pazdrak K. Adachi T. Alam R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, IL-5 induces the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in eosinophils (46Bracke M. Coffer P.J. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6768-6774PubMed Google Scholar). The functional relevance of the various IL-5 signaling pathways has recently been evaluated using both pharmacologic and peptide inhibitors as well as antisense oligonucleotide strategies (31Adachi T. Alam R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C623-C633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Lyn and JAK2 kinases were shown to be important for eosinophil development from bone marrow-derived progenitors (47Adachi T. Stafford S. Sur S. Alam R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 939-946PubMed Google Scholar). These tyrosine kinases, along with the SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase, were also shown to be required for the anti-apoptotic effects of IL-5 in terms of prolonged eosinophil survival (32Pazdrak K. Olszewska-Pazdrak B. Stafford S. Garofalo R.P. Alam R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 47Adachi T. Stafford S. Sur S. Alam R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 939-946PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Lyn and JAK2 did not appear to play any role in eosinophil degranulation or expression of surface adhesion molecules, whereas the Raf1 kinase appears to be necessary for eosinophil activation, secretion, and up-regulation of adhesion molecule function (32Pazdrak K. Olszewska-Pazdrak B. Stafford S. Garofalo R.P. Alam R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence for the existence of a novel signaling cascade activated by IL-5 in eosinophils involving the CrkL adapter. Our data demonstrate that CrkL is tyrosine-phosphorylated in an IL-5-dependent manner and forms a signaling complex with STAT5, which is also phosphorylated during IL-5 stimulation. We also demonstrate that IL-5 induces functionally active CrkL·STAT5 signaling complexes in the nucleus that bind a palindromic sequence present in the promoters of certain IL-5-inducible genes to regulate gene transcription. In addition, we establish that activation of CrkL by IL-5R ultimately results in activation of C3G and the small G-protein Rap1 to mediate IL-5 responses. The IL-5R-positive, eosinophil-differentiated cell line AML14.3D10 (where AML refers to acute myeloid leukemia) (48Paul C.C. Mahrer S. Tolbert M. Elbert B.L. Wong I.C. Ackerman S.J. Baumann M.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 3737-3744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and its parental cell line, AML14 (49Paul C.C. Tolbert M. Mahrer S. Singh A. Grace M.J.

Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), also IL-5R-positive, were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 5 × 10−5m β-mercaptoethanol without any antibiotics. Cells were passaged every 3–4 days and maintained at a concentration between 3 × 105 and 1 × 106 cells/ml. The AML14.3D10 cell line is a fully differentiated, nearly mature eosinophil line that proliferates as a granulated cell (48Paul C.C. Mahrer S. Tolbert M. Elbert B.L. Wong I.C. Ackerman S.J. Baumann M.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 3737-3744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It contains eosinophil secondary (specific) granules and displays many of the characteristics of mature peripheral blood eosinophils, including expression of the major protein mediators of the eosinophil such as the granule cationic proteins major basic protein, eosinophil peroxidase, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, and eosinophil cationic protein. In addition, it can be induced to express chemokine receptors (e.g. for eotaxins) (51Zimmermann N. Daugherty B.L. Stark J.M. Rothenberg M.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and expresses GM-CSF, which drives its proliferation, differentiation, and survival in culture (52Paul C.C. Mahrer S. McMannama K. Baumann M.A. Am. J. Hematol. 1997; 56: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The mature nature of this cell line and its utility for studies of eosinophil biology were described in a recent review (53Baumann M.A. Paul C.C. Stem Cells. 1998; 16: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recombinant human IL-5 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Antibodies against STAT5a, STAT5b, and CrkL were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). A neutralizing antibody to GM-CSF was obtained from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). The antibody to STAT5 used for immunoprecipitations and Western blotting was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Blood (150 ml) from normal, non-allergic, healthy donors was used to isolate eosinophils following methods originally described by Hansel et al.(54Hansel T.T. De Vries I.J. Iff T. Rihs S. Wandzilak M. Betz S. Blaser K. Walker C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Informed consent was obtained according to the guidelines established by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Illinois (Chicago). Sedimentation of erythrocytes was performed at room temperature for 1 h by mixing 50 ml of peripheral blood with 10 ml of Macrodex (6% dextran 70 in 0.9% sodium chloride) and 200 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. The leukocyte-containing plasma fraction was harvested, diluted 1:1 with phosphate-buffered saline, and overlaid on Ficoll-Paque gradients (35 ml of cell mixture onto 15 ml of Ficoll-Paque 400, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala), followed by centrifugation for 30 min at room temperature. The granulocyte pellets were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline; the remaining erythrocytes were lysed using brief exposure to distilled water; and the eosinophils were isolated using a MACS CD16 kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) to remove neutrophils following the methods described by the manufacturer (55Miltenyi S. Muller W. Weichel W. Radbruch A. Cytometry. 1990; 11: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). Total cell counts and eosinophil counts were performed using Randolph's stain. Eosinophil purity was routinely >98% as assessed by differential counts of Wright's/Giemsa-stained cytocentrifuge slides, with eosinophil viability >95% as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. Purified eosinophils were incubated for 30 min in the presence or absence of IL-5, and nuclear extracts for gel shift analysis were prepared immediately as described below. AML14.3D10 cells were split and maintained at 1 × 106/ml 1 day before each experiment. A total of 2 × 107 AML14.3D10 cells were resuspended in 10 ml of fresh complete medium and stimulated with IL-5 (25 ng/ml) for the indicated times at 37 °C. The cells were collected at each time point by immediate centrifugation. In some experiments, the AML14.3D10 cells were first precultured with neutralizing anti-GM-CSF antibody for 2 days prior to stimulation with IL-5 to block autocrine signaling by GM-CSF produced by these cells in culture (52Paul C.C.

Stem Cells. 1998; 16: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cell lysis using phosphorylation lysis buffer, immunoprecipitations, and immunoblotting using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method were performed as described previously (56Uddin S. Yenush L.

Nuclear extracts were prepared using a rapid micropreparation technique for small numbers of cells (58Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar) with minor modifications, including the use of protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) and the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm) and diisopropyl fluorophosphate (1 mm) to the resuspension and lysis buffers (59Sun Z. Yergeau D.A. Wong I.C. Tuypens T. Tavernier J. Paul C.C. Baumann M.A. Auron P.A. Tenen D.G. Ackerman S.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 211: 173-187PubMed Google Scholar, 60Sun Z. Yergeau D.A.

Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes for electrophoretic mobility shift assays contained the STAT5-binding site of the β-casein (5′-AGATTTCTAGGAATTCAAATC-3′) and ntcp(5′-TGTCATTCTTGGAAAAATA-3′) promoters. The oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). To generate probes for electrophoretic mobility shift assays, 10 pmol of the double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase, and the double-stranded probes were purified on 15% polyacrylamide gels as described previously (60Sun Z. Yergeau D.A. Tuypens T. Tavernier J. Paul C.C. Baumann M.A. Tenen D.G. Ackerman S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1462-1471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For mobility shift assays, nuclear protein-DNA binding reactions were carried out at room temperature for 30 min in a final volume of 20 μl containing the labeled oligonucleotide probe (10,000 cpm), 3 μg of nuclear extract, and 2 μg of poly(dI·dC) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9) containing 50 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol. Specificity of complex formation was assessed using competition with a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide competitor added to the binding reaction 10 min prior to the addition of the labeled probe. For antibody supershift assays, 1 μg of antibody raised against STAT5a, STAT5b, or CrkL was preincubated with the nuclear extracts in gel shift binding buffer at room temperature for 30–60 min, followed by the addition of the labeled probe and further incubation for 30 min at room temperature. The entire binding reaction was loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide weight ratio of 19:1) that had been pre-electrophoresed for 1 h at 4 °C. Electrophoresis was carried out at 11 V/cm (1.5 h for a 10 × 10-cm gel and 2 h for a 16 × 12-cm gel) in a 4 °C cold room. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography using either a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager or Kodak BioMax film. Expression constructs (pGEX-CrkL-N-SH3 and pGEX-CrkL-C-SH3) for the production of the GST-CrkL-N-SH3 and GST-CrkL-C-SH3 fusion proteins were kindly provided by Dr. Brian Druker (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland OR) (61Heaney C. Kolibaba K. Bhat A. Oda T. Ohno S. Fanning S. Druker B.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 297-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Production of the glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and binding experiments were performed as described previously (56Uddin S. Yenush L. Sun X.J. Sweet M.E. White M.F. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15938-15941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The activation state of Rap1 was determined essentially as described previously (62Alsayed Y. Uddin S. Ahmad S. Majchrzak B. Druker B.J. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1800-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The pGEX construct for the production of a GST-Ral GDS-RBD fusion protein was kindly provided by Dr. Johannes Bos (Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands). Briefly, AML14.3D10 cells were cultured with or without the addition of IL-5 for the indicated times and lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer, and the cell lysates were incubated with the GST-Ral GDS-RBD fusion protein that had been precoupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Following incubation of the cell lysates with solid-phase GST-Ral GDS-RBD fusion protein, bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes, and the activated/GTP-bound form of Rap1 was detected by immunoblotting with a monoclonal anti-Rap1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) using the ECL method. We first sought to determine whether IL-5 treatment of the eosinophil-differentiated AML14.3D10 cell line would induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the CrkL adapter. AML14.3D10 eosinophils were cultured with 25 ng/ml IL-5 for 15 min at 37 °C; and after cell lysis, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-CrkL antibody and immunoblotted with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. CrkL was strongly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in an IL-5-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). The presence of equal amounts of CrkL in the immunoprecipitates was confirmed by stripping the blots and reprobing them with the anti-CrkL antibody (Fig.1 B). In addition to CrkL, a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein migrating at ∼97 kDa was co-immunoprecipitated by the anti-CrkL antibody from lysates of IL-5-treated cells (Fig. 1 A). Since the molecular mass of this protein was similar to that of STAT5, we determined whether the 97-kDa phosphoprotein seen in anti-CrkL immunoprecipitates from IL-5-treated cells corresponds to STAT5. Reprobing the blot (Fig. 1 A) with an anti-STAT5 antibody demonstrated that this protein was indeed STAT5 (Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, the interaction of CrkL with STAT5 was IL-5-dependent (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that it is mediated by binding of the CrkL SH2 domain to the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of STAT5. Thus, in response to activation of IL-5R on AML14.3D10 eosinophils, there is a rapid induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkL and its interaction with STAT5. The formation of CrkL·STAT5 complexes in these cells was likewise induced in response to IL-3 or GM-CSF treatment (Fig.2). Similar amounts of STAT5 were co-precipitated by the anti-CrkL antibody in response to IL-5 or IL-3/GM-CSF stimulation (Fig. 2), suggesting that the stoichiometry of the IL-5-induced CrkL/STAT5 interaction is similar to the stoichiometries of the CrkL/STAT5 associations occurring in response to cell activation with IL-3 or GM-CSF.Figure 4Induction of nuclear STAT5 DNA-binding activity in AML14.3D10 eosinophils and peripheral blood eosinophils by IL-5. A, AML14.3D10 cells were cultured for 48 h with or without the addition of neutralizing anti-GM-CSF antibody as indicated prior to adding the IL-5 stimulus. Nuclear extracts were prepared 15 and 30 min after the addition of IL-5. Gel shift analysis was performed using the STAT5 consensus site in the β-casein promoter as probe. A 50-fold molar excess of either the unlabeled β-casein STAT5 oligonucleotide probe or an irrelevant oligonucleotide containing a CAAT/enhancer-binding protein-binding site (negative control) was added as competit"
https://openalex.org/W2147700603,"Glial activation contiguous to deposits of amyloid peptide (Aβ) is a characteristic feature in Alzheimer's disease. We performed complementary in vitro and in vivo experiments to study the extent, kinetics, and mechanisms of microglial generation of nitric oxide (NO) induced by challenge with Aβ. We showed that Aβ fibrils dose-dependently induced a marked release of stable metabolites of NO in vivo that was strikingly similar regarding extent and temporal profile to the one in the parallel designed microglial cell culture experiments. However, costimulation with interferon γ, which was a prerequisite for Aβ-induced NO generation in vitro, was not required in vivo, demonstrating that factors are present in the living brain that activate glial cells synergistically with Aβ. Therefore, in Alzheimer's disease, deposits of Aβ fibrils alone may be sufficient to induce a chronic release of neurotoxic microglial products, explaining the progressive neurodegeneration associated with this disease. Our observation that systemic administration of selective iNOS inhibitors abolishes Aβ-induced NO generation in vivo may have implications for therapy of Alzheimer's disease.–Ishii, K., Muelhauser, F., Liebl, U., Picard, M., Kühl, S., Penke, B., Bayer, T., Wiessler, M., Hennerici, M., Beyreuther, K., Hartmann, T., Fassbender, K.

https://openalex.org/W4255455244,"Bcr-Abl contributes prominently to the development of most chronic myeloid leukemias (CMLs). Prior work has identified the adapter protein CRKL as a major substrate of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. CRKL can also bind via its first SH3 domain [SH3(1)] to specific sequences in Bcr-Abl. Cell-penetrating peptides were developed that bind with high affinity and selectivity to the SH3(1) domain of CRKL. They disrupt Bcr-Abl-CRKL complexes and strongly reduce the proliferation of primary CML blast cells and cell lines established from Bcr-Abl-positive patients. Activation-specific antibodies against phosphorylated MAP kinase (MAPK) showed that MAPK activity is down-regulated in blast cells treated with the CRKLSH3(1) blocker peptides. We conclude that the Bcr-Abl-CRKL complexes are largely dependent on the CRKLSH3(1) domain, that the central mitogenic cascade is down-regulated as a consequence of the disruption of CRKLSH3(1) interactions, and that CRKL therefore contributes to the proliferation of CML blast cells.–Kardinal, C., Konkol, B., Schulz, A., Posern, G., Lin, H., Adermann, K., Eulitz, M., Estrov, Z., Talpaz, M., Arlinghaus, R.
