Preparatory activity is distributed across several brain regions7,8, but it is unclear which brain areas are involved and how this activity is mediated by multi-regional interactions. The cerebellum is thought to be primarily involved in the short-timescale control of movement9–12; however, roles for this structure in cognitive processes have also been proposed13–16. In humans, cerebellar damage can cause defects in planning and working memory13. Here we show that persistent representation of information in the frontal cortex during motor planning is dependent on the cerebellum. Mice performed a sensory discrimination task in which they used short-term memory to plan a future directional movement. A transient perturbation in the medial deep cerebellar nucleus (fastigial nucleus) disrupted subsequent correct responses without hampering movement execution. Preparatory activity was observed in both the frontal cortex and the cerebellar nuclei, seconds before the onset of movement. The silencing of frontal cortex activity abolished preparatory activity in the cerebellar nuclei, and fastigial activity was necessary to maintain cortical preparatory activity. Fastigial output selectively targeted the behaviourally relevant part of the frontal cortex through the thalamus, thus closing a cortico-cerebellar loop. Our results support the view that persistent neural dynamics during motor planning is maintained by neural circuits that span multiple brain regions17, and that cerebellar computations extend beyond online motor control13–15,18. The cerebellum is critical for the coding of future movement in the frontal cortex."

This standard siren method was utilized to measure the Hubble constant using LIGO-Virgo's detection of the binary neutron-star merger GW170817, as well as optical identifications of the host galaxy, NGC 4993. The novel and independent measurement is of particular interest given the existing tension between the value of the Hubble constant determined using Type Ia supernovae via the local distance ladder ($73.24 \pm 1.74$) and that from Cosmic Microwave Background observations ($66.93 \pm 0.62$) by $\sim 3$ sigma. Local distance ladder observations may achieve a precision of $1\%$ within 5 years, but at present there are no indications that further observations will substantially reduce the existing discrepancies. In addition to clarifying the discrepancy between existing low and high-redshift measurements, a precision measurement of the Hubble constant is of crucial value in elucidating the nature of the dark energy. Here we show that LIGO and Virgo can be expected to constrain the Hubble constant to a precision of $\sim2\%$ within 5 years and $\sim1\%$ within a decade."
https://openalex.org/W2896268397,"Losses and gains in species diversity affect ecological stability1–7 and the sustainability of ecosystem functions and services8–13. Experiments and models have revealed positive, negative and no effects of diversity on individual components of stability, such as temporal variability, resistance and resilience2,3,6,11,12,14. How these stability components covary remains poorly understood15. Similarly, the effects of diversity on overall ecosystem stability16, which is conceptually akin to ecosystem multifunctionality17,18, remain unknown. Here we studied communities of aquatic ciliates to understand how temporal variability, resistance and overall ecosystem stability responded to diversity (that is, species richness) in a large experiment involving 690 micro-ecosystems sampled 19 times over 40 days, resulting in 12,939 samplings. Species richness increased temporal stability but decreased resistance to warming. Thus, two stability components covaried negatively along the diversity gradient. Previous biodiversity manipulation studies rarely reported such negative covariation despite general predictions of the negative effects of diversity on individual stability components3. Integrating our findings with the ecosystem multifunctionality concept revealed hump- and U-shaped effects of diversity on overall ecosystem stability. That is, biodiversity can increase overall ecosystem stability when biodiversity is low, and decrease it when biodiversity is high, or the opposite with a U-shaped relationship. The effects of diversity on ecosystem multifunctionality would also be hump- or U-shaped if diversity had positive effects on some functions and negative effects on others. Linking the ecosystem multifunctionality concept and ecosystem stability can transform the perceived effects of diversity on ecological stability and may help to translate this science into policy-relevant information. Species richness was found to increase temporal stability but decrease resistance to warming in an experiment involving 690 micro-ecosystems consisting of 1 to 6 species of bacterivorous ciliates that were sampled over 40 days."
https://openalex.org/W2807855930,"Owing to the low-gravity conditions in space, space-borne laboratories enable experiments with extended free-fall times. Because Bose–Einstein condensates have an extremely low expansion energy, space-borne atom interferometers based on Bose–Einstein condensation have the potential to have much greater sensitivity to inertial forces than do similar ground-based interferometers. On 23 January 2017, as part of the sounding-rocket mission MAIUS-1, we created Bose–Einstein condensates in space and conducted 110 experiments central to matter-wave interferometry, including laser cooling and trapping of atoms in the presence of the large accelerations experienced during launch. Here we report on experiments conducted during the six minutes of in-space flight in which we studied the phase transition from a thermal ensemble to a Bose–Einstein condensate and the collective dynamics of the resulting condensate. Our results provide insights into conducting cold-atom experiments in space, such as precision interferometry, and pave the way to miniaturizing cold-atom and photon-based quantum information concepts for satellite-based implementation. In addition, space-borne Bose–Einstein condensation opens up the possibility of quantum gas experiments in low-gravity conditions1,2. A Bose–Einstein condensate is created in space that has sufficient stability to enable its characteristic dynamics to be studied."
https://openalex.org/W2896256743,"Immune checkpoint blockade therapy has been successful in treating some types of cancer but has not shown clinical benefits for treating leukaemia1. This result suggests that leukaemia uses unique mechanisms to evade this therapy. Certain immune inhibitory receptors that are expressed by normal immune cells are also present on leukaemia cells. Whether these receptors can initiate immune-related primary signalling in tumour cells remains unknown. Here we use mouse models and human cells to show that LILRB4, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif-containing receptor and a marker of monocytic leukaemia, supports tumour cell infiltration into tissues and suppresses T cell activity via a signalling pathway that involves APOE, LILRB4, SHP-2, uPAR and ARG1 in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells. Deletion of LILRB4 or the use of antibodies to block LILRB4 signalling impeded AML development. Thus, LILRB4 orchestrates tumour invasion pathways in monocytic leukaemia cells by creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment. LILRB4 represents a compelling target for the treatment of monocytic AML."
https://openalex.org/W2897353357,"Many evolutionarily distant pathogenic organisms have evolved similar survival strategies to evade the immune responses of their hosts. These include antigenic variation, through which an infecting organism prevents clearance by periodically altering the identity of proteins that are visible to the immune system of the host1. Antigenic variation requires large reservoirs of immunologically diverse antigen genes, which are often generated through homologous recombination, as well as mechanisms to ensure the expression of one or very few antigens at any given time. Both homologous recombination and gene expression are affected by three-dimensional genome architecture and local DNA accessibility2,3. Factors that link three-dimensional genome architecture, local chromatin conformation and antigenic variation have, to our knowledge, not yet been identified in any organism. One of the major obstacles to studying the role of genome architecture in antigenic variation has been the highly repetitive nature and heterozygosity of antigen-gene arrays, which has precluded complete genome assembly in many pathogens. Here we report the de novo haplotype-specific assembly and scaffolding of the long antigen-gene arrays of the model protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, using long-read sequencing technology and conserved features of chromosome folding4. Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) reveals a distinct partitioning of the genome, with antigen-encoding subtelomeric regions that are folded into distinct, highly compact compartments. In addition, we performed a range of analyses—Hi-C, fluorescence in situ hybridization, assays for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing—that showed that deletion of the histone variants H3.V and H4.V increases antigen-gene clustering, DNA accessibility across sites of antigen expression and switching of the expressed antigen isoform, via homologous recombination. Our analyses identify histone variants as a molecular link between global genome architecture, local chromatin conformation and antigenic variation. Long-read sequencing allows the assembly of antigen-gene arrays in Trypanosoma brucei and, coupled with deletion experiments, demonstrates that histone variants act as a molecular link between genome architecture, chromatin conformation and antigen variation."

We previously reported that most of the members of the Wnt family of signaling proteins are induced in fibrotic kidneys. Dysregulation of the signaling protein Wnt5a is associated with fibrosis, but little is known about the role of Wnt5a in regulating M2 macrophage activation that results in kidney fibrosis. Here, using murine Raw 264.7 cells and bone marrow–derived macrophages, we found that Wnt5a enhanced transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1)-induced macrophage M2 polarization as well as expression of the transcriptional regulators Yes-associated protein (Yap)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (Taz). Verteporfin blockade of Yap/Taz inhibited both Wnt5a- and TGFβ1-induced macrophage M2 polarization. In mouse models of kidney fibrosis, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Wnt5a expression diminished kidney fibrosis, macrophage Yap/Taz expression, and M2 polarization. Moreover, genetic ablation of Taz in macrophages attenuated kidney fibrosis and macrophage M2 polarization in mice. Collectively, these results indicate that Wnt5a promotes kidney fibrosis by stimulating Yap/Taz-mediated macrophage M2 polarization. M2 macrophage polarization is known to underlie kidney fibrosis.

https://openalex.org/W2896075276,"Ebola virus causes haemorrhagic fever with a high fatality rate in humans and non-human primates. It belongs to the family Filoviridae in the order Mononegavirales, which are viruses that contain linear, non-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded genomic RNA1,2. The enveloped, filamentous virion contains the nucleocapsid, consisting of the helical nucleoprotein-RNA complex, VP24, VP30, VP35 and viral polymerase1,3. The nucleoprotein-RNA complex acts as a scaffold for nucleocapsid formation and as a template for RNA replication and transcription by condensing RNA into the virion4,5. RNA binding and nucleoprotein oligomerization are synergistic and do not readily occur independently6. Although recent cryo-electron tomography studies have revealed the overall architecture of the nucleocapsid core4,5, there has been no high-resolution reconstruction of the nucleocapsid. Here we report the structure of a recombinant Ebola virus nucleoprotein-RNA complex expressed in mammalian cells without chemical fixation, at near-atomic resolution using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. Our structure reveals how the Ebola virus nucleocapsid core encapsidates its viral genome, its sequence-independent coordination with RNA by nucleoprotein, and the dynamic transition between the RNA-free and RNA-bound states. It provides direct structural evidence for the role of the N terminus of nucleoprotein in subunit oligomerization, and for the hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions that lead to the formation of the helical assembly. The structure is validated as representative of the native biological assembly of the nucleocapsid core by consistent dimensions and symmetry with the full virion5. The atomic model provides a detailed mechanistic basis for understanding nucleocapsid assembly and highlights key structural features that may serve as targets for anti-viral drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2896080053,"The cultural transmission of behaviour depends on the ability of the pupil to identify and emulate an appropriate tutor1-4. How the brain of the pupil detects a suitable tutor and encodes the behaviour of the tutor is largely unknown. Juvenile zebra finches readily copy the songs of the adult tutors that they interact with, but not the songs that they listen to passively through a speaker5,6, indicating that social cues generated by the tutor facilitate song imitation. Here we show that neurons in the midbrain periaqueductal grey of juvenile finches are selectively excited by a singing tutor and-by releasing dopamine in the cortical song nucleus HVC-help to encode the song representations of the tutor used for vocal copying. Blocking dopamine signalling in the HVC of the pupil during tutoring blocked copying, whereas pairing stimulation of periaqueductal grey terminals in the HVC with a song played through a speaker was sufficient to drive copying. Exposure to a singing tutor triggered the rapid emergence of responses to the tutor song in the HVC of the pupil and a rapid increase in the complexity of the song of the pupil, an early signature of song copying7,8. These findings reveal that a dopaminergic mesocortical circuit detects the presence of a tutor and helps to encode the performance of the tutor, facilitating the cultural transmission of vocal behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2896459253,"Increased storage of carbon in the oceans has been proposed as a mechanism to explain lower concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide during ice ages; however, unequivocal signatures of this storage have not been found1. In seawater, the dissolved gases oxygen and carbon dioxide are linked via the production and decay of organic material, with reconstructions of low oxygen concentrations in the past indicating an increase in biologically mediated carbon storage. Marine sediment proxy records have suggested that oxygen concentrations in the deep ocean were indeed lower during the last ice age, but that near-surface and intermediate waters of the Pacific Ocean—a large fraction of which are poorly oxygenated at present—were generally better oxygenated during the glacial1–3. This vertical opposition could suggest a minimal net basin-integrated change in carbon storage. Here we apply a dual-proxy approach, incorporating qualitative upper-water-column and quantitative bottom-water oxygen reconstructions4,5, to constrain changes in the vertical extent of low-oxygen waters in the eastern tropical Pacific since the last ice age. Our tandem proxy reconstructions provide evidence of a downward expansion of oxygen depletion in the eastern Pacific during the last glacial, with no indication of greater oxygenation in the upper reaches of the water column. We extrapolate our quantitative deep-water oxygen reconstructions to show that the respired carbon reservoir of the glacial Pacific was substantially increased, establishing it as an important component of the coupled mechanism that led to low levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide during the glacial. A downward expansion of oxygen depletion in the eastern Pacific Ocean during the last ice age suggests an increase in the respired carbon reservoir, contributing to the lower levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide during this period."
https://openalex.org/W2896040630,"Few animals provide a readout that is as objective of their perceptual state as camouflaging cephalopods. Their skin display system includes an extensive array of pigment cells (chromatophores), each expandable by radial muscles controlled by motor neurons. If one could track the individual expansion states of the chromatophores, one would obtain a quantitative description-and potentially even a neural description by proxy-of the perceptual state of the animal in real time. Here we present the use of computational and analytical methods to achieve this in behaving animals, quantifying the states of tens of thousands of chromatophores at sixty frames per second, at single-cell resolution, and over weeks. We infer a statistical hierarchy of motor control, reveal an underlying low-dimensional structure to pattern dynamics and uncover rules that govern the development of skin patterns. This approach provides an objective description of complex perceptual behaviour, and a powerful means to uncover the organizational principles that underlie the function, dynamics and morphogenesis of neural systems."
https://openalex.org/W2897689542,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is a key pathological feature of many different types of neurodegenerative disease. Sterile alpha and Toll/interleukin receptor motif-containing protein 1 (SARM1) has been attracting much attention as an important molecule for inducing axonal degeneration and neuronal cell death by causing loss of NAD (NADH). However, it has remained unclear what exactly regulates the SARM1 activity. Here, we report that NAD+ cleavage activity of SARM1 is regulated by its own phosphorylation at serine 548. The phosphorylation of SARM1 was mediated by c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) under oxidative stress conditions, resulting in inhibition of mitochondrial respiration concomitant with enhanced activity of NAD+ cleavage. Nonphosphorylatable mutation of Ser-548 or treatment with a JNK inhibitor decreased SARM1 activity. Furthermore, neuronal cells derived from a familial Parkinson's disease (PD) patient showed a congenitally increased level of SARM1 phosphorylation compared with that in neuronal cells from a healthy person and were highly sensitive to oxidative stress. These results indicate that JNK-mediated phosphorylation of SARM1 at Ser-548 is a regulator of SARM1 leading to inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. These findings suggest that an abnormal regulation of SARM1 phosphorylation is involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases.

Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) functions in heme catabolism and is both cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory. We hypothesized that this dual function may be related to asthma’s etiology. Using primary airway epithelial cells (pAECs) and an asthma mouse model, we demonstrate that severe lung inflammation is associated with rapid pAEC apoptosis. Surprisingly, NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inhibition, retinoid X receptor (RXR) deficiency, and HO-1 induction were associated with abrogated apoptosis. MCC950, a selective small-molecule inhibitor of canonical and noncanonical NLRP3 activation, reduced RXR expression, leading to decreased pAEC apoptosis that was reversed by the RXR agonist adapalene. Of note, HO-1 induction in a mouse model of ovalbumin-induced eosinophilic asthma suppressed Th2 responses and reduced apoptosis of pulmonary pAECs. In vitro, HO-1 induction desensitized cultured pAECs to ovalbumin-induced apoptosis, confirming the in vivo observations. Critically, the HO-1 products carbon monoxide and bilirubin suppressed the NLRP3–RXR axis in pAECs.

Allergen challenge results in airway epithelial inflammation and dysfunction. Under such a condition, airway epithelial cells undergo apoptosis. Two pathways basically categorize the sequence of events that culminate in the activation of aspartase-specific cysteine proteases, caspases: the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways (2Tesfaigzi Y. Roles of apoptosis in airway epithelia.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2006; 34 (16439804): 537-54710.1165/rcmb.2006-0014OCCrossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The extrinsic pathway can be initiated by one of several cell surface death receptors (tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 and Fas receptor) when bound by the appropriate ligand. The intrinsic pathway is characterized by the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and the release of several pro-apoptotic factors, including cytochrome c, into the cytosol. These factors are regulated by the Bcl-2 family including Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (3Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y.

However, it is unknown whether NLRP3 modulates airway epithelial cell apoptosis to control allergic lung inflammation. Nuclear receptors as superfamily members of transcriptional regulators play critical roles as signal transducers in immune functions. Within the nuclear receptors, the retinoid X receptor isotypes (RXRα/β/γ) play a key role as heterodimeric partners for some nuclear receptors and are critical for Th2-mediated immunity. Blockade of RXR by an antagonist inhibited Th2 differentiation, resulting in reduced production of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 (18Núñez V. Alameda D. Rico D. Mota R. Gonzalo P. Cedenilla M. Fischer T.

Activation of RXRα/β/γ has been shown to inhibit Th1 response and to promote Th2 differentiation (18Núñez V. Alameda D. Rico D. Mota R. Gonzalo P. Cedenilla M. Fischer T. Boscá L. Glass C.K.

Because RXR alone and in combination with other nuclear hormone receptors also promotes Th2 differentiation (18Núñez V. Alameda D. Rico D. Mota R. Gonzalo P. Cedenilla M. Fischer T. Boscá L.

Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a member of the protein family of heat shock proteins, exerts both airway epithelial-protective and anti-inflammatory function. Most physiological functions of HO-1 have been associated with its enzymatic activity in heme catabolism, displaying an indispensable role in multiple inflammatory diseases by its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (24Gozzelino R. Jeney V. Soares M.P. Mechanisms of cell protection by heme oxygenase-1.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

HO-1 can be induced by a variety of stimulus such as heat shock, cytokines, nitric oxide, endotoxin and hyperoxia, all of which are produced in asthma. It was reported that mice lacking HO-1 develop severe inflammatory disease (25Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Hemeoxygenase 1 is required for mammalian iron reutilization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, whether HO-1 suppresses airway epithelial apoptosis and inflammatory response through NLRP3 or RXRα/β/γ is unclear. Here, we demonstrated that activation of NLRP3–RXRα/β/γ axis promotes airway epithelial apoptosis and aggravates type 2 immune responses, whereas HO-1 efficiently inhibits this pathway and subsequent events in OVA-induced murine model of asthma. To determine the functional role of NLRP3 in allergic airway inflammation, we established an OVA-induced mice model of eosinophilic asthma and administrated with or without MCC950, a small-molecule inhibitor of NLRP3. We showed that OVA stimulation led to a significant increase in basophils but not DCs infiltration into the lung, which was blunted by MCC950 (Fig. 1A). In addition, MCC950 pretreatment severely reduced pulmonary thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and C–C chemokine ligand-2 (CCL2) compared with OVA-induced mice (Fig. 1B). As expected, inhibition of NLRP3 significantly suppressed the release of IL-1β, which is produced after catalysis of pro-IL-1β by NLRP3 (Fig. 1B). Importantly, NLRP3 inhibition resulted in robust decrease in type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13), serum OVA-specific IgE (OVA-sIgE) (Fig. 1C), mucus secretion, and inflammatory cell infiltration (Fig. 1D). These data demonstrate that NLRP3 is required for OVA-induced allergic responses. It is generally accepted that NLRP3 activation induced by ROS generation in pathogenic or injury conditions mediates allergic Th2 responses. Excessive oxidant products and Th2 cytokines produce a milieu that damages the airway epithelial cells and promotes apoptosis. Apoptosis is a key component of normal cellular homeostasis, whereas dysregulation of this process aggravates airway inflammation (32Nakamura M. Matute-Bello G. Liles W.C. Hayashi S. Kajikawa O. Lin S.M. Frevert C.W. Martin T.R. Differential response of human lung epithelial cells to Fas-induced apoptosis.Am. J.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of NLRP3 on airway epithelial apoptosis by TUNEL assay and revealed an increase in airway epithelial cells in OVA-induced asthmatic mice. This was dramatically decreased by MCC950, consistent with the ratio of TUNEL-positive airway epithelial cells and paralleled to Th2 responses (Fig. 1E). Thus, TUNEL positivity reflected the extent of inflammation and was associated with resolution of airway inflammation. To further verify that NLRP3 expression is related to the apoptosis of airway epithelial cells, we determined the level of Bcl-XL, an anti-apoptotic protein, in primary airway epithelial cells (pAECs) pretreated with or without MCC950. The results showed that OVA-induced NLRP3 significantly suppressed Bcl-XL expression, which was reversed by MCC950, indicating a decrease in apoptosis of pAECs (Fig. 2A). Because RXRα/β/γ is a promising regulator of apoptotic pathways in various cell types, we next investigated whether RXRα/β/γ regulates pAECs apoptosis. Adapalene, a robust RXRα/β/γ agonist, was used subsequently. Compared with the OVA-stimulated group, adapalene addition led to a further decrease in Bcl-XL (Fig. 2B). We next explored whether RXRα/β/γ is involved in NLRP3-induced apoptosis in airway epithelial cells and found that the expression of RXRα/β/γ was significantly reduced in pAECs treated with MCC950 (Fig. 2C). Similarly, the early and advanced apoptosis of pAECs after MCC950 treatment was decreased compared with the OVA-stimulated group (Fig. 2D). However, decreased apoptosis after NLRP3 inhibition by MCC950 was reversed after activation of RXR by adapalene (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that NLRP3 expression activates RXRα/β/γ and that NLRP3–RXRα/β/γ axis participates in the induction of bronchial epithelial cell apoptosis. We then evaluated changes in epithelial cell-derived pro-allergic cytokine production and observed significant decreases in IL-25, IL-33, TSLP, and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by MCC950 treatment but robust increases by adapalene (Fig. 2E). These data indicate that NLRP3–RXRα/β/γ axis directs production of inflammatory cytokines from airway epithelial cells. Our previous studies showed that HO-1 exhibits protective roles in airway inflammation (34Xia Z.W. Xu L.Q. Zhong W.W. Wei J.J. Li N.L. Shao J. Li Y.Z. Yu S.C. Zhang Z.L. Heme oxygenase-1 attenuates ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation by up-regulation of foxp3 T-regulatory cells, interleukin-10, and membrane-bound transforming growth factor-1.Am J Pathol. 2007; 171 (17991714): 1904-191410.2353/ajpath.2007.070096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, we evaluated the levels of cytokines and inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs of asthmatic murine model. We detected IL-1β and found that HO-1 induction in vivo with hemin effectively reduced the level of IL-1β in the lung (Fig. 3A) along with a decrease in TSLP and CCL2 (Fig. 3B). Eosinophil recruitment in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in the lung was markedly inhibited in the OVA + hemin group compared with that in OVA-challenged group (Fig. 3C). In addition, Th2 cytokines including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in lungs and OVA–sIgE in serum were dramatically reduced in OVA + hemin group mice (Fig. 3D). Lastly, the recruitment of peribronchial eosinophils and lymphocytes, together with mucus hypersecretion, was dramatically alleviated in lungs in OVA + hemin group mice compared with those in OVA-challenged mice (Fig. 3E). Collectively, these results demonstrate that HO-1 can suppress airway inflammation in this murine model. To gain insights into the biological relevance of HO-1–mediated anti-apoptosis in airway epithelial cells in vivo, we pretreated WT mice with hemin to induce HO-1 expression before OVA sensitization and subsequently challenged with OVA. We observed that hemin-induced HO-1 decreased the expression of RXRα/β/γ but increased expression of Bcl-XL in the lungs of WT mice. Expression of NLRP3 was not different between WT and hemin-treated mice (Fig. 4A). However, induction of HO-1 impaired expression of NLRP3 and RXRα/β/γ while significantly increasing the expression of Bcl-XL in lungs of OVA- and hemin-treated mice compared with that in OVA-induced mice (Fig. 4B), suggesting that HO-1 can inhibit cell apoptosis. TUNEL assay of lung histology showed that hemin treatment led to an obvious decrease in apoptotic airway epithelial cells (Fig. 4C). Manual counting showed that the number of total airway epithelial cells was not significantly different among four groups. However, the number of TUNEL-positive epithelial airway cells in OVA- and hemin-treated mice was dramatically decreased compared with that in OVA-challenged mice (Fig. 4D). The ratio of TUNEL-positive airway epithelial cells to total cells was also consistently decreased in OVA- and hemin-treated mice compared with that in OVA-challenged mice (Fig. 4E). To gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of HO-1, we used pAECs to examine whether hemin can induce expression of HO-1. The results showed that the expression of HO-1 was highly up-regulated in pAECs at 2 h after hemin treatment and increased in a hemin concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). It has been reported that HO-1 exerts its anti-apoptotic function through its products, CO and bilirubin; thus, we used CO-releasing molecule (CO-RM2) and bilirubin to treat pAECs, respectively. The results demonstrated that pAECs treated with hemin, CO-RM2, or bilirubin decreased expression of NLRP3 and RXR but increased expression of Bcl-XL (Fig. 5B). We next determined whether HO-1 induction affects apoptosis of pAECs after stimulation with OVA or OVA + hemin, respectively. The results revealed that both early and late apoptosis of pAECs was rescued by hemin using flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 5C). In addition, we found that both CO-RM2 and bilirubin also reduced expression of NLRP3 and RXRα/β/γ and enhanced expression of Bcl-XL in OVA-stimulated pAECs (Fig. 5D). To further investigate the effect of HO-1 itself, Sn-protoporphyrin (SnPP), the HO-1 inhibitor, was used to suppress the enzymatic activity. The results showed that although changes in NLRP3, RXRα/β/γ and Bcl-XL expression was monitored; there was also decreased expression of NLRP3 and RXRα/β/γ but increased expression of Bcl-XL in the hemin + SnPP-treated group compared with the OVA and OVA + SnPP groups, having an effect similar to the hemin-, CO-RM2–, or bilirubin-treated groups (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that HO-1 itself can exert inhibitory effect on apoptosis of bronchial epithelial cells via the NLRP3–RXRα/β/γ axis. In addition to an suppressive role in apoptosis, we observed that HO-1 decreased the IL-1β level in the supernatant of pAECs following OVA stimulation (Fig. 5E) and suppressed the expression of cytokines IL-25, IL-33, TSLP, and GM-CSF in airway epithelial cells (Fig. 5F). Thus, these results establish that HO-1 can suppress bronchial epithelial cell apoptosis and inflammation by dampening the NLRP3–RXRα/β/γ axis. To characterize the interaction between HO-1 protein and NLRP3 or RXRα/β/γ, we chose a human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) to obtain enough protein content to perform co-IP. Having treated BEAS-2B cells with hemin and OVA, we collected cell lysates and analyzed by Western blotting and co-IP, respectively. First, we found that hemin treatment decreased expression of NLRP3 and RXRα/β/γ and"

LKB1 primarily phosphorylates AMPK after energy stress, whereas calcium-mediated activation of AMPK requires CaMKK2, although the regulatory mechanisms of calcium-mediated AMPK activation remain unclear. Using biochemical, microscopic, and genetic approaches, we demonstrate that the stromal interaction molecule (STIM)2, a calcium sensor, acts as a novel regulator of CaMKK2-AMPK signaling. We reveal that STIM2 interacts with AMPK and CaMKK2 and that the increase in intracellular calcium levels promotes AMPK colocalization and interaction with STIM2. We further show that STIM2 deficiency attenuates calcium-induced but not energy stress-induced AMPK activation, possibly by regulating the CaMKK2-AMPK interaction. Together, our results identify a previously unappreciated mechanism that modulates calcium-mediated AMPK activation.-Chauhan, A. S., Liu, X., Jing, J., Lee, H., Yadav, R.

In addition, the effect of supplementation of the culture medium with resveratrol on the mitochondrial functions and post-warming embryonic development was examined. Two days after in vitro fertilization, embryos with 8-12 cells (referred to hereafter as 8-cell embryos) were vitrified and warmed, followed by in vitro incubation for 5 days in a culture medium containing either the vehicle or 0.5 μM resveratrol. Vitrification reduced embryonic development until the blastocyst stage, reduced the ATP content of embryos, and impaired the mitochondrial genome integrity, as determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Although the total cell number and mitochondrial DNA copy number (Mt-number) of blastocysts were low in the vitrified embryos, the Mt-number per blastomere was similar among the blastocysts derived from fresh (non-vitrified) and vitrified-warmed embryos. Supplementation of the culture medium with resveratrol enhanced the post-warming embryonic development and reduced the Mt-number and reactive oxygen species level in blastocysts and blastomeres without affecting the ATP content. An increase in the content of cell-free mitochondrial DNA in the spent culture medium was observed following cultivation of embryos with resveratrol. These results suggested that vitrification induces mitochondrial damages and that resveratrol may enhance the development of post-warming embryos and activates the degeneration of damaged mitochondria, as indicated by the increase in the cell-free mitochondrial DNA content in the spent culture medium and the decrease in the Mt-number of blastocysts and blastomeres."

We used gene-specific methods to measure mRNA from all known bitter receptor genes in adult human skin from freshly biopsied samples and from samples collected at autopsy from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. Human skin expressed some but not all TAS2Rs, and for those that were expressed, the relative amounts differed markedly among individuals. For some TAS2Rs, mRNA abundance was related to presumed sun exposure based on the location from which the skin sample was collected (TAS2R14, TAS2R30, TAS2R42, and TAS2R60), sex (TAS2R3, TAS2R4, TAS2R8, TAS2R9, TAS2R14, and TAS2R60), and age (TAS2R5), although these effects were not large.

We also isolated a truncated GRD subunit with a premature stop codon. We found that when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, three of the four RDL subunits (VdesRDL1, VdesRDL2, and VdesRDL3) formed functional, homomultimeric anionic receptors, whereas GRD and LCCH3 produced heteromultimeric cationic receptors. These receptors displayed specific sensitivities toward GABA and fipronil, and VdesRDL1 was the most resistant to the insecticide. We identified specific residues in the VdesRDL1 pore-lining region that explain its high resistance to fipronil. VdesRDL4 did not form a functional receptor when expressed alone, but it assembled with VdesRDL1 to form a heteromultimeric receptor with properties distinct from those of the VdesRDL1 homomultimeric receptor. Moreover, VdesRDL1 physically interacted with VdesRDL3, generating a heteromultimeric receptor combining properties of both subunits. On the other hand, we did not detect any functional interaction between VdesLCCH3 and the VdesRDL subunits, an observation that differed from what was previously reported for Drosophila melanogaster.

Varroa destructor is the most devastating pest for the Western honey bee Apis mellifera (1Le Conte Y. Ellis M. Ritter W.

The lifespan of infested honey bee colonies is significantly shorter unless they are treated with acaricides. Moreover, several honey bee viruses, including deformed wing virus or acute bee paralysis virus, are transmitted by Varroa mites (2Francis R.M. Nielsen S.L. Kryger P.

The combined effects of the parasite and the viral diseases play an important role in honey bee colony health, contributing to morphological deformities (small body, deformed wings) and immune system weakening. These infestations probably contribute to colony collapse disorder, a syndrome leading to the large-scale loss of managed bees and recorded in Europe and North America since 2006 (3Fairbrother A.

Colony collapse disorder is especially alarming because A. mellifera is commonly used for active crop pollination, and its role has been evaluated at over $200 billion worldwide.

However, these treatments may have adverse effects on bee health (4Hawthorne D.J. Dively G.P. Killing them with kindness?: in-hive medications may inhibit xenobiotic efflux transporters and endanger honey bees.PLoS One. 2011; 6 (22073195)e2679610.1371/journal.pone.0026796Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To minimize pesticide residues in bee colonies, beekeepers also use essential oil (thymol) and organic acids (formic acid, oxalic acid). Thymol, a constituent of thyme essential oil, is a positive allosteric modulator of GABA-gated receptors in humans and also in fruit flies (5Priestley C.M. Williamson E.M. Wafford K.A. Sattelle D.B. Thymol, a constituent of thyme essential oil, is a positive allosteric modulator of human GABA A receptors and a homo-oligomeric GABA receptor from Drosophila melanogaster.Br. J.

Moreover, insect GABA receptors are one of the major targets of insecticides including phenylpyrazoles (fipronil), cyclodienes (dieldrin), and metadiamides (broflanilide) (6Casida J.E. Durkin K.A.

GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems. In insects, GABA is important for locomotion control, olfactory learning, and regulation of sleep and aggression (7Choudhary A.F. Laycock I.

GABA receptors are members of the cysteine-loop ligand-gated ion channel superfamily that also includes nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which permeate cations, and glutamate-gated channels, which permeate anions (11Jones A.K.

The receptors of this family are composed of five homologous subunits arranged around a central ion channel. Each subunit possesses an extracellular N-terminal domain that encompasses the ligand-binding domain (LBD), 2The abbreviation used is: LBDligand-binding domain. and four transmembrane segments (TM1–4), with a variable intracellular loop between TM3 and TM4. The TM2 segment lines the channel pore (13Nys M. Kesters D. Ulens C. Structural insights into Cys-loop receptor function and ligand recognition.Biochem.

In insects, three genes encoding GABA receptors have been identified: RDL (resistance to dieldrin), LCCH3 (ligand-gated chloride channel homolog 3), and GRD (GABA and glycine receptor-like subunit from Drosophila). Mutations in the TM2 of the RDL subunits have been detected in insecticide-resistant strains of many arthropod species (14Feyereisen R. Dermauw W. Van Leeuwen T.

Only D. melanogaster subunits have been expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes where they assemble into heteropentameric, cation-selective channels (19Gisselmann G. Plonka J. Pusch H. Hatt H. Drosophila melanogaster GRD and LCCH3 subunits form heteromultimeric GABA-gated cation channels.Br. J.

Although a fragment encoding the TM2 of a RDL subunit was previously isolated in V. destructor (20Price K.L. Lummis S.C. An atypical residue in the pore of Varroa destructor GABA-activated RDL receptors affects picrotoxin block and thymol modulation.Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2014; 55 (25460510): 19-2510.1016/j.ibmb.2014.10.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), nothing is known about GABA-gated ion channels in this parasite, which is a major target of acaricides. ligand-binding domain. Here, we describe the molecular cloning of four RDL, one LCCH3, and two GRD subunits from V. destructor. We found that when expressed in X. laevis oocytes, the resulting GABA-gated channels displayed specific pharmacological and biophysical features. Moreover, RDL subunits could assemble in heteromultimeric receptors. The properties of the three homomultimeric RDL receptors expressed in X. laevis oocytes VdesRDL1, VdesRDL2, and VdesRDL3 were clearly distinct from those previously reported for the honey bee RDL ortholog (21Taylor-Wells J. Hawkins J. Colombo C. Bermudez I. Jones A.K. Cloning and functional expression of intracellular loop variants of the honey bee (Apis mellifera) RDL GABA receptor.Neurotoxicology. 2017; 60 (27288983): 207-21310.1016/j.neuro.2016.06.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This suggests structural specificities that could be exploited in a pharmacological screen to identify insecticidal agents that will be more efficient on Varroa receptors than on their ortholog in honey bee and therefore could potentially be used to control Varroa mites without harming honey bees. We obtained the cDNAs of the V. destructor RDL (VdesRDL), GRD (VdesGRD), and LCCH3 (VdesLCCH3) subunits by rapid amplification of cDNA ends and PCR using gene specific oligonucleotides. For VdesRDL2, however, we could initially isolate only an incomplete ORF (GenBankTM accession number KY748051). We then took advantage of the large number of new sequences obtained from the transcriptomic analysis in Varroa jacobsoni (assembly vjacob_1.0 GCF_002532875) and V. destructor (Assembly Vdes3.0 GCF_002443255) deposited in the GenBankTM during this work to obtain a full-length ORF also for VdesRDL2. The cDNAs for the RDL subunits included ORFs of 1758, 1986, 1776, and 2193 bp encoding proteins of 585, 661, 591, and 730 amino acids for VdesRDL1 (KY748050), VdesRDL2 (MH423074), VdesRDL3 (KY748052), and VdesRDL4 (KY748053), respectively (Fig. 1). The predicted molecular masses were approximately 65 kDa for VdesRDL1 and VdesRDL3 and 72 and 80 kDa for VdesRDL2 and VdesRDL4, respectively. VdesRDL1 predicted sequences found in GenBankTM (XP_02265189 to XP_022651192) were 10 residues longer than the deduced amino acid sequence of our clone, but we found this small insertion in the TM3–TM4 loop in another clone not studied here. The predicted sequences for VdesRDL2 found in GenBankTM differed at the N terminus and the TM3–TM4 loop (XP_022658105 to XP_022658113). The deduced amino acid sequence of VdesRDL2 was similar to the sequence XP_022658108 at the TM3–TM4 loop and to the sequence XP_022658109 at the N terminus. The deduced amino acid sequence of VdesRDL3 was similar to the sequences XP_022644956 to XP_02264958. In the three other predicted sequences found in GenBankTM for VdesRDL3, the TM4 (XP_022644960 and XP_02264961), and a conserved segment into the LBD and the TM1 (XP_02264959) were missing. Like for VdesRDL2, the amino acid sequences predicted for VdesRDL4 differed mainly at the TM3–TM4 loop and at the N terminus (XP_022665348 to XP_022665350 and XP_022665352 to XP_022665356). Although most of the deduced amino acid sequence of VdesRDL4 was similar to XP_022665348, the N terminus was absent in any of the predicted sequences available in GenBankTM. The four VdesRDL subunits shared ∼50% identity. As expected, the LBD and the TM segments were well conserved between the VdesRDL subunits and the D. melanogaster RDL (DmelRDL) subunit (Fig. 1). Notably, all the residues involved in GABA binding in the pentameric receptor (Tyr109 and Arg111 in loop D, Ser176 at the end of loop E, Glu204 and Phe206 in loop B, and Thr251 and Tyr254 in loop C, according to DmelRDL sequence numbering) (22Ashby J.A.

However, VdesRDL1 sequence differed from the other sequences at residues critical for GABA receptor inhibition by the insecticides dieldrin and fipronil (14Feyereisen R. Dermauw W. Van Leeuwen T. Genotype to phenotype, the molecular and physiological dimensions of resistance in arthropods.Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 2015; 121 (26047113): 61-7710.1016/j.pestbp.2015.01.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar): a serine instead of alanine at 2′, a methionine instead of threonine at 6′ in TM2 (when the charged residue at the cytoplasmic end is numbered 0′), and an alanine instead of a threonine at the cytoplasmic end of the TM3 (Fig. 1). Two of these differences (Met at 6′ and Ala306) were also found in VdesRDL4. Therefore, specific pharmacology could be developed for multimeric receptors that include one of these subunits. The cDNAs for the VdesGRD (KY748054) and VdesLCCH3 (KY748055) subunits included ORFs of 1662 and 1980 bp encoding proteins of 553 and 659 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 1). The predicted molecular masses were 63 kDa for VdesGRD and 75 kDa for VdesLCCH3. We also cloned a truncated GRD variant that we named VdesΔGRD, but we did not investigate its features. It is noteworthy that three predicted sequences found in GenBankTM (XP_022664708 to XP_022664710) are similarly truncated. The deduced amino acid sequence of VdesGRD differed from that of the two predicted proteins found in GenBankTM (XP_022653054 and XP_022653055) that lack a fragment of the LBD. VdesLCCH3 deduced amino acid sequence was similar to that of XP_022672719. Two other predicted proteins differed from VdesLCCH3 at the TM3–TM4 loop and by an insertion of 17 residues between Loop E and Loop B (XP_022672700 and XP_022672710). VdesGRD and VdesLCCH3 sequences shared 33 and 50% identity with the D. melanogaster subunits, respectively. The residues identified in the RDL sequences as involved in GABA binding were not well conserved in VdesGRD or VdesLCCH3. However, because of the absence of structural data and mutagenic studies, GABA-interacting residues have been not precisely identify in these subunits (22Ashby J.A. McGonigle I.V. Price K.L. Cohen N. Comitani F. Dougherty D.A. Molteni C. Lummis S.C. GABA binding to an insect GABA receptor: a molecular dynamics and mutagenesis study.Biophys.

To evaluate the properties of the cloned V. destructor GABA-gated channels, we performed two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings in X. laevis oocytes after injection of the cRNAs encoding each individual VdesRDL subunit or of a mixture of cRNAs encoding the VdesGRD and VdesLCCH3 subunits because these subunits do not form functional receptors when expressed separately. When maintained at −60 mV, perfusion of GABA induced an inward current only in oocytes that expressed VdesRDL1, VdesRDL2, VdesRDL3, or VdesGRD/LCCH3, but not in oocytes that expressed VdesRDL4 (Fig. 2). This indicates that VdesRDL1, 2, and 3 subunits can form functional homomultimeric receptors. We then obtained concentration-response curves by challenging oocytes with GABA concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 250 μm. Each VdesRDL subunit displayed a different GABA EC50 with the smallest value for VdesRDL2 and the highest for VdesRDL1 (Table 1). In similar experiments, the GABA EC50 value of the A. mellifera RDL subunit (25.2 ± 3.9 μm, n = 5) was similar to value previously reported (21Taylor-Wells J. Hawkins J. Colombo C. Bermudez I. Jones A.K. Cloning and functional expression of intracellular loop variants of the honey bee (Apis mellifera) RDL GABA receptor.Neurotoxicology. 2017; 60 (27288983): 207-21310.1016/j.neuro.2016.06.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The GABA EC50 value obtained with VdesGRD/LCCH3 was close to the one obtained with VdesRDL3 (Table 1). It is well established that homomultimeric RDL receptors permeate chloride ions (17Zheng Y.

In our recording conditions, the reversal potential (Erev) obtained with the VdesRDL subunits (−12.9 ± 1.3 mV, n = 11, −12.5 ± 2.1 mV, n = 7, and −14.5 ± 1.1 mV, n = 9, for VdesRDL1, VdesRDL2, and VdesRDL3, respectively) was similar to that obtained with the heteromultimeric VdesGRD/LCCH3 receptor (−10.3 ± 0.9 mV, n = 15). Erev increased by ∼50 mV for the VdesRDL subunits (+50 ± 2 mV, n = 5, +42 ± 1 mV, n = 4, and +51 ± 4 mV, n = 7, for VdesRDL1, VdesRDL2, and VdesRDL3, respectively) when we decreased the extracellular chloride concentration from 100 to 0 mm, in accordance with some Cl− permeability. Conversely, upon the same change, Erev was not affected for VdesGRD/LCCH3 (−1 ± 1 mV, n = 5; Fig. 3). Reciprocally when we decreased the extracellular sodium concentration from 100 to 0 mm, Erev measured for VdesRDL subunits was not strongly affected (−1 ± 2 mV, n = 4, +8 ± 1 mV, n = 4, and +3 ± 2 mV, n = 4, for VdesRDL1, VdesRDL2, and VdesRDL3, respectively), whereas that of VdesGRD/LCCH3 was reduced by −20 mV (−20 ± 2 mV, n = 6; Fig. 3). These results indicate that in our recording conditions, VdesGDR/LCCH3 permeates sodium ions (without being highly selective for this species) as previously shown for the D. melanogaster subunits (19Gisselmann G. Plonka J. Pusch H. Hatt H. Drosophila melanogaster GRD and LCCH3 subunits form heteromultimeric GABA-gated cation channels.Br. J.

Fipronil potently inhibited the GABA-evoked currents recorded in oocytes that expressed VdesRDL2, VdesRDL3, or VdesGDR/LCCH3 but not VdesRDL1 (Fig. 4). The VdesRDL1 IC50 value was ∼50 times higher than that of the other RDL subunits (Table 1). In our recording conditions, fipronil IC50 for A. mellifera RDL (0.066 ± 0.014 μm, n = 4) was similar to the value previously reported (21Taylor-Wells J. Hawkins J. Colombo C. Bermudez I. Jones A.K. Cloning and functional expression of intracellular loop variants of the honey bee (Apis mellifera) RDL GABA receptor.Neurotoxicology. 2017; 60 (27288983): 207-21310.1016/j.neuro.2016.06.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To assess whether the specific differences in the TM2 sequence were responsible for VdesRDL1 resistance to fipronil, we determined the fipronil IC50 for VdesRDL1 that harbored the mutations S2′A and M6′T (VdesRDL1mut). The significantly smaller IC50 for VdesRDL1mut compared with VdesRDL1 (Table 1) demonstrated the importance of the 2′ and 6′ residues for RDL sensitivity toward fipronil. Our sequence analysis also indicated the presence of a glycine and an alanine at 2′ in VdesGRD and VdesLCCH3, respectively. Although the mutation A2′G in RDL subunit has been frequently identified in strains resistant to fipronil (14Feyereisen R. Dermauw W. Van Leeuwen T. Genotype to phenotype, the molecular and physiological dimensions of resistance in arthropods.Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 2015; 121 (26047113): 61-7710.1016/j.pestbp.2015.01.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), our results indicate that its presence in VdesGRD does not abolish VdesGRD/LCCH3 sensitivity to fipronil. Western blotting analysis of lysates from X. laevis oocytes showed that oocytes injected with cRNA encoding VdesRDL4 tagged with GFP expressed a protein at the expected molecular mass (Fig. 5A). Because VdesRDL4 could not form functional homopentameric receptors, we tried to co-express this subunit with VdesRDL3 or VdesRDL1 (Fig. 5 and Table 1). We did not observe any significant differences between the GABA EC50 and fipronil IC50 values obtained with VdesRDL3/RDL4 or with VdesRDL3 alone (Table 1). However, these results do not exclude that these two subunits might form heteromultimeric receptors in X. laevis oocytes. Indeed, the sensitivity toward GABA or fipronil of the heteromultimeric receptor might be similar to that of VdesRDL3 alone. This possibility was suggested by the finding that co-expression of VdesRDL4 and VdesRDL1 increased the sensitivity to fipronil compared with VdesRDL1 expressed alone (Fig. 5C and Table 1). Conversely, the GABA EC50 value obtained with VdesRDL1/RDL4 was not significantly different from that of VdesRDL1 alone. To determine whether the higher sensitivity toward fipronil of the heteromultimer VdesRDL1/RDL4 was due to the presence of VdesRDL4, we introduced the mutation A2′S in this subunit (VdesRDL4mut). The fipronil IC50 value of VdesRDL1/RDL4mut was not different from that of VdesRDL1 alone (Fig. 5C and Table 1). As expected, the fipronil IC50 value obtained when the VdesRDL1mut was co-expressed with VdesRDL4 was comparable with that of VdesRDL1mut alone (Fig. 5C and Table 1). This demonstrates that VdesRDL1 can assemble in functional receptors with VdesRDL4 and that these heteromultimeric receptors display different features compared with the VdesRDL1 homopentameric receptors. To test whether VdesRDL1 and VdesRDL3 could assemble in heteromultimeric receptors, we co-injected equimolar concentration of RNAs encoding VdesRDL1 and VdesRDL3 in X. laevis oocytes. Indeed the expression of both receptors was similar with current amplitude values ranging from −635 to −8235 nA (mean −5087 ± 679 nA, n = 13) for VdesRDL1 and from −1026 to −5802 nA (mean −2882 ± 335 nA, n = 21) for VdesRDL3, 1–3 days after injection. The GABA EC50 value obtained from oocytes that expressed VdesRDL1/RDL3 (89.2–121.2 μm) was not significantly different from the value obtained for VdesRDL1 alone (Fig. 6A and Table 1). Conversely, the fipronil IC50 value for VdesRDL1/RLD3 (1.4–14.2 μm) was close to the value obtained for VdesRDL3 alone (Fig. 6B and Table 1). These results are compatible with the expression of a homogenous population of heteromultimeric receptors rather than two populations of homomultimers. They also suggests that in X. laevis oocytes, VdesRDL1 and VdesRDL3 preferentially assemble to form heteromultimers, with properties different from those of the single receptors. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using VdesRDL1 and VdesRDL3 tagged with GFP and mCherry, respectively, confirmed the direct interaction between VdesRDL1 and VdesRDL3 (Fig. 6C). This strongly supports that when the two RDL subunits are expressed together, they preferentially form heteromultimeric receptors. Despite the fact that VdesRDL and VdesGRD/LCCH3 permeate different ions (anions/Cl− ions and cations/Na+ ions, respectively), a functional interaction between RDL and LCCH3 has been suggeste"

However, the molecular mechanism of acetate uptake by SatP still remains elusive. Here, we report the crystal structure of SatP from E. coli at 2.8 Å resolution, determined with a molecular replacement approach using a previously developed predicted model algorithm, which revealed a hexameric UreI-like channel structure. Structural analysis identified six transmembrane (TM) helices surrounding the central channel pore in each protomer and three conserved hydrophobic residues, FLY, located in the middle of the TM region for pore constriction. According to single-channel conductance recordings, performed with purified SatP reconstituted into lipid bilayer, three conserved polar residues in the TM1 facing to the periplasmic side are closely associated with acetate translocation activity.

https://openalex.org/W2898024031,"Background and aim Lung ultrasound has been used to describe common respiratory diseases both by visual and computer-assisted gray scale analysis. In the present paper, we compare both methods in assessing neonatal respiratory status keeping two oxygenation indexes as standards. Patients and methods Neonates admitted to the NICU for respiratory distress were enrolled. Two neonatologists not attending the patients performed a lung scan, built a single frame database and rated the images with a standardized score. The same dataset was processed using the gray scale analysis implemented with textural features and machine learning analysis. Both the oxygenation ratio (PaO2/FiO2) and the alveolar arterial oxygen gradient (A-a) were kept as reference standards. Results Seventy-five neonates with different respiratory status were enrolled in the study and a dataset of 600 ultrasound frames was built. Visual assessment of respiratory status correlated significantly with PaO2/FiO2 (r = -0.55; p<0.0001) and the A-a (r = 0.59; p<0.0001) with a strong interobserver agreement (K = 0.91). A significant correlation was also found between both oxygenation indexes and the gray scale analysis of lung ultrasound scans using regions of interest corresponding to 50K (r = -0.42; p<0.002 for PaO2/FiO2; r = 0.46 p<0.001 for A-a) and 100K (r = -0.35 p<0.01 for PaO2/FiO2; r = 0.58 p<0.0001 for A-a) pixels regions of interest. Conclusions A semi quantitative estimate of the degree of neonatal respiratory distress was demonstrated both by a validated scoring system and by computer assisted analysis of the ultrasound scan. This data may help to implement point of care ultrasound diagnostics in the NICU."

Fifty quadrats of 10 m x 50 m were laid at 500 m interval through systematic sampling method along the river line. Vegetation height (≥2.5 m) and DBH (≥2.5 cm) of only tree species were measured and altitude, ecological disturbances such as, grazing intensity and human impacts were included as main environmental variables at each of the sampled plots. The data was analyzed using different R statistical packages. Ninety-nine woody vascular plant species belonged to 81 genera and 45 familieswere recorded in Walga riparian vegetation. Only 10% of specieswere endemic to the Flora area. Asteraceae and Fabaceae had the highest number of species. Majority of the species (52.5%) were shrubs. Four major plant community types were identified: Euclea divinorum-Maytenus arbutifolia (1), Pterolobium stellatum- Calpurnia aurea (2), Brucea antidysenterica-Prunus africana (3), Erica arborea-Hagenia abyssinica (4). Species richness, true diversity and importance values were highestin community type 2(the lowest altitude ranges between 1976–2212 m a.s.l.) while evenness was highestin community type 3(mid altitude ranges between 2359–2676 m a.s.l.). Both community typeswere comprised of 56% of all recorded species and all endemic taxa except two. The highest percentage of species in lower frequency classes indicates a higher degree of floristic heterogeneity. There was a strong negative correlation (r = -0.65, p<0.001) between species richness and altitude with 42% of the variation in species richness per plot being explained by altitude. Our findings suggest that human disturbances and excessive livestock grazing are the main threats in community types1 and 2. We conclude that identifying major plant community types and underlying environmental conditions may help to manage and conserve forest resources in the area."
https://openalex.org/W2898073401,"We sought to identify proteins secreted by the human placenta into the maternal and fetal circulations. Blood samples from the maternal radial artery and uterine vein and umbilical artery and vein were obtained during cesarean section in 35 healthy women with term pregnancy. Slow off-rate modified aptamer (SOMA) protein–binding technology was used to quantify 1310 known proteins. The uteroplacental and umbilical venoarterial concentration differences were calculated. Thirty-four proteins were significantly secreted by the placenta into the maternal circulation, including placental growth factor, growth/differentiation factor 15, and matrix metalloproteinase 12. There were 341 proteins significantly secreted by the placenta into the fetal circulation. Only 7 proteins were secreted into both the fetal and maternal circulations, suggesting a distinct directionality in placental protein release. We examined changes across gestation in the proteins found to be significantly secreted by the placenta into the maternal circulation using serial blood samples from healthy women. Among the 34 proteins secreted into the maternal circulation, 8 changed significantly across gestation. The identified profiles of secreted placental proteins will allow us to identify novel minimally invasive biomarkers for human placental function across gestation and discover previously unknown proteins secreted by the human placenta that regulate maternal physiology and fetal development.—Michelsen, T.

To quantify this phenomenon and provide criteria for prioritizing genes for functional characterization, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline that identifies robustly defined protein families with no annotated domains, ranks these with respect to phylogenetic breadth, and identifies them in metagenomics data. We applied this approach to 271 965 protein families from the SFams database and discovered many with no functional annotation, including >118 000 families lacking any known protein domain. From these, we prioritized 6 668 conserved protein families with at least three sequences from organisms in at least two distinct classes. These Function Unknown Families (FUnkFams) are present in Tara Oceans Expedition and Human Microbiome Project metagenomes, with distributions associated with sampling environment. Our findings highlight the extent of functional novelty in sequence databases and establish an approach for creating a “most wanted” list of genes to prioritize for further characterization."
https://openalex.org/W2896937893,"It is unclear whether unintended pregnancies are associated with adverse outcomes. Data are predominantly from high-income countries and have methodological limitations, calling the findings into question. This research was designed to overcome these limitations and assess the relationships between pregnancy intention and miscarriage, stillbirth, low birthweight, neonatal death and postnatal depression in a low-income country.The pregnancy intention of 4,244 pregnant women in Mchinji District, Malawi, was measured using the validated Chichewa version of the London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy (LMUP). Women were re-interviewed postnatally to assess pregnancy outcome. Postnatal depression was assessed using the WHO's Self-Reporting Questionnaire. Multivariable regressions were conducted, with the choice of confounders informed by a pre-existing conceptual epidemiological hierarchy.Planned pregnancies are associated with a reduced risk of any (adjusted RR 0.90 [95%CI 0.86, 0.95]) or high symptoms of depression (adjusted RR 0.76 [95%CI 0.63, 0.91]) compared to unplanned pregnancies in rural Malawi. There was no relationship between pregnancy intention and the composite measure of miscarriage, stillbirth, low birthweight and neonatal death. There was some evidence that greater pregnancy intention was associated with reduced adjusted risk of stillbirth (0·93 [95%CI 0·87, 1·00]).Our study is the first to use a psychometrically valid measure of pregnancy intention, and to do so antenatally. As pregnancy intention increases, the risk of postnatal depression and, possibly, stillbirth decreases. This suggests a new, clinical use for the LMUP; identifying women antenatally who are at risk of these adverse pregnancy outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2897333992,"Background Biofortified orange-fleshed sweetpotato (OFSP) varieties are being promoted to reduce vitamin A deficiencies due to their higher beta-carotene content. For OFSP varieties to have impact they need to be accepted and consumed at scale amongst populations suffering from vitamin A deficiencies. Objective We investigated the sensory and cultural acceptability of OFSP varieties amongst households with children aged between 2–5 years old in two areas in Central and Southern Malawi using an integrated model of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Health Belief Model (HBM). Methods Sensory acceptability was measured using a triangle, preference and acceptance test using three OFSP varieties and one control variety, among 270 adults and 60 children. Based on a food ethnographic study, a questionnaire on cultural acceptability was developed and administered to 302 caretakers. Data were analyzed by calculating Spearman’s correlations between constructs and multiple linear regression modeling. Results The sensory evaluation indicates that all three OFSP varieties are accepted (scores >3 on 5-point scale), but there is a preference for the control variety over the three OFSP varieties. Almost all caretakers are intending to frequently prepare OFSP for their child in future (97%). Based on regression analysis, the constructs ‘subjective norms’ (β = 0.25, p = 0.00) reflecting social pressure, and ‘attitudes toward behavior’ (β = 0.14 p = 0.01), reflecting the feelings towards serving their child OFSP, were the best predictors for caretakers’ behavior to prepare OFSP for their child. Conclusions Our study shows that both sensory and cultural attributes can influence acceptability of varieties and consumption amongst households with children. Considering these attributes can improve the impact of biofortified crops in future programming, by reducing Vitamin A deficiencies through the intake of these nutrient-rich crops."
https://openalex.org/W2897806108,"Adult aging is associated with difficulties in recognizing negative facial expressions such as fear and anger. However, happiness and disgust recognition is generally found to be less affected. Eye-tracking studies indicate that the diagnostic features of fearful and angry faces are situated in the upper regions of the face (the eyes), and for happy and disgusted faces in the lower regions (nose and mouth). These studies also indicate age-differences in visual scanning behavior, suggesting a role for attention in emotion recognition deficits in older adults. However, because facial features can be processed extrafoveally, and expression recognition occurs rapidly, eye-tracking has been questioned as a measure of attention during emotion recognition. In this study, the Moving Window Technique (MWT) was used as an alternative to the conventional eye-tracking technology. By restricting the visual field to a moveable window, this technique provides a more direct measure of attention. We found a strong bias to explore the mouth across both age groups. Relative to young adults, older adults focused less on the left eye, and marginally more on the mouth and nose. Despite these different exploration patterns, older adults were most impaired in recognition accuracy for disgusted expressions. Correlation analysis revealed that among older adults, more mouth exploration was associated with faster recognition of both disgusted and happy expressions. As a whole, these findings suggest that in aging there are both attentional differences and perceptual deficits contributing to less accurate emotion recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2949296643,"Nanoparticles often only exploit the upregulation of a receptor on cancer cells to enhance intratumoral deposition of therapeutic and imaging agents. However, a single targeting moiety assumes that a tumor is homogenous and static. Tumoral microenvironments are both heterogenous and dynamic, often displaying variable spatial and temporal expression of targetable receptors throughout disease progression. Here, we evaluated the in vivo performance of an iron oxide nanoparticle in terms of targeting and imaging of orthotropic mouse models of aggressive breast tumors. The nanoparticle, a multi-component nanochain, was comprised of 3-5 iron oxide nanoparticles chemically linked in a linear chain. The nanoparticle's surface was decorated with two types of ligands each targeting two different upregulated biomarkers on the tumor endothelium, P-selectin and fibronectin. The nanochain exhibited improved tumor deposition not only through vascular targeting but also through its elongated structure. A single-ligand nanochain exhibited a ~2.5-fold higher intratumoral deposition than a spherical nanoparticle variant. Furthermore, the dual-ligand nanochain exhibited higher consistency in generating detectable MR signals compared to a single-ligand nanochain. Using a 7T MRI, the dual-ligand nanochains exhibited highly detectable MR signal within 3h after injection in two different animal models of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2896175102,"Concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were measured in 22 surface sediment samples and an approximately 100-year scale sediment core collected from Poyang Lake. This valuable sediments enable analysis of spatial and temporal distribution patterns of PAH sources, and determine the anthropogenic impacts on Poyang Lake. Total PAH concentrations in the surface sediments ranged from 73.2 to 367.2 ng/g dw, and higher residues were encountered in regions with high-density populations and intensive human activities. Total PAH concentrations in the sediment core ranged from 42.0 to 334.0 ng/g dw and were grouped in two clusters (pre-1990s and post-1990s to the present). PAH concentrations in sediments changed both temporally and spatially, suggesting a difference in PAH sources. Before the 1990s, major PAH sources in the sediment core were from coal, wood and grass combustion. This finding naturally agrees with open lake conditions on a spatial scale, which were related to agricultural activities. Petroleum combustion from industrialization and urbanization has become the predominant PAH source in the sediment core from the 1990s to the present and corresponds to sources observed in the southwestern lake near the relatively developed Nanchang City. In the northern lake leading to the Yangtze River, certain petroleum-related contaminants from shipping have become the main PAH sources. The different PAH sources observed in sediments generally reflect the degree of socio-economic development in the Poyang Lake valley, which is consistent with the local written records, indirectly validating the connection of sediment PAH records to the history of human activities in and around Poyang Lake."
https://openalex.org/W2896653760,"How TATA-less promoters such as those within CpG islands (CGI) control gene expression is still a subject of active research. Here, we have identified the “CGCG element”, a ten-base pair motif with a consensus sequence of TCTCGCGAGA present in a group of promoter-associated CGI-enriched in ribosomal protein and housekeeping genes. This element is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates, found in DNase-accessible regions and employs RNA Pol II to activate gene expression. Through analysis of capped-nascent transcripts and supporting evidence from reporter assays, we demonstrate that this element activates bidirectional transcription through divergent start sites. Methylation of this element abrogates the associated promoter activity. When coincident with a TATA-box, directional transcription remains CGCG-dependent. Because the CGCG element is sufficient to drive transcription, we propose that its unmethylated form functions as a heretofore undescribed promoter element of a group of TATA-less CGI-associated promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2897670890,"Lipotransfer has been applied in breast augmentation surgery for several years and the resident adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) play an important role in enhancing fat graft survival. However, the interaction between ASCs and mammary epithelium is not fully understood. Many studies have shown that ASCs have a tumor-supportive effect in breast cancer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the effect of mammary epithelial cells on the human ASCs in 3D culture. ASCs were cultivated on matrigel in the conditioned medium (CM) prepared from a human breast epithelial cell line (HBL-100). The ASCs formed KRT18-positive acini-like structures after stimulation with breast epithelial cells. The expression of epithelial genes (CDH1 and KRT18) was up-regulated while the expression of mesenchymal specific genes (CDH2 and VIM) was down-regulated as determined by qRT-PCR. The stemness marker (CD29) and angiogenic factors (CD31 and VEGF) were also down-regulated as examined by immunofluorescence. In addition, the CM obtained from HBL-100 enhanced the migration and inhibited the adipogenic differentiation of ASCs. These results demonstrate that ASCs have the ability to transform into epithelial-like cells when cultured with mammary epithelial cells. Given these observations, we infer that ASCs have a positive effect on lipotransfer, not only due to their ability to secrete growth factors, but also due to their direct participation in the formation of new breast tissue."

While the influence of endophyte-infected tall fescue has been studied for decades, mitigation methods have not been clearly elucidated. Isoflavones found in Trifolium pratense (red clover) have been the subject of recent research regarding tall fescue toxicosis mitigation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of ergovaline and red clover isoflavones on rumen microbial populations, fiber degradation, and volatile fatty acids (VFA) in an in vitro system. Using a dose of 1.10 mg × L-1, endophyte-infected or endophyte-free tall fescue seed was added to ANKOM fiber bags with or without 2.19 mg of isoflavones in the form of a control, powder, or pulverized tablet, resulting in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangements of treatments. Measurements of pH, VFA, bacterial taxa, as well as the disappearance of neutral detergent fiber (aNDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and crude protein (CP) were taken after 48 h of incubation. aNDF disappearance values were significantly altered by seed type (P = 0.003) and isoflavone treatment (P = 0.005), and ADF disappearance values were significantly different in a seed × isoflavone treatment interaction (P ≤ 0.05). A seed × isoflavone treatment interaction was also observed with respect to CP disappearance (P ≤ 0.05). Eighteen bacterial taxa were significantly altered by seed × isoflavone treatment interaction groups (P ≤ 0.05), eight bacterial taxa were increased by isoflavones (P ≤ 0.05), and ten bacterial taxa were altered by seed type (P ≤ 0.05). Due to the beneficial effect of isoflavones on tall fescue seed fiber degradation, these compounds may be viable options for mitigating fescue toxicosis. Further research should be conducted to determine physiological implications as well as microbiological changes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2895920313,"The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)–Smad signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the control of bone homeostasis by regulating osteoblast activity. It is known that the ubiquitin ligase Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor (Smurf)1 is a master negative regulator of BMP signaling, but how its stability and activity are regulated remains poorly understood. Our study showed that valosin-containing protein/p97, the mutations of which lead to rare forms of Paget's disease of bone (PDB)-like syndrome—such as inclusion body myopathy (IBM) associated with Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBM-PFD)—together with its adaptor nuclear protein localization (NPL)4, specifically interact with Smurfl and deliver the ubiquitinated Smurfl for degradation. Depletion of either p97 or NPL4 resulted in the elevation of Smurfl protein level and decreased BMP signaling accordingly. Mechanically, a typical proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine motif specifically existing in Smurfl is necessary for its recognition and degradation by p97, and this process is dependent on p97 ATPase activity. More importantly, compared with p97 WT, PDB-associated mutation of p97 (mainly A232E) harboring the higher ATPase activity of p97 further promoted Smurfl degradation, thus increasing BMP signaling activity. Our findings first establish a link between p97 and Smurfl, providing an in-depth understanding of how Smurfl is regulated, as well as the mechanism of p97-related bone diseases.—Li, H., Cui, Y., Wei, J., Liu, C., Chen, Y., Cui, C.-P., Li, L., Zhang, X., Zhang, L.

HIV testing amongst drug users needs further improvement. Methods Interviewer-administered questionnaires were used for data collection amongst 600 heterosexual drug users from the community and a municipal detention centre, where criminal suspects are supervised. Descriptive statistics, univariate analysis and multilevel logistic regression analysis were used to identify the factors associated with HIV testing amongst heterosexual drug users. All participants were screened HIV and sexually transmitted infections. Results Amongst 600 participants, 554 (92.3%) were methamphetamine users, and 155 (25.8%) underwent HIV testing in the past year. Multivariate analysis results revealed that drug users who were single (adjusted odds ratio(AOR) = 1.923, 95% confidence interval(CI) = 1.189–3.109), had less knowledge of HIV (AOR = 1.706, 95% CI = 1.074–2.711), used only one kind of drug (AOR = 2.649, 95% CI = 1.155–6.077), used drug via a non-injection route (AOR = 2.121, 95% CI = 1.103–4.078), did not receive free condoms (AOR = 2.307, 95% CI = 1.129–4.715) and who did not receive free publicity material from health workers in the past year (AOR = 2.828, 95% CI = 1.757–4.552) were less likely to undergo HIV testing. A total of 594 participants underwent HIV and syphilis screening in this survey. Amongst these participants, 2 (0.3%) were HIV antibody positive, and 88 (14.8%) showed positive results in both non-treponemal test (rapid plasma regain test) and treponemal test (Treponema pallidum particle agglutination test) for the first time. Conclusions The rate of HIV test uptake amongst heterosexual drug users in China remains low. Thus, more specific interventions are urgently needed to improve the utilisation of HIV testing amongst heterosexual drug users, particularly amongst non-injection drug users in China."

Previous research has established that the Moral Expansiveness Scale (MES) is a powerful predictor of altruistic moral decision-making and captures a unique dimension of moral cognition. However, the length of the full MES may be restrictive for some researchers. Here we establish the reliability and validity of a reduced moral expansiveness scale, the MESx. Consistent with the full version, the MESx is strongly associated with (but not reducible to) theoretically related constructs, such as endorsement of universalism values, identification with all humanity, and connectedness to nature. The MESx also predicted measures of altruistic moral decision-making to the same degree as the full MES. Further, the MESx passed tests of discriminant validity, was unrelated to political conservatism (unlike the full MES), only mildly associated with the tendency to provide socially desirable responses, and produced moderate reliability over time. We conclude that the MESx is a psychometrically valid alternative for researchers requiring a short measure of moral expansiveness."

CIK mRNAs were extracted and sequenced at days 0, 1, 7, and 14 and subjected to bioinformatics analyses. Using weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA), we identified two major gene modules that mediate immune cell activation and mitosis. We found that activation and cytotoxicity of CIK cells likely rely on cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) and its protein partner LCK proto-oncogene, Src family tyrosine kinase (LCK). A time-course series analysis revealed that CIK cells have relatively low immunogenicity because of decreased expression of some self-antigens. Importantly, we identified several crucial activating receptors and auxiliary adhesion receptors expressed on CIK cells that may function as tumor sensors. Interestingly, cytotoxicity-associated genes, including those encoding PRF1, GZMB, FASL, and several cytokines, were up-regulated in mature CIK cells. Most immune-checkpoint molecules and inflammatory tumor-promoting factors were down-regulated in the CIK cells, suggesting efficacy and safety in future clinical trials.

Using input indicators from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the national representative survey Second Australian Study of Health and Relationships, and national HIV- behavioural surveillance, we calculated the size of the population of sexually active gay men and estimated a range for the number eligible for PrEP using different scenarios based on the guidelines. In 2015, an estimated 108,850 sexually-active 16-69-year-old gay men were classified as at risk of acquiring HIV in Australia. Of these men, 10,558 to 30,913 (9.7%-28.4%) were classified as being at high risk and therefore eligible for PrEP, most commonly due to recent receptive condomless intercourse with casual partners (6.1% to 15.5%), STI infections (5.4% to 10.6%) or the use of crystal methamphetamine (1.4% to 9.4%). The higher estimates included men who may have been at HIV risk for shorter time periods or with fewer partners. Australian PrEP guidelines recommend targeting PrEP to people at high HIV risk. Our estimation of potential PrEP users informed PrEP implementation in Australia. The choice of PrEP eligibility criteria, and interpretation of the guidelines, strongly affects the population estimates. In the future, higher numbers of gay men may become eligible for PrEP, because the estimates are largely defined by and follow trends in condomless anal intercourse. Our estimation methods can be adapted to other settings."

A total of 87 laboratory professionals participated in the selected health facilities, with a response rate of (100%). Standardized pre-validated slide panels and questionnaire were distributed to laboratory professionals by the principal investigator. The panel slides were comprised of 5 positives and 3 negative blood films. The laboratory professionals were requested to report the parasite density using semi-quantitative (+) and per micro-liter methods. Their performances of slide readings were compared with the experts’ readings. Agreement in detecting malaria parasites between laboratory professionals and expert was estimated using the kappa score. Results The overall sensitivity and specificity of the laboratory professionals in detecting malaria parasites were 83% and 97%, respectively. Similarly, positive predictive values of 98.1% and negative predictive values of 77.7% were reported. The percent agreement between laboratory professionals and expert microscopist in the detection of malaria parasites was 88.5% with a Kappa index of 0.78. Percent agreement in species identification and reporting of Pf/Pv mixed infections were 27.2% and 22.4%, respectively. About 62.2% of the laboratory professionals reported parasite density using semi-quantitative method. While none of them reported per micro-liter method. Conclusions The current study showed that laboratory professionals had good performance in parasite detection. However, poor performance was seen in both species identification and reporting of Pf/Pv mixed infections."

Methods Twenty-four cervical vertebrae (C4-C6) from eight fresh-frozen human cervical spines were subjected to mechanical testing after being instrumented for open-door laminoplasty using a newly designed plate-spacer device with a monocoque structure (plate-spacer group; n = 12) or by conventional miniplate-alone fixation (miniplate group; n = 12). Cantilever bending testing was performed by applying a compressive load in the cranio-caudal direction to the base of the spinous process of the reconstructed laminar arch constructs until failure and strength and stiffness of the laminar arch were determined. The results are presented as mean ± standard deviation. Results The plate-spacer group was approximately twice as strong as the miniplate group (27.6 ± 16.5 N vs. 13.5 ± 7.3 N, p < 0.05). Stiffness in the plate-spacer group exhibited the same trend (19.6 ± 9.3 N/mm vs. miniplate group: 11.4 ± 6.9 N/mm, p < 0.05). Conclusion The fixation with the monocoque plate-spacer construct for open-door laminoplasty provided higher structural properties when compared against the plate-alone fixation. The spacer in the plate-spacer construct appears to contribute by preventing large deformations of the laminar arch caused by bending in cranio-caudal direction. Future studies will be required to investigate stress/strain distribution in the laminar arch constructs."

https://openalex.org/W2897839023,"Prior research in organizations has shown that the spanning of distinct social categories usually leads to an unfavorable reaction from the audience. In the music field, however, a recombination of categories has long been celebrated as a major source of innovation. In this research, we conduct a systematical research on the effect of spanning behavior by musicians with a particular focus on the structural heterogeneity of categorical boundaries. We first ask whether the blending of distinct music genres is penalized in the music field, and then investigate how the outcomes of spanning behavior are differentiated by the structural characteristics of each genres. After collecting a comprehensive dataset of musicians in the United States from diverse sources including AllMusic, iTunes, and MusicBrainz, we construct a two-mode network of musicians and subgenres. In calculating musicians' genre-spanning behavior, we suggest a new diversity metric by incorporating the affinity between genres. Our results suggest that genre-generalist musicians who combine distinct music genres are more likely to be devaluated by listeners compared to genre-specialists who adhere to a single genre. Moreover, we find that musicians tend to be more penalized when they blend genres that have nonporous boundaries rather than penetrable boundaries. This research expands our understanding of the conditions under which boundary crossing leads to negative audience evaluation."
