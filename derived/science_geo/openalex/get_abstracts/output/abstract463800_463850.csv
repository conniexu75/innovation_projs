https://openalex.org/W2111648798,"The dynamic nature of gene expression enables cellular programming, homeostasis and environmental adaptation in living systems. Dissection of causal gene functions in cellular and organismal processes therefore necessitates approaches that enable spatially and temporally precise modulation of gene expression. Recently, a variety of microbial and plant-derived light-sensitive proteins have been engineered as optogenetic actuators, enabling high-precision spatiotemporal control of many cellular functions. However, versatile and robust technologies that enable optical modulation of transcription in the mammalian endogenous genome remain elusive. Here we describe the development of light-inducible transcriptional effectors (LITEs), an optogenetic two-hybrid system integrating the customizable TALE DNA-binding domain with the light-sensitive cryptochrome 2 protein and its interacting partner CIB1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. LITEs do not require additional exogenous chemical cofactors, are easily customized to target many endogenous genomic loci, and can be activated within minutes with reversibility. LITEs can be packaged into viral vectors and genetically targeted to probe specific cell populations. We have applied this system in primary mouse neurons, as well as in the brain of freely behaving mice in vivo to mediate reversible modulation of mammalian endogenous gene expression as well as targeted epigenetic chromatin modifications. The LITE system establishes a novel mode of optogenetic control of endogenous cellular processes and enables direct testing of the causal roles of genetic and epigenetic regulation in normal biological processes and disease states."
https://openalex.org/W2077545286,"Bacteria employ type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) to facilitate interactions with prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Despite the widespread identification of T6SSs among Gram-negative bacteria, the number of experimentally validated substrate effector proteins mediating these interactions remains small. Here, employing an informatics approach, we define novel families of T6S peptidoglycan glycoside hydrolase effectors. Consistent with the known intercellular self-intoxication exhibited by the T6S pathway, we observe that each effector gene is located adjacent to a hypothetical open reading frame encoding a putative periplasmically localized immunity determinant. To validate our sequence-based approach, we functionally investigate a representative family member from the soil-dwelling bacterium Pseudomonas protegens. We demonstrate that this protein is secreted in a T6SS-dependent manner and that it confers a fitness advantage in growth competition assays with Pseudomonas putida. In addition, we determined the 1.4 Å x-ray crystal structure of this effector in complex with its cognate immunity protein. The structure reveals the effector shares highest overall structural similarity to a glycoside hydrolase family associated with peptidoglycan N-acetylglucosaminidase activity, suggesting that T6S peptidoglycan glycoside hydrolase effector families may comprise significant enzymatic diversity. Our structural analyses also demonstrate that self-intoxication is prevented by the immunity protein through direct occlusion of the effector active site. This work significantly expands our current understanding of T6S effector diversity."

HC-HA complex (HC-HA) purified from human amniotic membrane consists of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid (HA) covalently linked to the heavy chain (HC) 1 of inter-α-trypsin inhibitor. In this study, we show that soluble HC-HA also contained pentraxin 3 and induced the apoptosis of both formyl-Met-Leu-Phe or LPS-activated neutrophils and LPS-activated macrophages while not affecting the resting cells. This enhanced apoptosis was caused by the inhibition of cell adhesion, spreading, and proliferation caused by HC-HA binding of LPS-activated macrophages and preventing adhesion to the plastic surface. Preferentially, soluble HC-HA promoted phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils in resting macrophages, whereas immobilized HC-HA promoted phagocytosis in LPS-activated macrophages. Upon concomitant LPS stimulation, immobilized HC-HA but not HA polarized macrophages toward the M2 phenotype by down-regulating IRF5 protein and preventing its nuclear localization and by down-regulating IL-12, TNF-α, and NO synthase 2. Additionally, IL-10, TGF-β1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, LIGHT (TNF superfamily 14), and sphingosine kinase-1 were up-regulated, and such M2 polarization was dependent on TLR ligation. Collectively, these data suggest that HC-HA is a unique matrix component different from HA and uses multiple mechanisms to suppress M1 while promoting M2 phenotype. This anti-inflammatory action of HC-HA is highly desirable to promote wound healing in diseases heightened by unsuccessful transition from M1 to M2 phenotypes.Background: HC-HA is a unique anti-inflammatory matrix different from hyaluronic acid (HA).Results: Soluble HC-HA induces apoptosis of inflammatory neutrophils and macrophages, and immobilized HC-HA promotes M2 polarization upon LPS/TLR ligation while both enhancing macrophage phagocytosis.Conclusion: HC-HA exerts its anti-inflammatory action using multiple mechanisms.Significance: HC-HA is the first known matrix component to polarize M2b.

Inflammation serves as the first host response to real or perceived threats to tissue homeostasis. It is heralded by the recruitment of neutrophils, which eliminate pathogens and damaged tissues before eventually undergoing apoptosis (1.Frasch S.C. Nick J.A. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Worthen G.S.

To better understand the molecular mechanism of these clinical efficacies of cryopreserved AM, we have previously found that soluble AM extract (AME; e.g., AM extracted by PBS) promotes apoptosis of Ifn-γ-, LPS-, and Ifn-γ/LPS-activated but not resting macrophages and down-regulates the expression of M1 markers such as TNF-α, IL-6, CD86, and class II MHC while up-regulating the M2 cytokine IL-10 (41.He H.

Herein, we further demonstrate that HC-HA is indeed responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of AM by promoting apoptosis of activated but not resting neutrophils and macrophages and by polarizing the M2 phenotype in LPS-activated macrophages for efficient phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils.

(Miami, FL). After washing off the original storage medium, intact AM was frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to fine particles (BioPulverizer, Biospec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK) followed by homogenization on ice. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 48,000 g at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by two runs of ultracentrifugation in CsCl/4 M guanidine HCl at the initial density of 1.35 g/ml (1st run) and 1.40 g/ml (2nd run). Fractions containing HA measured by the HA Quantitative Test Kit but no detectable amount of proteins measured by the BCA assay were designated as HC-HA. These fractions were pooled and dialyzed extensively with sterile distilled water. Thus, we expressed HC-HA concentration based on the HA concentration. The covalent coupling of HA or HC-HA was performed on the surface of CovaLink NH 96-well as previously reported (43.He H. Li W. Tseng D.Y. Zhang S. Chen S.Y. Day A.J. Tseng S.C.

In brief, CovaLink NH 96-well plates were sterilized in 70% alcohol for 1 h then washed three times with distilled water. In each well, 100 μl of 0.184 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS, 0.123 mg/ml of EDAC, and 20 μg/ml HA or HC-HA in distilled water was added. The plate was incubated at 4 °C overnight or at 25 °C for 2 h before the coupling solution was removed, washed three times with PBS containing 2 m NaCl and 50 mm MgSO4, and washed three times with PBS. Neutrophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy human donors using dextran density [Lymphocyte Poly(R)] centrifugation according to the manufacturer's instruction. Neutrophils were cultivated at 6.3 × 105/cm2 at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Neutrophils were activated with 1 μm fMLP or 1 μg/ml LPS for 20 h to reduce apoptosis or treated with 20 μm R-roscovitine (a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases or CDKs) for 8 h to enhance apoptosis (45.Rossi A.G.

Suppression of activation and induction of apoptosis in RAW264.7 cells by amniotic membrane extract.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2008; 49: 4468-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To measure cell proliferation, resting or 1 μg/ml LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells (3.1 × 104/cm2) were treated with 25 μg/ml of soluble HA or HC-HA immediately before seeding on plastic 96-well plates. In parallel, the same density of resting and LPS-stimulated cells was seeded on immobilized HA or HC-HA wells. After incubation for 22 h, cells were labeled with 10 μm BrdU for 2 h prior to Cell Proliferation ELISA to determine the amount of BrdU incorporated into the cellular DNA. Resting RAW264.7 cells were seeded at 3.1 × 105/cm2 (or 1 × 105 per each well) with or without immobilized HA or HC-HA and simultaneously treated with or without 1 μg/ml LPS for 6 days. After removal of the cell culture medium, the cells were washed twice with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. Afterward, 0.1 ml of apoptotic neutrophils (pretreated with 20 μm roscovitine for 8 h to induce >90% apoptosis, 2 × 105 per well) were added to each well containing differently treated macrophages for 30 min at 37 °C. Apoptotic neutrophils that were not phagocytosed by macrophages were removed. The remaining cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed with RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA,1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate,1 mm b-glycerophosphate,1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were subjected to human myeloperoxidase ELISA assay. The phagocytic index was expressed as the relative units of the myeloperoxidase activity in each sample normalized with its respective total protein content. This index was arbitrarily defined as 100% in resting RAW264.7 cells on plastic controls with or without immobilization. Resting RAW264.7 cells were harvested using enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer and treated with or without 1 μg/ml LPS, mixed with 25 μg/ml of soluble HA or HC-HA, and immediately seeded on plastic 96-well (3.1 × 105/cm2). Alternatively, these cells were seeded on immobilized control, HA, or HC-HA (3.1 × 105/cm2).

https://openalex.org/W2104950188,"Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that entails impairments of memory, thinking and behavior and culminates into brain atrophy. Impaired glucose uptake (accumulating into energy deficits) and synaptic plasticity have been shown to be affected in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease. This study examines the ability of lipoic acid to increase brain glucose uptake and lead to improvements in synaptic plasticity on a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (3xTg-AD) that shows progression of pathology as a function of age; two age groups: 6 months (young) and 12 months (old) were used in this study. 3xTg-AD mice fed 0.23% w/v lipoic acid in drinking water for 4 weeks showed an insulin mimetic effect that consisted of increased brain glucose uptake, activation of the insulin receptor substrate and of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Lipoic acid supplementation led to important changes in synaptic function as shown by increased input/output (I/O) and long term potentiation (LTP) (measured by electrophysiology). Lipoic acid was more effective in stimulating an insulin-like effect and reversing the impaired synaptic plasticity in the old mice, wherein the impairment of insulin signaling and synaptic plasticity was more pronounced than those in young mice."

https://openalex.org/W2075558198,"The hickory genus (Carya) contains ca. 17 species distributed in subtropical and tropical regions of eastern Asia and subtropical to temperate regions of eastern North America. Previously, the phylogenetic relationships between eastern Asian and eastern North American species of Carya were not fully confirmed even with an extensive sampling, biogeographic and diversification patterns had thus never been investigated in a phylogenetic context. We sampled 17 species of Carya and 15 species representing all other genera of the Juglandaceae as outgroups, with eight nuclear and plastid loci to reconstruct the phylogeny of Carya. The phylogenetic positions of seven extinct genera of the Juglandaceae were inferred using morphological characters and the molecular phylogeny as a backbone constraint. Divergence times within Carya were estimated with relaxed Bayesian dating. Biogeographic analyses were performed in DIVA and LAGRANGE. Diversification rates were inferred by LASER and APE packages. Our results support two major clades within Carya, corresponding to the lineages of eastern Asia and eastern North America. The split between the two disjunct clades is estimated to be 21.58 (95% HPD 11.07-35.51) Ma. Genus-level DIVA and LAGRANGE analyses incorporating both extant and extinct genera of the Juglandaceae suggested that Carya originated in North America, and migrated to Eurasia during the early Tertiary via the North Atlantic land bridge. Fragmentation of the distribution caused by global cooling in the late Tertiary resulted in the current disjunction. The diversification rate of hickories in eastern North America appeared to be higher than that in eastern Asia, which is ascribed to greater ecological opportunities, key morphological innovations, and polyploidy."

Activation of the inflammatory response promotes the production of both superoxide (O2⨪) and nitric oxide (•NO). These two species react at diffusion-limited rates, giving rise to the formation of the oxidizing and nitrating product peroxynitrite (ONOO−) (1.Pacher P. Beckman J.S. Liaudet L.

Additionally, fatty acid nitroalkenes are metabolized via a combination of β-oxidation and reduction to non-electrophilic nitroalkane derivatives (22.Rudolph V. Schopfer F.J. Khoo N.K. Rudolph T.K.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) were injected intravenously with 16 mg/kg NO2-OA. Blood was obtained as a function of time, and plasma was promptly isolated and supplemented with NO2-[13C18]OA internal standard. Nitrated fatty acids were extracted from plasma after protein precipitation with four volumes of acetonitrile and analyzed by LC-MS/MS as described in the following section. Quantification of NO2-OA and nitro-stearic acid (NO2-SA) and its corresponding β-oxidation metabolites was performed by stable isotopic dilution analysis using NO2-OA and NO2-SA calibration curves in the presence of the NO2-[13C18]OA internal standard (34.Woodcock S.R.

Preliminary experiments indicate that shorter chain nitroalkenes (6-nitrononenoic acid and 6-nitrododecenoic acid) displayed ionization efficiencies and detector responses that were similar to NO2-OA. NO2-SA was synthesized by sodium borohydride reduction of synthetic NO2-OA, purified (>95% per NMR analysis) and determined to be undistinguishable from the product obtained upon total PtGR-1 reduction. Furthermore, comparison of calibration curves prepared with NO2-SA and NO2-OA in the presence of NO2-[13C18]OA indicated a similar MS response toward both molecules, thus allowing the use of NO2-OA calibration curves for quantification of both saturated and unsaturated nitro fatty acids. For detection of endogenous NO2-CLA and its reduced derivative NO2-dihydro-CLA in human circulation, plasma (1 ml) was treated with 1% sulfanilamide (final concentration) to quench any reactive nitrogen species that could be derived from the acidification of contaminating nitrite and extracted with 2 volumes of hexane/isopropyl alcohol/formic acid 1M (30:20:2) followed by the addition of 1 volume of hexane. The organic phase was isolated, dried under nitrogen, and resolvated in acetonitrile for LC-MS/MS determination. Extracts were supplemented with 15NO2-CLA and 15NO2-dihydro-CLA to confirm endogenous NO2-CLA and NO2-dihydro-CLA identification. Animals were housed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996). All rodent and clinical studies were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Approval 12070398) and the Institutional Review Board (Approval 09090105). Fatty acids were resolved by HPLC with a C18 reversed phase column (Gemini 2 × 20 mm, 3 μm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) using a water/acetonitrile solvent system containing 0.1% acetic acid and a 0.75 ml/min flow rate. Samples were loaded into the column in either 10 or 30% acetonitrile/acetic acid for determination of 15-oxo-PGE2 and nitro-fatty acid derivatives respectively. After loading, the percentage of organic phase was increased linearly for the next 5.1 min up to 70% for 15-oxo-PGE2 metabolites or 85% for nitro-fatty acids. The column was then washed with 100% organic phase (5.2–6.7min) and re-equilibrated to initial conditions for an additional 2.3 min. MS analysis was performed using either an API 5000 or an API Qtrap 4000 (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) in the negative ion mode with the following settings: source temperature 550 °C, curtain gas 40, ionization spray voltage −4500, ion source gas 1 40, ion source gas 2 40, declustering potential −70V, entrance potential −4 V, collision energy −15V and −35V (PGE2 derivatives and nitrated fatty acids respectively), collision cell exit potential −5 V. Nitrated fatty acids were detected by collision-induced fragmentation of the parent ions to a charged nitro group (m/z 46) following the specific transitions for: NO2-OA (326.2/46), NO2-LA (324.2/46), NO2-CLA (324.2/46), and NO2-[13C18]OA (344.2/46). Transitions corresponding to reduced derivatives were obtained by adding 2 mass units to each parent compound: NO2-SA (328.2/46), NO2-dihydro-LA (326.2/46), and NO2-dihydro-CLA (326.2/46). The molecular mass of the precursor ions for the β-oxidation products was determined by subtracting 28 mass units to the corresponding parent compound as described (22.Rudolph V. Schopfer F.J.

https://openalex.org/W2010636802,"Objective To analyse predictors of costs in dementia from a societal perspective in a longitudinal setting. Method Healthcare resource use and costs were assessed retrospectively using a questionnaire in four waves at 6-month intervals in a sample of dementia patients (N = 175). Sociodemographic data, dementia severity and comorbidity at baseline, cognitive impairment and impairment in basic and instrumental activities of daily living were also recorded. Linear mixed regression models with random intercepts for individuals were used to analyse predictors of total and sector-specific costs. Results Impairment in activities of daily living significantly predicted total costs in dementia patients, with associations between basic activities of daily living and formal care costs on the one and instrumental activities of daily living and informal care costs on the other hand. Nursing home residence was associated with lower total costs than residence in the community. There was no effect of cognition on total or sector-specific costs. Conclusion Cognitive deficits in dementia are associated with costs only via their effect on the patients' capacity for activities of daily living. Transition into a nursing home may reduce total costs from a societal perspective, owing to the fact that a high amount of informal care required by severely demented patients prior to transition into a nursing home may cause higher costs than inpatient nursing care."
https://openalex.org/W2050665407,"Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis has a high economic value and is one of the most important aquaculture species in China. Despite it is economic importance, it has remained largely unstudied at the genomic level. In this study, we conducted a genome survey of Gp. lemaneiformis using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. In total, 18.70 Gb of high-quality sequence data with an estimated genome size of 97 Mb were obtained by HiSeq 2000 sequencing for Gp. lemaneiformis. These reads were assembled into 160,390 contigs with a N50 length of 3.64 kb, which were further assembled into 125,685 scaffolds with a total length of 81.17 Mb. Genome analysis predicted 3490 genes and a GC% content of 48%. The identified genes have an average transcript length of 1,429 bp, an average coding sequence size of 1,369 bp, 1.36 exons per gene, exon length of 1,008 bp, and intron length of 191 bp. From the initial assembled scaffold, transposable elements constituted 54.64% (44.35 Mb) of the genome, and 7737 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified. Among these SSRs, the trinucleotide repeat type was the most abundant (up to 73.20% of total SSRs), followed by the di- (17.41%), tetra- (5.49%), hexa- (2.90%), and penta- (1.00%) nucleotide repeat type. These characteristics suggest that Gp. lemaneiformis is a model organism for genetic study. This is the first report of genome-wide characterization within this taxon."
https://openalex.org/W2024996093,"Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the western world. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) can attenuate the proliferation of cancer cells, including colon cancer, and increase the efficacy of various anticancer drugs. However, these studies address the effects of n-3 PUFAs on the bulk of the tumor cells and not on the undifferentiated colon cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) that are responsible for tumor formation and maintenance. CSLCs have also been linked to the acquisition of chemotherapy resistance and to tumor relapse. Colon CSLCs have been immunophenotyped using several antibodies against cellular markers including CD133, CD44, EpCAM, and ALDH. Anti-CD133 has been used to isolate a population of colon cancer cells that retains stem cells properties (CSLCs) from both established cell lines and primary cell cultures. We demonstrated that the n-3 PUFA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), was actively incorporated into the membrane lipids of COLO 320 DM cells. 25 uM EPA decreased the cell number of the overall population of cancer cells, but not of the CD133 (+) CSLCs. Also, we observed that EPA induced down-regulation of CD133 expression and up-regulation of colonic epithelium differentiation markers, Cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and Mucin 2 (MUC2). Finally, we demonstrated that EPA increased the sensitivity of COLO 320 DM cells (total population) to both standard-of-care chemotherapies (5-Fluorouracil and oxaliplatin), whereas EPA increased the sensitivity of the CD133 (+) CSLCs to only 5-Fluorouracil."
https://openalex.org/W2039524696,"In African large herbivore assemblages, megaherbivores dominate the biomass and utilise the greatest share of available resources. Consequently, they are considered a separate trophic guild that structures the food niches of coexisting large herbivores. However, there exists little empirical evidence on how food resources are shared within this guild, and none for direct competition for food between megaherbivores. Using the histological analysis of faeces, we explore this phenomenon for African elephant Loxodonta africana and black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis in the Addo Elephant National Park, South Africa, where the accumulated impacts of elephant have reduced browse availability. Despite being unable to generalise beyond our study sites, our observations support the predictions of competition theory (as opposed to optimality theory) by showing (1) a clear seasonal separation in resource use between these megaherbivores that increased as resource availability declined, and (2) rhinoceros changed their selectivity in the absence of elephant (using an adjacent site) by expanding and shifting their diet along the grass-browse continuum, and in relation to availability. Although black rhinoceros are generally considered strict browsers, the most significant shift in diet occurred as rhinoceros increased their preferences for grasses in the presence of elephant. We speculate that the lack of specialised grazing adaptations may increase foraging costs in rhinoceros, through reduced harvest- and handling-efficiencies of grasses. In the short-term, this may be off-set by an enhanced tolerance for low quality food and by seasonally mobilising fat reserves; however, the long-term fitness consequences require further study. Our data suggest that managing elephant at high densities may compromise the foraging opportunities of coexisting browsers. This may be particularly important in small, fenced areas and overlapping preferred habitats where impacts intensify."
https://openalex.org/W2038048640,"Drought resistance and recovery ability are two important requisites for plant adaptation to drought environments. Proline (Pro) metabolism has been a major concern in plant drought tolerance. However, roles of Pro metabolism in plant recovery ability from severe drought stress are largely unexplored. Periploca sepium Bunge has gained increasing attention for its adaptation to dry environments. Here, we investigated Pro metabolism in different tissues of P. sepium seedlings in the course of drought stress and recovery. We found that leaf Pro metabolism response during post-drought recovery was dependant on drought severity. Pro biosynthesis was down-regulated during recovery from -0.4 MPa but increased continually and notably during recovery from -1.0 MPa. Significant correlation between Pro concentration and Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase activity indicates that Glutamate pathway is the predominant synthesis route during both drought and re-watering periods. Ornithine δ-aminotransferase activity was up-regulated significantly only during recovery from −1.0 MPa, suggesting positive contribution of ornithine pathway to improving plant recovery capacity from severe drought. In addition to up-regulation of biosynthesis, Pro transport from stems and roots also contributed to high Pro accumulation in leaves and new buds during recovery from −1.0 MPa, as indicated by the combined analysis of Pro concentration and its biosynthesis in stems, roots and new buds. Except its known roles as energy, carbon and nitrogen sources for plant rapid recovery, significant positive correlation between Pro concentration and total antioxidant activity indicates that Pro accumulation can also promote plant damage repair ability by up-regulating antioxidant activity during recovery from severe drought stress."
https://openalex.org/W1974444272,"Decreased interest in pleasurable stimuli including social withdrawal and reduced libido are some of the key symptomatic criteria for major depression, and thus assays that measure social and sexual behavior in rodents may be highly appropriate for modeling depressive states. Here we present a novel approach for validating rodent models of depression by assessing male urine scent marking (USM) made in consequence to a spot of urine from a proestrous female. USM is an ethologically important form of sexual communication expressed by males to attract females. The expression of this behavior is highly sensitive and adaptive to environmental cues and social status. We hypothesized that male USM behavior offers a naturalistic measure of social motivation that can be used to evaluate hedonic behaviors relevant to the study of mood disorders. We demonstrated that 1) adult male mice displayed a strong preference for marking proestrous female urine with a high degree of specificity, 2) exposure to chronic social defeat profoundly decreased USM whereas exposure to environmental enrichment increased USM, 3) the standard antidepressant fluoxetine reversed declines in USM induced by social defeat, 4) USM behavior closely correlated with other hedonic measures, and 5) USM scores in non-stressed mice predicted behavioral outcomes after defeat exposure such that mice displaying high preference for marking female urine prior to social defeat showed behavioral resiliency after social defeat. The findings indicate that the USM test is a sensitive, validated measure of psychosocial stress effects that has high predictive value for examination of stress resiliency and vulnerability and their neurobiological substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2145480387,"4-1BB (CD137), an inducible costimulatory molecule, strongly enhances the proliferation and effector function of CD8+ T cells. Since the serine/threonine kinase, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), is involved in a variety of signaling pathways of cellular proliferation, migration, immune responses, and apoptosis, we examined whether 4-1BB signaling activates GSK-3/β-catenin signaling and downstream transcription factors to enhance the proliferation of CD8+ T cells. 4-1BB signaling induces rapid activation of ERK and IκB degradation, and shows delayed activation of AKT at 24 h post 4-1BB stimulation on anti-CD3 activated T cells. ERK and AKT signals were required for sustained β-catenin levels by inactivating GSK-3, which was also observed with delayed kinetics after 4-1BB stimulation. As a transcriptional partner of β-catenin, 4-1BB signaling decreased levels of FOXO1 and increased levels of stimulatory TCF1 in CD8+ T cells at 2–3 days but not at early time points after 4-1BB engagement. The enhanced proliferation of CD8+ T cells due to 4-1BB signaling was completely abolished by treatment with the TCF1/β-catenin inhibitor quercetin. These results show that 4-1BB signaling enhances the proliferation of activated CD8+ T cells by activating the TCF1/β-catenin axis via the PI3K/AKT/ERK pathway. As effects of 4-1BB on AKT, FOXO1, β-catenin and GSK-3β showed delayed kinetics it is likely that an intervening molecule induced by 4-1BB and ERK signaling in activated T cells is responsible for these effects. These effects were observed on CD8+ but not on CD4+ T cells. Moreover, 4-1BB appeared to be unique among several TNFRs tested in inducing increase in stimulatory over inhibitory TCF-1."
https://openalex.org/W2064009278,"Numerous studies have documented the effects of social class on psychological and behavioral variables. However, lay beliefs about how social class affects these dimensions have not been systematically tested. Studies 1 and 2 assessed lay beliefs about the association between social class and 8 variables (including psychological and behavioral tendencies and cognitive ability). Study 3 assessed lay beliefs about the Big five personality traits and social class, and study 4 reframed the 8 variables from study 1 in opposite terms and yielded similar results. Study 5 contained the variables framed as in both studies 1 and 4, and replicated those results suggesting that framing effects were not responsible for the effects observed. Interestingly, for the most part lay beliefs about social class did not differ as a function of participants’ own social class. In general people held relatively accurate and consistent stereotypes about the relationship between social class and well-being, health, intelligence, and neuroticism. In contrast lay beliefs regarding social class and reasoning styles, as well as relational, social, and emotional tendencies were less consistent and coherent. This work suggests that on the whole people’s beliefs about social class are not particularly accurate, and further that in some domains there are contradictory stereotypes about the consequences of social class."
https://openalex.org/W1989626232,"Background Sex differences in spatial memory function have been reported with mixed results in the literature, with some studies showing male advantages and others showing no differences. When considering estrus cycle in females, results are mixed at to whether high or low circulating estradiol results in an advantage in spatial navigation tasks. Research involving humans and rodents has demonstrated males preferentially employ Euclidean strategies and utilize geometric cues in order to spatially navigate, whereas females employ landmark strategies and cues in order to spatially navigate. Methodology/Principal Findings This study used the water-based snowcone maze in order to assess male and female preference for landmark or geometric cues, with specific emphasis placed on the effects of estrus cycle phase for female rat. Performance and preference for the geometric cue was examined in relation to total hippocampal and hippocampal subregions (CA1&2, CA3 and dentate gyrus) volumes and entorhinal cortex thickness in order to determine the relation between strategy and spatial performance and brain area size. The study revealed that males outperformed females overall during training trials, relied on the geometric cue when the platform was moved and showed significant correlations between entorhinal cortex thickness and spatial memory performance. No gross differences in behavioural performance was observed within females when accounting for cyclicity, and only total hippocampal volume was correlated with performance during the learning trials. Conclusions/Significance This study demonstrates the sex-specific use of cues and brain areas in a spatial learning task."

https://openalex.org/W2020410346,"Thrombo-embolic ischemic stroke is a serious and debilitating disease, and it remains the second most common cause of death worldwide. Tobacco smoke exposure continues to be responsible for preventable deaths around the world, and is a major risk factor for stroke. Platelets play a fundamental role in clotting, and their pathophysiological functioning is present in smokers and stroke patients, resulting in a pro-thrombotic state. In the current manuscript, atomic force and scanning electron microscopy were used to compare the platelets of smokers, stroke patients and healthy individuals. Results showed that the elastic modulus of stroke platelets is decreased by up to 40%, whereas there is an elasticity decrease of up to 20% in smokers’ platelets. This indicates a biophysical alteration of the platelets. Ultrastructurally, both the stroke patients and smokers’ platelets are more activated than the healthy control group, with prominent cytoskeletal rearrangement involved; but to a more severe extent in the stroke group than in the smokers. Importantly, this is a confirmation of the extent of smoking as risk factor for stroke. We conclude by suggesting that the combined AFM and SEM analyses of platelets might give valuable information about the disease status of patients. Efficacy of treatment regimes on the integrity, cell shape, roughness and health status of platelets may be tracked, as this cell’s health status is crucial in the over-activated coagulation system of conditions like stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2040104372,"In cancer patients pervasive systemic suppression of Dendritic Cell (DC) differentiation and maturation can hinder vaccination efficacy. In this study we have extensively characterized migratory DC subsets from human skin and studied how their migration and T cell-stimulatory abilities were affected by conditioning of the dermal microenvironment through cancer-related suppressive cytokines. To assess effects in the context of a complex tissue structure, we made use of a near-physiological skin explant model. By 4-color flow cytometry, we identified migrated Langerhans Cells (LC) and five dermis-derived DC populations in differential states of maturation. From a panel of known tumor-associated suppressive cytokines, IL-10 showed a unique ability to induce predominant migration of an immature CD14(+)CD141(+)DC-SIGN(+) DC subset with low levels of co-stimulatory molecules, up-regulated expression of the co-inhibitory molecule PD-L1 and the M2-associated macrophage marker CD163. A similarly immature subset composition was observed for DC migrating from explants taken from skin overlying breast tumors. Whereas predominant migration of mature CD1a(+) subsets was associated with release of IL-12p70, efficient Th cell expansion with a Th1 profile, and expansion of functional MART-1-specific CD8(+) T cells, migration of immature CD14(+) DDC was accompanied by increased release of IL-10, poor expansion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and skewing of Th responses to favor coordinated FoxP3 and IL-10 expression and regulatory T cell differentiation and outgrowth. Thus, high levels of IL-10 impact the composition of skin-emigrated DC subsets and appear to favor migration of M2-like immature DC with functional qualities conducive to T cell tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1996845581,"Lysine acetylation has recently emerged as an important, widespread post-translational modification occurring on proteins that reside in multiple cellular compartments, including the mitochondria. However, no lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) has been definitively localized to this organelle to date. Here we describe the identification of an unusual homologue of Elp3 in early-branching protozoa in the phylum Apicomplexa. Elp3 is the catalytic subunit of the well-conserved transcription Elongator complex; however, Apicomplexa lack all other Elongator subunits, suggesting that the Elp3 in these organisms plays a role independent of transcription. Surprisingly, Elp3 in the parasites of this phylum, including Toxoplasma gondii (TgElp3), possesses a unique C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) that localizes the protein to the mitochondrion. As TgElp3 is devoid of known mitochondrial targeting signals, we used selective permeabilization studies to reveal that this KAT is oriented with its catalytic components facing the cytosol and its C-terminal TMD inserted into the outer mitochondrial membrane, consistent with a tail-anchored membrane protein. Elp3 trafficking to mitochondria is not exclusive to Toxoplasma as we also present evidence that a form of Elp3 localizes to these organelles in mammalian cells, supporting the idea that Elp3 performs novel functions across eukaryotes that are independent of transcriptional elongation.

Lysine acetylation has recently emerged as an important, widespread post-translational modification occurring on proteins that reside in multiple cellular compartments, including the mitochondria. However, no lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) has been definitively localized to this organelle to date. Here we describe the identification of an unusual homologue of Elp3 in early-branching protozoa in the phylum Apicomplexa. Elp3 is the catalytic subunit of the well-conserved transcription Elongator complex; however, Apicomplexa lack all other Elongator subunits, suggesting that the Elp3 in these organisms plays a role independent of transcription.

https://openalex.org/W1987962115,"Competing positive and negative signaling feedback pathways play a critical role in tuning the sensitivity of T cell receptor activation by creating an ultrasensitive, bistable switch to selectively enhance responses to foreign ligands while suppressing signals from self peptides. In response to T cell receptor agonist engagement, ERK is activated to positively regulate T cell receptor signaling through phosphorylation of Ser(59) Lck. To obtain a wide-scale view of the role of ERK in propagating T cell receptor signaling, a quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of 322 tyrosine phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry was performed on the human Jurkat T cell line in the presence of U0126, an inhibitor of ERK activation. Relative to controls, U0126-treated cells showed constitutive decreases in phosphorylation through a T cell receptor stimulation time course on tyrosine residues found on upstream signaling proteins (CD3 chains, Lck, ZAP-70), as well as downstream signaling proteins (VAV1, PLCγ1, Itk, NCK1). Additional constitutive decreases in phosphorylation were found on the majority of identified proteins implicated in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton pathway. Although the majority of identified sites on T cell receptor signaling proteins showed decreases in phosphorylation, Tyr(598) of ZAP-70 showed elevated phosphorylation in response to U0126 treatment, suggesting differential regulation of this site via ERK feedback. These findings shed new light on ERK's role in positive feedback in T cell receptor signaling and reveal novel signaling events that are regulated by this kinase, which may fine tune T cell receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W2055718791,"The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) impact multiple cellular processes including multivesicular body sorting, abscission, and viral budding. The AAA-ATPase Vps4 is required for ESCRT function, and its full activity is dependent upon the co-factor Vta1. The Vta1 carboxyl-terminal Vta1 SBP1 Lip5 (VSL) domain stimulates Vps4 function by facilitating oligomerization of Vps4 into its active state. Here we report the identification of the Vps4 stimulatory element (VSE) within Vta1 that is required for additional stimulation of Vps4 activity in vitro and in vivo. VSE activity is autoinhibited in a manner dependent upon the unstructured linker region joining the amino-terminal microtubule interacting and trafficking domains and the carboxyl-terminal VSL domain. The VSE is also required for Vta1-mediated Vps4 stimulation by ESCRT-III subunits Vps60 and Did2. These results suggest that ESCRT-III binding to the Vta1 microtubule interacting and trafficking domains relieves linker region autoinhibition of the VSE to produce maximal activation of Vps4 during ESCRT function."
https://openalex.org/W1983252783,"State-of-the-art monoclonal antibody (mAb) discovery methods that utilize surface display techniques in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells require multiple steps of reformatting and switching of hosts to transition from display to expression. This results in a separation between antibody affinity maturation and full-length mAb production platforms. Here, we report for the first time, a method in Glyco-engineered Pichia pastoris that enables simultaneous surface display and secretion of full-length mAb molecules with human-like N-glycans using the same yeast cell. This paradigm takes advantage of homo-dimerization of the Fc portion of an IgG molecule to a surface-anchored ""bait"" Fc, which results in targeting functional “half” IgGs to the cell wall of Pichia pastoris without interfering with the secretion of full length mAb. We show the utility of this method in isolating high affinity, well-expressed anti-PCSK9 leads from a designed library that was created by mating yeasts containing either light chain or heavy chain IgG libraries. Coupled with Glyco-engineered Pichia pastoris, this method provides a powerful tool for the discovery and production of therapeutic human mAbs in the same host thus improving drug developability and potentially shortening the discovery time cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2005932963,"Bortezomib therapy is now indispensable for multiple myeloma, but is associated with patient inconvenience due to intravenous injection and emerging drug resistance. The development of orally active proteasome inhibitors with distinct mechanisms of action is therefore eagerly awaited. Previously, we identified homopiperazine derivatives as a novel class of proteasome inhibitors with a different mode of proteasome binding from bortezomib. In this study, we show that K-7174, one of proteasome inhibitory homopiperazine derivatives, exhibits a therapeutic effect, which is stronger when administered orally than intravenously, without obvious side effects in a murine myeloma model. Moreover, K-7174 kills bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells carrying a β5-subunit mutation in vivo and primary cells from a patient resistant to bortezomib. K-7174 induces transcriptional repression of class I histone deacetylases (HDAC1, -2, and -3) via caspase-8-dependent degradation of Sp1, the most potent transactivator of class I HDAC genes. HDAC1 overexpression ameliorates the cytotoxic effect of K-7174 and abrogates histone hyperacetylation without affecting the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in K-7174-treated myeloma cells. Conversely, HDAC inhibitors enhance the activity of K-7174 with an increase in histone acetylation. These results suggest that class I HDACs are critical targets of K-7174-induced cytotoxicity. It is highly anticipated that K-7174 increases the tolerability and convenience of patients by oral administration and has the clinical utility in overcoming bortezomib resistance as a single agent or in combination with HDAC inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1979799470,"Yeast sporulation efficiency is a quantitative trait and is known to vary among experimental populations and natural isolates. Some studies have uncovered the genetic basis of this variation and have identified the role of sporulation genes (IME1, RME1) and sporulation-associated genes (FKH2, PMS1, RAS2, RSF1, SWS2), as well as non-sporulation pathway genes (MKT1, TAO3) in maintaining this variation. However, these studies have been done mostly in experimental populations. Sporulation is a response to nutrient deprivation. Unlike laboratory strains, natural isolates have likely undergone multiple selections for quick adaptation to varying nutrient conditions. As a result, sporulation efficiency in natural isolates may have different genetic factors contributing to phenotypic variation. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains in the genetically and environmentally diverse SGRP collection, we have identified genetic loci associated with sporulation efficiency variation in a set of sporulation and sporulation-associated genes. Using two independent methods for association mapping and correcting for population structure biases, our analysis identified two linked clusters containing 4 non-synonymous mutations in genes - HOS4, MCK1, SET3, and SPO74. Five regulatory polymorphisms in five genes such as MLS1 and CDC10 were also identified as putative candidates. Our results provide candidate genes contributing to phenotypic variation in the sporulation efficiency of natural isolates of yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2075659457,"To assess the extent to which the observed racial disparities in cardiac revascularization use can be explained by the variation across counties where patients live, and how the within-county racial disparities is associated with the local hospital capacity.Administrative data from Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council (PHC4) between 1995 and 2006.The study sample included 207,570 Medicare patients admitted to hospital for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We identified the use of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures within three months after the patient's initial admission for AMI. Multi-level hierarchical models were used to determine the extent to which racial disparities in procedure use were attributable to the variation in local hospital capacity.Blacks were less likely than whites to receive CABG (9.1% vs. 5.8%; p<0.001) and PCI (15.7% vs. 14.2%; p<0.001). The state-level racial disparity in use rate decreases for CABG, and increases for PCI, with the county adjustment. Higher number of revascularization hospitals per 1,000 AMI patients was associated with smaller within-county racial differences in CABG and PCI rates. Meanwhile, very low capacity of catheterization suites and AMI hospitals contributed to significantly wider racial gap in PCI rate.County variation in cardiac revascularization use rates helps explain the observed racial disparities. While smaller hospital capacity is associated with lower procedure rates for both racial groups, the impact is found to be larger on blacks. Therefore, consequences of fewer medical resources may be particularly pronounced for blacks, compared with whites."

This study investigated the effects of immunomodulator clarithromycin (CAM) supplementation on mucosal and systemic immunity in pediatric patients with influenza treated with neuraminidase inhibitors.A retrospective, non-randomized case series study was conducted among five treatment groups of 195 children aged 5.9±3.3 years infected with influenza A in 2008/2009 season. The five treatment groups were oseltamivir (OSV), zanamivir (ZNV), OSV+CAM, ZNV+CAM and untreated groups. Anti-viral secretory IgA (S-IgA) levels in nasal washes and IgG levels in sera were measured. The re-infection rate was analyzed among the same five treatment groups in the 2009/2010 season.Treatment of influenza with OSV and ZNV for 5 days attenuated the induction of anti-viral S-IgA in nasal washes and anti-viral IgG in serum, compared with the untreated group. The combination of CAM plus OSV or ZNV boosted and restored the production of mucosal S-IgA and systemic IgG. The re-infection rates in the subsequent season were significantly higher in the OSV and ZNV groups than the untreated, while CAM+OSV and CAM+ZNV tended to reduce such rate.CAM restored the attenuated anti-viral mucosal and systemic immunity and reduced the re-infection rate in the subsequent year in pediatric patients with influenza treated with OSV and ZNV."
https://openalex.org/W2056710989,"Interleukin-26 (IL-26) belongs to the IL-10 cytokine family, is produced by activated T cells, and targets epithelial target cells for signal transduction. Here, we describe the IL-26 effects on the infection of culture cells with recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) expressing green fluorescent protein. After pre-incubation with recombinant IL-26 and at low multiplicity of infection, VSV showed strongly enhanced infection and replication rates as measured for infectivity, for transcript levels, and for protein expression. Control proteins did not affect VSV infection. The IL-26 effect was independent of the IL-26 receptor and neutralized by anti-IL-26 serum. Pre-incubation of VSV was much more efficient than pre-incubation of the target cells to enhance virus infection. IL-26 increased virus adsorption to target cells as shown by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. In contrast, the infection of IL-26-treated human fibroblasts with HCMV was inhibited and the infection by HSV-1 was not altered by IL-26. Thus, IL-26 differentially modulates the infection by different enveloped viruses."

Although several computational methods have been developed to compare miRNAs, it is still a challenging and a badly needed task with the availability of various biological data resources. In this study, we proposed a novel graph theoretic property based computational framework and method, called miRFunSim, for quantifying the associations between miRNAs based on miRNAs targeting propensity and proteins connectivity in the integrated protein-protein interaction network. To evaluate the performance of our method, we applied the miRFunSim method to compute functional similarity scores of miRNA pairs between 100 miRNAs whose target genes have been experimentally supported and found that the functional similarity scores of miRNAs in the same family or in the same cluster are significantly higher compared with other miRNAs which are consistent with prior knowledge. Further validation analysis on experimentally verified miRNA-disease associations suggested that miRFunSim can effectively recover the known miRNA pairs associated with the same disease and achieve a higher AUC of 83.1%. In comparison with similar methods, our miRFunSim method can achieve more effective and more reliable performance for measuring the associations of miRNAs. We also conducted the case study examining liver cancer based on our method, and succeeded in uncovering the candidate liver cancer related miRNAs such as miR-34 which also has been proven in the latest study."
https://openalex.org/W2033884793,"Background Biomarkers to differentiate between active tuberculosis (TB) and latent TB infection (LTBI) and to monitor treatment responses are requested to complement TB diagnostics and control, particularly in patients with multi-drug resistant TB. We have studied soluble markers of the Toll-like-receptor 4 (TLR-4) pathway in various stages of TB disease and during anti-TB treatment. Methods Plasma samples from patients with culture confirmed drug-sensitive TB (n = 19) were collected before and after 2, 8 and 24 weeks of efficient anti-TB treatment and in a LTBI group (n = 6). Soluble (s) CD14 and myeloid differentiation-2 (MD-2) were analyzed by the Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was analyzed by the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate colorimetric assay. Nonparametric statistics were applied. Results Plasma levels of sCD14 (p<0.001), MD-2 (p = 0.036) and LPS (p = 0.069) were elevated at baseline in patients with untreated active TB compared to the LTBI group. MD-2 concentrations decreased after 2 weeks of treatment (p = 0.011), while LPS levels decreased after 8 weeks (p = 0.005). In contrast, sCD14 levels increased after 2 weeks (p = 0.047) with a subsequent modest decrease throughout the treatment period. There was no significant difference in concentrations of any of these markers between patients with pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB or between patients with or without symptoms. Conclusion Our data suggest that plasma levels of LPS, MD-2 and sCD14 can discriminate between active TB and LTBI. A decline in LPS and MD-2 concentrations was associated with response to anti-TB treatment. The clinical potential of these soluble TLR-4 pathway proteins needs to be further explored."
https://openalex.org/W2059830931,"FlyNap (triethylamine) is commonly used to anesthetize Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies. The purpose of this study was to determine whether triethylamine is a suitable anesthetic agent for research into circulatory physiology and immune competence in the mosquito, Anopheles gambiae (Diptera: Culicidae). Recovery experiments showed that mosquitoes awaken from traditional cold anesthesia in less than 7 minutes, but that recovery from FlyNap anesthesia does not begin for several hours. Relative to cold anesthesia, moderate exposures to FlyNap induce an increase in the heart rate, a decrease in the percentage of the time the heart contracts in the anterograde direction, and a decrease in the frequency of heartbeat directional reversals. Experiments employing various combinations of cold and FlyNap anesthesia then showed that cold exposure does not affect basal heart physiology, and that the differences seen between the cold and the FlyNap groups are due to a FlyNap-induced alteration of heart physiology. Furthermore, exposure to FlyNap eliminated the cardioacceleratory effect of crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP), and reduced a mosquito’s ability to survive a bacterial infection. Together, these data show that FlyNap is not a suitable substitute to cold anesthesia in experiments assessing mosquito heart function or immune competence. Moreover, these data also illustrate the intricate biology of the insect heart. Specifically, they confirm that the neurohormone CCAP modulates heart rhythms and that it serves as an anterograde pacemaker."
https://openalex.org/W2064350996,"Myocardial ischemic postconditioning (PosC) describes an acquired resistance to lethal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury afforded by brief episodes of I/R applied immediately after the ischemic insult. Cardioprotection is conveyed by parallel signaling pathways converging to prevent mitochondria permeability transition. Recent observations indicated that PostC is associated with free radicals generation, including nitric oxide (NO(.)) and superoxide (O2 (.-)), and that cardioprotection is abrogated by antioxidants. Since NO. And O2 (. -) react to form peroxynitrite, we hypothesized that postC might trigger the formation of peroxyntrite to promote cardioprotection in vivo. Rats were exposed to 45 min of myocardial ischemia followed by 3h reperfusion. PostC (3 cycles of 30 seconds ischemia/30 seconds reperfusion) was applied at the end of index ischemia. In a subgroup of rats, the peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulphonatophenyl) porphyrinato iron (FeTPPS) was given intravenously (10 mg/kg(-1)) 5 minutes before PostC. Myocardial nitrotyrosine was determined as an index of peroxynitrite formation. Infarct size (colorimetric technique and plasma creatine kinase-CK-levels) and left ventricle (LV) function (micro-tip pressure transducer), were determined. A significant generation of 3-nitrotyrosine was detected just after the PostC manoeuvre. PostC resulted in a marked reduction of infarct size, CK release and LV systolic dysfunction. Treatment with FeTPPS before PostC abrogated the beneficial effects of PostC on myocardial infarct size and LV function. Thus, peroxynitrite formed in the myocardium during PostC induces cardioprotective mechanisms improving both structural and functional integrity of the left ventricle exposed to ischemia and reperfusion in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2087003380,"The purpose of this study was to determine how pelvic morphology, body posture, and standing balance variables of scoliotic girls differ from those of able-bodied girls, and to classify neuro-biomechanical variables in terms of a lower number of unobserved variables. Twenty-eight scoliotic and twenty-five non-scoliotic able-bodied girls participated in this study. 3D coordinates of ten anatomic body landmarks were used to describe pelvic morphology and trunk posture using a Flock of Birds system. Standing balance was measured using a force plate to identify the center of pressure (COP), and its anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) displacements. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed to determine differences between the two groups. A factor analysis was used to identify factors that best describe both groups. Statistical differences were identified between the groups for each of the parameter types. While spatial orientation of the pelvis was similar in both groups, five of the eight trunk postural variables of the scoliotic group were significantly different that the able-bodied group. Also, five out of the seven standing balance variables were higher in the scoliotic girls. Approximately 60% of the variation is supported by 4 factors that can be associated with a set of variables; standing balance variables (factor 1), body posture variables (factor 2), and pelvic morphology variables (factors 3 and 4). Pelvic distortion, body posture asymmetry, and standing imbalance are more pronounced in scoliotic girls, when compared to able-bodied girls. These findings may be beneficial when addressing balance and ankle proprioception exercises for the scoliotic population."

We recently identified a clear association between upstream precipitation and indicator bacteria concentrations in the river water outside the intake to the drinking water utility. This study aimed to determine if variation in the incidence of acute gastrointestinal illnesses is associated with upstream precipitation.We acquired data, covering 1494 days, on the daily number of telephone calls to the nurse advice line from citizens in Gothenburg living in areas with Göta Älv as a fresh-water supply. We separated calls relating to gastrointestinal illnesses from other medical concerns, and analyzed their association with precipitation using a distributed lag non-linear Poisson regression model, adjusting for seasonal patterns and covariates. We used a 0-21-day lag period for precipitation to account for drinking water delivery times and incubation periods of waterborne pathogens.The study period contained 25,659 nurse advice calls relating to gastrointestinal illnesses. Heavy rainfall was associated with increased calls the same day and around 5-6 days later. Consecutive days of wet weather were also found to be associated with an increase in the daily number of gastrointestinal concerns. No associations were identified between precipitation and nurse advice calls relating to other medical concerns.An increase in nurse advice calls relating to gastrointestinal illnesses around 5-6 days after heavy rainfall is consistent with a hypothesis that the cause could be related to drinking water due to insufficient barriers in the drinking water production, suggesting the need for improved drinking water treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2021223784,"Objective The objectives of the current study are to provide nationally representative estimates of hospital based emergency department visits (ED) attributed to self inflicted injuries and attempted suicides among children in United States; and to identify potential methods of such intentional self inflicted injuries and attempted suicides. Methods The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (year 2007) was used. All ED visits occurring among children (aged ≤18 years) with an External Cause of Injury for any of self inflicted injuries were selected. Outcomes examined include hospital ED charges and hospitalization charges. All estimates were projected to national levels. Results 77,420 visits to hospital based emergency departments were attributed to self inflicted injuries among children (26,045 males and 51,370 females). The average age of the ED visits was 15.7 years. 134 patients died in ED’s (106 males and 28 females) and 93 died in hospitals following in-patient admission (75 males and 18 females). A greater proportion of male ED visits were discharged routinely as opposed to female ED visits (51.1% versus 44%). A greater proportion of male ED visits also died in the emergency departments compared to female visits (0.4% versus 0.05%). 17,965 ED visits necessitated admission into same hospital. The mean charge for each ED visit was $1,874. Self inflicted injuries by poisoning were the most frequently reported sources accounting for close to 70% of all ED visits. Conclusions Females comprise a greater proportion of ED visits attributed to self inflicted injuries. 227 children died either in the ED’s or in hospitals. The current study results highlight the burden associated with such injuries among children."

In cDNA-AFLP analysis of 25 DPA (days post anthesis) fiber mRNA, two FLA gene-related transcripts exhibit differential expression between Sea Island cotton (G. barbadense L.) and Upland cotton. Based on the transcript-derived fragment, RACE-PCR and realtime PCR technique, GbFLA5 full-length cDNA was isolated and its expression profiles were characterized in both cotton plant tissues and secondary cell wall (SCW) fibers in this study. The 1154 bp GbFLA5 cDNA contains an ORF of 720 bp, encoding GbFLA5 protein of 239 amino acids residues in length with an estimated molecular mass of 25.41 kDa and isoelectric point of 8.63. The deduced GbFLA5 protein contains an N-terminal signal sequence, two AGP-like domains, a single fasciclin-like domain, and a GPI anchor signal sequence. Phylogenetic analysis shows that GbFLA5 protein is homologous to some known SCW-specific expressed FLAs of plant developing xylem, tension wood and cotton fibers. In the SCW deposition stage from 15 to 45 DPA detected, FLA5 maintains a significantly higher expression level in Sea Island cotton fibers than in Upland cotton fibers. The increasing FLA5 transcript abundance coincided with the SCW deposition process and the expression intensity differences coincided with their fiber strength differences between Sea Island cotton and Upland cotton. These expression profile features of GbFLA5 in cotton fibers revealed its tissue-specific and SCW developmental stage-specific expression characters. Further analysis suggested that GbFLA5 is a crucial SCW-specific protein which may contribute to fiber strength by affecting cellulose synthesis and microfibril deposition orientation."

Our study aimed to investigate the effect of apelin on the proliferative potential in DR along with its antagonist inhibitory effects.Strong staining of apelin, co-localized with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was observed in the retina of diabetic rats. Apelin, GFAP, and VEGF mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased in the sample's retinas. Moreover, exogenous apelin promoted retinal Müller cell proliferation in vivo. Simultaneously, apelin induced GFAP and VEGF expression. F13A markedly reduced retinal gliosis caused by diabetes. Furthermore, F13A suppressed both GFAP and VEGF expression in vivo.Our results strongly suggest that apelin is associated with the development of DR and contributes to changes in the retinas of diabetic rats. Apelin induced promotion of cell proliferation lends support to the possibility that apelin may play a role in the progression of DR to a proliferative phase. This possible role deserves further investigation, which may offer new perspectives in the early prevention and treatment of DR."

We investigated the efficacy of manganese protection from Stx1-S and the more potent Stx2a isoform, using experimental systems well-established for studying Stx: in vitro responses of Vero monkey kidney cells, and in vivo toxicity to CD-1 outbred mice. Manganese treatment at the reported therapeutic concentration was toxic to Vero cells in culture and to CD-1 mice. At lower manganese concentrations that were better tolerated, we observed no protection from Stx1-S or Stx2a toxicity. The ability of manganese to prevent the effects of Stx may be particular to certain cell lines, mouse strains, or may only be manifested at high, potentially toxic manganese concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2079449446,"It is generally predicted that global warming will stimulate primary production and lead to more carbon (C) inputs to soil. However, many studies have found that soil C does not necessarily increase with increased plant litter input. Precipitation has increased in arid central Asia, and is predicted to increase more, so we tested the effects of adding fresh organic matter (FOM) and water on soil C sequestration in an arid region in northwest China. The results suggested that added FOM quickly decomposed and had minor effects on the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool to a depth of 30 cm. Both FOM and water addition had significant effects on the soil microbial biomass. The soil microbial biomass increased with added FOM, reached a maximum, and then declined as the FOM decomposed. The FOM had a more significant stimulating effect on microbial biomass with water addition. Under the soil moisture ranges used in this experiment (21.0%–29.7%), FOM input was more important than water addition in the soil C mineralization process. We concluded that short-term FOM input into the belowground soil and water addition do not affect the SOC pool in shrubland in an arid region."
https://openalex.org/W1998423138,"Background Directly comparing gene expression profiles of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and estrogen receptor-negative (ER−) breast cancers cannot determine whether differentially expressed genes between these two subtypes result from dysregulated expression in ER+ cancer or ER− cancer versus normal controls, and thus would miss critical information for elucidating the transcriptomic difference between the two subtypes. Principal Findings Using microarray datasets from TCGA, we classified the genes dysregulated in both ER+ and ER− cancers versus normal controls into two classes: (i) genes dysregulated in the same direction but to a different extent, and (ii) genes dysregulated to opposite directions, and then validated the two classes in RNA-sequencing datasets of independent cohorts. We showed that the genes dysregulated to a larger extent in ER+ cancers than in ER− cancers enriched in glycerophospholipid and polysaccharide metabolic processes, while the genes dysregulated to a larger extent in ER− cancers than in ER+ cancers enriched in cell proliferation. Phosphorylase kinase and enzymes of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis were upregulated to a larger extent in ER+ cancers than in ER− cancers, whereas glycogen synthase and phospholipase A2 were downregulated to a larger extent in ER+ cancers than in ER− cancers. We also found that the genes oppositely dysregulated in the two subtypes significantly enriched with known cancer genes and tended to closely collaborate with the cancer genes. Furthermore, we showed the possibility that these oppositely dysregulated genes could contribute to carcinogenesis of ER+ and ER− cancers through rewiring different subpathways. Conclusions GPI-anchor biosynthesis and glycogenolysis were elevated and hydrolysis of phospholipids was depleted to a larger extent in ER+ cancers than in ER− cancers. Our findings indicate that the genes oppositely dysregulated in the two subtypes are potential cancer genes which could contribute to carcinogenesis of both ER+ and ER− cancers through rewiring different subpathways."

Here, we evaluated pharmacological profiles of ethanol on the NMDA-induced increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ levels in cultured murine neocortical neurons. Methodology/Principal Findings In neurons exposed to glutamate or NMDA, a significant increase was seen in mitochondrial Ca2+ levels determined by Rhod-2 at concentrations of 0.1 to 100 µM. Further addition of 250 mM ethanol significantly inhibited the increase by glutamate and NMDA in Rhod-2 fluorescence, while similarly potent inhibition of the NMDA-induced increase was seen after exposure to ethanol at 50 to 250 mM in cultured neurons. Lentiviral overexpression of UCP2 significantly accelerated the increase by NMDA in Rhod-2 fluorescence in neurons, without affecting Fluo-3 fluorescence for intracellular Ca2+ levels. In neurons overexpressing UCP2, exposure to ethanol resulted in significantly more effective inhibition of the NMDA-induced increase in mitochondrial free Ca2+ levels than in those without UCP2 overexpression, despite a similarly efficient increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels irrespective of UCP2 overexpression. Overexpression of UCP2 significantly increased the number of dead cells in a manner prevented by ethanol in neurons exposed to glutamate. In HEK293 cells with NMDAR containing GluN2B subunit, more efficient inhibition was similarly induced by ethanol at 50 and 250 mM on the NMDA-induced increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ levels than in those with GluN2A subunit. Decreased protein levels of GluN2B, but not GluN2A, subunit were seen in immunoprecipitates with UCP2 from neurons with brief exposure to ethanol at concentrations over 50 mM. Conclusions/Significance Ethanol could inhibit the interaction between UCP2 and NMDAR channels to prevent the mitochondrial Ca2+ incorporation and cell death after NMDAR activation in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2057295602,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and other lentiviruses are capable of infecting non-dividing cells and, therefore, need to be imported into the nucleus before integration into the host cell chromatin. Transportin-SR2 (TRN-SR2, Transportin-3, TNPO3) is a cellular karyopherin implicated in nuclear import of HIV-1. A model in which TRN-SR2 imports the viral preintegration complex into the nucleus is supported by direct interaction between TRN-SR2 and HIV-1 integrase (IN). Residues in the C-terminal domain of HIV-1 IN that mediate binding to TRN-SR2 were recently delineated. As for most nuclear import cargoes, the driving force behind HIV-1 preintegration complex import is likely a gradient of the GDP- and GTP-bound forms of Ran, a small GTPase. In this study we offer biochemical and structural characterization of the interaction between TRN-SR2 and Ran. By size exclusion chromatography we demonstrate stable complex formation of TRN-SR2 and RanGTP in solution. Consistent with the behavior of normal nuclear import cargoes, HIV-1 IN is released from the complex with TRN-SR2 by RanGTP. Although in concentrated solutions TRN-SR2 by itself was predominantly present as a dimer, the TRN-SR2-RanGTP complex was significantly more compact. Further analysis supported a model wherein one monomer of TRN-SR2 is bound to one monomer of RanGTP. Finally, we present a homology model of the TRN-SR2-RanGTP complex that is in excellent agreement with the experimental small angle x-ray scattering data."
https://openalex.org/W1972353918,"To compare the incidence of complicated cholelithiasis in patients receiving ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/r)- containing antiretroviral therapy with those on other protease inhibitors (PIs).We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients who started either ritonavir-boosted ATV/r- or other PIs (ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir, unboosted fosamprenavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ritonavir-boosted darunavir) -containing antiretroviral therapy.The incidence of complicated cholelithiasis was determined in each group. Complicated cholelithiasis was defined as follows: 1) cholelithiasis complicated by cholecystitis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis or 2) symptomatic cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis which required invasive procedures such as cholecystomy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The effects of ATV/r were estimated by univariate and multivariate Cox hazards models as the primary exposure.Complicated cholelithiasis was diagnosed in 3 patients (2.23 per 1000 person-years) in the ATV/r group (n = 466), and 3 (1.64 per 1000 person-years) in the other PIs group (n = 776), respectively. The incidence was not statistically different in the two groups by log-rank test (P = 0.702). By univariate and multivariate analysis adjusted for age and body weight, ATV/r use was not associated with cholelithiasis. (HR = 1.365; 95% CI, 0.275-6.775; p = 0.704) (adjusted HR = 1.390; 95% CI, 0.276-7.017; p = 0.690). For the 3 patients who developed cholelithiasis in the ATV/r group, the time to the diagnosis of cholelithiasis was 18, 34, and 39 months, respectively.In this study, the incidence of complicated cholelithiasis was low and was not different between patients on ATV/r and those on other PIs. On the contrary to ATV/r-associated nephrolithiasis, the possible risk of cholelithiasis should not preclude the use of ATV/r."
https://openalex.org/W2032647352,"Male sexual behavior (MSB) is modulated by gonadal steroids, yet this relationship is highly variable across species and between individuals. A significant percentage (∼30%) of B6D2F1 hybrid male mice demonstrate MSB after long-term orchidectomy (herein after referred to as “maters”), providing an opportunity to examine the mechanisms that underlie individual differences in steroidal regulation of MSB. Use of gene expression arrays comparing maters and non-maters has provided a first pass look at the genetic underpinnings of steroid-independent MSB. Surprisingly, of the ∼500 genes in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) that differed between maters and non-maters, no steroid hormone or receptor genes were differentially expressed between the two groups. Interestingly, best known for their association with Alzheimer’s disease, amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) were elevated in maters. Increased levels of their protein products (APP and tau) in their non-pathological states have been implicated in cell survival, neuroprotection, and supporting synaptic integrity. Here we tested transgenic mice that overexpress tau and found facilitated mounting and intromission behavior after long-term orchidectomy relative to littermate controls. In addition, levels of synaptophysin and spinophilin, proteins generally enriched in synapses and dendritic spines respectively, were elevated in the MPOA of maters. Dendritic morphology was also assessed in Golgi-impregnated brains of orchidectomized B6D2F1 males, and hybrid maters exhibited greater dendritic spine density in MPOA neurons. In sum, we show for the first time that retention of MSB in the absence of steroids is correlated with morphological differences in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2011515624,"The psyllid Cacopsylla melanoneura is considered one of the vectors of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma mali’, the causal agent of apple proliferation disease. In Northern Italy, overwintered C. melanoneura adults reach apple and hawthorn around the end of January. Nymph development takes place between March and the end of April. The new generation adults migrate onto conifers around mid-June and come back to the host plant species after overwintering. In this study we investigated behavioural differences, genetic differentiation and gene flow between samples of C. melanoneura collected from the two different host plants. Further analyses were performed on some samples collected from conifers. To assess the ecological differences, host-switching experiments were conducted on C. melanoneura samples collected from apple and hawthorn. Furthermore, the genetic structure of the samples was studied by genotyping microsatellite markers. The examined C. melanoneura samples performed better on their native host plant species. This was verified in terms of oviposition and development of the offspring. Data resulting from microsatellite analysis indicated a low, but statistically significant difference between collected-from-apple and hawthorn samples. In conclusion, both ecological and genetic results indicate a differentiation between C. melanoneura samples associated with the two host plants."
https://openalex.org/W2006437940,"The ability of patchy populations to persist in human-dominated landscapes is often assessed using focal patch approaches, in which the local occurrence or abundance of a species is related to the properties of individual patches and the surrounding landscape context. However, useful additional insights could probably be gained through broader, mosaic-level approaches, whereby whole land mosaics with contrasting patch-network and matrix characteristics are the units of investigation. In this study we addressed this issue, analysing how the southern water vole (Arvicola sapidus) responds to variables describing patch-network and matrix properties within replicated Mediterranean farmland mosaics, across a gradient of agricultural intensification. Patch-network characteristics had a dominant effect, with the total amount of habitat positively influencing both the occurrence of water voles and the proportion of area occupied in land mosaics. The proportions of patches and area occupied by the species were positively influenced by mean patch size, and negatively so by patch isolation. Matrix effects were weak, although there was a tendency for a higher proportion of occupied patches in more intensive, irrigated agricultural landscapes, particularly during the dry season. In terms of conservation, results suggest that water voles may be able to cope well with, or even be favoured by, the on-going expansion of irrigated agriculture in Mediterranean dry-lands, provided that a number of patches of wet herbaceous vegetation are maintained within the farmland mosaic. Overall, our study suggests that the mosaic-level approach may provide a useful framework to understand the responses of patchy populations to land use change."
https://openalex.org/W2012329566,"Introduction Glucocorticoids are commonly used as therapeutic agents in many acute and chronic inflammatory and auto-immune diseases. The current study investigated the effects of methylprednisolone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) on aortic distensibility and vascular resistance in lipopolysaccharide-induced chronic inflammation in male Wistar rats. Methods Chronic inflammation was induced by implanting a subcutaneous slow-release ALZET osmotic pump (1 mg kg−1 day−1 lipopolysaccharide) for either 2 or 4 weeks. Arterial wave transit time (τ) was derived to describe the elastic properties of aortas using the impulse response function of the filtered aortic input impedance spectra. Results Long-term lipopolysaccharide challenge enhanced the expression of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in the aortas. Lipopolysaccharide also upregulated the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase to produce high levels of nitric oxide (NO), which resulted in vasodilation, as evidenced by the fall in total peripheral resistance (Rp). However, lipopolysaccharide challenge did not influence the elastic properties of aortas, as shown by the unaltered τ. The NO-mediated vascular relaxation may counterbalance the AGEs-induced arterial stiffening so that the aortic distensibility remained unaltered. Treating lipopolysaccharide-challenged rats with methylprednisolone prevented peripheral vasodilation because of its ability to increase Rp. However, methylprednisolone produced an increase in aorta stiffness, as manifested by the significant decline in τ. The diminished aortic distensibility by methylprednisolone paralleled a significant reduction in NO plasma levels, in the absence of any significant changes in AGEs content. Conclusion Methylprednisolone stiffens aortas and elastic arteries in lipopolysaccharide-induced chronic inflammation in rats, for NO activity may be dominant as a counteraction of AGEs."
https://openalex.org/W2071570032,"Ricin is a potent toxin found in the beans of Ricinus communis and is often lethal for animals and humans when aerosolized or injected and causes significant morbidity and occasional death when ingested. Ricin has been proposed as a bioweapon because of its lethal properties, environmental stability, and accessibility. In oral intoxication, the process by which the toxin transits across intestinal mucosa is not completely understood. To address this question, we assessed the impact of ricin on the gastrointestinal tract and organs of mice after dissemination of toxin from the gut. We first showed that ricin adhered in a specific pattern to human small bowel intestinal sections, the site within the mouse gut in which a variable degree of damage has been reported by others. We then monitored the movement of ricin across polarized human HCT-8 intestinal monolayers grown in transwell inserts and in HCT-8 cell organoids. We observed that, in both systems, ricin trafficked through the cells without apparent damage until 24 hours post intoxication. We delivered a lethal dose of purified fluorescently-labeled ricin to mice by oral gavage and followed transit of the toxin from the gastrointestinal tracts to the internal organs by in vivo imaging of whole animals over time and ex vivo imaging of organs at various time points. In addition, we harvested organs from unlabeled ricin-gavaged mice and assessed them for the presence of ricin and for histological damage. Finally, we compared serum chemistry values from buffer-treated versus ricin-intoxicated animals. We conclude that ricin transverses human intestinal cells and mouse intestinal cells in situ prior to any indication of enterocyte damage and that ricin rapidly reaches the kidneys of intoxicated mice. We also propose that mice intoxicated orally with ricin likely die from distributive shock."
https://openalex.org/W2025322593,"In this paper, we describe a simple taxonomic approach for clinical data mining elaborated by Marczewski and Steinhaus (M-S), whose performance equals the advanced statistical methodology known as the expectation-maximization (E-M) algorithm. We tested these two methods on a cohort of ischemic stroke patients. The comparison of both methods revealed strong agreement. Direct agreement between M-S and E-M classifications reached 83%, while Cohen’s coefficient of agreement was κ = 0.766(P < 0.0001). The statistical analysis conducted and the outcomes obtained in this paper revealed novel clinical patterns in ischemic stroke patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of Marczewski-Steinhaus’ taxonomic approach as a tool for the detection of novel patterns of data in ischemic stroke patients and the prediction of disease outcome. In terms of the identification of fairly frequent types of stroke patients using their age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and diabetes mellitus (DM) status, when dealing with rough characteristics of patients, four particular types of patients are recognized, which cannot be identified by means of routine clinical methods. Following the obtained taxonomical outcomes, the strong correlation between the health status at moment of admission to emergency department (ED) and the subsequent recovery of patients is established. Moreover, popularization and simplification of the ideas of advanced mathematicians may provide an unconventional explorative platform for clinical problems."
