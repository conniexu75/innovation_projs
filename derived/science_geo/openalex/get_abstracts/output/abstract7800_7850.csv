https://openalex.org/W1577311545,"Studies in intact cells have shown the following processing reaction to occur during Asn-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis (M, mannose; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine): Formula: (See Text) We have identified a rat liver Golgi enzyme which catalyzes this reaction in vitro. This alpha-mannosidase has been purified 3,000 to 6,000-fold by subcellular fractionation, Triton X-100 solubilization, and ion exchange and hydroxylapatite chromatography. The purified enzyme has a pH optimum between 6.0 and 6.5 and a Km between 17 and 100 microM for a processing intermediate. The enzyme shows specificity for alpha 1,2-linked mannose residues. Structural analysis of the in vitro reaction products reveal that specific intermediates are formed in the conversion of the (Man)9GlcNAc oligosaccharide to the (Man)5GlcNAc oligosaccharide. Heat inactivation studies are consistent with the possibility that one enzyme activity is responsible for this conversion. The alpha 1,2-specific mannosidase described here appears to be distinct from two other rat liver Golgi alpha-mannosidase activities based on differential substrate specificity, inhibitor susceptibility, and detergent extractability."

https://openalex.org/W1604635179,"Using stopped flow light scattering, we show that assembly of fibrin following activation with non-rate-limiting amounts of thrombin or reptilase occurs in two steps, of which the first is end-to-end polymerization of fibrin monomers to protofibrils and the second is lateral association of protofibrils to fibers, in agreement with Ferry's original proposal. Polymerization is found to proceed as a bimolecular association of bifunctional monomers; the overall rate varies as the inverse first power of the concentration; end-to-end association of two monomers, of a monomer and an oligomer, and of two oligomers occurs with the same rate constant. The value of the rate constant is 8.2 C 10(5) M-1 s-1 in 0.5 M NaCl, is three times larger in 0.1 M NaCl (0.05 M Tris, pH 7.4), and is the same following activation by reptilase and by thrombin. The onset of growth of fibers from protofibrils takes 12 times longer in 0.5 than in 0.1 M salt, i.e. thick fibers (coarse gels) form from short protofibrils, and thin fibers (fine gels) form from longer protofibrils. Jumps of salt concentration at times when protofibrils, but not fibers, have formed result in immediate growth of thick fibers at low salt from long protofibrils formed at high salt. The rate of fiber growth in these experiments varies as the inverse first power of the concentration. 3the instant of gelation (formation of a network of fibers) falls in the later half of the time during which the scattering rises due to fiber growth; the rise of gel rigidity after gelation is found to continue beyond the end of this period. Jumps from low to high salt result in retention of whatever fibers have formed at low salt and a very small additional increase of the scattering due to further fiber growth at high salt. From a variety of evidence, we conclude that the properties of fibrin are determined by kinetics and not equilibria of assembly steps. Results obtained here agree with the following scheme of fibrin assembly: monomers polymerize to protofibrils; long protofibrils associate laterally to fibers; occasionally a long protofibril associates with two different fibers to form an interfiber connection; fiber growth does not reverse to yield stabler, more compact, structures and terminates in formation of a network of fibers. The typical delay of fiber growth is the time during which protofibrils form from monomers. Measurements at rate-limiting concentrations of thrombin have allowed estimation of turnover rates of fibrinopeptides that agree with kinetic parameters obtained with direct assay of fibrinopeptide. Release of fibrinopeptide B causes more rapid fiber formation. Addition of thrombin after activation by reptilase, at a time when protofibrils, but not fibers, have formed, is followed rapidly by fiber formation; this proves that thrombin readily removes fibrinopeptide B from protofibrils. On the basis of these new results and earlier work (in particular, Blomback, B., Hessel, B., Hogg, D., and Therkildsen, L..."

https://openalex.org/W1529631720,"Rabbit ileum strips were functionally skinned by exposure to staphylococcal alpha-toxin. Incubation of the strips in the ATP analog ATP gamma S or [35S]ATP gamma S in the presence of Ca2+ (but not in the absence of Ca2+) resulted in a maximal Ca2+-insensitive activated tension that persisted following removal of Ca2+. Correlated with this tension was 35S-labeling of the 20,000-dalton myosin light chain, LC20, that persisted even after removal of Ca2+. Tension in these strips partially relaxed when exposed to ATP (alpha,beta-methylene). In contrast, alpha-toxin-treated strips exposed to ATP or [gamma-32P]ATP showed Ca2+-sensitive, reversible activated tension and reversible 32P-labeling of the LC20. These results are consistent with a currently proposed model of Ca2+ control of smooth muscle contraction involving a myosin light chain kinase-phosphatase system."
https://openalex.org/W1515733752,"Upon differential centrifugation of rat liver homogenate, the enzyme acyl-CoA:dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.42) was found to be localized in the light mitochondrial (L) fraction which is enriched with lysosomes and peroxisomes. Peroxisomes were separated from lysosomes in a density gradient centrifugation using rats which were injected with Triton WR 1339. By comparing the enzyme distribution with the distribution of different marker enzymes, it was concluded that dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase is primarily localized in rat liver peroxisomes (microbodies). Similarly, the enzyme acyl dihydroxyacetone-phosphate:NADPH oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.1.101) was shown to be enriched in the peroxisomal fraction, although a portion of this reductase is also present in the microsomal fraction."

https://openalex.org/W78111501,"Two species of alpha-polymerase with very similar catalytic properties have been purified to near homogeneity from a soluble protein fraction of mouse myeloma. Sedimentation analysis in 0.5 M salt-containing glycerol gradients indicated that both species had a native Mr of about 190,000. Each species contained nonidentical subunits with apparent molecular weights of about 47,000 and 54,000. Subunits of Mr = approximately 50,000 had been found previously in calf thymus alpha-polymerase (Holmes, A. M., Hesslewood, I. P., and Johnston, I. R. (1974) Eur. J. Biochem. 43, 487-499; (1976) Eur. J. Biochem. 62, 229-235). Tryptic peptide mapping failed to reveal primary structure homology between the subunits of the two enzymes. Thus, the two alpha-polymerases are clearly different species. These two enzymes are further distinguished by the fact that one of them has associated exonuclease activities. One activity degraded single-stranded DNA to mononucleotides in the 3' leads to 5' direction and acted distributively. The other exonuclease activity also degraded single-stranded DNA to mononucleotides, but this degradation was in the 5' leads to 3' direction in a processive fashion. Both exonuclease activities co-migrated with the polymerase activity during the final purification step of polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis, which yielded the essentially homogenous alpha-polymerase, and also during sedimentation of the purified enzyme through a high salt glycerol gradient."

https://openalex.org/W147014518,"22Na+ uptake measurements were conducted on the dog kidney cell line, MDCK, to determine the mechanism of ouabain-insensitive sodium transport. The radioisotope was found to be taken up into monolayer cultures via an ATP-independent, saturable process (Km = 40 mM). The presence of sodium on the opposite side of the membrane gave rise to a transstimulation of the 22Na+ flux. Studies utilizing potassium and valinomycin suggested that the transport system was insensitive to changes in the membrane potential. Replacement of chloride in the assay buffer with other anions did not decrease the rate of 22Na+ uptake at 14 mMNa+, but bicarbonate and acetate were stimulatory. Potassium and rubidium increased the rate of 22Na+ influx (Ka = 13mM with 14 mM NaCL in the medium). Lithium (Ki = 7.5mM) and amiloride (Ki = 1.7 x 10(-5) M) were competitive and partially (or mixed) competitive inhibitors, respectively. The data are consistent with a mechanism of sodium uptake that includes a carrier(s) capable of catalyzing net sodium uptake and sodium-sodium exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1581905009,"The changes in protein composition and cell surface proteins that occur during the adipocyte conversion of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were monitored by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis folowing incubation of cells with [35S]methionine for periods of 3 and 24 h. Alterations in the biosynthesis of more than 30 cytoplasmic proteins, 9 non-histone, chromosome-associated proteins, and 24 membrane proteins, were detected. Although the methodological limitations of the electrophoretic systems employed result in an underestimate of the total number of differences, the alterations observed exceed the enzyme changes known to occur during differentiation of these cells. One major alteration occurring during differentiation is a decrease in the content of a protein whose position following two-dimensional electrophoresis tentatively identified it as actin. A fall in actin content accompanying adipocyte conversion was confirmed by direct analysis of the DNase 1 inhibitory activity in homogenates prepared from cells during the course of differentiation. Studies of cell surface proteins by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination reveal a number of changes during differentiation including an increase in a polypeptide(s) in the molecular weight range of 16,500 to 18,500, a decrease in at least four proteins of molecular weights greater than 100,000, and in a protein of molecular weight 95,000."
https://openalex.org/W1574301919,"alpha-Ketoisocaproate (ketoleucine) is shown to be metabolized to ketone bodies rapidly by isolated rat liver cells. Acetoacetate is the major end product and maximum rates were observed with 2 mM substrate. Studies with 2-tetradecylglycidic acid (an inhibitor of long chain fatty acid oxidation) showed that ketogenesis from alpha-ketoisocaproate and from endogenous fatty acids were additive. With alpha-ketoisocaproate present as soole substrate at 2 mM, leucine production was less than 10% of alpha-ketoisocaproate uptake and only 30% of the acetyl coenzyme A generated was oxidized in the citric acid cycle. Metabolism of alpha-ketoisocaproate was inhibited by fatty acids, alpha-ketoisovalerate, alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate, and pyruvate. Oxidation of acetyl-CoA generated from alpha-ketoisocaproate was suppressed by oleate and by pyruvate, but was enhanced by lactate. Metabolism between the different branched chain alpha-ketoacids was mutually competitive. When alpha-ketoisocaproate (2 mM) was added in the presence of high pyruvate concentrations (4.4 mM), flux through pyruvate dehydrogenase was decreased, and the proportion of total pyruvate dehydrogenase in the active form (PDHa) also fell. With lactate as substrate, PDHa was only 25% of total activity and was little affected by addition of alpha-ketoisocaproate. These data suggest that enhanced oxidation of acetyl-CoA from alpha-ketoisocaproate by lactate addition is caused by a low activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase combined with increased flux through the citric acid cycle in response to the energy requirements for gluconeogenesis. However, acetyl-CoA generation from pyruvate is apparently insufficiently inhibited by alpha-ketoisocaproate to cause a diversion of acetyl-CoA formed during alpha-ketoisocaproate metabolism from ketone body formation to oxidation in the citric acid cycle. Measurements of the cell contents of CoASH, acetyl-CoA, acid-soluble acyl-CoA, and acid-insoluble fatty acyl-CoA indicated that when the branched chain alpha-ketoacids were added as sole substrate, their oxidation was limited at a step distal to the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase. Acid-soluble acyl-CoA derivatives were depleted after oleate addition in the presence of alpha-ketoisocaproate, suggesting an inhibition of the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase by the elevation of the mitochondrial NADH/NAD+ ratio observed during fatty acid oxidation. This effect was not observed in the presence of oleate and 2-tetradecylglycidic acid."

https://openalex.org/W1569498480,"The iso forms of gizzard actin present during chicken embryogenesis were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis. During chick embryogenesis there are conspicuous changes in the content of the iso forms of actin. Gizzards from 8-day-old embryos contain almost exclusively beta-actin. After 8 days of embryonic age, there is a continuous increase in the amount of gamma-actin and an apparent decrease in the amount of beta-actin. These changes in the content of beta- and gamma-actin in gizzard tissue are paralleled by changes in the content of the corresponding mRNAs, as detected by the ability of the RNAs to direct the synthesis of these proteins in micrococcal nuclease-digested reticulocyte lysates. The correlation of the in vivo and in vitro experiments indicates that during chick embryogenesis there is a differential expression of the genes coding for the iso forms of gizzard actin and that this expression is controlled at the transcriptional level."

This rapid and accurate technique permits the quantitation of each of the major neutral glycolipids from individual blood samples. A correlation between the P blood group and the relative quantities of neutral glycosphingolipids is demonstrated. Erythrocytes from P1 individuals are shown to contain more globotriaosylceramide and less lactosylceramide than do erythrocytes from P2 individuals. The results of these experiments suggest the existence of a new phenotype in the P blood group system, and have further implications regarding the biosynthesis of the P blood group glycosphingolipids."

The presence of neutral detergents, Triton X-100, or Nonidet P40 stabilized thymidylate synthetase during purification. Analytical electrophoresis of the enzyme treated with an excess of 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate showed the presence of two forms of thymidylate synthetase--5-fluorodeoxyuridylate.5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate complex, indicating that there are two binding sites for 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate present on the enzyme molecule. Molecular weight of native thymidylate synthetase was found to be 75,000, whereas that for the monomer was 38,500."
https://openalex.org/W1500354281,"Guanidoacetate methyltransferase has been purified about 140-fold from pig liver. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme showed four protein bands, each of which is associated with guanidoacetate methyltransferase activity. During gel electrophoresis at pH 3 in 8 M urea, guanidoacetate methyltransferase migrated as a single component. The molecular weight of the purified guanidoacetate methyltransferase was estimated to be 31,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, which also showed only one protein component with guanidoacetate methyltransferase activity. This molecular weight is in agreement with that estimated by Sephadex G-75 chromatography.

The carbodiimide reagent, which introduces no atoms between the amino acid side chains being joined, seemed to give the same result as did the longer di-imidate cross-linking reagents. When conditions were optimized for the production of of H1-containing dimers, the total yield of H1-core histone heterodimers was nearly equal to the yield of H1 homodimers. Naturally occurring H1 dimers and cross-linked heterodimers of high mobility group proteins 14 and 17 with H1 and core histones were also observed."
https://openalex.org/W1556881843,"We have carried out a two-dimensional gel analysis of the actin system of Dictyostelium discoideum. Our results show that on the basis of isoelectric focusing, there is a single major [35S]methionine-labeled species which corresponds both to the actin purified by Uyemura et al. (Uyemura, D., Brown, S.S., and Spudich, J.A. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 9088-9095) and to the Coomassie Blue staining species seen in whole cell lysates of the organism. We also detect a minor labeled actin species, x, which has no corresponding Coomassie Blue staining counterpart. This species turns over much more rapidly than the major actin and has one more positive charge. It is not labeled with [3H]acetate, whereas the major actin is. When D. discoideum RNA is added to a mRNA-dependent rabbit reticulocyte lysate protein translation system, only one major actin is seen, and this species corresponds to the major actin observed in vivo. If endogenous acetyl coenzyme A is removed from the translation system, a second major actin appears corresponding in position to x. These results indicate that in D. discoideum, there is present a single major actin species in addition to a small amount of a rapidly turning over actin which is a nonacetylated form of the major actin. Additional experiments examining these actins through the developmental cycle of the organism show no consistent differences with the results obtained using vegetative cells."

https://openalex.org/W1487184957,"A hybrid protein of ricin and the enzymatically active fragment A of diphtheria toxin (toxin A) has been synthesized and purified. The diphtheria toxin A fragment of the hybrid protein is shown to enter the cytosol compartment of HeLa cells, its presence assayed by the fall of intracellular elongation factor II (EF-2) and the rise of ADP-ribosylated EF-2. Hybrid entrance to HeLa cells is blocked by lactose which blocks receptor-mediated entry of ricin but not by NH4Cl which blocks the transport of diphtheria toxin. It is concluded that the diphtheria toxin fragment A moiety of the hybrid enters the cell cytosol via the ricin receptor-mediated transport system. The kinetics of intracellular ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 by diphtheria toxin have also been studied. Ribosylation is preceded by a toxin dose-dependent lag period. The data suggest that the time constant responsible for the lag period is in the transport step. Models consistent with these data are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1549790007,"Abstract Changes in a posttranslational modification of tubulin, which accompany differentiation, have been studied in neuroblastoma-glioma hybrid cultured cells. The modification consists of the reversible enzymatic addition of a tyrosine to the COOH terminus of the alpha chain. Cytoplasmic tubulin purified from undifferentiated cells resembled that from adult mammalian brain in that half was in a form which can not accept tyrosine; of the remainder, which is a substrate for tubulin-tyrosine ligase, a higher proportion had COOH-terminal tyrosine. In the tubulin from differentiated cells, in which there had been extensive assembly of axonal microtubules from a preformed pool of subunits, the nonsubstrate tubulin was almost entirely replaced by the species with COOH-terminal tyrosine. In living cells, in the absence of protein synthesis, there was fixation of labeled tyrosine into cytoplasmic alpha chains which was extensive enough to be consistent with turnover, during the course of an hour, of the pre-existing COOH-terminal tyrosine. The alpha chain in the particulate fraction of the cells was comparably labeled, along with some unidentified low molecular weight components."

The molecular weight of the intact enzyme and that of the enzyme dissociated in 6 M GuHCl, determined by sedimentation equilibrium studies, were 280,000 +/- 10,000 and 90,000 +/- 5,000, respectively. Comparable values were obtained using the S20,w value and the D20,w values in Svedberg's equation. The D20,w values were determined by laser light-scattering measurements. Active enzyme centrifugation showed that the monomer is an active species. A quantitative re-evaluation of the prosthetic groups present (FAD, heme, and molybdenum) was also made and was consistent with the conclusion that the active monomer contains three subunits as previously deduced by Solomonson et al. ((1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 4120). Electron micrographs showed images which corresponded to three subunits, supporting the data obtained by hydrodynamic studies. The enzyme is not cigar-shaped, as previously surmised, but has a roughly globular structure."
https://openalex.org/W2128369627,"In medium with low nitrogen content, vegetative strains of the unicellular biflagellate alga Chlamydomonas reinhardi form gametes. Mating type plus (mt+) and mating type minus (mt-) gametes adhere via their flagella to give aggregates in which the gametes eventually fuse to form zygotes. A quantitative assay has now been developed which measures aggregation and fusion by use of a Coulter electronic particle counter to determine loss of single gametes as they form aggregates in suspension. Determination of the rate and extent of cell fusion by microscopy agrees with the results obtained with the more rapid and convenient Coulter counter assay. By use of the assay it was found that aggregation and fusion occur at the same rate and to the same extent at 12 degrees C and 25 degrees C. Flagella from one of the mating types can specifically substitute for the corresponding live gametes; more than 70% of the gametes were aggregated and the extent of aggregation was proportional to the number of flagella added, until the ratio of cells to flagella exceeded 2. At 22 degrees C, in the flagella/gamete mixtures, adhesion was complete in less than 5 min, but at 5 to 10 min, gametes began to de-adhere from the clusters and, depending on the number of flagella added, essentially all of the gametes detached from the aggregates in 10 to 50 min. The gametes in such mixtures were fully competent to aggregate again, whereas the flagella recovered from such mixtures were shown by use of a radioactive flagella-binding assay to be inactive with fresh gametes. Inactivation of the flagella was temperature-dependent, was not catalyzed by soluble factors, and required adhesion of flagella to gametes of the opposite mating type. The potential physiological functions of the de-adhesion process are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1603397682,"In this report, we introduce the use of DNA-cellulose chromatography for evaluating the strength of binding of histones to DNA under a variety of conditions. We have found that histones added directly to DNA-cellulose at physiological salt concentrations bind relatively weakly, with all histones eluting together at about 0.5 M NaCl when a salt gradient is applied. However, much tighter binding of the four nucleosomal histones to DNA-cellulose is obtained if gradual histone-DNA reconstitution conditions are used. In this case, the binding of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 to DNA-cellulose closely resembles their binding to native chromatin. The nativeness of the binding is indicated both by the distinctive sodium chloride elution profile of these histones from DNA-cellulose and by their relative resistance to trypsin digestion when DNA-bound. The binding to DNA-cellulose of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, which have had the first 20 to 30 amino acid residues removed from their NH2 termini, is indistinguishable from the binding to DNA-cellulose of the same intact histones, as judged by their salt elution profile. Thus, even though the NH2 termini contain 40 to 50% of the positively charged amino acid residues (thought to interact with the DNA backbone), a major contribution to the DNA binding comes from the remainder of the histone molecule. Finally, we have discovered that histones can form a nucleosome-like complex on single-stranded DNA. The same complex does not appear to form on RNA. Histones H3 and H4 play a predominant role in organizing this histone complex on single-stranded DNA, as they do on double-stranded DNA in normal nucleosomes. We suggest that, in the cell nucleus, nucleosomal structures may form transiently on single strands of DNA, as DNA and RNA polymerases traverse DNA packaged by histones."

The receptor, which sediments at 3.7 S in 0.3 M KCl, was shown to aggregate to species sedimenting at approximately 5 S in 0.06 M KCl and 6.2 S in the absence of KCl. Depending on the preparation and route used to label the receptor with 1,25-dihydroxy(/sup 3/H)vitamin D/sub 3/, larger aggregates which sedimented to the bottom of sucrose gradients were also seen. Aggregated receptor like the 3.7 S species specifically binds 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D/sub 3/ with high affinity and low capacity. In the absence of KCl, aggregated receptor eluted as a heterogeneous peak near the void volume of a Sephadex G-200 column. In 0.3 M KCl, receptor eluted from the same column with an apparent molecular weight of 60,000. Aggregated receptor prepared from G-200 columns in the absence of KCl could be converted back to a 3.7 S species by adding KCl to a concentration of 0.3 M.

The predominant form of the NGF receptor has a Stokes radius of 71 A, a partial specific volume of 0.74 ml/g, a sedimentation coefficient of 4.3 S, and a frictional ratio of 1.8.

https://openalex.org/W1608571122,"In all previous kinetics studies of calf liver CTP synthetase, simple Michaelis-Menten hyperbolic plots were obtained. In this study it was shown that calf liver CTP synthetase could generate sigmoidal kinetic plots as a function of the substrate UTP when in the presence of the product of the reaction, CTP. The Hill number was estimated to be 2.8. The enzyme did not generate sigmoidal plots as a function of the other substrates (L-glutamine and ATP) either in the presence or absence of CTP. Thus, CTP apparently induced changes in the liver enzyme which altered the binding of UTP to the enzyme by acting at a site distinct from the UTP binding site (allosteric site). This concept was further strengthened by the fact that 3-deazaUTP, a known competitive inhibitor of the liver enzyme, did not induce sigmoidal kinetic plots. It was also shown that CTP had no effect upon the dimerization of the enzyme, thus ruling out monomer to dimer transitions as a potential mechanism for the observed sigmoidal kinetics."

A purification of about 90fold based on total soluble activity was achieved, with an overall yield of 40%. However, the initial solubilization is accompanied by the loss of the secondary portion of the U/S curve observed with intact microsomes. The enzyme requires detergent during the purification procedure to remain “soluble,” and is strongly activated by the inclusion of Triton X-100 at concentrations above its critical micelle concentration in the assay mixture. In addition a preference for micelles has been inferred based on discontinuities in the V/S curves relative to the measured critical micelle concentration of the substrates in the absence of Triton X-100. Kinetic parameters calculated on the basis of micelle-specific activity indicated that P-hydroxyacyl-CoA substrates possessing even-numbered alkyl chains from 14 to 20 carbon atoms differed little in V,,, but had progressively larger K,, as the chain length increased.

https://openalex.org/W1543005595,"Plasma membrane vesicles containing adenylate cyclase and beta-adrenergic receptors were prepared from 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells by a procedure involving the use of concanavalin A to stabilize the plasma membrane to fragmentation and vesiculation upon cell lysis. Treatment of cells with concanavalin A causes these plasma membrane markers to sediment to a higher density of sucrose and in a narrower band than observed with untreated cells. Upon treatment of the heavy membrane fragments with alpha-methylmannoside to remove bound concanavalin A, the enzyme markers again sediment a lower densities of sucrose. This reversible change in sedimentation behavior has been used to obtain preparations of plasma membranes enriched 14- to 21-fold (recovery 25%) in adenylate cyclase activity and about 12-fold (recovery 16%) in beta-adrenergic receptor density, as compared to lysates. The adenylate cyclase of purified membranes responded normally to isoproterenol and prostaglandin E1. Experiments with S49 and YAC mouse lymphoma cells and human skin fibroblasts indicate that this procedure may be adaptable to the isolation of plasma membranes from a variety of cultured cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1570557409,"Long chain fatty acyl coenzyme A ligase (EC 6.2.1.3) purified from rat liver mitochondria has been characterized with respect to several kinetic parameters. Many of the kinetic properties of the mitochondrial enzyme are similar to those of the purified microsomal enzyme with respect to palmitoyl-CoA formation, but there are distinct differences. The fatty acid and nucleotide specificities of the mitochondrial enzyme are similar to those of the microsomal enzyme, as are the apparent Km values for ATP and coenzyme A. On the other hand, the mitochondrial enzyme differs from the microsomal enzyme in that it has a lower pH optimum, is different in molecular weight, and does not show simple saturation kinetics with palmitate as substrate. Of particular interest is the evidence presented which indicates that the mitochondrial long chain fatty acyl-CoA ligase, unlike short and medium chain ligases, does not utilize an acyladenylate as an intermediate in the formation of fatty acyl-CoA."
https://openalex.org/W1553613954,"beta-Br-ethylamine is both a substrate and an irreversible inhibitor of amine oxidase from Aspergillus niger. The enzyme catalyzes the nonoxidative elimination of HBr from beta-Br-ethylamine to form acetaldehyde. beta-Br-ethylamine meets several criteria for an irreversible substrate analog or suicide inhibitor. 1) It inactivates the oxidized enzyme, but not the reduced enzyme. 2) The Michaelis constant for beta-Br-ethylamine in the elimination reaction showed a similar magnitude to that of the related constant found when the haloamine acted as an inhibitor. 3) The enzyme was protected from the inactivation by the co-existence of the substrate. 4) Inactivation with beta-Br-[14C]ethylamine resulted in the incorporation of radioactivity corresponding to 1 mol of the label/mol of the monomeric unit of the enzyme and a decrease of 1 mol of the -SH group. 5) Inactivation was accompanied by the formation of a new absorption peak at 320 nm which was bleached by addition of NaBH4."

https://openalex.org/W1523863063,"Abstract Saturable, high affinity binding of tritium-labeled saxitoxin ([3H]STX) to axolemma-enriched membranes from white matter of bovine brain was identified. The apparent [3H]STX equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd*) was strongly affected by the cationic environment:choline had little effect; cesium increased the mammalian axolemma Kd* in a simple competitive manner. In contrast, sodium more dramatically increased the Kd*--this effect was highly cooperative between 75 and 200 mM sodium (Hill coefficient of 2.85). The cooperativity is most pronounced at the normally expected [sodium] external to the axon in the mammalian central nervous system. This sodium-specific cooperative modification of the STX binding site (the hypothetical ion selectivity filter of the axonal Na+ gate) may be indicative of some as yet undefined regulatory mechanism of the Na+ gate in mammalian myelinated axons."

https://openalex.org/W1547120511,"Chicken reticulocyte chromatin can be reassembled from its separated constituents, viz. DNA, H1 plus H5, core histones, and non-histone proteins, to yield a product resembling the native starting material by a series of structural criteria. In particular, it possesses nucleosomes separated by spacer regions; the particles contain DNA with a unit length of approximately 200 base pairs. The recovery of the correctly reassembled product depends critically on the annealing conditions: the components are initially mixed in 2 M NaCl and 5 M urea, and it seems to be important to remove urea at a relatively high salt concentration. The results suggest that the characteristic chromatin structure is formed only when core histones bind to DNA in their native conformation and are followed by the addition of H1 and H5 to the spacer regions."
