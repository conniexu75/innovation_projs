https://openalex.org/W1963608909,SINCE lymphocytes appear to play a crucial part in the homograft reaction it seemed of interest to examine the behaviour of homografts in recipients subjected to chronic lymphocyte depletion by: (a) drainage of lymph through a thoracic duct fistula; (b) repeated administration of a hetero-specific antilymphocytic serum; (c) a combination of these procedures.

https://openalex.org/W2018571354,"INVESTIGATIONS of the hydroxylating activity of A. niger have been carried out mainly in connexion with the metabolism of the phenoxy- and naphthyloxy-alkyl-carboxylic acids1,2, at least in part because of the importance of these compounds as herbicides. We have been examining the action of this organism, using van Tiegh strain, on various benzenoid compounds, and since our results for the hydroxylation of phenoxyacetic acid differ fundamentally from those obtained with van Tiegh (Mulder) strain1, we wish to report our findings for both this compound and the related aromatic ether, anisole."

https://openalex.org/W2041439050,"Nieschulz1 and Alexander2 independently showed that horsesickness virus multiplies in the brains of Swiss albino mice. Alexander3 reported later the successful cultivation of mouse-adapted horsesiekness virus in the brains of guinea pigs, rats and other rodents. He also succeeded in cultivating a mouse-adapted strain of virus in embryonated hen's eggs, in which multiplication of the virus occurred in the brain of the embryo without producing any specific mortality4. McIntosh5 propagated viscero-tropic horsesickness virus strains in 8-day-old embryonated hen's eggs at an optimum temperature of 32° C. Embryo mortality occurred regularly during the initial passages."

https://openalex.org/W2986938586,"IT would be a pity if recent correspondence1,2 were to give the impression that 14-MeV neutrons are known to be valueless for radiotherapy on account of their low linear energy transfer. To my knowledge no measurements of the oxygen enhancement ratio of mammalian cells irradiated by 14-MeV neutrons have yet been published. An estimate of the value of this irradiation in treating tumours containing anoxic foci is therefore a matter of speculation."

We now report that cell-free lysates of A. vinelandii, prepared by adding A22 phage6 to cultures of the bacteria during early exponential growth, incorporate nitrogen gas."

We have been examining the effects of the addition of serum from guinea pigs suffering from experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) serum on the metabolic activity of slices of rat brain tissue, as measured by in vitro techniques. Other workers have shown that serum from affected animals can cause tissue breakdown in tissue cultures3,4, and the results of our experiments, in which we measure net free fatty acid output of brain slices incubated in a balanced medium are consistent with the hypothesis that EAE serum causes a degenerative change."

https://openalex.org/W2023484510,"Andrewes and Horstmann1 grouped rabies virus as ether resistant, based on reports of other investigators2,3. During a recent investigation in this laboratory, strains of arctic rabies virus lost 95–97 per cent of their infectivity following exposure to 20 per cent ether at 4° C for 16 h. This observed reduction in infectivity and the variations in reported methods for determining the effect of ether on rabies virus led to investigations comparing the action of ether on different strains of rabies virus."
