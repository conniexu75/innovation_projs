https://openalex.org/W2061776382,"Ghrelin, a peptide purified from the stomach, is an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R) and potently stimulates growth hormone release from the pituitary. Ghrelin is modified with an n-octanoyl group at Ser3. This modification is essential for the activity of ghrelin. Previously, it was not known whether other ligands for GHS-R existed. Here, we report the purification of the second endogenous ligand for GHS-R from rat stomach. This ligand, named des-Gln14-ghrelin, is a 27-amino acid peptide, whose sequence is identical to ghrelin except for one glutamine. Southern blotting analysis under low hybridization conditions indicates that no homologue for ghrelin exists in rat genomic DNA. Furthermore, genomic sequencing and cDNA analysis indicate that des-Gln14-ghrelin is not encoded by a gene distinct from ghrelin but is encoded by an mRNA created by alternative splicing of the ghrelin gene. This is the first example of a novel mechanism that produces peptide multiplicity. Des-Gln14-ghrelin has an n-octanoyl modification at Ser3 like ghrelin, which is also essential for its activity. Des-Gln14-ghrelin-stimulated growth hormone releases when injected into rats. Thus, growth hormone release is regulated by two gastric peptides, ghrelin and des-Gln14-ghrelin.

Schwartz J. Smit L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 187-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). GH does not directly stimulate growth but induces insulin-like growth factor-I production in liver. Increased insulin-like growth factor-I stimulates postnatal growth. GH also directly activates several tissues to control metabolism, to regulate water and electrolyte balances, and to control cell growth and differentiation. GH is released from the pituitary gland in a pulsatile manner, regulated by episodic changes in two hypothalamic hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone and somatostatin. GH secretion is stimulated by growth hormone releasing hormone and inhibited by somatostatin (2.Muller E.E. Locatelli V. Cocchi D. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 511-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). In 1976, it was revealed that modified opioid peptides had low growth hormone secretory activity (3.Bowers C.Y. Cell. Mol. Life.

Since then, many efforts have been made to develop and improve potential synthetic growth hormone secretagogues (GHSs) (5.Smith R.G. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Howard A.D. Feighner S.D. Cheng K.

These GHSs act on the pituitary and hypothalamus to release GH, not through the growth hormone releasing hormone receptor but through an orphan receptor, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R) (8.Howard A.D. Feighner S.D. Cully D.F. Arena J.P. Liberator P.A. Rosenblum C.I. Hamelin M.J. Hreniuk D.L. Palyha O.C. Anderson J. Paress P.S. Diaz C. Chou M. Liu K. McKee K.K. Pong S-S. Chaung L-Y. Elbrecht A.

As the endogenous ligand for GHS-R has not been identified, however, the regulatory mechanism of this growth hormone secretagogue system remains elusive. Recent progress in molecular and cellular biology has made it possible to use orphan receptors as assay systems to purify unknown ligands (10.Civelli O. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This technique uses cells expressing the orphan receptor to monitor intracellular changes of second messengers, such as cAMP production, calcium concentration, and arachidonic acid release (11.Meunier J.C.

Nature. 1999; 401: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Using this technique, we succeeded in the purification of an endogenous ligand for GHS-R from the stomach and named it “ghrelin” (18.Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7261) Google Scholar). Ghrelin has a unique structure, with an n-octanoyl modification at its third serine residue essential for its activities to stimulate GH secretion from pituitary cells. The existence of ghrelin in the stomach suggests a new mechanism regulating GH secretion. In the course of the purification of ghrelin, we noticed another active peptide that induced intracellular calcium changes in the cells expressing GHS-R. We report here the purification and characterization of this peptide. The peptide is a 27-amino acid peptide with ann-octanoyl modification at its third serine residue, identical to ghrelin except for deletion of one glutamine. We designate this peptide des-Gln14-ghrelin. We also demonstrate that des-Gln14-ghrelin is produced through an alternative splicing of rat ghrelin gene. A full-length cDNA of rat GHS-R was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR from a rat brain cDNA template. Sense and antisense primers were synthesized based on the reported sequence of rat GHS-R. The sense primer is 5′-ATGTGGAACGCGACCCCCAGCGA-3′, and the antisense primer is 5′-ACCCCCAATTGTTTCCAGACCCAT-3′. The amplified cDNA was ligated into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The expression vector, GHSR-pcDNA3.1, was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Stable transfectants were selected in 1 mg/ml G418. The resultant cell lines were screened for intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) changes induced by GHRP-6 (Peninsula Laboratories, Belmont, CA). The clone (CHO-GHSR62), which showed the highest response, was used in the following assays. CHO-GHSR62 cells were plated in flat bottom, black-wall 96-well plates (Corning Corstar Corporation, Cambridge, MA) at 4 × 104 cells/well for 12–15 h before the assay. Cells were loaded with 4 μm Fluo-4-AM fluorescent indicator dye (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 1 h in assay buffer (Hanks' balanced salts solution), 10 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm probenecid, 1% fetal calf serum and washed four times in assay buffer without fetal calf serum. Intracellular calcium concentration changes were assayed by a fluorometric imaging plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) (19.Schroeder K.S. Neagle B.D. J. Biomol. Screening. 1996; 1: 75-80Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We used the maximum change in fluorescence over baseline to determine agonist responses. Des-Gln14-ghrelin was purified as described previously for ghrelin (18.Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7261) Google Scholar). Fresh rat stomach (40 g) was minced and boiled for 5 min in 5× volumes of water to inactivate intrinsic proteases. The solution was adjusted to 1 m acetic acid (AcOH), 20 mm HCl. Stomach tissues were homogenized with a Polytron mixer. The supernatant of the extracts, obtained after a 30-min centrifugation at 11,000 rpm, was concentrated to ∼40 ml by evaporation. A 2× volume of acetone was added to the concentrate for acetone precipitation in 66% acetone. Acetone was removed from the isolated supernatants by evaporation. The supernatant was loaded onto a 10-g cartridge of Sep-Pak C18 (Waters, Milford, MA), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The Sep-Pak cartridge was washed with 10% acetonitrile (CH3CN), 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the peptide fraction was eluted in 60% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluate was evaporated and lyophilized. The residual materials were redissolved in 1 m AcOH and adsorbed on a column of SP-Sephadex C-25 (H+-form, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), pre-equilibrated with 1 m AcOH. Successive elutions with 1 m AcOH, 2 mpyridine, and 2 m pyridine-AcOH (pH 5.0) provided three fractions of SP-I, SP-II, and SP-III. Lyophilized SP-III fraction (dry weight: 39 mg) was applied to a Sephadex G-50 gel-filtration column (1.8 × 130 cm) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Five-milliliter fractions were collected. A portion of each fraction was subjected to the [Ca2+]i change assay using CHO-GHSR62 cells. Active fractions (43–48) were separated by carboxymethyl (CM)-ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a column of TSK CM-2SW (4.6 × 250 mm, Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) using an ammonium acetate gradient (HCOONH4) (pH 6.4) of 10 mm to 1 m in the presence of 10% CH3CN at a flow rate of 1 ml/min for 100 min. Two-milliliter fractions were collected and assayed for [Ca2+]i change. CM-HPLC active fractions were further fractionated by a second CM-HPLC on the same column at pH 4.8 to give two active peaks (P-I and P-II). The active peak was purified manually using a C-18 reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) column (Symmetry 300, 3.9 × 150 mm, Waters, Milford, MA). From P-I, ghrelin was purified as reported previously. Des-Gln14-ghrelin was purified from P-II. The primary sequence of des-Gln14-ghrelin was determined using a protein sequencer (ABI 494 protein sequencer; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry was performed on a quadrupole mass spectrometer SSQ7000 (Finnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with a Finnigan ESI source. A needle capillary was heated at 150 °C to evaporate samples. Samples were dissolved in 50% (v/v) methanol, 1% AcOH and introduced into the +4.5 kV (positive ionization) ion source at a flow rate of 5 μl/min by direct infusion with a syringe pump. Molecular masses of the purified peptides were calculated using the ICIS software Bioworks provided by Finnigan. Peptide syntheses of des-Gln14-ghrelin were performed as described previously for ghrelin (18.Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7261) Google Scholar). The fully protected peptide of 27-amino acids, without post-translational modifications, was synthesized by the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid-phase method by a peptide synthesizer (433A, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The hydroxyl group of Ser3 was acylated withn-octanoic acid by the action of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide in the presence of 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine. Based on the amino acid sequence determined for purified rat ghrelin, we searched the expressed sequence tag data base in the GenBankTM. One rat expressed sequence tag sequence (accession number AI549172) contained the rat ghrelin sequence. Based on this sequence, we designed sense and antisense primers (sense primer, 5′-TTGAGCCCAGAGCACCAGAAA-3′; and antisense primer, 5′-AGTTGCAGAGGAGGCAGAAGCT-3′). Reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed with a rat stomach cDNA as template. PCR conditions utilized 35 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The amplified fragment was labeled with [32P]dCTP and used as a screening probe for a rat stomach cDNA library. Approximately 2 × 105 recombinant phages were screened. Six positive phages were isolated and subcloned into plasmid pBS. Both strands of cloned cDNAs were sequenced. One of six cDNA clones encoded the prepro-des-Gln14-ghrelin sequence. A rat genomic library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was screened using rat ghrelin cDNA as a labeled probe. Three positive phages were isolated from 4 × 104 phages of the library. A partial genomic fragment of rat ghrelin was obtained by PCR using a rat ghrelin genomic phage as template. Based on the rat ghrelin cDNA sequence, a primer set was designed. The sense primer, corresponding to the amino acid sequence FLSPEHQK (27–34 of rat prepro-ghrelin), was 5′-TCTTGAGCCCAGAGCACCAGAAA-3′. The antisense primer, corresponding to the amino acid sequence SKKPPAKL (41–48 of rat prepro-ghrelin), was 5′-CAGTTTAGCTGGTGGCTTCTTGGAT-3′. PCR conditions were 35 cycles of 98 °C for 5 s, 62 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The amplified fragment was subcloned into TOPO TA Cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced. Total genomic DNA (10 μg) from rat liver was digested with BamHI, EcoRI, orPstI. DNA fragments were resolved by electrophoresis in 1.0% (w/v) agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Zeta-probe, BIO-RAD). For high stringency hybridization, the membrane was hybridized overnight at 42 °C in ULTRAHyb solution (Ambion, Austin, TX). For low stringency hybridization, the membrane was hybridized overnight at 37 °C in 30% formamide, 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 1% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. 32P-labeled rat ghrelin cDNA was used for hybridizations. Male Wister rats (250 g) were prepared with a single indwelling jugular catheter under sodium pentobarbital. Each animal received a 1- or 5-μg injection of synthetic rat ghrelin or des-Gln14-ghrelin. Blood samples were collected at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 60 min after injection. All samples were centrifuged immediately, and the plasmas were assayed for GH by radioimmunoassay. A polyclonal antibody was raised against the N-terminal fragment (1.Carter S.C. Schwartz J. Smit L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 187-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 2.Muller E.E.

The radioimmunoassay incubation mixture consisted of 100 μl of unknown sample solution, normal rabbit serum, and 200 μl of antiserum at a dilution of 1:3,000,000. After a 12-h incubation at 4 °C, 100 μl of 125I-labeled ligand (15,000 cpm) was added to the mixture. 100 μl of anti-rabbit goat antibody was added after a 36 h incubation at 4 °C. Free and bound tracers were separated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 30 min after incubation for 24 h at 4 °C. Pellet radioactivity was quantified using a gamma counter. A stable CHO transfectant expressing rat GHS-R (CHO-GHSR62) was used to monitor the changes in [Ca2+]i (18.Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7261) Google Scholar). Rat stomach extracts had high activity that induced [Ca2+]i increases in CHO-GHSR62 cells. Gel-filtration of stomach extracts showed that the activity was eluted at relative molecular mass (M r) of ∼3000 (Fig. 1 a). Active fractions were further purified by CM-ion-exchange HPLC (Fig.1 b). After a second CM-HPLC, active fractions were separated into two peaks (Fig. 1 c). From the main active peak (P-I), the n-octanoyl modified peptide, ghrelin, was purified as described previously (18.Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7261) Google Scholar). Des-Gln14-ghrelin was isolated from the second active peak (P-II) and further purified to homogeneity by RP-HPLC (Fig. 1 d). The yields of purified ghrelin and des-Gln14-ghrelin were 16 and 4 μg from 40 g of rat stomach tissues, respectively. The purified peptides from P-I and P-II were subjected to protein sequencing. The amino acid sequences were determined as follow. P-I, GSXFLSPEHQKAQQRKESKKPPAKLQPR, and P-II, GSX'FLSPEHQKAQRKESKKPPAKLQPR (Fig.2 a), where X and X' aren-octanoylated serines as described below. The P-I peak contained the rat ghrelin peptide of 28-amino acids, where X is ann-octanoyl serine. As in the results of the cDNA determination and mass spectrometric analysis described below, the P-II peptide (des-Gln14-ghrelin, 27 amino acids) has the same sequence as ghrelin except it is missing one glutamine present in ghrelin (28 amino acids) (Fig. 2 b). To determine whether des-Gln14-ghrelin was also modified byn-octanoyl group at the third serine, we subjected purified des-Gln14-ghrelin to ESI-mass spectrometry and calculated its molecular weight (Fig. 2 c). The observed molecular mass of des-Gln14-ghrelin was 3187.1 ± 0.6, which is 126.7 mass units higher than the molecular mass calculated for 27-residue peptide (3060.4) (X' = Ser). These results indicate that the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group in Ser3 of des-Gln14-ghrelin may be replaced by ann-octanoyl (C7H15CO) moiety (127 mass). This modification is the same as that of ghrelin (18.Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7261) Google Scholar). For verifying the deduced structure, we synthesized an [O-N-octanoyl-Ser3]-27-residue peptide and compared its characteristics with that of the purified peptide. Both peptides show identical retention times on RP-HPLC, identical molecular masses and spectra of multiply charged ions with ESI-mass spectrometry. Moreover, they demonstrate the same [Ca2+]i-increasing activities on cells expressing GHS-R. Thus, the structure of natural des-Gln14-ghrelin is an [O-N- octanoyl-Ser3]-peptide. An important question is whether des-Gln14-ghrelin is a mutational product of the ghrelin gene in a rat(s) or whether des-Gln14-ghrelin exists in all rats. To address the question, we measured des-Gln14-ghrelin concentrations in rat stomach by using a ghrelin-specific radioimmunoassay. Because the antibody used in the radioimmunoassay system can recognize both ghrelin and des-Gln14-ghrelin at the same level, we used CM-ion-exchange HPLC to separate des-Gln14-ghrelin from ghrelin (Fig. 3). Des-Gln14-ghrelin did exist in all the rat stomachs examined. The concentration of des-Gln14-ghrelin was 32 pmol/g, whereas that of ghrelin was 120 pmol/g. These results indicate that ghrelin and des-Gln14-ghrelin exist at considerable levels in rat stomach. Fig.4 a showed time courses of [Ca2+]i changes in GHS-R-expressing cells induced by ghrelin and des-Gln14-ghrelin. Maximum levels of [Ca2+]i increases and the patterns of [Ca2+]i change are the same for the two peptides. A synthetic GHRP-6 also induced [Ca2+]i increases (Fig.4 a). On the other hand, motilin, the endogenous ligand for a GHS-R-homologous receptor GPR38 (20.Feighner S.D. Tan C.P. McKee K.K. Palyha O.C. Hreniuk D.L. Pong S-S. Austin C.P. Figueroa D. MacNeil D. Cascieri M.A. Nargund R. Bakshi R. Abramovitz M. Stocco R. Kargman S. O'Neill G. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Evans J. Patchett A.A. Smith R.G. Howard A.D. Science. 1999; 284: 2184-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), did not induced [Ca2+]i increases at the peptide concentration of 10−8m (Fig.4 a). Des-Gln14-ghrelin as well as ghrelin potently induced increases in [Ca2+]i in CHO-GHSR62 cells (Fig. 4 b). EC50 values of des-Gln14-ghrelin and ghrelin are 2.4 × 10−9m and 2.5 × 10−9m, respectively. To confirm that des-Gln14-ghrelin is a GH-releasing peptide, we intravenously injected synthetic des-Gln14-ghrelin into anesthetized rats and measured plasma GH concentrations. After injections of des-Gln14-ghrelin or ghrelin, plasma GH concentrations increased with a maximum level at 10–20 min after injection (Fig.5). The increase in plasma GH concentration was observed from a 1-μg injection of ghrelin/rat. In contrast, no increase of plasma GH concentration was observed when rats were injected with physiological saline. GH concentrations and time courses of plasma GH changes were the same when des-Gln14-ghrelin or ghrelin was used. These results indicate that des-Gln14-ghrelin is an endogenous GH-releasing peptide with a similar potency to ghrelin. To investigate whether ghrelin homologous sequences exist, we performed a Southern blot analysis of rat liver DNA under high or low stringency hybridization conditions (21.Kojima M. Ohyama Y. Miyamoto K. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13136-13140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When rat ghrelin cDNA was used as a probe, the hybridized patterns were the same for both high and low stringency conditions (Fig. 6). Moreover, after longer exposure times of 10 days, we could not detect extra bands. These results indicate that there is no homologous sequence to ghrelin in rat DNA. Complementary DNA analysis of ghrelin mRNA from stomach revealed that there are two types of ghrelin precursors. One is the previously reported 117-amino acid precursor (prepro-ghrelin), which contains the 28-amino acid ghrelin (18.Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7261) Google Scholar). The other is a 116-amino acid precursor (prepro-des-Gln14-ghrelin), which contained the des-Gln14-ghrelin sequence (Fig.7). The nucleotide sequences of both clones are identical except for deletion of the CAG (nucleotide 139–141 of prepro-ghrelin cDNA, accession number AB029433) in the prepro-des-Gln14-ghrelin cDNA at the point indicated by the triangle in Fig. 7. The ratios of the two precursor population was 1 (prepro-des-Gln14-ghrelin) to 5 (prepro-ghrelin) in the cDNA clones analyzed. This indicates that the prepro-ghrelin cDNA is preferred over the prepro-des-Gln14-ghrelin cDNA in the alternative splicing in ghrelin mRNA. To reveal whether des-Gln14-ghrelin was another genomic product distinct from the ghrelin gene or whether des-Gln14-ghrelin was produced through an alternative splicing of ghrelin mRNA, we determined the partial nucleic sequence of the rat ghrelin gene. The PCR amplified fragment of rat ghrelin was subcloned into a plasmid vector and sequenced. Fig. 8 showed the partial genomic structure of rat ghrelin. Sequence analysis of the rat ghrelin gene revealed that an intron exists between Gln13 and Gln14 of ghrelin. Fig. 8 indicates that the CAG codon of Gln13 is the end of the first exon and is followed by GT, which is the 5′-end signal of the first intron. Two AGs,boxed in Fig. 8, may be used as a splicing acceptor site at the 3′-end of the intron. When the second boxed AG is used as the splicing acceptor, des-Gln14-ghrelin should be produced. Alternatively, ghrelin would be produced when the first boxed AG is used as the splicing acceptor. This exon-intron boundary matches the GT-AG rule of the splicing mechanism (22.McKeown M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 133-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We report here the purification and characterization of des-Gln14-ghrelin from rat stomach, a second endogenous ligand for GHS-R. Des-Gln14-ghrelin is homologous to ghrelin except that one glutamine (14th Gln of ghrelin) is missing in des-Gln14-ghrelin. Des-Gln14-ghrelin is modified at its third serine by the n-octanoyl group in a manner similar to ghrelin (18.Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7261) Google Scholar). This n-octanoyl modification is characteristic of the structure of ghrelin. The corresponding modification of des-Gln14-ghrelin is also needed to activate GHS-R. Des-Gln14-ghrelin has the same potency to induce [Ca2+]i increases in cells expressing GHS-R. Moreover, when des-Gln14-ghrelin is injected into anesthetized rats, increases in plasma GH concentrations are observed. These results strongly indicate that des-Gln14-ghrelin is another endogenous ligand for GHS-R and a novel growth hormone releasing peptide in the stomach. We also show that des-Gln14-ghrelin exists in the stomachs of all rats examined and is not a mutational product of the ghrelin gene. Thus, the endogenous ligands for GHS-R are composed of two homologous peptides, ghrelin and des-Gln14-ghrelin. However, it was not clear whether ghrelin and des-Gln14-ghrelin are distinct genomic products or not. Our research strongly indicates that des-Gln14-ghrelin is not a distinct genomic product from the ghrelin gene but is produced through an alternative splicing of the ghrelin gene. We analyzed rat genomic DNA by Southern blot using rat ghrelin cDNA as the hybridization probe to search for ghrelin homologous sequence. Both under lower and higher stringency conditions for hybridizations, the same patterns of hybridized bands were observed. Moreover, after longer exposure for 10 days, no additional hybridization bands were observed even in low stringency conditions. These results indicate that there is no additional sequence homologous to ghrelin. Next, we have cloned a prepro-des-Gln14-ghrelin cDNA from a rat stomach cDNA library. The nucleotide sequence of the clone is identical to that of prepro-ghrelin, except that a CAG nucleotide is missing between nucleotide 134 and 135 in prepro-des-Gln14-ghrelin mRNA (Fig. 7). This result indicates that des-Gln14-ghrelin is processed from a prepro-des-Gln14-ghrelin precursor, which is the translated product of prepro-des-Gln14-ghrelin mRNA. In addition, we analyzed the genomic structure of rat ghrelin. The analysis reveals that an intron exists between Gln13 and Gln14 of the ghrelin sequence. The 3′-end of the intron has two tandem CAG sequences. The AGs of these sequences may serve as the splicing signals (22.McKeown M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 133-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). When the first AG is used for the splicing signal, prepro-ghrelin mRNA is produced and the second CAG is translated into Gln14. On the other hand, when the second AG is used, prepro-des-Gln14-ghrelin mRNA is created to produce des-Gln14-ghrelin missing Gln14. These results confirmed that des-Gln14-ghrelin is processed from the ghrelin gene by alternative splicing and is not a distinct genomic product from ghrelin. Two AGs boxed in Fig. 8 should serve as splice acceptor sites, producing either ghrelin or des-Gln14-ghrelin mRNA accordingly. Thus, we present here a new mechanism to produce multiple forms of a peptide hormone. Two different ghrelin peptides, both of which are derived from a single gene, are produced through alternative splicing of the pre-mRNAs. It is well known that peptide hormones are cleaved by processing proteases to produce multiple forms of hormones (23.Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Some examples are B-type natriuretic peptide (24.Aburaya M. Suzuki E. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Tanaka K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), C-type natriuretic peptide (25.Minamino N. Makino Y. Tateyama H. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), prolactin releasing peptide (14.Hinuma S. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kawamata Y. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kitada C. Masuo Y. Asano T. Matsumoto H. Sekiguchi M. Kurokawa T. Nishimura O. Onda H. Fujino M. Nature. 1998; 393: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), and substance K (26.Tatemoto K. Lundberg J.M. Jornvall H. Mutt V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, these peptides are derived from a single mRNA transcribed from a single gene. Otherwise, bioactive peptides have two or three homologous peptides forming a peptide family, such as natriuretic peptides (atrial natriuretic peptide, B-type natriuretic peptide, and C-type natriuretic peptide) (27.Koller K.J. Goeddel D.V. Circulation. 1992; 86: 1081-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), calcitonin gene-related peptides (α- and β-calcitonin gene-related peptides) (28.Rosenfeld M.G. Emeson R.B. Yeakley J.M. Merillat N. Hedjran F. Lenz J. Delsert C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 657: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and endothelins (endothelin-1, -2, and -3) (29.Yanagisawa M. Masaki T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 374-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). These families of peptides are the products of different genes. Thus, ghrelin is the first example that an alternative splicing in the peptide coding region produces two different mature peptides. The emergence of des-Gln14-ghrelin and ghrelin indicates that GH release from the pituitary may be controlled by two ghrelin peptides in the stomach. Further research has to be conducted to determine whether ghrelin and des-Gln14-ghrelin have different functions. We thank R. Haruno and K. Miyaji for their technical assistance and Y. Hayashi, N.

Some XP patients also develop a characteristic neurodegeneration believed to result from their inability to repair neuronal DNA damaged by endogenous metabolites since the harmful UV radiation in sunlight does not reach neurons. Free radicals, which are abundant in neurons, induce DNA lesions that, if unrepaired, might cause the XP neurodegeneration. Searching for such a lesion, we developed a synthesis for 8,5′-(S)-cyclo-2′-deoxyadenosine (cyclo-dA), a free radical-induced bulky lesion, and incorporated it into DNA to test its repair in mammalian cell extracts and living cells. Using extracts of normal and mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to test for NER and adult rat brain extracts to test for base excision repair, we found that cyclo-dA is repaired by NER and not by base excision repair. We measured host cell reactivation, which reflects a cell's capacity for NER, by transfecting CHO and XP cells with DNA constructs containing a single cyclo-dA or a cyclobutane thymine dimer at a specific site on the transcribed strand of a luciferase reporter gene. We found that, like the cyclobutane thymine dimer, cyclo-dA is a strong block to gene expression in CHO and human cells. Cyclo-dA was repaired extremely poorly in NER-deficient CHO cells and in cells from patients in XP complementation group A with neurodegeneration. Based on these findings, we propose that cyclo-dA is a candidate for an endogenous DNA lesion that might contribute to neurodegeneration in XP.

Some XP patients also develop a progressive atrophic neurodegeneration, termed XP neurological disease, which is due to death of neurons resembling that seen in normal aging and in several adult-onset neurodegenerations (2.Robbins J.H.

However, UV radiation-induced photoproducts requiring NER are formed only by short-wavelength radiation (8.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis.

Therefore, it has been proposed that the DNA of neurons is damaged by reactive cellular metabolites, including oxygen free radicals abundant in neurons (2.Robbins J.H. J. Am. Med.

Two classes of these candidate DNA lesions have been considered as possible causes of the neurodegeneration (11.Satoh M.S. Jones C.J. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The first class contains well studied lesions such as 8-oxo-dG and thymine glycols, which are typically processed by base excision repair (BER) (8.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W.

Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6335-6339Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), e.g. covalent intrastrand purine dimers, which are not available for synthesis into DNA, and 8,5′-cyclopurine deoxyribonucleosides, which have recently been synthesized (20.Romieu A. Gasparutto D. Didier M. Cadet J. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 5245-5249Crossref Google Scholar, 21.Romieu A. Gasparutto D. Cadet J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because NER has never been studied on any lesion from the second class, we chose 8,5′-(S)-cyclo-2′-deoxyadenosine (cyclo-dA) as the candidate 8,5′-cyclo-2′-deoxypurine lesion for DNA repair studies in mammalian cells and their extracts. It has been shown by mass spectrometry that 8,5′-cyclo-2′-deoxyguanosine occurs in DNA of human cells (22.Dizdaroglu M. Dirksen M.L. Jiang H.X. Robbins J.H. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 929-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), that its concentration is increased therein by hydroxyl radicals generated by ionizing radiation (22.Dizdaroglu M. Dirksen M.L. Jiang H.X. Robbins J.H. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 929-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and that cyclo-dA predominates over 8,5′-cyclo-2′-deoxyguanosine in irradiated dsDNA (23.Dirksen M.L. Blakely W.F. Holwitt E. Dizdaroglu M. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1988; 54: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The yield of cyclopurine lesions is comparable to the yield of 8-oxo-dG in DNA exposed to ionizing radiation (24.Dizdaroglu M. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 8,5′-cyclo-2′-deoxyguanosine adducts are formed when dGMP is exposed to oxygen radicals generated by the Fenton reaction in vitro(25.Henle E.S. Luo Y. Gassmann W. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21177-21186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although that study (25.Henle E.S. Luo Y. Gassmann W. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21177-21186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) did not identify 8,5′-cyclo-2′-deoxyguanosine in DNA exposed to the Fenton reaction conditions, the authors suggested that failure to identify the lesion could have resulted from its inhibition of the enzymes used to cleave the DNA. Subsequent work by other groups supports this possibility (20.Romieu A. Gasparutto D. Didier M. Cadet J. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 5245-5249Crossref Google Scholar,21.Romieu A. Gasparutto D. Cadet J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this work, we first studied cyclo-dA as a substrate for NER using extracts prepared from wild-type and NER-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and then for BER using extracts prepared from adult mammalian brain. In addition, we developed a novel, highly sensitive host cell reactivation (HCR) assay utilizing DNA constructs containing a single site-specific cyclo-dA or a cis,syn-cyclobutane thymine dimer (TT dimer) (26.Kosmoski J.V. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9485-9494Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) on the transcribed strand of a luciferase (Luc) reporter gene downstream of the strong cytomegalovirus promoter. Transfection of these constructs into NER-deficient cells allowed us to assess the effect of single lesions on gene expression in living cells, whereas transfection into repair-proficient cells allowed us to study repair of the lesion over time. All steps were conducted under subdued lighting and in the absence of UV radiation. The 30-mer lesion-free single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide had the following sequence: 3′-CCAAGGACCTTGTTAACGAAAATGTCTACG-5′ (MfeI site underlined). Because the cyclo-dA phosphoramidite was a 5′-O-phosphoramidite, its incorporation into DNA required 5′–3′ synthesis. The cyclo-dA and control dA phosphoramidites contained identical protecting and coupling groups, except that the dA phosphoramidite had N 6-benzoyl protection. Oligonucleotides were synthesized in a 5′–3′ direction on an ABI 394 DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) using 3′-O-DMT-2′-deoxyribonucleoside 5′-(β-cyanoethyl)-N,N-diisopropylaminophosphoramidite and 3′-O-DMT-2′-deoxyribonucleoside 5′-succinoyl-Controlled-Pore Glass synthesis supports. All synthesis reagents were from Glen Research Corp. (Sterling, VA). DNA containing the cyclic-dA lesion was synthesized up to the position of incorporation on the DNA synthesizer, at which point we coupled manually either 3′-TBDMS-8,5′-cyclodeoxyadenosine 8,5′-(β-cyanoethyl)-N,N-diisopropylaminophosphoramidite (for the cyclo-dA oligonucleotide) or 3′-TBDMS-dA 5′-(β-cyanoethyl)-N,N-diisopropylaminophosphoramidite (for the cyclo-dA control sequence). For the coupling reaction, 10 μmol of the phosphoramidite was dissolved in 0.4 ml of 0.25m 5-ethylthio-1H-tetrazole/acetonitrile and coupled using two 1-ml polypropylene syringes for 10 min. Capping and oxidation were then performed on the DNA synthesizer. Following incorporation of the 3′-TBDMS-protected base, the synthesis support was washed with anhydrous acetonitrile on the synthesizer, and the support was dried with argon. 3′-TBDMS protection was removed manually using 1m tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Aldrich) over 2 h at 25 °C. A 1-ml polypropylene syringe was attached to each end of the synthesis column, and 1 ml of tetrabutylammonium fluoride/THF was passed back and forth through the column using the syringes over 2 h. The support was then washed two times each with THF and then with acetonitrile and put back on the synthesizer to complete the synthesis, leaving on the final DMT. Silyl deprotection of DNA synthesized on Controlled-Pore Glass required the use of tetrabutylammonium fluoride for reduced time to minimize cleavage of the oligonucleotide from the support. Treatment of the Controlled-Pore Glass support with triethylamine/trihydrofluoride (Aldrich) resulted in nearly quantitative cleavage of the substrate from the support. The synthetic DNAs were cleaved and deprotected using NH4OH over 16 h at 55 °C and were partially purified on a Poly-Pak cartridge (Glen Research Corp.). The products were dried in a vacuum concentrator prior to final purification by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All steps were conducted under subdued lighting and in the absence of UV radiation. The TT dimer phosphoramidite and oligonucleotides containing the TT dimer were synthesized as described (26.Kosmoski J.V. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9485-9494Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Synthesis columns containing support-bound oligonucleotides with the TT dimer were deprotected in two steps. First, O-methyl phosphate group protection was removed from the central phosphate of the TT dimer by treatment with thiophenol/triethylamine/THF (1:2:2) for 45 min at room temperature. The synthesis support was successively washed eight times with 1 ml of THF, five times with 1 ml of methanol, and three times with 1 ml of acetonitrile and then dried by passing argon through the column; the support was transferred to an amber vial. Second, DNA products were cleaved and deprotected by adding 1 ml of concentrated NH4OH to the vials, sealed, and incubated at 55 °C for 16 h in the dark. Vials were then cooled on ice and decanted. The support was washed with 1 ml of H2O; the combined solutions were filtered, diluted twice with H2O, and purified on a Poly-Pak cartridge. Partially purified DNA was eluted with 1 ml of 20% acetonitrile/H2O, recovered by vacuum concentration, and gel-purified. Enzymatic characterization of DNA synthesized with our TT dimer phosphoramidite verified the lesion's stereochemistry and indicated that ∼90% of the expected sites contained a TT dimer (26.Kosmoski J.V. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9485-9494Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Subsequent primer extension experiments demonstrated that 10% of the TT dimers reverted back to thymine (data not shown). Our dsDNA constructs containing reverted sites were cut with MfeI and thereby separated from the remaining covalently closed circular constructs containing TT dimers. DNA sequences for the HindIII-ApaI fragment of plasmid pCMVGL3PA were as follows: 5′-AGCTTGGCATTCCGGTACTGCAGGTAAAGCCACCATGGAAGACGCCAAAAACATAAAGAAAGGGCC-3′ and 3′-ACCGTAAGGCCATGACAACCATTTCGGTGGTACCTTCTGCGGTTTTTGTATTTCTTTC-5′ (NcoI site underlined). The NcoI site contained a cyclo-dA or its control dA, and the resulting 58-mers were each annealed to the 66-mer by Oligos Etc. (Wilsonville, OR). Oligonucleotide synthesis conditions were as described above, except that (3-(4,4′-dimethoxytrityloxy)-2,2-dicarboxymethylamido)propylsuccinoylpolystyrene synthesis support (27.Guzaev A. Lonnberg H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1997; 38: 3989-3992Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was used to produce 5′-phosphorylated single-stranded DNA, and 3′-TBDMS protection was removed manually using triethylamine/trihydrofluoride (28.Westman E. Stromberg R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2430-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) over 5 h at 25 °C. The cholesterol-containing DNA substrate for the NER assay and the etheno-dA- and 8-oxo-dG-containing DNAs for the BER assay were synthesized in the standard 3′–5′ direction. The cyclo-dA and its dA control sequence in the NER assay were synthesized 5′–3′ as described above. Excision nuclease assays were carried out essentially as described (29.Brooks P.J. Mutat. Res. 1998; 408: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 140-mer duplex DNA substrate containing a cholesterol moiety, a cyclo-dA, or dA at the central position and a 32P label on the sixth phosphodiester bond 5′ to the lesion was synthesized as described (29.Brooks P.J. Mutat. Res. 1998; 408: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Substrates (5 × 104 cpm) were incubated with 25 μg of whole cell extract from AA8, UV135, or UV20 CHO cells for 3 h at 25 °C. Complementation reactions contained 12.5 μg each of UV135 and UV20 whole cell extracts. Reactions were deproteinized with proteinase K, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction; recovered by ethanol precipitation; and analyzed on denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels, followed by autoradiography. Cell nuclei from rat brain were isolated as described (30.Brooks P.J. Marietta C. Goldman D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 939-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and extracted with 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50% glycerol, and 0.25 m NaCl. 10 μg of nuclear extract protein was incubated with 34-mer duplex substrates (30.Brooks P.J. Marietta C. Goldman D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 939-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that contained the indicated DNA lesions and that were labeled with 32P at the 5′-end of the lesion-containing strands. Reactions contained 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 32 mm KCl, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 μl (5 μg) of nuclear extract protein in the extraction buffer described above. Following a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, 2 μl of the reaction mixture was diluted into 10 μl of 10 mm NaOH containing 95% formamide, heated to 90 °C for 3 min to cleave abasic sites, and separated on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. We constructed the 6.0-kb pCMVGL3PA plasmid from pGL3-Control (Promega) by adding PstI andAatII sites at positions +263 and +286, respectively; by changing NarI to ApaI; and by replacing its SV40 promoter (from BglII-HindIII) with the corresponding cytomegalovirus promoter from pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). For certain experiments, the HindIII-ApaI fragment of pCMVGL3PA was replaced (31.Carty M.P. Lawrence C.W. Dixon K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9637-9647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with either cyclo-dA or the cyclo-dA control sequence containing the NcoI site. pCMVGL3PAΔ3 (6.0 kb) was constructed from pCMVGL3PA by site-directed mutagenesis of all MfeI sites except that at position +395. M13Luc (9.4 kb) was constructed by inserting theBglII-BamHI fragment containing the complete transcription unit fragment from pCMVGL3Δ3 into M13mp18. We prepared covalently closed circular dsDNA containing site-specific lesions by annealing synthetic 30-mer DNA oligonucleotides (positions 384–413 of pGL3-Control, with or without a lesion in the MfeI site) as described (32.Kodadek T. Gamper H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3210-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), except that T7 DNA polymerase was substituted (33.Kunkel T. Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Oligonucleotide-directed Mutagenesis without Phenotypic Selection. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 8.1.1Google Scholar). Lesion-containing M13Luc preparations were digested withMfeI to linearize any non-lesion-containing constructs. M13Luc was used in most HCR experiments. For some experiments, pCMVGL3PAΔ3 phagemid DNA, with or without a lesion, was constructed as described for M13Luc using single-stranded pCMVGL3PAΔ3 prepared with M13K07 as the helper phage (34.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Covalently closed circular lesion-containing and lesion-free dsDNA constructs were separated from linear and nicked constructs by electrophoresis on 1% agarose containing ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/μl), electroeluted, and recovered by ethanol precipitation. The CHO lines used were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were as follows: CRL-1859 (AA8), CRL-1862 (UV20), and CRL-1867 (UV135). The SV40-transformed human cell lines used were from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Camden, NJ) and were as follows: GM00637 (normal), GM04429 (XP-A) from patient XP12BE, and GM04312 (XP-A) from patient XP2OS. CHO cells were grown in Eagle's α-minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). SV40-transformed cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Each well of a 96-well Microlite microtiter plate (Dynex) received 3 × 103 logarithmically growing cells. After 24 h, the medium was decanted by inversion, and the cells were washed with 200 μl of Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.). Each of the eight wells of a vertical column received 50 ng of carrier plasmid (pUC19) and either 0.1 ng of our 6.0-kb or 0.17 ng of our 9.4-kb Luc plasmid in a mixture of Opti-MEM I and LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 5 h at 37 °C, 200 μl of culture medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum was added to each well. The medium was decanted 18, 24, or 48 h after the start of transfection; each well was washed with 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4); and 50 μl of 1× Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) was added to each well. After rocking for 45 min at room temperature, lysates were assayed in an MLX microtiter plate luminometer (Dynex), which injected luciferase reagent (100 μl/well; Promega) in accord with the manufacturers' instructions. The mean Luc activity was determined from a cell line plated in a vertical row of eight wells and transfected with either a UV-irradiated or lesion-containing construct. The mean Luc activity was also determined from the same cell line plated concomitantly in an adjoining vertical row of eight wells on the same 96-well plate, but transfected with the appropriate control construct that had received no DNA damage. The relative Luc activity of a cell line, expressed as a percent, was calculated by dividing the mean Luc activity obtained with the damaged construct by that obtained with the control construct. Assuming that the ability of a cell line to be transiently transfected in our assay is the same for the lesion-containing construct as it is for the otherwise identical undamaged construct, the relative Luc activity we calculated for one cell line can be compared with that calculated for another line in the same experiment even if the lines have different transfection efficiencies. Analyses of the differences between cell lines in Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7 were based on Student's paired ttest, comparing the logarithms of percentages obtained in the same experiment (35.Armitage P. Statistical Methods in Medical Research. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1971Google Scholar). Analyses of the differences between cell lines from different experiments were based on Student's unpaired ttest, comparing the logarithms of percentages (35.Armitage P. Statistical Methods in Medical Research. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1971Google Scholar). Logarithms were used to lessen the impact of the skewed distributions of the percentages (35.Armitage P. Statistical Methods in Medical Research. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1971Google Scholar). Analyses of untransformed percentages gave similar results.Figure 5Effect of DNA lesions on gene expression in transfected CHO cells. At each assay time of an experiment, the mean Luc activity for each construct was calculated as the mean of eight wells, and time was measured from the start of the 5-h transfection period. The relative Luc activity of a cell line, expressed as a percent, was calculated by dividing the mean Luc activity obtained with the damaged construct by that obtained with the control construct.

The phosphoramidite was synthesized via photochemical conversion of a derivatized 5′-phenylthio-2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine to the desired cyclonucleoside. We prepared the 5′-O-phosphoramidite 9, rather than the more conventional 5′-O-dimethoxytrityl-3′-O-phosphoramidite derivative, based upon a study of molecular models that indicated that the insertion of the bulky 4,4′-DMT group onto the (5′S)-hydroxyl group could prove problematic. While this study was ongoing, a synthesis of a conventional 5′-O-DMT-3′-O-phosphoramidite derivative of cyclo-dA that used the same photochemical procedure was reported (20.Romieu A. Gasparutto D. Didier M. Cadet J. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 5245-5249Crossref Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that, in this work, the insertion of 5′-O-DMT was not trivial and required harsh conditions"

Because very little is known about the maturation and proteolytic activation of BACE, it was necessary to investigate the maturation of BACE during its transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK 293) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 400 μg/ml G418 (to select for βAPP expression), and 200 μg/ml zeocin (to select for BACE expression). HEK 293 cells stably expressing Swedish mutant βAPP or βAPP695 were described previously (7Haass C. Koo E.H. Mellon A. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 29Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). A full-length BACE cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a human neuroblastoma (SK-N-MC) cDNA library in λZAP-Express-vector (obtained from Dr. Christian Behl, Max-Planck Institute for Psychiatry, Munich) using the GC-RICH-PCR-system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and subcloned into the EcoRI/XhoI site of pcDNA4/Myc-HisA (Invitrogen). The cDNA was sequenced for verification. The truncated BACE derivatives were generated by inserting stop codons after amino acid 454 (sBACE) or 477 (BACEΔC) using polymerase chain reaction. The cDNAs were subcloned into the EcoRI/XhoI site of pcDNA4/Myc-HisA. The pro-domain cleavage site mutant BACE-R45A was generated by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis and subcloned into the EcoRI/XhoI site of pcDNA4/Myc-HisA. All cDNA constructs were sequenced to verify successful mutagenesis. The following polyclonal antibodies to BACE were generated (see Fig. 1 A): antibody 7523 to amino acids 46–60, antibody GM 190 to amino acids 22–45, and antibody 7520 to amino acids 482–501. The synthetic peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize rabbits (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). The monoclonal antibody 9E10 to the Myc epitope was obtained from the hybridoma bank. To analyze expression of BACE, HEK 293 cells were starved for 1 h in methionine- and serum-free minimum Eagle's medium and subsequently were metabolically labeled with 700 μCi [35S]methionine (Promix, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in methionine- and serum-free minimum Eagle's medium for 5 min. Subsequently, cells were incubated in the presence of excess amounts of unlabeled methionine for the indicated time points. BACE was immunoprecipitated using previously described protocols (30Haass C. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3783-3793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were pulse-labeled in the presence of 10 μg/ml of tunicamycin as described above. The cold chase was also performed in the presence or absence of tunicamycin. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies GM190 and 9E10. 500 μg of a protein extract from HEK 293 cells expressing Myc-tagged wtBACE were used for immunoprecipitation (30Haass C. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3783-3793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of BACE with antibodies GM190 and 7523. Immunoprecipitates were divided into four aliquots and treated with and without 1 unit N-glycosidase F or with and without 1 milliunit endoglycosidase H (endo H) for 17 h at 37 °C in the presence the buffers recommended by the supplier (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Samples were loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10. HEK 293 cells expressing βAPP as well as BACE were grown to confluence. For the analysis of Aβ in conditioned medium, cells were metabolically labeled with 450 μCi [35S]methionine (Promix, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h and chased for 2 h in medium containing excess amounts of unlabeled methionine. Aβ and p3 were immunoprecipitated from conditioned medium with antibody 3926 (31Wild-Bode C. Yamazaki T. Capell A. Leimer U. Steiner H. Ihara Y. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16085-16088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and were separated on 10–20% Tris-Tricine gels (Novex) and analyzed by fluorography. Immunocytochemistry was carried out as described previously (7Haass C. Koo E.H. Mellon A. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). A BACE cDNA was isolated from a cDNA library generated from human brain. The cDNA was subcloned into an appropriate expression vector and was stably transfected into HEK 293 cells overexpressing wtβAPP (7Haass C. Koo E.H. Mellon A. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cell lines were used previously to identify BACE and to analyze its proteolytic function (21Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar). The same cell line was also used to successfully investigate the effects of the Swedish mutation on β-secretase cleavage (29Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J.

Cell lysates of untransfected HEK 293 cells or cell lines stably expressing BACE were prepared. BACE was immunoprecipitated with the polyclonal antibodies GM190 (targeting amino acids 22–45 corresponding to the pro-peptide sequence, Refs. 21Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S.

Immunoprecipitated BACE was identified by Western blotting using the anti-Myc antibody 9E10. In lysates from transfected cells, a polypeptide corresponding to a molecular mass of about 70 kDa was detected by all three antibodies (Fig. 1 B). This is consistent with the molecular mass of BACE described previously (21Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y.

An additional higher molecular weight band was observed with antibody 7523 and antibody 7520 (Fig.1 B). This band was only very weakly recognized by antibody GM190 (see also Figs. 4 and 5) but was preferentially identified by antibody 7523 (Fig. 1 B). The extremely weak staining of the higher molecular weight band by antibody GM190 may be caused by the very minor maturation of unprocessed BACE. Antibody 7520 raised to the C terminus equally identifies both bands. This indicates that the upper band lacks the pro-peptide and is preferentially recognized by the neo-epitope specific antibody 7523 after removal of the pro-peptide (see below). It is also important to note that GM190 identifies native BACE (after mild extraction of membranes) as well as the denatured protein (after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) or after paraformaldehyde fixation (see below).Figure 5Pro-peptide cleavage. HEK 293 cells stably expressing wtBACE were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and chased in the presence of excess amounts of unlabeled methionine for the indicated time points. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody 7523 (A) or GM190 (B). Note that the pro-peptide antibody GM190 only detects the immature BACE species.

Louis J.C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar). In contrast, antibody GM190 detects the pro-enzyme predominantly within a tubular network corresponding to the ER as well as within the nuclear envelope.Arrows indicate the differential staining of the two antibodies. D, a double stain of cells with antibody GM190 and the anti-BIP antibody demonstrate that the pro-enzyme is predominantly located within the ER.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next analyzed the β-secretase activity of transfected BACE derivatives in HEK 293 cells (stably expressing βAPP). As shown before (21Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J.

Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar) co-expression of BACE together with wtβAPP results in a significant increase of Aβ production (Fig. 1 C), which is accompanied by a decrease of APPs-α (data not shown). We next analyzed the maturation of BACE derivatives in pulse-chase experiments. Three cell lines expressing different BACE cDNA constructs were investigated (Fig.1 A). In addition to the above described cell line expressing the full-length BACE cDNA (wtBACE), cell lines were generated that express two truncated versions of BACE. Stop codons were inserted to generate BACE variants terminating after the transmembrane domain (at amino acid 477) or after amino acid 454 to produce BACEΔC and soluble BACE (sBACE), respectively (Fig. 1 A). Immunoprecipitation of Aβ revealed that wt BACE, BACEΔC, and sBACE exhibited significant β-secretase activity (data not shown). HEK 293 cells stably expressing wtBACE, BACEΔC, or sBACE were pulse-labeled for 5 min with [35S]methionine and chased for 0, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min in the presence of excess amounts of unlabeled methionine. Cell lysates were prepared after the indicated time points and immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody to the Myc tag. Immunoprecipitates were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. After the pulse, a single polypeptide of 70 kDa was observed in all cell lines (Fig.2, A–C). During the chase, wtBACE appeared to be post-translationally modified resulting in a significant increase in its molecular mass. Similar data were obtained for endogenous BACE (data not shown). After 120 min, wtBACE (Fig. 2 A) efficiently maturated whereas BACEΔC maturated much slower (Fig. 2 B). When sBACE was expressed, rapid maturation was observed (Fig. 2 C, upper) and after 60 min, significant amounts of the mature polypeptide were secreted (Fig. 2 C, lower). The ratio of the mature polypeptide versus the immature protein was determined by phosphorimaging. This confirmed that BACEΔC maturated slower than wtBACE whereas sBACE maturated significantly faster than the membrane-associated BACE derivatives (Fig.2 D). Because these results indicated that the cytoplasmic tail of BACE might be important for efficient trafficking, we determined the subcellular localization of wtBACE and BACEΔC by immunofluorescence. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized. BACE derivatives were detected using the antibody 7523. Consistent with previous results (21Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar), wtBACE occurred within the Golgi and other vesicular compartments including the ER as well as the nuclear envelope (Fig. 3 A). In contrast to wtBACE, BACEΔC accumulated within the ER (Fig. 3 B). Taken together with the data shown in Fig. 2, these results demonstrate that BACE derivatives lacking the cytoplasmic tail fail to be efficiently transported out of the ER. The above described increase in the molecular mass of BACE that was observed during the chase period (Fig.2) indicates that BACE might be glycosylated. BACE contains several potential N-linked glycosylation sites (21Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J.

Raf-1 is regulated by complex and incompletely understood mechanisms including phosphorylation. A number of studies have indicated that phosphorylation of serines 259 and 621 can inhibit the Raf-1 kinase. We show that both serines are hypophosphorylated during early mitogenic stimulation and that hypophosphorylation correlates with peak Raf-1 activation. Concentrations of okadaic acid that selectively inhibit protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) induce phosphorylation of these residues and prevent maximal activation of the Raf-1 kinase. This effect is mediated via phosphorylation of serine 259. The PP2A core heterodimer forms complexes with Raf-1 in vivo and in vitro. These data identify PP2A as a positive regulator of Raf-1 activation and are the first indication that PP2A may support the activation of an associated kinase.

Activated Raf-1 can regulate the mitogen-activated protein kinase network by phosphorylating and activating MEK1; within the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, Raf interacts physically with MEK-1 via its kinase domain and with GTP-loaded Ras via its N terminus (2.Daum G.

Activated Ras is the best studied activator of Raf-1. It binds to Raf-1 with high affinity and mediates its translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where activation takes place (3.Marshall M. Mol. Reprod.

This hyperphosphorylation correlates with the down-regulation of Raf-1 kinase activity (9.Wartmann M. Davis R.J. J. Biol.

Serines 43, 621, and 259 are phosphorylated in resting fibroblasts, albeit to different degrees (12.Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of all three residues has been implicated in the negative regulation of Raf-1. Phosphorylation of serine 43 interferes with Ras binding and consequently with Ras-mediated activation (3.Marshall M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated serine 259 and serine 621 represent binding sites for 14-3-3 adaptor proteins (13.Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 14.Aitken A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), whose function in Raf-1 activation is controversial. While bivalent binding to Ser259 and Ser621 has been suggested to maintain Raf-1 in an inactive conformation (15.Rommel C. Radziwill G. Moelling K. Hafen E. Mech. Dev. 1997; 64: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16.Tzivion G. Luo Z. Avruch J. Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), reversible association with 14-3-3 facilitates Ras-dependent activation in vivo and in vitro (17.Roy S. McPherson R.A. Apolloni A. Yan J. Lane A. Clyde-Smith J. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In particular, binding to the Ser(P)621site appears to be necessary for kinase activity (16.Tzivion G. Luo Z. Avruch J. Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 18.Thorson J.A., Yu, L.W. Hsu A.L. Shih N.Y. Graves P.R. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Piwnica-Worms H. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5229-5238Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), a finding that contrasts with the studies indicating that phosphorylation of this site by PKA in vitro is inhibitory (19.Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosch P. Eulitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philipp A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Therefore, the significance of Ser621 phosphorylation is still in question. Its investigation is hampered by the fact that Ser621 is essential for the catalytic function of Raf-1 and cannot be replaced by other amino acids without loss of kinase activity (19.Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosch P. Eulitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philipp A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 20.Baek K.H. Fabian J.R. Sprenger F. Morrison D.K. Ambrosio L. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Serine 259 can be phosphorylated by protein kinase B, another Ras effector activated in parallel with Raf, and this phosphorylation correlates with the down-regulation of kinase activity (21.Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Consistent with an inhibitory role of Ser(P)259, mutation of this residue moderately activates the Raf-1 kinase in cultured cells (16.Tzivion G. Luo Z. Avruch J. Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar,22.Michaud N.R. Fabian J.R. Mathes K.D. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3390-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar); the corresponding point mutants display a gain of function phenotype in Drosophila (15.Rommel C. Radziwill G. Moelling K. Hafen E. Mech. Dev. 1997; 64: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20.Baek K.H. Fabian J.R. Sprenger F. Morrison D.K. Ambrosio L. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data raise the possibility that dephosphorylation of negative regulatory residues plays a role in Raf-1 activation. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major form of serine/threonine phosphatase involved in the regulation of signal transduction, growth, and development (23.Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). This class of enzymes consists of a heterotrimer that exists in multiple forms. The core components of all trimeric forms are the 36-kDa catalytic subunit (PP2AC) and the 65-kDa regulatory subunit (A subunit, PR65). This core heterodimer is ubiquitous, and it forms complexes with “variable” subunits of cellular origin (some of which are expressed in a tissue- and/or development-restricted manner) as well as with transforming viral antigens (24.Pallas D.C. Shahrik L.K. Martin B.L. Jaspers S. Miller T.B. Brautigan D.L. Roberts T.M. Cell. 1990; 60: 167-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 25.Yang S.I. Lickteig R.L. Estes R.

Cell. 1993; 75: 887-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Association with variable subunits of cellular and viral origin occurs via the N-terminal leucine-rich repeats of PR65 (27.Ruediger R. Roeckel D. Fait J. Bergqvist A. Magnusson G. Walter G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and confers distinct properties to the enzyme (28.Kamibayashi C. Mumby M.C. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1995; 9: 195-210Google Scholar). Recently, PP2A has been shown to form a complex with Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (29.Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1258-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) as well as with PAK1, PAK3, and p70 S6 kinase (30.Westphal R.S. Coffee Jr., R.L. Marotta A. Pelech S.L. Wadzinski B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 687-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The isolated catalytic subunit can associate with casein kinase 2α (31.Heriche J.K. Lebrin F. Rabilloud T. Leroy D. Chambaz E.M. Goldberg Y. Science. 1997; 276: 952-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Where investigated (29.Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1258-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), PP2A has been shown to contribute to the inactivation of the associated kinase. Here we show that the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid inhibits full fledged Raf-1 activation. This effect is mediated by a change in the phosphorylation of Ser259 of Raf-1. In addition, Raf-1 forms stable complexes with PP2A heterodimers. Our results are the first indication that PP2A may support the activation of an associated kinase and highlight the intimate relationship between kinases and phosphatases, which we are just beginning to understand. BAC-1.2F5 cells (32.Morgan C. Pollard J.W. Stanley E.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 130: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.63 nm purified mouse recombinant mitogen colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) or 15% L-cell conditioned medium (33.Stanley E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 116: 564-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) as a source of murine CSF-1. COS-1 and COS-7 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. COS cells were transfected by electroporation (0.5–1 × 107 cells/cuvette, 240 V, 960 microfarads, 10 μg of plasmid DNA). The plasmids used were the pCMV5 vector, pCMV.HAcatα (amino acid 9 to the stop of human PP2ACα cloned downstream of a HA tag in pCMV), PRC/CMV.HA65a (amino acid 3 to the stop of human PR65a cloned downstream of a HA tag in pRC/CMV), pCMV-HA-ERK (courtesy of Michael Karin, UCSD), pCMV5Raf-1, and a S259A Raf-1 mutant (pCMV5-S259A). Cells were harvested 2 days after transfection. Under these conditions, protein expression increased linearly between 1 and 10 μg of transfected plasmid DNA. Confluent cultures were starved for 18 h prior to stimulation with recombinant CSF-1 (BAC-1.2F5 cells, 6.3 nm mouse recombinant CSF-1 or 63 nm human recombinant CSF-1 (Chiron Co.) or EGF (COS-1, 33 nm, 10 min). In selected experiments, cells were incubated with okadaic acid (100 nm, 45 min) prior to growth factor stimulation. N-terminal His6-tagged human PP2AC was expressed in the bacterial strain M15[pREP4], and the fusion polypeptide was purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography (Qiagen). Balb/c × CBA F1 mice (∼3 months old) were immunized by subcutaneous injection with 100 μg of bacterially expressed PP2AC fusion protein emulsified with an equal volume of Titremax Gold (CytRx Corp.). The immunization was repeated four times at three monthly intervals, and then the mice rested for 6 months. A further 100 μg of fusion protein in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% SDS was injected intraperitoneally at 6 and 3 days prior to sacrifice. Hybridoma lines were then established by fusing splenocytes from the immunized animal with the myeloma line Sp2/0-Ag14 by polyethylene glycol treatment and conventional procedures. Cell lines were screened for antibody production by a modified dot blot procedure using the bacterially expressed fusion protein (34.Dilworth S.M. Horner V.P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2235-2244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned three times before tissue culture fluid containing the monoclonal antibody was harvested. Clone F2.8F5 was typed as an IgG2K species using Isotype strips (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and confirmed as specific for PP2AC by Western blot analysis using total cell lysates. Using deletion mutants of PP2Ac (35.Evans D.R. Myles T. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24038-24046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the epitope has been mapped close to the C-terminal end of PP2AC. Cells were lysed in solubilization buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C). Immunoprecipitation was performed exactly as described previously (36.Baccarini M. Li W. Sbarba P.D. Stanley E.R. Receptor. 1991; 1: 243-259PubMed Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against a carboxyl-terminal peptide of v-raf (SP63; CTLTTSPRLPVF) was used to immunoprecipitate Raf-1 molecules. A mouse monoclonal antibody against PP2AC (F2 8F5) was used to immunoprecipitate PP2A. HA-tagged PR65α and PP2AC were immunoprecipitated with the HA-epitope-specific monoclonal antibody 12CA5. Immunocomplexes were collected following incubation (1–3 h at 4 °C) with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). For Western blotting, cell lysates (25 μg/lane) or immunoprecipitates were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE prior to electrophoretic transfer onto Hybond C super (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were probed with rabbit polyclonal antisera directed against Raf-1, PP2AC (antibody C1–20), PR65α (37.Turowski P. Fernandez A. Favre B. Lamb N.J. Hemmings B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), p55α and -β (38.Hendrix P. Turowski P. Mayer-Jaekel R.E. Goris J. Hofsteenge J. Merlevede W. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7330-7337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or p72 plus p130 (39.Hendrix P. Mayer-Jackel R.E. Cron P. Goris J. Hofsteenge J. Merlevede W. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15267-15276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or with monoclonal antibodies against Raf-1 (PBB.1; Ref. 40.Kolch W. Weissinger E. Mischak H. Troppmair J. Showalter S.D. Lloyd P. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 713-720PubMed Google Scholar), PP2AC (F2 8F5), or PR 65 (C5 9E10) prior to incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and exposure to the ECL substrate. All blotting reagents were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The blots were stripped according to the manufacturer's instruction. Raf-1 kinase activity was measured as the ability of immunoisolated Raf-1 to phosphorylate recombinant, catalytically inactive MEK-1 (MEK−) or to activate recombinant MEK-1 in coupled assays using MBP (41.Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Ashworth A. Cowley S. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) as the end point of the assay. The GST-Raf-1 fusions used in this study have been previously described (42.Li S. Janosch P. Tanji M. Rosenfeld G.C. Waymire J.C. Mischak H. Kolch W. Sedivy J.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The proteins were expressed by standard techniques in the baculovirus Sf9 cell system and purified as described previously (43.Macdonald S.G. Crews C.M. Wu L. Driller J. Clark R. Erikson R.L. McCormick F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6615-6620Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) with the exception that 1% Triton X-100 was added before binding to GST-agarose. For pull-down assays, 100–200 ng of GST-Raf-1 fusion proteins were incubated with either 1 mg of whole cell lysates or 200 ng of purified heterodimer, PR65α, or PP2AC for 3–6 h at 4 °C. The complexes were recovered by centrifugation and washed in solubilization buffer containing 0.03% SDS, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 m NaCl prior to Western blot analysis. PP2A heterodimer used in this study was provided by Prof. J. Goris (Leuven, Belgium). Catalytic subunit of PP2A was kindly provided by Dr. Lisa Ballou (I.M.P., Vienna). Both forms of the enzyme were purified from rabbit skeletal muscle (44.Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7215-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Recombinant PR65α was kindly provided by Dr. P. Turowski. 32P-Labeling of cells was performed as described previously (36.Baccarini M. Li W. Sbarba P.D. Stanley E.R. Receptor. 1991; 1: 243-259PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysis and immunoprecipitation of Raf-1 proteins were performed as described above. 32P-Labeled proteins were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, extracted from the gels, and subjected to digestion with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions prior to phosphopeptide mapping. Tryptic peptides were separated in the first dimension by electrophoresis using pH 8.9 buffer and in the second dimension (chromatography) using a buffer containingn-butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/water (12:10:3:15). Chromatography was allowed to proceed for 20 h. The amount of Raf-1 contained in the immunoprecipitates used for the mapping of the phosphotryptic peptides was determined by immunoblotting an aliquot of the immunoprecipitates, and it was equal in all samples. Phosphotryptic peptide mapping was repeated twice with comparable results. We have studied Raf-1 phosphorylation and activation in BAC-1.2F5 macrophages stimulated by CSF-1 (45.Buscher D. Hipskind R.A. Krautwald S. Reimann T. Baccarini M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 46.Krautwald S. Buscher D. Kummer V. Buder S. Baccarini M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5955-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The addition of CSF-1 to quiescent BAC-1.2F5 cells induced robust and transient activation of Raf-1 (Fig. 1 A; Ref. 45.Buscher D. Hipskind R.A. Krautwald S. Reimann T. Baccarini M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Peak (16-fold) Raf-1 activation correlated with the transient dephosphorylation of serine 621, the main residue phosphorylated in quiescent macrophages (Fig. 1 B, b). Conversely, the decay of Raf-1 activity to a 4-fold stimulation 15 min post-CSF-1 treatment was accompanied by the hyperphosphorylation of serines 43 and 621. A number of minor yet unidentified residues (spots 2–4) as well as Ser259 (Fig. 1 B, c) were also phosphorylated at this time. Pretreatment with okadaic acid (100 nm; at this concentration a specific inhibitor of PP2A but not PP1α (47.Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar)), caused a slight increase in basal kinase activity (2-fold) and in Raf-1 phosphorylation in general. Notably, both the peptide pattern and the amount of activity associated with the Raf-1 immunoprecipitates are identical in cells treated with okadaic acid alone and in cells treated with CSF-1 for 15 min (Fig. 1, Aand B, compare c and d). This suggests that both positive and negative regulatory phosphorylation sites are targets of an okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase and that the balance between phosphorylation of the positive and negative regulatory sites determines the extent of Raf-1 activation. Remarkably, in the presence of okadaic acid, maximal Raf-1 stimulation by CSF-1 was prevented, and only a moderate (5–6-fold) activation could be obtained. Inhibition of early serine 621 dephosphorylation and hyperphosphorylation of several other sites (most prominently serine 259) could be observed concomitantly. Phosphorylation increased further after 15 min of CSF-1 stimulation; by this time, Raf-1 activation had decayed despite the continuous presence of the phosphatase inhibitor (Fig. 1, Aand B). Although these changes are complex, it can be appreciated that Ser259 and Ser621 are less phosphorylated (hypophosphorylated) in cells treated with CSF-1 alone than in cells treated with mitogen plus okadaic acid and that this “hypophosphorylation” correlates with maximal kinase activation. Thus, an okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase is involved in Raf-1 dephosphorylation and activation in macrophages. To determine whether okadaic acid influenced Raf-1 stimulation by receptor tyrosine kinases other than the CSF-1 receptor, we analyzed the effect of the inhibitor on COS-1 cells stimulated with EGF. In agreement with the data shown in Fig. 1 A, okadaic acid significantly decreased EGF-mediated activation of wild type Raf-1 (Fig. 2 A). To assess whether this effect depended on Ser259, COS-1 cells transfected with a Ser259 → Ala Raf-1 mutant (RafS259A) were treated with EGF in the presence or absence of okadaic acid. As described previously (12.Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Rommel C. Radziwill G. Moelling K. Hafen E. Mech. Dev. 1997; 64: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16.Tzivion G. Luo Z. Avruch J. Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 20.Baek K.H. Fabian J.R. Sprenger F. Morrison D.K. Ambrosio L. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22.Michaud N.R. Fabian J.R. Mathes K.D. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3390-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), the basal activity of RafS259A was modestly increased with respect to wild type Raf-1. EGF efficiently stimulated RafS259A, but in contrast with the wild type, activation of RafS259A was not decreased by pretreatment with okadaic acid (Fig.2 B). These data confirm the importance of the okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase in Raf-1 activation by receptor tyrosine kinases and identify Ser259 as the Raf-1 site relevant for activation. The effect of okadaic acid on the activation of wild type Raf-1 in EGF-treated COS-1 cells was less dramatic than the one observed in BAC-1.2F5 macrophages stimulated by CSF-1. It is possible that the importance of dephosphorylation in Raf-1 activation may vary depending on the cell type; alternatively, Raf-1 overexpression might adversely affect the outcome of the experiment, as is often the case when multienzyme complexes are involved (see below). Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that mitogen treatment induces a kinase that inactivates Raf-1 by phosphorylating Ser259 and is counteracted by an okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase. The strength of Raf-1 activation (or the proportion of Raf-1 molecules that can be activated) would depend on the balance between the activity of these two enzymes. Such a regulation would be particularly opportune in the case of Raf-1, whose moderate activation elicits proliferation, while a strong, prolonged Raf-1 signal leads to cell cycle arrest (48.Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5588-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 49.Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In line with this hypothesis, while this manuscript was in preparation, activated protein kinase B was shown to phosphorylate Ser259 of Raf-1, to suppress the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, and to shift a cell line from cell cycle arrest to proliferation (21.Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid specifically blocked Raf-1 activation at a concentration that selectively inhibits PP2A (47.Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether PP2A associated physically with Raf-1. Both the catalytic (PP2AC) and the regulatory (PR65) subunit of the PP2A core enzyme were detected in Raf-1 immunoprecipitates prepared from quiescent as well as CSF-1-treated cells. Neither PP2AC nor PR65 could be detected in precipitates prepared with nonimmune sera (lanes 1 and 2) or with protein A (Fig.3 A). In addition, significant amounts of Raf-1 were present in immunoprecipitates prepared with a monoclonal antibody against PP2AC but not with nonimmune mouse IgG (Fig. 3 B), demonstrating the specificity of the interaction. The ubiquitously expressed PP2A core heterodimer binds to different variable subunits of cellular or viral origins, which are involved in regulating its substrate specificity and/or localization. None of the cellular variable subunits tested (p55α and -β, and p72 plus p130) was present in Raf-1 immunoprecipitates (not shown). Consistent findings were obtained in fibroblasts stimulated with EGF (not shown). We next verified the interaction between Raf-1 and the PP2A heterodimer in COS-7 cells transfected with vectors directing the expression of HA-tagged PP2A subunits (Fig.4 A). Anti-HA immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with the HA-tagged PP2AC contained low amounts of endogenous PR65 and Raf-1 (Fig. 4 A,lane 1). Anti-HA immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with the HA-PR65, on the other hand, contained significant amounts of endogenous PP2AC subunit and more Raf-1 (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 1 and 2). Therefore, the amount of Raf-1 detected correlated with the amount of heterodimer present in the anti-HA immunoprecipitates. To confirm the specificity of the interaction between the HA-tagged PP2A subunits and Raf-1, we monitored the presence of Raf-1 in anti-HA immunoprecipitates from cells overexpressing HA-ERK (Fig. 4 B). Neither endogenous (lane 3) nor overexpressed Raf-1 (lane 4) could be detected in these immunoprecipitates. The Raf-1-PP2A complex formation was further analyzed by in vitro reconstitution experiments with purified proteins (Fig.4 C). GST-tagged Raf was expressed in Sf-9 cells alone or in combination with v-Ras plus Lck in order to activate it (Raf*). Raf proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with PR65, PP2AC, or the heterodimer PR65-PP2AC. Consistent with the lack of effect of mitogens on in vivo complex formation, we did not observe significant differences between PP2A binding to Raf or Raf*. PP2AC displayed only weak binding to Raf-1. In contrast, both PR65 and the core heterodimer associated strongly. Thus, as it is the case for cellular and viral subunits (28.Kamibayashi C. Mumby M.C. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1995; 9: 195-210Google Scholar), PR65 probably plays the key role in the association between Raf-1 and the PP2A heterodimer. This association, however, is not likely to be direct. Raf-1 does not interact with PR65, PP2AC, or p55 in the yeast two-hybrid system, 2J. Rüth, V. Janssens, J. Goris, and M. Baccarini, unpublished observation. and size fractionation experiments indicate that in vivo Raf-1 and PP2A are part of a large protein complex (data not shown). Additional proteins, and possibly a variable subunit not detected in our experiments, might also be present in small amounts in the purified enzyme preparations used in the GST pull-down experiments and might be facilitating or even mediating the interaction observed in vitro. In this context, a variable subunit of PP2A has been recently shown to positively regulate Ras signaling upstream ofraf during vulval development in Caenorhabditis elegans (50.Sieburth D.S. Sundaram M. Howard R.M. Han M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2562-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Concentrations of okadaic acid that specifically affect PP2A reduced Raf-1 activation, and PP2A was found in Raf-1 immunoprecipitates from quiescent and mitogen-treated cells. Therefore, while an effect of the drug on other phosphatases cannot be formally excluded, PP2A presumably represents the okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase involved in Raf-1 regulation. Our current working model is that Raf-1-associated PP2A facilitates kinase activation by maintaining Ser259 in a dephosphorylated state and thereby preventing the formation of inactive 14-3-3-Raf-1 complexes (14.Aitken A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 15.Rommel C. Radziwill G. Moelling K. Hafen E. Mech.

This may permit the activation of a larger number of Raf-1 molecules and prolong it by counteracting the mitogen-induced kinase (probably protein kinase B) that phosphorylates Ser259. Ultimately, the Ser259 kinase must outpace PP2A to terminate Raf-1 activation. Inhibition of PP2A by okadaic acid has been reported to selectively impair Raf-dependent transformation (51.Sakai R. Ikeda I. Kitani H. Fujiki H. Takaku F. Rapp U. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9946-9950Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in genetically dissectable organisms, hypomorphic alleles of PP2A suppress the effects of activated Raf (52.Wassarman D.A. Solomon N.M. Chang H.C. Karim F.D. Therrien M. Rubin G.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) or enhance the loss of function phenotype of Raf mutations (50.Sieburth D.S. Sundaram M. Howard R.M. Han M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2562-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). On the basis of these results, PP2A might have been considered either a Raf-1 effector or a positive regulator of Raf-1 activation. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for these observations. By identifying PP2A as a positive regulator of Raf-1, our data define a new function for this phosphatase and add a new facet to the complexity of Raf-1 regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2031663420,"Caveolins form interlocking networks on the cytoplasmic face of caveolae. The cytoplasmically directed N and C termini of caveolins are separated by a central hydrophobic segment, which is believed to form a hairpin within the membrane. Here, we report that the caveolin scaffolding domain (CSD, residues 82-101), and the C terminus (residues 135-178) of caveolin-1 are each sufficient to anchor green fluorescent protein (GFP) to membranes in vivo. We also show that the first 16 residues of the C terminus (i.e. residues 135-150) are necessary and sufficient to attach GFP to membranes. When fused to the caveolin-1 C terminus, GFP co-localizes with two trans-Golgi markers and is excluded from caveolae. In contrast, the CSD targets GFP to caveolae, albeit less efficiently than full-length caveolin-1. Thus, caveolin-1 contains at least two membrane attachment signals: the CSD, dictating caveolar localization, and the C terminus, driving trans-Golgi localization. Additionally, we find that caveolin-1 oligomer/oligomer interactions require the distal third of the caveolin-1 C terminus. Thus, the caveolin-1 C-terminal domain has two separate functions: (i) membrane attachment (proximal third) and (ii) protein/protein interactions (distal third)."

A full-length cDNA encoding Siglec-9 was isolated from a dibutyryl cAMP-treated HL-60 cell cDNA library. Siglec-9 is predicted to contain three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains that comprise an N-terminal V-set domain and two C2-set domains, a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail containing two putative tyrosine-based signaling motifs. Overall, Siglec-9 is ∼80% identical in amino acid sequence to Siglec-7, suggesting that the genes encoding these two proteins arose relatively recently by gene duplication. Binding assays showed that, similar to Siglec-7, Siglec-9 recognized sialic acid in either the α2,3- or α2,6-glycosidic linkage to galactose. Using a specific mAb, Siglec-9 was found to be expressed at high or intermediate levels by monocytes, neutrophils, and a minor population of CD16+, CD56− cells. Weaker expression was observed on ∼50% of B cells and NK cells and minor subsets of CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells.

Despite their sequence similarity, all novel Siglecs characterized to date are expressed on distinct subsets of hemopoietic cells, such as neutrophils (Siglec-5) (4.Cornish A.L. Freeman S. Forbes G.

These differences in expression and ligand binding suggest that each Siglec mediates a specific, nonredundant function in hemopoietic cell biology. The cytoplasmic tails of most CD33-related Siglecs contain two homologous tyrosine-based motifs, one of which fits the consensus for immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) (11.Bolland S. Ravetch J.V. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 72: 149-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of one or more ITIMs has been described in a growing number of other leukocyte membrane receptors, many of which are tightly linked to CD33-related Siglecs on chromosome 19q13.4, in a region known as the leukocyte receptor cluster (12.Wende H. Colonna M. Ziegler A. Volz A. Mammal. Gen. 1999; 10: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The consensus that has emerged is that receptors bearing ITIMs mediate inhibitory functions when co-cross-linked with activating receptors bearing tyrosine based activatory motifs (reviewed in Ref. 11.Bolland S. Ravetch J.V. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 72: 149-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This has been shown to be due to tyrosine phosphorylation of the ITIMs, leading to recruitment and activation of intracellular phosphatases, either the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, or the inositol phosphatase, SHIP (reviewed in Ref. 11.Bolland S. Ravetch J.V. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 72: 149-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From the limited studies that have been carried out so far, CD33 and related Siglecs appear to behave similarly in mediating inhibitory signals. Taylor and co-workers (13.Taylor V.C. Buckley C.D. Douglas M. Cody A.J. Simmons D.L. Freeman S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11505-11512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) showed that the tyrosine residues of both motifs in CD33 can be phosphorylated by Src-like kinases following antibody-induced cross-linking and that this leads to recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2. The potential functional significance of tyrosine phosphorylation and SHP-1 recruitment by these novel Siglecs was first demonstrated by Falco and colleagues (6.Falco M. Biassoni R. Bottino C. Vitale M. Sivori S. Augugliaro R. Moretta L. Moretta A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) who identified Siglec-7 as p75/AIRM1, a receptor that could inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity. In a separate study of mononuclear phagocytes, it was shown that co-cross-linking of CD33 with the CD64 high affinity Fc receptor led to reduced CD64-dependent calcium fluxing as a result of SHP-1 recruitment and activation (14.Ulyanova T. Blasioli J. Woodford-Thomas T.A. Thomas M.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3440-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this paper we describe the properties and expression pattern of Siglec-9, a new member of the Siglec family highly related to Siglec-7. When expressed at the cell surface, Siglec-9 exhibits sialic acid-dependent binding to human red blood cells and synthetic sialoglycoconjugates. Using a specific monoclonal antibody, we demonstrate that, unlike other Siglecs characterized previously, Siglec-9 is expressed quite broadly among human blood leukocytes, being found on monocytes, neutrophils, B cells, NK cells, and minor subsets of T cells. Unless specified otherwise, all reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma. 125I-Streptavidin (20–40 mCi/mg) and protein A-Sepharose were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Vibrio cholerae sialidase was purchased from Calbiochem. Biotinylated polyacrylamide (PAA) glycoconjugates carrying either NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4Glc (2,3-PAA) or NeuAcα2,6Galβ1,4Glc (2,6-PAA), were obtained from Syntesome (Munich, Germany). These conjugates have a molecular mass of ∼30 kDa and contain 20% mol of saccharide and 5% mol of biotin. Phycoerythrin-conjugated mAbs against the following human CD antigens were purchased from Serotec (Kidlington, United Kingdom): CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16, CD19, CD56. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated F(ab)2 anti-mouse IgG was from Dako (Cambridge, UK). Based on a Siglec-like genomic sequence deposited in GenBank (accession number AF135027), a dibutyryl cAMP-treated HL-60 cDNA library kindly provided by Dr. D. L. Simmons was used to isolate a full-length cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following forward and reverse primers (5′-3′): AACCCCAGACATGCTGCTGCTGCTG and CATATGGTTATCATAGCTCATCACGT. The PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) and sequenced. The full-length sequence is available in GenBank under accession number AF247180. A human Multiple Tissue Northern blot containing approximately 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane from various human tissues was purchased from Origene Technologies Ltd. (Rockville, MD) and hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe corresponding to a region of Siglec-9 (bases 960–1522) that was predicted not to cross-hybridize with mRNA encoding the other highly related Siglecs. The following cell lines were provided by the ICRF Cell Production Service: COS-1, Chinese hamster ovary K1 (CHO), KG1b, K562, HL-60, U937, and THP-1. Daudi, Ramos, Jurkat, HUT78, JY, and MonoMac6 were provided by Dr. Craig Stocks (Dundee University). YT cells were provided by Dr. Gillian Griffiths (Oxford University). CHO cells stably expressing Siglec-7 (Siglec-7-CHO) were prepared as described previously (5.Nicoll G. Ni J. Liu D. Klenerman P. Munday J. Dubock S. Mattei M.G. Crocker P.R. J. Biol.

COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. CHO cells were cultured in Ham's F10 medium with 5% fetal calf serum and all other cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 5 or 10% fetal calf serum. Human red blood cells were obtained from healthy donors and stored at 4 °C in Alsever's solution for up to 2 weeks. Human blood leukocytes were obtained from whole blood by dextran sedimentation followed by lysis of contaminating red blood cells. Mononuclear fractions for flow cytometry were obtained by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A construct encoding CD33-Fc was provided by Dr. D. L. Simmons. Constructs encoding Siglec-5-Fc and Siglec-8-Fc proteins were generated as described previously (4.Cornish A.L. Freeman S. Forbes G. Ni J. Zhang M. Cepeda M. Gentz R. Augustus M. Carter K.C.

Constructs encoding Siglec-7-Fc and Siglec-9-Fc proteins were prepared using a modified version of the pEE14 vector (15.Bebbington C. Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. 2. Academic Press, London1991: 136-145Google Scholar), designated pEE14-3C-Fc. To prepare pEE14-3C-Fc, the BamHI site of pEE14 was first ablated and a HindIII-XbaI fragment from pIG1-3C-Fc vector (16.Karow J. Hudson K.R. Hall M.A. Vernallis A.B. Taylor J.A. Gossler A. Heath J.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was introduced (generously provided by Prof. J. Heath, Birmingham University). This fragment encodes a rhinovirus protease 3C cleavage site followed by human IgG1Fc region. For Siglec-7-Fc, the entire extracellular region was amplified by PCR using the following forward and reverse primers (5′ to 3′): ACAAGCTTGCACCTCCAACCCCAGATATG and ACGGATCCACTTACCTGTCCTCATTTTGCCTGTGTACTCCTG. The PCR product was digested with HindIII and BamHI and cloned into the pEE14-3C-Fc vector. For Siglec-9-Fc, aHindIII-BamHI fragment encoding the leader peptide of human CD33 (17.Simmons D.L. Seed B. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2797-2800PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into the corresponding sites of pEE14-3C-Fc. The resulting vector was designated pEE14-33L-3C-Fc. cDNA encoding the extracellular region (not including the leader peptide) of Siglec-9 was amplified by PCR using the following forward and reverse primers (5′ to 3′): CTCGGATTCCAAGTAAACTGCTGCACGATGC and CCCGGATCCACTTACCTGTTGATGTGGCTTTGCTCTGCAA. The PCR product was cut withBamHI and cloned into the BamHI site of pEE14-33L-3C-Fc. Stable CHO cell lines secreting Siglec-Fc proteins were prepared following standard methods (15.Bebbington C. Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. 2. Academic Press, London1991: 136-145Google Scholar). Balb/c mice were immunized three times with 10 μg of Siglec-9-Fc and spleen cells fused with the SP2 myeloma using standard methods (18.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 139-243Google Scholar). Hybridoma supernatants that reacted with Siglec-9-Fc, but not Siglec-7-Fc, were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In brief, Siglec-7-Fc or Siglec-9-Fc at 1 μg/ml were immobilized to wells of microtiter plates coated with goat anti-human IgG1 (Fc-specific). Putative anti-Siglec-9 hybridoma supernatants were added to either Siglec-7-Fc or Siglec-9-Fc-coated wells and binding of the mAbs detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. The alkaline phosphatase substrate, fluorescein diphosphate, was added and the fluorescent product measured on a Perceptive Biosystems Cytofluor II fluorescent plate reader. A single positive hybridoma was identified and cloned four times by limiting dilution. The anti-Siglec-9 mAb was designated K8 (IgG1(κ)) and was used as a tissue culture supernatant in all experiments. These were carried out as described previously (19.Kelm S. Pelz A. Schauer R. Filbin M.T. Tang S. de Bellard M.E. Schnaar R.L. Mahoney J.A. Hartnell A. Bradfield P. Crocker P.R. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 965-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-1 cells were sham-transfected or transfected with cDNA encoding full-length Siglec-9 or Siglec-7 used as a positive control. After 3 days, COS cells were sialidase-treated or untreated and human red blood cells, either sialidase-treated or untreated, were added. Rosetting was assessed by microscopy after thorough washing to remove unbound red blood cells. CHO cells stably expressing Siglec-9 (Siglec-9-CHO) were generated by transfection with full-length Siglec-9 cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). G418-resistant CHO cell clones expressing Siglec-9 were identified by their ability to bind anti-Siglec-9 mAb. Binding assays with PAA glycoconjugates were carried out as described previously (5.Nicoll G. Ni J. Liu D. Klenerman P. Munday J. Dubock S. Mattei M.G. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34089-34095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Briefly, Siglec-9-CHO or wild-type CHO cells were sialidase-treated to remove cell surface sialic acids that could mask the binding site of Siglec-9 and then incubated with saturating concentrations (20 μg/ml) of various PAA conjugates. After 1 h, cells were washed and binding of PAA conjugates detected by incubation with 125I-streptavidin. Single and double labeling experiments were performed following standard protocols (20.Kantor A.B. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A. Weir D.M. Herzenberg L.A. Blackwell C. Weir's Handbook of Experimental Immunology. II. Blackwell Science, Oxford1997: 49.1-49.13Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde and analyzed on a Becton-Dickinson FACSort. A full-length cDNA encoding a novel Siglec-like protein was isolated by PCR from a dibutyryl cAMP-treated HL-60 cDNA library using primers derived from the sequence of a Siglec-like gene (GenBank accession numberAF135027). This gene was previously identified during characterization of novel human kallikrein-like genes located on chromosome 19q13.3-4 (21.Yousef G.M. Luo L.Y. Diamandis E.P.

However, a small number of differences were found in the coding sequence (not shown), only one of which resulted in a change in the protein sequence, with a conservative substitution of Arg269 to His269(Fig. 1). There are 8 potential N-linked glycosylation sites and a cytoplasmic tail of 94 amino acids. Overall, the coding sequence of Siglec-9 is ∼84% identical to that of Siglec-7, the homology extending throughout the extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular regions (Fig. 1). Siglec-9 contains most of the characteristic features of the Siglec subgroup of Ig superfamily proteins. These include the critical arginine at position 120 that interacts with the carboxyl group of sialic acid and the unusual pattern of cysteines in domains 1 and 2 that form intra-β sheet and inter-domain disulfide bonds (22.May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 719-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Interestingly, unlike Siglecs described previously, Siglec-9 is predicted to lack the first of the two aromatic residues that has been shown in sialoadhesin to be important for interacting with theN-acetyl moiety at the C-5 position of sialic acid (22.May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 719-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Since Siglec-9 binds sialic acids with a specificity that is similar to other Siglecs (see below), the aromatic residue on the A strand cannot be an obligatory requirement for sialic acid binding by Siglecs. This would also be consistent with studies showing that naturally occurring and artificial modifications of sialic acid at the C-5 position can result in marked differences in Siglec recognition (23.Kelm S.

Within the cytoplasmic tail, there are two conserved, putative tyrosine-based signaling motifs typical of the majority of CD33-related Siglecs (Fig. 1). The membrane proximal motif, LQYASL, fits the ITIM consensus, (L/I/V/S)XYXX(L/V), and is similar to the corresponding motif in CD33, LHYASL, which has been shown to be dominant in tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of SHP-1 (13.Taylor V.C.

Woodford-Thomas T.A. Thomas M.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3440-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and SHP-2 (13.Taylor V.C. Buckley C.D. Douglas M. Cody A.J. Simmons D.L. Freeman S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11505-11512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In comparison, the membrane distal motif, TEYSEI does not fit the ITIM consensus but is similar to the membrane distal motif of CD33, TEYSEV, which can also be tyrosine phosphorylated and interact weakly with SHP-1 and SHP-2 (13.Taylor V.C. Buckley C.D. Douglas M. Cody A.J. Simmons D.L. Freeman S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11505-11512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These sequence similarities strongly suggest that Siglec-9 can also become phosphorylated and interact with tyrosine phosphatases, but further experiments are required to explore this possibility. To investigate the potential sialic acid binding properties of Siglec-9, we initially performed binding assays in which native and sialidase-treated human red blood cells were added to transiently transfected COS cells. In contrast to Siglec-7 (5.Nicoll G. Ni J. Liu D. Klenerman P. Munday J. Dubock S. Mattei M.G. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34089-34095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), no binding could be detected unless the COS cells were treated with sialidase before the binding assays (data not shown). Sialidase treatment is thought to remove potentially inhibitory sialic acids in the COS cell glycocalyx that interact with the Siglec-binding sites in cis. It is currently unclear how Siglec-7 expressed on COS or CHO cells mediates high levels of binding without a requirement for sialidase pretreatment, but this is a feature that is not apparently shared by Siglec-9, despite the high degree of sequence identity shared between the two molecules (Fig. 1). Although the binding site of Siglec-9 appears to be masked on transfected COS cells, a recent report (26.Razi N. Varki A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that unmasking could occur on activated cells that naturally express the receptor. To determine the sialic acid linkage preference of Siglec-9, binding assays were carried out with synthetic polyacrylamide conjugates using CHO cells that had been sialidase-treated to remove the inhibitory sialic acids (Fig. 2). Under these conditions, sialidase-treated wild-type CHO cells showed no detectable binding to glycoconjugates whereas sialidase-treated CHO cells stably expressing Siglec-9 bound similarly to glycoconjugates carrying sialic acid in either α2,3- or α2,6-linkages. Therefore, the binding specificity of Siglec-9 appears to be similar to that of Siglec-5 and Siglec-7 (4.Cornish A.L. Freeman S. Forbes G. Ni J. Zhang M. Cepeda M. Gentz R. Augustus M. Carter K.C. Crocker P.R. Blood. 1998; 92: 2123-2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Nicoll G. Ni J. Liu D. Klenerman P. Munday J. Dubock S. Mattei M.G. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34089-34095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A human multiple tissue Northern blot was probed with a Siglec-9 specific cDNA probe that was predicted not to cross-hybridize with other Siglecs (Fig.3). A clear signal at ∼1.8 kilobases was observed with spleen and placenta but Siglec-9 mRNA was low or undetectable in liver, colon, stomach, and testis (Fig. 3). The presence of readily detectable mRNA transcripts in spleen and placenta is consistent with the possibility that Siglec-9 is expressed on hemopoietic cells since these organs are rich in leukocytes. To investigate expression of Siglec-9 at the cellular level, a Siglec-9-specific mAb, K8, was isolated. Given the high degree of sequence similarity between Siglec-9 and Siglec-7 it was important to rule out cross-reactivity of K8 with Siglec-7. Using stably transfected CHO cell lines expressing either Siglec-7 or Siglec-9, FACS assays showed clearly that K8 does not cross-react with Siglec-7 (Fig.4). Likewise, the anti-Siglec-7 mAb, S7 described previously (5.Nicoll G. Ni J. Liu D. Klenerman P. Munday J. Dubock S. Mattei M.G. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34089-34095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), does not cross-react with Siglec-9 expressed on CHO cells (Fig. 4). The potential cross-reactivity of K8 with Siglecs-3, -5, -7, and -8 was also investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using Siglec-Fc proteins. No reactivity of K8 with any other Siglecs was observed, despite high binding to the relevant mAbs (data not shown). Thus, K8 appears to be specific for Siglec-9. Next, a detailed analysis of the expression of Siglec-9 on human peripheral blood leukocytes was carried out by flow cytometry. Expression on granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes was compared by gating cells according to their characteristic forward and side scatter properties (not shown). With granulocytes, ∼97% of cells expressed intermediate levels of Siglec-9 (Fig.5 A). In comparison, 100% of monocytes were strongly positive. Since granulocytes contain mostly neutrophils, together with a small percentage of eosinophils, we asked whether Siglec-9 is absent from the eosinophils by carrying out double labeling in conjunction with anti-CD16, a low affinity Fc receptor that is expressed at low levels on eosinophils (7.Floyd H. Ni J. Cornish A.L. Zeng Z. Liu D. Carter K.C. Steel J. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 861-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This showed that, similar to Siglec-5 (7.Floyd H. Ni J. Cornish A.L. Zeng Z. Liu D. Carter K.C. Steel J. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 861-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), Siglec-9 is expressed on all neutrophils but is absent from eosinophils (data not shown). Interestingly, the expression of Siglecs-5 and -9 on granulocytes is reciprocal to that of Siglec-8 which is only found on eosinophils (7.Floyd H. Ni J. Cornish A.L. Zeng Z. Liu D. Carter K.C. Steel J. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 861-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). With lymphocytes, two distinct labeled populations could be identified. ∼26% of cells in the lymphocyte gate were weakly labeled with anti-Siglec-9, while ∼2.5% were strongly labeled (Fig. 5 A). To characterize the lymphocyte-reactive subsets in more detail, double labeling was carried out by combining staining for Siglec-9 with staining for CD3 (pan T cell), CD4 (T cell subset), CD8 (T cell subsets and NK cells), CD19 (pan B cell), CD16 (NK cells), and CD56 (NK cells) (Fig.5 B). Depending on the donor, the weakly labeled cells contained ∼2% of the CD4-high T cells, ∼5% of the CD8-high T cells, ∼50% of CD8-mid NK cells, ∼50% of the CD19+ B cells, ∼50% of the CD56+ NK cells, and ∼50% of the CD16+ NK cells. The strongly labeled cells in the lymphocyte gate were mostly made up of CD16-high cells (Fig.5 B). Surprisingly, these cells also expressed low levels of CD4, but they do not appear to be contaminating CD4+monocytes because a monocyte marker, CD14, was absent from these cells (data not shown). Furthermore, this Siglec-9+, CD16-high subset of cells was also negative for Siglec-7 (data not shown) which is expressed by monocytes (5.Nicoll G. Ni J. Liu D. Klenerman P. Munday J. Dubock S. Mattei M.G. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34089-34095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Currently, the nature of these cells is not known. However, they were not labeled with CD56 or CD8 (Fig.5 B) and may correspond to a minor population of CD16+, CD56− cells (27.Lanier L.L. Le A.M. Civin C.I. Loken M.R. Phillips J.H. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 4480-4486PubMed Google Scholar) that were shown previously to have morphological features of NK cells and exhibit low levels of natural cytotoxicity (28.McKenzie R.S. Simms P.E. Helfrich B.A. Fisher R.I. Ellis T.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6318-6322PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, FACS staining of various human leukemic cell lines was performed. Weak positive labeling was observed with the U937 promonocytic cell line (data not shown). No staining was seen with the other cell lines studied: KG1b (immature myeloid), HL-60 (myelomonocytic), MonoMac-6 (monocytic), THP-1 (monocytic), K562 (erythromyeloid), YT (NK-like), Daudi (B cell), Ramos (B cell), JY (B cell), HUT78 (T cell), and Jurkat (T cell) (data not shown). The failure of the myeloid cell lines, HL-60, MonoMac-6, and THP-1, to express Siglec-9 was surprising given the high levels on blood monocytes and neutrophils. Since the Siglec-9 cDNA was isolated from a dibutyryl cAMP-treated HL-60 cell library, it is possible that terminal differentiation of myeloid cells is required for Siglec-9 gene expression. An alternative possibility is suggested by the recent finding that treatment of normal hemopoietic progenitors and leukemic myeloid cells with anti-Siglec-3 or anti-Siglec-7 mAbs resulted in inhibition of cell growth (29.Vitale C. Romagnani C. Falco M. Ponte M. Vitale M. Moretta A. Bacigalupo A. Moretta L. Mingari M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15091-15096Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). If naturally occurring ligation of Siglec-9 expressed by leukemic cells also inhibits cell growth, this could lead to selective expansion of variant cells that express low, non-inhibitory levels of Siglec-9. Further experiments are needed to investigate these possibilities. The results presented here with Siglec-9 extend the theme established previously, that the CD33-related Siglecs are expressed on distinct subsets of hemopoietic cells. It is striking that the ITIM-containing members of this subgroup are found at highest levels on effector cells of the innate immune system, namely neutrophils, monocytes, and NK cells. Siglec-9 is the first example of a Siglec being expressed on all three cell populations. Given that other related leukocyte receptors with ITIMs are important in negative regulation of cellular activation events (11.Bolland S. Ravetch J.V. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 72: 149-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that the ITIM-containing Siglecs mediate similar functions via sialic acid recognition. It is thought that sialic acids appeared relatively late in evolution, being absent from many potential pathogens (30.Kelm S. Schauer R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 175: 137-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Schauer R. Kamerling J. Montreuil J.V.J. Schachter H. Glycoproteins II. Elsevier, Amsterdam1997: 243-402Google Scholar, 32.Varki A. Varki A. Cummings R. Esko J. Freeze H. Hart G. Marth J. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 195-209Google Scholar). In addition to their well recognized roles in cell-cell repulsion and masking of subterminal sugars (30.Kelm S. Schauer R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 175: 137-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Schauer R. Kamerling J. Montreuil J.V.J. Schachter H. Glycoproteins II. Elsevier, Amsterdam1997: 243-402Google Scholar, 32.Varki A. Varki A. Cummings R. Esko J. Freeze H. Hart G. Marth J. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 195-209Google Scholar), it is conceivable that sialic acids have evolved to function as molecular determinants of “self.” Thus, sialic acid-dependent ligation of Siglecs could provide a mechanism that contributes to the setting of appropriate thresholds for cellular activation. This could help prevent undesirable self-reactivity and tissue damage, while at the same time permitting effective killing of non-sialylated pathogens. The results reported here are in good agreement with another paper on Siglec-9 published by Angata and Varki (Angata, T., and Varki, A. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275,22127–22135) in this issue of the Journal.

All the matrixins have a propeptide domain containing the highly conserved cysteine switch sequence PRCG(V/N)PD and a catalytic domain with a zinc-binding motif, HEXXHXXGXXH (1.Nagase H.

We report a novel member of the matrixin family, endometase (MMP-26), which was cloned from human endometrial tumor cDNA library. Its mRNA was detected only in human uterus tissue among all the human tissues tested. Endometase has a pro-domain with a unique cysteine switch sequence, P H CGVPDGSD, and a catalytic domain with the common zinc-binding motif. This new MMP has a different substrate profile from other closely similar MMPs. Endometase selectively cleaves rat tail tendon type I (RTTI) gelatin and human plasma α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1-PI). Our data show that endometase is an authentic new member of the MMP family with unique biochemical characteristics and substrate specificities. Endometase may be tissue-specific and may have unique biological and pathological functions. Human α1-antitrypsin (α1-PI) and most chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma. Human matrilysin, stromelysin, and recombinant catalytic domain of collagenase-3 (cd-collagenase-3) were kindly provided by Drs. Harold E. van Wart of Roche Bioscience, L. Jack Windsor of Indiana University, and Harald Tschesche of the University of Bielefeld, respectively. Recombinant rabbit catalytic domain of metalloelastase (cd-metalloelastase) was kindly provided by Dr. C. Bruun Schiødt, OsteoPro A/S. A data base of more than three million expressed sequence tags (ESTs) was obtained from over 750 different cDNA libraries. This data base has been generated through the combined efforts of Human Genome Science Inc. and the Institute for Genomic Research using high throughput automated DNA sequence analysis of randomly selected human cDNA clones (9.Ni J. Fernandez M.A. Danielsson L. Chillakuru R.A. Zhang J. Grubb A. Su J. Gentz R. Abrahamson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24797-24804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Sequence homology comparisons of each EST were performed against the GenBankTM data base using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) and BLASTN (BLAST for nucleic acid) algorithms (10.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69631) Google Scholar). A specific homology and motif search using the known amino acid sequence of matrilysin against this human EST data base revealed several ESTs that had translated sequences with >38% identity to that of matrilysin. One clone, HETBW05, from human endometrial tumor cDNA library encoding an intact N-terminal signal peptide and the full-length protein was selected for further investigation. This EST was sequenced on both strands to the 3′ end, and its homology to matrilysin was confirmed. Five Northern blot membranes containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNAs per lane from human multiple tissues, human immune system, and human cancer cell lines were purchased from CLONTECH. Two μg of 2.0-kb human β-actin poly(A)+ RNAs per lane was a positive control for all the Northern blot membranes. The membrane was probed with32P-labeled HETBW05 cDNA probe and the human β-actin cDNA positive control probe. Northern blotting was performed with the ExpressHybTM hybridization solution (PT1190–1) fromCLONTECH following the manufacturer's manual. The full-length open reading frame of HETBW05 was amplified using standard polymerase chain reaction techniques with primers corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ sequences of the open reading frame (5′ restriction site, BglII; 5′ primer, GAGCGCagatctGCCATCATGCAGCTCGTCATCTT; 3′ restriction site,XbaI; 3′ primer, CGGTGCtctagaTTAAGGTATGTCAGATGAACAT). The amplified fragment was purified and digested with BglII andXbaI followed by a second purification. A tag-free construct for expression of pro-endometase in pET-20b(+) (Novagen) was generated by restriction enzyme digestion using the NdeI andXhoI restriction sites. Doubly cleaved vector and inserts with cohesive ends were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated by T4 DNA ligase. All the clones were verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids were propagated in TOP10F′ competent cells (Invitrogen) and then transformed into BL21 (DE3)-competent E. coli cells (Novagen) for expression according to the manufacturer's instructions. The majority of endometase was expressed in the form of inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were isolated and purified using the B-PERTM bacterial protein extraction reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The insoluble protein was dissolved in 8 m urea at about 5 mg/ml. The protein was diluted to 100 μg/ml in 8 m urea and 10 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h, dialyzed in 4 murea, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tricine, pH 7.5, for 2 h, and then folded by dialysis in 50 mmHEPES, 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 20 μm ZnSO4, 0.05% Brij-35, pH 7.5, for 16 h. Several other folding conditions were also tested. Anti-human endometase peptide polyclonal antibodies were developed in rabbits as described (11.Li H. Bauzon D.E. Xu X. Tschesche H. Cao J. Sang Q.A. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 22: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Polyclonalantibody against endometase peptide starting from residue 188 (pAb-E188) was directed against a peptide just a few residues upstream the zinc binding site,188DKNEHWSASDTGYN201 of the prepro-enzyme. Using BLAST search method at the National Center for Biotechnology Information web site against all of the sequences in the data banks, no peptide with >45% level of identity was found. Thus, the antibody against this peptide should be very specific. Western blot analysis and SDS-PAGE experiments characterizing different refolded enodmetase samples were performed as described previously (11.Li H. Bauzon D.E. Xu X. Tschesche H. Cao J. Sang Q.A.

The first four are MMP substrates, and the last one is a substrate of the tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE). Substrates were prepared as 50–500 μm stock solution in 1:1 dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and water. Fluorescent assays were performed at λexcitation = 328 nm and λemission = 393 nm using a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B luminescence spectrometer equipped with a constant-temperature water bath. The relationship between fluorescence units and nmol of product produced was determined from the fluorescence value obtained when all the substrate was hydrolyzed. Assays for obtaining kinetic parameters were performed at 25 °C in 10 mm CaCl2, 0.2m NaCl, and 0.05% Brij-35 in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, over a substrate concentration range of 1–4 μm and an enzyme concentration range of 0.06–50 nm under steady-state conditions. Stock solutions of MMPs were diluted to 1–500 nm by adding 50 mm HEPES buffer containing 10 mm CaCl2, 0.2 m NaCl, and 0.05% Brij-35 or 50 mm Tricine buffer with the same constituents. A typical assay was carried out by incubating 186 μl of buffer solution and 4 μl of substrate solution in an assay cuvette at least for 15 min at 25 °C and then adding 10 μl of enzyme solution to the assay cuvette. Initial hydrolysis rates were monitored for 10–30 min. By searching EST data bases, we found one clone, HETBW05, from a human endometrial tumor cDNA library, that encodes a MMP homologue with an intact N-terminal signal peptide. This clone was not found in any other cDNA libraries derived from other human tissues/cells. The protein expressed from this clone was selected for further investigation, and it was named endometase (forendometrial tumor-derived matrixmetalloproteinase). The cDNA nucleotide and deduced protein sequences of the full-length clone encoding human endometase are shown in Fig.1. Those sequences were submitted to GenBankTM with accession number AF248646. The signal peptide sequence was predicted according to its homology to other MMPs and using the PSORT computer program. The activation cleavage site between the propeptide domain and the catalytic domain was predicted according to its homology to other MMPs (18.Sang Q.A. Douglas D.A. J. Protein Chem. 1996; 15: 137-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Endometase has a unique histidine residue instead of an arginine residue in the cysteine switch sequence (P H CGVPDGSD). All other MMPs have an arginine residue at that position. In addition, endometase has the MMP zinc-binding consensus sequence in the catalytic domain. The endometase protein sequence was scanned against the GenBankTM data bases, and all of the sequences with significant relatedness to the new sequence were identified. The endometase protein sequence was compared with those of five most similar human MMPs, macrophage metalloelastase (MMP-12, GenBankTM accession number P39900) (19.Shapiro S.D. Kobayashi D.K.

The endometase catalytic domain is 54, 51, 49, 48, and 46% identical to those of MMP-12, -3, -13, -20, and -7, respectively. Its full length is 43, 41, 41, 39, and 39% identical to those of MMP-12, -3, -13, -20, and -7, respectively (Table I). All of the above cDNA and protein sequence information indicates that endometase is a new member of the MMP family.Figure 2Multiple sequence alignment of human endometase and five most similar human MMPs.

The numbers are percentage identity and (in parentheses) similarity. Tissue expression distribution of endometase mRNA was examined. Five Northern blots were purchased from CLONTECH. Blot 1 contains poly(A)+RNAs from human multiple tissues, spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine, colon (mucosal lining), and peripheral blood leukocytes. Blot 2 contains poly(A)+ RNAs from human heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas. Blot 3 contains poly(A)+ RNAs from human immune system tissues, spleen, lymph node, thymus, appendix, peripheral blood leukocytes, bone marrow, and fetal liver. Blot 4 contains poly(A)+ RNAs from human cancer cell lines, promyelocytic leukemia HL-60, HeLa cell S3, chronic myelogenous leukemia K-562, lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4, Burkitt's lymphoma Raji, colorectal adenocarcinoma SW480, lung carcinoma A549, and melanoma G361. Blot 5 contains poly(A)+ RNAs from human spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, uterus, small intestine, colon (mucosal lining), and peripheral blood leukocytes. 2 kb of human β-actin poly(A)+ RNA per lane was a positive control for all the Northern blot membranes. The membrane was probed with both 32P-labeled HETBW05 cDNA probe and the human β-actin cDNA positive control probe. Except for 2-kb β-actin bands, no detectable band was found in blots 1–4. Endometase mRNA was expressed only by human uterus as a 1.03-kb band (Fig. 3) in blot 5; it was not expressed in any other human tissues or human cancer cells tested. Because endometrium is the mucous membrane lining of the uterus, these data demonstrate that endometase may be uterus-specific. The pro-endometase inclusion bodies were isolated and purified using B-PERTM bacterial protein extraction and purification reagent. Lysozyme was used for preparation of the inclusion bodies. This method allowed us to obtain highly homogenous endometase from the inclusion bodies as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE silver stain gel and immunoblot analysis using our anti-catalytic domain peptide antibody (pAb-E188) (data not shown). The purified recombinant pro-endometase was partially activated containing both latent (28 kDa) and active (19 kDa) species during the folding process. The specificity of pAb-E188 was verified because it did not recognize human stromelysin, collagenase-1, collagenase-3, matrilysin, MT1-MMP, gelatinase A, or gelatinase B (data not shown). Protein N-terminal sequencing further confirmed that we have isolated the pro-endometase with one extra initiation codon coded methionine residue, MVPVPPAADH. Heat-denatured RTTI collagen (gelatin) was cleaved slowly by endometase compared with that by matrilysin (Fig. 4). 275 ng of endometase and matrilysin was incubated with 4 mg/ml gelatin for 0, 1, 2, and 3 days at 37 °C in 100 μl of assay buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, and 0.05% Brij-35, pH 7.5. Endometase cleaved RTTI gelatin and generated three-quarter, one-quarter, and other fragments of α1(I) and α2(I) subunits. However, endometase did not cleave RTTI collagen, mouse type IV collagen, laminin, bovine elastin, β-casein, or human milk lactoferrin, demonstrating that the endometase cleavage of type I gelatin is specific. Human plasma α1-PI (63 kDa) was cleaved by endometase and generated a visible band at about 58 kDa (Fig.5). Both the 63- and the 58-kDa protein bands have the same sequence, EDPQGDAAQK, as determined by the N-terminal sequencing technique, suggesting that α1-PI was cleaved near the C terminus by removing a 5-kDa fragment. This sequence represents the N-terminal sequence of the mature α1-PI protein (24.Bollen A. Herzog A. Cravador A. Herion P. Chuchana P. Vander Straten A. Loriau R. Jacobs P. Van Elsen A. DNA. 1983; 2: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, endometase did not cleave other two serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins) tested, soybean trypsin inhibitor and trypsin-chymotryspin inhibitor (Bowman-Birk inhibitor). Moreover, endometase did not digest any of the other human plasma proteins tested (albumin, α1-acid glycoprotein, apo-transferrin, and plasminogen), further showing that the hydrolysis of α1-PI by endometase is specific.Figure 5Cleavage of human plasma α1-PI by endometase. The low molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) are shown inlane 1. 4 μg of α1-PI alone was incubated in 27 μl of assay buffer for 0 and 3 days (lanes 2 and3, respectively), at 37 °C; 320 ng of endometase alone was incubated in 27 μl of assay buffer for 0 and 3 day (lanes 4 and 5, respectively); and 320 (lane 6) or 640 (lane 7) ng of endometase was incubated with 4 μg of α1-PI in 27 μl of assay buffer for 3 days. The enzyme reactions were stopped by addition of 13 μl of 3× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing EDTA and 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5-min. 10 μl of the treated sample was loaded on each well, and the digestion products were analyzed on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Endometase hydrolyzed four synthetic MMP peptide substrates and one TACE substrate (TableII). It hydrolyzed the common MMP substrate, Mca-PLGLDpaAR-NH2 (15.Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), with ak cat/K m value of 1850m−1 s−1, which is similar to those of stromelysin and the cd-collagenase-3 but is much lower than that of matrilysin and cd-metalloelastase. Endometase also digested the other three MMP substrates. Interestingly, it has the ability to hydrolyze the TACE substrate with ak cat/K m value of 185m−1 s−1, which is much lower than that of cd-metalloelastase (13,000m−1s−1).Table IIHydrolysis of synthetic peptide substrates of matrixins (nos. 1–4) and that of tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (no. 5) by endometase, cd-metalloelastase, stromelysin, cd-collagenase-3, and matrilysinFluorogenic peptide substratek cat/K mEndometaseMetalloelastaseStromelysinCollagenase-3Matrilysinm −1 s −11.

We have cloned and identified a novel member of the MMP family, endometase/MMP-26. Its prepro-enzyme has 261 amino acid residues, making it the smallest member of the matrixin family (Figs. 1 and 2 and Table I). Endometase has a unique cysteine switch sequence, PH CGVPDGSD, and a zinc-binding consensus sequence in the catalytic domain, HEXGHXXGXXH. It also has three potential N-glycosylation sites. One is at residue Asn64 of the propeptide domain; the other two are at the residues Asn133 and Asn221, distributed within the catalytic domain. The possibility of N-glycosylation of endometase in human and mammalian systems remains to be investigated. This unique enzyme was only cloned from a human endometrial tumor cDNA library, and its mRNA was only detected in human uterus, not in the other tissues and cancer cell lines tested, indicating a possible tissue-specific distribution and function of endometase. Endometase has a unique protein substrate specificity. Endometase cleaved gelatin and generated three-quarter, one-quarter, and other fragments of α1(I) and α2(I) subunits (Fig.4), suggesting that it may have gelatin cleavage sites identical or similar to those of human interstitial collagenase (MMP-1) and frog collagenase-4 (MMP-18) (13.Stolow M.A. Bauzon D.D. Li J. Sedgwick T. Liang V.C. Sang Q.A. Shi Y.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although the catalytic domain of endometase was found to be 49% identical to that of human collagenase-3, it did not dissolve type I collagen, possibly due to its lack of a hemopexin-like domain. Endometase also did not cleave type IV collagen, laminin, elastin, β-casein, and lactoferrin, demonstrating that the endometase cleavage of type I gelatin was specific. Although the catalytic domain of endometase was found to be 54, 51, and 46% identical to those of metalloelastase, stromelysin, and matrilysin, respectively, endometase did not hydrolyze type IV collagen, elastin, laminin, plasminogen, or β-casein, further illustrating that endometase may have its unique substrates. Endometase selectively hydrolyzed human plasma α1-PI (Fig. 5). It did not cleave two other serpins, soybean trypsin inhibitor and Bowman-Birk inhibitor. Moreover, endometase did not digest any other human plasma proteins tested, e.g. albumin, α1-acid glycoprotein, transferrin, and plasminogen, further showing that the hydrolysis of α1-PI by endometase was specific. Our results suggested that the α1-PI protein was cleaved by endometase near the C terminus by removing a 5-kDa fragment. Interestingly, α1-PI protein was cleaved by MMP-1 at two sites near the C terminus, Phe352–Leu353 and Pro357–Met358 of the mature α1-PI protein, which indicated that a fragment of about 4.5 kDa was removed from the C terminus (25.Desrochers P.E. Jeffrey J.J. Weiss S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 2258-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Stromelysin-3 also inactivated α1-PI by cleaving Ala350–Met351 within the reactive site loop in breast cancer (26.Pei D. Majmudar G. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, one of the potential functions of endometase would be selective inactivation of serpin, thus promoting serine proteinase activity and enhancing extracellular matrix degradation in endometrial cancer. The peptide substrate specificity of enodmetase was tested and compared with four most similar MMPs, cd-metalloelastase, stromelysin, cd-collagenase-3, and matrilysin (Table II). Endometase hydrolyzed four synthetic MMP peptide substrates and one TACE substrate. Endometase shares some of the same substrates as other MMPs; however, it has its own unique catalytic specificities and efficiencies. In addition, endometase hydrolyzed a TACE substrate. Interestingly, matrilysin has been reported to release tumor necrosis factor-α in a herniated disc resorption model (27.Haro H. Crawford H.C. Fingleton B. Shinomiya K. Spengler D.M. Matrisian L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The possibility of processing pro-tumor necrosis factor-α by endometase warrants further investigation. Moreover, our preliminary studies showed that endometase was inhibited by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases-1 and -2, 2F. Yu and Q.-X. A. Sang, unpublished results. further confirming that endometase is an authentic matrixin. Our data suggest that endometase may be uterus-specific and may have unique biochemical characteristics and physiological and pathological functions. We thank Dr. Harold E.

Modeling of the three-dimensional structure of native VIP (central α-helice from Val5 to Asn24 with random coiled N and C terminus) and analogs shows that substitutions of His1, Val5, Arg14, Lys15, Lys21, Leu23, and Ile26 decreased biological activity without altering the predicted structure, supporting that those residues directly interact with VPAC1 receptor. The interaction of the analogs with human VPAC2 receptor is similar to that observed with VPAC1 receptor, with three remarkable exceptions: substitution of Thr11 and Asn28 by alanine increased Ki for binding to VPAC2receptor; substitution of Tyr22 by alanine increased EC50 for stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity through interaction with the VPAC2 receptor.

VIP belongs to a large family of structurally related peptides (2Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Voisin T. Greeley G.H. Gastrointestinal Endocrinology.

Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 16: 53-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) that comprises VIP, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide PACAP-27, and its C-terminal extended form PACAP-38, secretin, glucagon, and glucagon-like peptides-1 and -2, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, peptide histidine methionine amide, growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF), and peptides isolated from the venom of the Gila Monster. VIP and PACAP are the most closely related peptides in terms of structure and function (2Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Voisin T. Greeley G.H. Gastrointestinal Endocrinology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 125-157Crossref Google Scholar, 6Mutt V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 527: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). They share two common receptors, VPAC1 and VPAC2, which display high affinity for both VIP and PACAP (2Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Voisin T. Greeley G.H. Gastrointestinal Endocrinology.

Waschek J.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 265-270PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors together with receptors for VIP-related peptides (see above) clearly constitute an original subfamily within the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (2Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Voisin T. Greeley G.H. Gastrointestinal Endocrinology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 125-157Crossref Google Scholar, 9Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P.

Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 382-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This subfamily referred to as class II (2Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Voisin T. Greeley G.H. Gastrointestinal Endocrinology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 125-157Crossref Google Scholar) also comprises receptors for parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, corticotropin-releasing factor, and the so called EGF-TM7 receptors (11McKnight A.J. Gordon S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1998; 63: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Class II family of receptors for peptides display several common properties including large N-terminal extracellular domains containing highly conserved cystein residues, N-terminal leader sequences, and complex gene organization with many introns (2Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Voisin T. Greeley G.H. Gastrointestinal Endocrinology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 125-157Crossref Google Scholar). Although the structure-function relationship of VIP receptors, including VPAC1 and VPAC2, has been recently documented (2Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Voisin T. Greeley G.H.

Biochem. 1999; 265: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the structure-function relationship of VIP itself is still poorly understood. Some old studies carried out before the characterization and cloning of VIP receptor subtypes (21Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Fournier A. St Pierre S. Pipkorn R. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 121: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22O'Donnell M. Garippa R.J. O'Neil N.C. Bolin D.R. Cottrell J.M. J. Biol.

Sci. 1988; 527: 296-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) indicated that: (i) the entire sequence of VIP is required for full biological function (21Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Fournier A. St Pierre S. Pipkorn R. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 121: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22O'Donnell M. Garippa R.J. O'Neil N.C. Bolin D.R.

Couvineau A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 527: 296-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); (iii) there are important differences between species in the pharmacology of VIP receptors, especially between rodents and humans (2Laburthe M.

Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12795-12800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this context, the present study explores the structure-function relationship of VIP for interacting with the two human VIP receptor subtypes VPAC1 and VPAC2. The contribution of each side chain of VIP was investigated by the systematic single exchange of each residue of VIP 1–28 by alanine or glycine. All modified VIP peptides were then analyzed for their binding affinities and abilities to stimulate adenylyl cyclase in CHO cell clones stably expressing human recombinant VPAC1 or VPAC2 receptor. Moreover, the contribution of each residue was also analyzed after molecular modeling of all VIP analogs. These studies allowed us to determine key residues for interaction with human VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors and also resulted in the development of the most highly selective VPAC1 receptor agonist ever described. Enzymes and vectors for cloning were obtained from Promega (Charbonnière, France). The recombinant human VPAC1 receptor was stably expressed in CHO cells as described (24Gaudin P. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 302: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The human VPAC2 cDNA (25Svoboda M. Tastenoy M. Van Rampelbergh J. Goossens J.F. De Neef P. Waelbroeck M. Robberecht P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. M. Svoboda and Dr. P. Robberecht (Brussels, Belgium). Culture medium was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Cergy-Pontoise, France). In addition to VIP analogs synthesized by us (see below), [Gly4]VIP, [Ala12]VIP, [Ala23]VIP, and [Ala11,22,28]VIP analogs were obtained by custom peptide synthesis from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). 125I-VIP was prepared and purified as described (26Laburthe M. Rousset M. Rouyer-Fessard C. Couvineau A. Chantret I. Chevalier G. Zweibaum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10180-10184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other highly purified chemicals used were from Sigma (Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France). The peptides were synthesized by solid phase on a PerSeptive Biosystems Pioneer Instrument using a Fmoc strategy. We have used a Fmoc-PAL-PEG-PS resin (27Barany G. Albericio F. Biancalana S. Bontems S.L. Chang J.L. Eritja R. Ferrer M. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. Lyttle M.H. Solé N.A. Tian Z. Van Abel R.J. Wright P.B. Zalipsky S. Hudson D. Smith J. Rivier J. Peptides, Chemistry and Biology, Proceedings of the Twelfth American Peptide Symposium. ESCOM, Leiden, The Netherlands1992: 603-604Google Scholar) (PerSeptive Biosystems GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) loaded at 0.16 mmol/g. N-protected Fmoc amino acids were used. For functionalized amino acids, the following derivatives were used: Fmoc-Asp(OBut)-OH, Fmoc-Glu(OBut)-OH, Fmoc-Arg(Pmc)-OH, Fmoc-His(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-Ser(But)-OH, Fmoc-Thr(But)-OH, Fmoc-Tyr(But)-OH, Fmoc-Gln(Xan)-OH, Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH, and Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH and were from Advanced ChemTech (Machelen, Belgium). The coupling reagent was 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (28Dourtoglou, V., Gross, B., Lampropoulou, V., and Zioudrou, C. (1984)Synthesis 572–574Google Scholar) for all peptides except for [Ala5]VIP, [Ala16]VIP, [Ala17]VIP, and [Ala27]VIP for which HATU (29Carpino, L. A., El-Faham, A., Minor, C. A., and Albericio, F. (1994) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun., 201–203Google Scholar) was used. Syntheses of the different peptides were performed from 0.625 g of Fmoc-PAL-PEG-PS resin. An excess of 4 eq of each amino acid was used. A double coupling was performed when Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-Val-OH, Fmoc-Gln(Xan)-OH, Fmoc-Arg(Pmc)-OH, Fmoc-Thr(But)-OH, and Fmoc-Tyr(But)-OH were involved in coupling. Fmoc deprotection was performed with a solution of piperidine in dimethylformamide in a 2:8 (v/v) ratio. Final deprotection of the peptides from the resin was performed in a mixture containing trifluoroacetic acid, water, thioanisole, ethylenedithiol, phenol in a 82.5/5/5/2.5/5 (v/v) ratio (30King D.S. Field C.G. Field G.B. Int. J. Peptide Res. 1990; 36: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) for 2 h. Peptides were then precipitated by addition of cold diethyl ether and dissolved in a mixture of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water/acetonitrile and lyophilized. They were purified by high performance liquid chromatography on a Waters instrument equipped with a Waters Delta Packs C18 column (340 × 100 mm) using a gradient of solvents composed of water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Purity of all peptides was checked by analytical high performance liquid chromatography on a Waters instrument using a C18 column (Novarpack, 5 μm, 100 Å, 180 × 3.5 mm) and all were at least 97% pure (UV detection at 214 and 254 nm). They were characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry using a Jeol LX 2000 spectrometer. The conformations of native VIP and VIP analogs were calculated by molecular modeling using the OSIRIS software which is an ab initio approach allowing the calculation of three-dimensional structure of soluble proteins of less than 150 residues (31Brasseur R. J. Mol. Graph. 1995; 13: 312-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The first step of OSIRIS is used in the present study since it is sufficient to correctly determine most secondary structures of different α-helix proteins (32Benhabilès N. Gallet X. Thomas-Soumarmon A. Brasseur R. J. Comput. Biol. 1998; 5: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Briefly, the primary sequence of the peptide is introduced and 179 pairs of Φ and ψ angles are successively attributed to all amino acids of the sequence. For each rotation axis, the energy is calculated using the following equation,E(k)=E(k)tor+∑i=1w∑j=w+1nq(Evdwij+Eelecij+Esol.inij)+∑i=1wqn−1Esol.outi+∑j=w+1nqn−1Esol.outiEquation 1 where E(k) is the energetic component associated to the torsion axis k, between atoms wand w+1, with E(k)tor as torsional energy, Evdwij as Van der Waals energy, Eelecij as electrostatic energy, Esol.inijas internal solvation energy between atoms i and j, and Esol.outij as solvent solvation energy, and q as an energy quantum equal to the interaction energy between atoms i and j, divided by the number of torsion axes between atoms i and j. A structure is then obtained from the linear combination of each residue energy minimum. The energy of this construct is calculated and the residues having the lowest energy are frozen. Then the calculation is started again, keeping the structure of frozen residues constant and testing the 179 pairs of Φ, ψ angles on the others. At each step of calculation, μ residues are frozen, μ varying between 5 and 28. Increasing the μ value allows to test the variability of the calculated VIP or VIP analog structures. Calculations were performed on RAMSES (Rapid Analysis Master/Slaves Extensible System), a parallel hardware of 21 tracer Europa Pentium Pro PC cadenced at 180 Mhz connected by a 100 Mbytes Network and controlled by a HP Vectra VA Pentium Pro cadenced at 200 Mhz. Molecular views were drawn with WinMGM 1.0 (Ab Initio Technology, Obernai, France) as described (33Rahman M. Brasseur R. J. Mol. Graph. 1994; 12: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis of the predicted structures of VIP and VIP analogs was made using the SICLA program (32Benhabilès N. Gallet X. Thomas-Soumarmon A. Brasseur R. J. Comput. Biol. 1998; 5: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This procedure starts fromn × n distance tables calculated from the local root mean square distances of all pairs of structures obtained using different E mvi (μ) values. The root mean square distances was calculated by fitting the backbone of 5 amino acids of a structure to the 5 corresponding residues of the reference structure (here, the predicted structure obtained with μ = 5). The root mean square distances of the fragment is attributed to the central amino acid, the window is then moved by 1 residue along the sequence and calculations are repeated. The clustering procedure used in SICLA is an automatic nonhierarchical classification that compares pairs of structures (34Celeux G. Diday E. Govaert G. Lechevalier Y. Ralamboudrainy H. Classification Automatique des Données. Dunod Editions, Paris1989Google Scholar, 35Kaufman L. Rousseeuw P.J. Finding Groups in Data, An Introduction to Cluster Analysis. John Wiley and Sons, New York1990Google Scholar). This procedure is described in detail elsewhere (32Benhabilès N. Gallet X. Thomas-Soumarmon A. Brasseur R. J. Comput. Biol. 1998; 5: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). From the clustering of structures calculated with different μ values, a mean distance between the central structure and the others is obtained. This distance is representative of the peptide structural variability. Full-length VPAC1 or VPAC2 receptor cDNAs were ligated in the EcoRI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Both receptors were tagged at the C terminus with a marker dodecapeptide (Tag) as described (14Couvineau A. Fabre C. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Laburthe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmid encoding human VPAC2 was transfected into CHO cells (ECACC 85050302) by electroporation. Briefly, four million CHO cells, cultured as described (14Couvineau A. Fabre C. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Laburthe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), were preincubated on ice for 5 min with 20 μg of plasmid DNA and 20 μg of salmon sperm DNA carrier in cold Ham's F-12 medium. After electroporation (330 V, 1,000 microfarads, infinite resistance), cells were kept on ice for 5 min and then transferred to Petri dishes containing 10 ml of culture medium (Ham's F-12, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin). After 48 h, cells were selected by addition of geneticin (G418) at the final concentration of 800 μg/ml for 2 weeks. Resistant cells were cloned by limiting dilution as described (24Gaudin P. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 302: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A clone, referred to as clone 10, was isolated and selected on the basis of its binding parameters for VIP (see below). Clone 10 cells were grown in the above described culture medium containing 100 μg/ml G418 in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. A clone (referred to as clone 15) of CHO cells stably expressing the human VPAC1receptor was previously isolated and characterized (24Gaudin P. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 302: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Both clone 10 and clone 15 cells were passaged every 7 days in 25-cm2plastic culture flasks and used between passages 8 and 30, under conditions for which the density of VPAC2 and VPAC1 receptors did not vary significantly (see below). Cells, either clone 10 or clone 15, were grown to confluency for 3–4 days. After removing the culture medium, attached cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, then harvested with a rubber policeman and centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000 × g. The cell pellet was exposed for 30 min at 4 °C to hypoosmotic 5 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, and a particulate fraction, referred to as membrane preparation, was obtained as described (17Gaudin P. Maoret J.-J. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4990-4996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Membranes were stored at −80 °C until use. Protein content was measured by the procedure of Bradford (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 78: 248-254Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Membranes (100 μg of protein/ml) were incubated at equilibrium for 60 min at 30 °C with 0.05 nm125I-VIP and increasing concentrations of native VIP or VIP analogs. The incubation medium was 20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.1% (w/v) bacitracin. The reaction was stopped by transferring the incubation medium to an excess of ice-cold buffer. Bound and free peptides were immediately separated by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 10 min, and membrane pellets were washed twice with 10% (w/v) sucrose in ice-cold 20 mm Hepes. The radioactivity was then counted with a γ-counter. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between the amount of 125I-VIP bound in the absence (total binding) and presence (nonspecific binding) of 10 μm unlabeled native VIP. The nonspecific binding represented about 10 and 15% of total radioactivity bound to clone 15 and clone 10 cell membranes, respectively. All binding data were analyzed using the LIGAND computer program (38Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 197: 220-239Crossref Scopus (7774) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant (Kd) and binding capacity (B max) of VIP binding to clone 10 and clone 15 cell membranes were determined by Scatchard analysis. From the linear Scatchard plots, the Kd of VPAC1receptor in clone 10 cell membranes and VPAC2 receptor in clone 15 cell membranes were 0.4 and 0.7 nm, respectively. The B max were 1.6 and 1.3 pmol/mg of protein, respectively. The constants Ki for the inhibition of125I-VIP binding by unlabeled peptides were calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation as described (39Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Darmoul D. Maoret J.J. Carrero I. Ogier-Denis E. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). All competition curves for VIP and VIP analogs fit with a monophasic binding profile for both VPAC1 and VPAC2 binding assays. Adenylyl cyclase activity in membranes from clone 10 or clone 15 cells was assayed in the presence of increasing concentrations of native VIP or VIP analogs as described (37Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 23-27PubMed Google Scholar). Dose-response curves were fitted and concentration of peptide giving half-maximal response (EC50) were calculated using the Prism software suite (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Twenty-six analogs of VIP were synthesized in which each side chain of VIP 1–28 was systematically replaced with alanine. Two other analogs were also synthesized in which glycine was substituted for alanine in position 4 or 18 of native VIP. The ability of each analog to interact with the recombinant human VPAC1 receptor expressed in CHO clone 15 cells was first analyzed by competitive inhibition of 125I-VIP binding to cell membranes. For all VIP analogs, the dose-response curves for inhibiting 125I-VIP binding were parallel to that of native VIP and complete inhibition could be observed at 10 μmpeptide concentration (not shown). All competitor curves fitted with a monophasic binding profile consistent with a single binding site. Analysis of Ki (TableI) showed that substituting residues at 14 positions including positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 23, and 26 of VIP resulted in an important decrease in affinity for VPAC1 receptors, i.e. more than one log. Fig. 1 shows the competition curves for 125I-VIP binding to VPAC1 receptor for some of these VIP analogs with decreased affinity e.g.H1A, F6A, K20A, and I26A VIP analogs. Substitution at other positions resulted in no change of affinity or a small decrease of affinity of less than one log. The most pronounced decreases of affinity occurred with H1A, F6A, R12A, R14A, and L23A analogs for which a 100–200-fold decrease was observed. Other significant decreases of affinity were observed with D3A, V5A, T7A, D8A, Y10A, K15A, K20A, K21A, and I26A analogs, e.g. >10-fold. All VIP analogs were also tested for their ability to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity in membranes of CHO clone 15 cells expressing the human VPAC1 receptor. The dose-response curves for all analogs paralleled that of VIP and 10 μm analogs achieved the same maximal stimulation of enzyme activity as native VIP (not shown).

https://openalex.org/W1973140084,"Mutation Asn-21 → Ile in human cationic trypsinogen (Tg-1) has been associated with hereditary pancreatitis. Recent studies with rat anionic Tg (Tg-2) indicated that the analogous Thr-21 → Ile mutation stabilizes the zymogen against autoactivation, whereas it has no effect on catalytic properties or autolytic stability of trypsin (Sahin-Tóth, M. (1999) J. Biol. Chem.274, 29699–29704). In the present paper, human cationic Tg (Asn-21-Tg) and mutants Asn-21 → Ile (Ile-21-Tg) and Asn-21 → Thr (Thr-21-Tg) were expressed in Escherichia coli, and zymogen activation, zymogen degradation, and trypsin autolysis were studied. Enterokinase activated Asn-21-Tg approximately 2-fold better than Ile-21-Tg or Thr-21-Tg, and catalytic parameters of trypsins were comparable. At 37 °C, in 5 mm Ca2+, all three trypsins were highly stable. In the absence of Ca2+, Asn-21- and Ile-21-trypsins suffered autolysis in an indistinguishable manner, whereas Thr-21-trypsin exhibited significantly increased stability. In sharp contrast to observations with the rat proenzyme, at pH 8.0, 37 °C, autoactivation kinetics of Asn-21-Tg and Ile-21-Tg were identical; however, at pH 5.0, Ile-21-Tg autoactivated at an enhanced rate relative to Asn-21-Tg. Remarkably, at both pH values, Thr-21-Tg showed markedly higher autoactivation rates than the two other zymogens. Finally, autocatalytic proteolysis of human zymogens was limited to cleavage at Arg-117, and no digestion at Lys-188 was detected. The observations indicate that zymogen stabilization by Ile-21 as observed in rat Tg-2 is not characteristic of human Tg-1. Instead, an increased propensity to autoactivation under acidic conditions might be relevant to the pathomechanism of the Asn-21 → Ile mutation in hereditary pancreatitis. In the same context, faster autoactivation and increased trypsin stability caused by the Asn-21 → Thr mutation in human Tg-1 might provide a rationale for the evolutionary divergence from Thr-21 found in other mammalian trypsinogens.

Lancet. 1999; 354: 42-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that mutation Arg-117 → His eliminates a trypsin-sensitive cleavage site on trypsin and leads to pancreatitis by rendering prematurely activated trypsin resistant to inactivation through autolysis or proteolysis by trypsin-like enzymes (5Gates Jr., L.K. Ulrich C.D. Whitcomb D.C. Surg. Clin. North Am. 1999; 79: 711-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Degradation of trypsin by such mechanisms in the pancreas is believed to serve as a fail-safe mechanism against excessive trypsin accumulation (11Rinderknecht H. Renner I.G. Abramson S.B. Carmack C.

Although direct biochemical evidence with recombinant human cationic Tg is still lacking, Arg-117 has been shown to be a critical autolysis site in bovine (14Maroux S. Desnuelle P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 181: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) as well as rat (15Kaslik G. Patthy A. Bálint M. Gráf L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) anionic trypsin, and mutations of this residue stabilize rat anionic trypsin against autolysis (16Várallyai É. Pál G. Patthy A. Szilágyi L. Gráf L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Li X.F. Nie X. Tang J.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Arg-117 is also the primary cleavage site for autocatalytic breakdown of the proenzyme Tg (18Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29699-29704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Sahin-Tóth M. Gráf L. Tóth M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and it was demonstrated that under Ca2+-free conditions, the Arg-117 → His substitution significantly stabilizes rat anionic Tg (Tg-2). The observations suggested that in HP the Arg-117 → His mutation may exert its detrimental effect through proteolytic stabilization of both trypsin and Tg (19Sahin-Tóth M. Gráf L. Tóth M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of the Asn-21 → Ile mutation has been much more elusive. In an attempt to find a common mechanism for both mutations, it was proposed that the Asn-21 → Ile mutation may render the autolysis site at Arg-117 less available for proteolysis by bringing Glu-24 close enough to form a salt bridge (2Whitcomb D.C. Pancreas. 1999; 18: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 3Whitcomb D.C. Gut. 1999; 45: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 7Gorry M.C. Gabbaizedeh D. Furey W.

An alternative theory suggested that the mutation might change the structure of the activation peptide region and lead to increased autoactivation and excessive trypsin formation (7Gorry M.C. Gabbaizedeh D. Furey W. Gates Jr., L.K. Preston R.A. Aston C.E. Zhang Y. Ulrich C. Ehrlich G.D. Whitcomb D.C.

Gut. 1999; 44: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, when these two theories were tested on recombinant rat Tg-2, neither increased autolytic stability nor increased autoactivation was observed (18Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29699-29704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, the analogous Thr-21 → Ile mutation significantly decreased autoactivation and zymogen degradation without affecting trypsin stability or activity. These findings suggested that unwanted zymogen stabilization by the Asn-21 → Ile mutation might play an important role in HP. Taken together, biochemical evidence obtained on recombinant rat Tg-2 pointed to a possible unifying scheme for the initiating steps of HP, in which zymogen stabilization by HP-associated mutations is the key pathogenic factor (18Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29699-29704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Sahin-Tóth M. Gráf L. Tóth M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that proteolytic degradation of Tg by trypsin generated during autoactivation might be another important safeguard mechanism of controlling excessive trypsin liberation in the pancreas. Mutations, which stabilize Tg against autoactivation and/or tryptic degradation, would impair the efficacy of this protective mechanism and render the zymogen storage pool more susceptible to widespread activation. Although the proposed pathomechanism appears to be readily testable on human cationic Tg, problems associated with recombinant expression and purification of this zymogen have hindered progress. In the present study, for the first time, human Tg-1 was expressed in Escherichia coli into inclusion bodies and successfully refolded in vitro. Wild-type Tg-1 (Asn-21-Tg) and mutants Asn-21 → Ile (Ile-21-Tg) and Asn-21 → Thr (Thr-21-Tg) were produced, and the zymogens and active trypsins were characterized and compared with properties of the previously studied analogous rat Tg-2 constructs. The results indicate that effects of mutations of amino acid 21 in Tgs from the two species are markedly different and suggest that enhanced autoactivation of Ile-21-Tg under acidic conditions, rather than zymogen stabilization, might play a role in HP. Furthermore, the Asn-21 → Thr substitution is shown to alter human Tg-1 in such a manner that might predispose humans to pancreatitis. The findings provide a plausible explanation for the evolutionary divergence from Thr-21 found in all other known mammalian trypsins. Finally, the new availability of recombinant human Tg-1 sets the stage for much needed further studies to elucidate the role of HP-associated Tg mutations in the pathogenesis of HP. Ecotin was overexpressed in E. coliBL21 (DE3) as described by Pál et al. (20Pál G. Szilágyi L. Gráf L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21Pál G. Sprengler G. Patthy A. Gráf L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and purified to homogeneity using a trypsin affinity column. Purified ecotin was immobilized to ACTIGEL ALD resin (Sterogene Bioseparations, Carlsbad, CA) as described previously (22Lengyel Z. Pál G. Sahin-Tóth M. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Plasmid pTrap was a generous gift from László Gráf (Eötvös University, Budapest, Hungary). Plasmid pET28c and competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were purchased from Novagen, Inc. (Madison, WI). Ultrapure bovine enterokinase was purchased from Biozyme Laboratories (San Diego, CA), bovine chymotrypsinogen A from Worthington Biochemical Corp. (Lakewood, NJ),N-CBZ-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide from Sigma, and Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide from BACHEM California, Inc. (Torrance, CA). A gene encoding human cationic Tg was constructed by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis of the rat Tg-2 gene. Construction of a semisynthetic gene offered the advantage of creating unique restriction sites, which can facilitate further mutagenesis studies. The two trypsins are 80% identical in their amino acid sequence, and a total of 44 mutations were introduced into the rat Tg-2 gene using a series of “overlap extension” polymerase chain reactions (23Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The final polymerase chain reaction product, containing the full-length human Tg-1 gene, was digested with restriction enzymesBamHI-SacI and ligated into the similarly treated Tg-expression vector pTrap (24Gráf L. Craik C.S. Patthy A. Roczniak S. Fletterick R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2616-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of the entire gene was verified by dideoxy-sequencing. Mutations Asn-21 → Ile and Asn-21 → Thr were introduced by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis, and the polymerase chain reaction fragments were ligated into pTrap using the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. The expression plasmid pTrap is routinely used to express rat anionic Tg into the periplasm of E. coli SM138 via the alkaline phosphatase promoter and leader sequence (15Kaslik G. Patthy A.

Unexpectedly, when the gene encoding human Tg-1 was cloned into pTrap and transformed SM138 cells were grown, no appreciable amounts of wild-type or mutant Tgs were recovered from the periplasm. Cell fractionation experiments suggested that some of the expressed Tg might be present as inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm. Subsequently, to enhance cytoplasmic expression, an NcoI site was inserted at the 5′ end of the propeptide coding sequence in pTrap. The NcoI site also introduced a new initiator Met codon (ATG), and the propeptide sequence was changed to Met-Ala-Phe-Pro-Val-Asp4-Lys. Thus, native Tg-1 and its recombinant counterpart differ only at the very N terminus, where the native sequence is Ala-Pro-Phe-Asp4-Lys. Finally, the BglII-NcoI region, containing the T7 promoter,lac operator and a Shine-Dalgarno sequence, was excised from the commercial vector pET28c and inserted between the BamHI and NcoI sites of the modified pTrap (pTrap-T7). The pTrap-T7 constructs encoding wild-type and mutant Tgs were transformed into BL21(DE3) carrying a chromosomal copy of T7 RNA polymerase under the control of the lacZ promoter. In a typical experiment, 50-ml cultures of BL21(DE3)/pTrap-T7 in Luria-Bertani medium with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin were grown to an A 600 nm of 0.5, induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown for an additional 5 h. Cells were harvested, and inclusion bodies were isolated by sonication and centrifugation. The inclusion body pellet was washed twice with 1.5 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and dissolved in 500 μl of 4 m guanidine-HCl/0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 30 mm, and Tg was completely reduced at 37 °C for 30 min. Denatured Tg was then rapidly diluted into 50 ml of refolding buffer (0.9 m guanidine-HCl, 0.1 mTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 30 mml-cysteine, 30 mml-cystine), slowly stirred under argon for 5 min at room temperature, and kept at 4 °C overnight. The final guanidine-HCl concentration after the dilution proved to be a critical factor in successful, quantitative refolding. Concentrations below or above 0.8–0.9 m resulted in the appearance of misfolded species, which could be easily detected on nonreducing SDS-PAGE gels by their slower mobility. To remove any leftover contaminants and misfolded protein, the renatured Tg solution was diluted 2-fold with 50 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and applied directly to a 2-ml ecotin affinity column (22Lengyel Z. Pál G. Sahin-Tóth M. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The column was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)/0.2 m NaCl, and zymogens were eluted with 50 mm HCl. The eluate was homogenous Tg; no other bands were detectable on Coomassie Blue-stained gels. Concentrations of zymogen solutions were estimated from their ultraviolet absorbance using a calculated extinction coefficient of 36160 m−1cm−1 at 280 nm. In addition, to ensure that identical amounts of zymogens were used in the experiments, serial dilutions of the proteins were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE gels, and the intensities of the Coomassie Blue-stained bands were compared. Typical Tg yields were 0.8–1.0 mg of purified zymogen per 50-ml culture. Contrasting the anecdotal instability and rapid autoactivation of human Tg-1, recombinant Tg-1 preparations were essentially trypsin-free, and similarly to the rat proenzyme, they were highly stable for months when stored at 4 °C in hydrochloric acid. Interestingly, N-terminal protein sequencing identified the first amino acid as Ala, indicating that (most of) the N-terminal formyl-Met is removed during expression. Trypsin activity was determined using the synthetic chromogenic substrateN-CBZ-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide. Kinetics of the chromophor release was followed at 405 nm in 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, at 22 °C. Bovine chymotrypsinogen A (final concentration, 5–80 μm) was activated by catalytic amounts of trypsin (final concentration, 3 nm) at 37 °C, in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmCaCl2, in a final volume of 800 μl. Chymotrypsin concentrations were determined by activity assays using the synthetic chromogenic substrate Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide. Autolytic degradation of trypsin was followed by residual activity measurements (16Várallyai É. Pál G. Patthy A. Szilágyi L. Gráf L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 18Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29699-29704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Tgs (final concentration, 2.5 μm) were activated with 200 ng/ml enterokinase (final concentration) for 60 min at 22 °C in 0.1m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)/5 mm CaCl2. Trypsin solutions were then incubated at 37 °C without any further additions (i.e. in the presence of 5 mmCa2+) or after addition of K-EDTA (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 10 mm. At the indicated times 2.5-μl samples were withdrawn for trypsin activity determination. Tgs (final concentration, 2.5 μm) were incubated at 37 °C in 0.1 mTris-HCl (pH 8.0) or 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm K-EDTA, in a final volume of 100 μl. At the indicated times, 2.5-μl aliquots were removed for trypsin activity assays. Alternatively, reactions were terminated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, proteins were separated by 12% reducing SDS-PAGE, and bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Wild-type human Tg-1 (Asn-21-Tg) was activated by bovine enterokinase approximately 2-fold faster than mutants Ile-21-Tg and Thr-21-Tg at pH 8.0, 37 °C, in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+ (Fig.1 A). Because trypsin-catalyzed Tg activation may alter the enterokinase activation kinetics, mutants were also compared at dilute zymogen concentrations, where autoactivation is less likely to interfere. As shown in Fig.1 B, Asn-21-Tg clearly exhibits enhanced activation rates relative to the other two mutants under these conditions as well. Enzyme kinetic parameters of trypsins were determined on the synthetic small peptideN-CBZ-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide at 22 °C, pH 8.0, in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+. Wild-type and mutant trypsins exhibited essentially identicalKm and k cat values (TableI), which were also comparable to those found with rat trypsin (16Várallyai É. Pál G. Patthy A. Szilágyi L. Gráf L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, to test a protein substrate in which the P′ subsites also participate in interactions, the ability of human trypsins to activate bovine chymotrypsinogen A to chymotrypsin was also compared. As shown in Table I, wild-type and mutant trypsins activated chymotrypsinogen with comparable efficiencies. The findings clearly support the notion that mutations at Asn-21 do not alter catalytic activity of human cationic trypsin.Table IKinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant trypsins on synthetic substrate N-CBZ-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide at 22 °C and on bovine chymotrypsinogen A at 37 °C.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar for references). In the absence of Ca2+, autolytic degradation is rapid, whereas millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ protect against autolysis. When incubated at 37 °C, pH 8.0, human cationic trypsin was completely stable in 5 mm Ca2+ up to 24 h, and more than 50% activity was detectable after 5 days. Mutations at position 21 (Ile-21- or Thr-21-trypsins) had no appreciable effect on trypsin stability in Ca2+. In contradistinction, in the absence of Ca2+ trypsin suffered relatively rapid autolysis, and under these conditions, Thr-21-trypsin exhibited significantly increased stability relative to Asn-21- and Ile-21-trypsins (Fig. 2). Importantly, no difference was apparent in the autolysis kinetics of Asn-21-trypsin and Ile-21-trypsin, indicating that the Asn-21 → Ile mutation does not alter autolytic stability of human cationic trypsin. Previous studies on rat Tg-2 demonstrated that replacement of Thr-21 with Ile resulted in significantly higher zymogen stability against autoactivation and concomitant zymogenolysis (18Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29699-29704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Sahin-Tóth M. Gráf L. Tóth M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, when human Tg-1 mutants were incubated at 37 °C, in the presence of 5 mmCa2+, pH 8.0, autoactivation kinetics of Asn-21-Tg and Ile-21-Tg were practically indistinguishable, whereas Thr-21-Tg showed significantly faster autoactivation (Fig.3). Reducing SDS-PAGE gels indicated the appearance of 2 degradation products generated during autoactivation of zymogens (bands A and B). N-terminal protein sequencing revealed that band A is a mixture of two proteins, containing the N- and C-terminal fragments of Tg cleaved after Arg-117. The N-terminal zymogen fragment is converted to band B by trypsinolytic cleavage at Lys-15 in the activation peptide, and at the 2 h time point, bands A and B represent trypsin cleaved at Arg-117. In contrast to the rat Tg-2 (18Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29699-29704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), no cleavage whatsoever was observed at Lys-188 in human Tg-1. In the absence of Ca2+ (i.e. in 1 mmEDTA), autoactivation of human zymogens was drastically suppressed; however, when followed over a longer period of time, enhanced autoactivation of Thr-21-Tg relative to Asn-21-Tg and Ile-21-Tg became apparent (Fig. 4). SDS-PAGE indicated greatly enhanced proteolysis of the zymogens at Arg-117 (i.e. band A is prominent). In agreement with activity assays, trypsin formation was only significant in Thr-21-Tg, whereas a trypsin band was hardly detectable in lanes with Asn-21-Tg or Ile-21-Tg. Although mutations of Asn-21 do not alter catalytic activity of trypsin on small peptide substrates or on chymotrypsinogen, the ability to activate Tg may be affected differently. To test this possible scenario, human Asn-21-, Ile-21-, and Thr-21-Tgs were activated with Asn-21-, Ile-21-, or Thr-21-trypsin. For these experiments, trypsins were generated through autoactivation of the respective zymogens at 37 °C, in 5 mm Ca2+, pH 8.0, for 3 h. Fig.5 demonstrates activation of human Tgs with Asn-21-trypsin at an approximately 1:10 trypsin-to-Tg ratio, at 37 °C, in 5 mm Ca2+. As anticipated from autoactivation experiments (see above), Thr-21-Tg was activated approximately 2-fold faster than Asn-21-Tg or Ile-21-Tg. Note that the reaction was linear up to 10 min, indicating that autoactivation by the generated trypsin does not contribute to the activation process within the time period studied. Essentially identical results were obtained when Tgs were digested with Ile-21-trypsin or Thr-21-trypsin. The observations indicate that mutations of Asn-21 affect autoactivation by altering the “substrate” properties of Tg rather than the enzymatic activity of trypsin. Previous studies reported that human Tg-1 was particularly susceptible to spontaneous activation under acidic conditions (25Colomb E. Figarella C. Guy O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 570: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Figarella C. Miszczuk-Jamska B. Barrett A.J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1988; 369 (suppl.): 293-298PubMed Google Scholar). To explore the significance of pH in autoactivation, human Tg-1 mutants were incubated in 0.1 msodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at 37 °C in the presence or absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 6). In 5 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 6 A), rates of autoactivation were somewhat slower than those observed at pH 8.0 (see Fig. 3). In contrast, in 1 mm EDTA, autoactivation was significantly enhanced at pH 5.0 relative to pH 8.0. At both pH values, Thr-21-Tg autoactivated considerably faster than Asn-21-Tg or Ile-21-Tg. Surprisingly, at pH 5.0, Ile-21-Tg exhibited enhanced autoactivation relative to Asn-21-Tg. Finally, although data are not shown, at pH 5.0, all three trypsins were comparably stable, and approximately 50% activity was retained after 24 h incubation at 37 °C, both in the absence and in the presence of 5 mmCa2. Mutation Asn-21 → Ile of the human cationic Tg is the second most frequent Tg mutation associated with HP. The mechanism by which the mutation causes pancreatitis has puzzled researchers since its discovery. In contrast to Arg-117, for which a role in trypsin autolysis and/or zymogenolysis is clearly supported by biochemical evidence (14Maroux S. Desnuelle P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 181: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Kaslik G. Patthy A. Bálint M. Gráf L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Várallyai É.

Commun. 1999; 264: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), nothing is known about the possible structural/functional significance of Asn-21. The first biochemical investigations into the possible mechanism of the Asn-21 → Ile mutation in HP were carried out using recombinant rat anionic Tg (Tg-2) as a model (18Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29699-29704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Sahin-Tóth M. Gráf L. Tóth M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thr-21 in the rat Tg-2 was replaced with Asn or Ile, and the purified recombinant zymogens and their active trypsin forms were characterized. The results clearly indicated that the presence of an Ile at position 21 in the rat Tg-2 significantly decreases autoactivation and autocatalytic zymogen degradation without affecting trypsin stability or activity. On the basis of these observations, it was suggested that (i) zymogen degradation is an important defense mechanism in the pancreas against excessive trypsin liberation, and (ii) unwanted zymogen stabilization by the HP-related mutations might play a role in the pathogenesis of HP. The present study utilized recombinant human cationic Tg to reexamine the validity of the conclusions obtained on the rat Tg-2 model. Similar to the rat model (18Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29699-29704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the Asn-21 → Ile mutation had no effect on the catalytic activity or autolytic stability of human cationic trypsin. In contrast to the rat proenzyme, at pH 8.0, autoactivation of human Tg-1 was not altered by the mutation, and zymogen stabilization was not observed to any extent whatsoever. Furthermore, at pH 5.0, autoactivation of Ile-21-Tg became enhanced relative to Asn-21-Tg. The observations indicate that effects of Ile-21 with respect to autoactivation are strongly context-dependent: inhibition of autoactivation was observed in rat Tg-2; no effect was apparent in human Tg-1 at pH 8.0, and enhancement of autoactivation was detected in human Tg-1, at pH 5.0. There are at least two explanations for the phenomenon. (i) Amino acid 21 may alter the proteolytic accessibility of the propeptide region through intramolecular interactions with other residues in Tg. These interactions can vary at different pH values and/or in different Tgs, leading to the variety of observed effects. (ii) Alternatively, amino acid 21 might directly or indirectly participate in one or more of the subsite interactions important for efficient substrate binding and catalysis. Theseintermolecular interactions can also vary at different pH values and/or with different trypsins, resulting in diverse effects on autoactivation. The results also suggest that enhanced autoactivation of Ile-21-Tg in an acidic environment might play a role in the pathogenesis of HP. In this context, co-localization of zymogen granules and lysosomes in the acinar cells has been proposed as one of the key initiating steps of pancreatitis (27Steer M.L. Pancreas. 1998; 17: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Co-localization would expose Tg to an acidic milieu and to the cysteine-protease cathepsin B (26Figarella C. Miszczuk-Jamska B. Barrett A.J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1988; 369 (suppl.): 293-298PubMed Google Scholar, 28Greenbaum L.M. Hirshkowitz A. Shoichet I. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2885-2890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which has been implicated as the initiator of the activation process under these conditions. It is reasonable to speculate that the increased autoactivation propensity of Ile-21-Tg can intensify a cathepsin B-initiated and/or -mediated activation cascade. Comparison of the activation of human Asn-21-Tg and Ile-21-Tg by human cathepsin B could provide additional support to such a pathomechanism. Another noteworthy difference from the rat Tg-2 is the apparent lack of efficient zymogenolysis during autoactivation in human Tg-1. Rat Tg-2 is digested after Arg-117 and Lys-188 during autoactivation (18Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29699-29704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cleavage at Arg-117 per se does not inactivate trypsin; however, immediate further proteolysis of the C-terminal fragment, possibly at Lys-188, results in the formation of inactive protein. Due to zymogenolysis, autoactivation of rat Tg-2 only yields approximately 50–60% of the total potential trypsin activity in 5 mmCa2+, whereas this number is only around 20% in EDTA (18Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29699-29704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,19Sahin-Tóth M. Gráf L. Tóth M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, human Tg-1 autoactivates practically to 100% of its potential trypsin activity in 5 mm Ca2+, and only proteolytic cleavage after Arg-117 is observed. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of the Arg-117-cleaved Tg/trypsin are readily visible on gels, indicating that unlike its rat counterpart, the C-terminal fragment is not proteolyzed to any further extent. This might be due to the inaccessibility of Lys-188, because no cleavage at this site was detectable in human Tg-1 under any of the conditions studied. The physiological significance of zymogenolysis, or the lack of it, is unclear at the moment. Because human Tg-1 appears to be highly stable, zymogen stabilization by any of the HP-associated mutations, as previously proposed (19Sahin-Tóth M. Gráf L. Tóth M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), is unlikely to play a role in the pathomechanism. Unexpectedly, the most dramatic effects were observed with the Asn-21 → Thr Tg mutant in this study. Autoactivation of Thr-21-Tg was markedly increased relative to Asn-21-Tg or Ile-21-Tg, under all conditions studied, at pH 5.0 or 8.0, in 5 mmCa2+ or in 1 mm EDTA. In addition, Thr-21-trypsin exhibited significantly increased stability against autolysis in EDTA. Unlike all other known Tgs, human cationic Tg contains Asn at position 21. With the exception of human anionic Tg, which carries an Ile at position 21, all other mammalian Tgs sequenced to date contain Thr-21 (29Rypniewski W.R. Perrakis A. Vorgias C.E. Wilson K.S. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been proposed that the evolutionary divergence from Thr-21 found in other mammalian trypsins is the result of a positive selection process “endowing an as yet unknown advantageous effect” (30Chen J.-M. Ferec C. Hum. Genet. 2000; 106: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The present observations provide tangible biochemical support for this theory. Current thinking views both increased Tg activation and increased trypsin stability as potential pathogenic factors of pancreatitis. Consequently, the presence of Thr-21 in human cationic Tg would significantly increase susceptibility to pancreatitis, and evolutionary selection of Asn-21 alleviates this problem.

These data suggest that SR-BI plays an important role in the last steps of murine reverse cholesterol transport and in the delivery of HDL cholesterol to steroidogenic tissue for maintenance of cholesteryl ester stores and the synthesis of steroid hormones.

In addition to mediating binding to SR-BI, apoA-I in HDL can directly or indirectly promote the efflux of cholesterol from peripheral cells (11.Barkia A. Puchois P. Ghalim P. Torpier N. Barbaras G. Ailhaud R. Fruchart J.C. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 87: 135-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and regulate lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity (12.Fielding C.J.

Thus, apoA-I may play an important role in regulating the cholesterol content of peripheral tissues either through selective cholesterol delivery or cholesterol efflux pathways (11.Barkia A.

In the current study, we have focused on the SR-BI binding of different apoA-I-containing ligands, including spherical HDL isolated by ultracentrifugation or immunoaffinity chromatography, pre-β-1 HDL, lipid-free apoA-I, and reconstituted HDL (rHDL) particles containing wild-type and truncated apoA-I forms. We have used standard “radioreceptor” binding assays (2.Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar), in which the ligands are labeled with 125I on their protein moieties. To ensure that125I labeling of the ligands did not affect their binding to SR-BI, we developed a new “immunoreceptor assay,” which permits analysis of binding without the need to radiolabel the ligands. The binding parameters determined using the immunoreceptor assay were similar to those determined using the standard radioreceptor assay. Using both assays for direct binding measurements as well as competition experiments, we have shown that apoA-I's affinity for SR-BI was higher when it was incorporated into discoidal rHDL particles than when it was present in spherical HDL (HDL2 or HDL3), α HDL, pre-β-1 HDL, or when it was lipid-free. Higher density spherical HDLs bound less tightly to SR-BI than did lower density HDLs. Analysis of rHDL particles containing truncated apoA-I forms showed that deletion of either the carboxyl-terminal sequence 185–243 (apoA-I:Δ(185–243)) or the amino-terminal sequence 1–59 (apoA-I:Δ(1–59)) resulted in little or no change in the affinity of the corresponding rHDL particles for SR-BI. In contrast, rHDL particles containing a double mutant lacking both of these amino and carboxyl-terminal regions competed poorly for the binding of native HDL to SR-BI.

The fourth exon of the human apoA-I gene was amplified and mutagenized by polymerase chain reaction, using a set of specific mutagenic primers (185S, 185A), containing the mutation of interest (a stop codon at nucleotide 185), and a set of flanking universal primers (AINotI, AIXhoI), containing the restriction sites NotI and XhoI. The sequences of the primers used are shown in TableI.

Makrides S.C. Jonas A. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17511-17522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). C127 cell clones overproducing the wild-type and the variant apoA-I form were grown in roller bottles on collagen-coated lead microspheres (Verax Corp.), and the protein was purified from the serum-free medium as described previously (18.Laccotripe M. Makrides S.C. Jonas A. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17511-17522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To generate the recombinant baculoviruses expressing wild-type and mutant apoA-I forms, a BamHI–SalI fragment containing human apoA-I cDNA was cloned into the polylinker region of pFASTBAC donor plasmid, which contains the ampicillin and gentamycin resistance genes (Life Technologies). This recombinant plasmid also contains a histidine tag and the tobacco etched viral protease cleavage site. The apoA-I-containing plasmid was used to transform DH10 Bac Escherichia coli cells (Life Technologies). These cells had been transformed previously with the baculovirus genome containing the lacZ and kanamycin resistance genes, along with a helper plasmid containing the tetracycline resistance gene and the transposase genes. Transposition of the apoA-I gene into the lacZ gene disrupts the expression of lacZ and provides a recombinant plasmid named bacmid. For the generation of the donor plasmid expressing the apoA-I:Δ(1–59) form, the apoA-I region between amino acid 60 and the end of 3′-untranslated region was amplified using 5′ (AIM2–5) and 3′ (AIM1–3) primers (see Table I). The 5′ and 3′ primers containBamHI and SalI restriction sites, respectively. The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI andSalI and cloned into the corresponding sites of the pFASTBAC donor plasmid. For the generation of the donor plasmid expressing the (Δ1–59 and Δ185–243) A-I, the region between amino acids 60 and 184 was amplified using the 5′ (AIM2–5) and 3′ (AIM3–3) primers, respectively (see Table I). The AIM3–3 primer introduces a stop codon at position 185 and contains a SalI restriction site. The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI andSalI and cloned into the corresponding sites of the pFASTBAC donor plasmid. For the generation of the wild-type apoA-I donor plasmid (pFASTBAC-A-I), the 3′ apoA-I Bsu36I–SalI region between codon 81 and the SalI polylinker site of the plasmid was obtained by restriction digestion. The region corresponding to amino acids +1 to 82 was amplified using the 5′ (AIC-5) and 3′ (AIC-3) primers of Table I. The 5′ and 3′ primers contain restriction sites forBamHI and Bsu36I, respectively. The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and Bsu36I and ligated along with the 3′ Bsu36I–SalI fragment of apoA-I into the BamHI and SalI sites of the pFASTBACTM HTb plasmid to generate the pFASTBAC-A-I donor plasmid. Cells containing recombinant bacmids were selected by kanamycin, tetracycline, and gentamycin resistance, as white colonies, due to the disruption of lacZ sequence in the recombinant bacmid. Recombinant bacmid DNA was isolated from minipreps and used to infect a monolayer of Sf-9 insect cells (19.Luckow V.A. Lee S.C. Barry G.F. Olins P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4566-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Anderson D. Harris R. Polayes D. Ciccarone V. Donahue R. Gerard G. Jessee J. Luckow V.

Recombinant viruses were isolated, amplified, titrated, and used to infect larger Sf-9 cell cultures grown in suspension at 27 °C. Sf-9 cells were pelleted and resuspended in a lysis buffer. The supernatant was used for the purification of apoA-I fusion proteins using a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin affinity column (22.Crowe J. Masone B.S. Ribbe J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 58: 491-510PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Crowe J. Masone B.S. Ribbe J. Mol. Biotechnol. 1995; 4: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The pure apoA-I without the His tag, when needed, was obtained by cleavage with recombinant tobacco etched viral protease and purified by a second Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin affinity column. Blood was obtained from healthy fasting human donors. Spherical HDL (density range 1.09–1.18 g/ml) was prepared from pooled plasma (two donors for each preparation) by zonal centrifugation as described previously (24.Batsch J.R. Patsch W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 3-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was stored under nitrogen at 4 °C. 125I-Labeled HDL (296–649 cpm/ng protein) and 125I-labeled apoA-I (358–470 cpm/ng protein) were prepared using the iodine monochloride method (25.Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, the HDL fractions that were used for iodination and subsequently in the competition experiments were in the density range 1.1–1.14 g/ml. The protein concentrations of the HDL preparations, apolipoproteins, and cell lysates were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (26.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apolipoprotein composition of the preparations was assessed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of gradient (6–20%) SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Native and radiolabeled HDL preparations were periodically monitored, and preparations were discarded if evidence of abnormal electrophoretic mobility, presumably due to radiolysis/oxidation, was observed. The binding properties of such modified HDLs differ from those of native HDL (e.g.increased binding affinity for SR-BI; not shown). Pre-β-1 HDL and α HDL were purified from freshly drawn venous blood under nondenaturing conditions as described by Kunitake et al.(27.Kunitake S.T. Chi Chen G. Kung S.-F. Schilling J.W. Hardman D.A. Kane J.P. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Typically, blood pooled from two donors (360 ml) is drawn into a mixture containing 1 mmsodium EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 10 μg/ml α-2 macroglobulin, 0.13% ε-aminocaproic acid, 0.3 mg/ml benzamidine, 1 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate and cooled immediately on ice, and plasma is separated by low speed centrifugation (1,800 × g, 30 min). Plasma aliquots (20 ml) were subjected to anti-apoA-I (affinity-purified IgG) immunoaffinity column chromatography. The binding fraction consisting of apoA-I-containing lipoproteins (LpA-I) was eluted with 0.2 m acetic acid (pH 3.0) and immediately neutralized to pH 7.0 with 2 m Tris buffer. The fraction was further processed over Sepharose columns covalently coupled with affinity-purified anti-human serum albumin IgG and protein A. The pooled LpA-I material was reduced in volume by ultrafiltration (spiral ultrafiltration cartridge, type S3Y10 (Amicon), Ultrafree (5,000 molecular weight cut-off; Millipore Corp.) and resolved by preparative slab gel-agarose electrophoresis into five discrete fractions (β, pre-β-1, pre-β-2, α-1, α). Pre-β-1 HDL from the pre-β-1 and pre-β-2 zones was recovered by electroelution and subjected to molecular sieve and anion exchange chromatography. Molecular sieve chromatography consisted of two Superose 12 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) connected in series operating at 0.03 ml/min at 3 °C in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.02% NaN3. Anion exchange chromatography consisted of two (1-ml) Hi Trap Q columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), connected in series and operated at 0.5 ml/min at 3 °C. Pre-β HDL eluted in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 40 mm NaCl. Pre-β-1 HDL was characterized for particle size distribution by electrophoresis through a 2–45% concave acrylamide gradient gel in a vertical gel apparatus (MiniProtean; Bio-Rad) modified for cooling at 10 °C for 3,000 V-h. Calibrator proteins (high molecular weight; Pharmacia) were supplemented with human low density lipoprotein (d = 1.030–1.050 g/ml) and molecular sieve-purified ovalbumin to yield a dynamic Stokes radii range of 3.0–12.5 nm. Analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2–25% linear acrylamide gradient) revealed the presence of a single apoA-I band free of proteolytic peptides. Preparations exhibiting evidence of apoA-I proteolysis were discarded. Typically, 2 mg of pre-β-1 HDL were obtained with an overall recovery of 15%. Yields depend in part on the starting plasma levels, which vary among individual donors, as determined by quantitative agarose immunoblotting (28.Ishida B.Y. Albee D. Paigen B. J. Lipid. Res. 1990; 31: 227-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and isotope dilution ultrafiltration assays (29.O'Connor P.M. Naya-Vigne J.M. Duchateau P.N. Ishida B.Y. Mazur M. Zysow B.R. Malloy M.J. Kunitake S.T. Kane J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Purified apolipoprotein A-I was prepared from plasma as described previously (30.Scanu A.M. Edelstein C. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Complexes comprising apolipoprotein, POPC, and cholesterol were prepared using the sodium cholate dialysis method (31.Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4535-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using an apoA-I/POPC/cholesterol molar ratio of 1:100:10, as previously reported (1.Xu S. Laccotripe M. Huang X. Rigotti A. Zannis V.I. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1289-1298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apolipoprotein-lipid complex formation was verified by analysis with native polyacrylamide gradient (8–25%) gel electrophoresis (Pharmacia Phast gel system; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The lipid-free apoA-I that was not incorporated in the lipid protein complexes was removed from the preparation either by dialysis using a dialysis membrane with a molecular weight cut-off of 50,000 or by gel filtration using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superose 6HR column, 10/30 (total bed volume 24 ml). Control (ldlA-7) cells and a cell line expressing murine SR-BI receptor derived from ldlA-7 cells (ldlA[mSR-BI]) have been described previously (2.Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K. Xu S. Hobbs H.H.

The ldlA-7 cells were maintained in monolayer culture in Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (medium A). The ldlA[mSR-BI] cells were maintained as stock cultures in medium A supplemented with 500 μg/ml G418 (medium B). All incubations with cells were performed at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air incubator. SR-BI activity at 37 °C was assessed by measuring cell association of radiolabeled ligands, as described previously (1.Xu S. Laccotripe M. Huang X. Rigotti A. Zannis V.I. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1289-1298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M.

For direct association saturation curves, incubations were performed in the absence (total cell association, duplicate determinations) or presence (nonspecific cell association, single determinations) of a 40-fold protein mass excess of unlabeled HDL. For competition curves, duplicate incubations were performed in the absence or presence of the indicated unlabeled competitors. The cell association of 125I-ligands was analyzed as a function of concentration by nonlinear regression (using the Prism program). The best fit was found for the model with high affinity binding to a specific site plus low affinity binding to other sites (background) as described below for the immunoreceptor assay. The specific, high affinity cell association activities presented in the saturation curves represent the differences between the average total cell association and nonspecific cell association values and are expressed as ng of protein of HDL or apolipoprotein complex associated per mg of total cell protein. The total cell association values presented in the saturation curves are expressed as ng of protein of HDL or apolipoprotein complex associated with the cells per mg of total cell protein. Cell association for the competition assays is presented as the average percentage of control values determined in the absence of inhibitors. Each of the binding/competition experiments shown is representative of the results obtained in at least two and often four or more independent experiments. To measure the cell association of unlabeled ligands, we used the following assay. On day 0, ldlA-7 and ldlA[mSR-BI] cells were plated in six-well dishes at 3 × 105 cells/well in medium A (ldlA-7) or medium B (ldlA[mSR-BI]). On day 2, the monolayers were washed twice with Ham's F-12 medium and then refed with 0.7–1 ml of medium C (Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.5% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine) with the indicated amounts of lipid-free apoA-I, apoA-I-POPC-cholesterol complexes, or spherical HDL. After a 1.5-h incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed twice at 4 °C with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl containing 2 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, followed by one rapid wash with buffer B alone. The cells were then solubilized in lysis buffer (PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and incubated, with shaking, at 4 °C for 30 min. The collected lysates (after scraping) were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a Beckman microcentrifuge for 20 min at 4 °C. The protein concentrations of the cell lysates were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (26.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An aliquot of 20–30 μg of the lysate was analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and in independent lanes the same ligand"
https://openalex.org/W1971426454,"The Siglecs are a subfamily of I-type lectins (immunoglobulin superfamily proteins that bind sugars) that specifically recognize sialic acids. We report the cloning and characterization of human Siglec-9. The cDNA encodes a type 1 transmembrane protein with three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and a cytosolic tail containing two tyrosines, one within a typical immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM). The N-terminal V-set Ig domain has most amino acid residues typical of Siglecs. Siglec-9 is expressed on granulocytes and monocytes. Expression of the full-length cDNA in COS cells induces sialic-acid dependent erythrocyte binding. A recombinant soluble form of the extracellular domain binds to alpha2-3 and alpha2-6-linked sialic acids. Typical of Siglecs, the carboxyl group and side chain of sialic acid are essential for recognition, and mutation of a critical arginine residue in domain 1 abrogates binding. The underlying glycan structure also affects binding, with Galbeta1-4Glc[NAc] being preferred. Siglec-9 shows closest homology to Siglec-7 and both belong to a Siglec-3/CD33-related subset of Siglecs (with Siglecs-5, -6, and -8). The Siglec-9 gene is on chromosome 19q13.3-13.4, in a cluster with all Siglec-3/CD33-related Siglec genes, suggesting their origin by gene duplications. A homology search of the Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes suggests that Siglec expression may be limited to animals of deuterostome lineage, coincident with the appearance of the genes of the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1981583374,"Peptides structurally related to mammalian tachykinins have recently been isolated from the brain and intestine of several insect species, where they are believed to function as both neuromodulators and hormones. Further evidence for the signaling role of insect tachykinin-related peptides was provided by the cloning and characterization of cDNAs for two tachykinin receptors fromDrosophila melanogaster. However, no endogenous ligand has been isolated for the Drosophila tachykinin receptors to date. Analysis of the Drosophila genome allowed us to identify a putative tachykinin-related peptide prohormone (prepro-DTK) gene. A 1.5-kilobase pair cDNA amplified from aDrosophila head cDNA library contained an 870-base pair open reading frame, which encodes five novel D rosophila tachykinin-related peptides (called DTK peptides) with conserved C-terminal FXGXR-amide motifs common to other insect tachykinin-related peptides. The tachykinin-related peptide prohormone gene (Dtk) is both expressed and post-translationally processed in larval and adult midgut endocrine cells and in the central nervous system, with midgut expression starting at stage 17 of embryogenesis. The predictedDrosophila tachykinin peptides have potent stimulatory effects on the contractions of insect gut.

Vertebrate tachykinins represent a large family of peptides that elicit a wide range of both central and peripheral responses (2Erspamer V.

Like other biologically active peptides, substance P is derived from a larger prohormone polypeptide (preprotachykinin A (PPT-A)1) that also allows the production of several other biologically active peptides (neurokinin A, neuropeptide K, and neuropeptide γ) (6Carter M.S. Krause J.E. J. Neurosc. 1990; 10: 2203-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three different isoforms of preprotachykinin can be produced as a result of alternative splicing of the PPT-A mRNA, which, in conjunction with alternative post-translational processing of the prohormone, allows the production of these peptides in a tissue-specific manner (7Nawa H.

The tachykinin family is not confined to vertebrates, and a large number of tachykinins have now been isolated from a variety of invertebrate species such as the cockroach Leucophaea maderae (11Muren J.E.

Peptides (Elmsford). 1997; 18: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the mosquito Culex salinarius (13Meola S.M. Clottens F.L. Holman G.M. Nachman R.J. Nichols R. Schoofs L. Wright M.S. Olson J.K. Hayes T.K. Pendleton M.W. Neurochem. Res. 1998; 23: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the echiuroid worm Urechis unicinctus (14Ikeda T. Minakata H. Nomoto K. Kubota I. Muneoka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast to the vertebrate tachykinins, almost all of the invertebrate tachykinins contain a conserved C-terminal FXGXR-amide motif and, for this reason, have been termed tachykinin-related peptides (TRPs). Notable exceptions are eledoisin, sialokinin I, and sialokinin II, which were isolated from the salivary glands of the cephalopod Eledone moschata and the mosquito Aedes aegypti, respectively, and which contain a C-terminal FXGLM-amide like the vertebrate tachykinins (2Erspamer V. Trends Neurosci. 1981; 4: 267-273Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (411) Google Scholar,16Erspamer V. Experientia (Basel). 1962; 18: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 17Champagne D.E. Ribeiro J.M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Antisera to insect TRPs display immunoreactivity in both the gut and the nervous system of a variety of insect species (18Nässel D.R. Lundquist C.T. Muren J.E. Winther Å.M.E. Coast G.M. Webster S.G.

Peptides (Elmsford). 1999; 20: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), suggesting that, like the mammalian tachykinins, these peptides function as both neuromodulators and endocrine signaling molecules. A tachykinin receptor (STKR) has recently been cloned and characterized from the stable fly (20Guerrero F.D. Peptides (Elmsford). 1997; 18: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and two tachykinin receptors have been characterized from Drosophila melanogaster: NKD and DTKR (21Li X.J. Wolfgang W. Wu Y.N. North R.A. Forte M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3221-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 22Monnier D. Colas J.F. Rosay P. Hen R. Borrelli E. Maroteaux L. J. Biol.

Although expressed NKD and DTKR show responses to the locust peptide LomTK-II and to substance P and physalaemin, respectively, to date, no tachykinins or tachykinin-related peptides have been isolated from D. melanogaster. As a consequence, the endogenous ligands for NKD and DTKR are not known. A tachykinin precursor cDNA has recently been cloned from the mosquito A. aegypti that contains only a single tachykinin-like peptide, sialokinin I (24Beerntsen B.T. Champagne D.E. Coleman J.L. Campos Y.A. James A.A. Insect Mol. Biol. 1999; 8: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Sialokinins are thought to be released into mosquito saliva and thus enter the host at a blood meal. However, as described above, the sialokinins are atypical compared with other invertebrate TRPs and may be the result of convergent evolution to exploit vertebrate tachykinin receptors (17Champagne D.E. Ribeiro J.M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It therefore remains unclear whether other insect TRPs are synthesized from precursor molecules containing single or multiple copies of TRPs. Here we demonstrate for the first time the existence of an insect TRP prohormone gene (Dtk) that, like the mammalian PPT-A gene, codes for multiple copies of novel D rosophila tachykinin-related peptides referred to as DTK peptides. In addition, we show that this gene is expressed in a restricted number of cell bodies in the brain and ventral nerve cord and in midgut endocrine cells, a site at which we demonstrate potent biological activity using the mature peptides. Sequence alignment showed that Dtk displays 31% sequence identity to human PTT-A in its substance P and neurokinin A progenitor sequences. Unless otherwise stated, reagents were of molecular biology grade and purchased from Sigma. DTK peptides were synthesized via Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid-phase methodology on an Applied Biosystems 433A peptide synthesizer according to previously described conditions (25Nachman R.J. Garside C.S. Tobe S.S. Peptides (Elmsford). 1999; 20: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and were quantified by amino acid analysis. A TBLASTN search (26Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68351) Google Scholar) of D. melanogaster genomic sequence (Berkley Drosophila Genome Project, Release Date September 1999) was carried out using the human PPT-A amino acid sequence (Swiss-Prot accession number P20366). Several BACs were identified that appeared to contain sequence coding for a tachykinin-like progenitor, and ab initio gene prediction was performed for a 5-kilobase pair region around these sequences using a Drosophila-specific version of FGENESH. Signal peptide prediction was performed using SignalP Version 1.1 (27Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar). Using the FGENESH-predicted coding sequence of Dtk, 5′- and 3′-RACE primers were designed to amplify two overlapping fragments of the Dtk cDNA from an adult head cDNA library (Berkley Drosophila Genome Project GH Library): 5′-RACE primers, 5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-3′ and 5′-AGCTTGCTCATGATCGTCAC-3′; and 3′-RACE primers, 5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′ and 5′-ACGTCTCCCACCAGCACTAC-3′. Touchdown polymerase chain reaction was performed using the following program: one cycle of 5 min at 95 °C; two cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 66 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; two cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 64 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; two cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 62 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; two cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 2 min 72 °C; two cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 58 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; two cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; one cycle of 10 min at 72 °C. The largest polymerase chain reaction products from each reaction were cloned into a TA vector (Promega pGemTeasy TA vector) and sequenced. A 1.2-kilobase pair fragment of the Dtk cDNA, derived by 5′-RACE and containing the first two exons and 126 bp of the third exon, was cloned into a TA vector. This plasmid was linearized using either SalI (for the sense probe) or NcoI (for the antisense probe), and digoxigenin-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes were synthesized using T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases (Promega), respectively, and digoxigenin-labeled dNTPs (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In situ hybridization was performed on wild-type (Oregon R strain) embryos, larvae, or adults using a modification of the method described previously (28Tautz D. Pfeifle C. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1989; 98: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar). Dechorionization, devitellinization, and fixation of embryos were performed as described previously (29Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 122-123Google Scholar). Embryos were stored in ethanol at −20 °C until required. Prior to fixing, embryos were rinsed in 1:1 ethanol/xylene; soaked for 2 h in xylene; and then rinsed successively in 1:1 ethanol/xylene, ethanol, and methanol and 1:1 methanol/postfix (10 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% formaldehyde). Adult or third instar larval tissues were dissected and stored in Drosophila saline (0.7% NaCl and 0.03% Triton X-100) for up to 30 min before use. Samples were fixed in postfix for 20 min at room temperature, followed by three washes with PBT (10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 140 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20), and were incubated with proteinase K in PBT (4 μg/ml) for 3 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by two washes with PBT containing 2 mg/ml glycine, and the samples were washed twice with PBT before being incubated with postfix for a further 20 min at room temperature. The tissues were washed with five changes of PBT, followed by one wash with hybridization buffer (5× SSC containing 50% formamide, 10 mm KPO4, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml glycogen, 0.2 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 0.1% Tween 20 (pH 7.0)) diluted 1:2 with PBT and a further wash with hybridization buffer prior to a 1-h preincubation with hybridization buffer at 55 °C. Samples were then incubated for 43 h at 55 °C with 100 μl of hybridization buffer containing 17 ng of either the sense or antisense riboprobe. Following hybridization, the samples were washed four times with hybridization buffer at 55 °C, followed by a final wash overnight with hybridization buffer at 55 °C. Samples were washed once with 50% hybridization buffer and 50% PBT, followed by four washes with PBT, and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 1.0 ml of preadsorbed alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin Fab fragment (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) diluted 1:2000 with PBT. Unbound antibody was removed by extensive washing with PBT, and bound antibody was visualized by incubating the samples with staining buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 100 mmNaCl, 9.4% formaldehyde, 50 mm MgCl2, 50 mm EGTA, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), and 0.1% Tween 20) either for 1 h at room temperature or for 16 h at 4 °C with one change of staining buffer. Development was stopped by extensive washing with PBT containing 50 mm EDTA. Mixed-stage embryos and tissues of larval (second and third instar) and adult wild-typeDrosophila (Oregon R strain) were used for immunocytochemistry. Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer for 3–4 h. Central nervous systems and intestines were used for whole-mount immunocytochemistry as described (30Lundquist C.T. Clottens F.L. Holman G.M. Riehm J.P. Bonkale W. Nässel D.R. J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 341: 225-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with an antiserum raised against the locust TRP LomTK-I (31Nässel D.R. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 274: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:1000. Either the peroxidase/anti-peroxidase technique or immunofluorescence with a secondary antiserum tagged with Cy3 was used. A number of adult brains and intestines were used for immunocytochemistry (peroxidase/anti-peroxidase method) of cryostat sections. Preabsorption controls were made with antiserum (at 1:1000) incubated with 50 nmol of LomTK-I. The specificity of the antiserum has been established previously (30Lundquist C.T. Clottens F.L.

Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 274: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The DTK peptides were tested for their myostimulatory action in an in vitrohindgut muscle contraction assay utilizing the gut of the cockroachL. maderae (32Holman G.M. Nachman R.J. Schoofs L. Hayes T.K. Wright M.S. De Loof A. Insect Biochem. 1991; 21: 107-112Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 33Winther Å.M.E. Muren J.E. Lundquist C.T. Osborne R.H. Nässel D.R. Peptides (Elmsford). 1998; 19: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The increases in amplitude of spontaneous contractions of the hindgut were monitored at different concentrations of peptides and plotted in percent of maximum contraction for each intestine. Dose-response curves were fitted to a four-parameter logistic equation (GraphPAD Prism Version 2.0). Each peptide was tested on three to five intestines, and the L. maderae peptide LemTRP-1 was used as a reference. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. DTK-1–5 were tested for myotropic activity on isolated midgut from adult insects. The gut was severed anterior to the crop and posterior to the midgut-hindgut junction and dissected free of tracheal connections and malpighian tubules. The entire midgut was then transferred to a small chamber (∼250-μl volume) and perfused with saline of the following composition: 105 mm NaCl, 5 mmKNO3, 5 mm CaCl2, 3 mmMgSO4·7H2O, 10 mml-histidine, and 28 mm glucose. The pH was adjusted to 6.8 with 0.1 m NaOH (34Cook B.J. Chen A.C. Pryor N.W. J. Entomol. Sci. 1997; 32: 487-499Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Contractions were recorded using an optical transducer as described (35Coast G.M. Peptides (Elmsford). 1998; 19: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 36Holman G.M. Nachman R.J. Coast G.M. Peptides (Elmsford). 1999; 20: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The chamber was perfused at ∼800 μl/min, and peptides dissolved in saline were added to the perfusate using a 0.5-ml injection loop and rheodyne valve. Each peptide was tested on five to six midguts at concentrations from 0.1 nm to 1 μm, preliminary studies having found no evidence for receptor desensitization. Data were normalized by expressing contraction height as a percentage of the maximum response obtained with the TRP under investigation, and dose-response curves were fitted to a four-parameter logistic equation (GraphPAD Prism Version 3.00) with the maximum and minimum responses set at 100 and 0%, respectively. TBLASTN searches using the human PPT-A amino acid sequence identified several BACs (GenBankTM/EBI accession numbers AC007692, AC007889, and AC007890) containing genomic sequence coding for part of a tachykinin-like peptide progenitor sequence that aligned with the neurokinin A progenitor sequence of human PPT-A. Subsequently, a fourth BAC was also identified (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AC020418). Ab initio gene prediction revealed a putative three-exon gene. The coding sequence of this predicted Drosophila tachykinin gene (Dtk) contains five copies of glycine-extended tachykinin-like peptides, each flanked by pairs of basic residues, and a predicted N-terminal signal peptide for targeting of the prohormone to the secretory pathway. A 1558-bp cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from an adult Drosophila head cDNA library as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cDNA contains an 870-bp open reading frame, 120 bp of 5′-untranslated region, and a 568-bp 3′-untranslated region that includes a 23-bp-long poly(A) tail (Fig.1). Translation of the open reading frame confirmed the prediction of sequences corresponding to five tachykinin-related peptides (DTK-1–5) (TableI) flanked by pairs of basic residues, which presumably serve as processing sites for prohormone convertases. In addition to the DTK peptides, an additional six possible peptide products, called tachykinin-associated peptides (TAP-1–6) (Table I), exist in the prohormone sequence. Three of these peptide sequences (TAP-1, TAP-2, and TAP-5) have a C-terminal Gly residue and therefore have the potential to be processed to amidated peptides, as shown in Table I. TAP-5 has a structure at the C terminus similar to a recently isolated tachykinin-related peptide from another dipteran, Stomoxys calcitrans (37Nachman R.J. Moyna G. Williams H.J. Zabrocki J. Zadina J.E. Coast G.M. Vanden Broeck J. Neuropeptides. 1999; 897: 388-400Google Scholar). All the other TAPs are novel sequences showing little homology to known bioactive peptides.Table IAmino acid sequences of DTK-1–5 and TAP-1–6PeptideSequenceDTK-1APTSSFIGMR-amideDTK-2APLAFVGLR-amideDTK-3APTGFTGMR-amideDTK-4APVNSFVGMR-amideDTK-5APNGFLGMR-amideTAP-1DEEHDTSEGNWLGSGPDPLDYADEEADSSYAEN-amideTAP-2FIPINNRLSDVLQSLEEERLRDSLLQDFFDRVAGRDGSAV-amideTAP-3PALLAGGDDAEADEATELQQTAP-4DVSHQHYTAP-5AALSDSYDLRGKQQRFADFNSKFVAVR-amideTAP-6SDLEGNGVGIGDNHEQALVHPWLYLWGEEach of the DTK peptides contains a conserved FX1GX2R-amide motif common to other invertebrate tachykinin-related peptides.

BACs containing the Dtk sequence (GenBankTM/EBI accession numbers AC007692 and AC007889) map to region 87A4–87B2 of the right arm of chromosome 3. Dtkspans 11.2 kilobase pairs of genomic sequence and contains four exons and three introns, the first intron being 9292 bp in size (Fig.2). Sequences coding for DTK-1–4 are contained in exon 2, whereas the DTK-5 progenitor sequence is contained in the third exon. The first exon contains entirely 5′-untranslated region. Analysis of the genomic sequence upstream of Dtk(NNPP Version 2.1 (38Reese, M. G., and Eeckman, F. H. (1995) The Seventh International Genome Sequencing and Analysis Conference Hilton Head Island, SCGoogle Scholar, 39Reese M.G. Kulp D. Tammana H. Haussler D. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar)) revealed a predicted transcriptional start site 38 bp upstream of the 5′-end of the sequenced DtkcDNA and a TATA box 30 bp farther upstream. The cDNA that we have sequenced therefore appears to be almost full-length. The central nervous system and the intestines of dipteran insects are known to be rich sources of tachykinin-related peptides; and therefore, these tissues, along with 0–24-h embryos, were selected for in situhybridization studies. Strong staining was observed in a group of 14 cells plus one isolated cell in the midgut of stage 17 embryos (Fig. 3). Staining in the midgut was not observed at earlier stages. In addition, at the same stage, Dtk was expressed in a pair of medially located unidentified cells, just posterior to the brain, and in two lateral groups of cells that may be associated with tracheae. Expression of Dtk in the larval gut was restricted to cells with endocrine cell-like morphology in the posterior midgut, just anterior to the malphigian tubules (Fig.4, A and B). Expression in the adult female gut was also restricted to the midgut, with no Dtk transcript detected in the hindgut (Fig.4 C). However, in contrast to the third instar larval midgut,Dtk expressing-cells were detected throughout the length of the adult female midgut, with the exception of a region toward the middle of the midgut (one-third of the midgut length) in which we have not been able to detect Dtk-expressing cells in any of the samples examined (more than five specimens). The cells showing a hybridization signal in the female adult midgut also appeared to be endocrine cells; however, they were more numerous, smaller, and more elongated than those staining in the larval midgut (Fig.4 C). In the brain of third instar larvae, the Dtktranscript was detected in a restricted number of neuronal cell bodies (Figs. 4, E and F; and 6A). There were nine pairs of cell bodies displaying a strong hybridization signal in the brain and another four pairs displaying a weaker signal (12 well labeled central nervous systems were analyzed). In the ventral nerve cord, two pairs of cell bodies were detected in the metathoracic neuromere and eight pairs in abdominal neuromeres (Figs. 4 G and 6 A).Figure 4Micrographs showing the DtkmRNA transcript in Drosophila tissues detected by in situ hybridization.

Five pairs of protocerebral (Pr 1–5) and two pairs of tritocerebral (Tr 1–2) LTK-LI cell bodies were seen in all specimens. In the metathoracic ganglion, two pairs of neurons were detected (MT 1). In abdominal ganglia, immunolabeling was variable; often only anterior located cell bodies were seen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunocytochemistry was performed onDrosophila brain, midgut, and hindgut with an antiserum to the locust peptide LomTK-I. This antiserum is known to cross-react with peptides of the family of invertebrate TRPs, but with no other known peptides. In the larval central nervous system, 22 neurons were consistently labeled with this antiserum. Of these, 18 were in the brain and subesophageal ganglion (Figs. 5, A and B; and 6B). Two pairs of Locusta tachykinin-like immunoreactive (LTK-LI) neurons (DN 1 and DN 2) with cell bodies in the subesophageal ganglion formed varicose axons that descended throughout the ventral nerve cord (thoracic and abdominal ganglia) (Figs.5 A and 6 B). Two pairs of tritocerebral neurons (Tr 1 and Tr 2) formed branches in tritocerebral neurophils (Fig. 5 B). The remaining five pairs of neurons (Pr 1–5) formed processes locally in the protocerebrum (Figs. 5,A and B; and 6B). Two pairs of LTK-LI neuronal cell bodies were seen in the metathoracic part of the ventral nerve cord (Fig. 6 B). Immunolabeling of cell bodies in the abdominal neuromeres was inconsistent, but occasionally, segmentally arranged cell bodies could be seen. The same neurons were also present in the brain and ventral nerve cord of second instar larvae (Fig.5 C). In the adult brain of Drosophila, there are many more LTK-LI neurons, and they form complex arborizations in brain neuropils (18Nässel D.R. Lundquist C.T. Muren J.E. Winther Å.M.E. Coast G.M.

However, the molecular identity of this myocardial PLD and the mechanisms that regulate it are not well understood. Using subcellular fractionation and Western blot analysis, we found that PLD2 is the major myocardial PLD and that it localizes primarily to sarcolemmal membranes. A 100-kDa PLD2-interacting cardiac protein was detected using a protein overlay assay employing purified PLD2 and then identified as α-actinin using peptide-mass fingerprinting with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy. The direct association between PLD2 and α-actinin was confirmed using an in vitro binding assay and localized to PLD2's N-terminal 185 amino acids. Purified α-actinin potently inhibits PLD2 activity (IC50 = 80 nm) in an interaction-dependent and ADP-ribosylation factor-reversible manner. Finally, α-actinin co-localizes with actin and with PLD2 in the detergent-insoluble fraction from sarcolemmal membranes. These results suggest that PLD2 is reciprocally regulated in sarcolemmal membranes by α-actinin and ARF1 and accordingly that a major role for PLD2 in cardiac function may involve reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.

Physiol. 1995; 269: 349-358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inducing phosphorylation of cardiac proteins (5.Bocckino S.B. Wilson P.B. Exton J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 1996; 271: 651-659PubMed Google Scholar). Prolonged activation of cardiac PLD has also been linked to cardiac hypertrophy, potentially through the conversion of PA to diacylglycerol, the endogenous activator of protein kinase C (PKC) (1.Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Many hormones, neurotransmitters and growth factors exert their cellular effects through PA. Catecholamine (7.Novakova O. Drnkova J. Kubista V. Novak F. Physiol. Res. 1994; 43: 151-156PubMed Google Scholar), angiotensin II (8.Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 424-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and endothelin-1 (9.Ye H. Wolf R.A. Kurz T. Corr P.B. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 1828-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) are all able to stimulate the production of PA in cardiomyocytes, presumably through some combination of Ca2+ mobilization and the actions of small GTP-binding proteins (ARF and Rho family members), PKC, and tyrosine phosphorylation (1.Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, the molecular identity of myocardial PLD and the specific mechanisms that regulate it remain unknown. Mammalian PLD has been implicated in a wide range of physiological processes and diseases including inflammation, secretion, mitogenesis, cytoskeletal rearrangement and respiratory bursts in neutrophils (10.Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Two types of mammalian PLD, PLD1 and PLD2, have been cloned (1.Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). PLD1 has low basal activity, requires PIP2 for its activation, and is activated by PKC and by ARF and Rho small G-protein family members via direct association (11.Lee T.G. Park J.B. Lee S.D. Hong S. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Yi K.S. Bae S. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1347: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12.Kim J.H. Lee S.D. Han J.M. Lee T.G.

PLD2 also requires PIP2 for its enzymatic activity (15.Sciorra V.A Rudge S.A. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5911-5921Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), but unlike PLD1, it can be activated by unsaturated fatty acids such as oleate (16.Kim J.H. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). PLD2 is constitutively active in vitro, and its activity in that setting is relatively insensitive to the PLD1-activating factors PKCα, ARF, and Rho (17.Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J.

The finding that purified PLD2 is constitutively active in vitro led to the proposal that PLD2 may be regulated in vivo by negative regulatory agents that are released upon agonist stimulation. In this study, we report that the major myocardial PLD isozyme is PLD2 and that it localizes to the sarcolemmal (SL) membrane. Furthermore, we suggest that PLD2 is negatively regulated by α-actinin through direct interaction and that this inhibition can be overcome by ARF. These results provide the basis for a more detailed model for PLD2 regulationin vivo. The enhanced chemiluminescence kit and dipalmitoylphosphatidyl [methyl-3H]choline were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (dipalmitoyl-PC), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, and GTPγS were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Anti-α-actinin antibody and sodium oleate were purchased from Sigma. A polyclonal antibody that recognized both PLD1 and PLD2 was produced as described previously (16.Kim J.H. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The anti-ARF and the PLD2-specific polyclonal antibodies were a generous gift from Dr. J. David Lambeth (Emory University). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-mouse IgA+IgM+IgG were from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories. Nickel-agarose, DEAE-Sepharose, and phenyl-Sepharose resin were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Protein A-Sepharose was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Frozen rat heart was processed for the preparation of purified SL membranes according to Pitts (18.Pitts B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6232-6235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, rat ventricles were minced and homogenized in 0.6 m sucrose, 10 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.0, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet (P1) was discarded, while the supernatant (S1) was diluted with 160 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4 (KCl/MOPS), and centrifuged at 96,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant (S2) was removed, and the pellet (P2) was resuspended in KCl/MOPS, layered on top of a 30% sucrose solution containing 0.3m KCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and centrifuged at 95,000 × g (Beckman SW 41 rotor) for 90 min. The band at the sample-sucrose interface (SL) and the pellet (sarcoplasmic reticulum) was recovered. The SL fraction was diluted with 5 volumes of KCl/MOPS and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The SL pellet was resuspended in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm CaCl2, 3 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KC1) and stored at −70 °C until use. To generate the detergent-insoluble proteins, sarcolemmal membranes were incubated with buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C. The detergent-insoluble pellets (SLDIF) were separated by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, washed twice in buffer A with 1% Triton X-100, and resuspended in buffer A without detergent. COS-7 cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were cultured at 27 °C in TC-100 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Recombinant human PLD2 was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (12.Kim J.H. Lee S.D. Han J.M. Lee T.G. Kim Y. Park J.B. Lambeth J.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Rat heart membrane proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were preincubated for 14 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5% (w/v) skim milk), rinsed with Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and then incubated 1 h at room temperature with overlay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2% Tween 20, 5% (w/v) skim milk) containing 1 μg/ml PLD2. The membranes were then washed five times with Tris-buffered saline and incubated for 3 h with an anti-PLD antibody. After the washing, the membranes were then incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies and developed utilizing an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit. Rat heart tissue was homogenized in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aprotinin, 2 mm leupeptin, 1 mmpepstatin). The homogenate was spun for 45 min at 20,000 ×g to pellet most of the membrane fraction. The pellet was then resuspended and extracted with buffer B containing 1% cholic acid. The resulting membrane extracts (100 mg of protein in 50 ml) was applied to a Q-Sepharose anion-exchange column (1 cm × 10 cm). After washing the column with 40 ml of buffer B, bound proteins were eluted with a 40 ml of linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in buffer B. Fractions were collected and tested by the PLD2 overlay assay. Peak fractions were pooled and brought to 1.0 m NaCl by addition of solid salt and loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose (1 cm × 5 cm). Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min by applying a decreasing gradient of NaCl (1 to 0 m) in buffer B over a time of 60 min. The proteins in the fractions were then separated by SDS-PAGE and probed using the PLD2 overlay assay. Fractions of the phenyl-Sepharose were subjected to SDS-PAGE. After stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the candidate band was excised from the gel and digested with trypsin as described (19.Jensen O.N. Vorm O. Mann M. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 938-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A 1-μl aliquot of the total digest (total volume, 30 μl) was used for peptide mass fingerprinting (20.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar, 21.Mortz E. Vorm O. Mann M. Roepstorff P. Biol. Mass. Spectrom. 1994; 23: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The masses of the tryptic peptides were measured with a Voyager DE time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Perceptive Biosystems, Inc., Framingham, MA) in the Korea Basic Science Institute. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization was performed with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. Trypsin autolysis products were used for internal calibration. Delayed ion extraction resulted in peptide masses with better than 50 ppm mass accuracy on average. Comparison of the mass values against the SWISS-PROT data base was performed using Peptide Search (22.Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 4741-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). α-Actinin was purified from rat heart as described previously (23.Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1381-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and judged to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. Myristoylated recombinant ARF1 was expressed in E. coli and purified as described (24.Lambeth J.D. Kwak J.Y. Bowman E.P. Perry D. Uhlinger D.J. Lopez I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2431-2434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Wild-type murine PLD2, N-terminal 185-amino acid-deleted mutant PLD2 (PLD2Δ(1–185)), and the N-terminal 308-amino acid-deleted mutant PLD2 (PLD2Δ(1–308)) (25.Sung T.C. Altshuller Y.M. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 494-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) were transfected as described (26.Kim Y. Han J.M. Park J.B. Lee S.D. Oh Y.S.

Transfected cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% sodium cholate) containing protease inhibitors. After centrifugation (12,000 ×g for 15 min), aliquots of the soluble extract were incubated with anti-PLD antibody immobilized on protein A-Sepharose. The PLD2, PLD2Δ(1–185), and PLD2Δ(1–308) immune complexes were then incubated with purified α-actinin in 0.5 ml of buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl) for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting immune complexes were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer C containing 0.25% CHAPS and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-α-actinin or anti-PLD antibody. Cells transfected with the wild-type murine PLD2, N-terminal 185-amino acid-deleted mutant PLD2 (PLD2Δ(1–185)), and the N-terminal 308-amino acid-deleted mutant PLD2 (PLD2Δ(1–308)) were disrupted by sonication in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer D (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 3 mmEGTA, 2 mm CaCl2, 3 mmMgCl2, 80 mm KC1, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). The lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C and the pellet resuspended in buffer D and referred to as membranes. PIP2-dependent PLD activity was assessed by measuring choline release from phosphatidylcholine (PC) essentially as described previously (27.Kim Y. Kim J.E. Lee S.D. Lee T.G. Kim J.H. Park J.B. Han J.M. Jang S.K. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the purified PLD preparation were added to a standard assay mixture (150 μl) containing 125 μl of buffer D (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm CaCl2, 3 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KC1, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and 25 μl of phospholipid vesicles composed of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, PIP2, and dipalmitoyl-PC in a molar ratio of 16:1.4:1 and dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-[methyl-3H]choline (total 200,000 dpm/assay). The final concentration of PC was 3.3 μm. The assay mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Oleate-dependent activity was assayed as described earlier (16.Kim J.H. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In brief, PC vesicle (25 μl) containing 5 nmol of dipalmitoyl-PC and 200,000 dpm of dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-[methyl-3H]choline were added to a reaction mixture (175 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 2 mm EGTA, 1.7 mm CaCl2, 20 μm sodium oleate, and 100 mm KCl. The final concentration of PC was 25 μm in the reaction mixtures. The assay mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and the reactions terminated by addition of 0.3 ml of 1 n HCl in 5 mm EGTA and 1 ml of chloroform:methanol:HCl (50:50:0.3). After a brief centrifugation, the [methyl-3H]choline in 0.5 ml of the aqueous phase was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Purified recombinant human PLD2 (0.1 μg) was precipitated using immobilized anti-PLD antibody. The immune complexes were incubated with various concentrations of ARF1 and 100 nmα-actinin in 150 μl of buffer A at 37 °C for 15 min. The resulting immune complexes were washed twice with buffer A containing 0.25% CHAPS and analyzed by immunoblot with anti-ARF or anti-α-actinin antibody. Immunoblotting was performed as previously reported (12.Kim J.H. Lee S.D. Han J.M. Lee T.G. Kim Y. Park J.B. Lambeth J.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In brief, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane after SDS-PAGE. The membranes were blocked with TTBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl) containing 5% skim milk. Subsequently, the blots were incubated with the primary antibody for 3 h. The membrane was washed four times for 10 min with TTBS before being incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h. Visualization of the immune complexes was performed with horseradish peroxidase-dependent enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). We used polyclonal antisera that recognize both PLD1 and PLD2 (anti-PLD antibody) to determine which isoforms are expressed in heart. A band corresponding to PLD2 (105 kDa, as shown in the control lane) was weakly detected in a homogenate of rat heart (Fig. 1 A) and was highly enriched in a fraction consisting of sarcolemmal (plasma) membranes (SL). A band at the position that would correspond to PLD1 (120 kDa, as shown in the control lane) was not visualized in any fraction but this band was slightly detected in sarcolemma after long time-exposure (data not shown). To confirm that the band strongly recognized by the pan-PLD-specific antisera was PLD2, immunoblot analysis was performed utilizing an anti-PLD2-specific antibody (Fig.1 B). This antibody detected a band at the same position on the Western blot (105 kDa) and in the same fractionation samples as the more generic anti-PLD antibody. These results suggest that the major PLD isozyme in the rat heart is PLD2 and that it is present primarily in the sarcolemmal membrane, consistent with its localization primarily in the plasma membrane in other cell types (17.Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr.

Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y. Cell. 1999; 99: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). To search for proteins that interact with PLD2 in the sarcolemmal membrane, we carried out a protein overlay assay. Nitrocellulose blots of proteins from rat heart membrane extracts were incubated with purified PLD2, and the PLD2 bound was then detected using the anti-PLD antibody. A band corresponding to a protein 100 kDa (p100) in size was visualized and partially purified by sequential column chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” On an anionic Q-Sepharose exchange column, p100 eluted with a relatively broad profile (fractions 36–60, Fig.2 A). These fractions were pooled and further purified on phenyl-Sepharose, from which p100 eluted as a sharper peak (fractions 35–45). Analysis by SDS-PAGE revealed that these fractions contained a protein band with a molecular mass of 100 kDa, which matched the molecular weight of the protein reactive in the overlay assay (Fig. 2 B). To pursue identification of p100, the partially purified preparation was resolved using SDS-PAGE. The p100 candidate band was excised after Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and “in-gel” digested with trypsin. The resultant peptides were eluted and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometer (Fig. 3 A). A search for these masses in a comprehensive sequence data base showed that 14 masses matched to the calculated tryptic peptide masses of α-actinin with an accuracy of >50 ppm. These peptides covered 20% of the sequence of α-actinin (Fig. 3 B). Finally, the band at 100 kDa that was enriched in fractions 35–45 in the phenyl-Sepharose elute and detected using the PLD2 overlay assay was also detected by specific antibody to α-actinin (Fig.3 C). To further confirm the direct interaction between PLD2 and α−actinin, we incubated a purified recombinant human PLD2-anti-PLD-antibody complex with α-actinin purified from rat heart. Immunoblot analysis of the immune complex with anti-α-actinin antibody demonstrated that α-actinin was co-immunoprecipitated only when PLD2 was present (Fig.4 A, lane 3) and that the α-actinin-reactive band did not derive from the Sf9 cells from which the PLD2 was prepared (lane 2). Next, we explored whether PLD2 and α-actinin co-localize to the sarcolemmal membrane. Immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4 B) revealed that α-actinin and PLD2 are both present in sarcolemmal membranes and are enriched in the detergent-insoluble membrane fraction, consistent with the several reports that PLD2 can be found in this fraction when it is prepared from plasma membranes of several cell lines (15.Sciorra V.A Rudge S.A. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5911-5921Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 55.Czarny M. Lavie Y. Fiucci G. Liscovitch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2717-2724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Actin was weakly detected in the SL membranes but highly enriched in the detergent-insoluble membrane fraction, suggesting that not only do PLD2 and α-actinin associate, but they do so in the context of the actin cytoskeleton. PLD2 has four conserved catalytic regions (I–IV), a PIP2-binding site, a pleckstrin homology domain, and an N-terminal phox (PX) domain that has been proposed to mediate a wide variety of protein-protein interactions (1.Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 45.Houle M.G. Bourgoin S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 135-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A). Using COS-7 cells to overexpress wild-type and N-terminally deleted mutants of PLD2 (PLD2Δ(1–185) and PLD2Δ(1–308)), we found that truncation of the N-terminal 185 amino acids from PLD2 (which removes the PX domains but still yields a catalytically active enzyme) resulted in the complete loss of α-actinin binding to PLD2 (Fig. 5 B). It appears, therefore, that the N-terminal 185 amino acids contain a site critical for the interaction of PLD2 with α-actinin. We next examined whether α-actinin plays a role in the regulation of PLD2 by determining whether it affected PLD2 activity in the in vitro setting. As shown in Fig.6 A, purified α-actinin inhibited PIP2-dependent PLD2 activity in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 of the α-actinin -mediated inhibition was 80 nm, and inhibition was complete at 300 nm. α-Actinin does not have a pleckstrin homology domain but has been reported to bind PIP2 (29.Fukami K. Furuhashi K. Inagaki M. Endo T. Hatano S. Takenawa T. Nature. 1992; 359: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 30.Fukami K. Sawada N. Endo T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2646-2650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and PIP2 is a required co-factor for PLD2 activity in the standard in vitro assay system (15.Sciorra V.A Rudge S.A. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5911-5921Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar,16.Kim J.H. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25.Sung T.C. Altshuller Y.M. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 494-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the mechanism of the α-actinin inhibition might involve PIP2 sequestration, we examined the effect of α-actinin on oleate-dependent activation of PLD2, which is an alternate method for activation of PLD2 that does not require PIP2 (16.Kim J.H. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). α-Actinin similarly inhibited the oleate-dependent activation in a concentration-dependent manner. To further delineate the interaction and inhibition of α-actinin on PLD2 activity, we examined the effect of α-actinin on the deletion mutants of PLD2. We overexpressed wild-type and N-terminally deleted mutants of PLD2 (PLD2Δ(1–185) and PLD2Δ(1–308)), and used then COS-7 cell membranes as a source of PLD2. As in the above binding assay, α-actinin did not inhibit either of the N-terminally deleted mutants (PLD2Δ(1–185) and PLD2Δ(1–308)), whereas it inhibited whole PLD2 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6 B). These results led us to the conclusion that the observed inhibition occurred through direct interaction between α-actinin and the N-terminal region (1–185) of PLD2. ARF has been implicated as a potent activator of PLD1 in a variety of settings (1.Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has suggested the possibility that PLD2 may also be activated by ARF (25.Sung T.C. Altshuller Y.M. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol.

Altshuller Y.M. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 494-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We accordingly examined the possibility that inhibition of PLD2 by α-actinin might be countered by ARF1 stimulation. Upon addition of ARF1, PLD2 basal activity increased modestly, whereas the 60% inhibition mediated by addition of 100 nm α-actinin was almost completely eliminated (Fig.7 A). To further investigate the mechanism underlying this phenomena, we examined whether ARF1 affected the interaction between PLD2 and α-actinin. Recombinant PLD2 was pre-bound to anti-PLD antibody immobilized on protein A-Sepharose and incubated with α-actinin and ARF. We found that the interaction between PLD2 and α-actinin was disrupted by the presence of ARF1 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 7 B), which correlated with the reversal of inhibition in the in vitroactivity assay. These results suggest that ARF1 overcomes the α-actinin-attenuated activity of PLD2 by eliminating its interaction with PLD2. PLD is thought to play an important role in several different aspects of cardiac physiology (2.Dhalla N.S. Xu Y.J. Sheu S.S. Tappia P.S. Panagia V. J. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2083278809,"A family of inhibitory IκB molecules regulates the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. One member of the IκB family, IκBα, plays a major role in the rapid signal-induced activation of NF-κB. IκBα itself is transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB allowing for a tight autoregulatory loop that is both sensitive to and rapidly influenced by NF-κB activating stimuli. For this pathway to remain primed both for rapid activation of NF-κB in the presence of signal and then to suppress NF-κB activation once that signal is removed, IκBα must be exquisitely regulated. The regulation of IκBα is mainly accomplished through phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation. The mechanism(s) that regulate IκBα degradation needs to be able to target IκBα for degradation in both its NF-κB bound and free states in the cell. In this study, we utilize a full-length IκBα mutant that is unable to associate to RelA/p65. We show that the signal-induced IκB kinase (IKK) phosphorylation sites on IκBα can only significantly influence the regulation of signal-dependent but not signal-independent turnover of IκBα. We also demonstrate that the constitutive carboxyl-terminal casein kinase II phosphorylation sites are necessary for the proper regulation of both signal-dependent and -independent turnover of IκBα. These findings further elucidate how the phosphorylation of IκBα influences the complex regulatory mechanisms involved in maintaining a sensitive NF-κB pathway.

The NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors are a family of proteins that homo- and heterodimerize through a conserved Rel homology domain that consists of approximately 300 amino acids. The Rel homology domain of NF-κB is responsible for homo- and heterodimerization, DNA binding activity, and nuclear localization (3.Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Adv.

A large number of stimuli can cause NF-κB to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and activate target gene transcription. Stimuli that can activate NF-κB include proinflammatory cytokines, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, phorbol esters, okadaic acid, and viral infection (2.Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M.

IκB exerts its inhibitory effects by associating with the Rel homology domain of NF-κB proteins, effectively masking their nuclear localization signal (9.Baltimore D. Beg A.A.

Although there are a number of IκB proteins, IκBα is the primary regulator of rapid signal induced activation of NF-κB. Upon stimulation by a proinflammatory cytokine such as TNFα,1 a signaling cascade is initiated that results in the activation of the IκB kinases IKK1 and IKK2 (13.DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M.

This leads to the rapid phosphorylation of IκBα at the signal-induced phosphorylation sites, serine 32 and serine 36 (18–21). Once phosphorylated, IκBα is polyubiquitinated by the Ubc5/E3RSIκB ubiquitination enzyme pair (22.Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Davis M. Lavon I. Amit S. Manning A.M. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mercurio F.

Polyubiquitinated IκBα is degraded by the 26 S proteasome, thus exposing NF-κB's nuclear localization signal and allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus (27.Palombella V.J. Rando O.J.

A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). When the NF-κB inducing signal is removed the newly synthesized IκBα can suppress NF-κB activity by preventing it from binding to the genomic DNA, and sequestering NF-κB in the cytoplasm (31.Liou H.C.

Several phosphorylation sites have been identified on IκBα and they include the signal-induced IKK phosphorylation sites located at serine 32 and serine 36 (18–21), the constitutive CKII phosphorylation sites located in the carboxyl-terminal PEST domain (34.Barroga C.F.

Although extensive analysis of the signal-dependent degradation of IκBα has been done, little distinction has been made between the signal-dependent and -independent degradation of free and NF-κB-bound IκBα. Therefore, we undertook a study to examine the role of various phosphorylation sites on IκBα to determine their effects on both the signal-dependent and -independent degradation of free and NF-κB-bound IκBα. In this study, we characterize a full-length IκBα mutant that is unable to associate with NF-κB (designated as mutC) and exists as a free molecule in the cell. We also show that distinct phosphorylation sites can directly influence the efficiency of ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of free and NF-κB-associated IκBα in the presence or absence of stimuli. These results demonstrate the complexity of IκBα regulation necessary to ensure that NF-κB is rapidly and specifically activated by a diverse group of stimuli.

TNFα and β-lactone were used at final concentrations of 10 ng/ml and 10 μm, respectively, unless otherwise noted. Cyclohexamide was used at a final concentration of 75 μg/ml. Mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing. Wild-type (wt) murine IκBα, mutF (S283A, S288A, T291A, S293A, and T296A), 3236 (S32A and S36A), M (mutF and 3236 mutations combined), mutC (T247A, S252A, T257A, S262A, and T263A), and 3236mutC (3236 and mutC mutations combined) were ligated into theBamHI and HindIII sites of the pCMX-PL1 polylinker (40.Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). PCMX-RelA/p65 was described previously (30.Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Wild-type IκBα and the IκBα mutants were also ligated into the pCLBabepuro retroviral vector. pCLBabepuro is a derivative of the retroviral construct pBabepuro (41.Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). The pCMX-PL1-IκBα constructs and pCLBabepuro were cut with HindIII and EcoRI, respectively, and then blunted with Klenow. Both were then cut withBamHI and the resultingBamHI/HindIII(blunt) IκBα fragment was ligated into the BamHI/EcoRI(blunt) pCLBabepuro retroviral vector. In vitro transcription-translation was performed using the T7 promoter contained in the PCMX-PL1 vectors. Wild-type and mutant IκBα proteins labeled with [35S]methionine were produced using a wheat germ extract TNT kit as instructed by the manufacturer (Promega). 60 μl of the TNT reaction was used for each sample that was tested in the in vitro ubiquitination assay. 293 cell transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate method (42.Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Cell. 1978; 14: 725-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA was mixed in 0.625m CaCl2 and then added to an equal volume of 2 × HEPES buffer saline solution (560 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 1.5 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.1). The mixture was added to approximately 106 cells in 10 ml of medium and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h (h) in 3% CO2. The medium was then changed and the cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, in 10% CO2. Virus production for infection of the IκBα −/− MEF cell line was performed by calcium phosphate co-transfection of the 293gp packaging cell line with 20 μg of the pCLBabepuro retroviral vector, containing cDNAs for wild-type (wt) IκBα or the various IκBα mutants, and 5 μg of the pMDG plasmid containing the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVg) envelope downstream of the cytomegalovirus promotor-enhancer. After 48 h, the media was removed, filtered, Polybrene added (8 μg/ml), and it was immediately used for infection. Each infection was performed by adding 3 ml of 1:1000 diluted virus supernatant to approximately 105 cells for 6 h. The cells were allowed to expand for 48 h and the infected cells were selected using 6 μg/ml puromycin (Calbiochem). In order to get equivalent levels of expression in the mutC and 3236mutC stable pools it was necessary to perform three rounds of infection and selection as described above. The IκBα −/− MEF stable pools were stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNFα for the given time points. In some cases the MEFs were pretreated with 10 μm β-lactone, for 1 h, prior to stimulation. MEFs were also treated with β-lactone for the indicated times in the absence of signal. Cells were then washed 2 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and frozen on dry ice. Cytoplasmic extracts were made as described previously and separated on 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were probed with antibody, diluted 1:1,000 in 0.2% Tween-phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat milk, for 4 h at 4 °C. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit sera (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was diluted 1:3,000 and incubated with the membranes for 1 h at room temperature. Specific bands were then resolved by using a Renaissance detection kit (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) as instructed by the manufacturer. Nuclear extracts were made by the micropreparation technique (43.Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar), and gel shift analysis was performed as described previously (44.Inoue J. Kerr L.D. Ransone L.J. Bengal E. Hunter T. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3715-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of nuclear protein extract was incubated with 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), on ice, for 20 min to block nonspecific DNA binding activity. A32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the HIV-1 long terminal repeat κB site was then added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The resulting complexes were then resolved on a 4% acrylamide gel, exposed to a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and band intensities quantitated with ImageQuant software. HeLa cytoplasmic extracts, used in the in vitro ubiquitination assay, were made by lysis in hypotonic buffer (buffer A) containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, for 15 min, at 4 °C. Lysates were then concentrated with a Centricon 3 concentrator (Amicon) as instructed by the manufacturer. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay system. In vitro ubiquitination assays were carried out as described (29.Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar) with the following changes. Briefly, in vitro 35S-labeled IκBα was incubated with 5 mg/ml HeLa extract for 15 min at 4 °C. A reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 3.5 units/ml creatine kinase, 0.6 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, 1 mg/ml ubiquitin, 3 μm okadaic acid, 3 μmubiquitin aldehyde, and 10 μm β-lactone was then added and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) was substituted for the reaction mixture in control samples. After the incubation, RIPA (100 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide was added and the samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) by antibodies directed against IκBα or RelA/p65. IPs were carried out with 1.5 μg of the appropriate antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were precipitated by incubation with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellets were washed in RIPA buffer, SDS sample buffer was added, and the pellets were boiled for 5 min prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels. Following electrophoresis, the gels were fixed in glacial acetic acid, amplified with 2,5-diphenyloxazole, rinsed with H2O, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager for quantification. 6-cm plates of the IκBα −/− MEF stable pools were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h in 2 ml of cystine- and methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Labeling was performed for 3 h with 0.5 mCi of [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) per ml. Cells were then washed three times with complete medium and then chased for the given time points in complete medium. After each time point the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and cell pellets were frozen on dry ice for later manipulation. Cell pellets were thawed on ice and whole cell lysis was performed by adding 500 μl of RIPA (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% Triton X-100) containing the protease inhibitors aprotinin (10 μg/ml; Sigma) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm; Sigma). DNA was sheared by 10 passes through a 20-gauge needle and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, at 4 °C. The cleared lysates were measured for trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts and the lysates were normalized for labeling efficiency. Normalized lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated with RelA/p65 antiserum plus protein A-Sepharose for 4 h at 4 °C. To reduce the background, coimmunoprecipitations that were done with the RelA/p65 antiserum were subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation. The RelA/p65 antibody protein A-Sepharose pellets were boiled for 10 min in RIPA containing 100 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml and 0.5% SDS. The SDS was diluted to 0.1% with RIPA buffer that contained 100 μg of bovine serum albumin. A second IP was then done by adding IκBα antiserum and protein A-Sepharose to isolate the RelA/p65-associated IκBα. To isolate the free IκBα, the supernatant from the original Rela/p65 co-IP was incubated with IκBα antiserum and protein A-Sepharose. After immunoprecipitation, the pellets were washed in RIPA buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and the eluted proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. To investigate the signal-dependent degradation of IκBαin vivo, stable pools of IκBα −/− MEFs (39.Klement J.F. Rice N.R. Car B.D. Abbondanzo S.J. Powers G.D. Bhatt P.H. Chen C.H. Rosen C.A.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2341-2349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were generated by infecting naive IκBα −/− MEFs with recombinant retroviral vectors containing either wild type (wt) murine IκBα, one of the IκBα mutants (Fig. 1schematically describes IκBα mutations), or GFP. The mutants described in Fig. 1 represent mutations of known and possible sites of serine and threonine phosphorylation. These mutants were chosen for this study because they would aid in the further elucidation of the role of serine and threonine phosphorylation in the signal-dependent and -independent degradation mechanisms of free and NF-κB-bound IκBα. The IκBα −/− MEF infections were carried out at a multiplicity of infection of much less than one to ensure that on average, after selection, each cell of a stable pool would have only a single copy of the integrated recombinant retroviral vector. This kept expression levels low and as close to endogenous expression levels as possible. Fig.2 A compares the relative expression levels of endogenous IκBα in wt MEF cells to that of the transduced IκBα −/− stable pools. It can be seen that the levels of the IκBα proteins in the transduced cells are within 1–2-fold of the endogenous IκBα (Fig. 2, lane 8, +/+).Figure 2Signal-dependent activation of IκBα −/− MEF stable pools.

Quantitation of the relative expression level of IκBα in each cell line was done using NIH Image 1.62 software. The results are given graphically in arbitrary units. B,IκBα −/− MEFs were infected with a recombinant retroviral vector containing wild type murine IκBα or one of the mutants. The stable pools were treated with cyclohexamide prior to being stimulated with TNFα for 0, 5, 15, or 60 min. Following stimulation the cells were harvested, cytoplasmic extracts made, and Western blot analysis was performed with anti-IκBα sera. C, gel shift analysis of IκBα −/− MEF stable pools stimulated with TNFα for 60 min. Three independent experiments were done. Quantification was done on a PhosphorImager, using ImageQuant software. The values obtained were averaged and the standard deviations were calculated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TNFα stimulation of the IκBα −/− MEF stable pools in the presence of the translational inhibitor cyclohexamide show that, compared with wild type IκBα, the 3236 and M mutants were significantly more stable (Fig. 2 B). The M mutant shows no change in expression over the time course while the 3236 mutant starts to show a slight reduction at the 60-min time point. The mutF mutation gives IκBα partial resistance to TNFα-dependent degradation but is less stable than the 3236 and M mutants. The mutC mutant shows no increase in stability and, in fact, is significantly less stable than wt IκBα. The 3236mutC mutation confers an increase in the stability of mutC containing IκBα, but is significantly more unstable than the 3236 mutation by itself. The rate of IκBα degradation shown in Fig. 2 B was further examined by measuring the NF-κB DNA binding activity following TNFα stimulation. The mutF mutation shows an approximate 50% reduction in DNA binding activity when compared with wt IκBα (Fig. 2 C). The 3236 and M mutations reduce the gel shift activity to what is observed in unstimulated control cells. Interestingly, cell pools containing either the mutC or 3236mutC mutations show no significant reduction in NF-κB DNA binding activity. This is most likely due to the fact that the mutC mutation, which is a substitution of all five serine and threonine residues in the ank6 region of IκBα to alanine, disrupts the association of IκBα to NF-κB. Fig.3, A (in vitro) andB (in vivo), show that both mutC and 3236mutC do not associate with RelA/p65. It was recently shown that the ank6 region of IκBα makes a critical contact to NF-κB (11.Jacobs M.D. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 749-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 12.Huxford T. Huang D.B. Malek S. Ghosh G. Cell. 1998; 95: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Since the mutC mutation disrupts IκBαs association to NF-κB and blocks any potential phosphorylation of ank6, it is possible that phosphorylation of ank6 plays a critical role in IκBα's association to NF-κB. We conclude that (i) IKK phosphorylation is necessary for signal-dependent degradation of both free and NF-κB-associated IκBα, and (ii) that CKII phosphorylation is necessary for efficient signal-dependent degradation of NF-κB-associated IκBα. Next, in vitro ubiquitination assays were performed to determine the signal-induced ubiquitination profiles of both free and NF-κB-associated IκBα mutants. A representative gel is shown for each experiment. Quantitation was done on a PhosphorImager, using ImageQuant software, and the resulting histograms display the percentage of the total labeled IκBα in the reaction that was shifted. By graphing the percentage of the total IκBα shifted we were able to correct for any loading differences between samples. Therefore, the histograms give a more accurate representation of the respective levels of ubiquitination on the various IκBα molecules. When examining a pool of both RelA/p65-associated and free IκBα it appears that IκBα containing the mutF mutation is ubiquitinated slightly, but reproducibly, more efficiently than wt IκBα (see Fig.4 A, lanes 1 and 2). The level of ubiquitination of the other IκBα mutants in Fig.4 A is consistent with the rate of degradation and the gel shift results presented in Fig. 2, B and C. The 3236 and M mutants have levels of ubiquitination just above background (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3 and 4). The data with the mutC mutants (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5 and6) represents the levels of ubiquitination on free IκBα molecules, since mutC does not associate with NF-κB (Fig. 3,A and B). MutC alone is ubiquitinated very efficiently (lane 5), even better than wt (Fig. 4 A, lane 5, compared with lane 1, respectively). The mutC3236 mutant shows a reduction in the level of ubiquitination compared with mutC alone, but the level of ubiquitination of 3236mutC is significantly higher than IκBα containing just the 3236 mutation (Fig. 4 A, lane 6, compared with lane 3,respectively). These data demonstrate that free IκBα does undergo signal-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination and that serine 32 and serine 36 play a significant role in this process. Fig. 4 B displays the ubiquitination of the RelA/p65 associated pool of IκBα. The mutF mutation reduces the amount of signal-dependent ubiquitination below the level seen on wt IκBα when it is in association with NF-κB (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and 2). This reduction in ubiquitination by mutF of only NF-κB-associated IκBα explains why IκBα is partially stabilized and why a reduction in the DNA binding activity of NF-κB is observed in the IκBα −/− MEF mutF stable pool (Fig. 2,B and C). In contrast to the NF-κB-bound IκBα (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1and 2), the signal-induced ubiquitination of only the free pool of IκBα reveals that mutF is ubiquitinated slightly more efficiently than the wt (Fig. 4 C, lanes 1 and 2). The 3236 and M mutants give large reductions in the amount of ubiquitination observed (Fig. 4 C, lanes 4 and 5). Ubiquitination of mutC and 3236mutC, in the in vitroubiquitination assay, could only be observed by direct anti-IκBα immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5 and 6) because these mutants do not associate to RelA (Fig. 3 A). The in vitro ubiquitination assay data (Fig. 4,A-C) correlates well with the stability and gel shift observations made in the IκBα −/− MEF stable pools (Fig. 2,B and C). The in vitro ubiquitination results were confirmed by performing in vivo ubiquitination assays in the stably transduced IκBα −/− MEF stable pools. The IκBα −/− MEF stable pools were first treated with β-lactone, a potent and specific inhibitor of the proteasome, and then stimulated with TNFα"

Evidence to date suggests that PECAM-1 is more than just an endothelial cell marker but is intimately involved in signal transduction pathways. This is mediated in part by phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the ITAM domain of PECAM-1 and by recruitment of adapter and signaling molecules. Recently we demonstrated that PECAM-1/β-catenin association functions to regulate β-catenin localization and, moreover, to modulate β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation levels.

PECAM-1 expression is restricted to cells of the vascular system platelets, monocytes, neutrophils, selected T cells, and endothelial cells (1.Newman P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In the latter, PECAM-1 is localized to cell-cell borders of confluent monolayers and, in addition, to lumen-facing areas of blood vessels or tube-like endothelial structures formed in vitro (2.Ilan N. Mahooti P. Rimm D.L. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3005-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PECAM-1 becomes diffusely distributed on the cell surface of sparse cell cultures or at the leading fronts of migrating cells (3.Schimmenti L.A. Yan H.-C. Madri J.A. Albelda S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). PECAM-1 has been shown to be a key player in the adhesion cascade leading to extravasation of leukocytes during inflammation. Pretreatment of monocytes or neutrophils, as well as endothelial cells, with anti-PECAM-1 antibodies effectively inhibited transmigrationin vitro (4.Muller W.A. Weigel S.A. Deng X. Phillips D.M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar) and in vivo (5.Vaporciyan A.A. DeLisser H.M. Yan H. Mendiguren I.I. Thom S.R. Jones M.L. Ward P.A. Albelda S.M. Science. 1993; 262: 1580-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), indicating that PECAM-1 molecules on both the endothelial cells and the leukocytes contribute to the transmigration process. This was further supported by a genetic approach in PECAM-1 knockout mice, in which leukocytes are transiently arrested between the vascular endothelium and the basement membrane of inflammatory sites (6.Duncan G.S. Andrew D.P. Takimoto H. Kaufman S.A. Yoshida H. Spellberg J. de la Pompa J.L. Elia A. Wakeham A. Karan-Tamir B. Muller W.A. Senaldi G. Zukowski M.M. Mak T.W. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3022-3030PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, PECAM-1 knockout mice have been noted to suffer from prolonged bleeding times, which is at least in part due to disrupted endothelial-platelet interactions (53.Mahooti, S., Graesser, D., Patel, S., Newman, P. J., Duncan, G., Mak, T., and Madri, J. A. (2000) Am. J. Pathol., in pressGoogle Scholar), supporting the role of PECAM-1 as mediator of cell adhesion/activation. PECAM-1 has been shown to be more than just a passive player in adhesive interactions and indeed is actively involved in signal transduction pathways. PECAM-1 was demonstrated to undergo phosphorylation on tyrosine residues following mechanical (7.Osawa M. Masuda M. Harada N. Lopes R.B. Fujiwara K. Eur. J.

Specifically, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) domain was recently identified in the cytoplasmic tail of PECAM-1 (11.Lu T.T. Barreuther M. Davis S. Madri J.A. J. Biol.

These include SH-2-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-1 (12.Hua C.T. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Jackson D.E. J. Biol.

Another set of proteins found to associate with PECAM-1 is represented by β-catenin (15.Matsumura T. Wolff K. Petzelbauer P. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3408-3416PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that PECAM-1/β-catenin association is regulated by β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation (2.Ilan N. Mahooti P. Rimm D.L. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3005-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, PECAM-1 overexpression resulted in recruitment of β-catenin into cell-cell junctions and a decrease in β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation levels, suggesting that PECAM-1 plays active roles as a β-catenin modulator (2.Ilan N. Mahooti P. Rimm D.L. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3005-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that not only β- but also γ-catenin associates with PECAM-1. Interestingly, however, serine/threonine, rather than tyrosine, phosphorylation was found to be the major regulatory mechanism responsible for PECAM-1/γ-catenin association. We demonstrate a shift in γ-catenin localization from nuclear to cell-cell junctions upon stable PECAM-1 expression in SW480 colon carcinoma cells and, moreover, suggest that γ-catenin mediates recruitment of PECAM-1 into an insoluble, cytoskeletal fraction. These results confirm and further expand the concept of PECAM-1 being a binder and modulator of catenins. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained from Jordan Pober (Yale Medical School) and were cultured in gelatin-coated flasks as described (2.Ilan N. Mahooti P. Rimm D.L. Madri J.A.

Hemangioendothelioma (EOMA) cells were obtained from Robert Auerbach (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) and were grown in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (17.Obeso J. Weber J. Auerbach R. Lab. Invest. 1990; 63: 259-269PubMed Google Scholar). MCF7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (HTB-22). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml insulin (bovine; Sigma) and transiently transfected as described (2.Ilan N. Mahooti P. Rimm D.L. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3005-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SW480 human colon carcinoma cells stably expressing PECAM-1 cDNA were generated as described (2.Ilan N. Mahooti P. Rimm D.L. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3005-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Embedding and culturing of HUVEC in three-dimensional type-I collagen gels was performed as described (16.Ilan N. Mahooti S. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3621-3631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For cell migration assays, HUVEC were grown to confluency in 100-mm dishes. A 15-well minigel comb was used as a rake in a circular pattern to scrape cells from the dish leaving concentric rings of cells separated by intermittent cell-free regions. Cells were then allowed to migrate for 2 days before analyzed. Harvesting and in vitroculturing of murine conceptuses was performed as described previously (22.Pinter E. Barreuther M. Lu T. Imhof B.A. Madri J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1523-1530PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Pinter E. Mahooti S. Wang Y. Imhof B.A. Madri J.A. Am. J.

Briefly, conceptuses were collected from timed pregnant mice (CD1, Charles River, Wilmington, MA) using a dissecting microscope. Yolk sacs and embryos were separated in day 9.5 p.c. specimens. Groups of 50–60 embryos of day 7.5 p.c. conceptuses and 15 for day 9.5 p.c. conceptuses were analyzed. For glucose treatment, embryos were collected at day 7.5 p.c. and cultured in rat serum and in the absence or presence of 25 mmd-glucose as described (23.Pinter E. Mahooti S. Wang Y.

After 48 h, the yolk sacs were separated, lysed, and used for biochemical studies. Cell cultures were pretreated with 1 mmorthovanadate for 15 min at 37 °C, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm orthovanadate and scraped into lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of proteinase inhibitors; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Soluble and insoluble cell fractions were made according to Simcha et al. (49.Simcha I. Shtutman M. Salomon D. Zhurinsky J. Sadot E. Geiger B. Ben-Ze'ev A. J.

Total cellular protein concentration was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 20 μg of cellular protein were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and protein immunoblotting was performed as described (16.Ilan N. Mahooti S. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3621-3631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, 100 μg of cellular protein were brought to volume of 1.0 ml in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.4 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, preabsorbed with normal rabbit serum followed by protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz) precipitation. The cleared supernatant was incubated with the appropriate antibody for 2 h on ice followed by protein A/G-Sepharose immunoprecipitation. Beads were washed three times with the same buffer supplemented with 5% sucrose and once with the same buffer without sucrose and reduced salt concentration (50 mm NaCl). Sample buffer was then added, and after boiling, samples were subjected to gel electrophoresis and immunodetection as described. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human (BooBoo), and mouse (Sleet) PECAM-1 have been described previously (8.Lu T.T. Yan L.G. Madri J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Polyclonal antibodies to desmoplakin 1 and 2 were purchased from Serotec (Oxford, UK). Anti-phosphotyrosine (PY99), anti-PECAM-1 (C-20), anti-phosphorylated MAPK (E-4), and anti-Erk 2 (C14) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal antibodies to PKC and phospho PKC (pan) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal antibodies to β−catenin and SHP-2 (also known as PTP1D) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Other monoclonal antibodies included anti-vimentin (clone Vim 3B4, Dako), anti-γ-catenin (clone 15F11, Sigma) used for immunoblotting and anti-γ-catenin (clone PG-11E4, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) used for immunostaining. PP1, bisindolylmaleimide GF 109203x, staurosporine, and 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, a diacylglycerol analog (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), were dissolved in Me2SO to a concentration of 5 mm and used at final concentrations of 1, 1, 0.1, and 5 μm, respectively. Matching volumes of Me2SO were added to cell cultures as controls. Wild type or Tyr to Phe mutations at Tyr663, Tyr686, and Tyr701 of the full-length (8.Lu T.T. Yan L.G. Madri J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Invest. 1998; 78: 583-590PubMed Google Scholar)) human PECAM-1 cDNA in the expression vector pcDNA3 were used. For stable expression of PECAM-1, SW480 and 293 cells were transfected with the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and cells were selected with G418 (400 μg/ml) for 4 weeks, expanded, and stained with anti-PECAM-1, β-catenin, and γ-catenin antibodies as described (2.Ilan N. Mahooti P. Rimm D.L. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3005-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μl of PECAM-1/GST fusion protein, comprised of the full cytoplasmic PECAM-1 domain fused to GST as described (11.Lu T.T. Barreuther M. Davis S. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14442-14446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), were incubated with 1.5 units of Src kinase (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) in kinase buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmMnCl2, 10% glycerol, and 30 μm ATP) for 20 min at 30 °C. PECAM-1/GST fusion protein was similarly phosphorylated with purified 1 unit of nPKCε enzyme (Life Technologies, Inc.) with a PKC phosphorylation kit according to the manufacturer's (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) instructions. One-tenth of the reaction was used for immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies or for autoradiography (when using [32P]ATP; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the rest of the reaction products were used for pull-down experiments. PECAM-1/GST fusion protein coupled to glutathione-agarose beads (10 μl) was added to 1 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and incubated on ice for 10 min before the addition of 100 μg of HUVEC lysate. Samples were incubated on ice for additional 30 min, with occasional mixing by inversion, followed by centrifugation. The supernatant was saved, and 20 μl were run in parallel with the bead pellets. The pellet beads were washed twice with binding buffer supplemented with 0.4 m NaCl (final concentration) and once with binding buffer before the addition of sample buffer, boiling, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. HUVEC three-dimensional cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline overnight, dehydrated in a series of 50–100% ethanol, cleared in xylene, and embedded in paraffin. 5-μm sections were cut, mounted onto slides, deparaffinized, rehydrated, and stained. Immunohistochemical analysis of the standard 5-μm sections was done as described (2.Ilan N. Mahooti P. Rimm D.L. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3005-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were subjected to antigen retrieval, blocked with 10% normal donkey serum and double-stained overnight using a goat anti-human PECAM-1 (C-20, Santa Cruz) antibodies and a monoclonal antibody to vimentin. Sections were then extensively washed with TBS-Triton X-100 (0.01%) and subjected to secondary, donkey anti-goat fluorescein isothiocyanate, and donkey anti-mouse CY3-conjugated antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 h, washed, and coverslipped. Cultures of HUVEC or SW480 cells, grown on glass coverslips, were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized for 1 min with 0.5% Triton X-100, and immunofluorescence stained as described (2.Ilan N. Mahooti P. Rimm D.L. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3005-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For migrating cell staining, cells were grown on the coverslip to confluency and scraped in the middle in a cross-like pattern. Cells were allowed to migrate for 2 days before staining. All experiments were repeated at least twice with similar results. The PECAM-1 cytoplasmic domain sequence was examined for consensus PKC substrate sites using the ScanProsite-Protein against PROSITE program (ISREC bioinformatics server, Lausanne, SW). We had recently reported that PECAM-1 functions as a reservoir for and a modulator of tyrosine phosphorylated β-catenin (2.Ilan N. Mahooti P. Rimm D.L. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3005-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the structural and functional similarities between β-catenin and γ-catenin (plakoglobin), we asked whether γ-catenin would similarly associate with PECAM-1 and investigated potential mechanisms that might be involved in the regulation of such an interaction. Previously, we found that PECAM-1/β-catenin interactions correlate with β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation. As illustrated in Fig.1, β-catenin association with PECAM-1 was higher in EOMA cells compared with HUVEC, whereas no association was detected in transfected MCF7 cells (Ref. 2.Ilan N. Mahooti P. Rimm D.L. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3005-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, in the same cell culture model system, PECAM-1/γ-catenin association showed the exact opposite phenotype, being highest in HUVEC (Fig. 1 A). This would suggest that not only β-catenin but also γ-catenin is a PECAM-1 partner and that PECAM-1 interaction with the two catenins is differentially regulated. It has been reported that Arm catenins (p120, β-catenin, and γ-catenin) are a major substrate targets for receptor and Src family kinases (18.Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Bio Essays. 1997; 19: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Therefore, to further study the potential role of γ-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation in its ability to associate with PECAM-1, HUVEC were treated with PP1, a specific inhibitor of Src kinase family members (19.Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation (IP) studies revealed that although γ-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation levels were significantly reduced in PP1- treated HUVEC (Fig. 1 B,top panel), its association with PECAM-1 remain unchanged (Fig. 1 B, third panel). In contrast, β-catenin association with PECAM-1 was completely abolished after PP1 treatment (Fig. 1 B, fourth panel), supporting the concept that β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation is the major factor for its interaction with PECAM-1. Interestingly, low but detectable levels of desmoplakin were co-IP with PECAM-1 independently of γ-catenin phosphotyrosine state, (Fig. 1 B, fifth panel), suggesting that γ-catenin interactions with PECAM-1 may mediate complex interactions with other structural protein families (see below). To further analyze the potential role of PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation for its interaction with γ-catenin, purified GST-PECAM-1 fusion protein was phosphorylated ex vivo with Src enzyme (Ref. 11.Lu T.T. Barreuther M. Davis S. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14442-14446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 C, third panel). Pull-down experiments of HUVEC lysates were than performed with phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated GST-PECAM-1 fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 1 C (top panel), PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation had no effect on γ-catenin recruitment, suggesting that neither γ-catenin (Fig. 1 B) or PECAM-1 (Fig.1 C) tyrosine phosphorylation is necessary for their interaction. Interestingly, although γ-catenin was mainly present in the pellet fraction, β-catenin was unable to interact with PECAM-1 and was mainly detected in the supernatant fraction (Fig.1 C, second panel), suggesting that under these conditions γ-catenin but not β-catenin is the major PECAM-1 partner, and in agreement with our previous IP experiments (Fig.1 A). Although much of the recent interest in PECAM-1 function arose from its tyrosine-based ITAM domain (11.Lu T.T. Barreuther M. Davis S. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14442-14446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), PECAM-1 was initially characterized to be phosphorylated mainly on serine residues (20.Newman P.J. Hillery C.A. Albrecht R. Parise L.V. Berndt M.C. Mazurov A.V. Dunlop L.C. Zhang J. Rittehouse S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, the role of serine/threonine phosphorylation for PECAM-1 function at the cellular or molecular level has not yet been reported. Incubation of our GST-PECAM-1 fusion protein with purified PKC enzyme resulted in significant PECAM-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A,bottom panel), whereas no 32P incorporation was observed with GST alone (data not shown). To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that PKC can directly phosphorylate PECAM-1. Pull-down experiments with the PKC-derived phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated GST-PECAM-1 fusion protein and endothelial cell lysates indicated a significant decrease (more than 6-fold based on densitometric analysis, Fig. 2 B) in the ability of γ-catenin to bind PECAM-1 (Fig.2 A, top panel). In agreement with our previous finding (Fig. 1 C), β-catenin was only detected in the supernatant fractions (Fig. 2 A, second panel), suggesting that PKC exclusively modulates γ-catenin but not β-catenin interactions with PECAM-1. To further evaluate the role of PKC on PECAM-1/β-/γ-catenin interactions in the context of a cell system, we took advantage of the cell culture model presented in Fig. 1 A. High levels of PECAM-1/γ-catenin association in HUVEC may be due to low PKC activity in these cells. Indeed, exposure of HUVEC to a physiologic PKC inducer, diacylglycerol analog, significantly decreased PECAM-1/γ-catenin interactions (Fig. 2 C), more than 3-fold based on densitometric analysis (Fig. 2 D). Staurosporine, a potent PKC inhibitor, did not affect PECAM-1/γ-catenin interactions (Fig.2 C), further supporting the concept that PKC activity in HUVEC is low. In contrast, exposure of EOMA cells to bisindolylmaleimide GF-109203x (bis), a potent and selective PKC inhibitor (21.Toullec D. Pianetti P. Cosre H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulted in a substantial increase in PECAM-1/γ-catenin association (Fig. 2 E, top panel). Interestingly, the increase in γ-catenin binding was accompanied by a comparable decrease in β-catenin association with PECAM-1 (Fig. 2 E, middle panel). This lends further support to our pull-down (Figs. 1 C and2 A) and IP (Fig. 1 A) experiments in which γ-catenin had a higher affinity for PECAM-1. In contrast, the PECAM-1/SHP-2 interaction remained unchanged (Fig. 2 E,third panel), suggesting that although β-catenin and γ-catenin may compete for a common binding site/domain, the SHP-2-binding site is different (tyrosine residues 663/686 in the ITAM domain) and is not influenced by the catenins binding on PECAM-1. Taken together, our in vitro model systems support the concept of an inverse correlation between PECAM-1 serine/threonine phosphorylation and its ability to associate with γ-catenin and, moreover, may indicate that PECAM-1 is an in vivo PKC substrate. Given the ex vivo and in vitro ability of PECAM-1 to bind γ-catenin, we sought an analogous interaction in vivo. Significant increases in extraembryonic and embryonic vasculogenesis, with a concomitant decrease in PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation levels have been characterized between days 7.5 and 9.5 p.c. of the developing murine conceptus (22.Pinter E. Barreuther M. Lu T. Imhof B.A. Madri J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1523-1530PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates, made from the whole conceptus at days 7.5 and 8.5 p.c. or yolk sac lysates from day 9.5 p.c. embryos were IP for PECAM-1, followed by γ-catenin immunoblotting. γ-Catenin was noted to be associated with PECAM-1 at all stages (Fig.3 A, top panel). However, an increase in PECAM-1/γ-catenin association occurred between days 7.5 and 9.5 p.c., a stage during which there is an increase in yolk sac blood island formation and simultaneous formation of embryonic vasculature. Interestingly, immunoblot analysis of the same lysate samples revealed a marked decrease in phospho PKC reactivity (Fig. 3 A, third panel), whereas PKC expression levels were similar (Fig. 3 A, fourth panel). As a control, the same membrane was striped and reprobed with an antibody for the phosphorylated MAPK. No changes in phosphorylated MAPK levels were detected between days 7.5 and 8.5 p.c. (Fig. 3 A, fifth panel), suggesting that the observed decrease in P-PKC reactivity is specific. Densitometric analysis of PECAM-1/γ-catenin co-IP and P-PKC reactivity during these stages of murine conceptuses development are summarized in Fig.3 B. These observations further support the ex vivo/in vitro inverse correlation between PECAM-1 serine/threonine phosphorylation and its ability to bind γ-catenin. We have recently reported that hyperglycemia causes yolk sac and embryonic vasculopathy in cultured murine conceptuses (23.Pinter E. Mahooti S. Wang Y. Imhof B.A. Madri J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1367-1379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Moreover, PECAM-1 was found to be hyper-phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in hyperglycemic day 9.5 p.c. yolk sacs compared with control embryos (23.Pinter E. Mahooti S. Wang Y. Imhof B.A. Madri J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1367-1379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Other reports have documented a glucose-induced PKC activity, and PECAM-1 phosphorylation in cultured endothelial cells (24.Rattan V. Shen Y. Sultana C. Kumar D. Kalra V. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E711-E717PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the potential glucose effect on PECAM-1/γ-catenin interactions, control, or glucose-treated day 9.5 p.c. yolk sac samples were IP for PECAM-1 followed by γ-catenin immunoblotting (Fig.3 C). A two-fold decrease in PECAM-1/γ-catenin association was noted in the glucose-treated samples (Fig. 3 C, top panel). In contrast, a significant increase in PECAM-1/SHP-2 association was detected after glucose exposure (Fig. 3 C,middle panel), in agreement with the glucose-induced increase in PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation levels previously reported (23.Pinter E. Mahooti S. Wang Y. Imhof B.A. Madri J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1367-1379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, glucose treatment induced a 4 fold increase in PKC phosphorylation, as judged by anti-phospho PKC immunoblotting (Fig.3 C, bottom panel), while PKC expression profile was similar (not shown). Thus, our ex vivo, in vitro, and in vivo studies all confirm the ability of γ-catenin to be associated with PECAM-1 and point to PECAM-1 serine/threonine phosphorylation, mediated, at least in part, by PKC as a major regulatory mechanism. Having demonstrated the PECAM-1/γ-catenin interaction biochemically, we were interested in the possible funct"

It is found in all animals, including sponges. It is not expressed in yeast. In mammals, it is expressed in most tissues and plays both a structural as well as a signaling role in the development, maintenance, and repair of tissues and organs. More than 30 gene products compose the collagen family of molecules (1Haralson M.A. Hassell J.R. Haralson M.A. Hassell J.R. Extracellular Matrix: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1995: 1-30Google Scholar). Procollagens have several features and require numerous steps for production of functional molecules, including post-translational modifications (2Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 3111: 376-386Crossref Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Key features in the collagen family are the formation of a triple helix composed of three polypeptide chains and the post-translational modification of proline residues to hydroxyproline, which provides stability of the triple helix against thermal denaturation and unfolding (Tm)1 at the animal's body temperature (3Berg R.A. Prockop D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 52: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The content of proline and hydroxyproline is correlated with the temperature of an animal's environment (4Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 53-104Google Scholar). The triple helical domain of procollagen consists of -(GXY)n- repeats, where X and/orY is frequently proline or hydroxyproline in the mature molecule. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase, an α2β2tetrameric enzyme composed of the prolyl hydroxylase α-subunit (αPH) and the protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) subunit in higher eucaryotes, is the enzyme that modifies proline residues to hydroxyproline. Additional steps for procollagen production include carbohydrate attachment, folding into a triple helix, secretion into the extracellular matrix, and cleavage by specific proteases to remove the propeptide domains to form mature collagen helices. A C-terminal non-helical propeptide facilitates the assembly of trimeric collagen molecules, leading to helix formation (5McLaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); the N-terminal propeptide may limit fiber diameter (6Fleischmajer R. Olsen B.R. Timpl R. Perlish J.S. Lovelance O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3354-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The association and folding steps of three polypeptide chains that compose the triple helix potentially require chaperone functions in the endoplasmic reticulum, with PDI (7Wilson R. Lees J.F. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9637-9643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and Hsp47 (8Nagata K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 22-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) as two proteins that have been implicated in the assembly of a procollagen trimer. A fundamental question regarding collagen biosynthesis is which genes are essential for the expression of collagen in cells and which are nonessential. Expression of recombinant collagen has been performed using mammalian, baculoviral, and transgenic systems. Single procollagen genes were expressed in mammalian cells to produce homotrimeric type I procollagen (9Geddis A.E. Prockop D.J. Matrix. 1993; 13: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), type II procollagen (10Fertala A. Sieron A.L. Ganguly A. Li S.W. Ala-Kokko L. Anumula K.R. Prockop D.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and homotrimeric type V collagen (11Fichard A. Tillet E. Delacoux F. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30083-30087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In baculovirus, prolyl hydroxylase was transfected and shown to be a functional enzyme (12Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Marttila M. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7467-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Subsequently, type I and III procollagens were transfected and expressed and were shown to be capable of modification by prolyl hydroxylase (13Tomita M. Kitajima T. Yoshizato K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Myllyharju H. Lamberg A. Notbohm H. Fietzek P.P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol.

Recently, homotrimeric type I procollagen and an engineered form of α2(I) procollagen have been expressed in the milk of transgenic mice (16Toman P.D. Pieper F. Sakai N. Karatzas C. Platenburg E. de Wit I. Samuel C. Dekker A. Daniels G.A. Berg R.A. Platenburg G. Transgenic Res. 1999; 8: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17John D.C.A. Watson R. Kind A.J. Scott A.R. Kadler K.E. Bulleid N.J. Nature Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast, no report of procollagen expression and assembly has been published using a bacterial expression system. The yeast Pichia pastoris was first engineered to express prolyl hydroxylase and subsequently shown to produce functional type III procollagen if the gene for type III procollagen was introduced (18Vuorela A. Myllyharju J. Nissi R. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6702-6712Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 19Vaughan P.R. Galanis M. Richards K.M. Tebb T.A. Ramshaw J.A.M. Werkmeister J.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Like Saccharomyces, Pichia contains endogenous PDI, but not αPH, and it does not synthesize procollagen. It was therefore a useful system to test the requirements for genes to produce type III procollagen. In this system, the type III procollagen gene and the two genes for prolyl hydroxylase were sufficient to produce stable type III procollagen molecules. However,Saccharomyces is evolutionarily diverse fromPichia. Furthermore, type I procollagen is composed of polypeptides generated from two distinct genes to form an (α1)2α2 structure, whereas type II and III procollagens require only one gene product to form an (α1)3structure. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe a multigene system in Saccharomyces that results in both the assembly and non-native post-translational modification of a multimeric protein to produce a functional heterologous molecule. A total of four gene products were required in Saccharomyces to generate a thermally stable triple helical type I procollagen: two genes that code for the polypeptide chains of type I procollagen and two additional genes that code for the subunits of prolyl hydroxylase. No other added genes were required to produce a functional procollagen. We further optimized our expression system at the molecular level, but also optimized the addition of medium components to significantly increase the level of expression of type I procollagen in Saccharomyces. The precursor plasmid pGET100 and plasmid pGET150, which contains the GAL1/GAL10 dual promoter and is the base plasmid for other constructions, were made as follows. YEp9T, containing yeast (2μ origin, FLP1 gene terminator in 2μ DNA, and the yeast TRP1 gene) and bacterial (pBR322 functions) sequences (20Chen C. Oppermann H. Hitzeman R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8951-8970Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), was modified between an NdeI site in the 2μ DNA and a second NdeI site near the origin of pBR322 with the polylinker sequence (NdeI)-PvuII-ApaI-BglII-ClaI-NheI-XhoI-EcoRI-BamHI-AflII-NotI-(NdeI) to create pGET100 (PvuII site closest to 2μ DNA). Genomic DNA from yeast strain S1799D (MATα trp5 his4 ade6 gal2) was used as the template for PCR with primers (based on sequence information (21Johnston M. Davis R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar)) containing BamHI placed at −6 of the GAL1 promoter side and EcoRI placed at −1 of the GAL10 promoter side. The 687-bpEcoRI/BamHI GAL1/GAL10 product was subcloned into pUC. This fragment was then placed into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pGET100 to make pGET150. The specific structure of circular plasmid pGET150 is as follows: ApR (ampicillin resistance gene)-yeastTRP1-yeast 2μ origin-FLP1terminator-PvuII-polylinker-EcoRI-GAL10promoter/GAL1promoter-BamHI-AflII-NotI-(NdeI)-SapI-Escherichia coli origin of replication-ApR. Both sides of this dual promoter are inducible with galactose and repressible by glucose. Plasmid pGET333, expressing human α1(I) preprocollagen, was constructed by cloning an SspI/XbaI fragment containing the human α1(I) preprocollagen cDNA (22Stacey A. Mulligan R. Jaenisch R. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2549-2554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) coding region between the PvuII and NheI sites in the polylinker of pGET150. To express human α1(I) procollagen using other secretion signals known to work well in yeast, a SalI site was introduced at the pre/pro junction (just upstream of amino acid 23 in preprocollagen), removing the 22-amino acid presequence using PCR. This site was used to fuse two secretion signals to the α1(I) procollagen gene using the artificial SalI site and the EcoRI site adjacent to the GAL promoter in pGET333. Plasmids pGET323 and pGET335 contain the prepro-human serum albumin (HSA) (23Hitzeman R.A. Chen C.Y. Dowbenko D.J. Renz M.E. Liu C. Pai R. Simpson N.J. Kohr W.J. Singh A. Chisholm V. Hamilton R.

The prepro-α-factor signal was isolated using PCR, whereas the prepro-HSA signal was constructed from synthetic oligonucleotides.

The general structure of all other plasmids is as follows: ApR-yeast TRP1-2μ origin-FLP1terminator-PvuII-SspI-α1(I) preprocollagen-XbaI-NheI-XhoI-EcoRI-GAL10promoter/GAL1promoter-BamHI-AflII-α2(I) preprocollagen-3-phosphoglycerate kinase gene terminator-NotI ± PMA1 promoter-yeast invertase secretion signal-PDI gene-ADH1terminator-NotI-(NdeI)-SapI ± 3-phosphoglycerate kinase gene promoter-αPH-GAL10terminator-SapI-E. coli origin of replication-ApR. PMA1 and ADH1 refer to the plasmid membrane ATPase 1 gene and the alcohol dehydrogenase 1 gene, respectively, isolated from yeast. The full-length cDNA for human α2(I) preprocollagen has been described (25Lee S.-T. Smith B.D. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13414-13418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

The αPH gene cDNA was from chicken (28Bassuk J.A. Kao W.W.-Y. Herzer P. Kedersha N.L. Seyer J. DeMartino J.A. Daugherty B.L. Mark III, G.E. Berg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The 3-phosphoglycerate kinase gene promoter (828 bp from the natural ClaI site to the introduced EcoRI site upstream of ATG), PMA1 promoter (the 939-bp fragment from the natural HindIII site to the introducedEcoRI site upstream of ATG), 3-phosphoglycerate kinase gene terminator (the 301-bp BamHI/SmaI fragment to the HindIII/NotI fragment using PCR to addNotI to HindIII and to make sites devoid of the 3-phosphoglycerate kinase structural gene), ADH1 terminator (the natural 330-bp HindIII fragment), and GAL10terminator (the 360-bp BamHI/SphI fragment) elements were originally isolated by PCR based on sequences and references in the Saccharomyces Genome Data Base (Department of Genetics, School of Medicine, Stanford University). Some ends and junctions were created using synthetic oligonucleotides. Plasmid pGET737 contains only human α1(I) and α2(I) preprocollagen genes as described above. The human or chicken PDI and αPH expression units were added to plasmid pGET737 as NotI orSapI fragments, respectively, to create plasmids pGET837 (chicken PDI and human αPH), pGET901 (chicken PDI and αPH), and pGET903 (human PDI and αPH). Strain GY5382 contains integrated chicken αPH and PDI cDNA expression units in the yeastTRP1 locus, resulting in a trp1Δ strain that expresses both of these genes under the control of the GAL10promoter/GAL1 promoter elements. The EcoRI/PstI fragment of the TRP1 gene (30Stinchcomb D.T. Struhl K. Davis R.W. Nature. 1979; 282: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pBluescript II SK+ vector. AnEcoRI/BamHI fragment was then placed into pBR322 with subsequent deletion of the MfeI/BstXI fragment within the TRP1 structural gene and replacement with the polylinker (MfeI)-NotI-BglII-XhoI-(BstXI). The HindIII fragment containing the URA3 yeast gene (31Fasiolo F. Bonnet J. Lacroute F. J. Biol.

A NotI fragment containing the ADH1 terminator-chicken PDI-yeast invertase secretion signal-AflII-GAL10 promoter/GAL1promoter-AflII-chicken αPH-3-phosphoglycerate kinase gene terminator was added to the NotI site in the polylinker. This new plasmid (pGET829) containing the URA3 gene and dual expression units for chicken PDI and αPH within the disruptedTRP1 gene was cut with PmlI (61 bp fromEcoRI in the promoter region) and ApaLI (10 bp in from the PstI site on the other end of the TRP1gene) and therefore has homology to both ends of the TRP1gene. Integration of this linear fragment was performed by a double crossover during yeast transformation. Western assays using antibodies to chicken αPH and PDI (32Berg R.A. Kao K.K. Kedersha N.L. Biochem. J. 1980; 189: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) identified the highest producing transformants. Subsequent analysis of the resulting strain, GY5382, indicated that it contains multiple integrations of the chicken PDI and αPH expression unit at the TRP1 locus. Strain GY5196 has the genotype MAT a leu2Δ1 trp1Δ63 ura3-52 his3Δ200 GAL. Strain GY5382 (genotype MAT a ura3-52 gal1Δ102 trp1::(chicken PDI chicken αPH URA3)) contains repeated copies of chicken αPH and PDI genes integrated into the TRP1 gene. GY5382 was selected from crosses with other strains and screening for higher producing spores. After generating spheroplasts or using lithium treatment (33Becker D.M. Lundblad V. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 13.7.1-13.7.4Google Scholar) with addition of 100 ng of plasmid DNA, yeast transformants were selected on 2% agar plates containing 2% dextrose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base lacking amino acids (Difco and Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and 0.5% casamino acids (and 24 μg/ml uracil for GY5196 transformants) by growing for 3 days at 30 °C. Each strain was grown in base medium consisting of yeast nitrogen base buffered with 1% sodium citrate (pH 6.5) and supplemented with a carbon source (20 g/liter galactose for GY5196 and 10 g/liter glucose and 5 g/liter galactose for GY5382) and 0.5% casamino acids unless otherwise described. Supplementation using arginine (110 mg/liter), glutamate (765 mg/liter), and/or lysine (286 mg/liter) was at concentrations equivalent to the concentrations in casamino acids. Each culture was grown at 20 °C (without αPH and PDI) and 30 °C (with αPH and PDI) unless indicated otherwise and harvested at 60–70 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline plus 5 mm EDTA and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, mixed with an equal volume of acid-washed glass beads, and frozen at −70 °C. The cells were thawed and lysed by vortexing for 6–15 min and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. Collagen yield was determined by a luminometric immunoassay utilizing a goat anti-type I collagen antibody from BIODESIGN International (Kennebunkport, ME) derivatized with either biotin or ruthenium chelate. Samples were analyzed by lysing cells as described above and centrifuging to remove cell debris. The clarified supernatant samples from cell lysis were diluted in matrix buffer (100 mm PIPES (pH 6.8) and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) in duplicate. A 25-μl aliquot was mixed with 50 μl of an antibody solution containing 1 μg/ml ruthenium chelate-conjugated antibody and 1.5 μg/ml biotin-conjugated antibody in diluent (matrix buffer plus 1.5% Tween 20). Samples were incubated for 2 h at ∼20 °C with shaking. A 25-μl aliquot of 1 mg/ml solution of streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (in diluent) was added to each sample, and the samples were shaken for 30 min. A 200-μl aliquot of ORIGEN assay buffer (IGEN Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) was added to each sample and then placed in an ORIGEN analyzer (IGEN Inc.). Total protein was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce) using a microtiter plate format. The equivalent of 20 ml of cells atA 600 = 1.0 were collected, resuspended in 200 μl of buffer, and lysed as described above. SDS sample buffer was added; the samples were incubated at 100 °C for 5 min; and the debris was collected by centrifugation. Clarified supernatants were loaded onto 5 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrophoresed, and stained using either GELCODE blue (Pierce) or silver stain. Protein was transferred from gels onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using Western blotting and probed using an antibody against the N-propeptide region (LF-39, 1:15,000 dilution) or C-propeptide region (LF-41, 1:10,000 dilution) of human α1(I) procollagen (34Fisher L.W. Lindner W. Young M.F. Termine J.F. Connective Tissue Res. 1989; 21: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and a horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary detection antibody (Pierce), followed by development using the ECLTM detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plasmid pGET327 in strain GY5344, an early strain containing the integrated αPH and PDI expression cassette, was grown, and the cells were lysed as described above. Procollagen was precipitated from the clarified supernatant with 4.5m NaCl and resuspended in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Recombinant procollagen C-proteinase/BMP-1 (35Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J.

Science. 1988; 292: 1528-1534Crossref Scopus (3365) Google Scholar) was used to cleave at the C-propeptide junction (36Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The digest was treated with endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) to removeN-linked carbohydrates as described by the manufacturer. The digests were analyzed by Western blotting using the α1(I) procollagen C-propeptide-specific antibody LF-41 (34Fisher L.W. Lindner W. Young M.F. Termine J.F. Connective Tissue Res. 1989; 21: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Pepsin digestions were performed on yeast extracts at pH 2.5 using 640 units/ml pepsin with incubation for 15 min. The samples were neutralized with 1m Tris base. SDS sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled and then loaded onto a 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Type I procollagen purified from yeast cells or from conditioned medium of human skin fibroblasts was treated with a mixture of trypsin (100 μg/ml) and chymotrypsin (250 μg/ml) (37Bruckner P. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The samples were preheated to the desired temperature for 15 min in a thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer Model 480), followed by addition of proteases and further incubation for 2 min. The digestion was stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer, followed by immediate boiling of the samples. Aliquots of the purified protein samples were dried and then subjected to vapor-phase hydrolysis overnight at 116 °C under N2 in vacuo. The hydrolyzed amino acids were derivatized with the AccQ-Tag chemistry kit from Waters and analyzed on an AccQ-Tag column using a Hewlett-Packard Model 1100 high pressure liquid chromatography apparatus. Purified samples were diluted to ∼100 μg/ml using 200 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). Aliquots of 200 μl were analyzed using a Jasco (Easton, MD) Model J-715 CD spectropolarimeter with a Peltier controlled sample holder. The samples were equilibrated for 5 min at each temperature and then scanned from 250 to 185 nm. The results were plotted as the molar ellipticity at a given wavelength as a function of temperature. A first derivative plot of the data was used to determineTm. The initial approach to producing human type I procollagen was to express the α1(I) procollagen polypeptide. The native human α1(I) procollagen signal sequence was tested as well as the prepro-HSA (23Hitzeman R.A. Chen C.Y. Dowbenko D.J. Renz M.E. Liu C. Pai R. Simpson N.J. Kohr W.J. Singh A. Chisholm V.

Yeast cells were transfected with plasmids that contain the α1(I) procollagen gene constructs varying only in their signal sequence (Fig.2 A). The native procollagen signal sequence resulted in the highest level of α1(I) procollagen produced based on the intensity of the bands on the Western blot; the prepro-α-factor and prepro-HSA regions also directed the synthesis of human procollagen, but to a lesser degree. As expression of α1(I) procollagen in the absence of α2(I) procollagen results in homotrimer formation in mammalian cells (9Geddis A.E. Prockop D.J. Matrix. 1993; 13: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), yeast extracts were treated with pepsin to digest susceptible proteins. A light band was detected at the expected size for collagen on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2 B), indicating the presence of a homotrimeric collagen triple helix.Figure 2Characterization of type I procollagen homotrimer. A, Western blot of yeast extracts from strains expressing α1(I) procollagen with different signal sequences. Transfected Saccharomyces cells were grown at 20 °C, and expression of the α1(I) procollagen gene was induced by galactose. Yeast extracts were subjected to electrophoresis and Western blotting using antibody LF-39, which recognizes the N-propeptide of human α1(I) procollagen. Procollagen containing its native signal sequence is pGET327; that containing the prepro-HSA signal is pGET323; and that containing the α-factor signal is pGET335. B, pepsin digestions at different temperatures of yeast extracts expressing α1(I) procollagen (pGET327). Pepsin-digested yeast extracts were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were visualized by silver staining. C, carbohydrate analysis of the homotrimeric type I procollagen C-propeptide region expressed from plasmid pGET327. Endoglycosidase H (EndoH) was used to cleave N-linked oligosaccharide from the C-propeptide of both the human skin fibroblast (HSF)- and yeast-expressed human type I procollagen homotrimers. The digests were reduced and electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by Western blotting.

Bioprocess Technol. 1994; 19: 431-447PubMed Google Scholar), we compared the sizes of N-linked oligosaccharide at the single acceptor site located in the C-propeptide of α1(I) procollagen (40Clark C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10798-10802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-propeptide trimer was removed from procollagen with C-proteinase/BMP-1 (41Kessler E. Adar R. Goldberg B. Niece R. Collagen Relat. Res. 1986; 6: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Following deglycosylation of human skin fibroblast- and yeast-derived human procollagen C-propeptides with endoglycosidase H, identical decreases in molecular mass were seen by Western blotting (Fig. 2 C). This result suggests that similar levels of carbohydrate were added to human procollagen expressed in Saccharomyces and in fibroblast cultures. The same signal sequence substitutions tested for α1(I) procollagen plus the yeast invertase signal were used for expression of the individual gene products α2(I) procollagen, αPH, and PDI. The native signal sequences for α2(I) procollagen and αPH gave the highest expression detected by Western blotting, whereas PDI was more efficiently expressed and secreted into the endoplasmic reticulum with the preinvertase signal sequence than with its native signal sequence. In addition, no difference was measured in the expression levels or retention of PDI in the endoplasmic reticulum by Western blotting when the endoplasmic reticulum retention signal KDEL, present in PDI of higher eucaryotes, was replaced with HDEL, present in yeast PDI (data not shown). The formation of a triple helix of homotrimeric type I procollagen stable at >25 °C would indicate the functionality of the prolyl hydroxylase enzyme. The Tm for non-hydroxylated procollagen is ∼25 °C (3Berg R.A. Prockop D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 52: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). We compared pepsin-digested extracts from Saccharomyces expressing human α1(I) procollagen at 30 °C with and without the genes that code for prolyl hydroxylase. One prominent band was seen on SDS-polyacrylamide gel that comigrated with the expected size of α1(I) procollagen in extracts from cells containing the αPH and P"
https://openalex.org/W1978548933,"Human SIX1 (HSIX1) is a member of the Six class of homeodomain proteins implicated in muscle, eye, head, and brain development. To further understand the role of HSIX1 in the cell cycle and cancer, we developed an HSIX1-specific antibody to study protein expression at various stages of the cell cycle. Our previous work demonstrated that HSIX1 mRNA expression increases as cells exit S phase and that overexpression of HSIX1 can attenuate a DNA damage-induced G2 cell cycle checkpoint. Overexpression of HSIX1 mRNA was observed in 44% of primary breast cancers and 90% of metastatic lesions. Now we demonstrate that HSIX1 is a nuclear phosphoprotein that becomes hyperphosphorylated at mitosis in both MCF7 cells and in Xenopus extracts. The pattern of phosphorylation observed in mitosis is similar to that seen by treating recombinant HSIX1 with casein kinase II (CK2) in vitro. Apigenin, a selective CK2 inhibitor, diminishes interphase and mitotic phosphorylation of HSIX1. Treatment of MCF7 cells with apigenin leads to a dose-dependent arrest at the G2/M boundary, implicating CK2, like HSIX1, in the G2/M transition. HSIX1 hyperphosphorylated in vitro by CK2 loses its ability to bind the MEF3 sites of the aldolase A promoter (pM), and decreased binding to pM is observed during mitosis. Because CK2 and HSIX1 have both been implicated in cancer and in cell cycle control, we propose that HSIX1, whose activity is regulated by CK2, is a relevant target of CK2 in G2/M checkpoint control and that both molecules participate in the same pathway whose dysregulation leads to cancer.

HSIX11 belongs to the Six class of homeodomain containing proteins, which share a lysine in position 50 of the recognition helix of the homeodomain (1.Oliver G. Wehr R. Jenkins N.A. Copeland B.G. Cheyette B.N.R. Hartenstein V. Zipursky S.L. Gruss P. Development. 1995; 121: 693-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins can be further subdivided into three distinct families that presumably originated from three different ancestral Six genes (2.Seo H.-C. Curtiss J. Mlodzik M. Fjose A. Mech. Dev. 1999; 83: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In mammals two gene members have been identified for each family, thus accounting for the six known members of this class. To date, 12 Six gene homologues have been identified in lower vertebrates (2.Seo H.-C. Curtiss J. Mlodzik M. Fjose A. Mech. Dev. 1999; 83: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Of the Six proteins discovered to date, several function in the development of the forebrain, eye, and muscle (2.Seo H.-C. Curtiss J. Mlodzik M. Fjose A. Mech. Dev. 1999; 83: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 3.Heanue T.A. Reshef R. Davis R.J. Mardon G. Oliver G. Tomarev S. Lassar A.B. Tabin C.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3231-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We previously cloned HSIX1 from late S phase 21PT mammary carcinoma cells, and demonstrated that its overexpression in MCF7 cells attenuated a DNA damage-induced G2 cell cycle checkpoint. HSIX1 overexpression was observed in 44% of primary breast cancers, and 90% of metastatic lesions examined. This suggested that HSIX1 has a role in tumor progression, possibly through its cell cycle checkpoint function (4.Ford H.L. Kabingu E.K. Bump E.A. Mutter G.L. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12608-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Recently, it was speculated that the c-metgene is a potential target of Six1 (5.Relaix F. Buckingham M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3171-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Additional targets that may explain the role of Six1 in the cell cycle and/or tumor progression are not known. However, myogenin was identified as a target of HSIX1 in muscle development (6.Spitz F. Demignon J. Porteu A. Kahn A. Concordet J.-P. Daegelen D. Maire P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14220-14225Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In general, very little is known about the targets of homeodomain proteins. Although most homeodomain containing proteins bind to similar short consensus DNA sequences in vitro, they have highly specific functions in vivo. Therefore, target specificityin vivo is achieved by other elements such as interaction with cofactors, translational regulation, subcellular localization, or protein phosphorylation (7.Kasahara H. Izumo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 526-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Protein phosphorylation regulates a number of homeodomain-containing transcription factors including Csx/Nkx2.5, Cut, Pit-1, Oct-1, andDrosophila Engrailed and Antennapedia by affecting protein-protein interactions, DNA binding, or nuclear localization (7.Kasahara H. Izumo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 526-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In some instances, phosphorylation is cell cycle-dependent (8.Stukenberg P.T. Lustig K.D. McGarry T.J.

Mitotic phosphorylation of both the POU transcription factor GHF-1 and the Oct-1 homeodomain containing protein inhibits their DNA binding activity (9.Caelles C. Hennemann H. Karin M. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1991; 254: 1814-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and may represent a general mechanism for decreasing transcription during mitosis. Several kinases are known to phosphorylate homeodomain-containing proteins, including protein kinase casein kinase II (CK2), protein kinase C (PKC), and protein kinase A. In particular, protein kinase CK2, a serine/threonine kinase that is ubiquitously expressed, has been shown to phosphorylate transcription factors including those encoded by Csx/Nkx2.5 (7.Kasahara H. Izumo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 526-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), Cut (11.Coqueret O. Martin N. Berube G. Rabbat M. Litchfield D. Nepvue A. J. Biol.

The phosphorylation of the DrosophilaAntennapedia protein by CK2 was shown to be important for its role in thoracic and abdominal development (15.Jaffe L. Ryoo H.-D. Mann R.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To understand the regulation of the HSIX1 protein, we developed an HSIX1-specific antibody and examined protein levels and phosphorylation at various stages of the cell cycle. We find that HSIX1 is a phosphoprotein in both interphase and mitotic cells and that protein kinase CK2 is at least partly responsible for the phosphorylation of HSIX1 in both interphase and mitosis. In mitosis, the HSIX1 protein becomes hyperphosphorylated, and a concomitant loss in DNA binding activity is seen. The phosphorylation of HSIX1 by CK2 has implications for both cell cycle control and tumorigenesis. The GST C-terminal HSIX1 construct utilized for antibody production was generated by PCR amplification of the C terminus of HSIX1 (beginning from nucleotide 822, just after the homeodomain and terminating at the STOP codon) from the full-length SKMFL plasmid (wild type HSIX1 cloned into the BamHI/XbaI site of the Invitrogen pcDNA3.1/His plasmid) utilizing standard PCR conditions and a 5′ primer containing a XhoI restriction site (ACT CTC GAG GAG GCC AAG GAA AGG GAG AAC) and 3′ primer containing anXbaI restriction site (TGC TCT AGA CAC TTA GGA CCC CAA GTC CAC-pSixXba I). The C terminus was then subcloned into an Invitrogen TA cloning vector pCR2.1 according to the manufacturers recommendations, resulting in the pCR2.1Cterm plasmid. Partial digests (16.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.24-9.25Google Scholar) were performed on the pCR2.1Cterm plasmid with EcoRI to release the full-length C-terminal fragment of HSIX1. The C terminus of HSIX1 was then subcloned into the EcoRI sites of pGEX2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the resulting construct was sequenced to ensure the proper orientation and to ensure that no mutations were introduced. Deletion constructs were generated as follows. The N terminus of HSIX1 (from the start codon to nucleotide 689, which is in the first helix of the encoded homeodomain) was amplified as the C terminus (above), using a 5′ primer containing aBamHI site (CTG GGA TCC ATG TCG ATG CTG CCG TCG TTT- pSixBHI) and a 3′ primer containing a XhoI site (ATC CTC GAG GAC ACC CCT CGA CTT CTC CTT). The resulting N-terminal fragment was then subcloned into the TA cloning vector pCR2.1 as above (pCR2.1Nterm). The N-terminal and C-terminal portions of HSIX1 were then removed from pCR2.1 by digesting withBamHI/XhoI and XhoI/XbaI, respectively, and were subsequently ligated into the BamHI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) to generate the ΔHD plasmid. Sequencing was performed to ensure that the two portions of HSIX1 were fused in frame and that the homeodomain was lacking. The homeobox and C-terminal portions (for ΔNterm) of HSIX1 were amplified using standard PCR conditions from the SIXFL plasmid (4.Ford H.L. Kabingu E.K. Bump E.A. Mutter G.L. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12608-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) with a 5′ primer containing aBamHI site (CTG GGA TCC ATG AAA TTT CCA CTG CCG CGC ACC) and the pSixXbaI 3′ primer. The N-terminal and homeobox regions (for ΔCterm) were amplified as above using the pSixBHI 5′ primer and a 3′ primer containing a STOP codon as well as an XbaI site (TGC TCT AGA CTA GTT CTC CCT TTC CTT GGC CTC). The PCR products were then digested with BamHI and XbaI and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid. Sequencing of both constructs was performed to ensure that no mutations were introduced. The GST C-terminal HSIX1 fusion protein was induced and purified on glutathione beads as described previously (17.Ford H.L. Zain S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1597-1605PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion protein was released into the supernatant by adding 50 mm Tris, pH 8, containing 10 mm reduced glutathione and incubating at 4 °C for 10 min. Bradford assays were performed to determine the protein concentration after which the protein was electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was lightly stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and GST C-terminal HSIX1 was excised from the gel according to Harlow and Lane (18.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 63Google Scholar). Approximately 500 μg of protein was sent to Spring Valley (Woodbine, MD) for antibody production in rabbits. Successive bleeds of GST C-terminal HSIX1 antibody were tested on lysates from MCF7 cells transfected with the SIXFLexpression construct (MCF7/SIXFL). When HSIX1-specific antibody was observed in plasma, the antibody was affinity purified, first over a GST column (to remove all antibodies recognizing the GST portion of the fusion protein) and then over a GST C-terminal HSIX1 column. The columns were made using the AminoLink Plus Immobilization Kit from Pierce. The affinity purified antibody was then tested and titered on MCF/SIXFL lysates. MCF7 mammary carcinoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in 6.5% CO2. 21PT cells were maintained as described (4.Ford H.L. Kabingu E.K. Bump E.A. Mutter G.L. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12608-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). For transfections, subconfluent 100-mm plates of MCF7 cells were split 1:4 into 100-mm plates. The following day, the 100-mm plate of cells was transfected with 10 μg of SIXFL or pcDNA3.1(+) (mock transfected control) using Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Transfected cells were lysed 24–48 h post-transfection in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% nadeoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 200 μmNa3VO4) for 20 min. at 4 °C. Lysates were passed through a 25-gauge needle 5–6 times to shear the DNA and then microcentrifuged at 4 °C, 14,000 rpm for 15 min. Supernatants were treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase according to Kasahara and Izumo (7.Kasahara H. Izumo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 526-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and Western blots were performed as described (18.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 63Google Scholar) using a 1:1000 dilution of anti-HSIX1 as the primary antibody and a 1:10000 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) as a secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was utilized to detect the HSIX1 signal. MCF7 cells were plated in 6-well dishes on coverslips at 2.5 × 105 cells/well. 24 h later, cells were transfected with SIXFL using Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 24–48 h post-transfection, cells were fixed in 0.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. followed by 5–10 min in 0.5% Triton X-100. After several washes in PBS, cells were incubated in a 1:1000 dilution of anti-HSIX1 for 1 h at room temperature followed by several washes in PBS. The cells were then incubated in a 1:100 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) for 45 min at room temperature. After five washes in PBS, the cells were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) containing 0.1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to counterstain the nuclei. Xenopus interphase and mitotic extracts were prepared as described by Stukenberg et al. (8.Stukenberg P.T. Lustig K.D. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 338-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled HSIX1 and the deleted proteins were in vitro translated (IVT) from the SIXFL, ΔHD, ΔNterm, and ΔCterm constructs using the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system from Promega (Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Proteins were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in interphase or mitotic extracts (1 μl of IVT reaction plus 5 μl extract) and examined for phosphatase sensitive alterations in mobility according to Stukenberg et al. (8.Stukenberg P.T. Lustig K.D. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 338-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). 1 μl of this reaction was resolved on a 10% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. [35S]Methionine-labeled HSIX1 was incubated with various kinases as follows: CK2 for 30 min at 30 °C with 50 units of human recombinant casein kinase II (Calbiochem) in 20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.25 mm ATP; cyclin B/cdc2 for 20 min at 30 °C with 2 μl of purified Xenopus cyclin B-cdc2 (19.Wilhelm H. Andersen S.L. Karsenti E. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 12-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol; PKC for 15 min at 30 °C with 20 ng of the catalytic subunit of rat brain protein kinase C (Calbiochem) in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 140 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm ATP. Before use in EMSAs, salt concentrations were adjusted to give appropriate final molarities. Cells were transfected with SIXFL as described above. MCF7/SIXFL cells were incubated with various inhibitors at indicated concentrations in medium for 3–5 h at 37 °C, after which lysates were isolated as above. Densitometric scanning of Western blots developed with the HSIX1 antibody allowed determination of the percentage of HSIX1 phosphorylated in interphase in the presence of the various inhibitors. For assessment of kinases important for mitotic phosphorylation, mitotic Xenopus assays containing [35S]methionine-labeled HSIX1 were carried out as above by adding the indicated inhibitors at the time of HSIX1 addition. Densitometric scanning was utilized to determine the percentage of HSIX1 that was hyperphosphorylated in the presence of various inhibitors. The inhibitors utilized were: apigenin (Sigma), a selective CK2 inhibitor; roscovitine (Calbiochem), a cdc2 kinase inhibitor; bisindolylmaleimide I (Calbiochem), a PKC inhibitor; and PD98059 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEKI) and MAPK cascade inhibitor. For kinase assays, 5 μg of protein extracted from MCF7 cells was incubated with or without 1 mm of the specific protein kinase CK2 peptide RRREEETEEE (Sigma-Genosys, The Woodlands, TX) in buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, and 100 μmNa3VO4) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP at 30 °C for 10 min (20.Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The kinase reaction was terminated by addition of 25 μl of 100 mmATP in 0.4 n HCl. Samples were spotted onto a P81 Whatman filter and washed four times for 5 min each with 150 mmH3PO4 to elute unincorporated counts. Incorporated counts were quantified in an automatic scintillation counter. Samples were assayed in triplicate. Kinase activity was calculated as the subtraction of the mean of samples without peptide from the mean of samples with peptide. MCF7 cells were cultured as described above. When cells reached 50–70% confluence, 20–80 μm apigenin (Sigma) or Me2SO alone was administered for 18 h. Cells were then resuspended in Nicoletti buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium citrate) containing 0.5 mg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), and the DNA content was analyzed on a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) using the Cellquest software program. These assays were performed as described in Spitz et al. (6.Spitz F. Demignon J. Porteu A. Kahn A. Concordet J.-P. Daegelen D. Maire P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14220-14225Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) using the aldolase A MEF3 site sequence (tgaatgtcaggggct t caggtttcccta). The buffer utilized for protein-DNA binding contained 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 34 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Unlabeled wild type and mutant oligonucleotides (bold nucleotide changed fromt to g above) were used as competitors at 50 times the radiolabeled oligonucleotide concentration. To study HSIX1 function, we generated an HSIX1-specific antibody by injecting a GST C-terminal HSIX1 fusion protein into rabbits. After affinity purifying the antibody, it was tested on lysates from MCF7 cells transiently transfected with HSIX1 (MCF7/SIXFL) and on lysates from control transfected MCF7 cells that had previously been shown to contain almost no endogenous HSIX1 mRNA. Western blot analysis identified three bands of molecular masses between 37 and 42 kDa in HSIX1 transfected MCF7 cells but not in controls, demonstrating the specificity of our antibody (Fig.1 A) and suggesting that the protein is post-translationally modified or processed. Immunocytochemistry with the HSIX1 antibody demonstrated that transfected HSIX1 is a nuclear protein (Fig. 1 B). A data-base search of the HSIX1 amino acid sequence revealed 11 potential phosphorylation sites in the protein (Fig.2), particularly in the C terminus. To address whether HSIX1 is a phosphoprotein, lysates obtained from asynchronous MCF7/SIXFL cells were treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP), which demonstrated the existence of a phosphatase sensitive form of HSIX1 (Fig.3 A). Dephosphorylation was blocked in the presence of excess phosphate. To determine whether endogenous HSIX1 also exists as a phosphoprotein, we prepared nuclear extracts from asynchronous 21PT breast cancer cells, previously shown to contain HSIX1 mRNA, and performed the CIAP reaction as described for MCF7/SIXFL cells. Fig. 3 B demonstrates that endogenous HSIX1 also exists as a phosphoprotein in an asynchronous population of 21PT cells.Figure 3HSIX1 exists as a phosphoprotein in asynchronous cells. A, Western blot analysis with HSIX1 antibody on lysates from MCF7/SIXFL cells (left lane), MCF7/SIXFL cells treated with CIAP (middle lane), and MCF7/SIXFL cells treated with both CIAP and Na2HPO4 to compete the phosphatase reaction (right lane). B, experiment carried out as inA with nuclear extracts from 21PT cells, which express HSIX1 endogenously.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The cdc2 kinase, which has catalytic specificity for a proline C-terminal to the site it phosphorylates, is only active in mitosis when it is partnered with its regulatory subunit, cyclin B, and is activated by various phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events (21.Jackman M.R. Pines J.N. Cancer Surveys. 1997; 29: 47-73PubMed Google Scholar). The HSIX1 sequence has several putative cdc2 phosphorylation sites (Fig. 2). This, in addition to previous findings that several homeodomain containing proteins are hyperphosphorylated in mitosis (8.Stukenberg P.T. Lustig K.D. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 338-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 9.Caelles C. Hennemann H. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6694-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10.Segil N. Roberts S.B. Heintz N. Science. 1991; 254: 1814-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), prompted us to examine the phosphorylation state of HSIX1 in interphaseversus mitosis. Western blot analysis on lysates from MCF7/SIXFL cells synchronized in mitosis by addition of nocodazole, as well as on lysates from mitotis-enriched MCF7/SIXFL cells that were sorted by flow cytometry, demonstrated the existence of a hyperphosphorylated form of HSIX1 (data not shown). Because biochemical analysis of this form of the protein was difficult in mammalian culture cells, where drug treatments must be used to obtain large numbers of mitotic cells, we chose the synchronousXenopus laevis system to carry out these studies. In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled HSIX1 was incubated with interphase and mitotic extracts from X. laevis and examined for phosphatase-sensitive alterations in mobility. In interphase, an HSIX1 triplet was observed, as seen in asynchronous MCF7 cells, where greater than 75–90% are generally in interphase (data not shown). HSIX1 incubated in mitotic extracts exhibited a higher molecular mass form of HSIX1, which could be eliminated by treatment with CIAP, indicating hyperphosphorylation of HSIX1 in mitosis (Fig.4 A). To determine the region of HSIX1 that is hyperphosphorylated in mitosis, deletion constructs were generated (Fig. 4 B). Proteins with deleted regions were translated in the presence of [35S]methionine and incubated in interphase and mitotic extracts. Those lacking the homeodomain (ΔHD) or the N terminus (ΔNterm) exhibited a shift to a slower mobility when incubated in mitotic extracts. However, the C-terminal deleted protein (ΔCterm) was not shifted (Fig. 4 C). This suggests that the majority of the mitotic-specific phosphorylation occurs in the C terminus, in accordance with the multiple phosphorylation sites observed in this region of the protein. Data base searching revealed that HSIX1 contains potential consensus phosphorylation sites for protein kinase CK2, PKC, and cyclin B/cdc2. We set out to determine which of these kinases are responsible for HSIX1 phosphorylation. [35S]Methionine-labeledin vitro translated HSIX1 was incubated with each of these three putative HSIX1 kinases (Fig.5 A). PKC, cyclin B/cdc2, and CK2 all can phosphorylate HSIX1 in vitro, and a greater extent of hyperphosphorylation is observed when the protein is incubated with cyclin B/cdc2 or CK2 than with PKC. Phosphorylation of HSIX1 by CK2 in vitro most closely resembled the hyperphosphorylation of the protein observed in mitotic extracts (Fig.5 A), although none of the kinases gave in vitrophosphorylation patterns of HSIX1 that were identical to those seen in interphase or mitotic extracts. To determine which kinases were responsible for phosphorylating HSIX1in vivo, MCF7/SIXFL cells were treated with inhibitors to each of these kinases. Apigenin, a selective CK2 inhibitor, diminished the phosphorylation of HSIX1 (Fig. 5 B). This inhibition of HSIX1 phosphorylation was paralleled by partial inhibition of CK2 activity (Fig. 5 C). Neither roscovitine, a cyclin B/cdc2 inhibitor, nor bisindolylmaleimide, a PKC inhibitor, significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of HSIX1 in asynchronous, primarily interphase cells (Fig. 5 B). [35S]Methionine-labeled HSIX1 was incubated in Xenopus mitotic extracts in the absence or presence of various kinase inhibitors. 100 μm apigenin reduced CK2 activity in the extract by approximately 40% (data not shown) and decreased the ratio of the higher molecular mass (hyperphosphorylated) form of HSIX1 to the total amount of protein by an average of 27%, a statistically significant difference as assessed by a Student'st test. However, treatment with either 100 μmroscovitine, a concentration known to inhibit MPF (cyclin B/cdc2) activity in Xenopus extracts, or 1 μmbisindolylmaleimide, which specifically inhibits PKC activity, did not significantly alter the extent of HSIX1 hyperphosphorylation (Fig.5 D). This suggests that CK2 is, at least in part, also responsible for the mitotic-specific hyperphosphorylation of HSIX1. Our previous work as well as that of others has implicated both HSIX1 and CK2 in the DNA damage-induced G2cell cycle checkpoint and in tumorigenesis. Discovery of HSIX1 as a target of CK2 in both mammalian and Xenopus systems implies that the two proteins may cooperate in cell cycle control and tumorigenicity. Because we have already demonstrated that overexpression of HSIX1 in MCF7 cells affects the transition of cells through G2, we set out to determine the effect of CK2 on the cell cycle. MCF 7 cells treated with apigenin were arrested at the G2/M boundary in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.6), suggesting that CK2 activity is important in the G2/M transition of mammary carcinoma cells. To determine whether hyperphosphorylation of HSIX1 by CK2 affects its DNA binding activity, we performed EMSA (Fig.7 A) using the MEF3 sites of the aldolase A promoter (pM), which were previously demonstrated to bind the mouse Six1 protein (6.Spitz F. Demignon J. Porteu A. Kahn A. Concordet J.-P. Daegelen D. Maire P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14220-14225Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). IVT HSIX1 formed three complexes when incubated with the pM oligonucleotide, which were all competed by cold wild type pM. Only the fastest migrating complex was not competed with cold mutant pM, su"

The purified pump demonstrates both Ca2+- and Mn2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis and phosphoenzyme intermediate formation in forward (ATP) and reverse (Pi) directions. This preparation has allowed us to examine, in detail, the properties of mutations D778A and Q783A in transmembrane segment M6 of Pmr1. In phenotypic screens of Ca2+ chelator and Mn2+ toxicity reported separately (Wei, Y., Chen, J., Rosas, G., Tompkins, D.A., Holt, P.A., and Rao, R. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, XXXX–XXXX), D778A was a loss-of-function mutant apparently defective for transport of both Ca2+ and Mn2+, whereas mutant Q783A displayed a differential sensitivity consistent with the selective loss of Mn2+transport. We show that mutant D778A is devoid of cation-dependent ATP hydrolytic activity and phosphoenzyme formation from ATP. However, reverse phosphorylation from Pi is preserved but is insensitive to inhibition by Ca2+ or Mn2+ ions, which is evidence for a specific inability to bind cations in this mutant. We also show that Ca2+ can activate ATP hydrolysis in the purified Q783A mutant, with a half-maximal concentration of 0.06 μm, essentially identical to that of wild type (0.07 μm). Mn2+ activation of ATP hydrolysis was half-maximal at 0.02 μm in wild type, establishing a normal selectivity profile of Mn2+ > Ca2+. Strikingly, Mn2+-ATPase in the Q783A mutant was nearly abolished, even at concentrations of up to 10 μm. These results were confirmed in assays of phosphoenzyme intermediates. Molecular modeling of the packing between helices M4 and M6 suggests that residue Gln783 in M6 may form a critical hydrophobic interaction with Val335 in M4, such that the Ala substitution modifies the packing or tilt of the helices and thus the ion pore. The data emphasize the critical role of transmembrane segment M6 in defining the cation binding pocket of P-type ATPases. We have solubilized and purified the histidine-tagged yeast secretory pathway/Golgi ion pump Pmr1 to near homogeneity in one step, using nickel affinity chromatography.

Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The ionic radius and coordination chemistry of Mn2+ is closer to that of Ca2+than other physiological cations, and both Ca2+ and Mn2+ bind to oxygen- and nitrogen-based ligands on proteins (3Osterberg R. Siegel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems: High Molecular Complexes. 3. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1974: 45-88Google Scholar, 4Lawrence G.D. Sawyer D.T. Coordination Chem.

Manganese in Metabolism and Enzyme Function. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1986: 313-323Crossref Google Scholar). Support for speculation that Mn2+ and Ca2+ can function interchangeably in signal transduction comes from observations that Mn2+ can replace Ca2+ in a number of well established signaling systems, including calmodulin activation (7Kawasaki H. Kuroso Y. Kasai H. Isobe T. Okuyama T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), cyclic nucleotide metabolism (8Keller C.H. LaPorte D.C. Toscano Jr., W.A. Storm D.R. Westcott K.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1980; 356: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and secretion (9Wilson S.P. Kirshner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4994-5000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, free Mn2+ was shown to be 500–1000-fold more effective than free Ca2+ in supporting bud development and cell cycle progression (1Loukin S. Kung C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Manganese is believed to be abundantly available in the natural habitat of yeast, at an estimated concentration of 100 μm in rotting vegetation (6Reed G.H. Schramm V.L. Wedler F.C. Manganese in Metabolism and Enzyme Function. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1986: 313-323Crossref Google Scholar, 10Loneragan J.F. Graham R.D. Hannam R.J. Uren N.C. Manganese in Soil and Plants. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1988: 113-124Google Scholar), and may well play a physiologically relevant role in mediating cell growth. Thus, the mobilization and transport of Mn2+are likely to emulate that of Ca2+ (11Luckhoff A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1992; 335: 356-358Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The yeast ion pump Pmr1, which localizes to the medial Golgi, has been implicated in the delivery of both Ca2+ and Mn2+ to the secretory pathway (2Durr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 12Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where they have distinct roles in sustaining protein sorting (Ca2+) or protein glycosylation (Mn2+). Cytosolic Mn2+accumulates in pmr1 mutants and can serve as an inorganic scavenger of superoxide radicals, thus bypassing the requirement for cytosolic superoxide dismutase in aerobic growth (12Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently,pmr1 mutants also display hypersensitivity to the growth toxicity of millimolar concentrations of extracellular Mn2+, indicating that delivery into the secretory pathway by Pmr1, and subsequent exocytosis, must be a major route for cellular detoxification of Mn2+. In earlier work, we have demonstrated that Mn2+ is a potent inhibitor of Pmr1-mediated 45Ca2+ transport in isolated Golgi vesicles, consistent with competition for transport sites (13Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the accompanying work (14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt P.A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we have taken advantage of the hypersensitivity of the pmr1 null strain to BAPTA1 and Mn2+toxicity and screened for mutants defective in cation transport and selectivity (14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt P.A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The identification of the mutation Q783A in transmembrane segment M6 of Pmr1, which conferred hypersensitivity to Mn2+ toxicity but retained normal 45Ca transport characteristics, provided a preliminary insight into the molecular basis of ion selectivity in transport ATPases (14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt P.A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Several loss-of-function mutants, resembling the null strain in both BAPTA and Mn2+ hypersensitivity, were also identified. One such mutant, D778A, again in M6, retained normal biogenesis and ATP binding ability but had no detectable transport activity (14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt P.A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This residue is conserved in all Pmr1 homologues sequenced to date and likely contributes directly to cation binding, analogous to the proposed role of the equivalent aspartate in SERCA and the Na+/K+-ATPase (15Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 16Kuntzweiler T.A. Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B J. Biol.

Here, we describe the solubilization and purification of His-tagged Pmr1, by nickel affinity chromatography. The purified preparations were used to assay cation-dependent ATP hydrolysis and phosphoenzyme formation in wild type and mutants D778A and Q783A. The data support a critical role for Asp778 in the cation-binding pocket and demonstrate a striking reversal in ion selectivity for the Q783A mutant. The phenotype of additional substitutions at residue 783 have led us to hypothesize a role for this residue in M4-M6 helix packing, which is supported by molecular modeling simulation. Cultures were grown in defined minimal media containing yeast nitrogen base (6.7 g/liter; Difco), dextrose (2%), and supplements as needed. Growth assays in BAPTA- and Mn2+-supplemented medium were done exactly as described (14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt P.A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Yeast strain K616 (Δpmr1Δpmc1Δcnb1) was used as host and has been described before (17Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Plasmid YCpHR1 is a centromeric yeast plasmid carrying the PMR1 gene under heat shock control (14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt P.A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mutations Q783A and D778A were made earlier (14Wei Y.

Pei G.K. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing and introduced into plasmid YCpHR1 by standard cloning techniques. Plasmid YEpHisPMR1 is a 2μ plasmid expressing the N-terminal His9-tagged Pmr1 behind the constitutive PGK promoter and has been described earlier (13Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R.

Briefly, it was constructed by replacing the initiator ATG codon in PMR1 with a unique MluI site and cloning into the expression vector pSM1052 (gift of Susan Michaelis, Johns Hopkins University). This construct results in a 15-residue N-terminal extension of Pmr1 having the sequence RGSQHHHHHHHHHTR following the initiating Met. Mutations Q783A and D778A were introduced into YEpHisPMR1 by cloning a 3-kilobase pair BamHI fragment containing the mutation from the YEpHR1 construct (14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt P.A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and verifying correct orientation by restriction analysis. Isolation of Golgi membranes by sucrose density gradient centrifugation of clarified yeast lysates was exactly as described earlier (19Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). A crude detergent extract was prepared by suspending 1 mg of Golgi membranes in 1 ml of solubilization buffer Scontaining 20 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.0, 20% glycerol, 0.5% Escherichia coli total lipid extract, 1.5%n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 6 mmβ mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors (20Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2129-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The resulting suspension was mixed for 2 h on a rotary motor at 4 °C. The mixture was cleared of unextractable materials by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Meanwhile, 0.1 ml of bed volume of Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) was placed in a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube and washed twice with 0.5 ml of cold water and washed twice with 1 ml of buffer S plus 10 mm imidazole. The detergent extract was added to the equilibrated resin and incubated at 4 °C for 2.5 h with gentle shaking. The mixture was then transferred to a 2-ml Micro Bio-Spin column (Bio-Rad), and unbound material was collected by gravity elution. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of Wash Buffer (Buffer S plus 200 mm NaCl and 50 mmimidazole) to release nonspecifically bound material. His9-Pmr1 was eluted following incubation with 0.2–0.3 ml of elution buffer (Buffer S plus 300 mmimidazole) for 5 min. The eluted material was collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 30 s in a refrigerated microcentrifuge, immediately frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath, and stored at −80 °C until further use. The method of Ghosh et al. (21Ghosh J. Ray M. Sarkar S. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11345-11351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was followed, with some modifications. Here, the assay mixture was reduced to 0.1 ml and contained 50 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgCl2. Cations (Ca2+ and Mn2+) were added as the chloride salts and buffered with EGTA as specified in the figure legends; free cation concentration was determined by the WinMaxChelator computer program (22Bers D. Patton C. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Ni-NTA eluted Pmr1 (1 μg) was preincubated in the reaction mixture at room temperature, and ATP hydrolysis was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to a final concentration of 50 μm (500–600 cpm/pmol). After the desired incubation period, the reaction was terminated with 10 μl of 25% trichloroacetic acid, followed by the addition of 10 μl of 100 mm KH2PO4. Then 0.1 ml of a suspension of activated charcoal (1:1 in water; Sigma) was added. After mild stirring for 10 min, the charcoal was precipitated by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge. The process was repeated once, and finally an aliquot from the supernatant was transferred to 10 ml of scintilation mixture (Ecolume; ICN), and the radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Formation of the aspartyl-phosphate reaction intermediate was assayed as described (23Liang F. Cunningham K.W. Harper J.F. Sze H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8579-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), with some modifications. The 0.2-ml reaction mixture contained 25 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, and 1 μg of purified Pmr1. To test cation dependence, EGTA was added to a final concentration of 1 mm such that the free Ca2+concentration was less than 1 nm. Then 1 mmCaCl2 or MnCl2 was added to give free cation concentrations of 27 or 6 μm, respectively. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, to a final concentration of 10 nmol/reaction, on ice. The reaction was terminated after 30 s by adding 0.2 ml of 50 mmNaH2PO4, 2 mm ATP, and 20% trichloroacetic acid. The resulting precipitate was pelleted by microcentrifugation and washed twice with a solution containing 25 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm ATP, and 10% trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was finally resuspended in 20 μl of sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 6.0 according to the method of Weber and Osborn (24Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gel was dried, and the radioactivity was detected on a PhosphorImager (Fuji). Reverse phosphorylation of Pmr1 was performed according to Hawkins et al. (25Hawkins S.C. Xu A. Narayanan N. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1191: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture of 0.2 ml contained 50 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, and one of the following: EGTA (5 mm) or CaCl2 or MnCl2 (100 μm). Phosphorylation was initiated by the addition of 200 μm32Pi (1500–2000 cpm/pmol) at 25 °C for 5 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 15% trichloroacetic acid and 2 mmKH2PO4 and incubated on ice for 15 min. After microcentrifugation, the pellet was treated as described for ATP-dependent (forward) phosphorylation and subjected to acid gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described previously (26Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were prepared for electrophoresis by precipitating with trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration at 10% by volume, followed by microcentrifugation at 4 °C. Antibodies against the C-terminal one-third of Pmr1 have been described previously (19Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Silver staining was performed according to Blum et al. (27Blum H. Beier H. Gros H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3743) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by a modification of the method of Lowry et al. (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recently developed algorithm (29Woolf T.B. Grossfield A. Sachs J.N. Biophys. J. 2000; 78 (abstr.): 159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was used to simulate packing of the M4 and M6 helices of Pmr1. Briefly, a reduced representation of the two helices was used in the first stage of modeling to simplify the search space. Each amino acid in a helix was considered to be a sphere with an empirically assigned volume that captures its packing attributes (30Pontius J. Richelle J. Wodak S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The ball-helix representation used a simple model for the membrane bilayer, with the interior based on the Goldman-Engelman-Steitz transfer scale (31Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar) and the interface based on the Wimley-White scale (32Wimley W.C. White S.H. Nature Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). Over 350,000 independent helix-pair combinations were explored to eliminate sterically “impossible” combinations. In the next stage, a more realistic representation of the membrane environment was applied, along with a more detailed protein representation. Finally, constraints were imposed based on experimental data from Cys cross-linking in SERCA (33Rice W.J. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and mutagenesis of cation-coordinating residues in M4 and M6, as depicted in Fig. 8. A 15-residue extension of the N terminus of Pmr1, having the sequence RGSQH9TR immediately following the initiating Met, was constructed in earlier work (13Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We showed that introduction of this polyhistidine tag had no effect on the biogenesis and Golgi localization of Pmr1, as determined by subcellular fractionation of yeast lysates, and on the overall protein conformation, as evidenced by the pattern of ATP-protectable tryptic cleavage (13Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore,V max and Km for45Ca transport were identical to that reported earlier for untagged Pmr1 (13Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the purification of His-tagged Pmr1 by nickel affinity chromatography, in essentially one step. Golgi membrane fractions, derived from sucrose density gradient centrifugation of yeast lysates (19Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), were pooled and treated with the detergent n-octylglucoside, resulting in the solubilization of up to 70% of Pmr1 (Fig. 1). The supernatant was allowed to interact with Ni-NTA resin, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The inclusion of 10 mmimidazole during this incubation was found to greatly reduce nonspecific protein interactions with the resin while preserving complete retention of His-Pmr1. After washing the resin with salt and additional imidazole (“Experimental Procedures”), His-Pmr1 was eluted at >95% purity in buffer containing 300 mmimidazole, as judged from silver stains and Western blots of SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Yields of Pmr1 protein averaged 30 μg/liter of culture (approximately 600 OD units), consistent with an estimated expression level of about 5% in Golgi membranes. The availability of a purified preparation of Pmr1 allowed an unambiguous demonstration of cation-dependent ATP hydrolyis, using a sensitive isotope-based method (“Experimental Procedures”). ATPase activity was strictly dependent on the presence of either Mn2+ or Ca2+ and was linear within the first 30 s (Fig.2). The presence of 500 μmvanadate (not shown) or 100 μm La3+ (Fig. 2) nearly abolished ATP hydrolysis, similar to the effect of these inhibitors on ATP-dependent 45Ca transport in Golgi vesicles (19Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). No ATPase activity was observed with 10 μm concentrations of either Ba2+, Sr2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, or Cu2+, demonstrating the narrow cation selectivity profile of the pump. A hallmark of P-type ATPases is the formation of a transient aspartyl-phosphate reaction intermediate, at an invariant aspartate located in the large hydrophilic domain closely following membrane span M4. Consistent with an obligatory role for this residue, we have shown that replacement of Asp371 in Pmr1 with asparagine or glutamate completely inactivates transport (19Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate phosphoenzyme formation in the purified, His-tagged enzyme. In the forward reaction, formation of the E∼P intermediate from ATP requires activation by either Ca2+ or Mn2+ (Fig.3 A). Addition of La3+ resulted in only modest increases in the accumulation of phosphoenzyme, unlike the large effect documented for plasma membrane type Ca2+-ATPases (34Adebayo A.O. Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27812-27816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The aspartyl-phosphate intermediate could be completely chased with excess unlabeled ATP (Fig.3 A) and nonenzymatically cleaved with hydroxylamine (not shown). Conversely, in the reverse reaction, formation of E-P from inorganic phosphate (Pi) was inhibited by Ca2+and Mn2+ (Fig. 3 B), which shift the equilibrium toward the E1 conformation. Substitution of Asp778, conserved in all known Ca2+-ATPases, with either alanine, asparagine, or glutamate, resulted in a complete loss of transport activity consistent with the loss-of-function phenotype in screens of BAPTA and Mn2+ toxicity (14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt P.A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, to demonstrate a role for this residue in cation binding, it was necessary to examine cation-dependent formation of the catalytic intermediate. We first showed that mutant D778A was normal with respect to biogenesis, trafficking, and overall protein conformation (14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt P.A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Next, mutant D778A was tagged with polyhistidine and purified, as described for wild type Pmr1. As expected, there was a complete absence of ATP hydrolysis in the purified mutant (not shown). Fig.4 demonstrates an inability of this mutant to form the cation-activated phosphoenzyme intermediate from ATP, whereas reverse phosphorylation from inorganic phosphate is retained. Strikingly, reverse phosphorylation is insensitive to inhibition by cation (Ca2+ and Mn2+), indicative of a loss of cation binding (15Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In the phenotypic screens reported earlier, mutant Q783A appeared similar to wild type in BAPTA tolerance but was indistinguishable from the pmr1 null strain in Mn2+ tolerance, suggesting a selective loss of Mn2+ transport (14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt P.A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Mn2+ inhibition of 45Ca transport in Golgi vesicles was decreased by 60-fold, suggestive of a severe defect in Mn2+ binding or transport in this mutant (14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt P.A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate a dramatic change in ion selectivity of the mutant pump by direct assay of cation-dependent ATPase activity in histidine-tagged and purified preparations of wild type and Q783A enzymes. Wild type Pmr1 displayed a Km of 0.07 μm for Ca2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis, identical to the Km for 45Ca transport reported earlier (13Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Both Km and V max of Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity in the Q783A mutant were essentially indistinguishable from wild type, as expected from the growth response to BAPTA in this mutant (Fig. 5 A). Mn2+-dependent ATPase activity in wild type had a Km of 0.02 μm, indicative of a normal selectivity of Mn2+ > Ca2+ for the Golgi/secretory pathway pump. In striking contrast, Mn2+-ATPase in the mutant was nearly abolished (Fig.5 B). We also show normal levels of Ca2+-activated phosphoenzyme formation from ATP in this mutant, whereas Mn2+ was required in excess (10 μm) to detect the catalytic intermediate (Fig.6). Taken together, the data strongly indicate that residue 783 in M6 can define ion selectivity in Pmr1.Figure 6Selective loss of Mn2+-dependent phosphoenzyme formation in the Q783A mutant. Purified, His-tagged Q783A mutant Pmr1 (1 μg) was assayed for phosphoenzyme formation from [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of EGTA (1 mm) or the free cation concentrations shown, as described in the text. Mn2+-dependent E∼P formation was detected only under the higher concentration of Mn2+ (10 μm), as shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further explore the effect of amino acid substitutions at position 783 on ion selectivity of the pump, additional mutations of Gln783 to Leu, Glu, Thr, Asn, Cys, and Ser were generated in the PMR1 gene. These substitutions were chosen to test the effect of side chain size, hydrophobicity, or charge. Mutants were expressed from the low copy vector YCpHR1 in the pmr1pmc1cnb1 null strain K616 and screened for tolerance to BAPTA and Mn2+ as a test of Ca2+ and Mn2+ transport, respectively (14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt P.A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7, only the Ala substitution resulted in a differential response to BAPTA and Mn2+ toxicity, indicative of a change in ion selectivity. Substitutions to Leu, Glu, or Thr showed substantial and parallel growth in both phenotypic screens, whereas substitutions to Asn, Ser, or Cys showed a hypersensitivity to BAPTA and Mn2+ toxicity indistinguishable from the pmr1 null strain. Western analysis of total membrane preparations revealed that expression of the Leu, Glu, and Thr substitutions were similar to wild type, whereas substitutions to Asn, Ser, and Cys showed a significant decrease in abundance, suggestive of structural perturbations (not shown). These data reveal the importance of a bulky side chain (Gln, Leu, Glu, or Thr) at position 783 in M6 for effective transport of both Ca2+ and Mn2+ ions. Charge appears to be unimportant because both Leu and Glu can effectively substitute for Gln at this site. Conversely, introduction of a small, polar side chain at this site appears deleterious to pump structure and function. Interestingly, the small nonpolar side chain of alanine maintained normal pump structure but apparently altered pore characteristics such that Mn2+ transport was selectively lost. Of the five polar or charged residues in transmembrane segment M6, three (Asn774, Asp778, and Gln783) were found to be critical for pump function (14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt P.A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The importance of M6 is underscored by a striking conservation of sequence among Pmr1 homologues, which include representatives from four other fungi and one each from C. elegans, rat, and human; with the exception of an Ile substitution for Leu, there is complete identity within the predicted M6 segment. Of the three Ca2+-liganding residues (Asn796, Thr799, and Asp800) in M6 of SERCA, originally identified by Clarke et al. (15Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), two (Asn774 and Asp778) are conserved and sensitive to substitution in the Golgi/secretory pathway ion pump. Replacement of the equivalent residues in the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase) have also been reported to inactivate transport and prevent phosphoenzyme formation from ATP (34Adebayo A.O. Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27812-27816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,35Guerini D. Foletti D. Vellani F. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Together with the conserved glutamate in M4 (Glu329 in Pmr1), these three residues are likely to contribute to the binding of one Ca2+ ion in all three Ca2+-ATPase subtypes. In SERCA, this site would be equivalent to binding site II, the more cytoplasmic of two stacked sites (36Skerjanc I.S. Toyofuku T. Richardson C. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15944-15950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15931-15936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A subset of these residues also appear to contribute to ion binding in P-type ATPases of different ion selectivities. Thus, Asp804 and Asp808 in M6 of the Na+/K+-ATPase have been proposed to play a key role in cation transport and in binding K+ ions in particular (16Kuntzweiler T.A. Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29682-29687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These observations have been corroborated by the mutagenesis of equivalent residues in the H+/K+-ATPase (38Swarts H.G. Klaassen C.H. de Boer M. Fransen J.A. De Pont J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29764-29772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The differential contribution of other residues to this common cation binding pocket may alter ion binding characteristics and account for the widely different ion selectivities among the P-ATPases. Thus, replacement of Ser775 in M5 of the Na+/K+-ATPase had a profound effect on K+ binding (39Blostein R. Wilczynska A. Karlish S.J.D. Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24987-24993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but mutation of the equivalent residue in Pmr1 (S774A) had no effect on Ca2+ or Mn2+ transport (14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt P.A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Identifying the residues that contribute to ion selectivity remains a challenge in the field. We report here that substitution of Gln783 with alanine results in a dramatic and selective loss of Mn2+- but not Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity and phosphoenzyme formation. We show that glutamine can be effectively replaced with either Leu (the equivalent residue in plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase) or Thr (the equivalent residue in SERCA), suggesting that Mn2+ transport may be a common feature of all Ca2+ pump subtypes. The restoration of Mn2+tolerance to a pmr1 mutant by heterologous expression of a plant homologue of SERCA, ECA1 (23Liang F. Cunningham K.W. Harper J.F. Sze H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8579-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), is consistent with this possibility. Curiously, introduction of an acidic residue (Glu) at this site preserved wild type phenotype, whereas small polar residues (Cys, Ser, or Asn) appeared to be deleterious to pump structure, based on the large reduction of Pmr1 expression levels. Because a helical representation of M6 placed Gln783 on the opposite face from the cation coordinating residues, we considered the possibility that this residue may be important in helix packing. Therefore, we simulated the packing interactions between transmembrane segments M4 and M6 (“Experimental Procedures”), using data from cysteine cross-links (33Rice W.J. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) to impose constraints on the models. Fig.8 is an alignment of Pmr1 sequence with that of SERCA, showing the excellent conservation in the regions identified by strong cross-links between engineered Cys in transmembrane segments M4 and M6 of SERCA. In a hierarchical approach to ab initio structure prediction, we began with a reduced representation of the helices in which each amino acid was empirically assigned a spherical volume, characteristic of its packing attributes. Likewise, a reduced representation of the membrane environment was used (“Experimental Procedures”) to simplify the search space. This allowed over 350,000 candidate conformations to be tested in the first stage, resulting in the elimination of all sterically impossible combinations. Following a second modeling stage that employed a more detailed protein and membrane representation, we imposed experimental constraints from Cys cross-linking and orientation of cation coordinating residues (Fig. 8). Of the dozen or so plausible models that emerged, Fig.9 represents the minimum energy structure and has several interesting features. The helices interact with a right-handed twist, consistent with the interpretation of electron diffraction densities reported by Zhang et al. (40Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Neither M4 nor M6 are uniform helices; both display a significant unraveling in the vicinities of the prolines, followed by a change in backbone direction. Of particular interest to this work is the location of Gln783 in the model. Fig. 9 suggests that Gln783 (M6) may form a hydrophobic contact with Val335 (M4), possibly stabilizing the helical interaction. It should be emphasized that although our tertiary structure prediction does not take into account other transmembrane helices or consider significant deviations from helical structure, it does satisfy our currrent experimental observations and therefore provides a testable model for future experiments. Thus, it suggests that the hydrophobic interaction with Val335 may be maintained by the longer methyl- or methylene-containing side chains of Glu, Leu, or Thr but would be disrupted by introduction of shorter side chains carrying the polar amine (Asn), sulfhydryl (Cys), or hydroxyl (Ser) groups. Alanine substitution may maintain the hydrophobic interaction but with likely alterations in helix packing. We suggest that these changes would have repercussions on the architecture of the ion pore and hence on ion selectivity. The arrangement and tilt of the helices may be expected to have a profound effect on ion selectivity, as suggested by the recent structure of the KcsA K+ channel (41Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5759) Google Scholar). In experiments currently underway in our laboratory, we are engineering reciprocal alterations in M4 in an attempt to suppress the Mn2+-sensitive phenotype of Pmr1 mutant Q783A."
https://openalex.org/W2121844388,"Factor XII deficiency has been postulated to be a risk factor for thrombosis suggesting that factor XII is an antithrombotic protein. The biochemical mechanism leading to this clinical observation is unknown. We have previously reported high molecular weight kininogen (HK) inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation by binding to the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex. Although factor XII will bind to the intact platelet through GP Ibα (glycocalicin) without activation, we now report that factor XIIa (0.37 μm), but not factor XII zymogen, is required for the inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Factor XIIa had no significant effect on SFLLRN-induced platelet aggregation. Moreover, an antibody to the thrombin site on protease-activated receptor-1 failed to block factor XII binding to platelets. Inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was demonstrated with factor XIIa but not with factor XII zymogen or factor XIIf, indicating that the conformational exposure of the heavy chain following proteolytic activation is required for inhibition. However, inactivation of the catalytic activity of factor XIIa did not affect the inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Factor XII showed displacement of biotin-labeled HK (30 nm) binding to gel-filtered platelets and, at concentrations of 50 nm, was able to block 50% of the HK binding, suggesting involvement of the GP Ib complex. Antibodies to GP Ib and GP IX, which inhibited HK binding to platelets, did not block factor XII binding. However, using a biosensor, which monitors protein-protein interactions, both HK and factor XII bind to GP Ibα. Factor XII may serve to regulate thrombin binding to the GP Ib receptor by co-localizing with HK, to control the extent of platelet aggregation in vivo. Factor XII deficiency has been postulated to be a risk factor for thrombosis suggesting that factor XII is an antithrombotic protein. The biochemical mechanism leading to this clinical observation is unknown. We have previously reported high molecular weight kininogen (HK) inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation by binding to the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex. Although factor XII will bind to the intact platelet through GP Ibα (glycocalicin) without activation, we now report that factor XIIa (0.37 μm), but not factor XII zymogen, is required for the inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Factor XIIa had no significant effect on SFLLRN-induced platelet aggregation. Moreover, an antibody to the thrombin site on protease-activated receptor-1 failed to block factor XII binding to platelets. Inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was demonstrated with factor XIIa but not with factor XII zymogen or factor XIIf, indicating that the conformational exposure of the heavy chain following proteolytic activation is required for inhibition. However, inactivation of the catalytic activity of factor XIIa did not affect the inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Factor XII showed displacement of biotin-labeled HK (30 nm) binding to gel-filtered platelets and, at concentrations of 50 nm, was able to block 50% of the HK binding, suggesting involvement of the GP Ib complex. Antibodies to GP Ib and GP IX, which inhibited HK binding to platelets, did not block factor XII binding. However, using a biosensor, which monitors protein-protein interactions, both HK and factor XII bind to GP Ibα. Factor XII may serve to regulate thrombin binding to the GP Ib receptor by co-localizing with HK, to control the extent of platelet aggregation in vivo. high molecular weight kininogen glycoprotein protease-activated receptor-1 protease-activated receptor-4 fluorescein isothiocyanate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis seven transmembrane domain receptor thrombin receptor activation peptide relative units 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride Recently, the functions of the contact system have been reevaluated in view of our increasing knowledge of the interactions of factor XII, prekallikrein, and kininogens with platelets, neutrophils, monocytes, and endothelial cells. Prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time found with individuals, having deficiencies of the contact proteins, originally suggested a coagulation defect. However, no hemorrhagic diathesis has ever been demonstrated. Recently, anticoagulant (1Bradford H.N. Dela Cadena R.A. Kunapuli S.P. Dong J.F. Lopez J.A. Colman R.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and profibrinolytic (2Lin Y. Harris R.B. Yan W. McCrae K.R. Zhang H. Colman R.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 690-697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) activities of these proteins have now been documented in vitro and in some cases in vivo (3Colman R.W. White J.V. Scovell S. Stadnicki A. Sartor R.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2245-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The locus of the anticoagulant action of the contact system appears to be the platelet. Puri et al. (4Puri R.N. Zhou F. Hu C.J. Colman R.F. Colman R.W. Blood. 1991; 77: 500-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that HK1 inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation by inhibiting the binding of thrombin to platelets. Domain 3 of HK is responsible (5Jiang Y.P. Muller-Esterl W. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3712-3717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the binding site on platelets, which mediates this effect, was shown to be GP Ib-IX complex (1Bradford H.N. Dela Cadena R.A. Kunapuli S.P. Dong J.F. Lopez J.A. Colman R.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation helps to explain the fact that patients with Bernard-Soulier disease require 10-fold the concentration of thrombin needed to stimulate normal platelets (6Jandrot-Perrus M. Rendu F. Caen J.P. Levy-Toledano S. Guillin M.C. Br. J. Haematol. 1990; 75: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Kininogens also shift the dose-response curve for thrombin activation of platelets about 10-fold (1Bradford H.N. Dela Cadena R.A. Kunapuli S.P. Dong J.F. Lopez J.A. Colman R.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Puri R.N. Zhou F. Hu C.J. Colman R.F. Colman R.W. Blood. 1991; 77: 500-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies were confirmed by Joseph et al. (7Joseph K. Nakazawa Y. Bahou W.F. Ghebrehiwet B. Kaplan A.P. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 555-563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who demonstrated that a molecule of 74 kDa, isolated by ligand affinity chromatography utilizing HK, was a fragment of the GP Ibα chain. Furthermore, they demonstrated that biotinylated factor XII bound to the same Western-blotted GP Ibα fragment in a Zn2+-dependent interaction. Platelet-fibrin thrombi, which result from the action of thrombin on fibrinogen and platelets, appear to be important in such complications as reocclusion after angioplasty or thrombolysis (8Puri R.N. Colman R.W. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinolysis. 1993; 4: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). At least two receptors are involved in the events triggered by the binding of thrombin receptors to platelets. The first is the high affinity, low capacity (40 sites/cell) receptor present on the 45-kDa amino terminus of glycoprotein Ib (9Harmon J.T. Jamieson G.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) expressed in the GP Ib-IX-V complex. The second is PAR1, which is coupled directly to G proteins and activated by the new amino terminus of the tethered peptide (10Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2679) Google Scholar) resulting from thrombin cleavage, and is a moderate affinity receptor. Specific targeting of either receptor should modulate the effect of thrombin on platelets without inhibiting thrombin-induced proteolysis or the effects of other agonists for platelets including ADP, collagen, and thromboxane A2. Greco et al. (11Greco N.J. Tandon N.N. Jones G.D. Kornhauser R. Jackson B. Yamamoto N. Tanoue K. Jamieson G.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 906-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have presented evidence that both GP Ib and PAR1 are required to ensure optimal rate and extent of platelet responses, such as an increase in intracellular Ca2+, at a range of thrombin concentrations of 0.3–10 nm. Recently a third human protein, PAR4 (12Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Huang W. Bigornia V. Zeng D. Moff S. Farese Jr., R.V. Tam C. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1998; 394: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar), has been shown to be involved in thrombin activation of platelets at high thrombin concentrations,e.g. 30 nm (13Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Factor XII is a plasma protein present in a concentration of 370 nm. Factor XII is a glycoprotein of β-globulin mobility composed of 596 amino acids, 16.8% carbohydrate, with a molecular mass of 78–80 kDa. Activation of zymogen factor XII is initiated by a single cleavage resulting in a two-chain molecule held together by a single disulfide bond designated factor XIIa. The disulfide-linked enzyme is composed of a light chain, 28 kDa, containing the catalytic site of the enzyme, and a heavy chain, 52 kDa, containing the surface binding region of the molecule. In vitro, further proteolysis is known to transform human factor XIIa to a smaller enzyme, 30 kDa, lacking the heavy chain, designated factor XIIf (also known as β-factor XIIa). Factor XIIf retains its ability to rapidly cleave and activate some coagulation zymogens such as prekallikrein but not others such as factor XI. The entire primary amino acid sequence of factor XII has been reported and has revealed that the light chain and, more particularly, the heavy chain have structural features that, by homology, imply further physiological functions of the molecule (14McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Fujikawa K. McMullen B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10924-10933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cool D.E. Edgell C.J. Louie G.V. Zoller M.J. Brayer G.D. MacGillivray R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13666-13676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The light chain of factor XIIa is homologous to plasmin, an enzyme that participates in fibrinolysis, and to tissue plasminogen activator, a protease that converts plasminogen to plasmin in the fibrinolytic pathway. The sequence homology is highest at the activation regions and near the active sites of these proteases. The heavy chain has extensive sequence homology with both fibronectin and tissue plasminogen activator. The heavy chain shares sequence homology with type II regions of fibronectin and is composed of approximately 60 residues including four half-cysteine residues. The type II homologies probably comprise the collagen-binding site in fibronectin and, by analogy, may be responsible for reported collagen-binding properties of factor XII. Two regions of factor XII are homologous to a sequence resembling epidermal growth factor that could represent regions of factor XII that interact with cells, such as neutrophils or monocytes. The heavy chain also contains a proline-rich region making up 33% of the sequence, the significance of which is unclear at this time, but it most likely functions as a connection domain between the light chain and heavy chains of factor XII. HK and factor XII compete for the same binding site on endothelial cells (17Reddigari S.R. Shibayama Y. Brunnee T. Kaplan A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11982-11987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the hypothesis that factor XII, like HK, would inhibit thrombin binding to the GP Ib-IX-V complex. We studied whether factor XII or its derivatives factor XIIa and XIIf were responsible for the modulation of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. We also determined the role of the other thrombin receptors, PAR1 and PAR4, for the inhibitory effect of factor XIIa on the activation of platelets by thrombin. Avidin-FITC, lot number 037H4839 (2.5 mg/ml), at a concentration of 36 μm, was purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were of the best purity available. Human α-thrombin was a generous gift of Dr. John W. Fenton II (Division of Laboratories and Research, New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY) and had an activity of 2400 NIH units/mg and a purity of 99.24%. Human HK (1.6 mg/ml), human factor XII (1.01 mg/ml), and human factor XIIa (0.6–0.75 mg/ml) were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN. On SDS-PAGE, HK, a component of >95% migrating at a mass of 120 kDa, and factor XII, a single component of 80 kDa, both remained unchanged on reduction with mercaptoethanol. Factor XIIa was a single component of 80 kDa and resolved two components of 50 and 30 kDa on reduction. Factor XII was also purified from plasma by affinity chromatography using the monoclonal antibody to the heavy chain, B7C9, prepared in our laboratory as described previously (18Pixley R.A. Stumpo L.G. Birkmeyer K. Silver L. Colman R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10140-10145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), following prekallikrein removal with a monoclonal antibody 13G11 affinity column. Factor XII fragment was prepared by activation with plasma kallikrein and separated by anion exchange chromatography (19Pixley R.A. Colman R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Glycocalicin (1.1 mg/ml) was a generous gift of Dr. José A. López (Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Houston). The peptide SFLLRN was synthesized, purified, and characterized as published (18Pixley R.A. Stumpo L.G. Birkmeyer K. Silver L. Colman R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10140-10145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The buffer containing commercial human factor XIIa (0.6 mg/ml) was increased to 0.5 m NaCl, and the pH was adjusted to 7.5 with 0.5 n NaOH. The sample was then divided equally, and one portion brought to 1 mm AEBSF with the addition of 100 mm AEBSF solubilized in a neutral buffer. AEBSF is known to inhibit serine proteases with specificity similar to trypsin by irreversibly modifying the active site (20Walsmann P. Landmann H. Markwardt F. Sturzebecher J. Vieweg H. Wagner G. Pharmazie. 1974; 29: 413-415PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining portion had the identical volume of buffer added excluding the AEBSF inhibitor, and both samples were then dialyzed at 4 °C for 4 h in HEPES/Tyrode's buffer + 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5, to remove inhibitor and exchange the buffer solution. Both samples were assayed for protein content, factor XII clotting activity, and amidolytic activity (19Pixley R.A. Colman R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). AEBSF inactivation of factor XIIa reduced both coagulant and amidolytic activity by 92% compared with the control sample. Platelet isolation by gel filtration and platelet aggregation was performed as described previously (21Kunapuli S.P. Bradford H.N. Jameson B.A. DeLa Cadena R.A. Rick L. Wassell R.P. Colman R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11228-11235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot of platelets (>100,000/μl) and added inhibitors in a 0.5-ml cuvette at 37 °C was incubated with stirring for 2 min in the presence of 50 μm free Zn2+. Aggregation was monitored for 5 min after the addition of 2 nm thrombin. The rate of aggregation was measured as the slope of the line in the presence of added inhibitors compared with the same sample measured by activation with thrombin alone. Desensitization of the human platelet PAR1 receptor was performed by a modification of the procedure (12Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Huang W. Bigornia V. Zeng D. Moff S. Farese Jr., R.V. Tam C. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1998; 394: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar) using platelets obtained from 100 ml of freshly drawn blood, collected into acid/citrate/dextrose. Briefly, platelets were washed by centrifugation, and after the addition of 1 mm EDTA and 1 μm prostaglandin E1 the resulting platelet pellet was incubated with 100 μm SFLLRN peptide at room temperature for 5 min without stirring. Following incubation with the SFLLRN peptide, the resuspended platelet preparation was gel-filtered to remove any remaining inhibitors or agonists (21Kunapuli S.P. Bradford H.N. Jameson B.A. DeLa Cadena R.A. Rick L. Wassell R.P. Colman R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11228-11235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The resulting platelet pool yielded concentrations between 2 and 6 × 108 cells/ml and were further tested for response to SFLLRN- and thrombin-induced aggregation at 37 °C. Western blotting was performed according to the protocol of Towbin et al. (22Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 μg each of two-chain HK, factor XII, and thrombin were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE or in the absence of SDS (native gel) and then transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). After blocking of the unbound protein surface sites, the transfer was probed with 1 μg/ml of factor XII (all of the following conditions are performed in the presence of 50 μmZn2+), washed, and detected with the polyclonal goat anti-factor XII antibody, FMR-43 (Federated Medical Research, raised in goats against whole factor XII antigen). After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, the transfer was washed and developed with anti-goat alkaline phosphatase-conjugated IgG. The monoclonal antibodies AK-1, which binds to GP IX close to its site of interaction with GP Ib, AK-2, which recognizes the 45-kDa ligand-binding peptide tail of GP Ibα, and AK-3, which binds to the macroglycopeptide of GP Ibα (23Berndt M.C. Du X.P. Booth W.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), were provided by Dr. William J. Booth, University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia. AK-2 blocks thrombin binding to GP Ibα but does not inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, whereas AK-1 and AK-3 have no effect on thrombin binding. The monoclonal antibody to GP IX, FMC-25 (which does not block thrombin binding), was supplied by Dr. Manling Peng and developed by Berndt et al. (24Berndt M.C. Gregory C. Kabral A. Zola H. Fournier D. Castaldi P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 637-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). SZ2, which only blocks thrombin binding at low concentrations but can inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, was purchased from Biodesign International, Kennebunk, ME, and recognized GP Ibα (extracellular domain) (25Ruan C.G. Du X.P. Xi X.D. Castaldi P.A. Berndt M.C. Blood. 1987; 69: 570-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biotinylated antibody TM-60 (260 μg/ml), which binds to the amino-terminal 45-kDa peptide of GP Ibα and also inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (26Yamamoto K. Yamamoto N. Kitagawa H. Tanoue K. Kosaki G. Yamazaki H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1986; 55: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), was a generous gift of Dr. Naomasa Yamamoto, The Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan. A rabbit polyclonal antibody, anti-STDR (11Greco N.J. Tandon N.N. Jones G.D. Kornhauser R. Jackson B. Yamamoto N. Tanoue K. Jamieson G.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 906-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), raised to the synthetic peptide LLRNPNDKYEPF was a gift from Dr. Nicolas J. Greco (Holland Laboratory, American Red Cross, Rockville, MD). This antibody blocks the binding of thrombin to PAR1. In the cell fluorescence assays (cytofluorescence) using biotinylated antibody or ligand, binding was detected, after washing, with FITC-labeled avidin (100 μl of a 1–200 dilution of the stock reagent, resulting in a final FITC-avidin concentration of 180 nm) and incubated for 30 min at 23 °C. Following washing and removal of the supernatant by vacuum, plates were analyzed for fluorescent antibody bound to the platelets at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and detected at an emission wavelength of 530 nm in a Millipore fluorescence microtiter plate reader. Results were determined from the fluorescence detected in the presence of 50 μm free Zn2+ after subtraction of the fluorescence measured for the identical points in the absence of added Zn2+. Five monoclonal antibodies were tested using cytofluorescence for the ability to block zinc-dependent, biotin-labeled factor XII or HK binding to gel-filtered platelets. A monoclonal antibody to factor XII (B7C9) was used as a positive control. The monoclonal antibodies were all tested at 1 μm. AK-2, TM-60 (both directed to the 45-kDa amino-terminal region of GP Ibα), AK-3 (directed to the macroglycopeptide region of GP Ibα), AK-1, and FMC-25 (both binding to GP-IX) were incubated with factor XII (370 nm). Biomolecular interaction assays were performed using a Biacore 2000 (Biacore AB Uppsala, Sweden). To obtain a carboxyl-terminal linked ligand, glycocalicin was oxidized for 20 min in 10 mmsodium periodate, passed over a NAP-5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and equilibrated in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0. The resulting protein (0.2 mg/ml) was coupled to flow cell 2 (flow cell 1 was chemically modified without coupled ligand as a background channel) on a CM-5 biosensor chip using the surface thiol method according to the BIAapplications handbook. The ligand-coupled chip resulted in 12,000 RU bound (1 RU = 1 pmol). Assays were performed by exposing both flow cells to 200 nm analyte at 20 μl/min for 3 min in a flow buffer containing 0.01 mHEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.005% polysorbate 20, pH 7.4, in the presence or absence of 50 μm Zn2+. In the analyzed experiments, the experimental groups or points were compared with the control by paired Student'st test. Values were reported as significant whenp < 0.05 where not otherwise indicated. The rate of platelet aggregation was determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of thrombin (0.2–2.0 nm) alone or with the addition of factor XIIa (370 nm). Factor XIIa significantly inhibited the observed maximal rate of aggregation by 60% at 1 nm thrombin and by 40% at 2 nm thrombin compared with the rates in the absence of factor XIIa (Fig. 1). Unlike the inhibition by HK of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (1Bradford H.N. Dela Cadena R.A. Kunapuli S.P. Dong J.F. Lopez J.A. Colman R.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of factor XIIa is still evident at a thrombin concentration of 2 nm. In a separate experiment, thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (2 nm) was measured alone or with the additions of factor XII, XIIa, and XIIf at concentrations from 185 to 740 nm (50–200% of the plasma concentration) (Fig.2). The inhibition of aggregation was observed with increasing concentrations by factor XIIa only. Neither factor XII fragment (light chain, with the same enzymatic activity as factor XIIa) nor factor XII zymogen inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation at any concentration tested suggesting that a conformational change in the heavy chain after proteolytic activation is required. To define further if the inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation by XIIa requires both the exposure of the factor XII heavy chain and a functional active site, we tested the inhibitory response of AEBSF-treated factor XIIa compared with a control XIIa sample prepared in parallel without the inactivation by AEBSF. The inhibition profile of the inactivated factor XIIa that had only 8% of the catalytic activity of the parent factor XIIa was identical to the fully catalytically active factor XIIa (Fig.3). These results indicate that the inhibitory potency of human factor XIIa resides in the heavy chain and that catalytic activity is not required.Figure 2Thrombin-induced platelet aggregation is inhibited by the heavy chain of factor XIIa. Thrombin-induced platelet aggregation alone (2 nm) is compared with platelet aggregation in the presence of increasing amounts of factor XII zymogen (black bars), activated factor XII (light gray bars), and factor XII fragment (dark gray bars). The inhibition by each factor XII species of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was expressed as a percentage of aggregation by thrombin alone. Factor XIIa containing the heavy chain, but not factor XII zymogen or XIIf, was a potent, dose-dependent inhibitor of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Factor XII fragment or factor XII zymogen could not block aggregation, indicating that this inhibition is due to the conformational exposure of the heavy chain of factor XIIa and that the catalytic domain is not sufficient.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3The active site of factor XIIa is not required to inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Factor XIIa was treated with 1 mm AEBSF to modify covalently the active site serine and thus inactivate the catalytic site. Thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was determined in the presence of XIIa and AEBSF-inactivated XIIa. Inactivated factor XIIa (gray bars) showed no differences in concentration dependence (185–740 nm) when compared with untreated factor XIIa (black bars). The data are derived from three separate experiments expressed as mean ± S.E. The results are reported as the percent of the rate of thrombin-induced aggregation with inhibitor compared with thrombin alone (2 nm). This experiment demonstrates that factor XIIa inhibition of platelet aggregation is due to the conformational exposure of the heavy chain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Following SDS-PAGE or native (non-SDS) gel protein separation and transfer to Immobilon-P, HK, and thrombin, in the presence of 50 μm Zn2+, were probed with factor XII, followed by a polyclonal antibody to factor XII (FMR-43) and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. No reaction with either HK or thrombin was detected by this ligand blot technique. In contrast, factor XII is readily detected with FMR-43 under both reduced and nonreduced conditions (data not shown). This experiment demonstrates that no detectable complex formation was observable between factor XII and either HK or thrombin. Factor XIIa (370 nm) was incubated with gel-filtered platelets for 2 min, and then aggregation was induced with either thrombin (1 nm) or the TRAP, SFLLRN (10 μm). In contrast to factor XIIa inhibition of thrombin-induced aggregation, the rate of TRAP-induced aggregation was not significantly altered with the addition of factor XIIa (Fig. 4), indicating that factor XIIa did not inhibit the interaction of the new amino terminus of the tethered peptide resulting from the cleavage of PAR1 with its exosite on the same receptor. Platelets (1.7 × 108/ml) pretreated with murine IgG to block nonspecific Fc receptors were also incubated with 1 μm anti-LLRNPNDKYEPF (rabbit polyclonal), an antibody that prevents initial binding of thrombin, or with 1 μm rabbit IgG (nonspecific control), and then the binding of 250 nm biotin-labeled factor XII in the presence of 50 μm Zn2+ was detected using cytofluorescence. The antibody failed to block significantly the binding of biotin-labeled factor XII to gel-filtered platelets when compared with IgG or ligand alone (Fig.5), indicating that factor XII does not bind to uncleaved PAR1 at the same site as thrombin. These experiments, taken together, demonstrate that factor XII does not inhibit thrombin action on platelets by binding to PAR1, and therefore its cleavage product, factor XIIa, acts on GP Ib complex.Figure 5Effects of anti-LLRPNDKYEPF (anti-PAR1) on biotin-labeled factor XII. Gel-filtered platelets (1.7 × 108/ml) were incubated with 1 μm anti-PAR1 antibody (ab) or rabbit IgG (IgG). The binding of biotin-labeled factor XII (250 nm) was measured in the presence of 50 μm Zn2+. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. (n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Unlike HK (1Bradford H.N. Dela Cadena R.A. Kunapuli S.P. Dong J.F. Lopez J.A. Colman R.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) the inhibitory effect of factor XIIa is not overcome completely by raising the concentration to 2 nm (Fig. 1). Nonetheless factor XIIa does not inhibit the effect of TRAP-induced aggregation. Furthermore, an antibody to PAR1 (anti-STDR) did not block the binding of factor XII. These observations led us to consider the role of PAR4 in the inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet activation by factor XIIa. We studied the possible involvement of PAR4 by desensitizing the platelet response to PAR1 by incubation with SFLLRN (13Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) as described under “Materials and Methods.” After desensitization, platelets did not aggregate in response to 100 μm SFLLRN (data not shown). The concentration dependence of thrombin was markedly shifted. Instead of an observed aggregation response from 0.1 nm to reaching a maximum at 2 nm (see Ref. 1Bradford H.N. Dela Cadena R.A. Kunapuli S.P. Dong J.F. Lopez J.A. Colman R.W. Blood."
https://openalex.org/W2022681517,"RNA hairpin aptamers specific for the trans-activation-responsive (TAR) RNA element of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 were identified by in vitro selection (Ducongé, F., and Toulmé, J. J. (1999) RNA5, 1605–1614). The high affinity sequences selected at physiological magnesium concentration (3 mm) were shown to form a loop-loop complex with the targeted TAR RNA. The stability of this complex depends on the aptamer loop closing “GA pair” as characterized by preliminary electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Thermal denaturation monitored by UV-absorption spectroscopy and binding kinetics determined by surface plasmon resonance show that the GA pair is crucial for the formation of the TAR-RNA aptamer complex. Both thermal denaturation and surface plasmon resonance experiments show that any other “pairs” leads to complexes whose stability decreases in the order AG > GG > GU > AA > GC > UA >> CA, CU. The binding kinetics indicate that stability is controlled by the off-rate rather than by the on-rate. Comparison with the complex formed with the TAR* hairpin, a rationally designed TAR RNA ligand (Chang, K. Y., and Tinoco, I. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 8705–8709), demonstrates that the GA pair is a key determinant which accounts for the 50-fold increased stability of the TAR-aptamer complex (K d= 2.0 nm) over the TAR-TAR* one (K d = 92.5 nm) at physiological concentration of magnesium. Replacement of the wild-type GC pair next to the loop of RNA I′ by a GA pair stabilizes the RNA I′-RNA II′ loop-loop complex derived from the one involved in the control of the ColE1 plasmid replication. Thus, the GA pair might be the preferred one for stable loop-loop interactions. RNA hairpin aptamers specific for the trans-activation-responsive (TAR) RNA element of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 were identified by in vitro selection (Ducongé, F., and Toulmé, J. J. (1999) RNA5, 1605–1614). The high affinity sequences selected at physiological magnesium concentration (3 mm) were shown to form a loop-loop complex with the targeted TAR RNA. The stability of this complex depends on the aptamer loop closing “GA pair” as characterized by preliminary electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Thermal denaturation monitored by UV-absorption spectroscopy and binding kinetics determined by surface plasmon resonance show that the GA pair is crucial for the formation of the TAR-RNA aptamer complex. Both thermal denaturation and surface plasmon resonance experiments show that any other “pairs” leads to complexes whose stability decreases in the order AG > GG > GU > AA > GC > UA >> CA, CU. The binding kinetics indicate that stability is controlled by the off-rate rather than by the on-rate. Comparison with the complex formed with the TAR* hairpin, a rationally designed TAR RNA ligand (Chang, K. Y., and Tinoco, I. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 8705–8709), demonstrates that the GA pair is a key determinant which accounts for the 50-fold increased stability of the TAR-aptamer complex (K d= 2.0 nm) over the TAR-TAR* one (K d = 92.5 nm) at physiological concentration of magnesium. Replacement of the wild-type GC pair next to the loop of RNA I′ by a GA pair stabilizes the RNA I′-RNA II′ loop-loop complex derived from the one involved in the control of the ColE1 plasmid replication. Thus, the GA pair might be the preferred one for stable loop-loop interactions. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 nucleotide(s) surface plasmon resonance electrophoretic mobility shift assay resonance unit(s) trans-activation-responsive Intermolecular interactions between structured RNA play key roles in the regulation of gene expression. In Escherichia coli, the replication of the ColE1 plasmid is regulated by the interaction of two RNA transcripts, RNA I and RNA II, which fold as hairpins (1.Tomizawa J.I. Cell. 1986; 47: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 2.Eguchi Y. Tomizawa J.I. Cell. 1990; 60: 199-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The interaction starts with base pairing between the complementary loops of these RNAs and leads to the formation of a double-stranded RNA along the entire length of RNA I, thus disrupting the RNA II hybridization with the template DNA required for replication (3.Tomizawa J.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 4.Masukata H. Tomizawa J.I. Cell. 1986; 44: 125-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Even if the stability of these so-called “kissing” complexes is primarily based on loop complementarity (2.Eguchi Y. Tomizawa J.I. Cell. 1990; 60: 199-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), factors such as the orientation of the loops (5.Eguchi Y. Tomizawa J.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the loop closing base pair, and the sequence of each stem next to the loop (6.Gregorian Jr., R.S. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 968-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), are crucial for stability. For instance, the loop inversion 5′ to 3′ induces a 350-fold increased stability of the RNA I-RNA II complex. In HIV-1,1 the dimerization of the genomic RNA involves the formation of a loop-loop complex between two structured regions (7.Paillart J.C. Westhof E. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The dimerization initiation site of HIV-1 RNA folds as a hairpin, which is closed by a noncanonical AA pair. The 9-nt-long loop contains a 6-nt self-complementary sequence flanked by two 5′ and one 3′ purines, which, together with loop complementarity, are crucial for the dimerization process (8.Jossinet F.

Non-Watson-Crick interactions in RNA molecules have been also reported in the viral RNA element bound by the Rev protein of HIV-1 (9.Bartel D.P. Zapp M.L. Green M.R. Szostak J.W.

All these results indicate that interactions other than canonical base pairs contribute to the structural diversity displayed by RNAs, which, as a matter of fact, is crucial for activity. The contribution of such noncanonical interactions can actually be conveniently explored by in vitro selection, since neither the structure of the target nor the interactions between the target and the interacting aptamer need to be known (18.Ellington A.D. Conrad R. Bio/Technol. Annu. Rev. 1995; 1: 185-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19.Gold L. Polisky B. Uhlenbeck O. Yarus M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 763-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). This strategy was successfully used in our laboratory to identify DNA aptamers against DNA (20.Mishra R.K. Toulmé J.J. C. R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12730-12737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recently, RNA aptamers specific for the trans-activation-responsive (TAR) RNA (24.Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) were selected by in vitro selection (25.Ducongé F. Toulmé J.J. RNA. 1999; 5: 1605-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The TAR RNA element is a 59-nt-long imperfect stem loop structure located at the 5′ end of the retroviral RNA. A 3-nt bulge in the upper part of the hairpin constitutes part of the binding site of the viral protein Tat, which recruits cyclin T1. Together with additional TAR-bound cellular proteins, this complex prevents abortion of the transcription of the retroviral genome. Therefore, TAR plays a key role in the life cycle of HIV-1 and constitutes a valid target for the development of ligands, which could inhibit its interaction with viral and cellular proteins, thus ultimately preventing the development of the virus. The isolated high affinity anti-TAR aptamers were shown to fold as imperfect hairpins and form kissing complexes with the targeted RNA at physiological magnesium concentration. The apical loop of all these aptamers corresponds to the 5′-GUCCCAGA-3′ consensus sequence, the six central bases of which are complementary to the entire TAR loop whereas a conserved “GA pair” closes the loop. As forColE1 RNA I and RNA II, and HIV-1 dimerization initiation site RNA motif, interactions other than loop complementarity are crucial for stability. Indeed, several mutations of the GA pair that closes the loop of the identified RNA aptamers decrease the stability of the TAR-aptamer complex, as shown by preliminary electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). In the work presented herein, the role of this GA pair was investigated at physiological concentration of magnesium by systematically mutating the loop closing pair of the aptamer. The effects of these mutations on the stability of the TAR RNA-aptamer complex were analyzed by thermal denaturation monitored by UV-absorption spectroscopy (26.Breslauer K.J. Agrawal S. Protocols for Oligonucleotide Conjugates. 26. Humana Press Inc., 1994: 347-372Google Scholar, 27.Puglisi J.D. Tinoco Jr., I. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 304-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The binding kinetics were determined by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). This physical phenomenon is used to follow in real time the interaction between a molecule in a continuous flow and an immobilized one (28.Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Persson B. Roos H. Ronnberg I. et al.BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous studies have been published on protein-protein interactions, protein-ligand interactions, and protein-nucleic acid interactions, but a much reduced number of investigations of nucleic acid-nucleic acid interactions are available (29.Crouch R.J. Wakasa M. Haruki M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 143-160PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Morton T.A. Myszka D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 295: 268-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 31.Schuck P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As a matter of fact, no RNA-RNA complexes have been analyzed up to now. Our results demonstrate that the aptamer loop closing GA pair is crucial for the stability of the TAR-RNA aptamer complex once formed. This likely explains the higher stability of the loop-loop complex formed by TAR with the aptamer, at physiological magnesium concentration, compared with the one formed with the rationally designed hairpin, TAR*, whose loop is closed by a UA pair (32.Chang K.Y. Tinoco I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8705-8709Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The increased stability of a loop-loop complex formed between RNA II′ and a RNA I′ mutant in which the GC pair next to loop was replaced by GA suggests that closing GA pair could be preferred for kissing complexes. All RNA molecules including the biotinylated TAR RNA were synthesized on an Expedite 8908 synthesizer and purified by electrophoresis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The pure samples were desalted on Sephadex G-25 spin columns. To avoid repeated thawing and freezing of the stock solutions, the samples were aliquoted at a volume and a concentration suitable for each experiment and stored at −20 °C. Before the experiments, each RNA sample used was heated at 95 °C during 1 min and then put on ice for 10 min to avoid the formation of intermolecular complexes. Thermal denaturation of RNA complexes in 20 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, at 20 °C, with 140 mm potassium chloride, 20 mm sodium chloride and 3 mm magnesium chloride (R′ buffer) was monitored on a Cary 1 spectrophotometer interfaced with a Peltier effect device that controls temperature within ±0.1 °C. Denaturation of the samples was achieved by increasing the temperature at 0.4 °C/min from 5 °C to 90 °C and was followed at 260 nm. A cuvette that contained R′ buffer was used as the reference. Except cacodylate, which replaced the temperature-sensitive HEPES, the buffer used for these thermal denaturation experiments was equivalent to the one used during the in vitro selection process (25.Ducongé F. Toulmé J.J. RNA. 1999; 5: 1605-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As the absorbance of the TAR RNA at 260 nm is too large to allow accurate monitoring of the absorption change resulting from the denaturation of the bimolecular complex between the HIV-1 RNA and the RNA aptamer, the experiments were carried on with miniTAR, a 27-mer oligonucleotide, instead of the entire TAR hairpin, which is 59 nt. RNA samples were prepared at 1 μm final concentration in the mixture. They were mixed at room temperature and allowed to interact 30 min before cooling down to 5 °C. The experiment then started after 1 h at this temperature. The enthalpy change, ΔH, for the formation of the bimolecular complex, was deduced from the total RNA concentration dependence of the Tm according to Equation1. 1Tm=RΔHln[ARN] total+ΔS−Rln4ΔHEquation 1 The number of magnesium ions that bind upon formation of the complex, ΔMg2+, was determined from the ion concentration dependence of the melting temperature, Tm , according to Equation 2. δ(1/Tm)δln[Mg2+]=ΔMg2+RΔHEquation 2 SPR experiments were performed on a BIAcore 2000 apparatus (Biacore AB, Sweden) running with the BIAcore 2.1 software. Biotinylated TAR RNA, 59 nt long, was immobilized on CM5 sensorchips coated with streptavidin according to the procedure described in the BIA applications handbook. In these conditions, 5000 resonance units (RU) of streptavidin (Sigma), equivalent to 5 ng/mm2, were immobilized on the chip which subsequently was allowed to equilibrate at 23 °C, the temperature of the in vitro selection, in the selection buffer: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, at 20 °C containing 20 mmsodium acetate, 140 mm potassium acetate, and 3 mm magnesium acetate (R buffer). Biotinylated TAR RNA (10–50 nm) was prepared in this buffer and then injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The injection was stopped as soon as 500–600 RU of bound TAR RNA was reached. This amount was shown to be appropriate to keep the pseudo-first order kinetic condition and to allow good reliability of recorded sensorgrams (RU versustime) in terms of signal to noise ratio. One noncoated or one streptavidin-coated flow-cell was used to check for nonspecific binding of RNA aptamers. The signals from these control channels served as base lines and were subtracted to the RU change observed when an injected RNA aptamer interacts with the immobilized TAR RNA. SL1 RNA, a nonrelevant hairpin from the hepatitis C virus RNA, was used as a negative control (33.Blight K.J. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7345-7352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sensorchip surface was successfully regenerated with three 5-μl pulses of 25% formamide, followed by one 5-μl pulse of distilled water and finally one 10-μl pulse of R buffer. Nonlinear regression analysis of single sensorgrams at five concentrations, at least, of injected RNAs was used to determine the kinetic parameters of the complex formation. The data were analyzed with the BIA evaluation 2.2.4 software, assuming a pseudo-first order model, according to Equations Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5, for the association and dissociation phases, respectively, where R is the signal response, R max the maximum response level,C the molar concentration of the injected RNA molecule,k on the association rate constant, andk off the dissociation rate constant. dRdt=konC(Rmax−R)−koffREquation 3 dRdt=−koffREquation 4 To check for self-consistency of data,k obs, derived from nonlinear analysis, was plotted as a function of the RNA concentration according to Equation5. kobs=konC+koffEquation 5 The RNA molecules used for this study are shown in Fig.1. MiniTAR (27 nt long), the upper half part of TAR, was shown to be the mininal domain necessary and sufficient for responsiveness in vivo (34.Jakobovits A. Smith D.H. Jakobovits E.B. Capon D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2555-2561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It interacts with the anti-TAR selected aptamers without changes in the affinity compared with the full-length TAR (35.Ducongé F. Ph.D thesis. Université Victor Segalen, Bordeaux, France1999Google Scholar). R-0624(GA) is the aptamer of highest affinity identified by in vitro selection against TAR, with the consensus motif 5′-GUCCCAGA-3′, LR-068, in the apical loop. The six central bases of the consensus sequence are complementary to the entire TAR loop. TAR* is a hairpin rationally designed to interact with TAR (32.Chang K.Y. Tinoco I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8705-8709Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Its loop is fully complementary to the TAR one. RNA I′ and RNA II′ are two structured RNAs derived from the two RNA transcripts, RNA I and RNA II, involved in the control of the ColE1 plasmid regulation. The sequences of RNA I′ and RNA II′ were modified in the stem to avoid the formation of an extended duplex, as seen with the biological RNAs once the kissing complex is formed (6.Gregorian Jr., R.S. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 968-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The derivative of UV melting curves of miniTAR with R-0624(GA) aptamer, with TAR* RNA and with LR-068 are reported in Fig.2. The melting profiles obtained with mixtures of miniTAR and R-0624(GA) RNA at two different concentrations in R′ buffer display two transitions (Fig.2 A). Only one transition is observed for the melting profiles of the RNA hairpins alone. On diluting the miniTAR and R-0624(GA) aptamer mixture 4-fold (from 2 μmto 0.5 μm), the Tm (the maximum of the derivative plots) of the lower transition decreases from 47.5 °C to 40 °C as expected for a bimolecular complex, whereas theTm of the higher transition remains unchanged and thus can be ascribed to the melting of the RNAs alone. We then compared the stability of the miniTAR and R-0624(GA) aptamer mixture to that of two reference complexes: miniTAR with either TAR* RNA or LR-068 (Fig.2 B). Under the ionic conditions used for the in vitro selection, Tm for the complex with TAR* is equal to 30.7 °C (Table I),i.e. 16.8 °C below that of the miniTAR-R-0624(GA) complex. Finally,Tm for the complex with LR-068, the 8-mer RNA 5′-GUCCCAGA-3′ consensus motif of the aptamers, is equal to 20.3 °C. Clearly, interaction of miniTAR with the aptamer gives rise to the most stable bimolecular complex. On one hand, the higher stability of the TAR-aptamer complex over that of the 8-mer RNA can be ascribed to the hairpin structure of the ligand as previously demonstrated (36.Grosjean H. Soll D.G. Crothers D. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 103: 499-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the comparison between TAR* and the selected aptamer strongly suggests that the sequence outside the loop plays a crucial role in the extra stability displayed by TAR-aptamer complexes compared with the TAR-TAR* one.Table IMelting temperature, Tm, of RNA complexes and RNAs aloneRNAT mMiniTAR-RNA complexRNA alone°C°CR-0624(GA)47.3 ± 0.370.8 ± 0.3R-0624(AG)42.8 ± 0.470.7 ± 0.7R-0624(GG)37.0 ± 0.072.3 ± 0.0R-0624(GU)32.9 ± 0.171.4 ± 0.0R-0624(AA)31.5 ± 0.665.1 ± 0.6R-0624(GC)31.4 ± 0.681.5 ± 0.0R-0624(UA)29.9 ± 0.675.3 ± 0.5R-0624(CA)21.0 ± 0.070.3 ± 0.4R-0624(CU)16.8 ± 1.173.0 ± 0.1Tar*30.7 ± 0.666.1 ± 0.8R-0616(UA)31.4 ± 0.562.9 ± 0.4LR-06820.3 ± 0.4ND aND, not determined.MiniTAR69.9 ± 0.2RNA I′-RNA II′ complexRNA I′ (GC)ND75.8 ± 0.0RNA I′ (GA)23.8 ± 0.870.0 ± 0.0RNA II′70.4 ± 0.6The experiments with miniTAR either with TAR*, the RNA aptamers or the truncated versions were performed in R′ buffer at 1 μmeach RNA, those with RNA I′ and RNAII′ in R′ buffer + 7 mm Mg2+ at 2 μm each RNA.T m is the average and standard deviation of two or three experiments.a ND, not determined.

The stability of RNA structures and complexes is well known to depend on magnesium ion. We then wanted to address the question whether the differential behavior between TAR* and the aptamer would originate in the number of associated Mg2+ ions. This can be achieved by measuring the variation of Tm as a function of the Mg2+ concentration if the enthalpy change, ΔH, for the transition is known. The enthalpy change for the formation of the complex, ΔH, was deduced from the slope of the total RNA concentration dependence of theTm (Fig. 3), according to Equation 1. In these experiments, the concentration of Mg2+ was decreased from 3 mm in R′ buffer to 1 and 0.1 mm, for the miniTAR-TAR* and miniTAR-aptamer complexes, respectively, to accurately measure theTm values of bimolecular complexes in the total RNA concentration range chosen, 0.5–16 μm, with no interference with the melting of the hairpins alone. Under these conditions, ΔH is equal to −42.8 ± 1.4 kcal/mol and −39.2 ± 1.3 kcal/mol for miniTAR-R-0624(GA) and miniTAR-TAR* complexes, respectively. The variation ofTm as a function of the Mg2+concentration is presented in Fig. 4. For both complexes, linearity of 1/Tmversus ln[Mg2+] plots indicates a site binding mode of the magnesium ion. The number of ions, ΔMg2+, which bind was deduced according to Equation 2 using the enthalpy change. This gives ΔMg2+ = 1.7 ± 0.1 and 1.4 ± 0.1 for the complexes formed with R-0624(GA) and TAR*, respectively. It demonstrates that the different stability of these complexes does not originate in a difference in the number of magnesium ions that each complex binds. From this ΔH and theTm values measured at 3 mm magnesium (Table I), the equilibrium dissociation constant,K d, in solution at 23 °C, for both complexes can be easily determined. K d, under the in vitro selection conditions, is equal to 2.0 ± 0.4 nm and 92.5 ± 5.2 nm for miniTAR-R-0624(GA) and miniTAR-TAR* complexes, respectively. Clearly, under this condition, the miniTAR-aptamer complex is more stable than the one formed with TAR*, the rationally designed RNA.Figure 4Dependence of T m on the concentration of Mg2+ for miniTAR complexes.

Linear fits were calculated according to Equation 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The base pair closing the loop was a marked difference between TAR* and the aptamer molecule. Then, in a second set of experiments, the closing GA pair was mutated to evaluate its role on the stability of the miniTAR-aptamer complex. The derivatives of the UV melting curves for complexes with three aptamer variants, namely R-0624(GA), R-0624(CU), and R-0624(AA), are presented in Fig. 5. Similar measurements have been carried out for other combinations, and Tm values for all complexes and variants alone are listed in Table I. Clearly, any change of the closing pair induces a decrease inTm that reflects a decrease in the stability of the miniTAR-aptamer complex. SPR was used to follow, in real time, the interaction of the immobilized full-length TAR RNA on streptavidin-coated sensorchip with various RNA hairpins. Sensorgrams, obtained when R-0624(GA) or TAR* analytes were injected over the sensorchip surface at two different concentrations of magnesium ion, are reported in Fig.6. In all cases, as expected for a pseudo-first order model, the dissociation phase does not show significant dependence on the concentration of the injected analyte whereas the association phase increases with it. Furthermore, these kinetics fulfill pseudo-first order conditions as checked from linearity of plots of the observed rate constant,k obs, versus the analyte concentration (insets). R-0624(GA) aptamer binds to TAR RNA at either 3 or 10 mm magnesium, as seen in Fig.6 (A and B, respectively). In contrast, whereas TAR* binds also at 10 mm (Fig. 6 D), it shows a poor affinity at 3 mm (Fig. 6 C). The rate constants, k on and k off, deduced from these sensorgrams are listed in TableII. For R-0624(GA), the on-rate changes from 6.3 × 104m−1 s−1to 17 × 104m−1s−1 upon increasing the concentration of magnesium from 3 to 10 mm. The off-rate remains constant and is equal to about 10−3s−1. For TAR*, at 3 mm magnesium, the rate constants cannot be reasonably determined. At 10 mm, k on andk off are equal to 38 × 104m−1 s−1and 5.3 × 10−3s−1, respectively. Also listed in Table II are the equilibrium dissociation constants deduced from these kinetic measurements, K d, equal tok off/k on, which confirms that the TAR-aptamer complex is much more stable in the in vitro selection buffer than the one with the rationally designed TAR* molecule, in agreement with EMSA (25.Ducongé F. Toulmé J.J. RNA. 1999; 5: 1605-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As expected, at 10 mm magnesium, i.e. the concentration used to investigate the TAR-TAR* complex (32.Chang K.Y. Tinoco I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8705-8709Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the stability of both complexes increases. The stabilizing effect observed on the complex with R-0624(GA) resides essentially in the association step, as expected for larger screening of electrostatic repulsions.Table IIEquilibrium and rate constants for TAR binding to R-0624 or TAR*BufferRNAk onk offK d(BIAcore)K d(EMSA)× 10 4 m −1 s −1× 10 −3 s −1nmnmRR-06246.3 ± 0.61.1 ± 0.117 ± 320TAR*ND aND, not determined.NDND>1000R + 7 mm Mg2+R-062417 ± 10.93 ± 0.15.4 ± 0.86TAR*38 ± 75.3 ± 0.114.5 ± 310The experiments were performed either in R buffer or in R buffer + 7 mm Mg2+.

Except for the AG inversion, which is equivalent to the wild-type aptamer in terms of stability, with a K d of about 20 nm, all other mutations have a negative effect on the stability of the TAR-RNA complex. CU and CA mutations destabilize the TAR-aptamer complex to such a degree that the rate constants cannot be determined. The effects of the other mutations are in between. Closer analysis shows that the equilibrium constant is mainly controlled by the off-rate, which increases when the complex is destabilized, whereas the on-rate shows limited variation.Table IIIEffects of mutations of the loop closing GA pair of the aptamer on equilibrium and rate constants for TAR bindingRNAk onk offK d(BIAcore)K d(EMSA)× 10 4 m −1 s −1× 10 −3 s −1nmnmR-0624(GA)6.3 ± 0.61.1 ± 0.117 ± 318 ± 2R-0624(AG)6.8 ± 0.91.5 ± 0.122 ± 232 ± 9R-0624(GG)7.9 ± 0.44.1 ± 0.152 ± 263 ± 15R-0624(GU)8.5 ± 1.49.1 ± 0.2107 ± 14133 ± 20R-0624(AA)5.7 ± 0.56.4 ± 0.1122 ± 12340 ± 80R-0624(GC)10.5 ± 0.318.5 ± 0.8167 ± 22264 ± 130R-0624(UA)6.3 ± 0.313.0 ± 0.1206 ± 1440 ± 1"

However, it is expressed constitutively in primary osteoblast cultures where it increases insulin-like growth factor I synthesis in a cAMP-dependent way. Here we show that the 3′ proximal region of the C/EBPδ gene promoter contains a binding sequence for Runt domain factor Runx2, which is essential for osteogenesis. This region of the C/EBPδ promoter directed high reporter gene expression in osteoblasts, and specifically bound Runx2 in osteoblast-derived nuclear extract. C/EBPδ gene promoter activity was reduced by mutating the Runx binding sequence or by co-transfecting with Runx2 antisense expression plasmid, and was enhanced by overexpression of Runx-2. Exposure to prostaglandin E2 increased Runx-dependent gene transactivation independently of Runx2 binding to DNA. Runx2 bound directly to the carboxyl-terminal region of C/EBPδ itself, and its ability to drive C/EBPδ expression was suppressed when C/EBPδ or its carboxyl-terminal fragment was increased by overexpression. Consistent effects also occurred on C/EBPδ-dependent increases in gene expression driven by synthetic or insulin-like growth factor I gene promoter fragments. These interactions between Runx2 and C/EBPδ, and their activation by prostaglandin E2, provide new evidence for their importance during skeletal remodeling, inflammatory bone disease, or fracture repair.

Each family member can homo- or heterodimerize, a necessary component for DNA binding and transcriptional activation. Similar to other basic leucine zipper-like factors, C/EBPs are associated with genes controlled by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) in several tissues. Notably, activation of C/EBPs can initiate downstream gene cascades related to the acute-phase response, healing, and tissue growth and remodeling (1.Wedel A. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.

The C/EBPβ gene promoter has two cAMP response element-binding protein sites near the TATA box that function in liver during regeneration or activation by PKA (17.Niehof M. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3600-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In HepG2 hepatoma cells, stimulatory effects by interleukin 6 on C/EBPδ expression involve nuclear factors termed acute-phase response element/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (APRE/STAT3) and Sp1 (16.Yamada T. Tobita K. Osada S. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18.Cantwell C.A. Sterneck E. Johnson P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2108-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, C/EBP-binding sites nearly 3000 base pairs downstream of coding DNA have been suggested to autoregulate the C/EBPδ gene (19.Yamada T. Tsuchiya T. Osada S. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We previously reported that C/EBPδ pre-exists in primary cultures of differentiated osteoblasts. When these cells are treated with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), parathyroid hormone (PTH), or other agents that increase intracellular cAMP and activate PKA, cytoplasmic C/EBPδ rapidly translocates to the nucleus. It then binds to a single cis-acting element within exon I of the gene encoding insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and enhances new IGF-I expression (11.McCarthy T.L. Ji C. Shu H. Casinghino S. Crothers K. Rotwein P. Centrella M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18132-18139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20.Thomas M.J. Umayahara Y. Shu H. Centrella M. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21835-21841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, when osteoblasts are exposed to glucocorticoid or to estrogen at concentrations that have permissive or suppressive effects on the rate of bone formation, we noted rapid changes in C/EBP synthesis and activity that significantly alter PKA-dependent effects on IGF-I expression (11.McCarthy T.L.

Differences in C/EBPδ and IGF-I expression that occur in this way parallel changes in matrix protein synthesis by bone cells, and may thereby help to determine bone integrity. Nevertheless, little is known about cis-acting elements that regulate C/EBPδ gene expression in osteoblasts. Earlier studies revealed that expression of the osteoblast phenotype occurs in concert with a nuclear transcription factor which was variously termed polyoma enhancer-binding protein 2-αA1, acute myelogenous leukemia factor (AML)-3, or core binding factor (CBF)a1 (21.Banerjee C.

These factors share a Runt homology domain sequence first defined by analogy to the Runt nuclear factor involved in body segmentation, sex determination, and neurogenesis in Drosophila. The Runt domain directs DNA binding and heterodimer formation with several other nuclear factors, including C/EBPβ, whereas the carboxyl-terminal region contains a transactivating domain that drives gene expression (24.Ogawa E.

Moreover, suppression of nuclear Runx2 protein by persistent exposure to, or high levels of glucocorticoid limits Runx-dependent gene expression in fetal rat osteoblasts (35.Chang D.J. Ji C. Kim K.K.

Studies in several cell culture models suggest a synergistic interaction between members of the C/EBP and Runt domain factor gene families. This requires proximal cis-acting elements that occur in a small number of genes, and on a physical interaction between the trans-acting nuclear factors themselves (27.Zhang D.E. Hetherington C.J.

However, based on the expression of both Runx2 and C/EBPδ in osteoblast-enriched cultures and on a detailed examination of the C/EBPδ gene promoter sequence (16.Yamada T. Tobita K. Osada S. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 36.Fukuoka T. Kitami Y. Kohara K. Hiwada K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we predicted an additional, upstream regulatory event. In this study we describe the presence of a functional Runx binding element in the C/EBPδ gene promoter and its ability to regulate C/EBPδ gene expression. We further report effects by PGE2 on Runx2 activation, direct interactions between the isoforms Runx2 and C/EBPδ, and how these events may allow discriminate control of Runx- and C/EBP-dependent gene expression in isolated osteoblasts. Osteoblast-enriched cell cultures were prepared from parietal bones of 22-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat fetuses (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Raleigh, NC) by methods approved by Yale Animal Care and Use Committee. Sutures were eliminated by dissection and cells were released by five sequential digestions with collagenase (37.McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. J. Bone Miner.

Cells from the last three digestions exhibit high levels of PTH receptors and type I collagen synthesis, an increase in osteocalcin expression in response to vitamin D3, and high alkaline phosphatase specific activity (37.McCarthy T.L.

By these criteria, differential sensitivity to transforming growth factor-β, bone morphogenic proteins, various prostaglandins, and the ability to express nuclear factor Runx2 and form mineralized nodules in vitro, osteoblast-enriched cultures are well distinguished from less differentiated periosteal cells (23.Ji C.

Inhibitory Smad7 was recently identified to antagonize TGF-β family signaling by interfering with the activation of TGF-β signal-transducing Smad complexes. To investigate whether Smad7 can regulate TGF-β-induced inhibition of lung morphogenesis, ectopic overexpression of Smad7 was introduced into embryonic mouse lungs in culture using a recombinant adenovirus containing Smad7 cDNA. Although exogenous TGF-β efficiently reduced epithelial lung branching morphogenesis in control virus-infected lung culture, TGF-β-induced branching inhibition was abolished after epithelial transfer of the Smad7 gene into lungs in culture. Smad7 also prevented TGF-β-mediated down-regulation of surfactant protein C gene expression, a marker of bronchial epithelial differentiation, in cultured embryonic lungs. Moreover, we found that Smad7 transgene expression blocked Smad2 phosphorylation induced by exogenous TGF-β ligand in lung culture, indicating that Smad7 exerts its inhibitory effect on both lung growth and epithelial cell differentiation through modulation of TGF-β pathway-restricted Smad activity. However, the above anti-TGF-β signal transduction effects were not observed in cultured embryonic lungs with Smad6 adenoviral gene transfer, suggesting that Smad7 and Smad6 differentially regulate TGF-β signaling in developing lungs. Our data therefore provide direct evidence that Smad7, but not Smad6, prevents TGF-β-mediated inhibition of both lung branching morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation, establishing the mechanistic basis for Smad7 as a novel target to ameliorate aberrant TGF-β signaling during lung development, injury, and repair.

Microbes. Infect. 1999; 1: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). TGF-β signaling occurs via ligand-initiated complex formation of a heteromeric serine-threonine kinase receptor complex, following which the TGF-β type I receptor is phosphorylated by the constitutively active TGF-β type II receptor (2Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). The activated type I receptor then propagates the signal through transient interaction with, and phosphorylation of, TGF-β pathway-restricted Smad2 and Smad3 proteins (3Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). Smad4 forms hetero-oligomeric complexes with Smad2 or Smad3 proteins, which translocate into the cell nucleus and subsequently activate transcriptional responses (4Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 5Miyazono K. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 6Wrana J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The TGF-β-signaling pathway has been implicated in the normal temporo-spatial pattern of lung morphogenesis and concomitant pulmonary-specific gene expression. Both addition of exogenous TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 to embryonic mouse lungs in culture and organ-specific overexpression of TGF-β1 in transgenic mice bearing a chimeric surfactant protein-C (SP-C) promoter-directed TGF-β1 expression construct result in hypoplastic phenotypes (7Serra R. Pelton R.W. Moses H.L. Development. 1994; 120: 2153-2161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Serra R. Moses H.L. Development. 1995; 121: 3057-3066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zhou L. Dey C.R. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), indicating that exogenous TGF-β ligands exert negative regulatory influences on lung development. On the other hand, abrogation of TGF-β type II receptor signaling, either with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides or with pulmonary epithelium-specific overexpression of dominant-negative TGF-β type II receptor, stimulates lung morphogenesis in culture and prevents TGF-β-induced inhibition of epithelial differentiation marker genes such as SP-C (10Zhao J. Bu D. Lee M. Slavkin H.C. Hall F.L. Warburton D. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 242-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 11Zhao J. Sime P.J. Bringas P. Gauldie J. Warburton D. Mech. Dev. 1998; 72: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), further supporting the conclusion that endogenous TGF-β signaling negatively regulates lung morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation. Although TGF-β signaling is an important negative modulator during lung development, aberrant expression of TGF-β has been noted in the pathogenesis of lung diseases such as lung fibrosis (12Border W.A. Noble N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1286-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (3024) Google Scholar). Prolonged overproduction of TGF-β is known to induce a chronic fibrotic lung injury in rats as well as in the bleomycin model of chronic fibrosis (13Khalil N. Whitman C. Zuo L. Danielpour D. Greenberg A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1812-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 14Sime P.J. Xing Z. Graham F.L. Csaky K.G. Gauldie J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Alveolar hypoplasia, a main sequela of neonatal hyperoxia, is also associated with high levels of TGF-β activity in premature lungs (15Blanco L.N. Frank L. Pediatr. Res. 1993; 34: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Pulmonary fibrosis is also a prominent feature of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, one of the primary causes of neonatal mortality and morbidity, and elevated concentrations of TGF-β1 have been found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of human premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (16Kotecha S. Wangoo A. Silverman M. Shaw R.J. J. Pediatr. 1996; 128: 464-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Therefore, excessive TGF-β signaling appears to adversely disrupt the orderly temporo-spatial molecular cascades that normally instruct lung growth, differentiation, and development. Recent studies have provided new understanding of how TGF-β signaling is “switched off.” Both Smad6 and Smad7 have been identified to form stable associations with the activated TGF-β type I receptor, thereby preventing the latter from binding to and activating cognate pathway-restricted Smads (17Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar, 18Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). The inhibitory Smad6 and Smad7 diverge structurally from other Smad family members by the lack of the C-terminal phosphorylation sites (4Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). The expression of inhibitory Smads are, themselves, induced by TGF-β stimulation, suggesting that the inhibitory Smads attenuate TGF-β signal transduction through an intracellular negative feedback loop (18Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). The discovery of inhibitory Smads suggests novel functional mechanisms to modulate TGF-β-mediated signal transduction during lung growth and development. We have recently shown that Smad7 gene is predominantly expressed in distal airway epithelium and that abrogation of endogenous Smad7 gene expression using a Smad7 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide increased the TGF-β-mediated negative effect on embryonic mouse lung branching morphogenesis in culture (19Zhao J. Crowe D.L. Castillo C. Wuenschell C. Chai Y. Warburton D. Mech. Dev. 2000; 93: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To test further the functional role of inhibitory Smads in developing lungs, we examined the biological effect of exogenous Smad6 and Smad7 introduced by recombinant adenoviruses into embryonic mouse lungs in serumless, chemically defined culture. Our findings demonstrated that gene transfer of Smad7 abolished TGF-β-induced inhibition of both lung branching morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation, suggesting that modulation of Smad7 expression plays an important biological role during lung organogenesis. In contrast, Smad6 overexpression in lungs failed to antagonize TGF-β-induced lung branching inhibition, indicating that Smad7 and Smad6 exert differential regulatory effects during lung morphogenesis. Smad7 thus appears to be a novel molecule to reduce excessive TGF-β signaling during lung morphogenesis, development, injury, and repair. Replication-deficient recombinant adenoviruses expressing full-length murine Smad7 (AdSmad7) and Smad6 (AdSmad6) under the control of a murine cytomegalovirus promoter were used to locally overexpress Smad7 and Smad6, respectively, in the embryonic mouse lungs. Both Smad7 and Smad6 adenovectors were generously provided by Dr. Makiko Fujii (Bethesda, MD), and the FLAG-epitope sequence was fused to the N terminus of Smad7 or Smad6 cDNA. AdSmad7 or AdSmad6 at a dose of at least 1 × 1010 plaque-forming units/ml was prepared and purified from human 293 cell line, as described previously (20He T.C. Zhou S. Da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). Timed pregnant Swiss-Webster mice were sacrificed on postcoitum day 11 (E11), and the lung primordia were isolated from embryos by micro-dissection. AdSmad7, AdSmad6, or a control vector containing no exogenous gene in phosphate-buffered saline was intratracheally micro-injected into the embryonic lung airway as we have previously reported (11Zhao J. Sime P.J. Bringas P. Gauldie J. Warburton D. Mech. Dev. 1998; 72: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). High titer adenovirus in a volume of 50 nl was used for each lung explant until the whole embryonic respiratory tract was filled with injected adenoviral solution. Injected lungs were incubated for 1 h at room temperature for viral transfection prior to culture. Adenovirus-infected lung explants were cultured under serum-free, chemically defined conditions as described previously (21Warburton D. Seth R. Shum L. Horcher P.G. Hall F.L. Werb Z. Slavkin H.C. Dev. Biol. 1992; 149: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Known concentrations of TGF-β ligand (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were added exogenously to culture medium as needed. The cultures were maintained in 100% humidity with 5% CO2 supplied for 4 days. The medium was changed every other day. Since branching morphogenesis per se is the key bioassay read-out for evaluating the functional role of Smad7 and Smad6 during early lung organogenesis, three independent measurements of branching morphogenesis were used as follows: (i) the number of airway generations from the trachea to the most distal branch of the longest visible airway; (ii) the number of air sacs visible around the periphery of the lung explants; and (iii) computerized pattern recognition analysis of the number of individual terminal respiratory units in the whole explant. These analyses were performed on whole mounts of lung explants without knowledge of the assay conditions, using transillumination to visualize structures and photomicroscopy to record permanent images. Paraffin-embedded sections of cultured lung tissue after fixation were also examined to verify the counting of terminal branching. Total RNA was extracted from cultured lung explants using guanidinium thiocyanate following homogenization as we have documented earlier (10Zhao J. Bu D. Lee M. Slavkin H.C. Hall F.L. Warburton D. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 242-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Extracted total RNA was subsequently reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The resultant cDNAs were used for competitive PCR assay. Methodology for specific pulmonary gene mRNA quantification using competitive PCR has been documented elsewhere (10Zhao J. Bu D. Lee M. Slavkin H.C. Hall F.L. Warburton D. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 242-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For Smad6, a set of primers (primers 1 and 2, Fig.1 A) was designed for mouse Smad6 to amplify a PCR product 303 bp in size (22Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J.-I. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 398: 622-626Crossref Scopus (873) Google Scholar). To generate competitor cDNA for Smad6 competitive PCR assay, the above primer sequences (primers 1 and 2) were engineered into a heterologous DNA fragment using the same strategy as we have previously described (10Zhao J. Bu D. Lee M. Slavkin H.C. Hall F.L. Warburton D. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 242-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, both the Smad6 cDNA and the Smad6 competitor share the same set of primers in the Smad6-competitive PCR amplification. The Smad6 competitor was 370 bp in length. Both Smad6 and its competitor PCR products were DNA sequenced to ensure their sequence accuracy. The same amount of Smad6 competitor was co-amplified with serial dilutions of Smad6 cDNA, and a linear relationship between initial mouse Smad6 concentration and the logarithmic ratio of Smad6 target to its competitor band intensities was obtained upon densitometric scanning of the ethidium bromide-stained gels (Fig. 1, B and C). Competitive PCR assays for other genes used in this report were developed in a similar manner as that for Smad6. Cultured embryonic lungs were lysed immediately in SDS buffer containing protease inhibitors and sodium fluoride. Equal amounts of total lung protein (50 μg) from each assayed sample were used for chemiluminescent Western analysis (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) on Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) as described (10Zhao J. Bu D. Lee M. Slavkin H.C. Hall F.L. Warburton D. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 242-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed using antibodies against mouse Smad2 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), phosphorylated Smad2 (a gift from Dr. Carl-Henrik Heldin, Uppsala, Sweden), and β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at recommended dilutions (18Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). An anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was purchased to detect adenoviral transgene expression in cultured lungs using procedures suggested by the manufacturer. Cultured mouse lungs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 3 h at room temperature and immediately embedded into paraffin. Lung tissues were prepared into 5-μm thick sections on HistoGrip-coated microscopic slides (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). The expression of exogenous Smad7 or Smad6 transgene derived from the adenoviral vector was assessed by immunohistochemical staining, using a goat polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and normal goat IgG (negative control) as described previously (11Zhao J. Sime P.J. Bringas P. Gauldie J. Warburton D. Mech. Dev. 1998; 72: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The data in the present study were expressed as mean ± S.D., and the significance of variances between means was evaluated by Student's t test. p values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. To evaluate the biological function of inhibitory Smads during early lung development, we began our study by assessing the AdSmad7 and AdSmad6 for their ability to overexpress the corresponding transgenes in embryonic mouse lungs in culture. E11 mouse lungs were cultured for 4 days as described under “Materials and Methods” following intratracheal micro-injection of AdSmad7, AdSmad6, or a control virus that contains no exogenous genes. Cultured lung explants were harvested for RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and subsequent competitive PCR quantification of specific mRNA amounts. As shown in competitive PCR electrophoretic patterns (Fig.2 A), only lungs micro-injected with AdSmad7, not with control virus, displayed an elevated level of Smad7 mRNA transgene expression. However, endogenous mRNA levels of both Smad6 and Smad3 were not changed by AdSmad7 infection into embryonic lungs. Likewise, AdSmad6 infection increased Smad6 mRNA expression in cultured lungs in comparison to control virus-infected lung explants, whereas both endogenous mRNA amounts of Smad7 and Smad3 were unaffected (Fig. 2 A). Quantitative analysis following densitometric scanning of competitive PCR electrophoretic patterns demonstrated a 25- and a 21-fold overexpression (p < 0.05) of the respective Smad7 and Smad6 transgene mRNAs, when embryonic mouse lungs were micro-injected with either AdSmad7 or AdSmad6 (Fig. 2 B). Significant overexpression of exogenous Smad7 and Smad6 protein was detected in the cultured lungs following administration of respective AdSmad7 and AdSmad6, as shown in Western blot analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3 A). FLAG immunoreactivity was absent in media control lungs. We have previously demonstrated that adenovirus-mediated gene transfer resulted in epithelium-specific transgene expression in cultured mouse lungs (11Zhao J. Sime P.J. Bringas P. Gauldie J. Warburton D. Mech. Dev. 1998; 72: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Hence, to localize Smad7 or Smad6 transgene expression in embryonic lungs micro-injected with AdSmad7 or AdSmad6, immunohistochemistry was performed on cultured lung specimens using an anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (Fig. 3 B). The staining of exogenous transgene protein was exclusively found in the lung epithelial cells in either AdSmad7 or AdSmad6 micro-injected lungs (Fig. 3 B, a for AdSmad7 and b for AdSmad6), whereas mesenchymal cells were free of transgene protein expression. The FLAG staining was also absent in both media control (Fig. 3 B, c) and control virus-injected (not shown) lung tissues. Immunocytochemistry using control goat IgG yielded negligible background staining (data not shown). We thus established an experimental system to successfully overexpress Smad7 and Smad6 genes, at both mRNA and protein levels, using intratracheal micro-injection of respective AdSmad7 and AdSmad6, in embryonic mouse lungs in culture. By having demonstrated the ability of the AdSmad7 or AdSmad6 to overexpress recombinant Smad7 or Smad6 transgene in the embryonic lungs in culture, we sought to determine whether overexpression of the exogenous inhibitory Smad gene could regulate TGF-β-induced lung branching inhibition in embryonic mouse lungs in culture. Embryonic murine lungs (E11) spontaneously underwent extensive morphogenesis in chemically defined, serum-free culture to develop into a characteristic branching pattern (Fig.4 A, a and b). As we have previously shown (10Zhao J. Bu D. Lee M. Slavkin H.C. Hall F.L. Warburton D. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 242-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), TGF-β ligands inhibited lung branching morphogenesis in culture as quantified by the number of terminal sacs, resulting in a hypoplastic phenotype. In the current study, addition of TGF-β1 ligand (10 ng/ml) decreased embryonic mouse lung branching morphogenesis in culture in lungs micro-injected with the control virus (Fig. 4 A, c and d). However, exogenously added TGF-β1 failed to inhibit lung branching in AdSmad7 micro-injected lungs (Fig. 4 A, e), in comparison to control virus micro-injected lungs (d). In contrast, embryonic lungs overexpressing Smad6 could not prevent TGF-β1-mediated inhibition of lung branching morphogenesis (Fig.4 A, f). Quantitative analysis of lung branching morphogenesis showed that Smad7, but not Smad6, could reverse TGF-β-mediated inhibition of lung growth in culture. As shown in Fig. 4 B, whereas addition of TGF-β1 ligand inhibited lung branching in either media control or control virus-infected lungs, embryonic lungs overexpressing Smad7 using AdSmad7 micro-injection prevented TGF-β1-mediated lung branching inhibition. In lungs micro-injected with AdSmad7, TGF-β1 at a dose of 10 ng/ml did not reduce lung branching (103% of media control), whereas TGF-β1 of the same dose significantly decreased lung morphogenesis in either media control (65% of media control,p < 0.05) or control virus-treated (68% of media control, p < 0.05) lungs. However, the above resistance to TGF-β1-induced lung branching inhibition was not observed when AdSmad6 replaced AdSmad7 for micro-injection into embryonic mouse lungs; TGF-β1 exerted an inhibitory effect on lung morphogenesis regardless of the micro-injection of AdSmad6 (79% of media control, p < 0.05). Our findings therefore demonstrated that only Smad7, but not Smad6, overexpression in lung epithelium rendered embryonic lungs refractoriness to the TGF-β-mediated negative regulation of lung branching morphogenesis in culture. To analyze further the molecular mechanism by which Smad7 transgene expression abolished the TGF-β-mediated inhibitory effect on pulmonary morphogenesis during early lung development, embryonic mouse lungs were cultured in the presence of TGF-β ligand following micro-injection of control virus, AdSmad7, or AdSmad6. Phosphorylation of Smad2 by the activated TGF-β1 type I receptor kinase has been shown to relay the transduction of TGF-β1 signal from cell membrane to nucleus (18Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar, 23Macı́as-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Smad7 associates stably with the activated TGF-β receptor complex and interferes with the activation of intracellular Smad2 by preventing its receptor binding and phosphorylation, thereby antagonizing TGF-β signaling (17Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D.

Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether expression of Smad7 or Smad6 transgene could impact on the phosphorylation of TGF-β signaling permissive Smad2 in the cultured embryonic lungs. By using an antibody against phosphorylated Smad2 in Western blot analysis, phosphorylation level of Smad2 was found to be increased with the addition of TGF-β1 ligand in media control lungs (Fig.5). However, such a TGF-β1-induced up-regulation of Smad2 phosphorylation was attenuated in AdSmad7-infected lungs overexpressing Smad7, regardless of the presence of TGF-β1 in culture, whereas Smad6 gene transfer into lungs did not affect the stimulatory effect of TGF-β1 on Smad2 phosphorylation in the mouse lungs culture (Fig. 5). The above observation that the expression of exogenous Smad7, but not Smad6, blocked TGF-β1-activated Smad2 phosphorylation in cultured embryonic lungs indicates that only Smad7 overexpression could antagonize TGF-β signaling during early lung branching morphogenesis. Therefore, Smad7 and Smad6 seem to exhibit differential regulatory effects on TGF-β signaling during early lung branching morphogenesis. The biological function of inhibitory Smads was also examined for their role on pulmonary cytodifferentiation during early lung morphogenesis. Gene expression of surfactant proteins is well characterized to be inhibited by TGF-β signaling during embryonic lung development. Since surfactant proteins were primarily expressed in lung epithelium during embryonic lung growth, SP-C was used as a lung epithelium-specific differentiation marker gene to evaluate the role of Smad7 versus Smad6 during early lung growth and cytodifferentiation. When added exogenously to the culture medium, TGF-β1 repressed epithelial SP-C gene expression in media control lungs (data not shown) and in lungs infected with control virus (Fig. 6), as shown by the competitive PCR electrophoretic pattern for SP-C mRNA measurement. However, exogenous TGF-β1 no longer down-regulated epithelial SP-C mRNA expression when lungs were epithelially infected with AdSmad7. In comparison, epithelium-specific overexpression of Smad6 failed to reverse TGF-β1-induced negative regulation of SP-C gene expression in culture embryonic lungs (Fig. 6). Therefore, only Smad7, but not Smad6, transgene expression prevents the embryonic lungs in culture from TGF-β-mediated inhibition of both lung branching morphogenesis and epithelial differentiation. In the present study, we showed that transient gene transfer and expression of Smad7, but not Smad6, introduced by intratracheal micro-injection of replication-defective recombinant adenoviral vector into the embryonic mouse lungs in culture, prevented TGF-β-mediated inhibition of both lung growth and cytodifferentiation, as demonstrated by lung terminal branching morphogenesis and gene expression of epithelial SP-C. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the overexpression of Smad7 alone in lung epithelium is sufficient to block the TGF-β-mediated inhibition of lung epithelial branching and differentiation. We also provided direct evidence that exogenous Smad7 may exert its anti-TGF-β signaling effect in cultured embryonic lungs by the blockade of Smad2 phosphorylation, the pivotal step for the transduction of TGF-β signal from extracellular membrane to nucleus. Since the binding of Smad2 to activated TGF-β type I receptor is required for the Smad2 phosphorylation, it is likely that Smad7 antagonizes TGF-β signal transduction through interfering with the association of Smad2 to its cognate receptor complex during lung morphogenesis. Vertebrate Smad6 and Smad7 and Drosophila Dad are inhibitors of signaling by receptor-activated Smads (17Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N.

Dad inhibits Dpp signaling in Drosophila wing imaginal discs, and when introduced into frog embryos, Dad exhibits anti-BMP effects (25Tsuneizumi K. Nakayama T. Kamoshida Y. Kornberg T.B. Christian J.L. Tabata T. Nature. 1997; 389: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Inhibitory Smads participate in negative feedback loops that may regulate the intensity or duration of TGF-β responses. Thus, Smad7 expression is rapidly elevated in response to TGF-β, whereas Dad expression is increased in response to Dpp (18Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S.

Tabata T. Nature. 1997; 389: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). However, the biological function of Smad7 during early embryogenesis has not been defined yet. Our findings suggested that Smad7 plays a functional role as an antagonist of TGF-β signaling during embryonic mouse lung branching morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation. Although both Smad7 and Smad6 are implicated in the negative modulation of the TGF-β superfamily signaling, we found, in the current investigation, that Smad7 and Smad6 displayed differential inhibitory effects on both lung morphogenesis and epithelial cell differentiation. In comparison to Smad7, Smad6 did not affect TGF-β-mediated negative regulation of lung growth and development in mice. Although Smad6 was originally identified as an inhibitor of signaling by the TGF-β superfamily (22Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J.-I. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 398: 622-626Crossref Scopus (873) Google Scholar), recent studies indicate that Smad6 preferentially attenuates signaling of BMPs (26Itoh S. Landstrom M. Hermansson A. Itoh F.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Smad6 has been shown to bind to BMP receptors, inhibit signaling downstream of the BMP receptors (22Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J.-I. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 398: 622-626Crossref Scopus (873) Google Scholar), and prevent formation of an active Smad1/Smad4 signaling complex by directly competing with Smad1 for binding to Smad4 (27Hata A. Lagna G. Massagué J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Mouse Smad6 promoter was identified to contain BMP-responsive elements, and the expression of Smad6 is enhanced by the effects of BMP-activated Smad1/5 on the Smad6 promoter (28Ishida W. Hamamoto T. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K. Sampath T, K. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6075-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Therefore, the above findings are consistent with our observation in lung culture that TGF-β signaling activity is inert to the regulation by Smad6 gene. Signaling by peptide growth factors plays a critical role in lung morphogenesis, determining the rate of cell proliferation and differentiation, activation or repression of downstream transcriptional factors, and synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. TGF-β is a known negative regulator in developing lungs. TGF-β ligands have been shown to exert an inhibitory effect on lung branching morphogenesis and simultaneously suppress surfactant protein gene expression in pulmonary epithelium, in both in vivo animal models and ex vivo lung organ cultures (7Serra R. Pelton R.W. Moses H.L. Development. 1994; 120: 2153-2161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zhou L. Dey C.R. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 10Zhao J. Bu D. Lee M. Slavkin H.C. Hall F.L. Warburton D. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 242-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our previous study demonstrated that abrogation of endogenous Smad2 and Smad3 using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides results in a stimulatory phenotype for branching morphogenesis of early murine embryonic lungs in culture (29Zhao J. Lee M. Smith S. Warburton D. Dev. Biol. 1998; 194: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), similar to that obtained after abrogation of TGF-β type II receptor signaling (10Zhao J. Bu D. Lee M. Slavkin H.C. Hall F.L. Warburton D. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 242-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the present report, we show that overexpression of Smad7 prevents exogenous TGF-β-induced Smad2 phosphorylation in developing lungs in culture, indicating a lack of association between Smad2 and TGF-β type I receptor in the presence of Smad7. Taken together, it is suggested that Smad7 exerts its biological effects on both lung branching and differentiation through attenuation of TGF-β signal transduction, probably by competing with Smad2 for TGF-β receptor binding. Elevated TGF-β signaling appears to be a characteristic feature of fibrotic diseases including hepatic cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and glomerular sclerosis (30Branton M.H. Kopp J.B. Microbes. Infect. 1999; 1: 1349-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Aberrant expression of TGF-β signaling, occurring during lung disease and injury, could perturb finely regulated TGF-β-mediated molecular cascades, resulting in abnormalities of lung growth, differentiation, and development (12Border W.A. Noble N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1286-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (3024) Google Scholar). Expression of Smad7 ameliorated bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice by preventing the increased production of type I pre-collagen mRNA and hydroxyproline content (31Nakao A. Fujii M. Matsumura R. Kumano K. Saito Y. Miyazono K. Iwamoto I. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). By using embryonic mouse lung explant culture, we found that Smad7 gene transfer attenuated TGF-β signaling in developing lungs, reversing TGF-β-mediated inhibition of both epithelial branching and SP-C gene expression. Therefore, Smad7 expression in the lung offers a novel rationale for therapeutic intervention that may be useful in treating lung diseases associated with TGF-β overproduction. Smad7 itself is induced by TGF-β stimulation, suggesting that Smad7 regulates TGF-β signaling in a negative feedback fashion (4Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 32Ishisaki A. Yamato K. Nakao A. Nonaka K. Ohguchi M. ten Dijke P. Nishihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24293-24296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have revealed that Smad7 may be activated by other signaling pathways. TGF-β and interferon-γ have opposite effects on diverse cellular functions (33Letterio J.L. Roberts A.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 137-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). Acting through Jak1 and Stat1, interferon-γ induces the expression of Smad7, which prevents TGF-β receptor from interaction with and phosphorylation of the intracellular Smad3 (34Ulloa L. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Likewise, tumor necrosis factor-α/NF-κB was found to antagonize TGF-β signaling through up-regulation of Smad7 synthesis and induction of stable associations between ligand-activated TGF-β receptors and inhibitory Smad7 (35Bitzer M. von Gersdorff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Böttinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, recent experimental evidences have demonstrated that permissive Smads synergize with members of other transcription factor families including FAST-1, -2, AP-1, and p300, in the regulation of downstream gene expression, indicating the versatility of Smad signaling system (36Massagué J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, Smad7 may not only be responsive to TGF-β signaling but also may act as a potential signaling integrator that could play a key role in the interplay of different signaling pathways. However, the precise role of Smad7 as a signal integrator during lung development remains to be explored. In the current analysis, we used an adenovector-mediated gene transfer strategy to achieve overexpression of Smad7 during embryonic lung morphogenesis. Intratracheal micro-injection of recombinant adenovirus to introduce transgene expression has proven to be both effective and efficient (11Zhao J. Sime P.J. Bringas P. Gauldie J. Warburton D. Mech. Dev. 1998; 72: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The replication-deficient adenovirus has a wide spectrum of host cell range, including cells in both active and quiescent states (37Baldwin H.S. Mickanin C. Buck C. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The recombinant adenoviruses used herein are incapable of integrating into the host genome and thus have minimum impact on intrinsic host cell function. By using both Smad6 and Smad7 adenoviruses, we have shown the feasibility of achieving high transgene expression specifically in lung epithelial cells during embryonic lung growth and development. Our data therefore support the hypothesis that Smad7, as an intracellular antagonist of TGF-β pathway, may be potentially applicable as a target in designing novel strategies to treat lung diseases and injuries due to excessive TGF-β signaling. In summary, we have demonstrated that transient gene transfer and expression of exogenous Smad7 and Smad6 into the lung epithelium by adenovectors differentially modulated TGF-β-induced inhibition of both lung branching morphogenesis and epithelial cell differentiation. Smad7, but not Smad6, may antagonize TGF-β signaling in the developing lungs though blockade of TGF-β receptor-activated Smad2 phosphorylation. Smad7 thus appears to be an important biological regulator that optimizes TGF-β signaling during lung growth and development, and Smad7 could be a potentially useful molecular target in designing new rational therapeutic strategies to ameliorate lung injuries due to abnormal TGF-β signal transduction."

Tammar WAP (tWAP) was isolated by reverse-phase HPLC and migrates in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 29.9 kDa. tWAP is the major whey protein, but in contrast to eutherians, secretion is asynchronous and occurs only from approximately days 130 through 240 of lactation.

Analysis of the amino acid sequence suggests the protein belongs to a family of protease inhibitors; however, the predicted active site of these domains is dissimilar to the confirmed active site for known protease inhibitors. This suggests that any putative protease ligand may be unique to either the mammary gland, milk, or gut of the pouch young.

Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The WAP proteins from all species show limited sequence identity at the amino acid level but are recognized by a two-domain structure, known as the four-disulfide core (4-DSC) (6Ranganathan S. Simpson K.J. Shaw D.C. Nicholas K.R. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2000; 17: 106-113Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar) domain, which comprises eight cysteine residues in a conserved arrangement (1Hennighausen L.H. Sippel A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 2677-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The 4-DSC domain arrangement is not exclusive to the WAP family of proteins; numerous other proteins have been identified that contain one or two such domains. Although a large biological diversity exists between these proteins, many have been identified as protease inhibitors and are grouped into families based on their functionality and tissue-specific origins. These families include the antileukoproteinase (ALKI) family (7Heinzel R. Appelhans H. Gassen G. Seemuller U. Machleidt W. Fritz H. Steffens G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), epididymal (8Kirchhoff C. Habben I. Ivell R. Krull N. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 14791-14795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given such a variety of proteins, it is thought that the 4-DSC may be a preferential conformation for the stable folding and action of a particular class of protease inhibitors (6Ranganathan S. Simpson K.J. Shaw D.C. Nicholas K.R. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2000; 17: 106-113Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 11Larsen M. Ressler S.J. Lu B. Gerdes M.J. McBrides L. Dang T.D. Rowley D.R. J. Biol.

Despite no biological action or function being demonstrated for the WAP proteins and based on the limited sequence identity with known protease inhibitors, it has been postulated that WAP may be a protease inhibitor (6Ranganathan S.

Wilde C.J. Bird P.H. Hendry K.A.K. Tregenza K. Warner B. Intercellular Signalling in the Mammary Gland. Plenum Press, New York1995Google Scholar) that WAP is present in the milk of a marsupial, the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii), and preliminary data showed the secretion of this protein was developmentally regulated during the lactation cycle. The tammar wallaby is widely used as a model to study marsupial development, and as a result its reproduction cycle has been well defined (14Tyndale-Biscoe C.H. Janssens P.A. The Developing Marsupial. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg1988Crossref Google Scholar, 15Nicholas K.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This species has adopted a comparatively different reproductive strategy to other eutherians, i.e. a short gestation and birth of an immature young followed by a relatively long lactation (14Tyndale-Biscoe C.H. Janssens P.A. The Developing Marsupial. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg1988Crossref Google Scholar, 15Nicholas K.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Milk is the only nutritional source available to the rapidly developing pouch young until it has reached physiological maturity and is able to move outside the pouch and eat herbage (14Tyndale-Biscoe C.H. Janssens P.A. The Developing Marsupial. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg1988Crossref Google Scholar). The composition of the milk is complex, and it changes during the lactation cycle to meet the nutritional demands of the pouch young. The lactation cycle in the tammar has been divided into four distinct phases (17Nicholas K. Simpson K. Wilson M. Trott J. Shaw D. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1997; 2: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which are characterized by both changes in milk composition and changes in the sucking pattern of the pouch young. Phase 1 comprises the 26.5-day gestation period during which time all four mammary glands prepare for parturition and the onset of lactogenesis (18Findlay L. J. Reprod.

At parturition, a single immature young climbs into the pouch and attaches to one of the four available teats, and remains permanently attached to this teat for the next 100–120 days (phase 2A (17Nicholas K. Simpson K. Wilson M. Trott J. Shaw D. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1997; 2: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)), receiving a limited volume of milk that is low in fat and protein but high in complex carbohydrates (19Green B. Symp. Zool. Soc. Lond. 1984; 51: 369-387Google Scholar, 15Nicholas K.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). At the onset of phase 2B at around days 100–120, the pouch young relinquishes the teat but remains in the pouch for a further 80–100 days. During phase 2A and 2B the rate of growth is slow, with a large component of the milk nutrients utilized for development of physiological functions (14Tyndale-Biscoe C.H. Janssens P.A. The Developing Marsupial. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg1988Crossref Google Scholar). The commencement of phase 3 (day 200) is characterized by an increase in milk production and size of the mammary gland, together with the secretion of a more concentrated milk, which is high in lipid and protein and low in carbohydrate (19Green B. Symp. Zool. Soc. Lond. 1984; 51: 369-387Google Scholar, 15Nicholas K.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The growth rate of the pouch young accelerates, and at approximately day 250 it permanently leaves the pouch, adopting a diet of milk and herbage, until weaning at 300–350 days postpartum (19Green B. Symp. Zool. Soc. Lond. 1984; 51: 369-387Google Scholar, 15Nicholas K.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We report here for the first time the isolation and purification of WAP from a marsupial, the tammar wallaby, and show that gene expression is developmentally regulated throughout the lactation cycle and appears potentially controlled by a novel signaling mechanism intrinsic to the mammary gland. The structure of tWAP does not conform to the two-domain structure described for WAPs from all other species. A consensus three-dimensional structural model for the two-domain eutherian WAP proteins was developed recently, with a detailed atomic model created for pig WAP (pWAP (6Ranganathan S. Simpson K.J. Shaw D.C. Nicholas K.R. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2000; 17: 106-113Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar)). This paper reports an analogous three-domain structural model for tWAP, and together with the unique profile for developmentally regulated expression of the gene for tWAP, provides new opportunities to examine the role of this protein during lactation. All tissue culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Ovine prolactin (NIH-oPRL-16) was provided by National Hormone and Pitvitary Program, University of Maryland, School of Medicine (Baltimore, MD). Bovine insulin, hydrocortisone, tri-iodothyronine, and estradiol were purchased from Sigma. Tammars were maintained on site at the Victorian Institute of Animal Science in a natural habitat with access to water and feed supplements ad libitum. Acidified whey from various stages of lactation was fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (5Simpson K.J. Bird P. Shaw D. Nicholas K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) using a POROS R2/H reverse-phase column and a 15–60% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The absorbance of proteins eluting from the column was measured at both 215 and 280 nm, and fractions were dried under vacuum and stored at 4 °C. Proteins were resuspended in distilled water, analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and identified by N-terminal amino acid sequencing using a Procise 494 protein sequencer. Whole milk was collected from tammar wallabies (15Nicholas K.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) at various stages throughout lactation. Skim milk was separated from fat and cell debris by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the casein fractions were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 12 °C. Diluted whey samples were separated in 20% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. An amplified cDNA library made from RNA from tammar wallaby mammary gland at day 201 of lactation cloned in the EcoRI site of phage gt-11 was grown in log phase Y1090 culture (including tetracycline selection (12.5 μg/ml), maltose (0.2% v/v), and MgSO4 (10 mm)). Plaques (40,000) were screened with an end-labeled degenerate antisense oligonucleotide designed to known tWAP amino acid sequence (residues 24–31; tWAP 1, 5′-GCRTCRTTRCANAARYTGYTTRCA-3′). Four plaques were analyzed through secondary and tertiary screens, the lambda DNA was digested with EcoRI, and the insert fragment was cloned into the pGEM-7 vector (Promega). The clone was sequenced from both directions using T7 and SP6 primers and dye terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems). Total RNA was extracted (21Chomczynski P. Qasba P. Topper Y.J. Science. 1984; 226: 1326-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) from the mammary glands of each of three lactating tammars at intervals from day 95 to day 276 of lactation. Each sample (10 μg) was fractionated through a 1.4% agarose formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Zeta Probe GT membrane (Bio-Rad). The tWAPand tammar β-lactoglobulin (β-LG) cDNAs were hybridized with the membranes (5Simpson K.J. Bird P. Shaw D. Nicholas K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), washed at 60 °C to high stringency (0.1% SSC/0.1% SDS), and exposed to Kodak Xomat film at −70 °C. The tWAP mRNA levels were quantitated by slot blot analysis (22Collet C. Joseph R. Nicholas K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 6: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The membranes were hybridized with the tWAP cDNA and washed to high stringency, and each individual slot was excised and placed into 5 ml of organic scintillant. The radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation spectrophotometer (Wallac 1410, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar), phase 2B (day 180), and phase 3 (day 260) of lactation were cut into explants of approximately 1–2 mg and cultured on floating siliconized lens paper in media 199 (M199) supplemented with the indicated combinations of bovine insulin (I, 1 μg/ml), cortisol (F, 0.05 μg/ml), ovine prolactin (P, 0.2 μg/ml), tri-iodothyronine (T3, 6.5 pg/ml), and estradiol (E2, 1 pg/ml). Media was changed daily. Mammary tissue was collected for analysis prior to culture (T0), and explants from two dishes (approximately 40 explants) were collected and pooled for each treatment after 4, 8, and 12 days of culture. Total RNA was extracted from the tissue using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and fractionated through a 1.4% agarose formaldehyde gel, transferred to Zeta Probe GT membrane, and hybridized with the tWAP and β-LG cDNAs using the conditions described previously. The WAP sequences were aligned with other 4-DSC protein sequences initially using Clustal-W. However, due to the limited sequence identity, the alignment was edited visually to align the eight cysteine residues of each domain. The mature tWAP sequence was aligned with the sequence of recombinant human secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor (hSLPI), which has been shown to contain two 4-DSC domains (24Grutter M.G. Fendrich G. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The program Modeller (25Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) was used to generate the tWAP structure, specifying the formation of four disulfide bridges in each domain, and subjecting the model to iterative molecular dynamics refinement using built-in simulated annealing protocols (6Ranganathan S. Simpson K.J. Shaw D.C. Nicholas K.R. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2000; 17: 106-113Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). HPLC fractionation of tammar whey collected at 14- to 21-day intervals from days 88 to 270 of lactation resulted in an average of 10 major protein peaks, depending on the stage of lactation (Fig. 1). Examination of eluates at an absorbance of 215 nm showed that several peaks either appeared or disappeared from the milk at specific times during the course of lactation. Peaks 2 and 3 were first detected at approximately day 116, reaching a maximum around day 193 (Fig. 1) and then reducing to undetectable levels by day 256 of lactation (data not shown). The protein component of these peaks, eluting as a doublet at 29.5% and 30.6% acetonitrile (Fig. 1), was subjected to tryptic digestion and N-terminal amino acid sequencing and revealed 46 residues, which shared significant sequence identity with camel WAP (cWAP). The protein obtained from peak 2 at day 193 of lactation was analyzed by 20% SDS-PAGE and showed tWAP migrated as a major protein at 29.9 kDa (Fig. 1, inset). SDS-PAGE analysis of total whey from day 140 to 276 of lactation showed the asynchronous changes in milk composition at the transition from phase 2B to phase 3 (Fig. 2). tWAP was a major whey protein at day 202 of lactation and was undetectable in phase 3 whey. Both β-LG (18 kDa) and α-lactalbumin (α-lac; 14 kDa) were secreted throughout lactation, whereas the secretion of late lactation protein A (LLP-A; 24 kDa) and LLP-B (21 kDa) was induced around days 180 and 220 respectively, signaling the transition to phase 3 of lactation (17Nicholas K. Simpson K. Wilson M. Trott J. Shaw D. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1997; 2: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A degenerate antisense oligonucleotide designed to the known tWAP peptide sequence was used to screen a cDNA library prepared from mammary gland RNA from day 201 of lactation. The clone isolated from the cDNA library was 724 base pairs (bp) and represented a full-length cDNA coding for 191 translated amino acids (GenBank™ accession number AJ005356). The translated sequence was identical to the N-terminal sequence obtained from the protein in peak 2. The cDNA contains a 23-bp 5′-untranslated region, 18-amino acid signal peptide, and 2 stop codons that are in-frame and positioned 10 amino acid residues apart (Fig.3). The polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) is situated at nucleotide position 695, and the clone contains a further 24 bp of 3′-untranslated region but does not contain the poly(A) tail (Fig. 3). The translated sequence revealed that the tWAP gene consists of three 4-DSC domains and not the two domains reported for the eutherian WAP proteins (Figs. 3 and4). The three domains of tWAP have been ordered consecutively as domains III, I, and II (Fig. 3), with domains I and II being conserved within other species (Fig. 4).Figure 4Alignment of tWAP with all WAPs and selected protease inhibitors.

The site for potential O-linked glycosylation is indicated by double lines. Gaps were introduced for maximal alignment of amino acids. Proteins were truncated at the N terminus to begin the alignment at the WAP motif for either the first or second domain.

Each domain includes eight cysteine residues, recognized by the consensus pattern: Cys1-(Xn)-Cys2-(Xn)-Cys3-(X 5)-Cys4-(X 5)-Cys5Cys6-(X 3,X 5)-Cys7-(X 3,X 4)-Cys8(6Ranganathan S. Simpson K.J. Shaw D.C. Nicholas K.R. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2000; 17: 106-113Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Domain II is more conserved than domain I in all proteins. At the amino acid level, tWAP shares 22.9% sequence identity with mouse WAP (mWAP), 25.4% with rat WAP, 25.1% with rabbit WAP, 25.5% with cWAP and 26.6% with pWAP (Fig. 4). Limited N-terminal sequence was also available for putative WAPs from platypus (platWAP) 2D. Shaw, personal communication. and echidna (26Teahan C.G. McKenzie H.A. Griffiths M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1991; 99B: 99-118Google Scholar), and these have been aligned with domain III of tWAP based on sequence identity. tWAP shares 34% identity over the first 37 amino acids with platWAP and 41% with echidna WAP over the first 51 amino acids. In addition to the conserved cysteine residues, several proline, lysine, glutamic acid, and glycine residues are conserved at the same position in each domain (5Simpson K.J. Bird P. Shaw D. Nicholas K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 6Ranganathan S. Simpson K.J. Shaw D.C. Nicholas K.R. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2000; 17: 106-113Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar), including tWAP domain III (Fig. 4). An interesting feature of the WAP proteins is a conserved WAP motif of seven amino acids, KAGRCPW, which is present in the mouse, rat, rabbit, camel, and pig and is located at the start of domain II and includes the first cysteine residue of the domain (5Simpson K.J. Bird P. Shaw D. Nicholas K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In all protease inhibitors with one or two domains, the motif is also present at the beginning of each domain, however, it is less conserved, resulting in a consensus sequence of KXGXCP (Figs. 4 and 6). This consensus motif is present at three locations in tWAP and is situated at the beginning of each domain and includes the first cysteine residue of that domain (Fig. 4). Similarly, the motif is also present in the putative domain III of the echidna and platypus WAP. Examination of the amino acid sequence of tWAP revealed one potential site for N-linked glycosylation, characterized by the sequence Asp-X-(Ser/Thr), where X is not a proline (27Williams K. Redmond J. Pisano A. Gooley A. Today's Life Sci. 1992; 4: 50-60Google Scholar). This occurs at positions 69–71, residues Asp-Thr-Thr, located near the end of domain III (Fig. 3). There are no potentialN-linked glycosylation sites present in any of the other WAP proteins (Figs. 4 and 6). The consecutive series of serine residues in domain I of the WAP proteins is not conserved in domain I of other protease inhibitors (Figs. 4 and 6) and may represent a potential site for O-linked glycosylation (28Van den Steen P. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 151-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) for some WAP sequences. The structures of domains I and II of tWAP were created by homology modeling, based on alignment of tWAP with the corresponding domains of hSLPI. Domain-wise structure comparison resulted in a root mean square deviation of 0.47 Å over 33 Cα pairs (68%) for domain I and 1.06 Å over 45 Cα pairs (99%) for domain II. tWAP domain III shares greater sequence identity with hSLPI domain I (36.7% compared with 27.1% with hSLPI domain II) and was thus modeled from the structure of hSLPI domain I, with a root mean square deviation of 0.83 Å over 44 Cα pairs (92%). Of the three domains of tWAP, domain II is most similar to the template structure, with spatial conservation of all four disulfide bridges. The second disulfide bridge of domains I and III of tWAP is displaced about 30° toward the C terminus of the protein, as observed in the case of both pWAP domains. Despite the domain-wise structural similarity, there is considerable rearrangement of the packing of the three domains into a quaternary structure, compared with both the hSLPI structure and the pWAP model (6Ranganathan S. Simpson K.J. Shaw D.C. Nicholas K.R. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2000; 17: 106-113Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This rearrangement is a consequence of fewer “interdomain” residues (defined as the number of amino acids between the last cysteine of one domain and the first cysteine of the next domain) in tWAP (10 each) compared with hSLPI (16Renfree M.B. Marshall's Physiology of Reproduction. 4th Ed. 3. Chapman and Hall, London1994Google Scholar) and pWAP (13Nicholas K.R. Wilde C.J. Bird P.H. Hendry K.A.K. Tregenza K. Warner B.

Model. 2000; 17: 106-113Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The two domains of hSLPI are oriented at 150o to each other, with a translation of 16.4 Å (based on the structure comparison method of Reference 29May A.C.W. Johnson M.S. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas the three tWAP domains are at about 120o with a translation of 9.5 Å between domains I and II and 12.7 Å between domains III and I.

Fendrich G. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The coordinates of the model structure are available from the Protein Data Bank (PDB code: 1TWP). The two domains of hSLPI are capable of independent function, inhibiting trypsin and chymotrypsin, respectively (24Grutter M.G. Fendrich G. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The scissile bonds for hSLPI domain I are residues RY (residues 20 and 21) and for domain II are LM (residues 72 and 73) (24Grutter M.G. Fendrich G. Huber R. Bode W.

The CAK complex, which is also found free in the cell, is composed of cdk7, cyclin H, and MAT1. In the present work, we found that the C terminus of MAT1 binds to the cdk7·cyclin H complex and activates the cdk7 kinase activity. The median portion of MAT1, which contains a coiled-coil motif, allows the binding of CAK to the TFIIH core through interactions with both XPD and XPB helicases.

Some members of this protein kinase family are involved not only in cell cycle control but also in other mechanisms that govern cell life, notably transcription. Cdk activities are regulated by several different processes including the binding of an activating cyclin subunit, their phosphorylation, and the association of cdk inhibitors or other stimulatory factors (1Pavletich N.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). One of them, cdk7, was originally identified as the catalytic subunit of the cdk-activating kinase (CAK) complex that is able to phosphorylate, and thereby activate, several cdks (2Kaldis P. Cell.

Furthermore, the Srb10·Srb11 complex (the yeast counterpart of cdk8·cyclin C) phosphorylates the CTD in vivo prior to the formation of the preinitiation complex (PIC), resulting in an inhibition of the transcription reaction (18Hengartner C.J. Myer V.E. Liao S.M. Wilson C.J. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Also, during human immunodeficiency virus infection, the CTD kinase activity of the cdk9·cyclin T complex, characterized as a component of the elongation factor pTEFb (for positive transcription elongation factor b), is required for transactivation (19Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). One cannot exclude, however, that all three kinases (cdk7, cdk8, and cdk9) could regulate the CTD phosphorylation in concert with other events of gene expression such as splicing, poly-adenylation, capping, and/or dephosphorylation (20Kim E. Du L. Bregman D.B. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 21McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Indeed, to engage a new transcription cycle or to reinitiate after pausing, RNA pol II must be dephosphorylated (23Kobor M.S. Archambault J. Lester W. Holstege F.C.P. Gileadi O. Jansma D.B. Jennings E.G. Kouyoumdjian F. Davidson A.R. Young R.A. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 55-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar); this event involves a CTD phosphatase identified both in human and yeast (24Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Chambers R.S. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24498-24504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It thus remains to understand precisely how these various phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events are “milestones of the transcription mechanism.” As part of the multienzymatic protein complex TFIIH, CAK, in coordination with the XPB and XPD helicases, participates in various events of the transcription reaction. The XPB helicase opens the promoter around the start site to allow the formation of the first phosphodiester bond, the first step of RNA transcript synthesis (26Guzder S.N. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 369: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 27Moreland R.J. Tirode F. Yan Q. Conaway J.W. Egly J.M. Conaway R.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2532-2538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In fact, in vitro RNA synthesis may occur in the absence of either XPD helicase or CAK complex; however, when present, both significantly increase the rate of RNA synthesis (29Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 30Coin F. Bergmann E. Tremeau-Bravard A. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1357-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Whether transcription stimulation is due either to the XPD enzymatic function itself and/or to its physical presence remains an open question. It is however accepted that XPD anchors CAK to the core TFIIH (9Drapkin R. Le Roy G. Cho H. Akoulitchev S. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6488-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 10Reardon J.T. Ge H. Gibbs E. Sancar A. Hurwitz J. Pan Z.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6482-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and promotes the phosphorylation of RNA pol II CTD by CAK (27Moreland R.J. Tirode F. Yan Q. Conaway J.W. Egly J.M. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22127-22130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28Bradsher J. Coin F. Egly J.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Finally, the substrate specificity of the cdk7 kinase varies in accordance to its presence within TFIIH. Indeed, when the CAK complex is free, cdk7 preferentially phosphorylates cdk2, another member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family, whereas when part of TFIIH, a preferential and specific phosphorylation of the CTD of RNA pol II is observed (13Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 15Yankulov K.Y. Bentley D.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Such substrate specificity was ascribed to MAT1, the third component of CAK (15Yankulov K.Y. Bentley D.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Indeed, the addition of the MAT1 subunit to recombinant cdk7·cyclin H switched its substrate specificity to favor RNA pol II phosphorylation over cdk2. Whether this is connected to the stimulatory function of MAT1 towards cdk7 itself (13Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) or to its structure also remains to be answered. It should be pointed out that sequence alignments and secondary structure predictions identified two motifs in MAT1 (mass = 34 kDa; 309 amino acids), often involved in protein-protein interactions, an N-terminal RING finger domain, and a central coiled-coil domain (31Yee A. Nichols M.A. Wu L. Hall F.L. Kobayashi R. Xiong Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6058-6062PubMed Google Scholar, 32Inamoto S. Segil N. Pan Z.Q. Kimura M. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29852-29858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To understand the role of MAT1 both within TFIIH and in the transcription reaction, we generated deletion or point mutations in the RING finger domain. We demonstrate here that MAT1 interacts with the CAK complex through the hydrophobic C-terminal domain and that this region is sufficient to activate cdk7 kinase activity towards synthetic ctd4 or cdk2 substrates. Moreover, we demonstrate that, although not required for TFIIH complex formation, the RING finger motif of MAT1 has a crucial role in basal transcription complex activity and in the CTD phosphorylation process. Baculoviruses allowing the expression of single subunits of the core TFIIH or CAK subunits were described in Refs. 29Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar and 13Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, respectively. Baculoviruses allowing the expression of mutant or deletant forms of MAT1 were constructed in the pVL1392 vector (PharMingen). The cDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides containing EcoRI and BamHI sites in 5′ and 3′, respectively. After digestion by EcoRI and BamHI (New England Biolabs), polymerase chain reaction fragments were inserted into pVL1392. The resulting vectors were recombined with linearized baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold DNA, PharMingen) in Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) cells (33O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors, A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). The recombinant viruses were plaque-purified, and viral stocks were prepared by a three-step growth amplification. Pairwise protein interactions were characterized by coinfection in Sf9 cells (typically, 2.5 × 107 cells) with the corresponding recombinant baculoviruses at multiplicity of infection of 10 (XPB, XPD, and each MAT1 protein), 5 (p62), and 2 (cdk7 and cyclin H) plaque forming units/cell. Cells were collected 48 h later and washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 30% glycerol. After douncing in 2.5 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× proteinase inhibitor mixture containing 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, aproptinin, antipain, and chymostatin), clarified lysates were obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. 50 μl of clarified lysate were adsorbed on 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose cross-linked with the indicated antibody in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA) containing 50 mm KCl. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed extensively in buffer B containing 150 mm KCl and resuspended in Laemmli buffer. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins retained on the beads were analyzed by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies. Sf9 cells (typically, 1 × 108 cells) were infected with combinations of recombinant baculoviruses and were collected 48 h later. Cells were washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 30% glycerol and dounced in 10 ml of buffer A. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, recombinant TFIIH complexes were purified as described previously (29Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Briefly, clarified lysates were loaded on an heparin-Ultrogel column (Sepracor, France) pre-equilibrated in buffer A. After extensive washing with buffer A containing 400 mm NaCl, the proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. The eluted fraction was dialyzed for twice 2 h against buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 300 mm KCl) and was subsequently used as an input material for metal affinity purification. Samples containing recombinant TFIIH were incubated 1 h at 4 °C with metal affinity resin (Talon,CLONTECH). After packing the column, the resin was extensively washed with buffer C containing 10 mm imidazol, and proteins were eluted in buffer C containing 400 mm KCl and 100 mm EDTA. The elution fraction was then dialyzed against buffer B containing 50 mm KCl and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Kinase assays using either ctd4 peptide or purified recombinant GST-cdk2 as substrates were performed as described previously (8Roy R. Adamczewski J.P. Seroz T. Vermeulen W. Tassan J.P. Schaeffer L.

Thierry J.C. Egly J.M. Moras D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 958-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Insect cells clarified lysates containing the proteins to be tested (typically 100 μl) were incubated with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) cross-linked with Ab-cdk7 in buffer B containing 50 mm KCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed extensively in buffer B containing 150 mm KCl plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The proteins retained on the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE or subjected to a kinase assay. RNA pol II phosphorylation was carried out in the presence of all the components necessary for standard run-off transcription as well as the four NTPs as described previously (29Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Assays were consistent with standard reactions except that ATP was added to a final concentration of 5 mm, and 1 μl of purified RNA polymerase II was used/assay. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli, and samples were loaded on a 5% SDS-PAGE. The polymerase polypeptides were revealed using the 7C2 antibody (35Besse S. Vigneron M. Pichard E. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Gene Expr. 1995; 4: 143-161PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of the kinase activities were done using a Bio-imaging Analyzer FUJIX BAS 2000. The DNA-dependent ATPase activity was assayed as described previously (8Roy R. Adamczewski J.P. Seroz T. Vermeulen W. Tassan J.P. Schaeffer L. Nigg E.A. Hoeijmakers J.H. Egly J.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1093-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein fractions were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C in the presence of 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol, ICN Pharmaceuticals) in a 20 μl reaction volume in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 nm cold ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 4 μg/ml pUC309 plasmid. Reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to 50 mm. The reactions were then diluted 5-fold in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, spotted onto polyethylenimine TLC plates (Merck), run in 0.5 m LiCl, 1m formic acid, and autoradiographed. Standard run-off transcription assays were carried out as described previously (36Gérard M. Fischer L. Moncollin V. Chipoulet J.M. Chambon P. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20940-20945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, TFIIH fractions were incubated with purified transcription factors (TBP, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, and TFIIF) and RNA polymerase II in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 ng of DNA template (EcoRI-SalI-digested pUC309). Reaction mixtures (final volume = 20 μl) were preincubated 15 min at 25 °C. The transcription was then carried out for 45 min at 25 °C in the presence of ribonucleotides (250 μm each ATP, GTP, and UTP, 10 μm CTP) including radiolabeled CTP (4 μCi of 400 Ci/mmol [α-32P]CTP; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RNA transcripts were resolved by electrophoresis and analyzed by autoradiography. For transcription from the dihydrofolate reductase promoter, human TFIID was used instead of TBP in presence of 100 ng of DNA template (EcoRI-NarI-digested pUC18). Quantification of the various TFIIH activities was done using a Bio-imaging Analyzer FUJIX BAS 2000. For the ternary complex studies in the yeast three-hybrid system, we used the L40 strain (MATa, trp1, his3, leu2, ade2, LYS2::(LexAop)4-HIS3, URA3::(LexAop)8-lacZ). The plasmids pLex9-cdk7/Met-cyclin H and pVP16-MAT1 have been described previously (37Tirode F. Malaguti C. Romero F. Attar R. Camonis J. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22995-22999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For the deletion mutants of MAT1, the corresponding cDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, digested with EcoRI, and cloned in fusion to the activation domain of VP16 into the EcoRI site of pVP16. The correct open reading frames and DNA sequences were verified by sequencing. All the work with yeast including maintenance, transformation, methionine selection, and the liquid β-galactosidase assay using o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as a substrate were performed as described elsewhere (38Sandrock B. Tirode F. Egly J.M. MacDonald P.N. Methods in Molecular Biology, Two Hybrid systems. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000Google Scholar). The purification of TFIIH factor used as a control in our experiments as well as all the basic transcription factors required for RNA pol II kinase and in vitrotranscription assays were described previously (30Coin F. Bergmann E. Tremeau-Bravard A. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1357-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies raised against XPB, XPD, p52, p62, p44, p34, cdk7, cyclin H, and C-terminal MAT1 were previously described (30Coin F. Bergmann E. Tremeau-Bravard A. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1357-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody detecting the N-terminal part of MAT1 (1G6) was directed against a MAT1-derived peptide (MDDQGCPRCKTTKYRNPSL). For Western blot analysis, we used the ECL chemiluminescent method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Analysis of primary sequence as well as secondary structure predictions defined three putative domains in MAT1 (Fig.1 A): an N-terminal domain containing a canonical C3HC4 RING finger motif (amino acids 1–66), a central coiled-coil domain (amino acids 114–175), and a C-terminal hydrophobic domain (31Yee A. Nichols M.A. Wu L. Hall F.L. Kobayashi R. Xiong Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6058-6062PubMed Google Scholar, 32Inamoto S. Segil N. Pan Z.Q. Kimura M. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29852-29858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We also characterized a “minimal” fragment, which remains associated within the CAK complex after spontaneous degradation of MAT1 (data not shown). From N-terminal microsequencing, we defined this fragment as starting at amino acid 229. In a first set of assays, we investigated the interactions between the various domains of MAT1 and the subunits of the CAK. Genetic analysis of Tfb3/Rig2, the yeast homolog of MAT1, revealed that single point mutations in conserved cysteins of the RING finger have detrimental effects on viability. Changing cysteine 16 of yeast Tfb3/Rig2 to tyrosine resulted in temperature-sensitive growth, whereas changing cystein 34 to serine resulted in unconditional lethality. 2O. Gileadi, unpublished observations. We constructed baculovirus vectors carrying the corresponding point mutations in human MAT1, MAT1-C9Y and MAT1-C26S, respectively, in addition to deletions mutants of MAT1 (MAT1-(1–189), MAT1-(66–309), MAT1-(189–309), and MAT1-(229–309)). The recombinant proteins from the baculovirus-infected cell extracts (as indicated in the legend to Fig.1) were then immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against either cdk7 (Ab-cdk7) or cyclin H (Ab-cycH), previously bound to protein G-Sepharose. Finally, the proteins retained on the beads were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies raised against cdk7 and cyclin H (data not shown) or against the N- and C-terminal portions of MAT1. We first observed that MAT1 coimmunoprecipitated with either cdk7 or cyclin H meaning that it can interact separately with each of them (Fig.1 B, lanes 2 and 3). A stronger interaction was observed when both cdk7 and cyclin H were coexpressed with wild-type MAT1 (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). Moreover, this interaction likely occurs through the C-terminal domain of MAT1, because the binary cdk7·cyclin H complex was able to retain MAT1-(229–309) (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). The deletion of the C-terminal part of MAT1 leading to the MAT1-(1–189) protein abolished the interaction with cdk7·cyclin H, whereas progressive N-terminal truncations (MAT1-(66–309), MAT1-(189–309), and MAT1-(229–309)) did not alter it (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). This suggests that the RING finger is not involved in CAK formation. Indeed, the point mutations in the RING finger did not prevent the interaction between either MAT1-C9Y or MAT1-C26S with the cdk7·cyclin H complex (Fig. 1 C, compare lanes 1and 3 with lane 5). To further establish the physiological relevance of the C-terminal interaction with cdk7·cyclin H, we used the previously described inducible three-hybrid system (37Tirode F. Malaguti C. Romero F. Attar R. Camonis J. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22995-22999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, MAT1 and the truncated mutants 1–189, 66–309, and 189–309 were fused to the VP16 transcription activator motif giving pVP16-MAT1/WT, pVP16-MAT1-(1–189), pVP16-MAT1-(66–309), and pVP16-MAT1-(189–309) plasmids. Each construct was transformed together with the pLex9-cdk7/Met-cyclin H plasmid, in which cdk7 is fused to the DNA binding motif of LexA and the expression of cyclin H is under the control of the Met25 promoter, into the L40 yeast strain. The Met25 promoter is active in the absence of methionine in the selective minimal medium and repressed when methionine is added. The transcriptional activation of the reporter gene lacZ due to the formation of the ternary complex including cdk7, cyclin H, and MAT1 proteins, was measured on yeast cultures grown in the absence or in the presence of methionine according to a liquid β-galactosidase assay. No β-galactosidase activity was observed when cdk7 and cyclin H were expressed with either VP16-MAT1-(1–189) or VP16 alone (Fig.1 D). In contrast, when cdk7·cyclin H was expressed together with either VP16-MAT1-(66–309) or VP16-MAT1-(189–309), we observed an increase in the β-galactosidase activity even higher than with VP16-MAT1/WT. The repression of cyclin H in the presence of methionine completely abolishes the β-galactosidase synthesis. This strongly demonstrates that, in vivo, the C-terminal end of MAT1 interacts with the cdk7·cyclin H complex. Together, these results show that the formation of the CAK complex requires the C-terminal part of MAT1 and that this interaction involves both cdk7 and cyclin H. Previous studies have shown that MAT1 stimulates the kinase activity of the cdk7·cyclinH complex (13Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 15Yankulov K.Y. Bentley D.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We thus investigated the role of MAT1 fragments on the regulation of CAK kinase activity. Kinase assays were carried out using either the cyclin-dependent kinase cdk2, implicated in cell cycle progression, or the ctd4 peptide, mimicking four repeats of the heptapeptide consensus sequence of the CTD of RNA pol II, as a substrate (8Roy R. Adamczewski J.P. Seroz T. Vermeulen W. Tassan J.P. Schaeffer L. Nigg E.A. Hoeijmakers J.H. Egly J.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1093-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were coinfected with combinations of baculoviruses overexpressing cdk7 and cyclin H in addition to MAT1 either wild-type or mutated (as indicated at the top of the Fig. 2). Then, infected Sf9 cell extracts, in which MAT1 proteins were in excess, were immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against cdk7 (Ab-cdk7) immobilized onto protein G-Sepharose. After extensive washing, the kinase activity of the protein complexes retained on the beads was determined with either cdk2 (Fig. 2, upper and lower panels) or ctd4 (lower panel). The cdk7 kinase activity was then adjusted as a function of the amount of cdk7 immobilized on the beads, according to Western blot analysis (data not shown, and Fig.2, lower panel). The MAT1-WT as well as MAT1-C9Y and MAT1-C26S point mutants stimulated kinase activity 2–3-fold (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2–4 with lane 1 and lower panel) showing first the stimulatory function of MAT1 and second that the RING finger mutations did not alter either the kinase activity or the substrate specificity toward both cdk2 and the synthetic ctd4 substrates. Thus, in this simple in vitro kinase assay, the RING finger domain of MAT1 does not seem to be required for the CAK kinase activity. We also show that when the recombinant CAK complexes carry any of the C-terminal fragment (MAT1-(66–309), MAT1-(189–309), or MAT1-(229–309)), the phosphorylation of both substrates is still stimulated (2–3-fold) (Fig. 2, lanes 6–8). There was a slight but significant substrate specificity exhibited by the two C-terminal fragments of MAT1 (MAT1-(189–309) and MAT1-(229–309)) resulting in an up to 3-fold increase of cdk2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2,lanes 7 and 8; see also Refs. 13Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar and 15Yankulov K.Y. Bentley D.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The N-terminal fragment of MAT1 (MAT1-(1–189)), which did not bind the cdk7·cyclin H complex (Fig. 1 B), did not stimulate cdk2 or ctd4 phosphorylation (Fig. 2, compare lane 5 to lane 1). As a control, a protein complex"
https://openalex.org/W2067702416,"Novobiocic acid synthetase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic novobiocin, was cloned from the novobiocin producer Streptomyces spheroides NCIMB 11891. The enzyme is encoded by the gene novL, which codes for a protein of 527 amino acids with a calculated mass of 56,885 Da. The protein was overexpressed as a His6 fusion protein inEscherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography and gel chromatography. The purified enzyme catalyzed the formation of an amide bond between 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (ring A of novobiocin) and 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxy-8-methyl coumarin (ring B of novobiocin) in an ATP-dependent reaction. NovL shows homology to the superfamily of adenylate-forming enzymes, and indeed the formation of an acyl adenylate from ring A and ATP was demonstrated by an ATP-PPi exchange assay. The purified enzyme exhibited both activation and transferase activity, i.e. it catalyzed both the activation of ring A as acyl adenylate and the subsequent transfer of the acyl group to the amino group of ring B. It is active as a monomer as determined by gel filtration chromatography. The reaction was specific for ATP as nucleotide triphosphate and dependent on the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+. ApparentK m values for ring A and ring B were determined as 19 and 131 μm, respectively. Of several analogues of ring A, only 3-geranyl-4-hydroxybenzoate and to a lesser extent 3-methyl-4-aminobenzoate were accepted as substrates. Novobiocic acid synthetase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic novobiocin, was cloned from the novobiocin producer Streptomyces spheroides NCIMB 11891. The enzyme is encoded by the gene novL, which codes for a protein of 527 amino acids with a calculated mass of 56,885 Da. The protein was overexpressed as a His6 fusion protein inEscherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography and gel chromatography. The purified enzyme catalyzed the formation of an amide bond between 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (ring A of novobiocin) and 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxy-8-methyl coumarin (ring B of novobiocin) in an ATP-dependent reaction. NovL shows homology to the superfamily of adenylate-forming enzymes, and indeed the formation of an acyl adenylate from ring A and ATP was demonstrated by an ATP-PPi exchange assay. The purified enzyme exhibited both activation and transferase activity, i.e. it catalyzed both the activation of ring A as acyl adenylate and the subsequent transfer of the acyl group to the amino group of ring B. It is active as a monomer as determined by gel filtration chromatography. The reaction was specific for ATP as nucleotide triphosphate and dependent on the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+. ApparentK m values for ring A and ring B were determined as 19 and 131 μm, respectively. Of several analogues of ring A, only 3-geranyl-4-hydroxybenzoate and to a lesser extent 3-methyl-4-aminobenzoate were accepted as substrates. 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid 3-amino-4,7-dihydroxy-8-methyl coumarin noviose electron impact mass spectrometry 3-geranyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside kilobase pair(s) National Collection of Industrial, Food and Marine Bacteria nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction high pressure liquid chromatography The aminocoumarin antibiotic novobiocin is produced byStreptomyces spheroides and Streptomyces niveus. Novobiocin (see Fig. 1) consists of three moieties: a prenylated 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (ring A),1 a substituted aminocoumarin moiety (ring B), and a deoxysugar (ring C). Ring A is attached to the amino group of ring B via an amide bond. Both aromatic rings are derived from tyrosine, ring C is derived from glucose, and the prenyl group of ring A is formed via the nonmevalonate pathway (1.Li S.-M. Hennig S. Heide L. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 2717-2720Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 2.Steffensky M. Li S.-M. Vogler B. Heide L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 161: 69-74Crossref Google Scholar, 3.Kominek L.A. Sebek O.K. Dev. Ind. Microbiol. 1974; 15: 60-69Google Scholar). The antimicrobial activity of novobiocin results from its interaction with bacterial DNA gyrase, which has been investigated by x-ray crystallographic studies (4.Maxwell A. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 102-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 5.Lewis R.J. Singh O.M.P. Smith C.V. Skarzynski T. Maxwell A. Wonacott A.J. Wigley D.B.

The detailed knowledge available about the structural elements of novobiocin involved in its binding to the biological target may permit rational approaches in the search for new aminocoumarin derivatives. Recently, the development of new, synthetic aminocoumarin compounds with gyrase-inhibiting activity has been reported (8.Ferroud D. Collard J. Klich M. Dupuis-Hamelin C. Mauvais P. Lassaigne P.

Like novobiocin itself (Albamycin®, Pharmacia & Upjohn), such new aminocoumarins may serve as antibiotics for the treatment of infections with multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis (11.Raad I.I.

Genetic engineering and combinatorial biosynthesis in bacteria provide an important new tool for drug discovery. Besides polyketide synthetases, peptide synthetases especially have been successfully used for such approaches (14.Bently R. Bennet J.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 411-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 15.Khosla C. Gordon E.M. Kerwin J.F. Combinatorial Chemistry and Molecular Diversity in Drug Discovery.

Knowledge of the sequence and function of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of natural products is a prerequisite for such research. We have recently cloned and sequenced the biosynthetic gene cluster for novobiocin from S. spheroides NCIMB 11891 and have assigned functions to the biosynthetic genes by comparison with GenBankTM entries and by gene inactivation experiments (18.Steffensky M Mühlenweg A. Wang Z.-X. Li S.-M. Heide L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). A key step in the biosynthesis of novobiocin is the formation of the amide bond between ring A and ring B (Fig. 1) in an ATP-dependent reaction; this enzymatic reaction, termed novobiocic acid synthetase, has been demonstrated previously in crude extracts from a novobiocin-producing strain (19.Kominek L.A. Meyer H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 43: 502-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A detailed investigation of this reaction is of particular interest for the development of new aminocoumarin antibiotics; whereas ring B and ring C are essential for the binding of novobiocin to gyrase, the structure of ring A can be varied without loss of antibiotic activity (10.Laurin P. Ferroud D. Klich M. Dupuis-Hamelin C. Mauvais P. Lassaigne P. Bonnefoy A. Musicki B. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 2079-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 20.Althaus I.W. Dolak L. Reusser F. J. Antibiotics. 1988; 41: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the structure of ring A influences the uptake of the antibiotic through the bacterial membrane (20.Althaus I.W. Dolak L. Reusser F. J. Antibiotics. 1988; 41: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 21.Reusser F. Dolak L.A. J. Antibiotics. 1986; 39: 272-274PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning of the gene(s) for novobiocic acid synthetase and investigation of the substrate specificity of this reaction may therefore assist in the development of novobiocin derivatives with a modified ring A. We now report the cloning, overexpression, purification, and characterization of novobiocic acid synthetase from S. spheroides NCIMB 11891, encoded by the gene novL. [32P]Tetrasodium pyrophosphate (126.4 GBq/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Ring B and novobiocic acid were kindly provided by Pharmacia & Upjohn, Inc. (Kalamazoo, MI). 3-Cyclohexyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid was a gift from L. Wessjohann (Amsterdam, Netherlands). Plicatin B was kindly provided by R. Bates (Bangkok, Thailand). Ring A was obtained by hydrolysis of novobiocin as described previously (19.Kominek L.A. Meyer H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 43: 502-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). 3-Dimethylallyl-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was synthesized by hydrolysis of plicatin B as described in Bates et al. (22.Bates R.W. Gabel C.J. Ji J. Rama-Devi T. Tetrahedron. 1995; 51: 8199-8212Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar); EI-MS analysis on a TSQ70 spectrometer (Finnigan, Bremen, Germany) using methanol as solvent confirmed the identity of the product (observed molecular weight, 232.2; theoretical molecular weight of C14H16O3, 232.3). 3-Geranyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (GBA) was synthesized enzymatically from 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and geranyl diphosphate with 4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase of Escherichia coli(23.Melzer M. Heide L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); the incubation mixture (3 ml) contained 0.4 mm4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 2 mm geranyl diphosphate, 50 mm MgCl2, 1 mm KF, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and 0.2 mg/ml membrane protein fraction and was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 90 μl of concentrated formic acid. GBA was extracted with 30 ml of n-hexan, the organic phase was evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. Plasmid pUWL201 was kindly provided by A. Bechthold (Tübingen, Germany) and originally obtained from U. Wehmeier (Wuppertal, Germany). Cloning experiments were performed in E. coli XL1 Blue MRF′ by standard procedures (24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Heterologous expression experiments withStreptomyces lividans TK24 were carried out as described previously (18.Steffensky M Mühlenweg A. Wang Z.-X. Li S.-M. Heide L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was determined after cultivation in CDM medium (20 μg/ml thiostrepton) for 3–4 days at 28 °C and 170 rpm in baffled shake flasks. DNA manipulations and standard genetic techniques in E. coli and Streptomyces species were carried out as described in Sambrook et al. (24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Open table in a new tab The streptomyces expression vector pUWL201, containing theermE up promoter, was used for the construction of the expression plasmids. For the expression of novL, a 2.1-kbApaI fragment from plasmid p9–6GE9 containingnovL was cloned into the same site of pGEM-11Zf(+) to give pMS76. Restriction analysis confirmed that the EcoRI site of pGEM-11Zf(+) was located upstream of novL. The insert of pMS76 was excised with EcoRI and XbaI and ligated into the same sites of pUWL201 to give pMS77. pMS65, containing novH as a 1.95-kbEcoRI-BglII fragment in expression vector pUWL201, has been described previously (18.Steffensky M Mühlenweg A. Wang Z.-X. Li S.-M. Heide L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). pMS79, containing bothnovH and novL in pUWL201, was prepared by ligation of the same 1.95-kb EcoRI-BglII fragment carrying novH into theEcoRI-BamHI-sites of pMS76. Both genes in the resulting plasmid pMS78 were oriented in the same direction. The 4.08-kb insert of pMS78 was excised with EcoRI andXbaI and cloned into the same sites of pUWL201 to yield pMS79. Expression constructs were transformed into S. lividans TK24 and examined for novobiocic acid synthetase activity as described previously (18.Steffensky M Mühlenweg A. Wang Z.-X. Li S.-M. Heide L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). novL was amplified by PCR using pMS76 DNA as template. An SphI site was introduced at the place of the natural start codon, using primer novL-1 (5′-TAGCCACGCATGCCGAACAAGGATCAC-3′; bold letters represent the SphI site). At the C terminus, a BamHI site was introduced before and an EcoRI site behind the stop codon, using primer novL-3 (5′-CATCGAATTCTCAGGATCCCCTGTCCACCA-3′; bold letters represent introduced restriction sites). The PCR mixture (100 μl) contained 100 ng of pMS76 template, 22 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs (Stratagene), Pfu DNA polymerase reaction buffer, and 5% (v/v) Me2SO. 2.5 units of clonedPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) were added after an initial denaturation for 5 min at 96 °C, followed by 27 cycles (95 °C for 90 s, 72 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 4 min). The PCR product was digested with SphI and BamHI before ligation into the same sites of the expression vector pQE70, resulting in a C-terminal in-frame fusion with the His6 tag of pQE70. The resulting plasmid was designated as pMS80. novL was again amplified by PCR. A BglII site was introduced at the N-terminal side for in-frame ligation to the His6 tag of pRSet B using primer novL-4 (5′-CGAAAGATCTCCACATATGGCGAACAAGG-3′). The GTG start codon of novL was changed to an ATG codon by introduction of a NdeI site, which offers the possibility to remove the sequence for the N-terminal His tag by NdeI digestion and religation. Primer novL-3 (see above) was again used as C-terminal primer. PCR was carried out as described above, with an annealing temperature of 65 °C. TheBglII-EcoRI-digested PCR product was ligated into the same sites of pRSet B to create pMS82. The use of primer novL-3 resulted in the extension of the C-terminal end of the encoded protein from the original -VDR to -VDRGS. Expression experiments with pMS82 were performed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cultivated in NZYCM broth (24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C. E. coli XL1 Blue MRF′ was used as host for the expression of pMS80. Cells were cultured at 30 °C in LB medium (24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin until anA 600 of 0.7 was reached. 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was added, and after further growth for 3 h at 30 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells (3 g) were suspended in 3 ml of lysis buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mg/ml lysozyme). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the cell suspension was sonicated for 1 min (Branson Sonifier 250). 10 μg/ml RNase A and 5 μg/ml DNase I were added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for further 10 min. After removal of cellular debris by centrifugation (17,500 × g for 30 min), 1 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose slurry (50% (w/v) nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose resin suspension in 30% (v/v) ethanol, precharged with Ni2+) (Qiagen) were added and mixed gently by shaking for 60 min. The lysate-Ni-NTA-agarose mixture was loaded into a column. Unbound proteins were removed by washing with 8 ml of wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole), and the NovL fusion protein was eluted with 2 ml of elution buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole). The Ni-NTA-agarose eluate was applied to a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Chromatography was carried out with the same buffer at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Fractions were assayed for novobiocic acid synthetase activity. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (27.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar), and protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The molecular weight of native NovL was determined by gel filtration on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 column using the buffer described above. The column was calibrated with blue dextran 2000, aldolase (molecular weight, 158,000), albumin (molecular weight, 67,000), ovalbumin (molecular weight, 43,000), and ribonuclease A (molecular weight, 13,700) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The novobiocic acid synthetase assay contained 1 mm ring A, 1 mmring B, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm MnCl2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, in a final volume of 100 μl. To assay the activity of crude extracts, 20–100 μg of protein and an incubation time of 20 min were used. To assay the activity of purified novobiocic acid synthetase, a maximum of 5 μg of enzyme and an incubation time of 7 min were used to ensure linearity of the product formation. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C and stopped by addition of 5 μl of 1.5 m trichloroacetic acid. The reaction mixture was extracted with 1 ml of ethyl acetate, the organic phase was evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in H2O/methanol (50:50, v/v). HPLC analysis was carried out using a Multosphere RP18–5 column (250 × 4 mm, 5 μm; C + S Chromatographie Service, Düren, Germany) with a linear gradient from 60 to 100% methanol in 1% aqueous formic acid and detection at 305 nm. Authentic novobiocic acid was used as a standard. The reaction mixture of the ATP-PPi exchange assay (28.Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Bergendahl V. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) contained (in a final volume of 100 μl) 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm ATP, 0.1 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 34.4 kBq [32P]tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 4 μg of purified novobiocic acid synthetase, and 1 mm of the tested substrates ring A or ring B. After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of a mixture containing 1.2% (w/v) activated charcoal, 0.1 m tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and 3% (v/v) perchloric acid. The charcoal was pelleted by centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 5 min), washed twice with 1 ml of water, and finally resuspended in 0.5 ml of water. The charcoal-bound radioactivity was measured using a Tri-Carb 2100TR scintillation analyzer (Canberra-Packard) after addition of 9 ml of liquid scintillation fluid (Rotiszint® Eco Plus, Roth). To confirm the identity of the product of the novobiocic acid synthetase reaction, 2 ml (22.5 mg of protein) of a crude extract fromS. lividans TK24 transformed with the expression construct pMS77 were passed through a Sephadex G-25 column and incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 1 mm ring A, 1 mm ring B, 5 mm ATP, and 5 mmMnCl2 in a final volume of 15 ml for 60 min at 30 °C. After addition of 750 μl of 1.5 m trichloroacetic acid, the incubation mixture was extracted for three times with 20 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic phases were combined, evaporated, and dissolved in H2O/methanol (50:50, v/v), and the reaction product was purified by HPLC as described for the novobiocic acid synthetase assay (see above). EI-MS was carried out as described under “Chemicals and Radiochemicals” using dichloromethane as a solvent. A molecular weight of 395.2 was observed (for novobiocic acid, C22H21 NO6, the molecular weight was 395.4). To confirm the identity of the product formed from the ring A analogue GBA, 50 μg of purified NovL, 0.5 mm GBA, 1 mmRing B, 5 mm ATP, and 5 mm MnCl2were incubated in a final volume of 1 ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 1.5 m trichloroacetic acid. After extraction with 3 × 1 ml of ethyl acetate and evaporation of the organic phase, the residue was dissolved in in H2O/methanol (50:50 v/v), and the reaction product was purified by HPLC as described for the novobiocic acid synthetase assay (see above). EI-MS analysis was performed as described under “Chemicals and Radiochemicals,” and a molecular weight of 463.3 was observed (theoretical result: molecular weight of C27H29 NO6 was 463.5). Sequence analysis of the novobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster revealed two genes for which homology searches suggested a possible involvement in the novobiocic acid synthetase reaction (18.Steffensky M Mühlenweg A. Wang Z.-X. Li S.-M. Heide L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar); the deduced protein sequence of novH showed similarity to nonribosomal peptide synthetases, and novL showed homology to acyl-CoA synthetases and 4-coumarate:CoA ligases. Novobiocic acid synthetase activity could be demonstrated (18.Steffensky M Mühlenweg A. Wang Z.-X. Li S.-M. Heide L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) upon heterologous expression of a 6.96 kb DNA fragment comprising novH,novL, and three further complete open reading frames (Fig.2, pMS73). To identify the genes involved in this reaction, we now prepared additional constructs containing these genes, expressed them in S. lividans TK24, and examined the resulting novobiocic acid synthetase activity. All constructs were derived from pUWL201 and contained the ermE up promoter for foreign gene expression. Whereas expression of novH (Fig. 2,pMS65) yielded no activity, novobiocic acid synthetase was clearly detected upon expression of novL (pMS77). The identity of the enzymatic product was confirmed by HPLC in comparison with authentic substance and by preparative isolation of the product followed by mass spectroscopy (EI-MS; see “Experimental Procedures”). Simultaneous expression of novH andnovL (pMS79) did not increase activity in comparison to the expression of novL alone (Fig. 2), and likewise a mixture of the two enzyme extracts obtained after separate expression of genesnovH and novL (pMS65 and pMS77), respectively, did not show higher activity than the extract obtained from the expression of novL alone (data not shown). This demonstrates that the novobiocic acid synthetase reaction is catalyzed by NovL alone and that NovH is not required for this activity. Within the novobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster (GenBankTMaccession number AF170880), novL spans positions 12457–14040. It comprises 1584 base pairs and encodes a protein of 527 amino acids (calculated mass, 56,885 Da). The coding region has an overall G + C content of 70.1%. Upstream of the GTG initiation codon, a putative ribosomal binding site (AGGTAG) was identified. Fig.3 shows that NovL contains several conserved motifs supposed to be involved in common steps of adenylate formation, i.e. nucleotide binding, PPi release, and adenylation of the carboxylate moiety of the substrate. These motifs include Box I (SSGTTGXPKGV) and a sequence similar to the Box II motif (usually GEICIRG) of 4-coumarate:CoA ligases (29.Stuible H.-P. Büttner D. Ehlting J. Hahlbrock K. Kombrink E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), as well as motifs A8 and A10 in the C-terminal domain (30.Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). As confirmed by mutational analysis, both the conserved Lys of the Box I motif and the conserved Arg of motif A8 cooperate in coordinating the pyrophosphate release during adenylate formation (29.Stuible H.-P. Büttner D. Ehlting J. Hahlbrock K. Kombrink E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The conserved Lys of motif A10 interacts with the carboxyl group of the substrate as well as with the ribose oxygens O-4′ and O-5′ (30.Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Becker-André et al. (31.Becker-Anrdré M. Schulze-Lefert P. Hahlbrock K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8551-8559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested a participation of the central cysteine within Box II motif of 4-coumarate:CoA ligases in thiolester formation, but this hypothesis was recently disproven by mutational analysis (29.Stuible H.-P. Büttner D. Ehlting J. Hahlbrock K. Kombrink E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A distinction between coenzyme A ligases and enzymes that merely form acyl adenylates is therefore not possible from sequence data. In contrast to nonribosomal peptide synthetases, NovL did not show a 4′-phosphopantetheinyl attachment site. For further characterization, NovL was expressed in E. coli in form of different fusion proteins with a His6 residue for metal affinity chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fusion of the His tag to the N terminus of NovL resulted in the expression of an unsoluble protein, and only minimal novobiocic acid synthetase activity (0.74 pkat/mg protein) was detectable in the soluble fraction. Fusion of the His tag to the C terminus of NovL gave approximately 7-fold higher activities (5.1 pkat/mg). SDS-PAGE analysis showed, after induction with IPTG, the formation of a 60.6-kDa protein (calculated mass, 58.1 kDa) (Fig. 4), most of which was still in the insoluble fraction. The amount of soluble protein could be increased, however, by decreasing the growth temperature to 30 °C, reducing IPTG concentration to 0.5 mm, induction at a later stage of the growth phase (A 600 = 0.7), and shortening of the induction period to 3 h. Under these conditions, soluble novobiocic acid synthetase was obtained in an activity of 461 pkat/mg protein. The fusion protein of NovL with the C-terminal His6 tag was purified by"

Mutants were expressed in low copy number in a yeast strain devoid of endogenous Ca2+ pumps and screened for loss of Ca2+ and Mn2+ transport on the basis of hypersensitivity to 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) and Mn2+ toxicity, respectively. Three classes of mutants were found: mutants indistinguishable from wild type (Class 1), mutants indistinguishable from the pmr1 null strain (Class 2), and mutants with differential sensitivity to BAPTA and Mn2+ toxicity (Class 3). We show that Class 1 mutants retain normal/near normal properties, including 45Ca transport, Golgi localization, and polypeptide conformation. In contrast, Class 2 mutants lacked any detectable 45Ca transport; of these, a subset also showed defects in trafficking and protein folding, indicative of structural problems. Two residues identified as Class 2 mutants in this screen, Asn774 and Asp778 in M6, also play critical roles in related ion pumps and are therefore likely to be common architectural components of the cation-binding site. Class 3 mutants appear to have altered selectivity for Ca2+ and Mn2+ ions, as exemplified by mutant Q783A in M6.

Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Well known members of the family include the Na+/K+-ATPase of animal cells, H+/ATPase of fungi and plants, and various Ca2+-ATPases found in plasma membrane and endomembrane compartments. Individual pumps have evolved distinct cation selectivities to fulfill a variety of different physiological functions including Ca2+ homeostasis, acid (H+) extrusion, generation of Na+ and K+electrochemical gradients, and the detoxification of soft metals (Cu2+, Cd2+, and Zn2+). Despite their differences in cation selectivity, [P]ATPases share many structural and mechanistic similarites. Remarkably, the electron micrograph structures (8 Å) of the fungal H+-ATPase and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase are virtually superimposable within the dimensions of the membrane (2Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 3Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kuhlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 392: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In both cases, densities corresponding to ten transmembrane helices are clearly visible, of which three are clustered to enclose a well defined pore, plausibly the pathway for ion translocation, extending from the cytoplasmic to the lumenal/extracellular space. A variety of experimental evidence points to three helices, transmembrane segments M4, M5, and M6, that are most likely to be involved in transport. For example, in the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, mutagenesis of residues in M4, M5, and M6 prevent cation binding and inactivate transport (reviewed in Ref. 4MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Odermatt A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and cysteine residues engineered into M4 and M6 can be disulfide-linked (5Rice W.J. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The proximity of M5 and M6 may be inferred from studies on the fungal H+-ATPase showing the presence of a salt bridge between residues in these two helices (6Sen Gupta S. DeWitt N.D. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34328-34334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Defining the residues that compose the ion-binding site(s) is a first step toward understanding how vectorial transport occurs. Extensive mutagenesis studies have contributed to the emerging molecular picture of the transport site in which oxygen-containing side chains coordinate one or more cations. Thus, in SERCA, residues Glu309 (M4), Glu771 (M5), and Asn796, Thr799, and Asp800 (M6), are required for binding two Ca2+ ions (reviewed in Ref. 4MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Odermatt A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Similar studies in the Na+/K+-ATPase have revealed the important role of residues Ser775 (M5), Asp804, and Asp808 (M6) in K+ and possibly Na+, binding (reviewed in Ref. 7Lingrel J.B. Croyle M.L. Woo A.L. Arguello J.M. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 163: 69-77Google Scholar). Interestingly, Asn796 and Asp800 of SERCA occupy equivalent positions to Asp804 and Asp808 in Na+/K+-ATPase, suggesting that the architecture of the ion-binding site may be similar in the two enzymes. Additional studies on other ion pumps will be key to determining whether this similarity extends throughout the family. The [P]ATPases offer a striking paradigm for the evolutionary development of ion selectivity; yet the molecular basis for selectivity remains one of the fundamental unanswered questions in the field. From studies on other classes of transport proteins, it is clear that selectivity is determined by the local environment around key residues (8Hama H. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1063-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Galzi J.-L. Devillers-Thiery A. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Changeux J.-P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1992; 359: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to identify, from conventional site-directed mutagenesis alone, which residues are important for distinguishing between different ions, such as Ca2+ and Na+. Despite having completely nonoverlapping ion selectivities, four of five residues important for Ca2+binding in SERCA are conserved in equivalent positions in the Na+/K+-ATPase sequence so that these residuescannot be considered to define ion selectivity. Here we report on the mutagenesis of every oxygen-containing side chain within membrane segments M4–M8 of Pmr1, the yeast secretory pathway/Golgi ion pump. Previous studies from our lab (10Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 11Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), as well as others (12Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol.

A novel aspect of this study is the phenotypic screening of yeast mutants to identify residues that are critical for Ca2+ and Mn2+ transport and selectivity. We show that this approach greatly simplifies the analysis of mutants and can be used to screen large numbers of mutants in future random mutagenesis studies. We expect that this approach can be extended to the study of heterologous ion pumps expressed in yeast, including Ca2+-ATPases from animal and plant systems (15Liang F. Cunningham K.W. Harper J.F.

Yeast strains were grown in defined media containing yeast nitrogen base (6.7 g/liter; Difco), dextrose (2%), and supplements as needed. PMR1-containing plasmids were introduced into strain K616 (17Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), which carries null alleles of calcineurin B (CNB1) and two Ca2+-ATPases (PMR1 and PMC1), resulting in low basal Ca2+ pump activity, as described previously (10Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Growth assays were performed by inoculating 100 μl of YNB medium in a 96-well plate with 2–5 μl of a saturated seed culture followed by incubation for 48 h at 30 °C. Where indicated, MnCl2 or BAPTA1 was added to the medium prior to inoculation, and the pH was adjusted to 6.0 with NaOH. Cultures were thoroughly mixed by gentle vortexing, and growth was monitored by measuring absorbance at 600 nm in a SPECTRAmax 340 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Relative growth was expressed as the fraction of the absorbance of the control culture (no additions). YEpHR1, a yeast 2μ plasmid carrying the PMR1 coding sequence under control of a tandem repeat of a yeast heat shock element has been described previously (10Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). YCpHR1 is an identical construct made in a single copy/CEN backbone derived from plasmid YCplac33 (18Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions were introduced into anEcoRI-PstI fragment or aHindIII-EcoRI fragment of PMR1subcloned into the bacterial vector pBlueScript (Stratagene) using the inverse polymerase chain reaction reaction (19Fisher C.L. Pei G.K. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and a pair of oligonucleotide primers in each case. The PMR1 fragment was entirely sequenced to rule out unwanted mutations. Reconstruction of the mutagenized fragments into plasmids YEpHR1 and YCpHR1 was by standard cloning techniques. Preparations of total membranes, subcellular fractionation by sucrose gradient centrifugation, and isolation of Golgi vesicles from yeast were exactly as described earlier (10Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by a modified Lowry assay (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) following precipitation of samples containing sucrose with 10% trichloroacetic acid and using bovine serum albumin as standard. Samples were prepared for electrophoresis by precipitating with trichloroacetic acid as described (10Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal one-third of Pmr1 were performed as described previously (10Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent 45Ca transport assays of sucrose gradient fractions and pooled Golgi membranes were done by rapid filtration as described previously (10Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Concanamycin A (Sigma; 10 nm) and carbonyl cyanidep-chlorophenylhydrazone (25 μm) were added to eliminate activity of vacuolar H+/Ca2+exchange. In assays of Mn2+ competition, 45Ca was at 0.4 μCi/ml (nominally, 0.8 μm), and MnCl2 was added as indicated. Preparations of total membranes (1 mg/ml) were treated with trypsin (TosPheCH2Cl-treated, Sigma) at a trypsin to protein ratio of 1:10 in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 m KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. When specified, samples were preincubated for 5 min with Na2ATP (pH 6.7) added to a final concentration of 5 mm. After 5 min at 30 °C, the digests were terminated by addition of trichloroacetic acid to 10%. Samples were chilled on ice (30 min) and collected by microcentrifugation (30 min), and the resulting pellets were resuspended in gel loading buffer for electrophoresis. Mutant yeast strains lacking a functional copy of Pmr1, a P-type ATPase found in the Golgi, exhibit distinct Ca2+ and Mn2+-related cellular defects (12Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 13Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Hypersensitivity of pmr1 mutants to depletion of extracellular Ca2+ or Mn2+, by chelating agents such as BAPTA or EGTA, appears to be due to a lack of high affinity transport of these ions into the secretory pathway, where they serve essential functions in protein sorting, glycosylation, and secretion. It has been shown that BAPTA toxicity may be overcome by the introduction of minimal free concentrations of either Ca2+ (∼0.84 nm) or Mn2+(∼0.16 pm) to growth media (14Durr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K. Catty P. Wolf D. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), indicating that the two ions can play largely surrogate roles in supporting yeast growth. Because standard yeast media have nearly a 100-fold excess of Ca2+ relative to Mn2+, and the latter is efficiently removed at low chelator concentrations, the observed growth inhibition by BAPTA in pmr1 mutants represents a titration of the remaining Ca2+. Hypersensitivity of pmr1mutants to Mn2+ toxicity is a specific consequence of loss of Mn2+ transport. Although essential for growth, excess Mn2+ is toxic and must be removed by delivery into the secretory pathway by Pmr1 and subsequent exit from the cell. Thus, we reasoned that sensitivity to BAPTA and Mn2+ toxicity would be a preliminary indication of the Ca2+ and Mn2+ transporting activity of Pmr1 mutants. 35 mutations were made at potential cation-binding sites (Asp, Glu, Asn, Gln, Ser, Thr, and Tyr) in the predicted transmembrane segments M4, M5, M6, M7, and M8 of Pmr1. Residues were substituted with Ala, and in the case of acidic residues, also as follows: Asp → Asn, Glu and Glu → Asp, Gln. In one case, an Asp was introduced to replace Ala749 in M5 so as to mimic the sequence of the SERCA pump. Pmr1 mutants were introduced into the yeast strain K616 (Δpmr1Δpmc1Δcnb1), which we have previously shown to be devoid of endogenous Ca2+ pump activity (10Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To ensure low level expression of the pump for phenotype analysis, mutants were expressed under control of the heat shock element, from single copy/CEN plasmids, and grown at 30 °C. We found that in the absence of heat shock, leak-through expression of Pmr1 was similar to native levels of expression from the endogenous promoter (not shown). Each mutant was screened for sensitivity to BAPTA and Mn2+ in quantitative liquid growth assays, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Plasmids containing wild typePMR1 (YCpHR1) and the empty vector (YCpH2) were also transformed into strain K616 as controls. Mutants fell into one of three classes, as exemplified in Fig.1. Class 1 mutants, such as mutant T826A, were indistinguishable from wild type in both BAPTA and Mn2+ tolerance assays and were assumed to have largely normal transport function. Class 2 mutants, such as mutant D778A, displayed a null phenotype for both BAPTA and Mn2+tolerance, suggesting a complete loss of function. Interestingly, some mutants displayed differential tolerance to BAPTA and Mn2+and were grouped as Class 3 mutants. An extreme example is mutant Q783A (Fig. 1), in which tolerance to BAPTA is at wild type levels, whereas tolerance to Mn2+ is similar to the null mutant, suggesting that Ca2+ transport is retained but Mn2+transport is lost. Two other mutants (E329A and A749D) showed intermediate profiles of BAPTA tolerance but complete loss of Mn2+ tolerance. These are putative ion selectivity mutants. A complete classification of all 35 mutants reported in this study is listed in Table I. None of the residues targeted for mutagenesis in membrane segments M4 and M8 were found to be essential for function; although the apparently conservative substitutions E329D (M4) and D856E (M8) were Class 2 (loss-of-function) mutants, substitution with Ala restored function either partially (E329A) or completely (D856A). Alanine substitutions of residues Gln742 (M5), Asn774 and Asp778(M6), and Thr817 (M7) resulted in loss-of-function phenotypes. Additional substitution of Asp778 with Glu and Asn also failed to restore function, confirming the importance of this residue in cation transport.Table ISummary of pmr1 mutant phenotype, targeting, and protein foldingMutationMembrane spanPhenotype class1-aGrowth inhibition by BAPTA and Mn2+ was evaluated from low copy expression of mutants in the pmr1 null strain as described in the text.

Western blots using anti-Pmr1 polyclonal antibody provided evidence for the biogenesis and membrane insertion of all mutant Pmr1 proteins, albeit with some variation in expression levels, as shown in the samples in Fig. 2. Curiously, Class 2 mutants N774A, D778E, T817A, and D856E had distinctly faster mobility on SDS-PAGE (Figs. 2 and 4). Mutant plasmids were rescued from the transformed yeast strains and analyzed by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing to confirm the integrity of the mutant gene (not shown). The faster mobility appeared not to be related to altered glycosylation or phosphorylation of the protein 2D. M. Mandal and R.

Yeast total membranes were treated with trypsin and subjected to Western analysis, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Where indicated, membranes were preincubated with 5 mm ATP. The presence of an ATP-protectable 52-kDa tryptic fragment (asterisk) in mutants E329D, N859A, and D778N correlates with Golgi localization and normal mobility of Pmr1 polypeptides on SDS-PAGE, as shown in Figs. 2and 3 and Table I. Conversely, the absence of this fragment in mutants N774A, D778E, and D856E correlates with abnormal mobility and localization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Trafficking of mutant Pmr1 proteins was examined on well defined sucrose density gradient fractionations of yeast lysates. This analysis was essential to normalize ion transport activity to Pmr1 expression levels in the Golgi fractions and can be considered a second indication of structural problems, because incorrectly folded ATPases are retained and subsequently degraded in the yeast endoplasmic reticulum (21Nakamoto R.K.

Fig.3 shows the subcellular localization of a subset of Pmr1 mutants; a complete listing of organellar localization is found in Table I. We have previously demonstrated a clear separation of the lighter Golgi fractions (fractions 4–6 in Fig. 3) from endoplasmic reticulum, the latter being distributed in the denser half of the sucrose gradient (fractions 8–11). All of the Class 1 mutants showed normal trafficking to the Golgi, consistent with their normal phenotype. Among the other two classes of mutants, some displayed normal trafficking, as depicted in Fig. 3 for D778N. Others were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, either partially (A749D) or completely (D778E). When the target residue was acidic (Asp778 and Asp856), there was a striking difference in targeting depending upon the nature of the substitution. Surprisingly, substitution with another acidic residue (Asp → Glu and Glu → Asp) led to ER retention and concomitant loss of function (Table I), whereas substitution with a neutral residue allowed correct Golgi targeting. Another interesting finding from this study was that complete ER retention consistently correlated with faster mobility of the mutant Pmr1 polypeptide upon SDS gel electrophoresis, possibly indicating an abnormal protein conformation that was resistant to unfolding in SDS. It should be noted that mutants showing ER retention continued to show trafficking problems under normal culture temperatures of 30 °C, which obviate the possibly deleterious effects of heat shock-induced expression (at 37 °C) on protein targeting. Individual fractions of the sucrose gradient were assayed for45Ca transport activity. As described earlier, the host strain was essentially devoid of endogenous Ca2+ pump activity, whereas plasmid-encoded Pmr1 transport activity was largely restricted to Golgi membrane containing fractions. All Class 1 mutants had significant transport activity ranging from ∼10 to 150% of wild type levels as depicted for mutant N859A in Fig. 3. In contrast, Class 2 mutants had no detectable transport activity above the vector-transformed control (mutants E329D, D778N, and D778E in Fig. 3). Of the putative ion selectivity mutants (Class 3), Q783A had wild type levels of Ca2+ transport activity (not shown), whereas mutants A749D and E329A (Fig. 3) were reduced to 10 and 30% of wild type, respectively. An important step in mutant analysis is the assessment of the structural integrity of mutant polypeptides. We have previously described the use of limited proteolysis as a probe of overall protein conformation (11Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Golgi membranes were treated with trypsin in the presence or absence of ATP to detect ligand-induced conformational changes, and mutants were screened for specific proteolytic intermediates, as illustrated in the examples shown in Fig. 4. An ATP-protectable 52-kDa tryptic fragment was detected in all mutants with normal Golgi trafficking, similar to that seen in the wild type protein (Fig. 4; E329D, N859A, and D778N). Interestingly, there was a progressive loss of ATP-protection with increasing defects in localization; thus, in mutants showing partial ER retention, ATP protection against trypsinolysis was poor, whereas mutants showing complete ER retention had no ATP-protectable fragments (Fig. 4; N774A, D778E, and D856E). Table I lists the efficiency of ATP protection against proteolysis for all mutants in this study. We have observed saturable54Mn uptake into Golgi vesicles isolated from strains expressing wild type Pmr1 but not from the null mutant K616, 3Y. Wei and R. Rao, unpublished results. consistent with the proposed role of Pmr1 in Mn2+ transport. An alternative approach is to use Mn2+ inhibition of 45Ca transport to assess Mn2+ transport activity, as reported earlier (11Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Here, we examine the effectiveness of Mn2+inhibition in the putative ion selectivity (Class 3) mutant Q783A. Fig.5 shows that Mn2+ is a potent inhibitor of 45Ca transport in Golgi vesicles containing wild type Pmr1, with half-maximal inhibition occurring at 0.2 μm, under conditions where the Ca2+concentration is nominally 0.8 μm (approximately 10-fold in excess over the Km for Ca2+; Refs.10Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, and 11Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These data suggest that ion selectivity of wild type Pmr1 is Mn2+ > Ca2+. In contrast, half-maximal inhibition for the Q783A mutant ocurred at 12 μm, a 60-fold shift relative to wild type. These results are consistent with a dramatic reduction in the affinity for Mn2+, and consequently hypersensitivity to Mn2+ toxicity (Fig. 1), in this mutant. In this study, we describe an effective strategy to screen for amino acid residues critical for ion transport and selectivity in yeast mutants of the secretory pathway/Golgi ion pump, Pmr1. As a test of this approach, we used alanine-scanning site-directed mutagenesis of acidic and polar residues within the transmembrane segments most likely to constitute the translocation pore. Mutants were readily classified in one of three groups based upon cell growth in BAPTA- or Mn2+-supplemented medium. Class 1 mutants did not display hypersensitivity to either BAPTA or Mn2+, a first indication of normal function. Further analysis confirmed that these mutants showed normal trafficking to the Golgi, had significant45Ca transport activity and appeared to be correctly folded based upon the ability of ATP to protect against trypsinolysis. Most of the residues targeted for mutagenesis in this study fell into this class (Fig. 6) and were not essential for pump function, as was observed in previous site-directed mutagenesis studies of this scale on the Na+/K+-ATPase, H+-ATPase, and SERCA (reviewed in Refs. 4MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Odermatt A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 7Lingrel J.B. Croyle M.L. Woo A.L. Arguello J.M. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 163: 69-77Google Scholar, and 22Ambesi A. DeWitt N.D. Petrov V.V. Sen Gupta S. Slayman C.W. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 107-113PubMed Google Scholar). Class 2 mutants were hypersensitive to both BAPTA and Mn2+toxicity, indicative of a complete lack of pump function, which was confirmed by the lack of 45Ca transport activity in isolated Golgi fractions. To distinguish between structural and functional derangements, we analyzed protein trafficking and sensitivity to trypsinolysis. Mutants that showed normal Golgi trafficking also displayed ATP-protectable trypsin fragments, whereas those that showed ER retention failed to generate ATP-protectable tryptic peptides. The latter also displayed increased mobility upon gel electrophoresis, for reasons that are currently unresolved. These observations are consistent with abnormal polypeptide folding and indicate sites that are sensitive to structural perturbations. Unexpectedly, Asp → Glu and Glu → Asp substitutions caused structural problems, whereas replacement with the neutral alanine did not. Although the perturbation caused by introduction of the longer glutamate side chain may be rationalized as a steric effect, it is not clear why substitution of aspartate, a shorter carboxylate side chain, in place of glutamate was more deleterious than that of alanine. One possibility is that within the confines of the membrane, differences in dihedral angle preferences for the carboxyl group of aspartate and glutamate may be important. Fig. 6 summarizes the results of our study. None of the target residues in transmembrane segments M4 or M8 were essential for function, although substitution-specific loss of function was observed at Glu329 and Asp856. Structural and trafficking defects were also seen with alanine substitution of Gln742(M5), Asn774 (M6), and Thr817 (M7), resulting in complete loss of function. However, alanine and asparagine substitution mutants of Asp778 (M6) showed normal trafficking and polypeptide conformation yet lacked transport activity, making this residue a good candidate for the cation-binding pocket. Strikingly similar findings have been reported for mutations at residues equivalent to Asn774 and Asp778 of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase: thus, mutant N879A was retained in endoplasmic reticulum, whereas mutant D883A showed normal trafficking to the plasma membrane (23Guerini D. Foletti D. Vellani F. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Both showed a complete loss of Ca2+ transport activity (23Guerini D. Foletti D. Vellani F. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24Adebayo A.O. Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27812-27816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Alanine substitutions of the equivalent residues in the Na+/K+-ATPase, Asp804 and Asp808, however, do not prevent trafficking to the plasma membrane, as judged by ouabain binding ability in intact cells (7Lingrel J.B. Croyle M.L. Woo A.L. Arguello J.M. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 163: 69-77Google Scholar), but are also associated with loss of transport activity. Thus, these two sites appear to be common components of the cation-binding site in most P-type ATPases. One exception is the fungal H+-ATPase, Pma1, where Asp730 (equivalent to Asp778 of Pmr1) forms a salt bridge with Arg695 in M5; simultaneous substitution of both residues with alanine does not alter function (6Sen Gupta S. DeWitt N.D. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34328-34334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The simple growth screens based on BAPTA and Mn2+ toxicity in pmr1 mutants are capable of distinguishing between essential and nonessential residues and can be used to screen large numbers of randomly generated mutants in future studies. We also show that the screens can identify potential sites of cation selectivity. Three such sites were identified in this study; in each case, the mutants showed greater sensitivity to Mn2+ toxicity than to that of the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA in growth assays, suggesting that the mutation had a more deleterious effect on Mn2+ transport. However, in a previous study, we have reported on a mutation with the converse effect; D53A, within the N-terminal modulatory EF hand-like domain in Pmr1, was indistinguishable from wild type in the Mn2+ toxicity assay (11Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but BAPTA toxicity in this mutant was intermediate between wild type and the pmr1 null mutant.3 We showed that apparent Mn2+ affinity was slightly increased relative to wild type, whereas there was a 11-fold reduction in Ca2+transport affinity in this mutant (11Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Q783A has normal Ca2+ transport but a 60-fold reduction in the apparent affinity for Mn2+. Only one such mutation with a similar dramatic effect on ion selectivity has been reported in studies on other ion pumps; substitution of Ser775 in M5 with alanine in the Na+/K+-ATPase causes a 30-fold decrease in only K+ but not Na+ affinity (25Blostein R. Wilczynska A. Karlish S.J.D. Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24987-24993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar,26Pedersen P.A. Nielsen J.M. Rasmussen J.H. Jorgensen P.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17818-17827Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that only two of five residues required for Ca2+ binding in SERCA were essential in Pmr1. A likely interpretation is that unlike SERCA, which has a stoichiometry of two Ca2+ transported per ATP, Pmr1 transports only one cation transported per ATP. In the sequence of Pmr1 and its homologues, Ala and Met occupy positions equivalent to Glu771 (M5) and Thr799 (M6) of SERCA, consistent with a fewer number of cation-binding sites. These differences support the classification of the newly emergent secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPases as a group distinct from but related to the well known endoplasmic reticulum pumps."
https://openalex.org/W2127906310,"Abstract Corynebacterium ammoniagenes contains a ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) of the class Ib type. The small subunit (R2F) of the enzyme has been proposed to contain a manganese center instead of the dinuclear iron center, which in other class I RNRs is adjacent to the essential tyrosyl radical. The nrdF gene of C. ammoniagenes, coding for the R2F component, was cloned in an inducibleEscherichia coli expression vector and overproduced under three different conditions: in manganese-supplemented medium, in iron-supplemented medium, and in medium without addition of metal ions. A prominent typical tyrosyl radical EPR signal was observed in cells grown in rich medium. Iron-supplemented medium enhanced the amount of tyrosyl radical, whereas cells grown in manganese-supplemented medium had no such radical. In highly purified R2F protein, enzyme activity was found to correlate with tyrosyl radical content, which in turn correlated with iron content. Similar results were obtained for the R2F protein of Salmonella typhimurium class Ib RNR. The UV-visible spectrum of the C. ammoniagenes R2F radical has a sharp 408-nm band. Its EPR signal at g = 2.005 is identical to the signal of S. typhimurium R2F and has a doublet with a splitting of 0.9 millitesla (mT), with additional hyperfine splittings of 0.7 mT. According to X-band EPR at 77–95 K, the inactive manganese form of the C. ammoniagenes R2F has a coupled dinuclear Mn(II) center. Different attempts to chemically oxidize Mn-R2F showed no relation between oxidized manganese and tyrosyl radical formation. Collectively, these results demonstrate that enzymatically active C. ammoniagenes RNR is a generic class Ib enzyme, with a tyrosyl radical and a diferric metal cofactor."

Farnesylation has been shown to be a prerequisite to, but by itself not sufficiently strong for, full Ha-Ras membrane binding (7.Willumsen B.M. Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E.

This second lipid is the fatty acid palmitate (10.Buss J.E. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell.

Acylation of Ha-Ras is dynamic, with the palmitates having a half-life considerably shorter than the polypeptide and undergoing repeated cycles of removal and replacement (13.Lu J.-Y. Hofmann S.L. J.

Very little is known of how this S-acyl modification occurs or of its possible regulation, in part because purification of enzymes that might attach palmitate has proven to be difficult (15.Liu L.

Further, no structural motifs or signal sequences for palmitoylation have been identified (7.Willumsen B.M. Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1901-1909PubMed Google Scholar). Only recently has a cytosolic acyl-protein thioesterase (APT1) been isolated that can remove palmitate from heterotrimeric G protein α-subunits and from Ha-Ras in vitro (19.Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Despite the transience of a thioacyl group, the presence of cysteines that can be palmitoylated dramatically increases the extent of farnesylated Ha-Ras membrane binding from ∼10% to >95% (7.Willumsen B.M. Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1901-1909PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Cadwallader K.A. Paterson H. MacDonald S.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4722-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).For Ha-Ras, palmitoylation and plasma membrane targeting are clearly necessary for biological activity, because Ha-Ras mutants that lack both palmitates are poorly transforming in NIH 3T3 cells (7.Willumsen B.M. Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1901-1909PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Dudler T. Gelb M.H. J. Biol.

Furthermore, an Ha-Ras that has only one site for palmitoylation is partially misdirected to internal membranes and is only weakly active (7.Willumsen B.M. Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1901-1909PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, permanent interference with palmitoylation decreases Ha-Ras function. These results suggest that regulation of palmitoylation could provide a novel approach for controlling Ha-Ras oncogenicity.There is growing evidence (11.Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys.

However, the relationships between palmitoylation, submembrane location, and signaling by any of these proteins (26.Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) are difficult to study, since there are few techniques through which the acylation state of such signaling proteins can be varied.In a small number of palmitoylated proteins, acylation can be regulated by agonist stimulation (27.Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Isoproterenol interaction with the β-adrenergic receptor results in activation of the receptor and of the Gsα subunit, and this activation correlates with increased palmitate turnover on both the receptor and the Gsα protein (28.Mumby S.M.

Serotonin treatment of membranes derived from rat brain cells is reported to increase palmitate labeling of a number of G protein α-subunits (Gq, Go, Gi, and Gs) (33.Bhamre S. Wang H.Y. Friedman E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 286: 1482-1489Google Scholar), and agonist-promoted palmitate exchange has been reported for Gqα (34.Stanislaus D. Janovick J.A. Brothers S. Conn P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 738-746PubMed Google Scholar). For these Gα proteins, deacylation appears to be an important regulated step in changes that occur in response to ligand. In endothelial cells, a bradykinin-triggered increase in depalmitoylation of the endothelial nitric-oxide synthase has been observed, coincident with activation of the protein (35.Yeh D.C. Duncan J.A. Yamashita S. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33148-33154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 36.Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Thus, palmitoylation of some proteins is, through as yet unknown mechanisms, responsive to external signals. However, for Ha-Ras proteins, no changes in palmitoylation following the rapid and transient activation of growth factor-dependent pathways have been reported. The compound 2-bromo-palmitate has recently been reported to decrease palmitate labeling of the Src family kinases Fyn and Lck but had very little effect on membrane binding of an Ha-Ras protein (37.Webb Y. Hermida-Matsumoto L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar).Another agent that may affect protein palmitoylation is nitric oxide (NO⋅ or its metabolites, NOx). The nitrosothiol compoundS-nitrosocysteine (SNC)1 has been reported to cause a decrease in palmitate incorporation into many proteins in neuronal cells (38.Hess D.T. Lin L.-H. Freeman J.A. Norden J.J. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1283-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) Two of these proteins were identified as the synaptic vesicle protein, SNAP-25, and the growth cone-associated protein, GAP-43. This work suggested that S-acylation of neuronal growth cone proteins could be manipulated by exogenous exposure of neurons to nitric oxide or NOx-producing compounds.Recent studies have reported that activation of Ras proteins can also be affected by nitric oxide. In the Jurkat T cell line, and especially in Jurkat cells depleted of glutathione by buthionine sulfoximine treatment, more of the endogenous Ras proteins were reported to be GTP-bound after exposure to nitric oxide (39.Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.G.A. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In vitrostudies also indicated that the cysteine at position 118 becomes nitrosylated during treatment of recombinant Ha-Ras with nitric oxide or SNC (40.Lander H.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Campbell S. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4323-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Additionally, in rat and mouse cortical neuron cultures, the endogenous Ras proteins were reported to bind increased amounts of GTP after exposure to NOx donors or stimulation of nitric-oxide synthase activity by N-methyl-d- aspartate (41.Yun H.-Y. Gonzalez-Zulueta M. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5773-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These results indicated that Ras itself and/or proteins that regulate its GTP state were susceptible to nitric oxide or its metabolites (42.Mott H.R. Carpenter J.W. Campbell S.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3640-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, no information on the effects of nitric oxide or other oxidants on Ha-Ras palmitoylation has been reported.This study was designed to determine if effects of nitric oxide on protein palmitoylation could also be observed in cells other than neurons and specifically whether palmitoylation of the Ha-Ras protein could be influenced by compounds that produce nitric oxide or its metabolites. The results identify S-nitrosocysteine and characterize parameters for its effective use as the first method for deliberate, external manipulation of palmitoylation of Ha-Ras. Ha-Ras is a monomeric GTPase that has two types of lipid modifications, both of which must occur in order for the protein to bind efficiently to the plasma membrane (1.Cox A.D. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Rev. Cancer. 1997; 1333: F51-F71Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 2.Kato K. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1992; 3: 179-188PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Lowy D.R.

A C15 farnesyl isoprenoid is attached through a permanent thioether linkage to cysteine 186 at the C terminus (4.Gelb M.H. Scholten J.D. Sebolt-Leopold J.S. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Farnesylation has been shown to be a prerequisite to, but by itself not sufficiently strong for, full Ha-Ras membrane binding (7.Willumsen B.M. Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1901-1909PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Dudler T. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11541-11547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9.Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Ha-Ras requires a second lipid to stabilize its membrane interaction. This second lipid is the fatty acid palmitate (10.Buss J.E. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), attached through thioester bonds to cysteine 181 or 184 (11.Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 12.Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Acylation of Ha-Ras is dynamic, with the palmitates having a half-life considerably shorter than the polypeptide and undergoing repeated cycles of removal and replacement (13.Lu J.-Y. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7251-7256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14.Magee A.I. Gutierrez L. McKay I.A. Marshall C.J. Hall A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3353-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Very little is known of how this S-acyl modification occurs or of its possible regulation, in part because purification of enzymes that might attach palmitate has proven to be difficult (15.Liu L. Dudler T. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23269-23276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 16.Liu L. Dudler T. Gelb M.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22399-22405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Further, no structural motifs or signal sequences for palmitoylation have been identified (7.Willumsen B.M. Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1901-1909PubMed Google Scholar). Only recently has a cytosolic acyl-protein thioesterase (APT1) been isolated that can remove palmitate from heterotrimeric G protein α-subunits and from Ha-Ras in vitro (19.Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Despite the transience of a thioacyl group, the presence of cysteines that can be palmitoylated dramatically increases the extent of farnesylated Ha-Ras membrane binding from ∼10% to >95% (7.Willumsen B.M. Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1901-1909PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Cadwallader K.A. Paterson H. MacDonald S.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4722-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For Ha-Ras, palmitoylation and plasma membrane targeting are clearly necessary for biological activity, because Ha-Ras mutants that lack both palmitates are poorly transforming in NIH 3T3 cells (7.Willumsen B.M. Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1901-1909PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Dudler T. Gelb M.H. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4722-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an Ha-Ras that has only one site for palmitoylation is partially misdirected to internal membranes and is only weakly active (7.Willumsen B.M. Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1901-1909PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, permanent interference with palmitoylation decreases Ha-Ras function. These results suggest that regulation of palmitoylation could provide a novel approach for controlling Ha-Ras oncogenicity. There is growing evidence (11.Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 21.Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8012) Google Scholar, 22.Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G.

However, the relationships between palmitoylation, submembrane location, and signaling by any of these proteins (26.Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) are difficult to study, since there are few techniques through which the acylation state of such signaling proteins can be varied. In a small number of palmitoylated proteins, acylation can be regulated by agonist stimulation (27.Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Isoproterenol interaction with the β-adrenergic receptor results in activation of the receptor and of the Gsα subunit, and this activation correlates with increased palmitate turnover on both the receptor and the Gsα protein (28.Mumby S.M. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2800-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 29.Loisel T.P. Adam L. Hebert T.E. Bouvier M.

Serotonin treatment of membranes derived from rat brain cells is reported to increase palmitate labeling of a number of G protein α-subunits (Gq, Go, Gi, and Gs) (33.Bhamre S. Wang H.Y. Friedman E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 286: 1482-1489Google Scholar), and agonist-promoted palmitate exchange has been reported for Gqα (34.Stanislaus D. Janovick J.A. Brothers S. Conn P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 738-746PubMed Google Scholar). For these Gα proteins, deacylation appears to be an important regulated step in changes that occur in response to ligand. In endothelial cells, a bradykinin-triggered increase in depalmitoylation of the endothelial nitric-oxide synthase has been observed, coincident with activation of the protein (35.Yeh D.C. Duncan J.A. Yamashita S. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33148-33154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 36.Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Thus, palmitoylation of some proteins is, through as yet unknown mechanisms, responsive to external signals. However, for Ha-Ras proteins, no changes in palmitoylation following the rapid and transient activation of growth factor-dependent pathways have been reported. The compound 2-bromo-palmitate has recently been reported to decrease palmitate labeling of the Src family kinases Fyn and Lck but had very little effect on membrane binding of an Ha-Ras protein (37.Webb Y. Hermida-Matsumoto L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Another agent that may affect protein palmitoylation is nitric oxide (NO⋅ or its metabolites, NOx). The nitrosothiol compoundS-nitrosocysteine (SNC)1 has been reported to cause a decrease in palmitate incorporation into many proteins in neuronal cells (38.Hess D.T. Lin L.-H. Freeman J.A. Norden J.J. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1283-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) Two of these proteins were identified as the synaptic vesicle protein, SNAP-25, and the growth cone-associated protein, GAP-43. This work suggested that S-acylation of neuronal growth cone proteins could be manipulated by exogenous exposure of neurons to nitric oxide or NOx-producing compounds. Recent studies have reported that activation of Ras proteins can also be affected by nitric oxide. In the Jurkat T cell line, and especially in Jurkat cells depleted of glutathione by buthionine sulfoximine treatment, more of the endogenous Ras proteins were reported to be GTP-bound after exposure to nitric oxide (39.Lander H.M.

In vitrostudies also indicated that the cysteine at position 118 becomes nitrosylated during treatment of recombinant Ha-Ras with nitric oxide or SNC (40.Lander H.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L.

This process requires the formation of a ternary complex (EF-Tu·GTP·aa-tRNA). EF-Tu is released from the ribosome as an EF-Tu·GDP complex. Exchange of GDP for GTP is carried out through the formation of a complex with EF-Ts (EF-Tu·Ts). Mammalian mitochondrial EF-Tu (EF-Tumt) differs from the corresponding prokaryotic factors in having a much lower affinity for guanine nucleotides. To further understand the EF-Tumt subcycle, the dissociation constants for the release of aa-tRNA from the ternary complex (K tRNA) and for the dissociation of the EF-Tu·Tsmt complex (K Ts) were investigated. The equilibrium dissociation constant for the ternary complex was 18 ± 4 nm, which is close to that observed in the prokaryotic system. The kinetic dissociation rate constant for the ternary complex was 7.3 × 10−4 s−1, which is essentially equivalent to that observed for the ternary complex inEscherichia coli. The binding of EF-Tumt to EF-Tsmt is mutually exclusive with the formation of the ternary complex. K Ts was determined by quantifying the effects of increasing concentrations of EF-Tsmt on the amount of ternary complex formed with EF-Tumt. The value obtained for K Ts(5.5 ± 1.3 nm) is comparable to the value ofK tRNA. Elongation factor (EF) Tu promotes the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) to the acceptor site of the ribosome.

In this model, the active form of elongation factor (EF)1 Tu (the EF-Tu·GTP complex) binds aa-tRNA, forming a ternary complex. This ternary complex promotes the binding of aa-tRNA to the A-site of the ribosome. Once locked into the A-site by cognate codon-anticodon interactions, the GTP in the ternary complex is hydrolyzed, and EF-Tu is released from the ribosome as an EF-Tu·GDP complex. This complex must be dissociated by EF-Ts through the formation of an intermediate EF-Tu·Ts complex. GTP then replaces EF-Ts, reforming the active form of EF-Tu. The equilibrium dissociation constant governing the affinity ofE. coli EF-Tu for GDP is 8 nm, compared with 0.3 μm for GTP (1.Miller D. Weissbach H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 38: 1016-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The dissociation of the EF-Tu·GDP complex is thought to be the rate-limiting step in the recycling of EF-Tu (1.Miller D. Weissbach H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 38: 1016-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). EF-Ts promotes the exchange of the tightly bound GDP for GTP through the formation of an intermediate EF-Tu·Ts complex. Presumably one of the reasons for the requirement for EF-Ts is because of the 40-fold higher affinity of EF-Tu for GDP compared with GTP. E. coli EF-Tu and EF-Ts have a high affinity for each other; the dissociation constant for the E. coli EF-Tu·Ts complex (K Ts) is 2 nm (2.Miller D. Weissbach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 141: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, under intracellular conditions in E. coli, the EF-Tu·Ts complex appears to have a transient existence. The EF-Tu·Ts complex is rapidly converted to the ternary complex by high intracellular concentrations of GTP and by the tight binding of aa-tRNA to the EF-Tu·GTP complex. The dissociation constant for the release of aa-tRNA from the ternary complex is ∼1 nm in E. coli (3.Louie A. Jurnak F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6433-6439Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). EF-Tu is a highly conserved protein. Mammalian mitochondrial EF-Tu (EF-Tumt) has significant sequence identity (∼55–60%) to the corresponding prokaryotic factors. Furthermore, structural analysis of bovine EF-Tumt indicates that the mammalian mitochondrial factor folds into a three-dimensional structure similar to that observed with E. coli and Thermus thermophilus EF-Tu (4.Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Clark B.F.C. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1347-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 5.Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. J. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 297: 421-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The sequence of EF-Ts is less conserved than that of EF-Tu, and distinct schemes are observed for the interaction of EF-Tu and EF-Ts in different systems. In T. thermophilus, a heterotetrameric complex ((EF-Tu·Ts)2) occurs through the interaction of two EF-Tu molecules with a stable EF-Ts dimer (8.Blank J. Nock S. Kreutzer R. Sprinzl M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Unlike the E. coliEF-Tu·Ts complex, the T. thermophilus complex is not dissociated to a significant extent by either GDP or GTP alone (9.Arai K.-I. Ota Y. Nakamura S. Hennele C. Oshima T. Kaziro Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). No elongation factor equivalent to EF-Ts has been identified in yeast mitochondria or in the complete sequence of the yeast genome, perhaps reflecting the observation that yeast EF-Tumt has a very low affinity for guanine nucleotides (10.Rosenthal L. Bodley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10955-10959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the E. coli EF-Tu·Ts complex, the bovine liver EF-Tu·Tsmt complex cannot be dissociated in the presence of high concentrations of guanine nucleotides (11.Schwartzbach C. Spremulli L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19125-19131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation is due, at least in part, to a low affinity of EF-Tumt for GDP and GTP. The equilibrium dissociation constants for the EF-Tumt·GDP and EF-Tumt·GTP complexes are ∼2 orders of magnitude higher than those observed for E. coli EF-Tu. 2Y.-C. Cai, J. M. Bullard, N. L. Thompson, and L. L. Spremulli, submitted for publication. 2Y.-C. Cai, J. M. Bullard, N. L. Thompson, and L. L. Spremulli, submitted for publication. However, in the presence of GTP and aa-tRNA, the EF-Tu·Tsmt complex dissociates, and a classical ternary complex is observed (13.Schwartzbach C. Spremulli L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16324-16330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Woriax V. Bullard J. Ma L. Yokogawa T. Spremulli L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1352: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, the basic steps of the bacterial elongation cycle appear to occur in mammalian mitochondria. However, the equilibrium constants that govern the interaction of EF-Tumt with EF-Tsmtand with guanine nucleotides appear to be significantly different. To facilitate the understanding of the translational elongation cycle in mammalian mitochondria, the equilibrium dissociation constants governing the release of aa-tRNA from the ternary complex and the dissociation of the EF-Tu·Tsmt complex are reported here. Buffer I was composed of 8 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 76 mm KCl, 6.8 mmMgCl2, 5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 3.4 units of pyruvate kinase, and 0.5 mm GTP. Buffer II was composed of 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. EF-Tumt and EF-Tsmtexpressed in E. coli as His-tagged proteins were purified as described previously (15.Woriax V. Burkhart W. Spremulli L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). EF-Tsmt was further purified by incubating the sample (prepared from 6 liters of cell culture) with 150 μl of DEAE-cellulose resin for 15 min at 4 °C. The DEAE-cellulose resin was removed by centrifugation in an Eppendorf tube at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, and EF-Tsmt remained in the supernatant. To determine an accurate protein concentration, ∼950 pmol of EF-Tsmt (determined by the micro-Bradford method) in buffer II (90 μl) were denatured in 6 m guanidinium chloride (total of 300 μl) by incubation at 50 °C for at least 5 h (16.Elwell M.L. Schellman J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 494: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The concentration of EF-Tsmt was then calculated from the absorbance of the sample at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 38,370 m−1cm−1, calculated by the procedure of Gill and von Hippel (17.Gill S. von Hippel P. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). Ternary complex formation was monitored by taking advantage of the ability of EF-Tumt to protect [14C]Phe-tRNAPhe from digestion by RNase A. Reaction mixtures were incubated with the indicated amounts of EF-Tumt and [14C]Phe-tRNA in buffer I on ice for 20 min. The GDP present in the EF-Tumt preparations was converted to GTP by phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase during this incubation. The reaction was stopped by treating with RNase A (40 μg/ml), incubating for 30 s on ice, and adding 3 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate was collected after 10 min on ice by filtering through nitrocellulose membrane filters to test for the amount of [14C]Phe-tRNA remaining (18.Benkowski L. Takemoto C. Ott G. Beikman M.

Chem. 1984; 259: 5010-5016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RNase A concentration was optimized by dosing RNase A in reactions containing 10 pmol of [14C]Phe-tRNA. The percentage of EF-Tumt active in forming ternary complexes was determined by increasing the concentration of [14C]Phe-tRNA to saturating levels (1 μm) in 50-μl reaction volumes while keeping the concentration of EF-Tumt at 0.2 μm and the concentration of GTP at 0.5 mm. A blank representing the amount of [14C]Phe-tRNA remaining after nuclease digestion was done at each [14C]Phe-tRNA concentration. This blank (<0.5 pmol) was used to correct for variations in RNase activity at different concentrations of [14C]Phe-tRNA. The maximal concentration of ternary complex detected was assumed to be equivalent to the concentration of EF-Tumt capable of forming ternary complexes. The equilibrium dissociation constant governing the release of [14C]Phe-tRNA from the ternary complex was determined using a range of EF-Tumt (0.02–1 μm) and [14C]Phe-tRNA (0.04–0.09 μm) concentrations. The concentrations given reflect only the active EF-Tumt in each preparation. The effects of spermine (0.5–2.0 μm) and spermidine (16–64 μm) on ternary complex formation were examined by incubating these reagents with EF-Tu (0.4 μm) and [14C]Phe-tRNA (∼0.06, 0.1, and 0.15 μm) as described above. The kinetic dissociation rate for the ternary complex EF-Tumt·GTP·Phe-tRNA was measured as described (3.Louie A. Jurnak F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6433-6439Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this reaction, 0.015 μm [14C]Phe-tRNA and 0.015 μm EF-Tumt were incubated with 10, 100, and 500 μm GTP separately in 6.5 ml of buffer I as described above. After incubation on ice for 15 min, RNase A (40 μg/ml) was added. The dissociation of [14C]Phe-tRNA was monitored by removing aliquots (0.5 ml) at different times (30 s to 6 min). The amount of ternary complex remaining was determined as described above. The equilibrium dissociation constant governing the EF-Tu·Tsmt complex was determined by competition with ternary complex formation. EF-Tumt (1 μm) was combined with different concentrations of EF-Tsmt (0.2–6 μm) in buffer II (100 μl). Aliquots (10 μl) were diluted 5-fold with buffer I containing different concentrations of [14C]Phe-tRNA (providing final concentrations of Phe-tRNA from 0.06 to 1.4 μm). An additional series of samples (in 50 μl of buffer I) was prepared containing 2.1 μm [14C]Phe-tRNA, 0.1 μm EF-Tumt, and various concentrations of EF-Tsmt (0.03–0.7 μm). All samples were incubated on ice for 20 min. RNase A (2 μg for <0.6 μm[14C]Phe-tRNA and 5 μg for >0.6 μm[14C]Phe-tRNA) was then added, and the samples were incubated for 30 s on ice. The nuclease reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 ml of cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the amount of [14C]Phe-tRNA protected by EF-Tumt was measured as described above. The maximal concentration of ternary complex detected was assumed to be equivalent to the concentration of EF-Tumt in the EF-Tu·Tsmt mixtures capable of forming ternary complexes. The function of EF-Tu is to guide aa-tRNA into the A-site of the ribosome. This step requires the formation of a ternary complex composed of EF-Tu, aa-tRNA, and GTP. Since EF-Tumt forms functional ternary complexes with aa-tRNAs from E. coli, we used E. coliPhe-tRNAPhe to measure the equilibrium dissociation constant governing the ternary complex formed with EF-Tumt(13.Schwartzbach C. Spremulli L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16324-16330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of ternary complex present at different concentrations of EF-Tumt and Phe-tRNA was measured by a ribonuclease protection assay (18.Benkowski L. Takemoto C. Ott G. Beikman M. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Sprinzl M. Spremulli L. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1995; 33: 163-166Google Scholar, 20.Pingoud A. Urbanke C. Krauss G. Peters F. Maass G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The time course of ternary complex formation indicated that the formation of these complexes was complete in <1 min under the conditions used (data not shown). However, we routinely used a 15-min incubation for ternary complex formation to ensure that the reactions reached equilibrium and to simplify processing. Since aa-tRNA can deacylate over time by the hydrolysis of the ester bond between the amino acid and the tRNA, the percentage of the radiolabel present as [14C]Phe-tRNA in the preparations was monitored using a trichloroacetic acid precipitation assay. In some preparations, as much as 30% of the [14C]Phe-tRNA had undergone spontaneous hydrolysis to free [14C]Phe and tRNA. Essentially all of the [14C]Phe-tRNA remaining in each preparation could be protected from RNase digestion in the presence of excess EF-Tumt, indicating that essentially 100% of the [14C]Phe-tRNA was active in ternary complex formation (data not shown). This value was determined in each experiment and used to calculate the concentration of Phe-tRNA present. The percentage of EF-Tumt active in ternary complex formation was measured by dosing the amount of Phe-tRNA added to a constant concentration of EF-Tumt (Fig.1). In the presence of excess Phe-tRNA, the maximal concentration of ternary complex detected is equivalent to the concentration of EF-Tumt capable of binding to Phe-tRNA. These assays indicated that ∼30% of the EF-Tumt in most preparations was active in ternary complex formation. A similar observation has been made for the native EF-Tumt obtained from bovine liver (18.Benkowski L. Takemoto C. Ott G. Beikman M. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Sprinzl M. Spremulli L. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1995; 33: 163-166Google Scholar), indicating that this value is not the result of the use of recombinant EF-Tumt. In E. coli, ∼80% of the EF-Tu is capable of binding GDP, whereas only 30–40% can form ternary complexes (3.Louie A. Jurnak F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6433-6439Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The underlying reason for this difference is not known. In subsequent discussions, the EF-Tumt that is capable of binding aa-tRNA is denoted EF-Tu(1)mt, and the EF-Tumt that is not capable of binding aa-tRNA is denoted EF-Tu(2)mt. In E. coli, GTP can bind free EF-Tu, whereas aa-tRNA cannot bind to EF-Tu in the absence of GTP (21.Miller D. Weissbach H. Weissbach H. Pestka S. Molecular Mechanisms of Protein Biosynthesis. Academic Press, New York1977: 323-373Crossref Google Scholar). Previous work indicates that a similar sequence of events occurs in the mammalian mitochondrial system (14.Woriax V. Bullard J. Ma L. Yokogawa T. Spremulli L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1352: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Hence, in the analysis carried out here, EF-Tumt is assumed to bind to GTP first, followed by the binding of aa-tRNA. The formation of the ternary complex is then described by the following two coupled reactions (Equations 1 and2). EF­Tu(1) mt+GTP⇌EF­Tu(1) mt⋅GTPEquation 1 EF­Tu(1) mt·GTP+aa­tRNA⇌EF­Tu(1) mt·GTP·aa­tRNAEquation 2 The equilibrium dissociation constants controlling these two steps are as follows (Equations 3 and 4). KGTP=[EF­Tu(1) mt][GTP][EF­Tu(1) mt·GTP]Equation 3 KtRNA=[EF­Tu(1) mt·GTP][aa­tRNA][EF­Tu(1) mt·GTP·aa­tRNA]Equation 4 The total concentration of aa-tRNA is given by Equation 5. [aa­tRNA] t=[aa­tRNA]+[EF­Tu(1) mt·GTP·aa­tRNA]Equation 5 In the assays described here, the concentration of GTP was 0.5 mm, which was much greater than the concentrations of EF-Tumt (<0.4 μm) and aa-tRNA (<1 μm). At such high GTP concentrations, >96% of the EF-Tumt binds to GTP as determined by the value ofK GTP (18 μm) in the absence of aa-tRNA.2 Therefore, it was assumed that no free EF-Tumt was present in these assays. Under these conditions, the total concentration of EF-Tu(1)mt is given by Equation 6. [EF­Tu(1) mt] t=[EF­Tu(1) mt·GTP]+[EF­Tu(1) mt·GTP·aa­tRNA]Equation 6 The dissociation constant governing the ternary complex was determined by measuring the concentration of the ternary complex, [EF-Tu(1)mt·GTP·Phe-tRNA], formed at various total concentrations of EF-Tu(1)mt and Phe-tRNA (Fig.2). [EF-Tu(1)mt·GTP·Phe-tRNA] was determined by the RNase A protection assay. [EF-Tu(1)mt]t was determined by the concentration of EF-Tumt active in forming the ternary complex, which was measured in each assay by the approach described above. These values then permitted calculation of [EF-Tu(1)mt·GTP] (Equation 6). [Phe-tRNA]twas determined from the amount of ternary complex formed at saturating concentrations of EF-Tumt for each Phe-tRNA concentration or by the trichloroacetic acid precipitation method. Free [Phe-tRNA] was calculated from the values of [Phe-tRNA]t and [EF-Tu(1)mt·GTP·Phe-tRNA] using Equation 5.K tRNA was then calculated using Equation 4. The equilibrium dissociation constant for the ternary complex was determined to be 18 ± 4 nm based on 16 independent assays. A representative data set showing the concentration of the ternary complex for a given constant value of [Phe-tRNA]t and as a function of [EF-Tu(1)mt]t is shown in Fig. 2. Equations Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6 imply the following (Equation 7). 2[EF­Tu(1) mt·GTP·aa­tRNA]=[EF­Tu(1) mt] t +[aa­tRNA] t+KtRNA −{([EF­Tu(1) mt] t+[aa­tRNA] t+KtRNA) 2Equation 7 −4[EF­Tu(1) mt] t[aa­tRNA] t} 1/2As shown in Fig. 2, the data agree well with the values of [EF-Tu(1)mt·GTP·Phe-tRNA] as predicted by Equation 7for the known values of [Phe-tRNA]t, [EF-Tu(1)mt]t and K tRNA = 18 nm. The crystal structure of the ternary complex indicates that the backbone of the TψC stem of the aa-tRNA interacts with side chains of EF-Tu through a series of electrostatic contacts (22.Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar, 23.Nissen P. Thirup S. Nyborg J. Nyborg K. Structure. 1999; 7: 143-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Several Lys residues have been reported to play an important role in the formation of the ternary complex (24.Antonsson B. Leberman R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Consequently, ionic conditions are expected to influence the formation of the ternary complex. Polyamines are known to play a role in a number of reactions involving tRNAs (25.Bullard J. Cai Y.-C. Demeler B. Spremulli L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To test the effect of polyamines on the formation of the ternary complex, different concentrations of spermine and spermidine were incubated with limiting concentrations of EF-Tumt and [14C]Phe-tRNA. Spermine inhibited the formation of the ternary complex even at extremely low concentrations (Fig.3 A). Spermidine also had an inhibitory effect on ternary complex formation (Fig. 3 B), although higher concentrations (>10-fold) were needed to have the same inhibitory effect as spermine. This difference may arise from the fact that spermidine has three positive charges, whereas spermine can have four positive charges. Polyamines probably interact with the backbone of the tRNA, masking some of its negative charge and preventing interaction with EF-Tumt. The rate of dissociation of the ternary complex was analyzed using a modification of the RNase protection assay (3.Louie A. Jurnak F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6433-6439Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For these experiments, the ternary complex was allowed to form. Subsequently, RNase A was added to the reaction mixture. As the Phe-tRNA dissociated from the complex, it was rapidly hydrolyzed by the RNase present. This step prevented the reassociation of the Phe-tRNA with EF-Tumtand allowed the quantitation of the amount of ternary complex remaining. Samples were removed at different times after the addition of the RNase, and the ternary complex remaining was measured by cold trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The dissociation of the ternary complex follows first-order kinetics and is described by Equation 8, W(t)=W(0)e−ktEquation 8 where W(t) is the concentration of the ternary complex at time t, W(0) is the initial concentration of the ternary complex, and k is the dissociation rate constant. The natural logarithm of W(t)/W(0) was plotted as a function of time, and the data were analyzed by least-squares linear fits. The dissociation rate constant for the ternary complex was determined from the slope. Three different concentrations of GTP were used (Fig.4). The rate constant was very similar at each concentration since the GTP concentrations were much higher than the EF-Tumt concentrations (at least 600-fold higher). The dissociation rate constant was determined to be (7.3 ± 1.3) × 10−4 s−1. The dissociation rate constant for the ternary complex formed with E. coli EF-Tu and E. coli Phe-tRNAPhe is very similar to that observed with EF-Tumt (17 × 10−4 s−1) (3.Louie A. Jurnak F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6433-6439Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In previous work, the equilibrium dissociation constant for EF-Tumt and a fluorescent analog of GDP, mantGDP, was found to be ∼2 μm.2 Initially, competition experiments between mantGDP and EF-Tsmt for binding to EF-Tumt were undertaken in an effort to obtain an estimate of the equilibrium dissociation constant for the EF-Tu·Tsmt complex (K Ts). However, the affinity of EF-Tsmt for EF-Tumt was too high compared with the affinity of mantGDP for EF-Tumt to allow an accurate determination of K Ts by this method. Therefore, competition between EF-Tsmt and GTP plus Phe-tRNA for binding to EF-Tumt was developed as an approach to determine K Ts. The percentage of EF-Tsmt molecules active in binding EF-Tumt was shown to be close to 100% using gel filtration chromatography and several other methods (data not shown). EF-Tumt was also determined to be fully active in forming the EF-Tu·Tsmt complex using saturating amounts of biotinylated EF-Tsmt and avidin-conjugated beads (data not shown). As described above, free EF-Tumt was generally ∼30% active in forming the ternary complex. However, in the presence of EF-Tsmt, the percentage of EF-Tumt active in ternary complex formation increased. Therefore, it was essential to obtain an estimate of the percentage of EF-Tumt active in ternary complex formation as a function of the concentration of EF-Tsmt. To determine these values, EF-Tumt was incubated with different amounts of EF-Tsmt and then tested for the ability to form ternary complexes at different concentrations of Phe-tRNA. At higher concentrations of Phe-tRNA and saturating concentrations of GTP, EF-Tumt will form the ternary complex instead of forming the EF-Tu·Tsmt complex. The maximal amount of the ternary complex that can be formed reflects the percentage of EF-Tumt active in binding Phe-tRNA in each sample. Plotting the percentage of active EF-Tumt obtained as described above as a function of the amount of EF-Tsmtadded indicated that, in the presence of EF-Tsmt, the percentage of EF-Tumt active in forming the ternary complex increased from 26 to 41% (Fig. 5). This phenomenon was also observed with E. coli EF-Tu in the presence of E. coli EF-Ts (data not shown). This activation of EF-Tumt increased until the ratio of EF-Tumtto EF-Tsmt was ∼1:1. Representative data for the competition between EF-Tsmt and Phe-tRNA for binding EF-Tumt are shown in Fig.6. The amount of ternary complex formed clearly decreases as the concentration of EF-Tsmt is increased. The analysis of these data for the determination ofK Ts was as follows. Depending on the amount of EF-Tsmt present, 30–40% of the EF-Tumt was active in forming the ternary complex. However, all of the EF-Tumt was active in binding to EF-Tsmt. This difference suggests that two forms of EF-Tumt exist in the system at any given concentration of EF-Tsmt. Form 1 of EF-Tumt, denoted EF-Tu(1)mt, is active in binding EF-Tsmt and in forming the ternary complex. Form 2 of EF-Tumt, denoted EF-Tu(2)mt, is active in forming the EF-Tu·Tsmt complex, but is not active in forming the ternary complex. Previous studies have shown that EF-Tumt is nearly 100% active in guanine nucleotide binding, indicating that EF-Tu(2)mt can bind GTP.2 The possible interactions are described by Equations 1 and 2 and the following three additional equilibria, where n = 1 or 2 (Equations 9 and 10). EF­Tu(n) mt+EF­Tsmt⇌EF­Tu(n)·TsmtEquation 9 EF­Tu(2) mt+GTP⇌EF­Tu(2) mt·GTPEquation 10 The equilibrium dissociation constants are given by Equations 3,4, 11, and 12.

The concentration of free Phe-tRNA was then calculated using Equation 5. Because the value of K tRNA had been determined, the value of [EF-Tu(1)mt·GTP] could then be calculated from Equation 4. The total concentration of GTP (0.50 mm) was much higher than the total concentration of EF-Tumt(≤0.2 μm) or Phe-tRNA (≤2 μm). Therefore, it was assumed that the concentration of free GTP was equal to the total concentration of GTP. [EF-Tu(1)mt] was found from Equation 3 and the previously measured value ofK GTP (Table I). [EF-Tu(1)mt·Tsmt] was then calculated from Equation 14. Equations 11 (with n = 1 and 2), 12, and 15 can be used to find the following expression (Equation 16). [EF­Tu(2)·Tsmt]=[EF­Tu(2) mt] t1+1+[GTP]KGTP [EF­Tu(1) mt·GTP][EF­Tu(1)·Tsmt]Equation 16 which was used to calculate [EF-Tu(2)·Tsmt]. This concentration was then used to calculate [EF-Tsmt] using Equation 13. The equilibrium dissociation constantK Ts was then found from Equation 11 withn = 1. Equations 12 and 15 also imply the following (Equation 17). [EF­Tu(2) mt]=[EF­Tu(2) mt] t−[EF­Tu(2) mt·Ts]1+[GTP]KGTPEquation 17 Using the values of [EF-Tu(2)mt] obtained from Equation 17, K Ts was found using Equation 11with n = 2. These values were equivalent to those calculated from Equation 11 with n = 1. The average value of K Ts determined from 11 independent assays was 5.5 ± 1.3 nm.Table IEquilibrium dissociation constants for EF-Tu from bovine mitochondria and E. coli with guanine nucleotides, Phe-tRNA, and EF-TsEF-TuK GDPK GTPK tRNAK TsRef.μmμmnmnmE. coli0.00770.31.122.Miller D.

Open table in a new tab K Ts for the bovine EF-Tu·Tsmtcomplex is close to that of the E. coli EF-Tu·Ts complex (2 nm) (2.Miller D. Weissbach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 141: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). EF-Tumt binds to EF-Tsmt ∼3-fold more tightly than it binds aa-tRNA in the ternary complex in the presence of excess GTP. Compared with the dissociation constants for guanine nucleotides,K Ts is ∼2 orders of magnitude lower thanK GDP or K GTP. In contrast, in E. coli, the EF-Tu·GDP and EF-Tu·Ts complexes have similar dissociation constants. In this study, the equilibrium dissociation constants governing the interaction of bovine EF-Tumt with its ligands Phe-tRNA and EF-Tsmt have been determined. The classical model for the elongation cycle of protein synthesis is based on studies with E. coli. Generally, the basic steps in the elongation cycle in mammalian mitochondria are the same as those observed in E. coli. However, several of the equilibrium dissociation constants governing the interactions of EF-Tumt with its ligands are quite different from those of its E. coli counterpart (Table I). In E. coli, the dissociation constants for EF-Tu·GDP, EF-Tu·Ts, and EF-Tu·GTP·aa-tRNA are all relatively comparable. In this system, EF-Ts stimulates the dissociation of EF-Tu·GDP, forming the EF-Tu·Ts complex. The EF-Tu·Ts complex is readily dissociated by coupling the formation of the EF-Tu·GTP complex to the formation of the ternary complex. EF-Tu·GDP, EF-Tu·Ts, EF-Tu·GTP, and the ternary complex are all observed as intermediates in the elongation cycle in E. coli. In bovine mitochondria, the elongation cycle also proceeds through these intermediates. However, the binding of guanine nucleotides to EF-Tumt is quite weak compared with the binding of EF-Tsmt or with the binding of aa-tRNA (Table I). Consequently, neither the EF-Tumt·GDP nor the EF-Tumt·GTP complex is readily detected in this system. In both E. coli and bovine mitochondria, EF-Ts and aa-tRNA bind to EF-Tu with nanomolar affinities. However, for E. coli EF-Tu, K GDP is only ∼4-fold higher than K Ts, whereas in bovine mitochondria,K GDP is 2 orders of magnitude higher thanK Ts. Therefore, in mitochondria, the EF-Tumt·GDP complex is readily replaced by the formation of EF-Tu·Tsmt. Although the equilibrium dissociation constants governing the elongation cycle are different in mammalian mitochondria and in prokaryotes, calculations suggest that, under in vivoconditions, the ternary complex will be the major form for EF-Tu in both systems (Fig. 7). Using estimated concentrations of the translational components in E. coliand the known binding constants (Tables I andII), calculations indicate that 90% of the EF-Tu in E. coli will be present in ternary complexes. These estimates are made based on the assumption that aa-tRNAs are free of their cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and that the system is in equilibrium. There is almost a complete absence of free EF-Tu (<0.01%). Although the volume of a typical liver mitochondrion is similar to that of an E. coli cell, the concentrations of the elongation factors in mitochondria are quite different from those found in E. coli (Table II). However, despite the dramatic differences in concentrations, the majority of EF-Tumt(91%) is still estimated to be present in ternary complexes (Fig. 7). The composition of the different intermediates observed with EF-Tumt is thus quite similar to that calculated for theE. coli system. These observations suggest that the weak affinity of EF-Tumt for GTP and its strong interaction with EF-Tsmt do not have a negative effect on the availability of the ternary complex for protein biosynthesis. The bacterial and mitochondrial systems both appear to be designed to operate under conditions in which the ternary complex is readily available and is not limiting for translation.Table IIEstimated amounts and concentrations of translational components in E. coli and bovine liver mitochondriaComponentMammalian mitochondriaE. coli aThe concentration of translational components in E. coli varies considerably with the growth rate of the cell. The values used here are for an intermediate growth rate (a doubling time of ∼40 min). An excellent description of the changes in the concentrations of the translational machinery can be found in Ref. 26. The values for mitochondria are taken from HeLa cells (doubling time of ∼24 h) and from liver and heart (nongrowinng tissues). There is currently no clear indication that these values change significantly with growth rate.Refs.Ribosomes∼80–100 (0.06–0.075 μm)∼25,000 (0.02 mm)27.Cantatore P. Flagella Z. Fracasso F. Lezza A.

We asked whether the inhibitory effect of EGF on secretion is due to activation of specific isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) by PI 3-kinase. Western analysis revealed that PKCα, γ, ε, η, μ, λ/ι, and ζ were expressed in T84 cells. Ro318220 (an inhibitor active against PKCε, 10 μm) but not Gö6983 (an inhibitor active against PKCζ, 10 μm) reversed the inhibitory effect of EGF (100 ng/ml) on carbachol-stimulated chloride secretion. EGF induced the rapid translocation of PKCε from the cytoplasm to the membrane. Wortmannin (50 μm) and LY294002 (20 nm), which are PI 3-kinase inhibitors that by themselves had no effect on PKCε activity, significantly suppressed PKCε translocation activated by EGF. LY294002 also reversed the inhibitory action of EGF on chloride secretion. PI (3,4)P2 increased membrane-associated PKCε and reduced carbachol-induced 86Rb+ efflux. Antisense oligonucleotides against PKCε decreased PKCε mass and prevented the inhibitory effect of EGF on carbachol-induced86Rb+ efflux. Thus, the inhibitory effect of EGF on carbachol-induced chloride secretion involves the activation of PKCε mediated by PI 3-kinase.

Either oversecretion or undersecretion of chloride across epithelia can result in significant pathophysiological events, such as secretory diarrhea or cystic fibrosis, respectively. Therefore, efforts have been made to study chloride secretion at the cellular and subcellular levels to understand the underlying mechanisms involved.The ion transport pathways comprising the chloride secretory mechanism of T84 cells, a line of human colonic epithelial cells with a crypt cell phenotype, have been well defined (3.Dharmsathaphorn K. Mandel K.G. McRoberts J.A. Tisdale L.D. Masui H. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G204-G208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Dharmsathaphorn K. Mandel K.G. Masui H. McRoberts J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 462-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Chloride is taken up across the basolateral membrane of the cells via a Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter (NKCC1) and exits the cell across the apical membrane via chloride channels. At least some of these chloride channels are apparently identical to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. Basolateral potassium channels allow for potassium recycling, whereas energy for the process is supplied by the activity of a basolateral Na+,K+-ATPase. It has been predicted that primary control for the overall transport process occurs at the level of apical chloride channels and basolateral potassium channels, in response to agonists that elevate levels of the positive second messengers for chloride secretion, cyclic nucleotides, or cytosolic calcium. In addition to positive regulation of this process, we have shown that signaling mechanisms intrinsic to the epithelium can also inhibit secretion. Thus, the muscarinic agonist, carbachol (CCh),1 can initially activate secretion in a calcium-dependent fashion and then render cells refractory to additional stimulation. Further, growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) significantly inhibit secretion induced by calcium-dependent agonists, including CCh, without themselves serving as positive effectors of the transport mechanism.The inhibitory pathway utilized by EGF also diverges from that activated by CCh. The CCh-evoked pathway is dependent on an increase in the messenger inositol (3,4,5,6)tetrakisphosphate, whereas that induced by EGF is not (5.Uribe J.M. Gelbmann C.M. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C914-C922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Vajanaphanich M. Schultz C. Rudolf M.T. Wasserman M. Enyedi P. Craxton A. Shears S.B. Tsien R.Y. Barrett K.E. Traynor-Kaplan A. Nature. 1994; 371: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Rather, the inhibitory effect of EGF appears to be due to its ability to stimulate phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase with the production of 3-phosphorylated lipids (7.Uribe J.M. Keely S.J. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26588-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the downstream mediators involved, if any, were unknown. Efflux studies also indicated that EGF reduced calcium-stimulated basolateral86Rb+ but not apical125I− efflux, suggesting that an effect of the growth factor on the basolateral potassium channel constitutes the target of the PI 3-kinase-dependent negative signaling pathway. Activation of protein kinase C, by pretreatment with 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) also inhibits CCh-induced chloride secretion in T84 epithelial cells. CCh has been shown to induce a transient increase in potassium conductance, which could be inhibited by PMA (8.Reenstra W.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C161-C168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that one or several isoforms of PKC could mediate the divergent inhibitory effect of EGF.Pertinent to this possibility, a screening study showed that calcium-independent PKC isoforms were activated by the lipid products of PI 3-kinase (9.Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32358-32367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nakanishi et al. (10.Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that an atypical PKC isoform, PKCζ, was activated by the PI 3-kinase product phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. Furthermore, platelet-derived growth factor stimulated membrane translocation of the novel PKC isoform, PKCε, in HepG2 cells, which was attributable to the ability of platelet-derived growth factor to activate PI 3-kinase (11.Moriya S. Kazlauskas A. Akimoto K. Hirai S. Mizuno K. Takenawa T. Fukui Y. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Ohno S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore, the activity of PI 3-kinase may be important for the regulation of some PKC isoforms, especially those of the novel and atypical families. In the current study, our purpose was to examine whether the inhibitory effect of EGF on CCh-induced chloride secretion is due to the activation of novel and/or atypical isoforms of PKC. We also wanted to determine whether any activation of PKC is a consequence of PI 3-kinase activation.DISCUSSIONAlthough the mechanisms responsible for initiating and maintaining chloride secretory responses in colonic epithelial cells have been well worked out, the mechanisms for inhibiting or terminating such responses are relatively unexplored. It has been predicted that primary control for the overall transport process rests at the level of apical chloride channels and basolateral potassium channels. Therefore, it is important to understand the regulators of signaling pathways that impinge on these ion channels.EGF inhibits calcium-activated chloride secretion evoked by a variety of agonists, including CCh and histamine (23.Kachintorn U. Vajanaphanich M. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Dharmsathaphorn K. Barrett K.E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 109: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of EGF on CCh-induced chloride secretion appears to be due to its ability to activate PI 3-kinase to produce 3-phosphorylated lipids (7.Uribe J.M. Keely S.J. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26588-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, EGF reduced Ca2+-stimulated86Rb+ but not 125I−efflux, indicating its influence on basolateral potassium channels (24.Barrett K.E. Smitham J. Traynor-Kaplan A. Uribe J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C958-C965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work had shown that activation of PKC by PMA also inhibited CCh-induced chloride secretion in T84 cells, that CCh induces a transient increase in basolateral potassium conductance, and that pretreatment with PMA inhibited this potassium conductance (8.Reenstra W.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C161-C168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility of a link between PKC activation and the regulation of a potassium conductance under the influence of PI 3-kinase was thus raised.PI 3-kinase has been shown in other systems to activate novel and atypical PKCs (9.Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32358-32367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of HepG2 cells with platelet-derived growth factor led to the translocation of PKCε via the activation of PI 3-kinase (20.Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanni N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKCζ was also activated by phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (10.Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, PI 3-kinase may be an important regulator of novel and atypical PKCs. We therefore examined whether EGF can activate novel and/or atypical isoforms of PKC in T84cells, and if so, whether the inhibitory effect of EGF on CCh-induced chloride secretion can be attributed to the activation of either or both of these isoforms of PKC. We also wanted to examine whether activation of PKC is a result of PI 3-kinase activation.The current study provides the connection between chloride secretion regulation by EGF and activation of PI 3-kinase by implicating a downstream calcium-independent PKC isoform, namely PKCε. T84 cells express seven PKC isoforms representative of three major classes of PKC isoforms (Fig. 1). Ro318220, but not Gö6983, completely reversed the inhibitory effect of EGF on CCh-induced chloride secretion (Fig. 2), suggesting that PKCε but not PKCζ is likely to play a pivotal role in the inhibitory regulation of chloride secretion. Induction of PKCε translocation by EGF (Fig. 3) further substantiates its role in the inhibition of chloride secretion.Previous findings showed that the ability of EGF to inhibit CCh-induced chloride secretion was completely reversed by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin (7.Uribe J.M. Keely S.J. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26588-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Wortmannin is a somewhat nonspecific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase. Indeed PI 4-kinase, myosin light chain kinase, phospholipase A2, and phospholipase D have all been shown to be inhibited by wortmannin (25.Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 26.Nakanishi S. Kakita S. Takahashi I. Kawahara K. Tsukuda E. Sano T. Yamada K. Yoshida M. Kase H. Matsuda Y. J. Biol.

To exclude the possibilities of nonspecificity, LY294002, a more specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor, was used in the present study. LY294002 reversed the inhibitory effect of EGF on chloride secretory responses to CCh in the present study (Fig. 6). Furthermore, both wortmannin and LY294002 reduced EGF-promoted PKCε translocation in T84 cells (Figs. 4 and 5).PKC activation has been related to the inhibition of a basolateral potassium channel in T84 cells (8.Reenstra W.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C161-C168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in other cells platelet-derived growth factor activates PKCε secondary to the activation of PI 3-kinase. In fact, Tsien et al. (22.Jiang T. Sweeney G. Rudolf M.T. Klip A. Traynor-Kaplan A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 273: 11017-11024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (139) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that a chemically modified PI (3,4,5)P3 (one of the PI 3-kinase products produced in T84 cells in response to EGF (7.Uribe J.M. Keely S.J. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26588-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)), significantly suppressed both CCh-induced chloride secretion in Ussing chambers and CCh-induced86Rb+ efflux in T84 cells. Thus, PKCε could be a downstream effector of PI 3-kinase. However, PI (3,4,5)P3 was unexpectedly unable to stimulate translocation of PKCε in our study, whereas PI (3,4)P2significantly activated PKCε (Fig. 7). The latter phospholipid also inhibited CCh-induced 86Rb+ efflux (Fig. 8). This apparent discrepancy might be attributable to the fact that PI (3,4,5)P3 was previously shown to activate PKCε in a cell-free system (9.Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32358-32367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the concentration and the chemical nature of PI (3,4,5)P3 studied may have contributed to our failure to detect a stimulatory effect of the lipid on PKCε. Tsienet al. (22.Jiang T. Sweeney G. Rudolf M.T. Klip A. Traynor-Kaplan A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 273: 11017-11024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (139) Google Scholar) used a chemically modified PI (3,4,5)P3 at a concentration of 200 μm to achieve an inhibitory effect on chloride secretion in T84cells. The unmodified lipid is likely to be poorly permeable, because there are three phosphate groups attached, and the resulting more polar and bulky phospholipid may be unable readily to penetrate the cytoplasmic membrane. Nevertheless, the data with PI (3,4)P2, at least, suggest that EGF mediates its inhibitory effect on chloride secretion via the activation of PI 3-kinase, which in turn stimulates PKCε via its lipid products.No single pharmacological agent is completely specific for its target. Ro318220 is also a selective inhibitor of calcium-, diterpine-, and phorbol ester-activable PKC isoforms α and ε (18.Johnson M.S. MacEwen D.J. Simpson J. Mitchell R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It also inhibits some PKC-related kinases, such as PRK-1 or PKN (1.Clarke L.L. Boucher R.C. Chung K.F. Barnes P.J. Pharmacology of the Respiratory Tract. Dekker, New York1993: 505-550Google Scholar, 21.Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol.

Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27018-27024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and potentiates the effect of EGF on phospholipase D activity (33.Davis P.D. Hill C.H. Keech E Lawton G. Nixon J.S. Sedgwick A.D. Wadsworth J. Westmacott D. Wilkinson S.E. FEBS Lett. 1989; 259: 61-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In addition, Ro318220 and Gö6983 were shown to inhibit PKCα, β, and γ (17.Gschwendt M. Dieterich S. Rennecke J. Kittstein W. Mueller H.J. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 34.Zhang Y. Akhtar R.A. Curr. Eye Res. 1998; 17: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, conclusions drawn based on the use of Ro318220 could only be speculative. To further verify the role of PKCε, an antisense oligonucleotide approach was employed.Down-regulation of PKCε using antisense oligonucleotide provided convincing evidence for a role of PKCε in inhibition of CCh-induced chloride secretion. Treatment of T84 cells with antisense oligonucleotides to PKCε for 48 h markedly reduced the mass of PKCε (Fig. 9 A). Moreover, a major finding of this study is that these antisense oligonucleotides to PKCε also potently reversed the inhibitory action of EGF on CCh-induced potassium channel opening (Fig. 10). The corresponding sense oligonucleotides were completely without effect on either parameter (Figs. 9 B and 10). These data provide convincing evidence that PKCε mediates the inhibitory effect of EGF on chloride secretion.Chloride secretion induced by CCh in T84 cells could be a consequence of the potassium channel opening on the basolateral side. In fact, CCh induces a transient increase in basolateral potassium conductance, and pretreatment with PMA inhibits the agonist-dependent potassium conductance in T84cells. Boland and Jackson (35.Boland L.M. Jackson K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C100-C110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have also shown that protein kinase C inhibited voltage-gated potassium channel function inXenopus oocytes. These data, in sum, clearly indicate that PKC may be linked to the regulation of potassium conductances. Moreover, activation of PKC isoforms may have regulatory effects on other electrolyte and nonelectrolyte transporters. Long term PMA treatment reduces cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mRNA with a concomitant inhibition of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator chloride channel activity and induces a cytosol-to-membrane translocation of PKCε in human liver epithelial BC1 cells (36.Kang-Park S. Dray-Charier N. Munier A. BrahimiHorn C. Veissiere D. Picard J. Capear J. Cherqui G. Lascols O. J. Hepatol. 1998; 28: 250-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and PKCε specifically regulates the function of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in Calu-3 cells (13.Liedtke C.M. Cole T.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1357-C1364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKCε was also found to be necessary for inhibition of vasopressin-stimulated sodium transport in rabbit cortical collecting duct cells (37.Decoy D.L. Snapper J.R. Breyner M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2749-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it regulates basolateral endocytosis of NKCC1 in T84 cells via effects on F-actin and the cytoskeleton and on a membrane-bound myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (38.Song J.C. Hrnjez B.J. Farokhzad O.C. Matthews J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1239-C1249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Certainly, effects of PKCε on endocytosis could account for the ability of EGF to inhibit chloride secretion, by retrieving basolateral transport proteins, including potassium channels, and thereby reducing secretory capacity. K+channel opening was also previously shown to be regulated by the cytoskeleton (39.Wang W.H. Cassole A. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F592-F598PubMed Google Scholar).In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that PKCε modulates the overall chloride secretory response in T84 cells by interacting directly or indirectly with a basolateral K+channel. We also showed that PKCε is a downstream effector of PI 3-kinase activated by EGF. PKCε plays a central role linking activation of the EGF receptor to the overall regulation of chloride secretion. Although molecular cloning has demonstrated the existence of multiple PKC isoforms, the majority of these isoforms have not yet been well characterized as to their in vivo functions in cell types of the gastrointestinal tract (40.Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biol. Sci. 1994; 18: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 41.Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). This study, at least, demonstrated the importance and the underlying mechanisms of the PI 3-kinase pathway in the regulation of chloride secretion in colonic epithelial cells. In addition, understanding such mechanisms may lead to an ability to interfere with chloride secretion in patients with diarrhea in a more targeted fashion in the future. Chloride secretion plays an important role in regulating water transport across epithelia in various organs (1.Clarke L.L. Boucher R.C. Chung K.F. Barnes P.J. Pharmacology of the Respiratory Tract. Dekker, New York1993: 505-550Google Scholar, 2.Montrose M.H. Keely S.J. Barrett K.E. Yamada T. Alpers D. Laine L. Powell D. Owyang C. Textbook of Gastroenterology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott, Philadelphia, PA1999: 320-354Google Scholar). Either oversecretion or undersecretion of chloride across epithelia can result in significant pathophysiological events, such as secretory diarrhea or cystic fibrosis, respectively. Therefore, efforts have been made to study chloride secretion at the cellular and subcellular levels to understand the underlying mechanisms involved. The ion transport pathways comprising the chloride secretory mechanism of T84 cells, a line of human colonic epithelial cells with a crypt cell phenotype, have been well defined (3.Dharmsathaphorn K. Mandel K.G. McRoberts J.A. Tisdale L.D. Masui H. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G204-G208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Dharmsathaphorn K. Mandel K.G. Masui H. McRoberts J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 462-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Chloride is taken up across the basolateral membrane of the cells via a Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter (NKCC1) and exits the cell across the apical membrane via chloride channels. At least some of these chloride channels are apparently identical to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. Basolateral potassium channels allow for potassium recycling, whereas energy for the process is supplied by the activity of a basolateral Na+,K+-ATPase. It has been predicted that primary control for the overall transport process occurs at the level of apical chloride channels and basolateral potassium channels, in response to agonists that elevate levels of the positive second messengers for chloride secretion, cyclic nucleotides, or cytosolic calcium.

Thus, the muscarinic agonist, carbachol (CCh),1 can initially activate secretion in a calcium-dependent fashion and then render cells refractory to additional stimulation. Further, growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) significantly inhibit secretion induced by calcium-dependent agonists, including CCh, without themselves serving as positive effectors of the transport mechanism. The inhibitory pathway utilized by EGF also diverges from that activated by CCh. The CCh-evoked pathway is dependent on an increase in the messenger inositol (3,4,5,6)tetrakisphosphate, whereas that induced by EGF is not (5.Uribe J.M. Gelbmann C.M. Traynor-Kaplan A.E.

Rather, the inhibitory effect of EGF appears to be due to its ability to stimulate phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase with the production of 3-phosphorylated lipids (7.Uribe J.M. Keely S.J.

However, the downstream mediators involved, if any, were unknown. Efflux studies also indicated that EGF reduced calcium-stimulated basolateral86Rb+ but not apical125I− efflux, suggesting that an effect of the growth factor on the basolateral potassium channel constitutes the target of the PI 3-kinase-dependent negative signaling pathway. Activation of protein kinase C, by pretreatment with 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) also inhibits CCh-induced chloride secretion in T84 epithelial cells. CCh has been shown to induce a transient increase in potassium conductance, which could be inhibited by PMA (8.Reenstra W.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C161-C168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that one or several isoforms of PKC could mediate the divergent inhibitory effect of EGF. Pertinent to this possibility, a screening study showed that calcium-independent PKC isoforms were activated by the lipid products of PI 3-kinase (9.Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that an atypical PKC isoform, PKCζ, was activated by the PI 3-kinase product phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. Furthermore, platelet-derived growth factor stimulated membrane translocation of the novel PKC isoform, PKCε, in HepG2 cells, which was attributable to the ability of platelet-derived growth factor to activate PI 3-kinase (11.Moriya S. Kazlauskas A. Akimoto K. Hirai S. Mizuno K. Takenawa T. Fukui Y. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Ohno S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore, the activity of PI 3-kinase may be important for the regulation of some PKC isoforms, especially those of the novel and atypical families. In the current study, our purpose was to examine whether the inhibitory effect of EGF on CCh-induced chloride secretion is due to the activation of novel and/or atypical isoforms of PKC. We also wanted to determine whether any activation of PKC is a consequence of PI 3-kinase activation. DISCUSSIONAlthough the mechanisms responsible for initiating and maintaining chloride secretory responses in colonic epithelial cells have been well worked out, the mechanisms for inhibiting or terminating such responses are relatively unexplored. It has been predicted that primary control for the overall transport process rests at the level of apical chloride channels and basolateral potassium channels. Therefore, it is important to understand the regulators of signaling pathways that impinge on these ion channels.EGF inhibits calcium-activated chloride secretion evoked by a variety of agonists, including CCh and histamine (23.Kachintorn U.

The inhibitory effect of EGF on CCh-induced chloride secretion appears to be due to its ability to activate PI 3-kinase to produce 3-phosphorylated lipids (7.Uribe J.M. Keely S.J. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26588-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, EGF reduced Ca2+-stimulated86Rb+ but not 125I−efflux, indicating its influence on basolateral potassium channels (24.Barrett K.E. Smitham J. Traynor-Kaplan A. Uribe J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C958-C965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work had shown that activation of PKC by PMA also inhibited CCh-induced chloride secretion in T84 cells, that CCh induces a transient increase in basolateral potassium conductance, and that pretreatment with PMA inhibited this potassium conductance (8.Reenstra W.W.

https://openalex.org/W2065133151,"The structure and function of cytosolic Ca2+-binding proteins containing EF-hands are well understood. Recently, the presence of EF-hands in an extracellular protein was for the first time proven by the structure determination of the EC domain of BM-40 (SPARC (for secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine)/osteonectin) (Hohenester, E., Maurer, P., Hohenadl, C., Timpl, R., Jansonius, J. N., and Engel, J. (1996) Nat. Struct. Biol. 3, 67–73). The structure revealed a pair of EF-hands with two bound Ca2+ ions. Two unusual features were noted that distinguish the extracellular EF-hands of BM-40 from their cytosolic counterparts. An insertion of one amino acid into the loop of the first EF-hand causes a variant Ca2+ coordination, and a disulfide bond connects the helices of the second EF-hand. Here we show that the extracellular EF-hands in the BM-40 EC domain bind Ca2+ cooperatively and with high affinity. The EC domain is thus in the Ca2+-saturated form in the extracellular matrix, and the EF-hands play a structural rather than a regulatory role. Deletion mutants demonstrate a strong interaction between the EC domain and the neighboring FS domain, which contributes about 10 kJ/mol to the free energy of binding and influences cooperativity. This interaction is mainly between the FS domain and the variant EF-hand 1. Certain mutations of Ca2+-coordinating residues changed affinity and cooperativity, but others inhibited folding and secretion of the EC domain in a mammalian cell line. This points to a function of EF-hands in extracellular proteins during biosynthesis and processing in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus.

EF-hands, as present in calmodulin, troponin C, and calcineurin, are responsible for signal transduction by the second messenger Ca2+, leading to the activation or inactivation of numerous and diverse target proteins and thus influencing a wide range of cellular processes (1Klee C.B. Cohen P. Klee C.B. Calmodulin. Elsevier, New York1988: 35-56Google Scholar, 2Pochet R. Lawson D.E. Heizmann C.W. Ca2+-binding Proteins in Normal and Transformed Cells.

Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The term EF-hand was introduced by Kretsinger and Nockolds (5Kretsinger R.H. Nockolds C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3313-3326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in describing the structure of parvalbumin. Two helices (E and F in parvalbumin) flank a loop of 12 amino acids in which the Ca2+ ion is 7-fold coordinated in a pentagonal-bipyramidal arrangement. The Ca2+ ion is coordinated by side chain oxygen atoms at the X, Y, and Z vertices, by a backbone carbonyl at −Y, by a water molecule at −X, and by a carboxylate (mostly glutamate) at −Z, which makes a crucial bidentate interaction with the metal ion (see Fig. 1). This canonical EF-hand structure was subsequently found in a number of proteins of the Ca2+ second messenger system. Usually, EF-hands occur in pairs, although in some cases one or even both EF-hands in a pair may no longer be functional because of mutations of Ca2+-coordinating residues (for reviews see Refs.6McPhalen C.A. Strynadcka N.C.J. James M.N.G. Adv. Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 77-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 7Falke J.J. Drake S.K. Hazard A.L. Peersen O.B. Q. Rev.

Several variations of the canonical Ca2+-binding mode are known. In the S100 subfamily of EF-hand proteins, two amino acids are inserted in the N-terminal EF-hand loop, while the C-terminal EF-hand is of the canonical type. The insertions lead to a rearrangement in the loop, such that the Ca2+ ion is coordinated by backbone carbonyl oxygens at positions X, Y, Z and -Y, with the bidentate ligand at -Z providing the only side chain oxygen atoms (9Szebenyi D.M. Obendorf S.K. Moffat K. Nature. 1981; 294: S327-S332Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Despite the unusual coordination of this site, the affinities of the two EF-hands for Ca2+, e.g. in calbindin D9k, are nearly identical (10Linse S. Brodin P. Drakenberg T. Thulin E. Sellers P. Elmden K. Grundström T. Forsén S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6723-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A further variation of the canonical EF-hand was found in myosin essential light chain. The loop in the first EF-hand of the EF-hand pair also contains two inserted amino acids but at different positions compared with S100 proteins. In essential light chain the insertions result in a more pronounced rearrangement of Ca2+ ligands, with several residues coordinating Ca2+ with both their backbone and side chain oxygens (11Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar,12Houdusse A. Cohen C. Structure. 1996; 4: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Finally, in the Ca2+-binding domain of calpain, the first of the five EF-hands binds Ca2+ noncanonically. This EF-hand lacks the typical side chains at positions X and Y and uses a carbonyl oxygen and a second water molecule instead (13Blanchard H. Grochulski P. Li Y. Arthur S.C. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Cygler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 14Lin G. Chattopadhyay D. Maki M. Wang K.K.W. Carson M. Jin L. Yuen P. Takano E. Hatanaka M. DeLucas L.J.

BM-40 (SPARC (for secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine)/osteonectin) is the only example of an extracellular EF-hand protein that is secreted by virtue of a classic signal peptide and for which a structure determination has proved the presence of EF-hands (15Hohenester E. Maurer P. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 16Hohenester E. Maurer P. Hohenadl C. Timpl R. Jansonius J.N. Engel J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). BM-40 is an abundant glycoprotein and has been suggested to participate in the modulation of cell-matrix interactions, bone mineralization, wound repair, and angiogenesis (17Lane T.F. Sage E.H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). It is highly expressed in some malignant tumors and has been reported to play a crucial role in the tumorigenicity of human melanomas (18Ledda M.F. Adris S. Bravo A.I. Kairiyama C. Bover L. Chernajovsky Y. Mordoh J. Podhajcer O.L. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Developmental anomalies are induced by overexpressing or suppressing BM-40 in nematodes (19Schwarzbauer J.E. Spencer C.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 20Fitzgerald M.C. Schwarzbauer J.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1285-1288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, microinjection of BM-40 RNA, protein, peptides, or antibodies against BM-40 interfere withXenopus embryonic development (21Purcell L. Gruia-Gray J. Scanga S. Ringuette M. J. Exp.

In contrast, deletion of the BM-40 gene in mice resulted in a relatively mild phenoptype, namely late onset cataract formation in the eye, whereas development proceeded normally (23Gilmour D.T. Lyon G.J Carlton M.B. Sanes J.R. Cunningham J.M. Anderson J.R. Hogan B.L. Evans M.J. Colledge W.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1860-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 24Norose K. Clark J.I.

Neurochem. 1999; 73: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) may compensate for several of the reported functions of BM-40 during murine embryonic development. BM-40 is a modular protein built from three domains. A short N-terminal region (domain I), rich in glutamic acid residues, binds several Ca2+ ions with low affinity (K d = 5–10 mm) (31Maurer P. Mayer U. Bruch M. Jenö P. Mann K. Landwehr R. Engel J. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This is followed by a region homologous to follistatin (FS domain) and an autonomously folding C-terminal Ca2+-binding EC domain. A single EF-hand was predicted in the EC domain of BM-40 (32Engel J. Taylor W. Paulsson M. Sage H. Hogan B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6958-6965Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and Ca2+ binding was interpreted as being to a single site (31Maurer P. Mayer U. Bruch M. Jenö P. Mann K. Landwehr R. Engel J. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 33Pottgiesser J. Maurer P. Mayer U. Nischt R. Mann K. Timpl R.

Biol. 1995; 253: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, the structures of the EC domain and the pair of FS and EC domains revealed a pair of EF-hands in the EC domain, each with a bound Ca2+ion (15Hohenester E. Maurer P. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 16Hohenester E. Maurer P. Hohenadl C. Timpl R. Jansonius J.N. Engel J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Both EF-hands in BM-40 are of unusual structure; a one-residue insertion into the Ca2+-coordinating loop of the first EF-hand is accommodated by a cis-peptide bond, which allows a peptide carbonyl to substitute for a Ca2+-binding side chain. This novel variation explained why even sophisticated search algorithms failed to detect both EF-hands in BM-40. The second EF-hand has a canonical pattern of Ca2+-coordinating residues but is circularized by a disulfide bond between the flanking helices. A collagen-binding site in the EC domain of BM-40, which is only active in the presence of Ca2+, has been characterized by an alanine mutagenesis screen (35Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Göhring W. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). One objective of the present investigation was to determine the Ca2+ binding properties of the EF-hands of BM-40. Both the variant and the canonical EF-hand were found to bind Ca2+with high affinity, and there is positive cooperativity between the two EF-hands. In addition, interactions with the neighboring FS domain strongly influence the Ca2+ affinity of the EC domain. Some mutations in the EF-hands designed to abolish Ca2+ binding interfered with protein secretion, indicating an essential role of Ca2+ binding for folding and secretion. The sequence numbering of human BM-40 (36Lankat-Buttgereit B. Mann K. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. Krieg T. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) used starts at the N terminus obtained after cleavage of the signal peptide. Secreted recombinant full-length human BM-40 thus corresponds to amino acid residues 1–286. The designation FS-EC (residues 51–286) is used for the fragment encompassing the FS and EC domains but lacking the N-terminal acidic domain. The EC domain encompasses residues 136–286. The sequence of both EF-hand loops within the EC domain and the point mutations introduced are shown in Fig. 1. The nomenclature for the point mutants includes the domain context, the corresponding EF-hand, and the substitution. For instance, EC-EF1-E234K describes a point mutation introduced in the EC domain in which Glu234 in EF-hand 1 (EF1) occupying position −Z of the pentagonal bipyramid is changed to lysine. The fragment FS-EC-ΔC lacks helix C (residues 196–203) of the EC domain (35Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Göhring W. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The point mutant EC-EF1-E234K was produced by the method of Deng and Nickoloff (37Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) using the transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) and the cDNA encoding the EC domain of human BM-40 (34Maurer P. Hohenadl C. Hohenester E. Göhring W. Timpl R. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The mutation primer 5′-CCCACACCAAGCTGGCGCCACTGCGT contained the change of the GAG codon for Glu234 to the AAG codon of lysine. An additional silent T to G mutation resulted in a novel NarI site which was used to identify mutated clones. Mutagenesis was performed as described by the manufacturer (CLONTECH, CA). Production and purification of full-length BM-40, deletion mutants FS-EC and EC, and mutants BM-40-EF2-D257K and BM-40-EF2-E268K was done as described previously (33Pottgiesser J. Maurer P. Mayer U.

Biol. 1995; 253: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). cDNA fragments (269 base pairs) containing the mutations in EF2 were obtained by KpnI/XhoI restriction cleavages of BM-40-EF2-D257K and BM-40-EF2-E268K (33Pottgiesser J. Maurer P. Mayer U. Nischt R. Mann K. Timpl R. Krieg T. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and were cloned into the cDNA of the EC domain resulting in EC-EF2-D257K and EC-EF2-E268K. The double mutant EC-EF1,2-E234K,E268K was produced by subcloning the 136-base pair NcoI/XhoI fragment of EC-EF2-E268K into EC-EF1-E234K fragment.NheI/XhoI fragments of EC-EF1-E234K, EC-EF2-D257K, EC-EF2-E268K, and EC-EF1,2-E234K,E268K were excised and ligated with the NheI/XhoI restricted episomal expression vector pCEP-Pu (38Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This vector contains the signal peptide of BM-40 and enables the secretion of recombinant protein into the cell culture media. Correct mutagenesis and cloning was verified by cycle sequencing using the Alfexpress DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Human embryonic kidney cells (EBNA-293) were transfected with 20 μg of pCEP-Pu vectors using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) or electroporation. Cells were selected with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium with 10% fetal calf serum for 14 days as described (38Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). For purification of proteins from the cell culture media, cells were maintained under serum-free conditions and culture medium was collected every 2 days. Transfected and nontransfected EBNA-293 cells were trypsinized from confluent plates, and 107 cells were used for isolation of mRNA performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). mRNA concentrations were determined using UV spectroscopy. RT-PCR1 was performed in a one-tube reaction by addition of 1 unit of reverse transcriptase and 1 unit of Taq polymerase in RT-PCR buffer (0.1 mTris/HCl, pH 8.4, 0.5 m KCl, 25 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% gelatin, 6.25% W1, 2.5 mm of each dNTP). After addition of 100 ng of mRNA, 50 pmol of sense primer 5′-GTTCCCAGCACCATGAGGG and 50 pmol of antisense primer 5′-GATCCTCGAGT-TAGATCACAAGATCC reverse transcription was allowed to proceed for 25 min at 37 °C. Five cycles of polymerase chain reaction were then performed at an annealing temperature of 50 °C followed by 30 cycles at an annealing temperature of 65 °C. Denaturation and elongation temperatures were 95 and 72 °C, respectively. Half of the reaction product was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. In controls reverse transcriptase was omitted. Transfected EBNA-293 cells of confluent plates (diameter, 10 cm) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100. Aliquots of serum-free culture medium (1 ml) were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. The pellets were resuspended in reducing sample buffer. Resuspended pellets and cell lysates were subjected to electrophoresis in 15% SDS-PAGE gels according to Laemmli (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose, and blocking was done with 5% milk powder solution. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum against human BM-40 (40Nischt R. Pottgiesser J. Krieg T. Mayer U. Aumailley M. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was used as a primary antibody, and detection was performed with a goat antibody against rabbit IgG coupled to peroxidase (DAKO, Denmark) and the enhanced chemoluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Serum-free cell culture media (about 2.5 liters) were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.6, and subjected to anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose. Elution was performed with a linear salt gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl. After dialysis of pooled fractions, recombinant EC domains were separated on MonoQ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in the same buffer. Elution was done with a linear salt gradient (0– 0.5 m NaCl, containing 2m urea). EC domains eluted in a broad peak between 0.15 and 0.4 m NaCl. Fractions containing the recombinant proteins were pooled and applied to a Sephadex G-75 column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.6, 150 mm NaCl. Final concentration was achieved on a Resource Q column followed by extensive dialysis against the appropriate buffer. Proteins were dialyzed against 5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, or 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (TBS). Protein concentrations were calculated from the absorption at 280 nm as described (34Maurer P. Hohenadl C. Hohenester E. Göhring W. Timpl R. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For the EC domain and EC domain mutants, an extinction coefficient of 1.39 ml mg−1 cm−1 was used (41Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar). CD spectra in the far UV region were recorded in a thermostated quartz cell of 1-mm optical path length in a Jasco 715 CD spectropolarimeter. Spectra were measured with the protein dissolved in the appropriate dialysis buffer, after adding 2 mm CaCl2, and after subsequent addition of 3 mm EDTA. Molar ellipticities [Θ] (expressed in degrees cm2 dmol−1) were calculated on the basis of a mean residue molecular mass of 110 Da. Ten spectra were accumulated to improve the signal/noise ratio. Spectra of buffers were subtracted. The percentage of change in circular dichroism at 222 nm was calculated as Δ[Θ]222 = 100 × ([Θ]Ca − [Θ]EDTA)/[Θ]Ca with [Θ]Ca representing the signal at Ca2+saturation and [Θ]EDTA representing the CD signal in the presence of excess EDTA. Fluorescence was measured with a Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrophotometer in 10-mm pathlength rectangular cells at 25 °C. Intrinsic fluorescence was excited at 280 nm for all recombinant proteins. Emission maxima were between 333 and 337 nm. Spectra were recorded in TBS in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 and after subsequent addition of 4 mm EDTA. The percentage of change in fluorescence intensity at 337 nm was calculated as ΔF 337 = 100 × (F Ca2+ −F EDTA)/F Ca2+with F Ca2+ representing the signal at Ca2+ saturation and F EDTArepresenting the fluorescence signal in the presence of excess EDTA. Ca2+ titrations were performed with the EGTA/CaEGTA buffering system as described by Tsien and Pozzan (42Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). 100 mm EGTA and 100 mm CaEGTA stock solutions were purchased from Molecular Probes. An equilibrium dissociation constant K d = 35 nm for the CaEGTA complex was used for the titrations in TBS. Proteins (about 1 μm) were dissolved in buffer containing 10 mmEGTA, and fluorescence intensity was measured. Defined aliquots of the solution were removed and substituted by the same volume of protein dissolved at the same concentration in 10 mm CaEGTA, thus increasing the free Ca2+ concentration while keeping the protein concentration constant. This was repeated until finally the fluorescence intensity was measured for protein in 10 mmCaEGTA. Alternatively, proteins were dissolved in buffer containing 10 mm EGTA, and small aliquots of 100 mm CaEGTA stock solutions were added. In this instance, fluorescence intensity was corrected for dilution. Recombinant BM-40 mutants with low affinity for Ca2+ (K d>20 μm) were directly titrated with CaCl2 in the absence of EGTA. The degree of saturation Y was calculated from the signal S asY = (S −S 0)/(S Ca −S 0), where S Ca andS 0 represent the signals at Ca2+saturation and zero Ca2+, respectively. Two potential mechanisms for binding of Ca2+ to BM-40 and its mutants were considered. The single-site model describes the change of the measured signal as a function of the binding of a single Ca2+ ion to the protein as shown in the following equation. P+Ca↔KdPCaEquation 1 The degree of saturation Y is then described byY = [Ca]/(K d + [Ca]), where [Ca] represents the free Ca2+ concentration andK d represents the equilibrium dissociation constant. For a protein containing two binding sites, which may be either independent (no cooperativity present) or interacting (cooperativity present), four microscopic equilibrium dissociation constants are needed to fully describe the situation. However, the spectroscopic methods used do not allow for discrimination of Ca2+binding to the individual sites, and thus the four dissociation constants cannot be resolved (44Linse S. Chazin W.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1038-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We therefore used a macroscopic two-site model with two Ca2+-binding sites, in which binding of one Ca2+ is described by the macroscopic equilibrium dissociation constant K D1followed by binding of a second Ca2+ withK D2.P+2Ca↔KD1PCa+Ca↔KD2PCa2Equation 2 This model also allows detection of cooperativity between the two sites. If positive cooperativity is present,K D2 will be less than 4 ×K D1, because the second Ca2+ion binds with higher affinity when the first site is occupied than when it is empty. If there is no positive cooperativity,K D2 will be equal or greater than 4 × K D1. The degree of saturation can be described by Y = ([PCa] + [PCa2])/[Ptot] with [PCa] and [PCa2] representing the concentrations of the corresponding Ca2+-bound protein species and [Ptot] representing the total protein concentration. Assuming that contributions to the fluorescence signal are identical for PCa and PCa2 this equation can be transformed into the following equation.Y=(KD2·[Ca]+[Ca]2)/(KD2·[Ca]+[Ca]2+KD2·KD1)Equation 3 The program COSY (43Eberhard M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1990; 6: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar) or Grafit (Erithacus Software) were used to fit both models to the experimental data with nonlinear least square fit procedures. Cooperativity in a two-site system can be characterized by ΔΔG, which gives the difference in free binding energies between the binding to a given site when the other site is occupied and when the other site is empty. For calculation of this free energy of interaction, ΔΔG, knowledge of the microscopic equilibrium dissociation constants is required. However, these are not directly accessible from Ca2+ titrations. A lower limit of the free energy of interaction ΔΔG can be calculated from the macroscopic K D values with ΔΔG η=1 = −RT ln (4·K D1/K D2) (44Linse S. Chazin W.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1038-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). ΔΔG η=1 is identical to ΔΔG if the microscopic affinity of both sites is identical. If microscopic affinities are not identical, ΔΔG is always smaller than ΔΔG η=1. The affinity of EF-hands for Ca2+varies for the different cytosolic members of the EF-hand family with dissociation constants (K d) ranging from nm to μm values. Our first aim was to determine the affinities of the EF-hands of BM-40. We were unable to obtain BM-40 in a sufficiently Ca2+-free form either by dialysis against EDTA or Chelex-100 or by chromatography on an EDTA-agarose column (data not shown). We therefore used an EGTA/CaEGTA system (42Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) to follow Ca2+ binding. Briefly, this method relies on the use of two stock solutions of 100 mm EGTA and 100 mm CaEGTA, respectively. The latter is exactly titrated using a pH-metric method. Using different ratios of EGTA and CaEGTA, the free Ca2+ concentrations in a solution can be adjusted with high precision to [Ca2+]free =K d × [CaEGTA/EGTA]. Knowledge of the concentrations of residual Ca2+ from buffer solutions and bound to proteins (usually between 1–20 μm) is not necessary because this is buffered by the excess EGTA (normally 10 mm) in the system. For a residual Ca2+concentration of 20 μm the error in the calculated free Ca2+ concentration is less than 2%. The reversible change in intrinsic fluorescence of full-length BM-40 (36Lankat-Buttgereit B. Mann K. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. Krieg T. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was used to monitor Ca2+ binding. A simple model of one Ca2+ ion binding to BM-40 could not sufficiently describe the measured values, which evidently follow a curve with a steeper slope around the midpoint than predicted from the single-site model. An appropriate description was achieved with the two-site model, which enabled the determination of two macroscopicK D values of K D1 = 490 nm and K D2 = 57 nm, respectively (Fig.2 A). The fact thatK D2 is much smaller than 4 ×K D1 clearly demonstrates that positive cooperativity is present because of interaction between the sites. The change in fluorescence of the deletion mutant FS-EC was also investigated in the EGTA/CaEGTA system. Cooperative high affinity binding of Ca2+ to FS-EC was observed (Fig.2 B). The affinity of FS-EC was very similar to that of full-length BM-40 with macroscopic K D values of 470 and 26 nm. This indicates that the acidic domain I does not significantly influence Ca2+ binding to the EC domain. In contrast, removal of both domain I and the FS domain, resulting in the isolated EC domain, strongly decreased Ca2+ affinity. Macroscopic K D values of 11750 and 56 nmwere obtained as best fit parameters for the EC domain (Fig.2 B). Ca2+ affinity is on average 6-fold lower if one compares (K D1 K D2)0.5, which corre"

It allows passive diffusion of small molecules and controls active transport of macromolecules in and out of the nucleus. Of the estimated proteins constituting the NPC, almost all have been identified in the case of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2Doye V. Hurt E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In subsequent studies, their nearest neighborhood was analyzed by characterizing their biochemical organization into subcomplexes or by immunolocalizing them to distinct sites within the structural framework of the NPC (for review, see Ref. 1Stoffler D. Fahrenkrog B. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Following the elucidation of the Ran cycle, which drives vectorial nucleocytoplasmic transport, and the discovery of the shuttling importin/karyopherin-β transport receptor family together with their cargoes, interest is now focusing on the understanding of the actual transport mechanism through the NPCs (for review, see Ref. 3Gorlich D.

Nsp1p is unique compared with other nucleoporins in that it forms two distinct NPC subcomplexes. The first one isolated is the Nsp1p-Nup49p-Nup57p-Nic96p complex involved in nuclear protein import and localized to the nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic face of the central gated channel and to the nuclear basket (11Grandi P.

Nature. 1996; 383: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Taken together, since the Nup82p complex is exclusively localized to the cytoplasmic side of the NPC and interacts with the above-mentioned proteins involved in mRNA transport, its components are likely to play a crucial role in mRNA export steps through the NPCs and possibly release of the transport cargo into the cytoplasm. Nup116p is a nucleoporin that was initially found to be genetically linked to Nsp1p (34Wimmer C. Doye V. Grandi P. Nehrbass U. Hurt E.C.

Nup116p, however, differs from Nup100p and Nup145p-N by harboring an evolutionarily conserved sequence of ∼60 amino acids called the Gle2p-binding sequence (GLEBS), which mediates stable complex formation with Gle2p (41Bailer S.M.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of the NUP98 GLEBS in tissue culture cells results in nuclear retention of poly(A)+ RNA (50Pritchard C.E. Fornerod M. Kasper L.H. van Deursen J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Finally, a role of NUP98 in nuclear export of human immunodeficiency virus-1 Rev was also suggested (51Zolotukhin A.S. Felber B.K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 120-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NUP98, which is preferentially located on the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, could represent a more mobile nucleoporin that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm together with its associated GLE2/RAE1 (48Radu A.

To further understand the function of Nup116p, Nup100p, and Nup145p-N within the structural framework of the NPCs, we aimed to define their physical and functional interaction with other nucleoporins. Previously, we showed that Nup116p is targeted to the NPC via its C-terminal domain (41Bailer S.M. Siniossoglou S. Podtelejnikov A. Hellwig A. Mann M. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1107-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that Nup116p is predominantly localized to the cytoplasmic side of the NPC, where it physically and genetically interacts with the Nup82p-Nsp1p-Nup159p complex via its C-terminal domain including the NRM. Our genetic data support the idea that Nup116p consists of at least three independent functional domains, of which the C-terminal part interacts with the Nup82p complex, the GLEBS with Gle2p/Rae1p, and the GLFG domain with shuttling transport receptors such as the karyopherin-β family. The yeast strains used in this work are listed in TableI.

The HIS3 gene was inserted at the BamHI site. pBluescript-nup116Δ(HIS3) was cut usingXbaI-ApaI to releasenup116Δ(HIS3), which was used to transform the diploid strain RS453. Heterozygous HIS+ transformants were analyzed for correct integration at the NUP116 locus by PCR. After sporulation, haploid nup116Δ(HIS3)progeny were isolated that were temperature-sensitive for growth at 37 °C. Temperature-sensitive alleles of NUP82 mapping in the N-terminal region were generated according to published methods (56Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). A unique NheI site was introduced by PCR just before the putative coiled-coil domain of the NUP82 gene (at codon 521 by changing agt to agc), and the resulting DNA fragments were subcloned into pRS315-pNOP-ProtA. The resulting plasmid was cut at the unique NsiI and NheI sites, which releases a DNA fragment encoding amino acids 108–519 of Nup82p. The gapped vector was transformed into the NUP82 shuffle strain along with PCR fragments encoding amino acids 2–626 of Nup82p that had been amplified under mutagenic conditions (57Vartanian J.P. Henry M. Wain-Hobson S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on SDC-Leu; subsequently, the wild-type plasmid was shuffled out on 5-fluoroorotic acid. 5-Fluoroorotic acid survivors were restreaked on YPD plates and selected for temperature-sensitive growth at 37 °C. Plasmids were isolated from such temperature-sensitive mutants and analyzed further. To detect the Myc tag, the monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody-2 (9E10.3, culture supernatant; Neomarkers, Fremont, CA) was used. To visualize ProtA-tagged proteins, rabbit peroxidase-anti-peroxidase procedure (Dako A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) was used. Ascites fluid of monoclonal antibody 32D6 (a kind gift of J. Aris, University of Florida) was used to detect the C-terminal part of Nsp1p. A rabbit anti-Nup82p antibody 2E. Hurt, unpublished data. was used to visualize Nup82p. The rabbit anti-Nic96p antiserum was as described (11Grandi P. Schlaich N. Tekotte H. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The anti-Nup159p (No. 4) antiserum raised in guinea pig against the repeat region (55Gorsch L.C. Dockendorff T.C. Cole C.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 939-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by C. Cole (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover NH). Purification of ProtA fusion proteins from yeast, SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, expression and localization of GFP fusion proteins in yeast, and mass spectrometric protein identification were done as described earlier (26Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. Luhrmann R. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The procedure used for immunodetection of ProtA-tagged proteins using electron microscopy was described previously (13Fahrenkrog B. Hurt E.C. Aebi U. Pante N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 577Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Minor modifications included spheroplasting using zymolyase for 15 min. To permeabilize the cells, 0.025% Triton X-100 was added to the buffer. The mechanism by which the three related nucleoporins Nup116p, Nup100p, and Nup145p-N (for a schematic drawing of the domain organization, see Fig.1 A), which all share a conserved C-terminal domain, interact with other nucleoporins and thereby perform their function in nucleocytoplasmic transport is unknown. We have previously shown that the C-terminal domain of Nup116p can target GFP to the nuclear pores (41Bailer S.M. Siniossoglou S. Podtelejnikov A. Hellwig A. Mann M. Hur"

Mutants were selected for the inability to grow at pH 7.5 but the ability to grow at pH 5.5. Mutations leading to reduced levels of subunit D in whole cell lysates were excluded from the analysis. Seven mutants were isolated that resulted in pH-dependent growth but that contained nearly wild-type levels of subunit D and nearly normal assembly of the V-ATPase as assayed by subunit A levels associated with isolated vacuoles. Each of these mutants contained 2–3 amino acid substitutions and resulted in loss of 60–100% of proton transport and 58–93% of concanamycin-sensitive ATPase activity. To identify the mutations responsible for the observed effects on activity, 14 single amino acid substitutions and 3 double amino acid substitutions were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and analyzed as described above. Six of the single mutations and all three of the double mutations led to significant (>30%) loss of activity, with the mutations having the greatest effects on activity clustering in the regions Val71–Gly80 and Lys209–Met221. In addition, both M221V and the double mutant V71D/E220V led to significant uncoupling of proton transport and ATPase activity, whereas the double mutant G80D/K209E actually showed increased coupling efficiency. Both a mutant showing reduced coupling and a mutant with only 6% of wild-type proton transport activity showed normal dissociation of the V-ATPase complexin vivo in response to glucose deprivation. These results suggest that subunit D plays an important role in coupling of proton transport and ATP hydrolysis and that only low rates of turnover of the enzyme are required to support in vivo dissociation.

The V1 domain is a 570-kDa peripheral complex composed of eight different subunits (subunits A–H) of molecular mass 70–14 kDa that is responsible for ATP hydrolysis. The V0domain is a 260-kDa integral complex composed of five different subunits (a, d, c, c′, and c“) of 100 to 17 kDa that is responsible for proton translocation. The V-ATPases are structurally and evolutionarily related to the F-ATPases of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria that normally function in ATP synthesis (12.Weber J. Senior A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 13.Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Cross R.L. Duncan T.M. J. Bioenerg.

Biomembr. 1996; 28: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus sequence homology can be detected between the nucleotide-binding subunits of the V-ATPase (A and B) and the nucleotide-binding subunits of the F-ATPase (β and α) (18.Zimniak L. Dittrich P. Gogarten J.P. Kibak H. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9102-9112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Bowman B.J. Allen R. Wechser M.A. Bowman E.J. J. Biol.

A. 1988; 85: 5521-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), although no other sequence similarities have been identified in the remaining subunits. An important question is the mechanism of coupling of proton transport and ATP hydrolysis in the V-ATPases. For the F-ATPases, the availability of high resolution structural data (21.Abrahams J.P.

In this model, ATP hydrolysis within the α3β3head of the F1 domain drives rotation of a central γ subunit, which is tightly linked to a ring of c subunits in the F0 domain. Rotation of the ring of c subunits relative to the a subunit of F0 (which is held fixed relative to the α3β3 head by a peripheral stator) in turn leads to unidirectional proton transport. Central to this coupling mechanism is the role of the γ subunit, which has been shown to rotate relative to α3β3 hexamer (25.Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 26.Sabbert D. Engelbrecht S. Junge W.

In addition, mutations have been identified in the γ subunit that lead to uncoupling of ATP hydrolysis and proton transport by the F-ATPases (31.Shin K. Nakamoto R.K. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20835-20839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Nakamoto R.K. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 867-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas no subunits in the V-ATPase complex show homology to the γ subunit, two subunits (D and E) are predicted from sequence analysis to have a similarly high α-helical content (33.Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 34.Bowman E.J. Steinhart A. Bowman B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1237: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To investigate the possible role of subunit D in coupling within the V-ATPase, random mutagenesis of the gene encoding subunit D in yeast (VMA8(35.Graham L.A. Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15037-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)) was performed. Mutations that lead to significant loss of V-ATPase function in yeast lead to a conditional growth phenotype in which cells are unable to grow at neutral pH (36.Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Wolczyk D.F. Neff N. Goebl M. Stevens T.H. Science. 1990; 250: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 37.Hirata R. Ohsumi Y. Nakano A. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Anraku Y. J. Biol.

Sequencing and analysis of mutants isolated by this procedure together with analysis of subsequent mutations constructed by site-directed mutagenesis have led us to suggest that subunit D plays a role in coupling of proton transport and ATP hydrolysis by the V-ATPases. In addition, we have further analyzed the activity and coupling requirements for in vivo dissociation of the V-ATPase, a process believed to play an important role in regulation of V-ATPase activity in the cell (39.Kane P.M.

Tran35S-label was purchased from ICN Biochemicals. Zymolase 100T was from Sekagaku America Inc. Concanamycin A was purchased from Fluka Chemical Corp. Yeast extract, dextrose, peptone, and yeast nitrogen base were from Difco. Molecular biological reagents were from New England Biolabs, Promega, and Life Technologies, Inc. 9-Amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA) was from Molecular Probes, Inc. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and most were from Sigma. Yeast strain KHY105 (leu2-3, 112, ura3-52,ade6, his4-519,vma8Δ::LEU2) was the generous gift of Dr. Tom Stevens, Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon. Plasmid pKH3203 containing the VMA8 gene subcloned into the shuttle vector pRS316 was also from the Stevens laboratory. Random mutagenesis of VMA8 gene was performed using a PCR-based method as described previously (41.Staples R.R. Dieckmann C.L. Genetics. 1993; 135: 981-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the entire encoding region of VMA8 flanked by additional 5′- and 3′-noncoding sequence (approximately 50 bases in length) in pKH3203 was amplified by PCR under mutagenic conditions. The first 10 cycles of PCR were done in the presence of 0.25 mmMn2+ and 4.25 mm Mg2+. The product was then diluted 1:100 into the same buffer but containing 3 mm Mg2+ in the absence of Mn2+ and amplified for another 30 cycles. The PCR products were purified using a Qiagen PCR purification kit. Site-directed mutagenesis of the VMA8 gene was performed using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. The following mutagenesis oligonucleotides were employed to introduce the indicated mutations: R198G, GATGAGTTGGACGGAGAAGAATTTT; L149V, TTTAGTTGAAGTAGCCTCTTT; M221V, GGATGCTGAGGTGAAATTGAA; V71D, TTGGCCGAAGATTCCTATGCA; L106M, TGGTGTGTATATGTCTCAATT; P179S, CACGTTATTATCTCAAGAACTGAAA; D249G, CATTGGTTGCTGGTCAAGAAGACGA; V104E, AACGTTAGTGGTGAGTATTTGTCTCA; E220V, TTGGATGCTGTGATGAAATTG; K210E, CCAAGAAAAGGAGCAAAATGA; G80D, GAAAACATTGACTATCAAGTG; N100I, CGTCAAGAAATCGTTAGTGGT; K209E, AGGTCCAAGAAGAGAAGCAAAAT; D218V, TGCAAAATTGGTTGCTGAGATGA; and I188N, AATTGCTTACAATAACAGTGAGT. All mutations (underlined) were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The PCR products ofVMA8, which were produced under the mutagenic conditions described above, were used to co-transform yeast strain KHY105 using anin vivo recombination method as described previously (41.Staples R.R. Dieckmann C.L. Genetics. 1993; 135: 981-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unique BamHI and XbaI sites flanking theVMA8-coding sequence were introduced into pKH3203 by site-directed mutagenesis. pKH3203 was cleaved with BamHI and XbaI, and the large 6.6-kilobase pair fragment lacking the VMA8 gene was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The mutagenized PCR products (0.2 μg) and the 6.6-kilobase pair vector fragment (1 μg) were mixed and used to co-transform the KHY105 strain using the lithium acetate method (42.Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). The transformants were then selected on Ura− plates. To screen forVMA8 mutants leading to defective V-ATPase function, colonies were replica-plated on YPD plates buffered by 50 mm KH2PO4 and succinate to pH 5.5 and 7.5. Mutants unable to grow at pH 7.5 were selected, and the mutant plasmids were recovered and used to retransform KHY105 to verify that the observed phenotype was due to a mutation in VMA8. The mutant forms of VMA8 constructed by site-directed mutagenesis were subcloned into pRS316 and transformed into KHY105 followed by selection of transformants on Ura− plates. Whole cell lysates were prepared from overnight cultures in Ura− medium as described previously (43.Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels. The expression of subunit D was detected by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody raised against Vma8p (a generous gift of Dr. Tom Stevens). Assembly of the V-ATPase was assessed by measurement of the amount of subunit A present on isolated vacuolar membranes and by immunoprecipitation of the V-ATPase complex from whole cell lysates. Vacuolar membrane vesicles were isolated as described previously (44.Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Following separation of the proteins on 12% acrylamide gels, Western blotting was performed using the monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 against the A subunit (obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc.). It has previously been shown that the V1 domain (including the A subunit) only associates with the vacuolar membrane if V-ATPase assembly is normal. Western blots were developed using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized by a chemiluminescent detection system from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories. Metabolic labeling of the V-ATPase using Tran35S-label, solubilization, and immunoprecipitation of V-ATPase using 8B1-F3 were carried out as described previously (45.Leng X.H. Manolson M. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cells were grown overnight in methionine-free media to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.6–0.8. The cells were converted to spheroplasts by treatment with Zymolyase and incubated with Trans35S-label (50 μCi/5 × 106 spheroplasts) for 1 h at 30 °C. Spheroplasts were pelleted, washed, and lysed in PBS (135 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 1.75 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4)) with 1% C12E9 and 1 mm DSP. The V-ATPase complex was then immunoprecipitated using the antibody 8B1-F3 against subunit A and protein A-Sepharose followed by separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide gels and autoradiography. Dissociation of the V-ATPase in response to glucose depletion was detected as described previously (39.Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. The Δvma8 yeast strain expressing the wild-type or mutant forms ofVMA8 was grown overnight to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.6–0.8. The cells were converted to spheroplasts and incubated in YEP media or YEP media containing 2% glucose for 40 min at 30 °C. Spheroplasts were pelleted and lysed in PBS containing 1% C12E9 and 1 mmDSP. The V-ATPase complex was then immunoprecipitated using 8B1-F3 and protein A-Sepharose followed by separation on 12% acrylamide gels and transfer to nitrocellulose. Western blotting was then performed separately using the antibodies 8B1-F3 against the A subunit and 10D7 against the 100-kDa a subunit of the V0 domain. Dissociation results in the disappearance of the 100-kDa a subunit from the complex immunoprecipitated with the antibody against the V1 A subunit. Western blots were developed using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized by a chemiluminescent detection system from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (46.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured using a coupled spectrophotometric assay as described previously (47.Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). V-ATPase activity was defined as the ATPase activity of isolated vacuoles (10 μg of protein) that was inhibitable by 0.2 μm concanamycin (48.Drose S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3902-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Vacuoles isolated from the Δvma8 strain expressing the wild-type VMA8 gene had a specific activity of 1.3–1.5 μmol of ATP/min/mg protein. Typically, concanamycin inhibited approximately 90–95% of the ATPase activity in isolated vacuoles. ATP-dependent proton transport was measured by quenching of ACMA fluorescence using a Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrofluorimeter (47.Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vacuoles isolated from the Δvma8 strain expressing the vector alone showed no ATP-dependent quenching of ACMA fluorescence. To evaluate the functional role of subunit D in the V-ATPase complex, PCR-based random mutagenesis of the VMA8 gene encoding subunit D in yeast was performed. Disruption of V-ATPase function leads to a conditional growth phenotype in yeast in which cells are unable to grow at pH 7.5 but retain the ability to grow at pH 5.5 (36.Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Wolczyk D.F. Neff N. Goebl M. Stevens T.H. Science. 1990; 250: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 37.Hirata R. Ohsumi Y. Nakano A. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Anraku Y. J. Biol.

Following mutagenesis and transformation, transformants were selected for the inability to grow at pH 7.5. Screening of approximately 10,000 transformants resulted in the selection of 29 colonies unable to grow at neutral pH. These mutants were then further screened for stable expression of Vma8p by Western blotting of whole cell lysates using a polyclonal antibody specific for the yeast subunit D. Of the initial isolates, 15 colonies showed nearly normal levels of subunit D in whole cell lysates. Plasmids from these mutants were recovered, amplified in Escherichia coli, and reintroduced into the vma8-deficient strain. Fourteen of the mutant plasmids still led to the vma− phenotype and were sequenced. All of the mutant plasmids contained multiple point mutations. Seven plasmids, containing either 2 or 3 mutations, were subjected to further analysis. Previous attempts to isolate mutants inVMA8 causing the vma− phenotype had also resulted in only mutants containing multiple point mutations. 2T. Xu and M. Forgac, unpublished observations. Fig. 1 shows a Western blot of whole cell lysates isolated from each of the mutant strains using a polyclonal antibody directed against Vma8p. As can be seen, all seven of the mutants showed nearly normal levels of subunit D relative to cells expressing the wild-type VMA8 gene. Several of the mutants showed slightly lower mobility (i.e. higher apparent molecular weight) relative to the wild-type protein, which might be due to altered SDS binding as a result of the mutations introduced. To evaluate the effects of the mutations on activity of the V-ATPase, vacuoles were isolated from cells expressing the wild-type and mutant forms of subunit D, and ATPase activity and proton transport were measured using a coupled spectrophotometric assay and uptake of the fluorescent dye ACMA, respectively. V-ATPase activity was defined as that fraction of the ATPase activity that was inhibited by 0.2 μm concanamycin (48.Drose S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3902-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), typically approximately 90–95% in isolated vacuoles. ATPase activities are expressed relative to that measured for vacuoles isolated from cells expressing the wild-typeVMA8 gene (1.3–1.5 μmol of ATP/min/mg of protein). As can be seen from Table I, all of the mutants showed loss of at least 58% of ATPase activity and 60% of ACMA quenching. Generally the loss of proton transport paralleled loss of ATPase, although for mutants 2 and 2′, loss of proton transport was slightly greater than loss of ATPase, whereas for mutant 3′ the opposite was true. Several point mutations appeared in more than one mutant, including G80D, I188N, E220V, and M221V, and the mutations generally clustered in two regions, from Val71 to Gly80 and from Lys209 to Met221.Table IV-ATPase activity and proton transport of vacuoles isolated from cells expressing mutant forms of vma8 selected by random mutagenesisMutantMutations invma8V-ATPase activity aV-ATPase activity was defined as the ATPase activity of isolated vacuoles (10 μg of protein) that was inhibitable by 0.2 μm concanamycin.

https://openalex.org/W2061961744,"Palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1) is a newly described lysosomal enzyme that hydrolyzes long chain fatty acids from lipid-modified cysteine residues in proteins. Deficiency in this enzyme results in a severe neurodegenerative storage disorder, infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Although the primary structure of PPT1 contains a serine lipase consensus sequence, the enzyme is insensitive to commonly used serine-modifying reagents phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and diisopropylfluorophosphate. In the current paper, we show that the active site serine in PPT1 is modified by a substrate analog of PMSF, hexadecylsulfonylfluoride (HDSF) in a specific and site-directed manner. The apparentKi of the inhibition was 125 μm (in the presence of 1.5 mm Triton X-100), and the catalytic rate constant for sulfonylation (k 2) was 3.3/min, a value similar to previously described sulfonylation reactions. PPT1 was crystallized after inactivation with HDSF, and the structure of the inactive form was determined to 2.4 Å resolution. The hexadecylsulfonyl was found to modify serine 115 and to snake through a narrow hydrophobic channel that would not accommodate an aromatic sulfonyl fluoride. Therefore, the geometry of the active site accounts for the reactivity of PPT1 with HDSF but not PMSF. These observations suggest a structural explanation as to why certain serine lipases are resistant to modification by commonly used serine-modifying reagents.

These observations suggest a structural explanation as to why certain serine lipases are resistant to modification by commonly used serine-modifying reagents. palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-1 hexadecylsulfonyl fluoride phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride diisopropylfluorophosphate Palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1)1 is a newly described lysosomal hydrolase that removes long chain fatty acids from lipid-modified cysteine residues in fatty acylated proteins (reviewed in Ref. 1Hofmann S.L. Lee L.A. Lu J.Y. Verkruyse L.A. Neuropediatrics. 1997; 28: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Deficiency of the enzyme leads to a lysosomal storage disease, infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, which causes blindness, seizures, and cortical atrophy of the brain (2Vesa J. Hellsten E. Verkruyse L.A. Camp L.A. Rapola J. Santavuori P. Hofmann S.L. Peltonen L. Nature. 1995; 376: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Lysosomal inclusion bodies, termed granular osmiophilic deposits, accumulate in all tissues, and resemble lipofuscin deposits that occur during normal aging. In keeping with this important lipid-metabolizing role, PPT1 is one of the most abundant lysosomal enzymes in the brain (3Sleat D.E. Sohar I. Lackland H. Majercak J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19191-19198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast to most hydrolytic enzymes (such as proteases, lipases, esterases, and thioesterases), PPT1 is insensitive to the serine-modifying reagents phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) (4Camp L.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22566-22574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The insensitivity of PPT1 to these reagents was an important feature of PPT1 because it allowed for the identification of PPT activity in the presence of contaminating lipase and protease activities. We wondered whether there might be structural and/or mechanistic differences between PPT1 and these other lipolytic enzymes that would account for this observation. We have recently determined the three-dimensional crystal structure of PPT1 in the presence and absence of palmitoyl-CoA and shown that palmitate modifies serine 115 of the enzyme (5Bellizzi J.J. Widom J. Kemp C. Lu J.-Y. Das A.K. Hofmann S.L. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4573-4578Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), confirming that a serine residue is the catalytic nucleophile. In the current study, we show that although PPT1 is insensitive to inactivation by the serine-reactive reagent PMSF, the enzyme is covalently modified and inactivated by hexadecylsulfonyl fluoride (HDSF) by an active site-directed mechanism. The modified enzyme was crystallized, and the bound inhibitor was identified in the structure. The bound inhibitor defines a narrow, hydrophobic groove leading away from the active site that would not comfortably accommodate an aromatic sulfonyl fluoride. These findings suggest that the active site of PPT1 is readily susceptible to sulfonylation and that the insensitivity of PPT1 to PMSF is due to steric constraints related to the unique structure of the substrate-binding site. Recombinant bovine PPT1 was overexpressed in the Sf9 cell baculovirus system and purified from serum-free SF-900II medium as described previously (6Camp L.A. Verkruyse L.A. Afendis S.J. Slaughter C.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23212-23219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of the preparations were >90% as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the specific activity of the purified enzyme was 0.7–1.2 μmol of palmitoyl-CoA hydrolyzed per min per mg of purified protein. [3H]Palmitoyl-CoA was synthesized from [3H]palmitic acid as described previously (7Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23594-23600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Hexadecylsulfonyl fluoride was prepared as described (8Horrevoets A.J.G. Verheij H.M. de Hass G.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity of PPT1 was determined essentially as described (9Mentlein R. Suttorp M. Heymann E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 230-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) by measuring the release of [3H]palmitic acid from [3H]palmitoyl-CoA, which was monitored by liquid scintillation after extraction with Dole's reagent (10Dole V.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1956; 35: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). Typically, 30–60 ng of purified recombinant PPT1 was assayed in 100 μl of an assay buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA for 8 min at 37 °C. Inactivation of purified recombinant PPT1 was carried out in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (buffer A) unless otherwise indicated. Triton X-100 (required to maintain solubility of the HDSF) was added to reaction mixtures from a concentrated stock solution (5%). HDSF was added from a concentrated stock solution (100 mm or lower) in Me2SO. Incubations were carried out at 37 °C for varying amounts of time, and the inactivation reactions were stopped by 200-fold or greater dilution into ice-cold enzyme assay buffer. The inactivation was shown not to proceed during the assay under these conditions in control experiments (data not shown). The inactivation of PPT1 was assumed to proceed via formation of an intermediate Michaelis complex as described previously (11Gold A.M. Fahrney D. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The reaction is assumed to follow the course shown in Equation 1.E+I⇌k−1k1E­I→k2PEquation 1 where E is enzyme, I is inhibitor,E-I is the intermediate Michaelis complex, and Pis the final inactivated product. When experiments are performed under pseudo-first-order conditions (i.e. HDSF well in excess over the enzyme) Equation 1 can be rewritten in the linear form as shown in Equation 2.1/k1=1/k2+Ki/k2[I]Equation 2 This equation describes the relation between the observed first-order rate constants for inactivation (k 1), the rate of sulfonylation in the Michaelis complex (k 2), the Michaelis constantKi, and the concentration of HDSF. Therefore, a double reciprocal plot of the observed first-order rate constants against HDSF concentration yields a straight line with a slope of Ki/k 2 and an intercept of 1/k 2 on the y axis. To determine the first-order rate constants, reactions were initiated by addition of 20–100 μm HDSF into reaction mixtures containing 1 μm of PPT1. Inactivation was followed by determining the activity remaining at closely spaced time intervals. Activities were expressed as the percentage of initial activity and plotted on a semi-log scale as a function of time. From the semi-log plots, the half-times of inactivation were determined. Observed pseudo-first-order rate constants were calculated using the following equation.k1=0.693/t1/2Equation 3 where t½ is the half-time of inactivation determined from semi-log plot. Once a first-order rate constant for each HDSF concentration was calculated, a double reciprocal plot of 1/k 1 against 1/[I] was obtained.k 2 was calculated from the yintercept, and Ki was determined from the slope as described above. PPT1 (12 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Triton X-100) was inactivated by the addition of 1 mm HDSF. Crystals grew from sitting drop vapor diffusion experiments containing 3 μl of PPT1/HDSF and 2 μl of reservoir solution equilibrated against a 500-μl reservoir containing 55% polypropylene glycol 400 (Fluka) and 100 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.5. Crystals were harvested from the drops in nylon loops and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Crystals of HDSF-inactivated PPT1 were analyzed on the A1 beamline at Cornell High Energy Syncotron Source using an ADSC Quantum-4 CCD Detector (12Szebenyi D.M.E. Arvai A. Ealick S. Laluppa J.M. Nielsen C. J. Synchrotron Rad. 1997; 4: 128-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Diffraction data to 2.4 Å were collected, indexed, and integrated with MOSFLM (13Leslie A.G.W. MOSFLM. 5.30 Ed. MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK1994Google Scholar) and scaled and converted to structure factor amplitudes with SCALA and TRUNCATE from the CCP4 package (14Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar). The R sym is 0.064, and the completeness is 96.5%. Using our previously determined model of uncomplexed PPT1 (5Bellizzi J.J. Widom J. Kemp C. Lu J.-Y. Das A.K. Hofmann S.L. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4573-4578Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) as a starting point, density for HDSF was clearly visible in difference Fourier maps. The inhibitor was built into the density using O (15Jones T. Kjeldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), and the complex was refined using simulated annealing, energy minimization, and individual B-factor refinement with the Crystallography and NMR System Software Suite (16Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar). Topology and parameter files for HDSF were created using XPLO2D (17Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 208-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The workingR-factor of the refined model is 0.243, and the R free is 0.288, corresponding to 2210 nonhydrogen protein atoms (the entire mature PPT1 polypeptide from residues 28–306), 55 sugar atoms (four N-acetylglucosamine residues), 19 atoms from HDSF, and 40 well defined water molecules (corresponding to peaks greater than 3 ς in a sigmaA-weightedF o − F c map with hydrogen-bonding partners). The average B-factor is 53.8 Å2. In Fig. 1, the chemical structures of the alkylating agents used in this study, HDSF and PMSF, are shown for comparison with a natural substrate of PPT1, a palmitoyl cysteine thioester that normally occurs in the context of a lipid-modified protein or peptide (18Lu J.Y. Verkruyse L.A. Hofmann S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10046-10050Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). PPT1 prefers acyl chain lengths of 14–18 carbons (6Camp L.A. Verkruyse L.A. Afendis S.J. Slaughter C.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23212-23219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and no appreciable hydrolysis is observed for chain lengths under eight carbons. Previous work has also shown that there are no major constraints on the nature of the attached “leaving group,” because PPT1 readily hydrolyzes other long chain fatty acyl thioesters, such as palmitoyl-CoA (6Camp L.A. Verkruyse L.A. Afendis S.J. Slaughter C.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23212-23219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and S-palmitoyl thioglucoside (19van Diggelen O.P. Keulemans J.L. Winchester B. Hofman I.L. Vanhanen S.L. Santavuori P. Voznyi Y.V. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 66: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The current studies presented below utilized palmitoyl CoA as a substrate because of the availability of facile assays using [3H]palmitoyl-CoA. (However, the kinetic studies presented in Fig. 2 (Aand B) were obtained using either [3H]palmitoyl-CoA or [3H]palmitate-labeled Ha-Ras with virtually identical results (data not shown).)Figure 2Inhibition of the palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity of PPT1 by HDSF but not PMSF. A, time course of inactivation of PPT1 (1 μm) in the presence of 5 mm PMSF (●), 5 mm HDSF (▴), or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, solvent, ○). B, PPT1 activity as a function of time of incubation with HDSF under pseudo-first-order reaction conditions. Bovine recombinant PPT1 (175 nm) was incubated in the presence of 3 μm HDSF, and aliquots were removed and assayed for remaining activity at the times indicated. The inactivation was linear with respect to the natural logarithm of activity remaining, indicating a bimolecular reaction mechanism.C, stoichiometry of inactivation of PPT1 by HDSF. Purified recombinant PPT1 (10 μm) was incubated with increasing amounts of HDSF for 2 h at 37 °C, and the PPT1 activity remaining was determined. Inactivation was complete at a molar ratio of enzyme to inhibitor of 1:1. D, inactivation of PPT1 by HDSF is inhibited in a competitive manner by increasing concentrations of palmitoyl-CoA. Double reciprocal plots of the pseudo-first-order rate constants of inactivation plotted against increasing HDSF concentrations are shown. Three different palmitoyl CoA concentrations were plotted: 0 μm palmitoyl-CoA (○), 15 μm palmitoyl-CoA (●), and 25 μmpalmitoyl-CoA (▴).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 2 A shows that incubation of PPT1 with PMSF (5 mm) had no appreciable effect on enzyme activity over that seen with solvent (Me2SO) alone, whereas incubation with HDSF (5 mm), an alkylating agent with a 16-carbon fatty acyl chain, resulted in a very rapid loss of enzyme activity, with 80% inactivation at 1 min and loss of measurable activity at 4 min. PPT1 has a broad pH optimum with a peak of pH 7.0 when palmitoylated protein or palmitoyl-CoA is used as the substrate. The rate of inactivation of PPT1 by HDSF as a function of pH paralleled this broad pH optimum with the exception that at pH above 7.5, the rate of inactivation became higher but was confounded by an HDSF-independent inactivation that was due to enzyme instability (data not shown). Therefore, the remainder of the studies were conducted at pH 7.0. As illustrated in Fig. 2 B, under pseudo-first-order reaction conditions (i.e. concentration of HDSF at 20–50 times over enzyme concentration), the inactivation of PPT1 by HDSF followed first-order kinetics as shown by the linear relationship between the natural logarithm of remaining activity and reaction time. No loss of activity was observed within the time period of inactivation when HDSF was omitted form the reaction mixture (data not shown). To determine the stoichiometry of inactivation, a precisely determined amount of enzyme was reacted with increasing amounts of HDSF under conditions where the reaction was expected to go to completion (2 h at 37 °C), and the remaining activity was determined (Fig. 2 C). 1 mol of HDSF was needed to inactivate 1 mol of enzyme, suggesting that only one PPT1 functional group became modified in the course of inactivation. In our kinetic study we have assumed that the inactivation of the enzyme by HDSF proceeds through the formation of an intermediate Michaelis complex, as is true for most of the serine hydrolases. To determine the kinetic constants for inactivation, we measured the rate of inactivation of PPT1 at increasing HDSF concentrations under pseudo-first-order conditions. We observed that a plot of the slopes of the natural logarithm of activity remaining became saturated at increasing inhibitor concentration, which is a characteristic of specific (site-directed) irreversible inhibition (20Malcolm A.D. Radda G.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 15: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Brocklehurst K. Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 775-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Cornish-Bowden A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 93: 383-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A double reciprocal plot of the observed first-order rate constant of inactivation as a function of HDSF concentration is shown in Fig.2 D (open circles). The y intercept yields the reciprocal of the rate constant k 2 of sulfonylation in the Michaelis complex, and the slope (Ki/k 2) yields the inhibitor concentration at which the half-maximal rate is observed. From Fig.2 D, we derive a Ki of 125 μm and k 2 of 3.3/min for the inactivation of PPT1 by HDSF. The Ki does not represent a true Michaelis dissociation constant in this case, because HDSF is insoluble in aqueous solution and requires Triton X-100 (1.5 mm) for solubilization. In a micellar system, surface concentration in two dimensions is the relevant value, but because it is not possible to measure the surface concentration directly, the concentration is usually expressed as a mole fraction of inhibitor in the detergent micelle, irrespective of the total concentrations of inhibitor and detergent (23Yu L. Dennis E.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1992; 2: 1343-1348Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 24Hanel A.M. Schuttel S. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5949-5958Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this case, the Ki reflects a half-maximal rate of inactivation at a mole fraction of HDSF in the Triton X-100 micelle of 0.061, which is somewhat higher than the “affinity constant” of 0.022 measured in a similar experiment that examined the inactivation of Escherichia coli phospholipase A2 by HDSF (8Horrevoets A.J.G. Verheij H.M. de Hass G.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The k 2 compares favorably with the inactivation of chymotrypsin by PMSF (3.1/min) (11Gold A.M. Fahrney D. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and with the k 2 measured for the inactivation of E. coli phospholipase A2 with HDSF (6–17/min) (8Horrevoets A.J.G. Verheij H.M. de Hass G.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The experiments used to generate the curve in Fig. 2 Din the absence of palmitoyl-CoA (open circles) were repeated in the presence of 15 μm palmitoyl-CoA (closed circles) and 25 μm palmitoyl-CoA (closed triangles), which are concentrations that are close to the Km of PPT1 for palmitoyl CoA (40 μm; data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 D, substrate protection from the specific irreversible inhibition of PPT1 by HDSF was demonstrated, as reflected in the unchanged rate constant of sulfonylation (k 2) in the presence of substrate, whereas the inhibition constant Ki increased in the presence of substrate (to 235 and 273 μm at 15 and 25 μm palmitoyl-CoA, respectively). The protection of inactivation by substrate confirms an active site-directed mechanism. HDSF-inactivated PPT1 was crystallized and its three-dimensional crystal structure determined at 2.4 Å resolution (Fig.3). The binding of HDSF to PPT1 closely mimics the binding of substrate to PPT1 (5Bellizzi J.J. Widom J. Kemp C. Lu J.-Y. Das A.K. Hofmann S.L. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4573-4578Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The hexadecyl chain occupies the same hydrophobic groove that palmitate was shown to occupy in our previous structure (Fig.4 A), and serine 115 is covalently modified by the sulfonyl group. There are no significant differences observed between the structure of HDSF-inactivated PPT and the previously determined structures of PPT1 alone and PPT1 bound to palmitate.Figure 4A, HDSF occupies the narrow substrate-binding cleft in PPT1. B, in contrast, the Pseudomonas carboxylesterase active site, occupied here by PMSF, is more open and able to accommodate a wider range of substrates.C, Pseudomonas carboxylesterase residues and PMSF (red) superimposed on the PPT1 active site. The structures were aligned using LSQAB (36Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2327) Google Scholar) from the CCP4 suite, using the α-carbons of the β sheet and the catalytic triad residues. Note that the side chain of Met41 occupies the space where PMSF is bound in the carboxylesterase structure, and the presence of Ile235 on the other side of the groove does not provide enough space for PMSF to adopt an alternative conformation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Superposition of the crystal structure of PMSF-inactivatedPseudomonas carboxylesterase (Protein Data Bank code 1AUR) (Fig. 4 B) with HDSF-inactivated PPT1 sheds some light on the molecular details of the specificity of HDSF over PMSF for inactivation of PPT1. The narrow hydrophobic groove leading away from the active site that provides substrate specificity in PPT1 begins with Met41 and Ile235 and is less than 5 Å wide at this point (Fig. 4 A). The side chain of Met41 in PPT1 occupies the space where the aromatic ring of PMSF is found in the carboxylesterase structure (Fig. 4 C). The side chain of Ile235 would block alternative conformations of PMSF from the active site, and the surrounding environment provides no space to accommodate alternate conformations of the Met41 side chain, which would make room for the PMSF. In contrast, HDSF is able to adopt a conformation that snakes through the channel (Fig.4 A). Enzymes are often classified mechanistically on the basis of their susceptibility to inactivation by class-specific reagents. This classification scheme has served proteolytic enzymes well; for example, serine proteases are nearly universally sensitive to DFP, and classification on the basis of sensitivity to DFP applies to serine proteases such as the digestive proteases and the blood coagulation factors. Lipolytic enzymes have been more problematic, because sensitivity to class-specific reagents is not universal and because detailed reaction mechanisms for many classes of lipolytic enzymes are not well understood. For example, the enzymes lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase and lipoprotein lipase are readily inactivated by DFP, but the modification occurs not on the catalytic serine but on a second serine that is probably related instead to the substrate-binding site (25Maraganore J.M. Heinrikson R.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 497-498Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Several additional secreted lipases, most notably bacterial lipases from Staphylococcus hyicus (26van Oort M.G. Deveer A.M. Dijkman R. Tjeenk M.L. Verheij H.M. de Haas G.H. Wenzig E. Gotz F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9278-9285Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and E. coli (phospholipase A2) (8Horrevoets A.J.G. Verheij H.M. de Hass G.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and pancreatic lipase (27Maylie M.F. Charles M. Desnuelle P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 276: 162-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,28Luthi-Peng Q. Marki H.P. Hadvary P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 299: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), are insensitive to DFP and PMSF and yet use serine as the catalytic nucleophile. In the case of the two bacterial lipases, the involvement of a serine residue in the catalytic mechanism was inferred by their sensitivity to the long chain alkylating agent HDSF (8Horrevoets A.J.G. Verheij H.M. de Hass G.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29Leuveling Tjeenk M. Bulsink Y.B.M. Slotboom A.J. Verheij H.M. de Hass G.H. Demleitner G. Gotz F. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Pancreatic lipase has been well documented to utilize a classical serine-based triad mechanism based on analysis of its tertiary structure (30Winkler F.K. D'Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is clear that certain lipases utilize catalytic serine nucleophiles, but for reasons that have not been clear, their active sites are not susceptible to modification by alkylating agents that are commonly used to modify other lipases, esterases, and proteases. In the current paper, we have described the modification of the active site serine residue of PPT1, a lysosomal lipolytic enzyme, by HDSF, but not the class-specific reagent, PMSF, and provide important direct structural insights into the basis for the selectivity. We found that there is no inherent lack of reactivity of the active site serine for sulfonylation, as evidenced by the similar kinetic constant for sulfonylation (3.3/min) by HDSF as compared with a classical example, sulfonylation of chymotrypsin by PMSF (3.1/min). However, the crystal structure indicates that PPT1 binds the long chain hydrocarbon in a narrow, hydrophobic groove that would not comfortably accommodate an aromatic sulfonyl fluoride. Interestingly, the converse conclusion (that a more open configuration around the active site would lead to facile inactivation by PMSF and also to a broader substrate specificity) was recently made in relation to another lipolytic enzyme, the carboxylesterase fromPseudomonas fluorescens, a member of the α/β hydrolase superfamily that includes PPT1 (31Kim K.K. Song H.K. Shin D.H. Hwang K.Y. Choe S. Yoo O.J. Suh S.W. Structure. 1997; 5: 1571-1584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As described above, a comparison of these two enzymes was instructive. The salient structural features of both lipases include an α/β fold structure, which consists of a central, predominantly parallel β sheet linked by α-helical regions and a catalytic serine nucleophile located at the tip of a nucleophilic “elbow.” The Pseudomonas carboxylesterase hydrolyzes a broad spectrum of short chain esters, including phenylacetate,p-nitrophenyl esters of short chain fatty acids, and triglycerides such as triacetin and tributyrin but does not hydrolyze substrates with fatty acid chain lengths of over four carbons (32Hong K.H. Jang W.H. Choi K.D. Yoo O.J. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 2839-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). It is readily inactivated by PMSF, and (as in the case of PPT1 inactivated by HDSF) there are no large structural changes observed upon inhibitor binding. In the structure of the carboxylesterase bound to PMSF, the active site is found in a relatively open configuration that would accommodate a broad variety of small molecules close to the active site but would not (in contrast to PPT1) accept long chain fatty acyl esters because of interfering loops located at a relatively short distance away. From these observations and others, it has been suggested that the extent of exposure of the active site may be one of the key elements for determining the substrate specificity of the serine esterases (31Kim K.K. Song H.K. Shin D.H. Hwang K.Y. Choe S. Yoo O.J. Suh S.W. Structure. 1997; 5: 1571-1584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our observations of HDSF bound to PPT1 would support this view, in that the narrow channel leading from the active site serine in PPT1 places severe constraints on the structures of molecules that could be accommodated there, either as substrates or inhibitors. In summary, we have shown that a lysosomal thioesterase, PPT1, is similar to several other “secreted” lipases in showing insensitivity to class-specific reagents DFP and PMSF. PPT1 is readily inhibited by a sulfonyl fluoride (HDSF) that is structurally more similar to its naturally occurring fatty acyl-containing substrates. The inactivation was shown to be clearly related to modification of a serine residue, which is in a position to act as the catalytic nucleophile in a classical serine-histidine-aspartic acid triad. The relatively closed conformation around the active site of PPT1 accounts for the insensitivity of PPT1 to the classical serine-specific reagent PMSF and provides a structural explanation for the resistance of serine lipases to inactivation by serine-modifying class-specific reagents."
https://openalex.org/W2028572911,"Regulation of mammalian cell growth and proliferation is governed through receptor-mediated signaling networks that ultimately converge on the cell cycle machinery. Adaptor proteins play essential roles in the formation of intracellular signaling complexes, relaying extracellular signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus of a cell. The leukocyte-specific adaptor protein Grap2 is a central linker protein in immune cell signaling and activation. Using Grap2 as bait protein, we identified a novel human protein, GCIP (Grap2 cyclin-D interactingprotein). We found that GCIP bound to Grap2 in both yeast two-hybrid assays and in mammalian cells through binding to the COOH-terminal unique domain and SH3 domain (designated QC domain) of Grap2. GCIP also associated with cyclin D both in vitro andin vivo. The expression of GCIP was found in all human tissues examined with the highest level of expression in the heart, muscle, peripheral blood leukocytes, and brain. Furthermore, phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein by cyclin D-dependent protein kinase was reduced and E2F1-mediated transcription activity was inhibited in cells transfected with GCIP. High level expression of GCIP in terminally differentiated tissues and the inhibition of E2F1 transcription activation suggest that GCIP could play an important role in controlling cell differentiation and proliferation. Regulation of mammalian cell growth and proliferation is governed through receptor-mediated signaling networks that ultimately converge on the cell cycle machinery. Adaptor proteins play essential roles in the formation of intracellular signaling complexes, relaying extracellular signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus of a cell. The leukocyte-specific adaptor protein Grap2 is a central linker protein in immune cell signaling and activation. Using Grap2 as bait protein, we identified a novel human protein, GCIP (Grap2 cyclin-D interactingprotein). We found that GCIP bound to Grap2 in both yeast two-hybrid assays and in mammalian cells through binding to the COOH-terminal unique domain and SH3 domain (designated QC domain) of Grap2. GCIP also associated with cyclin D both in vitro andin vivo. The expression of GCIP was found in all human tissues examined with the highest level of expression in the heart, muscle, peripheral blood leukocytes, and brain. Furthermore, phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein by cyclin D-dependent protein kinase was reduced and E2F1-mediated transcription activity was inhibited in cells transfected with GCIP. High level expression of GCIP in terminally differentiated tissues and the inhibition of E2F1 transcription activation suggest that GCIP could play an important role in controlling cell differentiation and proliferation. retinoblastoma protein Src homology domain reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction hemagglutinin glutathione S-transferase chloramphenicol acetyltransferase helix-loop-helix cyclin D-dependent protein kinase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis In response to extracellular mitogenic and growth signals, cells initiate different signaling pathways that ultimately lead to the transcriptional activation of downstream genes and cell proliferation. One set of the genes that respond to mitogenic signals encodes the D-type cyclins (D1, D2, and D3). These cyclins assemble with their catalytic partners, CDK4 and CDK6, as cells progress through the first gap phase (G1) to the initiation of DNA synthesis (S phase) (1.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). Assembled cyclin D-Cdk complexes then enter the cell nucleus where they are phosphorylated and activated by CDK-activated kinases. The active cyclin D-Cdk complexes participate in the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma retinoblastoma protein (Rb),1 resulting in the functional inactivation of Rb and the progression of the cell through the late G1 restriction point into the S phase (2.Meyerson M. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2077-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 3.Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar). Rb exerts its growth regulatory functions at least in part by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of E2F, a family of transcription factors that play a major role in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression (4.Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Chellappan S.P. Giordano A. Fisher P.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 227: 57-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). It has been known that E2F proteins mediate the transactivation of a set of genes that controls cellular progression through G1 into the S phase. By binding to the activation domain of E2F, Rb protein actively represses transcription from promoters containing E2F-binding sites, resulting in the arrest of cell cycle progression (3.Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar, 6.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar, 7.Dyson N.

Therefore, disruption of the Rb gene by deletion, mutation, or inactivation by phosphorylation or viral oncoproteins causes the release of free, transcriptional active E2F family of proteins, leading to the unrestricted cell proliferation (4.Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Chellappan S.P. Giordano A. Fisher P.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 227: 57-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Johnson D.G.

Understanding the regulation of cyclin D-dependent protein kinases, their phosphorylation of Rb, and their activation of E2F-mediated transcriptional activation will provide insight into the molecular mechanism of cell differentiation and proliferation. Recently, adaptor proteins or scaffold proteins have been shown to play important roles in the regulation of signaling networks and in determining the specificity and selectivity of signaling pathways (9.Weng G. Bhalla U.S. Iyengar R. Science. 1999; 284: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar,10.Bhalla U.S. Iyengar R. Science. 1999; 283: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Examples include the mitogen-activated protein kinase complexes coordinated by the scaffold proteins Ste5p and Pbs2p in yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae (11.Choi K.-Y. Satterberg B. Lyons D.M. Elion E.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 499-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase signaling complexes by JIP-1 (12.Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), and the signaling complexes mediated by T-cell-specific LAT proteins (13.Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified a novel leukocyte-specific adaptor protein, Grap2, in immune tissues (14.Qiu M. Hua S. Agrawal M. Li G. Cai J. Chan E. Zhou H. Luo Y. Liu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Like Grb2, Grap2 contains two SH3 domains and one SH2 domain in its structure. However, Grap2 has a 120- amino acid glutamine-/proline-rich domain between the SH2 domain and the COOH-terminal SH3 domain. The expression of Grap2 is highly tissue- and cell-specific, found only in immune tissues and in T lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages. Although the roles of Grap2 in immune cell signaling and activation is not clear at this moment, it can form signaling complexes with a number of signaling molecules in T cells and leukemia cells to relay extracellular signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus of the cells. In this report, we describe the cloning of a novel human protein, GCIP, that interacts with Grap2 and cyclin D. In yeast two-hybrid assays and in mammalian cells, GCIP interacts with full-length Grap2 protein and with the COOH-terminal unique and SH3 domains (designated QC domain) of Grap2. Unlike the highly restricted expression of Grap2, GCIP is ubiquitously expressed in all human tissues examined with a high level of expression in the heart, muscle, peripheral blood leukocytes, kidney, and brain, where cell differentiation and proliferation is limited. Furthermore, we found that GCIP associates with cyclin D1 bothin vitro and in mammalian cells. In the presence of GCIP, phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein by cyclin D-dependent Cdk4 kinase was partially inhibited. Overexpression of GCIP in mammalian cells suppressed the E2F1-mediated transcriptional activity, which is required for the transition of the G1 phase to the S phase in cell cycle progression. Together these data suggest that GCIP is a novel human protein potentially involved in the regulation of cell differentiation and proliferation through Grap2 and cyclin D-mediated signaling pathways. The unique proline/glutamine-rich domain and the COOH-terminal SH3 domain (QC domain) of Grap2 cDNA (14.Qiu M. Hua S. Agrawal M. Li G. Cai J. Chan E. Zhou H. Luo Y. Liu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was subcloned into yeast plasmid pAS2-1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) to create an in-frame fusion with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain gene. The pAS2-Grap2QC was transformed into yeast strain PJ69-2A using the lithium acetate procedure and plated onto synthetic complete (SC) media lacking tryptophan and adenine. Pretransformed human bone marrow cDNA library (CLONTECH) was mated with the bait strain for 20 h, and then plated on SC medium plates without tryptophan, leucine, adenine, and histidine. The transformed yeast cells were grown at 30 °C for 3–7 days. Transformants grown on the quadruple dropout plates were assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Library plasmid DNA was recovered by transformation into Escherichia coli KC8 cells and sequenced on both strands. Full-length GCIP was cloned into mammalian expression vectors pCMV-HA (CLONTECH) or pCMV-Tag1 (Promega, WI) by PCR using two oligonucleotide primers. The oligonucleotides used were the following: 5′-GAAGATCTAGATGGCGAGCGCAACTGCA-3′ and 5′-GGGGTACCTCATAATTCAAGTTCACTCTGAG-3′. PCR products were digested with BglII and KpnI, and cloned into pCMV-HA vector with an in-frame hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope sequence or Flag-epitope sequence at the 5′ end. For construction of glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-GCIP protein, full-length GCIP or the COOH-terminal domain of GCIP were subcloned into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) vector by PCR. GST fusion proteins corresponding to the full-length of Grap2, the SH2 domain, and the QC domain of Grap2 were constructed by PCR and subcloned into pGEX-2TK. Sequences of the expression constructs were confirmed by automatic DNA sequencing. Multi-tissue poly(A+) blots with 2 μg/lane RNA from 16 different human tissues were obtained from CLONTECH. The probe used was a full-length GCIP cDNA of ∼1.2 kilobases obtained by restriction digestion of the GCIP plasmid. The cDNA probe was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA) by random priming, using the Prime-It random primer labeling kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions. The hybridizing and washing conditions were as described in the manual provided with ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) with the modification that hybridization was carried out for 4 h at 68 °C in a hybridization oven. After hybridization, the blots were washed first in 2 × sodium citrate buffer and 0.5% SDS buffer for 30 min at room temperature, then followed by three washes with 0.1 × sodium citrate buffer and 0.1% SDS buffer solutions at 50–60 °C. The membrane was exposed to x-ray film (Kodak BioMax MR) for 24 h at −80 °C. cDNAs from different immune tissues were obtained fromCLONTECH. Specific primers (5′-CTACAACAGTGTCTGGGTTGCGTGCC, 3′-GTATCAGAGCCTGTCCATGTCGATGAG) corresponding to the COOH-terminal region of GCIP were used in the RT-PCR reaction. Primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used as a positive control and the standard for the amount of cDNA used in the PCR. Different cells were cultured as described in appropriate culture medium. COS-7 and 293T cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were transfected with plasmids as indicated by LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Life Technologies, Bethesda, MD). Jurkat T cells and K562 cells were transfected by electroporation at settings of 960 microfarads and 250 volts. 12–16 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. 36–48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mmα-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 μg/ml aprotinin). Kinase assays for cyclin D-Cdk4 were performed using GST-Rb as a substrate as described previously (15.Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Expression vectors, pCGE2F1, pCMVE2F1VP16, and the pG5E1BCAT are kind gifts from Dr. David Johnson (University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center) (16.Johnson D.G. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). For GAL4 and VP16 fusions, a total of 2 μg of plasmids was used in transfections for CAT reporter assays and 10 μg of plasmids was used in luciferase transfection assays. pCMV-LacZ vector was used as an internal control for normalization in all transfections. GST-Grap2 and GST-GCIP fusion proteins were purified as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used in an in vitro protein binding assay. Briefly, COS-7-transfected cell lysate was incubated with comparable amounts of resin-bound GST fusion proteins. The beads were washed three times in the lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 μg/ml aprotinin) and twice in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Proteins bound were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH), and visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For coimmunoprecipitation, COS-7 cells were cultured to approximately 70% confluency before they were co-transfected with cDNAs encoding HA-tagged GCIP and Grap2 or Flag-tagged Grap2. Proteins were precipitated with specific antibodies and immunoblotted with anti-HA or anti-cyclin D antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Transfected cells were harvested, and extracts were prepared by three freeze-thaw cycles and heat inactivation. Cell lysates were then quantitated for total protein, and an equivalent amount of cell lysate (normalized for total protein) from each transfection was assayed for CAT activity as described in manufacturer's manual (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, 50 μg of total cellular protein (COS-7 transfected cells) were incubated in a reaction mixture containing 14C-labeled chloramphenicol andn-butyryl coenzyme A. The reaction products are extracted with a small volume of xylene. The n-butyryl chloramphenicol in the xylene phase is mixed with scintillant and counted in a scintillation counter. Conversion to acetylated forms was also analyzed by thin-layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography. To identify proteins that interact with human Grap2, the COOH-terminal unique glutamine-/proline-rich domain and the SH3 domain (QC domain) of Grap2 was used as a bait to screen a pretransformed human bone marrow cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system. A number of clones were identified that contain various lengths of cDNA sequences derived from a novel gene. One of the clones designated A5 contains a 1.5-kilobase insert and has a full-length open reading frame of 360 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 40 kDa (Fig.1 A). We designated the novel molecule GCIP,Grap2-cyclin-D-interactingprotein, for its association with Grap2 and cyclin D1 in the cell. As shown in Fig. 1 B, GCIP has distinct domain structures. Secondary structural analysis revealed a putative helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif in the middle region of the protein without the basic DNA-binding domain, suggesting a potential role in the regulation of transcription factors. A comparison with bHLH transcription factors and the Id family of proteins reveals the existence of a conserved second helix domain (Fig. 1 C). However, the first helix domain is very divergent compared with others. An aspartic/glutamic acid-rich domain is found between the HLH domain and the potential leucine zipper motif. Data base searches found that the new gene shares 65% homology with mouse Maid, a maternally transcribed gene that encodes a potential negative regulator of basic transcription factors in the mouse egg and zygote (17.Hwang S.-Y. Oh B. Fuchtbauer A. Fuchtbauer E.-M. Johnson K.R. Solter D. Knowles B.B. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 209: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the human GCIP protein has extra 50 amino acids at its amino terminus (Fig.1 A). To confirm the predicted reading frame of GCIP cDNA, HA-GCIP plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells or 293T cells, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 C, a single band with anticipated molecular mass (approximately 42 kDa) of HA-GCIP was observed on the immunoblot.Figure 2Expression of human GCIP. A , Northern blot analysis of GCIP in different human adult tissues. mRNA derived from different human adult tissues were obtained from CLONTECH and hybridized with a radiolabeled GCIP probe. Twelve different human tissues are:1, brain; 2, heart; 3, muscle;4, colon; 5, thymus; 6, spleen;7, kidney; 8, liver; 9, small intestine; 10, placenta; 11, lung; and12, peripheral blood leukocytes. The size of the GCIP cDNA was estimated to be approximately 1.4 kilobases with minor bands at 4.0 kilobase. B, PCR analysis of the expression of GCIP mRNA in immune tissues. cDNA from different immune tissues were obtained from CLONTECH. Specific primers of human GCIP (5′-CTACAACAGTGTCTGGGTTGCGTGCC; 3′-GTATCAGAGCCTGTCCATGTCGATGAG) were used to detect the expression of the gene. Relative lower expression of GCIP was found in bone marrow compared with other immune tissues. Two different sizes of products are present in leukocytes, reflecting possible alternative splicing products. No cDNA was added in the control panel. G3PDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. C, expression of HA-tagged GCIP protein in COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells were transfected with HA-tagged GCIP cDNA and the control plasmid pCMV-HA. A 42-kDa protein was detected in cells transfected with HA-GCIP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the expression of the GCIP gene, we performed Northern blot analysis of mRNAs isolated from different human tissues. As shown in Fig. 2 A, one major transcript of 1.3 kilobases was detected in all the human tissues, including brain, heart, muscle, colon, thymus, spleen, kidney, liver, small intestine, placenta, lung, and peripheral blood leukocytes. A higher level of GCIP mRNA expression was observed in heart, muscle, peripheral blood leukocytes, kidney, and brain when compared with other tissues, suggesting a potential negative role of GCIP in cell differentiation and proliferation. Probing mRNA isolated from different immune tissues by RT-PCR demonstrated the expression of GCIP in all immune tissues with relatively low expression in bone marrow (Fig.2 B). An extra band was found in leukocytes, but not in other immune tissues. Whether the upper band is an alternatively spliced isoform is under investigation. To confirm the binding specificity of GCIP with Grap2, we co-transformed yeast cells with Gal4-AD/GCIP and one of the following expression plasmids: Gal4-DB, Gal4-DB/Grap2QC, and Gal4-DB/Grap2-SH2. The human p53 and large T-antigen serve as a positive control pair in the study. As shown in Fig.3 A, only yeast cells co-transformed with GCIP/Grap2 QC plasmids were able to grow on the selective medium (SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His) other than the positive control. No growth was observed in cells transformed with GCIP/Grap2 SH2 domain and other plasmids, suggesting that GCIP interacts specifically with the Grap2 QC domain in yeast cells. To quantitate the interactions between GCIP and Grap2, we measured the β-galactosidase activity of the lacZ reporter gene and compared that with the interaction between p53 and large T-antigens. As shown in Fig.3 B, co-transformation of GCIP with the QC domain of Grap2 in yeast cells strongly activated the expression of the lacZreporter gene. These results clearly demonstrated that in vivo binding of GCIP to Grap2 is highly specific in yeast cells. To verify the binding specificity detected in the yeast two-hybrid assays, we examined the in vitro binding of GCIP to Grap2. GST fusion proteins corresponding to different domains of Grap2 (Fig.4 A) were expressed in E. coli and affinity purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads. Lysate from COS-7 cells transfected with HA-GCIP was incubated with the immobilized GST-Grap2 fusion proteins. The protein complexes were then washed extensively, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride PVDF) membrane. GCIP protein bound to GST-Grap2 domains was detected with anti-HA monoclonal antibodies. Results from Fig. 4 B revealed that HA-GCIP expressed in COS-7 cells associated with GST-Grap2 full-length protein and the GST-Grap2 QC domain, thus confirming the results that the QC domain of Grap2 is responsible for the interaction between Grap2 and GCIP detected in the yeast two-hybrid system. Neither GST-Grap2-SH2 domain nor GST alone showed any binding to HA-GCIP, indicating the binding specificity of GCIP to the QC domain of Grap2 fusion protein. To examine whether GCIP and Grap2 can interact in mammalian cells, we co-transfected HA-GCIP with Flag-tagged Grap2 in COS-7 cells. Protein complex was isolated by immunoprecipitation using anti-Flag monoclonal antibodies (M2). The association of GCIP with Flag-tagged Grap2 was detected by Western blot using HA-specific monoclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4 C, HA-GCIP coprecipitates with the full-length Grap2 protein and the QC domain of Grap2, not the Grap2-SH2 domain. Together, these results indicated that GCIP specifically interacts with the QC domain of Grap2. To test whether GCIP is involved in cell proliferation, we examined the binding of GCIP to cyclin D by in vitro assays. GST fusion proteins corresponding to the full-length of GCIP and the carboxyl terminus of GCIP (Glu209 to Leu360), respectively, were generated and expressed in E. coli. The GST fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography with glutathion-Sepharose beads. Cell extracts from 293T cells, COS-7, Jurkat cells, and K562 cells that stimulated with serum were incubated with GST-GCIP fusion protein. Proteins that bind to GST-GCIP fusion proteins were analyzed by Western blot using specific anti-cyclin D1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the GST-GCIP full-length fusion protein interacted with cyclin D1 from 293T cell extract as detected by specific anti-cyclin D1 antibody. No direct binding of cyclin D1 to the COOH terminus of GCIP or GST beads was detected. Similar results were obtained with cell extracts from other cell types (COS-7, Jurkat, and K562 cells). To further analyze the in vivo binding of GCIP and cyclin D, we transfected HA-tagged GCIP cDNA into different cells (Jurkat, K562, COS-7, and 293T). The cells were starved in serum-free medium initially and subsequently cultured in 10% serum medium. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection. Proteins bound to GCIP were immunoprecipitated using an anti-HA antibody. Protein complex was separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently blotted with an anti-cyclin D1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 B, cyclin D1 was coimmunoprecipitated with HA-GCIP in cells transfected with HA-GCIP, confirming our in vitro observation that GCIP physically interacts with cyclin D1. Since GCIP can interact with cyclin D in cellular extracts, we examined the effects of GCIP overexpression on the activity of cyclin D-dependent protein kinase (Cdk4). Cyclin D1-Cdk4 complex was immunopurified from COS-7 cells by either anti-cyclin D1 antibodies or anti-Cdk4 antibodies. The activity of the cyclin D-Cdk4 complex was assayed by its ability to phosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal domain of Rb expressed as a GST fusion protein. As shown in Fig.6, overexpression of GCIP in COS-7 cells reduced the phosphorylation of GST-Rb protein by approximately 50% when the cyclin D-Cdk4 complex was precipitated with anti-Cdk4 antibodies. On the other hand, GCIP has less inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of GST-Rb (30%) by the cyclin-D-Cdk4 complex purified by anti-cyclin D1 antibodies. Similar inhibitory effect (∼30–40%) was observed by adding purified GST-GCIP protein into the phosphorylation reaction of GST-Rb (data not shown). These data suggest that interaction of GCIP with cyclin D1 reduced the kinase activity of the cyclin D-Cdk4 complex either by disrupting the complex formation or by changing the conformation of the complex. Since phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin D-dependent protein kinases leads to the activation of E2F transcriptional activation by releasing E2F from Rb (18.Chellappan S.P. Hiebert S. Mudryj M. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 19.Hiebert S.W. Chellappan S.P. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), we examined whether binding of GCIP to cyclin D has any effect on the activation of E2F-mediated transcription. First, a chimeric E2F protein with the carboxyl-terminal transcription activation domain of E2F1 was fused to a GAL4 DNA-binding domain for its ability to respond to the overexpression of GCIP in transient-transfection assay as described previously (20.Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 21.Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4213-4219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Wang S. Nath N. Fusaro G. Chellappan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7447-7460Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7 A, the GAL4-E2F1 expression vector and the control vector GAL4VP16 could induce transcription activation from a pG5E1BCAT reporter. Co-transfection of GCIP greatly inhibited the transcriptional activity of the GAL4-E2F1 protein, but has little effect on the transcription induced by the GAL4-VP16. Similar results were obtained with the CAT assay on the thin layer plates where co-transfection of GCIP inhibited the CAT activity (Fig. 7 B). These results suggested that GCIP directly or indirectly inhibited the transcriptional activation mediated by E2F1 protein. We have cloned a novel human protein from bone marrow library, GCIP, that bound to the leukocyte-specific adaptor protein Grap2 and the key cell cycle protein, cyclin D. Expression of GCIP mRNA was found in most of the human tissues, especially abundant in the heart, muscle, peripheral blood leukocytes, brain, and kidney. From the two-hybrid system and in vitro binding assays, we found that GCIP interacted with the QC domain of Grap2. We also showed that GCIP protein could interact with cyclin D both in our in vitroassays and in GCIP-transfected cells in which GCIP can be coimmunoprecipitated with cyclin D. Furthermore, the presence of GCIP in cyclin D-Cdk4 complex decreased the cyclin D-dependent kinase activity using GST-Rb as a substrate. These results suggest that association of GCIP with cyclin D may change the conformation of cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes or prevent cyclin D to form stable complex with Cdks, which is essential for the phosphorylation of Rb by fully active kinase complex. Overexpression of GCIP in COS-7 cells indirectly or directly inhibited the E2F1 mediated transcriptional activity. By interacting with cyclin D, GCIP may regulate the phosphorylation status of Rb protein, leading to the inhibitory effects of E2F transcriptional activity. Since GCIP contains a putative HLH structure without the basic DNA-binding domains, it may function as a dominant negative regulator for transcription factors like the Id family of proteins (23.Benezra R. Davis R. Lockshon D. Turner D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar, 24.Christy B. Sanders L. Lau L. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Nathans D. Proc.

Therefore, GCIP may directly interact with transcription factor E2F1, blocking the transcriptional activity of E2F1 in our reporter assays. We are currently examining the molecular basis of this inhibitory effect of GCIP on transcription factors. The characteristic of HLH without the basic amino acid region identified in GCIP is similar to that of the Id proteins, a family of negative regulators of bHLH transcription factors (23.Benezra R.

However, the amino acid sequence of GCIP shares little identity with the Id proteins (Id1, Id2, Id3, and Id4). Therefore, GCIP may represent a new class of dominant negative HLH proteins, similar to the mouse maternally transcribed gene, Maid (17.Hwang S.-Y. Oh B. Fuchtbauer A. Fuchtbauer E.-M. Johnson K.R. Solter D. Knowles B.B. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 209: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Following the putative HLH domain is a region enriched with aspartic and glutamic acids in GCIP. Domains with high acidic amino acid content are considered to be involved in protein-protein interactions. Immediately downstream of the negatively charged domain of GCIP is a potential leucine zipper (leucine-rich) domain, suggesting that these regions may be involved in interactions with other proteins. Due to the structural features of GCIP, it will be of great interest to examine whether GCIP could interact with HLH domain-containing transcription factors and act as a negative regulator in cell differentiation and proliferation. Grap2 is a novel adaptor protein identified by its interaction with Gab-1 docking protein (14.Qiu M. Hua S. Agrawal M. Li G. Cai J. Chan E. Zhou H. Luo Y. Liu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similar to Grb2, Grap2 contains two SH3 domains and one SH2 domain. However, Grap2 also contains a unique 120-amino acid proline-/glutamine-rich domain between the SH2 domain and the COOH-terminal SH3 domain. Unlike Grb2, the expression of Grap2 is exclusively limited to immune tissues, e.g. high level of expression in the thymus, spleen, bone marrow, peripheral blood leukocyte, and lymph nodes. There is no or little expression in other tissues tested. In immune cells, Grap2 is found primarily in T lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages. 2C. Xia and M. Liu, unpublished data. During the activation of T lymphocytes, Grap2 plays an important role in transducing signals from cell surface membrane to the nucleus by interacting with different signaling molecules and forming signal transduction complexes. The identification of a novel protein GCIP that interacts with Grap2 and cyclin D will further confirm our hypothesis that Grap2 is a central linker protein in immune cell signaling and proliferation. Signaling pathways linked to Grap2 complex could directly or indirectly affect E2F1 transcriptional activity, a possible mechanism for the regulation of cell cycle and cell proliferation. Other adaptor proteins that contain similar domain structures may also interact with GCIP in different tissues or cells. With distinct domain structure found in GCIP, it will be interesting to examine the kinds of molecules that interact with GCIP during cell differentiation and proliferation. Regulation of mammalian cell proliferation by extracellular signals is governed through receptor-mediated signaling networks that ultimately converge on the cell cycle machinery driven by cyclin-dependent kinases and cyclin-dependent kinases inhibitors (6.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar). The transition from G1 to S phase is controlled by a series of sequential regulatory events. We demonstrated that GCIP interacts with cyclin D and this interaction could exert negative effect on the cyclin D-dependent Cdk4 kinase activity. In mammalian cells, expression of D-type cyclins is an early event stimulated by growth factors, cytokins, and other mitogens. D-type cyclins bind and activate cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk4 and Cdk6. Cyclin D-Cdk complexes phosphorylate the retinoblastoma family of proteins, Rb, that reversibly interacts with members of the E2F family of transcription factors and inhibits the transcriptional activity of E2F (18.Chellappan S.P.

Phosphorylation of Rb during G1 phase inactivates the ability of Rb to control cell cycle progression, leading to the accumulation of active E2F and possibly other transcription factors required to drive the cell into S phase (34.Weintraub S.J. Chow K.N. Luo R.X. Zhang S.H. He S. Dean D.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 35.Qin X.Q. Livingston D.M. Ewen M. Sellers W.R. Arany Z. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 742-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have shown that overexpression of GCIP in cells inhibited the E2F1-mediated transcriptional activity. Although GCIP mRNA is found in most of the human tissues examined, the expression level of GCIP is substantially higher in the heart, muscle, peripheral blood leukocytes, lung, and brain where cell differentiation and proliferation is limited in normal tissues. Therefore, it is tempting to hypothesize that GCIP, together with other transcriptional inhibitors, is the underlining mechanism that regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. Studies on how the expression of GCIP is regulated by cell cycle signals and during cell proliferation will shed new light on the molecular mechanism of cell differentiation and proliferation. We are grateful to Dr. David Johnson, Dr. Meng-Hong Lee (University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center), and Dr. Xin-Hua Feng (Baylor College of Medicine) for valuable constructs."

Suicide of the cell is timed to the appearance late in the maturation of the phage of a short peptide sequence in the major head protein, the Gol peptide, which activates proteolysis. In the present work we demonstrate that the Gol peptide binds specifically to domains II and III of EF-Tu, creating the unique substrate for the Lit protease, which then cleaves domain I, the guanine nucleotide binding domain. The conformation of EF-Tu is important for binding and Lit cleavage, because both are sensitive to the identity of the bound nucleotide, with GDP being preferred over GTP. We propose that association of the T4 coat protein with EF-Tu plays a role in phage head assembly but that this association marks infected cells for suicide when Lit is present. Based on these data and recent observations on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 maturation, we speculate that associations between host translation factors and coat proteins may be integral to viral assembly in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

During its role in translation, EF-Tu interacts with a number of molecules, including the nucleotides GTP and GDP, aminoacylated tRNA molecules, mRNA-programmed ribosomes, and the nucleotide exchange factor EF-Ts (1Abel K. Jurnak F. Structure. 1996; 4: 229-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition to forming complexes with these molecules, EF-Tu is also known to serve as one of the subunits in the bacteriophage Qβ replicase (2Blumenthal T. Landers T.A. Weber K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 228: 748-751Google Scholar) and has recently been shown to have chaperone-like activity in vitro, promoting the renaturation of some denatured proteins (3Caldas T.D. El Yaagoubi A. Richarme G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11478-11482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Hence, EF-Tu is capable of interacting with a variety of macromolecules and serving more than one biological function. In addition to these associations, EF-Tu also undergoes post-translation modifications, including methylation at a specific lysine residue, which appears to attenuate its GTPase activity and is linked to the growth phase of the cells (4Van Noort J.M. Kraal B. Sinjorgo K.M. Peroon N.L.M. Johanns E.S.D. Bosch L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation, although the physiological role of this modification is uncertain (5Lippmann C. Lindschau C. Vijgenboom E. Schroder W. Bosch L. Erdmann V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 601-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EF-Tu is also the target of a bacteriophage exclusion system (6Yu Y.-T.N. Snyder L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Bacteriophage exclusion is a defense mechanism in which bacteria commit altruistic suicide in response to infection, thereby preventing propagation of the phage (7Snyder L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 8Yarmolinsky M. Science. 1995; 267: 836-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Although distinct to apoptosis in eukaryotes, similarities have been drawn between this form of suicide and programmed cell death events in multicellular organisms (9Vaux D.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 245-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). Generally, these exclusion systems are mediated by the action of one or more nonessential proteins encoded by prophages, plasmids, or transposons. One of the best studied is that of E. coli K-12 strains, which exclude T4 bacteriophage as well as other T-even phages through the action of a metalloprotease called Lit (LateInhibitor of T4), encoded by the defective prophage e14 (10Kao C. Gumbs E. Snyder L. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 69: 1232-1238Crossref Google Scholar). Following T4 phage infection of a Lit-containing cell, EF-Tu is specifically cleaved by Lit between Gly59and Ile60 in the RGITI motif of the effector I region resulting in the inhibition of translation (6Yu Y.-T.N. Snyder L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This region, which is involved in co-ordinating the γ-phosphate of GTP as well as the bound magnesium ion (11Sprinzl M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 245-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar and references cited therein), is conserved in other translation elongation factors such as EF-G and common to the homologous eukaryotic translation factors EF-1α and EF-2. The fact that neither EF-G nor heat-inactivated EF-Tu are cleaved by Lit suggests that the three-dimensional structure of EF-Tu, and not just the primary sequence of the proteolysis site, is required for cleavage and that the cleavage reaction is highly specific, implying the involvement of other regions of the translation factor (12Georgiou T., Yu, Y.T.N. Ekunwe S. Buttner M.J. Zuurmond A.M. Kraal B. Kleanthous C. Snyder L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2891-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Proteolysis of EF-Tu by Lit is activated by the appearance in the cell of a short peptide determinant approximately 29 amino acids long, beginning about 100 amino acids in from the N terminus of the unprocessed major head protein of the infecting T-even phage, gp23 (56 kDa). This short peptide sequence was named the Gol peptide sequence, because it was first identified by mutations in gp23 that allow the phage to Grow On Lit-producing bacteria (13Champness W.C. Snyder L. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 155: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The Gol peptide sequence is highly conserved in the head protein of all T-even phages that have been characterized (14Monod C. Repoila F. Kutateladze M. Tetart F. Krisch H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It has been possible to reproduce the entire phage exclusion system in a purified three-component system containing EF-Tu, Lit protease, and a chemically synthesized 29-amino acid peptide representing the minimalgol region sequence. In this system, Lit-mediated cleavage of the Gly59–Ile60 bond of EF-Tu is dependent on the addition of the Gol peptide, with no additional viral or bacterial proteins being required (12Georgiou T., Yu, Y.T.N. Ekunwe S. Buttner M.J. Zuurmond A.M. Kraal B. Kleanthous C. Snyder L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2891-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The absolute dependence for proteolysis on the Gol peptide in the purified system raises the question of how the activation occurs. Few peptide-activated proteases have been described in the literature, although a well known example occurs in the maturation of adenovirus in which an 11-residue C-terminal peptide of the viral coat protein activates the thiol protease Ad2 through thiol-disulfide exchange to cleave the same coat protein (15Webster A. Hay R.T. Kemp G. Cell. 1993; 72: 97-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Gol peptide acts in trans, and, although the peptide contains a single cysteine, this residue is not required for activation of Lit-mediated cleavage of EF-Tu, indicating a mechanism distinct to that of Ad2 (12Georgiou T., Yu, Y.T.N. Ekunwe S. Buttner M.J. Zuurmond A.M. Kraal B. Kleanthous C. Snyder L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2891-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here we report the results of a number of different experimental approaches to show that the phage-derived Gol peptide binds to EF-Tu. We also show that this complex forms an activated substrate for Lit and that this association is sensitive to the identity of the nucleotide bound to the translation factor. Because the association of viral capsid proteins with host translation factors has also been demonstrated in eukaryotic systems, we discuss how this type of association may be a hitherto unrecognized requirement in the viral infection of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B Redipack columns were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Vydac C8 and C18 reverse-phase columns were from Phenomenex, and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) reagents, such as HPLC-grade water, acetonitrile, and trifluoroacetic acid, were from Pierce. Tritiated N-ethylmaleimide ([3H]NEM; 40–60 Ci/mmol) and [γ32P]GTP (>5000 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, respectively. 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodi-imide hydrochloride (EDC), GDP, GTP, and guanosine 5′-o-(3-thiotriphosphate) were obtained from Sigma. Both E. coli Lit and EF-Tu were prepared as described previously (16Boon K. Vijgenboom E. Madsen L.V. Talens A. Kraal B. Bosch L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Georgiou T., Yu, Y.T.N. Ekunwe S. Buttner M.J. Zuurmond A.M. Kraal B. Kleanthous C. Snyder L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2891-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Synthetic Gol peptide was prepared chemically by either Affiniti Research Products Ltd. or Chiron Inc. and HPLC-purified to 95% purity. N-terminal peptide sequencing was performed by Alta Bioscience (University of Birmingham, UK) on an Applied Biosystems 473A gas phase sequencer. The plasmid, pET30PZ1, which was used to synthesize Gol peptide in vivo, contains a 160-base pair PZ1 fragment extending from the naturalPstI site in the T4 gp23gene to anHindIII linker inserted at the end point of the Δ1 deletion downstream of the gol region (17Bergsland K.J. Kao C., Yu, Y.-T.N. Gulati R. Snyder L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 477-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and then ligated into the PstI and HindIII sites of pET30b (Novagen). Once induced, the construct directs the synthesis of a 12-kDa polypeptide containing the gol region from gp23 close to the C terminus and an S-Tag at the N terminus. Overexpression of active Gol peptide was confirmed by its inability to transform E. coli cells containing Lit and by the in vitroactivation of EF-Tu cleavage by Lit. The concentrations of Lit, EF-Tu·GDP (or EF-Tu·GTP) and Gol peptide in the cleavage assays were generally 0.2, 2, and 5 μm, respectively, in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 μm GDP (or 10 μm guanosine 5′-o-(3-thiotriphosphate)). All reactions were generally incubated at 30 °C for up to 60 min. The reactions were initiated by the addition of Gol peptide and stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. The reaction products were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and EF-Tu cleavage was quantified by densitometry using a Bio-Rad GS690 imaging densitometer. The rates of EF-Tu cleavage were determined as a percentage of the starting EF-Tu using the software Multi-Analyst (Bio-Rad). Cell extracts containing either the S-Tagged Gol peptide or the GST-EF-Tu fusion protein were prepared separately from E. coli JM109DE3/pET30PZ1 or DH5/pGEX2T-tufA (18Cetin R. Anborgh P.H. Cool R.H. Parmeggiani A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 486-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), respectively. Cultures (200 ml) were grown at 37 °C to an A 625 nm of 0.4 before being transferred to 23 °C for 30 min where protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. The cultures were then grown for a further 3 h at 23 °C before being harvested by centrifugation. Preparation of the cell extracts prior to loading onto the glutathione column involved the resuspension of the cell pellets in 5 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2 followed by sonication and finally centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min to remove any particulate matter. To detect interactions between the Gol peptide-S-Tag and GST-EF-Tu fusion proteins, the extracts were mixed and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The combined extracts were filtered through a 0.45-μm Gelman filter prior to layering onto a 2.5-ml glutathione Redipack column. Following application, the column was washed with 3 volumes of the above buffer before the retained proteins were eluted from the column with reduced glutathione according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractions were collected and assayed for the Gol peptide-S-Tag fusion protein by spotting 3 μl on a nitrocellulose filter and developing the filter with an S-Tag detection kit (Novagen). Elution of the GST-EF-Tu fusion protein was monitored by 10% SDS-PAGE. All cross-linking reactions were performed in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.9, 2 mmMgCl2, 10 μm GDP (or 10 μmguanosine 5′-o-(3-thiotriphosphate)) and generally contained 2 μm EF-Tu with a 100-fold excess of Gol peptide. EF-Tu and Gol peptide were mixed and incubated at 18 °C for 30 min before the addition of EDC to a final concentration of 2.5 mm. The reactions were then incubated at 18 °C for an additional amount of time, as described in the figure legend, prior to their quenching by the addition of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to 100 mm final concentration. The samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. To remove excess Gol peptide from the cross-linking reactions for analytical purposes, the samples were gel-filtered on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech S75 column (26 × 300 mm) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GDP at 1 ml/min. The Gol peptide (1AVMGMVRRAIPNLIAFDICGVQPMNSPTG29), corresponding to residues 93–122 of the full-length gp23 protein, contains a single cysteine residue (Cys19). This can be modified with [3H]NEM to yield tritiated peptide ([3H]Gol) unaffected in its ability to activate EF-Tu cleavage and cross-link to EF-Tu. At a concentration of 1 mm, in 25 mmNa2B4O7-HCl, pH 8.6, the Gol peptide was incubated with 20 mm [3H]NEM (0.0125 mCi/μmol NEM) for 5 h at 37 °C. The labeled peptide was separated from excess [3H]NEM by gel-filtration on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech S75 column (26 × 300 mm) equilibrated in water at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions containing [3H]Gol were pooled, lyophilized, and reconstituted into 1 ml of 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.9. The concentration and, hence, the specific activity of the peptide (15.8 μCi/μmol peptide) were determined. The efficiency of radiolabeling was estimated using 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) to quantify the amount of unmodified cysteine residues (19Riddles P.W. Blackeley R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Generally, the Gol peptide was greater than 80% labeled. Cross-linking reactions between the tritiated Gol peptide and EF-Tu and all the relevant controls (i.e. [3H]Gol and EF-Tu alone) were performed as described previously except that the radiolabeled peptide was in a 20-fold molar excess to that of EF-Tu. Following gel-filtration of the cross-linked complex to remove excess peptide, appropriate fractions containing both radioactivity and EF-Tu were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon Centricon 10 microconcentrator. The specific activity of the [3H]Gol·EF-Tu complex was determined (5.9 nCi/nmol complex). This material was then proteolytically digested by the addition of 2% trypsin followed by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. The proteolysis of bacterial EF-Tu by trypsin has been reported from a number of laboratories (20Wittinghofer A. Frank R. Leberman R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 108: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Arai K.-I. Nakamura S. Arai T. Kawakita M. Kaziro Y. J. Biochem. 1975; 79: 69-83Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The conditions used in our study were similar to these and ensured the complete digestion of EF-Tu and the generation of small peptide fragments. The digestions were stopped by the addition of soya bean trypsin inhibitor to a 4-fold molar excess of that of trypsin. Control reactions were also treated in a similar manner. The samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and reverse-phase HPLC. Peptides generated by trypsin digestion were HPLC-purified on a Vydac C8 reverse-phase column that had been equilibrated in 90% water/10% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was developed using a gradient up to 65% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 95% acetonitrile/5% water at a flow rate of 1 ml/min over 35 min. For the digestion and separation of the [3H]Gol·EF-Tu complex, three regions of the peptide map, at retention times 16.5, 18.5, and 20 min, respectively, were collected (pools A, B, and C) and rechromatographed on a Vydac C18 reverse-phase column equilibrated with 85% water/15% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was developed with a gradient up to 30% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 95% acetonitrile/5% water at a flow rate of 1 ml/min over 35 min. Single radioactive peaks from all three pools were collected, lyophilized, and submitted for N-terminal sequencing. For all HPLC steps, the recovery of applied radioactivity was greater than 95%, and both the C8 and C18 columns were run at 18 °C while monitoring the absorbance at λ220 nm. To convert the EF-Tu·GDP form into EF-Tu·GTP, 20 μm EF-Tu·GDP was incubated with 200 μm guanosine 5′-o-(3-thiotriphosphate), 200 μmphosphenolpyruvate, and 0.05 μg/μl pyruvate kinase for 30 min at 37 °C, essentially as described by Fasano et al. (22Fasano O. Bruns W. Crechet J.B. Sander G. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 89: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The reaction was quenched on ice. Determination of the intrinsic GTPase activity of EF-Tu was based upon the measurement of γ-32P liberated from [γ-32P]GTP upon its hydrolysis as described by Mesters et al. (23Mesters J.R. Zeef L.A.H. Hilgenfeld R. de Graaf J.M. Kraal B. Bosch L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4877-4885Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All assays were carried out in 64 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 80 mmNH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 83 μmphosphenolpyruvate, 17 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 1 μmEF-Tu, and Gol peptide as indicated in the figure legend. For the rate experiments, a 270-μl solution containing EF-Tu·GDP, phosphenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, and 500 μm Gol peptide was preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Then, [γ-32P]GTP (1200 dpm/pmol), also preincubated with phosphenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase, was added to give a final volume of 300 μl and a final concentration of [γ-32P]GTP of 5 μm. Aliquots of 30 μl were removed from the reaction at the times indicated in the figure legend and quenched by the addition of silicotungstate in 1 mm H2SO4 to a final concentration of 3.7 mm. Following the addition of ammonium molybdate in 2 m H2SO4 to a final concentration of 0.74% (w/v), the liberated γ-32P, as a dodecamolybdate complex, was extracted into a 1:1 toluene/butan-2-ol mixture (24Shacter E. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and counted on a scintillation counter. For the titration experiments, the concentration of Gol peptide in separate 30-μl reactions was increased as indicated in the figure legend. The reactions were then preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min before the addition of [γ-32P]GTP, then they were incubated for a further 60 min before being quenched and analyzed as described above. To monitor the association of EF-Tu with Gol peptide, separate extracts were prepared of bacterial cells containing a glutathione S-transferase-EF-Tu (GST-EF-Tu) fusion protein and a Gol peptide-S-Tag fusion (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this construct, a 60-amino acid peptide of the gp23 protein that spanned the Gol region was fused to an S-Tag. The extracts were mixed and loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose column. Fig.1 A shows that the GST-EF-Tu fusion protein bound to the column along with some of the Gol peptide-S-Tag fusion, which could then be eluted when the GST-EF-Tu fusion protein was stripped from the column by the addition of excess glutathione to the wash buffer (lanes d, e, and f). Much less S-Tagged peptide was retained in identical control experiments in which the S-Tag was not fused to the Gol sequence (Fig. 1 B) or if the GST protein was not fused to EF-Tu (Fig. 1 C). These data demonstrate that the peptide was retained on the column due to a direct interaction between the Gol peptide and EF-Tu rather than through nonspecific interactions between, for example, GST and the S-Tag. Overall, these results indicate that the Gol peptide is retained on the column by virtue of its interaction with EF-Tu. Attempts were made to recapitulate these chromatographic experiments using the chemically synthesized 29-residue Gol peptide. However, we were unable to detect retention of EF-Tu on a Gol peptide affinity column nor indeed retention of the peptide to an EF-Tu affinity column (data not shown). It is clear from estimates of the binding constant for the Gol peptide-EF-Tu complex (see below) that the synthetic peptide binds weakly to EF-Tu, which explains why complexes could not be detected chromatographically using the peptide. The fact that binding could be detected for the 60-mer version of the Gol peptide in the GST and S-Tag experiments implies that the extra flanking amino acids from gp23 likely increase the binding affinity for EF-Tu. Lastly, we could not detect Lit retention on the EF-Tu or Gol-peptide affinity columns. This implied that binary complexes between Lit and the other components did not occur or were too weak to be detected. 2R. Bingham and C. Kleanthous, unpublished observations. The chromatographic experiments suggested that the Gol peptide formed a complex with EF-Tu. However, these experiments did not address the question of whether the resulting complex is relevant to the mechanism by which the Gol peptide activates proteolysis of EF-Tu by Lit. To investigate this, we employed chemical cross-linking, which is capable of capturing even weakly bound complexes, and, to simplify interpretation, we focused on the chemically synthesized Gol peptide and purified EF-Tu. Using the bifunctional, zero-length cross-linking reagent EDC, it was possible to specifically cross-link the synthetic 29-residue Gol peptide to EF-Tu bound with GDP (Fig.2, lane 1) demonstrating that a complex is detectable. A cross-linked adduct was observed of ∼47 kDa, corresponding to EF-Tu (44 kDa) covalently bound with a single copy of the 3-kDa Gol peptide (cross-linking efficiency ∼20% by laser densitometry). Increasing concentrations of either the cross-linking reagent or Gol peptide did not yield species of higher molecular mass (data not shown), suggesting that a 1:1 complex was being cross-linked. Cross-linking was also used to probe for Gol peptide binding to Lit, but no cross-linked adducts could be detected (data not shown). Having demonstrated cross-linking between EF-Tu and the Gol peptide, the functional relevance of this complex could then be tested by incubating the mixture of cross-linked and uncross-linked EF-Tu with the Lit protease after excess peptide had been removed by gel-filtration chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). Only the EF-Tu to which the Gol peptide was covalently attached was a substrate for Lit cleavage as deduced by the loss of the upper band at 47 kDa but not the lower band at 44 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 2). The specific cleavage of cross-linked EF-Tu is also apparent from the size of the cleavage fragments. Lit-mediated proteolysis of native EF-Tu ordinarily yields two cleavage fragments of approximately 37 kDa (amino acids 60–393) and 7 kDa (amino acids 1–59), respectively, with only the larger fragment being visible on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteolysis of the cross-linked complex, however, gave rise to a larger cleavage fragment of ∼40 kDa, corresponding to the 37-kDa fragment covalently bound to the Gol peptide. These results not only demonstrate the high specificity of cross-linking between the Gol peptide and EF-Tu, because the complex still acts as a substrate for Lit proteolysis, but also shows that the cross-linking between Gol peptide and EF-Tu is to amino acids C-terminal to the cleavage site (Gly59-Ile60). To demonstrate that EDC does not inactivate the remaining native EF-Tu, excess Gol peptide was added along with Lit. Then the uncross-linked EF-Tu was also digested, generating the normal 37-kDa fragment in addition to the 40-kDa cross-linked fragment (Fig. 2, lane 3). Because the Gol peptide is specifically cross-linked to EF-Tu at a site where it can activate cleavage by Lit, mapping the sites of cross-linking on EF-Tu should begin to reveal where the Gol peptide binds. We therefore identified the positions of some of the cross-links by peptide mapping (see “Experimental Procedures”). These experiments capitalized on two observations. First, it was possible to specifically radiolabel the Gol peptide at its single cysteine residue (Cys19) by chemical modification using tritiated N-ethylmaleimide ([3H]NEM). This modification did not inhibit the ability of Gol to activate Lit-mediated cleavage of EF-Tu nor its cross-linking with EF-Tu (data not shown), in agreement with our previous data on the ability of a Cys19 → Ala mutant of the Gol peptide to sustain Lit cleavage of EF-Tu (12Georgiou T., Yu, Y.T.N. Ekunwe S. Buttner M.J. Zuurmond A.M. Kraal B. Kleanthous C. Snyder L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2891-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Second, radioactive Gol peptide cross-linked to EF-Tu was not degraded by trypsin, which allowed the isolation of EF-Tu peptide fragments that retained Gol-associated radioactivity. The Gol peptide contains two arginines (at positions 8 and 9 in the 29-residue peptide; see “Experimental Procedures”) both of which are readily digested by trypsin in the unbound peptide. However, no tryptic fragments corresponding to cleaved Gol peptide were observed for [3H]Gol cross-linked to EF-Tu, implying protection of the peptide proteolysis sites when bound to the translation factor (data not shown). Following cross-linking of [3H]Gol to EF-Tu by EDC and the removal of excess peptide by gel-filtration, the pooled and concentrated [3H]Gol peptide-EF-Tu cross-linked complex was digested with trypsin and fractionated on a reverse-phase C8 column developed with an acetonitrile gradient (described under “Experimental Procedures”). Peptides eluted between 5 and 30 min, with three distinct radioactive pools eluting at 16.5, 18.5, and 20 min (designated pools A–C, respectively) with little starting material remaining. The three pools were subjected to further purification on a reverse-phase C18 column and these data are shown in Fig.3 (A–C). Homogeneous radiolabeled peptide fractions were isolated from each of these pools (S1 from pool A, S2 and S3 from pool B, and S4 and S5 from pool C) and were subjected to N-terminal sequencing during which the eluted radioactivity was monitored after each cycle. Of the purified peptide fractions from the C18 column, S2 and S5 did not yield clear data and so were not studied further; S2 contained trypsin sequence as well as an unassigned sequence, whereas S5 gave multiple amino acids during each sequencing cycle that could not be assigned to EF-Tu, trypsin, or the Gol peptide. In both cases the radioactivity associated with the peptide eluted throughout all the sequencing cycles. Interpretable sequencing data were obtained for the remaining three peptides S1, S3, and S4, and these data are shown in TableI. Peptide fraction S1, isolated in three independent experiments, corresponded to residues 326–333 of E. coli EF-Tu from domain III, but no discernible Gol sequence could be identified. The radioactivity associated with each sequencing cycle of this peptide was only just above background (normally ∼25 cpm) and eluted across all the residues, making sequence-specific assignment of the cross-linking site impossible. In contrast, peptide S3 was derived from residues 254–261 of domain II and contained a single unassigned residue (Cys256), which also corresponded to the elution position of the radioactivity (Table I).

From the double-reciprocal plot, it was estimated that the V max values for PI-TPαI and II were 2.0 and 6.0 nmol/min, respectively; theK m values for both charge isomers were about equal,i.e. 0.7 μm. Phosphorylation of charge isomers of recombinant mouse PI-TPα confirmed that the PC-containing isomer was the better substrate. Phosphoamino acid analysis of in vitro and in vivo 32P-labeled PI-TPαs showed that serine was the major site of phosphorylation. Degradation of 32P-labeled PI-TPα by cyanogen bromide followed by high pressure liquid chromatography and sequence analysis yielded one32P-labeled peptide (amino acids 104–190). This peptide contained Ser-148, Ser-152, and the consensus PKC phosphorylation site Ser-166. Replacement of Ser-166 with an alanine residue confirmed that indeed this residue was the site of phosphorylation. This mutation completely abolished PI and PC transfer activity. This was also observed when Ser-166 was replaced with Asp, implying that this is a key amino acid residue in regulating the function of PI-TPα. Stimulation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts by phorbol ester or platelet-derived growth factor induced the rapid relocalization of PI-TPα to perinuclear Golgi structures concomitant with a 2–3-fold increase in lysophosphatidylinositol levels. This relocalization was also observed for Myc-tagged wtPI-TPα expressed in NIH3T3 cells. In contrast, the distribution of Myc-tagged PI-TPα(S166A) and Myc-tagged PI-TPα(S166D) were not affected by phorbol ester, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser-166 was a prerequisite for the relocalization to the Golgi. A model is proposed in which the PKC-dependent phosphorylation of PI-TPα is linked to the degradation of PI.

In studies with the reconstituted systems, PI-TPα and β behaved similarly. Recently, PI-TPα overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells was shown to enhance the constitutive levels of lysophosphatidylinositol (lysoPI) (12.Snoek G.T. Berrie C.P. Geijtenbeek T.B. van der Helm H.A.

Overexpression of PI-TPβ in these cells had no effect on lysoPI formation but stimulated the conversion of ceramide into sphingomyelin (13.Van Tiel C.M. Luberto C. Snoek G.T. Hannun Y.A. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition to these soluble PI-TPs, a membrane-bound form of PI-TP was detected containing a PI-TPα homology domain at the N terminus (amino acids 1–257) and six putative membrane-spanning domains. This retinal degeneration B (RdgB) protein was originally identified inDrosophila (14.Vihtelic T.S. Goebl M. Milligan S. O'Tousa J.E. Hyde D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Localization studies by indirect immunofluorescence and by microinjection of fluorescently labeled PI-TPs have shown that PI-TPα is mainly localized in the nucleus and in the cytosol and that PI-TPβ is mainly associated with the Golgi membranes (7.de Vries K.J. Heinrichs A.A. Cunningham E. Brunink F. Westerman J. Somerharju P.J. Cockcroft S. Wirtz K.W.A. Snoek G.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8.de Vries K.J.

Upon stimulation of Swiss mouse 3T3 fibroblasts by growth factors that activate the PI signaling pathway or by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), PI-TPα became rapidly associated with the Golgi membranes. Under these conditions PI-TPα was found to be phosphorylated, suggesting that this modification may be a prerequisite for its association with the Golgi. (15.Snoek G.T. Westerman J. Wouters F.S. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16.Geijtenbeek T.B. de Groot E. van Baal J. Brunink F. Westerman J. Snoek G.T. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). PI-TPα was also a substrate for protein kinase C (PKC) in vitro in agreement with the presence of five putative phosphorylation sites: Thr-59, Thr-169, Thr-198, Thr-251, and Ser-166 (15.Snoek G.T. Westerman J. Wouters F.S. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16.Geijtenbeek T.B. de Groot E. van Baal J. Brunink F. Westerman J. Snoek G.T. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Two charge isomers of PI-TPα are present in tissues and cells of which one isomer carries a PI molecule (PI-TPαI) and the other a PC molecule (PI-TPαII) (17.van Paridon P.A. Visser A.J. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 898: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The cellular concentration of PI-TPαI is about 8-fold higher as compared with that of PI-TPαII. Because the affinity of PI-TPα for PC is about 16-fold lower than the affinity for PI, the relative amounts of the two isomers reflect the accessible pools of PI and PC in the cell. To date, no comparable charge isomers of PI-TPβ have been detected. The physiological significance of the two charge isomers of PI-TPα is not yet known. It has been suggested that the yeast analogue of PI-TP, SEC14p, acts as a sensor of these phospholipid pools in the Golgi inasmuch as that the two charge isomers affect PI and PC metabolism differently (18.Skinner H.B. McGee T.P. McMaster C.R. Fry M.R. Bell R.M. Bankaitis V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Given the ability of PI-TPα to be involved in both PI and PC metabolism (12.Snoek G.T. Berrie C.P. Geijtenbeek T.B. van der Helm H.A. Cadee J.A. Iurisci C. Corda D. Wirtz K.W.A. J. Biol.

J. 1998; 335: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), one may expect a regulatory mechanism in the cell to be able to discriminate between PI-TPαI and II. Because PI-TPα is a substrate for PKC, we have investigated whether the phospholipid bound to PI-TPα has an effect on the in vitro phosphorylation. It will be shown that PI-TPαII is more rapidly phosphorylated by PKC than PI-TPαI. Both charge isomers have one major phosphorylation site (Ser-166), replacement of which with Ala or Asp completely abolished the transfer activity. A model will be presented in which the phosphorylation of PI-TPα is linked to the agonist-induced production of lysoPI.

Rat brains (20–40 g of tissue) were homogenized, and the cytosolic fraction was subsequently purified on DEAE-Sepharose, Sephacryl 200 and phenyl-Sepharose columns. The purified enzyme has a specific activity of 200 nmol of phosphate/min/mg protein when assayed with histone IIIs as substrate. The purified enzyme is stable for several months when kept at −80 °C in 50% glycerol and 0.01% Triton X-100. PI-TPαI and II were purified from bovine brain cytosol as described by van Paridon et al.

The cDNA encoding mouse PI-TPα was expressed in E. coli, and the protein was purified as described by Geijtenbeek et al.(16.Geijtenbeek T.B. de Groot E. van Baal J. Brunink F. Westerman J. Snoek G.T.

The mouse recombinant PI-TPα (recPI-TPα) purified from E. colicontains one molecule of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (16.Geijtenbeek T.B. de Groot E. van Baal J. Brunink F. Westerman J. Snoek G.T. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To exchange the PG molecule for a PI or PC molecule, recPI-TPα (28 nmol) was incubated with PI (385 nmol) present in unilamellar vesicles consisting of PI:PC (30:70 mol %) or with PC (900 nmol) present in vesicles consisting of PC:phosphatidic acid (70:30 mol %). Vesicles were prepared in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, 50 mmNaCl by sonication under nitrogen for 10 min. Vesicles and protein were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 5 mm. Protein and vesicles were separated on a DEAE-cellulose column that was equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2. The recPI-TPα eluted in the run-through and the negatively charged vesicles were retarded on the column (17.van Paridon P.A. Visser A.J. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 898: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The protein content was determined using the Bradford assay (21.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217487) Google Scholar). The products of the exchange reaction were analyzed by isoelectric focussing (16.Geijtenbeek T.B. de Groot E. van Baal J.

The PI-TPα cDNA cloned into the pBluescript vector (pBlue-wtPI-TPα) (16.Geijtenbeek T.B. de Groot E. van Baal J. Brunink F. Westerman J. Snoek G.T. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Ser-166 was replaced by Ala using the following mutagenic oligonucleotides: sense primer, 5′-CCAGCAAAATTTAAG GCTGTCAAAACAGGACGC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GCGTCCTGTTTTGACAGC CTTAAATTTTGCTGG-3′. The bold nucleotides encode the mutated amino acid (Ser-166 to Ala-166), and the underlined nucleotide is a mutation that does not result in a change in amino acid composition, but it deletes a DraI restriction site. Incorporation of the mutagenic oligonucleotides into the construct (pBlue-PI-TPα(S166A) was checked by restriction enzyme analysis and by sequencing. Both the mutated and wtPI-TPα cDNAs were cloned into the pET-15b expression vector. Expression of these constructs yielded wtPI-TPα or PI-TPα(S166A) fused to an N-terminal peptide containing six histidine residues. A mutant PI-TPα in which Ser-166 was replaced with Asp-166 was obtained in a similar way using the above oligonucleotides except that the bold nucleotides were replaced for GAT (sense primer) and ATC (antisense primer). The E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed by either the wtPI-TPα-pET15b or the mutant PI-TPα-pET-15b construct. A 10-ml culture of each transformant grown overnight in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB medium (also containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin). Bacteria were grown at 37 °C. At an A 600 of 0.8, the cultures were induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown for an additional 3 h. His6-tagged wtPI-TPα or His6-tagged mutant PI-TPα were purified from these cultures. All further manipulations were performed at 4 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of STE buffer (0.5m NaCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, pH 7.5) and sonicated for 5 × 30 s at 80 W output with a macrotip of a Branson Sonifier B12. The homogenate was centrifuged at 17,500 × g. The supernatant was collected and extensively dialyzed against buffer A (18.3 mmNa2HPO4, 1.3 mmNaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.8). The dialyzed supernatant was applied to a Ni2+-High Bond column (20 ml) and eluted with a linear gradient (200 ml) of 0–500 mm imidazol in buffer A (flow rate, 0.5 ml/min; fractions, 5 ml). The fractions were assayed for PI-TPα by measuring PI transfer activity and by Western blotting using an antibody against PI-TP. Purified His6-tagged wtPI-TPα and His6-tagged mutant PI-TPα were used for the in vitro phosphorylation experiments. PI and PC transfer activities were determined in a continuous fluorescence assay using 2-pyrenyl-decanoyl-PI or -PC as substrates. (11.Westerman J. de Vries K.J. Somerharju P.

Measurements were performed using a fluorimeter (Photon Technology International) equipped with a thermostated cuvette holder and a stirring device. PI-TPα (0.1–5 μg) was phosphorylated in a reaction volume of 60 μl containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 7.5 mm magnesium acetate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μm ATP, and 1–2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The Ca2+/phospholipid-independent phosphorylation was determined in the presence of 1 mm EGTA, and the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent phosphorylation was determined in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+, 96 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 3.2 μg/ml diacylglycerol. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 600 μl of cold acetone. Bovine serum albumin (1 μg) was added, and after 30 min on ice, the precipitated protein was spun down, dissolved in sample buffer (125 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 5% (w/v) SDS, 12.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% gel) followed by autoradiography. Swiss mouse 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum and buffered with NaHCO3 (44 mm) in a 7.5% CO2 atmosphere. Near-confluent cell cultures in 75-cm2 flasks were labeled for 4.5 h with 1.5 mCi of carrier-free [32P]Pi in 6 ml of phosphate-free Ham's F-12 (DF) medium containing 5% newborn calf serum. PMA (100 ng/ml) was present during the last 15 min of the labeling. The membrane-free supernatant was prepared, and the immunoprecipitation procedure was carried out as described by Snoeket al. (15.Snoek G.T. Westerman J. Wouters F.S. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After identification by autoradiography, the 32P-labeled PI-TPα bands were excised from the dried gel and eluted as described by Boyleet al. (22.Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Briefly, the gel slices were homogenized in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.3–7.6, SDS (final concentration, 0.1%), and 2-mercaptoethanol (final concentration, 1%) were added, and the samples were boiled for 5 min. After incubation of the mixture at 37 °C for 2 h, the gel was spun down and the supernatant containing the 32P-labeled proteins was collected. A second elution with 0.1% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol was carried out on the gel pellet. Carrier protein (boiled RNase, 10 μg) and trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 12%) was added to the combined supernatant fractions, and the samples were incubated on ice for 1 h. The trichloroacetic acid precipitate was washed with cold ethanol and dried. For phosphoamino acid analysis, the pellet was dissolved in 6 m HCl and hydrolyzed for 1 h at 110 °C. The HCl was removed by lyophilization, and the pellet was dissolved in pH 1.9 buffer (glacial acetic acid:formic acid (88%):H2O; 78:25:897 v/v/v). A mixture of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine (1 μg of each) was added. The32P-labeled phosphoamino acids were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis on 20 × 20-cm cellulose TLC plates. The first dimension was in buffer pH 1.9, and the second dimension was in glacial acetic acid:pyridine:H2O (50:5:945 v/v/v), pH 3.5. After electrophoresis the plates were dried, the phosphoamino acids were visualized by staining with 0.2% (w/v) ninhydrin in acetone, and the 32P-labeled amino acids were identified by autoradiography. For phosphopeptide mapping the trichloroacetic acid pellet was dissolved in performic acid, and oxidation was performed for 1–2 h on ice. After lyophilization the sample was and incubated with TPCK-trypsin in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (200 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 5 h. The incubation was repeated by the addition of fresh trypsin, and the sample was lyophilized. The phosphopeptides were separated on cellulose TLC plates. In the first dimension electrophoresis was performed using the pH 1.9 buffer; in the second dimension TLC was performed in n-butanol:pyridine:glacial acetic acid:H2O (75:50:15:60 v/v/v/v). Radioactive phosphopeptides were identified by autoradiography. PI-TPα was phosphorylated as described above with the following changes. The ATP concentration was 1 mm with a trace of [γ-32P]ATP, and the incubation time was 2–4 h at 30 °C. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, eluted, and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid as described above. The pellet was digested with cyanogen bromide (2.5 mg/ml in 70% formic acid, 50 nmol cyanogen bromide/nmol protein) by incubation for 24 h in the dark at room temperature. After lyophilization, the sample was dissolved in 6 m guanidine HCl in 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid, and the peptides were separated on a reverse phase column C2/C18 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, SMART system) with a 0–60% (v/v) acetonitril. The radioactive peak was collected, and the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the32P-labeled peptide was determined by automatic Edman degradation using the 476A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The pBlue-wtPI-TPα, pBlue-PI-TPα(S166A) and pBlue-PI-TPα(S166D) constructs were used to generate Myc-tagged PI-TPα fusion proteins. The pBlue-PI-TPα constructs contained a SacI site upstream of the translational start codon, an NcoI restriction site around the translational start codon, and a BamHI restriction site downstream of the translational stop codon. The SacI andNcoI sites were used to insert the linker encoding the Myc-tagged into the coding sequence. The linker consisted of two oligonucleotide primers carrying a SacI and anNcoI sticky end. The oligonucleotides used were: 5′-CATGGAACAAAAACTTATTTCTGAAGAAGATCTGC-3′ and 5′-CATGGCAGATCTTCTTCAGAAATAAGTTTTTGTTCCATGAGCT-3′. The underlined nucleotides of primer 2 represent theNcoI sticky end, and the bold nucleotides represent theSacI sticky end; the remaining bases are complementary to primer 1. The primers (10 μm each) were annealed at 60 °C for 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting linker was ligated into the pBlue-PI-TPα constructs that were previously digested with SacI and NcoI. The ensuing constructs were digested with SacI andBamHI, and the resulting DNA encoding Myc-tagged PI-TPα were ligated into the corresponding sites of the pBK-CMV expression vector. The obtained constructs were denoted as pBK-CMV-Myc-wtPI-TPα, pBK-CMV-Myc-PI-TPα(S166A), and pBK-CMV-Myc-PI-TPα(S166D). Expression of these constructs yields PI-TPα fused to an N-terminal peptide containing the 9E10 epitope (the peptide EQKLISEEDL) of the human c-Myc protein (Myc-tagged). NIH3T3 cells were seeded 24 h prior to transfection at 1 × 104 cells/cm2. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of the pBK-CMV-Myc-PI-TPα constructs using the FuGENE6 Transfection Reagent kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The following day the cells were reseeded at approximately 5 × 103 cells/cm2. After another 24 h, G418 (0.4 mg/ml) was added for selection of G418-resistant cells. Fresh medium containing G418 was added every 4 days, and resistant clones were identified after 3 weeks of growth. The localization of endogenous PI-TPα, Myc-tagged wtPI-TPα, Myc-tagged PI-TPα(S166A), and Myc-tagged PI-TPα(S166D) in serum-starved (semi-quiescent) NIH3T3 cells was determined before and after stimulation with PMA or platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) as described in Ref. 15.Snoek G.T. Westerman J. Wouters F.S. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar. Briefly, NIH3T3 cells were made semi-quiescent by replacing the growth medium with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% newborn calf serum. After 2 days the cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with PMA (50 ng/ml) or PDGF (20 ng/ml) and fixed with methanol (endogenous PI-TPα) or paraformaldehyde (Myc-tagged PI-TPαs). Endogenous PI-TPα was visualized by indirect immunofluorescence using a polyclonal antibody directed against PI-TPα and goat-anti-rabbit-Cy3 as the second antibody. Myc-tagged PI-TPαs were visualized using a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the Myc-tagged and goat anti-mouse tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate as the second antibody. The effect of PMA and PDGF on the production of lysoPI in NIH3T3 cells before and after stimulation with PMA or PDGF was determined as described in Ref. 12.Snoek G.T. Berrie C.P. Geijtenbeek T.B. van der Helm H.A. Cadee J.A. Iurisci C. Corda D. Wirtz K.W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35393-35399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar. Briefly, NIH3T3 cells were cultured in a 6-well plate to 80% confluency. The cell cultures were incubated for 48 h with 2 μCi of [3H]-myo-inositol in HEPES-buffered DF medium without inositol containing 2% dialyzed newborn calf serum. Cultures were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with DF medium (without inositol) containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin and 10 mm LiCl. Subsequently, PMA (50 ng/ml) or PDGF (20 ng/ml) was added, and the incubation was continued for another 15 min. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 1 ml of −20 °C methanol. The [3H]inositol phospholipids were extracted and analyzed as described previously (23.Falasca M. Corda D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the charge isomers PI-TPαI and II from bovine brain was determined in vitroas a function of concentration. From the Lineweaver-Burk plot it was calculated that the V max of the phosphorylation of PI-TPαI was 2.0 nmol/min and that of PI-TPαII 6.0 nmol/min (Fig.1 A). The K mof either reaction was comparable (0.65 and 0.72 μm, respectively). This implies that the affinity of rat brain PKC for both isomers is the same, yet that PI-TPα containing a PC molecule is phosphorylated at a faster rate than the protein containing a PI molecule. To confirm these results we have done similar experiments on mouse recPI-TPα. RecPI-TPα contains a PG molecule that can be readily exchanged for either PI or PC (16.Geijtenbeek T.B. de Groot E. van Baal J. Brunink F. Westerman J. Snoek G.T. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the charge isomers of recPI-TPα by PKC confirmed that the PC-containing protein was phosphorylated at a faster rate than the PI-containing protein (Fig. 1 B). In addition, phosphorylation of the PG-containing recPI-TPα was comparable with that of the PC-containing protein (data not shown). In comparison with the bovine PI-TPαs the mouse recPI-TPαs were better substrates, withV max values about 1 order of magnitude higher and K m values 1 order of magnitude lower (0.1 μm). Two-dimensional analysis of tryptic32P-labeled peptides showed that PI-TPαI, PI-TPαII and recPI-TPα have one major phosphopeptide in common as well as a minor one. The phosphopeptide map of PI-TPαII showed three additional minor spots (Fig. 2). Phosphoamino acid analysis of the in vitro phosphorylated proteins demonstrated that all three PI-TPαs are mainly phosphorylated on serine (Fig. 3). The immunoprecipitated PI-TPα from PMA-stimulated 32P-labeled Swiss mouse 3T3 cells was p"
https://openalex.org/W2154137725,"Human glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (QRS) is one of several mammalian aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) that form a macromolecular protein complex. To understand the mechanism of QRS targeting to the multi-ARS complex, we analyzed both exogenous and endogenous QRSs by immunoprecipitation after overexpression of various Myc-tagged QRS mutants in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Whereas a deletion mutant containing only the catalytic domain (QRS-C) was targeted to the multi-ARS complex, a mutant QRS containing only the N-terminal appended domain (QRS-N) was not. Deletion mapping showed that the ATP-binding Rossman fold was necessary for targeting of QRS to the multi-ARS complex. Furthermore, exogenous Myc-tagged QRS-C was co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous QRS. Since glutaminylation of tRNA was dramatically increased in cells transfected with the full-length QRS, but not with either QRS-C or QRS-N, both the QRS catalytic domain and the N-terminal appended domain were required for full aminoacylation activity. When QRS-C was overexpressed, arginyl-tRNA synthetase and p43 were released from the multi-ARS complex along with endogenous QRS, suggesting that the N-terminal appendix of QRS is required to keep arginyl-tRNA synthetase and p43 within the complex. Thus, the eukaryote-specific N-terminal appendix of QRS appears to stabilize the association of other components in the multi-ARS complex, whereas the C-terminal catalytic domain is necessary for QRS association with the multi-ARS complex.

Although catalytic domains from homologous synthetases are highly conserved from bacteria to mammals, mammalian ARSs have acquired unique peptide appendices that are not present in the corresponding prokaryotic enzymes (1.Kisselev L.L. Wolfson A.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 83-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 2.Mirande M.

Eight of the mammalian ARSs are found in a high molecular weight multi-ARS complex with three noncatalytic proteins, p43, p38, and p18, whereas the corresponding bacterial ARSs do not form such a complex (1.Kisselev L.L. Wolfson A.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 83-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 2.Mirande M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 3.Yang D.C.H. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1996; 34: 101-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 4.Dang C.V. Dang C.V. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This suggests that the peptide appendices might be involved in protein-protein interactions within the multi-ARS complex. Furthermore, intact rat aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (DRS) associates in vivowith the multi-ARS complex, whereas the N-terminal appendix-deleted form does not (5.Mirande M. Lazard M. Martinez R. Latreille M.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), indicating that the appended domain is indispensable for targeting DRS to this complex. Protein-protein interactions between the appendices of various ARSs have previously been shown using the yeast two-hybrid system (6.Rho S.B. Kim M.J. Lee J.S. Seol W. Montegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4488-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Similarly, p43 associates with the N-terminal appendix of human arginyl-tRNA synthetase (RRS), stimulating its aminoacylation activity (7.Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.J. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16673-16676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition to a role in protein-protein interactions, ARS appended domains could also enhance aminoacylation activity by recruiting tRNAs. Previously it has been shown that the N-terminal appended domain of yeast QRS nonspecifically binds to both double- and single-stranded RNA (8.Wang C.C. Scimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16508-16512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fusion of this domain to Escherichia coli QRS confers the ability to aminoacylate yeast tRNA (9.Whelihan E.F. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2968-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Similarly, a tandemly repeated appendix of EPRS associates with various nucleic acids including RNA, tRNA, DNA, and minihelix (10.Rho S.B. Lee J.S. Jeong E.-J. Kim K.-S. Kim Y.G. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11267-11273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11.Cahuzac B.B.E. Birlirakis N. Guittet E. Mirande M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, nonspecific RNA-protein interactions via the appended domain might increase aminoacylation efficiency. Since chaotropic salts and detergents dissociate the components of the multi-ARS complex, it has been suggested that hydrophobic interactions between the protein components are responsible for its assembly (12.Norcum M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15398-15405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Sihag R.K. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol.

J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Despite extensive studies, the molecular architecture and physiological significance of the multi-ARS complex remain elusive. Although protein-protein interactions between the appended domains of the ARSs have been shown, it is not clear whether these interactions are essential for the assembly of the multi-ARS complex. Thus, we have investigated the role of QRS in the molecular mechanism of assembly of the multi-ARS complex. We demonstrate that the C-terminal catalytic domain of QRS plays a major role in promoting its association with the multi-ARS complex. Furthermore, the N-terminal appendix of QRS is necessary for the association of RRS and p43 to the multi-ARS complex and is indispensable for QRS aminoacylation activity. MRS, and IRS (denatured full-length), YRS, WRS, p43, and p38 (native full-length), EPRS (the native peptide of three repeats), LRS (denatured peptide of C-terminal 236 amino acids), QRS (native N-terminal 236 amino acids), and RRS (native N-terminal 72 amino acids) were overexpressed as His-tagged proteins using E. coli and then purified using nickel affinity chromatography following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were then raised against these proteins as described previously (7.Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.J. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16673-16676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The IgG from each antiserum was purified by protein A affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad), and the antibody specificity was confirmed by immunoblotting (data not shown). Anti-Myc antibody was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The cDNAs encoding the full-length, N-terminal 236 amino acids (QRS-N) and C-terminal 539 amino acids (QRS-C) of QRS were generated using polymerase chain reaction from pM191 (Dr. K. Shiba, Cancer Institute, Tokyo, Japan) and ligated into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) containing Myc and FLAG tags using the EcoRI and NotI sites. The full-length QRS in pcDNA3 (pcDNA3-QRS-F) was cleaved withEcoRI and re-ligated to generate the DNA encoding the C-terminal 318 amino acids (QRS-(458–775)). pcDNA3-QRS-F was digested with XbaI (partial digestion) or ApaI and re-ligated to generate the DNAs encoding QRS-(1–552) and QRS-(1–653), respectively. QRS-(Δ380–568) and QRS-(Δ179–653) were generated by re-ligation after digestion of pcDNA3-QRS-F withNcoI and ApaI, respectively. Finally, QRS-(237–458) and QRS-(237–552) were constructed by intra-ligation of the larger fragments after digestion of pcDNA3-QRS-C withEcoRI and XbaI, respectively. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator. 100-mm dishes of 293 cells were transfected with 4 μg of the indicated Myc-tagged pcDNA3-QRS plasmid using Geneporter (Gene Therapy Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmEGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) for 30 min, and microcentrifuged (14,000 rpm, 4 °C, 10 min). The lysate (1 mg of protein) was incubated with anti-Myc antibody (5 μg) and protein A-agarose (50 μl) for 4 h. Samples were washed four times with lysis buffer and then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline. The ARS complex and Myc-tagged QRS derivatives were visualized by sequential treatment with specific antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 293 cells transfected with the indicated QRS expression vector or empty vector were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were resuspended in a hypotonic buffer plus protease inhibitors (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml chymostatin A, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/mll-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone). Resuspended cells were lysed by gentle sonication and centrifuged at 33,000 × g for 20 min, at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. Twenty micrograms of cell lysate was mixed with reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm ATP, and 0.12 μCi/μl [3H]glutamine), and the reaction was initiated by adding bovine liver total tRNA (0.4 μg/μl). Reaction samples were taken at 1.5-min intervals and spotted on filter discs presoaked with 5% trichloroacetic acid. After 1 min, the filter discs were added to ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and washed three times with fresh 5% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C. The filter discs were dehydrated by incubation with 95% ethanol at 4 °C, and the radioactivity adsorbed to the filters was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Cell lysate (5 mg of total protein) in hypotonic buffer was loaded into a Superdex 200 HR column (exclusion limit of 1300 kDa) using AKTA-fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted at the flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. 50 μl of each fraction (0.3 ml) was analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against Myc, EPRS, IRS, LRS, MRS, QRS, p43, and p38 as indicated. We compared QRS sequences from E. coli, yeast, and human in an attempt to identify a domain of QRS that would target it to the multi-ARS complex. As shown in Fig.1, human QRS contains a unique N-terminal appendix (amino acids from 1 to 236) that is not present in prokaryotes but conserved in eukaryotic organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster. Although the N-terminal appendix of human QRS interacts with RRS, IRS, and MRS (6.Rho S.B. Kim M.J. Lee J.S. Seol W. Montegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4488-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), it is not known whether this domain is a determinant for targeting QRS to the multi-ARS complex. In order to map the domain of QRS targeting it to the multi-ARS complex, we constructed various Myc epitope-tagged deletion mutants of QRS. The mutant QRS constructs used in this study are shown schematically in Fig. 2 A. QRS-N and -C represent the appended or catalytic domain, respectively. The constructs were transiently overexpressed in 293 cells, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. The precipitated complex was immunoblotted using a mixture of antibodies specific to EPRS, LRS, MRS, QRS, RRS, YRS, WRS, and p43. Fig.2 B shows that QRS-F and -C were co-immunoprecipitated with the EPRS, LRS, MRS, RRS, and p43 components of the multi-ARS complex, whereas QRS-N was not. Cells were then transiently transfected with expression vectors for Myc-GRS and -CRS, which are known not to be associated with the multi-ARS complex (1.Kisselev L.L. Wolfson A.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 83-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As above, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and then immunoblotted with the antibody mixture. No components of the multi-ARS complex were detected in association with either Myc-GRS or -CRS, thus confirming the specificity of multi-ARS complex interactions with QRS-F and -C. In addition, Amido Black staining of the membrane also confirmed that the immunoprecipitates of QRS-F and QRS-C contained bands corresponding to EPRS, IRS, LRS, MRS, RRS, and p43, whereas QRS-N did not (Fig.2 C). Interestingly, QRS could be present as an oligomer in the multi-ARS complex since QRS-C also co-immunoprecipitated endogenous QRS (endogenous QRS is indicated with an arrowhead in Fig.2, B and C). These data suggest that QRS-C and endogenous QRS could co-exist in the multi-ARS complex. In order to map the region of QRS-C interacting with the multi-ARS complex, different Myc-tagged QRS derivatives were transiently expressed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc. As shown in Fig.3, QRS-(1–552) and QRS-(1–653) were co-immunoprecipitated with the multi-ARS complex, but QRS-(458–775) was not, suggesting that the region from amino acids 237–457 is necessary for QRS targeting to the multi-ARS complex. Furthermore, the QRS derivatives, QRS-(Δ380–568) and QRS-(Δ179–653), which also do not contain amino acids 380–568, were not targeted to the multi-ARS complex. Indeed, QRS deletion mutants containing the amino acid regions 237–457 and 237–552 were all incorporated into the multi-ARS complex (Fig. 3). These mapping data demonstrate that the region of QRS from amino acids 237 to 457 is a domain needed to target QRS to the multi-ARS complex. This region is an ATP-binding domain that is called Rossman fold (16.Freist W. Gauss D.H. Ibba M. Soll D. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 103-117Google Scholar). Thus, our data indicate that the Rossman fold is necessary for protein-protein interaction within the multi-ARS complex. Since QRS-C itself was sufficient for the association with the multi-ARS complex, we asked whether this domain alone could catalyze aminoacylation of tRNAGln. To address this issue, we transfected QRS-F, QRS-N, and QRS-C into 293 cells and measured the cytoplasmic aminoacylation activity. As shown in Fig.4, the activity in the QRS-F transfected cells was about 6.5-fold that of cells transfected with empty vector (EV), whereas no increase was observed in cells transfected with QRS-N or QRS-C. This result indicates that QRS-C has very little,if any, aminoacylation activity, and the QRS N-terminal appendix is also required for the enzymatic activity of QRS. The incorporation of QRS-C into the multi-ARS complex was also confirmed by gel filtration chromatography using fast protein liquid chromatography (Fig.5). First, each fraction was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-QRS and anti-Myc antibodies. Endogenous QRS from the cells transfected with EV was eluted near the exclusion limit in association with the multi-ARS complex (see fractions 24–26) (Fig.5 A). QRS in QRS-F-transfected cells showed an additional free, non-complexed form, well separated from the multi-ARS complex in fractions 38–48 (Fig. 5 A). Because QRS-F was identified in fractions corresponding to both the multi-ARS complex and the free form when immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody, the overexpressed QRS-F was thought to be largely incorporated into the multi-ARS complex. Like the profile of endogenous QRS protein, its enzymatic activity was also found in both the free form as well as in the multi-ARS complex (Fig.5 B), suggesting that association with the multi-ARS complex is not essential for the catalytic activity of QRS. When cells transfected with QRS-C were analyzed for both QRS-C and endogenous QRS using immunoblotting with anti-Myc and anti-QRS antibodies after gel filtration, we found that QRS-C was targeted to the multi-ARS complex (Fig. 5 A), consistent with the result of co-immunoprecipitation experiment in Fig. 2. Interestingly, a portion of endogenous QRS was also present in the free form,as well as the multi-ARS complex, suggesting that QRS-C replaces endogenous QRS in the multi-ARS complex. Since QRS-C did not change the aminoacylation activity of endogenous QRS (Fig. 4), the free endogenous QRS still appears to have enzymatic activity. The absence of the QRS N-terminal appendix in the multi-ARS complex could disrupt the architecture of multi-ARS complex since the appended domain of QRS interacts with other ARSs such as IRS, RRS, and MRS (6.Rho S.B. Kim M.J. Lee J.S. Seol W. Montegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4488-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, the removal of this domain may destabilize the association of the related components. To address this possibility, we analyzed each fraction in Fig. 6 with anti-EPRS, IRS, LRS, MRS, RRS, p43, and p38 after gel filtration. As shown in Fig.6 A, except for RRS, EV-transfected cells did not show any free form of other multi-ARS components including EPRS, IRS, LRS, MRS, p43, and p38, suggesting that DNA transfection itself does not seriously change the organization of the complex. It should be noted that RRS has been previously reported to exist as a truncated free form as well as in a multi-ARS complex form (17.Sivaram P. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3665-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly, QRS-F-overexpressed cells also showed no free form of EPRS, IRS, LRS, MRS, p43, and p38 (data not shown). However, the incorporation of QRS-C into the complex caused the release of both RRS and p43 (Fig.6 B), suggesting that the absence of QRS N-terminal appendix in the multi-ARS complex disrupts the association of RRS and p43 within the complex. On the other hand, EPRS, IRS, LRS, MRS, and p38 were not released to the free forms from the multi-ARS complex, suggesting that these components were not affected by the absence of the QRS N-terminal appendix. Thus, we conclude that the catalytic domain of QRS is required for targeting QRS to the multi-ARS complex,although its appended domain is necessary for the stabilization of RRS and p43 within the multi-ARS complex. We have previously mapped the protein-protein interactions between various peptide domains of the ARSs that are components of the multi-ARS complex (6.Rho S.B. Kim M.J. Lee J.S. Seol W. Montegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4488-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether these interactions are sufficient to determine the incorporation of each component into the multi-ARS complex. Here, we investigated the importance of various regions of QRS in the molecular organization of the multi-ARS complex by constructing different Myc-tagged derivatives of QRS, transfecting them into 293 cells, then immunoprecipitating these QRS derivatives with anti-Myc, and immunoblotting with antibodies against numerous components of the multi-ARS complex. In addition, we analyzed the multi-ARS complex using gel filtration of cell extracts overexpressing QRS-F or QRS-C. These in vivo experiments yielded several unexpected results that suggest important insights into the assembly of the multi-ARS complex. The targeting domain of QRS to the multi-ARS complex is the Rossman fold that is an ATP-binding site (amino acids 380–457). It was previously demonstrated that the catalytic domain of human YRS binds to the interleukin-8 type A receptor and functions as an interleukin-8-like cytokine (18.Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), indicating that the catalytic domains of ARSs could be involved in protein-protein interaction. Our results also indicate that there may be more than one QRS molecule in the multi-ARS complex. As shown in Fig. 2, endogenous QRS was also co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged QRS-C, suggesting that at least two or more QRS molecules are present in a multi-ARS complex contrary to the previous results in which QRS is found as a monomer within a multi-ARS complex (2.Mirande M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 3.Yang D.C.H. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1996; 34: 101-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We also show that the QRS N-terminal appendix is required for enzymatic activity of QRS (Fig. 4). In many other ARSs, this domain is dispensable for cell survival and aminoacylation activity. For example,S. cerevisiae QRS does not require its extended domain for either cell survival or aminoacylation (19.Ludmerer S.W. Wright D.J. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5519-5523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, human DRS and YRS express aminoacylation activity without their extended N-terminal domain (18.Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 20.Reed V.S. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32937-32941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the complete removal of N-terminal appendix in yeast MRS affects the aminoacylation activity of this enzyme (21.Walter P. Weygand-Durasevic I. Sanni A. Ebel J.P. Fasiolo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17126-17130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the removal of the C-terminal appendix in SRS reduces both the stability of this enzyme and its affinity for substrate (22.Weygand-Durasevic I. Lenhard D. Filipic S. Soll D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2455-2461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our data show that enzymatic activity of QRS requires the appended domain and thus implies that the appendices from some eukaryotic ARSs could play important roles in either enzyme stability or activity. Gel filtration chromatography revealed that the free form of QRS in cells overexpressing QRS-F and QRS-C still possessed aminoacylation activity, suggesting that association with the multi-ARS complex is not essential for enzyme catalysis (Fig. 5). Similarly, human DRS overexpressed in COS cells had aminoacylation activity when not associated with the multi-ARS complex (23.Escalante C. Qasba P.K. Yang D.C.H. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 56-63Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Thus, inclusion in the multi-ARS complex does not appear to be essential for the catalytic activities of several ARSs. The appended domain of QRS was responsible for targeting RRS and p43 into the multi-ARS complex (Fig. 6). When QRS-C was overexpressed, it was incorporated into the multi-ARS complex, whereas endogenous QRS, RRS, and p43 were removed from this complex, instead being found in free forms (Fig. 6). Thus, the removal of the N-terminal appendix disrupts molecular interactions among QRS, RRS, and p43 within a multi-ARS complex, releasing RRS and p43. It should be noted that previously yeast two-hybrid analysis has shown molecular association of QRS with RRS (6.Rho S.B. Kim M.J. Lee J.S. Seol W. Montegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4488-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and RRS with p43 via the appended domains (7.Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.J. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16673-16676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Since QRS-C overexpression does not affect other ARSs such as EPRS, IRS, LRS, MRS, and p38 (Fig. 6), the appended domain of QRS might have a stabilizing role in maintaining RRS and p43 in the multi-ARS complex. Taken together, the data of this work suggest that the catalytic domains of the complex-forming ARSs play an important role in protein-protein interactions within the macromolecular ARS complex. This finding poses an interesting question on the architecture of the complex because it is intriguing how the component ARSs would execute their catalytic activities while their catalytic domains are involved in complex association.

The catalytic activity of the complex is apparent at uPA concentrations close to K d.

In the present study, we show that uPA and recombinant soluble uPAR (suPAR), at concentrations that exceed the K d and the theoretical saturation levels (10–80 nm), establish novel interactions that lead to a further increase in the activity of the single-chain uPA (scuPA)/suPAR and two-chain uPA (tcuPA)/suPAR complexes.

The three techniques provide evidence that the addition of an equimolar concentration of scuPA leads to the dissociation of these dimers and oligomers. Biacore data show that suPAR dimers and oligomers bind scuPA with decreased affinity when compared with monomers. We postulate that uPAR is present in equilibrium between oligomer/dimer/monomer forms. The binding of uPA to suPAR dimers and oligomers occurs with lower affinity than the binding to monomer.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The lack of agreement between the concentrations required for signal transduction and the K d has led to the assumption that the uPA receptor is not involved in uPA-induced signal transduction (30Koopman J.L.

An alternative explanation for the lack of agreement between the knownK d and the uPA concentration needed to induce signal transduction is the existence of additional binding epitopes in both uPA and uPAR, which interact with lower affinity. The possible presence of more than one kind of interaction is supported by our data (32Higazi A.A.-R. Mazar A. Wang J. Quan N. Griffin R. Reilly R. Henkin J. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5348-5353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and the data of others (33Behrendt N. Ronne E. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22885-22894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which indicate that uPAR contains several binding epitopes that participate in the binding of uPA to uPAR. In the present paper we demonstrate the existence of such low affinity interactions. These novel interactions correlate with a modification of the activity of the resultant scuPA/suPAR complex and further activation of tcuPA by suPAR. Furthermore, the low affinity interaction stems from the capacity of suPAR to form dimers and oligomers that bind scuPA with relatively lower affinity and dissociate by the addition of an equimolar concentration scuPA. scuPA, the amino-terminal fragment of scuPA (amino acids 1–135; ATF), low molecular weight scuPA (amino acids 145–411; LMWscuPA), and low molecular weight tcuPA, scuPA, and suPAR (in part) were all gifts of Dr. Jack Henkin (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) and were characterized as described in previous publications (32Higazi A.A.-R.

Neutralizing polyclonal anti-uPAR antibodies were a gift of Dr. Douglas Cines from the University of Pennsylvania. Human thrombin was obtained from Sigma. tcuPA, Glu-plasminogen, and the plasmin substrate Spectrozyme PL were purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). Plasma was obtained from the Hadassah Hospital Blood Bank (Jerusalem). Blood used to obtain plasma was drawn from healthy volunteers. 450 ml of blood were collected in bags produced by Travenol Laboratories (Ashdod, Israel), containing 63 ml of citrate-phosphate-dextrose (CPD) solution (1.66 g of sodium citrate (hydrous), 61 g of dextrose, 206 mg of citric acid, and 140 mg of monobasic sodium phosphate). Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 7.5 min and at 4500 rpm for an additional 5 min to remove platelets. cDNA encoding soluble uPAR (amino acids 1–277), was generated by polymerase chain reaction using pTracer-uPAR as templates. The fragments were digested withBglII and Xho and sub-cloned into the expression vector (pMT/BiP/V5, Invitrogen). Wild-type suPARs was expressed inDrosophila Schneider S2 cells (DES system, Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer and purified from the media using a polyclonal anti-uPAR antibody affinity column. SuPAR from Abbott Laboratories (see “Materials”) was in use too. The plasminogen activator activity was measured in the presence of plasminogen and the plasmin substrate Spectrozyme PL (28Higazi A.A.-R. Cohen R.L. Henkin J. Kniss D. Schwartz B.S. Cines D.B. J.

Briefly, an equimolar concentration of the scuPA/suPAR complex (5 nm) was incubated in the presence or absence of an additional 5 nm suPAR and increasing concentrations of Glu-plasminogen and Spectrozyme PL in PBS, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. The concentration of generated plasmin was calculated during each time interval from the rate of change at 405 nm using a standard curve made with known concentrations of plasmin. The kinetic parameters of plasmin generation were then plotted using a double-reciprocal plot of the rates of plasmin generationversus plasminogen concentration. Purified fibrinogen was radiolabeled with 125I and resuspended in plasma to a specific activity of 30,000 cpm/ml. Clots were formed in 16-mm diameter tissue culture wells (Costar, Cambridge, MA) by adding 0.4 NIH units to 0.4 ml of plasma. Fibrinolysis was measured as described previously (41Higazi A.A.-R.

Briefly, radiolabeled fibrin clots enriched with 100 nm plasminogen were overlaid for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.4 ml of serum containing 25 nmplasminogen activator (scuPA or tcuPA, in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of suPAR), and the release of radiolabeled soluble fibrin degradation products was measured. A TSK3000SW SEC column (Beckman) was equilibrated with PBS. Samples (0.1 ml total volume) were injected using a 0.2-ml loop, and the column was developed with PBS at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Absorbance was measured at 220 nm, and data were collected using a Beckman Gold Chromatography system. Dynamic light scattering was performed with a Dynapro-801 molecular sizing instrument (Protein Solutions, Inc., Charlottesville, VA) equipped with a 20-μl micro-sampling cell at room temperature (22 °C). suPAR and scuPA were in a buffer of 20 mm Tris, pH 7, and 10 mmMES, pH 5.0, respectively, and were concentrated to 2 mg/ml. A complex of suPAR and scuPA was made at 1:1 ratio. All protein solutions were filtered through a membrane of 0.02 μl porosity to remove any dust prior adding to the micro-sampling cell. Fifteen to 20 μl of solutions was used to measure the light-scattering signal. For each sample, at least 10 light-scattering measurements were taken, and the data were processed by Protein Solution's DynaLS and DYNAMICS software, version 4.0. Rotary-shadowed samples were prepared by spraying a dilute solution of protein (final concentration about 15 μg/ml) in a volatile buffer (0.05m ammonium formate, pH 7.4) and 70% glycerol onto freshly cleaved mica and shadowing with tungsten followed by deposition of a carbon film in a vacuum evaporator (Denton Vacuum Co., Cherry Hill, NJ) (36Fowler W.E. Erickson H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 214-249Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 37Veklich Y.I. Gorkun O.V. Medved L.V. Niewenhuizen W. Weisel J.W. J. Biol.

Preparations of scuPA, suPAR, and mixtures of the suPAR/scuPA were made at a molar ratio of 2.5:1. The specimens were examined in a Philips 400 electron microscope (FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR) operating at 80 kV. All experiments were repeated several times, and many micrographs were taken of randomly selected areas to ensure that the results were reproducible and representative. About 1000 particles were counted to determine the prevalence of different particles. Binding of scuPA to suPAR was measured using a BIA 3000 optical Biosensor (Biacore, AB, Sweden) (39Myszka D.G. Curr. Opin. Bio/Technol. 1997; 8: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). This method detects binding interactions in real time by measuring changes in the refractive index at a biospecific surface and enables association and dissociation rate constants to be calculated. For these studies, recombinant suPAR and recombinant scuPA were coupled to CM5 research grade sensor chip flow cells (Biacore) via standard amine coupling procedures (40Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Edstrom A. Muller-Hillgran R.-M. Hanson A. J. Mol. Recognit. 1995; 8: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) usingN-hydroxysuccinimide/methyl-N′-[3-(dimethylamino) propyl] carbodiimine hydrochloride (Pierce) at a level of 1000 relative units each. Sensor surfaces were coated with ligands (10 μg/ml) in 10 mm NaAc buffer, pH 5.0. Following immobilization, unreacted groups were blocked with 1 methanolamine, pH 8.5. A third flow cell, similarly activated and blocked without immobilization of protein, served as a control surface. The binding buffer was PBS, pH 7.4, 0.005% Tween 20. Binding of scuPA was measured at 25 °C at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for 6.7 min followed by 3 min of dissociation. The bulk shift due to changes in the refractive index was measured using the control surface and was subtracted from the binding signal at each condition to correct for nonspecific signals. Surfaces were regenerated with a single 30-s pulse of 1 m NaCl, pH 3.4, followed by an injection of binding buffer for 1 min to remove this high salt solution. All injections were performed in a random fashion using the RANDOM command in the automated method. The response at equilibruim (Req) was calculated as the average response over the last 10 s of association. Data were analyzed by both linear (Scatchard) and nonlinear regression. Linear transformation (43Limbird L.E. Kenakin T. Cell Surface Receptors: A Short Course on Theory and Methods. Martinus Nijhoff, Boston1986: 51-96Google Scholar) was performed using Excel 97 software, fitting the equation R eq/C = −R eq/K d +R max/K d, whereR eq is the response at equilibrium, Cis the concentration of analyte in solution, K d is the equilibrium dissociation constant, and R maxis the maximal specific binding to the surface. Nonlinear regression was performed using GraphPad PRISM 2.0 fitting the binding isotherm directly (R eq =C·R max/(C +K d). Our previous data, as well as those of other laboratories, show that suPAR stimulates the activity of scuPA at concentrations equal or close to the K d (27Manchanda N. Schwartz B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14580-14584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Higazi A.A.-R. Cohen R.L. Henkin J. Kniss D. Schwartz B.S. Cines D.B. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the initial experiments, we examined the effect of increasing the concentrations of the ligands on the activity of the resultant complex. ScuPA (5 nm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of suPAR. As expected, the addition of an equimolar concentration of suPAR stimulated the plasminogen activation activity of scuPA (Fig.1). An additional increase in the concentration of suPAR resulted in a further increase in scuPA activity. The stimulatory effect of suPAR was dose-dependent and saturable. SuPAR alone had no plasminogen activation activity. The presentation of the data as a reciprocal plot (Fig. 1 B) shows that half-maximal stimulation was achieved at a suPAR concentration of 30 nm. To prove that the apparent saturation resulted from a limited scuPA/suPAR interaction and was not the result of other limiting factors, such as the amount of plasminogen, or of the chromogenic plasmin substrate, we added additional amounts of scuPA in the plateau region of the curve (scuPA/suPAR ratio 5/80). Fig.2 shows that by increasing the concentration of scuPA from 5 to 10 nm at a fixed concentration of suPAR (80 nm, which gave a maximal response at 5 nm suPAR), a further increase of scuPA activity was obtained. In addition, Fig. 2 shows that the stimulatory effect of suPAR on scuPA activity could be abolished by the addition of ATF. This observation supports the conclusion that the observed plateau was the result of a limited interaction with suPAR. The inhibitory effect of ATF indicates that the additional interactions depend on the occurrence of primary binding between scuPA and suPAR through the ATF. To further support the role of suPAR in the stimulatory effect, we added polyclonal anti-uPAR antibodies. Fig. 2 shows that the anti-uPAR antibodies had the same inhibitory effect as ATF, whereas irrelevant IgG has no effect on the activity of the complex (not shown). Fig. 3 shows that at a scuPA/suPAR ratio of 1:2, the V max, but not theK m, was greater than with equimolar concentrations. The increase in the V max could also be the result of contamination of suPAR by uPA, but this possibility could be excluded because suPAR alone had no activity (Fig. 1) and ATF inhibited the activity. Another possibility is the presence in suPAR of a protease that cleaves scuPA to tcuPA. To exclude this possibility, we incubated scuPA with suPAR for 24 h. Under these conditions, scuPA continued to migrate as a single band when analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE as described elsewhere (28Higazi A.A.-R. Cohen R.L. Henkin J. Kniss D. Schwartz B.S. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17375-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (data not shown). These results suggest that suPAR establishes novel interactions with scuPA that are apparent only at higher concentrations of the ligands and that participation of these binding epitopes induces additional conformational changes in the complex, leading to further activation. To support these conclusions, we used a clot lysis assay. Fig.4 A shows that the scuPA-mediated fibrinolysis of human plasma-derived clots was stimulated in a dose-dependent and saturable manner by suPAR concentrations that exceeded those of scuPA and theK d. In previous publications, we showed that suPAR had almost no effect on tcuPA activity when both ligands were present in equimolar concentrations (28Higazi A.A.-R. Cohen R.L. Henkin J. Kniss D. Schwartz B.S. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17375-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 41Higazi A.A.-R. Bdeir K. Hiss E. Arad S. Kuo A. Barghouti I. Cines D.B. Blood. 1998; 92: 2075-2083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The next question to be addressed was, therefore, whether interactions established at higher concentrations of suPAR affected tcuPA activity. Fig. 4 B shows that tcuPA-mediated fibrinolytic activity on human plasma clots was stimulated by suPAR. Marginal stimulation (10%) was observed at a 1:1 concentration ratio, and a further increase of suPAR concentration induced a dose-dependent and saturable stimulation. Maximal stimulation (more than 5-fold) was obtained at tcuPA/suPAR ratios of 1:6. To exclude the possibility that the stimulation was the result of suPAR activity on contaminating scuPA, tcuPA was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Overloaded gels did not reveal the presence of scuPA in the preparation (not shown). To determine whether the effect of suPAR was due to binding to tcuPA or to some other mechanism, we examined the effect of ATF on the stimulation by suPAR. Fig. 4 B shows that the effect of suPAR on tcuPA could be completely inhibited by ATF and that suPAR had no effect on the activity of LMWuPA. Anti uPAR antibodies abolished the effect of suPAR on tcuPA (not shown). In addition, ATF inhibited the stimulatory effect of suPAR on scuPA-mediated fibrinolysis, and suPAR had no effect on LMWscuPA activity (Fig. 4 A). It is widely accepted that uPA binds to suPAR at a 1:1 ratio. uPA binds to its receptor with high affinity and a K d of 1 nm. The observation that suPAR exerts a stimulatory effect at concentrations that exceed the 1:1 ratio and the theoretical saturating concentrations suggests the existence of another kind of interaction of suPAR with uPA. This additional interaction proceeds with relatively lower affinity and leads to additional functional modification of the uPA/uPAR complex. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the activity of the resultant complex is higher and by data from the literature that demonstrate that uPA-induced signal transduction is observed only at concentrations that are much higher than would be predicted from the K d of the bimolecular complex formation (30Koopman J.L. Slomp J. de Bart A.C. Quax P. Verheijen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33267-33272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 42Li C. Liu J.-N. Gurewich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30282-30285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In an attempt to verify the existence of previously unknown interactions between uPA and uPAR, we used several different approaches. First, we used the size exclusion technique. Fig.5 A shows that suPAR exhibited a complex equilibrium when analyzed by SEC-HPLC. SuPAR migrated in two peaks at 4.7 and 8.1 min retention time (RT). In contrast, scuPA migrated as a single peak of 10.9 RT(not shown). Fig. 5 B shows that on SDS-PAGE, scuPA and suPAR injected into the HPLC run as single bands. In an attempt to examine the effect of scuPA on the equilibrium between the different forms of suPAR, we incubated scuPA with suPAR at several molar ratios. Fig. 5 B shows the results of the addition of scuPA at a 1:2 ratio (suPAR excess). Under these conditions, no monomeric scuPA was present, and the second suPAR peak migrated at 8.4 rather than 8.1 min. SDS-PAGE analysis of the protein present in this peak demonstrated that it represents a scuPA-suPAR complex (Fig. 6 B). Fig. 5 C presents the results of the addition of scuPA at a 1:1 ratio. Under these conditions, scuPA shifted both peaks of suPAR to a peak of RT = 8.4 min, which represents the scuPA/suPAR complex (Fig. 6 B). These data suggest that the higher molecular mass form of suPAR is able to interact with scuPA, albeit at a lower affinity. It should be noted that the monomeric scuPA-suPAR complex elutes with aRT (8.4 min) comparable with the 8.1-min peak of suPAR. This fact suggest that the suPAR that eluted with RT = 8.1 min is a dimer. The size exclusion technique shows the status of the isolated ligands and complexes but does not provide information as to the situation under equilibrium conditions. To examine the status of the reactants under equilibrium conditions, we used dynamic light scattering. The dynamic light scattering measures translational diffusion coefficients (D T) of proteins through monitoring the scattered light of protein in solution. Based onD T, the hydrodynamic radius (R h) of the protein can be calculated using the Stokes-Einstein equation: R h =k b T/6πηD T,with Boltzmann's constant (k b), solvent viscosity (η), and temperature Kelvin (T). The molecular weight of the protein is then estimated by fitting the measuredR h to a standard curve derived from 25 globular proteins. Proteins that are either nonspherical in shape or partially unfolded will show apparent molecular weights that are higher than their theoretical molecule weights. Fig. 7 A shows the regularization histogram of scuPA, and illustrates that scuPA is primarily a single species in aqueous solution. Using a monomodal cumulatant analysis, scuPA was found to have an averaged hydrodynamic radius (R h) of 3.77 nm with 16% polydispersity (0.6 nm), corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 73 kDa, based on the standard size/weight relationship for globular proteins. The matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrum of scuPA and SDS-PAGE of scuPA gave a molecular mass of 48,140 Da and ∼47 kDa, respectively (data not shown), and both are close to its theoretical molecular mass, 46,511 Da, derived from protein sequence. The difference of apparent molecular weight from mass when compared with theoretical calculation is believed to be due to the contribution of the carbohydrate present in the protein. In contrast to the monodispersity of scuPA, the regularization histogram of suPAR (Fig. 7 B) reveals some large aggregates with an R h"

The presence of oxidatively damaged phospholipids in a membrane disrupts the normal architecture of a lipid bilayer and might therefore be expected to interfere with prothrombinase activity. To investigate this possibility, we prepared phosphatidylserine-containing lipid vesicles containing oxidized arachidonoyl lipids, and we examined their ability to accelerate thrombin production by prothrombinase. Oxidized arachidonoyl chains caused dose-dependent increases in prothrombinase activity up to 6-fold greater than control values. These increases were completely attenuated by the presence of α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, or ascorbate. Over the course of a 300-min oxidation, the ability of arachidonoyl lipids to accelerate prothrombinase peaked at 60 min and then declined to base-line levels. These results suggest that instead of being impeded by oxidative membrane damage, prothrombinase activity is enhanced by one or more products of nonenzymatic lipid oxidation.

By controlling thrombin production, these mechanisms regulate the various physiological activities of thrombin, including the maintenance of hemostasis, the signaling of smooth muscle and other cells, and the activation of platelets (1Narayanan S. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1999; 29: 275-280PubMed Google Scholar). Platelet plasma membranes are an especially important control point for thrombin production because upon activation they display anionic phosphatidylserine (PS)1 lipids on their outer surface. PS-containing membranes accelerate thrombin production by facilitating the assembly of coagulation factors Va and Xa to form the prothrombinase complex (PTase), and the delivery of prothrombin to this complex for conversion into thrombin (2Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To a large extent, PS lipids facilitate the assembly of PTase and the delivery of substrate by confining these factors to the membrane surface and reducing three-dimensional diffusional processes to two-dimensional processes. However, PS head groups can also accelerate PTase activity by functioning as a regulatory cofactor (3Koppaka V. Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). There are compelling reasons to consider the possible effects of oxidative lipid damage on thrombin production. For instance, oxidation profoundly alters the architecture and chemical properties of phospholipid bilayers (4Lamba O.P. Lal S. Yappert M.C. Lou M.F. Borchman D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1081: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 5Lamba O.P. Borchman D. Garner W.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and the function of PTase is clearly sensitive to the physical state of the membrane (6Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Janssen M.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Rosing J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10000-10008Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Many common cellular processes such as platelet activation release highly reactive oxygen species that can oxidize lipoproteins (7Gorog P. Kovacs I.B. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 115: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Oxidation, in turn, dramatically increases the ability of lipoproteins to accelerate the activity of the PTase complex and produce more thrombin (8Rota S. McWilliam N.A. Baglin T.P. Byrne C.D. Blood. 1998; 91: 508-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The principal sites of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic oxidation in a membrane are the olefinic groups of unsaturated fatty acyl chains. Although the fatty acyl chains of membrane lipids have long been regarded as having little or no effect on the catalytic activity of coagulation factor complexes (9Jones M.E. Lentz B.R. Dombrose F.A. Sandberg H. Thromb. Res. 1985; 39: 711-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), more recent studies have reported that unsaturated acyl chains do increase the intrinsick cat for PTase, compared with saturated acyl chains (10Kung C. Hayes E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25838-25848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This difference was evident even after accounting for changes in substrate transport due to altered lipid “fluidity” and was confirmed using the soluble substrate, prethrombin-1. Other investigators (6Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Janssen M.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Rosing J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10000-10008Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Gerads I. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Tans G. Zwaal R.F.A. Rosing J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7967-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have also used prethrombin-1 and found no such effect, but they nonetheless observed that PTase activity is accelerated by phosphatidylcholine vesicles if unsaturated acyl chains were present, especially at relatively low concentrations of phosphatidylserine. Thus, the evidence suggests that the acyl chain composition of membrane lipids can influence PTase activity, at least under some circumstances. Taken together with the susceptibility of unsaturated acyl chains to oxidative damage, and the production of potent oxidizing agents by platelets and other cells capable of supporting PTase activity, these observations suggest that unsaturated and oxidized fatty acyl chains on PTase activity may have significant effects on thrombin production by PTase. To facilitate their detection and characterization of these effects, these investigations have been conducted in a chemically defined in vitro system consisting of synthetic lipid vesicles and purified human coagulation factors. 1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospholine (DMPC), 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DMPS), and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SAPC) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All three lipid species were ordered specially packaged in 5–15-mg quantities, under argon, in sealed glass ampules and were stored at −20 °C until the day of use. Dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentadyl)amide, human prothrombin, and factors Xa and Va were obtained from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Chromogenic substrates S-2238 and S-2765 were obtained from Diapharma Group Inc. (Franklin, OH). Solvents for mass spectrometry were obtained from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegon, MI). All other reagents were obtained from Fisher or Sigma. Phospholipids were dissolved in chloroform, mixed in the appropriate molar ratios, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and suspended in reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.05% w/v PEG8000, pH 7.2) using mild bath sonication for 10 min. All mixtures contained 20 mol % DMPS and 0, 5, 10, 20, or 40 mol % SAPC, with the remainder composed of DMPC. Vesicles were prepared by extrusion at 37 °C through 100-nm polycarbonate filters and were used within 2 days. To minimize spontaneous oxidation during these procedures, efforts were made to prevent the exposure of lipid vesicles to atmospheric oxygen by degassing buffers and performing all manipulations under argon. Phospholipid concentrations were determined by phosphate assay (12Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Morrison W.R. Anal. Biochem. 1964; 7: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). To prepare vesicles containing oxidized SAPC, an aqueous suspension of pure SAPC in 50 mmTris buffer, pH 7.5, was extruded at 25 °C through 100-nm polycarbonate filters to produce unilamellar vesicles. A 100 μm suspension of these vesicles was oxidized with H2O2 (2 mm) and CuSO4(200 μm) in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, that had been presaturated with nitrogen gas (14Vossen R.C.R.M. van Dam-Mieras M.C.E. Hornstra G. Zwaal R.F.A. Lipids. 1993; 28: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The extent of peroxidation was estimated by following conjugated diene formation with UV absorption spectrometry at 234 nm (14Vossen R.C.R.M. van Dam-Mieras M.C.E. Hornstra G. Zwaal R.F.A. Lipids. 1993; 28: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Oxidation was terminated by withdrawing aliquots at prescribed times, adding 75 μmbutylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and 75 mm EDTA, followed immediately by vigorous extraction with 2 volumes of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v), and storage at −80 °C under argon until used. For control unoxidized experiments, no Cu2+ or peroxide was added, but the samples were extracted after adding BHT and EDTA. Lipid extraction efficiency (inferred from the fraction of phosphate recovered in the organic phase) approached 100% for unoxidized samples but fell as low as 40% for lipids that had been extensively oxidized. The extracted organic phase was then mixed with chloroform solutions of DMPC and DMPS in a molar ratio of 10:70:20, dried under nitrogen, resuspended in reaction buffer, and extruded in the same manner as for vesicles not containing SAPC. When used, 400 μm vitamin C (Sigma) was added to the reaction mixture prior to the addition of oxidizing agents. When used, α-tocopherol (type V, Sigma, T-3634) or γ-tocopherol (Sigma) was added (0.1 mol/mol SAPC) to the stock solution of SAPC prior to any manipulations. Prothrombinase was assembled by incubation of lipid vesicles (200 μm) factor Va (5 nm) and factor Xa (100 pm) in “reaction” buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.05% w/v PEG8000) at 37 °C for 5 min. The active concentration of a factor Xa stock solution was determined each day using the chromogenic substrate, S-2765 (Diapharma, OH). Thrombin generation was initiated by the addition of prothrombin to the assembled PTase. The final concentrations in this mixture were 200 μm lipid, 5 nm factor Va, 100 pm factor Xa, and 1.4 μm prothrombin. Aliquots of the reaction were halted with “quench” buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmEDTA, 0.1% w/v PEG8000) after 1–3 min. Thrombin production was assayed at 25 °C using the chromogenic substrate, S-2238 (Diapharma, OH). Samples of the oxidized SAPC extract were dried under nitrogen and suspended in 1% acetic acid in water:methanol:chloroform (2:5:2). An aliquot of the sample solution was injected using a syringe pump at 20 μl/min into a VG Quattro II mass spectrometer (Micromass, Beverly, MA) equipped with a coaxial electrospray probe and triple-quadrupole analyzer. The sampling cone voltage was set to 4 kV, and the source temperature was set to 60 °C. The analyzer was set to scan repetitively fromm/z 50 to 1000 in 5 s. The post-oxidation lipid extract was hydrolyzed with 10 μl each 15% KOH and methanol for 60 min at room temperature. The solution was acidified with 100 μl of 1 n HCl and extracted with 1 ml of ethyl acetate (EtOAc). Tetradeuterated 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI, 5 ng, was added and the EtOAc was dried under a stream of N2. The pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) ester was formed by adding 10 μl of N,N-diisopropylethylamine and 20 μl 10% Br-PFB in acetonitrile. After 10 min at room temperature, the sample was dried under N2, dissolved in 25 μl of methanol, applied to a TLC plate (LK6D; Whatman, Inc., Clifton, NJ), and developed with EtOAc. A separate plate, to which was applied 2 μg of authentic 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI PFB, was also developed. The plate was dipped in 8% phosphoric acid (H3PO4) in 0.3 m cupric sulfate (CuSO4) and heated on a hot plate in order to visualize the standard. The corresponding zone was scraped from the sample plate, extracted from 100 μl water with 1 ml of EtOAc, and dried. The trimethylsilyl ether was formed by adding 10 μl each of bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) and pyridine and allowing the sample to stand for 10 min. Br-PFB, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, dodecane, pyridine were purchased from Sigma. After drying, the sample was dissolved in 20 μl of dodecane for analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The analytic conditions were similar to those previously published (15Pratico D. Barry O.P. Lawson J.A. Adiyaman M. Hwang S.W. Khanapure S.P. Iuliano L. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The instrument used was a Fisons MD-800 mass spectrometer interfaced with a Fisons 8060 gas chromatograph (Finnigan, San Jose, CA). The gas chromatographic column was a 0.25 mm × 30 m (0.25 μm) DB5-MS (J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA). The column oven was held at 190 °C for 1 min after injection and then programmed at 20 oC/min to 320 oC. The carrier gas was helium. The injector was held at 260 oC and the interface at 300 oC. The mass spectrometer was operated in the negative ion electron capture mode, using NH3 as the moderating gas. Ions at m/z 569.4 for the endogenous 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI and m/z 573.4 for the tetradeuterated internal standard were alternately monitored. The retention time was 9.1 min, and quantitation was performed using peak area ratios. The addition of SAPC to vesicles otherwise composed of DMPC and DMPS increased PTase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). The activity of PTase on pure SAPC vesicles was more than 10-fold lower than that on DMPC/DMPS vesicles (data not shown). This merely shows that SAPC by itself, in the absence of DMPS, is not able to support a high level of PTase activity. Because we allow time for the assembly of PTase before the assay is performed, these data reflect increased activity rather than faster assembly of complex. Mass spectrometry of the SAPC lipid used for these experiments did not detect any oxidation products before it was incorporated into vesicles. Nevertheless, the increased PTase activity was almost completely suppressed when antioxidants were present (Fig. 2). These results suggests that SAPC undergoes spontaneous oxidation in the course of our experimental manipulations (despite efforts to minimize the exposure of lipid to atmospheric oxygen), that the increase in PTase activity is most likely due to oxidized SAPC, and that unoxidized SAPC by itself probably does not increase PTase activity.Figure 2PTase activity in the presence of SAPC subjected to oxidation in the presence and absence of antioxidants. BHT was added to all samples after oxidation. The specific activity of PTase on vesicles containing 10 mol % SAPC oxidized for various times is normalized to its specific activity on vesicles containing 80 mol % DMPC and 20 mol % DMPS. Error bars are mean ± S.D. for the number of measurements made in three series on each of 1–4 different days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To verify that increased PTase activity was caused by oxidized SAPC and that antioxidants didn't simply inhibit PTase, we intentionally oxidized SAPC with Cu2+/peroxide for periods up to 300 min and added BHT to all samples after oxidation. PTase activity increased with oxidation times up to 60 min but decreased to base-line levels with longer oxidation times (Fig. 2). Vesicles made with 10 mol % SAPC that had been oxidized for 60 min exhibited a 6-fold increase relative to pure DMPS/DMPC vesicles (p< 0.01). The omission of any component of the PTase complex, namely Ca2+, liposomes, factors Xa, Va, or II, reduced PTase activity by at least 3 orders of magnitude (data not shown). The presence of ascorbate, α-tocopherol, or γ-tocopherol in the oxidizing reaction dramatically attenuated the oxidation-induced increases in PTase activity. At times from 30 to 210 min, α-tocopherol was significantly (p < 0.05) better than ascorbate at attenuating this increase, although the effect of ascorbate was significant at all times examined (p < 0.05). The effects of α-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol were approximately equivalent at all times, bringing PTase activity to the level seen in unoxidized vesicles. In all of the experiments described to this point, SAPC was oxidized apart from the other lipids to facilitate the removal of oxidizing agents, simplify the analysis of oxidation products, and to make unambiguous the lipid species undergoing oxidation. Products from the oxidation reaction were characterized spectrophotometrically and by mass spectrometry. UV spectra of SAPC vesicles undergoing Cu2+/peroxide oxidation initially developed a broad band maximal at 242 nm (Fig. 3 A). Over time, this maximum shifted toward 234 nm, providing evidence for the formation of conjugated dienes (14Vossen R.C.R.M. van Dam-Mieras M.C.E. Hornstra G. Zwaal R.F.A. Lipids. 1993; 28: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Weak vibronic bands apparent at 274 and 285 nm between 60 and 120 min indicated the formation of conjugated trienes, but a single broad band maximal at 265 nm dominates this region of the spectrum after 300 min and may represent either ketone dienes or conjugated trienes (16Harrison K.A. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17273-17278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The shape and amplitudes of these spectra were reproducible to within 10%. The oxidation-induced absorption maximum at 234 nm initially increased with time and then gradually decreased (Fig. 3 B). This is evidence that conjugated dienes are formed and then decay in the course of this reaction (17Recknagel R.O. Glende Jr., E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The data also demonstrate that oxidation proceeds at a significant rate even without the Cu2+/peroxide oxidants. SAPC vesicles in Tris buffer that are merely kept in a cuvette at room temperature for 6 h without added oxidants or antioxidants exhibit an absorbance at 234 nm that was more than 12% of the absorbance at 2 h for a sample oxidized with Cu2+/peroxide. By this measure, therefore, the chemical oxidation procedure used in these experiments was approximately 30-fold faster than air oxidation. An extract of the SAPC oxidation product was assayed for the presence of 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI, a major urinary F2-isoprostane (18Li H.W. Lawson J.A. Reilly M. Adiyaman M. Hwang S.W. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13381-13386Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). F2-isoprostanes are chemically stable products of free radical-catalyzed lipid peroxidation (19Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R. Campbell M.D. Zackert W.E. Daniel V.C. Badr K.F. Blair I.A. Roberts L.J., II J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4317-4326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Patrono C. FitzGerald G.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2309-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI was readily detected after 30 min of oxidation. These results show that in vitrooxidation of SAPC produces at least some of the same complex oxidation products produced in vivo. Extracted SAPC oxidation products were also characterized by electrospray mass spectroscopy. As shown in Fig.5, peaks at m/z 810 and 833 confirm the identity of SAPC and sodiated SAPC before oxidation. The absence of other peaks is evidence for the purity of the SAPC lipid used. Higher molecular weight species appear with progressively larger signals after 120, 210, and 300 min of oxidation. We attribute peaks atm/z 842, 874, 906, and 938 after 300 min of oxidation to the presence of mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-hydroperoxide derivatives of SAPC. The peaks at m/z 864, 896, 928, and 960 are likely to be the corresponding sodiated derivatives. There are small peaks atm/z 858, 890, and 922 suggesting the addition of 3:2, 5:2, and 7:2 molecules of O2 to SAPC. Peaks appearing atm/z 857 and 931 are not identified. Despite the multitude of oxidation products after 300 min, the parent peak at m/z 810 remains the dominant feature of the spectrum. Although we have made no attempt to quantitate the absolute amount of SAPC in these samples, normalization of each spectrum according to the magnitude of m/z 810 permits us to conclude that the relative concentration of these oxy addition products increases over the course of 300 min. Mass spectra below m/z 800 at 60 min exhibit very few peaks down to m/z 400, and at no point is there a peak in the 60-min spectrum that is more prominent than at all other times. At 300 min, the mass spectra exhibit numerous peaks belowm/z 800; identification is difficult, however, because the sample is a complex mixture of reaction products and not the fragmentation of a single species. As expected, the presence of α-tocopherol (10 mol % relative to SAPC) suppresses the formation of all oxidation products (Fig. 5). Only a small amount of monohydroperoxide atm/z 842 and a trace amount of dihydroperoxide atm/z874 are detected after 300 min of oxidation. The lack of a more substantial peak at m/z 874 in the presence of α-tocopherol and the increasing magnitude of this peak with time in the absence of α-tocopherol weigh against the possibility that this peak is due to a cuprous ion, Cu(I), adduct. Although the concentration of conjugated dienes appears to decay after 120 min (Figs. 3 and 4), we are unable to identify any peaks in the mass spectra at 120 min that subsequently decay (Fig. 5). Our results indicate that the oxidation of a polyunsaturated phospholipid increases PTase activity in a dose-dependent manner and that the antioxidants ascorbate, α-tocopherol, and γ-tocopherol are effective at preventing the chemical changes that cause this increased activity. Our findings corroborate an earlier report in which the phospholipid component of low density lipoprotein particles was shown to accelerate PTase when oxidized (8Rota S. McWilliam N.A. Baglin T.P. Byrne C.D. Blood. 1998; 91: 508-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The findings also add two important dimensions to the earlier results by reproducing the PTase acceleration in a system where the substrate undergoing oxidation (SAPC) is chemically defined and by showing that the effect is not related in a simple way to the concentration of the principal oxidation products. Esterified arachidonoyl chains comprise the vast majority of the olefinic groups in a membrane. Arachidonate and oleate are the two main unsaturated fatty acyl chains in the phospholipids of a platelet plasma membrane and are present in roughly equal portions (21Marcus A.J. Ullman H.L. Safier L.B. J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 108-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22White D.A. Ansell G.B. Hawthorne J.N. Dawson R.M.C. Form and Function of Phospholipids. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1973Google Scholar). However, there are four times as many olefinic groups in arachidonate as in oleate. Hence, the vast majority of sites in a platelet membrane that are susceptible to nonenzymatic oxidation are found in SAPC. Dimyristoyl lipids were chosen as a “background” lipid because they are saturated and in liquid crystalline phase at 37 °C. The mechanism by which lipid peroxidation increases PTase activity may be either physical or chemical. Physical explanations are plausible because the introduction of SAPC into DMPC/DMPS perturbs membrane structure with longer acyl chains and olefinic groups. The olefinic groups are relatively hydrophilic in this context (i.e.compared with completely saturated chains), and they become much more so when oxidized. Therefore, both the introduction of longer chains and the oxidation of those chains will tend to disorder the bilayer membrane. Thus, one possible explanation for our results is that increased PTase activity is due to increased membrane disorder, at least to a point. This would be consistent with reports that oleate chains accelerate PTase activity (10Kung C. Hayes E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25838-25848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gerads I. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Tans G. Zwaal R.F.A. Rosing J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7967-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and it is compatible with the suggestion that PTase activity is sensitive to the precise way in which its components are juxtaposed on a membrane (6Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Janssen M.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Rosing J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10000-10008Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Even if this is not the sole explanation for accelerated PTase, the relatively short acyl chains of DMPC/DMPS may amplify the effects of the direct cause. However, a physical explanation as the primary cause of this effect is not supported by our finding that PTase activity is unchanged from base-line values in the presence of 10 mol % SAPC and lipophilic antioxidants. Chemical explanations for the acceleration of PTase activity by oxidized SAPC include the generation of specific accelerators of PTase via oxidation or phase separation of lipids. Our finding that the effect of SAPC oxidation diminishes after 60 min (Fig. 2) is consistent with the transient creation of partially oxidized compounds with PTase-accelerating properties. Lipid peroxidation is a complex process resulting in heterogeneous mixtures of derivatives that accumulate at different rates (23Porter N.A. Caldwell S.E. Mills K.A. Lipids. 1995; 30: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). Isoprostanes arise in vivo via nonenzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid and are considered surrogate markers for oxidative stress in human and animal studies (19Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R. Campbell M.D. Zackert W.E. Daniel V.C. Badr K.F. Blair I.A. Roberts L.J., II J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4317-4326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lawson J.A. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24441-24444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Their detection in this system indicates that our procedure for the in vitro oxidation of SAPC produces at least some of the same complex oxidation products produced in vivo. However, mass spectrometry results weigh against acceleration due specifically to the presence of isoprostanes or to the oxidized derivatives of SAPC seen in mass spectra, because the accelerator effect wanes despite an increase in the concentration of these compounds after 90 min (Figs. 4 and 5). Acceleration due to conjugated dienes also seems unlikely, since the peak absorbance at 234 nm occurs at 120 min oxidation, whereas peak PTase activity occurs around 60 min. Of course, extensive oxidation may produce PTase inhibitors or phase separations that reverse the accelerator effect of one of these compounds. However, it would be remarkably coincidental to create an inhibitor that exactly canceled the effect of the accelerator and left PTase activity at its base-line level after 300 min of oxidation. It seems more likely that SAPC oxidation transiently produces a specific accelerator of PTase that is simply not detected by mass spectrometry. The pathological significance of increased endovascular thrombin production cannot be ascertained in this type of in vitrosystem. However, a substantial body of evidence suggests that oxidative chemical processes are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (25Witztum J.L. Lancet. 1994; 344: 793-795Abstract PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar), whereas another largely independent body of evidence suggests that thrombin may have an important role by virtue of its ability to modulate cell behavior (26Smith E.B. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 124: 137-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Observations suggesting a link between these processes include large quantities of oxidized phospholipid in regions of atherosclerotic plaques that are especially thrombogenic (27Fernandez-Ortiz A. Badimon J.J. Falk E. Fuster V. Meyer B. Mailhac A. Weng D. Shah P.K. Badimon L. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1994; 23: 1562-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), high levels of thrombin receptor (PAR-1) found in association with atherosclerotic changes (28Nelken N.A. Soifer S.J.

Invest. 1992; 90: 1614-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and the ability of thrombin to stimulate the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle that is characteristic of atherosclerotic lesions (29Fager G. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Small increases in thrombin production resulting from oxidized lipids may have significant local effects on endothelial cells, and these effects may be integrated over many years."

The cytosolic Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]i) increased during both intervals due to Na+-dependent Ca2+influx by the exchanger. However, the peak rise in [Ca2+]i during the second interval was only 26% of the first. The reduced rise in [Ca2+]i was due to an inhibition of Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity rather than increased Ca2+ sequestration since the influx of Ba2+, which is not sequestered by internal organelles, was also inhibited by a prior interval of Ca2+ influx. Mitochondria accumulated Ca2+ during the first interval of reduced [Na+]o, as determined by an increase in fluorescence of the Ca2+-indicating dye rhod-2, which preferentially labels mitochondria. Agents that blocked mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation (uncouplers, nocodazole) eliminated the observed inhibition of exchange activity during the second period of low [Na+]o. Conversely, diltiazem, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, increased mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation and also increased the inhibition of exchange activity.

We conclude that Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity is regulated by a feedback inhibition process linked to mitochondrial Ca2+accumulation. extracellular Na+concentration cytosolic Ca2+ concentration Chinese hamster ovary 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is an electrogenic, high capacity transporter found in the plasma membrane of many cell types. The exchanger is the primary mechanism for Ca2+efflux in cardiac myocytes, and its activity therefore plays a central role in regulating the force of cardiac muscle contraction (reviewed in Ref. 1.Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of the exchange process is generally considered to be three Na+ ions/Ca2+ (2.Reeves J.P. Hale C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7733-7739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although a higher stoichiometry has been proposed recently (3.Fujioka Y. Komeda M. Matsuoka S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 523: 339-351Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The exchanger can transport Ca2+ in either direction across the plasma membrane, and a reduction in the extracellular Na+concentration ([Na+]o)1leads to a net influx of Ca2+ in cells expressing the exchanger. Regulation of exchange activity through positive modulation by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate or cytosolic Ca2+has been characterized in electrophysiological experiments with excised membrane patches (4.Hilgemann D.W.

Results with transfected cells, cardiac myocytes, and squid giant axons have suggested that exchange activity may also be regulated by protein kinases (6.DiPolo R. Beauge L. Biochim. Biophys.

The importance of these modes of regulation in intact cells under physiological conditions is uncertain, however (see Ref. 11.Reeves J.P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has been investigating the regulation of Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the bovine cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. The results of our studies suggest that the above processes are of limited importance in modulating exchange activity under physiological conditions. Thus, Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity in these cells is nearly fully activated by cytosolic Ca2+ under resting conditions (11.Reeves J.P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and it is not affected by variations in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate that are likely to occur physiologically (12.Reeves, J. P., Condrescu, M., and Fang, Y.

Although exchange activity is inhibited by agents that disturb cytoskeletal integrity in these cells (10.Condrescu M. Gardner J.P. Chernaya G. Aceto J.F. Kroupis C. Reeves J.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33279-33286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the relevance of these findings to more physiological conditions is unclear. In this report, we describe a two-pulse protocol in which Ca2+ influx during a “conditioning” interval in a low [Na+]o medium leads to inhibition of exchange activity during a subsequent “test” interval. The data show that mitochondria accumulate Ca2+ during the conditioning interval of Ca2+ influx and that this process is essential for the subsequent inhibition of exchange activity. These findings reveal a previously unsuspected link between mitochondria and the regulation of Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity. CHO cells expressing Na+/Ca2+exchange activity (CK1.4 cells) were prepared by transfecting the cells (CCL 61, American Type Culture Collection) with the expression vector pcDNAI/Neo (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing a cDNA insert coding for the bovine cardiac Na+/Ca2+exchanger (14.Pijuan V. Zhuang Y. Smith L. Kroupis C. Condrescu M. Aceto J.F. Reeves J.P. Smith J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1066-C1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics as described (14.Pijuan V. Zhuang Y. Smith L. Kroupis C. Condrescu M. Aceto J.F. Reeves J.P. Smith J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1066-C1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Na-PSS contained 140 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 20 mm Mops, adjusted to pH 7.4 (37 °C) with Tris. K-PSS had the same composition as Na-PSS, except that NaCl was replaced with KCl (140 mm total concentration). Na-PSS was diluted 7-fold with K-PSS to yield 20:120 Na/K-PSS. Fura-2/AM, rhod-2/AM, and pluronic F-127 were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). All other biochemicals were purchased from either Sigma or Calbiochem. Oligomycin was a mixture of oligomycins A, B, and C; an average molecular weight of 792 was assumed for computing concentrations. CK1.4 cells were grown on coverslips to 70–80% confluency and incubated for 40 min at room temperature in Na-PSS plus 1% bovine serum albumin containing 3 μmfura-2/AM, 0.25 mm sulfinpyrazone (to retard transport of fura-2 out of the cells), and 0.02% (w/v) pluronic F-127. Fura-2, sulfinpyrazone, and pluronic F-127 were added as 1000-fold concentrated stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide. The coverslips were then rinsed in Na-PSS and mounted in an open stainless steel viewing chamber (Molecular Probes, Inc.). The chamber was then inserted into a thermostatically regulated (37 °C) PDMI-2 open perfusion micro-incubator (Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, NY). Fura-2 fluorescence was measured at 520 nm with alternate excitation at 334 and 380 nm using an Attofluor Ratiovison digital fluorescence imaging system coupled to a Zeiss Axiovert 100 fluorescence microscope. For measurement of Ba2+ influx, a second filter set was employed for alternate excitation at 350 and 390 nm (15.Schilling W.P. Rajan L. Strobl-Jager E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12838-12848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To initiate the Ca2+ influx mode of Na+/Ca2+exchange, Na-PSS was replaced with 20:120 Na/K-PSS for a period of 5 min. The medium was then replaced with Na-PSS for an additional 5 min, followed by a second interval (3 min) in 20:120 Na/K-PSS. Fluorescence signals were calibrated for [Ca2+]i by the procedure of Grynkiewicz et al. (16.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μm ionomycin, 1 μm thapsigargin, and 50 μm EGTA/AM were added to fura-2-loaded cells in Ca2+-free Na-PSS containing 0.6 mm EGTA;R min was recorded after at least 5 min. CaCl2 (10 mm) was subsequently added to determine R max. Significance testing was done using Student's t test. Cells were loaded in the dark with 2 μm rhod-2/AM plus 0.02% (w/v) pluronic F-127 in Na-PSS plus 1% bovine serum albumin for 10–12 min at room temperature. Fluorescence images were acquired using a cooled CCD camera under computer control. The appropriate dichroic reflector and emission filter were selected. Excitation at 548 nm was used with a special long-pass fura-2/rhod-2 emission filter set designed by Chroma Technology Corp. (Brattleboro, VT). The mitochondrion-rich perinuclear regions of the cells were sampled for time-dependent changes in fluorescence during Ca2+ uptake by Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Cells were labeled with 100 nm MitoTracker Green FM (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and 0.02% (w/v) pluronic acid in Na-PSS plus 1% bovine serum albumin for 40 min at room temperature, followed by a rhod-2/AM loading process as described above. The coverslips were rinsed six times to remove excess dye. Cells were then imaged with a Nikon two-laser (argon and helium-neon) PCM 2000 laser scanning confocal microscope using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope and 60X Plan Apo (1.20 WI). Fluorescence images were collected simultaneously with the aid of C-Imaging Systems SimplePCI software (Compix Inc.) using the appropriate rhodamine or fluorescein isothiocyanate filters. In cells expressing Na+/Ca2+exchange activity, a reduction in [Na+]o leads to an increase in [Ca2+]i due to Na+i-dependent Ca2+ influx. For the data shown in Fig. 1, two sequential intervals of low [Na+]o (20 mm), separated by a 5-min recovery period in physiological [Na+]o (140 mm), were applied to fura-2-loaded CHO cells expressing the bovine cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Ca2+ (1 mm) was present in all solutions. During the first (conditioning) interval in 20 mm Na+o, the 334:380 nm excitation ratio for fura-2 rose rapidly from a resting value of 0.44 to a peak value of 1.8 and then declined; the ratios corresponded to approximate [Ca2+]i of 80 and 620 nm, respectively. [Ca2+]i rapidly returned to resting values when [Na+]o was restored to 140 mm. During the second (test) interval in 20 mm Na+o, the increase in the 334:380 nm ratio was 26 ± 3% (n = 29) of that observed during the conditioning pulse (peak [Ca2+]i ∼ 210 nm). Fig. 2 A depicts the effects of varying the duration of the conditioning pulse on the rise in [Ca2+]i during the test pulse. A conditioning pulse of 1 min (trace a) had no effect on the Ca2+ influx during the test pulse. After a 3-min conditioning pulse (trace b), the peak increase in the fura-2 ratio during the test pulse was reduced to 54 ± 6% of the conditioning peak. For 5- and 7-min conditioning pulses (traces c and d, respectively), the test peaks were 37 ± 7 and 41 ± 7% of the conditioning peak, respectively. Thus, a conditioning interval of at least 3 min was required to inhibit the rise in [Ca2+]i during the test pulse. Note that for each time interval, the peak [Ca2+]i attained during the test interval was nearly identical to the [Ca2+]i at the end of the declining phase of the conditioning pulse. In other experiments (data not shown), we varied the duration of the recovery interval between the conditioning and test pulses. Exchange activity remained inhibited following a recovery period of 10 min, but after 30 min of recovery, the rise in [Ca2+]i during the test interval returned to normal. As shown in Fig. 3 (boldface trace), when Ca2+ was omitted from the medium during the conditioning interval in 20 mmNa+o, the rise in [Ca2+]iduring the subsequent test interval was not inhibited. The slight rise in [Ca2+]i during the conditioning interval probably reflected small amounts of residual Ca2+ in the medium. We conclude that Ca2+ influx during the conditioning interval was required to inhibit the rise in [Ca2+]i during the test interval and that the inhibition was not simply a consequence of lowering [Na+]o to 20 mm. The decrease in the peak [Ca2+]iduring the test interval could be due to either a reduced influx of Ca2+, i.e. an inhibition of Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity, or an increase in the sequestration of cytosolic Ca2+ by intracellular organelles. The data in Fig. 4demonstrate that the first alternative is correct, i.e.exchange activity is inhibited during the test pulse. For this experiment, we used Ba2+ as a Ca2+ surrogate during the test pulse. Ba2+ is transported by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, but it is not sequestered by the endoplasmic reticulum and is only poorly, if at all, taken up by mitochondria in these cells (17.Condrescu M. Chernaya G. Kalaria V. Reeves J.P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4(inset), Ba2+ entered cells rapidly when [Na+]o was reduced to 20 mm(arrow) in the presence of 2 mmBa2+o; this Ba2+ concentration was chosen to produce a rise in the fura-2 ratio that was roughly equivalent to that seen with 1 mm Ca2+. For Fig. 4 (main panel), a standard conditioning interval in 20 mm Na+o plus 1 mmCa2+o was applied to the cells. This was followed by a 5-min recovery period in normal Na-PSS before [Na+]o was again reduced to 20 mm, this time in the presence of 2 mm Ba2+. As shown, Ba2+ influx during the test pulse was nearly completely blocked. We conclude that the reduced rise in [Ca2+]i during the test pulse for the experiments shown in Figs. 1 and 2 was due to an inhibition of Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity rather than increased Ca2+ sequestration. We have shown previously that in transfected cells that had been loaded with high concentrations of cytosolic Na+using gramicidin (a channel-forming antibiotic) or ouabain (a Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor), reducing [Na+]o led to large increases in [Ca2+]i and an extensive accumulation of Ca2+ in the mitochondrial compartment (18.Condrescu M. Opuni K. Reeves J.P. Biophys. J. 1999; 76 (abstr.): A253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To examine whether mitochondria also accumulated Ca2+ in the absence of cytosolic Na+ loading, we labeled cells with the Ca2+-sensitive dye rhod-2. This indicator preferentially accumulates within mitochondria because the positively charged, unhydrolyzed form of the dye equilibrates with the negative mitochondrial membrane potential during dye loading (19.Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Fig.5 A shows rhod-2-labeled cells following exposure to 20 mm Na+o in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+o. Rhod-2 fluorescence was intense in the perinuclear region of the cell and showed a particulate pattern suggestive of mitochondria. Prior to reducing [Na+]o, rhod-2 fluorescence was much lower in intensity and more generally distributed throughout the cell (data not shown, but see below). To demonstrate that the increased rhod-2 fluorescence was in fact associated with mitochondria, the cells in this experiment were also labeled with the selective mitochondrial Ca2+ indicator MitoTracker Green (Fig. 5 B). Fig.5 C is the superposition of the two images in Aand B. The yellow color denotes areas where rhod-2 and MitoTracker Green coincide and demonstrates a nearly complete correspondence between the rhod-2 and MitoTracker labeling. The results confirm the conclusion of Rutter et al. (20.Rutter G.A. Burnett P. Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Tavare J.M. Denton R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5489-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) that rhod-2 preferentially labels mitochondria in CHO cells and further demonstrate that the mitochondria accumulate Ca2+ under low [Na+]o conditions in the transfected cells. No mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation was detected when the low [Na+]o medium was applied to vector-transfected CHO cells, which do not exhibit Na+/Ca2+exchange activity (data not shown). For Fig. 6, the standard two-pulse protocol was applied to rhod-2-labeled cells, and fluorescence was monitored in mitochondrion-rich areas of the cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). Rhod-2 fluorescence increased ∼5-fold when [Na+]o was reduced to 20 mm in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+o. Restoration of 140 mm Na+o evoked a fall in fluorescence intensity back to initial levels. The changes in rhod-2 fluorescence were much slower than the corresponding changes in the fura-2 signal (compare with Fig. 1), indicating that the rhod-2 measurements did not simply reflect changes in [Ca2+]i. The slow decline in rhod-2 fluorescence upon restoration of 140 mm Na+ is consistent with the relatively slow rate of Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria (19.Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Upon re-exposure to 20 mmNa+o, rhod-2 fluorescence did not increase, consistent with a reduced Ca2+ influx during the test pulse. When Ca2+ influx was stimulated with ionomycin (2 μm) during the test pulse, there was a sharp increase in mitochondrial rhod-2 fluorescence (data not shown), indicating that the mitochondria were still responsive to an increase in [Ca2+]i. From these results, taken together with the Ba2+ influx measurements (Fig. 4), we conclude that the reduced rise in [Ca2+]i during the test interval was due to an inhibition of Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity and could not be attributed to an increase in organellar Ca2+ sequestration. The results presented below indicate that the accumulation of Ca2+ by mitochondria during the conditioning pulse is an essential factor in mediating the subsequent inhibition of exchange activity during the test pulse. Fig.7 A shows that the inhibition of Ca2+ influx during the test pulse was eliminated when the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP; 2 μm) and the F0F1-ATPase inhibitor oligomycin (3.2 μm) were both present during the two-pulse protocol. (Oligomycin was added to reduce ATP hydrolysis by the F0F1-ATPase; similar results were obtained in the presence of uncoupler alone.) In the presence of CCCP (Fig.7 A, C/O trace), the peak ratio during the conditioning pulse was similar to that for untreated controls, but the subsequent decline in [Ca2+]i following the peak of the conditioning pulse was eliminated. Following addition of 140 mm Na+o, [Ca2+]ifell to values that were somewhat higher than for untreated controls, perhaps reflecting the loss of mitochondrial Ca2+-sequestering activity. The peak increase in the fura-2 ratio during the test interval was 110 ± 9% of that during the conditioning interval for the cells treated with CCCP/oligomycin and was much greater than that for the untreated cells. Essentially identical results were obtained when the K+ ionophore valinomycin (5 μm) was used in place of CCCP to depolarize the mitochondrial membrane potential (data not shown). The absence of exchange inhibition in the presence of the uncouplers was not due to a reduction in mitochondrially produced ATP since the normal inhibition of Ca2+ influx during the test pulse was not affected by oligomycin alone (data not shown). The data in Fig. 7 B show a similar experiment carried out in the presence of CCCP/oligomycin, but in this case, 2 mmBa2+ was substituted for Ca2+ during the test interval (arrow). In contrast to the results for untreated cells shown previously (Fig. 4), a robust influx of Ba2+was observed in the inhibitor-treated cells. The data in Fig.7 C (C/O trace) depict rhod-2 fluorescence in the presence of CCCP and oligomycin. The initial value of rhod-2 fluorescence appeared to be higher than that for the untreated cells, but this difference was not significant (p > 0.2) and reflected the large variations among different coverslips in cellular rhod-2 fluorescence. Presumably, this variability primarily reflects differences in the extent of dye loading among different coverslips. As expected, the inhibitors completely blocked mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation during the conditioning pulse. Oligomycin alone did not block mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation (data not shown). These data confirm that the rhod-2 fluorescence measurements reflect mitochondrial rather than cytosolic [Ca2+] since the rise in [Ca2+]iwas unaffected by CCCP. The control traces represent rhod-2 fluorescence for cells from the same batch of coverslips in the absence of inhibitors (n = 4). The mitochondrial Ca2+ content is regulated by the balance between Ca2+ uptake and efflux mechanisms. Previous results with permeabilized CHO cells demonstrated that the mitochondria in these cells possess a Na+/Ca2+ exchange mechanism for Ca2+ efflux (18.Condrescu M. Opuni K. Reeves J.P. Biophys. J. 1999; 76 (abstr.): A253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is different from the plasma membrane exchanger and is inhibited by agents such as diltiazem, clonazapam, and CGP-37157 that do not affect the plasma membrane exchanger (21.Cox D.A. Matlib M.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 408-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22.Cox D.A. Conforti L. Sperelakis N. Matlib M.A. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993; 21: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). When the two-pulse protocol was carried out in the presence of diltiazem (100 μm), we observed a more pronounced inhibition of Ca2+ influx during the test pulse than for control cells (Fig.8 A). Diltiazem had no significant effect on Ca2+ influx during the conditioning pulse. Changes in fluorescence of rhod-2-labeled cells in the presence of diltiazem are shown in Fig. 8 B. Both the initial level and the peak values of rhod-2 fluorescence during the conditioning interval were higher for diltiazem-treated cells than for control cells (p = 0.05 and 0.005, respectively). Whether this reflects coverslip variability or a true increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ content with diltiazem is difficult to assess with certainty. More important, the results clearly demonstrate that the efflux of Ca2+ from mitochondria was reduced when 140 mm Na+ was restored in the presence of diltiazem compared with untreated controls. Mitochondrial [Ca2+] remained elevated in diltiazem-treated cells throughout the recovery period in 140 mmNa+o (Fig. 8), in contrast to untreated cells (Fig.8, Control trace; and Fig. 6), where mitochondrial [Ca2+] decreased to initial values. These results are consistent with inhibition of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger by diltiazem. We attempted to use the more selective mitochondrial exchange inhibitor CGP-37157 for these studies, but observed no effect either on [Ca2+]i during the two-pulse protocol or on mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake or efflux (data not shown). The lack of effect of CGP-37157 in these cells might be due to poor cellular permeability or intracellular binding. In permeabilized cells, we found that this compound was highly effective in blocking Na+-dependent mitochondrial Ca2+efflux (18.Condrescu M. Opuni K. Reeves J.P. Biophys. J. 1999; 76 (abstr.): A253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). An additional correlation between mitochondrial Ca2+accumulation and inhibition of exchange activity was provided, surprisingly, by nocodazole, an agent that depolymerizes microtubules. Fig. 9 A compares the results of the two-pulse protocol for control cells and for cells that had been pretreated with 17 μm nocodazole for 15–20 min prior to beginning the experiment; nocodazole was also included in the medium during the two-pulse protocol. Nocodazole had no effect on the peak [Ca2+]i and slightly reduced the post-peak decline in [Ca2+]i during the conditioning pulse. However, nocodazole practically eliminated the inhibition of Ca2+ influx during the test pulse; the peak [Ca2+]i during the test interval was 84 ± 6% of the conditioning peak. Fig. 9 B shows that the fluorescence intensity of rhod-2 did not increase when the cells were exposed to 20 mm Na+o. Since the rise in [Ca2+]i was only slightly affected (Fig.9 A), we conclude that the nocodazole treatment blocked the accumulation of Ca2+ by mitochondria during the conditioning interval. As a positive control for these data, we found that the addition of ionomycin to the nocodazole-treated cells during the conditioning interval produced the expected rise in rhod-2 fluorescence (data not shown). This indicates that the nocodazole treatment did not interfere with rhod-2 localization or its ability to respond to increased [Ca2+]. In summary, the results demonstrate that the inhibition of exchange activity during the test interval was dependent upon mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation during the conditioning interval. Agents that blocked mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation (CCCP, nocodazole) also blocked the inhibition of exchange activity, whereas an agent that blocked mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux (diltiazem) enhanced the inhibition of exchange activity. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, cytosolic Ca2+, protein phosphorylation, and the actin cytoskeleton have each been suggested as regulators of the cardiac Na+/Ca2+exchanger (see the Introduction). The evidence supporting their involvement stemmed from studies that either utilized subcellular preparations, i.e. excised membrane patches, or involved the addition of exogenous inhibitors or other agents. Thus far, there has been no clear demonstration that any of these processes are important regulators of exchange activity under physiological conditions. The experimental design in the present studies involved a simple two-pulse protocol for activating exchange activity and did not require the addition of exogenous agents or the experimental alteration of normal cytosolic concentrations of Na+ or Ca2+. Our results show that Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity in transfected CHO cells is regulated by a previously unsuspected process linked to mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation. These findings provide the first evidence for a distinct regulatory pathway that modulates Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity in intact cells. The central finding of these studies is that a conditioning interval of Ca2+ influx by Na+/Ca2+ exchange produced an inhibition of exchange activity during a subsequent test interval (Figs. 1 and 2). Ba2+ influx was also inhibited during the test interval (Fig. 4). Since Ba2+ is not efficiently transported by organellar or plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (17.Condrescu M. Chernaya G. Kalaria V. Reeves J.P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we concluded that the reduced rise in [Ca2+]i during the test interval reflected an inhibition of exchange activity itself rather than an increased sequestration or efflux of Ca2+. This conclusion is consistent with the absence of mitochondrial Ca2+accumulation during the test interval (Fig. 6). The inhibition of exchange activity was eliminated (or potentiated) by agents that prevented (or promoted) mitochondrial Ca2+accumulation. Thus, CCCP (Fig. 7) and nocodazole (Fig. 9) each blocked mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation during the conditioning interval and eliminated the inhibition of exchange activity during the test interval. On the other hand, diltiazem, a blocker of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (21.Cox D.A. Matlib M.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 408-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22.Cox D.A. Conforti L. Sperelakis N. Matlib M.A. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993; 21: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), inhibited mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux during the recovery interval and enhanced the inhibition of exchange activity during the test interval (Fig. 8). These data suggest that the increase in the mitochondrial Ca2+ content led to the development of an inhibitory signal that reduced Na+/Ca2+exchange activity. It seems unlikely that these effects were simply due to a reduction in [Na+]i resulting from the exposure to 20 mm Na+o during the conditioning pulse. We were unable to detect changes in [Na+]i during the two-pulse protocol in cells loaded with the Na+indicator sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate (data not shown). However, it is possible that this method is not sufficiently sensitive to detect small reductions in [Na+]i that could inhibit exchange activity. Reducing [Na+]o to 20 mm in the absence of Ca2+o did not reduce exchange activity during a subsequent test pulse (Fig. 3), indicating that Ca2+ entry was required to inhibit exchange activity. Finally, nocodazole, CCCP, and diltiazem would not be expected to alter [Na+]i in ways that would be compatible with the results obtained. Thus, a trivial explanation in terms of reduced [Na+]i seems unlikely, although we cannot rule out a more complex mechanism in which alterations in [Na+]i are somehow linked to mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation. The nature of the inhibitory signal generated during mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation is unknown. Since an increase in Ca2+ within the mitochondrial matrix activates several different dehydrogenases (19.Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 23.Hansford R.G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1991; 23: 823-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), it is possible that increased production of an end product of mitochondrial respiration provides a signal for inhibiting exchange activity. However, the mitochondrial production of ATP seems unimportant since oligomycin, an inhibitor of the F0F1-ATPase, did not block inhibition of exchange activity. Mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (24.Chakraborti T. Das S. Mondal M. Roychoudhury S. Chakraborti S.

Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) has been invoked as regulatory effectors in some cells, and these possibilities deserve further investigation. The gradual development of exchange inhibition over a 1–5-min period (Fig. 2) suggests that time is required to generate the signal that inhibits exchange activity. This possibility is consistent with the time course of the changes in [Ca2+]i that occurred during the initial conditioning interval in low [Na+]o. When 20 mmNa+o was first applied to the cells, [Ca2+]i increased to a peak value and subsequently declined. During the following test interval, the maximal rise in [Ca2+]i was approximately equal to the final value attained during the declining phase of the conditioning interval (Figs. 1 and 2). In the presence of CCCP + oligomycin, the post-peak decline in [Ca2+]i during the conditioning interval was absent, suggesting that the decline reflected the developing inhibition of exchange activity. For diltiazem-treated cells, the decline in [Ca2+]i after the peak was similar to that for control cells (Fig. 8 B), indicating that exchange inhibition did not develop more rapidly, despite a possible increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ content. However, the inhibition of exchange activity during the test pulse was more pronounced than for the control cells (Fig. 8 A). We suggest that this reflects the continued development of the inhibition process due to the retention of high levels of mitochondrial Ca2+during the recovery period in diltiazem-treated cells (Fig.8 B). The results with nocodazole are complex and incompletely understood. The data suggest that microtubular structure exerts an important influence on mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are attached to microtubules and utilize these structures for intracellular movement (28.Bereiter-Hahn J. Voth M. Microsc. Res. Technol. 1994; 27: 198-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 29.Summerhayes I.C. Wong D. Chen L.B. J. Cell Sci. 1983; 61: 87-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Soltys B.J. Gupta R.S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 1174-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Following treatment with nocodazole, the mitochondria stained intensely with the potential-sensitive dye tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (data not shown), indicating that the reduced Ca2+accumulation was not a consequence of a reduced membrane potential. Perhaps microtubular disruption altered the location or the local environment of the mitochondria in a way that interfered with their ability to accumulate Ca2+ during the conditioning interval. This might reflect an alteration in the local [Ca2+]i in the vicinity of the mitochondria or a regulatory alteration in the activity of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake mechanism. This issue is currently under investigation. What are the physiological implications of the link between Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity and mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation? In cardiac myocytes, the mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration increases markedly with contractile frequency, particularly in the presence of β-adrenergic stimulation (31.Miyata H. Silverman H.S.

Res. 1993; 27: 1840-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). An associated inhibition of Na+/Ca2+exchange activity might therefore make a significant contribution to the positive force-frequency relationship observed in many species. Under pathological conditions, the mitochondrial exchanger interaction could in some circumstances form a deleterious positive feedback system that contributes to Ca2+ overload. Alternatively, in cells with elevated [Na+]i, Ca2+accumulation in the mitochondria might act to limit further Ca2+ entry by inhibiting the Ca2+ influx mode of the exchanger. These considerations are entirely speculative at present, and additional experimentation is clearly needed to assess the physiological importance of this novel regulatory pathway. We are grateful to Drs. Andrew P. Thomas and Lawrence Gaspers for the use of imaging instrumentation for the rhod-2 measurements and for helpful discussions and advice throughout the course of this work."

To determine the role of the conserved arginine and tryptophan residues on catalytic activity in the liver isoform of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (L-CPTI), we separately mutated five conserved arginines and two tryptophans to alanine. Substitution of arginine residues 388, 451, and 606 with alanine resulted in loss of 88, 82, and 93% of L-CPTI activity, respectively. Mutants R601A and R655A showed less than 2% of the wild type L-CPTI activity. A change of tryptophan 391 and 452 to alanine resulted in 50 and 93% loss in carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity, respectively. The mutations caused decreases in catalytic efficiency of 80–98%. The residual activity in the mutant L-CPTIs was sensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition. Mutants R388A, R451A, R606A, W391A, and W452A had no effect on the K m values for carnitine or palmitoyl-CoA. However, these mutations decreased the V maxvalues for both substrates by 10–40-fold, suggesting that the main effect of the mutations was to decrease the stability of the enzyme-substrate complex. We suggest that conserved arginine and tryptophan residues in L-CPTI contribute to the stabilization of the enzyme-substrate complex by charge neutralization and hydrophobic interactions. The predicted secondary structure of the 100-amino acid residue region of L-CPTI, containing arginines 388 and 451 and tryptophans 391 and 452, consists of four α-helices similar to the known three-dimensional structure of the acyl-CoA-binding protein. We predict that this 100-amino acid residue region constitutes the putative palmitoyl-CoA-binding site in L-CPTI.

As an enzyme that catalyzes the first rate-limiting step in β-oxidation, CPTI is tightly regulated by its physiological inhibitor, malonyl-CoA, the first intermediate in fatty acid synthesis, suggesting coordinated control of fatty acid oxidation and synthesis (1.Bieber L.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 261-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 2.McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Because of its central role in fatty acid metabolism, a good understanding of the molecular mechanism of the regulation of the CPT system is an important first step in the development of treatments for diseases, such as myocardial ischemia and diabetes, and in human inherited CPT deficiency diseases (10.Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 11.Corr P.B. Yamada K.A. Herz. 1995; 20: 156-168PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Bennefont J.P. Taroni F. Cavadini P.

We developed a novel high level expression system for human heart M-CPTI, rat L-CPTI, and CPTII in the yeast Pichia pastoris, an organism devoid of endogenous CPT activity (6.Zhu H.

Furthermore, by using this system, we have shown that CPTI and CPTII are active distinct enzymes and that L-CPTI and M-CPTI are distinct malonyl-CoA-sensitive CPTIs that are reversibly inactivated by detergents. More recent site-directed mutagenesis studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that glutamic acid 3 and histidine 5 in L-CPTI are necessary for malonyl-CoA inhibition and high affinity binding but not for catalysis (16.Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17.Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For M-CPTI, our deletion and substitution mutation analyses to date indicate that, in addition to Glu-3 and His-5, other specific residues within the 19–28 N-terminal amino acids are necessary for malonyl-CoA inhibition and high affinity binding, in agreement with the differences in malonyl-CoA sensitivity observed between M-CPTI and L-CPTI (18.Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this work, site-directed mutagenesis studies of conserved residues in the predicted C-terminal catalytic domain of L-CPTI demonstrate for the first time that conserved arginine and tryptophan residues are important for catalysis. Mutants of L-CPTI were constructed using the “Quick Change” polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis procedure (Stratagene) with the pYGW11 (pGAP-L-CPTI) plasmid DNA as template. For example, to construct R388A, the forward primer R388AF, 5′-CCCTCACTGCTGCAGACGCGGTGCCCTGGGCAA-3′, and the reverse primer R388AR, 5′-TTGCCCAGGGCACCGCGTCTGCAGCAGTGAGGG-3′, were used for mutagenesis. Mutants R451A, R601A, R606A, R655A, W391A, and W452A were constructed as above but with the following pairs of primers: R451AF, 5′-GGAAGATGCTTTGACGCGTGGTTTGACAAGTCC-3′; R451AR, 5′-GGACTTGTCAAACCACGCGTCAAAGCATCTTCC-3′; R601AF, 5′-GGCTCTTCCGAGAAGGGGCGACAGAGACTGTACG-3′; R601AR, 5′-CGTACAGTCTCTGTCGCCCCTTCTCGGAAGAGCC-3′; R606AF, 5′-GGACAGAGACTGTAGCGTCCTGCACTATGGAGTCC-3′; R606AR, 5′-GGACTCCATAGTGCAGGACGCTACAGTCTCTGTCC-3′; R655AF, 5′-CGCCGGCATCGACGCCCATCTCTTCTGCC-3′; R655AR, 5′-GGCAGAAGAGATGGGCGTCGATGCCGGCG-3′; W391AF, 5′-GCAGACAGAGTGCCCGCGGCAAAGTGTCG-3′; W391AR, 5′-CGACACTTTGCCGCGGGCACTCTGTCTGC-3′; W452AF, 5′-GGAAGATGCTTTGACAGGGCGTTTGACAAGTCC-3′; and W452AR, 5′-GGACTTGTCAAACGCCCTGTCAAAGCATCTTCC-3′. Bacterial colonies obtained upon transformation of the mutagenesis reactions were screened for the ability to productively serve as templates for polymerase chain reaction using forward primers with 3′ ends specific to each of the above mutations. For example, the R388A mutant was screened for with the R388ACKR: 5′-TTGCCCAGGGCACCGC-3′ primer. The mutation-specific 3′ bases are indicated in bold. The DNA sequences of positive colonies were then confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression plasmids were linearized and integrated into the HIS4 locus of P. pastoris GS115 by electroporation (17.Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Histidine prototrophic transformants were selected on YND plates and grown on YND medium. Mitochondria were isolated by disrupting the yeast cells with glass beads as described previously (13.de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5285-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). CPT activity was assayed by the forward exchange method using l-[3H]carnitine (13.de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Waterham H.R.

TheK m value for palmitoyl-CoA was determined by varying the palmitoyl-CoA concentration at a fixed molar ratio (6.1:1) of palmitoyl-CoA to albumin as described previously (17.Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Mitochondria (200 μg) from the yeast strains expressing L-CPTI, CPTII, and M-CPTI were incubated with 10 mm phenylglyoxal in disruption buffer (pH 6.0) at 25 °C for 30 min as described by Shanmugasundaran et al.(20.Shanmugasundaram T.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For the NBS treatment, 200 μg of mitochondria were incubated with 0.4 mm NBS on ice for 30 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 7.5% gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were developed by incubation with the L-CPTI-specific antibodies as described previously (17.Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Sources of other materials and procedures were as described in our previous publication (17.Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Preincubation of isolated mitochondria from the yeast strains expressing the CPTs at room temperature with 10 mmphenylglyoxal, an arginine-specific modifying reagent, resulted in an irreversible loss of 70% of both CPTI and CPTII activity. The inactivation was concentration- and time-dependent. These chemical modification studies with phenylglyoxal provided evidence that conserved arginine residue(s) is important for maximal CPT activity. Similarly, treatment of isolated mitochondria from the yeast strains expressing L-CPTI and CPTII with N-bromosuccinimide, a tryptophan-specific reagent, resulted in loss of 50 and 59% of L-CPTI and CPTII activity, respectively, indicating that conserved tryptophan residue(s) may be very important for L-CPTI activity. Alignment of the sequences of all carnitine and choline transferases from different species showed the presence of five conserved arginine and three conserved tryptophan residues (Fig.1). For L-CPTI, these are arginine residues 388, 451, 601, 606, and 655 and tryptophan residues 236, 391, and 452. To determine the role of these conserved arginine and tryptophan residues in L-CPTI on catalytic activity, they were each separately mutated to alanine (R388A, R451A, R601A, R606A, R655A, W391A, and W452A). Construction of plasmids carrying substitution mutations R388A, R451A, R601A, R606, R655A, W391A, and W452A was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. P. pastoris was chosen as an expression system for L-CPTI and the mutants, because it does not have endogenous CPT activity (6.Zhu H. Shi J. de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Arch.

For the wild type and all the conserved arginine substitution mutations R388A, R451A, R601A, R606A, and R655A (Fig. 2 A) and for the wild type and the tryptophan mutants W391A and W452A (Fig. 2 B), proteins of predicted sizes were synthesized with similar steady-state levels of expression. Substitution mutants R388A, R451A, and R606A had activity 7.0–18.0% of the wild type L-CPTI activity that was malonyl-CoA-sensitive; the R606A mutant exhibited the lowest activity (Table I). Mutants R601A and R655A had less than 2% of the wild type L-CPTI activity and were less sensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition than the wild type. Replacement of Trp-391 and Trp-452 with alanine resulted in 50 and 93% loss of L-CPTI activity, respectively (Table I), but the residual activity was sensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition.Table ICPT activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity in yeast strains expressing wild-type and mutant L-CPTIStrainActivity nmol/mg · min (%)Malonyl-CoA Inhibition2 μm100 μmWild-type L-CPTI12.32 ± 0.361 (100)8.311.44R388A1.46 ± 0.030 (11.8)0.360R451A2.16 ± 0.100 (17.5)1.040R601A0.23 ± 0.030 (1.9)0.250.10R606A0.85 ± 0.070 (6.9)0.790.21R655A0.18 ± 0.070 (1.5)0.100.08W391A6.040 (49)1.530.21W452A0.850 (6.9)0.170Mitochondria (150 μg of protein) from the yeast strains expressing wild-type L-CPTI, arginine, and tryptophan substitution mutations were assayed for CPT activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are the means ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments with different mitochondrial preparations.

Numbers in parentheses represent percent of CPT activity in the mutants compared to the wild type (100%). Mutants R388A, R451A, and R606A exhibited normal saturation kinetics when the carnitine concentration was varied relative to a constant second substrate, palmitoyl-CoA (Fig.3 A), a property identical to that of the wild type L-CPTI. For the R388A, R451A, and R606A mutants, the calculated K m values for carnitine were similar to the wild type value as shown in TableII, and the V maxvalues were only 6–13% of the wild type value (Table II), indicating a major effect of the mutations on catalytic activity. The catalytic efficiency as estimated byV max/K m for R388A, R451A, and R606A was decreased by 91, 89, and 95%, respectively. Due to the extremely low residual activity in mutants R601A and R655A, it was not possible to perform saturation kinetics and determine theK m or the V max values for carnitine or palmitoyl-CoA. With respect to the second substrate, palmitoyl-CoA, mutants R388A, R451A, and R606A exhibited normal saturation kinetics similar to the wild type (Fig. 3 B) when the molar ratio of palmitoyl-CoA:albumin was fixed at 6.1:1. The calculated K m value for palmitoyl-CoA for mutants R388A and R451A was about 50% lower than the wild type, whereas for mutant R606A, it was 90% lower than the wild type (Table II). TheV max values for mutants R388A, R451A, and R606A were 2–8% of the wild type values (Table II), and the catalytic efficiency was decreased by 90, 83, and 74%, respectively. Thus, substitution of the conserved arginine residues 388, 451, and 606 with alanine caused a substantial loss in catalytic activity but not in malonyl-CoA sensitivity. Substitution of arginines 601 and 655 with alanine resulted in nearly complete loss in CPTI activity, which was accompanied by loss in malonyl-CoA sensitivity.Table IIKinetic characteristics of yeast-expressed wild-type and mutant L-CPTIsStrainCarnitinePalmitoyl-CoAK mV maxK mV maxμmnmol/mg · minμmnmol/mg · minWild-type L-CPTI100.320.0043.0549.23R388A79.51.4322.902.52R451A121.32.6420.703.99R606A114.11.203.741.13W391A235.810.3829.5314.99W452A419.41.8011.581.23Isolated mitochondria (150 μg of protein) from the yeast strains expressing the wild type, arginine, and tryptophan substitution mutations were assayed for CPT activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of carnitine or palmitoyl-CoA. Values are averages of two independent experiments with different mitochondrial preparations. Open table in a new tab Isolated mitochondria (150 μg of protein) from the yeast strains expressing the wild type, arginine, and tryptophan substitution mutations were assayed for CPT activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of carnitine or palmitoyl-CoA. Values are averages of two independent experiments with different mitochondrial preparations. With respect to carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA, substitution mutants W391A and W452A exhibited normal saturation kinetics similar to the wild type (Fig. 4, A and B). Mutants W391A and W452A caused a 2–4-fold increase in theK m for carnitine, respectively, but decreased theK m value for palmitoyl-CoA (Table II). However, both mutations resulted in significant loss in theV max for carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA (Table II). For mutants W391A and W452A, the catalytic efficiency decreased by 80 and 98%, respectively, when the carnitine concentration was varied, and 55 and 90%, respectively, when the palmitoyl-CoA concentrations were varied relative to a second substrate. The site-directed mutagenesis study described here is aimed at elucidating the function of several strictly conserved basic and aromatic amino acid residues found at the proximity of the active site of L-CPTI. Earlier chemical modification studies with CoA-metabolizing enzymes suggested that adjacent arginine and tryptophan residues located at the active site might be involved in CoA binding (20.Shanmugasundaram T. Kumar G.K. Shenoy B.C. Wood H.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7112-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 21.Shanmugasundaram T. Kumar G.K. Wood H.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Studies with other enzyme systems using the arginine-specific reagent, phenylglyoxal, and the tryptophan-specific reagent, NBS, have shown that the negatively charged pyrophosphate group and the adenine moiety of CoA bind to adjacent positively charged arginine and hydrophobic (aromatic) tryptophan residues of the enzymes, respectively (20.Shanmugasundaram T. Kumar G.K. Shenoy B.C. Wood H.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7112-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 21.Shanmugasundaram T. Kumar G.K. Wood H.G.

We found that chemical modification of isolated mitochondria from the yeast strain expressing L-CPTI by phenylglyoxal and NBS resulted in loss of catalytic activity. Five arginine and three tryptophan residues are fully conserved throughout the family of acyltransferases with known primary sequences. In this study, we separately changed each of the five conserved arginine and two of the conserved tryptophan residues to alanine and determined the CPTI activity of the mutant proteins. Arginine residues 388, 451, and 606, and tryptophan residues 391 and 452, when changed to alanine, resulted in mutant proteins that had considerably reduced L-CPTI activity that was malonyl-CoA-sensitive. Substitution mutation of arginine residues 601 and 655 with alanine resulted in mutant proteins that had little or no detectable L-CPTI activity. Despite the differences in enzyme activity observed between the mutants and the wild type, the immunoblots with L-CPTI-specific antibodies revealed that all the mutants were expressed at similar steady-state levels as the wild type. The reaction catalyzed by L-CPTI at the catalytic pocket, conversion of palmitoyl-CoA to palmitoylcarnitine in the presence ofl-carnitine, has been hypothesized to involve deprotonation of the hydroxyl group of carnitine by a catalytic base (α-proton abstraction by His, Glu, or Gln) and attack by the resultant oxyanion at the carbonyl of the thioester of palmitoyl-CoA to generate palmitoylcarnitine and free CoA (25.Day P.J. Shaw W.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5122-5127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the CPT system has two substrates (palmitoyl-CoA and carnitine) with different physical properties, the active site pocket of the enzymes is predicted to contain separate or only partially overlapping binding pockets. Thus, a mutation that affects only the K m for one of the substrates might be predicted. No such mutation was found in this study. In fact, no change in K m of more than ∼10-fold was observed for any of the mutant L-CPTIs in this study. Mutants R388A, R451A, R606A, W391A, and W452A had little effect on theK m values for carnitine or palmitoyl-CoA but caused a considerable decrease in the V max for both substrates, suggesting that the main effect of the mutations was to decrease the stability of the enzyme-substrate complex. However, it is also possible that the mutations could lead to misfolding in 90% of the molecules, producing a lower K cat and unchanged K m values. Since the mutations had minimal effect on the K m, such a lack ofK m alteration would suggest that separate substitution of the arginine and tryptophan residues is not sufficient to alter carnitine or palmitoyl-CoA binding. However, since these mutations decreased the V max by 10–40-fold, the substantial decrease in V max could be related to the alteration of intrinsic L-CPTI stability. In CPTII, a single nucleotide missense mutation of the conserved Arg-503 to cysteine, which corresponds to the conserved Arg-606 in CPTI, is the cause for CPTII deficiency disease in humans (26.Taggart R.T. Smail D. Apolito C. Vladutin G.D. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 13: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the R601A and R655A mutants were devoid of detectable activity. Thus, the presence of these conserved arginine residues is probably crucial for maintaining the configuration of the L-CPTI active site. Substitution mutation of the highly conserved Arg-505 to asparagine in bovine liver carnitine octanoyltransferase, corresponding to the conserved Arg-655 in CPTI, was found to increase the K m for carnitine by more than 1650-fold (27.Cronin C.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Based on the R505N mutation in carnitine octanoyltransferase, it was suggested that this conserved arginine residue in carnitine octanoyltransferase and other acytransferases contributes to substrate binding by forming a salt bridge with the carboxylate moiety of carnitine (27.Cronin C.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mutant L-CPTI with a change of Arg-655 to Ala had insufficient activity to allow measurement of its K mvalue for carnitine. We suggest that conserved arginine and tryptophan residues in L-CPTI contribute to the stabilization of the transition state by charge neutralization and hydrophobic interactions, respectively. Alignment of residues 381–481 of L-CPTI that contain Arg-388, Arg-451, Trp-391, and Trp-452 with a protein of known three-dimensional structure in the GenBankTM by the Swiss model software resulted in a known secondary structure of the acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP), a protein with 86 amino acid residues, being the best fit for the predicted secondary structure of the 100 C-terminal amino acids that constitute the putative palmitoyl-CoA binding region of L-CPTI (28.Kraelund B.B. Poulsen K. Andersen K.V. Baldursson T. Kroll J.B. Neergard T.B. Jepsen J. Roepstorff P. Kristiansen K. Poulsen M.F. Knudsen J.

Biol. 1999; 6: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). ACBP and the 100-amino acid fragment of L-CPTI showed 32% similarity. The three-dimensional structure of the acyl-CoA-binding protein with bound palmitoyl-CoA consists of a skewed four α-helix bundle (30.Kraelund B.B. Andersen K.V. Madsen J.C. Knudsen J. Poulsen F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1260-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The predicted secondary structure for the putative 100-amino acid residue palmitoyl-CoA binding region consists of four α-helices. Both ACBP and CPTI bind palmitoyl-CoA. ACBP binds long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs with high affinity, and the acyl-CoA·ACBP complex has been suggested to play a role in acyl-CoA-mediated cell signaling by interaction with, or donation of, long-chain acyl-CoA to CPTI and other proteins (31.Knudsen J. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 294-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Palmitoyl-CoA is a substrate for L-CPTI. We suggest that this 100-amino acid residue region constitutes the putative palmitoyl-CoA-binding site of L-CPTI. The ACBP three-dimensional structure is a shallow bowl with a rim characterized by many polar and charged groups, whereas the inside and outside surfaces are predominantly hydrophobic with patches of uncharged hydroxyl groups (28.Kraelund B.B. Poulsen K. Andersen K.V. Baldursson T. Kroll J.B. Neergard T.B. Jepsen J. Roepstorff P. Kristiansen K. Poulsen M.F. Knudsen J.

Biol. 1993; 230: 1260-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is predicted that the specificity of the ligand binding resides at the omega end of the acyl chain, together with strong electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with the adenine 3′-phosphate of the CoA (28.Kraelund B.B. Poulsen K. Andersen K.V. Baldursson T. Kroll J.B. Neergard T.B. Jepsen J. Roepstorff P. Kristiansen K. Poulsen M.F. Knudsen J.

Biol. 1993; 230: 1260-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The phosphate and hydroxyl groups of the ribose are involved in an intense network of electrostatic and polar interactions with the polar parts of the side chains of hydrophobic and positively charged hydrophilic residues (28.Kraelund B.B. Poulsen K. Andersen K.V. Baldursson T. Kroll J.B. Neergard T.B. Jepsen J. Roepstorff P. Kristiansen K. Poulsen M.F. Knudsen J.

In a separate study, it was demonstrated that the adenine ring of a CoA moiety interacts with the tryptophan residue of an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of acetyl-CoA, and furthermore, arginine residues electrostatically interact with the pyrophosphate moiety of CoA (20.Shanmugasundaram T. Kumar G.K. Shenoy B.C. Wood H.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7112-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 21.Shanmugasundaram T. Kumar G.K. Wood H.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the functional importance of conserved arginine and tryptophan residues in L-CPTI on catalytic activity by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations of conserved arginine and tryptophan residues affected catalytic activity, indicating the importance of electrostatic and hydrophobic contacts for the interaction of L-CPTI with the substrates. Electrostatic interactions are generally thought to play a role in the initial steps of ligand binding by guiding the productive collision of ligand and receptor. Chemical modification of mitochondria from yeast strains expressing CPTII by the histidine-specific reagent, diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC), and site-directed mutagenesis have identified the conserved His-372 residue to be essential for catalytic activity (8.Brown N.F. Anderson R.C. Caplan S.L. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19157-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2J. Shi and G. Woldegiorgis, unpublished data. However, chemical modification of mitochondria from yeast strains expressing L-CPTI and M-CPTI by DEPC had no effect on catalytic activity,2 suggesting that the same conserved histidine residue in L-CPTI and M-CPTI is either not important for catalysis or may be important but inaccessible for DEPC modification. Substitution mutation of arginine residues 601 and 655 with alanine resulted in mutant proteins that had little or no detectable L-CPTI activity. Thus, the presence of both of these conserved arginine residues is probably important for maintaining the configuration of the active site of L-CPTI. The region of CPTI between amino acid residues 550 and 619 has 11 additional highly conserved residues and may contain critical residues necessary for catalysis, such as Gln-571, Gln-575, and Glu-590, which may act as a catalytic base for the deprotonation of the hydroxyl group of carnitine."

Modification of actin subdomain 2 alters troponin-tropomyosin-mediated regulation, suggesting that this region of actin may contain important protein-protein interaction sites. We used yeast actin mutant D56A/E57A to examine this issue. The mutation increased the affinity of tropomyosin for actin 3-fold. The addition of Ca2+ to mutant actin filaments containing troponin-tropomyosin produced little increase in the thin filament-myosin S1 MgATPase rate. Despite this, three-dimensional reconstruction of electron microscope images of filaments in the presence of troponin and Ca2+ showed tropomyosin to be in a position similar to that found for muscle actin filaments, where most of the myosin binding site is exposed. Troponin-tropomyosin bound with comparable affinity to mutant and wild type actin in the absence and presence of calcium, and in the presence of myosin S1, tropomyosin bound very tightly to both types of actin. The mutation decreased actin-myosin S1 affinity 13-fold in the presence of troponin-tropomyosin and 2.6-fold in the absence of the regulatory proteins. The results suggest the importance of negatively charged actin subdomain 2 residues 56 and 57 for myosin binding to actin, for tropomyosin-actin interactions, and for regulatory conformational changes in the actin-troponin-tropomyosin complex.

P 1,P 5-di(adenosine 5′)-pentaphosphate 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid Cardiac and skeletal muscle contraction is controlled by a complex allosteric system in which myosin-actin interactions are regulated by tropomyosin and troponin. Tropomyosin is an extended, dimeric coiled-coil and spans seven actin monomers on the thin filament. Troponin is composed of three subunits: troponin T connects the other two subunits and tropomyosin to the actin filament, troponin I inhibits myosin binding to actin, and troponin C serves as a Ca2+sensor for the system (for reviews see Refs. 1.Tobacman L.S.

Structural studies have shown that tropomyosin can bind to three different regions of the actin filament (3.Lehman W. Craig R. Vibert P.

In the absence of Ca2+, tropomyosin appears to bind to subdomain 1 of actin and to bridge over subdomain 2 to the next actin monomer (4.Lehman W. Vibert P. Uman P. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In the presence of Ca2+, tropomyosin moves toward subdomains 3 and 4 (3.Lehman W. Craig R. Vibert P.

Whereas these and other results support a three state model of muscle regulation involving tropomyosin movement (9.Geeves M.A. Lehrer S.S. Biophys.

One strategy to examine muscle protein-protein interactions has been to exploit functionally altered mutants (13.Fyrberg E. Fyrberg C.C. Beall C. Saville D.L. J. Mol.

For example, aDrosophila melanogaster actin subdomain 2 mutant, E93K, which inhibits tropomyosin-actin sliding in isolated protein preparations, has been utilized to investigate tropomyosin-based regulation (16.Bing W.

Recently, we have shown that Saccharomyces cerevisiae actin can serve as a model system for examining troponin-tropomyosin-mediated regulation (21.Korman V.L. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22191-22196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This system is advantageous, because actin mutants are available in greater quantity than from Drosophila. A number of actin surface residue mutations can be used to examine sites that interact with the regulatory proteins to influence thin filament conformation. In the present study, yeast actin subdomain 2 mutant D56A/E57A (22.Wertman K.F. Drubin D.G. Botstein D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 337-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to assess the interactions of these residues with tropomyosin and troponin. Substitution of alanine for charged amino acids at these positions increased tropomyosin affinity for actin 3-fold, supporting the view that ionic forces influence tropomyosin-actin interaction (6.Lorenz M. Poole K.J.V. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar,23.Dahiya R. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol.

Regulated thin filaments containing troponin, tropomyosin, and D56A/E57A actin did not exhibit Ca2+-mediated activation of myosin S1 ATPase rates and had decreased affinity for myosin S1. Electron microscopy and three-dimensional image reconstruction indicated that, despite these inhibitory properties of regulated mutant actin filaments, the Ca2+-induced shift in tropomyosin position on actin was normal and not different from that found for regulated muscle actin filaments. The results suggest that charged residues on subdomain 2 of actin are important for myosin binding, regulatory protein binding, and thin filament regulation. They also suggest the importance of the strength of myosin binding for thin filament activation. Bovine cardiac troponin and tropomyosin were extracted from ether powder using the procedure of Tobacman and Lee (26.Tobacman L.S. Lee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4059-4064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myosin S1 was purified from rabbit fast skeletal muscle following the method described by Weeds and Taylor (27.Weeds A.G.

Genetics. 1992; 132: 337-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was grown to stationary phase at 25 °C. The wild type actin was purified from commercial bakery cakes ofSaccharomyces carlsbergensis, which has an actin sequence identical to that in S. cerevisiae (29.Cook R.K. Blake W.T. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9430-9436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both actins were purified using DNase columns based on the method by Cooket al. (29.Cook R.K. Blake W.T. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9430-9436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ G-actin was converted to Mg2+ G-actin using the method of Strelezka-Golaszewska et al.

The Ca2+ or Mg2+ G-actin was then polymerized by adding 3 mm MgCl2. In the case of the Ca2+ G-actin, polymerization by Mg2+ addition causes a heterogeneous population of Ca2+ or Mg2+ F-actin, here termed conventional F-actin. Similar to other actins in which the amino acid residues of subdomain 2 have been modified (17.Miki M. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19.Miki M. Hozumi T.

Polymerization was normal in the presence of 3 mm MgCl2 and low ionic strength, but it was necessary to add phalloidin to prevent depolymerization of the mutant filaments under the high salt conditions of the co-sedimentation binding assays (data not shown). Wild type actin was treated similarly. Bovine cardiac tropomyosin was labeled with [H3]iodoacetate at residues Cys190 (24.Cassell M. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol.

Samples were centrifuged at 35,000 rpm using a TLA100 rotor (Beckman) for 30 min at 25 °C after a 30-min incubation. Aliquots were taken before and after centrifugation to compare the total radioactivity in the starting reaction mixture with the remaining radioactivity in the supernatant. A linear lattice equation was used to analyze the data (31.Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16106-16113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). In this equation, K osymbolizes the affinity of one extended ligand (tropomyosin) for an isolated binding site on a linear lattice (actin), and y is a measure of cooperativity. Specifically, y is the ratio describing the probability for tropomyosin to bind adjacent to another bound tropomyosin, relative to the probability that it binds in an isolated position (32.McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). K app is approximately equal to the product of K o and y. Myosin S1 ATPase activity was determined using the procedure of Pollard and Korn (33.Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following conditions were used: 25 °C, 7 μmphalloidin-stabilized yeast F-actin, 1 μm rabbit fast skeletal muscle myosin S1, either 2 μm bovine cardiac tropomyosin or 1.2 μm tropomyosin plus 1.2 μm bovine cardiac troponin, 5 mm imidazole (pH 7.5), 3.5 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and either 0.5 mm EGTA or 0.2 mm CaCl2. A total of six data points were taken at 2-min intervals. The data were corrected for myosin S1 ATPase activity in the absence of actin. Strong myosin binding decreases the fluorescence intensity of actin that is labeled by pyrene at Cys374 (34.Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The affinity (K′, below) of myosin S1-ADP for pyrene-labeled muscle filaments was found by serial additions of myosin S1, with the data fit to a simple hyperbolic binding model. Under the tight binding conditions of the experiments, hyperbolic binding also approximated the behavior of regulated pyrene actin filaments (see Fig. 3 A and Table II). Data in the presence of very low S1 concentrations presumably show cooperativity but is not relevant to the competition experiments.Table IIThin filament-myosin S1 affinities for various actinsWild type yeast K app × 106D56A/E57A yeast K app × 106Rabbit fast skeletal K app × 106Pyrene-labeled skeletal K app × 106m −1m −1m −1m −1Actin1.45 ± 0.060.56 ± 0.0316.7 ± 0.13.4 ± 0.9Actin-tropomyosin-troponin0.4 ± 0.030.67 ± 0.0795 ± 1020 ± 6Actin-tropomyosin-troponin Ca2+7.3 ± 0.60.56 ± 0.0395 ± 1020 ± 6For pyrene-labeled skeletal muscle actin the affinities were measured by the sequential addition of myosin S1 to thin filaments labeled with pyrene-iodoacetamide on actin Cys374, causing progressive quenching of fluorescence intensity. All other affinities were determined by sequential addition of nonlabeled thin filaments, resulting in competitive displacement of myosin S1 from pyrene-labeled muscle actin and a progressive increase in fluorescence intensity. Conditions are described under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab For pyrene-labeled skeletal muscle actin the affinities were measured by the sequential addition of myosin S1 to thin filaments labeled with pyrene-iodoacetamide on actin Cys374, causing progressive quenching of fluorescence intensity. All other affinities were determined by sequential addition of nonlabeled thin filaments, resulting in competitive displacement of myosin S1 from pyrene-labeled muscle actin and a progressive increase in fluorescence intensity. Conditions are described under “Materials and Methods.” Modest yields of the yeast actins made it difficult to label sufficient quantities with pyrene for direct measurement of myosin S1 thin filament binding. Instead, a competition assay was used to measure myosin S1-ADP affinity for filaments containing wild type or mutant yeast actin. 0.8 μm myosin S1 was added to pyrene-labeled muscle actin or regulated actin filaments, and the fluorescence change was noted. Then, serial additions of an unlabeled competitor actin or thin filament were made to displace the myosin S1 from the labeled filaments. Data from duplicate titrations were corrected for dilution, averaged, and normalized. Saturating concentrations of myosin S1 quenched the fluorescence by 86%. The data were analyzed according to a simple competition model. Binding to the labeled actin is described by K′ =A′S/(A′ × S), and binding to the unlabeled actin is given by K =AS/(A × S). A is the free unlabeled actin, A′ is the free labeled actin,S is the free myosin S1, AS is the unlabeled actin-myosin S1 complex, and A′S is the labeled actin-myosin S1 complex. A′S is the physically relevant root of the following cubic expression inA′S, derived from conservation of mass relationships and the above expressions for K andK′, 0=[(Q×(ST−A′S)−A′S)×(Q+K×A′S)]−Q×K×AT×A′S, Q≡[(K′×AT′)−(K′×A′S)]Equation 1 where ST is the total myosin S1, andAT and A′T are the total unlabeled and labeled actins, respectively. Using Equation 1for A′S, the curvefitting program SCIENTIST was used to determine the value of K resulting in the best fit of the fluorescence data to the following equation, F=Fe−(A′S/AT′)×(Fe−Fs)Equation 2 where Fe is the fluorescence of the empty actin filament (i.e. with no myosin bound), andFs is the fluorescence of the actin filament with saturating myosin S1. The conditions of the myosin binding experiments were: 25 °C, 1 μm pyrene-labeled rabbit fast skeletal muscle actin (34.Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), 20 mm imidazole (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm ADP, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 μmAp5A,1 5 μmol/min hexokinase, 1 mm glucose, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.01% NaN3. Regulated thin filaments were prepared by adding 0.35 μm tropomyosin and 0.35 μm troponin, enough to ensure saturation of the actin. For experiments done in the presence of Ca2+, 0.6 mm CaCl2 was added. Using a SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer outfitted with a stirred water jacket sample holder, 1.8-ml samples were excited at 368 nm, and the emission intensity was monitored at 407 nm. Ca2+ G-actin was incubated in 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2 to convert it to the Mg2+ form (30.Strzelezka-Golaszewska H. Moraczewska J. Khaitlina S.Y. Mossakowska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and then polymerized by the addition of 3 mm MgCl2 and equimolar phalloidin. F-actin was then diluted in 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.0), 5 mm Pipes (pH 7.0), 1 mm NaN3, applied to thin carbon-coated electron micrograph grids, and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate (35.Moody C. Lehman W. Craig R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1990; 11: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Electron micrograph images were recorded at ×60,000 magnification under low dose conditions (∼12 e−/Å2) on a Philips CM120 electron microscope. Micrographs were digitized using either Imacon Flextight Precision II or Zeiss SCAI scanners at a pixel size corresponding to ∼7.0 Å in the filaments (36.Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Regions of filaments suitable for helical reconstruction were selected on the basis of filament straightness and lack of aggregation, uniformity of staining, and freedom from astigmatism. Slightly curved filaments were straightened by applying spline fitting algorithms (37.Egelman E.H. Ultramicroscopy. 1986; 19: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Helical reconstruction was carried out using standard methods (38.DeRosier D.J. Moore P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 52: 355-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 39.Amos L.A. Klug A. J. Mol.

Previous experiments (16.Bing W. Razzaq A. Sparrow J. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15016-15021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17.Miki M. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19.Miki M. Hozumi T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5625-5630Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) suggest that modification or mutation of actin subdomain 2 can alter interactions of actin with tropomyosin (16.Bing W. Razzaq A. Sparrow J. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15016-15021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To explore this quantitatively, we examined the binding of tropomyosin to yeast actin mutant D56A/E57A (Fig. 1). The structure of subdomain 2 may depend on whether Ca2+ or Mg2+ is bound in the actin binding cleft (30.Strzelezka-Golaszewska H. Moraczewska J. Khaitlina S.Y. Mossakowska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 41.Orlova A. Prochniewicz E. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), so we focused the study on tropomyosin binding to Mg2+ F-actin, containing the physiologically relevant metal. To produce Mg2+ F-actin, Ca2+ bound to wild type, and mutant G-actin was exchanged for Mg2+ prior to polymerization. Using this actin, there was a 3-fold increase in the affinity of tropomyosin for D56A/E57A actin (*) as compared with wild type F-actin (*) (K app = 4.9 ± 0.2 × 106m−1 versus K app = 1.62 ± 0.04 × 106m−1, Fig. 1 A).K app partially depends upon cooperative aspects of binding (see “Materials and Methods”). However, this increased affinity cannot be explained by greater tropomyosin-tropomyosin cooperativity in the presence of the mutation, because tropomyosin binding was less cooperative to mutant actin than to control actin (y = 35 ± 7 versus y = 134 ± 34). This strongly suggests that the mutation increased tropomyosin's actin affinity per se. When actin was polymerized without prior exchange of metals, the binding data were much more variable (Fig. 1 B, *, ■). This may reflect heterogeneity in F-actin structure due to the Ca2+/Mg2+ mixture (41.Orlova A. Prochniewicz E. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), but this was not assessed in the present work. Despite the variability in the data, the mutant actin again bound to tropomyosin more tightly. Another important condition to evaluate was the interaction of tropomyosin with actin filaments decorated with myosin heads. In the presence of myosin S1 tropomyosin binding to yeast or muscle actin was nearly stoichiometric and difficult to measure (21.Korman V.L. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22191-22196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24.Cassell M. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12867-12872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This was also true for D56A/E57A actin (Fig. 1 B, +) and was confirmed for control yeast actin (Δ). Because the affinity of tropomyosin was increased for D56A/E57A F-actin, we examined whether the affinity of the troponin-tropomyosin complex was also altered for the mutant. In the absence of Ca2+ (Fig.2 A) the regulatory complex bound equally tightly to both the wild type (▵) and mutant (+) F-actins (K app = 8.1 ± 0.2 × 106m−1 andK app = 8.1 ± 0.4 × 106m−1, respectively). Because the binding of the tropomyosin-troponin complex is tight, it was possible that a change in the affinity of the complex for the mutant actin might not be apparent. Therefore, the KCl concentration was increased from 300 to 400 mm to weaken binding. This achieved the desired effect on affinity, but for unknown reasons it also produced much more scatter in the data (lower two curves in Fig. 2 A). With this limitation, the affinities of the regulatory complex for mutant (*) and wild type (▪) F-actins were not distinguishable (3.2 ± 0.2 and 3.5 ± 0.3 × 106m−1, respectively). Ca2+ binding to troponin decreased by about 50% the affinity of the regulatory proteins for both wild type and mutant actins in the presence of 300 mm KCl. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the affinity was slightly weaker for D56A/E57A F-actin (*, K app = 3.5 ± 0.3 × 106m−1) than for wild type F-actin (■, K app 4.84 ± 0.09 × 106m−1). This is only a 1.4-fold effect, and its significance is not clear. Because D56A/E57A F-actin bound to the regulatory proteins with nearly normal affinity in both the presence and absence of Ca2+, one might predict that regulated thin filaments composed of the mutant actin would undergo Ca2+-dependent regulation of myosin S1 MgATPase activity. Table I shows the results of experiments to test this. Both Mg2+ F-actin and conventionally polymerized actin were examined. The myosin S1-unregulated actin MgATPase rates were decreased by 65–80% as a result of the mutation. The actin mutation decreased the myosin S1 MgATPase rate for actin-tropomyosin moderately, by 45%, but for the actin-tropomyosin-troponin in the presence of Ca2+ the mutation decreased the rate by 88–94%. Regulated thin filaments containing wild type actin showed a 3–5-fold increase in ATPase rates upon the addition of Ca2+. Notably, regulated thin filaments composed of the D56A/E57A F-actin failed to exhibit this activation, showing an increase upon Ca2+ addition of only 20%. In the absence of Ca2+, troponin-tropomyosin inhibited the actin-myosin S1 MgATPase rate for both wild type actin and mutant actin. The exchange of Ca2+ for Mg2+on G-actin prior to polymerization had no effect on these comparisons.Table IEffect of D56A/E57A actin mutation on actin-activated myosin S1 MgATPase ratesConventional F-ActinsMg2+ F-actinsWild type actin (10 × MgATPase rate)D56A/E57A actin (10 × MgATPase rate)Wild type actin (10 × MgATPase rate)D56A/E57A actin (10 × MgATPase rate)s −1s −1s −1s −1Actin4 ± 21.4 ± 0.36 ± 11.2 ± 0.5Actin-tropomyosin1.1 ± 0.10.6 ± 0.20.8 ± 0.30.5 ± 0.3Actin-tropomyosin-troponin1.1 ± 0.50.5 ± 0.21.86 ± 0.070.2 ± 0.02Actin-tropomyosin-troponin Ca2+5 ± 10.6 ± 0.25.4 ± 0.30.3 ± 0.06ATPase assay conditions were as described under “Materials and Methods.” Averages are from four or more independent experiments. Conventional F-actin was prepared by adding MgCl2 and KCl to Ca2+ G-actin. Mg2+ F-actin was prepared by exchanging Mg2+ for Ca2+ bound to G-actin, prior to polymerization. ATPase results did not significantly differ for conventional versus Mg2+ F-actins. Open table in a new tab ATPase assay conditions were as described under “Materials and Methods.” Averages are from four or more independent experiments. Conventional F-actin was prepared by adding MgCl2 and KCl to Ca2+ G-actin. Mg2+ F-actin was prepared by exchanging Mg2+ for Ca2+ bound to G-actin, prior to polymerization. ATPase results did not significantly differ for conventional versus Mg2+ F-actins. Actin-activated myosin S1 MgATPase rates were decreased for the mutant actin, suggesting that myosin S1 binding might be altered by the mutation. As previously shown (34.Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) myosin S1-ADP binding to pyrene-labeled actin produces a decrease in fluorescence intensity, from which the affinity constant for unregulated pyrene muscle actin under the current conditions was determined (○, Fig.3 A, and TableII). This measurement was combined with a competitive binding assay (Fig. 3, B and C) to determine the myosin S1 affinity for both yeast actins, as well as for unlabeled skeletal muscle actin, which was used as a control to allow comparison of unlabeled yeast and muscle actins. Similarly to results seen in the actin-activated myosin S1 MgATPase assays, the D56A/E57A mutation decreased the affinity of myosin S1 for actin ∼3-fold (TableII and triangles versus squares, Fig.3 B). In agreement with published comparisons (42.Miller C.J. Bobkova E. Botstein D. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3670-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), myosin S1-ADP had ∼10-fold lower affinity for wild type yeast actin than for unlabeled rabbit muscle actin (Fig. 3 B, squares versus circles). Also, the data show that pyrene labeling decreased the affinity of myosin S1-ADP for muscle actin approximately 5-fold, from 17 to 3.4 × 106m−1. Actin-myosin S1 binding was also examined in the presence of troponin-tropomyosin. Unlabeled rabbit muscle actin (Fig.3 C, circles) again showed a 5-fold increase in affinity (Table II) as compared with pyrene-labeled actin (Fig.3 A, filled circles). The fluorescence titrations for unlabeled muscle actin were similar in either the absence or presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3 C, open versus filled circles). Therefore curve fitting was performed on combined data from both conditions. In contrast, myosin S1 binding to wild type yeast actin-tropomyosin-troponin was much weaker in the absence than in the presence of Ca2+ (open versus filled squares). Furthermore, even in the presence of Ca2+, myosin S1 bound much more weakly to regulated thin filaments containing yeas"

To study the mechanism of this reaction in more detail, S. toxytricini was grown in medium containing a mixture of U-13C,U-2H-lipids and unlabeled sunflower oil or in a medium containing 70% D2O. Lipstatin was isolated and analyzed by 1H,2H, and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Hydrogen atoms at C-2, C-3, and C-4 of lipstatin were found to be derived from solvent protons. The formation of the lipstatin precursor 3-hydroxy-Δ5,8-tetradecadienoyl-CoA by β oxidation of linoleic acid explains the incorporation of solvent hydrogen into the 4 position of lipstatin. The hydrogen in position 3 of lipstatin is most probably introduced from solvent by proton/deuterium exchange of a redox cofactor involved in the reduction of the keto group in the branched chain β keto acid arising by a decarboxylative condensation. The incorporation of solvent hydrogen at position 2 can be explained by epimerization of a chiral intermediate at C-2 and C-3. Epimerization may involve a dehydration-rehydration mechanism."

We searched for factors capable of inducing lactotropic differentiation of GHFT cells. PRL gene expression was not observed in cells subjected to a variety of stimuli, which induce PRL gene expression in mature lactotropes. Only fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) was able to initiate the transcription, synthesis, and release of PRL in GHFT cells.

We also show that the FGF-2 response element is located in the proximal PRLpromoter. Stimulation of PRL expression by FGF-2 requires endogenous Ets factors and these factors as well as GHF-1 are expressed at low levels in the committed precursor, suggesting that these low levels are limiting for full PRL expression.

Using the 5′ GHF-1 regulatory region to target the immortalizing oncoprotein SV40 T-antigen in transgenic mice has immortalized this cell type. Mice expressing this transgene exhibit dramatic dwarfism and develop pituitary tumors, which express high levels of GHF-1 transcripts, low levels of GHF-1 protein, and no GH or PRL (10.Lew D.

GHFT cells continue to exhibit the same phenotype as the original tumor and were therefore proposed to represent immortalized somatotrope/lactotrope progenitor (10.Lew D. Brady H. Klausing K.

Thus, GHFT cells may constitute a convenient ex vivo system to study the mechanism of cell differentiation in an endocrine gland that itself is rather inaccessible to experimental manipulation during embryogenesis. The aim of this work was to identify factors that can induce the lactotropic differentiation of this committed precursor and explore their mechanism of action. Our efforts were focused on those agents that are known to stimulate PRL gene expression in differentiated lactotropes. Multiple hormones, growth factors, and oncogenes act in conjunction with GHF-1 to regulate pituitary-specific expression of the PRL gene.

Among the latter, the family of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) appears to play an important role in pituitary organogenesis (21.Treier M. Gleiberman A.S. O'Connell S.M. Szeto D.P. McMahon J.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1691-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), in differentiation of lactotropes (22.Porter T.E. Wiles C.D. Frawley S.

Particularly, FGF-2 (or bFGF), which was originally isolated from the pituitary gland (24.Bohlen P. Baird A. Esch F. Ling N. Gospodarowicz D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1993; 77: 831-837PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-2 was recently found to stimulate thePRL promoter in the lactotropic GH4 cell line, and the functional components of the signal transduction pathway activated by this growth factor have been determined (29.Schweppe R.E. Frazer-Abel A.A. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Bradford A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30852-30859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We report here that, among a variety of different agents tested, only FGF-2 was able to initiate the PRL gene transcription in GHFT cells. FGF-2 specifically stimulates PRL promoter activity in transient transfection assays in GHFT cells. The FGF-2 response element is located in the proximal promoter sequences, and Ets transcription factors are required for stimulation of thePRL promoter by FGF-2. GHFT cells express low levels of Ets factors, which could contribute to the reduced promoter responsiveness in these cells. In summary, our results indicate that FGF-2 is a strong up-regulator of PRL gene expression in somatolactotropic progenitors and that this factor is a strong candidate for a physiological inducer of lactotropic differentiation in vivoand probably also in maintaining the lactotropic phenotype of differentiated cells. GHFT cells were grown as described previously (10.Lew D. Brady H. Klausing K. Yaginuma K. Theill L.E. Stauber C. Karin M. Mellon P.L. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in a defined serum-free (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose) medium without phenol red, containing insulin (10 μg/ml), sodium selenite (50 nm), human transferrin (10 μg/ml), ascorbic acid (10 μg/ml), 0.1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V), sodium pyruvate, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were maintained at least overnight in this defined medium before the beginning of the experiments. GH4C1 and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. For the experiments, the cultures were shifted to medium containing 10% AG1X8 resin-charcoal-stripped newborn calf serum and 24 h later shifted to serum-free medium. Treatments were administered in serum-free medium. Total RNA was isolated from cells as described previously (30.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). One μg of total RNA was used in RT-PCR reaction. The reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA (using cloned murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase) and subsequent amplification (using GeneAmp® PCR process and AmpliTaq ® DNA polymerase) were performed all in a single reaction tube to avoid cross-contamination after first strand synthesis. RNA was copied to cDNA using random hexamers. To increase the specificity and sensitivity of PCR amplification, the “hot start” technique was used to suppress primer annealing to non-target sequences. AmpliWax™ PCR Gem 100 (Perkin-Elmer) was added to each single reaction tube containing a subset of amplification reagent for this proposal. For amplification of PRL cDNA, the specific primers 5′-CCCGAATACATCCTATCAAGAGCC-3′ and 5′-TTGATGGGCAATTTGGCACCTCAG-3′ were used. These primers amplified a fragment of 263 bp. As an internal control, the amplified cDNA fragment spanned two spliced exons, such that when genomic DNA was amplified the corresponding bands were larger due to the presence of an intron. PRL mRNA was detected by RPA. Total RNA from mouse pituitary was used as positive control. mRNA from GHFT and HeLa cells was isolated by Oligotex™ direct mRNA kit (Qiagen). The mouse PRL cDNA was inserted into pGEM2, and after XhoI linearization an antisense riboprobe was generated using SP6 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]UTP. The run-off transcription was allowed to proceed for 60 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by digesting the DNA template with 10 units/μl DNase I for 15 min at 37 °C. The probe was purified from a polyacrylamide gel, eluted with the RNAid™ kit (Bio 101), and hybridization was performed overnight at 50 °C. The hybridization solution contained 80% formamide, 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.4 m NaCl. After hybridization, samples were digested using RNase-ONE™ (Promega; 50 units/sample, 50 min at 30 °C), precipitated with ethanol, and separated on a 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel. Autoradiography of the RPA showed a double protected fragment of 280 bp. Identical amounts of poly(A)+ RNA (16 μg) of each experimental group were used, except for total mouse pituitary RNA, that served as a positive control, where 0.5 and 2 μg of total RNA were used. RIA for mouse PRL was performed in duplicate as described previously (31.Escalada J. Cacicedo L. Ortego J. Melian E. Sanchez-Franco F. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). RIA components were purchased to Dr. Parlow (Pituitary Hormones and Cancer Center, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center). Iodination of mPRL with 125I was conducted using the chloramine-T method. Rabbit anti-mouse PRL serum (anti-mPRL AFP-131078) was used at a final dilution of 1/200,000 and samples were incubated for 18–24 h at room temperature prior to addition of secondary antibody. Medium samples were compared with a standard curve prepared with reference preparation (AFP-6476C), as described previously (31.Escalada J. Cacicedo L. Ortego J. Melian E. Sanchez-Franco F. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The assay sensitivity was 0.48 ng/ml. After 48 of incubation with or without FGF-2, culture media (8 ml) from GHFT and HeLa cells were collected, frozen at −80 °C, lyophilized, and resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate buffer to load directly into the RIA. Constructs containing different fragments of the rat PRL promoter fused to luciferase or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase were described previously (12.Castillo A.I. Tolón R. Jimenez-Lara A.M. Aranda A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1141-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20.Castillo A.I. Tolon R.M. Aranda A.

Expression vectors for GHF-1, c-Ets-1, dominant negative Ets-1 (encoding the DNA binding domain of c-Ets-2), oncogenic Ha-ras Val-12, and the dominant inhibitory Ha-ras Asn-17 mutant (20.Castillo A.I. Tolon R.M. Aranda A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1981-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were also used in the transfection assays. Cells were transfected with calcium phosphate and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and luciferase activity determined as described previously (12.Castillo A.I. Tolón R. Jimenez-Lara A.M. Aranda A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1141-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20.Castillo A.I. Tolon R.M. Aranda A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1981-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Reporter plasmids (1 μg/plate) were transfected alone or in combination with the amounts of expression vectors indicated in the corresponding figures. In all experiments the amount of DNA was kept constant by addition of the same amount of an “empty” expression vector. Assays were performed with nuclear extracts (32.Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19 (2499): 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar) from GHFT, GH4C1, and HeLa cells. The labeledPRL promoter fragment −176 to −101 was obtained by PCR using the oligonucleotides 5′-cccaagcttTGGCCACTATGTCTTCCT-3′ and 5′-CAATCATCTATTTCCGTCAT-3′ as primers. The first oligonucleotide was previously end-labeled with [32P]ATP using T4-polynucleotide kinase. For the binding reaction, the extracts were incubated on ice for 15 min in a buffer (20 mm Tris HCL (pH 7.5), 75 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 13% glycerol) containing 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) and then for 15–20 min at room temperature with approximately 50,000 cpm of labeled DNA fragment. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE buffer. The gels were then dried and autoradiographed at −70 °C. The levels of GHF-1 and Ets were determined by immunoblot analysis in GHFT, GH4C1, and HeLa cells. Cell extracts were prepared in a lysis buffer supplemented with a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (32.Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19 (2499): 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of proteins (100 μg) were suspended in SDS sample buffer and resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and, after blocking in 5% dried milk, were probed with a 1/1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antibody generated against GHF-1 (5.Bodner M. Castrillo J.L. Theill L.E. Deerinck Ellisman M. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), and with 1/500 dilution of an antibody (sc112, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) that recognizes Ets-1 and Ets-2. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected by chemiluminescence. To identify extracellular factors capable of inducingPRL expression in GHFT precursor cells, we tested several hormones, peptides, and growth factors known to have a stimulatory effect on synthesis and/or release of PRL in differentiated lactotropes. We arbitrarily divided the factors into 3 groups. In group I, we analyzed the effects of ligands of nuclear hormone receptors that were demonstrated to transactivate the GHF-1 and/or thePRL genes, including vitamin D3 (12.Castillo A.I. Tolón R. Jimenez-Lara A.M. Aranda A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1141-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 33.Nelson C. Albert V.R. Elsholtz H.P. Lu L.I.-W. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1988; 239: 1400-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), retinoic acid (34.Rhodes S.J. Chen R. DiMattia G.E. Scully K.M. Kalla K.A. Lin S.-C., Yu, V.C. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 913-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 35.Sánchez-Pacheco A. Palomino T. Aranda A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5391-5398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and both. 17β-Estradiol, a strong stimulator of PRL gene expression, was tested alone and in combination with retinoic acid and/or vitamin D3. In group II, we analyzed the peptides thyrotropin releasing hormone, epidermal growth factor, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1–38. We also checked combinations of two, three, and four of these factors, along with combinations of group I substances. Group III included human nerve growth factor-β (NGF-β; Ref. 36.Missale C. Boroni F. Frassine M. Caruso A. Spano P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and FGF-2 (22.Porter T.E. Wiles C.D. Frawley S. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), growth factors implicated in differentiation of cultured neonatal pituitary cells. We also checked these factors in combination with group I and group II agents. All treatments were performed under the same conditions for at least 48 h. After treatment, total RNA was isolated from cells, and expression of genes for PRL, GH, and GHF-1 was examined by RT-PCR. This screen revealed that only when FGF-2 was included in the experimental treatment, expression of PRL mRNA was detectable. None of the other agents either alone or in combination were able to induce PRL transcripts in GHFT cells (data not shown). Fig. 1 a shows a representative experiment of dose response of FGF-2 effect on GHFT cells. The expected amplified PRL band was obtained in cells treated with 10 nm FGF-2 for 24 h. This band was amplified when mouse pituitary RNA was used as a positive control but not when HeLa cell RNA was used as a negative control. Although 10 nm FGF-2 was the most effective dose in inducingPRL gene expression, incubation with 0.01 nmFGF-2 was sufficient to produce a weak detectable signal. Expression ofPRL mRNA was detectable within 6 h of treatment with FGF-2 and remained elevated for at least 30 h (Fig.1 b). The same treatment did not cause the appearance ofPRL mRNA in HeLa cells. Under all conditions at which FGF-2 induced PRL gene expression, no induction ofGH gene expression was detectable. However, GHFT cells continued to express GHF-1, a transcription factor necessary forGH and PRL gene expression (data not shown). To confirm that PRL gene expression was properly initiated after FGF-2 treatment, RPA was used (Fig.2 a). The expected protected double fragment corresponding to properly initiated PRL RNA was found in samples of FGF-treated GHFT cells (lane 6) but not in the untreated cells (lane 5). Longer exposures of the autoradiogram (up to 2 weeks) confirmed the results, demonstrating the presence of the double protected fragment ofPRL mRNA only in the positive control (total RNA from mouse pituitary) and in the newly differentiated precursor (GHFT cells after FGF-2 exposure) (Fig. 2 b). Therefore, RPA confirmed that FGF-2 was able to promote PRL expression. However, the levels of PRL transcripts produced by GHFT-treated cells were much lower than those expressed in mouse pituitary (lanes 3 and 4). These results confirm that, although FGF-2 appears to be an important factor for the initiation of PRL gene expression in GHFT cells and is able to initiate lactotrope differentiation, other factors are required to attain the high levels of PRL gene transcription found in the pituitary gland. After mRNA production, the next steps in expression of a polypeptidic hormone include translation, post-translational processing and secretion to the extracellular environment. Fig. 3 shows the effect of FGF-2 on PRL secretion by GHFT cells. Immunoreactive PRL (IR-mPRL) was essentially undetectable in medium from either untreated GHFT cells or from HeLa cells treated for different time periods with FGF-2 (Fig.3 a). However, following FGF-2 treatment, mPRL gradually accumulated in the culture medium and reached a level of 2 ng/ml after 24 h of treatment. This stimulatory effect was not lost after longer incubation intervals (72 and 120 h). As shown in Fig.3 b, treatment with a low dose of FGF-2 (0.1 nm) for 48 h was enough to produce detectable PRL secretion. Detection of PRL in the cell culture supernatants confirms that FGF-2 initiates differentiation of GHFT cells into PRL-expressing and secreting lactotropic cells. To analyze the elements that mediate increased PRL gene transcription in response to FGF-2 treatment, transient transfection experiments with reporter plasmids containing different fragments (Fig.4 a) of the rat PRLpromoter were performed. As shown in Fig. 4 b, incubation of GHFT cells with FGF-2 increased the activity of a promoter construct which contains the PRL distal enhancer (between −1.8 and 1.5 kilobase pairs) ligated to the −422/+34 PRL promoter fragment. In five independent experiments, incubation for 8–9 h with 1 nm FGF-2 increased luciferase activity by 2.7 ± 0.3-fold (p < 0.001). A 24-h incubation stimulated activity by 1.9 ± 0.2 (p < 0.01). A construct extending only to −422 bp, which does not contain the distal enhancer, was also stimulated by FGF-2 (Fig. 4 b). In contrast, a plasmid in which the −78/+34 promoter fragment was ligated to the distal enhancer was not significantly activated by FGF-2. The activity of the −38/+34 fragment was very low and was not affected by FGF-2. These data demonstrate that the elements responsible for FGF-2 responsiveness are contained between nucleotides −422 and −78. These results are in agreement with the previous observation that FGF-2 induction of the PRL promoter in GH4 cells maps to this region. A more detailed mapping was performed with plasmids extending to −176, −101, and −70 bp, and to better resolve the effect of FGF-2 the transfections were performed in GH4C1 cells, in which incubation with FGF-2 produced a stronger stimulation of PRL promoter activity (Fig. 4 c). A similar increase (9-fold) was found with constructs containing either the entire 5′-flanking region (3 kilobase pairs) or extending only to −176 bp. However, stimulation decreased to a mere 2-fold when sequences between −176 and −101 were deleted, and disappeared upon a deletion to −70. Thus, the region between −176 and −101 bp of the PRL promoter, which contains a GHF-1 binding site overlapping with an Ets binding site (37.Conrad K.E. Oberweter J.M Vaillancourt R. Johnson G.L. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,38.Bradford A.P. Wasylyk C. Wasylik B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2849-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), significantly contributes to the induction of promoter activity by FGF-2. The role of the proximal Ets binding sites in the residual stimulation by FGF-2 of the reporter that extents −101 bp is demonstrated by the finding that the −101mut reporter in which the Ets binding sites were rendered non-functional (20.Castillo A.I. Tolon R.M. Aranda A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1981-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) did not show a significant response to FGF-2 (Fig. 4 c). In different experiments, basal PRL promoter activity was found to be consistently lower in precursor GHFT cells than in the PRL-producing GH4C1 cells. As both GHF-1 and Ets factors appear to play an important role in PRL gene transcription, we tested the possibility that a lower expression of these transcription factors in the precursor cells could contribute to low promoter activity. Indeed, as analyzed by gel retardation assay with the prolactin promoter fragment −176 to −101, GHFT cells expressed lower levels of GHF-1 than GH4C1 cells (Fig.5 a). GHF-1 and Ets protein levels were then compared by Western blotting of GHFT, GH4C1, and HeLa cell extracts. This analysis confirmed the reduced content of GHF-1 in GHFT cells. The anti-GHF-1 antibody recognized the characteristic 31- and 33-kDa doublet in pituitary cells, which was less abundant in GHFT cells (Fig. 5 b). In the blot shown in the figure, obtained after a long exposure, two other weaker bands of 36 and 28 kDa were observed in GH4C1 cells, and no bands were detected in HeLa cells. In addition, the levels of endogenous Ets factors were markedly lower in GHFT cells than in GH4C1 or HeLa cells (Fig. 5 b). To functionally determine the role of these factors in basalPRL promoter activity as well as in its induction by FGF-2, we examined the influence of ectopically expressed c-Ets-1 alone or in combination with GHF-1 on PRL promoter activity. Overexpression of GHF-1 and/or c-Ets-1 did not further activate thePRL promoter in GH4C1 cells that already contain high endogenous levels of these factors (20.Castillo A.I. Tolon R.M. Aranda A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1981-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, cotransfection with the c-Ets-1 vector increased the activity of the PRLpromoter in GHFT cells and overexpression of GHF-1 further enhanced this activation (Fig. 5 c). After overexpression of c-Ets-1 and GHF-1, PRL promoter activity in GHFT cells was quite similar to that found in GH4C1 cells. These results suggest that the endogenous levels of GHF-1 and Ets factors are limiting in GHFT cells and confirm the important role of Ets proteins in activation of this promoter. Ras acts synergistically with Ets and GHF-1 to stimulate PRLpromoter activity in lactotropic cell lines (20.Castillo A.I. Tolon R.M. Aranda A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1981-1991Crossref"
https://openalex.org/W1989988634,"Control of gene expression often requires that transcription terminates rapidly after destruction, inactivation, or nuclear export of transcription factors. However, the role of transcription factor inactivation in terminating transcription is unclear. We have developed a means of conducting order of addition and co-occupancy experiments in living cells by rapidly exchanging proteins bound to promoters. Using this approach, we found that, following specific disruption of activator function, transcription from active promoters decayed slowly, persisting through multiple cell divisions. This persistent transcriptional activity raised the question of what mechanisms return promoters to inactive states. By exchanging or directing co-occupancy of protein complexes bound to a promoter, we found that the transcriptional inhibitor, Ssn6-Tup1, lost its effectiveness as a repressor following activator dissociation. Similar experiments with another repressor, the histone deacetylase Sin3-Rpd3, reinforced this distinction between repression in the presence and absence of an activator. These results suggest that although repressors such as Ssn6-Tup1 and Sin3-Rpd3 prevent activation of gene expression, other mechanisms of repression return promoters to inactive states following the dissociation or inactivation of a transcriptional activator.

FK506-binding protein FKBP-rapamycin-binding domain calcineurin FK506/rapamycin binding domain of FRAP (FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein) Although many mechanisms of transcriptional regulation have been proposed, perhaps the most general and well documented is the recruitment of transcriptional activators to sites on DNA (for review see Ref. 1Ho S.N. Biggar S.R. Spencer D.M. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 382: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The effectiveness of recruitment seems surprising; because the mammalian genome encodes perhaps 10,000 transcriptional activators (61Henikoff S. Greene E.A. Pietrokovski S. Bork P. Attwood T.K. Hood L. Science. 1997; 278: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), random interactions of activators with promoters would be expected based on a high cumulative concentration of activators within the nucleus. Furthermore, activators often require only short stretches of DNA for stable binding in vitro, and therefore a background of transcription would be expected because of nonspecific DNA binding by activators. The fact that such a background is not generally observed suggests that repressors and/or chromatin prevents transcription resulting from nonspecific functions of the many activators in the nucleus. Alternatively, recruitment or displacement of an activator might actually be remarkably precise regulatory mechanisms, and repressors and chromatin serve other purposes. Controlling the proximity of an activator to DNA may also be important in inactivating transcription in response to external stimuli. In many cases, activators are displaced from DNA after post-translational modification of the activator, for example, by phosporylation. In other cases, transcription factors are exported from the nucleus (NF-ATc and Pho4) or degraded (Swi5, NFκB) following the termination of signaling (62Nasmyth K. Adolf G. Lydall D. Seddon A. Cell. 1990; 62: 631-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 63O'Neill E.M. Kaffman A. Jolly E.R. O'Shea E.K.

Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). In each case, the promoter is left without the function of a critical activator. Disrupting activators coincides with transcriptional down-regulation over fairly short periods of time. These rapid responses generate the tightly controlled patterns of expression of cell cycle-regulated genes and direct a well ordered sequence of gene expression in lymphocytes following receptor activation. A priori, mechanisms that lead to the termination of transcription could be as simple as removal of the activator or may include additional repressor mechanisms dedicated to returning genes to their inactive states. We set out to establish whether specifically disrupting activator function sufficed to rapidly silence gene expression. Transcriptional repressors inhibit gene expression. Interestingly, promoters lacking binding sites for transcriptional activators fail to drive expression in vivo, suggesting that the presence or absence of activators, and not transcriptional repressors, determines which genes are turned on and off. Instead of preventing gene expression, repressors may expedite the silencing of active promoters. Consistent with this possibility, stimuli that silence ongoing expression lead to the simultaneous displacement of an activator and recruitment of a repressor at several promoters (2Bowdish K.S. Mitchell A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2172-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 3Bowdish K.S. Yuan H.E. Mitchell A.P. Mol. Cell.

In these examples, repressors are functionally positioned to quickly shut off transcription. Thus we wanted to explore this potential role of transcriptional repressors in more detail. The activities of transcription factors require, in many cases, the simple act of localizing these proteins to sites within promoters (5Ptashne M. Gann A.

We exploited this principle to develop methods of regulating the activities of transcriptional activators and repressors by controlling their interactions with DNA. The interactions generated by cell-permeable compounds such as FK506, and rapamycin permitted the use of these drugs to control transcription factor activity in living cells (1Ho S.N. Biggar S.R. Spencer D.M. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 382: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In the present study we have made use of the reversibility of FK506-driven interactions to activate and inactivate the function of a transcriptional activator in vivo. The properties of FK506 and rapamycin allowed us to further develop this system and perform experiments in which activators and repressors acted either sequentially or simultaneously at the same promoter. Using these approaches we showed that transcription shuts off slowly following the disruption of activator function. The remaining transcriptional activity was relatively insensitive to suppression by Sin3-Rpd3 and Ssn6-Tup1, indicating that these repressors are dedicated to preventing activation from a promoter but do not serve to reset promoters to inactive states after activator displacement.

The FRB overexpression vector, pYSB100-FRB45, expresses the 45-kDa FRB domain of the yeast Tor1 (amino acids 1765–2158) from the yeastGPD1 promoter.

YCpG4/FK is a single copy plasmid (unlike pGal4/FKBP) expressing Gal4BD-FKBP12 from the ADH1 promoter. The FRB-Ssn6 expression construct, pFRAP-Ssn6, expressed the entire open reading frame of SSN6 fused to the FRB domain of FRAP (amino acids 2012–2114) (8Chen J. Zheng X.F. Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) from the GPD1 promoter on a single-copy URA3 plasmid. The FRB-Sin3 expression construct, pFRAP-Sin3, expressed the open reading frame of SIN3 fused to the FRB domain of FRAP from the GPD1 promoter on a single-copy URA3 plasmid. Details of the construction of these plasmids are available upon request. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (1Ho S.N. Biggar S.R. Spencer D.M. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 382: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Total yeast RNA was isolated as described (60Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). To minimize the amounts of rapamycin and FK506 necessary to conduct these experiments, cells in log phase were concentrated 3-fold in fresh medium at 30 °C. Under these conditions, cells continued to divide exponentially for at least 7 h (data not shown). For unknown reasons, rapamycin competes with FK506 more efficiently at higher cell densities (data not shown). Thus a 300-fold excess of rapamycin completely eliminated FK506-induced transcriptional activation under these conditions. mRNA levels were determined by Northern blotting using antisense RNA probes as described (1Ho S.N. Biggar S.R. Spencer D.M. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 382: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). RNA levels were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis using ImageQuant software. The HIS3 probe recognized an endogenous message whose levels corresponded well to β-actin (ACT1) message levels (data not shown). This band was therefore used a control for RNA loading. To arrest cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle, cells were grown into mid-log phase in minimal glucose medium, spun, and resuspended in rich glucose medium (pH 6.0) containing 50 ng/ml FK506 and 40 μg/ml α-factor for 3 h at 30 °C. >95% of cells were schmoos at this time. Cells were washed twice with fresh YPD and split into two cultures. Fresh α-factor was added to one of the cultures, and both were treated with 15 μg/ml rapamycin. >95% of cells budded and divided after washing and growth in the absence of A-factor, whereas cells maintained in A-factor retained schmoo morphology (data not shown). To study the roles of activators and repressors in controlling gene expression, a method of inducibly and reversibly localizing proteins to promoters in living cells was developed (1Ho S.N. Biggar S.R. Spencer D.M. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 382: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This strategy was based on the use of synthetic ligands or chemical inducers of dimerization and takes advantage of the fact that, in many cases, recruitment of transcription factors to DNA suffices to activate their function (5Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar,6Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4852) Google Scholar). The specific approach in this study employed two cell-permeable compounds, FK506 and rapamycin, which both bind the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) with nanomolar affinities (7Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3608) Google Scholar, 8Chen J. Zheng X.F. Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Navia M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 507-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). The composite surface formed by FKBP-FK506 or FKBP-rapamycin binds either calcineurin or an FKBP-rapamycin binding domain (FRB), respectively. In cells expressing the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4BD) fused to FKBP12, FK506 induces the association of FKBP12 with calcineurin (CN) at promoters containing Gal4-binding sites. By creating a version of calcineurin fused to the Gal4 activation domain (Gal4AD-CN), we generated a means of using FK506 to recruit an activator to a promoter and activate transcription (Fig.1 A) (1Ho S.N. Biggar S.R. Spencer D.M. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 382: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Rapamycin, which dissociates FK506-mediated interactions by competing for binding to FKBP, was then used to displace the activator from Gal4BD-FKBP12 and the promoter. Using a related approach, fusions between transcriptional repressors and the FRB domain permitted the use of rapamycin to recruit repressors and thereby inhibit transcription from promoters containing Gal4-binding sites. In yeast expressing Gal4BD-FKBP12, Gal4AD-CN, and FRB-repressor fusion proteins, FK506 and rapamycin were used to regulate the activities of both activators and repressors at the same promoter. In this way, order of addition experiments, in which an activator and a repressor act sequentially, and co-occupancy experiments, in which the activator and repressor act simultaneously, were conducted in vivo (Fig. 1 B). The use of FK506 and rapamycin afford relatively specific means of controlling protein activity in vivo. These small molecules share a nearly unique mechanism of action in that they generate large and specific protein-protein interfaces that simulate normal protein-protein interactions. Genome-wide analysis revealed that FK506 and rapamycin each altered the expression of less than 0.5% of yeast genes (10Marton M.J. DeRisi J.L. Bennett H.A. Iyer V.R. Meyer M.R. Roberts C.J.

Crabtree, unpublished data. By contrast, temperature shifts, which have been used traditionally to regulate protein activity in vivo, alter the expression of about 600 (∼10%) yeast genes (11DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3695) Google Scholar). In cells expressing the Gal4BD-FKBP12 and Gal4AD-CN fusions, FK506 activated transcription of the endogenous GAL1 gene and an integratedGAL1-HIS3 gene over a period of about 90 min (Fig.2, A and B). These kinetics appeared surprisingly slow but in fact closely corresponded to the rate at which galactose induces transcription from theGAL1 promoter under physiologic conditions (12Johnston M. Flick J.S. Pexton T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3834-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 13Amon A. Irniger S. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 77: 1037-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Importantly, rapamycin-mediated recruitment of an activation domain showed similar kinetics of transcriptional induction, demonstrating that rapamycin rapidly enters cells and binds Gal4BD-FKBP12 (see Fig. 4and data not shown). Other studies also suggest that rapamycin crosses membranes and forms complexes with its binding proteins within minutes of its addition to medium (14Barbet N.C. Schneider U. Helliwell S.B. Stansfield I. Tuite M.F. Hall M.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar).Figure 4Rapid dissociation of FKBP-FK506-calcineurin complexes in vivo. A, YSB7 expressing Gal4BD-FKBP12 and a Gal4AD-FRB fusion was transformed with a plasmid overexpressing murine calcineurin A and yeast calcineurin B (+ CN) or an empty control plasmid (no CN). Following a 1-h pretreatment with (+FK506) or without (−FK506) 250 ng/ml FK506, 1.5 μg/ml rapamycin was added (t = 0′). At this concentration of rapamycin, FK506 did not inhibit transcriptional activation when cells were treated with the two drugs simultaneously (data not shown). The experimental protocol is shown schematically. Aliquots of cells were removed at the indicated times following addition of rapamycin, andGAL1 mRNA levels were measured by Northern blotting. An endogenous HIS3 message (h) was measured to control for RNA loading. B, message levels were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis and corrected for relative RNA loading. Fold activation was measured as GAL1 mRNA levels relative to untreated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Once transcriptional activation by FK506 reached a steady state, treatment with rapamycin to dissociate the activation domain rapidly reduced GAL1 and HIS3 mRNA levels. Because the GAL1 and HIS3 messages have extremely short half-lives in yeast (<5 min; see Fig. 5 C (15Flick J.S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4757-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 16Herrick D. Parker R. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar)), measuring the levels of these two messages provided accurate assessments of the ongoing rates of transcription of both genes. Addition of rapamycin prior to steady state activation both blocked maximal activation and reduced mRNA levels (Fig. 2 C). In this case, the accumulation of message immediately following rapamycin addition most likely reflected the time required for rapamycin to dissociate FK506-mediated interactions (see below). Thus, consistent with previous studies (1Ho S.N. Biggar S.R. Spencer D.M. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 382: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), these results confirmed that activators play a continuous role in maintaining activated transcription. Interestingly, we consistently observed the persistence of a reduced level of transcription following extended rapamycin treatment, suggesting that promoters do not immediately return to their basal, inactive states following activation domain dissociation (Fig.2). This phenomenon is quantitated in Fig. 2 B. After treatment with rapamycin, transcription of GAL1 andHIS3 decayed slowly with a t12 of approximately 50 min. The promoters returned eventually to their inactive states, but the observed declines in HIS3 andGAL1 transcriptional activity were delayed significantly relative to that expected if transcription ceased following activation domain dissociation (for the predicted curve, see dotted line in Fig. 2 B). The expected kinetics, which predict a 90% reduction in mRNA levels within 30–40 min, reflect both the half-life of the messages and the known kinetics of dissociation of the FKBP-FK506-calcineurin complex (see Fig. 4). The concentrations of rapamycin used to compete with FK506 completely blocked FK506-induced transcription (data not shown and Ref. 1Ho S.N. Biggar S.R. Spencer D.M. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 382: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and the Gal4BD-FKBP12 fusion did not activate transcription in the absence of FK506 (Fig.3 A). Thus we set out to determine whether this residual transcriptional activity truly persisted in the absence of the activation domain. Given the ability of Gal4BD-FKBP12-rapamycin to bind the Tor proteins, the persistence of residual transcription following rapamycin treatment could have resulted from recruitment of a cryptic activation domain(s) in these or related proteins. Indeed, assays for β-galactosidase activity, which are significantly more sensitive than Northern blotting for detecting expression, revealed a low level of transcriptional activity in cells treated with rapamycin (Fig. 3 A). To determine whether residual transcription following activator dissociation could have been the result of rapamycin-induced recruitment of Tor or other proteins, we overexpressed the FRB domain of Tor1. This domain of Tor1 (amino acids 1765–2158) renders wild-type cells resistant to rapamycin, most likely by competing with the full-length Tor proteins for binding to FKBP-rapamycin (17Zheng X.F. Florentino D. Chen J. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 121-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The same domain of the highly homologous Tor2 protein fails to activate transcription when fused directly to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (18Stan R. McLaughlin M.M. Cafferkey R. Johnson R.K. Rosenberg M. Livi G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32027-32030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus FRB overexpression should compete with any potential activators for binding to Gal4BD-FKBP12-rapamycin without stimulating transcription. As predicted, overexpressing FRB eliminated the low level of transcription induced by rapamycin (Fig. 3), indicating that FKBP-rapamycin does not interact with activators at sites other than the FRB-binding site. Despite FRB overexpression, however, residual transcription persisted following transcriptional activation with FK506 and subsequent treatment with excess rapamycin (Fig. 3 B). Residual transcription was also observed when cells were washed to remove FK506 without adding rapamycin (see Fig. 7 B). Thus, residual transcriptional activity was not due to recruitment of an activator by rapamycin. FK506 was chosen for activation domain recruitment because of the short half-lives of the interactions it generates. In studies with purified proteins, the half-life of the FKBP-FK506-calcineurin complex has been estimated to be less than 5 min. 3S. L. Schreiber, personal communication. However, interactions with other cellular proteins in vivo or the effects of DNA binding by Gal4BD-FKBP12 could have altered the dissociation kinetics under the conditions of our experiments. These influences on the stability of FKBP-FK506-calcineurin complexes could have unexpectedly prolonged the association of the activation domain following rapamycin treatment and thus sustained transcription following rapamycin treatment as a result of incomplete dissociation of the Gal4AD-CN fusion from Gal4BD-FKBP12. To address this possibility and confirm the half-life of FK506-driven interactions, the kinetics of dissociation of the FKBP-FK506-calcineurin complex were determined in vivo. To measure the stability of FKBP-FK506-calcineurin complexes, Gal4BD-FKBP12 was expressed with two additional proteins: a version of calcineurin lacking an activation domain and a fusion between the Gal4 activation domain and an FKBP-rapamycin-binding domain (FRB-AD). Calcineurin was expressed in excess of Gal4BD-FKBP12 (data not shown), and high concentrations (250 ng/ml) of FK506 were used to saturate Gal4BD-FKBP12 in complexes with calcineurin. Because of the lack of an activation domain on calcineurin, FK506 did not activate transcription. When rapamycin was added, it competed with FK506 for binding to Gal4BD-FKBP12, thereby displacing calcineurin and concomitantly recruiting FRB-AD to activate transcription. Thus, monitoring transcriptional activity following rapamycin addition provided a means of determining the rate at which rapamycin dissociated the complex of FK506, calcineurin, and Gal4BD-FKBP12. Pretreatment with FK506 introduced an approximately 15-min delay in transcriptional induction by rapamycin (Fig.4). This delay represented the time required for rapamycin to displace FK506 and calcineurin. These data predicted a half-life of approximately 5 min for the FKBP-FK506-calcineurin complex in vivo, consistent with the rate of dissociation of the complex measured in vitro. In cells not overexpressing calcineurin, FK506 did not detectably delay rapamycin-induced transcription (Fig. 4), consistent with the short half-life of the FKBP-FK506 interaction (<2 min).3 Our measurement probably overestimated the actual time required for thein vivo dissociation of calcineurin because activation domains function synergistically to activate transcription from promoters with multiple binding sites (19Carey M. Lin Y.S. Green M.R. Ptashne M. Nature. 1990; 345: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Thus, before significant transcription would be induced by rapamycin-mediated activator recruitment, most of the four Gal4-binding sites in the promoter would need to be cleared of FK506 and calcineurin. The parallel nature of the two curves for cells overexpressing calcineurin indicated that essentially all Gal4 sites were occupied by FRB-AD prior to detectable transcriptional induction. The short half-lives of these interactions are consistent with the observation that FK506 does not induce any stabilizing conformational changes in either FKBP or calcineurin (9Griffith J.P. Kim J.L. Kim E.E. Sintchak M.D. Thomson J.A. Fitzgibbon M.J. Fleming M.A. Caron P.R. Hsiao K. Navia M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 507-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our studies demonstrated that DNA binding by Gal4BD-FKBP12 did not significantly alter the rate of dissociation the FKBP-FK506-calcineurin complex and also that endogenous yeast proteins did not stabilize this complexin vivo. Importantly, these kinetic studies utilized the same protein domains used for activator recruitment by FK506. Thus, the rate of dissociation of the FKBP-FK506-calcineurin complex in these experiments was subject to the same influences that DNA-binding proteins and/or endogenous yeast proteins might have had during activation domain recruitment by FK506. These results strongly suggest that extended periods of rapamycin treatment quantitatively displaced Gal4AD-CN from the promoters. The experiments presented in Fig. 4 would have been unable to detect the persistence of a small fraction of calcineurin on promoters following rapamycin treatment, because sufficient FRB-AD had been recruited to fully activate transcription. A similar small amount of the Gal4AD-CN fusion could have remained associated with promoters when rapamycin was used to dissociate the activation domain. However, the synergistic nature of activator function (19Carey M. Lin Y.S. Green M.R. Ptashne M. Nature. 1990; 345: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) requires that most of the Gal4 sites on the promoter be occupied to induce transcription and therefore suggests that persistence of a small fraction of Gal4AD-CN at the promoter following rapamycin treatment would be insufficient to activate significant levels of transcription. Furthermore, transcription maintained by the presence of a small fraction of Gal4AD-CN would be expected to display the functional properties of activated transcription, which, as shown below, was not the case. Persistence of transcription in a subpopulation of cells, such that a fraction of cells differentially maintained high level gene expression, is unlikely because expression of green flourescent protein at the single-cell level varied evenly across the entire population of cells in response to treatments similar to those used in the studies described above (data not shown). Unfortunately, the prolonged half-life of green flourescent protein precluded single-cell analysis of the rate at which transcription shuts off following rapamycin treatment. We began to investigate the nature of the persistent transcriptional activity by comparing the abilities of glucose to repress activated and"

Both strains, however, exhibit decreased activation-induced T-cell death and an imbalance in TH1- and TH2-mediated immune responses (12.Dong C. Yang D.D. Wysk M. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J.

Deletion of both JNK1 and JNK2 causes embryonic lethality due to severe disregulation of apoptosis during brain development (15.Kuan C.Y. Yang D.D. Samanta Roy D.R. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar).In HeLa cells, UV irradiation has been reported to activate the c-Src tyrosine-protein kinase and based on the inhibitory effect of expressing catalytically inactive v-src, it has been concluded that Src activity is essential for UV-induced activation of JNK in these cells (16.Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). However, neither the mechanism of Src activation by UV light nor how this leads to JNK stimulation is clear. It is likely that Lck, a Src kinase expressed predominantly in T lymphocytes (17.Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 683-686PubMed Google Scholar), is involved in activation of JNK following ligation of the T-cell receptor and CD28 (18.Jacinto E. Werlen G. Karin M. Immunity. 1998; 8: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Lck is required for T cell maturation (19.Molina T.J. Kishihara K. Siderovski D.P. van Ewijk W.

Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) and signaling from the T-cell antigen receptor in mature T lymphocytes. A derivative of the Jurkat T-cell line that has lost expression of full-length Lck, JCaM.1, is unresponsive to stimulation through the T-cell receptor (20.Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). These JCaM.1 cells have greatly reduced calcium flux into the cytoplasm and JNK activation under conditions that fully stimulate their parental Jurkat T cells (18.Jacinto E. Werlen G. Karin M. Immunity. 1998; 8: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20.Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Because reintroduction of Lck restores signaling, calcium flux, and JNK activation, the absence of Lck is responsible for the signaling defect from the T cell receptor in these cells.The mechanism for activation of JNK after UV exposure is not understood. UV-induced activation of JNK is not necessarily because of chromosomal DNA damage, because JNK stimulation is observed in enucleated cells (21.Devary Y. Rosette C. Didonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). This suggests that there is at least one UV target other than DNA responsible for activation of JNK. A role for reactive oxygen intermediates in the propagation of the UV signal has been suggested. N-acetylcysteine, a glutathione precursor that elevates the reducing potential in the cytoplasm, inhibits UV-induced JNK activation and c-jun phosphorylation (16.Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar,22.Renzing J. Hansen S. Lane D.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1105-1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3394) Google Scholar, 24.Staal F. Roederer M. Raju P. Anderson M. Ela S. Herzenberg L. Herzenberg L. AIDS Res. Hum. Retrovir. 1993; 9: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This suggests that UV irradiation may lead to elevated levels of oxidants that either directly or indirectly lead to JNK stimulation. Lck is activated by hydrogen peroxide (25.Hardwick J.S. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4527-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 26.Paige L.A. Nadler M.J. Harrison M.L. Cassady J.M. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8669-8674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Yurchak L.K. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6914-6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), a progenitor of reactive oxygen intermediates. Because UV apparently generates reactive oxygen intermediates and has been reported to activate the c-Src kinase, it was reasonable to suspect that ultraviolet light might also activate Lck in T cells. Furthermore, the finding that Lck is essential for stimulation of JNK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinases after T-cell activation (18.Jacinto E. Werlen G. Karin M. Immunity. 1998; 8: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) suggested that Lck is essential for propagation of some upstream signals to these mitogen-activated protein kinases. We therefore asked whether and how UV irradiation activated Lck in T cells and whether Src family kinases were essential for UV-induced activation of JNK in a variety of cells including T lymphocytes.DISCUSSIONExposure of bacteria to UV light and other DNA damaging agents induces the SOS response (38.Little J.W. Mount D.W. Cell. 1982; 29: 11-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, 39.Walker G.C. Marsh L. Dodson L. Environ. Health Perspect. 1985; 62: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Either DNA damage or by-products of DNA damage are thought to initiate this response. The mammalian stress response was also originally attributed to DNA damage. However, recent work has shown that stress responses can occur in the absence of DNA damage (40.Herrlich P. Blattner C. Knebel A. Bender K. Rahmsdorf H.J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 1217-1229PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Bender K. Blattner C. Knebel A. Iordanov M. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. J. Photochem.

Bioessays. 1996; 18: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and that not all DNA damaging agents yield identical responses or produce the same outcome (40.Herrlich P. Blattner C. Knebel A. Bender K. Rahmsdorf H.J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 1217-1229PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Shafman T. Khanna K.K. Kedar P. Spring K. Kozlov S. Yen T. Hobson K. Gatei M. Zhang N. Watters D. Egerton M. Shiloh Y. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Lavin M.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The stress response to reactive oxygen intermediates and UV light is likely to be triggered in the cytoplasm or the plasma membrane, because both nuclear factor-κB and activator protein-1 are activated by UV light in enucleated cells (21.Devary Y. Rosette C. Didonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). It has been reported that UV irradiation activates the c-Src protein kinase in HeLa cells and UV-induced activation of JNK is inhibited by expression of a catalytically inactive v-Src protein (16.Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). This suggested that c-Src was an essential component of the cellular response to ultraviolet light. Here, we asked whether UV-induced activation of Src kinases occurred in lymphocytes, and if so, was it important. Because Lck is an abundant member of the Src family of tyrosine-protein kinases in T lymphocytes, is activated readily by hydrogen peroxide, and is known to be essential for CD3/CD28-dependent activation of JNK, we examined the role of Lck in UV-induced activation of JNK in T cells (18.Jacinto E. Werlen G. Karin M. Immunity. 1998; 8: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25.Hardwick J.S. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4527-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 28.Voronova A.F. Buss J.E. Patschinsky T. Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1984; 4: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 45.Voronova A.F. Adler H.T. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4407-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Exposure of either human or murine T cells to UV light did not stimulate Lck under conditions that activated JNK robustly (Fig. 1). We then asked whether UV-induced activation of Src kinases was unique to adherent cells. However, neither wild type Lck nor the hypersensitive A2F505 mutant of Lck were stimulated after UV irradiation of fibroblasts in which these Lck proteins were expressed ectopically (Fig. 2). Although Lck was not activated by UV irradiation, the possibility remained that Lck was required for the stimulation of JNK in an activation-independent manner. We therefore asked whether UV could activate JNK in JCaM.1 cells that lack Lck. We found that JNK was activated to the same extent in the Lck-deficient JCaM.1 cells as in the parental Jurkat T cells (Fig. 3). Fyn, another Src kinase, was also unaffected by exposure to UV light in JCaM.1 and Jurkat cells, indicating that another abundant Src kinase was not compensating for the loss of Lck (data not shown).We also examined the ability of UV to activate JNK in fibroblasts that express no known Src kinases (33.Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). We found that UV-induced activation of JNK was intact in S−Y−F−cells that express no Src kinases and indistinguishable from that observed in cells from littermates with functional c-srcgene (Fig. 4). We finally evaluated the role of the Src family kinases in the UV response using the Src kinase inhibitor PP2. Under conditions where PP2 treatment inhibited more than 90% of total tyrosine phosphorylation, UV-induced activation of JNK in 293T cells ectopically expressing activated Lck remained largely intact (Fig. 5). PP2 treatment similarly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation in Jurkat T cells and human HeLa cells without noticeably affecting UV-induced activation of JNK (data not shown).We conclude that the activity of Src kinases is not required for stimulation of JNK by UV irradiation in any of the cells we tested. Our results do not, however, suggest that Src kinases or tyrosine-protein kinases cannot activate JNK. Sodium vanadate, which induces elevated levels of tyrosine protein phosphorylation, activates JNK in a variety of cell types, and overexpression of Lck stimulates JNK in Jurkat T cells (18.Jacinto E. Werlen G. Karin M. Immunity. 1998; 8: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), rather our data suggest that in most cells Src kinases are not necessarily involved in, or required for, UV-induced activation of JNK. HeLa cells, in which c-Src has been reported to play an important role in UV signaling, appear to be an exceptional cell line in this respect (16.Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). We however observed that treatment of HeLa cells with the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 did not affect UV-induced activation of JNK (data not shown). It is possible that the observed inhibitory effect of inactive v-Src was due to general toxicity from overexpression of a catalytically inactive Src molecule that is unburdened by intramolecular regulation. Interestingly, NIH3T3 cells lacking the c-Src gene exhibit reduced JNK activation by the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate but have normal UV-induced activation of JNK (46.Liu Z.G. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E.T. Wood L.D. Chen Y. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar).The apparent dispensability for Src kinases in activation of JNK is certainly not unprecedented. Stimulation of the Fas/APO-1/CD95 receptor, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family (47.Oehm A. Behrmann I. Falk W. Pawlita M. Maier G. Klas C. Li-Weber M. Richards S. Dhein J. Trauth B.C. Ponstingl H. Krammer P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10709-10715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), results in JNK activation and apoptosis in a wide variety of cell types (48.Sluss H.K. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8376-8384Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). JNK activation by Fas stimulation is, however, normal in Lck-deficient cells, suggesting that Fas-induced activation of JNK is not Lck-dependent (49.Latinis K.M. Koretzky G.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 871-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TNF-α treatment results in clustering of the ubiquitously expressed p55 TNF-α receptor and subsequent stimulation of JNK in a wide variety of cell types (7.Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 48.Sluss H.K. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell.

Irradiation of cells with UV is also reported to lead to the clustering of TNF-α receptors (52.Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). This clustering may be in fact critical in UV-induced activation of JNK because irradiation with UV at 10 °C, below the transition temperature of cellular membranes, fails to induce both TNF-α receptor clustering and JNK activation (52.Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). The TNF-α receptor-associated death domain protein and TNF-α receptor-associated factor bind to the clustered TNF-α receptors (53.Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V.

UV-induced activation of JNK may be dependent on triggering of the TNF-α receptor and signaling through TNF-α receptor-associated death domain protein and TNF-α receptor-associated factor proteins, whereas Lck and other Src kinases may be involved in activation of JNK only through the pathway downstream of the T-cell receptor and CD28. The c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNK),1 also known as the stress-activated protein kinases, are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (1.Binetruy B. Smeal T. Karin M.

https://openalex.org/W2057687600,"Insulin regulates glucose metabolism in adipocytes via a phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent pathway that appears to involve protein phosphorylation. However, the generation of phosphoinositides is not sufficient for insulin action, and it has been suggested that insulin regulation of glucose metabolism may involve both PI3K-dependent and -independent pathways, the latter being insulin specific. To test this hypothesis, we have designed a phosphoprotein screen to study insulin-specific phosphoproteins that may be either downstream or in parallel to PI3K. Nineteen insulin-regulated phosphospots were detected in the cytosol and high speed pellet fractions, only six of which were significantly regulated by platelet-derived growth factor. Importantly, almost all (92%) of the insulin-specific phosphoproteins identified using this approach were sensitive to the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. Thus, we obtained no evidence for an insulin-specific, PI3K-independent signaling pathway. A large proportion (62%) of the insulin-specific phosphoproteins were enriched in the same high speed pellet fraction to which PI3K was recruited in response to insulin. Thus, our data suggest that insulin specifically stimulates the phosphorylation of a novel subset of downstream targets and this may in part be because of the unique localization of PI3K in response to insulin in adipocytes."
