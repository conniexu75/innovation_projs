https://openalex.org/W2092767025,"Chronic monopolar electrodes were implanted in the region of the midbrain central gray in eight rats. In three rats, continuous 60 cycle-per-second sine-wave stimulation resulted in an electrical analgesia defined by the elimination of responses to aversive stimulation while general motor responsiveness was retained. Exploratory laparotomy was carried out in these animals during continuous brain stimulation without the use of chemical anesthetics. Following surgery, brain stimulation was terminated, and responses to aversive stimuli returned. Electrodes effective in inducing electrical analgesia at the lowest currents were located at the dorsolateral perimeter of the midbrain central gray. It was concluded that focal brain stimulation in this region can induce analgesia in the absence of diffusely applied ""whole brain"" stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1513354202,"Abstract The isolation from the rat ventral prostate of a soluble enzyme preparation producing spermidine, CO2, and methylthioadenosine from putrescine and S-adenosyl-l-methionine is described. This preparation catalyzes limited decarboxylation of S-adenosylmethionine in the absence of any additional reactants but maximal rates of CO2 release from S-adenosylmethionine require the presence of putrescine. When putrescine is present, spermidine and methylthioadenosine are produced in amounts stoichiometric with the CO2 released. The decarboxylation of S-adenosylmethionine in the presence of putrescine is inhibited by isonicotinic acid hydrazide and by 4-bromo-3-hydroxybenzyloxyamine. This finding suggests that pyridoxal phosphate is a cofactor of the reaction. The prostatic enzyme preparation also catalyzes the formation of spermidine from putrescine and exogenous decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (prepared by the action of Escherichia coli S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase). The affinities for S-adenosylmethionine, decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine, and putrescine were measured. The prostatic preparation could not be separated into two enzymic fractions, one catalyzing the decarboxylation of S-adenosylmethionine, and the other catalyzing spermidine synthesis, as is the case with the spermidine-synthesizing system of E. coli. The differences between the prostatic and the bacterial spermidine-synthesizing systems are discussed. Spermine is synthesized by the preparation from the rat ventral prostate in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine and spermidine, but at a considerably slower rate than spermidine synthesis from putrescine and S-adenosylmethionine."
https://openalex.org/W2167326585,"Abstract 1. Steady state kinetics indicates that the binding of substrates by the catalytic subunit of aspartate transcarbamylase is ordered. Product inhibition patterns show that carbamyl phosphate binds first, aspartate binds second, carbamylaspartate dissociates first, and phosphate dissociates second. 2. Nonlinear product inhibition and substrate inhibition indicate that several dead end complexes are formed: aspartate binds to the enzyme-phosphate complex, a 2nd mole of phosphate binds to the enzyme-phosphate complex, a 2nd mole of carbamyl phosphate binds to the enzyme-carbamyl phosphate complex, and carbamylaspartate binds weakly to the free enzyme. 3. The interaction of the catalytic subunit with analogues of both substrates has been studied in an attempt to reveal those structural features of the substrates that are required for binding and function. Acetyl phosphate and N-methylcarbamyl phosphate are the only analogues of carbamyl phosphate tested which are substrates, with maximum velocities at pH 7.8 of 2.4% and 0.03% of the maximum velocity with carbamyl phosphate. Since acetyl phosphate lacks the NH2 group of carbamyl phosphate, this group cannot be essential for function. N,N-Dimethylcarbamyl phosphate is not a substrate, but it is a competitive inhibitor, as is any analogue of carbamyl phosphate with a phosphate or phosphonate dianion, suggesting that at least part of the site for carbamyl phosphate is readily accessible. In fact, with the catalytic subunit, even cytidine triphosphate is a competitive inhibitor. 4. Several dicarboxylic acids were found to be competitive inhibitors of l-aspartate. Succinate and maleate are the strongest inhibitors, malonate and d- and l-malate are good inhibitors, whereas fumarate, glutarate, and d- and l-bromosuccinate are poor inhibitors, and d-aspartate does not inhibit significantly. 5. The pH dependence of the dissociation constant for succinate indicates that a group with pKa 7.1 is required to be positively charged for this inhibitor to bind to the enzyme carbamyl phosphate complex. In contrast, the dissociation constants for carbamyl phosphate and phosphonacetamide vary little between pH 6 and pH 9. 6. Product inhibition by carbamylaspartate when aspartate is varied indicates that the constant for dissociation of aspartate from the central complex is much larger than the dissociation constants for unreactive aspartate analogues such as succinate. This indicates that some of the binding energy of aspartate may be used to facilitate the reaction with carbamyl phosphate. 7. The catalytic subunit is unstable at concentrations below 1 µg per ml. There is an immediate decrease in specific activity with decreasing enzyme concentration and a slower irreversible inactivation during incubation at low concentrations. Both the immediate and the slow losses of activity are prevented by the presence of bovine serum albumin (50 µg per ml) in dilute enzyme solutions. However, because bovine serum albumin forms a complex with the catalytic subunit and alters the apparent kinetic parameters, it was not used in these kinetic studies. 8. At pH 7.8 and 28°, the dissociation constant for carbamyl phosphate is 1.4 x 10-5 m, the Km for aspartate is 0.020 m, and the Vmax is 9.0 x 104 moles per min per 100,000 g of subunit. The dissociation constant for carbamyl phosphate and Km for aspartate vary little between pH 6.4 and pH 8.7, whereas Vmax changes greatly, with an optimum near pH 8. With the use of acetyl phosphate instead of carbamyl phosphate, Km for aspartate is unchanged at pH 7.8, but the dissociation constant for acetyl phosphate is 35-fold higher. With N-methylcarbamyl phosphate, Km for aspartate is 7-fold higher and the dissociation constant for N-methylcarbamyl phosphate is 4-fold higher than for carbamyl phosphate."

In blood from female children with acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria the parasite rate was 2 to 80 times higher in normal than in deficient erythrocytes.

Yet the temporal pattern of four successive sounds (for example, hisses, buzzes, and tones) could not be recognized even when the duration of each sound was considerably longer than either the average phoneme in normal discourse or the notes of melodies. Although each of the stimuli was perceived, their order remained frustratingly elusive."

https://openalex.org/W1549321903,"Abstract The binding of substrates and substrate analogues to the catalytic subunit of aspartate transcarbamylase from Escherichia coli can be detected by difference spectroscopy between 275 and 310 mµ; the chromophores giving rise to these difference spectra are tentatively identified as a tryptophyl residue perturbed by the binding of carbamyl phosphate and a tyrosyl residue perturbed by the binding of l-aspartate. Dissociation constants for several l-aspartate analogues have been determined by difference spectroscopy. When the carbamyl phosphate site is unoccupied, l-aspartate, succinate, l-malate, and d-malate each bind weakly at the l-aspartate site. In the presence of carbamyl phosphate, only succinate and d-malate, the two dicarboxylic acids which lack l-α-substituents, bind tightly to the enzyme. In striking contrast, when carbamyl phosphate is replaced by phosphate, only l-aspartate and l-malate, the two dicarboxylic acids which have l-α-substituents, bind tightly to the enzyme. The magnitudes of the difference spectra for the ternary complexes are substantially greater than the sum of the magnitudes of the binary complexes formed by each analogue individually only when binding of the dicarboxylic acid is enhanced. We suggest, as an explanation for these observations, that the enzyme converts a portion of the electrostatic binding energy of l-aspartate into energy for the mechanical act of forcing the substrates together. A detailed model for the catalytic mechanism is presented, based on the data presented in this and the accompanying papers."
https://openalex.org/W1524534406,"Transfer of an aromatic chromophore from the interior of a protein into the water solvent upon denaturation of the protein produces an absorption change throughout the ultraviolet region, 215 to 320 mµ, approximately 6 times the magnitude of that produced by transfer of the same chromophore from 20% ethylene glycol into water. In the 230 mµ wave length region, the transfer of an indole chromophore produces an absorption change approximately 7 times that produced by the transfer of a phenolic chromophore; the chromophores of the amino acids cystine, histidine, and phenylalanine produce only slight changes in absorption. Difference spectra for protein denaturation were calculated by summation of the 20% ethylene glycol perturbation difference spectra of the amino acids, and multiplication by the factor of 6. Between 215 and 320 mµ, difference spectra produced by acid, autolysis, or urea denaturation closely resemble calculated ones, but are red shifted 2 to 3 mµ near 280 mµ and 4 to 10 mµ near 230 mµ. Thus, the absorption changes observed near 230 mµ for globular proteins result primarily from changes in the environment of the aromatic chromophores indole and phenol. The helix to coil transition and the denaturation-produced solvent perturbation of the amide group must contribute less than 10% of the absorption changes observed near 230 mµ."

Proteolysis of these alkylated proteins by trypsin, α-chymotrypsin, subtilisin, pepsin, and fungal protease was determined by direct measurement of the bonds split, with the use of trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid to determine directly the appearance of new terminal amino groups. The low blank values obtained with N,N-dimethyl proteins has resulted in a greatly increased sensitivity and accuracy not possible with unmodified proteins. On the basis of these studies, an assay of proteolytic activity is described, with N,N-dimethylcasein or N,N-dimethylhemoglobin as substrate, which is from 10 to several hundred times more sensitive than the standard caseinolytic assay of Kunitz."

https://openalex.org/W1544654385,"Abstract Lysozyme was purified from pheasant and quail egg whites by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Each enzyme was shown to be homogeneous by ultracentrifugal, electrophoretic, and immunological criteria. Quail and pheasant lysozymes were similar to chicken lysozyme in specific activity, molecular size, and extinction coefficient. The three enzymes differed from each other in electrophoretic mobility. Quantitative amino acid analysis showed that quail and chicken lysozymes were very similar in composition and that they may differ by only two amino acid interchanges. Pheasant lysozyme, however, differed from the chicken enzyme by possibly seven interchanges. The lysozymes of the three species were reduced and carboxymethylated, treated with trypsin, and subjected to peptide mapping on paper. The peptide maps of the chicken and quail lysozymes were almost indistinguishable. The peptide maps of pheasant lysozyme were, to the contrary, very different from those of the other two species. Immunological experiments with the micro-complement fixation technique were carried out with rabbit antisera directed against quail or pheasant lysozyme. Quail and chicken lysozymes were immunologically almost indistinguishable, while the pheasant enzyme was easily distinguishable from both of them. These immunological results are consistent with those described in a previous publication for antibodies directed against chicken lysozyme. The immunological relationships found among the lysozymes of these three species were unexpected. Indeed, ornithologists agree that, on the basis of nonmolecular evidence, the pheasant is more closely related to the chicken than is the quail. It is therefore especially significant that our chemical findings confirmed the earlier observation that pheasant lysozyme is immunologically less closely related to chicken lysozyme than is quail lysozyme. These data, along with those obtained by other workers on ribonuclease, phage coat protein, hemoglobin, and cytochrome c, support the hypothesis that quantitative complement fixation can be used for predicting the degree of sequence resemblance among naturally occurring proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1520997552,"Abstract The effect of amino acid starvation on phosphate metabolism was examined in an isogenic relaxed and stringent pair of Escherichia coli strains. The entry of Pi into the intracellular pool of orthophosphate was only slightly affected by amino acid starvation while its incorporation into the four ribonucleoside triphosphates, glucose 6-phosphate, and glucose 1-phosphate was found to be subject to stringent control. Incorporation of 32Pi into glucose-6-P continued when RNA synthesis was inhibited by actinomycin D. Thus, the entry of Pi into glucose-6-P is not governed by the rate of RNA accumulation; therefore stringent control must regulate phosphate metabolism more directly. When crude, undialyzed extracts were prepared from amino acid-starved cultures, the endogenous capacity to form glucose-6-P was found to be reduced by the stringent response, and this deficiency could be overcome by addition of an exogenous supply of ATP. These results indicate a general role of the stringent control mechanism in energy metabolism. Presumably stringency of energy metabolism and RNA accumulation share a common mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1513914240,"Abstract Cold osmotic shock treatment of early stationary phase Escherichia coli W cells reduced the capacity for arginine uptake and accumulation by about 25%. DEAE-cellulose chromatography of the shock fluid separated four protein-containing fractions having relatively specific arginine-binding activity. The reduced transport activity of shocked cells was partially restored by two of these purified protein fractions (I and III). The degree of restoration was linear between 5 and 10 µg per ml for Fraction I; above 10 µg per ml there was a marked reduction in the extent of stimulation. For Fraction III restoration of the initial rate (15 sec) was a curvilinear function of the protein concentration from 5 to 40 µg per ml. The degree of restoration of the steady state level of uptake (5 min) hardly changed within this protein concentration range. Fractions I and III have identical dissociation constants for arginine, the values ranging from 0.5 to 1 x 10-6 m. 14C-Arginine was not metabolized by concentrated crude shock protein. The material bound by this protein solution and by purified Fractions I and III was found to have the same Rf value as free arginine. Analysis of the intracellular pool radioactivity after exposure of shocked cells to 14C-arginine and to 14C-arginine plus optimal concentrations of Fractions I and III (in the presence of 4 x 10-3 m amineoxyacetic acid) showed that the bulk of the radioactivity (∼90%) remained in arginine, thereby showing that these proteins stimulate the arginine accumulation process. The proteins are specific in binding and stimulating the transport of arginine. They bound little or no lysine and canavanine and did not stimulate the transport of lysine in shocked cells. These data suggest that cold osmotic shock treatment of E. coli W releases proteins which may participate in the accumulation of arginine by these cells, and that these proteins are not capable of functioning in the accumulation of lysine."

These probably arise by hydrolysis of the initial nucleoside triphosphate from the 5′ terminus of the nascent RNA chains. Logarithmically growing cultures, labeled for 45 seconds with 32P-labeled phosphate, yield about 2000 molecules of labeled tetraphosphate per cell, this yield increasing only slightly with continued labeling. Only the tetraphosphates of adenosine and guanosine have been found in Escherichia coli, and these two are present in approximately equal amounts."
https://openalex.org/W1588049976,"Abstract Exogenously derived arginine is extensively metabolized by early stationary phase cells of Escherichia coli W. This metabolism is substantial even during exposure to the substrate for only 15 sec at room temperature; at 300 sec only about 15% of the intracellular pool radioactivity is found in arginine. The major route of exogenous arginine metabolism is via an amineoxyacetic acid-inhibitable arginine decarboxylase which leads to the production and accumulation of large amounts of agmatine and putrescine. Much smaller amounts of ornithine, citrulline, proline, and glutamate also accumulate intracellularly. Cold osmotic shock treatment of the cells decreases the relative extent of arginine metabolism via the decarboxylase and increases metabolism via the other pathway (pathways). The net result is that proportionately more arginine is found in shocked cell pools than in the corresponding control cells. In the presence of 4 x 10-3 m amineoxyacetic acid the bulk of the pool radioactivity is found in arginine. Thus, under these conditions the pool radioactivity is a measure of arginine transport. Cold osmotic shock treatment reduces the amount of arginine-derived radioactivity associated with the cell in the presence and absence of 4 x 10-1 m amineoxyacetic acid. The shock treatment also reduces the capacity of the cell to transport exogenous lysine and leucine but not proline. In the presence of amineoxyacetic acid, l-lysine is a poor inhibitor of arginine transport, while l-canavanine, which itself is not well accumulated by these cells, is a modest inhibitor. l-Arginine is a good inhibitor of lysine transport while l-canavanine is a modest inhibitor. These data support the thesis that arginine and lysine are not transported by identical systems in this organism. Since lysine previously has been found to inhibit arginine uptake, these observations further support the conclusion that arginine transport cannot be reliably studied in E. coli without utilizing inhibitors such as amineoxyacetic acid which greatly attenuate the extensive metabolism of this amino acid."

Extracts prepared from mutants belonging to the distinct genetic classes, pur F and pur D, were inactive in this assay but were active when mixed together. Further analysis showed that pur F mutants were deficient in the first enzyme, 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate amidotransferase (ribosylamine-5-phosphate:pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase, EC 2.4.2.14), and pur D mutants were apparently deficient in the second enzyme, phosphoribosylglycinamide synthetase (ribosylamine-5-phosphate:glycine ligase, EC 6.3.1.3). The third enzyme, phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase (5′-phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycineamide:tetrahydrofolate 5,10-formyltransferase, EC 2.1.2.2), was present in all mutants, and a genetic deficiency for this enzyme has not been found.

It is active in the synthesis of ATP from ADP in a reaction catalyzed by succinyl coenzyme A synthetase from Escherichia coli (succinate: CoA ligase (ADP); EC 6.2.1.5). With desulfo-CoA present, 1 unit of enzyme catalyzes the conversion of 1 µmole of succinyl phosphate into 0.5 µmole of ATP in 60 min at 37°. Kinetically, the rate of ATP synthesis from succinyl phosphate is one-fifth of that from succinyl-CoA plus inorganic phosphate. Omitting desulfo-CoA lowers the rate of reaction to one-quarter and the conversion to one-half. The reactivity of succinyl-CoA synthetase with 13 other acyl phosphates is reported. Succinyl-CoA is rapidly synthesized from succinyl phosphate and coenzyme A in a nonenzymatic reaction, the rate and extent of which depend on temperature, pH, and concentration of reactants."
https://openalex.org/W1491447680,"Abstract The frequencies of translation of the structural genes for uridine diphosphogalactose 4-epimerase and for galactokinase have been determined in wild type Escherichia coli and found to be equivalent under a variety of conditions. As these structural genes are the terminal cistrons in the galactose operon, it is concluded that polarity is not an inherent characteristic of this operon. The addition of amino acids to the growth medium doubles the growth rate, and hence the sum of all translation frequencies in the cell, but causes little, if any, change in the translation frequency of the galactose operon. This surprising result indicates that the galactose operon belongs to a subset of units of transcription the translation frequency of which is relatively insensitive to changes in the intracellular concentration of amino acids and ribosomes, and suggests that this translation frequency is strictly controlled by the transcription frequency. The model of Morse, Baker, and Yanofsky (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 60, 1428 (1968)), in which each messenger RNA is translated once by a limited cluster of ribosomes following immediately behind the grow point for transcription, allows such a strict control. Test of this model against the existing data on the translation of the galactose operon indicates a remarkably good fit."

https://openalex.org/W1598351536,"Abstract Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from Salmonella typhimurium has been purified to homogeneity. The enzyme shows a concentration-dependent aggregation in ultracentrifugal experiments. Depending upon the age of enzyme preparations the s20w values range between 11.8 to 16.9 at about 2 mg per ml and between 41.6 to 53 at concentrations higher than 5 mg per ml. In dilute solutions the enzyme has a molecular weight of 198,000 as judged by sucrose gradient centrifugations. Enzyme treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate has a molecular weight of 49,200. From amino acid composition the minimal molecular weight is calculated to be 48,980. It is concluded that the native protein is tetrameric and is probably constituted of identical subunits. There are four sulfhydryl groups per molecule of the enzyme which are exposed only on disruption of the quarternary structure of the protein by sodium dodecyl sulfate or urea. Treatment by p-mercuribenzoate results in partial inactivation of the enzyme and in the formation of several protein species with different electrophoretic mobilities. From the pattern of their migration in an electric field it is considered that they represent a series of successive oligomers in which both even and odd aggregates of a basic protomeric unit are represented. The enzyme yields cooperative rate concentration plots with P-enolpyruvate as the variable substrate. This cooperativity disappears in the presence of the activators (acetyl coenzyme A and cytidine diphosphate) of the enzyme but there are large changes in maximal velocity and Michaelis constant of the substrate. Aspartate, an inhibitor of the enzyme, produces noncompetitive inhibition. Neither the activators nor the inhibitor changes the sedimentation velocity of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1541615748,"Abstract A model of thiogalactoside accumulation in Escherichia coli is described and supporting evidence is presented. The model states that thiogalactoside influx and efflux in the absence of energy coupling involves a reversible, carrier-mediated transfer, in which the carrier is the product of the y gene. Energy coupling brings about active transport by dissociating the carrier-thiogalactoside complex in the membrane with liberation of thiogalactoside inside the cell. Thereby a second, essentially irreversible influx path, dependent on cellular metabolism, is predicted. The supporting evidence includes the following. (a) A method was devised to estimate the fraction of membrane carriers loaded with thiogalactoside (thiomethylgalactoside, isopropylthiogalactoside, or thiodigalactoside) in the presence or absence of energy coupling. Energy coupling, which was altered experimentally by three different procedures, consistently decreased the fraction of loaded carriers, in accord with the model. (b) Temperature dependence studies of influx and efflux provided evidence for two influx pathways, one different from the efflux path and dependent on energy coupling, the other similar to the efflux path and independent of metabolism. (c) Studies of counterflow in the influx and efflux directions at various temperatures and the effects thereon of energy coupling were consistent with the existence of two influx paths and one efflux path, as predicted by the model."

https://openalex.org/W1658195138,"Abstract Substitution of Co(II) for the native Zn(II) ions of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase results in an enzymatically active protein with an intense visible absorption spectrum. The major absorption peaks occur at 640 mµ (e = 260), 605 (e = 220), 555 (e = 378), and 510 (e = 335). Spectrophotometric titration of the apoenzyme with Co(II) reveals two cobalt-binding sites per enzyme dimer which contribute equally to the spectrum. Circular dichroic (CD) spectra show most of these bands to be optically active and reveal additional transitions between 300 and 400 mµ associated with the cobalt chromophores. Phosphate produces a large change in the band structure of the visible absorption spectrum and an inversion of the CD spectrum in the region of 550 mµ. One phosphate molecule per enzyme dimer induces the spectral changes. The visible absorption and CD spectra of both the Co(II) enzyme and its phosphate complex were simultaneously fitted with a series of gaussian absorption bands which reveal that all four spectra may be fitted by 9 bands of the same frequency and band width. Phosphate induces no change in band energies, but changes the relative oscillator strengths and induces large negative ellipticity in a previously optically inactive band. Thus it appears that phosphate produces alterations in the immediate dissymmetrical environment of the Co(II) without major changes in coordination geometry. Computer calculation of the visible optical rotatory dispersion from the resolved CD bands generates curves similar to those observed experimentally. Ultraviolet CD measurements show that neither Co(II) nor phosphate produces major changes in the conformation of the molecule. A mutant alkaline phosphatase, that from E. coli U47, does show major changes in the conformation of the metal-binding site and significant changes in the conformation of the peptide backbone."

https://openalex.org/W1542498972,"Abstract Studies of optical rotatory dispersion (ORD) and circular dichroism (CD) are reported on pepsinogen, carbamyl-, and succinylpepsinogen. From the ORD measurements in the wave length range of 600 to 300 mµ as functions of urea, temperature, and pH, it was shown that the macromolecular conformation of the three proteins differs markedly. On replacing the e-NH2 groups of the lysine residues of pepsinogen by non-polar groups (carbamylpepsinogen) or acidic side chains (succinylpepsinogen), the electrostatic side chain interaction between the basic residues and some dicarboxylic acids which stabilizes pepsinogen is abolished. With all three proteins the changes in [η], particularly when measured as function of pH, parallel those of the specific rotation, [α]366. The ORD spectra below 300 mµ show several peaks and troughs. The principal trough of the three proteins in phosphate buffer of pH 7.7 and 0.1 ionic strength is at 227 mµ and is shifted to 230 mµ if the temperature is raised or the pH of the solutions is altered. The positive maximum is at 202 mµ for pepsinogen, at 200 mµ for carbamylpepsinogen, and at 195 mµ for succinylpepsinogen. The ORD spectra above 260 mµ show a trough at 278 mµ, most likely involving the aromatic side chains. These patterns are very different from those characteristic for α-helical structures. The CD spectra of the three proteins at pH 7.7 are characterized by a strong negative band at 212, 205, and 202 mµ for pepsinogen, the carbamyl, and succinyl derivative, respectively. These are displaced to lower wave lengths in the alkaline pH range. The positive CD band of pepsinogen in the phosphate buffer of pH 7.7 is at 193 mµ. Above 250 mµ, dichroic bands were recorded at 255, 264, 278, 292, and 300 mµ. The band at 278 mµ is pH-dependent and was assigned to the aromatic amino acid residues. As the pH is raised above pH 10.0, the band passes through zero and changes sign. ORD spectra have been calculated from the CD data for pepsinogen, carbamyl-, and succinylpepsinogen by the use of a Kronig-Kramers transform with a computer program. Comparison with the observed ORD data shows excellent agreement with the patterns of the observed troughs and peaks. These results are discussed in the light of ORD and CD spectra of known conformations."
https://openalex.org/W1964439359,Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isozyme activities have been followed in 17 human cardiac allografts. A pattern of abnormality associated with cardiac rejection during the first month after operation has been determined: (i) LDH-1 activity is greater than LDH-2 activity; (ii) LDH-1 activity is greater than 35 percent of total LDH activity; and (iii) LDH-1 activity is greater than 100 international units. The LDH-1 abnormality helps to meet the need for an index of cardiac rejection during the early weeks after operation when the electrocardiogram is least reliable.

The leucyl-tRNA synthetase cane charge tRNA from liver or Escherichia coli with leucine-c(14), liver tRNA being a better substrate. The amount of aminoacylation increses linerly with respect to the quantity of tRNA added from either source and is dependent on the amount of enzyme added. The rate of aminoacylation is constant for 10 minutes and then decreases. It is enhanced by polyvinylsulfate. One-tenth millimoler pyrimethamine, hydroxystilbamidine, quinacrine, and acriflavine inhibited the formation of C(14)-valyl-tRNA. Species specificity between tRNA and its charging enzyme with respect to the recognition site is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1491191047,"Abstract Protein obtained from human erythrocytes, some rat tissues, bakers' yeast, and Escherichia coli was incubated for 15 sec with 5 µm AT32P and then inactivated by alkali. Excess AT32P was removed by chromatography on Sephadex G-50. In all cases the protein was shown to bind 32P-phosphate with acid-labile linkages. When the inactivated 32P-labeled protein was chromatographed on Sephadex G-200, two radioactive peaks (Peaks I and II) were generally obtained. On alkaline hydrolysis and paper electrophoresis of material from Peak I, 3-32P-phosphohistidine was shown to be the main labeled degradation product in all cases but that of bakers' yeast. An alkaline hydrolysate of material of Peak II from rat liver was previously shown to contain 1-32P-phosphohistidine, 3-32P-phosphohistidine, and N-e-32P-phospholysine. However, the main part of the radioactivity of the hydrolysate was obtained as two unidentified fractions (probably N-phosphopeptides). The same degradation products were recently recovered from AT32P-incubated bovine liver and erythrocytic nucleoside diphosphate kinase. It is shown in this paper that alkaline hydrolysates of material of Peak II from all mammalian tissues investigated contained these degradation products, as judged by paper electrophoresis. Therefore, since Peak II was eluted in the same position in all chromatograms, it seems probable that Peak II from the mammalian tissues represents phosphorylated nucleoside diphosphate kinase. On alkaline hydrolysis of material of Peak II from bakers' yeast and E. coli, 1-32P-phosphohistidine was present as the main phosphorylated component. It is suggested that Peak II of these microbial sources may represent a nucleoside diphosphate kinase with a structure at the active site different from that of mammalian origin."
https://openalex.org/W1605696825,"Abstract Amino acids are found tightly bound to DNA isolated from several strains of Escherichia coli. The amount bound was a function of growth conditions; it varied with changes in the composition of the medium and with the phases of the growth cycle. In DNA extracted from the earliest growth phases an unusual amino acid was found which was eluted from a Stein-Moore column with the aromatic amino acids. This odd substance was not found in the cell protein hydrolysates and appeared to be the same compound previously found in several primary tumors. In one instance, DNA and protein were extracted from cells which had been incubated with labeled amino acids under conditions which permitted protein but not DNA synthesis. The protein was highly labeled, but the amino acids associated with the DNA were not. The amino acids were not dissociated from the DNA by banding in cesium chloride or by passage through molecular exclusion gels in 5 m urea. These data have been interpreted as suggesting a functional role for DNA-associated amino acids."

https://openalex.org/W2023751448,Since 1958 drug toxicology had been regulated by unofficial rules introduced by J. Lehman then chief of the Pharmacology Division Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as flexible guidelines. The FDA has held to these rules and created an unofficial widely accepted procedure for animal toxicity testing. A complete program for one drug may cost $100000. Findings are kept confidential between the FDA and the pharmaceutical companies. Of major concern is the safety of humans involved in clinical trials. Despite all our toxicologic testing man is still a victim to individual drug idiosyncracies potential mutagens drug-induced chromosomal damage and long-term effects of enzyme inhibition. Large scale collaborative investigation is indicated with oral contraceptives and the direct effect on the physical and mental health of women and their children. Most important is the recognition of drug toxicology as a living science and not an administrative procedure.

https://openalex.org/W1537617180,"Abstract RNA complementary to bacteriophage R17 RNA, isolated from bacteria infected with the virus, failed to stimulate protein synthesis in cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli. Under conditions optimal for protein synthesis under the direction of R17 viral RNA, the incorporation of amino acids into peptide linkage in the presence of complementary strand RNA was the same as the incorporation in the absence of added RNA, and the products formed were indistinguishable from the endogenous products. With several preparations of complementary strand RNA a small amount of amino acid incorporation was observed, but it correlated with the degree of contamination by viral RNA. Furthermore, peptide mapping of the material formed revealed that viral coat protein was the major product. The lack of messenger activity of the complementary strand can be explained by the fact that it failed to bind to ribosomes. Although incapable of associating with ribosomes and of initiating protein synthesis on its own, complementary strand RNA enhanced the incorporation of amino acids directed by viral RNA. This stimulatory effect of complementary strand RNA is not understood. We have shown, however, that the complementary strand RNA became partially resistant to RNase after incubation with the viral RNA in the E. coli extracts, and that it associated with ribosomes if the viral RNA was present. The effects of complementary strand RNA on the messenger activity of R17 viral RNA and the increased protection against RNase degradation suggest, but do not prove, that an association of the two strands takes place under the incubation conditions for cell-free protein synthesis."
