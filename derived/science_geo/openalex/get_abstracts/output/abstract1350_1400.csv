https://openalex.org/W2056971358,"Four agents known to increase the level of cellular cAMP by different means (cholera toxin, dibutyryl cAMP, methyl isobutyl xanthine and isoproterenol) increase the growth of colonies of cultured human epidermal cells and of keratinocytes derived from other stratified squamous epithelia. This effect is due to an increase in the overall rate of cell proliferation in the colonies. When added to cultures under hitherto optimum conditions for epidermal cell growth [in the presence of supporting 3T3 cells and epidermal growth factor (EGF)], most of the agents exert an effect of considerable magnitude, the toxin being the most potent. Since the toxin exerts an effect in the absence of supporting 3T3 cells, it must be able to act directly on the keratinocytes. It can also act in the absence of EGF and of medium conditioned by 3T3 cells, although proliferation is greatest when supporting 3T3 cells and EGF are present. The increased proliferation in the presence of the toxin is associated with an increased proportion of small cells known to include the multiplying fraction. The use of the toxin makes the cultivation of keratinocytes from epidermis and other stratified squamous epithelia much easier and prolongs the culture life of the cells. Whether cell proliferation in the intact epidermis is regulated through agents affecting cAMP (in a direction opposite to that suggested by much of the earlier literature) remains to be elucidated, but the existence of such a mechanism is cultured cells suggests that it may function in the intact epithelium."

Both types of carbohydrate chains have been studied by sugar and methylation analysis before and after removal of Wacetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc) residues. The iV-glycosidically linked carbohydrate chains have been further analyzed by Smith degradation, trifluoroacetolytic degradation, and degradation after chromium trioxide oxi- dation. As a result of these studies, the following structures for the carbohydrate chains of fetuin are proposed:"
https://openalex.org/W2077063179,"Immunoreactive β-endorphin was measured in the ventricular fluid of six patients with chronic pain. Stimulation of the periaqueductal gray matter in three patients with pain of peripheral origin resulted in significant increases (50 to 300 percent) in the concentration of ventricular immunoreactive β-endorphin. In three other patients suffering deafferentation dysesthesia, stimulation of the posterior limb of the internal capsule did not alter the concentration of this peptide. These results provide evidence of the release of human immunoreactive β-endorphin in vivo and suggest that naloxone-reversible pain relief achieved by stimulation of the periaqueductal gray matter may be in part mediated by the activation of β-endorphin-rich diencephalic areas."

https://openalex.org/W1486835939,"The complete structure of the complex oligosaccharides of fetuin has been established. The three fractions of complex oligosaccharide which were isolated by ion exchange chromatography following pronase digestion (F-I, F-II, and F-III) had identical molar ratios of sialic acid (Sia), galactose, mannose, and N-acetylglucosamine of 3:3:3:5. A combination of methylation analyses, Smith periodate degradations, and endoglycosidase and exoglycosidase digestions were utilized to establish the structure which is proposed to be: (see article of journal). Features of this structure not previously established include the presence of 2 residues of alpha2,3- and 1 residue of alpha2,6-linked sialic acid and their location relative to the mannose branch points. Also unusual is the presence of an alpha-linked branch mannose with substituents at positions 2 and 4 which is in turn linked to position 6 of the beta-linked, branch mannose. These features result in unexpected resistance to specific exoglycosidases."

https://openalex.org/W2049214213,"The longest DNA molecules synthesized by endogenous reverse transcription in detergent-permeabilized Moloney murine sarcoma virus (Mo-MSV) virions (clone G8-124) are double-stranded DNA molecules of 5.8 kilobase pairs (kbp). This DNA species has been purified by sedimentation of total in vitro synthesized Mo-MSV DNA through neutral sucrose gradients. A physical map of the positions of the cleavage sites for a series of restriction endonucleases has been derived for this 5.8 kbp DNA. Mo-MSV DNA synthesized in vitro was found to induce morphological transformation of NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts upon transfection. The foci had a morphology indistinguishable from that of Mo-MSV-induced foci, and the induced transformed phenotype was stable. The 5.8 kbp double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) purified by agarose gel electrophoresis also induced focal transformation. Furthermore, gel-purified, restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of 5.8 kbp dsDNA containing the region from 2.8–4.9 kbp on the physical map of Mo-MSV DNA were able to induce foci. In contrast, endonuclease-generated DNA fragments lacking this region on the map were unable to transform cells upon transfection. When transformants derived by transfection with 5.8 kbp dsDNA were infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) helper virus, Mo-MSV was rescued from a small portion of these cells, suggesting the establishment of the complete viral genome in these cells. One Mo-MSV DNA fragment, spanning 2.8–4.9 kbp on the physical map, was generated by cleavage of 5.8 kbp DNA with endonucleases Hind III + Sal I and currently represents our maximum estimate for the size of the transforming region of the Mo-MSV genome. This fragment includes the Mo-MSV sequences which are found in the DNA of uninfected mouse cells."

https://openalex.org/W1992726195,"We have isolated a nonconditional mutant of PR-RSV-E with unique properties. This virus (SE 21Q1b) is shed from a continuously growing culture of transformed quail cells. 21Q1b virions are unable to transform or replicate in other quail or chicken cells after exogenous infection, despite the fact that the viral particles contain normal envelope glycoproteins, internal structural proteins and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. The lack of infectivity of 21Q1b virions is a consequence of the failure to package genomic 39S RNA. Instead, these virions contain a mixture of heterogenous-sized polyadenylated cellular RNAs and 4S RNA. Less than 1% of the encapsulated RNA is viral-specific, although in the 21Q1b-producing cells, amounts of 39S, 28S and 21S viral RNAs comparable to those in wild-type virus-infected cells are synthesized and function as mRNAs for the viral proteins. Thus 21Q1b can be considered an RNA packaging mutant. Superinfection of 21Q1b cells with either RAV-1 or PR-A leads to production of about 10% or more of the normal titer of superinfecting virus, but none of the 21Q1b genetic markers are rescued. After superinfection, the 21Q1b cells continue to synthesize 21Q1b particles containing cellular RNAs in the same amounts as before infection. Thus superinfection does not appear to ""switch off"" the aberrant packaging of cellular RNA, but allows packaging of the superinfecting RNA. One explanation for the phenotype of 21Q1b is that the genome is lacking a signal necessary for efficient genomic RNA packaging (but not for translation) and that the 21Q1b genome encodes a ""packaging factor"" with an altered specificity so that cellular RNAs are efficiently packaged. 21Q1b virions do contain RNA-dependent DNA polymerase which has normal endogenous synthetic activity. The cDNA product made in vitro from detergent-lysed 21Q1b virions hybridizes equally well to uninfected quail and 21Q1b-producing quail cell RNAs, with kinetics suggesting that the endogenous product consists of transcripts of cellular RNAs present in low amounts in the cells."

https://openalex.org/W1529047029,"Highly purified preparations of RNA-directed DNA polymerase from avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) contain a Mn2+-activated endonuclease activity capable of nicking supercoiled DNA. This endonuclease activity co-sediments in glycerol gradients with the alphabeta form of AMV DNA polymerase, and co-chromatographs with DNA polymerase activity on DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, and heparin-Sepharose. It is also present in AMV alphabeta-DNA polymerase purified by electrophoresis through nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and subsequently chromatographed on poly(C)-agarose. alphabeta-associated endonuclease is co-immunoprecipitated with DNA polymerase activity by antiserum directed against alphabeta holoenzyme. The alpha form of AMV DNA polymerase lacks this activity. In its enzymatic properties, alphabeta-associated endonuclease resembles the endodeoxyribonuclease activity associated with the AMV p32 protein, which has been shown to be structurally related to the beta (but not the alpha) subunit of AMV DNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1572652901,"The increased capability of the liver to extract glucogenic substrates during fasting was investigated at. the cellular level by measuring the transport of neutral amino acids in hepatocytes freshly isolated from fed and 4%h-fasted rats. The uptake of 2-a-amino[l-14C]isobutyric acid, a nonmetabolizable analog of alanine, was markedly increased in hepatocytes from fasting rats when measured at 0.1 mu. At the plateau a distribution ratio of 30 to 40 was achieved, compared to 10 in hepatocytes from fed rats. This marked increase was not observed when uptake was measured at 50 mM. Analysis of the relationship between influx and substrate concentration revealed that two independent saturable components contributed to entry of a-aminoisobutyric acid in hepatocytes from fasting rats: 1) a low affinity component (Km E 50 to 70 mM) similar to that observed in cells from fed animals; 2) a high affinity component (K,,, E 0.6 to 0.8 mM) not observed in cells from fed rats. The transport of a-aminoisobutyric acid occurring through the high affinity component was dependent on Na+, and could be completely inhibited by a-(methylamino)isobutyric acid (Ki z 0.6 mM), the specific substrate for the “A” (alanine preferring) transport system. Ouabain, valinomycin, and gramicidin D partly inhibited cy-aminoisobutyric acid transport occurring through this high affinity component. Puromycin and cycloheximide administered in vivo prevented the emergence of the high affinity transport component induced by fasting. We conclude that the increase in amino acid active transport in hepatocytes from fasting rats results from the emergence of a high affinity transport component which has the properties of a pure “A” system. This system endows the hepatocyte with a high power for concentrating amino acids at low ambient levels, and thus may play an important role in the regulation of gluconeogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1546152265,"Using inside-out vesicles of human red cell membranes, the side-specific effects of Na+ on phosphorylation of (Na,K)-ATPase have been studied using low concentrations of [gamma-32P]ATP (less than or equal to 0.1 microM). Phosphorylation is stimulated by Na+ at the cytoplasmic membrane surface (extravesicular Na+) alone and not by Na+ at the external surface (intravesicular Na+). At 37 degrees C, external Na+ (less than or equal to 10 mM) does, however, increase the steady state level (approximately 2 1/2-fold) of phosphoenzyme above that observed with cytoplasmic Na+ alone; hydrolysis is increased to only a small extent. Little stimulation by external Na+ is observed at 0 degrees C. As Na+ at the cytoplasmic side is decreased to very low levels (less than or equal to 0.2 mM) several kinetic changes are observed: (i) the apparent turnover of phosphoenzyme (ratio Na+-ATP-ase/phosphoenzyme level) is markedly increased (approximately 3-fold, (ii) Rbext sensitivity (inhibition of (Na)-ATPase at low ATP levels) is reduced, and (iii) the ratio of Na+ ions transported per molecule of ATP hydrolyzed is decreased. These results are compatible with a reaction pathway involving a transition from one form of phosphoenzyme, E1-P, to another, E2-P of which the hydrolysis is decreased by moderate levels of external Na+. It is suggested also that an alternate reaction pathway for Na+-ATPase occurs at very low cytoplasmic Na+, one via hydrolysis of E1-P and not associated with Na+ translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2004764062,"We have examined viral and poly(rl):poly(rC) induction of interferon synthesis in several human, mouse and Chinese hamster cell lines, and in hybrids derived from the fusion of such cells. We observed species and cell-type differences in inducer effectiveness and in the kinetics of interferon production. In some cases, parental characteristics are preserved in somatic cell hybrids, and in other cases, the expression of the donor phenotype is modulated by the epigenetic state of the recipient cell. Mapping studies in human/mouse and human/Chinese hamster hybrids indicate that there are at least two structural genes for human fibroblast interferon. Chromosomes 2 and 5 each contain genetic information for the synthesis of fibroblast interferon. Gene dosage experiments indicate that one gene is on the long arm of chromosome 2 and another is on the short arm of chromosome 5. Leukocyte interferon genes could not be mapped to these chromosomes, but this negative result could be influenced by the epigenetic state of the hybrid cells."

The assay detects insulin binding sites at concentrations as low as 0.1 nanomolar; distinguishes between receptors originating from human placental membranes, human lymphoblastoid cells, and mouse liver membranes; and measures the receptor independently of its binding function. Down-regulation, or loss of binding after exposure to insulin, is associated with loss of immunoreactive receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1933123628,"The specific interactions between the RNA-directed DNA polymerase of avian oncornavirus and the tRNATrp primer required for initiation of viral DNA synthesis in vitro were examined. Two distinct interactions, stable binding of the tRNATrp to the enzyme and initiation of viral DNA synthesis by the enzyme with tRNATrp as primer, were characterized as to the structure of tRNATrp required. Different structural features of the tRNATrp were shown to be necessary for each type of interaction. The entire primary structure and native conformation of tRNATrp are both required for binding to reverse transcriptase. Fragments of tRNATrp and intact tRNATrp in an altered conformation cannot be bound by the enzyme using an assay which detects high affinity binding between reverse transcriptase and native tRNATrp. In contrast, fragments of the tRNATrp molecule can serve as primers for viral DNA synthesis with normal efficiency as compared to intact tRNATrp. The fragments which initiate transcription must contain a minimum specific nucleotide sequence which extends from the 3' terminus of the tRNATrp through 27 residues of the molecule. This portion of the tRNATrp may be a major structural determinant of specificity in initiation."

https://openalex.org/W1987160424,"Mouse myeloid leukemic cells which differ in their competence to be induced to differentiate by the normal macrophage- and granulocyte-inducing protein MGI have been used to study the relationship between type C RNA virus production and myeloid cell differentiation. Clones which can be induced by MGI to form Fc and C3 rosettes, to synthesize and secrete lysozyme and to differentiate to mature macrophages and granulocytes (MGI+D+) were induced by MGI to produce higher amounts of type C virus. Clones (MGI+D-) that were less inducible by MGI for Fc and C3 rosettes and lysozyme and were not induced to from mature cells were also less inducible higher virus production. In both types of clones, the increased virus production induced by MGI preceded the induction of rosettes and lysozyme. Clones that were not induced by MGI for rosettes or lysozyme (MGI-D-) showed little or no enhancement of virus production. MGI did not affect virus production in erythroleukemic cells, and erythropoietin did not affect virus production in the myeloid leukemic cells. Dexamethasone, lipopolysaccharide, dimethylsulfoxide and low concentrations of actinomycin D can induce some differentiation-associated properties in some of the clones. With these compounds, there was also a direct relationship between the enhancement of virus production and induction of differentiation-associated properties. Virus released from the three types of clones before or after treatment with MGI or dexamethasone was identified as N-tropic. The enhancement of virus production, as measured by reverse transcriptase activity, was accompanied by an increase in the amount of the viral protein p30, and interferon, which idd not inhibit the induction of differentiation in the myeloid leukemic cells, also did not prevent the increase in the amount of p30. After the early enhancement of virus production associated with the induction of differentiation, a shut-off of virus production occurred in the mature cells induced by MGI in MGI+D+ clones, whereas clones that did not differentiate to mature cells continued to produce virus. The results indicate that enhancement of virus production appears to be an early step in the induction of differentiation. Once induction has occurred, the lack of virus production in the mature cells suggest that a subsequent shut-off of virus production may be required for the completion of differentiation to mature cells. This relationship between cell differentiation and virus production suggests that type C virus has a regulatory role in myeloid cell differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W70217393,"In addition to their Fc oligosaccharides, some immunoglobulin molecules have oligosaccharides linked to variable segments of H or L chains. These Fab oligosaccharides are potential determinants of antibody specificity. This possibility was considered in a study of the IgG antiglobulin from a patient with IgG-IgG complexes. F(ab‘)2 fragments of the antiglobulin retained the ability to form complexes with normal IgG as detected by analytical ultracentrifugation. Removal of F(ab‘)2 sialic acids by neuraminidase abolished complex formation. Recombination experiments further localized antiglobulin activity to the L chains. Antiglobulin activity of the recombinant molecules was shown by analytical ultracentrifugation and by column chromatography with molecules containing 125I-labeled L chains. L chains from the subject's IgG were enriched in sialic acids. Thus, a sialic acid-containing oligosaccharide on the L chain of this antiglobulin is required for its binding action."
https://openalex.org/W1564444899,"Abstract omicron-Phenanthroline, a zinc chelating agent, is known to inhibit the DNA polymerase activity of cellular DNA-dependent and viral RNA-dependent DNA polymerases. We find that omicron-phenanthroline does not inhibit the reverse transcriptase-associated RNase H activity of retroviruses. Kinetic studies, using DNA template-primers as an inhibitor of RNase H, suggest that zinc does not play any role in template-primer binding by reverse transcriptase. These results also indicate a distinct binding site for the template and triphosphate substrates. Cellular RNase H from calf thymus and RNase H-II from Rauscher leukemia virus are likewise resistant to omicron-phenanthroline inhibition, implying non-involvement of zinc in the nucleic acid hydrolysis by these enzymes."

All proteins, except for gp85, have been purified by use of column chromatography procedures to apparent homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and isoelectric focusing. A new isolation procedure for p12 by affinity column chromatography takes advantage of its nucleic acid binding properties. The recovery of nondenatured viral structural proteins is demonstrated by the proteolytic activity revealed by p15. The purified proteins were used for the production of monospecific antibodies. The 70 S RNA served as source for the isolation of 35 S RNA subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1596174406,"We have examined the characteristics of the adenylate cyclase system from control and butyrate-treated cells. Butyrate treatment results in both an increased number of catecholamine receptors and an induction of a response to the hormone, as reported previously (Tallman, J.F., Smith, C.C., and Henneberry, R.C. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 74, 873-877); in addition, we found that the same treatment reduces the degree of activation of adenylate cyclase by GTP. We have demonstrated in two cell types that this decrease in GTP activation is inversely related to the degree of induction of the hormone response. Furthermore, in plasma membranes isolated from butyrate-treated cells, the hormone receptor is sensitive to GTP; i.e. GTP reduces the affinity of isoproterenol for the receptor. We propose that these changes reflect an interaction between the beta-adrenergic receptor and the nucleotide regulatory component and that this interaction represents, at least in part, the process of coupling. Several possible mechanisms which can account for the change in GTP activation are discussed in terms of our current understanding of the regulation of the adenylate cyclase system."

The TMG was accumulated in a chemically unmodified form, and cell extracts failed to catalyze either ATP or P-enolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of TMG. At pH 8.5, the lactose-grown cells exhibited a transmembrane proton gradient (deltapH) of 1.38 units, interior acid, and a transmembrane electrical potential (delta psi) of -132 mV. Accordingly, the total protonmotive force at this pH was very low, -51mV. Several lines of evidence indicate that the protonmotive force or delta psi did not directly energize TMG transport but, rather, that ATP was directly required: (a) in cells treated with arsenate so that the delta psi was unaffected and cellular ATP levels were markedly lowered, TMG transport was inhibited in proportion to the reduction of cellular ATP, while electrogenic alpha-aminoisobutyric acid transport was not; (b) when a valinomycin-induced potassium diffusion potential was established in starved cells, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid transport, but not TMG transport, was stimulated; and (c) in a series of experiments in which the delta psi was rapidly abolished by treatment with gramicidin, ATP levels declined slowly and the rate of TMG transport correlated directly with ATP levels rather than with the delta psi. Consumption of cellular ATP concomitant with TMG transport could be demonstrated."

None of the derivatives was capable of activating concanavalin A-induced histamine secretion at concentrations two to three times that required for maximal activation by phosphatidylserine. Instead, the derivatives were found to inhibit the secretory response of mast cells to the calcium ionophore A23187 as well as to concanavalin A.
