https://openalex.org/W2615301036,"Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint receptor that is upregulated on activated T cells for the induction of immune tolerance. Tumour cells frequently overexpress the ligand for PD-1, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), facilitating their escape from the immune system. Monoclonal antibodies that block the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1, by binding to either the ligand or receptor, have shown notable clinical efficacy in patients with a variety of cancers, including melanoma, colorectal cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Although it is well established that PD-1-PD-L1 blockade activates T cells, little is known about the role that this pathway may have in tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs). Here we show that both mouse and human TAMs express PD-1. TAM PD-1 expression increases over time in mouse models of cancer and with increasing disease stage in primary human cancers. TAM PD-1 expression correlates negatively with phagocytic potency against tumour cells, and blockade of PD-1-PD-L1 in vivo increases macrophage phagocytosis, reduces tumour growth and lengthens the survival of mice in mouse models of cancer in a macrophage-dependent fashion. This suggests that PD-1-PD-L1 therapies may also function through a direct effect on macrophages, with substantial implications for the treatment of cancer with these agents."

Here, to yield functional human haematopoietic stem cells, we perform morphogen-directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into haemogenic endothelium followed by screening of 26 candidate haematopoietic stem-cell-specifying transcription factors for their capacity to promote multi-lineage haematopoietic engraftment in mouse hosts. We recover seven transcription factors (ERG, HOXA5, HOXA9, HOXA10, LCOR, RUNX1 and SPI1) that are sufficient to convert haemogenic endothelium into haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that engraft myeloid, B and T cells in primary and secondary mouse recipients. Our combined approach of morphogen-driven differentiation and transcription-factor-mediated cell fate conversion produces haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from pluripotent stem cells and holds promise for modelling haematopoietic disease in humanized mice and for therapeutic strategies in genetic blood disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2615916773,"Developmental pathways that orchestrate the fleeting transition of endothelial cells into haematopoietic stem cells remain undefined. Here we demonstrate a tractable approach for fully reprogramming adult mouse endothelial cells to haematopoietic stem cells (rEC-HSCs) through transient expression of the transcription-factor-encoding genes Fosb, Gfi1, Runx1, and Spi1 (collectively denoted hereafter as FGRS) and vascular-niche-derived angiocrine factors. The induction phase (days 0-8) of conversion is initiated by expression of FGRS in mature endothelial cells, which results in endogenous Runx1 expression. During the specification phase (days 8-20), RUNX1+ FGRS-transduced endothelial cells commit to a haematopoietic fate, yielding rEC-HSCs that no longer require FGRS expression. The vascular niche drives a robust self-renewal and expansion phase of rEC-HSCs (days 20-28). rEC-HSCs have a transcriptome and long-term self-renewal capacity similar to those of adult haematopoietic stem cells, and can be used for clonal engraftment and serial primary and secondary multi-lineage reconstitution, including antigen-dependent adaptive immune function. Inhibition of TGFβ and CXCR7 or activation of BMP and CXCR4 signalling enhanced generation of rEC-HSCs. Pluripotency-independent conversion of endothelial cells into autologous authentic engraftable haematopoietic stem cells could aid treatment of haematological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2615522645,"Over the two last decades Bangladesh, a low-income country, has experienced a rapid demographic and epidemiological transition. The population has increased substantially with rapid urbanization and changing pattern of disease, which at least in part, can be explained by nutritional changes. However, the nutritional status of the adult population has not been previously described. Hence, the objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence and explore socio-demographic determinants of underweight, overweight and obesity among the Bangladeshi adult population.This study is a secondary data analysis of the national 2011 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey. We determined the nutritional status of adults aged ≥35 years of age, who had a measured weight and height, using the Asian body mass index (BMI) cut-offs for underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m2), overweight (BMI 23 to <27.5 kg/m2) and obesity (BMI ≥27.5 kg/m2). Logistic regression modeling was used to determine the association between socio-demographic factors and nutritional status.Of total sample (n = 5495), 30.4% were underweight, 18.9% were overweight and 4.6% were obese. Underweight was associated with age, education and wealth. The adjusted odd ratios for underweight were higher for older people (≥70 years) compared to younger, the least educated compared to the most educated and the poorest compared to the wealthiest were 2.51 (95%CI: 1.95-3.23, p<0.001), 3.59 (95%CI: 2.30-5.61, p<0.001) and 3.70 (95%CI: 2.76-4.96, p<0.001), respectively. Younger age (35-44 years), being female, higher education, wealthier and living in urban areas were associated with overweight/obesity with adjusted odds ratios of 1.73 (95%CI: 1.24-2.41, p<0.001), 2.48 (95%CI: 1.87-3.28, p<0.001), 3.98 (95%CI: 2.96-5.33, p<0.001), 7.14 (95%CI: 5.20-9.81, p<0.001) 1.27 (95%CI: 1.05-1.55, p-0.02), respectively.Underweight and overweight/obesity are prevalent in Bangladeshi adults. Both conditions are associated with increased morbidity and mortality and increase the risk of developing non-communicable diseases. Effective public health intervention approaches are necessary to address both these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2615453838,"Extreme temperatures and fluid pressures are measured, and their causes modelled, in a borehole into the Alpine Fault, where an earthquake rupture is expected within the next few decades. Rock deformation at geologic faults is affected by changes in temperature and in the pressure exerted by fluids within the pores of the rocks. Earthquakes occur when variations in these conditions lead to destabilization of mineral phases in Earth's crust, so understanding how this 'tipping point' is reached is important for forecasting earthquakes. Rupert Sutherland et al. report findings from a borehole drilled into the upper part of the Alpine Fault of southern New Zealand. This fault is thought to be late in its cycle of stress accumulation and is therefore expected to rupture in a magnitude 8 earthquake in the coming decades. The authors observed a pore fluid pressure gradient that is well above hydrostatic levels, meaning greater pressure on the surrounding rock, and a high geothermal gradient within the 'hanging wall' of the fault. They conclude that these extreme conditions result from rapid fault movement, which transports rock and heat upwards from deep below the surface, and topographically driven fluid movement that concentrates heat into valleys at the surface. Temperature and fluid pressure conditions control rock deformation and mineralization on geological faults, and hence the distribution of earthquakes1. Typical intraplate continental crust has hydrostatic fluid pressure and a near-surface thermal gradient of 31 ± 15 degrees Celsius per kilometre2,3. At temperatures above 300–450 degrees Celsius, usually found at depths greater than 10–15 kilometres, the intra-crystalline plasticity of quartz and feldspar relieves stress by aseismic creep and earthquakes are infrequent. Hydrothermal conditions control the stability of mineral phases and hence frictional–mechanical processes associated with earthquake rupture cycles, but there are few temperature and fluid pressure data from active plate-bounding faults. Here we report results from a borehole drilled into the upper part of the Alpine Fault, which is late in its cycle of stress accumulation and expected to rupture in a magnitude 8 earthquake in the coming decades4,5. The borehole (depth 893 metres) revealed a pore fluid pressure gradient exceeding 9 ± 1 per cent above hydrostatic levels and an average geothermal gradient of 125 ± 55 degrees Celsius per kilometre within the hanging wall of the fault. These extreme hydrothermal conditions result from rapid fault movement, which transports rock and heat from depth, and topographically driven fluid movement that concentrates heat into valleys. Shear heating may occur within the fault but is not required to explain our observations. Our data and models show that highly anomalous fluid pressure and temperature gradients in the upper part of the seismogenic zone can be created by positive feedbacks between processes of fault slip, rock fracturing and alteration, and landscape development at plate-bounding faults."
https://openalex.org/W2615529731,"Developmental biology has been continually shaped by technological advances, evolving from a descriptive science into one immersed in molecular and cellular mechanisms. Most recently, genome sequencing and 'omics' profiling have provided developmental biologists with a wealth of genetic and biochemical information; however, fully translating this knowledge into functional understanding will require new experimental capabilities. Photoactivatable probes have emerged as particularly valuable tools for investigating developmental mechanisms, as they can enable rapid, specific manipulations of DNA, RNA, proteins, and cells with spatiotemporal precision. In this Perspective, we describe optochemical and optogenetic systems that have been applied in multicellular organisms, insights gained through the use of these probes, and their current limitations. We also suggest how chemical biologists can expand the reach of photoactivatable technologies and bring new depth to our understanding of organismal development."
https://openalex.org/W2616838709,"The combination of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that predictors of OSA among patients with COPD may be distinct from OSA in the general population. Therefore, we investigated associations between traditional OSA risk factors (e.g. age), and sleep questionnaires [e.g. Epworth Sleepiness Scale] in 44 patients with advanced COPD. As a second aim we proposed a pilot, simplified screening test for OSA in patients with COPD. In a prospective, observational study of patients enrolled in the UCSD Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program we collected baseline characteristics, cardiovascular events (e.g. atrial fibrillation), and sleep questionnaires [e.g. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)]. For the pilot questionnaire, a BMI ≥25 kg/m2 and the presence of cardiovascular disease were used to construct the pilot screening test. Male: 59%; OSA 66%. FEV1 (mean ± SD) = 41.0±18.2% pred., FEV1/FVC = 41.5±12.7%]. Male gender, older age, and large neck circumference were not associated with OSA. Also, Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the STOP-Bang questionnaire were not associated with OSA in univariate logistic regression. In contrast, BMI ≥25 kg/m2 (OR = 3.94, p = 0.04) and diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (OR = 5.06, p = 0.03) were significantly associated with OSA [area under curve (AUC) = 0.74]. The pilot COPD-OSA test (OR = 5.28, p = 0.05) and STOP-Bang questionnaire (OR = 5.13, p = 0.03) were both associated with OSA in Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis. The COPD-OSA test had the best AUC (0.74), sensitivity (92%), and specificity (83%). A ten-fold cross-validation validated our results. We found that traditional OSA predictors (e.g. gender, Epworth score) did not perform well in patients with more advanced COPD. Our pilot test may be an easy to implement instrument to screen for OSA. However, a larger validation study is necessary before further clinical implementation is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2615137697,"A number of studies have used global positioning systems (GPS) to report on positional differences in the physical game demands of rugby union both on an average and singular bout basis. However, the ability of these studies to report quantitative data is limited by a lack of validation of certain aspects of measurement by GPS micro-technology. Furthermore no study has analyzed the positional physical demands of the longest bouts of ball-in-play time in rugby union. The aim of the present study is to compare the demands of the single longest period of ball-in-play, termed “worst case scenario” (WCS) between positional groups, which have previously been reported to have distinguishable game demands. The results of this study indicate that WCS periods follow a similar sporadic pattern as average demands but are played at a far higher pace than previously reported for average game demands with average meters per minute of 116.8 m. The positional differences in running and collision activity previously reported are perpetuated within WCS periods. Backs covered greater total distances than forwards (318 m vs 289 m), carried out more high-speed running (11.1 m·min-1 vs 5.5 m·min-1) and achieved higher maximum velocities (MaxVel). Outside Backs achieved the highest MaxVel values (6.84 m·sec-1). Tight Five and Back Row forwards underwent significantly more collisions than Inside Back and Outside Backs (0.73 & 0.89 collisions·min-1 vs 0.28 & 0.41 collisions·min-1 respectively). The results of the present study provide information on the positional physical requirements of performance in prolonged periods involving multiple high intensity bursts of effort. Although the current state of GPS micro-technology as a measurement tool does not permit reporting of collision intensity or acceleration data, the combined use of video and GPS provides valuable information to the practitioner. This can be used to match and replicate game demands in training."
https://openalex.org/W2615726431,"The existence of small-molecule signals that influence development in Caenorhabditis elegans has been known for several decades, but only in recent years have the chemical structures of several of these signals been established. The identification of these signals has enabled connections to be made between these small molecules and fundamental signaling pathways in C. elegans that influence not only development but also metabolism, fertility, and lifespan. Spurred by these important discoveries and aided by recent advances in comparative metabolomics and NMR spectroscopy, the field of nematode chemistry has the potential to expand dramatically in the coming years. This Perspective will focus on small-molecule pheromones and hormones that influence developmental events in the nematode life cycle (ascarosides, dafachronic acids, and nemamides), will cover more recent work regarding the biosynthesis of these signals, and will explore how the discovery of these signals is transforming our understanding of nematode development and physiology."

Nonetheless, combination therapy holds promise, and nutraceuticals (natural dietary compounds with therapeutic properties) and their synthetic derivatives are well-tolerated candidates. We tested whether combination therapy with octyl gallate (OG) and ferulic acid (FA) improves cognition and mitigates AD-like pathology in the presenilin-amyloid β-protein precursor (PSAPP) transgenic mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis. One-year-old mice with established β-amyloid plaques received daily doses of OG and FA alone or in combination for 3 months. PSAPP mice receiving combination therapy had statistically significant improved cognitive function versus OG or FA single treatment on some (but not all) measures. We also observed additional statistically significant reductions in brain parenchymal and cerebral vascular β-amyloid deposits as well as brain amyloid β-protein abundance in OG- plus FA-treated versus singly-treated PSAPP mice. These effects coincided with enhanced nonamyloidogenic amyloid β-protein precursor (APP) cleavage, increased α-secretase activity, and β-secretase inhibition. We detected elevated expression of nonamyloidogenic soluble APP-α and the α-secretase candidate, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10. Correspondingly, amyloidogenic β-carboxyl-terminal APP fragment and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 expression levels were reduced. In parallel, the ratio of β- to α-carboxyl-terminal APP fragment was decreased. OG and FA combination therapy strikingly attenuated neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and synaptotoxicity. Co-treatment afforded additional statistically significant benefits on some, but not all, of these outcome measures.

The World Alzheimer Report warns that 46.8 million people worldwide are living with this debilitating illness in 2015, with an estimated increase to 131.5 million by 2050. Dementia has a titanic economic impact, with an 818 billion dollar total estimated worldwide cost that will eclipse a trillion dollars by 2018 and increase to 2 trillion dollars by 2030. Around the world, there were 9.9 million new cases of dementia in 2015, which is one new case every 3 s (1Alzheimer's Disease InternationalThe Global Impact of Dementia, World Alzheimer Report 2015.

Extracellular deposition of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) in the brain parenchyma and cerebral vessels is a pathognomonic feature of the disease (2Selkoe D.J. Alzheimer's disease: genes, proteins, and therapy.Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5156) Google Scholar), and the “amyloid cascade hypothesis” purports that cerebral Aβ deposition drives AD pathogenesis (3Hardy J. Allsop D.

In the amyloidogenic pathway, Aβ is generated via sequential endoproteolytic cleavage of amyloid β-protein precursor (APP) by β- and γ-secretases. These cleavage events create an Aβ-containing β-carboxyl-terminal fragment (CTF) (C99), an amino-terminal soluble APP-β (sAPP-β), and a smaller γ-CTF (C57) (4De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K.

Conversely in the nonamyloidogenic pathway, α-secretase cleavage of APP precludes Aβ formation and produces amino-terminal soluble APP-α (sAPP-α), α-CTF (C83), and p3 peptide (5Sinha S. Lieberburg I.

Cummins D.J. Paul S.M. Holtzman D.M. Brain to plasma amyloid-β efflux: a measure of brain amyloid burden in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.Science. 2002; 295: 2264-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). APP molecules are homeostatically processed by nonamyloidogenic α-secretase cleavage of APP; therefore, constitutive Aβ generation is quantitatively minor. In autosomal dominant AD, a subset of mutations in the APP or the presenilin (PS) genes drive the amyloidogenic pathway, whereas other APP mutations impact Aβ assembly without affecting production of Aβ peptides. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl d-aspartate antagonists are current standard-of-care for treating AD-related symptoms with limited efficacy and no disease modification. In addition, although anti-psychotic drugs are still prescribed at advanced disease stages to treat behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, associated adverse effects (e.g. arousal disturbance, ileus, tardive dyskinesia, malignant syndrome, rhabdomyosis, etc.) often worsen activities of daily living and quality of life. Clinical trials are presently underway based on the amyloid cascade hypothesis, and we await results from those studies. Unfortunately, drugs designed to block Aβ production have, so far, produced unwanted side effects. Nonetheless, secretase modulation remains an important AD therapeutic approach. In this regard, naturally occurring dietary compounds, so-called “nutraceuticals” can be used to modulate APP processing with very little (if any) side effects. We screened a class of nutraceuticals and their synthetic derivatives, and we identified two promising phenolic compounds: octyl gallate (OG) (10Zhang S.Q. Sawmiller D. Li S. Rezai-Zadeh K. Hou H.

Octyl gallate markedly promotes anti-amyloidogenic processing of APP through estrogen receptor-mediated ADAM10 activation.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e71913Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and ferulic acid (FA) (11Mori T.

OG (octyl 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate, C15H22O5) is a phenolic compound that is permitted for use as an anti-oxidant and preservative in foods (e.g. oil, margarine, lard, and peanut butter) and cosmetics. OG is an alkyl gallate, which is synthetically derived from gallic acid. Its multifunctional biological properties include anti-fungal and anti-oxidant activities (12Kubo I. Xiao P. Fujita K.

We previously reported that OG promotes nonamyloidogenic processing of both human wild-type (WT) and “Swedish” mutant forms of APP via estrogen receptor-mediated a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10) activation. Moreover, intracerebroventricular injection of OG into Tg2576 mice decreased cerebral Aβ abundance and increased sAPP-α expression (10Zhang S.Q. Sawmiller D. Li S. Rezai-Zadeh K. Hou H. Zhou S.

FA (trans-4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid, C10H10O4) is a phenolic compound that is copiously present in seed plants and leaves (e.g. rice, wheat, and oat), vegetables (e.g. tomato and carrot), and fruits (e.g. pineapple and orange). FA is generated by the metabolism of phenylalanine and tyrosine, and it is found both in free form and covalently linked to lignin and other biopolymers. The compound has both anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties (15Zhao Z. Moghadasian M.H. Chemistry, natural sources, dietary intake and pharmacokinetic properties of ferulic acid: a review.Food Chem. 2008; 109: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), and our previous report showed that oral FA treatment for 6 months remediates behavioral impairment, reduces amyloidogenic APP metabolism by modulating β-secretase, and mitigates AD-like pathology in the PSAPP transgenic mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis (11Mori T.

Ferulic acid is a nutraceutical β-secretase modulator that improves behavioral impairment and Alzheimer-like pathology in transgenic mice.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e55774Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Both OG and FA have low molecular weights, are cell-permeable, and are highly bioavailable. OG is metabolized in the intestine to gallic acid and octanol, and finally to acetate and butyrate via sequential enzymatic action. Gallic acid (3,4,5,-trihydroxybenzoic acid) is a smaller phenolic compound that is a hydrolysable tannin constituent of many plants (13Barla F. Higashijima H. Funai S. Sugimoto K. Harada N. Yamaji R.

Tannins (e.g. gallic acid) have anti-oxidant and free radical scavenging, anti-viral/bacterial, anti-carcinogenic, anti-mutagenic, and anti-inflammatory properties (16Serrano J. Puupponen-Pimiä R.

Intestinal absorption of p-coumaric and gallic acids in rats after oral administration.J. Agric. Food Chem. 2004; 52: 2527-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), equating to 76 min in humans (18Shahrzad S. Aoyagi K. Winter A. Koyama A. Bitsch I.

FA is absorbed in free form through stomach mucosa and is then transported into the hepatic portal vein where it is metabolized in the liver. Interestingly, FA can be recovered in rat plasma 5 min after oral administration. At this point, the ratio of free FA to total FA in plasma is considerably elevated but rapidly gives rise to conjugated FA. Both free and conjugated FA are reportedly distributed via the systemic circulation into tissues (15Zhao Z. Moghadasian M.H. Chemistry, natural sources, dietary intake and pharmacokinetic properties of ferulic acid: a review.Food Chem. 2008; 109: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 20Zhao Z. Egashira Y. Sanada H. Ferulic acid is quickly absorbed from rat stomach as the free form and then conjugated mainly in liver.J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 3083-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Given similar anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of OG and FA as well as complementary modes of action on APP processing, we hypothesized that combination therapy with OG plus FA would lower cerebral Aβ pathology and improve cognitive function. To test this, we orally administered these agents alone or in combination (all at 30 mg/kg) daily for 3 months (commencing at 12 months of age) to the PSAPP-accelerated mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis, and we examined behavioral impairment, AD-like pathology, and APP processing at 15 months. For some (but not all) measures, results showed additional benefit afforded by combination therapy. When cerebral and vascular β-amyloid deposits are already present in the PSAPP mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis (at 12 months of age), we orally administered (via gavage) vehicle, OG, FA, or OG plus FA (all at 30 mg/kg) once daily for 3 months to PSAPP or WT littermate mice. Prior to randomized group assignment, we assessed baseline cognitive status in all mice at 12 months of age. In this study, we only included cognitively impaired PSAPP mice (four treatments with n = 8 per group; equal numbers of four males and four females) and cognitively normal WT littermates (same group sizes and sex distribution as PSAPP mice). At the end of treatment (15 months of age), we conducted novel object recognition testing for episodic memory, and all eight groups had comparable recognition indices (49.3–52.0%) in the training phase of the test (Fig. 1A, left). By contrast, in the retention phase, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc testing demonstrated statistically significant differences between PSAPP-V mice and the other seven mouse groups (Fig. 1A, right; *, p < 0.05 for PSAPP-V versus all other groups). PSAPP mice treated with OG plus FA or OG/FA alone had significantly increased novel object exploration frequency by 59.8–70.0% versus PSAPP-V mice (50.6%). Moreover, combined treatment with OG plus FA additionally improved episodic memory versus OG or FA single treatment (Fig. 1A, right; †, p < 0.05, PSAPP-OGFA versus PSAPP-OG or PSAPP-FA mice). Combination treatment completely remediated episodic memory impairment, because there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) versus any of the WT mouse groups (Fig. 1A, right). In the Y-maze test for exploratory activity and spatial working memory, one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc comparison demonstrated statistically significant differences for total arm entries between PSAPP-V mice and the other seven mouse groups (Fig. 1B, left; *, p < 0.05). This behavioral phenotype has been reported in mouse models of cerebral amyloidosis (11Mori T. Koyama N. Guillot-Sestier M.V. Tan J. Town T.

Optimization of chronic stress paradigms using anxiety- and depression-like behavioral parameters.J. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 83: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Of note, PSAPP transgene-associated hyperactivity was completely mitigated in PSAPP-OGFA mice (Fig. 1B, left; †, p < 0.05, PSAPP-OGFA versus PSAPP-OG or PSAPP-FA mice), which did not significantly differ from any of the WT mouse groups (p > 0.05). Mice tend to spontaneously alternate arm entries in the Y-maze, such that they visit the three arms in sequence more frequently than would occur by chance (50%, see dashed line in Fig. 1B, right); this phenotype is generally interpreted as a measure of spatial working memory. PSAPP-V mice had fewer tendencies to alternate, thus demonstrating impaired spatial working memory. One-way ANOVA followed by post hoc testing revealed statistically significant differences on Y-maze spontaneous alternation between PSAPP-V mice and the other seven mouse groups (Fig. 1B, right; *, p < 0.05). Importantly, PSAPP-OGFA mice significantly increased alternation behavior compared with OG or FA singly-treated mice (Fig. 1B, right; †, p < 0.05, PSAPP-OGFA versus PSAPP-OG or PSAPP-FA mice), and did not significantly differ from any of the WT mouse groups (p > 0.05); demonstrating completely remediated spatial working memory. Finally, we evaluated mice in the radial arm water maze (RAWM) test for hippocampus-dependent spatial reference learning and memory. On day 1, overall ANOVA showed main effects of block (p < 0.001 for both errors and escape latency), genotype (p < 0.01 for errors and p = 0.001 for escape latency), and treatment (p < 0.05 for escape latency). Repeated-measures ANOVA followed by post hoc comparison did not show statistically significant differences between PSAPP-V mice and the other seven mouse groups, whereas PSAPP-V mice tended toward more errors and greater escape latencies to reach the visible or hidden platform locations than the other seven groups. On day 2, overall ANOVA demonstrated main effects of block (p < 0.001 for both errors and escape latency), genotype (p < 0.01 for errors and p < 0.001 for escape latency), and treatment (p < 0.001 for both errors and escape latency). Repeated-measures ANOVA followed by post hoc evaluation showed statistically significant differences between PSAPP-V mice and the other seven mouse groups (Fig. 1C; *, p < 0.05 for both errors and escape latency). PSAPP-V mice had increased errors and longer latencies to reach the visible or hidden platform locations than the other seven mouse groups; importantly however, PSAPP-OGFA, PSAPP-OG, and PSAPP-FA mice completed the task with significantly less errors and shorter latencies, and their behavior did not significantly differ from the four WT mouse groups (p > 0.05). This demonstrates that 3-month single or double treatment with OG and FA completely reverses mutant human APP transgene-associated spatial reference learning and memory deficits. In addition, there were no significant between-group differences (p > 0.05) on swim speed, nor did we observe thigmotaxis (an index of anxiety) in any of the mice tested. For all behavioral tests, multiple ANOVA models were used with sex as a categorical covariate, but we did not observe significant main effects or interactive terms with sex (p > 0.05). To be certain, we also stratified data by sex, and a similar pattern of results as above was evident in both males and females (data not shown). At 15 months of age, PSAPP-V mouse brains had severe cerebral β-amyloid load (mean of 7–8%) throughout the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), entorhinal cortex (EC), and hippocampus (H) regions of interest (ROI). By contrast, PSAPP-OG, PSAPP-FA, and PSAPP-OGFA mice had 29–59% plaque reduction across all three brain regions. Greatest reductions were observed in the EC (Figure 2, Figure 3, A–C; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). Importantly, β-amyloid burden was further significantly reduced in H and EC PSAPP-OGFA brain areas (28–33% additional reduction versus OG or FA single treatment) (Fig. 3, B and C; †, p < 0.05). To determine whether treatment prevented versus reversed kinetics of cerebral amyloid accumulation, eight untreated PSAPP mice at 12 months of age (when dosing started) were included in the analysis and had cerebral β-amyloid burden averaging from 4 to 5% (Fig. 3, A–C). Intriguingly, in RSC, H, and EC regions, 3-month treatment with OG plus FA trended toward reversing cerebral amyloid pathology compared with untreated baseline (at 12 months of age, Fig. 3, A–C). This effect was sex-independent (data not shown).Figure 3Cerebral β-amyloid deposits are mitigated by combination of OG plus FA treatment. Data were obtained from PSAPP mice treated with vehicle (PSAPP-V, n = 8), OG (PSAPP-OG, n = 8), FA (PSAPP-FA, n = 8), or OG plus FA (PSAPP-OGFA, n = 8) for 3 months commencing at 12 months of age (mouse age at sacrifice = 15 months) for A–F and from 12-month-old untreated PSAPP-mice (PSAPP-12M, n = 8) for A–C. A–C, quantitative image analyses for Aβ burden using an amino-terminal Aβ(17–24) monoclonal antibody (4G8) are shown. D–F, morphometric analyses of cerebral parenchymal β-amyloid plaque size are shown. A–F, brain region is indicated on the x axis. Statistical comparisons for A–F are within each brain region, between groups. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 for PSAPP-V versus the other treated mice; †, p < 0.05 for PSAPP-OGFA versus PSAPP-OG or PSAPP-FA mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further elucidate effects of treatment on cerebral amyloid pathology, we conducted morphometric analysis of β-amyloid deposits. In the entire RSC, EC, and H regions, Aβ(17–24) monoclonal antibody 4G8-stained β-amyloid deposits were assigned to one of three mutually exclusive groupings based on maximum diameter as follows: small (<25 μm), medium (between 25 and 50 μm), or large (> 50 μm). PSAPP-OGFA mice had the greatest magnitude of statistically significant reductions in all three subcategories: 24–45% for small, 34–49% for medium, and 39–65% for large plaques (Figure 2, Figure 3, D–F; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). Of note, doubly-treated PSAPP mice showed additional statistically significant reductions in large plaques in H and EC regions compared with OG or FA singly-treated mice (39–43% additional reduction; Fig. 3F; †, p < 0.05). Stratification by sex demonstrated the same pattern of results in both males and females (data not shown). We confirmed histological observations by biochemical analysis of Aβ species in brain homogenates using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the TBS-soluble fraction, all three groups of treated PSAPP mice had statistically significant reductions in Aβ(1–40) (from 45 to 70%) and Aβ(1–42) (from 42 to 65%) abundance compared with PSAPP-V controls (Fig. 4A; *, p < 0.05). Aβ(1–40) levels were markedly and significantly decreased by combined treatment (43–46% further decrease versus OG or FA alone) (Fig. 4A; ††, p < 0.01). A similar pattern of results emerged when considering the detergent-soluble fraction, where the three PSAPP treatment groups had statistically significant reductions in both Aβ(1–40) (from 42 to 61%) and Aβ(1–42) (from 26 to 37%) (Fig. 4B; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01). Moreover, the guanidine HCl-soluble fraction, which most closely mirrors cerebral β-amyloid deposits, revealed statistically significant reductions for each PSAPP treatment group for Aβ(1–40) (from 25 to 51%) and Aβ(1–42) (from 30 to 58%) (Fig. 4C; **, p < 0.01). Here again, PSAPP-OGFA mice had the deepest reductions in both Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42) levels (30–40% further reduction versus OG or FA single treatment) (Fig. 4C; †, p < 0.05). We moved on to assess cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). At 15 months of age, PSAPP-V mice had numerous cerebral vascular β-amyloid deposits in the walls of penetrating arteries at the pial surface in RSC and EC regions and in small arteries at the hippocampal fissure and brachium of the superior colliculus (Fig. 5A). Mean numbers of CAA deposits showed statistically significant reductions in PSAPP-OG (20–36%), PSAPP-FA (17–35%), and PSAPP-OGFA (37–41%) versus PSAPP-V mice in all three brain regions examined (Fig. 5"
https://openalex.org/W2614724909,"Human-elephant conflict (HEC) is a serious threat to elephants and can cause major economic losses. It is widely accepted that reduction of HEC will often require community-based methods for repelling elephants but there are few tests of such methods. We tested community-based crop-guarding methods with and without novel chili-based elephant deterrents and describe changes in farmers' willingness to adopt these methods following our demonstration of their relative effectiveness. In three separate field-trials that took place over almost two years (October 2005 -May 2007) in two villages adjacent to Way Kambas National Park (WKNP) in Indonesia, we found that community-based crop-guarding was effective at keeping Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) out of crop fields in 91.2% (52 out of 57), 87.6% (156 out of 178), and 80.0% (16 out of 20) of attempted raids. Once the method had been shown to be effective at demonstration sites, farmers in 16 villages around WKNP voluntarily adopted it during the July 2008 to March 2009 period and were able to repel elephants in 73.9% (150 out of 203) of attempted raids, with seven villages repelling 100% of attempted raids. These 16 villages had all experienced high levels of HEC in the preceding years; e.g. they accounted for >97% of the 742 HEC incidents recorded for the entire park in 2006. Our work shows, therefore, that a simple evidence-based approach can facilitate significant reductions in HEC at the protected area scale."

Conversely, a growing number of studies have shown that tumor-associated myoepithelial cells have a tumor-promoting effect. Moreover, the exact role of tumor-associated myoepithelial cells in the DCIS-to-IDC development remains undefined. To address this, we explored the role of tumor-associated myoepithelial cells in the DCIS-to-IDC progression. We developed a direct coculture system to study the cell-cell interactions between DCIS cells and tumor-associated myoepithelial cells. Coculture studies indicated that tumor-associated myoepithelial cells promoted the invasive progression of a DCIS cell model in vitro, and mechanistic studies revealed that the interaction with DCIS cells stimulated tumor-associated myoepithelial cells to secrete TGFβ1, which subsequently contributed to activating the TGFβ/Smads pathway in DCIS cells. We noted that activation of the TGFβ signaling pathway promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, basal-like phenotypes, stemness, and invasiveness of DCIS cells. Importantly, xenograft studies further demonstrated that tumor-associated myoepithelial cells enhanced the DCIS-to-IDC progression in vivo. Furthermore, we found that TGFβ-mediated induction of oncogenic miR-10b-5p expression and down-regulation of RB1CC1, a miR-10b-5p-targeted tumor-suppressor gene, contributed to the invasive progression of DCIS. Our findings provide the first experimental evidence to directly support the paradigm that altered DCIS-associated myoepithelial cells promote the invasive progression of DCIS into IDC via TGFβ signaling activation.

In total, 356 CART sessions in 147 patients at 22 centers were performed. The most common primary disease was cancer (128 cases, 300 sessions). Mean amount of ascites collected was 3.7 L, and mean concentration ratio was 9.2. Mean amount of reinfused protein was 67.8 g (recovery rate, 72.0%). Performance status, dietary intake, urine volume, body weight and abdominal circumference were significantly improved after CART. Body temperature increased significantly, by 0.3°C on average. Concomitant steroids and/or NSAIDs use before reinfusion was significantly and negatively associated with increases in body temperature. Most adverse events were fever and chills. This study examined a large number of patients compared with previous studies, and showed that CART is an effective and relatively safe treatment for refractory ascites, such as malignant ascites."
https://openalex.org/W2614338298,"Mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs, between 30 and 150 m depth) are hypothesized to contribute to the recovery of degraded shallow reefs through sexually produced larvae (referred to as Deep Reef Refuge Hypothesis). In Okinawa, Japan, the brooder coral Seriatopora hystrix was reported to be locally extinct in a shallow reef while it was found abundant at a MCE nearby. In this context, S. hystrix represents a key model to test the Deep Reef Refuge Hypothesis and to understand the potential contribution of mesophotic corals to shallow coral reef recovery. However, the reproductive biology of mesophotic S. hystrix and its potential to recolonize shallow reefs is currently unknown. This study reports for the first time, different temporal scales of reproductive periodicity and larval settlement of S. hystrix from an upper mesophotic reef (40 m depth) in Okinawa. We examined reproductive seasonality, lunar, and circadian periodicity (based on polyp dissection, histology, and ex situ planula release observations) and larval settlement rates in the laboratory. Mesophotic S. hystrix reproduced mainly in July and early August, with a small number of planulae being released at the end of May, June and August. Compared to shallow colonies in the same region, mesophotic S. hystrix has a 4-month shorter reproductive season, similar circadian periodicity, and smaller planula size. In addition, most of the planulae settled rapidly, limiting larval dispersal potential. The shorter reproductive season and smaller planula size may result from limited energy available for reproduction at deeper depths, while the similar circadian periodicity suggests that this reproductive aspect is not affected by environmental conditions differing with depth. Overall, contribution of mesophotic S. hystrix to shallow reef rapid recovery appears limited, although they may recruit to shallow reefs through a multistep process over a few generations or through random extreme mixing such as typhoons."

We recently discovered that the cadherin superfamily carries O-linked mannose (O-Man) glycans at highly conserved residues in specific extracellular cadherin domains, and it was suggested that the function of E-cadherin was dependent on the O-Man glycans. Deficiencies in enzymes catalyzing O-Man biosynthesis, including the two human protein O-mannosyltransferases, POMT1 and POMT2, underlie a subgroup of congenital muscular dystrophies designated α-dystroglycanopathies, because deficient O-Man glycosylation of α-dystroglycan disrupts laminin interaction with α-dystroglycan and the extracellular matrix. To explore the functions of O-Man glycans on cadherins and protocadherins, we used a combinatorial gene-editing strategy in multiple cell lines to evaluate the role of the two POMTs initiating O-Man glycosylation and the major enzyme elongating O-Man glycans, the protein O-mannose β-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, POMGnT1. Surprisingly, O-mannosylation of cadherins and protocadherins does not require POMT1 and/or POMT2 in contrast to α-dystroglycan, and moreover, the O-Man glycans on cadherins are not elongated. Thus, the classical and evolutionarily conserved POMT O-mannosylation pathway is essentially dedicated to α-dystroglycan and a few other proteins, whereas a novel O-mannosylation process in mammalian cells is predicted to serve the large cadherin superfamily and other proteins.

More recently, the human O-Man glycoproteome was characterized, and it was found that the large superfamily of cadherins (cdhs) and protocadherins (pcdhs) are also decorated with α-linked O-Man glycans on extracellular cadherin (EC) domains. The attachment sites of these O-Man glycans appear to be highly conserved throughout evolution (13Vester-Christensen M.B. Halim A. Joshi H.J. Steentoft C. Bennett E.P. Levery S.B. Vakhrushev S.Y.

O-Man glycosylation in metazoans is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by transfer of mannose from dolichol monophosphate-activated mannose to serine and threonine by the POMT1 and POMT2 protein O-mannosyltransferases. Our insight into the substrate specificities of these enzymes largely stems from studies of the yeast orthologs, which consist of a larger family of six or more protein O-mannosyltransferases (PMTs) (17Girrbach V.

These are grouped into three subfamilies, PMT1, PMT2, and PMT4, and the two metazoan orthologs, POMT1 and POMT2, are grouped in subfamilies PMT4 and PMT2, respectively (17Girrbach V. Strahl S.

This categorization is based on sequence similarities, but a recent study confirmed the functional similarity between the human POMT1 and yeast PMT4 enzymes (19Bausewein D. Engel J. Jank T. Schoedl M. Strahl S. Functional similarities between the protein O-mannosyltransferases Pmt4 from baker's yeast and human POMT1.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 18006-18015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). O-Mannosylation of proteins in yeast is widespread, and we recently characterized the yeast O-Man glycoproteome identifying almost 300 glycoproteins that enter the secretory pathway (20Neubert P. Halim A. Zauser M. Essig A. Joshi H.J. Zatorska E. Larsen I.S. Loibl M. Castells-Ballester J. Aebi M. Clausen H. Strahl S. Mapping the O-mannose glycoproteome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2016; 15: 1323-1337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, we also found that yeast has an additional and unique nucleocytoplasmic O-Man glycoproteome, which is predicted to be glycosylated by a yet unknown cytosolic/nuclear O-mannosyltransferase(s) different from the ER-located PMTs (21Halim A. Larsen I.S. Neubert P. Joshi H.J. Petersen B.L. Vakhrushev S.Y. Strahl S. Clausen H. Discovery of a nucleocytoplasmic O-mannose glycoproteome in yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: 15648-15653Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The nucleocytoplasmic O-mannosylation system is only found in yeast and is predicted to serve similar functions as the nucleocytoplasmic O-GlcNAcylation found in all eukaryotic cells except yeast (22Hart G.W. Slawson C. Ramirez-Correa G. Lagerlof O. Cross talk between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation: roles in signaling, transcription, and chronic disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 825-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). The ER-located PMTs in yeast have wide glycosylation functions of ER/Golgi, cell wall, and secreted proteins, similar to the metazoan GalNAc-type O-glycosylation (23Steentoft C. Vakhrushev S.Y. Joshi H.J. Kong Y. Vester-Christensen M.B. Schjoldager K.T. Lavrsen K. Dabelsteen S. Pedersen N.B. Marcos-Silva L. Gupta R. Bennett E.P. Mandel U. Brunak S. Wandall H.H. et al.Precision mapping of the human O-GalNAc glycoproteome through SimpleCell technology.EMBO J. 2013; 32: 1478-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar), and in fact it appears that the two types of glycosylation have great overlaps in proteins and glycosites as well as biological functions (20Neubert P. Halim A. Zauser M. Essig A. Joshi H.J. Zatorska E. Larsen I.S. Loibl M. Castells-Ballester J. Aebi M. Clausen H. Strahl S. Mapping the O-mannose glycoproteome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell.

Interestingly, the orthologous metazoans POMT1 and POMT2 are predicted to have narrower substrate specificities and only serve in glycosylating a limited number of proteins, including α-DG and cdhs/pcdhs (13Vester-Christensen M.B.

However, the functions of the POMT1 and POMT2 isoenzymes and their relationship with the larger family of yeast PMTs are still poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to explore the biological roles of O-mannosylation of the large families of important cdh and pcdh adhesion proteins. We used a knock-out strategy to deconstruct the genetic regulation targeting the POMT1 and POMT2 genes as well as POMGNT1 in two mammalian cell lines. We also used the SimpleCell O-glycoproteomics approach targeting both COSMC and POMGNT1 to demonstrate a predicted interplay between O-Man and O-GalNAc glycosylation in human HEK293 cells. We found in agreement with previous reports that both POMT1 and POMT2 were required for O-mannosylation of α-DG; however, to our surprise, deficiency in either or both POMT1 and POMT2 did not affect O-mannosylation of cdhs, pcdhs, and additional proteins. This finding was confirmed by analysis of a human skin fibroblast cell line derived from a POMT1-deficient patient. Thus, our study suggests that the function of the two mammalian POMTs is even more limited than previously predicted and serves α-DG and few additional proteins, including the mucin-like protein KIAA1549. Most importantly, the results suggest the existence of a previously unknown ER/Golgi-located protein O-mannosylation pathway in mammalian cells that specifically control O-Man glycosylation of the superfamily of cadherins. We first generated CHO cells with knock-out of POMGNT1 (CHOPGNT1) (Table 1), termed SimpleCells with truncated O-Man glycans suitable for lectin weak affinity chromatography (LWAC) enrichment of O-Man glycopeptides with the ConA lectin (Fig. 1A). We explored the O-Man glycoproteome identifying a comparatively low number of nine O-Man glycoproteins (Table 2), and in seven the human orthologs were previously identified in human MDA231 breast cancer cells (13Vester-Christensen M.B. Halim A. Joshi H.J. Steentoft C. Bennett E.P. Levery S.B. Vakhrushev S.Y. Clausen H. Mining the O-mannose glycoproteome reveals cadherins as major O-mannosylated glycoproteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 21018-21023Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and two novel proteins, reticulocalbin 3 and multiple coagulation factor deficiency protein 2-like. As expected, we found O-Man glycopeptides from α-DG and members of the cdh/pcdh and plexin families. We also identified the apparent CHO ortholog of the KIAA1549 protein, which we previously identified as a membrane protein with a large mucin-like ectodomain densely decorated with O-Man glycans (13Vester-Christensen M.B. Halim A. Joshi H.J. Steentoft C. Bennett E.P. Levery S.B. Vakhrushev S.Y. Clausen H. Mining the O-mannose glycoproteome reveals cadherins as major O-mannosylated glycoproteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 21018-21023Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We also analyzed wild-type (WT) CHO cells, and somewhat surprisingly identified 10 glycoproteins, including α-DG, members of the cdh/pcdh family, and plexins with non-elongated O-Man monosaccharide structures as produced in the CHOPGNT1 (Table 2 and supplemental Table S2). This suggested that our analysis of lysates of CHO WT cells included biosynthetic intermediates and/or that O-Man glycans in CHO cells are not fully elongated by the POMGnT1 enzyme.Table 1Overview of indel mutations for the gene alleles in HEK293 and CHO Open table in a new tab Table 2O-Man glycoproteins identified by ConA LWAC of CHO cells with knock-out of POMGNT1, POMT1, and POMT2, individually or in combinationProteinsWTPOMGnT1POMGnT1/POMT1POMGnT1/POMT2POMGnT1/POMT1/POMT2α-Dystroglycan11KIAA15491Reticulocalbin 311Protocadherins1222Plexins22112Other52561Total109893 Open table in a new tab We proceeded with analysis of the O-Man glycoproteomes in CHOPGNT1 with truncated O-Man glycans containing additional single and double knock-outs of POMT1 and POMT2 (Table 1). In both single POMT1 (CHOPGNT1/POMT1) and POMT2 (CHOPGNT1/POMT2) knock-out cells as well as double POMT1/POMT2 (CHOPGNT1/POMT1/POMT2) knock-out cells, we consistently did not identify O-Man glycopeptides derived from α-DG or KIAA1549 (Table 2 and supplemental Table S2). In contrast, in all mutant cell lines we identified a number of other O-Man glycoproteins, including members of the cdh/pcdh family and plexins as well as PDI-A3 and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (Table 2 and supplemental Table S2). These results confirm previous studies reporting that co-expression of both POMT1 and POMT2 is required for O-mannosylation of α-DG (25Akasaka-Manya K. Manya H. Hayashi M. Endo T. Different roles of the two components of human protein O-mannosyltransferase, POMT1 and POMT2.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 411: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), but they also demonstrate that O-mannosylation of a number of other proteins, including the large cdh/pcdh family, may not depend on the POMT1 and POMT2 enzymes. In general, the number of O-Man glycoproteins identified in CHO cells by our strategy was quite low compared with our previous study of a human breast cancer cell line (13Vester-Christensen M.B. Halim A. Joshi H.J. Steentoft C. Bennett E.P. Levery S.B. Vakhrushev S.Y. Clausen H. Mining the O-mannose glycoproteome reveals cadherins as major O-mannosylated glycoproteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 21018-21023Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We therefore turned to human HEK293 cells and generated isogenic cell lines with knock-out of COSMC (HEK293SC) and both COSMC and POMGNT1 (HEK293SC/PGNT1) to establish double SimpleCells with truncated O-Man and O-GalNAc glycans (26Steentoft C.

Mining the O-glycoproteome using zinc-finger nuclease–glycoengineered SimpleCell lines.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 977-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). We stacked POMT1 (HEK293SC/PGNT1/POMT1) knock-out in the double SimpleCell background where both O-Man and O-GalNAc glycans are truncated facilitating sensitive analysis of both types of glycoproteomes simultaneously (Fig. 1 and Table 1). α-DG contains a central mucin-like domain with O-Man glycans in the N-terminal region and O-GalNAc glycans in the C-terminal region, and we have readily identified glycopeptides from both regions with our COSMC and POMGNT1 knock-out SimpleCell strategies enriching for O-Man and O-GalNAc (13Vester-Christensen M.B.

We also generated POMT1/POMT2 double knock-out (HEK293POMT1/POMT2) in HEK293 WT cells (Table 1). Using these mutant cells, we identified a total of 63 O-Man glycoproteins following ConA enrichment and mass spectrometry (Table 3). In agreement with our data from MDA231 breast cancer cells (13Vester-Christensen M.B. Halim A. Joshi H.J. Steentoft C. Bennett E.P. Levery S.B. Vakhrushev S.Y. Clausen H. Mining the O-mannose glycoproteome reveals cadherins as major O-mannosylated glycoproteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 21018-21023Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we identified O-Man glycosites on α-DG, but the cdh/pcdh family accounted for the majority of O-Man glycoproteins identified in HEK293SC/PGNT1cells (supplemental Table S3). In agreement with our studies in CHO cell, we did not detect α-DG O-Man glycopeptides in HEK293SC/PGNT1/POMT1 deficient in POMT1, whereas we readily identified 25 O-Man glycoproteins of which 20 were members of the cdh/pcdh superfamily (Table 3). Moreover, the same was found for the double POMT1/POMT2 knock-out HEK293POMT1/POMT2 cell line without truncated O-glycans, where we identified 37 O-Man glycoproteins from cdh/pcdh family members as well as several other proteins (Table 3). The cumulative findings confirm that O-mannosylation of α-DG and the mucin-like KIAA1549 requires the function of both POMT1 and POMT2, whereas the cadherin superfamily, plexins, and several other proteins appear to be glycosylated by yet unknown enzymes in mammalian cells. Similar to CHO cells, we identified O-Man glycosites on cdh and pcdh in HEK293 cells without knock-out of POMGNT1 (HEK293POMT1/POMT2) suggesting that cell lysates included biosynthetic intermediates and/or that O-Man glycans on these glycoproteins are not fully elongated by the POMGnT1 enzyme.Table 3O-Man glycoproteins identified by ConA LWAC of HEK293 cells with knock-out of COSMC, POMGNT1, POMT1, and POMT2, individually or in combinationProteinsCOSMC/POMGnT1COSMC/POMGnT1/POMT1COSMC/POMGnT1/POMT1/POMT2POMT1/POMT2α-Dystroglycan1Reticulocalbin 11SUCO1CadherinsClassical type I1144Atypical type II2433Desmocolin1111Desmoglein1ProtocadherinsClustered protocadherins37712Nonclustered protocadherins2467FAT3333Plexins1133Other15494Total32253637 Open table in a new tab We previously characterized O-Man glycosites on the extracellular domains (EC) of protocadherin γ-C5 (EC1–4) recombinantly expressed in HEK293 cells (14Rubinstein R.

Interestingly, we found all identified O-Man glycans as single mannose monosaccharide residues. To further explore the role of POMT1 and POMT2 in glycosylation of cdh/pcdh, we expressed three representative members, mouse E-cadherin, Pcdhα-C2, and Pcdhγ-A4, as secreted His-tagged ectodomains in HEK293POMT1/POMT2 mutant cells. The tagged proteins were purified and digested with trypsin and subjected to bottom-up MS analysis to map glycosylation sites and structures. The mass spectrometric analyses identified 7, 8, and 7 O-Man glycosites in E-cadherin, Pcdhα-C2, and Pcdhγ-A4, respectively. The O-Man glycosylation sites were distributed across four of the six extracellular cadherin domains of Pcdhα-C2 and two of the six EC domains of Pcdhγ-A4, whereas E-cadherin was occupied with O-Man on four of the five EC domains, with the EC1 domain being the only one without detectable O-mannosylation in agreement with our previous findings (supplemental Table S4) (13Vester-Christensen M.B.

We processed the data and searched for O-Man glycans matching all known glycan structures, e.g. M1, M2, and M3 cores, that have been observed on α-DG (27Praissman J.L. Wells L. Mammalian O-mannosylation pathway: glycan structures, enzymes, and protein Substrates.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 3066-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but we identified no evidence of any elongation of cdh and pcdh O-Man glycans. All glycosites identified were occupied by single mannose residues with no evidence of more complex structures that are normally found on α-DG, for example (28Breloy I. Schwientek T. Gries B. Razawi H. Macht M. Albers C. Hanisch F.G.

Thus, analysis of the recombinantly expressed cdh/pcdhs in HEK293 mutant cells shows that O-mannosylation of this class of proteins is not dependent on POMT1 and POMT2 and furthermore that the O-Man glycans on these proteins do not appear to be elongated. To further confirm these findings, we used a recently developed comparative quantitative O-glycoproteomics strategy based on differential labeling of tryptic digests from isogenic cells using stable dimethyl isotopes (29Boersema P.J.

While the use of nonselective ROCK inhibitors like fasudil together with rt-PA may be hindered by possible hypotensive side-effects and inadequate capacity to block detrimental rt-PA activity in brain endothelial cells (BECs), selective ROCK-2 inhibition may overcome these limitations. Here, we examined ROCK-2 expression in major brain cells and compared the ability of fasudil and KD025, a selective ROCK-2 inhibitor, to attenuate rt-PA-induced BBB impairment in an in vitro human model. ROCK-2 was highly expressed relative to ROCK-1 in all human and mouse brain cell types and particularly enriched in rodent brain endothelial cells and astrocytes compared to neurons. KD025 was more potent than fasudil in attenuation of rt-PA- and plasminogen-induced BBB permeation under normoxia, but especially under stroke-like conditions. Importantly, only KD025, but not fasudil, was able to block rt-PA-dependent permeability increases, morphology changes and tight junction degradation in isolated BECs. Selective ROCK-2 inhibition further diminished rt-PA-triggered myosin phosphorylation, shape alterations and matrix metalloprotease activation in astrocytes. These findings highlight ROCK-2 as the key isoform driving BBB impairment and brain endothelial damage by rt-PA and the potential of KD025 to optimally protect the BBB during thrombolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2615567935,"MicroRNAs have emerged as essential regulators of various cellular processes. We identified the role and underlying mechanisms of miR-2392 in gastric cancer (GC) metastasis. MiR-2392 was down-regulated in GC cell lines and tissues, and overexpression of miR-2392 significantly inhibited GC invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. We identified MAML3 and WHSC1 as novel targets of miR-2392, and knockdown of MAML3 and WHSC1 had the same antimetastatic effect as that of miR-2392 in GC cells. These effects were clinically relevant, as low miR-2392 expression was correlated with high MAML3 and WHSC1 expression and poor survival in patients with GC. Furthermore, forced expression of miR-2392 substantially suppressed Slug and Twist1, transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin, by targeting MAML3 and WHSC1, respectively, resulting in inhibition of the epithelial–mesenchymal transition. These findings indicate that the miR-2392–MAML3/WHSC1–Slug/Twist1 regulatory axis plays a critical role in GC metastasis. Restoration of miR-2392 may be a therapeutic approach for blocking GC metastasis.—Li, J., Li, T., Lu, Y., Shen, G., Guo, H., Wu, J., Lei, C., Du, F., Zhou, F., Zhao, X., Nie, Y., Fan, D.

https://openalex.org/W2614288983,"Observation of others' actions evokes in primary motor cortex and spinal circuits of observers a subliminal motor resonance response, which reflects the motor program encoding observed actions. We investigated the role of attention in human motor resonance with four experimental conditions, explored in different subject groups: in the first explicit condition, subjects were asked to observe a rhythmic hand flexion-extension movement performed live in front of them. In two other conditions subjects had to monitor the activity of a LED light mounted on the oscillating hand. The hand was clearly visible but it was not the focus of subjects’ attention: in the semi-implicit condition hand movement was relevant to task completion, while in the implicit condition it was irrelevant. In a fourth, baseline, condition subjects observed the rhythmic oscillation of a metal platform. Motor resonance was measured with the H-reflex technique as the excitability modulation of cortico-spinal motorneurons driving a hand flexor muscle. As expected, a normal resonant response developed in the explicit condition, and no resonant response in the baseline condition. Resonant responses also developed in both semi-implicit and implicit conditions and, surprisingly, were not different from each other, indicating that viewing an action is, per se, a powerful stimulus for the action observation network, even when it is not the primary focus of subjects’ attention and even when irrelevant to the task. However, the amplitude of these responses was much reduced compared to the explicit condition, and the phase-lock between the time courses of observed movement and resonant motor program was lost. In conclusion, different parameters of the response were differently affected by subtraction of attentional resources with respect to the explicit condition: time course and muscle selection were preserved while the activation of motor circuits resulted in much reduced amplitude and lost its kinematic specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2614115346,"To evaluate the applicability, reproducibility, and diagnostic performance of a new 2D-shear wave elastography (SWE) using the comb-push technique (2D CP-SWE) for detection of hepatic fibrosis, using histopathology as the reference standard.This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. The liver stiffness (LS) measurements were obtained from 140 patients, using the new 2D-SWE, which uses comb-push excitation to produce shear waves and a time-aligned sequential tracking method to detect shear wave signals. The applicability rate of 2D CP-SWE was estimated, and factors associated with its applicability were identified. Intraobserver reproducibility was evaluated in the 105 patients with histopathologic diagnosis, and interobserver reproducibility was assessed in 20 patients. Diagnostic performance of the 2D CP-SWE for hepatic fibrosis was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.The applicability rate of 2D CP-SWE was 90.8% (109 of 120). There was a significant difference in age, presence or absence of ascites, and the distance from the transducer to the Glisson capsule between the patients with applicable LS measurements and patients with unreliable measurement or technical failure. The intraclass correlation of interobserver agreement was 0.87, and the value for the intraobserver agreement was 0.95. The area under the ROC curve of LS values for stage F2 fibrosis or greater, stage F3 or greater, and stage F4 fibrosis was 0.874 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.794-0.930), 0.905 (95% CI: 0.832-0.954), and 0.894 (95% CI: 0.819-0.946), respectively.2D CP-SWE can be employed as a reliable method for assessing hepatic fibrosis with a reasonably good diagnostic performance, and its applicability might be influenced by age, ascites, and the distance between the transducer and Glisson capsule."

While receipt of antibiotics remains an important risk factor for CDI, studies related to acquisition of C. difficile outside of hospitals are lacking. As a result, risk factors for exposure to C. difficile in community settings have been inadequately studied.To identify novel environmental risk factors for CA-CDI.We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study of patients with CA-CDI from 1/1/2007 through 12/31/2014 in a 10-county area in central North Carolina. 360 Census Tracts in these 10 counties were used as the demographic Geographic Information System (GIS) base-map. Longitude and latitude (X, Y) coordinates were generated from patient home addresses and overlaid to Census Tracts polygons using ArcGIS; ArcView was used to assess ""hot-spots"" or clusters of CA-CDI. We then constructed a mixed hierarchical model to identify environmental variables independently associated with increased rates of CA-CDI.A total of 1,895 unique patients met our criteria for CA-CDI. The mean patient age was 54.5 years; 62% were female and 70% were Caucasian. 402 (21%) patient addresses were located in ""hot spots"" or clusters of CA-CDI (p<0.001). ""Hot spot"" census tracts were scattered throughout the 10 counties. After adjusting for clustering and population density, age ≥ 60 years (p = 0.03), race (<0.001), proximity to a livestock farm (0.01), proximity to farming raw materials services (0.02), and proximity to a nursing home (0.04) were independently associated with increased rates of CA-CDI.Our study is the first to use spatial statistics and mixed models to identify important environmental risk factors for acquisition of C. difficile and adds to the growing evidence that farm practices may put patients at risk for important drug-resistant infections."

https://openalex.org/W2614705539,"The RNA-binding and -processing protein TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is heavily linked to the underlying causes and pathology of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. In these diseases, TDP-43 is mislocalized, hyperphosphorylated, ubiquitinated, aggregated and cleaved. The importance of TDP-43 cleavage in the disease pathogenesis is still poorly understood. Here we detail the use of D-sorbitol as an exogenous stressor that causes TDP-43 cleavage in HeLa cells, resulting in a 35 kDa truncated product that accumulates in the cytoplasm within one hour of treatment. We confirm that the formation of this 35 kDa cleavage product is mediated by the activation of caspases. Inhibition of caspases blocks the cleavage of TDP-43, but does not prevent the accumulation of full-length protein in the cytoplasm. Using D-sorbitol as a stressor and caspase activator, we also demonstrate that the A90V variant of TDP-43, which lies adjacent to the caspase cleavage site within the nuclear localization sequence of TDP-43, confers partial resistance against caspase-mediated generation of the 35 kDa cleavage product."

Recent progress in the generation of stabilized variants of solubilized neurotensin receptor 1 and its subsequent purification and successful structure determination presents a solid starting point to apply the approach of fragment-based screening to extend the chemical space of known neurotensin receptor 1 ligands. In this report, surface plasmon resonance was used as primary method to screen 6369 compounds. Thereby 44 hits were identified and confirmed in competition as well as dose-response experiments. Furthermore, 4 out of 8 selected hits were validated using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as orthogonal biophysical method. Computational analysis of the compound structures, taking the known crystal structure of the endogenous peptide agonist into consideration, gave insight into the potential fragment-binding location and interactions and inspires chemistry efforts for further exploration of the fragments."
https://openalex.org/W2615245674,"When used correctly and consistently, the male condom offers triple protection from unintended pregnancy and the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, with health funding levels stagnant or falling, it is important to understand the cost and health impact associated with prevention technologies. This study is one of the first to attempt to quantify the cost and combined health impact of condom use, as a means to prevent unwanted pregnancy and to prevent transmission of STIs including HIV. This paper describes the analysis to make the case for investment in the male condom, including the cost, impact and cost-effectiveness by three scenarios (low in which 2015 condom use levels are maintained; medium in which condom use trends are used to predict condom use from 2016-2030; and high in which condom use is scaled up, as part of a package of contraceptives, to meet all unmet need for family planning by 2030 and to 90% for HIV and STI prevention by 2016) for 81 countries from 2015-2030. An annual gap between current and desired use of 10.9 billion condoms was identified (4.6 billion for family planning and 6.3 billion for HIV and STIs). Under a high scenario that completely reduces that gap between current and desired use of 10.9 billion condoms, we found that by 2030 countries could avert 240 million DALYs. The additional cost in the 81 countries through 2030 under the medium scenario is $1.9 billion, and $27.5 billion under the high scenario. Through 2030, the cost-effectiveness ratios are $304 per DALY averted for the medium and $115 per DALY averted for the high scenario. Under the three scenarios described above, our analysis demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of the male condom in preventing unintended pregnancy and HIV and STI new infections. Policy makers should increase budgets for condom programming to increase the health return on investment of scarce resources."

With the hopes of finding agents that can cure or reduce the pace of progression of the disease, we studied two traditional medicinal plants: Centella asiatica and Withania somnifera that have been explored in some recent studies. In agreement with the previous work on ethanol extracts of these two plants in mice model, we saw an improvement in oxidative stress profile as well as behavioral performance in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induced Parkinson-like symptoms in Balb/c mice. Given the known potential of both the herbal extracts in improving Parkinson-like symptoms, we expected the combination of the two to show better results than either of the two but surprisingly there was no additivity in either oxidative stress or behavioural recovery. In fact, in some assays, the combination performed worse than either of the two individual constituents. This effect of mixtures highlights the need of testing mixtures in supplements market using enthomedicine. The necessity of comparing multiple groups in this study to get most information from the experiments motivated us to design a ladder-like visualization to show comparison with different groups that we call complete comparison display (CCD). In summary, we show the potential of Centella asiatica and Withania somnifera to ameliorate Parkinson’s disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2616276679,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common chronic disease associated with high levels of serum uric acid (SUA). However, whether this relationship applies in obese subjects has been unclear, and no cohort study has previously been conducted in non-obese subjects. We therefore performed a retrospective cohort study among employees of seven companies in China to investigate whether hyperuricemia was independently associated with NAFLD in obese and non-obese subjects, respectively. A total of 2383 initially NAFLD-free subjects were followed up for four years, and 15.2% (363/2383) developed NAFLD. Hyperuricemia subjects had a higher cumulative incidence than did those with normouricemia (29.0% vs. 12.9%, P<0.001). Cox proportional hazard regression analyses showed that baseline hyperuricemia was significantly associated with risk of developing NAFLD in non-obese subjects. This relationship was significantly independent of baseline age, gender, metabolic syndrome components, and other clinical variables (RR = 1.389, 95%CI: 1.051–2.099). However, this association did not exist in obese subjects (RR = 1.010, 95%CI: 0.649–1.571). The independent effect of hyperuricemia on NAFLD was stronger in females (RR = 2.138, 95%CI: 1.050–4.355) than in males (RR = 1.435, 95%CI: 1.021–2.018). In conclusion, further studies are needed to explore the different mechanisms between obese and non-obese subjects, and the reason hyperuricemia raises NAFLD risk in females more than in males."
https://openalex.org/W2614566419,"Enduring host-microbiome relationships are based on adaptive strategies within a particular ecological niche. Tannerella forsythia is a dysbiotic member of the human oral microbiome that inhabits periodontal pockets and contributes to chronic periodontitis. To counteract endopeptidases from the host or microbial competitors, T. forsythia possesses a serpin-type proteinase inhibitor called miropin. Although serpins from animals, plants, and viruses have been widely studied, those from prokaryotes have received only limited attention. Here we show that miropin uses the serpin-type suicidal mechanism. We found that, similar to a snap trap, the protein transits from a metastable native form to a relaxed triggered or induced form after cleavage of a reactive-site target bond in an exposed reactive-center loop. The prey peptidase becomes covalently attached to the inhibitor, is dragged 75 Å apart, and is irreversibly inhibited. This coincides with a large conformational rearrangement of miropin, which inserts the segment upstream of the cleavage site as an extra β-strand in a central β-sheet. Standard serpins possess a single target bond and inhibit selected endopeptidases of particular specificity and class. In contrast, miropin uniquely blocked many serine and cysteine endopeptidases of disparate architecture and substrate specificity owing to several potential target bonds within the reactive-center loop and to plasticity in accommodating extra β-strands of variable length. Phylogenetic studies revealed a patchy distribution of bacterial serpins incompatible with a vertical descent model. This finding suggests that miropin was acquired from the host through horizontal gene transfer, perhaps facilitated by the long and intimate association of T. forsythia with the human gingiva.

Therefore, this study was conducted to address the proportion of GMP services and associated factors among children under two years of age in rural communities of Mareka district, Southern Ethiopia. Community based cross-sectional survey was conducted from August to September 2015. Single population proportion formula was used to determine the sample size with multi stage sampling technique. A total of 819 children under two years of age were included. Pretest was done on 10% of the total sample size. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.0 software. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions used to analyze data. The response rate was 95%. Utilization of GMP services was 16.9%.

Octaheme nitrite reductases (ONRs) from haloalkaliphilic bacteria of genus Thioalkalivibrio are stable and active in a wide range of pH (up to 11) and salinity (up to 1 M NaCl). To establish adaptation mechanisms of ONRs from haloalkaliphilic bacteria a comparative analysis of amino acid sequences and structures of ONRs from haloalkaliphilic bacteria and their homologues from non-halophilic neutrophilic bacteria was performed. The following adaptation strategies were observed: (1) strategies specific for halophilic and alkaliphilic proteins (an increase in the number of aspartate and glutamate residues and a decrease in the number of lysine residues on the protein surface), (2) strategies specific for halophilic proteins (an increase in the arginine content and a decrease in the number of hydrophobic residues on the solvent-accessible protein surface), (3) strategies specific for alkaliphilic proteins (an increase in the area of intersubunit hydrophobic contacts). Unique adaptation mechanism inherent in the ONRs from bacteria of genus Thioalkalivibrio was revealed (an increase in the core in the number of tryptophan and phenylalanine residues, and an increase in the number of small side chain residues, such as alanine and valine, in the core)."

This screen revealed six putative ZIKV-positive samples by ELISA. These results could not be confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assays or virus neutralization tests. Four of these six samples were also positive for P. falciparum. We noted that the frequency of malaria positivity was higher in ZIKV-ELISA positive samples (50% and 100% in the two study sites) than ZIKV-negative samples (17% and 10%, respectively), suggesting that malaria may have led to false ZIKV-ELISA positives."
https://openalex.org/W2614267995,"The nuclear acetyltransferase MOF (KAT8 in mammals) is a subunit of at least two multi-component complexes involved in transcription regulation. In the context of complexes of the ‘Non-Specific-Lethal’ (NSL) type it controls transcription initiation of many nuclear housekeeping genes and of mitochondrial genes. While this function is conserved in metazoans, MOF has an additional, specific function in Drosophila in the context of dosage compensation. As a subunit of the male-specific-lethal dosage compensation complex (MSL-DCC) it contributes to the doubling of transcription output from the single male X chromosome by acetylating histone H4. Proper dosage compensation requires finely tuned levels of MSL-DCC and an appropriate distribution of MOF between the regulatory complexes. The amounts of DCC formed depends directly on the levels of the male-specific MSL2, which orchestrates the assembly of the DCC, including MOF recruitment. We found earlier that MSL2 is an E3 ligase that ubiquitylates most MSL proteins, including MOF, suggesting that ubiquitylation may contribute to a quality control of MOF’s overall levels and folding state as well as its partitioning between the complex entities. We now used mass spectrometry to map the lysines in MOF that are ubiquitylated by MSL2 in vitro and identified in vivo ubiquitylation sites of MOF in male and female cells. MSL2-specific ubiquitylation in vivo could not be traced due to the dominance of other, sex-independent ubiquitylation events and conceivably may be rare or transient. Expressing appropriately mutated MOF derivatives we assessed the importance of the ubiquitylated lysines for dosage compensation by monitoring DCC formation and X chromosome targeting in cultured cells, and by genetic complementation of the male-specific-lethal mof2 allele in flies. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of MOF ubiquitylation as a reference for future studies."

https://openalex.org/W2616376928,"Several human diseases have been associated with mutations in mitochondrial genes comprising a set of confirmed and reported mutations according to the MITOMAP database. An analysis of complete mitogenomes across 139 primate species showed that most confirmed disease-associated mutations occurred in aligned codon positions and gene regions under strong purifying selection resulting in a strong evolutionary conservation. Only two confirmed variants (7.1%), coding for the same amino acids accounting for severe human diseases, were identified without apparent pathogenicity in non-human primates, like the closely related Bornean orangutan. Conversely, reported disease-associated mutations were not especially concentrated in conserved codon positions, and a large fraction of them occurred in highly variable ones. Additionally, 88 (45.8%) of reported mutations showed similar variants in several non-human primates and some of them have been present in extinct species of the genus Homo. Considering that recurrent mutations leading to persistent variants throughout the evolutionary diversification of primates are less likely to be severely damaging to fitness, we suggest that these 88 mutations are less likely to be pathogenic. Conversely, 69 (35.9%) of reported disease-associated mutations occurred in extremely conserved aligned codon positions which makes them more likely to damage the primate mitochondrial physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2616278272,"The oligosaccharyltransferase complex, localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells, is responsible for the N-linked glycosylation of numerous protein substrates. The membrane protein STT3 is a highly conserved part of the oligosaccharyltransferase and likely contains the active site of the complex. However, understanding the catalytic determinants of this system has been challenging, in part because of a discrepancy in the structural topology of the bacterial versus eukaryotic proteins and incomplete information about the mechanism of membrane integration. Here, we use a glycosylation mapping approach to investigate these questions. We measured the membrane integration efficiency of the mouse STT3-A and yeast Stt3p transmembrane domains (TMDs) and report a refined topology of the N-terminal half of the mouse STT3-A. Our results show that most of the STT3 TMDs are well inserted into the ER membrane on their own or in the presence of the natural flanking residues. However, for the mouse STT3-A hydrophobic domains 4 and 6 and yeast Stt3p domains 2, 3a, 3c, and 6 we measured reduced insertion efficiency into the ER membrane. Furthermore, we mapped the first half of the STT3-A protein, finding two extra hydrophobic domains between the third and the fourth TMD. This result indicates that the eukaryotic STT3 has 13 transmembrane domains, consistent with the structure of the bacterial homolog of STT3 and setting the stage for future combined efforts to interrogate this fascinating system."

To calculate the heritability of T1D we used the Haseman-Elston regression analysis of the squared difference between the phenotypes of the pairs of siblings on the estimate of their genome-wide IBD proportion. The model with only 3 SNPs achieving an AUC of 0.75 in both datasets outperformed the model using the presence of the high-risk DR3/4 HLA genotype, namely AUC of 0.60.

The genetic diversity of C. externa, analyzed by AMOVA using the COI and 16S rRNA genes as mitochondrial markers, showed significant haplotype structure arising from genetic differences that was not associated with sampling location. This was reflected in the network grouping. Bayesian inference showed that haplotype distribution may have its origins in C. externa divergence into two distinct clades, which dispersed to various locations, and their subsequent diversification. The evolutionary history of C. externa may include multiple ancestral haplotypes differentiating within the same geographic area to generate the current broad genetic diversity, so that the earlier geographical history has been erased, and now we have highlighted its more recent genetic history."

Lymphoid follicles (LFs) are usually observed during the histological examination of LPDs. Currently, because there is a lack of specific clinical signs and diagnostic immunohistochemical biomarkers, it is difficult for pathologists to distinguish MALToma from ocular RFH and ALH, which makes the clinical management of these conditions difficult. Here, we analyzed the clinical features of patients with ocular adnexal LPDs (n = 125) and investigated the structure of LFs in paraffin-embedded tissue samples using anti-CD23 and anti-IgD immunochemistry. We found that some clinical features including age, sex, and laterality were different among RFH, LFH, and MALToma. Additionally, immunohistochemistry revealed that the expression of IgD and CD23 was higher in RFH patients and decreased in patients with ALH and MALToma. Moreover, LFs in RFH were intact, whereas the structures of most LFs were disrupted in ALH. In MALToma specimens, few intact LFs were observed. In a further investigation, we combined the results for CD23/IgD immunohistochemistry and the structure of LFs to establish a scoring method for the differential diagnosis of LPDs. According to the BIOMED-2 protocol, we further detected IgH gene monoclonal rearrangement in 73 cases (35 RFH, 17 ALH, and 21 MALToma cases). The sensitivity of our scoring method, based on a comparison with the results of IgH gene monoclonal rearrangement detection, was 85.7% (18/21) for MALToma and 35.3% (6/17) for ALH. Our study provides a method that may be useful for the differential diagnosis of RFH, ALH, and MALToma."

Together with TCOM, SNCAM considers the spatial neighborhood contributions to calculate the pattern-matching degree between the specified marine parameters and the table-formatted frequent patterns and then explores the marine spatial patterns. Using the prevalent quantification Apriori algorithm and a real remote sensing dataset from January 1998 to December 2014, a successful application of TAXMarSP to marine spatial patterns in the Pacific Ocean is described, and the obtained marine spatial patterns present not only the well-known but also new patterns to Earth scientists."
