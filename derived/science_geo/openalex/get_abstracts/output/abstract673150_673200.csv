https://openalex.org/W3158748765,"SARS-CoV-2 vaccine rollout has coincided with the spread of variants of concern. We investigated if single dose vaccination, with or without prior infection, confers cross protective immunity to variants. We analyzed T and B cell responses after first dose vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 in healthcare workers (HCW) followed longitudinally, with or without prior Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 infection. After one dose, individuals with prior infection showed enhanced T cell immunity, antibody secreting memory B cell response to spike and neutralizing antibodies effective against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. By comparison, HCW receiving one vaccine dose without prior infection showed reduced immunity against variants. B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 spike mutations resulted in increased, abrogated or unchanged T cell responses depending on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms. Single dose vaccination with BNT162b2 in the context of prior infection with a heterologous variant substantially enhances neutralizing antibody responses against variants."
https://openalex.org/W3158914043,"Genetic studies have revealed many variant loci that are associated with immune-mediated diseases. To elucidate the disease pathogenesis, it is essential to understand the function of these variants, especially under disease-associated conditions. Here, we performed a large-scale immune cell gene-expression analysis, together with whole-genome sequence analysis. Our dataset consists of 28 distinct immune cell subsets from 337 patients diagnosed with 10 categories of immune-mediated diseases and 79 healthy volunteers. Our dataset captured distinctive gene-expression profiles across immune cell types and diseases. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis revealed dynamic variations of eQTL effects in the context of immunological conditions, as well as cell types. These cell-type-specific and context-dependent eQTLs showed significant enrichment in immune disease-associated genetic variants, and they implicated the disease-relevant cell types, genes, and environment. This atlas deepens our understanding of the immunogenetic functions of disease-associated variants under in vivo disease conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3157400350,"The choroid plexus (ChP) in each brain ventricle produces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and forms the blood-CSF barrier. Here, we construct a single-cell and spatial atlas of each ChP in the developing, adult, and aged mouse brain. We delineate diverse cell types, subtypes, cell states, and expression programs in epithelial and mesenchymal cells across ages and ventricles. In the developing ChP, we predict a common progenitor pool for epithelial and neuronal cells, validated by lineage tracing. Epithelial and fibroblast cells show regionalized expression by ventricle, starting at embryonic stages and persisting with age, with a dramatic transcriptional shift with maturation, and a smaller shift in each aged cell type. With aging, epithelial cells upregulate host-defense programs, and resident macrophages upregulate interleukin-1β (IL-1β) signaling genes. Our atlas reveals cellular diversity, architecture and signaling across ventricles during development, maturation, and aging of the ChP-brain barrier."
https://openalex.org/W3159883015,"Mouse embryonic development is a canonical model system for studying mammalian cell fate acquisition. Recently, single-cell atlases comprehensively charted embryonic transcriptional landscapes, yet inference of the coordinated dynamics of cells over such atlases remains challenging. Here, we introduce a temporal model for mouse gastrulation, consisting of data from 153 individually sampled embryos spanning 36 h of molecular diversification. Using algorithms and precise timing, we infer differentiation flows and lineage specification dynamics over the embryonic transcriptional manifold. Rapid transcriptional bifurcations characterize the commitment of early specialized node and blood cells. However, for most lineages, we observe combinatorial multi-furcation dynamics rather than hierarchical transcriptional transitions. In the mesoderm, dozens of transcription factors combinatorially regulate multifurcations, as we exemplify using time-matched chimeric embryos of Foxc1/Foxc2 mutants. Our study rejects the notion of differentiation being governed by a series of binary choices, providing an alternative quantitative model for cell fate acquisition."
https://openalex.org/W3159776513,"The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification is used widely to alter the fate of mRNAs. Here we demonstrate that the C. elegans writer METT-10 (the ortholog of mouse METTL16) deposits an m6A mark on the 3' splice site (AG) of the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthetase pre-mRNA, which inhibits its proper splicing and protein production. The mechanism is triggered by a rich diet and acts as an m6A-mediated switch to stop SAM production and regulate its homeostasis. Although the mammalian SAM synthetase pre-mRNA is not regulated via this mechanism, we show that splicing inhibition by 3' splice site m6A is conserved in mammals. The modification functions by physically preventing the essential splicing factor U2AF35 from recognizing the 3' splice site. We propose that use of splice-site m6A is an ancient mechanism for splicing regulation."

Development and homeostasis require cells to discriminate between signals, many of which are received by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest class of vertebrate receptors and the targets of many therapeutic drugs (Hauser et al., 2017Hauser A.S.

Activating Gαs stimulates adenylyl cyclases to produce cyclic AMP (cAMP), whereas activating Gαi inhibits cAMP production (Pierce et al., 2002Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J.

A subset of GPCRs localize not to the plasma membrane, but to the membrane of the primary cilium, an organelle specialized for signal transduction and present on most vertebrate cells (Anvarian et al., 2019Anvarian Z.

The distinct lipid and protein composition of the cilium is maintained through a diffusion barrier at the ciliary base called the transition zone (Gonçalves and Pelletier, 2017Gonçalves J. Pelletier L. The ciliary transition zone: Finding the pieces and assembling the gate.Mol. Cells. 2017; 40: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). More than 30 different GPCRs localize to cilia, including SSTR3, GPR161, and MC4R, as well as the GPCR-related protein Smoothened (SMO) (Mykytyn and Askwith, 2017Mykytyn K. Askwith C.

SMO is the central component of the Hedgehog (HH) signal transduction pathway and, in vertebrates, functions at primary cilia to activate GLI transcriptional effectors (Bangs and Anderson, 2017Bangs F.

In addition to positive effectors of HH signal transduction, negative pathway regulators localize to cilia, including GPR161 (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2013Mukhopadhyay S. Wen X. Ratti N. Loktev A.

Apart from GPR161, both cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) negatively regulate HH signal transduction (Hammerschmidt et al., 1996Hammerschmidt M. Bitgood M.J. McMahon A.P.

HH signaling orchestrates diverse developmental and homeostatic processes, including patterning of somites (Fan and Tessier-Lavigne, 1994Fan C.-M. Tessier-Lavigne M.

Somites are segmental mesodermal aggregates that give rise to multiple cell types, including muscle (Blagden et al., 1997Blagden C.S. Currie P.D. Ingham P.W. Hughes S.M.

In zebrafish, the notochord produces Sonic hedgehog (Shh) that at high levels specifies muscle pioneers (MPs) that express the transcription factors Engrailed (En) and Prox1 and at lower levels specifies superficial slow fibers (SSFs) that express the transcription factor Prox1 alone (Barresi et al., 2000Barresi M.J.

Despite the many signals communicated through cAMP, cells distinguish these signals in order to impart distinct effects (Calebiro and Koszegi, 2019Calebiro D. Koszegi Z.

Discrete microdomains with high concentration of cAMP in stimulated rat neonatal cardiac myocytes.Science. 2002; 295: 1711-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). For example, epinephrine and prostaglandin E1 induce similar increases in cAMP and PKA activity in cardiomyocytes, but only epinephrine induces troponin I phosphorylation and increases contractility (Brunton et al., 1979Brunton L.L.

Pharmacol. 1979; 15: 235-245PubMed Google Scholar). How cells distinguish information produced by signals that induce a shared diffusible second messenger is poorly understood. One suggestion has been that different receptors form stable complexes with dedicated effectors (Tolkovsky and Levitzki, 1978aTolkovsky A.M. Levitzki A. Coupling of a single adenylate cyclase to two receptors: adenosine and catecholamine.Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3811-3817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Tolkovsky and Levitzki, 1978bTolkovsky A.M. Levitzki A. Mode of coupling between the β-adrenergic receptor and adenylate cyclase in turkey erythrocytes.Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3795-3810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another hypothesis is that different signals are transduced in distinct subcellular domains (Buxton and Brunton, 1983Buxton I.L.O. Brunton L.L. Compartments of cyclic AMP and protein kinase in mammalian cardiomyocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10233-10239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular domains with differential GPCR activity include lipid nanodomains and clathrin-associated hotspots within the plasma membrane (Agarwal et al., 2014Agarwal S.R. Yang P.-C. Rice M.

Single-molecule imaging reveals receptor-G protein interactions at cell surface hot spots.Nature. 2017; 550: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that physically sequestering signaling pathways to either the cilium or the cell body allows parallel information processing without crosstalk. To test whether cells distinguish ciliary and nonciliary cAMP, we generated optogenetic and chemogenetic tools to specifically manipulate ciliary and nonciliary cAMP levels. To assess whether cAMP generated inside or outside cilia communicate different information, we developed an optogenetic system based on a bacterial photoactivatable adenylyl cyclase (bPAC) (Figure 1A) (Stierl et al., 2011Stierl M. Stumpf P. Udwari D. Gueta R. Hagedorn R. Losi A. Gärtner W. Petereit L. Efetova M. Schwarzel M. et al.Light modulation of cellular cAMP by a small bacterial photoactivated adenylyl cyclase, bPAC, of the soil bacterium Beggiatoa.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1181-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). bPAC generates cAMP in proportion to the amount of blue light delivered. We generated transgenic zebrafish that express either MYC-tagged cytoplasmic bPAC (Cyto-bPAC) or MYC-tagged ARL13B-bPAC (Cilia-bPAC) to investigate the functions of cytosolic and ciliary cAMP during vertebrate development. Immunofluorescence imaging of Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC in zebrafish embryos revealed that, as expected, Cyto-bPAC localized to the cytoplasm and Cilia-bPAC localized to the cilium (Figures 1B and S1A).Figure S1Light activation of Cilia-bPAC and Cyto-bPAC does not morphologically perturb development, related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Immunoblot for Myc-tagged Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC in 24hpf zebrafish embryo lysates. β-actin serves as a loading control.(B) Whole-mount brightfield images of transgenic Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC zebrafish embryos either raised in the dark or stimulated with blue light from 14-18 hours post fertilization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Immunoblot for Myc-tagged Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC in 24hpf zebrafish embryo lysates. β-actin serves as a loading control. (B) Whole-mount brightfield images of transgenic Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC zebrafish embryos either raised in the dark or stimulated with blue light from 14-18 hours post fertilization. To assess whether Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC embryos generate cAMP specifically on stimulation with blue light, we measured cAMP levels and found that Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC embryos raised in the dark contained levels of cAMP equivalent to those of wild-type embryos (Figure 1C). Treatment with the adenylyl cyclase agonist forskolin increased cAMP levels, as expected (Figure 1C). Similar to forskolin, blue light treatment induced equivalent amounts of cAMP in Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC transgenic embryos (Figure 1C). Transgenic embryos treated with light were morphologically indistinguishable from light-stimulated wild-type embryos or transgenic embryos raised in the dark, indicating that neither blue light nor the resultant cAMP grossly alters development (Figure S1B). Because cAMP negatively regulates HH signal transduction (Barresi et al., 2000Barresi M.J. Stickney H.L. Devoto S.H. The zebrafish slow-muscle-omittedgene product is required for Hedgehogsignal transduction and the development of slow muscle identit.Development. 2000; 27: 2189-2199Crossref Google Scholar; Wang et al., 1999Wang G. Wang B. Jiang J. Protein kinase A antagonizes Hedgehog signaling by regulating both the activator and repressor forms of Cubitus interruptus.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2828-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we investigated whether ciliary or cytoplasmic cAMP affect HH signal transduction. To begin to investigate HH signaling, we assessed Gli:mCherry, a previously described reporter that induces mCherry expression upon activation of HH signaling (Mich et al., 2014Mich J.K. Payumo A.Y. Rack P.G. Chen J.K. In vivo imaging of Hedgehog pathway activation with a nuclear fluorescent reporter.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e103661Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). As expected, treating zebrafish embryos with forskolin reduced Gli:mCherry expression in the developing somite (Figure 1D). Cilia-bPAC expression in the absence of light had no effect on Gli:mCherry expression (Figures 2A and 2B ), indicating that the ARL13B ciliary targeting sequence does not affect HH signaling. Notably, treating Cyto-bPAC transgenic zebrafish embryos with light had no effect on Gli:mCherry expression (Figures 2A and 2B). In striking contrast, activating Cilia-bPAC attenuated Gli:mCherry expression (Figures 2A and 2B). As another control for the dependence on ciliary localization, we created a version of Cilia-bPAC containing a missense mutation in human ARL13B that prevents ciliary localization, V359A (Gigante et al., 2020Gigante E.D. Taylor M.R. Ivanova A.A. Kahn R.A. Caspary T. ARL13B regulates Sonic hedgehog signaling from outside primary cilia.eLife. 2020; 9: e50434Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar; Higginbotham et al., 2012Higginbotham H. Eom T.Y. Mariani L.E.

Cell. 2012; 23: 925-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We injected mRNA encoding either MYC-tagged ARL13BV359A-bPAC (Nonciliary-bPAC) or Cilia-bPAC. As expected, Nonciliary-bPAC did not localize to cilia in zebrafish embryos and generates cAMP on blue light stimulation (Figures S2A and S2B). Similar to Cyto-bPAC, stimulating Nonciliary-bPAC-expressing embryos with blue light had no effect on Gli:mCherry expression (Figures S2C and S2D). In contrast, blue light stimulation of embryos injected with mRNA encoding Cilia-bPAC decreased Gli:mCherry expression (Figures S2C and S2D). Therefore, in developing somites, cAMP generated in cilia, but not outside cilia, preferentially affects HH signaling. In the developing zebrafish somite, HH signaling specifies slow muscle fiber types (Barresi et al., 2001Barresi M.J.F. D’Angelo J.A. Hernández L.P. Devoto S.H. Distinct mechanisms regulate slow-muscle development.Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1432-1438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar; Blagden et al., 1997Blagden C.S. Currie P.D.

Biol. 2003; 13: 1169-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). High levels of HH signaling specify high En- and Prox1-expressing MPs whereas lower levels specify Prox1-expressing SSFs. Attenuation of HH signaling therefore preferentially depletes MPs (Figure 2C). To test whether cytoplasmic or ciliary cAMP affect HH-dependent patterning, we quantified En- and Prox1-expressing somitic cells. Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC embryos raised in the dark produce numbers of En- and Prox1-expressing cells equivalent to those of wild-type embryos, confirming that the ARL13B ciliary targeting sequence does not affect HH signaling (Figures 2D–2F). Stimulating wild-type or Cyto-bPAC embryos with light did not alter the number of En- or Prox1-expressing somitic cells (Figures 2D–2F). In contrast, stimulating Cilia-bPAC embryos with light reduced the numbers of both En- and Prox1-expressing cells (Figures 2D–2F). Thus, HH-dependent cell fates in the developing somite are preferentially inhibited by ciliary, but not cytoplasmic, cAMP production. To test whether ciliary or cytoplasmic cAMP affect HH signaling in tissues beyond the somites, we examined how cAMP affects HH-dependent cell fates in the developing neural tube. In vertebrates, Shh produced in the notochord and medial floor plate patterns the ventral neural tube (Figure S2E) (Briscoe et al., 2000Briscoe J. Pierani A. Jessell T.M. Ericson J.

Two critical periods of Sonic Hedgehog signaling required for the specification of motor neuron identity.Cell. 1996; 87: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Lateral floor plate cells expressing nkx2.2b are specified by high HH signaling, and neighboring motor neuron progenitor cells expressing olig2 are specified by lower HH signaling (Guner and Karlstrom, 2007Guner B. Karlstrom R.O. Cloning of zebrafish nkx6.2 and a comprehensive analysis of the conserved transcriptional response to Hedgehog/Gli signaling in the zebrafish neural tube.Gene Expr. Patterns. 2007; 7: 596-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar; Odenthal et al., 2000Odenthal J. van Eeden F.J.M. Haffter P. Ingham P.W. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Two distinct cell populations in the floor plate of the zebrafish are induced by different pathways.Dev. Biol. 2000; 219: 350-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). As in somite development, neither embryos expressing Cyto-bPAC and stimulated with light nor embryos expressing Cilia-bPAC and raised in the dark exhibited perturbation of HH-mediated patterning of the neural tube (Figures S2F and S2G). In contrast, Cilia-bPAC embryos treated with light exhibited decreased expression of both nkx2.2b and olig2 (Figures S2F and S2G). Thus, in neural tube patterning, as in somite patterning, cilium-generated cAMP but not cytoplasm-generated cAMP preferentially inhibits HH signaling. We conclude that zebrafish cells interpret cAMP generated in the cilium differently from cAMP generated in the cytoplasm. To assess whether mammalian cells also differentially interpret cilium- and cytoplasm-generated cAMP, we generated NIH/3T3 cell lines stably expressing either GFP-tagged Cyto-bPAC or Cilia-bPAC. Immunofluorescence imaging revealed that, as in zebrafish, Cyto-bPAC localized to the cytoplasm and Cilia-bPAC localized to the cilium (Figure 3A). Immunoblot revealed that Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC are expressed at comparable levels (Figure 3B). Blue light stimulation of Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC cell lines generated similar levels of cAMP, as measured by ELISA (Figure 3C). Because cAMP is highly diffusible and no membrane barrier exists between the cilium and the cytoplasm (Marley et al., 2013Marley A. Choy R.W.-Y. von Zastrow M. GPR88 reveals a discrete function of primary cilia as selective insulators of GPCR cross-talk.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e70857Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we predicted that cAMP generated in the cilium can enter the cytoplasm and vice versa. To test this hypothesis, we visualized cAMP dynamics in the cilium and cytoplasm upon Cyto-bPAC or Cilia-bPAC activation. To record cAMP levels independent of blue light stimulation of bPAC, we utilized a red fluorescent cAMP indicator, Pink Flamindo (pink fluorescent cAMP indicator) (Harada et al., 2017Harada K. Ito M. Wang X. Tanaka M. Wongso D. Konno A. Hirai H. Hirase H. Tsuboi T. Kitaguchi T. Red fluorescent protein-based cAMP indicator applicable to optogenetics and in vivo imaging.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). cAMP increases Pink Flamindo fluorescence and, as expected, stimulating Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC with blue light induced similar increases in Pink Flamindo fluorescence (Figure S3A). To generate a ratiometric cAMP biosensor targeted to cilia, we fused it to RAB23 Q68L, which constitutively localizes to cilia, and a far-red fluorescent protein mIFP to generate Ciliary Pink Flamindo (Lim and Tang, 2015Lim Y.S. Tang B.L. A role for Rab23 in the trafficking of Kif17 to the primary cilium.J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128: 2996-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar; Yu et al., 2015Yu D. Baird M.A. Allen J.R. Howe E.S. Klassen M.P. Reade A. Makhijani K. Song Y. Liu S. Murthy Z. et al.A naturally monomeric infrared fluorescent protein for protein labeling in vivo.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 763-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, forskolin increased the ratio of Pink Flamindo to mIFP fluorescence at the cilium (Figures S3B and S3C). To measure cAMP diffusion between the cytoplasm and cilium, we deployed Ciliary Pink Flamindo in Cyto-bPAC and Cilia-bPAC cells. Consistent with the absence of barriers to cAMP diffusion between the cytoplasm and the cilium, stimulating Cyto-bPAC increased Ciliary Pink Flamindo fluorescence (Figure 3D). Interestingly, Cyto-bPAC activation did not increase Ciliary Pink Flamindo fluorescence to the same levels as did Cilia-bPAC activation (Figure 3D). Thus, cAMP produced in the cytoplasm diffuses into the cilium but does not reach levels equivalent to those caused by local production. As cilium-generated cAMP specifically inhibits HH-dependent patterning in zebrafish embryos, we investigated whether cilium-generated or cytoplasm-generated cAMP inhibits HH signal transduction in mammalian cells. To this end, we treated wild-type, Cyto-bPAC- or Cilia-bPAC-expressing cells with the Smoothened agonist SAG. Each cell line equivalently induced Gli1, a HH target gene, in response to SAG, indicating that neither unstimulated bPAC nor its ciliary targeting sequence perturbs HH signaling (Figures 3E and 3F). Stimulating Cyto-bPAC-expressing cells with blue light had no effect on SAG-mediated induction of Gli1 (Figures 3E and 3F). In contrast, stimulating Cilia-bPAC-expressing cells with blue light inhibited SAG-mediated induction of Gli1 (Figures 3E and 3F). Thus, as in zebrafish, cilium-produced cAMP preferentially inhibits HH signal transduction in mammalian cells. To investigate how cilium-produced cAMP preferentially inhibits HH signal transduction, we examined whether cAMP affects the trafficking of SMO and GPR161 at cilia. In the absence of HH stimulation, the GPCR GPR161 accumulates in cilia (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2013Mukhopadhyay S. Wen X. Ratti N. Loktev A. Rangell L. Scales S.J. Jackson P.K. The ciliary G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr161 negatively regulates the Sonic hedgehog pathway via cAMP signaling.Cell. 2013; 152: 210-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Addition of HH ligand causes coordinated trafficking of SMO into cilia and GPR161 out of cilia (Corbit et al., 2005Corbit K.C. Aanstad P. Singla V. Norman A.R. Stainier D.Y.R. Reiter J.F. Vertebrate Smoothened functions at the primary cilium.Nature. 2005; 437: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar; Pal et al., 2016Pal K. Hwang S.H. Somatilaka B. Badgandi H. Jackson P.K. DeFea K. Mukhopadhyay S. Smoothened determines β-arrestin-mediated removal of the G protein-coupled receptor Gpr161 from the primary cilium.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 212: 861-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether ciliary cAMP impacts trafficking of SMO or GPR161 to or from cilia, we quantified SMO and GPR161 fluorescence at the cilium in wild-type, Cyto-bPAC, and Cilia-bPAC-expressing cells, both with and without SAG. SMO robustly localized to cilia in the presence of SAG (Figures S3D and S3E). Stimulation of wild-type, Cyto-bPAC, or Cilia-bPAC cells with blue light did not attenuate SAG-induced ciliary localization of SMO (Figures S3D and S3E). GPR161 localized to cilia in vehicle (DMSO)-treated cells and not on SAG treatment (Figures S3F and S3G). Stimulation of wild-type, Cyto-bPAC, and Cilia-bPAC cells with blue light in the presence of SAG did not attenuate GPR161 exit from cilia (Figures S3F and S3G). Therefore, ciliary cAMP does not affect the regulated ciliary trafficking of SMO or GPR161. In the absence of HH, GLI3 is proteolytically processed to form GLI3R, a truncated form that functions as a transcriptional repressor of HH transcriptional targets (Dai et al., 1999Dai P. Akimaru H.

https://openalex.org/W3158739162,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), pathological forms of tau are transferred from cell to cell and seed aggregation of cytoplasmic tau. Phosphorylation of tau plays a key role in neurodegenerative tauopathies. In addition, apolipoprotein E (apoE), a major component of lipoproteins in the brain, is a genetic risk determinant for AD. The identification of the apoE receptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), as an endocytic receptor for tau raises several questions about the role of LRP1 in tauopathies: is internalized tau, like other LRP1 ligands, delivered to lysosomes for degradation, and does LRP1 internalize pathological tau leading to cytosolic seeding? We found that LRP1 rapidly internalizes 125I-labeled tau, which is then efficiently degraded in lysosomal compartments. Surface plasmon resonance experiments confirm high affinity binding of tau and the tau microtubule-binding domain to LRP1. Interestingly, phosphorylated forms of recombinant tau bind weakly to LRP1 and are less efficiently internalized by LRP1. LRP1-mediated uptake of tau is inhibited by apoE, with the apoE4 isoform being the most potent inhibitor, likely because of its higher affinity for LRP1. Employing post-translationally-modified tau derived from brain lysates of human AD brain tissue, we found that LRP1-expressing cells, but not LRP1-deficient cells, promote cytosolic tau seeding in a process enhanced by apoE. These studies identify LRP1 as an endocytic receptor that binds and processes monomeric forms of tau leading to its degradation and promotes seeding by pathological forms of tau. The balance of these processes may be fundamental to the spread of neuropathology across the brain in AD."
https://openalex.org/W3157094008,"Background The world is being challenged by the COVID-19 outbreak that resulted in a universal concern and economic hardship. It is a leading public health emergency across the globe in general and developing countries in particular. Strengthening good preventive behavior is the best way to tackle such pandemics. Objective The study assessed preventive behavior and associated factors towards COVID-19 among residents of Qellam Wallaga Zone, Oromia Region, Ethiopia, 2020. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted with a multistage sampling technique. Data were collected by interview and analyzed using SPSS version 23.0. Binomial logistic regression was used to test the association between the variables. An Adjusted Prevalence with 95% CI was used to express the associations and interpret the findings. Results Among 634 participants, 417(65.8%) were from urban residences, and 347 (54.7%) belongs to a female. Age ranges 18 years through 87 years. Only 68(10.7%) participants showed good preventive behavior for COVID-19. The majority of them (84.7%) perceived that the disease is very dangerous and 450(71.0%) of them believe that they are at high risk. More than 17% of the respondents have sufficient knowledge. Respondents with sufficient knowledge about COVID-19 were about 2 times more likely to exercise good preventive behavior compare to those with insufficient knowledge, [(APR: 2.1; 95% CI: [1.2, 3.9)]. The urban residents was 3.3 more than that of rural residents to practice good preventive behavior, [(APR: 3.3; 95% CI: [1.6, 6.4)]. Respondents who use social media as a source of information were more than 2 times more likely to have good preventive behavior compared to those who did not, [(APR: 2.3; 95% CI: [1.3, 3.4)]. Conclusion Adoptions of COVID-19 preventive behavior in the study population is very low. Due emphasis should be given to rural residents. Risk communication activities should be strengthened through effective community engagement to slow down and stop the transmssion of the disease in the community."
https://openalex.org/W3157460041,"The Cdk8 kinase module (CKM) is a dissociable part of the coactivator complex mediator, which regulates gene transcription by RNA polymerase II. The CKM has both negative and positive functions in gene transcription that remain poorly understood at the mechanistic level. In order to reconstitute the role of the CKM in transcription initiation, we prepared recombinant CKM from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We showed that CKM bound to the core mediator (cMed) complex, sterically inhibiting cMed from binding to the polymerase II preinitiation complex (PIC) in vitro. We further showed that the Cdk8 kinase activity of the CKM weakened CKM–cMed interaction, thereby facilitating dissociation of the CKM and enabling mediator to bind the PIC in order to stimulate transcription initiation. Finally, we report that the kinase activity of Cdk8 is required for gene activation during the stressful condition of heat shock in vivo but not under steady-state growth conditions. Based on these results, we propose a model in which the CKM negatively regulates mediator function at upstream-activating sequences by preventing mediator binding to the PIC at the gene promoter. However, during gene activation in response to stress, the Cdk8 kinase activity of the CKM may release mediator and allow its binding to the PIC, thereby accounting for the positive function of CKM. This may impart improved adaptability to stress by allowing a rapid transcriptional response to environmental changes, and we speculate that a similar mechanism in metazoans may allow the precise timing of developmental transcription programs.

This may impart improved adaptability to stress by allowing a rapid transcriptional response to environmental changes, and we speculate that a similar mechanism in metazoans may allow the precise timing of developmental transcription programs. Transcription of protein-coding genes begins when RNA polymerase II (pol II) and the general transcription factors (TFs)—IIA, IIB, IID (or the TATA box–binding protein [TBP]), IIE, IIF, and IIH—assemble at gene promoters to form a preinitiation complex (PIC). The PIC bends and unwinds promoter DNA and positions the pol II active center at the transcription start site (TSS) for initiation of DNA-templated RNA synthesis. Whereas PICs across different gene promoters are likely to be similar, diversification of transcriptional outputs is mainly achieved by binding of gene-specific TFs to upstream activation sequences (UASs) in yeast or to enhancers in metazoan cells. TFs that are bound to UASs or enhancers communicate their signals through coactivator complexes such as mediator and the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase complex. These coactivators are large and modular complexes providing a plethora of possibilities to accommodate interactions with hundreds of different gene-specific TFs (1Hahn S. Young E.T. Transcriptional regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Transcription factor regulation and function, mechanisms of initiation, and roles of activators and coactivators.Genetics. 2011; 189: 705-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Coactivators may facilitate chromatin accessibility, modulate the frequency of PIC formation events, or stabilize PICs to favor their formation and/or dissociation and release of pol II into productive transcription. The mediator complex is a general coactivator and has a molecular weight of over 1 MDa. Mediator is composed of 25 subunits in yeast and 30 subunits in human (2Verger A. Monté D. Villeret V. Twenty years of mediator complex structural studies.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2019; 47: 399-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).

The human CDK8 subcomplex is a molecular switch that controls mediator coactivator function.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), but this has not been shown directly in a highly defined biochemical system. Also, it is not understood how the effects of Cdk8 kinase activity on gene expression relate to changes in the interactions between mediator, CKM, and the PIC. Here, we reconstitute an in vitro system to show that the CKM sterically inhibits cMed binding to the PIC, and that CKM-dependent phosphorylation releases this steric inhibition. Our data show that while CKM sterically represses transcription, its Cdk8 kinase activity releases this repression and enables gene activation. A hurdle toward the biochemical characterization of the CKM was obtaining the complex in sufficient quality and quantity. We established a method for heterologous coexpression of the complete yeast CKM (Fig. 1A) from a single vector in insect cells using a baculovirus-based expression system and its subsequent affinity purification (see Experimental procedures section). We prepared two variants of the CKM module. The first variant contains the catalytically active Cdk8 subunit (CKM(A)), and the second variant contains the kinase-dead Cdk8 mutation D286A (CKM(KD)). Both variants behaved similarly in biochemical purification (Fig. S1). Purified CKM(A) readily phosphorylated the pol II CTD on both serine-2 and serine-5 residues (Fig. 1C). These results show that our recombinant CKM module was active as a kinase on a natural substrate. We next performed negative stain EM on CKM(KD). We fixed the complex with glutaraldehyde during sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation according to the GraFix protocol (43Kastner B. Fischer N. Golas M.M. Sander B. Dube P. Boehringer D. Hartmuth K. Deckert J. Hauer F. Wolf E. GraFix: Sample preparation for single-particle electron cryomicroscopy.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 53Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and incubated complex-containing fractions on carbon foil–coated EM grids, stained with uranyl formate. EM analysis showed homogeneous particles, evenly distributed over the surface of the grid (Fig. 1D). 2D classes calculated from roughly 60,000 particles showed that the majority of the particles were intact, confirming the homogeneity and quality of the sample. An ab initio 3D model generated using CryoSparc SPA Cryo-EM Software Systems (44Punjani A. Rubinstein J.L. Fleet D.J. Brubaker M.A. cryoSPARC: Algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination.Nat.

Structural flexibility and functional interaction of mediator Cdk8 module.Protein Cell. 2013; 4: 911-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). While this article was under revision, a higher resolution CKM structure was also reported (46Li Y.-C. Chao T.-C. Kim H.J. Cholko T. Chen S.-F. Li G. Snyder L. Nakanishi K. Chang C.-e. Murakami K. Structure and noncanonical Cdk8 activation mechanism within an Argonaute-containing mediator kinase module.Sci. Adv. 2021; 7eabd4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We next tested whether the CKM can bind to the 16-subunit cMed, which we produced in recombinant form and at high homogeneity as described (7Plaschka C. Larivière L. Wenzeck L. Seizl M. Hemann M. Tegunov D. Petrotchenko E.V. Borchers C.H. Baumeister W. Herzog F. Villa E. Cramer P. Architecture of the RNA polymerase II–mediator core initiation complex.Nature. 2015; 518: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 8Schilbach S. Hantsche M. Tegunov D. Dienemann C. Wigge C. Urlaub H. Cramer P. Structures of transcription pre-initiation complex with TFIIH and mediator.Nature. 2017; 551: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Binding of the CKM to cMed was evident by a shift in the complex-containing fractions to higher density fractions upon sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation (Fig. 1F). These results show that recombinant CKM binds cMed in vitro. Having purified CKM and cMed at hand, we asked whether these complexes could bind to the pol II PIC. To test this, we set up an immobilized template assay (ITA) using a DNA scaffold containing a promoter sequence modeled on the yeast HIS4 promoter, with a TATA box and a TSS, as a platform for PIC assembly. Biotinylation on the DNA 3’ end allowed immobilization of the template on streptavidin beads, and an EcoRV restriction site downstream of the promoter sequence allowed elution by endonuclease cleavage. We could readily form PICs on the immobilized promoter template (Fig. 2A) providing a positive control. We then incubated CKM(A) or CKM(KD) with the immobilized template, purified cMed, and purified PIC components pol II, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TBP. We excluded TFIIH to reduce the complexity of the system to a single catalytic activity being tested. The restriction digestion elutions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to investigate what was bound to promoter DNA together with the PIC (Fig. 2A). In the presence of PIC components, cMed bound stoichiometrically to the PIC, as expected, but CKM did not bind, indicating that CKM was excluded from the PIC–cMed complex. This was true irrespective of whether CKM(A) alone, CKM(A) in the presence of ATP, or CKM(KD) in the presence of ATP was used. This demonstrates that CKM exclusion from the PIC–cMed complex is predominantly a steric effect, rather than an effect mediated by Cdk8 kinase activity. To corroborate these findings, we performed an in vitro competition assay with purified CKM(KD), cMed, and pol II. In this assay, we took advantage of the maltose binding protein (MBP) tag on the CKM. After binding of the CKM to beads, overstoichiometric amounts of cMed were added to ensure saturated binding. The beads were then copiously washed to remove any unbound cMed. Finally, wash buffer with increasing concentrations of pol II was added, and the washes were analyzed by Western blot analysis using an antibody against Med17, one of the subunits of cMed. We observed the presence of increasing amounts of Med17 with increasingly added pol II (Fig. 2B). This experiment showed that pol II competes with the CKM for cMed binding and implicated pol II as the PIC component responsible for preventing the incorporation of the CKM into the cMed–PIC complex. Thus, we provide direct biochemical evidence that CKM–cMed and PIC–cMed are mutually exclusive complexes. To investigate where on the cMed surface CKM binds, we subjected the CKM–cMed complex to chemical crosslinking coupled to MS (XL–MS). CKM and cMed were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, dialyzed into lower salt, and then crosslinked with 1 mM bis(sulfo)succinimidyl suberate (BS3), after having titrated the crosslinker concentration to a concentration just below complete crosslinking (see Experimental procedures section). The crosslinked complex was then analyzed on a native gel to separate the CKM–cMed complex from the two-component subcomplexes. CKM–cMed was extracted from the gel, trypsin digested, enriched for crosslinked peptides, and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. The analysis was carried out with a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 1%. The obtained crosslinking network (Fig. 3A) showed not only extensive crosslinking within the CKM and cMed subcomplexes but also several high confidence crosslinks between CKM and cMed. To validate the interaction map, crosslinks between cMed subunits, for which the structure is already known, were mapped onto the structure (Fig. S2C). Crosslinks used for validation are shown on the interaction map in black, together with the measured atomic distances (Fig. S2C). The appearance of many crosslinks within the expected distance constraints confirmed the validity of the crosslinking network. The high confidence crosslinks between the CKM and cMed were mapped onto the cMed structure and are indicated by red spheres and corresponding red lines on the interaction network (Fig. 3B). Crosslinks that could not be mapped because of their presence in flexible regions were assigned to the closest structured residue and are indicated by pink spheres and corresponding pink lines on the interaction network. Thus, pink spheres indicate approximate crosslinking locations, and red spheres indicate exact locations. Dashed lines connected to the spheres indicate the complementary residues on the CKM. Crosslinks for which more than one unique match was found are emphasized in bold face. We found that the vast majority of crosslinks between the CKM and cMed fall on the pol II-binding face of cMed, with a larger number of crosslinks to the cMed middle module than to the head. In particular, a clustering of crosslinking sites to the CKM subunits Med12 and Med13 is seen on the knob and hook domains of cMed. On the other hand, Cdk8 and CycC crosslink to the head module spine and moveable jaw, respectively. These results show that CKM binds on one side of cMed, the side that faces pol II in the PIC–cMed complex, suggesting that CKM and pol II sterically exclude each other in cMed binding. In Figure 3C, the pol II–cMed interaction within the PIC is shown. Pol II is rendered with low opacity to allow seeing through pol II into the pol II–cMed interface. The presence of crosslinks directly on, and in close spatial proximity to, this interface, suggests that pol II and the CKM share an overlapping binding surface on cMed, indicating that CKM sterically excludes cMed from binding the PIC. We next investigated the role of the kinase activity of the CKM. We set up a series of exploratory studies to identify novel phosphorylation targets of the CKM within transcription initiation complexes. We used phosphopeptide enrichment and MS to map and compare phosphorylation sites on CKM(KD) and CKM(A). We found that the CKM undergoes extensive intra-CKM phosphorylation in vitro. We mapped these sites onto the CKM subunits (Fig. 4A). Phosphorylation sites found only in the CKM(A) sample, but not in the CKM(KD) sample, and therefore attributed to intra-CKM phosphorylation by Cdk8, are represented in orange. Phosphorylation sites found on the CKM(KD) sample are represented in teal and are likely deposited by the insect cell expression host as they appear on both CKM(A) and CKM(KD). A large number of intra-CKM phosphorylation sites occur on the ∼500-residue unstructured insertion in the Med13 subunit (Fig. 4A). This insertion is conserved from yeast to human and is located near the interface involved in binding cMed (41Tsai K.L. Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Asturias F.J.

In mice, the superior colliculus innervates a set of targets that direct orienting and defensive actions. We combined functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) with optogenetics to reveal the network of brain regions functionally activated by four collicular cell types. Stimulating each neuronal group triggered different behaviors and activated distinct sets of brain nuclei. This included regions not previously thought to mediate defensive behaviors, for example, the posterior paralaminar nuclei of the thalamus (PPnT), which we show to play a role in suppressing habituation. Neuronal recordings with Neuropixels probes show that (1) patterns of spiking activity and fUSI signals correlate well in space and (2) neurons in downstream nuclei preferentially respond to innately threatening visual stimuli. This work provides insight into the functional organization of the networks governing innate behaviors and demonstrates an experimental approach to explore the whole-brain neuronal activity downstream of targeted cell types."
https://openalex.org/W3157147761,"It is estimated that about 1/4th of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions may be caused by the global food system. Reducing the GHG emissions from food production is a major challenge in the context of the projected growth of the world's population, which is increasing demand for food. In this context, the goal should be to achieve the lowest possible emission intensity of the food production system, understood as the amount of GHG emissions per unit of output. The study aimed to calculate the emission intensity of food production systems and to specify its determinants based on a panel regression model for 14 countries, which accounted for more than 65% of food production in the world between 2000 and 2014. In this article, emission intensity is defined as the amount of GHG emissions per value of global output. Research on the determinants of GHG emissions related to food production is well documented in the literature; however, there is a lack of research on the determinants of the emission intensity ratio for food production. Hence, the original contribution of this paper is the analysis of the determinants of GHG emissions intensity of food production systems. The study found the decreased of emission intensity from an average of more than 0.68 kg of CO2 equivalent per USD 1 worth of food production global output in 2000 to less than 0.46 in 2014. The determinants of emission intensity decrease included the yield of cereals, the use of nitrogen fertilizers, the agriculture material intensity, the Human Development Index, and the share of fossil fuel energy consumption in total energy use. The determinants of growth of emission intensity of food production systems included GDP per capita, population density, nitrogen fertilizer production, utilized agriculture area, share of animal production, and energy use per capita."

https://openalex.org/W3157477097,"Enzyme-mediated damage repair or mitigation, while common for nucleic acids, is rare for proteins. Examples of protein damage are elimination of phosphorylated Ser/Thr to dehydroalanine/dehydrobutyrine (Dha/Dhb) in pathogenesis and aging. Bacterial LanC enzymes use Dha/Dhb to form carbon-sulfur linkages in antimicrobial peptides, but the functions of eukaryotic LanC-like (LanCL) counterparts are unknown. We show that LanCLs catalyze the addition of glutathione to Dha/Dhb in proteins, driving irreversible C-glutathionylation. Chemo-enzymatic methods were developed to site-selectively incorporate Dha/Dhb at phospho-regulated sites in kinases. In human MAPK-MEK1, such ""elimination damage"" generated aberrantly activated kinases, which were deactivated by LanCL-mediated C-glutathionylation. Surveys of endogenous proteins bearing damage from elimination (the eliminylome) also suggest it is a source of electrophilic reactivity. LanCLs thus remove these reactive electrophiles and their potentially dysregulatory effects from the proteome. As knockout of LanCL in mice can result in premature death, repair of this kind of protein damage appears important physiologically."

In contrast to most quiescent cells that rely on the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation to harvest energy from glucose catabolism, rapidly dividing cells dial up glycolytic flux in a process referred to as the Warburg effect (1Warburg O. Posener K. Negelein E. On the metabolism of carcinoma cells.Biochem. Z. 1924; 152: 309-344Google Scholar). This metabolic switching is cued in part by growth factors and transforms mitochondria into central hubs for macromolecule precursor synthesis (2Ward P.S. Thompson C.B. Metabolic reprogramming: A cancer hallmark even Warburg did not anticipate.Cancer Cell. 2012; 21: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar). In this metabolically reprogrammed setting, mitochondrial ATP generation becomes secondary to its role in anabolic precursor synthesis. The regulatory levers that dial down flux through the electron transport chain (ETC), however, continue to be elucidated. H2S is a respiratory poison that targets complex IV (3Nicholls P. Kim J.K. Sulphide as an inhibitor and electron donor for the cytochrome c oxidase system.Can J. Biochem. 1982; 60: 613-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also an endogenously synthesized metabolite and a product of at least three enzymes in the sulfur metabolic network (4Banerjee R.

Two, cystathionine β-synthase and γ-cystathionase, are components of the transsulfuration pathway, which convert homocysteine to cysteine via cystathionine (6Chiku T. Padovani D. Zhu W. Singh S.

The third enzyme, mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase, resides in the catabolic arm of sulfur metabolism and converts 3-mercaptopyruvate to an enzyme-bound persulfide. The latter is transferred to a low-molecule-weight acceptor (e.g., cysteine) or to a protein thiol (e.g., on thioredoxin) from where H2S is subsequently eliminated (8Yadav P.K. Yamada K. Chiku T.

Alternatively, the persulfide can potentially undergo further transsulfuration via transfer to other acceptors. Quantitatively, the output of H2S versus cysteine from the transsulfuration pathway is unknown, and there is limited insight into how these competing catalytic activities are regulated (10Kabil O.

The physiological significance of endogenously produced H2S is underscored by the ubiquitous presence of the sulfide oxidation pathway. Based on the human protein atlas, the sulfide oxidation pathway enzymes are widely distributed rather than being restricted to epithelial tissue as might be expected for a detoxification pathway for dealing with environmental H2S. The mitochondrial location of this pathway, and its intersection with the ETC at two points, raises questions about whether its role is solely to detoxify H2S or potentially includes other functions, e.g., ETC regulation. H2S is redox active. It can react with oxidized cysteine thiols (e.g., sulfenic acid or disulfides) to form persulfides or undergo oxidative metabolism to form reactive sulfur species (20Filipovic M.R. Zivanovic J.

Much of the focus in the field of H2S redox signaling has been on protein persulfidation (23Mustafa A.K. Gadalla M.M. Sen N. Kim S. Mu W. Gazi S.K. Barrow R.K. Yang G. Wang R. Snyder S.H.

Adv. 2016; 2e1500968Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Specific and quantitatively significant persulfidation that is correlated with the functional regulation of a target protein in a cellular setting remains to be demonstrated. It is likely that protein persulfidation is a stochastic marking reflecting local or global oxidation events (26Kumar R. Banerjee R. Regulation of the redox metabolome and thiol proteome by hydrogen sulfide.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2021; : 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Although biosynthesis of a metabolite that functions as a respiratory poison presents a conundrum, its effect on complex IV remains the best characterized cellular effect of H2S to date. It is therefore instructive to consider H2S signaling in the context of redox metabolic programming that emanates from the ETC (26Kumar R. Banerjee R. Regulation of the redox metabolome and thiol proteome by hydrogen sulfide.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2021; : 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Studies examining the effects of H2S in cells typically involve its exogenous provision as a salt (e.g., Na2S) or as a “pro-drug” (e.g., GYY4137 (27Li L. Salto-Tellez M. Tan C.H. Whiteman M. Moore P.K. GYY4137, a novel hydrogen sulfide-releasing molecule, protects against endotoxic shock in the rat.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 47: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar)). Extracellular addition of H2S raises obvious concerns about physiological relevance, with the possible exception of epithelial cells such as colonocytes that are regularly exposed to high concentrations of H2S derived from microbial metabolism estimated to vary from 0.2 to 2.4 mM (28Macfarlane G.T. Gibson G.R. Cummings J.H. Comparison of fermentation reactions in different regions of the human colon.J. Appl. Bacteriol. 1992; 72: 57-64PubMed Google Scholar, 29Deplancke B. Finster K. Graham W.V. Collier C.T. Thurmond J.E. Gaskins H.R. Gastrointestinal and microbial responses to sulfate-supplemented drinking water in mice.Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2003; 228: 424-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The volatility of H2S often requires protracted exposure to repeated doses (e.g., 5–20 μM every 2 h for 5 days) to observe changes (30Lee Z.W. Teo X.Y. Tay E.Y. Tan C.H. Hagen T. Moore P.K. Deng L.W. Utilizing hydrogen sulfide as a novel anti-cancer agent by targeting cancer glycolysis and pH imbalance.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2014; 171: 4322-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Previously, we had observed the antiproliferative effect of H2S on malignant and nonmalignant colon epithelial cells by dosing with 100 or 300 μM Na2S every 12 h (31Libiad M. Vitvitsky V. Bostelaar T. Bak D.W. Lee H.J. Sakamoto N. Fearon E. Lyssiotis C.A. Weerapana E. Banerjee R. Hydrogen sulfide perturbs mitochondrial bioenergetics and triggers metabolic reprogramming in colon cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 12077-12090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the t1/2 of H2S under cell culture conditions, which is an important consideration due not only to its volatility but also to its ability to react with cystine and other oxidized thiols present in the culture medium. We had previously screened six human colorectal carcinoma cell lines and shown that they exhibit higher expression levels of SQOR, ETHE1, and TST compared with a nonmalignant colon epithelial cell line (31Libiad M. Vitvitsky V. Bostelaar T. Bak D.W. Lee H.J. Sakamoto N. Fearon E. Lyssiotis C.A. Weerapana E. Banerjee R. Hydrogen sulfide perturbs mitochondrial bioenergetics and triggers metabolic reprogramming in colon cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 12077-12090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We had also demonstrated that exogenous H2S induced a reductive metabolic shift, decreasing the NAD+/NADH ratio and stimulating reductive carboxylation. Like other ETC poisons, H2S increases glycolysis, although the study reporting this effect concluded that it was mediated independently of its interaction with the ETC (30Lee Z.W. Teo X.Y. Tay E.Y. Tan C.H. Hagen T. Moore P.K. Deng L.W. Utilizing hydrogen sulfide as a novel anti-cancer agent by targeting cancer glycolysis and pH imbalance.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2014; 171: 4322-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that the majority of H2S is rapidly lost (<30 min) from commonly used culture media (RPMI and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium [DMEM]) owing to its volatility, while a fraction is trapped as sulfane-sulfur species presumably via reaction with cystine and oxidized serum protein thiols. We report that H2S profoundly impacts energy metabolism and increases glucose consumption and lactate production, and that these changes are sensitive to the mitochondrial but not cytoplasmic NADH pool. Finally, we demonstrated that SQOR regulates these H2S-mediated cellular responses, revealing a previously unrecognized lever for controlling electron flux and coordinating energy metabolism across compartments. The sulfide salts Na2S and NaHS are widely used as exogenous sources of sulfide in cell culture experiments. H2S is volatile, and the kinetics of abiotic loss under standard culture conditions, which is expected to impact cellular responses, is largely unknown. We therefore examined the kinetics of sulfide loss under plate and suspension culture conditions that are routinely used in our laboratory, as a prelude to characterizing its effects on energy metabolism. Sulfide addition to 6-cm plates containing PBS at 37 °C resulted in its rapid disappearance (Fig. 2A) with a t1/2 of ~3 min. Similarly, in RPMI 1640 cell culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, the sulfide concentration decreased 5- to 6-fold within 15 min and decreased with a t1/2 of ~4 min (Fig. 2A). Of interest, the sulfide concentration was maintained at ~5 to 10 μM in the RPMI medium for several hours, which was independent of whether or not malignant HT29 cells were present. RPMI medium contains 208 μM cystine, which can react with H2S to form cysteine and cysteine persulfide and, subsequently, other sulfane sulfur species. Indeed, cysteine and sulfane sulfur accumulation were observed within 30 min. In the presence of cells, the cysteine concentration was maintained at ~60 μM in 4 h, whereas it decreased to almost zero in culture medium alone over the same period (Fig. 2B). Of interest, in the absence of sulfide, cellular metabolism also contributed to a gradual increase in extracellular cysteine levels, although with different kinetics compared with cultured cells exposed to sulfide. The sulfane sulfur concentration in the culture medium alone decreased more slowly to ~30 μM in 4 h (Fig. 2C). In the presence of cells, the sulfane sulfur levels also increased upon addition of Na2S and decreased more sharply to ~10 μM in 4 h. The concentration of the sulfane sulfur pool is higher than cysteine, suggesting that it comprises a mixture of low-molecular-weight and protein (present in serum) derivatives. Sulfane sulfur accumulation was not observed in RPMI medium alone, i.e., in the absence of Na2S and cells. Similar results were obtained with DMEM medium (not shown). In comparison with culture dishes with large surface areas, sulfide was more stable in Eppendorf tubes and the kinetics of its disappearance were clearly distinguishable in the presence of control cells with a scrambled shRNA sequence (HT29scr) (Fig. 2D). Cellular sulfide clearance was paralleled by the appearance of the oxidation product, thiosulfate (Fig. 2E). The 2:1 stoichiometry between sulfide and thiosulfate indicated that thiosulfate was the terminal oxidation product of HT29 cells under our experimental conditions. The effect of H2S on the kinetics of glucose utilization was examined in 5% (w/v) suspension cultures in modified PBS (DPBS). Cells transfected with a scrambled shRNA sequence (HT29scr) exhibited enhanced glucose consumption and lactate production in response to H2S (100 μM) (Fig. 3, A and B). To assess whether stimulation of aerobic glycolysis was a general response to sulfide, four other cell lines were examined. A ~2- to 3-fold enhancement of glucose consumption and lactate production rates was observed at 100 μM sulfide in other malignant cell lines (HCT116, DLD-1, and 143B) as well (Fig. 3, C and D). No further stimulation of glycolysis was observed above this sulfide concentration as discussed later. In contrast, the nonmalignant HCEC cells did not increase aerobic glycolysis in response to 100 μM sulfide (Fig. 3, C and D). However, at a higher sulfide concentration (200 μM), a 1.6-fold activation of glycolysis was observed in HCEC cells (Fig. 3E). Sulfide-induced activation of glycolysis increased the ratio of lactate produced to glucose consumed to the limiting value of two in HT29 and HCT116 cells (Fig. 3F). In DLD, 143B, and HCEC cells, the ratio was ~2 even in the absence of sulfide. Therefore, sulfide enhanced the rate of glucose oxidation in all the malignant cell lines tested here, whereas it increased the coupling between glucose consumed and lactate produced in HT29 and HCT116 cells, where the scope for further diverting pyruvate formed from glucose to lactate existed. We examined how enzymes in the mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway modulate sulfide clearance and the cytosolic response to sulfide, i.e., enhanced aerobic glycolysis. For this, the first two pathway enzymes were knocked down in HT29 cells; SQOR as described previously (31Libiad M. Vitvitsky V. Bostelaar T. Bak D.W. Lee H.J. Sakamoto N. Fearon E. Lyssiotis C.A. Weerapana E. Banerjee R. Hydrogen sulfide perturbs mitochondrial bioenergetics and triggers metabolic reprogramming in colon cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 12077-12090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and ETHE1 (Fig. 2F). H2S clearance by control (HT29scr) and ETHE1 knockdown cells were indistinguishable while SQOR knockdown retarded sulfide clearance and thiosulfate production (Fig. 2, B and C). SQOR knockdown cells exhibited an increased sensitivity to H2S, and full activation of aerobic glycolysis was observed at 50 μM H2S (Fig. 4B). In contrast, a similar increase in the rate of aerobic glycolysis was observed only at 100 μM sulfide in HT29scr control and ETHE1 knockdown cells. Corresponding changes were observed in the lactate:glucose ratio (Fig. 4C). Since H2S increases the glycolytic rate and reportedly increases the activity of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase in a rat cardiomyoblast cell line (32Chhabra A. Mishra S. Kumar G. Gupta A. Keshri G.K. Bharti B. Meena R.N. Prabhakar A.K. Singh D.K. Bhargava K. Sharma M. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is critical for suppression of cardiac hypertrophy by H2S.Cell Death Discov. 2018; 4: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), we examined whether it affects the pentose phosphate pathway and/or the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle under our experimental conditions. As described previously (31Libiad M. Vitvitsky V. Bostelaar T. Bak D.W. Lee H.J. Sakamoto N. Fearon E. Lyssiotis C.A. Weerapana E. Banerjee R. Hydrogen sulfide perturbs mitochondrial bioenergetics and triggers metabolic reprogramming in colon cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 12077-12090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we used two bolus additions of sulfide separated by 3 h to compensate for its rapid disappearance from cell culture medium. The effect of sulfide on central carbon metabolism was monitored by measuring the formation of [14C]-CO2 from [1-14C]-glucose or [6-14C]-glucose (Fig. 5A). Metabolism of [1-14C]-glucose results in radiolabeled CO2 from both the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and the TCA cycle, whereas [6-14C]-glucose liberates 14CO2 only via the TCA cycle. H2S did not change the extent of labeled CO2 from either [1-14C]- or [6-14C]-glucose in nonmalignant HCEC and malignant HT29 colonocytes, respectively (Fig. 5, B and C). Approximately 3.5-fold higher 14CO2 was released from C1 versus C6 glucose in HCEC cells and ~9-fold more in HT29 cells, indicating that the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway rather than the TCA cycle is the major source of CO2 in both these cell lines. To assess the role of the mitochondrial versus cytoplasmic redox status on sulfide-stimulated aerobic glycolysis, two approaches were employed. First, HT29 cells expressing cytoplasmic or mitochondrial LbNOX, the water-forming NADH oxidase from Lactobacillus brevis (33Titov D.V. Cracan V. Goodman R.P. Peng J. Grabarek Z. Mootha V.K. Complementation of mitochondrial electron transport chain by manipulation of the NAD+/NADH ratio.Science. 2016; 352: 231-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were used (Fig. S1). In LbNOX-expressing cells, the NADH/NAD+ ratio undergoes an oxidative shift in a compartment-specific manner (Fig. 6A). Second, 143B cybrids expressing either wildtype (143Bwt) or mutant (143BCytb) mitochondria (i.e., lacking a functional complex III due to a frameshift mutation in cytochrome b (34Sullivan L.B. Gui D.Y. Hosios A.M. Bush L.N. Freinkman E. Vander Heiden M.G. Supporting aspartate biosynthesis is an essential function of respiration in proliferating cells.Cell. 2015; 162: 552-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar)) were employed (Fig. 6B). In these cells, the mitochondrial pyridine nucleotide and CoQ pools are expected to be more reduced owing to a dysfunctional ETC. Sulfide (100 μM) stimulated aerobic glycolysis in empty vector controls as well as in cells expressing cytoplasmic LbNOX (Fig. 6, C–E), indicating that sulfide signaling is not mediated via the cytoplasmic pyridine nucleotide pool. In contrast, cells expressing mito-LbNOX exhibited a 1.6-fold elevation in the basal glucose consumption rate, which was only slightly stimulated by 100 μM H2S (Fig. 6, C–E). These data indicate that mito-LbNOX expressing cells activate aerobic glycolysis even in the absence of H2S to compensate for reduced mitochondrial ATP synthesis due to attenuated electron flux through complex I. Next, we examined the effect of H2S on glycolysis in mito-LbNOX expressing cells in more detail. Unlike the empty vector control, maximal stimulation of aerobic glycolysis required a higher concentration of H2S (500 μM) confirming a lower sensitivity of these cells to H2S for eliciting a change in cytoplasmic energy metabolism (Fig. 7, A and B). The mito-LbNOX expressing cells cleared H2S more rapidly than empty vector or cytoplasmic LbNOX expressing cells, which was paralleled by an increased production of thiosulfate (Fig. 7, C and D). These data are consistent with reduced competition for the CoQ pool in mito-LbNOX cells in which the mitochondrial NADH pool is more oxidized. In comparison with 143Bwt, the 143BCytb cybrids exhibited a higher basal glycolysis rate, and a 2:1 lactate production to glucose utilization ratio, even in the absence of sulfide, indicating that every equivalent of glucose entering the cell was metabolized to two equivalents of lactate (Fig. 6, C–E). Glycolysis was not further stimulated by H2S in these cells. Compared with 143Bwt, suspensions of 143BCytb cybrids cleared H2S less efficiently and accumulated a lower concentration of thiosulfate (Fig. S2) The malate–aspartate shuttle is a major conduit for moving electron equivalents between the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments (Fig. 1). The role of this shuttle in sulfide signaling from the mitochondrion to the cytoplasm was examined by knocking down GOT1 and GOT2 in HT29 cells (Fig. 8, A and B). However, neither knockdown affected sulfide-stimulated aerobic glycolysis compared with control HT29scr cells (Fig. 8, C and D). Next, we examined whether sulfide stimulates phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and thereby diverts pyruvate away from the TCA cycle. Although no change was discernable within 5 min of sulfide addition (100 μM), phosphorylation increased 164 ± 31% in 15 min (Fig. 8, E and F) and was sustained for at least another 15 min (not shown). A change in pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphorylation levels was not observed in HCT116 or 143B WT cells (Fig. S3), indicating that this is not a general mechanism for transducing sulfide effects from the mitochondrion to the cytoplasm. Complex IV inhibition by sulfide is expected to reduce ATP synthesis via oxidative phosphorylation and perturb adenylate pools. Sulfide (100 μM) decreased ATP concentration ~8% to 12% in HT29scr and HCT116 cells and 143Bwt cybrids (Fig. 9, A–D). A statistically significant increase in ADP was observed in the same cell lines. In comparison with 143BWT cells, the 143BCytb cells showed lower total ATP and higher ADP, which did not respond to sulfide (Fig. 9E). AMP levels were low in most cell lines and reliable data could not be obtained owing to the high scatter. Compared with untreated controls, sulfide resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the total adenine nucleotide pool (i.e., AMP + ADP + ATP) in each cell line (Fig. 9F). One of the challenges in the H2S field is the varied sulfide concentrations that are used to elicit cellular effects and the lack of information on the lifetime of exogenously provided sulfide under different experimental conditions. Typically, concentrations varying from tens of micromolar to mil"
https://openalex.org/W3159278124,"Membrane contact sites (MCSs) formed between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane (PM) provide a platform for nonvesicular lipid exchange. The ER-anchored tricalbins (Tcb1, Tcb2, and Tcb3) are critical tethering factors at ER–PM MCSs in yeast. Tricalbins possess a synaptotagmin-like mitochondrial-lipid-binding protein (SMP) domain and multiple Ca2+-binding C2 domains. Although tricalbins have been suggested to be involved in lipid exchange at the ER–PM MCSs, it remains unclear whether they directly mediate lipid transport. Here, using in vitro lipid transfer assays, we discovered that tricalbins are capable of transferring phospholipids between membranes. Unexpectedly, while its lipid transfer activity was markedly elevated by Ca2+, Tcb3 constitutively transferred lipids even in the absence of Ca2+. The stimulatory activity of Ca2+ on Tcb3 required intact Ca2+-binding sites on both the C2C and C2D domains of Tcb3, while Ca2+-independent lipid transport was mediated by the SMP domain that transferred lipids via direct interactions with phosphatidylserine and other negatively charged lipid molecules. These findings establish tricalbins as lipid transfer proteins, and reveal Ca2+-dependent and -independent lipid transfer activities mediated by these tricalbins, providing new insights into their mechanism in maintaining PM integrity at ER–PM MCSs."

Reports suggest hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) as an important contributor to and regulator of carbohydrate-induced hepatic lipid accumulation in NAFLD. The mechanisms responsible for the increase in hepatic DNL due to overconsumption of carbohydrate diet are less than clear; however, literatures suggest high carbohydrate diet to activate the lipogenic transcription factor carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP), which further transcribes genes involved in DNL. Here, we provide an evidence of an unknown link between nuclear factor kappa-light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) activation and increased DNL.

Reduced sorcin levels, further prompted ChREBP nuclear translocation, leading to enhanced DNL and intrahepatic lipid accumulation both in vivo and in vitro. We further report that pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB abrogated high carbohydrate diet–mediated sorcin repression and thereby prevented ChREBP nuclear translocation and this, in turn, attenuated hepatic lipid accumulation both in in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, sorcin knockdown blunted the lipid-lowering ability of the NF-κB inhibitor in vitro.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is defined as a clinical state of excessive accumulation of lipids within hepatic tissue without any history of alcohol abuse. Higher intake of dietary components like carbohydrates (fructose, sucrose, and glucose) promotes chronic positive energy balance fostering hepatic manifestations like NAFLD (1Abdul-Wahed A.

DNL is a highly dynamic and well-coordinated biochemical process with the involvement of prominent transcriptional regulators like carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) and SREBP-1c (sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1) (10Dentin R.

ChREBP is a master regulator of lipid metabolism present across various organs and majorly regulates hepatic DNL. On its nuclear entry, ChREBP binds to highly conserved carbohydrate response element regions across the promoters of ChREBP responsive target genes coding for key enzymes of DNL-like fatty acid synthase (FASN), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (11Ortega-Prieto P. Postic C. Carbohydrate sensing through the transcription factor ChREBP.Front. Genet. 2019; 10: 472Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In a study, genetically obese mice (ob/ob) and as well as human fatty liver biopsy samples were seen to have increased expression of ChREBP and elevated transcripts of lipogenic genes (12Dentin R.

Although a high carbohydrate diet is known to be an etiological parameter related to the development of metabolic diseases, ChREBP seems to be a hub protein that translates the carbohydrate-dependent signaling for glucose disposal as lipids (13Kim M.-S.

Sorcin (soluble resistance-related calcium-binding protein) is a calcium-binding protein belonging to penta-EF-hand family. It is reported to be an important regulator of calcium homeostasis in organs like the heart and brain by inhibiting (ryanodine receptor) RyR activity and Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. A study reports sorcin to interact with RyR, pore-forming α1 subunit of voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels (L-type VDCC), sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase pumps, to potentially monitor Ca2+ dependent intracellular excitation-contraction (22Marmugi A.

Gera R. Dogra S. Gautam K. Ghosh D. Mondal P. Chronic exposure to Pb 2+ perturbs Ch REBP transactivation and coerces hepatic dyslipidemia.FEBS Lett. 2019; 593: 3084-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). As sorcin seemed to be regulating ChREBP-mediated hepatic DNL, we were keen to assess the effect of dietary carbohydrates on hepatic sorcin expression and its crosstalk with ChREBP to the progression of hepatic lipid accumulation. We observed high carbohydrate diet (30% sucrose for in vivo model and 30 mM glucose for in vitro model) to lower hepatic sorcin protein levels and thereby set cytosolic ChREBP free for nuclear entry and transcriptional activity. As dietary carbohydrate appears to be a universal causative agent of NAFLD progression, it seemed rationale to investigate the regulation of sorcin by high carbohydrate diet. The nuclear factor kappa-light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling stands pivotal across many complexly coordinated biological processes (23Shih V.F.S. Tsui R. Caldwell A. Hoffmann A. A single NFκB system for both canonical and non-canonical signaling.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 86-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Pieces of literature broadly present NF-κB activation to be either canonical owing to inflammatory stimuli or noncanonical owing to developmental cues (23Shih V.F.S. Tsui R. Caldwell A. Hoffmann A. A single NFκB system for both canonical and non-canonical signaling.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 86-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Five cytosolic NF-κB subunits form potentially 15 complexes of homodimers/heterodimers of RelA/p65, cRel, RelB, NFκB1/p52, and NFκB2/p50. These subunits through their conserved Rel Homology Domain interact with the κβ sites of target genes and regulate transcription. Additionally, the p65, cRel, RelB possess a transactivation domain through which their transcriptional regulation could be remodeled (24Christian F. Smith E. Carmody R. The regulation of NF-κB subunits by phosphorylation.Cells. 2016; 5: 12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tegowski M. Baldwin A. Noncanonical NF-κB in cancer.Biomedicines. 2018; 6: 66Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We found high carbohydrate diet downregulates hepatic sorcin expression through NFκβ-NCoRI–mediated transcriptional repression. Herein, using numerous complementary experimental approaches, we show the critical participation of NF-κB in ChREBP’s nuclear entry on exposure to excessive carbohydrate diet and linked fatty liver pathologies. Our findings highlight dietary carbohydrate–induced NF-κB nuclear localization and its significance in regulating hepatic sorcin, which in turn regulates ChREBP. Our studies also indicate PDTC (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; [NF-κB inhibitor]) to curtail high carbohydrate diet–induced hepatic lipid accumulation by attenuating excessive carbohydrate–induced ChREBP’s nuclear entry. Taken together, we strongly advocate NF-κB p65 to be a critical hub protein with great therapeutic potential in NAFLD We developed a high sucrose–fed mouse model (Fig. 1A) to provide a deeper understanding of endogenous mechanisms-underlying sucrose-induced fatty liver diseases. Mice maintained on regular chow diet (Fig. 1A) when exposed to 30% sucrose (w/v) contained drinking water (HSD group) showed a significant rise in their body weights over the control mice (NCD) (Fig. 1B). In line with reports that mention excessive carbohydrate intake to induce liver fattiness (26Basaranoglu M. Basaranoglu G. Bugianesi E. Carbohydrate intake and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: Fructose as a weapon of mass destruction.Hepatobiliary Surg. Nutr. 2015; 4: 109-10916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found dense lipid droplets and vacuolar degeneration within the liver section of HSD mice, as compared with NCD mice post-H&E and oil red O staining, as depicted in the representative images (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, we also found transcript levels of hepatic DNL regulators (ACC, FASN, ChREBP) were increased in HSD exposed mice liver as compared with the NCD (Fig. 1D). As we had recently identified sorcin as a novel regulator of ChREBP-linked DNL (20Vineeth Daniel P. Kamthan M. Gera R. Dogra S. Gautam K. Ghosh D. Mondal P. Chronic exposure to Pb 2+ perturbs Ch REBP transactivation and coerces hepatic dyslipidemia.FEBS Lett. 2019; 593: 3084-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we assessed for sorcin level in the HSD liver tissue. We saw significant reductions in the transcript as well as the protein level of hepatic sorcin in HSD liver over NCD liver (Fig. 1, E–G), whereas sorcin levels remained unaltered in white adipose tissue (Fig. S1). So, as to understand the physiological mechanism underlying dietary carbohydrate–induced liver sorcin reduction and enhanced ChREBP-linked DNL, we generated a mouse model with adenoviral-mediated overexpression of sorcin (Fig. 1H). Following the adenoviral treatment regimes, Ad-SRI injected HSD mice showed a significant reduction in their body weights as compared with the control counterpart (Fig. 1I). Western blot analysis of hepatic tissue confirmed the significant expression of exogenous sorcin within the liver of Ad-SRI injected mice, as compared with respective control (HSD mice) (Fig. 1, J and K). Next, we wanted to determine whether the reduced sorcin level in the liver of HSD mice associates with enhanced ChREBP nuclear protein abundance in liver. Immunoblotting of subcellular fractionated liver lysates revealed significant rise in the abundance of ChREBP protein in the nuclear lysate of HSD mice group as compared with NCD, and markedly, nuclear ChREBP levels decreased significantly after adenoviral overexpression of sorcin (Ad-SRI) in the HSD group (Fig. 1, L and M). These results suggested that ChREBP is translocated into the nucleus in response to high sucrose diet, whereas Ad-SRI reduced the sucrose-stimulated nuclear entry of ChREBP, which is required for its transactivation. Our in vivo observations proposed high sucrose diet to reduce hepatic sorcin levels and enable enhanced cytosol-nuclear shuttling of ChREBP, eventually causing hepatic dyslipidemia. Further to delineate the underlying mechanism of high carbohydrate diet–induced enhanced ChREBP nuclear localization, we developed an in vitro setup, by treating the hepatic cell line (HepG2) with low (5 mM) and high (30 mM) glucose concentrations. Western blot analysis depicted high glucose to reduce sorcin protein levels in HepG2 cells (Figs. S2 and S3). To strengthen our observation of high glucose–mediated enhanced intracellular lipid accumulation is because of ChREBP’s transactivation via sorcin, we examined ChREBP subcellular localization, in response to low and high carbohydrate. Microscopic studies deciphered increased nuclear accumulation of ChREBP, in high glucose, as compared with low glucose (Fig. 1N). To further decipher the role of sorcin in high glucose–mediated ChREBP’s nuclear localization, we overexpressed m-Sorcin-FLAG in hepatocyte cells and performed ChREBP’s subcellular localization. Interestingly, sorcin overexpression in high glucose sequestered a major pool of ChREBP within the cytosol (Fig. 1N, O). The in vitro results thus reinforced the role of sorcin in cytosolic sequestration of ChREBP in hepatocytes. Altogether, these data clearly show that the downregulation of hepatic sorcin is the major factor that influences enhanced nuclear translocation of ChREBP in response to high carbohydrates intake. Our previous observations motivated us to delineate the mechanism behind the regulation of hepatic sorcin in response to carbohydrate treatment. Dietary components like high fat are reported to augment NF-κB p65 activation and induce lipogenesis in the liver (27Lu H. Lei X. Zhang Q. Moderate activation of IKK2-NF-kB in unstressed adult mouse liver induces cytoprotective genes and lipogenesis without apparent signs of inflammation or fibrosis.BMC Gastroenterol. 2015; 15: 94Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 28Luedde T.

Zheng L.J Chen L. Wu C. Xia W. C, W.,Blocking nuclear factor-kappa B protects against diet-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in mice.PLoS One. 2016; 11e0149677PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we aimed to study the effect of a high carbohydrate diet on NF-κB p65 activation. Posttranslational modifications of NF-κB p65 subunits, like phosphorylation of p65 subunit at serine536, activate NF-κB p65 and enables its nuclear entry (30Datta De D. Datta A. Bhattacharjya S. Roychoudhury S. NF-kappaB mediated transcriptional repression of acid modifying hormone gastrin.PLoS One. 2013; 8e73409Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the p65 subunit is required for the optimal p65-mediated transactivation potential of NF-κB. Thus, we assessed the extent of phosphorylation-mediated nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 in presence of low and high glucose and PDTC (an inhibitor of NF-κB). Surprisingly, we observed high glucose (30 mM) to enrich nuclear abundance of NF-κB p65 as compared with low glucose (5 mM), and also, PDTC was able to block high glucose induced translocation of NF-κB p65 (Fig. 2, A and B). We then questioned whether high glucose–induced activation of NF-κB p65 to have any link with subcellular movement of ChREBP in the similar nutritional stress. Interestingly, we did see high glucose–induced nuclear abundance of ChREBP to be significantly reduced in both pharmacological-induced NF-κB inhibition (PDTC) and NF-κB knockout state using siRNA for NF-κB p65 (Fig. 2, C and D). Knockdown was specific as reflected on immunoblot by approximately 90% reduction of NF-κB p65. Additionally, we also assessed the phenotypic outcome of NF-κB p65 inhibition on ChREBP-induced hepatic intracellular lipid accumulation. High glucose (30 mM) treatment showed increased Bodipy-stained lipid droplets as compared with low glucose (5 mM). Pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB p65 abrogated high glucose–induced intracellular lipid droplet abundance. To further evaluate the participation of sorcin in fatty liver attenuating properties of NF-κB p65 inhibitor (PDTC), we knocked down sorcin using sorcin siRNAs in cultured HepG2 cells (Fig. S4) and later assessed the outcome through Bodipy staining. Interestingly, PDTC-induced reduction in intracellular lipid droplets was blunted in sorcin knocked down cells (Fig. 2, E and F). These observations recommended NF-κB p65 to have a pivotal role in high glucose–induced elevated hepatic lipid accumulation, and sorcin can be critical in the same axis. We next examined whether NF-κB p65 directly stimulates hepatic sorcin repression. Through bioinformatics tool, we came across NF-κB consensuses on human sorcin promoter (Fig. 3A-i). Hence, we prepared a luciferase reporter plasmid of human sorcin promoter with both the putative functional NF-κB consensuses found near (−69 to −80 bp) and (−103 to −114 bp) (Fig. 3A-ii). Following transfections and luciferase assay, we observed that cells exposed to high glucose showed reduced sorcin promoter activity in response to high glucose as long as two NF-κB sites were intact. Mutation of both the NF-κB sites abrogated the high glucose–mediated transcriptional repression of sorcin (Fig. 3B). Connecting with our previous observations, our results confirmed high glucose to stimulate nuclear localization of NF- κB p65followed by repressing sorcin promoter activity. We, then next assessed the presence of activated NF-κB p65 (pNF-κB) on the sorcin promoter through ChIP assay. qPCR analysis of NF-κB specific consensus, from chromatin elutes obtained post immunoprecipitation with pNF-κB and IgG antibodies, showed high glucose treated cells to have greater interaction of NF-κB on sorcin promoter, as compared with low glucose (Fig. 3C). This observation seemed a little intriguing, as high carbohydrate diet–mediated NF-κB p65 activation had a negative co-relation with the hepatic sorcin abundance. Thus, we hypothesized presence of an additional transcriptional co-repressor. Following the cited literature (30Datta De D. Datta A. Bhattacharjya S. Roychoudhury S. NF-kappaB mediated transcriptional repression of acid modifying hormone gastrin.PLoS One. 2013; 8e73409Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we assessed for the presence of nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoRI), along with p65 protein on sorcin promoter. Interestingly, we did see enriched occupancy of NCoRI on NF-κB p65 consensus of sorcin promoter in chromatin elutes of high glucose exposed cells, as compared with the control (Fig. 3D). To further authenticate the association of NF-κB p65 or NCoRI with transcriptional repression of sorcin, we used siRNA specific of NF-κB p65 and NCoRI respectively and performed a sorcin reporter assay. Knockdown was specific as reflected on immunoblot by significant reduction of NF-κB p65 and NCoRI (Figs. S5 and S6). As depicted (Fig. 3E), on NF-κB p65 or NCoRI silencing, cells showed vivid perturbation in high glucose–induced reduction in sorcin promoter activity, respectively. Also, when assessed at the protein level from the total cell lysate, NF-κB p65 and NCoRI knockdown in high glucose conditions did significantly exhibit protection from high glucose–induced sorcin downregulation (Fig. 3, F and G). To further validate our observation of NF-κB p65 mediating high glucose–stimulated sorcin downregulation, we used S536 mutants of p65-WT-FLAG construct and validated the role of NF-κB p65 (through S536) in carbohydrate stress–induced sorcin expression. Cells overexpressing p65-WT-FLAG construct significantly reduced sorcin promoter activity in presence of high glucose, whereas overexpression of the phospho-null (p65-S536A-FLAG) construct greatly attenuated the high glucose–induced repression of sorcin promoter activity. To our immense surprise, cells overexpressing the phospho-mimic (p65-S536D-FLAG) reduced sorcin promoter activity in presence of low glucose (Fig. 3H). This observation kindled an authentication of NF-κB p65 phosphorylation at S536 residue to be pivotal in high carbohydrate–mediated sorcin gene regulation. We also found a similar trend as observed in promoter activity when we assessed the transcript level endogenous sorcin in presence of these p65 constructs (Fig. S7). To further substantiate our observations, we transfected HepG2 cells with p65-S536D-FLAG and p65-WT-FLAG and maintained them in low and high glucose conditions and determined the sorcin protein levels. As shown in Figure 3, I and J, overexpression of p65-WT construct significantly reduced sorcin expression in presence of high glucose, whereas overexpression of the phospho-mimic greatly suppressed sorcin protein levels in presence of low glucose. Taken together, all our observations strongly highlight the crucial importance of NF-κB p65-NCoRI complex in mediating high glucose–induced repression of hepatic sorcin levels. To evaluate whether NF-κB p65 participates in regulating sucrose-mediated transactivation of ChREBP and thereby modulate hepatic lipid accumulation in in vivo, we administered PDTC through I.P. injections to the high sucrose-fed mice, with respective control groups (Fig. 4A). As observed in our in vitro setup, hepatic lipid attenuating properties of PDTC was significantly vivid in our in vivo model too, as both oil red O staining and H&E staining of liver sections (Fig. 4B). Next, we examined NF-κB p65 subcellular localization in response to high sucrose diet and effect of PDTC treatment on the same. Interestingly, we found increased NF-κB p65 nuclear localization in HSD exposed mice, which was prevented by PDTC. Overall, PDTC treatment did curtail nuclear abundance of NF-κB, as observed otherwise in HSD exposed mice (Fig. 4, C and D). Moreover, PDTC treatment also showed slight reduction in the nuclear levels of ChREBP in HSD background (Fig. 4, C and D), indicating PDTC to effectively block high sucrose–induced hepatic lipid accumulation by restricting nuclear localization of ChREBP, which is otherwise required for optimal sucrose-mediated enhanced DNL. To examine the effect of high sucrose diet and/or PDTC on sorcin, we measured sorcin protein expression profile in NCD and sucrose-fed mice (HSD) liver in presence and absence of PDTC treatment (Fig. 4, F and G). Interestingly, we observed that in HSD-saline mice group resulted in significant repression of sorcin levels in the liver, whereas PDTC treatment protects sorcin from such downregulation (Fig. 4, F and G). Taken together, these results indicate PDTC to specifically block high carbohydrate diet–stimulated nuclear localization of NF-κB p65, which is required for optimal p65-mediated transactivation potential of NF-κB to suppress sorcin expression which in turn enhances nuclear localization of ChREBP. To further dissect the antilipogenic mechanistic axis of PDTC, on hepatic lipid homeostasis, through another potent energy metabolism energy sensor protein, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation is expected to coordinate the partitioning of fatty acids between oxidative and biosynthetic pathways by increasing fatty acid oxidation (FAO) capacity and inhibiting DNL, respectively. We thus measured the phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172, as a surrogate for AMPK activation, in the liver lysates of our experimental mice group. Interestingly, we found that high sucrose (HSD liver lysates) exposure blunted AMPK(Thr172) phosphorylation, whereas PDTC restrained the downregulation of phosphorylation of AMPK (Thr172) led by high sucrose, inferring PDTC to also signal through AMPK to perturb hepatic dysli"
https://openalex.org/W3157525233,"Squalene monooxygenase (SM, also known as squalene epoxidase) is a rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis that converts squalene to monooxidosqualene and is oncogenic in numerous cancer types. SM is subject to feedback regulation via cholesterol-induced proteasomal degradation, which depends on its lipid-sensing N-terminal regulatory domain. We previously identified an endogenous truncated form of SM with a similar abundance to full-length SM, but whether this truncated form is functional or subject to the same regulatory mechanisms as full-length SM is not known. Here, we show that truncated SM differs from full-length SM in two major ways: it is cholesterol resistant and adopts a peripheral rather than integral association with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. However, truncated SM retains full SM activity and is therefore constitutively active. Truncation of SM occurs during its endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation and requires the proteasome, which partially degrades the SM N-terminus and disrupts cholesterol-sensing elements within the regulatory domain. Furthermore, truncation relies on a ubiquitin signal that is distinct from that required for cholesterol-induced degradation. Using mutagenesis, we demonstrate that partial proteasomal degradation of SM depends on both an intrinsically disordered region near the truncation site and the stability of the adjacent catalytic domain, which escapes degradation. These findings uncover an additional layer of complexity in the post-translational regulation of cholesterol synthesis and establish SM as the first eukaryotic enzyme found to undergo proteasomal truncation.

Cholesterol is a vital lipid that serves many important functions in mammalian cells, including the maintenance of membrane fluidity and integrity, assembly of cell surface microdomains for signaling and adhesion, and synthesis of steroid hormones (1Ikonen E. Cellular cholesterol trafficking and compartmentalization.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 125-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, excess cholesterol is cytotoxic and linked with the onset of cardiovascular disease and cancer (2Prospective Studies CollaborationBlood cholesterol and vascular mortality by age, sex, and blood pressure: A meta-analysis of individual data from 61 prospective studies with 55 000 vascular deaths.Lancet. 2007; 370: 1829-1839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar, 3Kuzu O.F.

It is therefore essential that cells tightly control cholesterol homeostasis by balancing its uptake, synthesis, and efflux (4Howe V. Sharpe L.J. Alexopoulos S.J. Kunze S.V. Chua N.K. Li D. Brown A.J. Cholesterol homeostasis: How do cells sense sterol excess?.Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2016; 199: 170-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of cholesterol synthesis is especially exquisite, given the energy-intensive and oxygen-intensive nature of the pathway. A critical point at which this regulation is exerted is squalene monooxygenase (SM, also known as squalene epoxidase or SQLE; Enzyme Commission number: 1.14.14.17), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–localized and rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the conversion of squalene to monooxidosqualene (MOS) and subsequently dioxidosqualene (DOS) (5Gill S.

SM is positioned within the branch of the mevalonate pathway that is committed to cholesterol synthesis, contrasting it with the upstream rate-limiting enzyme and well-studied target of statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. Therefore, SM may be an alternative target for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia (6Belter A. Skupinska M. Giel-Pietraszuk M. Grabarkiewicz T. Rychlewski L. Barciszewski J.

These reports raise the interesting prospect of targeting SM therapeutically. As pharmacological inhibition of SM is toxic in mammals (12Nagaraja R. Olaharski A. Narayanaswamy R. Mahoney C. Pirman D.

At the transcriptional level, SM expression is controlled by sterol regulatory element–binding proteins, the master regulators of cholesterogenic genes (13Horton J.D. Shah N.A. Warrington J.A.

Acute regulation occurs at the post-translational level, where SM undergoes accelerated degradation in response to increased cholesterol levels (5Gill S. Stevenson J. Kristiana I. Brown A.J.

The SM-N100 domain is absent from the yeast ortholog of SM, Erg1p, despite high sequence conservation within the SM catalytic domain (5Gill S. Stevenson J. Kristiana I. Brown A.J.

This suggests that the lipid-sensing capabilities of SM are unique to higher eukaryotes, in which more nuanced regulation of cholesterol synthesis is required. Cholesterol and squalene affect SM levels by modulating its ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase membrane–associated RING-CH-type finger 6 (MARCHF6), thereby promoting or preventing its ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (15Yoshioka H.

Beyond MARCHF6, the ERAD of SM involves additional effectors including the AAA+-type ATPase valosin-containing protein (VCP), which extracts client proteins from the ER membrane, the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Ube2J2, deubiquitinases, and the 26S proteasome (5Gill S.

Plasmalogen glycerophospholipids and unsaturated fatty acids also regulate the MARCHF6-mediated degradation of SM (22Stevenson J. Luu W. Kristiana I. Brown A.J.

Biochem. 2019; 166: 353-361Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), implying that SM responds to other classes of lipids. However, further details of the SM ERAD mechanism remain to be elucidated. Previously, we reported that immunoblotting of SM in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell lysates detected full-length SM as well as a low–molecular weight and putatively truncated form of SM (15Yoshioka H. Coates H.W. Chua N.K. Hashimoto Y. Brown A.J. Ohgane K. A key mammalian cholesterol synthesis enzyme, squalene monooxygenase, is allosterically stabilized by its substrate.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2020; 117: 7150-7158Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the present study, we characterize this SM variant and show that it arises from partial proteasomal degradation of the SM-N100 regulatory domain (referred to herein as proteasomal truncation). This has been described for only two other human proteins, NF-κB and Gli3, where it results in major changes to protein function (24Fan C.-M. Maniatis T. Generation of p50 subunit of NF-kB by processing of p105 through an ATP-dependent pathway.Nature. 1991; 354: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 25Wang B. Fallon J.F. Beachy P.A. Hedgehog-regulated processing of Gli3 produces an anterior/posterior repressor gradient in the developing vertebrate limb.Cell. 2000; 100: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of SM, proteasomal truncation depends on an intrinsically disordered region adjacent to the truncation site and the stability of the C-terminal catalytic domain. Truncation yields a constitutively active form of SM that is resistant to cholesterol-induced degradation and has an altered ER membrane topology. These findings uncover an additional mode by which SM activity is regulated and establish the first known example of a proteasomally truncated eukaryotic enzyme. We previously reported that anti-SM immunoblotting of HEK293 cell lysates detected full-length SM (~64 kDa) as well as a low–molecular weight protein (~55 kDa) that was derived from the SQLE gene and accumulated upon treatment with the SM inhibitor NB-598 (15Yoshioka H. Coates H.W. Chua N.K. Hashimoto Y. Brown A.J. Ohgane K. A key mammalian cholesterol synthesis enzyme, squalene monooxygenase, is allosterically stabilized by its substrate.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2020; 117: 7150-7158Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This protein will henceforth be referred to as truncated SM (trunSM). Here, we observed expression and NB-598–induced accumulation of trunSM in the commonly used HEK293T and HeLaT cell lines, as well as other human cell lines derived from tissues that actively synthesize cholesterol: Huh7 (liver), HepG2 (liver), and Be(2)-C (brain) (Fig. 1A). A trunSM-like protein was also detected in the CHO subline CHO-7, where it accumulated upon prolonged NB-598 treatment (Fig. S1A). These observations confirmed that trunSM production is generalizable to a range of human cell types and the hamster ortholog of SM. To further characterize trunSM, we examined its stability by treating HEK293T cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide in the presence or the absence of NB-598. The trunSM protein was remarkably long lived: in the absence of NB-598, ∼80% of its starting material remained after 24 h of cycloheximide treatment, compared with only ∼15% of full-length SM (Fig. 1B). NB-598 had no effect on the disappearance of full-length SM but rapidly induced trunSM accumulation, with total SM levels (the sum of full-length SM and trunSM) remaining constant during the treatment. This strongly suggested that trunSM is derived from full-length SM, and that NB-598 promotes this conversion. To directly verify this, we sterol-depleted cells to maximize SM expression, labeled newly synthesized protein with an azidomethionine analog, and then induced trunSM formation using NB-598 treatment. Immediately following removal of the azidomethionine label, nascent SM was mostly in its full-length form (Fig. S1B). However, the proportion of labeled trunSM increased during the subsequent NB-598 treatment, confirming that trunSM arises directly from full-length SM. Next, we tested if trunSM undergoes the cholesterol-induced degradation characteristic of full-length SM (5Gill S. Stevenson J. Kristiana I. Brown A.J. Cholesterol-dependent degradation of squalene monooxygenase, a control point in cholesterol synthesis beyond HMG-CoA reductase.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 260-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) by cotreating cells with cycloheximide and exogenous cholesterol. Strikingly, cholesterol had no effect on trunSM levels, whereas accelerated degradation of SM was apparent within 2 h of cholesterol treatment (Fig. 1C). Together, these data indicated that trunSM is resistant to both basal and cholesterol-induced degradation, raising the possibility that it lacks part or all the SM-N100 regulatory domain. This was consistent with the shift in apparent molecular weight between SM and trunSM, which corresponded to a difference of ~50 to 100 amino acids. Each of the GENCODE-annotated and RefSeq-annotated human genomes predicts a different protein-coding isoform of SQLE. These isoforms utilize alternative first exons that substitute the coding sequence of the first 97 amino acids of full-length SM with a two-amino acid or 39-amino acid sequence, respectively (Fig. 2A). Given our hypothesis that trunSM lacks the SM-N100 domain, as well as the similarity between the apparent molecular weight of trunSM (~55 kDa) and the predicted molecular weights of the SQLE isoforms (53.1 kDa for the GENCODE isoform, trunSQLE1; and 57.6 kDa for the RefSeq isoform, trunSQLE2), we sought to confidently rule out the possibility that alternative SQLE transcripts also contribute to trunSM production. To this end, we transfected HEK293T cells with siRNA targeting exon 9 of SQLE, which is present in all three SQLE isoforms (quantified collectively as totalSQLE) or exon 1 of the full-length SQLE isoform only (fullSQLE; Fig. 2A). Both siRNAs reduced trunSM protein levels (Fig. 2B), whereas trunSQLE1 mRNA expression was downregulated by only exon 9 siRNA (Fig. 2C), ruling out this isoform as giving rise to trunSM. Unexpectedly, trunSQLE2 mRNA expression was downregulated by exon 1 siRNA, perhaps because of the presence of the siRNA target sequence in an unannotated 3′-untranslated region of this transcript. To determine the likelihood of trunSQLE2 accounting for trunSM formation, we next performed absolute quantification of SQLE complementary DNA (cDNA). Full-length SQLE cDNA comprised the great majority of SQLE transcripts (~1.6 × 107 cDNA copies per microgram of reverse transcribed RNA), whereas trunSQLE1 and trunSQLE2 cDNA were less abundant by over two orders of magnitude (~8.0 × 104 and ~1.5 × 105 cDNA copies, respectively) (Fig. 2D). Given that (1) trunSM protein levels are comparable to full-length SM even in the absence of NB-598 (Fig. 2B), (2) accumulation of trunSM can occur during inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig. 1B), and (3) we later found that ectopic SM also produces a trunSM-like protein (Fig. 3A), we concluded that trunSM is highly unlikely to be derived from low-abundance SQLE isoforms. To determine if trunSM is a proteolytic product of full-length SM, we transfected HEK293T cells with SM fused to N-terminal (hemagglutinin [HA])3 and C-terminal V5 epitope tags ([HA]3–SM–V5). Immunoblotting detected two C-terminally tagged proteins with molecular weights corresponding to SM and trunSM, the latter of which accumulated upon NB-598 treatment (Fig. 3A). Only the full-length protein was N-terminally tagged, confirming that the trunSM-like fragment lacks the SM N-terminus. Significantly, we were unable to recover a low–molecular weight and N-terminally tagged fragment, suggesting that the SM N-terminus undergoes complete proteolysis during truncation. To estimate the truncation site, we inserted a FLAG epitope tag at various positions within the (HA)3–SM–V5 construct and monitored for its appearance in the truncated fragment. Truncation eliminated the FLAG tag when it was inserted after SM residue 60 but not residue 70 (Fig. S2A), implying that truncation occurs between these two residues. For a more accurate estimation, we next generated N-terminally truncated SM–V5 constructs (ΔN60, ΔN65, and ΔN70) and measured their SDS-PAGE migration relative to full-length and truncated (HA)3–SM–V5. On average, the SM(ΔN60)–V5 construct migrated a shorter distance than the truncated fragment, whereas the SM(ΔN65)–V5 constructs migrated a longer distance (Fig. 3B), indicating that trunSM lacks the N-terminal 60 to 65 residues of SM. We also attempted N-terminal sequencing of truncated (HA)3–SM–V5 to precisely pinpoint the truncation site, but a sequence could not be obtained because of N-terminal blockage (data not shown). Although the reason for the blockage is unknown, we note that N-terminal glutamine residues can prevent protein sequencing (26Mozdzanowski J. Deblocking of proteins containing N-terminal pyroglutamic acid.in: Smith B.J. Protein Sequencing Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2003: 365-369Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and the 60 to 65 region of SM contains residue Gln-62. Based on the aforementioned size estimations, we concluded that truncation of SM eliminates part of the cholesterol-sensing SM-N100 regulatory domain but retains the full C-terminal catalytic domain. Given that SM truncation does not yield an intact N-terminal fragment (Fig. 3A), we hypothesized that this process requires the proteasome and, by extension, the ERAD of SM. ERAD effectors involved in the proteasomal degradation of SM include the AAA+-type ATPase VCP, the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCHF6 and its associated E2 ubiquitin–conjugating enzyme Ube2J2, and unidentified deubiquitinases (19Zelcer N. Sharpe L.J. Loregger A. Kristiana I. Cook E.C. Phan L. Stevenson J. Brown A.J.A.J. The E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH6 degrades squalene monooxygenase and affects 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase and the cholesterol synthesis pathway.Mol. Cell.

Valosin-containing protein mediates the ERAD of squalene monooxygenase and its cholesterol-responsive degron.Biochem. J. 2019; 476: 2545-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Treating HEK293T cells with VCP, proteasome, or deubiquitinase inhibitors blocked the NB-598–induced accumulation of trunSM (Fig. 3C), confirming that a functional ERAD pathway and the proteasome are required for truncation. To corroborate this finding, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of ERAD effectors. Knockdown of VCP also impaired NB-598–induced accumulation of trunSM, whereas UBE2J2 or MARCHF6 knockdown had no effect (Fig. 3D, left). However, we noted that in the absence of NB-598, all three knockdowns greatly reduced the basal truncation of SM (Fig. 3D, right; expressed as the ratio between trunSM and full-length SM levels). This suggested that while Ube2J2 and MARCHF6 are the major E2 and E3 proteins required for SM truncation under normal conditions, other proteins can compensate for their absence during NB-598–stimulated truncation. This contrasted with the apparent absolute requirement for VCP, a core component of ERAD. A lysosome-dependent route for SM degradation has been proposed (9Liu D. Wong C.C. Fu L. Chen H. Zhao L. Li C. Zhou Y. Zhang Y. Xu W. Yang Y. Wu B. Cheng G. Lai P.B.-S. Wong N. Sung J.J. et al.Squalene epoxidase drives NAFLD-induced hepatocellular carcinoma and is a direct pharmaceutical target.Sci. Transl. Med. 2018; 10eaap9840Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); however, inhibitors of lysosomal acidification had no effect on trunSM formation (Fig. S2B), further supporting an ERAD-dependent mechanism. As ERAD requires substrate ubiquitination, typically at lysine residues, we next tested whether a ubiquitin signal controls truncation. We predicted that this signal would occur within the SM-N100 regulatory domain, given that SM is truncated at its N-terminus. While mutation of Lys-82 and the published ubiquitination site Lys-90 (27Hornbeck P.V. Zhang B. Murray B. Kornhauser J.M. Latham V. Skrzypek E. PhosphoSitePlus, 2014: Mutations, PTMs and recalibrations.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D512-D520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar) slightly reduced the truncation of the (HA)3–SM–V5 construct, a more marked effect was observed upon combined mutation of the Lys-82/90/100 cluster (Fig. 3E and Fig. S2C), implying functional redundancy amongst these residues. This reduction in truncation was not compounded by additional mutation of Lys-15/16, residues located nearer to the SM N-terminus, suggesting that Lys-82, Lys-90, and Lys-100 are most critical for truncation. We previously showed that threonine, serine, and cysteine residues within SM-N100 contribute to the cholesterol-induced degradation of SM, with Ser-83 serving as a noncanonical ubiquitination site (20Chua N.K.

Chem. 2019; 294: 8134-8147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2C). However, mutating these residues did not affect truncation (Fig. 3E). Given that lysine residues within the SM-N100 domain are not required for cholesterol-induced degradation of SM (5Gill S. Stevenson J. Kristiana I. Brown A.J.

Chem. 2019; 294: 8134-8147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), this indicated that proteasomal truncation of SM depends on a distinct ubiquitin signal. Few other substrates of partial proteasomal degradation are known. However, two features are associated with truncation: (1) a low-complexity sequence (28Tian L. Holmgren R.A. Matouschek A.

Payre F. Plaza S. Pri sORF peptides induce selective proteasome-mediated protein processing.Science. 2015; 349: 1356-1358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both cases, the region must be adjacent to a tightly folded domain that is resistant to proteasomal unfolding and degradation, allowing an opportunity for substrate release (28Tian L.

RAS-effector interaction strikingly shares a similar binding mode adopted by three components: two antiparallel β-sheets of the RA/RB domains and the RAS switch I region, respectively, and the first α-helix of the RA/RB domains (30Smith M.J.

We used ten RASSF RA domains to analyze their interactions with seven representatives of the RAS proteins family, including HRAS, RRAS1, RAP1B, RAP2A, RALA, RIT1, and RHEB1. CRAF RB domain was used as control. The binding analysis was performed under the same conditions using fluorescence polarization. Obtained dissociation constants (Kd) with a broad range (0.3–500 μM) along with a matrix for a potential interaction of 25 RAS proteins and 57 RA/RB domains provide us a detailed view of the sequence–structure–property relationships of RAS-effector binding capabilities. Mining in the UniProt database led to the extraction of 130 RB and 145 RA-domain-containing proteins, respectively. In a parallel search using HMMER, 127 RB and 164 RA-domain-containing proteins were extracted. These numbers were reduced to 46 RB and 97 RA-domain-containing proteins by excluding proteins containing RHO-binding domains, mitochondrial proton/calcium antiporter domain, and receptors. In the last step, all isoforms with identical sequences of the RB and RA domains were excluded using multiple sequence alignments generated with the ClustalW algorithm. This approach identified a total number of 16 RB domains in 14 RB-domain-containing proteins and 41 RA domains in 39 RA-domain-containing proteins, (Fig. S1; Tables S1 and S2). Both types of RAS effector domains share sequence identity of 10.5% and 9.2% and sequence similarity of 25.5% and 20.2% (Figs. S2 and S3). The direct interaction of different RA-domain-containing proteins with RAS proteins has been comprehensively analyzed (23Wohlgemuth S. Kiel C. Krämer A. Serrano L. Wittinghofer F. Herrmann C.

RGS12/14, which usually act as inactivators of Gα proteins (37Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M.

They appear to facilitate the assembly of the components of the MAPK pathway through direct association with activated HRAS (38Willard F.S. Willard M.D. Kimple A.J. Soundararajan M. Oestreich E.A.

Wittinghofer F. Herrmann C. Recognizing and defining true Ras binding domains I: Biochemical analysis.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 741-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Moreover, a few proteins, reported as RAS effectors, do not apparently contain an RA/RB domain (Table S3). To determine the binding capability between the effector domains and diverse proteins of the RAS family, the following proteins were selected for this study: (i) all ten RASSF family proteins as representative RA-domain-containing effector proteins; (ii) CRAF RB domain (Fig. 1) was used as a representative of the RB-domain-containing proteins; and (iii) the RAS family includes 23 genes coding for at least 25 proteins, which share, considering their G domains, sequence identity of 48.6% and sequence similarity of 61.5% (Fig. S4). Based on sequence identity, structure, and function of their G domains, the RAS proteins were divided into eight paralog groups (Table S4): RAS, RRAS, RAP, RAL, RIT, RHEB, RASD, and DIRAS (42Nakhaei-Rad S. Haghighi F. Nouri P. Rezaei Adariani S. Lissy J. Kazemein Jasemi N.S. Dvorsky R. Ahmadian M.R. Structural fingerprints, interactions, and signaling networks of RAS family proteins beyond RAS isoforms.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2018; 53: 130-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). RAS-related proteins RASLs, RERG, RERGL, NKIRAS1/2 were excluded from this list and study due to their major sequence deviations. To monitor binding we applied a fluorescence polarization assay (21Nakhaeizadeh H. Amin E. Nakhaei-Rad S. Dvorsky R. Ahmadian M.R. The RAS-effector interface: Isoform-specific differences in the effector binding regions.PLoS One. 2016; 11e0167145Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) to determine the dissociation constants (Kd) for the RAS-effector interactions. For this, we prepared HRAS, RRAS, RAP1B, RAP2A, RALA, RIT1, and RHEB1 in complex with a nonhydrolyzable, fluorescent analog of GTP, called mGppNHp. Representatives of RASD and DIRAS groups were not applied due to their physical instability in vitro. Small-sized RB and RA domains were fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP, 42 kDa) to increase their overall molecular weight and to ensure a homogeneous monomeric form of the fusion proteins. Figure 1 shows SDS gels for all purified proteins used in this study. Increasing concentrations of MBP-fused effector proteins were titrated to RAS•mGppNHp proteins to assess the binding capability of the respective interaction pairs. We observed a significant change in fluorescence polarization for the majority of the measurements (Figs. S5 and S6A). However, evaluated Kd values ranged from 0.3 to more than 500 μM. These data are summarized in Table S5 and illustrated in Figure 2. Under these experimental conditions, the CRAF RB domain revealed the highest affinity for HRAS and RRAS1 while the RASSF5 RA domain exhibited a relatively high affinity for HRAS, RAP1B, and RAP2A (Fig. 2, A and B, green bars). The intermediate affinities were obtained for the interaction of the CRAF RB domain with RAP1B as well as RASSF1 with RAP1B, RAP2A and RALA, RASSF9 with RIT1 and RASSF7 with RRAS1 (Fig. 2, A and B; blue bars). The majority of the interaction pairs showed, however, low and very low affinities (Fig. 2B, red and black bars, respectively). Among them, RHEB notably revealed the majority of low-affinity interactions. No binding was observed for 12 pairwise interactions. Purified MBP, which was titrated to HRAS•mGppNHp as a negative control, exhibited no interaction (Fig. S7A). The reproducibility of the fluorescence polarization measurements was assessed by determining the Kd value for the interaction between HRAS•mGppNHp with RASSF1-RA in three different experiments. To understand the atomic interactions between RAS and effector proteins and explain observed variable affinities, we analyzed various structures of RAS-effector protein complexes. To date, 13 structures of RAS-effector protein complexes exist in the PDB (Table S6). As some of them contain more than one complex in the unit cell, there were altogether 19 complexes available for the analysis. In order to map atomic interactions responsible for observed variable affinities, we have extracted information about interacting interface from all of the abovementioned complex structures (Figs. S8 and S9) and combined them with their sequence alignments (Figs. S2–S4). It is important to note that some amino acids, aligned according to the sequence, were quite distant in the space. Therefore, we edited the sequence alignment to synchronize it with the structural alignment. Our python code finally took sequence alignments with PDB files of complex structures as inputs and calculated all interaction pairs in analyzed complex structures in the form of an interaction matrix. The resultant matrix comprehensively relates the interacting residues on both sides of the complexes, with RAS paralogs as rows and the RA/RB domains as columns (Fig. 3). All numbering in this study is based on HRAS on the one side and CRAF and RASSF5, for RB and RA domains respectively, on the other side. Each element of the matrix that can be accounted for a “hotspot” relates one homologous residue from RAS proteins to one homologous residue from the RA/RB domains. The number value of this element, ranging from 0 to 19, represents the number of complex structures in which these residues interact (Fig. 3). Thus, 0 means that these two residues do not contact each other in any structure while a maximal value 19 means that this particular interaction exists in all analyzed complex structures of the RAS-RA/RB domains. We have sorted the residues at both sides of the matrix according to their conservation versus variability. As can be seen in Figs. S4 and S9, the majority of the residues (14 out of 20) on the side of 25 RAS proteins are conserved, nine of which (Q/N25, D/E33, I/V36, E37, D38, S/T39, Y40, R/K41 in switch I, and Y64 in the switch II; HRAS numbering) account for major hotspots (Fig. 3). On the other side, and in contrast, the majority of 19 RAS interacting residues in RA/RB domains are variable and only two distant residues are conserved (R/K59 and K/R84; CRAF numbering; R/K241 and K/R308; RASSF5 numbering) (Fig. 3 and Fig. S9). However, what is striking is the middle cluster of the matrix with the most frequent interactions between the conserved residues in the switch I region of the RAS proteins (β2-strand residues 36–41; HRAS numbering) and the variable residues of the RA/RB domains (β2-strand residues 64–71; CRAF numbering; residues 284–291; RASSF5 numbering) (Fig. 3 and Fig. S9). This cluster adopts an arrangement of intermolecular β-sheet interactions in an antiparallel fashion (Fig. S8). A substantial number of the contacts in this cluster are mediated by main-chain/main-chain interactions, which typically involve hydrogen bonds between the N-H group and the carbonyl oxygen of the amino acids 37 to 39 from the RAS side and positions 66 to 69 (CRAF numbering) and 286 to 289 (RASSF5 numbering) from the side of the RA/RB domains. To prove the impact of the hotspot residues on the selectivity of the RASSF RA domain interactions with RAS family proteins, we selected the weak and strong RAS-RASSF interactions, and substituted 4 to 5 amino acids in the hotspot region (Fig. 3, boxed residues) RASSF2 to RASSF1 as well as RASSF4 and RASSF9 to RASSF5. The variants, RASSF2-to-1, RASSF4-to-5, and RASSF9-to-5 (Fig. 1), were successfully expressed and purified. Their binding affinities for HRAS, RIT1, RALA, RAP2A and RRAS1 were measured using fluorescence polarization (Fig. S10). Remarkable differences in binding affinities of the analyzed RASSF variants are summarized in Figure 4 for comparison. RASSF2-to-1 variant revealed a significant increase of RALA (p < 0.006) and RRAS1 (p < 0.014) binding affinity compared with RASSF2 but declined compared with RASSF1. In contrast, RIT1, which did not show any binding to RASSF2 and a very low affinity to RASSF1, now exhibited a reasonable Kd value of 65 μM for RASSF2-to-1. The RASSF4-to-5 variant, on the one hand, showed a tremendous increase in affinity for HRAS of about 20-fold (p < 0.0118) and, on the other hand, diminished RIT1 property to bind RASSF4 by threefold (p < 0.0351). These data suggest that the hotspot residues favor RASSF4 binding to RIT1, whereas those residues of RASSF5 counteract RIT1 binding. Similarly, the RASSF4-to-5 affinity for RAP2A was increased by 2.5-fold (n.s., p < 0.087), which emphasizes the high-affinity RAP2A-RASSF5 interaction. The RASSF9-to-5 variant showed a 4.5-fold increase in HRAS-binding affinity as compared with RASSF9 (p < 0.008) that can be attributed to the high-affinity interaction of HRAS with RASSF5. The intermediate affinity of RASSF9 for RIT1 of 27 μM is validated by the RASSF9-to-5 variant, which revealed a 5.5-fold higher Kd value (p < 0.005). The interaction of the RASSF9-to-5 variant with RALA was drastically enhanced (Kd = 35 μM) considering the lack of RASSF9 binding to RALA. Our data on residue swapping in RASSF proteins successfully validated the key role of hotspot residues in the RAS-RASSF interaction, particularly RASSF1-RALA, RASSF5-HRAS, and RASSF9-RIT1. To prove physiological relevance of identified RIT1 interactions with RASSF7 and RASSF9, we transfect Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293T cells with human RIT1 and used His-tagged RA domains of RASSF7 and RASSF9 to pull down HA-tagged RIT1 from the cell lysates. As a control, we used lysates of HRAS-transfected cells and His-ta"
https://openalex.org/W3157128360,"The SNF5 subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex has been shown to act as a tumor suppressor through multiple mechanisms, including impairing the ability of the oncoprotein transcription factor MYC to bind chromatin. Beyond SNF5, however, it is unknown to what extent MYC can access additional SWI/SNF subunits or how these interactions affect the ability of MYC to drive transcription, particularly in SNF5-null cancers. Here, we report that MYC interacts with multiple SWI/SNF components independent of SNF5. We show that MYC binds the pan-SWI/SNF subunit BAF155 through the BAF155 SWIRM domain, an interaction that is inhibited by the presence of SNF5. In SNF5-null cells, MYC binds with remaining SWI/SNF components to essential genes, although for a purpose that is distinct from chromatin remodeling. Analysis of MYC-SWI/SNF target genes in SNF5-null cells reveals that they are associated with core biological functions of MYC linked to protein synthesis. These data reveal that MYC can bind SWI/SNF in an SNF5-independent manner and that SNF5 modulates access of MYC to core SWI/SNF complexes. This work provides a framework in which to interrogate the influence of SWI/SNF on MYC function in cancers in which SWI/SNF or MYC are altered."

When the Institute of Medicine promulgated COI policies in 2011, few organizations met these requirements, but it is unknown if organizations have improved their policies since that time. We sought to evaluate current adherence to IOM standards of COI policies. Methods and findings We conducted a retrospective document review of COI policies and CPGs from organizations that published five or more CPGs between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019. Organizations were identified via CPG databases. COI policies were obtained from an internet search. We collected data on i) the number of organizations that have COI policies specific to CPG development, ii) the number of policies meeting each IOM standard and iii) the number of IOM standards met by each policy. COI disclosures from five CPGs of each organization were assessed for adherence to IOM standards. Among the 46 organizations that published 5 or more CPGs, 36 (78%) had a COI policy. Standard 2.2b (requiring divestment of financial COI) was met least frequently, by 2 of 36 (6%) organizations. Standard 2.1 (requiring disclosure of COI) was met most frequently, by 33 of 36 (92%) organizations. A total of 31 of 36 (86%) organizations met 4 or fewer of the 7 IOM standards. Among the 16 organizations limiting COI to a minority of the CPG panel (standard 2.4c) and the 15 organizations prohibiting COI among chairs or co-chairs (standard 2.4d), 12 (75%) and 10 (67%) organizations violated the respective standard in at least one CPG. The main limitations of our study are the exclusion of organizations producing fewer CPGs and ability to assess only publicly available policies. Conclusion Among organizations producing CPGs, COI policies frequently do not meet IOM standards, and organizations often violate their own policies. These shortcomings may undermine the public trust in and thus the utility of CPGs. CPG-producing organizations should improve their COI policies and their strategies to manage COI to increase the trustworthiness of CPGs."

Another member of this family, SLC4A4, which encodes the human electrogenic sodium bicarbonate cotransporter 1 (hNBCe1), is a sodium coupled transporter involved in electrogenic Na+-CO32− symport, necessary for carbonate/bicarbonate absorption in the renal proximal tubule (1Parker M.D. Boron W.F.

Despite their physiological significance and the large amount of functional mutagenesis data available for these two proteins, their transport mechanisms are poorly understood hindering the studies of disease states at the molecular level and the development of potential pharmacological strategies for treatment of these diseases.

The identity of the specific protein residues involved in substrate coordination in the binding pockets of hAE1 and hNBCe1, however, remains elusive. Moreover, hAE1 and hNBCe1 feature two negatively charged residues (E535 and E681 in hAE1 and D555 and D754 in hNBCe1) in their presumed anion binding pockets, which raises questions about the role of these residues in the control of ion dynamics in the SLC4 protein family, where all members have glutamate or aspartate at these locations (1Parker M.D. Boron W.F. The divergence, actions, roles, and relatives of sodium-coupled bicarbonate transporters.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 803-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The position and orientation of the anion substrates in the proposed binding pockets, which is necessary as a first step toward elucidation of the transport mechanism of the SLC4 family, is still unknown because the available crystal and cryo-EM structures did not resolve bound ions. To assess further the substrate binding motifs in the SLC4 protein family, we performed site identification by ligand competitive saturation (SILCS) (19Faller C.E. Raman E.P. MacKerell Jr., A.D. Guvench O. Site identification by ligand competitive saturation (SILCS) simulations for fragment-based drug design.Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1289: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) mapping of the binding pockets of hAE1 and hNBCe1, followed by a number of exploratory all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our simulations identify two putative substrate binding sites in the large permeation cavity of hAE1 and hNBCe1 and provide novel insights for specific protein–substrate interactions that may explain differences in transport mode between these two proteins. The results from the MD simulations were supported by functional mutagenesis and transport data on 18 hAE1 mutants and 19 hNBCe1 mutants. SILCS calculations employ Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and MD simulations to map protein regions with high affinity for various small solutes (fragments) with different structure and chemical properties, which are present in high concentrations in the simulation solutions. The flooding of the protein with the fragments and the corresponding fragment density maps (FragMaps) produced by SILCS can reveal previously unknown binding pockets and allosteric sites within the 3D protein matrix (19Faller C.E. Raman E.P. MacKerell Jr., A.D. Guvench O. Site identification by ligand competitive saturation (SILCS) simulations for fragment-based drug design.Methods Mol.

The SILCS FragMaps approach has been recently employed for identification of binding pockets, including drug-targetable sites in various proteins and for the development of novel drug molecules (20Weston S.

Figure 1 presents the SILCS fragment maps calculated in hAE1 and hNBCe1 for the oxygen atoms of the acetate anions used as surrogate ions for the SLC4 anionic substrates Cl−, HCO3−, and CO32− (cyan isomesh) and the nitrogen atoms of the methylammonium cations used as surrogate ions for the cotransported Na+ (yellow-orange isomesh). Although the acetate and methylammonium ions are larger than the anions normally transported by the SLC4 family proteins, they represent molecular probes with negative and positive charges with already developed parameters as part of SILCS. An enhanced density for these fragments in the protein center indicates that this region could accommodate as well the physiological ions, which are smaller and easier to fit in the putative binding sites. Both hAE1 and hNBCe1 feature a wide well-hydrated OF permeation cavity, lined with several positively charged (blue sticks) and negatively charged (red sticks) residues. These residues control the access of cationic and anionic fragments in the permeation cavity. Acetate can freely traverse the cavity to the protein center in both proteins and presents with a high density in the area of residues K539, R730, and K851 in hAE1 and residues K558, K559, and K924 in hNBCe1 (Fig. 1). Permeation of methylammonium to the protein center occurs to a significantly lower extent in both proteins because of the screening effects of the positively charged lysine and arginine residues in the cavity. However, a sizeable methylammonium density can be discerned in the vicinity of D754 of hNBCe1 implying the existence of a putative Na+ binding site in this area. In hAE1, the central R730 residue prevents methylammonium from reaching the protein center, and analogous methylammonium density is not observed in the area of E681. The acetate and methylammonium SILCS maps in Figure 1 identify areas in the binding pockets of hAE1 and hNBCe1 which could be potentially attractive to the physiological ions transported by these proteins (Cl−, CO32−, HCO3−, and Na+). To explore further the dynamics of Na+, Cl−, and HCO3− ions in the OF permeation cavity of hAE1 in conditions closer to the physiological environment, we performed two 1.2 μs long all-atom MD simulations starting from an empty (apo-) hAE1 protein embedded in a lipid bilayer solvated in either 150 mM NaCl, approximating the 0.9% NaCl in physiological saline, or an equimolar solution of 75 mM NaHCO3 + 75 mM NaCl, with elevated HCO3− concentration relative to Cl− (i.e., 1:1 instead of ~1:4 Cl−/HCO3− ratio (25Seifter J.L. Body fluid compartments, cell membrane ion transport, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance.Semin. Nephrol. 2019; 39: 368-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) for faster sampling of potentially rare HCO3− entry events. During these microsecond-long MD trajectories, HCO3− and Cl− ions from the solution penetrate freely and frequently (more than a hundred unique anion entry events, Fig. S1) into the wide well hydrated OF cavity of hAE1, which is consistent with the open nonoccluded conformations of the proteins. Two putative anion binding sites, central (S1) and entry (S2), identified as areas of high anion density (Fig. 2) can be seen in the hAE1 cavity within the area of high acetate oxygen density from our SILCS calculations (Fig. 1). The density at site S1 is significantly smaller which shows that occupation of this site occurs more rarely and for shorter times than site S2. Figure S1 illustrates the frequency of entry and residence times for the HCO3− and Cl− ions entering the cavity and central areas of hAE1, which is the location of sites S1 and S2 (Fig. S2), flanked by residues K542, K539, R730, and K851 during the 1.2 μs MD simulations. The portion of MD trajectory steps (in %) during which zero to 3 Cl−, HCO3− or Na+ ions are found in the areas of the permeation cavity of hAE1 and the protein center (location of site S1 and S2) are displayed in Figure S3. The anions often exchange with one another and HCO3− routinely persists for more than 100 ns in the protein center (average residence time 151.17 ns), while the presence of Cl− in this area is more short-lived (average residence times 3.96 ns and 24.44 ns in the presence and absence of HCO3−, respectively, Fig. S1). The long HCO3− residence times in the wide well-hydrated protein cavity indicate strong coordination of HCO3− in site S2. The cavity of hAE1 accommodates most often one or two Cl− or HCO3− anions, and the larger size of HCO3− does not hinder its entry within the cavity (Fig. S3). However, the protein central area is occupied by a single anion in most simulation steps in which anions managed to penetrate the cavity to the protein center (with anions mostly residing in the area of site S2 in such cases, Fig. 2). Entry of Na+ ions within the cavity occurs in less than 10% of the MD steps. Na+ ions did not reach the protein center in the 1.2 μs span of our MD simulations consistent with the results of our SILCS simulations where no significant methylammonium nitrogen density was detected in the protein center of hAE1 (Fig. 1, left). Similar permeation trends for the anions and Na+ were observed also in all 250 ns long MD simulations of hAE1 (Table 1 and Fig. S4).Table 1Cavity residence times of Na+ and anion substrate (in ns) in the tested hAE1 and hNBCe1 systems during the 250 ns long MD trajectoriesSystemBound ionsMutation/protonationAnion binding, nsNa+ binding, nshAE1+HCO3− (Trial 1)-250-+HCO3− (Trial 2)-250-+Cl− (Trial 1)-250-+Cl− (Trial 2)-30aIndicates the cavity residence time of the Cl− ion, bound to the protein at the very beginning of the MD simulation.

Considering the position of the two anion binding sites identified within the protein cavity from SILCS maps of hAE1 and hNBCe1 and 1.2 μs MD simulations on the apo-hAE1 system, it is likely that the entry site S2 is a transient binding site, serving as an attractor of anions from the extracellular solution, whereas the central site S1 provides the required substrate binding for the initiation of an ion translocation event. To assess in more detail the amino acid residues of the central site S1 and to probe the behavior of different ions bound to it, we conducted a number of 250 ns MD simulations starting from hAE1 or hNBCe1 loaded with different combinations of physiological ions. The ion/substrate binding stoichiometries studied in the current work include a single anion (CO32−, HCO3−, or Cl−), a single cation (Na+), and different 1:1 cation:anion combinations (Table 1) in accordance with previous functional data (7Reithmeier R.A.

Because the solutions used in our simulations contain Na+ and Cl−, other binding stoichiometries resulting from simultaneous entry of more than one cation or anion into the cavity of the studied systems could potentially be observed during the course of our MD trajectories. The initial anion placement in the protein center was guided by hAE1 and hNBCe1 SILCS maps for acetate oxygen and methylammonium nitrogen (Fig. 1), the anion density identifying site S1 in the 1.2 μs MD simulations of apo-hAE1 with 150 mM NaCl (Fig. 2), and Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatic maps (Fig. S5) of the binding pockets of hAE1 and hNBCe1 (see Experimental procedures). All systems were then subjected to 250 ns long unconstrained all-atom MD simulations, during which some anions dissociated from the initial binding site S1 into site S2 of the large permeation cavity of the protein (Fig. S2) or into the surrounding solution because of the OF nonoccluded conformation of hAE1 and hNBCe1 used in the simulations. The Na+ and substrate residence times in the permeation cavity of hAE1 and hNBCe1 are listed in Table 1. In the cases of Table 1 where the initially bound Cl− was substituted with a Cl− from the solution, the Cl− residence times and the frequency of Cl− entry are presented in Figure S4.

In early September 2019, the outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) became headline news in the United States.In August and September 2019, we conducted two cross-sectional online surveys with current and former smokers assessing attitudes and beliefs about e-cigarettes. Study one (n = 865) was collected before the EVALI outbreak was widely covered and study two (n = 344) was collected after the outbreak had become nation-wide news. We examined differences in perceptions and beliefs between time points.E-cigarette harm perceptions increased between study one (mean = 2.67) and study two (mean = 2.90, p < .05). Ever-users of e-cigarettes largely account for this change. Endorsement of the belief that e-cigarettes were risky and more likely to cause lung damage compared to cigarettes increased between studies (p < .05). Seventy eight percent of participants at study two were aware of the vaping illness story. Being aware of the story was associated with more endorsement of the belief that e-cigarettes were risky to use, but not that using e-cigarettes would make the participant more likely to get damaged lungs.When the stories about the health and safety of tobacco products dominate the public information environment, it presents an opportunity to change beliefs that are frequently targeted by paid health campaigns. Changes in participant's perceptions of e-cigarettes were associated with coverage of this large news story, underscoring the importance of working to ensure that coverage is a scientifically accurate as possible."
https://openalex.org/W3157366983,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide and KRAS is the most commonly mutated gene in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). The 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein GRP78/BiP is a key endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein and a major pro-survival effector of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas database and immunostain of patient tissues revealed that compared to normal lung, GRP78 expression is generally elevated in human lung cancers, including tumors bearing the KRASG12D mutation. To test the requirement of GRP78 in human lung oncogenesis, we generated mouse models containing floxed Grp78 and Kras Lox-Stop-Lox G12D (KrasLSL-G12D) alleles. Simultaneous activation of the KrasG12D allele and knockout of the Grp78 alleles were achieved in the whole lung or selectively in lung alveolar epithelial type 2 cells known to be precursors for adenomas that progress to LUAD. Here we report that GRP78 haploinsufficiency is sufficient to suppress KrasG12D-mediated lung tumor progression and prolong survival. Furthermore, GRP78 knockdown in human lung cancer cell line A427 (KrasG12D/+) leads to activation of UPR and apoptotic markers and loss of cell viability. Our studies provide evidence that targeting GRP78 represents a novel therapeutic approach to suppress mutant KRAS-mediated lung tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3158542512,"Aberrant or constitutive activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) contributes to various human inflammatory diseases and malignancies via the upregulation of genes involved in cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, inflammation, and metastasis. Thus, inhibition of NF-κB signaling has potential for therapeutic applications in cancer and inflammatory diseases. We reported previously that Nei-like DNA glycosylase 2 (NEIL2), a mammalian DNA glycosylase, is involved in the preferential repair of oxidized DNA bases from the transcriptionally active sequences via the transcription-coupled base excision repair pathway. We have further shown that Neil2-null mice are highly sensitive to tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)- and lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation. Both TNFα and lipopolysaccharide are potent activators of NF-κB. However, the underlying mechanism of NEIL2's role in the NF-κB-mediated inflammation remains elusive. Here, we have documented a noncanonical function of NEIL2 and demonstrated that the expression of genes, such as Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl10, Il6, and Tnfα, involved in inflammation and immune cell migration was significantly higher in both mock- and TNFα-treated Neil2-null mice compared with that in the WT mice. NEIL2 blocks NF-κB's binding to target gene promoters by directly interacting with the Rel homology region of RelA and represses proinflammatory gene expression as determined by co-immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays. Remarkably, intrapulmonary administration of purified NEIL2 via a noninvasive nasal route significantly abrogated binding of NF-κB to cognate DNA, leading to decreased expression of proinflammatory genes and neutrophil recruitment in Neil2-null as well as WT mouse lungs. Our findings thus highlight the potential of NEIL2 as a biologic for inflammation-associated human diseases."

We first eliminated N-glycosylation using an N41Q mutation, which resulted in an almost 3-fold increase in trafficking efficiency of wildtype (WT) PMP22 and a 10-fold increase for the severely unstable L16P disease mutant in HEK293 cells, with similar results in Schwann cells. Total cellular levels were also much higher for the WT/N41Q mutant, although not for the L16P/N41Q form. Depletion of oligosaccharyltransferase OST-A and OST-B subunits revealed that WT PMP22 is N-glycosylated posttranslationally by OST-B, whereas L16P is cotranslationally glycosylated by OST-A. Quantitative proteomic screens revealed similarities and differences in the interactome for WT, glycosylation-deficient, and unstable mutant forms of PMP22 and also suggested that L16P is sequestered at earlier stages of endoplasmic reticulum quality control. CRISPR knockout studies revealed a role for retention in endoplasmic reticulum sorting receptor 1 (RER1) in limiting the trafficking of all three forms, for UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1 (UGGT1) in limiting the trafficking of WT and L16P but not N41Q, and calnexin (CNX) in limiting the trafficking of WT and N41Q but not L16P. This work shows that N-glycosylation is a limiting factor to forward trafficking PMP22 and sheds light on the proteins involved in its quality control."

https://openalex.org/W3157169103,"Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of various arthropod-borne viral (arboviral) diseases such as dengue and Zika, is a popular laboratory model in vector biology. However, its maintenance in laboratory conditions is difficult, mostly because the females require blood meals to complete oogenesis, which is often provided as sheep blood. The outermost layer of the mosquito cuticle is consists of lipids which protects against numerous entomopathogens, prevents desiccation and plays an essential role in signalling processes. The aim of this work was to determine how the replacement of human blood with sheep blood affects the cuticular and internal FFA profiles of mosquitoes reared in laboratory culture. The individual FFAs present in cuticular and internal extracts from mosquito were identified and quantified by GC-MS method. The normality of their distribution was checked using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Student's t-test was used to compare them. GC-MS analysis revealed similar numbers of internal and cuticular FFAs in the female mosquitoes fed sheep blood by membrane (MFSB) and naturally fed human blood (NFHB), however MFSB group demonstrated 3.1 times greater FFA concentrations in the cuticular fraction and 1.4 times the internal fraction than the NFHB group. In the MFSB group, FFA concentration was 1.6 times higher in the cuticular than the internal fraction, while for NFHB, FFA concentration was 1.3 times lower in the cuticular than the internal fraction. The concentration of C18:3 acid was 223 times higher in the internal fraction than the cuticle in the MHSB group but was absent in the NFHB group. MFSB mosquito demonstrate different FFA profiles to wild mosquitoes, which might influence their fertility and the results of vital processes studied under laboratory conditions. The membrane method of feeding mosquitoes is popular, but our research indicates significant differences in the FFA profiles of MFSB and NFHB. Such changes in FFA profile might influence female fertility, as well as other vital processes studied in laboratory conditions, such as the response to pesticides. Our work indicates that sheep blood has potential shortcomings as a substitute feed for human blood, as its use in laboratory studies may yield different results to those demonstrated by free-living mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W3158503443,"The calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) cyclosporine A and tacrolimus comprise the basis of immunosuppressive regimes in all solid organ transplantation. However, long-term or high exposure to CNI leads to histological and functional renal damage (CNI-associated nephrotoxicity). In the kidney, proximal tubule cells are the only cells that metabolize CNI and these cells are believed to play a central role in the origin of the toxicity for this class of drugs, although the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Several studies have reported oxidative stress as an important mediator of CNI-associated nephrotoxicity in response to CNI exposure in different available proximal tubule cell models. However, former models often made use of supra-therapeutic levels of tissue drug exposure. In addition, they were not shown to express the relevant enzymes (e.g., CYP3A5) and transporters (e.g., P-glycoprotein) for the metabolism of CNI in human proximal tubule cells. Moreover, the used methods for detecting ROS were potentially prone to false positive results. In this study, we used a novel proximal tubule cell model established from human allograft biopsies that demonstrated functional expression of relevant enzymes and transporters for the disposition of CNI. We exposed these cells to CNI concentrations as found in tissue of stable solid organ transplant recipients with therapeutic blood concentrations. We measured the glutathione redox balance in this cell model by using organelle-targeted variants of roGFP2, a highly sensitive green fluorescent reporter protein that dynamically equilibrates with the glutathione redox couple through the action of endogenous glutaredoxins. Our findings provide evidence that CNI, at concentrations commonly found in allograft biopsies, do not alter the glutathione redox balance in mitochondria, peroxisomes, and the cytosol. However, at supra-therapeutic concentrations, cyclosporine A but not tacrolimus increases the ratio of oxidized/reduced glutathione in the mitochondria, suggestive of imbalances in the redox environment."
https://openalex.org/W3157968224,"Background The data on the COVID-19 patients who were discharged to self-quarantine is lacking. Aim The aim of the study was to investigate the percentage of COVID-19 positive patients that were hospitalized within a three-week period after discharge from ED to self-quarantine. Methods The patients who had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR of the nasopharyngeal swab and were discharged from ED of a tertiary care hospital in the USA to self-quarantine from March 01- July 31, 2020, were included. Patients were divided into two groups based on serum albumin levels and were followed up for three weeks to see if low level of albumin increased the risk of hospitalization. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to study the effect of albumin level and outcomes. Results A total of 112 patients were included in the study out of which 65 had low serum albumin (&lt;3.5 g/dL) and 47 had normal serum albumin (≥3.5 g/dL). More than 10% of patients discharged to self-quarantine needed hospitalization within three weeks. The Low albumin group had more co-morbidities at baseline. The low serum albumin group had 10 (15.38%) vs 2 (4.26%), p = 0.06 hospitalizations as compared to the normal serum albumin group. The multivariate logistic regression analysis did not reveal lower odds of hospitalization in the group with normal albumin, (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.03–1.92, p = 0.19) after controlling for age, sex, and various co-morbidities. Conclusion The low serum albumin was not associated with the risk of hospitalization in COVID-19 patients who were initially discharged to self-quarantine."
https://openalex.org/W3159742121,"The aim was to explore the potential role of the placenta for the risk of stillbirth at term in pregnancies of obese women.This was a case-control study comparing placental findings from term stillbirths with placental findings from live born infants. Cases were singleton term stillbirths to normal weight or obese women, identified in the Stockholm stillbirth database, n = 264 and n = 87, respectively. Controls were term singletons born alive to normal weight or obese women, delivered between 2002-2005 and between 2018-2019. Placentas were compared between women with stillborn and live-born infants, using logistic regression analyses.A long and hyper coiled cord, cord thrombosis and velamentous cord insertion were stronger risk factors for stillbirth in obese women compared to normal weight women. When these variables were adjusted for in the logistic regression analysis, also adjusted for potential confounders, the odds ratio for stillbirth in obese women decreased from 1.89 (CI 1.24-2.89) to 1.63 (CI 1.04-2.56).Approximately one fourth of the effect of obesity on the risk of stillbirth in term pregnancies is explained by umbilical cord associated pathology."

https://openalex.org/W3157981188,"Backgrounds This study was undertaken to investigate the impact of coexisting chronic kidney disease (CKD) on short- and long-term outcomes of laparoscopic gastrectomy in patients with gastric cancer (GC). Methods We reviewed the data of 798 patients treated for GC by laparoscopic gastrectomy. All procedures took place between January 2010 and December 2017. Patients were divided into three groups according to their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): severe CKD group, 44 patients with eGFR &lt; 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; moderate CKD group, 117 patients with 45 ≤ eGFR &lt; 60; control group, 637 patients with eGFR ≥ 60. Results Based on multivariate analysis, severe CKD (eGFR &lt; 45) emerged as an independent predictor of anastomotic leak (Hazard ratio 4.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.62–11.54). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates by group were 46.3% (severe CKD), 76.6% (moderate CKD), and 81.5% (control). Multivariate analysis likewise identified severe CKD (eGFR &lt; 45) as an independent correlate of poor 5-year OS. The 5-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates did not differ significantly by group. Conclusions An eGFR value less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 is a useful factor for predicting both anastomotic leak and 5-year OS in GC patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrectomy. Clinical care to improve eGFR should be reinforced before and after gastrectomy for GC patients with severe CKD."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether failure of non-invasive respiratory support, including HFNC and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), was also associated with the risk of mortality even if it occurs in the earlier phase. We retrospectively analyzed 59 intubated patients for acute respiratory failure due to lung diseases between April 2014 and June 2018. We divided the patients into 2 groups according to the time from starting non-invasive ventilatory support until their intubation: ≤ 6 hours failure and > 6 hours failure group. We evaluated the differences in the ICU mortality between these two groups. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the highest mortality in the > 6 hours failure group as compared to the ≤ 6 hours failure group, with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01). It was also associated with a statistically significant increased 30-day mortality and decreased ventilator weaning rate. The ICU mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure caused by lung diseases was increased if the time until failure of HFNC and NPPV was more than 6 hours."

Background Mental health service utilization has many facilitating and hindering factors present at different socio-ecological levels. Stigma and lack of awareness in the community have been identified as the major barriers for mental health service demand and access worldwide. Methods A cross-sectional qualitative study was conducted in Arghakhanchi district of Nepal in July-August 2019 that collected information through face-to-face In-depth and Key Informant Interviews of three categories of participants selected judgmentally. Thirty-two purposively selected participants from the three categories were interviewed using validated interview guidelines. Thematic analysis was performed using RQDA package for EZR software. Validation of translated transcripts, member checking and inter-coder percent agreement were performed to maintain rigor in the study. Results Mental health stigma and inadequate awareness were identified as major factors that caused barriers for mental health service utilization at community level. They also influenced different factors at other socio-ecological levels to act as barriers. Awareness in community along with accessibility and availability of comprehensive mental health services were recommended by the participants for increasing service utilization from Primary Health Care facilities. Conclusion Individual, family and community awareness could help reduce and/or eliminate mental health stigma. Accessibility of health facilities and availability of comprehensive mental health services in Primary Health Care facilities could help increase service utilization from those facilities."
https://openalex.org/W3158979651,"Differential evolution (DE) is favored by scholars for its simplicity and efficiency, but its ability to balance exploration and exploitation needs to be enhanced. In this paper, a hybrid differential evolution with gaining-sharing knowledge algorithm (GSK) and harris hawks optimization (HHO) is proposed, abbreviated as DEGH. Its main contribution lies are as follows. First, a hybrid mutation operator is constructed in DEGH, in which the two-phase strategy of GSK, the classical mutation operator ""rand/1"" of DE and the soft besiege rule of HHO are used and improved, forming a double-insurance mechanism for the balance between exploration and exploitation. Second, a novel crossover probability self-adaption strategy is proposed to strengthen the internal relation among mutation, crossover and selection of DE. On this basis, the crossover probability and scaling factor jointly affect the evolution of each individual, thus making the proposed algorithm can better adapt to various optimization problems. In addition, DEGH is compared with eight state-of-the-art DE algorithms on 32 benchmark functions. Experimental results show that the proposed DEGH algorithm is significantly superior to the compared algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W3158980649,"Background Central venous access (CVA) is a frequent procedure taught in medical residencies. However, since CVA is a high-risk procedure requiring a detailed teaching and learning process to ensure trainee proficiency, it is necessary to determine objective differences between the expert’s and the novice’s performance to guide novice practitioners during their training process. This study compares experts’ and novices’ biomechanical variables during a simulated CVA performance. Methods Seven experts and seven novices were part of this study. The participants’ motion data during a CVA simulation procedure was collected using the Vicon Motion System. The procedure was divided into four stages for analysis, and each hand’s speed, acceleration, and jerk were obtained. Also, the procedural time was analyzed. Descriptive analysis and multilevel linear models with random intercept and interaction were used to analyze group, hand, and stage differences. Results There were statistically significant differences between experts and novices regarding time, speed, acceleration, and jerk during a simulated CVA performance. These differences vary significantly by the procedure stage for right-hand acceleration and left-hand jerk. Conclusions Experts take less time to perform the CVA procedure, which is reflected in higher speed, acceleration, and jerk values. This difference varies according to the procedure’s stage, depending on the hand and variable studied, demonstrating that these variables could play an essential role in differentiating between experts and novices, and could be used when designing training strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3157761420,"The lesser-known unconventional myosin 16 protein is essential in proper neuronal functioning and has been implicated in cell cycle regulation. Its longer Myo16b isoform contains a C-terminal tail extension (Myo16Tail), which has been shown to play a role in the neuronal phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway. Myo16Tail mediates the actin cytoskeleton remodeling, downregulates the actin dynamics at the postsynaptic site of dendritic spines, and is involved in the organization of the presynaptic axon terminals. However, the functional and structural features of this C-terminal tail extension are not well known. Here, we report the purification and biophysical characterization of the Myo16Tail by bioinformatics, fluorescence spectroscopy, and CD. Our results revealed that the Myo16Tail is functionally active and interacts with the N-terminal ankyrin domain of myosin 16, suggesting an intramolecular binding between the C and N termini of Myo16 as an autoregulatory mechanism involving backfolding of the motor domain. In addition, the Myo16Tail possesses high structural flexibility and a solvent-exposed hydrophobic core, indicating the largely unstructured, intrinsically disordered nature of this protein region. Some secondary structure elements were also observed, indicating that the Myo16Tail likely adopts a molten globule–like structure. These structural features imply that the Myo16Tail may function as a flexible display site particularly relevant in post-translational modifications, regulatory functions such as backfolding, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3158422634,"Platelets are key mediators of physiological hemostasis and pathological thrombosis, whose function must be carefully balanced by signaling downstream of receptors such as protease-activated receptor (PAR)4. Protein kinase C (PKC) is known to regulate various aspects of platelet function. For instance, PKCδ is known to regulate dense granule secretion, which is important for platelet activation. However, the mechanism by which PKCδ regulates this process as well as other facets of platelet activity is unknown. We speculated that the way PKCδ regulates platelet function may be because of the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on PKCδ. We investigated phosphorylation of PKCδ following glycoprotein VI-mediated and PAR4-mediated platelet activation and found that Y311 is selectively phosphorylated when PAR4 is activated in human platelets. Therefore, we generated PKCδ Y311F knock-in mice, which are viable and have no gross abnormalities. However, PKCδY311F mice have significantly enhanced tail-bleeding times compared with WT littermate controls, which means hemostasis is interrupted. Furthermore, PKCδY311F mice exhibit longer time to carotid artery occlusion compared with WT control using a ferric chloride in vivo thrombosis model, indicating that the phosphorylation of PKCδ Y311 is prothrombotic. Washed platelets from PKCδY311F mice have reduced reactivity after stimulation with a PAR-4 agonist indicating its importance in platelet signaling. The phenotype observed in Y311F mouse platelets is because of reduced thromboxane generation, as an inhibitor of thromboxane generation equalizes the PKCδY311F platelet response to that of WT. Therefore, phosphorylation of PKCδ on Y311 is important for regulation of platelet function and specifically thromboxane generation, which reinforces platelet activation.

Platelets are anucleate cells that travel close to the vascular wall and respond to vascular damage (1Hartwig J. Italiano Jr., J. The birth of the platelet.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 1580-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). They are key mediators of both physiological hemostasis and pathological thrombosis (2Scharf R.E.

Platelet signaling in primary haemostasis and arterial thrombus formation: Part 2.Hamostaseologie. 2018; 38: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Platelet signaling and activity exists in a delicate balance between hemorrhage and occlusion. Weak platelet reactivity can lead to bleeding, whereas strong platelet reactivity can lead to thrombosis. It is, therefore, important to understand the nuances of signaling that regulate platelet activation. Primary platelet signaling, such as that which is initiated by glycoprotein VI (GPVI) engagement of collagen, leads to granule release and production of thromboxane (4Clemetson K.J. Clemetson J.M. Platelet collagen receptors.Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thromboxane and the granular contents feedback on the platelet in an autocrine and paracrine manner to reinforce the original signal. These secondary signals also serve to recruit new platelets to the site of injury. Pharmacological manipulation of the secondary signals induced by adenosine diphosphate, which is released from dense granules and binds the surface receptors P2Y1 and P2Y12, and thromboxane are targets of antiplatelet therapy (5Koski R. Kennedy B. Comparative review of oral P2Y12 inhibitors.P T. 2018; 43: 352-357PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets express many types of receptors on their surface including GPVI and protease-activated receptors (PAR) (6Li Z. Delaney M.K. O'Brien K.A. Du X. Signaling during platelet adhesion and activation.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2010; 30: 2341-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). PARs expressed on the platelet surface are activated by proteolytic cleavage by thrombin (7Coughlin S.R. How the protease thrombin talks to cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PAR-induced platelet activation is caused by a host of platelet signaling pathways that lead to shape change, granular secretion, and aggregate formation. One protein involved in this pathway is protein kinase C (PKC) (12Chari R. Getz T. Nagy Jr., B. Bhavaraju K. Mao Y. Bynagari Y.S. Murugappan S. Nakayama K. Kunapuli S.P.

PKC is a member of the serine/threonine family of protein kinases, and the isoforms of PKC are categorized according to their cofactor requirements. Conventional PKC isoforms include α, βI, βII, and γ and require calcium and diacylglycerol for their activation. Novel PKC isoforms include δ, ε, θ, and η and require only diacylglycerol for activation. Atypical PKCs require phospholipids for their activation and include the isoforms ι, λ, and ζ (13Violin J.D.

CGX1037 is a novel PKC isoform delta selective inhibitor in platelets.Platelets. 2015; 26: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). PKCδ is phosphorylated on a number of tyrosine residues which serve to regulate the kinase. Mouse PKCδ contains 19 tyrosine residues including Y311, which is located in the hinge region and regulates PKCδ conformation and is important for kinase activity and subcellular localization (26Jackson D.N. Foster D.A. The enigmatic protein kinase Cdelta: Complex roles in cell proliferation and survival.FASEB J. 2004; 18: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 27Steinberg S.F. Distinctive activation mechanisms and functions for protein kinase Cdelta.Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). However, the impact of Y311 phosphorylation on PKCδ function in platelets has not been investigated. In this report, we show that Y311 is differentially phosphorylated by GPVI or PAR-4 agonists. We produced a knock-in mouse with a mutated PKCδ Y311 that cannot be phosphorylated (Y311F). We provide evidence that suggests PKCδ Y311 is important for thromboxane generation in mouse platelets, which impacts in vivo regulation of hemostasis and thrombosis. We have previously shown that PKCδ differentially regulates platelet reactivity (16Murugappan S. Tuluc F. Dorsam R.T. Shankar H. Kunapuli S.P.

A potential explanation for this could be that phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on PKCδ could determine its action. As one can see in Figure 1A, PKCδ has a number of tyrosine residues that reside within its different domains. One such residue is Y311 located within the hinge region. An analysis of Y311 phosphorylation using an agonist for PAR4 (AYPGKF) and an agonist for GPVI (collagen-related peptide [CRP]) showed that Y311 maybe an important residue for PKCδ function. We observed that phosphorylation of Y311 is rapid and pronounced in human platelets in response to AYPGKF (Fig. 1, B and C). Whereas the response to CRP is slower though just as pronounced 60 s after agonist addition (Fig. 1, D and E). Interestingly, when feedback is limited using indomethacin to block thromboxane production, MRS2179 to antagonize P2Y1, and AR-C69931MX to antagonize P2Y12, we observed very little change in Y311 phosphorylation in response to AYPGKF indicating that Y311 is phosphorylated downstream of the PAR4 receptor. Conversely, Y311 phosphorylation was greatly reduced in response to CRP when feedback was inhibited using AR-C69931MX and YM254890, which is a Gαq inhibitor. This suggests that the Y311 phosphorylation of PKCδ we observe in response to CRP is almost entirely because of feedback. Specifically, YM254890 would block the feedback response through P2Y1 and the thromboxane prostanoid receptor, which are both coupled to Gαq. Therefore, Y311 may be a crucial phosphorylation site that dictates PKCδ function and may help explain the differential regulation of platelet response that we previously reported in PKCδ null mice. To expand our studies of Y311 on PKCδ, we produced a PKCδ Y311F mouse line. We previously reported that Y311 on PKCδ is phosphorylated following stimulation of PAR4 in mouse platelets and that this phosphorylation is dependent on the Src family kinase, Lyn (28Chari R. Kim S. Murugappan S. Sanjay A. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P.

J. 2009; 417: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To better understand the functional role of phosphorylation of Y311 on PKCδ, we produced PKCδ Y311F knock-in (KI) mice that cannot be phosphorylated on Y311, using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique. Genotyping was conducted using PCR with the following primers: Prkcd I9F 5’-GGTTCTGCCCTCTGACGTCATCG-3’ and Prkcd I10R 5’-GCTAGGCAAGGGGCCTTGGAG. The resultant PKCδ Y311F knock-in product has a sequence that can be cleaved by the restriction enzyme SspI, whereas the WT product cannot be cleaved. Therefore, the WT mice will have the full-length product, which is 432 bp, the heterozygous mice will have the full-length product of 432 bp and the cleaved products of 147 bp and 285 bp, and the KI will have only the cleaved products of 147 bp and 285 bp (Fig. 2A). We confirmed the loss of Y311 phosphorylation of PKCδ using washed mouse platelets stimulated with CRP, which is an agonist for GPVI (Fig. 2B). As one can see the WT platelets displayed strong phosphorylation of PKCδ Y311, whereas we were unable to detect any phosphorylation of Y311 in the platelets isolated from KI mice. PKCδ Y311F mice breed normally and produce pups at expected Mendellian ratios. Furthermore, the mice display no gross abnormalities, gain weight normally, and have normal blood cell counts (Table 1).Table 1Blood cell counts in PKCδY311F and WT littermate control miceParameterWTPKCδ Y311FWBC (106/ml)10.22 ± 1.409.78 ± 2.15NE (106/ml)1.10 ± 0.321.06 ± 0.16LY (106/ml)8.58 ± 1.318.31 ± 1.92Plt (106/ml)721 ± 37.58715 ± 78.69MPV (fl)4.15 ± 0.104.05 ± 0.06LY, lymphocyte; MPV, mean platelet volume; NE, neutrophil; Plt, platelet; WBC, white blood cell. Open table in a new tab LY, lymphocyte; MPV, mean platelet volume; NE, neutrophil; Plt, platelet; WBC, white blood cell. To determine the consequence of the PKCδ Y311F mutation on hemostasis in vivo, we performed tail bleeding experiments on WT, heterozygous, and homozygous PKCδ Y311F mice. Interestingly, both the heterozygous and the homozygous knock-in mice bled for significantly longer than the WT littermate control mice (Fig. 3A). This suggests that the Y311F point mutation disrupts hemostasis. To determine whether or not thrombosis is also altered, we injured the carotid artery of WT and PKCδ Y311F mice using the FeCl3 injury model. We found that time to vessel occlusion was significantly increased in the PKCδ Y311F KI mice compared with WT littermate control mice (Fig. 3, B and C). These data are consistent with our tail-bleeding data and taken together suggest that thrombosis and hemostasis are both inhibited by the mutation of Y311 on PKCδ. Our data presented above suggests that Y311 on PKCδ is phosphorylated directly downstream of the PAR4 receptor. To determine how PKCδ Y311 phosphorylation impacts platelet reactivity and, therefore, hemostasis and thrombosis, we used washed platelets from Y311F mice and WT littermate controls and stimulated them with AYPGKF (a PAR-4 agonist). We monitored aggregation and ATP secretion following stimulation with three different concentrations of AYPGKF and found that ATP secretion following stimulation with either 100 μM or 200 μM AYPGKF is reduced in Y311F platelets compared with WT platelets (Fig. 4, A–C), although aggregation was unaltered. These data are in agreement with our in vivo data that suggest Y311F positively regulates platelet function. Because we observe reduced platelet reactivity to low concentrations of AYPGKF, which is often driven by thromboxane production, we chose to investigate thromboxane generation in Y311F platelets. Thromboxane production occurs swiftly following platelet stimulation and drives platelet activation. Therefore, we pretreated washed platelets from Y311F mice and WT control mice with vehicle control (dimethyl sulfoxide) or indomethacin, an inhibitor of COX-2, which is part of the thromboxane production pathway, and stimulated them with AYPGKF. In agreement with our data presented above, dimethyl sulfoxide pretreatment resulted in reduced secretion of ATP in Y311F platelets compared with WT platelets. Interestingly, pretreatment with indomethacin results in no difference in ATP secretion between Y311F platelets and WT control platelets (Fig. 5, A–C). These data strongly suggest that thromboxane production is responsible for the phenotype observed in Y311F mice and that Y311 phosphorylation is integral for thromboxane production in platelets. We have previously demonstrated that extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2) phosphorylation regulates thromboxane generation (30Kahner B.N. Dorsam R.T. Kim S. Shankar H. Kitamura D.

Haemost. 2006; 4: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in WT and Y311F mouse platelets stimulated with AYPGKF for 3 min via SDS-PAGE. We found that ERK1/2 phosphorylation was reduced in Y311F platelets stimulated with low concentrations of AYPGKF (Fig. 6, A and B). These data suggest that Y311 phosphorylation on PKCδ may regulate thromboxane generation. To investigate this potential mechanism, we stimulated washed platelets from Y311F mice and platelets from WT control mice with AYPGKF. We snap froze the samples at the conclusion of the experiment and used a kit from Enzo scientific to measure thromboxane production. We determined that thromboxane production was indeed reduced in samples collected using platelets from Y311F mice compared with those collected from WT platelets at lower concentrations of AYPGKF (Fig. 6C). These results, coupled with our data presented in Figure 5, strongly suggest that Y311 on PKCδ is an important mediator of thromboxane generation. In this report, we demonstrate that Y311 phosphorylation on PKCδ is important for thromboxane production and is phosphorylated directly downstream of PAR4, but not directly downstream of GPVI. We show that platelets from Y311F mice have reduced reactivity compared with platelets from WT mice when G Protein coupled receptors are stimulated. We demonstrate that this phenotype is also observed using in vivo models of hemostasis and thrombosis. The mechanism behind reduced platelet reactivity and impaired hemostasis and thrombosis is inhibited thromboxane production as we can reverse the phenotype observed in Y311F platelets via preincubation with indomethacin, an inhibitor of thromboxane production. A summary of this mechanism is presented in Figure 7 along with the inhibitors and antagonists we used to isolate the signaling Y311 phosphorylated PKCδ is involved in. Y311 phosphorylation on PKCδ regulates thromboxane generation. In this report, we demonstrate that PAR4-dependent platelet dense granule secretion is reduced and that thromboxane generation is reduced when either 100 μM or 200 μM AYPGKF is used as an agonist. Further, when using indomethacin, which inhibits thromboxane production, before stimulation with AYPGKF, the phenotype observed in PKCδY311F platelets and described above is normalized. These data strongly suggest that Y311 on PKCδ is involved in thromboxane generation. Given our previous data that PKCδ differentially regulates platelet activation and that our Western blot data in Figure 1 shows differential phosphorylation of Y311 on PKCδ, we hypothesized that we would observe reduced reactivity to AYPGKF in platelets from Y311F mice, which our data supports (12Chari R.

PKCδ is tyrosine phosphorylated on a number of different sites within conserved and variable regions which makes PKCδ unique among PKCs (27Steinberg S.F.

The role of tyrosine phosphorylation of protein kinase C delta in infection and inflammation.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20: 1498Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation is known to influence PKCδ activation and conformation. Specifically, Y311 on PKCδ lies within the hinge region of the kinase, which is one of the variable regions (V4) that are poorly conserved across PKCs (36Mellor H. Parker P.J. The extended protein kinase C superfamily.Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). In vitro assays have demonstrated that Y311 on PKCδ is a target for Src, which may enhance target specificity for PKCδ (37Rybin V.O. Guo J. Sabri A. Elouardighi H. Schaefer E. Steinberg S.F. Stimulus-specific differences in protein kinase C delta localization and activation mechanisms in cardiomyocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19350-19361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, Src phosphorylation of Y311 on PKCδ may be responsible for directing PKCδ to a target that is important for thromboxane production downstream of PAR4 and likely any G Protein coupled receptor that is coupled to Gαq based on our data in Figure 1. That exact target is unknown at this time, but it would be worthwhile to elucidate. PKCδ Y311 phosphorylation occurs downstream of Gαq. In Figure 1, we demonstrate that Y311 on PKCδ is phosphorylated when either an agonist of PAR4 or GPVI is used. However, when feedback is blocked downstream of PAR4, Y311 phosphorylation is reduced only a minor and statistically insignificant amount. When feedback is blocked downstream of GPVI using an inhibitor of Gαq, very little Y311 phosphorylation remains, which strongly suggests that Y311 phosphorylation is Gαq dependent. A similar experiment using the Gαq inhibitor YM254890 and stimulating platelets with a PAR4 agonist would be inconclusive as no platelet aggregation or secretion would occur because PAR4 is coupled to Gαq. PKCδ Y311 phosphorylation is important for in vivo platelet function. We observed that hemostasis was inhibited, as tail bleeding times were enhanced in PKCδY311F mice. This is in agreement with our data that demonstrated reduced thromboxane production in Y311F mouse platelets. This would be akin to a human taking aspirin, which inhibits COX-2 and subsequent thromboxane production and is associated with bleeding. We also demonstrated that thrombosis was inhibited, as the time to carotid artery occlusion was inhibited following injury in PKCδY311F mice compared with WT mice. This is in contrast to our previous report in which we show that thrombosis is unaltered in PKCδ knockout mice (12Chari R. Getz T. Nagy Jr., B. Bhavaraju K. Mao Y. Bynagari Y.S. Murugappan S. Nakayama K. Kunapuli S.P. Protein kinase C[delta] differentially regulates platelet functional responses.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The likely explanation for this discrepancy is that PKCδ has many tyrosine residues that can be phosphorylated, and they reside in various domains on PKCδ as outlined in Figure 1. Other tyrosine phosphorylation sites on PKCδ may influence its activation, conformation, or target specificity. In this report, we focused on one specific tyrosine residue on PKCδ. However, each individual tyrosine residue may regulate a different facet of PKCδ function. For instance, Y155 is located between the pseudo-substrate motif (autoinhibition) and the C1A domain (Fig. 1A), which serves as a diacylglycerol/phosphatidylserine/phorbol ester sensor and is responsible for a number of different PKCδ functions (27Steinberg S.F.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35491-35498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We would hypothesize that phosphorylation of Y155 may direct PKCδ to a GPVI-specific substrate that is important for controlling GPVI signaling only and have no effect on PAR-4 mediated signaling, whereas Y311 phosphorylation is important for thromboxane production and occurs downstream of Gαq. This could explain why we observe an increase in GPVI-mediated platelet activation in PKCδ knockout platelets, but reduced platelet activation in PKCδ Y311F platelets as reported here. The data presented in this manuscript demonstrate that phosphorylation of specific tyrosines on PKCδ can greatly influence its function. Preventing phosphorylation of Y311 via genetic modification caused a decrease in thromboxane generation and subsequent platelet function both in vitro and in vivo. It will be interesting to see how other tyrosine sites regulate PKCδ function. All reagents were purchased from Thermo Fischer Scientific unless otherwise stated.

The resulting platelets were counted using a Hemavet 950FS blood cell analyzer (Drew Scientific). Platelet counts were adjusted to a final concentration of 1.5 × 108 cells/ml in N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N’-2-ethanesulfonic acid-buffered (pH 7.4) Tyrode’s solution containing 0.2 U/ml apyrase. All platelet aggregation and secretion experiments were carried out using a lumi-aggregometer (Chrono-log) at 37 °C under stirring conditions. Platelet aggregation was measured using light transmission and ATP secretion was measured using Chrono-lume (a luciferin/luciferase reagent). Western blotting procedures were performed as described previously (39Kostyak J.C. Mauri B.R. Dangelmaier C. Patel A. Zhou Y. Eble J.A. Tsygankov A.Y. McKenzie S.E. Kunapuli S.P. TULA-2 deficiency enhances platelet functional responses to CLEC-2 agonists.TH Open. 2018; 2: e411-e419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, platelets were stimulated for the indicated time points in a Lumi-aggregometer with either a GPVI or a PAR-4 agonist. The reaction was stopped by precipitating the platelet proteins using 0.6 N HClO4 and washed with water before the addition of sample loading buffer. Platelet protein samples were then boiled for 5 min before resolution by SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then blocked using Odyssey blocking buffer and incubated overnight with primary antibodies against the indicated protein. The membranes were then washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 before incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed again and imaged using a Li-Cor Odyssey infrared imaging system. Mouse tail bleeding was conducted as previously described (40Patel A. Kostyak J. Dangelmaier C. Badolia R.

Mice aged 4 to 6 weeks were anesthetized before amputation of the distal 3 mm of the tail. The tail was then immersed in 37 °C saline, and bleeding was monitored. If bleeding continued for greater than 600 s, then bleeding was halted manually by applying pressure. FeCl3 was used to injure the carotid artery as previously described (40Patel A. Kostyak J.

https://openalex.org/W3158608589,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen that causes considerable human morbidity and mortality, particularly in nosocomial infections and individuals with cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa can adapt to surface growth by undergoing swarming motility, a rapid multicellular movement that occurs on viscous soft surfaces with amino acids as a nitrogen source. Here we tested the small synthetic host defense peptide, innate defense regulator 1018, and found that it inhibited swarming motility at concentrations as low as 0.75 μg/ml, well below the MIC for strain PA14 planktonic cells (64 μg/ml). A screen of the PA14 transposon insertion mutant library revealed 29 mutants that were more tolerant to peptide 1018 during swarming, five of which demonstrated significantly greater swarming than the WT in the presence of peptide. Transcriptional analysis (RNA-Seq) of cells that were inoculated on swarming plates containing 1.0 μg/ml peptide revealed differential expression of 1,190 genes compared to cells swarming on plates without peptide. Furthermore, 1018 treatment distinctly altered the gene expression profile of cells when compared to that untreated cells in the centre of the swarm colonies. Peptide-treated cells exhibited changes in the expression of genes implicated in the stringent stress response including those regulated by anr, which is involved in anaerobic adaptation, indicative of a mechanism by which 1018 might inhibit swarming motility. Overall, this study illustrates potential mechanisms by which peptide 1018 inhibits swarming surface motility, an important bacterial adaptation associated with antibiotic resistance, virulence, and dissemination of P. aeruginosa."
https://openalex.org/W3159117731,"Although many bacterial species do not possess proteasome systems, the actinobacteria, including the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, use proteasome systems for targeted protein removal. Previous structural analyses of the mycobacterial proteasome ATPase Mpa revealed a general structural conservation with the archaeal proteasome-activating nucleotidase and eukaryotic proteasomal Rpt1–6 ATPases, such as the N-terminal coiled-coil domain, oligosaccharide-/oligonucleotide-binding domain, and ATPase domain. However, Mpa has a unique β-grasp domain that in the ADP-bound crystal structure appears to interfere with the docking to the 20S proteasome core particle (CP). Thus, it is unclear how Mpa binds to proteasome CPs. In this report, we show by cryo-EM that the Mpa hexamer in the presence of a degradation substrate and ATP forms a gapped ring, with two of its six ATPase domains being highly flexible. We found that the linkers between the oligonucleotide-binding and ATPase domains undergo conformational changes that are important for function, revealing a previously unappreciated role of the linker region in ATP hydrolysis–driven protein unfolding. We propose that this gapped ring configuration is an intermediate state that helps rearrange its β-grasp domains and activating C termini to facilitate engagement with proteasome CPs. This work provides new insights into the crucial process of how an ATPase interacts with a bacterial proteasome protease."
https://openalex.org/W3158608777,"Parent scientists lead a journey to bring surveillance severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing to public schools across the state of Massachusetts and beyond. Parent scientists lead a journey to bring surveillance severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing to public schools across the state of Massachusetts and beyond. “We needed to try to replace fear with data.”“Our first Zoom call had 6 people. By the 12th, we had nearly 100.”“Parent-scientists have tremendous power to productively shape the future of our local communities and public schools.” It’s hard to believe that we actually did it. I want to tell you a story. A story about what is possible at the interface of modern science and public education. This is a story of scientific volunteerism, a story of consensus building in the arena of public policy, and a story of fighting to put public-school teachers and kids first. But it’s also a story about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)—a disorienting crisis that unmoored a group of us from our normal expectations, allowing us to achieve something that we might never have thought possible. Although I and a hundred of my colleagues in Massachusetts are the protagonists in this narrative, it’s really not a story about us. If you are a scientist and have a child in the public schools, this is a story about you. It’s about what parent scientists everywhere are capable of—or could be capable of—when we establish meaningful partnerships with educators and administrators to solve urgent challenges at the intersection of education and science. And what could have felt more urgent this year than bringing kids and teachers back to school safely? I’d like to tell you about the unexpected journey a group of parent scientists took to create a data-driven framework to help achieve this critical goal. Building a grassroots organization over nights and weekends. Establishing a generalizable framework for routine severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) surveillance testing in public schools. Testing tens of thousands of students and teachers every week. Catching asymptomatic cases. Preventing outbreaks by catching cases in real time, thereby reducing fear among teachers and families. And striving to do so equitably across every district in Massachusetts. At face value, it seems unlikely that I would become one of the leading voices calling for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance testing in public schools throughout the state of Massachusetts. After all, my professional expertise is in cancer biology. My laboratory is focused on functional genomics approaches for deciphering cancer targets. However, my firm conviction has always been that my role—and the role of scientists more generally—is to serve society. Perhaps like you, I got into science in the first place to make a difference, to change the world in some fundamental way—by charging into the unknown, working collaboratively, sharing information, and helping to make really hard things, even things that seemed “impossible,” not only possible but straightforward. And not just by publishing an exciting Cell paper, but by using science to actually change the lives of members of our communities for the better. Imagine looking back at the end of your career and realizing that you had done that? So, it follows naturally that I’ve always found a passion at the intersection of science, communication, and education. My wife, Julie, is a gifted science educator who shares this passion. She teaches AP Biology and a biotechnology and personal genetics elective course in the public high school in our community. Seeing the untapped potential of local scientific expertise, she has worked to make it available to teachers, enabling them to teach cutting-edge science to kids. She has built a career working to close this recalcitrant gap between scientists and educators. It’s paradoxical that this gap is so hard to close. After all, amazing scientists and medical professionals live in every state. Many of them are parents of kids right there in the public schools, hungry to support educators as community volunteers. Others are amazing scientific educators, hungry to engage scientists. They’re part of the same circles. They are right there. A high-quality matchmaking function between parent scientists and educators is missing in America. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, that disconnect was visible mainly within discussions involving science curriculum improvement. In 2020, the stakes changed. By early in the summer of 2020, principals and superintendents across the country were scrambling to make sense of the rapidly changing science. What did we know about the virus? What mitigation strategies would really work? How would we ensure a safe return to school in the fall? Fear and uncertainty—especially among teachers like my wife—were running rampant. The magnitude of the challenge was immense. For instance, a quick calculation revealed that every school day roughly 1 out of 90 children and staff would likely present with symptoms (cough, sore throat, etc.) that overlapped with those of COVID-19. How would we know whether these individuals had the disease or something far more benign? And, most critically, could we find the 50% of positive individuals that were asymptomatic carriers of the virus? Could early detection be an additional mitigation strategy that, together with masking and distancing, could help prevent outbreaks? It was a walk on the coast of Maine over the July 4 weekend that led Julie and me to a realization that would fundamentally upend the next nine months of our professional lives. We realized that there was only one path forward: we needed to try to replace this fear with data. We needed to find a way to help public school districts test students for viral infection on an ongoing basis. Like all other on-site employees of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, in Cambridge MA, I was being tested two times per week; this allowed us to safely open laboratories with minimal fear of viral spread. But was it possible to do the same in public schools? Could this really be done? And, most importantly, would it make a difference? By midsummer, my amazing colleagues at the Broad had converted our sequencing facility into one of the nation’s largest COVID-diagnostics centers. The incredible leadership of the entire Broad Genomics Platform team had found a way to process tens of thousands, then hundreds of thousands, and then millions of diagnostic tests for organizations everywhere. The results were outstanding. It seemed scientifically possible to measure the impact of SARS-CoV-2 within any organization, in real time. By late summer, other regional laboratories such as Ginkgo Bioworks and Mirimus Labs were also ramping up their COVID-19 diagnostic capacity. Together, these laboratories stood ready to serve any community that could self-organize and marshal funds in time. But despite the labs’ readiness, the urgency from the schools’ side seemed missing. Principals, superintendents, school nurses, and local boards of health were grappling with so many things. The complexity of reopening schools was immense. Could parent scientists help? On July 3, 2020, Julie and I began our journey. We emailed our local superintendent of schools asking if testing was under consideration and asked for support in mapping out a local strategy. But we knew that sending emails wasn’t going to be enough. First, we would need to clearly articulate the scientific strategy and rationale. Next, we would need to develop a plausible financial strategy for resourcing a pilot. Finally, we would need to carefully articulate an operational strategy, breaking down the vast complexity into manageable pieces that could be tackled one by one. We were not COVID experts, but we knew where to find them: right within our parent community. By July 16, 2020, we had found outstanding parent scientists and parent physician scientists in our community willing to serve. Together with our school district’s superintendent and head nurse, we met late in the evening multiple times over the course of a single week. During the very first discussion in July, our group decided to make equity a core tenet of our work. We decided that the goal of piloting a testing program in one district must be explicitly to develop a general framework for any district in the state or nation to follow. In addition, we wanted to enable every district to use our framework; we didn’t want to simply leave that task to others. But first we had to show proof of concept somewhere. Our community in Wellesley, MA was extremely fortunate in that our low COVID rates (related to the socioeconomic and racial demographics of our community) made it possible to even consider reopening. This privileged position provided a key opportunity to pilot a testing concept which could then help others who, because they were bearing the brunt of the pandemic, were unable to go first. By July 28, 2020, we issued our scientific strategy memo. In it, we recommended that our local board of health and school committee consider launching a pilot viral-testing program as part of a multi-pronged safety strategy. We suggested the program might not just focus on testing symptomatic individuals but also pilot a weekly surveillance infrastructure and attempt to demonstrate proof of concept for a general framework that other districts could follow. For asymptomatic testing, we recommended (1) testing everyone prior to returning to school (“time zero baseline testing”), (2) weekly testing for staff, and (3) weekly longitudinal surveillance for at least one school building, such as the high school. This strategy would provide real-time estimation of risk and empirically document whether safety protocols were working. Most importantly, we pledged that we, as parent scientists, would work hand in hand with our school administration counterparts all the way through the school year. We next mapped financial strategy, convening local parents with relevant expertise in financial services, private fundraising, and educational philanthropy. Over the next few weeks, we worked with parents with business school expertise to fully map an operations strategy. We interviewed vendors; explored legal, consent, and HIPAA-related issues; tapped local volunteer expertise to vet available testing technologies; and considered challenges ranging from staffing, line management, vendor procurement, and space allocation. We finished our financial and operational strategy memos by August 16, 2020. And we found a fantastic volunteer parent program manager to run the pilot program in partnership with our school committee, district administration, and nursing staff. Over a three-day weekend from August 30–September 1, we launched the first phase of our “Safer Teachers, Safer Students SARS-CoV-2 Testing Pilot.” We tested 4,600 students and staff as part of our “Time Zero Baseline” testing. Over 90% of staff and students participated. It was extraordinary. We were able to quarantine the few cases we found and opened our school doors knowing that there were essentially zero cases within our walls. Now, we were well poised for the next challenge. We realized that taking time away from education to test staff and students weekly wasn’t going to work, and we needed a more affordable option. By October 10, we pivoted to a new pooled testing model, one in which students and staff could spit into take-home tubes over the weekend, registering their tubes’ barcodes with a homegrown app that software engineers in our parent community developed. Tubes were sent to a laboratory with the ability to reflex tests down to a diagnostic result in the occurrence of a positive pool. Six months later, we’ve run tens of thousands of tests in our town. We have caught over 50 cases. We enabled our district’s administration to act like scientists, in a data-driven manner: when an outbreak occurred in one school’s office, they were able to close only the affected school while leaving the rest of the schools in the district open. This local success was remarkable both in terms of its pace and in terms of its impact. During this same time period, we discovered that other parent scientists in nearby districts had been organizing around similar discussions and goals; some had also been advocating at the district and state level for school-based testing strategies since the summer. We began discovering each other’s efforts. Momentum started building as we began to talk, coalescing around a key opportunity to work together to address our common goals. However, each of our local efforts turned out to be just the beginning of the story. Together with the other parent scientists, as well as many other volunteers from across the community, our commitment to equity—to fight for all districts in Massachusetts across the full spectrum of socioeconomic and ethnic diversity—was codified in the first 10 minutes of our group’s first conversation. In September 2020, we began working in parallel to assemble a diverse coalition across the state. Initially, six diverse districts came together (Revere, Chelsea, Somerville, Wellesley, Watertown, and Brookline). This diversity was critical: each had made different choices about returning to school, had different geographies (urban, suburban), different infection rates/severe disease health outcomes, and diverse socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic community compositions. The superintendents from all of these districts were fully engaged and driven. We quickly realized that this multi-district COVID testing pilot was the first of its kind in the public school setting, both in the state of Massachusetts and in the nation. We called ourselves the “Safer Teachers, Safer Students (STSS) Testing Collaborative.” We never met in person. Nevertheless, the online meetings of the Collaborative community were warm, engaging, and interactive. The group grew to include a wide diversity of stakeholders within the six districts: parent scientists, doctors, superintendents, school nurses, members of boards of health, and others. The urgency of the moment pushed everyone toward action. We stayed up after our kids went to bed, after our day jobs were done, discussing, debating, and sharing information late into the night on bi-monthly Zoom calls that sometimes went until nearly 11 p.m. Our mission was to assess the feasibility and value of viral testing in the public school setting for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. We believed if this multi-district effort was successful, it would demonstrate how to reduce fear and anxiety about returning to school, help ensure that in-person public school K-12 learning could continue as long as possible, and increase the safety of both teachers and students. Critically, it would ensure that the framework could be generalizable to enable any district in the Commonwealth to follow. We set a unifying and cohesive culture for our group, establishing mission-based principles guiding our work; see Box 1.Box 1Principles for the STSS Testing Collaborative1.We believe access to expedited testing for both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals should be universal, regardless of income, race, ethnicity, geography, or social status.2.We believe that decision-making on the transition states between schooling models should be driven by data on cases and transmission events.3.We believe that testing in the public school setting should be made available at cost, with no profit motive.4.We believe that the best technologies and approaches for testing should be available to public schools earlier than, or at the same time as, for-profit corporations.5.We believe that our educators deserve access to high-quality testing programs equivalent to those available to for-profit corporations.6.We believe that the development of a general framework of best practices for how public-school SARS-CoV-2 testing adds the most value is urgent and is a matter of social justice. 1.We believe access to expedited testing for both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals should be universal, regardless of income, race, ethnicity, geography, or social status.2.We believe that decision-making on the transition states between schooling models should be driven by data on cases and transmission events.3.We believe that testing in the public school setting should be made available at cost, with no profit motive.4.We believe that the best technologies and approaches for testing should be available to public schools earlier than, or at the same time as, for-profit corporations.5.We believe that our educators deserve access to high-quality testing programs equivalent to those available to for-profit corporations.6.We believe that the development of a general framework of best practices for how public-school SARS-CoV-2 testing adds the most value is urgent and is a matter of social justice. These principles began to attract engagement and attention from others. First, testing vendors that shared these principles joined in the discussion and began exploring ways to work together to support schools. They shared information and ideas and pushed each other to lower costs. Second, economists joined in, bringing new perspectives, connections, and ideas. And third, local, state, and national politicians and policy makers engaged. The strength, vision, and diversity of our group provided a strong platform. The momentum grew rapidly. By December, leaders and parent scientists from over 20 additional districts had joined the Collaborative’s semi-weekly group teleconferences to share information and develop consensus strategy together. Our first Zoom call had six people. By December 12, we had nearly 100. Our work was featured on National Public Radio, in local news organizations and media outlets, The Atlantic, and NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt. Financial commitments from foundations came in to fully support the launch of testing programs in two districts who had been hit hardest by COVID-19 (Revere and Chelsea) as soon as they were ready. There were still major challenges, and each district was necessarily carving its own path; we had healthy debates about the merits and drawbacks of different testing approaches and strategies. But we were all working together, through the fog and the complexity. Many had been stumbling, alone in the dark before we found each other in the Collaborative. We all believed in science, in data. And, we believed in teachers and public school kids. They were too important to be left behind. By early 2021, districts within the Collaborative had completed over 100,000 screening tests in public schools and had set up expedited testing access for symptomatic students and staff. We had demonstrated the operational feasibility of weekly surveillance. We had identified and vetted five high-quality vendors ready to serve, with adequate scale for all of Massachusetts. We had created a dashboard and peer-to-peer mentoring service enabling districts to easily help each other (see resource hub links on the Shah Family Foundation’s www.covidedtesting.com website). We clearly demonstrated the public health value of surveillance testing in public schools. We were able to detect and quarantine over 100 asymptomatic cases of COVID-19. This system also enabled the early detection of at least one significant outbreak in a school office, likely preventing it from spreading further. (In addition, it identified a problem with the use of Plexiglas as a mitigation measure: the barriers disrupted office airflow, increasing the opportunity for transmission.) Most critically, surveys in several towns showed that COVID screening significantly reduced fear and anxiety among teachers (for instance in Wellesley, 82% of teachers said they felt safer with testing, as opposed to 12% feeling safe prior). We also began to reduce fear and anxiety among parents. Finally, we demonstrated the strategic value of surveillance testing. We showed how a testing program and the actual collection of data could help productively resolve negotiations between districts and teachers’ unions and enable a return to in-person learning. And we demonstrated how targeted actions could be taken in a data-driven manner. Despite our efforts, equity and access for all remained (and still remains) a tremendous challenge. State and federal action was now needed. On January 8, 2021, almost exactly six months after Julie and I began our journey, we finally reached a key milestone. That day, a state-wide solution for viral screening testing finally became plausible, thanks to the work of multiple organizations throughout Massachusetts, including our Collaborative. On January 8, the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) and the Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS) announced their intent to launch the first state-wide viral screening testing program open to every school in Massachusetts, to be financed through mid-April via state funds. Within two months, over 150 districts had joined in the program, including nearly 1,000 public schools. As this piece comes to press, this pilot program is still playing out across Massachusetts. There is work to do to refine and perfect the detailed operational models, but one thing is clear: science is helping to rescue public schools. Data are starting to replace fear. Schools are reopening with SARS-CoV-2 testing as an added component of COVID mitigation strategy, providing assurance that we won’t backtrack on all the progress that has been made. We know that the rest of the nation is now watching: On March 17, 2021, the Biden Administration announced a $10 billion commitment to K-12 COVID-19 surveillance testing in the United States, including $207 million for Massachusetts. Scientists are truly capable of extraordinary things. We can create and manufacture COVID-19 vaccines in one year, send robotic rovers to Mars, and build particle accelerators to resolve the identities of subatomic species. However, many of us have another extraordinary job: we are parents and caregivers. We care about our kids, the communities that they are growing up in, and the educational systems and societal structures that support them and their development. What I have learned from this COVID-19 testing adventure is that parent scientists have tremendous power to productively shape the future of our local communities and public schools, if we recognize how to wield this power with great care and with a collaborative spirit. We must respect the extraordinary professionalism of educators and school administrators. We must learn productive strategies to galvanize coalitions behind public policy decision-making, and we must recognize that these strategies are different than those required to build consensus among scientists. Are there things I wish we’d done differently? Certainly. Despite many public schools in Massachusetts serving predominantly communities of color, we unfortunately did not engage a diverse enough cross-section of parent scientists in our group. For instance, we failed to engage parents from the African American community. Prioritizing more effort for targeted engagement and outreach could have made an even bigger impact. I believe that our public schools have a tremendous, untapped resource sitting right under their fingertips. It’s us: the parent-scientists who are ready to serve our schools with our expertise. Our role as scientists includes forging productive partnerships with educators and policy makers to solve vexing and urgent challenges facing our communities. Our communities need us to do more than publish Cell papers. If COVID has taught us anything, it’s that.

Pyrococcus furiosus is a hyperthermophilic anaerobic archaeon that grows near marine volcanic vents at temperatures approaching 100 °C (1Fiala G. Stetter K.O.

These cells grow on carbohydrates or peptides and produce acetate, CO2, and either H2 or H2S depending on whether elemental sulfur (S0) is included in the growth medium. The iron concentration in the organism is high; this d-block transition metal plays critical roles in the cell’s metabolism, especially in processes involving redox and energy generation (2Cvetkovic A.

This represents 8.4% of the P. furiosus genome, which is slightly above average for archaea (7.1%) and well above average for bacteria (3.9%) and eukaryotes (1.1%) (4Andreini C. Banci L. Bertini I.

During peptide fermentation, homodimeric aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase (AOR) oxidizes aldehydes derived from amino acids. Each AOR subunit contains an [Fe4S4] cluster. Bridging the subunits of the homodimer is a monomeric Fe ion coordinated by His and Glu residues (6Mukund S. Adams M.W.W. The novel tungsten-iron-sulfur protein of the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium, Pyrococcus furiosus, is an aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase.

Formaldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase, pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase, 2-ketoisovalerate ferredoxin oxidoreductase, 2-ketoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductase, and indolepyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase are all [Fe4S4] cluster-containing enzymes that catalyze catabolic processes. The latter enzymes catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of 2-keto acids derived from peptides (8Ozawa Y. Nakamura T. Kamata N. Yasujima D. Urushiyama A. Yamakura F. Ohmori D. Imai T.

Electrons from these catabolic metalloenzymes reduce a monomeric ferredoxin that houses a single [Fe4S4]2+/1+ cluster (E0’ ∼ −480 mV versus NHE) coordinated by three Cys and one Asp residues. Carbohydrate fermentation involves a modified Embden-Meyerhof pathway that is independent of NAD. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ferredoxin oxidoreductase, another [Fe4S4]-containing enzyme, oxidizes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to glycerate-3-phosphate, and transfers the electrons obtained to the ferredoxin. Ferredoxin not only receives electrons but it donates them as part of energy generation in the cell; thus, it serves as the electron currency for the cell. An evolutionarily ancient membrane-bound respiratory hydrogenase (MBH) is used to oxidize ferredoxin (11Yu H.J. Wu C.-H. Schut G.J. Haja D.K. Zhao G.P. Peters J.W. Adams M.W.W. Li H.L. Structure of an ancient respiratory system.Cell. 2018; 173: 1636-1649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This contains at least three [Fe4S4] clusters and a NiFe active-site cluster. Ferredoxin donates electrons to MBH which transfers them, in turn, to protons (E0’ = −420 mV at pH 7), forming H2 as the product. This thermodynamically favorable redox process pumps H+ ions across the membrane, which are then exchanged with Na+ ions. This creates a concentration gradient that is used by a Na+-dependent ATP synthase to generate ATP via chemiosmosis. Ferredoxin also donates electrons to NADH-dependent reduced ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase 1 which reduces NADP+ in an electron bifurcation reaction that generates low-potential electrons which can be used in metabolic processes requiring low potentials. Carbohydrate fermentation can occur with or without S0, whereas cells grown on peptides require S0 as there is little growth when it is omitted from the growth medium (12Adams M.W.W. Holden J.F. Menon A.L. Schut G.J. Grunden A.M. Hou C. Hutchins A.M. Jenney F.E. Kim C. Ma K.S. Pan G.L. Roy R. Sapra R. Story S.V. Verhagen M.F.J.M. Key role for sulfur in peptide metabolism and in regulation of three hydrogenases in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus.J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The metabolism of P. furiosus changes significantly when elemental sulfur (S0) is included in the growth medium (13Schut G.J. Bridger S.L. Adams M.W.W. Insights into the metabolism of elemental sulfur by the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus: Characterization of a coenzyme A-dependent NAD(P)H sulfur oxidoreductase.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4431-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Under +S0 conditions, P. furiosus shuts-down expression of MBH and of the two NAD(P)-reducing soluble hydrogenases termed SHI and SHII (among other proteins) and upregulates expression of a membrane-bound sulfane reductase (MBS) (Tables S3 and S4, (14Schut G.J. Brehm S.D. Datta S. Adams M.W.W. Whole-genome DNA microarray analysis of a hyperthermophile and an archaeon: Pyrococcus furiosus grown on carbohydrates or peptides.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3935-3947Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)). Doing so suppresses production of H2 and stimulates H2S production. MBS uses electrons from ferredoxin to reduce sulfane sulfurs of polysulfides (E0’ = −260 mV), generating smaller polysulfide units as illustrated by the following sample reaction. MBS cleaves organic and anionic polysulfides but not to the level of H2S, which is formed spontaneously from smaller polysulfides (Sn2− where n ≤ 4). Like MBH, MBS creates a Na+ ion gradient which is subsequently used, via chemiosmosis, for ATP synthesis. MBS is a homolog of MBH and also contains three [Fe4S4] clusters. Unlike MBH, it does not contain a NiFe active site (15Wu C.-H. Schut G.J. Poole F.L. Haja D.K. Adams M.W.W.

Keese A.M. Cowart D.M. Schut G.J. Thomm M. Adams M.W.W. Scott R.A. SurR: A transcriptional activator and repressor controlling hydrogen and elemental sulphur metabolism in Pyrococcus furiosus.Mol.

SurR is a master regulator of the primary electron flow pathways in the order Thermococcales.Mol. Microbiol. 2017; 104: 869-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Under +S0 conditions, SurR upregulates iron transport and iron sulfur cluster (ISC) biosynthesis genes. P. furiosus grows better with S° than without it; in fact, the maximal yield (cell mass produced per mole of carbohydrate used) is nearly double that obtained under -S0 conditions. This implies that more energy can be generated by coupling ferredoxin oxidation to S° reduction than by coupling it to proton reduction, a conclusion substantiated by the finding that MBS contains an additional ion pump compared with MBH (15Wu C.-H. Schut G.J. Poole F.L. Haja D.K. Adams M.W.W. Characterization of membrane-bound sulfane reductase: A missing link in the evolution of modern day respiratory complexes.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 16687-16696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Despite being an anaerobe, P. furiosus houses iron-containing proteins that protect it against damage because of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Superoxide reductase catalyzes the reduction of superoxide to H2O2 at an active site containing a single FeII ion. The electrons required for this come from rubredoxin, a protein that houses a mononuclear redox-active FeII/FeIII ion coordinated by four cysteine residues in a tetrahedral geometry – an FeII/III(S)4 site (18Jenney F.E. Adams M.W.W. Rubredoxin from Pyrococcus furiosus in hyperthermophilic enzymes Pt. C.Methods Enzymol. 2001; 334: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Rubrerythrin catalyzes the reduction of H2O2 to water, also using electrons from rubredoxin. It contains an [Fe-O-Fe] center as well as an FeII/III(S)4 site (19Weinberg M.V. Jenney Jr., F.E. Cui X.

Ferritin stores thousands of ferric ions within the core of a 24-subunit protein complex as an insoluble FeIII ferrihydrite-type aggregate. The DPS-like protein has a ferroxidase active site ([Fe-O-Fe]) which exhibits peroxidase activity in the presence of H2O2. This protein coordinates hundreds of iron ions, obtained from the H2O2-dependent oxidation of FeII (20Strand K.R. Sun C.J. Jenney F.E. Schut G.J. Adams M.W.W.

Another protein that binds a large amount of iron is IssA. The exact function of the IssA protein is unknown but its expression increases dramatically when cells are grown in +S0 media, but only when iron is present (>7.4 μM) (22Clarkson S.M. Newcomer E.C.

Using TEM, they detected iron-dense particles 20 to 300 nm in diameter in +S0 P. furiosus cells (23Vaccaro B.J. Clarkson S.M. Holden J.F. Lee D.W. Wu C.H. Poole F.L. Cotelesage J.J.H. Hackett M.J.

Commun. 2017; 8: 16110Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). X-ray absorption spectra of the particles indicate a linear polymeric (FeS2−)n structure as in thioferrates; this includes four Fe-S interactions at 2.24 Å, two Fe-Fe interactions at 2.70 Å, and a long-range Fe-Fe interaction at 5.4 Å. The particles exhibit a broad isotropic electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal at g = 2.2 that displays anti-Curie Law behavior, also consistent with thioferrates. The EPR signal is observed only above 60 K, similar to the behavior of synthetic thioferrates. Moreover, the iron and sulfur from IssA-associated particles assemble into [Fe4S4] clusters. Such clusters can transfer to apo-ferredoxin (in the presence of DTT), indicating that these thioferrate particles can be used in ISC assembly. Purified IssA monomers reportedly contain 38 Fe and 38 S atoms. A 20 nm diameter 3.5 MDa thioferrate structure is calculated to contain ∼6400 Fe atoms and ∼170 IssA monomers. IssA contains only one cysteine per monomer raising issues as to how it coordinates such structures. In this study, we have used primarily Mössbauer (MB) spectroscopy to analyze the iron content of 57Fe-enriched WT and ΔIssA whole P. furiosus cells grown on the disaccharide maltose in the presence (+S0) and absence (-S0) of elemental sulfur. All 57Fe ions in a sample are detectable by MB spectroscopy, with intensities that are roughly invariant per iron in the sample, regardless of the type of iron center. Thus, MB can be used to evaluate the ironome of these cells, albeit in semiquantitative terms and only with “coarse-grain” resolution. Using this approach, we have previously evaluated the ironome of Escherichia coli (24Wofford J.D. Bolaji N. Dziuba N. Outten F.A. Lindahl P.A.

This is the first MB study of an archaeon, in this case one that is hyperthermophilic and strictly anaerobic. We began by collecting low-temperature low-field MB spectra of whole WT cells harvested while growing exponentially on maltose with 10 μM 57Fe and without S0 in the medium. The 5 K 0.05 T MB spectrum was dominated by a broad quadrupole doublet representing ca. 85% of the overall intensity (Fig. 1A). The structured lineshape of the doublet prompted us to decompose it into two partially resolved sharper doublets, each with isomer shifts δ typical of oxidized S = 0 [Fe4S4]2+ clusters (Table 1). The doublets were simulated by the gold and brown solid lines of Figure 1. The quadrupole splitting ΔEQ associated with the gold doublet was wider than that of the brown doublet, and so we labeled them wide and narrow ISC doublets (ISCW and ISCN). Each doublet represented 35% to 45% of spectral intensity; the exact percentage due to each was difficult to assess because they were not well resolved. Considering that the spectrum represented all irons in the cell, including at least 15 different [Fe4S4]-containing proteins (Table S2), the ability to decompose all [Fe4S4] clusters into two doublets, each with relatively sharp linewidths, was remarkable. One extreme explanation was that two of the 15 [Fe4S4]-containing proteins in the cell dominated the iron content of the cell, with each protein corresponding to the two doublets. At the other extreme, each [Fe4S4]-containing proteins in the cell might have contributed equally to the spectrum but, for some unknown reason, segregated cleanly into these two spectral groups. Neither extreme seems likely but they illustrate the remarkability of the result.Table 1Mössbauer parameters used in simulations (averaged), LT (low temperature), and HT (high temperature)ParameterISCWISCNMagneticFeII(S4)FeII(O/N)S = 5/2 FeIIIδ (mm/s)0.45 ± 0.04 (LT)0.43 ± 0.03 (LT)0.65 ± 0.041.3 ± 0.1 (LT)0.50 ± 0.020.43 ± 0.03 (HT)0.38 ± 0.05 (HT)1.2 ± 0.1 (HT)ΔEQ (mm/s)1.35 ± 0.05 (LT)0.83 ± 0.06 (LT)3.0 ± 0.052.6 ± 0.1 (LT)0.45 ± 0.021.15 ± 0.1 (HT)0.75 ± 0.07 (HT)2.7 ± 0.1 (HT)Γ (mm/s)0.34 ± 0.06 (LT)0.47 ± 0.04 (LT)0.43 ± 0.030.5 ± 0.1 (LT)0.50 ± 0.050.35 ± 0.05 (HT)0.45 ± 0.04 (HT)0.5 ± 0.1 (HT)D; E/D0.5; 0.33Ax; Ay; Az–29.08 MHzη2.5 ± 0.5gx, gy, gz2.0Figure 145% (LT)35% (LT)∼14-15% (LT) (other)4–5% (LT)35% (HT)60% (HT)4–5% (HT)43% (Post storage)33% (Post storage)8% (Post storage)16% (Post storage)Figure 310% (LT)10% (LT)78% (LT) (S°-dependent)2% (LT)33% (HT)65% (HT)2% (HT)Figure 6+S°10% (LT)10% (LT)77% (LT) (S°-dependent)3% (LT)35% (LT)63% (HT)3% (LT)-S°52% (LT)23% (LT)2% (LT)23% (LT)42% (HT)33% (HT)2% (HT)23% (HT)Figure 749% (5 K)36% (5 K)3% (LT)12% (5 K)44% (150 K)41% (150 K)3% (HT)12% (150 K) Open table in a new tab Also remarkable was that δ and ΔEQ for the two doublets were strongly temperature-dependent. At 150 K (Fig. 1B), ΔEQ and δ for both doublets declined (Table 1), but their linewidths did not increase. The temperature dependence of δ is mostly related to the second-order Doppler effect (27Gütlich P. Bill E. Trautwein A.X. Mössbauer Spectroscopy and Transition Metal Chemistry: Fundamentals and Applications. Springer Verlag, Berlin and Heidelberg, Germany2011Crossref Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The temperature-dependence of ΔEQ is generally attributed to changes in the covalency of metal-ligand bonds. This can bring the separation between t2g and eg atomic orbitals close enough together that orbital populations can be affected by temperature, changing ΔEQ. Continuing with the extreme explanations offered above, this result would mean either that both dominant [Fe4S4] proteins exhibited this behavior or that all 15 contributing [Fe4S4] proteins did so. This raises an intriguing speculation that [Fe4S4]2+ clusters in hyperthermophilic organisms might generally possess low-lying excited states. We wanted to determine whether these doublets arose from diamagnetic iron centers, as would be the case if they arose from [Fe4S4]2+ clusters. Spectra were collected at 4.2 K and 0, 3, and 6 T applied magnetic fields (Fig. 1, C–E). The solid red lines overlaying the data were simulations that assumed diamagnetism and the δ and ΔEQ values in Table 1. The reasonable fits demonstrated that the ISCW/N doublets indeed arose from S = 0 [Fe4S4]2+ clusters. This conclusion was reinforced by the large number of [Fe4S4]-containing proteins in these cell (Table S2). These spectra also show that virtually all redox-active [Fe4S4] clusters in exponentially growing WT-S0 cells are in the oxidized 2+ core state. [Fe4S4]2+/1+ clusters typically have reduction potentials of ca. −400 mV versus NHE, suggesting (by considering the Nernst equation) a cellular potential >ca. −340 mV. After MB spectra were collected, the sample was thawed, and after EPR analysis (see below), the metal content was determined (Table S5). We assumed that 70% of the sample volume in the packed MB cup was due to the cells themselves and that the density of the sample was 1.00 g/ml. With these assumptions, we calculated that the sample contained 1.03 mM iron. If two [Fe4S4]-containing proteins dominated this group, their cellular protein concentrations would be ∼120 μM each. On the other hand, if all 15 [Fe4S4] proteins contributed equally, their the average cellular concentration would be ∼17 μM, which seems more likely. WT-S0 cells exhibited broad unresolved intensity barely distinguishable from the baseline between ca. −5 and +6 mm/s (Fig. 1A, arrows). This feature represented roughly 15% of the overall intensity and appeared to arise from a paramagnetic iron center. We overlaid the S0-dependent thioferrate-like (TFL) magnetic material described below onto it, but the mismatch suggested a different type of magnetic iron (called “other magnetic iron” in Table 1). By 150 K, the associated magnetic hyperfine interactions collapsed completely into the spectral region occupied by the ISCW/N doublets (Fig. 1B). Importantly, we are not concluding that the absorption necessarily collapsed into the ISCW/N doublets at high temperature, only that it occupied/overlapped the same spectral region; more on this distinction below. A small amount of a high-spin FeII doublet (∼5%) was also evident in the 150 K spectrum of WT-S0 cells (Fig. 1B, double arrow). A similar doublet was probably present in the 5 K spectrum (Fig. 1A), but it could not be distinguished from the “other magnetic” iron. The parameters associated with this doublet are typical of mononuclear and binuclear FeII sites in proteins with 5 to 6 O/N donor atoms (Table S2), as well as any low-molecular-mass FeII species with a similar ligand environment. There are few if any sulfur donors in the FeII(O/N)5–6 sites. Given the overall iron concentration in the cell, this doublet represented ∼50 μM FeII(O/N)5–6 total in P. furiosus cells. The 4.2 K 0 T spectrum of WT-S0 cells in Figure 1C exhibited two minor features. One was a line at ∼2.6 mm/s which reflected an FeII(O/N)5–6 doublet. This doublet was simulated by the blue solid line above the spectrum at 15% intensity. The broad nonsymmetrical shape of the high-energy line suggested at least two FeII(O/N)5–6 sites. The second minor feature, simulated by the solid green line, was a pattern barely distinguishable from the baseline that suggested a high-spin FeIII species. The putative S = 5/2 species was most evident at 6 T (Fig. 1E) where it represented ∼15% of overall spectral intensity. The EPR spectrum of the sample (after thawing the MB sample and transferring it to an EPR tube) exhibited a signal at g = 4.3 which probably originated from the same species (Fig. 2, bottom). It also exhibited an isotropic signal at g = 2.00 but little intensity at g = 1.94 which is consistent with MB spectra showing that the [Fe4S4] clusters in the cell were primarily in the diamagnetic 2+ core oxidation state. The most surprising aspect of the Figure 1C spectrum was that the sample used to generate it was identical to that of Figure 1, A and B—only that it had been stored without thawing in a liquid N2 dewar for ∼3 months. Because the ISCW/N doublets were unaffected, iron species other that the clusters affording the ISCW/N doublets (perhaps the “other magnetic” iron) must have reacted slowly in frozen cells to generate the observed high-spin FeII and FeIII spectral features in Figure 1, C–E. The S = 5/2 FeIII feature is probably an artefact as we have not observed similar features in other spectra. In contrast, FeII(O/N)5–6 features were often observed under various conditions, and thus are likely physiologically relevant. Another batch of P. furiosus cells was grown in the same medium except under +S0 conditions. They were also harvested while growing exponentially. The low-temperature low-field MB spectrum of the WT+S0 cells (Fig. 3A) was dominated by broad absorption that extended from ca. −6 mm/s to +7 mm/s velocity. Given previous studies showing large quantities of TFL material in +S0 cells, we assigned it to this material. Consistent with that assignment, the EPR spectrum of cells in this state lacked a significant g = 4.3 signal (Fig. 2, top spectrum), indicating the absence of magnetically isolated high-spin S = 5/2 FeIII paramagnetic material in the sample. The spectrum exhibited two strong absorption lines in the same region of the ISCW/N doublets in WT-S0 spectra, and this unfortunately created ambiguity for our analysis. It implies that some proportion of the intensity of these two lines arose from the ISCW/N doublets, whereas the remainder was associated with the TFL material. Based on our simulations and analyses, we estimate that at least 10%, and no more than 25% of the spectral intensity arose from the ISCW/N doublets in WT+S0 spectra. The relative intensity of the two contributions was kept constant in the 3.0 and 6.0 T spectra (Fig. 3, C and D) with 20% of the intensity attributed to the ISCW/N doublets in the 6.0 T spectrum. The solid green lines in Figure 3, A, C, and D simulated the ISCW/N doublets at the 20% intensity level. Magnetic hyperfine interactions associated with the TFL material were absent in the WT+S0 spectrum at 150 K (Fig. 3B), and the intensity associated with this material collapsed into the same region that was occupied by the ISCW/N doublets in WT-S0 spectra. The intensity of the ISCW doublet increased from ∼10% at 5 K to 33% at 150 K. The intensity of ISCN increased from ∼10% at 5 K to 65% at 150 K. Thus, 30% of the TFL material collapsed over the ISCW doublet while 70% collapsed over the ISCN doublet. None of the TFL material collapsed into features characteristic of FeII ions. The 150 K MB spectrum of the WT+S0 sample did exhibit a minor broad FeII(O/N)5–6"
https://openalex.org/W3159893891,"Proper dendrite morphogenesis and synapse formation are essential for neuronal development and function. Dasm1, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is known to promote dendrite outgrowth and excitatory synapse maturation in vitro. However, the in vivo function of Dasm1 in neuronal development and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. To learn more, Dasm1 knockout mice were constructed and employed to confirm that Dasm1 regulates dendrite arborization and spine formation in vivo. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using Dasm1, revealing MRCKβ as a putative partner; additional lines of evidence confirmed this interaction and identified cytoplasmic proline-rich region (823-947 aa) of Dasm1 and MRCKβ self-activated kinase domain (CC1, 410-744 aa) as necessary and sufficient for binding. Using co-immunoprecipitation assay, autophosphorylation assay, and BS3 cross-linking assay, we show that Dasm1 binding triggers a change in MRCKβ's conformation and subsequent dimerization, resulting in autophosphorylation and activation. Activated MRCKβ in turn phosphorylates a class 2 regulatory myosin light chain, which leads to enhanced actin rearrangement, causing the dendrite outgrowth and spine formation observed before. Removal of Dasm1 in mice leads to behavioral abnormalities. Together, these results reveal a crucial molecular pathway mediating cell surface and intracellular signaling communication to regulate actin dynamics and neuronal development in the mammalian brain."

The present study, guided by theory of planned behavior, aimed at describing the magnitude of mobile use while driving and examining the role of attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and risk perceptions in predicting drivers' intentions to use mobile phone while driving. A total of 155 public service vehicle drivers, who were selected from Debre Markos Town and its vehicle terminal took part in the study. To select study participants, systematic random sampling technique was employed. The instrument used to collect data was self-report questionnaire. The results indicated that more than two-third (69%) of the participants used their mobile phone while driving over the past week. Hierarchical regression analysis displayed that perceived behavioral control, risk perception, and attitude were found to be the most significant social and cognitive predictors of public service vehicle drivers' intention to use mobile phone while driving, but not age and subjective norm variables. So as to reduce drivers' intention to use mobile phone while driving, intervention strategies should focus on enhancing their confidence to avoid this behavior; alerting drivers to the traffic control regulation and the dangers of using mobile phones while driving."

https://openalex.org/W3158932872,"Background Clinical-diffusion mismatch between stroke severity and diffusion-weighted imaging lesion volume seems to identify stroke patients with penumbra. However, urgent magnetic resonance imaging is sometimes inaccessible or contraindicated. Thus, we hypothesized that using brain computed tomography (CT) to determine a baseline “clinical-CT mismatch” may also predict the responses to thrombolytic therapy. Methods Brain CT lesions were measured using the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS). A total of 104 patients were included: 79 patients with a baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score ≥ 8 and a CT-ASPECTS ≥ 9 who were defined as clinical-CT mismatch-positive (P group) and 25 patients with an NIHSS score ≥ 8 and a CT-ASPECTS &lt; 9 who were defined as clinical-CT mismatch-negative (the N group). We compared their clinical outcomes, including early neurological improvement (ENI), early neurological deterioration (END), delta NIHSS score (admission NIHSS—baseline NIHSS score), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), mortality, and favorable outcome at 3 months. Results Patients in the P group had a greater proportion of favorable outcome at 3 months (p = 0.032) and more frequent ENI (p = 0.038) and a greater delta NIHSS score (p = 0.001), as well as a lower proportion of END (p = 0.004) than those in the N group patients. There were no significant differences in the incidence rates of sICH and mortality between the two groups. Conclusions Clinical-CT mismatch may be able to predict which patients would benefit from intravenous thrombolysis."
https://openalex.org/W3157653423,"Concurrent body movements have been shown to enhance the accuracy of spatial judgment, but it remains unclear whether they also contribute to perceptual estimates of gravitational space not involving body movements. To address this, we evaluated the effects of static or dynamic arm movements during prolonged whole-body tilt on the subsequent perceptual estimates of visual or postural vertical. In Experiment 1, participants were asked to continuously perform static or dynamic arm movements during prolonged tilt, and we assessed their effects on the prolonged tilt-induced shifts of subjective visual vertical (SVV) at a tilted position (during-tilt session) or near upright (post-tilt session). In Experiment 2, we evaluated how static or dynamic arm movements during prolonged tilt subsequently affected the subjective postural vertical (SPV). In Experiment 1, we observed that the SVV was significantly shifted toward the direction of prolonged tilt in both sessions. The SVV shifts decreased when performing dynamic arm movements in the during-tilt session, but not in the post-tilt session. In Experiment 2, as well as SVV, the SPV was shifted toward the direction of prolonged tilt, but it was not significantly attenuated by the performance of static or dynamic arm movements. The results of the during-tilt session suggest that the central nervous system utilizes additional information generated by dynamic body movements for perceptual estimates of visual vertical."

Cho et al. now identify two separate functions for JDPs in the process, in the initial capture of the TA and the transfer into the GET pathway. These data suggest that several Hsp70 cycles could be involved at distinct steps during protein maturation. Molecular chaperones assist protein folding in the cell, with heat shock 70 kDa protein (Hsp70) and Hsp90 being the most abundant and conserved chaperone families (1Saibil H. Chaperone machines for protein folding, unfolding and disaggregation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 630-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In general, chaperones bind to folding intermediates to prepare them for further maturation, such as folding into the native state or sorting into the right pathway. Their activity is controlled by an ATP cycle, which is regulated by cochaperones. In the case of the Hsp70 family, this cycle is assisted by two types of cochaperones: JDPs that promote substrate entry into the Hsp70 binding cleft by stimulating ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange factors that promote ADP release and subsequent ATP rebinding, allowing substrate leaving the cleft (1Saibil H. Chaperone machines for protein folding, unfolding and disaggregation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 630-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). When the substrate is released from Hsp70, cochaperones can channel it into one of several downstream pathways, such as folding, proteasomal degradation, or targeting to the membrane (Fig. 1). One class of substrates, the TAs—integral membrane proteins containing a C-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane domain (TMD) —are known to be channeled into the GET secretory pathway (2Hegde R.S.

While passaging through the cytosol, Hsp70 keeps the TMD soluble, preventing misfolding and aggregation, and also, it targets the TAs to the appropriate membrane.

However, whether JDPs perform this role in TA targeting, how the multiple cellular JDPs are partitioned into this versus other processes, and whether the JDPs assist with other functions remain unclear. Publishing in JBC, Cho et al. (6Cho H. Shim W.J. Liu Y. Shan S.O. J-domain proteins promote client relay from Hsp70 during tail-anchored membrane protein targeting.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) propose a model for the Hsp70/JDP-mediated transport of TAs into the GET pathway in which Ydj1 and Sis1, the two most abundant yeast JDPs, contribute to regulating the conformation of Hsp70-bound TAs during membrane protein biogenesis. Cho et al. started their investigation by asking whether Ydj1 and Sis1 enhance the ability of Ssa1 to capture TAs and keep them in the soluble form. They used a hybrid protein containing Bos1, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae membrane protein strongly dependent on the GET pathway, as their TA model. Cho et al. specifically mutated Ydj1 in its J-domain to abolish Hsp70 ATPase activation and created a Ydj1 fragment with a truncated substrate-binding domain (JD-GF). Subsequently, they monitored the ability of Ssa1 to maintain Bos1 solubility using turbidity and sedimentation assays. These experiments revealed that ATPase activation mediated by a functional J-domain is required for TA binding by Ssa1. Assays with Sis1 showed it does not prevent Bos1 aggregation, meaning that this cochaperone is not able to target Bos1. Would its inability to capture Bos1 now prevent Sis1 from playing a role in targeting this TA protein to the membrane? The authors next tested both Ydj1 and Sis1 for their ability to stimulate TA transfer from Ssa1 to Sgt2. Monitoring Bos1 transfer from Ssa1 to Sgt2 via a photocrosslinker integrated into the Bos1 TMD revealed, unexpectedly, that both Ydj1 and Sis1 enhance substrate transfer. Consistently, also genetic experiments revealed that both JDPs can substitute each other to promote TA membrane insertion. Thus, despite the inability of Sis1 to synergize with Ssa1 during TA capture, it can enhance Ssa1-to-Sgt2 TA transfer. To identify the functional elements in this step, the authors mutated both JDPs in the ATP-stimulating motif in the J-domain and partially deleted the substrate-binding domains. Monitoring TA transfer by crosslinking revealed that the functional J-domain is crucial, and differences between the Ydj1 and Sis1 substrate-binding domains did not have an impact. These data suggest that the ability of the JDPs to enhance TA transfer depends on stimulation of Hsp70 ATPase activity by functional J-domains. To pilot TA proteins into the GET stream, Hsp70s must capture and then transfer substrates to Sgt2. The data from Cho et al. demonstrate that both of these steps are stimulated by JDPs. However, as Sis1 can stimulate only the second but not the first event, this means that there are two independent steps involving ATP hydrolysis by Hsp70 and thus at least two Hsp70 ATP cycles required before the Hsp70 reaches the GET pathway (Fig. 1). If the first ATP cycle is dedicated to capturing the aggregation-prone and highly hydrophobic TMD, the second cycle may serve a different purpose. The authors conclude that the second ATP hydrolysis induces Ssa1 to bind the substrate in a conformation more conducive to transfer. We suggest that these findings may even be taken one step further. Hsp70 ATP hydrolysis is coupled to substrate-binding events, and analysis of the N-terminal domain preceding the Bos1 TMD reveals six potential stretches that could serve as Hsp70-binding sites (7Rüdiger S.

Substrate specificity of the DnaK chaperone determined by screening cellulose-bound peptide libraries.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Thus, a second Hsp70 may bind the substrate, either adding another flag recruiting Sgt2 or potentially further unfolding this domain to possibly increase affinity for Sgt2. Such an unfolding-related mechanism is consistent with earlier findings of bacterial Hsp70, DnaK, rebinding to potential multiple binding sites in luciferase (8Morán Luengo T. Kityk R. Mayer M.P.

This Hsp70 double act beautifully illustrates the necessary versatility of the JDP proteins. The Hsp70 captain knows how to power the boat, but the JDP pilots ensure the vessel navigates to the right target, and this may involve more than one JDP, as in metazoan disaggregation (10Nillegoda N.B. Kirstein J. Szlachcic A. Berynskyy M. Stank A. Stengel F. Arnsburg K. Gao X. Scior A. Aebersold R. Guilbride D.L. Wade R.C. Morimoto R.I. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Crucial HSP70 co-chaperone complex unlocks metazoan protein disaggregation.Nature. 2015; 524: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The beauty of the GET entry process is that it shows that Hsp70 binding has different functions, even for the same substrate protein. It will now be exciting to investigate the differences in what happens at molecular level to the Hsp70 substrate in the two different cycles. The double JDP piloting explored by Cho et al. may offer an experimental route to this important question.
