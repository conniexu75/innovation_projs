https://openalex.org/W3211562608,"There is increasing interest in the potential contribution of the gut microbiome to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, previous studies have been underpowered and have not been designed to address potential confounding factors in a comprehensive way. We performed a large autism stool metagenomics study (n = 247) based on participants from the Australian Autism Biobank and the Queensland Twin Adolescent Brain project. We found negligible direct associations between ASD diagnosis and the gut microbiome. Instead, our data support a model whereby ASD-related restricted interests are associated with less-diverse diet, and in turn reduced microbial taxonomic diversity and looser stool consistency. In contrast to ASD diagnosis, our dataset was well powered to detect microbiome associations with traits such as age, dietary intake, and stool consistency. Overall, microbiome differences in ASD may reflect dietary preferences that relate to diagnostic features, and we caution against claims that the microbiome has a driving role in ASD."

This rich resource provides a foundation for the analysis of gene regulatory programs in human cell types across tissues, life stages, and organ systems. The human body is comprised of various organs, tissues, and cell types, each with highly specialized functions. The genes expressed in each tissue and cell type—and in turn their physiologic roles in the body—are regulated by cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters (Carter and Zhao, 2021Carter B. Zhao K. The epigenetic basis of cellular heterogeneity.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2021; 22: 235-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). These sequences dictate the expression patterns of target genes by recruiting sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) in a cell-type-specific manner (Shlyueva et al., 2014Shlyueva D. Stampfel G. Stark A. Transcriptional enhancers: from properties to genome-wide predictions.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2014; 15: 272-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Upon binding of TFs, cis-regulatory elements frequently adopt conformational changes such that they are more accessible to endonucleases or transposases, enabling genome-wide discovery of candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) by combining assays incorporating these enzymes with high throughput sequencing (Buenrostro et al., 2013Buenrostro J.D.

This limitation has hampered our ability to study gene regulatory programs in distinct human cell types and to interpret the noncoding DNA in the human genome. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of thousands of genetic variants associated with a broad spectrum of human traits and diseases. The large majority of these variants are noncoding (Claussnitzer et al., 2020Claussnitzer M. Cho J.H. Collins R. Cox N.J. Dermitzakis E.T. Hurles M.E. Kathiresan S. Kenny E.E. Lindgren C.M. MacArthur D.G. et al.A brief history of human disease genetics.Nature. 2020; 577: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Observations that annotated cis-regulatory elements in disease-relevant tissues and cell types are enriched for noncoding disease risk variants (Ernst et al., 2011Ernst J. Kheradpour P.

However, annotation of these noncoding risk variants has been hindered by a lack of cell-type-resolved maps of regulatory elements in the human genome. Although previous approaches to distinguish causal variants from local variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD) using fine mapping (Wakefield, 2009Wakefield J. Bayes factors for genome-wide association studies: comparison with P-values.Genet. Epidemiol. 2009; 33: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and to link variants to target genes using co-accessibility of open chromatin regions in single-cells (Pliner et al., 2018Pliner H.A.

Single-cell omics technologies, enabled by droplet-based, combinatorial barcoding or other approaches, have now enabled the profiling of transcriptome, epigenome, and chromatin organization from complex tissues at single-cell resolution (Grosselin et al., 2019Grosselin K.

The resulting data can be used to deconvolute cell types from mixed cell populations and to dissect cell-type-specific transcriptomic and epigenomic states in primary tissues.

In the present study, we used a modified sci-ATAC-seq protocol optimized for flash frozen primary tissues (Hocker et al., 2021Hocker J.D. Poirion O.B. Zhu F. Buchanan J. Zhang K. Chiou J. Wang T.-M.

Neurosci. 2018; 21: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) to profile chromatin accessibility in 30 adult human tissue types from multiple donors. We profiled 615,998 nuclei from these tissues, grouped them into 111 distinct cell types based on similarity in chromatin landscapes, and identified a union of 890,130 open chromatin regions corresponding to cCREs from the resulting maps. We next integrated these data with a recent fetal cell atlas of chromatin accessibility (Domcke et al., 2020Domcke S. Hill A.J. Daza R.M. Cao J. O’Day D.R. Pliner H.A. Aldinger K.A. Pokholok D. Zhang F. Milbank J.H. et al.A human cell atlas of fetal chromatin accessibility.Science. 2020; 370: eaba7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) to reveal open chromatin profiles for >1.3 million cells across the human lifespan and chromatin accessibility maps at 1,154,611 cCREs covering 14.8% of the genome for 222 cell types. Finally, we used this cCRE atlas to interpret cell types and target genes for noncoding variants associated with 240 complex human traits and diseases, reveal cell-type-disease associations, and suggest relevant therapeutic targets in human cell types. We created an interactive web atlas to disseminate this resource (cis-element ATLAS [CATLAS]; http://catlas.org/humanenhancer). To generate a cell atlas of cCREs in the adult human body, we performed sci-ATAC-seq (Cusanovich et al., 2015Cusanovich D.A. Daza R. Adey A. Pliner H.A. Christiansen L. Gunderson K.L. Steemers F.J. Trapnell C. Shendure J.

Neurosci. 2018; 21: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) with primary tissue samples collected from 30 distinct anatomic sites in postmortem adult human donors (Figure 1A; Table S1). Tissue samples were chosen to survey a breadth of human organ systems which differed in their nuclear compositions and sensitivities to mechanical dissociation, posing a technical challenge. We thus optimized nuclear isolation methods and buffer conditions for different tissue types (Table S1; STAR Methods). Subsequently, we generated sci-ATAC-seq datasets using a semi-automated workflow (Hocker et al., 2021Hocker J.D. Poirion O.B. Zhu F. Buchanan J. Zhang K. Chiou J. Wang T.-M. Zhang Q. Hou X. Li Y.E. et al.Cardiac Cell Type-Specific Gene Regulatory Programs and Disease Risk Association.Sci Adv. 2021; 7 (eabf1444)Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar; Preissl et al., 2018Preissl S.

Neurosci. 2018; 21: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and sequenced resulting libraries to 6,464 raw sequence reads per nucleus on average, with a median read duplication rate of 44.88% (Table S2). After filtering out lower quality nuclei and potential doublets, we finally obtained high quality open chromatin profiles for 615,998 nuclei, with a median of 2,822 unique open chromatin fragments per nucleus and an average transcription start site (TSS) enrichment score of 12.8 (±3.2) per nucleus (Figure 1B; Table S2; Data S1; STAR Methods). Analyzing large single-cell chromatin accessibility datasets has been challenging. In the latest development of SnapATAC (Fang et al., 2021Fang R. Preissl S. Li Y. Hou X. Lucero J. Wang X. Motamedi A. Shiau A.K. Zhou X. Xie F. et al.Comprehensive analysis of single cell ATAC-seq data with SnapATAC.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we further improved its scalability to handle millions of cells. Using this algorithm, we first identified 30 major cell groups (Figure 1B), 22 (73%) of which were found to consist of multiple subclusters during a second round of clustering analysis (Methods S1; STAR Methods). Altogether, we uncovered a total of 111 distinct cell clusters (Figures 1B–1E). To annotate the resulting cell clusters, we first curated a set of marker genes from the PanglaoDB marker gene database (Franzén et al., 2019Franzén O. Gan L.-M. Björkegren J.L.M. PanglaoDB: a web server for exploration of mouse and human single-cell RNA sequencing data.Database (Oxford). 2019; 2019: 46Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) corresponding to expected human cell types. We utilized chromatin accessibility at the promoter as a proxy for gene activity and computed cell-type enrichment scores for each of the 111 clusters to create initial cell cluster annotations (Methods S1; STAR Methods). We next manually reviewed these assignments based on focused consideration of marker gene accessibility (Methods S1). Altogether, we annotated each of the 30 major cell groups and all 111 distinct clusters with a cell type label (Figure 1E; Table S3). For example, within the major cell group of gastrointestinal epithelial cells, higher resolution subclustering and annotation revealed three clusters of colon epithelial cells, one cluster of enterocytes from the small intestine, two clusters of goblet cells from the colon and small intestine, respectively, and three rare populations with distinct chromatin accessibility profiles including enterochromaffin cells (0.060% of total nuclei), tuft cells (0.050% of total nuclei), and Paneth cells (0.045% of total nuclei) (Figures 1B and 1C). Encouragingly, several prevalent cell types detected in most tissue samples, such as endothelial cells and myeloid cells, clustered based on cell type rather than tissue of origin or individual (Figure 1E). On the other hand, tissue-resident fibroblasts clustered into seven subtypes with diverse tissues of origin for each (Figure 1E). Notably, the majority of the 111 cell types exhibited high tissue specificity. For example, highly specialized cell types such as follicular cells, pneumocytes, and hepatocytes were restricted to only one tissue type, reflecting their tissue-specific functions (Figure 1E). Finally, we observed that the cell types we identified by sci-ATAC-seq are highly concordant with those identified by single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments on corresponding tissues (Data S1). To identify accessible chromatin regions in each of the 111 cell types, we aggregated chromatin accessibility profiles from all nuclei comprising each cell cluster and applied a peak calling procedure optimized for single-cell data (Methods S1; STAR Methods). We then merged these accessible chromatin regions to obtain a list of 890,130 non-overlapping cCREs (Figure 2A). These cCREs covered 58.9% of the elements in the registry of cCREs published by the ENCODE consortium (Moore et al., 2020Moore J.E. Purcaro M.J. Pratt H.E. Epstein C.B. Shoresh N. Adrian J. Kawli T. Davis C.A. Dobin A. Kaul R. et al.ENCODE Project ConsortiumExpanded encyclopaedias of DNA elements in the human and mouse genomes.Nature. 2020; 583: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and also included 420,152 previously unannotated elements (Figure S1A). To benchmark these cCREs, we next compared chromatin accessibility profiles between biosamples profiled by bulk DNase-seq and cell types identified by sci-ATAC-seq in the current study. In aggregate, sci-ATAC-seq cell types resembled primary cell type biosamples more closely than bulk tissue or immortalized cell line biosamples (Figure S1B), and prevalent cell types with higher tissue abundance defined by sci-ATAC-seq showed closer similarities to bulk DNase-seq biosamples than rare cell types did (Figure S1C). Out of the 111 cell types profiled in the current study, 44 (40%) did not show statistically significant correlation with any bulk biosample profiled by the ENCODE consortium (Figure S1D). Many of these cell types were rare: their median maximal tissue abundance was only 3.2%, and 36 (81.8%) of them constituted fewer than 10% of all cells in any tissue. Taken together, these findings suggest that our dataset contributes previously underrepresented cCREs from in vivo human cell types to existing catalogs, particularly from cell types with low abundance in bulk tissues.Figure S1Comparison of open chromatin landscapes in adult human cell types from the current study with previous DNase-seq data from bulk biosamples, related to Figure 2Show full captionA) Venn diagram showing the intersection between cCREs identified in the current study with the registry of cCREs created by the ENCODE consortium.

VISTA Enhancer Browser--a database of tissue-specific human enhancers.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D88-D92Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) and found that validated tissue-specific enhancers exhibited much higher chromatin accessibility in cell types comprising a large proportion of nuclei identified in the corresponding tissue (Figure 2B). For example, validated enhancers in heart showed higher average chromatin accessibility in atrial cardiomyocytes (Z score: 1.41) and ventricular cardiomyocytes (Z score: 1.43) compared with other cell types (Figure 2B), suggesting a good correlation between cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility and tissue-specific enhancer activity. We further found that expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from 49 adult tissue types (GTEx Consortium, 2020GTEx ConsortiumThe GTEx Consortium atlas of genetic regulatory effects across human tissues.Science. 2020; 369: 1318-1330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were most commonly accessible in prevalent cell types, such as endothelial and smooth muscle cells. In addition, eQTLs from homogeneous tissues, such as liver and thyroid, displayed strongest accessibility in the corresponding cell type which comprised a large proportion of nuclei identified in the tissue (Figures S2A and S2B). These results suggest that bulk tissue eQTLs best represent sequence variants associated with gene expression in abundant cell types and homogeneous tissues and may be less representative for rarer cell types within homogeneous tissues or for unique cell types from heterogenous tissues. We next categorized each cCRE based on distance to the nearest TSS as shown in Figure 2A. The majority (80.94%) of cCREs in the current catalog resided more than 2,000 bp away from annotated TSSs. cCREs located directly over TSSs or near promoter regions displayed higher levels of sequence conservation and elevated chromatin accessibility (Figures 2C and 2D). By contrast, gene-distal cCREs were less accessible and showed larger variance relative to their accessibility (Figure 2D), suggesting the presence of shared programs of highly accessible promoter-proximal cCREs alongside variable programs of gene-distal cCREs across cell types and species.

Understanding more about these individuals can aid in developing strategies to increase their acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine. The objectives of this study were to describe COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, hesitancy and refusal rates and associated factors in Saskatchewan, Canada.This is a cross-sequential study that consisted of pooled responses from weighted samples of 9,252 Saskatchewan adults (≥18 years) across nine rounds of data collection between May 4, 2020 and April 3, 2021. The outcome variable was vaccine intention: vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, and refusal. The independent variables were layered into socio-demographic factors, risk of exposure to coronavirus, mitigating behaviours, and perceptions of COVID-19. Data were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression and a classification and regression tree.Seventy-six percent of the respondents indicated that they had been or were willing to be vaccinated, 13% had not yet decided, and the remaining 11% said they would not be vaccinated. Factors that increased the likelihood of vaccine refusal and hesitancy were lower education level, financial instability, Indigenous status, and not being concerned about spreading the coronavirus. Perceiving COVID-19 to be more of a threat to one's community and believing that one had a higher risk of illness or death from COVID-19 decreased the likelihood of both vaccine refusal and hesitancy. Women and newcomers to Canada were more likely to be unsure about getting vaccinated. Respondents who did not plan to be vaccinated were less likely to wear face masks and practice physical distancing.While many Canadians have voluntarily and eagerly become vaccinated already, reaching sufficient coverage of the population is likely to require targeted efforts to convince those who are resistant or unsure. Identifying and overcoming any barriers to vaccination that exist within the socio-demographic groups we found were least likely to be vaccinated is a crucial component."
https://openalex.org/W3214523624,"Recent work has highlighted that many types of variables are represented in each neocortical area. How can these many neural representations be organized together without interference and coherently maintained/updated through time? We recorded from excitatory neural populations in posterior cortices as mice performed a complex, dynamic task involving multiple interrelated variables. The neural encoding implied that highly correlated task variables were represented by less-correlated neural population modes, while pairs of neurons exhibited a spectrum of signal correlations. This finding relates to principles of efficient coding, but notably utilizes neural population modes as the encoding unit and suggests partial whitening of task-specific information where different variables are represented with different signal-to-noise levels. Remarkably, this encoding function was multiplexed with sequential neural dynamics yet reliably followed changes in task-variable correlations throughout the trial. We suggest that neural circuits can implement time-dependent encodings in a simple way using random sequential dynamics as a temporal scaffold."
https://openalex.org/W3213196296,"The KCNQ family (KCNQ1-KCNQ5) of voltage-gated potassium channels plays critical roles in many physiological and pathological processes. It is known that the channel opening of all KCNQs relies on the signaling lipid molecule phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). However, the molecular mechanism of PIP2 in modulating the opening of the four neuronal KCNQ channels (KCNQ2-KCNQ5), which are essential for regulating neuronal excitability, remains largely elusive. Here, we report the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human KCNQ4 determined in complex with the activator ML213 in the absence or presence of PIP2. Two PIP2 molecules are identified in the open-state structure of KCNQ4, which act as a bridge to couple the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and pore domain (PD) of KCNQ4 leading to the channel opening. Our findings reveal the binding sites and activation mechanisms of ML213 and PIP2 for neuronal KCNQ channels, providing a framework for therapeutic intervention targeting on these important channels."
https://openalex.org/W3214185212,"Despite the importance of dopamine for striatal circuit function, mechanistic understanding of dopamine transmission remains incomplete. We recently showed that dopamine secretion relies on the presynaptic scaffolding protein RIM, indicating that it occurs at active zone-like sites similar to classical synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Here, we establish using a systematic gene knockout approach that Munc13 and Liprin-α, active zone proteins for vesicle priming and release site organization, are important for dopamine secretion. Furthermore, RIM zinc finger and C2B domains, which bind to Munc13 and Liprin-α, respectively, are needed to restore dopamine release after RIM ablation. In contrast, and different from typical synapses, the active zone scaffolds RIM-BP and ELKS, and RIM domains that bind to them, are expendable. Hence, dopamine release necessitates priming and release site scaffolding by RIM, Munc13, and Liprin-α, but other active zone proteins are dispensable. Our work establishes that efficient release site architecture mediates fast dopamine exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W3214392614,"Medical leaders have warned of the potential public health burden of a “parallel pandemic” faced by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. These individuals may have experienced scenarios in which their moral code was violated resulting in potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs). In the present study, hierarchical linear modeling was utilized to examine the role of PMIEs on COVID-19 pandemic-related difficulties in psychosocial functioning among 211 healthcare providers (83% female, 89% White, and an average of 11.30 years in their healthcare profession [9.31]) over a 10-month span (May 2020 –March 2021). Reported exposure to PMIEs was associated with statistically significant poorer self-reported psychosocial functioning at baseline and over the course of 10-months of data collection. Within exploratory examinations of PMIE type, perceptions of transgressions by self or others (e.g., “I acted in ways that violated my own moral code or values”), but not perceived betrayal (e.g., “I feel betrayed by leaders who I once trusted”), was associated with poorer COVID-19 related psychosocial functioning (e.g., feeling connected to others, relationship with spouse or partner). Findings from this study speak to the importance of investing in intervention and prevention efforts to mitigate the consequences of exposure to PMIEs among healthcare providers. Interventions for healthcare providers targeting psychosocial functioning in the context of moral injury is an important area for future research."

We sought to determine the prevalence of CVD risk factors in a cohort of reproductive-aged South African women living with HIV (WLHIV).While the main purpose of an ongoing intervention study is the reduction of cardiovascular disease through the integration of CVD screening and prevention in the HIV management plan for women of reproductive age (ISCHeMiA trial), we present the prevalence of risk factors for CVD in this cohort of young women at baseline. Sociodemographic, conventional CVD risk factors, HIV-related factors and self body image perception were assessed through study questionnaires and standardized clinical and laboratory procedures.Of the 372 WLHIV enrolled from November 2018 to May 2019, 97% had received efavirenz-based antiretroviral treatment (ART) for at least 1 year and 67.5% (248/367) of women were overweight or obese at the time of enrolment. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 17.6% (95%CI 11.6-22.8) at a median age of 35 years (IQR 30.5-40.5). A significant proportion of women had abnormally low levels of high-density lipoprotein (43.2%, 80/185) and elevated levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (59.5%, 110/185). Seventy five percent of overweight women with an increased waist circumference reported to be satisfied with their body image.The high prevalence of metabolic syndrome, obesity and elevated markers of inflammation in young South African WLHIV, underscores the need for a proactive integrated management approach to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in low and middle income settings."
https://openalex.org/W3214563432,"Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. are considered important foodborne pathogens that are commonly associated with foods of animal origin. The aim of this study was to perform molecular characterization of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. isolated from biofilms of cattle and poultry slaughterhouses located in the Federal District and State of Goiás, Brazil. Fourteen L. monocytogenes isolates and one Salmonella sp. were detected in poultry slaughterhouses. No isolates were detected in cattle slaughterhouses. All L. monocytogenes isolates belonged to lineage II, and 11 different pulsotypes were detected. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed the dissemination of two strains within one plant, in addition to the regional dissemination of one of them. The Salmonella isolate was identified via whole genome sequencing as Salmonella enterica serovar Minnesota ST548. In the sequence analysis, no premature stop codons were detected in the inlA gene of Listeria. All isolates demonstrated the ability to adhere to Caco-2 cells, while 50% were capable of invading them. Antimicrobial resistance was detected in 57.1% of the L. monocytogenes isolates, and resistance to sulfonamide was the most common feature. The tetC, ermB, and tetM genes were detected, and four isolates were classified as multidrug-resistant. Salmonella sp. was resistant to nine antimicrobials and was classified as multidrug-resistant. Resistance genes qnrB19, blaCMY-2, aac(6')-Iaa, sul2, and tetA, and a mutation in the parC gene were detected. The majority (78.5%) of the L. monocytogenes isolates were capable of forming biofilms after incubation at 37°C for 24 h, and 64.3% were capable of forming biofilms after incubation at 12°C for 168 h. There was no statistical difference in the biofilm-forming capacity under the different evaluated conditions. Salmonella sp. was capable of forming biofilms at both tested temperatures. Biofilm characterization was confirmed by collecting the samples consistently, at the same sampling points, and by assessing biofilm formation in vitro. These results highlight the potential risk of cross-contamination in poultry slaughterhouses and the importance of surveillance and pathogen control maintenance programs within the meat production industry."
https://openalex.org/W4226058046,"Loss of skeletal muscle mass and force is of critical importance in numerous pathologies, like age-related sarcopenia or cancer. It has been shown that the Akt-mTORC1 pathway is critical for stimulating adult muscle mass and function, however, it is unknown if mTORC1 is the only mediator downstream of Akt and which intracellular processes are required for functional muscle growth. Here, we show that loss of Raptor reduces muscle hypertrophy after Akt activation and completely prevents increases in muscle force. Interestingly, the residual hypertrophy after Raptor deletion can be completely prevented by administration of the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. Using a quantitative proteomics approach we find that loss of Raptor affects the increases in mitochondrial proteins, while rapamycin mainly affects ribosomal proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that mTORC1 is the key mediator of Akt-dependent muscle growth and its regulation of the mitochondrial proteome is critical for increasing muscle force."
https://openalex.org/W3212173974,"The tumor suppressor gene TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in numerous cancer types, including prostate cancer (PCa). Specifically, missense mutations in TP53 are selectively enriched in PCa, and cluster to particular ""hot spots"" in the p53 DNA binding domain with mutation at the R273 residue occurring most frequently. While this residue is similarly mutated to R273C-p53 or R273H-p53 in all cancer types examined, in PCa selective enrichment of R273C-p53 is observed. Importantly, examination of clinical datasets indicated that TP53 heterozygosity can either be maintained or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) occurs. Thus, to mimic tumor-associated mutant p53, R273C-p53 and R273H-p53 isogenic PCa models were developed in the presence or absence of wild-type p53. In the absence of wild-type p53, both R273C-p53 and R273H-p53 exhibited similar loss of DNA binding, transcriptional profiles, and loss of canonical tumor suppressor functions associated with wild-type p53. In the presence of wild-type p53 expression, both R273C-p53 and R273H-p53 supported canonical p53 target gene expression yet elicited distinct cistromic and transcriptional profiles when compared to each other. Moreover, heterozygous modeling of R273C-p53 or R273H-p53 expression resulted in distinct phenotypic outcomes in vitro and in vivo. Thus, mutant p53 acts in a context-dependent manner to elicit pro-tumorigenic transcriptional profiles, providing critical insight into mutant p53-mediated prostate cancer progression."

After fermentation, FTDs differed in color and structure. Fermentation with A . niger and T . koningii increased the contents of crude protein, crude fiber, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber of TDs. Compared to the unfermented group, the contents of reducing sugar, total flavonoids, total polyphenols, and theasaponins were increased in A . niger FTDs, while in T . koningii FTDs caffeine was completely degraded, the theasaponins were lower, and the contents of reducing sugar and caffeine higher. Regarding free amino acids, A . niger FTDs had the highest content of total amino acids, total essential amino acids, total non-essential amino acids, total aromatic amino acids, total branched-chain amino acids, and total non-protein amino acids, and all types of essential amino acids, followed by T . koningii FTDs and the control TDs. Fungal fermentation had similar effects on the content of various hydrolytic amino acids as those on above free amino acids, and increased the content of bitter and umami components. The composition of essential amino acids of TDs or FTDs was similar to that of the standard model, except for sulfur-containing amino acids and isoleucine. Solid-state fermentation with A . niger and T . koningii effectively improved the nutritional value of TDs, increased the contents of functional substances, and improved the flavor of TDs. This study demonstrated a feasible approach to utilize TDs that not only increases animal feed resources, but also reduces the production of resource waste and pollution."
https://openalex.org/W3212416264,"Background The phase III KEYNOTE-604 study confirmed the benefit of pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Taken into account the clinical benefits of pembrolizumab and its high cost, this study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of adding pembrolizumab to standard first-line etoposide-platinum (EP) for patients with ES-SCLC from the US payer perspective. Methods A Markov model was developed to compare the cost and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of pembrolizumab plus EP and placebo plus EP over a 10-year time horizon. Clinical efficacy and safety data were pooled from the KEYNOTE-604 trial. Utilities were obtained from published resources. Costs were mainly collected from Medicare in 2020. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of our model. Results Adding pembrolizumab to standard first-line EP resulted in the better effectiveness than EP chemotherapy alone for ES-SCLC by 0.22 QALYs. Pembrolizumab plus EP was dominated economically by placebo plus EP, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $334,373/ QALY. Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated that the uncertainty in model parameters exerted no substantial effect on our results. Probability sensitivity analysis indicated that probabilities for pembrolizumab plus EP being cost-effective within a wide range of willingness to pay were modest. Conclusion From the US payer perspective, the first-line treatment for ES-SCLC with pembrolizumab plus EP was not cost-effective compared with placebo plus EP. Although pembrolizumab combination chemotherapy was beneficial to the survival of ES-SCLC, price reduction may be the necessary to improve its cost-effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W3212599192,"Hemophilia A (HA) is a bleeding disorder caused by deficiency of the coagulation factor VIII (F8). F8 replacement is standard of care, whereas gene therapy (F8 gene) for HA is an attractive investigational approach. However, the large size of the F8 gene and the immunogenicity of the product present challenges in development of the F8 gene therapy. To resolve these problems, we synthesized a shortened F8 gene (F8-BDD) and cloned it into a lentiviral vector (LV). The F8-BDD produced mainly short cleaved inactive products in LV-transduced cells. To improve F8 functionality, we designed two novel F8-BDD genes, one with an insertion of eight specific N-glycosylation sites (F8-N8) and another which restored all N-glycosylation sites (F8-299) in the B domain. Although the overall protein expression was reduced, high coagulation activity (>100-fold) was detected in the supernatants of LV-F8-N8- and LV-F8-299-transduced cells. Protein analysis of F8 and the procoagulation cofactor, von Willebrand Factor, showed enhanced interaction after restoration of B domain glycosylation using F8-299. HA mouse hematopoietic stem cell transplantation studies illustrated that the bleeding phenotype was corrected after LV-F8-N8 or -299 gene transfer into the hematopoietic stem cells. Importantly, the F8-299 modification markedly reduced immunogenicity of the F8 protein in these HA mice. In conclusion, the modified F8-299 gene could be efficiently packaged into LV and, although with reduced expression, produced highly stable and functional F8 protein that corrected the bleeding phenotype without inhibitory immunogenicity. We anticipate that these results will be beneficial in the development of gene therapies against HA."
https://openalex.org/W3213525122,"After transcription termination, cellular RNA polymerases (RNAPs) are occasionally trapped on DNA, impounded in an undefined post-termination complex (PTC), limiting the free RNAP pool and subsequently leading to inefficient transcription. In Escherichia coli, a Swi2/Snf2 family of ATPase called RapA is known to be involved in countering such inefficiency through RNAP recycling; however, the precise mechanism of this recycling is unclear. To better understand its mechanism, here we determined the structures of two sets of E. coli RapA-RNAP complexes, along with the RNAP core enzyme and the elongation complex, using cryo-EM. These structures revealed the large conformational changes of RNAP and RapA upon their association that has been implicated in the hindrance of PTC formation. Our results along with DNA-binding assays reveal that although RapA binds RNAP away from the DNA-binding main channel, its binding can allosterically close the RNAP clamp, thereby preventing its nonspecific DNA binding and PTC formation. Taken together, we propose that RapA acts as a guardian of RNAP by which RapA prevents nonspecific DNA binding of RNAP without affecting the binding of promoter DNA recognition σ factor, thereby enhancing RNAP recycling."

https://openalex.org/W3211421275,"The nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a critical viral protein that suppresses host gene expression by blocking the assembly of the ribosome on host mRNAs. To understand the mechanism of inhibition of host gene expression, we sought to identify cellular proteins that interact with nsp1. Using proximity-dependent biotinylation followed by proteomic analyses of biotinylated proteins, here we captured multiple dynamic interactions of nsp1 with host cell proteins. In addition to ribosomal proteins, we identified several pre-mRNA processing proteins that interact with nsp1, including splicing factors and transcription termination proteins, as well as exosome, and stress granule (SG)-associated proteins. We found that the interactions with transcription termination factors are primarily governed by the C-terminal region of nsp1 and are disrupted by the mutation of amino acids K164 and H165 that are essential for its host shutoff function. We further show that nsp1 interacts with Ras GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) and colocalizes with G3BP1 in SGs under sodium arsenite-induced stress. Finally, we observe that the presence of nsp1 disrupts the maturation of SGs over a long period. Isolation of SG core at different times shows a gradual loss of G3BP1 in the presence of nsp1."
https://openalex.org/W3212622261,"Oncogene induced senescence is a tumor suppressing defense mechanism, in which the cell cycle-dependent protein kinase (CDK) inhibitor p16INK4A (encoded by the CDKN2A gene) plays a key role. We previously reported that a transcriptional co-activator chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 (CHD7) mediates oncogenic ras-induced senescence by inducing transcription of the p16INK4A gene. In the current study, we identified myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) as the transcriptional factor that recruits CHD7 to the p16INK4A promoter, where it mediates oncogenic ras-induced p16INK4A transcription and senescence through CHD7, in primary human cells from multiple origins. Moreover, the expression of MZF1 is induced by oncogenic ras in senescent cells through the c-Jun and Ets1 transcriptional factors upon their activation by the Ras-Raf-1-MEK-ERK signaling pathway. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) where activating ras mutations occur frequently, reduced MZF1 expression is observed in tumors, as compared to corresponding normal tissues, and correlates with poor patient survival. Analysis of single cell RNA-sequencing data from PAAD patients revealed that among the tumor cells with normal RB expression levels, those with reduced levels of MZF1 are more likely to express lower p16INK4A levels. These findings have identified novel signaling components in the pathway that mediates induction of the p16INK4A tumor suppressor and the senescence response, and suggested that MZF1 is a potential tumor suppressor in at least some cancer types, the loss of which contributes to the inactivation of the p16INK4A/RB pathway and disruption of senescence in tumor cells with intact RB."
https://openalex.org/W3213337759,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) serve as critical signals in various cellular processes. Excessive ROS cause cell death or senescence and mediates the therapeutic effect of many cancer drugs. Recent studies showed that ROS increasingly accumulate during G2/M arrest, the underlying mechanism, however, has not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that in cancer cells treated with anticancer agent TH287 or paclitaxel that causes M arrest, mitochondria accumulate robustly and produce excessive mitochondrial superoxide, which causes oxidative DNA damage and undermines cell survival and proliferation. While mitochondrial mass is greatly increased in cells arrested at M phase, the mitochondrial function is compromised, as reflected by reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, increased SUMOylation and acetylation of mitochondrial proteins, as well as an increased metabolic reliance on glycolysis. CHK1 functional disruption decelerates cell cycle, spares the M arrest and attenuates mitochondrial oxidative stress. Induction of mitophagy and blockade of mitochondrial biogenesis, measures that reduce mitochondrial accumulation, also decelerate cell cycle and abrogate M arrest-coupled mitochondrial oxidative stress. These results suggest that cell cycle progression and mitochondrial homeostasis are interdependent and coordinated, and that impairment of mitochondrial homeostasis and the associated redox signaling may mediate the antineoplastic effect of the M arrest-inducing chemotherapeutics. Our findings provide insights into the fate of cells arrested at M phase and have implications in cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3214514048,"In recent years, pathogenic strains of Enterococcus cecorum (EC) have emerged as a causing agent of septicemia and skeletal infection in broiler chickens with a high economic impact worldwide. Although research has been conducted, many aspects of the pathogenesis of the EC-associated disease are still unknown. In the present study, an experimental infection model was established in broiler chickens. Two different EC strains (EC14 and EC15) were compared in two different concentrations of each strain (2 × 106 and 2 × 108 colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL)) after oral infection of one-day-old chicks. Clinical signs and gross lesions of the EC-associated disease were monitored in the following seven weeks. Although both EC strains were originally isolated from clinical disease outbreaks and had a high embryonic lethality, only EC14 successfully induced the typical course of the EC-associated disease with characteristic clinical signs and gross lesions. In total, 23% of the birds in the two EC14-groups were EC-positive in extraintestinal organs on culture, and no differences were found between the two infectious doses. EC14 was frequently detected via real-time PCR in the free thoracic vertebra (FTV) and femoral heads without any detectable gross lesions. The number of EC positive spleens from infected broilers was comparable using bacterial isolation and a specific real-time PCR. Interestingly, EC15 was not detected in extraintestinal organs, although birds in the EC15 groups were colonized by EC in the ceca after experimental infection. The present study represents first proof that virulence differs among EC strains in experimentally infected chickens, and emphasizes the need to further characterize virulence factors and pathogenic mechanisms of EC. The strain EC14 at a dose of 106 CFU is suitable for reproduction of the EC-associated disease. The experimental infection model reported here provides the basis for further research on the EC pathogenesis and possible prevention and intervention strategies."

Optimal mitochondrial function is required to support B cell activity during activation. We examined how deficiency of tafazzin, a cardiolipin remodeling enzyme required for mitochondrial function, alters the metabolic activity of B cells and their response to activation by lipopolysaccharide in mice. B cells were isolated from 3-month-old wild type or tafazzin knockdown mice and incubated for up to 72 h with lipopolysaccharide and cell proliferation, expression of cell surface markers, secretion of antibodies and chemokines, proteasome and immunoproteasome activities, and metabolic function determined. In addition, proteomic analysis was performed to identify altered levels of proteins involved in survival, immunogenic, proteasomal and mitochondrial processes. Compared to wild type lipopolysaccharide activated B cells, lipopolysaccharide activated tafazzin knockdown B cells exhibited significantly reduced proliferation, lowered expression of cluster of differentiation 86 and cluster of differentiation 69 surface markers, reduced secretion of immunoglobulin M antibody, reduced secretion of keratinocytes-derived chemokine and macrophage-inflammatory protein-2, reduced proteasome and immunoproteasome activities, and reduced mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. Proteomic analysis revealed significant alterations in key protein targets that regulate cell survival, immunogenicity, proteasomal processing and mitochondrial function consistent with the findings of the above functional studies. The results indicate that the cardiolipin transacylase enzyme tafazzin plays a key role in regulating mouse B cell function and metabolic activity during activation through modulation of mitochondrial function."

However, the protein(s) responsible for this activity have never yet been identified. Based on the fact that tricyclodecan-9-yl-potassium xanthate can inhibit both PC-PLC and sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) activities, and SMS1 and SMS2 have a conserved catalytic domain that could mediate a nucleophilic attack on the phosphodiester bond of PC, we hypothesized that both SMS1 and SMS2 might have PC-PLC activity. In the present study, we found that purified recombinant SMS1 and SMS2 but not SMS-related protein have PC-PLC activity. Moreover, we prepared liver-specific Sms1/global Sms2 double-KO mice. We found that liver PC-PLC activity was significantly reduced and steady-state levels of PC and DAG in the liver were regulated by the deficiency, in comparison with control mice. Using adenovirus, we expressed Sms1 and Sms2 genes in the liver of the double-KO mice, respectively, and found that expressed SMS1 and SMS2 can hydrolyze PC to produce DAG and phosphocholine. Thus, SMS1 and SMS2 exhibit PC-PLC activity in vitro and in vivo."

Adaptor proteins have implicated in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of different cancer cells. The objective of this study was to assess whether the adaptor protein XB130 (AFAP1L2) is a critical biological determinant of CCA outcome. XB130 expression levels were investigated in four CCA cell lines compared to an immortalized cholangiocyte cell line by Western blotting. Small interfering (si) RNA-mediated XB130 gene silencing was conducted to evaluate the effects of reduced XB130 expression on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by MTT, transwell migration and cell invasion assay. The immunohistochemical quantification of XB130 levels were performed in surgically resected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens obtained from 151 CCA patients. The relationship between XB130 expression and the clinicopathological parameters of CCA patients were analyzed. Our results showed that XB130 was highly expressed in KKU-213A cell line. Knockdown of XB130 using siRNA significantly decreased the proliferation, migration, and invasion properties of KKU-213A cells through the inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway, suggesting that XB130 plays an important role in CCA progression. Moreover, elevated XB130 expression levels were positive relationship with lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), intrahepatic type of CCA, high TNM staging (stage III, IV), high T classification (T3, T4), and lymph node metastasis. We provide the first evidence that the overexpression of XB130 is associated with tumorigenic properties of CCA cells, leading to CCA progression with aggressive clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3211453043,"One method known to increase preference for larger, later rewards (LLRs) over smaller, sooner rewards (SSRs) is choice bundling, in which a single choice produces a series of repeating consequences over time. The present study examined whether effects of choice bundling on preference for LLRs: (1) increase with the number of rewards in the bundle (i.e., bundle size); (2) are independent of differences in reward magnitude between conditions; and (3) accord with predictions of an additive model of hyperbolic delay discounting, in which the value of a bundle of rewards can be expressed as the summed discounted value of all rewards in that bundle. Participants (N = 252) completed a choice task to assess valuation of monetary LLRs at bundle sizes of 1 (control), 3, and 9 rewards per choice (ascending/descending order counterbalanced). To control for the magnitude effect, the total reward amounts were held constant across conditions. Choice bundling significantly increased LLR preference (p < .001), with the largest effect observed at the largest bundle size. The descending bundle-size order produced significantly greater LLR preference than the ascending order (p < .05), although order did not significantly interact with bundle size. Difference scores between observed measures and those predicted by an additive model of hyperbolic discounting were small and not significantly different than zero, but were not equivalent to zero. Future research should investigate the clinical utility of choice bundling for reducing the maladaptive health behavior (e.g., substance use) with which delay discounting is associated."
https://openalex.org/W3211653259,"This study examined the influence of consumer empowerment and its self-assessment on consumers' information search behavior and consumer life satisfaction; it also examined whether the results were consistent with the Dunning-Kruger effect. A total of 977 consumers who participated in a national consumer survey were divided into four groups, based on their level of empowerment and self-assessment. The Dunning-Kruger effect was observed in the consumer empowerment results, with 35.9% of respondents showing imbalanced empowerment and self-assessment levels. A general linear model was used to examine the survey results, which indicated that the main effect of empowerment had no significant effect on information searching or consumer life satisfaction. However, there was a significant main effect of self-assessment on both dependent variables. In addition, the interaction of empowerment and self-assessment had a significant effect only on information search behavior. Consequently, it can be concluded that self-assessed empowerment, rather than actual consumer empowerment, affects information search and consumer life satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W3211798528,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the leading causes of morbidity in the general population, and is the second most common infectious disease after respiratory infections. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is essential to achieving good therapeutic results. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the profile of pathogens cultured from urinary tract infections and to determine their resistance profiles to commonly prescribed antibiotics.A cross-sectional study was carried out at the National Referral Laboratory of the Ethiopian Institute of Public Health from January 2017 to December 2018. All positive cultures were characterized by colony morphology, Gram stain, and standard biochemical tests. The antimicrobial susceptibility test of the isolate was performed using the Kirby- Bauer disk diffusion test on Muller-Hinton agar. In addition, bacterial identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and phenotypic detection of MDR were performed with VITEK 2 Compact according to the manufacturer's instructions.Out of 1012 cultured urine specimens, 325 (32.1%) was showed significant bacteriuria. The overall prevalence of UTIs was 325(32.1%) and the highest prevalence rate was obtained from 21-30 years age group 73(22.5%). Among UTIs patients, 583(57.6%) were females and 429(42.4%) were males. The UTIs of 179 (55%) women is relatively higher than that of men 146 (45%). Among 325 isolates, Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) appeared more frequently 252 (51.7%) than Gram-positive bacteria 63 (19.4%). In GNB, E. coli 168(66.7%), Klebsiella species 32(12.7%), and Enterobacter species 13 (5.2%) were dominated isolates whereas in GPB accounted for coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS) 33(52.4%), Enterococcus species 16(25.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus 10(15.9%). Major of the isolates showed high levels of antibiotic resistance to commonly prescribed antimicrobials. Imipenem, Amikacin, and Nitrofurantoin were the most sensitive antibiotics for Gram-negative isolates while Nitrofurantoin, clindamycin, and Gentamycin were effective against gram-positive uropathogens. Overall, 156/256(60.9%), 56/256(22.4%), 10/256(4%) of gram-negative isolates were MDR, XDR, and PDR respectively while among the GPB isolates, 34/63(53.1%), 10/63(15.8%), and 1/63(1.6%) were MDR, XDR, and PDR isolates respectively. Among the tested bacterial strains, 190/319 (59.5%) were MDR, 66/319 (20.7%) strains were XDR, and 11/319 (3.45%) were PDR isolated.The prevalence of urinary tract infection was high, and Gram-negative organisms were the most common causes of UTIs in this study. It was found that the resistance to commonly used antibiotics is very high. Early detection and close monitoring of MDR, XDR, or even PDR bacterial strains must be started by all clinical microbiology laboratories to reduce the menace of antimicrobial resistance that is now a global problem."
https://openalex.org/W3212261368,"The elongated cilia of the outer segment of rod and cone photoreceptor cells can contain concentrations of visual pigments of up to 5 mM. The rod visual pigments, G protein-coupled receptors called rhodopsins, have a propensity to self-aggregate, a property conserved among many G protein-coupled receptors. However, the effect of rhodopsin oligomerization on G protein signaling in native cells is less clear. Here, we address this gap in knowledge by studying rod phototransduction. As the rod outer segment is known to adjust its size proportionally to overexpression or reduction of rhodopsin expression, genetic perturbation of rhodopsin cannot be used to resolve this question. Therefore, we turned to high-throughput screening of a diverse library of 50,000 small molecules and used a novel assay for the detection of rhodopsin dimerization. This screen identified nine small molecules that either disrupted or enhanced rhodopsin dimer contacts in vitro. In a subsequent cell-free binding study, we found that all nine compounds decreased intrinsic fluorescence without affecting the overall UV-visible spectrum of rhodopsin, supporting their actions as allosteric modulators. Furthermore, ex vivo electrophysiological recordings revealed that a disruptive, hit compound #7 significantly slowed down the light response kinetics of intact rods, whereas compound #1, an enhancing hit candidate, did not substantially affect the photoresponse kinetics but did cause a significant reduction in light sensitivity. This study provides a monitoring tool for future investigation of the rhodopsin signaling cascade and reports the discovery of new allosteric modulators of rhodopsin dimerization that can also alter rod photoreceptor physiology."
https://openalex.org/W3213288364,"Background Clinical observations have shown that there is a relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood; however, knowledge about the time course of the changes in atypical lymphocytes and the association with the clinical course of COVID-19 is limited. Objective Our purposes were to investigate the dynamics of atypical lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients and to estimate their clinical significance for diagnosis and monitoring disease course. Materials and methods We retrospectively identified 98 inpatients in a general ward at Kashiwa Municipal Hospital from May 1st, 2020, to October 31st, 2020. We extracted data on patient demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, blood test results, radiographic findings, treatment after admission and clinical course. We compared clinical findings between patients with and without atypical lymphocytes, investigated the behavior of atypical lymphocytes throughout the clinical course of COVID-19, and determined the relationships among the development of pneumonia, the use of supplemental oxygen and the presence of atypical lymphocytes. Results Patients with atypical lymphocytes had a significantly higher prevalence of pneumonia (80.4% vs. 42.6%, p &lt; 0.0001) and the use of supplemental oxygen (25.5% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.0042). The median time to the appearance of atypical lymphocytes after disease onset was eight days, and atypical lymphocytes were observed in 16/98 (16.3%) patients at the first visit. Atypical lymphocytes appeared after the confirmation of lung infiltrates in 31/41 (75.6%) patients. Of the 13 oxygen-treated patients with atypical lymphocytes, approximately two-thirds had a stable or improved clinical course after the appearance of atypical lymphocytes. Conclusion Atypical lymphocytes frequently appeared in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients one week after disease onset. Patients with atypical lymphocytes were more likely to have pneumonia and to need supplemental oxygen; however, two-thirds of them showed clinical improvement after the appearance of atypical lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3212313318,"CRISPR/Cas9 has enabled inducible gene knockout in numerous tissues; however, its use has not been reported in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Here, we developed the brown adipocyte CRISPR (BAd-CRISPR) methodology to rapidly interrogate the function of one or multiple genes. With BAd-CRISPR, an adeno-associated virus (AAV8) expressing a single guide RNA (sgRNA) is administered directly to BAT of mice expressing Cas9 in brown adipocytes. We show that the local administration of AAV8-sgRNA to interscapular BAT of adult mice robustly transduced brown adipocytes and ablated expression of adiponectin, adipose triglyceride lipase, fatty acid synthase, perilipin 1, or stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 by >90%. Administration of multiple AAV8 sgRNAs led to simultaneous knockout of up to three genes. BAd-CRISPR induced frameshift mutations and suppressed target gene mRNA expression but did not lead to substantial accumulation of off-target mutations in BAT. We used BAd-CRISPR to create an inducible uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) knockout mouse to assess the effects of UCP1 loss on adaptive thermogenesis in adult mice. Inducible Ucp1 knockout did not alter core body temperature; however, BAd-CRISPR Ucp1 mice had elevated circulating concentrations of fibroblast growth factor 21 and changes in BAT gene expression consistent with heat production through increased peroxisomal lipid oxidation. Other molecular adaptations predict additional cellular inefficiencies with an increase in both protein synthesis and turnover, and mitochondria with reduced reliance on mitochondrial-encoded gene expression and increased expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes. These data suggest that BAd-CRISPR is an efficient tool to speed discoveries in adipose tissue biology."
https://openalex.org/W3212549633,"Human sweat odor serves as social communication signal for a person's traits and emotional states. This study explored whether body odors can also communicate information about one's self-esteem, and the role of applied fragrance in this relationship. Female participants were asked to rate self-esteem and attractiveness of different male contestants of a dating show, while being exposed to male participant's body odors differing in self-esteem. High self-esteem sweat was rated more pleasant and less intense than low self-esteem sweat. However, there was no difference in perceived self-esteem and attractiveness of male contestants in videos, hence explicit differences in body odor did not transfer to judgments of related person characteristics. When the body odor was fragranced using a fragranced body spray, male contestants were rated as having higher self-esteem and being more attractive. The finding that body odors from male participants differing in self-esteem are rated differently and can be discriminated suggests self-esteem has distinct perceivable olfactory features, but the remaining findings imply that only fragrance affect the psychological impression someone makes. These findings are discussed in the context of the role of body odor and fragrance in human perception and social communication."
https://openalex.org/W3213237525,"Kdm6a/Utx, a gene on the X chromosome, encodes a histone H3K27me3 demethylase that has an orthologue on the Y chromosome (Uty) (Zheng et al. 2018). We previously identified inactivating mutations of Kdm6a in approximately 50% of mouse acute promyelocytic leukemia samples; however, somatic mutations of KDM6A are more rare in human AML samples, ranging in frequency from 2-15% in different series of patients, where their role in pathogenesis is not yet clear. In this study, we show that female Kdm6aflox/flox mice (with allele inactivation initiated by Vav1-Cre in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) have a sex-specific phenotype that emerges with aging, with features resembling a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Female Kdm6a-knockout (KO) mice have an age-dependent expansion of their HSPCs with aberrant self-renewal, but they did not differentiate normally into downstream progeny. These mice became mildly anemic and thrombocytopenic, but did not develop overt leukemia, or die from these cytopenias. ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq studies showed only minor changes in H3K27me3, H3K27ac, H3K4me, H3K4me3 and chromatin accessibility between Kdm6a-WT and Kdm6a-KO mice. Utilizing scRNA-seq, Kdm6a loss was linked to the transcriptional repression of genes that mediate hematopoietic cell fate determination. These data demonstrate that Kdm6a plays an important role in normal hematopoiesis, and that its inactivation may contribute to AML pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3213648174,"Quantitative flux maps describing glycerolipid synthesis can be important tools for rational engineering of lipid content and composition in oilseeds. Lipid accumulation in cultured embryos of Camelina sativa is known to mimic that of seeds in terms of rate of lipid synthesis and composition. To assess the kinetic complexity of the glycerolipid flux network, cultured embryos were incubated with [14C/13C]glycerol, and initial and steady state rates of [14C/13Cglyceryl] lipid accumulation were measured. At steady state, the linear accumulations of labeled lipid classes matched those expected from mass compositions. The system showed an apparently simple kinetic precursor-product relationship between the intermediate pool, dominated by diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), and the triacylglycerol (TAG) product. We also conducted isotopomer analyses on hydrogenated lipid class species. [13C3glyceryl] labeling of DAG and PC, together with estimates of endogenous [12C3glyceryl] dilution, showed that each biosynthetically active lipid pool is ∼30% of the total by moles. This validates the concept that lipid sub-pools can describe lipid biosynthetic networks. By tracking the kinetics of [13C3glyceryl] and [13C2acyl] labeling, we observed two distinct TAG synthesis components. The major TAG synthesis flux (∼75%) was associated with >95% of the DAG/PC intermediate pool, with little glycerol being metabolized to fatty acids, and with little dilution from endogenous glycerol; a smaller flux exhibited converse characteristics. This kinetic heterogeneity was further explored using postlabeling embryo dissection and differential lipid extractions. The minor flux was tentatively localized to surface cells across the whole embryo. Such heterogeneity must be recognized in order to construct accurate gene expression patterns and metabolic networks describing lipid biosynthesis in developing embryos."
https://openalex.org/W3213809587,"Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a driving force for cancer development. The most common causes of CIN include the dysregulation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which is a surveillance mechanism that prevents premature chromosome separation during mitosis by targeting anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). DAB2IP is frequently silenced in advanced prostate cancer (PCa) and is associated with aggressive phenotypes of PCa. Our previous study showed that DAB2IP activates PLK1 and functions in mitotic regulation. Here, we report the novel mitotic phosphorylation of DAB2IP by Cdks, which mediates DAB2IP's interaction with PLK1 and the activation of the PLK1-Mps1 pathway. DAB2IP interacts with Cdc20 in a phosphorylation-independent manner. However, the phosphorylation of DAB2IP inhibits the ubiquitylation of Cdc20 in response to SAC, and blocks the premature release of the APC/C-MCC. The PLK1-Mps1 pathway plays an important role in mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) assembly. It is likely that DAB2IP acts as a scaffold to aid PLK1-Mps1 in targeting Cdc20. Depletion or loss of the Cdks-mediated phosphorylation of DAB2IP destabilizes the MCC, impairs the SAC, and increases chromosome missegregation and subsequent CIN, thus contributing to tumorigenesis. Collectively, these results demonstrate the mechanism of DAB2IP in SAC regulation and provide a rationale for targeting the SAC to cause lethal CIN against DAB2IP-deficient aggressive PCa, which exhibits a weak SAC."
https://openalex.org/W3213959732,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an abrupt deterioration of renal function often caused by severe clinical disease such as sepsis, and patients require intensive care. Acute-phase parameters for systemic inflammation are well established and used in routine clinical diagnosis, but no such parameters are known for AKI and inflammation at the local site of tissue damage, namely the nephron. Therefore, we sought to investigate complement factors C3a/C3 in urine and urinary sediment cells. After the development of a C3a/C3-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (3F7E2), urine excretion from ICU sepsis patients was examined by dot blot and immunoblotting. This C3a/C3 ELISA and a C3a ELISA were used to obtain quantitative data over 24 hours for 6 consecutive days. Urine sediment cells were analyzed for topology of expression. Patients with severe infections (n = 85) showed peak levels of C3a/C3 on the second day of ICU treatment. The majority (n = 59) showed C3a/C3 levels above 20 μg/ml at least once in the first 6 days after admission. C3a was detectable on all 6 days. Peak C3a/C3 levels correlated negatively with peak C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. No relationship was found between peak C3a/C3 with peak leukocyte count, age, or AKI stage. Analysis of urine sediment cells identified C3a/C3-producing epithelial cells with reticular staining patterns and cells with large-granular staining. Opsonized bacteria were detected in patients with urinary tract infections. In critically ill sepsis patients with AKI, urinary C3a/C3 inversely correlated with serum CRP. Whether urinary C3a/C3 has a protective function through autophagy, as previously shown for cisplatin exposure, or is a by-product of sepsis caused by pathogenic stimuli to the kidney must remain open in this study. However, our data suggest that C3a/C3 may function as an inverse acute-phase parameter that originates in the kidney and is detectable in urine."
https://openalex.org/W3214585685,"RNA represents a potential target for new antiviral therapies, which are urgently needed to address public health threats such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We showed previously that the interaction between the viral Tat protein and the HIV-1 trans-activation response (TAR) RNA was blocked by TB-CP-6.9a. This cyclic peptide was derived from a TAR-binding loop that emerged during lab evolution of a TAR-binding protein (TBP) family. Here we synthesized and characterized a next-generation, cyclic-peptide library based on the TBP scaffold. We sought to identify conserved RNA-binding interactions and the influence of cyclization linkers on RNA binding and antiviral activity. A diverse group of cyclization linkers, encompassing disulfide bonds to bicyclic aromatic staples, was used to restrain the cyclic peptide geometry. Thermodynamic profiling revealed specific arginine-rich sequences with low to submicromolar affinity driven by enthalpic and entropic contributions. The best compounds exhibited no appreciable off-target binding to related molecules, such as BIV TAR and human 7SK RNAs. A specific arginine-to-lysine change in the highest affinity cyclic peptide reduced TAR binding by tenfold, suggesting that TBP-derived cyclic peptides use an arginine-fork motif to recognize the TAR major groove while differentiating the mode of binding from other TAR-targeting molecules. Finally, we showed that HIV infectivity in cell culture was reduced in the presence of cyclic peptides constrained by methylene or naphthalene-based linkers. Our findings provide insight into the molecular determinants required for HIV-1 TAR recognition and antiviral activity. These findings are broadly relevant to the development of antivirals that target RNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W3205451910,"Abstract We recently reported that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) slows DNA replication and induces replication stress by downregulating the regulatory subunit RRM2 of ribonucleotide reductase, perturbing deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) supply. Aiming to exploit this effect in therapy we performed a compound screen in five breast cancer cell lines with IGF neutralising antibody xentuzumab. Inhibitor of checkpoint kinase CHK1 was identified as a top screen hit. Co-inhibition of IGF and CHK1 caused synergistic suppression of cell viability, cell survival and tumour growth in 2D cell culture, 3D spheroid cultures and in vivo. Investigating the mechanism of synthetic lethality, we reveal that CHK1 inhibition in IGF-1R depleted or inhibited cells further downregulated RRM2, reduced dNTP supply and profoundly delayed replication fork progression. These effects resulted in significant accumulation of unreplicated single-stranded DNA and increased cell death, indicative of replication catastrophe. Similar phenotypes were induced by IGF:WEE1 co-inhibition, also via exacerbation of RRM2 downregulation. Exogenous RRM2 expression rescued hallmarks of replication stress induced by co-inhibiting IGF with CHK1 or WEE1, identifying RRM2 as a critical target of the functional IGF:CHK1 and IGF:WEE1 interactions. These data identify novel therapeutic vulnerabilities and may inform future trials of IGF inhibitory drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3211974617,"Many studies conducted in the past focused on patients' sociodemographic factors and medical profiles to identify the determinants of suboptimal blood pressure control. However, prescribing patterns and clinicians' adherence to guidelines are also important factors affecting the rate of blood pressure control. Therefore, this study aimed to determine clinicians' prescribing patterns, patients' medication adherence, and its determinants among hypertensive patients at Jimma University Medical Center.A general prospective cohort study was conducted among hypertensive patients who had regular follow-up at Jimma university ambulatory cardiac clinic from March 20, 2018, to June 20, 2018. Patients' specific data was collected with a face-to-face interview and from their medical charts. Clinicians' related data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21.0. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were done to identify key independent variables influencing patients' adherence. P-Values of less than 0.05 were considered statically significant.From the total of 416 patients, 237(57.0%) of them were males with a mean age of 56.50 ± 11.96 years. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were the most frequently prescribed class of antihypertensives, accounting for 261(63.7%) prescriptions. Combination therapy was used by the majority of patients, with 275 (66.1%) patients receiving two or more antihypertensive drugs. Patients' medication adherence was 46.6%, while clinicians' guideline adherence was 44.2%. Patients with merchant occupation (P = 0.020), physical inactivity (P = 0.033), and diabetes mellitus co-morbidity (P = 0.008) were significantly associated with a higher rate of medication non-adherence.The rate of medication adherence was poor among hypertensive patients. Physicians were not-adherent to standard treatment guideline. The most commonly prescribed class of drugs were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Effective education should be given to patients to improve medication adherence. Prescribers should be trained on treatment guidelines regularly to keep them up-to-date with current trends of hypertension treatment and for better treatment outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3211992982,"In settings where antenatal ultrasound is not offered routinely, ultrasound use when a woman first presents to the maternity ward for labour (i.e., triage) may be beneficial. This study investigated patients' perceptions of care and providers' experience with ultrasound implementation during labour triage at a district referral hospital (DH) and three primary health centers (HC) in eastern Uganda. This was a mixed methods study comprising questionnaires administered to women and key informant interviews among midwives pre- and post-ultrasound introduction. Bivariate analyses were conducted using chi-square tests. Qualitative themes were categorized as (1) workflow integration; (2) impact on clinical processes; (3) patient response to ultrasound; and (4) implementation barriers. A total of 731 and 815 women completed questionnaires from the HCs and DH, respectively. At the HC-level, triage quality of care, satisfaction and recommendation ratings increased with implementation of ultrasound. In contrast, satisfaction and recommendation ratings did not differ upon ultrasound introduction at the DH, whereas perceived triage quality of care increased. Most participants noted a perceived improvement in midwives' experience and knowledge upon introduction of ultrasound. Women who underwent a scan also reported diverse feelings, such as fear or worry about their delivery, fear of harm due to the ultrasound, or relief after knowing the baby's condition. For the midwives' perspective (n = 14), respondents noted that ultrasound led to more accurate diagnoses (e.g., fetal position, heart rate, multiple gestation) and improved decision-making. However, they noted health system barriers to ultrasound implementation, such as increased workload, not enough ultrasound-trained providers, and irregular electricity. While triage ultrasound in this context was seen as beneficial to mothers and useful in providers' clinical assessments, further investigation around provider-patient communication, system-level challenges, and fears or misconceptions among women are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3212664295,"Globally, iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) remains a major health obstacle. This health condition has been identified in 47% of pre-school students (aged 0 to 5 years), 42% of pregnant females, and 30% of non-pregnant females (aged 15 to 50 years) worldwide according to the WHO. Environmental and genetic factors play a crucial role in the development of IDA; genetic testing has revealed the association of a number of polymorphisms with iron status and serum ferritin.The current study aims to reveal the association of TMPRSS6 rs141312 and BMP2 rs235756 with the iron status of females in Saudi Arabia.A cohort of 108 female university students aged 18-25 years was randomly selected to participate: 50 healthy and 58 classified as iron deficient. A 3-5 mL sample of blood was collected from each one and analyzed based on hematological and biochemical iron status followed by genotyping by PCR.The genotype distribution of TMPRSS6 rs141312 was 8% (TT), 88% (TC) and 4% (CC) in the healthy group compared with 3.45% (TT), 89.66% (TC) and 6.89% (CC) in the iron-deficient group (P = 0.492), an insignificant difference in the allelic distribution. The genotype distribution of BMP2 rs235756 was 8% (TT), 90% (TC) and 2% (CC) in the healthy group compared with 3.45% (TT), 82.76% (TC) and 13.79% (CC) in iron-deficient group (P = 0.050) and was significantly associated with decreased ferritin status (P = 0.050). In addition, TMPRSS6 rs141312 is significantly (P<0.001) associated with dominant genotypes (TC+CC) and increased risk of IDA while BMP2 rs235756 is significantly (P<0.026) associated with recessive homozygote CC genotypes and increased risk of IDA.Our finding potentially helps in the early prediction of iron deficiency in females through the genetic testing."
https://openalex.org/W3212983456,"Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a neurological sensorimotor disorder that occurs in the evening and night, thereby impacting quality of sleep in sufferers. The pathophysiology of RLS is poorly understood but inflammation has been proposed as possibly being involved. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) can be used as an inflammation marker but results from small studies have been inconclusive in determining whether NLR is associated with RLS. We aimed to assess whether an association between NLR and RLS exists in a large cohort of healthy individuals.Neutrophils and lymphocytes were measured in blood samples of 13,055 individuals from the Danish Blood Donor Study, all of whom completed the validated Cambridge-Hopkins RLS-questionnaire for RLS assessment.In the sample, 661 individuals were determined as current RLS cases (5.1%). A higher proportion of individuals with RLS were females (62.5% vs 47.5%; P<0.001) and RLS cases were older than controls (P<0.001), but no differences in body mass index (BMI), smoking or alcohol consumption were found between the two groups. An increased NLR was observed in RLS cases compared to controls (median NLR: 1.80 vs 1.72; P = 0.033). In an unadjusted logistic regression model, increased NLR was associated with RLS (OR = 1.10 per NLR unit increase [95%CI:1.01-1.20]; P = 0.032); however, the association was not significant in multivariate models adjusting for sex and age (P = 0.094) or sex, age, alcohol consumption, smoking status and BMI (P = 0.107).We found no association between RLS and NLR among Danish blood donors after adjusting for sex, age, alcohol consumption, smoking status and BMI. Further studies are needed to determine whether inflammation is a risk factor for RLS."
https://openalex.org/W3213426775,"Background One of the most cost-effective interventions to enhance child health with the potential to reach families of all economic backgrounds is breastfeeding. Despite the many benefits optimal breastfeeding has, its practice is low due to various barriers among which maternal employment is mentioned repeatedly. Accordingly, this study has explored the experience of employed mothers with regards to breastfeeding, employment, and work environment in Addis Ababa Ethiopia. Methods and findings A descriptive Phenomenology strategy was employed among 17 mothers drawn from different organizations, conveniently, that offer accommodation of six months maternity leave or onsite child care center or had only three months maternity leave. Data were collected through in-depth interviews until information saturation was reached. Recorded interviews were transcribed and translated and the information obtained was then organized and coded to generate overarching themes. Two themes on facilitators and barriers, and addressing barriers were generated after analysis. Mothers recognize the importance of breastfeeding for children but returning to work at three months is expressed as a major barrier to continuous breastfeeding. Mothers who have access to supporting conditions at their workplace expressed better breastfeeding practice and better satisfaction with their job. Conclusions Providing employed mothers with a supporting environment helps them work with better stability, motivation, and satisfaction. This however requires a suitable accommodation with a focus on the different kinds of work environments of the mothers and the different risks related to each respective environment via scaling up and monitoring breastfeeding interventions and calling upon institutions to remove structural and societal barriers to breastfeeding."

This is a cross-sectional study with a quantitative approach and convenience sampling. The sample consisted of 134 professionals (doctors, nurses, and nursing technicians) working in public health services. Three instruments were used, namely, a structure evaluation form, a questionnaire, and a process evaluation form. The results revealed eight positive indicators (adequate infrastructure; rooms for patient assistance; gynecological bed; visual and auditory privacy; waiting rooms; a professional team comprising physicians, nurses, nursing technicians, and receptionists; adequate training of staff to provide health services to people in situations of sexual violence; and most healthcare professionals asking their patients about possible sexual violence situations) and nine negative indicators (reduced number of rooms for patient assistance with toilets; absence of protocols to identify and assist people in situations of sexual violence; absence of leaflets, posters, and other materials on sexual violence; absence of a referral flow chart (specific for people in situations of sexual violence) to specialized services; reduced number of consultations with suspected and/or confirmed cases of sexual violence; non-use of specific protocols; not referral of these patients to the specialized care network; most professionals consider the health unit where they work as unable to help people in situations of sexual violence; a decrease in attendance at health facilities that do not have a protocol for assisting people in situations of sexual violence), making clear the interventions necessary to promote the provision of quality health services that meet the specific needs of people in situations of sexual violence. These indicators are expected to provide subsidies for the improvement of public policies aimed at listening, welcoming, identifying, and treating people in situations of sexual violence."

Socio-demographic, clinical, and microbiological characteristics of EPTB patients registered for anti-TB treatment at a tertiary care hospital, were analysed for identification of predictors of extended treatment. A total of 251 patients (137 lymphadenitis, and 114 pleuritis) were included in the analysis. Treatment was extended to more than 6 months in 58/251 (23%) patients. In the multivariate regression analysis, culture-positive EPTB (p = 0.007) [OR (95% CI) = 3.81 (1.43, 10.11)], history of diabetes (p = 0.014) [OR (95% CI) = 25.18 (1.94, 325.83)], smokeless tobacco use (p = 0.002) [OR (95% CI) = 17.69 (2.80, 111.72)], and slow regression of local signs and symptoms after 2 months of treatment (p < 0.001) [OR (95% CI) = 17.09 [(5.79, 50.39)] were seen to be significantly associated with treatment extension. Identification of predictors of extended treatment can help clinical decisions regarding optimal duration of treatment. Further studies are needed to identify subgroups of EPTB patients who can benefit from a shorter or longer treatment regimen."
https://openalex.org/W3212749021,"Purpose Understanding what constitutes normal walking mechanics across the adult lifespan is crucial to the identification and intervention of early decline in walking function. Existing research has assumed a simple linear alteration in peak joint powers between young and older adults. The aim of the present study was to quantify the potential (non)linear relationship between age and the joint power waveforms of the lower limb during walking. Methods This was a pooled secondary analysis of the authors’ (MT, KD, JJ) and three publicly available datasets, resulting in a dataset of 278 adults between the ages of 19 to 86 years old. Three-dimensional motion capture with synchronised force plate assessment was performed during self-paced walking. Inverse dynamics were used to quantity joint power of the ankle, knee, and hip, which were time-normalized to 100 stride cycle points. Generalized Additive Models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) was used to model the effect of cycle points, age, walking speed, stride length, height, and their interaction on the outcome of each joint’s power. Results At both 1m/s and 1.5 m/s, A2 peaked at the age of 60 years old with a value of 3.09 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.95 to 3.23) W/kg and 3.05 (95%CI 2.94 to 3.16), respectively. For H1, joint power peaked with a value of 0.40 (95%CI 0.31 to 0.49) W/kg at 1m/s, and with a value of 0.78 (95%CI 0.72 to 0.84) W/kg at 1.5m/s, at the age of 20 years old. For H3, joint power peaked with a value of 0.69 (95%CI 0.62 to 0.76) W/kg at 1m/s, and with a value of 1.38 (95%CI 1.32 to 1.44) W/kg at 1.5m/s, at the age of 70 years old. Conclusions Findings from this study do not support a simple linear relationship between joint power and ageing. A more in-depth understanding of walking mechanics across the lifespan may provide more opportunities to develop early clinical diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for impaired walking function. We anticipate that the present methodology of pooling data across multiple studies, is a novel and useful research method to understand motor development across the lifespan."
https://openalex.org/W3213360647,"This study aimed to provide a framework to evaluate team attacking performances in rugby league using 59,233 plays from 180 Super League matches via expected possession value (EPV) models. The EPV-308 split the pitch into 308 5m x 5m zones, the EPV-77 split the pitch into 77 10m x 10m zones and the EPV-19 split the pitch in 19 zones of variable size dependent on the total zone value generated during a match. Attacking possessions were considered as Markov Chains, allowing the value of each zone visited to be estimated based on the outcome of the possession. The Kullback-Leibler Divergence was used to evaluate the reproducibility of the value generated from each zone (the reward distribution) by teams between matches. The EPV-308 had the greatest variability and lowest reproducibility, compared to EPV-77 and EPV-19. When six previous matches were considered, the team's subsequent match attacking performances had a similar reward distribution for EPV-19, EPV-77 and EPV-308 on 95 +/- 4%, 51 +/- 12% and 0 +/- 0% of occasions. This study supports the use of EPV-19 to evaluate team attacking performance in rugby league and provides a simple framework through which attacking performances can be compared between teams."
https://openalex.org/W3213647923,"ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B member 11 (ABCB11) is an efflux transporter for bile acids on the liver canalicular membrane. The expression of this transporter is reduced in cholestasis; however, the mechanisms contributing to this reduction are unclear. In this study, we sought to determine whether miR-199a-5p contributes to the depletion of ABCB11/Abcb11 in cholestasis in mice. In a microRNA (miRNA) screen of mouse liver after common bile duct ligation (CBDL), we found that miR-199a-5p was significantly upregulated by approximately fourfold. In silico analysis predicted that miR-199a-5p would target the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of ABCB11/Abcb11 mRNA. The expression of ABCB11-3'-UTR luciferase construct in Huh-7 cells was markedly inhibited by cotransfection of a miRNA-199a-5p mimic, which was reversed by an miRNA-199a-5p mimic inhibitor. We also show treatment of mice after CBDL with the potent nuclear receptor FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) significantly increased Abcb11 mRNA and protein and decreased miR-199a-5p expression. Computational mapping revealed a well-conserved FXR-binding site (FXRE) in the promoter of the gene encoding miR-199a-5, termed miR199a-2. Electromobility shift, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and miR199a-2 promoter-luciferase assays confirmed that this binding site was functional. Finally, CBDL in mice led to depletion of nuclear repressor NcoR1 binding at the miR199a-2 promoter, which facilitates transcription of miR199a-2. In CBDL mice treated with OCA, NcoR1 recruitment to the miR199a-2 FXRE was maintained at levels found in sham-operated mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate that miR-199a-5p is involved in regulating ABCB11/Abcb11 expression, is aberrantly upregulated in obstructive cholestasis, and is downregulated by the FXR agonist OCA."
https://openalex.org/W3213661781,"The inflammatory tumor microenvironment has been implicated as a major player fueling tumor progression and an enabling characteristic of cancer, proline, glutamic acid, and leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1) is a novel nuclear receptor coregulator that signals across diverse signaling networks, and its expression is altered in several cancers. However, investigations to find the role of PELP1 in inflammation-driven oncogenesis are limited. Molecular studies here, utilizing macrophage cell lines and animal models upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or necrotic cells, showed that PELP1 is an inflammation-inducible gene. Studies on the PELP1 promoter and its mutant identified potential binding of c-Rel, an NF-κB transcription factor subunit, to PELP1 promoter upon LPS stimulation in macrophages. Recruitment of c-Rel onto the PELP1 promoter was validated by chromatin immunoprecipitation, further confirming LPS mediated PELP1 expression through c-Rel-specific transcriptional regulation. Macrophages that overexpress PELP1 induces granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor secretion, which mediates cancer progression in a paracrine manner. Results from preclinical studies with normal-inflammatory-tumor progression models demonstrated a progressive increase in the PELP1 expression, supporting this link between inflammation and cancer. In addition, animal studies demonstrated the connection of PELP1 in inflammation-directed cancer progression. Taken together, our findings provide the first report on c-Rel-specific transcriptional regulation of PELP1 in inflammation and possible granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-mediated transformation potential of activated macrophages on epithelial cells in the inflammatory tumor microenvironment, reiterating the link between PELP1 and inflammation-induced oncogenesis. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of PELP1 may help in designing better therapeutics to cure various inflammation-associated malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W3214070518,"Exposure to ionizing radiation can cause cancer, especially in children. In computed tomography (CT), a trade-off exists between the radiation dose and image quality. Few studies have investigated the effect of dose reduction on image quality in pediatric neck CT. We aimed to assess the effect of peak kilovoltage on the radiation dose and image quality in pediatric neck multidetector-row CT. Measurements were made using three phantoms representative of children aged 1, 5, and 10 years, with tube voltages of 80, 100, and 120 kilovoltage peak (kVp); tube current of 10, 40, 80, 120, 150, 200, and 250 mA; and exposure time = 0.5 s (pitch, 0.984:1). Radiation dose estimates were derived from the dose-length product with a 64-multidetector-row CT scanner. Images obtained from the control protocol (120 kVp) were compared with the 80- and 100-kVp protocols. The effective dose (ED) was determined for each protocol and compared with the 120-kVp protocol. Quantitative analysis entailed noise measurements by recording the standard deviation of attenuation for a circular 1-cm2 region of interest placed on homogeneous soft tissue structures in the phantom. The mean noise of the various kVp protocols was compared using the unpaired Student t-test. Reduction of ED was 37.58% and 68.58% for neck CT with 100 kVp and 80 kVp, respectively. The image noise level increased with the decrease in peak kilovoltage. Noise values were higher at 80 kVp at all neck levels, but did not increase at 100 kVp, compared to 120 kVp in the three phantoms. The measured noise difference was the greatest at 80 kVp (absolute increases<2.5 HU). The subjective image quality did not differ among the protocols. Thus, reducing voltage from 120 to 80 kVp for neck CT may achieve ED reduction of 68.58%, without compromising image quality."
https://openalex.org/W3214199888,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae acyl carrier protein (ScACP) is a component of the large fungal fatty acid synthase I (FAS I) complex. ScACP comprises two subdomains: a conserved ACP domain that shares extensive structural homology with other ACPs and a unique structural domain. Unlike the metazoan type I ACP that does not sequester the acyl chain, ScACP can partially sequester the growing acyl chain within its hydrophobic core by a mechanism that remains elusive. Our studies on the acyl-ScACP intermediates disclose a unique 188GX2GX3G195 sequence in helix II important for ACP function. Complete loss of sequestration was observed upon mutation of the three glycines in this sequence to valine (G188V/G191V/G195V), while G191V and G188V/G191V double mutants displayed a faster rate of acyl chain hydrolysis. Likewise, mutation of Thr216 to Ala altered the size of the hydrophobic cavity, resulting in loss of C12- chain sequestration. Combining NMR studies with insights from the crystal structure, we show that three glycines in helix II and a threonine in helix IV favor conformational change, which in turn generate space for acyl chain sequestration. Furthermore, we identified the primary hydrophobic cavity of ScACP, present between the carboxyl end of helix II and IV. The opening of the cavity lies between the second and third turns of helix II and loop II. Overall, the study highlights a novel role of the GX2GX3G motif in regulating acyl chain sequestration, vital for ScACP function."
https://openalex.org/W3205486800,"In research portfolio planning contexts, an estimate of research policy and project synergies/tradeoffs (i.e. covariances) is essential to the optimal leveraging of institution resources. The data by which to make such estimates generally do not exist. Research institutions may often draw on domain expertise to fill this gap, but it is not clear how such ad hoc information can be quantified and fed into an optimal resource allocation workflow. Drawing on principal components analysis, I propose a method for ""reverse engineering"" synergies/tradeoffs from domain expertise at both the policy and project level. I discuss extensions to other problems and detail how the method can be fed into a research portfolio optimization workflow. I also briefly discuss the relevance of the proposed method in the context of the currently toxic relations between research communities and the donors that fund them."
