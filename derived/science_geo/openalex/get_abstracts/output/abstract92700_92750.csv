https://openalex.org/W2091775431,"A DNA fragment containing the promoter of the mouse metallothionein-I gene fused to the structural gene of rat growth hormone was microinjected into the pronuclei of fertilized mouse eggs. Of 21 mice that developed from these eggs, seven carried the fusion gene and six of these grew significantly larger than their littermates. Several of these transgenic mice had extraordinarily high levels of the fusion mRNA in their liver and growth hormone in their serum. This approach has implications for studying the biological effects of growth hormone, as a way to accelerate animal growth, as a model for gigantism, as a means of correcting genetic disease, and as a method of farming valuable gene products."
https://openalex.org/W1528710182,"A method is described by which an immunoaffinity matrix was constructed by binding antibody directly or indirectly to protein A-Sepharose 4B followed by cross-linking of the complex with dimethyl pimelimidate. This allows optimal spatial orientation of antibodies and, thus, maximum antigen binding efficiency. The affinity matrices were stable to high and low pH buffers without any significant antibody loss. The optimal conditions of antibody saturation, cross-linker concentration, and elution system were established and affinity columns made with the monoclonal antibodies J5, W6/32, and OKT9 for one-step isolation of the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia-associated antigen, HLA-AB antigens, and transferrin receptor, respectively, from cell lysates. The same methodology was also applied to immobilize transferrin with polyvalent anti-transferrin antibodies. This was then used to isolate the transferrin receptor from cell lysates."

https://openalex.org/W2136482187,"Recombinant vectors containing the mouse metallothionein-I gene (MT-I) and the Escherichia coli xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene (gpt) were used to transfect human hgprt− HeLa cells. Transfected MT-I genes are transcriptionally regulated by cadmium but not by glucocorticoids. S1 mapping indicates that the transcripts from transfected MT-I genes begin at the correct transcription initiation site. We also transfected mouse tk− L cells with a vector containing the mouse MT-I gene and the herpes simplex virus-I thymidine kinase gene. MT-I gene transcription is regulated by cadmium but not by glucocorticoids in this homologous system as well. Finally, we fused the MT-I gene promoter/regulatory region to the thymidine kinase structural gene. Thymidine kinase activity is regulated by cadmium when this fusion gene is transfected into mouse tk− L cells. Deletion mapping experiments indicate that the DNA sequences necessary for regulation of the MT-I gene by cadmium lie within 148 bp of its transcription start site."

https://openalex.org/W2045062976,Monoclonal antibodies against a thymus cell differentiation antigen (Thy-1.1) were effective in the therapy of a transplanted mouse leukemia. Passive immunization resulted in high titers of cytotoxic antibody in the serum of treated mice and the suppression of metastatic tumor cells. The tumor-suppressive effects of the monoclonal antibodies were amplified by the administration of exogenous complement. This combined antibody and complement therapy resulted in the cure of leukemia in a significant proportion of the treated animals.

https://openalex.org/W1542488459,"Human alpha 1-protease inhibitor has three oligosaccharide side chains attached to 3 separate asparaginyl residues of the protein by N-glycosyl linkages. Two of the three asparaginyl residues link mostly to the A-type oligosaccharide chains which consist of Man3, Gal2, (GlcNAc)4 and (NeuAc)2. One of the three asparaginyl residues also attaches to a B-type oligosaccharide chain, which consists of Man3, Gal3, (GlcNAc)5, and (NeuAc)3. The ratio of A-chain to B-chain in this particular position is about 2:1. The structures of A- and B-chains of the glycoprotein were examined by periodate oxidation, sequential glycosidase digestion, and permethylation. The results unequivocally revealed the following structure for A-chains. (Formula: see text). B-type oligosaccharide chains have an additional trisaccharide, i.e. NeuAc 2 alpha leads to 3 Gal 1 beta leads to 4 GlcNAc attached to mannose at the (a) and/or (b) position of A-type chains by a beta 1 leads to 4 linkage. The sialic acid of human alpha 1-protease inhibitor was determined to be N-acetylneuraminic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1602254003,"L1210 mouse leukemia cells were synchronized by isoleucine deprivation followed by hydroxyurea treatment. Changes of thymidylate synthetase activity both in cell extracts and in the intact cells (in situ) were followed throughout the cell cycle. The enzyme activity assayed in situ, by measuring tritium released from [5-3H]deoxyuridine, changed markedly in relation to the DNA synthesis pattern, whereas that assayed in cell extracts remained unchanged. In the S phase of the cell cycle, activity of the enzyme was much higher as measured in situ than as measured in cell extracts. Hydroxyurea (1 mM) inhibited DNA synthesis in exponentially growing L1210 cells and was found to inhibit thymidylate synthetase activity in situ. However, the enzyme activity in cell extracts was not inhibited by the drug. In cells with DNA synthesis inhibited by hydroxyurea, the pattern of change of in situ activity with time suggested product inhibition. Results of isotope-dilution analysis of the release of tritium from [5-3H]deoxyuridine in the intact cells indicated that thymidine added to the medium caused strong inhibition of thymidylate synthetase, the most likely limiting step in this pathway. These data allow the suggestion that, during cell growth, thymidylate synthetase activity is regulated by thymine nucleotide(s), and is dependent on the rate of DNA synthesis as well as the availability of the salvage pathway substrate, thymidine."

https://openalex.org/W1573818845,"Protein A-bearing formalinized heat-inactivated Staphylococcus aureus bind rabbit 125I-IgG with high capacity of IgG for antigen. The affinity of immobilized IgG for antigen is equal to the affinity of soluble antibody, and the capacity for antigen approximates the capacity of soluble antibody for antigen. 125I-IgG bound to high affinity sites on bacteria is not substantially displaced in the presence of human serum after 4 h at 4 degrees C, but rabbit immunoglobulin can displace bound rabbit IgG. Protein A-bearing bacteria which have adsorbed IgG free from protease activity in antiserum provide a stable, sensitive, primary solid phase adsorbent with unique features for radioimmunoassay. Sedimentation characteristics of bacteria permit facile separation of bound from free ligand by centrifugation of the primary antibody. Immunoglobulin-loaded staphylococci can adsorb ligand from serum, simultaneously purifying and concentrating ligands for measurement in a single subsequent step. Immunoglobulin-bearing bacteria can be used directly in biological fluids containing immunoglobulin, such as serum and culture media. Improved economy of staphylococci, low nonspecific binding, high functional capacity, stability, and unique characteristics of radioimmunoassay using immunoglobulin-loaded staphylococci compare favorably with conventional solid phase adsorbents."

https://openalex.org/W2134199897,"Actin polypeptides are the most abundant protein components of replicating normal human T lymphocytes, comprising 16% of the total cellular protein. Unlike other replicating cell types which synthesize equal proportions of beta- and gamma-actin polypeptides, T cells synthesize beta-actin as the predominant species. By contrast, leukemic T cells (the Molt-4 cell line) synthesize nearly equal proportions of beta- and gamma-actin. In addition, novel forms of beta-actin in normal T cells and of beta- and gamma-actin in Molt-4 cells appear to be present, perhaps resulting from a post-translational modification process. Otherwise, both divergent T cell types express a relatively common spectrum of polypeptide species, thereby suggesting that regulation of actin biosynthesis may be involved in the neoplastic transformation process."
https://openalex.org/W1511919325,"Cyanogen bromide fragments of alpha 1-protease inhibitor (PI) were chromatographed on Sephadex G-75. Three fragments (CNBr-I, -II, and -III) contained carbohydrates with nearly the same composition, i.e. Man3, Gal2-3, (GlcNAc)4-5, and (NeuAc)2-3. These three fragments were digested with pronase, and the glycopeptides were purified by column chromatography on Sephadex G-50, Bio-Gel P-4, and DEAE-cellulose. The carbohydrate and amino acid compositions of the glycopeptides obtained by these treatments demonstrated that oligosaccharide side chains are attached to three asparaginyl residues which are located in separate regions of the polypeptide chain, and that the carbohydrate chains are made of two different carbohydrate compositions. The A-chain consists of Man3, Gal2, (GlcNAc)4, and (NeuAc)2, and the B-chain consists of Man3, Gal3, (GlcNAc)5, and (NeuAc)3. CNBr-III contained only A-type oligosaccharide while CNBr-II contained both A-type and B-type oligosaccharides in a ratio of about 2:1. CNBr-I, derived from the NH2 terminus of PI, contained mainly A-type, but also some B-type oligosaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W2014324631,"We have studied the regulation of differentiation within the hemopoietic system by fusing mouse Friend cells (which can be induced to undergo red blood cell differentiation) to various mouse lymphomas and myelomas which express characteristic T and B lymphocytes surface antignes. Our results show that both erythroid and lymphoid differentiation markers can be co-expressed within the same cell. To determine whether this result applies to other differentiation states, we fused suspension Friend cells to three adherent fibroblast cell lines, and isolated both adherent and suspension hybrids. In fact, suspension hybrid clones were inducible for hemoglobin, whereas adherent clones were not. No obvious differences in overall chromosome balance were evident between the adherent and suspension hybrids. A similar correlation between suspension morphology and inducibility of hemoglobin was found in hybrids between suspension Friend cells and an adherent lymphoma line. These results show that different developmental programs can be co-expressed within the same hybrid cell; but the strongly adherent type of morphology is inconsistent with expression of the red blood cell phenotype, both in hybrid cells derived entirely from hemopoietic parental cells and in cells from widely different lineages."

https://openalex.org/W1564197710,"The enzyme-CoA intermediate of succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid coenzyme A transferase reacts with methyl mercaptopropionate, a short chain analog of coenzyme A, to release coenzyme A and give a new thiol ester at the active site, enzyme-SR (E-SR). The reaction is reversible, with Keq = 2.4 X 10(-4). Other thiols react similarly, acetyl-CoA. On the other hand, the value of kcat/km for the reaction of succinyl-SR with the enzyme to form E-SR is smaller than that for the reaction of succinyl-CoA to form enzyme-CoA by a factor of 3 X 10(12). Thus, interactions of the enzyme with the nonreacting portions of coenzyme A are responsible for a rate increase of 3 X 10(12) compared with the short chain analog. This increase is close to the total rate acceleration of 5 X 10(13) that is brought about by the enzyme. The rate increase is interpreted as representing 17 kcal mol-1 of intrinsic is interpreted as representing 17 kcal mol-1 of intrinsic binding energy of coenzyme A that is utilized to stabilize the transition state of the reaction; the observed binding of coenzyme A to the enzyme is relatively weak. The thiol ester group of enzyme-CoA is activated for reaction with the nonspecific reagents water, borohydride anion, and thiol anions by approximately 10(2)-10(3) compared with E-SR and thiol esters of acetate. The formation of E-SR at equilibrium is unfavorable by 5.7 kcal mol-2 compared with thiol esters of acetate, in spite of its normal chemical reactivity. This is consistent with a thermodynamically unfavorable conformation change upon thiol ester formation. The observed more favorable formation of enzyme-CoA compared to E-SR by 4.9 kcal mol-1 can be accounted for by utilization of the binding energy of coenzyme A to overcome the unfavorable Gibbs energy of this conformation change, for which there is independent evidence. The reaction of succinate with E-SR is 10(5) faster than with a thiol ester of acetate. This rate increase represents utilization of the binding energy of the specific substrate succinate for catalysis; however, no binding of succinate to E-SR was observed. A rate acceleration of 8 X 10(5) was observed for the nonphysiological reaction of coenzyme A with E-SR to give enzyme-CoA compared to the analogous nonenzymic reaction. This represents utilization of the binding energy of coenzyme A, in large part to overcome the entropy barrier for reaction. The combined effects of several modest contributions, especially the entropy loss of bound substrates, appear sufficient to account for most of the observed rate increase of the enzymic reaction without invoking ordinary mechanisms of chemical catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1580943517,"NADP-linked prostaglandin D2 dehydrogenase was purified from swine brain to apparent homogeneity, as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. Using the purified enzyme free of the 15-ketoprostaglandin delta 13-reductase activity, the reaction product was identified as 15-ketoprostaglandin D2 by mass spectrometry and spectrophotometry. The purified enzyme was a monomeric protein of a molecular weight of 29,000 +/- 1,000. It had a relative abundance of hydrophobic amino acids such as leucine, alanine, and valine. The optimal pH of the enzyme reaction was 9.5. The purified enzyme exhibited high substrate specificity for prostaglandin D2 and strict specificity for NADP. The Vmax and the Km values for prostaglandin D2 and NADP were 22.0 nmol/min/mg of protein at 24 degrees C and 52 microM and 0.4 microM, respectively. The Vmax and the Km values for various types of prostaglandins for 8.6 nmol/min/mg of protein at 24 degrees C and 250 microM for D1; 8.0 and 350 for E2; 3.4 and 400 for F2 alpha; and 9.6 and 540 for I2. Prostaglandin A2, B2, and E1 could not serve as substrate. Although other NADP-linked 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenases were reported to contain the NADPH-linked prostaglandin E 9-ketoreductase activity, this enzyme was free of the reductase activity. These results indicate that this dehydrogenase is responsible for the specific inactivation of prostaglandin D2 in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1577257321,"Neutral glycosphingolipids were isolated from the malignant cells of several patients with different types of acute leukemia. Analyses were performed by high performance liquid chromatography combined with enzymatic hydrolysis of glycosphingolipids using glycosidases (Escherichia freundii endo-beta-galactosidase, jack bean beta-galactosidase, and beef kidney beta-hexosaminidase). We found that acute leukemia cells contain very little or none of the more complex neutral glycosphingolipids that are found in normal leukocytes or chronic leukemia cells. Lymphoblasts, in particular, are rich in neutral glycosphingolipids with only 1 or 2 carbohydrate units. The most significant finding of our study was that, in contrast to normal leukocytes and chronic leukemia cells which have a single predominant tetraosylceramide species, acute leukemia cells (9 out of 10 patients analyzed) were found to have significant amounts of both globo (GalNAc beta 1 leads to 3Gal alpha 1 leads to 4Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1ceramide) and neolactotetraosylceramide (Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1ceramide). These results indicate that the composition of neutral glycosphingolipids in acute leukemia cells differs significantly from that found in normal or chronic leukemia cells."

https://openalex.org/W1498493884,"Murine Ia antigens consist of two glycosylated polypeptide chains, the alpha chain and the beta chain. We have used lectin affinity chromatography to confirm previous work in our laboratory that three distinct, differentially glycosylated I-Ak alpha chains (alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3) exist and to compare the carbohydrate of the alpha chain with that of the beta chain. Glycopeptides derived from pronase digestion of [3H]mannose-labeled I-Ak alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, and beta chains were sequentially passed over columns of immobilized concanavalin A, Lens culinaris lectin, phytohemagglutinin-E, and phytohemagglutinin-L in a prescribed manner to generate a lectin affinity profile, which, in turn, allowed assignment of a minimal oligosaccharide structure for each glycopeptide studied. The lectin affinity profile for each chain was unique. The alpha 1, alpha 2, and beta chains each possess complex-type N-linked oligosaccharides, although the branching pattern and specific sugar residues found on each differ. The alpha 3 chain, on the other hand, possesses predominantly high mannose or hybrid-type N-linked oligosaccharides. Lectin affinity analysis of glycopeptides derived from pronase digestion of high pressure liquid chromatography-isolated tryptic-chymotryptic fragments from alpha 2 and alpha 3 and tryptic fragments from beta revealed that specific minimal oligosaccharide structures were associated with particular fragments. In addition, although tryptic-chymotryptic peptide maps of alpha 2 and alpha 3 were similar, alpha 2 fragments bear predominantly complex-type N-linked oligosaccharides, whereas homologous alpha 3 fragments bear high mannose or hybrid-type N-linked oligosaccharides. Possible explanations of the oligosaccharide heterogeneity are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2019376861,"A spontaneous B cell leukemia (BCL1) grew progressively in normal BALB/c mice after injection of tumor cells but did not grow in splenectomized recipients. Despite the absence of progressive tumor growth, residual tumor cells with malignant potential were found in the peripheral blood of the splenectomized animals. Splenectomy performed after injection of tumor cells but before the development of marked leukocytosis also prevented progressive tumor growth and death of the host. Thus the spleen appears to be necessary for progressive proliferation of this lymphocytic leukemia early after passage in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W56328090,"The lipoidal derivatives of [3H]pregnenolone, prepared biosynthetically, were converted, by incubation with a mitochondrial-microsomal fraction from adrenal cortical tissue, into lipoidal derivatives of 17-hydroxy-pregnenolone and of dehydroisoandrosterone, thus proving that these pregnenolone derivatives can serve as substrates for 17-hydroxylase and for the lyase enzyme that converts a C21-17-hydroxy-20-ketol into a C19-17-ketosteroid. Three synthetically prepared esters of pregnenolone, the oleate, the linoleate, and the arachidonate, were also hydroxylated at C-17 by a similar adrenal preparation. With the synthetic substrates, however, the corresponding esters of dehydroisoandrosterone were not formed."
https://openalex.org/W1503775819,"A mammalian hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase having both 3 alpha- and 17 alpha-enzyme activity is described for the first time. Multiple forms of this 3(17) alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase are present in the cytosol of female rabbit kidney. Four forms of this enzyme were resolved by a purification procedure which included DEAE-cellulose chromatography and isoelectric focusing and three of the isolated enzymes were homogeneous on the basis of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified enzymes exhibited 17 alpha-enzyme activity toward both androgen and estrogen substrates and 3 alpha-enzyme activity toward androgens of the 5 alpha-androstane series. In general, the 3 alpha-enzyme activity was greater than the 17 alpha-enzyme activity and the latter activity was greater toward androgens than estrogens. There were differences in substrate specificity among the enzyme forms. In particular, with estrogen substrates one of the forms displayed a high specificity toward 17 alpha-estradiol 3-glucuronide."

https://openalex.org/W1545693728,"Rate and equilibrium constants were determined for anhydride formation from the thiol esters p-nitrophenyl thiosuccinate (PTS) and N-acetyl-S-succinyl-beta-mercaptoethylamine, and from p-nitrophenyl thioacetate in the presence of substituted acetates. These thiol esters undergo thiol transfer reactions through rate-determining anhydride formation that are models for the enzymic reaction catalyzed by CoA transferase. The same value of beta nuc approximately equal to 1.0 for the nucleophilic reactions of substituted acetates with p-nitrophenyl thioacetate and with enzyme-CoA supports the anhydride mechanism for the enzymic reactions. The bimolecular reaction of succinyl-CoA with enzyme is 10(13) times faster than the nonenzymic reaction of acetyl-CoA with acetate; the intramolecular reaction of bound substrate is accelerated by a factor of kcat/kN - 10(11) M. The nonenzymic intramolecular reaction of PTS is faster than the nucleophilic reaction of acetate with acetyl-CoA by a similar factor of 4.5 X 10(10) M, of which 6 X 10(5) M is caused by intramolecularity and 7 X 10(4) by the increased chemical reactivity of PTS compared to acetyl-CoA. The enzyme may utilize binding energy to increase the reaction rate by making the reaction intramolecular (decreasing the requirement for loss of entropy) and by destabilizing the bound substrate relative to the transition state in an analogous manner. An identical rate increase of 6 X 10(5) M from intramolecularity was observed for the reaction of N-acetyl-S-succinyl-beta-mercaptoethylamine compared with the corresponding acetate. The rate increase in the intramolecular reaction of PTS reflects more favorable values of T delta S identical = 5.0 +/- 1.4 kcal mol-1 and -delta H identical to = 2.9 +/- 1.3 kcal mol-1 compared with the bimolecular reaction."

The most enzyme activity was found in the cytosol fraction. Optimum enzymatic activity was obtained using the detergent Triton X-100, F1-, and Mg2+ at a pH of 7.8. The ATP, ADP, and dithiothreitol had inhibitory effects on the sulfotransferase. The enzymatic activity increased proportionally, over a given range, with increased concentrations of both substrates and of enzyme. The apparent Km of the enzyme for triglucosyl monoalkylmonoacylglycerol was 6.9 x 10(-5) M, and for 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate, 8.5 x 10(-7) M. The enzyme did not catalyze the transfer of sulfate to galactosylceramide. The results of compositional analyses and permethylation studies of the 35S-labeled product of the enzymatic reaction established that the sulfate ester group is located at C-6 on the terminal glucose residue."
https://openalex.org/W1482971864,"Succinyl phosphate reacts rapidly with the thiol N-acetyl-beta-mercaptoethylamine (a CoA analog) to form the succinate thiol ester. This is a chemical model for the enzymic reaction of CoA transferase. It is demonstrated that: 1) the chemical reaction is stepwise, proceeding through the formation of a succinic anhydride intermediate. The rate-determining step at pH 6.6 is anhydride formation. 2) The apparent equilibrium constant for anhydride formation from succinyl phosphate is increased 6000-fold in going from pH 6.6 to 4.4. Formation of the reactive anhydride intermediate is so favorable at pH 4.4 that it accumulates in the reaction solution. 3) The rate constant for anhydride formation is accelerated 60-fold in going from pH 6.6 to 4.4 due to protonation of the phosphate moiety of succinyl phosphate, which enhances its leaving ability. 4) Anhydride formation through intramolecular reaction of the --COO- group of succinyl phosphate is accelerated greater than or equal to 10(5)-fold compared to the intermolecular reaction of 1 M acetate and acetyl phosphate. Thus, in the chemical reaction, anhydride formation can be made rapid and favorable by: 1) making the reacting groups intramolecular; and 2) catalyzing the expulsion of the leaving group. These are modes of rate acceleration that can occur in enzymic reactions. This model study provides support for a mechanism that proceeds through an anhydride intermediate in the enzymic reaction catalyzed by CoA transferase."
