https://openalex.org/W2036677133,"When unfolded proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), transcription of glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs) representing ER-resident molecular chaperones is markedly induced via the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. In contrast to recent progress in the analysis of yeast UPR, both<i>cis</i>-acting elements and transactivators responsible for mammalian UPR have remained obscure. Here, we analyzed the promoter regions of human GRP78, GRP94, and calreticulin genes and identified a novel element designated the ER stress response element (ERSE). ERSE, with a consensus of CCAATN<sub>9</sub>CCACG, was shown to be necessary and sufficient for induction of these GRPs. Using yeast one-hybrid screening, we isolated a human cDNA encoding a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein, ATF6, as a putative ERSE-binding protein. When overexpressed in HeLa cells, ATF6 enhanced transcription of GRP genes in an ERSE-dependent manner, whereas CREB-RP, another bZIP protein closely related to ATF6, specifically inhibited GRP induction. Endogenous ATF6 constitutively expressed as a 90-kDa protein was converted to a 50-kDa protein in ER-stressed cells, which appeared to be important for the cellular response to ER stress. These results suggest that, as in yeast, bZIP proteins are involved in mammalian UPR, acting through newly defined ERSE."

The absence of PARP drastically increases the sensitivity of primary bone marrow PARP−/− cells to apoptosis induced by an alkylating agent but not by a topoisomerase I inhibitor CPT-11 or by interleukin-3 removal. cDNA of wild type or of an uncleavable PARP mutant (D214A-PARP) has been introduced into PARP−/− fibroblasts, which were exposed to anti-CD95 or an alkylating agent to induce apoptosis. The expression of D214A-PARP results in a significant delay of cell death upon CD95 stimulation. Morphological analysis shows a retarded cell shrinkage and nuclear condensation. Upon treatment with an alkylating agent, expression of wild-type PARP cDNA into PARP-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts results in the restoration of the cell viability, and the D214A-PARP mutant had no further effect on cell recovery. In conclusion, PARP−/− cells are extremely sensitive to apoptosis induced by triggers (like alkylating agents), which activates the base excision repair pathway of DNA, and the cleavage of PARP during apoptosis facilitates cellular disassembly and ensures the completion and irreversibility of the process.

Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a fundamental biological process that plays an important role in early development, cell homeostasis, and in diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer (1Kerr J.F.R.

Programmed cell death can occur in response to many stimuli such as genotoxic insult when DNA repair is saturated, removal of growth factors, or activation of the CD95 antigen by CD95 ligand or anti-CD95 antibodies. Morphologically it is characterized by the appearance of membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and DNA cleavage, and finally the cell is fragmented into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies. At the biochemical level, there is increasing evidence for a central role of the family of cysteine proteases, the caspases, in the pathway that mediates the highly ordered process leading to cell death (4Nicholson D. Thornberry N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). Caspases have been identified as the enzymes responsible for the proteolysis of key proteins to be selectively cleaved at the onset of apoptosis. It appears that the role of these proteases in cell suicide is to disable critical homeostatic and repair enzymes as well as key structural components. A discrete but increasing number of specific proteins appears to be targeted for proteolytic cleavage during apoptosis, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP, 1The abbreviations used are: PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MMS, N-methylmethanesulfonate; MNU, methylnitrosourea; wt, wild-type; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside; BM, bone marrow; BER, base excision repair; GFP, green fluorescence protein.

In the last years, cleavage of PARP has been used extensively as a marker of apoptosis. However, the reason for the cell to inactivate this protein during the execution phase of apoptosis is not fully understood. PARP is a nuclear zinc finger DNA-binding protein that detects and binds to DNA strand breaks. PARP has a modular organization comprising a NH2-terminal DNA-binding domain, a central regulatory domain, and a COOH-terminal catalytic domain. At a site of DNA breakage, PARP catalyzes the transfer of the ADP-ribose moiety from its substrate, NAD+, to a limited number of protein acceptors (heteromodification) involved in chromatin architecture (histones H1 and H2B, lamin B) or in DNA metabolism (topoisomerases, DNA replication factors) including PARP itself (automodification) (6Althaus F.R.

Mice lacking PARP have been generated by homologous recombination to assess the biological consequences of PARP deficiency (10Wang Z.Q. Auer B. Stingl L. Berghammer H. Haidacher D. Schweiger M.

We have reported that PARP−/− mice are hypersensitive to genotoxic agents, like γ-rays and monofunctional alkylating agents, compared with their +/+ litter mates. Mutant mice displayed genomic instability as shown by an increased rate of sister chromatid exchanges and an increased occurrence of chromosomal breaks in their bone marrow cells. Using PARP−/− mice-derived cells, we and others have established that apoptosis occurs in the absence of PARP (11Ménissier de Murcia J. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Ricoul M. Dutrillaux B. Mark M.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, we have shown that PARP−/− splenocytes exposed to a monofunctional alkylating agent underwent much more rapid apoptosis than wild-type (wt) cells (11Ménissier de Murcia J. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Ricoul M. Dutrillaux B. Mark M. Oliver F.J. Masson M. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Walztinger C. Chambon P. de Murcia G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7303-7307Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). In the present report, we have studied the specificity of the response to different inducers of apoptosis of PARP null cells and the biological meaning of PARP cleavage during apoptosis. To that purpose, we generated a mutant of PARP in which the specific caspase-3 cleavage site 211DEVD214 has been mutated. A fully active, nuclear, and uncleavable protein has been produced and when expressed in PARP−/− cells delays loss of cell viability and the morphological changes associated with apoptosis upon activation of the CD95 receptor. Immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from either PARP+/+ or PARP−/− mice were cultured at 37 °C (5% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% gentamicin (Sigma), 4.5 g/liter glucose. Bone marrow cells were isolated and maintained in the same culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 mg/ml glucose) containing 10 ng/ml recombinant interleukin-3 (IL-3). The BS(−) SHT construct bearing the full-length human PARP sequence (14Giner H. Simonin F. de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 114: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was used to generate the mutation D214A. The sequence of the oligonucleotide is 5′-GCCACTTCATCCACGCCGGCCACCTCATCGC-3′. The new restriction site NaeI (underlined) generated allowed us to verify the presence of the mutation in further subcloning. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed essentially according to the Amersham kit. After mutagenesis, cDNA was sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. The mutant sequence was recloned in the prokaryotic expression vector pTG 161 PARP, which expressed the wt PARP (15Simonin F. Poch O. Delarue M. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8529-8535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by replacing theBssHII-NcoI wt fragment by the mutated one resulting in pTG 161 D214A-PARP. These vectors were used directly for transformation of the Escherichia coli TGE 900 strain (16Courtney M. Jallat S. Tessier L.H. Benavente A. Crystal R.G. Lecocq J.P. Nature. 1985; 313: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A fragment PstI-PstI containing the whole cDNA from the PARP and D214A-PARP was introduced into theXhoI site of the eucaryotic expression vector pECV (17Belt P.B. Groeneveld H. Teubel W.J. Van der Putte P. Backendorf C. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 84: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) withPstI-XhoI adapters resulting either in pECV PARP or pECV D214A-PARP, respectively. This was done essentially as described by Schreiber et al. (18Schreiber V. de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Médecine/Sciences. 1992; 8: 134-139Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on coverslips were washed three times with PBS and fixed with methanol/acetone (v/v) for 10 min at 4 °C. After washing three times with PBS supplemented with Tween 0.1% (v/v), cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal anti-PARP antibody (1:100 dilution). After washing, the coverslips were incubated with a secondary antibody (Texas Red-conjugated) for 4 h at room temperature. Immunofluorescence was evaluated using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with a C5985 chilled CCD camera (Hamamatsu). 35S-Labeled wt PARP and D214A-PARP were prepared by in vitrotranscription/translation using the TNT-linked kit (Promega, Madison, WI) with T7 polymerase, BS(−) PARP, and BS(−) D214A-PARP. In vitro translated 35S-labeled PARP and35S-labeled D214A-PARP (3 μl of a 50-μl final volume of the TNT reaction) were incubated with 0.2 unit of purified caspase-3 (a gift from Dr. R. Sadoul, Glaxo, Geneva, Switzerland) at different times at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. These were prepared from PARP−/− splenocytes treated with 2 mm MNU during 6 h following previously reported procedures (19Martin S.J. Newmeyer D.D. Mathias S. Farschon D.M. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Kolesnick R.N. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5191-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The cell-free reaction comprised the in vitro translated 35S-labeled PARP and 35S-labeled D214A-PARP (3 μl of 50 μl final volume of the TNT reaction), 5 μl of cytoplasmic extract (10 mg/ml protein), and 4 μl of the following buffer: 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, and 50 μg/ml creatine kinase. Assay of PARP activity was carried out as described previously (20Rolli V. O'Farrel M. Ménissier-de Murcia M. de Murcia G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12147-12154Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Samples corresponding to 200 ng of wild-type or mutant PARP proteins were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C in assay buffer (100 μl) consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml total histones, 2 μg/ml DNase I-activated calf thymus DNA, 200 mm NAD+, and 5 μCi/ml [α-32P]NAD+. The reaction was stopped by addition of 25 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid, 1% inorganic pyrophosphate, and the acid-insoluble radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter (21Niedergang C. Okazaki H. Mandel P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 102: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently cotransfected by electroporation with 3 μg of LacZ-expressing pCHK reporter vector (22Schreiber V. de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 150: 411-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and 15 μg of wt PARP, D214A-PARP, or the parental vector pECV. They were induced to apoptosis by anti-CD95 (1 μg/ml) or 0.5 mm N-methylmethanesulfonate (MMS) 36 h later. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 4 °C and stained with 100 μg/ml X-gal, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, and 1 mm MgCl2 in PBS for 5–18 h. After X-gal staining, the number of viable (flat) and non-viable (round) blue cells was counted. Viable cells remaining after treatment were represented as a percentage of untreated viable blue cells (23Bossy-Wetzel E. Bakiri L. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1695-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). For evaluation of the nuclear morphology of apoptosis, MEFs were plated onto glass slides in 6-well plates and transfected by calcium phosphate the day after. For transfection, 1 μg of a plasmid coding for the green fluorescence reporter protein (pE-GFP) and 10 μg of pECV, pECV PARP, or D214A were used. Cells were treated with anti-CD95 36 h following transfection. Detection of apoptotic nuclei was performed according to Jacobson et al. (24Jacobson M.D. Burne J.F. King M.P. Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Raff M.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) for 10 min at room temperature, incubated for 10 min with 5% acetic acid, 95% ethanol at −20 °C, and then stained with 0.05 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS containing 50 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were mounted with Mowiol and examined with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. Primary bone marrow cells were treated with 2 mm MNU for 30 min, washed, and incubated in fresh medium. Cells were harvested at different times and lysed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 2 mm EDTA, 0.4% Triton X-100 for 15 min at 4 °C. Centrifugation at 13,000 × g eliminated cell debris and high molecular weight DNA. The supernatant was treated with phenol/chloroform (v/v), and the upper phase was precipitated twice with ethanol and analyzed on 1% agarose gel. IL-3-dependent bone marrow (BM) cells are a model system to study biochemical events leading to apoptosis driven by growth factor removal (25Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Collins M. Lopez-Rivas A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2997-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). BM cells were isolated from PARP+/+ and PARP−/− mice (11Ménissier de Murcia J. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Ricoul M. Dutrillaux B. Mark M. Oliver F.J. Masson M. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Walztinger C. Chambon P. de Murcia G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7303-7307Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar) and maintained in culture in the presence of IL-3. As inducers of apoptosis, the genotoxic agent MNU, which specifically activates the catalytic function of PARP, the topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan (CPT-11, a semisynthetic camptothecin derivative), and the removal of IL-3 have been used. DNA damage induced by MNU activates the base excision repair (BER) pathway whereas the genotoxic effect produced by CPT-11 does not involve this pathway. On the other hand, IL-3 removal-induced apoptosis is independent of DNA damage and involves inactivation of survival signals coming from the IL-3 receptor (26Gotoh N. Tojo A. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6197-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We have then compared the responsiveness of BM cells of both genotypes to these inducers of apoptosis by detection of DNA fragmentation into oligonucleosomes. As shown in Fig. 1 A, primary cultured bone marrow cells exposed to MNU undergo apoptosis much more rapidly than their counterparts. In parallel (Fig. 1 B), PARP−/− BM cells showed an increased sensitivity to MNU as determined by a dose-dependent effect on cell viability. When we induced DNA damage by CPT-11, not involving base excision repair, we find a similar dose-dependent effect on DNA laddering, independent of the cell genotype (Fig. 1 C). Finally, when the cells were deprived of IL-3, there were no significant differences in the kinetic appearance of DNA laddering (Fig. 1 D). These cells were also identically sensitive to the cytotoxicity induced by activation of the CD95 receptor and tumor necrosis factor-α in the presence of cycloheximide (not shown). Similar results have been described using primary MEFs (12Wang Z.-Q. Stingl L. Morrison C. Jantsch M. Marek L. Schulze-Ostoff K. Wagner E. Genes Dev. 1997; 18: 2347-2358Crossref Scopus (517) Google Scholar) or hepatocytes (13Leist M. Single B. Künstle G. Volbracht C. Hentze H. Nicotera P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) from PARP null animals, implying that the presence of PARP is not an absolute requirement for completion of apoptosis. In contrast, a more recent study on the role of poly(ADP-ribosylation) during CD95-induced apoptosis, finds that the absence of PARP makes the cells resistant to cell death following CD95 treatment (27Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Rosenthal D.S. Iyer S. Boulares A.H. Smulson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13703-13712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This conflicting result could arise from the use of clones of immortalized/stably transfected PARP−/− MEFs in the above mentioned study, which might influence the responsiveness to CD95. Taken together, these results clearly indicate that PARP-deficient cells specifically have a decreased apoptotic threshold when the trigger is a DNA-damaging agent activating the BER pathway, such as the alkylating agent MNU. During apoptosis PARP (116 kDa) is cleaved to fragments of relative molecular size 85 and 27 kDa. Amino-terminal sequencing of the purified 85-kDa fragment revealed that cleavage occurs between Asp-214 and Gly-215 (5Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar) inside the bipartite nuclear localization signal of PARP (18Schreiber V. de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Médecine/Sciences. 1992; 8: 134-139Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar), leading to a loss of function. Recently it has been confirmed that the tetrapeptide DEXD is the optimal recognition motif for caspase-2, -3, and -7 (4Nicholson D. Thornberry N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). To further analyze the biological consequences of PARP cleavage on apoptosis, the aspartic acid at position 214 was changed to an alanine in the caspase-3 cleavage site, giving rise to the mutant D214A-PARP (Fig. 2 A). As the mutation takes place in the nuclear localization signal, the subcellular distribution of the mutated protein was assessed. For this purpose, MEF PARP−/− cells were transfected with D214A-PARP cDNA, and the expressed protein was immunostained using a polyclonal antibody raised against the whole protein. We found that D214A-PARP protein was completely nuclear, indicating that the Asp-214 residue is not involved in the nuclear targeting of PARP (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, cells transiently transfected with D214A-PARP cDNA were positive for poly(ADP-ribose) production following treatment with 0.1 mmH2O2, as revealed by double immunofluorescence using an anti-polymer antibody (results not shown). The same specific activity was found for both wt PARP and D214A-PARP overproduced in bacteria (20Rolli V. O'Farrel M. Ménissier-de Murcia M. de Murcia G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12147-12154Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 C), indicating that the mutation located in the NH2-terminal domain of PARP does not affect the catalytic activity of the protein as some other mutations do (28Trucco C. Flatter E. Fribourg S. de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). That the D214A mutation gave rise to a non-cleavable protein was confirmed by an in vitro cleavage assay using purified human caspase-3 and the [35S]methionine-labeled PARP prepared by in vitro transcription/translation. Incubation of35S-labeled PARP with purified caspase-3 resulted in the time-dependent cleavage of the 116-kDa PARP into the 85-kDa fragment, similar to that observed during apoptosis. On the contrary, mutant D214A-PARP remains uncleaved even after long term incubation with purified caspase-3 (Fig. 2 D). Similarly, mutant D214A-PARP was resistant to the cleavage by a cytosolic extract obtained from PARP−/− splenocytes (Fig. 2 E) induced to apoptosis by treatment with 2 mm MNU, which is a potent trigger of apoptosis in these cells (11Ménissier de Murcia J. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Ricoul M. Dutrillaux B. Mark M. Oliver F.J. Masson M. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Walztinger C. Chambon P. de Murcia G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7303-7307Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar), indicating that mutation D214A impaired the cleavage by caspase-3 and other caspases acting during apoptosis. PARP has been shown to be an important substrate for caspase-3 (29Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar), activation of which is essential for CD95-mediated apoptosis (30Longthorne V. Williams G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3804-3812Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). CD95 (Apo1/Fas) is a cell death-promoting receptor that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor family (31Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 32Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar). Triggering the CD95 molecule by either agonistic antibodies or by the natural CD95 ligand induces apoptosis. CD95 receptor molecule is directly linked to caspase-8 protease, which cleaves and activates caspase-3, a protease responsible for triggering the execution phase of apoptosis (4Nicholson D. Thornberry N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). On the other hand, upon activation of caspase-3 by proteolysis, PARP protein is also eliminated (33Casciola-Rosen L. Nicholson D.W. Chong T. Rowan K.R. Thornberry N.A. Miller D.K. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). PARP cleavage is, therefore, a hallmark of CD95-dependent programmed cell death. To test whether the presence of an uncleavable PARP mutant is functionally relevant during the cell's commitment to apoptosis, we have analyzed two different pathways to induce apoptosis in MEFs: treatment of the cells with either a CD95 receptor agonist, independent of DNA damage, or with the alkylating agent MMS, where lesions to DNA are repaired by BER and stimulate PARP activity. PARP−/− MEFs were cotransfected with the β-galactosidase reporter plasmid together with the vectors overproducing the wt PARP or the D214A-PARP mutant or the empty vector. Apoptosis was quantified in cells expressing β-galactosidase either following an anti-CD95 treatment or exposure to an alkylating agent. Fig. 3 A shows that 24 h following anti-CD95 treatment almost all cells were dead. Expression of wt PARP did not lead to protection against cell death. However, cells expressing the uncleavable PARP mutant showed a significant delay of about 10 h in the loss of cell viability, suggesting that PARP cleavage is necessary for the cell to achieve the apoptotic program in time. To confirm that loss of cell viability was because of activation of apoptosis, a specific inhibitor of caspase-3, benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD-fluoromethylketone (34Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A.

Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3804) Google Scholar), was used. Preincubation of cells with this inhibitor at 200 μm completely prevented anti-CD95-induced cell death (Fig. 3 B) as has been previously shown (30Longthorne V. Williams G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3804-3812Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast, PARP null cells are more sensitive to apoptosis induced by a monofunctional alkylating agent, and the overproduction of wt PARP restored the viability of PARP−/− cells after MMS treatment, thus demonstrating that the absence of PARP is directly responsible for the sensitization of cells to DNA alkylation. Cells transfected with the D214A-PARP mutant are also protected against the cytotoxic effects of MMS and restore the sensitivity of PARP−/− cells to approximately the same extent as wt PARP (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, in this situation, the absence of PARP cleavage seems not to influence the recovery of cell viability. To study at which step the non-cleavage of PARP interferes with the apoptotic process, we have analyzed the morphology of apoptotic PARP−/− MEF cells during anti-CD95 treatment. For this purpose, MEFs were cotransfected with vectors expressing the wt or the uncleavable PARP and a reporter plasmid expressing the green fluorescence protein (GFP), as described under “Materials and Methods.” We established three different classes of cells expressing GFP, according to the morphology of the cytosol and nucleus: (i) intact cells (Fig. 4 A,upper panels); (ii) cells with cytosolic blebbings but intact nucleus (Fig. 4 A, middle panels); and (iii) cells with a fragmented/condensed nucleus (Fig. 4 A, lower panels). All the cells in the third category had already lost the membrane integrity according to morphological criteria. In MEFs expressing wt PARP, 43% were intact cells, and almost all apoptotic cells had already lost the nuclear integrity (Fig. 4 B). In clear contrast, cells expressing the D214A-PARP mutant were much more resistant to apoptosis; 78% were intact cells, and the fraction of apoptotic cells with nuclear disruption (4B) was low (1.6%) compared with their normal counterparts. In conclusion, the non-cleavage of PARP not only slows down the nuclear events of apoptosis but also interferes with the initial cytoplasmic events leading to cell membrane blebbing, as reflected by the elevated number of intact cells at this time. Studies from different laboratories have addressed the role of PARP in the apoptotic response. We have previously shown that splenocytes isolated from PARP−/− mice undergo programmed cell death much more rapidly than their counterparts when treated with an alkylating agent (11Ménissier de Murcia J. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Ricoul M. Dutrillaux B. Mark M. Oliver F.J. Masson M. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Walztinger C. Chambon P. de Murcia G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7303-7307Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). These results, together with those presented in Fig. 1, suggest that PARP−/− cells are exquisitely sensitive to agents whose DNA lesions are repaired by base excision but are equally sensitive to inducers of apoptosis that do not activate this pathway (12Wang Z.-Q. Stingl L. Morrison C. Jantsch M. Marek L. Schulze-Ostoff K. Wagner E. Genes Dev. 1997; 18: 2347-2358Crossref Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 13Leist M. Single B. Künstle G. Volbracht C. Hentze H. Nicotera P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To explain this specific sensitivity, we have to take into account that PARP participates in the BER pathway in association with XRCC1, DNA polymerase β, and ligase III (35Caldecott K. Aoufouchi S. Johnson P. Shall S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4387-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 36Dantzer F. Nasheuer H.P. Vonesch J.L. de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 8878-8886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reason these cells lacking PARP are much more fragile and undergo programmed cell death faster than parental cells could be explained by the accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage (because of the absence of PARP), which makes the cell unable to cycle and engage the apoptotic pathway to avoid transmission of damaged DNA to a new generation of cells. This view is supported by the fact that PARP−/− cells have prolonged kinetics of DNA rejoining as measured by the comet assay (40Trucco C. Oliver F.J. Giocanti N. Favaudon V. de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and an increased accumulation of p53 in PARP null splenocytes (11Ménissier de Murcia J. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Ricoul M. Dutrillaux B. Mark M. Oliver F.J. Masson M. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Walztinger C. Chambon P. de Murcia G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7303-7307Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar) upon treatment with an alkylating agent. A nearly universal biochemical hallmark of apoptosis is the proteolytic cleavage and inactivation of PARP in the execution phase of cell death; moreover, in all instances where apoptosis is inhibited by whichever mechanism (Bcl-2 overexpression, use of caspase-specific inhibitors, etc.) PARP cleavage is also inhibited. An obvious question to ask is why the cell needs to get rid of this protein to bring about apoptosis. Specific degradation of chromatin is a key component of the apoptotic process. DNA fragmentation during apoptosis is produced by numerous single-stranded nicks in the linker regions of chromatin (41Peitsch M. Müller C. Tschopp J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4206-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and PARP interacts preferentially with single-stranded DNA breaks (42Le Cam E. Fack F. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Cognet J.A. Barbin A. Sarantoglou V. Revet B. Delain E. de Murcia G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1062-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Through this property, PARP probably facilitates the recruitment and accessibility of the BER proteins to repair damaged DNA. Thus, inactivation of PARP by apoptotic caspases might serve to a double finality: first, disable key components of the genomic surveillance (together with DNA-PK (33Casciola-Rosen L. Nicholson D.W. Chong T. Rowan K.R. Thornberry N.A. Miller D.K. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar)) to avoid unnecessary DNA repair during chromatin degradation and second, facilitate the accessibility of endonucleases to chromatin and nuclear disintegration. In support of this, it has been shown that inactivation of PARP by antisense mRNA delivery to the cells results in an increased accessibility of micrococcal nuclease to chromatin (43Ding R. Smulson M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4627-4634PubMed Google Scholar). The preferential localization of PARP in the vicinity of the nuclear envelope (36Dantzer F. Nasheuer H.P. Vonesch J.L. de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1898Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar) also suggests that its cleavage during apoptosis participates in nuclear disassembly and facilitates downstream events, which are temporarily retarded upon expression of the uncleavable PARP mutant. In addition, the uncleavable PARP mutant allows for the persistence of PARP activity, which might positively influence cell viability upon anti-CD95 stimulation. The morphological consequences of expressing uncleavable substrates of caspases on apoptosis have been so far examined for lamin (44Rao L. Perez D. White E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1441-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and p21-activated kinase (45Rudel T.B. Bokock B.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Mutant lamin-expressing cells showed no signs of chromatin condensation or nuclear shrinkage and blocking p21-activated kinase cleavage/activation during CD95-induced apoptosis inhibited membrane cell blebbing, whereas the nuclear modifications were unaffected; prevention of PARP cleavage has consequences at the cytosolic and nuclear level. We have observed in vivo both a delay in cell collapse/cytoplasmic blebbing formation and in chromatin condensation in cells expressing D214A-PARP following anti-CD95 treatment. These effects on cell morphology are strikingly similar to those observed following inhibition of caspase proteases with specific peptides. These inhibitors block only part of the classical apoptotic program such as the external display of phosphatidylserine and nuclear disintegration but not of cell blebbing (46McCarthy N. Whyte M. Gilbert C. Evan G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Obviously, preventing PARP cleavage is not sufficient to inhibit apoptosis as subsequent events take over and bring about cell death. Therefore, inhibiting PARP cleavage prevents loss of cell viability until perhaps proteolytic attack of other substrates promotes cell degradation leading to cell death. This attenuation of apoptosis upon expressing uncleavable PARP implicates PARP as a key substrate targeted for degradation relatively early in the apoptotic process. In summary, the results presented in this study suggest that PARP is not just a “death substrate” but plays a positive role allowing the cell not to undergo apoptosis when the cell is able to repair the damaged DNA. Its cleavage might be a sign that the cell is unable to cope with a saturating DNA injury, arising from either apoptosis-derived chromatin fragmentation or an externally infringed genotoxic insult.

All three proteins are ligands for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP), an abundant neuronal surface receptor that has also been genetically linked to Alzheimer's disease. The cytoplasmic tails of LRP and other members of the LDL receptor gene family contain NPxY motifs that are required for receptor endocytosis. To investigate whether these receptors may have functions that go beyond ligand internalization, e.g. possible roles in cellular signaling, we searched for proteins that might interact with the cytoplasmic tails of the receptors.

Using yeast 2-hybrid and protein coprecipitation approaches in vitro, we show that the neuronal adaptor proteins FE65 and mammalian Disabled bind to the cytoplasmic tails of LRP, LDL receptor, and APP, where they can potentially serve as molecular scaffolds for the assembly of cytosolic multiprotein complexes.

Genet. 1998; 19: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) have also been found to be linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease by genetic association. However, the biochemical mechanisms by which LRP and its ligands could affect the onset of the disease are unknown and are difficult to explain on the basis of ligand internalization functions alone. To investigate the potential biological functions of the receptors other than endocytosis, in particular, possible mechanisms by which ligand binding to LRP or other members of the gene family might transduce a cellular signal, we scanned the amino acid sequence of their cytoplasmic tails for sequence motifs commonly found in other signaling pathways. A conserved sequence motif that is present in two copies in the LRP tail and is also found in the cytoplasmic tails of the other LDL receptor gene family members is the NPxY motif. It was first recognized in LRP (9Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) and subsequently recognized in numerous other cell surface receptors (10Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The single NPxY motif in the LDL receptor is required for endocytosis, presumably through interaction with coated pit adaptor proteins. In other receptors, e.g.the epidermal growth factor receptor, a tyrosine-phosphorylated NPxY motif binds the adaptor protein Shc, which participates in the transmission of the epidermal growth factor signal to theras signaling pathway (11Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). The Shc-epidermal growth factor receptor interaction is mediated by a protein interaction domain (PID) (12Kavanaugh W.M. Turck C.W. Williams L.T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32031-32034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that has recently also been found in a number of other cytoplasmic proteins (14Bork P. Margolis B. Cell. 1995; 80: 693-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 15van der Geer P. Pawson T. Trends Biochem.

Margolis B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 23-38PubMed Google Scholar). Although tyrosine phosphorylation of the NPxY motif is required for Shc binding, this is not required for other PID proteins, which interact with different NPxY-containing proteins. Binding specificity is determined by the amino acids flanking the NPxY sequence (18Wolf G. Trub T. Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A. White M.F. Miyazaki M. Lee J. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol.

In this study we have identified two specific PID-containing adaptor proteins, mDab and FE65, that are primarily expressed in neurons and interact with sequences containing NPxY motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of the LDL receptor and LRP. This previously unrecognized interaction of LDL receptor gene family members with components of the cytosolic signal transduction machinery suggests a potential general biochemical mechanism by which ligands for these receptors could modulate the cellular processes leading to neurodegeneration.

Monoclonal antibodies against the myc-epitope and APP were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. pBTM116 was used as a bait vector (22Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar). Bait sequences were amplified by PCR and sequenced after cloning. The following baits were tested: LDLR (nt 2430–2583), the APP tail (nt 1946–2085), LRP 1–5 (nt 13808–14102), LRP 3–4 (nt 13900–14035), and LRP 1–2 (nt 13808–13922). pGAD424 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used as prey vector. Murine Disabled (nt 1–1667), protein interaction domains of murine Disabled (nt 1–542), FE65C (nt 1602–1984), and p96 (nt 127–531) were amplified by PCR and verified by sequencing. All bait vectors were tested for self-activation. Bait and prey vectors were cotransfected into yeast L40 strain following standard procedures. Cells were spread on selective plates (His-;Leu-;Trp-) and grown for 3 days. Single clones were grown in selective liquid media for 2 days and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 500 μl of breaking buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol). Glass beads were added, and the cells were vortexed vigorously and centrifuged (14,000 × g, 10 min). 25 μl of the supernatant were incubated with 50 μl of reaction buffer (CLONTECH) for 1 h at 22 °C. Light emission was measured in a luminometer. All values were corrected for protein concentration. GST-fusion plasmids of the PID domains of p96, X11, FE65, and Numb have been described previously (19Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The mDab and FE65 PI domains and the LDL receptor and LRP tail sequences were amplified by PCR, cloned into pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia), and verified by sequencing. Fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 bacteria (Stratagene). mDab was isolated by PCR from a murine brain cDNA library using published sequence information (23Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). A myc epitope was fused in-frame to the carboxyl-terminal end by inserting the cDNA into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Stratagene). Liver, brain, and cellular membrane extracts were prepared as described previously (24Kowal R.C. Herz J. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10771-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 293 cells were transfected using the MBS kit from Stratagene. Cells were harvested and lysed in Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim) by forcing them through a 22-gauge needle 10 times. Lysates were incubated with 50 μl of glutathione-agarose and 10 μg of the respective purified GST-fusion protein for 6 h at 4 °C. Glutathione beads were washed rapidly three times in 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 5 min. SDS sample buffer was added to the supernatant and beads. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions and analyzed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies and ECL detection. We used two independent approaches, the yeast two-hybrid system and coprecipitation in vitro, to determine whether any of the previously published PID-containing proteins bind specifically to the NPxY motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of LRP and the LDL receptor. To test interactions with the yeast two-hybrid system, the complete tails of LRP and LDL receptor as well as parts of the LRP tail containing only one of the two NPxY motifs were used as bait. Conversely, mouse or human PIDs were cloned by PCR and used as prey. To test PID-tail interactions by coprecipitation in vitro, PID and cytoplasmic tail sequences were expressed either as GST-fusion proteins in Escherichia coli or in transfected cells. Preliminary experiments did not reveal a detectable interaction of Shc, Numb, or X11 with the LRP or LDLR tails. However, in a two-hybrid assay, both the full-length mDab555 (23Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and the mDab PID strongly interacted with the LDLR tail (Table I). We were unable to determine the binding of the mDab PID to the LRP tail using this method because the complete LRP-bait (LRP) was strongly self-activating under all conditions. A truncated bait construct containing only the amino-terminal NPxY motif (LRP-1) was not recognized by any of the prey constructs, and a construct containing only the carboxyl-terminal NPxY motif (LRP-2) was also self-activating. To control for specificity, we included the APP tail and the carboxyl-terminal FE65 (FE65C) protein interaction domain for which a specific and strong interaction had been previously reported (19Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar,25Fiore F. Zambrano N. Minopoli G. Donini V. Duilio A. Russo T. J. Biol.

Neither the APP nor the LRP1 or LDLR baits bound to the PID from p96, a protein of unknown function that is most closely related to mDab (14Bork P. Margolis B.

To verify that the interaction between the LDLR and mDab had a biochemically meaningful activity, we performed a coprecipitation experiment. 293 cells were either mock-transfected (Fig.1 A, lanes 1, 2, 5, and6) or transfected (lanes 3, 4, 7, and8) with a LDL receptor expression plasmid, and cell lysate supernatants were incubated with a recombinant GST-fusion protein containing the mDab protein interaction domain (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or with GST only (lanes 2, 4, 6,and 8). Glutathione-agarose beads were added, and the LDL receptor in the lysate and on the beads was detected by immunoblotting. The LDL receptor was coprecipitated from transfected cells only by the GST-mDab PID (lane 7), not by GST (lane 8). A similar experiment (Fig. 1 B) was performed using membrane extracts from rat liver and brain, where LRP is abundantly expressed (lanes 1–4). LRP bound to GST-mDab PID (lanes 6and 8), but not to GST (lanes 5 and7). We also performed the converse experiment in which 293 cells were either mock-transfected (Fig.2 A and B, lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6) or transfected (lanes 3, 4, 7, and8) with an expression construct encoding the full-length mDab (mDab555). Lysates were then incubated with either a GST-fusion protein containing the LDLR tail (Fig. 2 A) or the LRP tail (Fig. 2 B), and coprecipitated mDab was detected by immunoblotting. The results from this experiment were consistent with those shown in Fig. 1. mDab bound strongly to the recombinant LDLR (Fig. 2 A, lane 7) and LRP (Fig. 2 B, lane 7) tails, but not to GST (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 8). We also sought to determine to which of the two NPxY motifs in the LRP tail mDab binds. Cell lysates were incubated with GST-fusion proteins containing either the complete LRP tail (GST-LRP), and the amino-terminal (GST-LRP-1) or carboxyl-terminal (GST-LRP-2) motif. As shown in Fig. 2 C, mDab bound specifically to the complete tail (lane 2) and to sequences containing the second NPxY motif (lane 3), but not to those containing the first motif (lane 4) or to GST alone (lane 5). To demonstrate that the mDab protein interaction domain did not nondiscriminately bind to the cytoplasmic tail of any membrane protein, we performed a control experiment in which we incubated the GST-mDab PID fusion protein with rat liver membrane extracts. After adsorption to glutathione-agarose, proteins bound to the beads were separated on SDS gels and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies directed against the SR-BI (Fig. 3 A) or the asialoglycoprotein receptor (Fig. 3 B, ASGPR). Neither SR-BI nor asialoglycoprotein receptor bound to GST-mDab PID (A and B, lanes 3) or GST (A andB, lanes 4). In addition, GST-fusion proteins containing cytoplasmic sequences from various synaptic vesicle proteins that do not contain NPxY motifs did not interact with transfected mDab (data not shown). It had previously been reported that the carboxyl-terminal protein interaction domain of FE65 (FE65C) interacts with the APP tail, whereas the amino-terminal domain (FE65N) does not (19Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). This finding raised the possibility that FE65 might link APP to another membrane protein through a heterotypic interaction. Because the Kunitz domain that is present in some APP isoforms binds to the extracellular domain of LRP on the cell surface, we sought to determine whether both proteins might also be linked through their cytoplasmic tails. Membrane lysates from LRP-expressing wild-type murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF-1), LRP-deficient fibroblasts (MEF-4; Ref. 27Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 293 cells transfected with an expression construct encoding the human APP695 isoform (Fig.4, lane 1) were incubated with GST-fusion proteins containing the mDab PID, FE65N, or FE65C. The mDab protein interaction domain bound strongly to LRP and also to APP (Fig.4, lane 3). In contrast, FE65N (lane 4) interacted exclusively with LRP, not APP, whereas FE65C (lane 5) recognized APP, but not LRP. The present results have shown that the cytosolic adaptor protein mDab binds to the cytoplasmic tails of the multifunctional receptor LRP, the LDL receptor, and APP, presumably by interacting with the NPxY motifs present in the tails. Another adaptor protein, FE65, contains two protein interaction domains that interact with the LRP and APP tails, respectively. Thus, FE65 is capable in principle of linking APP and LRP, raising the possibility that LRP can modulate the intracellular trafficking of APP. mDab specifically interacts with LRP tail sequences containing the carboxyl-terminal NPxY motif and also with the LDL receptor tail. Six of seven amino acids are identical between these two motifs, whereas the amino-terminal motif in LRP shares a lower degree of homology (Fig.5). Other apoE-binding members of the gene family, namely the very low density lipoprotein receptor (28Takahashi S. Kawarabayasi Y. Nakai T. Sakai J. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9252-9256Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and the neuronal apoE receptor 2 or LR8B (29Kim D.H. Iijima H. Goto K. Sakai J. Ishii H. Kim H.J. Suzuki H. Kondo H. Saeki S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11732-11736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), share the same highly conserved NPxY motif with the LDL receptor and LRP, making it likely that they also interact with mDab. In contrast to FE65, mDab contains only a single protein interaction domain; however, when mDab becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated, it can bind several nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, including src, fyn, and abl, through an interaction with their SH2 domains (23Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). FE65 and mDab are almost exclusively expressed in neurons (23Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 31Duilio A. Zambrano N. Mogavero A.R. Ammendola R. Cimino F. Russo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5269-5274Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). mDab is required for the organization of the central nervous system, and mDab knockout mice die within 3–4 weeks after birth as a result of a neuronal migration defect that severely affects the neuroanatomical organization of the cortical cell layering (32Howell B.W. Hawkes R. Soriano P. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Genetic experiments inDrosophila have also revealed a functional link betweendisabled and the abl tyrosine kinase. There, a heterozygous mutation in disabled was shown to exacerbate the phenotype of abl-deficient flies (33Gertler F.B. Bennett R.L. Clark M.J. Hoffmann F.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutations in theenabled gene have the opposite effect (34Gertler F.B. Comer A.R. Juang J.L. Ahern S.M. Clark M.J. Liebl E.C. Hoffmann F.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, in addition to its protein interaction domains, FE65 also contains a WW domain that binds to mammalian enabled (Mena; Ref. 35Ermekova K.S. Zambrano N. Linn H. Minopoli G. Gertler F. Russo T. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32869-32877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), lending further support to the emerging hypothesis that a multiprotein complex with important neurodevelopmental functions could assemble on the cytoplasmic tails of the LDL receptor family members (Fig.6). LRP and two of its ligands, APP and apoE, have been linked to Alzheimer's disease by genetic association. LRP may directly affect the trafficking and hence the rate of the amyloidogenic processing of APP through FE65. Indeed, the binding of the adaptor protein X11 to the APP tail has been shown to reduce cellular APP processing in transfected cells (36Borg J.P. Yang Y. De Taddeo-Borg M. Margolis B. Turner R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14761-14766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In a similar fashion, the binding of mDab and FE65 to cytoplasmic tails may modulate receptor endocytosis. However, the molecular mechanism by which apoE affects the onset of this neurodegenerative disease is unclear. The interaction of mDab with the LRP and the LDL receptor tails now reveals a possible pathway through which the binding of multivalent apoE-containing lipoprotein particles might induce receptor dimerization and thus alter the phosphorylation state of cellular signaling molecules. ApoE3 is the most abundant isoform in the general population. A deficiency in apoE protects APP transgenic mice from forming amyloid plaques (37Bales K.R. Verina T. Dodel R.C. Du Y. Altstiel L.

Genet. 1997; 17: 263-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), and the apoE2 isoform, which binds poorly to the LDL receptor or to LRP, is protective relative to apoE3 (38Corder E.H. Saunders A.M. Strittmatter W.J. Schmechel D.E. Gaskell P.C. Small G.W. Roses A.D. Haines J.L. Pericak-Vance M.A. Science. 1993; 261: 921-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (6957) Google Scholar, 39Corder E.H.

Genet. 1994; 7: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). ApoE3 and apoE4 bind equally well to the receptors but prefer lipoprotein particles of different size (40Dong L.M. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19053-19057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This difference in physicochemical properties of the apoE isoforms could explain why apoE4 predisposes to late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and why apoE3 and apoE4 differentially affect neurite outgrowth and branching in vitro (41Holtzman D.M. Pitas R.E. Kilbridge J. Nathan B. Mahley R.W. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9480-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 42Nathan B.P. Bellosta S. Sanan D.A. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. Science. 1994; 264: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). A frequent polymorphism in the LRP ligand α2-macroglobulin, a protease inhibitor with broad substrate specificity, has only recently been reported to be a powerful modulator of the onset of Alzheimer's disease (8Blacker D. Wilcox M.A. Laird N.M. Rodes L. Horvath S.M. Go R.C.P. Perry R. Watson B. Bassett S.S. McInnis M.G. Albert M.S. Hyman B.T. Tanzi R.E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). α2-Macroglobulin is a homotetramer that can also induce dimerization of LRP upon proteolytic activation (43Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14011-14017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the described polymorphism affects α2-macroglobulin levels or its ability to be activated by proteases is currently unknown. In conclusion, the results presented in this study have revealed interactions between the tails of the LDL receptor, LRP, APP, and the adaptor proteins mDab and FE65 that may go beyond the modulation of endocytic events. The hypothetical model we have postulated suggests a possible mechanism by which different isoforms of apoE or α2-macroglobulin alleles predispose to or protect from Alzheimer's disease. Future experiments in vitro and in genetically manipulated animals will be required to test the physiological relevance of these protein interactions for endocytosis, cellular signaling, and neuronal cell function. We thank David Russell, Mike Brown, and Joe Goldstein for critical reading of the manuscript and helpful comments and Michael Gotthardt for providing the GST-fusion proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2098962649,"The sesquiterpene lactone helenalin is a potent anti-inflammatory drug whose molecular mechanism of action remains unclear despite numerous investigations. We have previously shown that helenalin and other sesquiterpene lactones selectively inhibit activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, a central mediator of the human immune response. These drugs must target a central step in NF-κB pathway, since they inhibit NF-κB induction by four different stimuli. It has previously been reported that sesquiterpene lactones exert their effect by inhibiting degradation of IκB, the inhibitory subunit of NF-κB. These data contradicted our report that IκB is not detectable in helenalin-treated, ocadaic acid-stimulated cells. Here we use confocal laser scanning microscopy to demonstrate the presence of IκB-released, nuclear NF-κB in helenalin-treated, tumor necrosis factor-α stimulated cells. These data show that neither IκB degradation nor NF-κB nuclear translocation are inhibited by helenalin. Rather, we provide evidence that helenalin selectively alkylates the p65 subunit of NF-κB. This sesquiterpene lactone is the first anti-inflammatory agent shown to exert its effect by directly modifying NF-κB."
https://openalex.org/W2093478842,"High concentrations of glucose are considered to be toxic for the pancreatic β-cell. However, the mechanisms underlying β-cell dysfunction and resulting cell death are not fully characterized. In the present study we have demonstrated that incubation of pancreatic islets and β-cells from ob/ob mice and Wistar rats with glucose induced a process of apoptotic β-cell death, as shown by DNA laddering, TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) technique, and by using DNA-staining dye HOECHST 33342. The obtained results show that the percentage of apoptotic cells was dependent on glucose concentration, being minimal at 11 mm glucose. At a concentration of 100 μm, aurintricarboxylic acid, an inhibitor of endonuclease activity, almost completely inhibited apoptosis triggered by 17 mm glucose. We have also shown that long term incubation with 100 μm sulfonylurea, tolbutamide, triggered apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells. The process of β-cell death induced by high glucose concentration and tolbutamide were Ca2+-dependent, because introduction to the culture medium of 50 μm D-600 or 200 μmdiazoxide, which blocked glucose- and tolbutamide-induced [Ca2+]i increase, inhibited apoptosis. Thus, this study shows for the first time that high glucose concentrations and tolbutamide induce apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells, and that this process is Ca2+-dependent.

Glucose is the principal regulator of pancreatic β-cell function. Metabolism of glucose in the pancreatic β-cell leads to generation of ATP, closure of ATP-regulated K+ channels (KATP channels), plasma membrane depolarization, opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) 1The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+]i, cytoplasmic free Ca2+concentration; KATP channels, ATP-dependent K+ channels; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PI, propidium iodide; ATA, aurintricarboxylic acid; IL-1β, interleukin 1-β; HO 342, HOECHST 33342. and thereby insulin release (1Efendić S.

The persistent hyperglycemia, which is a feature of diabetes mellitus, may also cause eye, nerve, and kidney microvascular complications. Despite the convincing evidence for glucose toxicity in pancreatic β-cells, resulting in cell death, the underlying mechanisms have not yet been identified. Cell death could be categorized as either necrotic (accidental) or apoptotic (programmed). Apoptosis is a mechanism of self-destruction, and a variety of stimuli and processes have been shown to induce apoptosis. Among those are DNA damage, growth factor deprivation, environmental toxins, heat shock, viral infections, and immune response (12McConkey D.J. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Mol. Aspects Med. 1996; 17: 1-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether glucose and the antidiabetic sulfonylurea drug, tolbutamide, can trigger apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells. RPMI 1640 medium and fetal calf serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. IL-1β, tolbutamide, bovine serum albumin, aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), diazoxide, palmitate, and oleate were purchased from Sigma. The fluorescent dyes fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), propidium iodide (PI), HOECHST 33342 (HO 342), and fura-2 acetoxymetyl ester were from Molecular Probes. The kit for TUNEL reaction was received from Boehringer Mannheim. All other reagents were of analytical grade and obtained from MERCK. 10–12-month-old obese (ob/ob) mice, obtained from a local colony, as well as 2–3-month-old Wistar rats were used. Pancreatic islets from ob/ob mice contain approximately 90% β-cells (13Nilsson T. Arkhammar P. Hallberg A. Hellman B. Berggren P.O. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Islets were isolated by collagenase digestion and dispersed into small β-cell clusters in Ca2+- and Mg2+-deficient medium, as described previously (14Lernmark Å. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on glass coverslips in plastic Petri dishes for 40 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing different concentrations of glucose and other test substances, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Fatty acids (sodium salts) were dissolved in 95% ethanol before being added to the culture media, as described previously (15Zhou Y.-P. Grill V.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The final concentration of ethanol in the medium was 1.25% (v/v) at the concentration of 0.25 mmpalmitate and 0.125 mm oleate. Control incubations with 1.25% ethanol did not affect the apoptotic process. The percentages of dead cells were assessed in single cell preparations on glass coverslips after a culture period of 40 h. For this purpose, pancreatic β-cells were exposed to the DNA binding dye HO 342 at a concentration of 20 μg/ml for 10 min at room temperature. HO 342 freely passes the plasma membrane of intact cells as well as damaged cells and stains DNA blue. Morphological changes corresponding to dead cells were visualized using an inverted fluorescence microscope with a mercury lamp in combination with excitation filter 340–380 nm and emission filter >430 nm. Pancreatic islets were cultured 40 h in a medium containing different concentrations of glucose and other substances. After this period islets were dispersed into a suspension of β-cells as described above. Aliquots from the cell suspensions containing 1 × 106 cells were disrupted by resuspension in ultrapure water containing 10 mg/ml RNase and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Loading buffer was added to this suspension. Electrophoresis was run with a constant voltage of 20 V overnight and then 90 V for 1 h on 1.8% agarose gels containing proteinase K. The mixture of pBR 328 DNA-BglI and pBR 328 DNA-HinfI was used as a marker. The separated DNA was stained with ethidium bromide, visualized by UV light, and photographed. TUNEL technique was used to detect DNA strand breaks in situ. After 40 h of incubation, pancreatic β-cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 80% methanol at 4 °C. After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were covered with 100 μl of reaction mixture for TUNEL enzymatic reaction and were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding a buffer containing 300 mmNaCl and 30 mm sodium citrate. Apoptotic cells were determined using the combination of two fluorescent dyes, FITC and PI. Cells doubled stained with FITC and PI were fixed on glass slides with 50% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline. Fluorescence was monitored with a Leica TCS NT laser-scanning confocal microscope (Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany), with excitation from the 488-nm line of an argon/krypton laser. Fluorescence emission was detected with a bandpass filter (from Chroma Technology Corp.) centered at 530 nm for FITC and above 590 nm for PI. The pinhole was set to give a confocal section thickness of 1 mm, using a 25 × 0.75 PL Fluotar oil-immersion objective. Cells were loaded with 2 μm Ca2+ fluorescent indicator fura-2 acetoxymetyl ester at 37 °C for 30 min in a basal buffer containing: 125 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.28 mmCaCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 3.3 mm glucose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. The coverslips formed the bottom of an open chamber and were perifused with the buffer and other additions mentioned in the figure legends at a perifusion rate of 150 μl/min at 37 °C. Measurements of the fluorescence ratio F340/F380, reflecting [Ca2+]i, were made as described previously (16Kindmark H. Köhler M. Efendić S. Rorsman P. Larsson O. Berggren P.O. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Confocal images were processed using a Corel Photo-Paint and Corel Draw program. Data analysis were performed using the program Sigma Plot for Windows (version 4, Jandel Corp.). Given protocols were tested in pancreatic β-cells from 3–5 preparations from different animals. The statistical significance between means was assessed by Student's t test for unpaired values. To evaluate the effect of glucose on pancreatic β-cell survival, the cells were incubated for 40 h in RPMI 1640 medium with 0, 3, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, and 27 mm glucose and then examined for nuclear DNA staining with fluorescent probe HO 342. As shown in Fig. 1, the absence of glucose in the culture medium gave rise to pronounced cell death. β-Cell death was minimal at 8–11 mm glucose and increased at higher concentrations (Fig. 1). Because RPMI 1640 medium with 11 mm glucose was shown to be optimal for culturing of pancreatic β-cells, this condition was chosen as the control. For evaluation of apoptotic changes after exposure to high glucose concentration, analysis of pancreatic islet DNA fragmentation by gel electrophoresis as well as by TUNEL labeling and double staining of pancreatic β-cells for confocal microscopy were performed. The extent of DNA laddering is shown in Fig.2. There was no detectable DNA laddering in gel electrophoresis after incubation of ob/ob mice pancreatic islets in RPMI 1640 medium with 11 mm glucose (standard culture conditions) for 40 h (Fig. 2, first lane). The addition of 100 units/ml IL-1β, a well known inducer of apoptosis in β-cells (17Ling Z. In't Veld P.A. Pipeleers D.G. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 56-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ankarcrona M. Dypbukt J.M. Brüne B. Nicotera P. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), led to characteristic apoptotic DNA laddering pattern (Fig.2, second lane) and was used as a positive control for evaluation of apoptosis in our system. The incubation of pancreatic islets in medium containing 17 mm (Fig. 2, third lane) or 27 mm (Fig. 2, fourth lane) glucose during 40 h led to DNA laddering, suggesting that long term exposure to high glucose concentration triggered apoptosis. Interestingly, in this case 17 mm glucose induced more DNA laddering than 27 mm glucose. It is well known that Ca2+ plays an important role in the regulation of the apoptotic process in multiple experimental models (19Orrenius S. McConkey D.J. Bellomo G. Nicotera P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 281-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 20McConkey D.J. Orrenius S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

To investigate whether the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by glucose was responsible for the activation of the apoptotic process under our experimental conditions we used diazoxide, an opener of KATP channels, which hyperpolarizes β-cell membrane and thus inhibits glucose-induced [Ca2+]i increase. Fig.3 shows that the addition of 200 μm diazoxide abolished the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by 17 or 27 mmglucose. The presence of 200 μm diazoxide also decreased DNA laddering induced by 17 mm (Fig. 2, fifth lane) and 27 mm glucose (Fig. 2, sixth lane), suggesting that glucose-induced apoptosis is a Ca2+-dependent process. To study whether a [Ca2+]i elevation per se may trigger apoptosis in pancreatic islets, the sulfonylurea tolbutamide was used. Tolbutamide induces Ca2+ influx into β-cells by closure of KATP channels and subsequent opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (23Henquin J.C. Diabetologia. 1980; 18: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Incubation of pancreatic islets with 100 μmtolbutamide for 40 h led to apoptotic changes, as evaluated by DNA laddering (Fig. 2, seventh lane). To investigate whether the apoptotic changes observed in pancreatic islets also occurred in dispersed β-cells, the TUNEL labeling technique with consecutive FITC/PI double staining and subsequent confocal microscopy analysis were used. The results obtained show that after 40 h of incubation with 11 mm glucose, 7.8 ± 1.4% (n = 8) β-cells underwent apoptosis and showed nuclear condensation and chromatin compaction (Figs.4 and 5). Exposure of dispersed β-cells to 100 units/ml IL-1β, which served as a positive control in our studies, resulted in an increased formation of apoptotic cells (Figs. 4 B and 5 B). A decrease in glucose concentration in the incubation medium from 11 to 5.5 mm (Fig. 4, A and H, and5 A) and an elevation from 11 to 17 or 27 mm also gave an increase in the number of apoptotic cells (Fig. 4, A, C, and E, and 5 A). The addition of 200 μm diazoxide to the culture medium containing 17 or 27 mm glucose diminished the number of apoptotic cells almost to the control level (Fig. 4, D and F, and5 A) but did not affect the number of apoptotic cells when the culture medium contained 5.5 mm glucose (Fig.5 A). Similar effects were observed when Ca2+influx into β-cells was inhibited using D-600, a blocker of voltage-gated L-type channels (Fig. 5 A). Exposure of pancreatic β-cells to 100 μm tolbutamide raised the number of apoptotic cells (Fig. 4 G and 5 B), the effect being completely inhibited by 200 μm diazoxide (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5Percentage of apoptotic cells detected by confocal microscopy. Several confocal images (15–35) of small clusters of pancreatic β-cells from ob/ob mice incubated for 40 h with different agents were collected, and the number of apoptotic cells detected by double staining FITC/PI technique (A andB) was counted.

Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), almost completely inhibited high glucose-induced apoptosis (Fig.5 A). The percentage of dead cells in the presence of ATA was significantly higher at 27 mm than at 17 mmglucose (Fig. 5 C). However, the percentage of ATA-induced decrease in dead cells in the presence of 17 or 27 mmglucose was not different, 20.0 ± 3.7 and 27.1 ± 7.4% at 17 mm and 27 mm glucose, respectively,n = 4. In a recent publication by Roche et al. (25Roche E. Farfari S. Witters L.A. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Thumelin S. Brun T. Corkey B.E. Saha A.K. Prentki M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), it was shown that long term exposure of β-INS cells to elevated glucose concentration increased anaplerosis, lipogenesis, and lipogenic gene expression. To check if an increase in apoptosis of β-cells, caused by lowering of glucose from 11 to 5.5 mm, can be overcome by other metabolic fuels such as fatty acids, experiments involving the addition of 0.25 mm palmitate and 0.125 mmoleate to the culture medium containing 5.5 mm glucose were done. The results obtained show that this mixture of free fatty acids did not significantly affect the number of apoptotic β-cells (Fig.5 A). As mentioned above, glucose-induced apoptosis of β-cells is a Ca2+-dependent process. In this context, we were interested in investigating whether there were any differences in the pattern of [Ca2+]i changes at the control glucose concentration of 11 mm and at 17 mm of the sugar (Fig. 6, TableI). The results show that elevation in glucose concentration from 3 mm to 11 and 17 mmdid not significantly affect the maximal increase in [Ca2+]i (ΔR max). However, the average level of [Ca2+]i at 10 min after the addition of glucose (ΔR 10) as well as the area under the curve for 10 min were significantly higher at 17 mm than at 11 mm glucose. Besides that, more than half of the β-cells stimulated by 11 mm glucose had pronounced oscillations in [Ca2+]i. At 17 mm glucose, less than 30% β-cells were oscillating, and the oscillatory pattern was less pronounced. At basal glucose concentration (3 mm) there were practically no oscillations at all in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 6). Preincubation of β-cells for 40 h at 17 mm glucose decreased the percentage of cells responding with an increase in [Ca2+]i at 17 mm glucose compared with β-cells preincubated at 11 mm glucose, 72.4 ± 8.8 (n = 5) and 91.7 ± 4.4% (n = 11), respectively (p < 0.05).Table IComparison of the kinetic parameters of [Ca2+]iincrease after stimulation with 11 and 17 mm glucoseGlucosenΔR maxΔR 10AUC10% of oscillating β-cells11 mm140.93 ± 0.080.36 ± 0.04ap < 0.05 vs. 17 mm glucose.100 ± 3.5bp < 0.001 vs. 17 mmglucose.5717 mm731.03 ± 0.080.63 ± 0.05122 ± 4.629Parameters are described in Fig. 6 and presented as the mean ±S.E.

Tolb, tolbutamide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The aim of the present study was to investigate whether insulin secretagoges such as glucose and antidiabetic sulfonylurea compounds can induce β-cells apoptosis. Our study shows that glucose induces apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells from ob/ob mice as wells as normal Wistar rats in vitro. The fact that the endonuclease inhibitor ATA inhibited β-cell toxicity induced by 17 or 27 mm glucose further supports the hypothesis that β-cells were dying by an apoptotic process. An interesting notion is that there was no direct correlation between the β-cell apoptosis and glucose concentration. An increase in glucose concentration from 3 to 11 mm even promoted survival of β-cells. However, further elevation of glucose concentration increased β-cell apoptosis. Hence, RPMI 1640 medium with 11 mm glucose is optimal for culturing of pancreatic β-cells, these results being in agreement with previous studies (26Andersson A. Diabetologia. 1978; 14: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 27Davalli A.M. Bertuzzi F. Socci C. Scaglia L. Gavazzi F. Freschi M. DiCarlo V. Pontiroli A.E. Pozza G. Transplantation. 1993; 56: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have also detected more cells dying by apoptosis after culturing in medium with 17 mm compared with 27 mm glucose. The reason for this is not clear and needs further investigations. One possibility is that at 27 mm glucose there are more cells dying by necrotic cell death, which is not associated with the typical ladder-like DNA fragmentation. Experiments with ATA (Fig. 5 C) favor this suggestion. As pointed out above, 11 mm glucose protected the β-cell from apoptosis. We were not able to detect apoptotic changes by gel electrophoresis in pancreatic islets incubated in medium with 11 mm glucose. However, we observed a small percentage of apoptotic cells when dispersed β-cells were cultured under the same conditions and apoptotic changes were evaluated by TUNEL technique. There are two explanations for the difference in the results obtained. First, techniques using fluorescent dyes are more sensitive, allowing the detection of apoptotic events before DNA fragments become detectable with DNA laddering technique. Second, islet β-cells are likely to be more resistant than dispersed cells to the induction of apoptotic changes. Hoorens et al. (28Hoorens A. Van de Casteele M. Klöppel G. Pipeleers D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) have reported that an increase in glucose concentration from 3 to 10 mm promoted the survival of human pancreatic islets in a serum-free medium, the results explained by activating synthesis of proteins that suppress a constitutive apoptotic program at elevated glucose. These data are in accordance with our findings. However, in their study there was no significant difference in the rate of cell death when glucose concentration was increased from 10 to 20 mm. The disagreement between our finding of increased apoptosis at glucose concentrations higher than 11 mm and that of Hoorenset al. (28Hoorens A. Van de Casteele M. Klöppel G. Pipeleers D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) may be explained by differences in culture conditions: 40 h in serum-containing medium in our studyversus 8 days in serum-free medium in their study and the source of pancreatic islets. Ca2+ often plays an important role in the regulation of the apoptotic process (19Orrenius S. McConkey D.J. Bellomo G. Nicotera P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 281-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 20McConkey D.J. Orrenius S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Sustained [Ca2+]iincreases can promote endonuclease activation (29Zhivotovsky B. Cedervall B. Jiang S. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and apoptotic cell death in several cell systems (19Orrenius S. McConkey D.J. Bellomo G. Nicotera P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 281-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 20McConkey D.J. Orrenius S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

On the contrary, in other cell systems Ca2+ appears not to be directly involved in the apoptotic process, and in some systems an increase in [Ca2+]i can even block apoptosis (31Whyte M.K.B. Hardwick S.J. Meagher L.C. Savill J.S. Haslett C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The information on the role of Ca2+ in apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells is rather limited. In a previous study we demonstrated that serum from patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus can activate Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, resulting in the β-cell destruction by apoptosis (22Juntti-Berggren L. Larsson O. Rorsman P. Ämmälä C. Bokvist K. Wahlander K. Nicotera P. Dypbukt J. Orrenius S. Hallberg A. Berggren P.O. Science. 1993; 261: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In the present study we have shown that high glucose concentration and tolbutamide induced apoptosis in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Moreover, we have shown that blocking of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels by diazoxide-induced repolarization and by D-600 inhibited apoptosis induced by both high glucose concentration and tolbutamide. It was suggested earlier that oscillations in [Ca2+]i may protect against the toxic effects of elevated [Ca2+]i in cells (32Berridge M.J. Galione A. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 3074-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 33Berridge M.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 98: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have compared the pattern of [Ca2+]i handling in pancreatic β-cells at different glucose concentrations with the effect of the sugar on β-cell survival. The obtained data show that the absence of oscillations in [Ca2+]i at 3 mm glucose and the rather low percentage of oscillations at 17 mm glucose correlate with the increased percentage of dead cells at these glucose concentrations. Noteworthy is that the majority of β-cells oscillate at the control glucose concentration of 11 mm. Although these are interesting findings, it is too early to state that oscillations in [Ca2+]iindeed protect the β-cell against glucose-induced apoptosis. Although our study suggests a role for Ca2+ in apoptosis induced by high glucose concentration and tolbutamide, the reason for the increased number of apoptotic β-cells at low glucose concentration (3 and 5.5 mm) still remains unclear. However, experiments with diazoxide and D-600 show that at these concentrations of glucose the β-cell apoptosis is not dependent on Ca2+ influx into the cell. The increased rate of β-cell apoptosis at 5.5 mm glucose relative to that of 11 mm glucose is not likely to be accounted for by lack of metabolic fuels, because the addition of free fatty acids to the medium containing 5.5 mm glucose did not overcome apoptosis. These data correspond to what has previously been found by others concerning β-cell survival (26Andersson A. Diabetologia. 1978; 14: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 27Davalli A.M. Bertuzzi F. Socci C. Scaglia L. Gavazzi F. Freschi M. DiCarlo V. Pontiroli A.E. Pozza G. Transplantation. 1993; 56: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Hoorens A. Van de Casteele M. Klöppel G. Pipeleers D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Why is it that the survival of β-cells at 5.5 mm glucose, a concentration that the β-cell should normally encounter in vivo, is less than at 11 mm glucose? The reason for this is unclear but probably reflects the difference in signaling pathways activated in vitro and in vivo. Under in vivo conditions a number of receptor agonists work in synchrony with glucose, giving rise to a complex signaling pattern, maybe not only leading to activation of insulin biosynthesis and secretion but also to the formation of one or several survival factors protecting the β-cell from apoptosis (28Hoorens A. Van de Casteele M. Klöppel G. Pipeleers D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The majority of the results obtained in this study were obtained using preparations of pancreatic islets and β-cells from ob/ob mice. Nevertheless, experiments using pancreatic β-cells from normal Wistar rats showed the same increase in β-cell apoptosis after elevation of glucose from 11 to 17 mm or addition of tolbutamide, indicating that this is a general phenomenon and not restricted to the ob/ob mouse. We have shown that both a high glucose concentration and the sulfonylurea tolbutamide trigger apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells. Our data favor the view that glucose- and tolbutamide-induced apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells are Ca2+-dependent processes."

The GM3-enriched subfraction, separated by anti-GM3 monoclonal antibody DH2, contained sphingomyelin, cholesterol, c-Src, and Rho A but not caveolin. In contrast, the caveolin-containing subfraction, separated by anti-caveolin antibody, contained neither GM3, c-Src, nor Rho A but did contain glucosylceramide, Ras, a very small quantity of sphingomyelin, and a very large quantity of cholesterol. The GM3/c-Src-enriched membrane subfraction was characterized by (i) maintenance of GM3-dependent adhesion and (ii) susceptibility to being activated for signal transduction through GM3. 32P-Phosphorylation of c-Src (Mr 60,000) together with two other components (Mr 45,000 and 29,000) was enhanced in the fraction bound to dishes coated with asialo-GM2 (Gg3) or with anti-GM3 monoclonal antibody DH2, detected by incubation with [gamma-32P]ATP at 37 degreesC for 5 min. GM3-dependent adhesion of B16 cells to Gg3-coated dishes and associated signaling were not reduced or abolished in the presence of either filipin or nystatin, which are cholesterol-binding reagents known to abolish caveolae structure and function. B16 melanoma cells incubated with filipin (0.16-0.3 micrograms/ml) or with nystatin (25 micrograms/ml) for 30 min showed depletion of cholesterol in detergent-insoluble membrane fraction but were still capable of binding to Gg3-coated plate and capable of the associated signaling. Thus, the GM3-enriched subfraction, involved in cell adhesion and capable of sending signals through GM3, represents a membrane distinguishable from caveolin-containing subfraction or caveolae. This microdomain is hereby termed the glycosphingolipid signaling domain or glycosignaling domain."

A regulator of apoptosis, Apaf-1, binds to and activates pro-casp9 in the presence of cytochrome c and dATP, a requirement that is bypassed by deletion of the WD-40 repeats located in the C-terminal half of Apaf-1. In this report, we used constitutively active Apaf-1 mutant lacking the WD-40 repeat region to study the mechanism and regulation of pro-casp9 activation. Mutational analysis revealed that only a small portion of the CED-4 homologous region (residues 456–559) could be deleted without destroying the ability of Apaf-1-(1–559) to activate pro-casp9. Apaf-1 can self-associate to form oligomers. Disruption of Apaf-1 self-association by deletion (Δ109–559) or mutation of the P-loop region (K149R) abrogated Apaf-1-mediated pro-casp9 activation.

A family of cysteine proteases (designated caspases) related to Caenorhabditis elegansCED-3 appears to represent the executionary arm of the apoptotic program. Each caspase contains conserved residues important for specific proteolytic activity cleaving substrates after aspartate residues (7Alnemri E.S. J. Cell.

The apoptotic process is characterized by sequential activation of multiple caspases. Depending on their order of activation in the proteolytic cascade, caspases can be divided into upstream and downstream caspases. The casp9 protein is an upstream caspase that contains a caspase recruit domain (CARD) in its N terminus, a region that is also present in the prodomain of several death proteases including CED-3, casp1, and casp2 (12Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Activation of casp9 initiates a protease cascade with subsequent activation of downstream casp3 and casp7, leading to cleavage of target proteins and execution of the apoptotic program (13Li P.

Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar). The N-terminal half of Apaf-1 shares extensive homology with CED-4 and contains a CARD followed by a putative ATPase domain with conserved Walker's A and B motifs (20Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar,21Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4220) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of Apaf-1 lacks homology with CED-4 and is composed of 12 WD-40 repeats (20Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar). In the presence of cytochromec and dATP, Apaf-1 adopts a conformation that can bind to pro-casp9, an event that leads to its proteolytic activation (13Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanism by which Apaf-1 regulates the proteolysis of pro-casp9.In the present studies, we sought to understand how Apaf-1 promotes the maturation of pro-casp9 into an active protease, and to establish a role for the WD-40 repeat region (WDR) in the regulation of Apaf-1. We show that Apaf-1 can self-associate and its self-association can promote the proteolytic maturation of pro-casp9. Similarly, we show that forced dimerization of pro-casp9 was sufficient for induction of pro-casp9 activation, suggesting that self-association of Apaf-1 promotes casp9 activation by bringing two or more pro-casp9 molecules into close proximity. We also show that WDR disrupts Apaf-1 self-association, providing a mechanism by which WDR negatively regulates Apaf-1-mediated casp9 activation.DISCUSSIONIn the current study, we demonstrate that Apaf-1-(1–559) can self-associate and that forced self-association of Apaf-1 can trigger pro-casp9 autoactivation. These results confirm a recent report that was published while our work was in preparation (27Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). In addition, we mapped the Apaf-1 self-association domain to a region between amino acids 109–328, and provide evidence that WDR can regulate Apaf-1 self-association and pro-casp9 activation. Together, these results suggest that Apaf-1 self-association might be critical for pro-casp9 activation, as dimerization of pro-casp9 can trigger the proteolytic cleavage of pro-casp9 (Ref. 27Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar and this report). These observations suggest a model for pro-casp9 activation in which Apaf-1 self-association brings into close proximity two or more molecules of pro-casp9, an event that might be sufficient for pro-casp9 autoprocessing and activation. A similar model has been proposed for activation of casp1, casp3 and casp8 (23MacCorkle R.A. Freeman K.W. Spencer D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the N-terminal region of Apaf-1 containing the CARD and CED-4 homologous region can promote pro-casp9 processing in the absence of dATP (22Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Wu D. Inohara N. Núñez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 27Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). In addition, we have found that a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP fails to inhibit Apaf-1-(1–559)-mediated pro-casp9 processing, providing further evidence that ATP or dATP hydrolysis is not required for Apaf-1-(1–559) to activate pro-casp9.2 However, an Apaf-1 P-loop mutant, Apaf-1-(1–530K149R), has been shown to promote pro-casp9 processing (27Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Although the reason for this discrepant result is unclear, it could be explained by the use of different systems. Whereas the other group employed purified recombinant Apaf-1 proteins expressed in Escherichia coli, we expressed Apaf-1 mutants in mammalian cells and used their extracts to assess the activation of pro-caspase-9. A possible explanation is that aggregation of E. coli Apaf-1 mutant protein might have bypassed the requirement for self-association, a process that we have shown is P-loop-dependent. An important role for the P-loop in Apaf-1 function is also suggested by the observation that similar mutations in CED-4 disrupt its ability to induce chromatin condensation in yeast and CED-3 processing in both insect and mammalian cells (18Seshagiri S. Miller L.K. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 455-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Chinnaiyan A.M. Chaudhary D. O'Rourke K. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 728-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 26James C. Gschmeissner S. Fraser A. Evan G.I. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 246-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence that mutants with substitutions of the conserved Lys residue of the P-loop, which is critical for binding to γ-phosphate, fail to bind Apaf-1-(1–559) and to activate pro-casp9. These seemingly conflicting results suggest that, in addition to contributing to dATP binding or hydrolysis, the P-loop region might be involved in the formation of the self-association surface. Such a role for the P-loop is consistent with our observation that substitution of the conserved Lys149 with several amino acids disrupts Apaf-1-(1–559) self-association. Alternatively, mutation of the P-loop could subtly change the conformation of Apaf-1 and therefore affect its ability to self-associate and to activate pro-casp9. Molecular modeling analysis has suggested that the dATP-binding pocket of Apaf-1 is formed from sequences across the CED-4 homologous region including the Walker A and B motifs (31Cardozo T.J. Abagyan R. J. Mol. Model. 1998; 4: 83-93Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The proposed structural role for the P-loop is in agreement with observations that nucleotide-binding pockets of many proteins are precisely formed from regions widely scattered throughout their primary sequences and sensitive to mutations (32de Vos A.M. Tong L. Milburn M.V. Matias P.M. Jancarik J. Noguchi S. Nishimura S. Miura K. Ohtsuka E. Kim S.H. Science. 1988; 239: 888-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 33Dreusicke D. Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 34Reinstein J. Schlichting I. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7451-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Then, what is the role of dATP hydrolysis in Apaf-1 function? One possible model is that dATP hydrolysis and/or cytochrome c binding are required to overcome the inhibitory effect of the WD-40 repeats (see below). Alternatively, dATP hydrolysis could provide energy for conformational changes that are required to promote the release of processed casp9. This hypothesis is consistent with a recent report showing that processed casp9 activated by an N-terminal constitutive Apaf-1 was unable to process casp3 (27Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar).Previous studies suggested that WDR of Apaf-1 plays an inhibitory role in Apaf-1 function, as deletion of these repeats results in a constitutively active Apaf-1 protein (22Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Wu D. Inohara N. Núñez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). However, the basis for such an inhibitory role in the regulation of Apaf-1 remained unknown. We provide evidence that WDR can associate with the N-terminal region of Apaf-1 and that its expression abrogates Apaf-1-(1–559) self-association. Because self-association of Apaf-1-(1–559) can trigger pro-casp9 activation, these studies suggest a mechanism whereby WDR negatively regulates the activation of pro-casp9. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that expression of WDR (residues 468–1194) inhibits the maturation of pro-casp9 promoted by Apaf-1-(1–559). The precise mechanism by which WDR inhibit Apaf-1-(1–559) self-association needs to be established. WDR might directly compete with N-terminal Apaf-1 for binding to the self-association domain (residues 109–328) and/or alternatively it might inhibit the Apaf-1-(1–559)–Apaf-1-(1–559) interaction by steric hindrance or another mechanism. Based on our studies, it is tempting to speculate that binding of cytochrome c and/or dATP hydrolysis induces a conformational change from a “closed conformation,” in which the N-terminal region of Apaf-1 is in contact with WDR, to an “open conformation,” in which WDR-Apaf-1 interaction is disrupted so that Apaf-1 can oligomerize via its N-terminal interaction domain. This open conformation promoted by cytochrome c and/or dATP hydrolysis might enable Apaf-1 to bind multiple pro-casp9 molecules and to promote pro-casp9 autoprocessing. WD-40 repeats are present in a variety of proteins with diverse functions and have been proposed to play a regulatory role (35Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Apaf-1 self-association by WDR of Apaf-1 is consistent with such a role in Apaf-1 function. Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, an evolutionarily conserved and genetically regulated biological process, plays a critical role in development and tissue homeostasis of multicellular organisms (1Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 2Yuan J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 3White E.

Dysfunction of this process contributes to the pathogenesis of several diseases in humans and mice (4Thompson C.B.

A family of cysteine proteases (designated caspases) related to Caenorhabditis elegansCED-3 appears to represent the executionary arm of the apoptotic program. Each caspase contains conserved residues important for specific proteolytic activity cleaving substrates after aspartate residues (7Alnemri E.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 8Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4103) Google Scholar, 9Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). Caspases are synthesized in cells as inactive zymogens and, upon stimulation with apoptotic signals, are processed into mature forms composed of a tetramer of two large and two small subunits (10Walker N.P. Talanian R.V. Brady K.D. Dang L.C. Bump N.J. Ferenz C.R. Franklin S. Ghayur T. Hackett M.C.

Ruel R. Vaillancourt J.P. Thornberry N.A. Becker J.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The apoptotic process is characterized by sequential activation of multiple caspases. Depending on their order of activation in the proteolytic cascade, caspases can be divided into upstream and downstream caspases. The casp9 protein is an upstream caspase that contains a caspase recruit domain (CARD) in its N terminus, a region that is also present in the prodomain of several death proteases including CED-3, casp1, and casp2 (12Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Activation of casp9 initiates a protease cascade with subsequent activation of downstream casp3 and casp7, leading to cleavage of target proteins and execution of the apoptotic program (13Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Our understanding of how caspases are activated in mammalian cells has been greatly enhanced by recent biochemical studies of the nematode proteins CED-3, CED-4, and CED-9 (14Wu D. Wallen H.D.

Here, we provide evidence that mutants with substitutions of the conserved Lys residue of the P-loop, which is critical for binding to γ-phosphate, fail to bind Apaf-1-(1–559) and to activate pro-casp9. These seemingly conflicting results suggest that, in addition to contributing to dATP binding or hydrolysis, the P-loop region might be involved in the formation of the self-association surface. Such a role for the P-loop is consistent with our observation that substitution of the conserved Lys149 with several amino acids disrupts Apaf-1-(1–559) self-association. Alternatively, mutation of the P-loop could subtly change the conformation of Apaf-1 and therefore affect its ability to self-associate and to activate pro-casp9. Molecular modeling analysis has suggested that the dATP-binding pocket of Apaf-1 is formed from sequences across the CED-4 homologous region including the Walker A and B motifs (31Cardozo T.J. Abagyan R. J. Mol. Model. 1998; 4: 83-93Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The proposed structural role for the P-loop is in agreement with observations that nucleotide-binding pockets of many proteins are precisely formed from regions widely scattered throughout their primary sequences and sensitive to mutations (32de Vos A.M. Tong L. Milburn M.V. Matias P.M. Jancarik J. Noguchi S. Nishimura S. Miura K. Ohtsuka E. Kim S.H. Science. 1988; 239: 888-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 33Dreusicke D. Karplus P.A.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7451-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Then, what is the role of dATP hydrolysis in Apaf-1 function? One possible model is that dATP hydrolysis and/or cytochrome c binding are required to overcome the inhibitory effect of the WD-40 repeats (see below). Alternatively, dATP hydrolysis could provide energy for conformational changes that are required to promote the release of processed casp9. This hypothesis is consistent with a recent report showing that processed casp9 activated by an N-terminal constitutive Apaf-1 was unable to process casp3 (27Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar).Previous studies suggested that WDR of Apaf-1 plays an inhibitory role in Apaf-1 function, as deletion of these repeats results in a constitutively active Apaf-1 protein (22Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Wu D. Inohara N. Núñez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). However, the basis for such an inhibitory role in the regulation of Apaf-1 remained unknown. We provide evidence that WDR can associate with the N-terminal region of Apaf-1 and that its expression abrogates Apaf-1-(1–559) self-association. Because self-association of Apaf-1-(1–559) can trigger pro-casp9 activation, these studies suggest a mechanism whereby WDR negatively regulates the activation of pro-casp9. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that expression of WDR (residues 468–1194) inhibits the maturation of pro-casp9 promoted by Apaf-1-(1–559). The precise mechanism by which WDR inhibit Apaf-1-(1–559) self-association needs to be established. WDR might directly compete with N-terminal Apaf-1 for binding to the self-association domain (residues 109–328) and/or alternatively it might inhibit the Apaf-1-(1–559)–Apaf-1-(1–559) interaction by steric hindrance or another mechanism. Based on our studies, it is tempting to speculate that binding of cytochrome c and/or dATP hydrolysis induces a conformational change from a “closed conformation,” in which the N-terminal region of Apaf-1 is in contact with WDR, to an “open conformation,” in which WDR-Apaf-1 interaction is disrupted so that Apaf-1 can oligomerize via its N-terminal interaction domain. This open conformation promoted by cytochrome c and/or dATP hydrolysis might enable Apaf-1 to bind multiple pro-casp9 molecules and to promote pro-casp9 autoprocessing. WD-40 repeats are present in a variety of proteins with diverse functions and have been proposed to play a regulatory role (35Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Apaf-1 self-association by WDR of Apaf-1 is consistent with such a role in Apaf-1 function. In the current study, we demonstrate that Apaf-1-(1–559) can self-associate and that forced self-association of Apaf-1 can trigger pro-casp9 autoactivation. These results confirm a recent report that was published while our work was in preparation (27Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). In addition, we mapped the Apaf-1 self-association domain to a region between amino acids 109–328, and provide evidence that WDR can regulate Apaf-1 self-association and pro-casp9 activation. Together, these results suggest that Apaf-1 self-association might be critical for pro-casp9 activation, as dimerization of pro-casp9 can trigger the proteolytic cleavage of pro-casp9 (Ref. 27Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar and this report). These observations suggest a model for pro-casp9 activation in which Apaf-1 self-association brings into close proximity two or more molecules of pro-casp9, an event that might be sufficient for pro-casp9 autoprocessing and activation. A similar model has been proposed for activation of casp1, casp3 and casp8 (23MacCorkle R.A. Freeman K.W. Spencer D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3655-3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 28Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4345-4349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), suggesting that the basic mechanism of activation for caspases might be conserved. dATP or ATP hydrolysis is required for the activation of pro-casp9 by full-length Apaf-1 (13Li P.

However, the N-terminal region of Apaf-1 containing the CARD and CED-4 homologous region can promote pro-casp9 processing in the absence of dATP (22Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Wu D. Inohara N. Núñez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 27Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). In addition, we have found that a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP fails to inhibit Apaf-1-(1–559)-mediated pro-casp9 processing, providing further evidence that ATP or dATP hydrolysis is not required for Apaf-1-(1–559) to activate pro-casp9.2 However, an Apaf-1 P-loop mutant, Apaf-1-(1–530K149R), has been shown to promote pro-casp9 processing (27Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Although the reason for this discrepant result is unclear, it could be explained by the use of different systems. Whereas the other group employed purified recombinant Apaf-1 proteins expressed in Escherichia coli, we expressed Apaf-1 mutants in mammalian cells and used their extracts to assess the activation of pro-caspase-9. A possible explanation is that aggregation of E. coli Apaf-1 mutant protein might have bypassed the requirement for self-association, a process that we have shown is P-loop-dependent. An important role for the P-loop in Apaf-1 function is also suggested by the observation that similar mutations in CED-4 disrupt its ability to induce chromatin condensation in yeast and CED-3 processing in both insect and mammalian cells (18Seshagiri S. Miller L.K. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 455-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Chinnaiyan A.M. Chaudhary D. O'Rourke K. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M.

Cell-specific markers have been well characterized for in situ analysis, and methods are established for obtaining pure isolates of both parenchymal and nonparenchymal cell types.

We previously documented induction of TGF-β receptors types I, II, and III during stellate cell activation in vivoand in culture (19Friedman S.L. Yamasaki G. Wong L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10551-10558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor induction in culture was paralleled by increased TGF-β1 binding and enhanced fibronectin gene expression in response to TGF-β1.Increased fibrogenesis is only one of many phenotypic responses characterizing hepatic stellate cell activation. To define more broadly the nature of gene induction during this event, we used subtraction cloning to identify mRNAs up-regulated rapidly after acute injury (20Lalazar A. Wong L. Yamasaki G. Friedman S.L. Gene. 1997; 195: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this approach identified the type II TGF-β receptor among the induced mRNAs. Another mRNA encoded a novel zinc finger partial cDNA; full-length cloning identified a Kruppel-like factor that we have termed Zf9 (21Ratziu V. Lalazar A. Wong L. Dang Q. Collins C. Shaulian E.

The immediate-early induction of Zf9/CPBP prior to up-regulation of TGF-β1 and its receptors is consistent with the possible role of Zf9/CPBP in this response (20Lalazar A. Wong L. Yamasaki G. Friedman S.L. Gene. 1997; 195: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Ratziu V. Lalazar A. Wong L. Dang Q. Collins C. Shaulian E. Jensen S. Friedman S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9500-9505Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).Both nuclear extracts from activated stellate cells and recombinant Zf9-GST interact with GC-rich regions within the TGF-β1 promoter. The potential importance of GC-rich regions in this promoter has been emphasized in our earlier publication (28Kim S.J. Glick A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 402-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have documented strong interaction of Zf9-GST with the tandem Sp1 binding sites between −239 and −209, less interaction with a fragment from −124 to −98, and minimal interaction with a single Sp1 site from −82 to −63. This EMSA pattern corresponds very closely with the promoter requirements for Zf9 transactivation in both stellate cells and Hep G2. Moreover, the binding affinity of nuclear extracts from stellate cell to the tandem Sp1 consensus oligo from −124 to −98 (TGFβ1/2) is proportional to the state of cellular activation, with far more nuclear binding in highly activated, immortalized cells than in primary cells. Transactivation of TGF-β1 by Zf9 occurs both in mammalian cells (stellate cells and Hep G2) andDrosophila cells, which lack Sp1.We have also documented transactivation of the key signaling receptors for TGF-β1 by Zf9. Within mammalian (Hep G2) cells, transactivation is functionally linked to the presence of key GC-rich regions from −360 to −349 and from −179 to −151 and correlates with interaction between recombinant Zf9-GST and each of these regions. Similarly, transactivation of the TGF-β1 type II receptor promoter requires the presence of GC-rich regions from −152 to −127 and from −118 to −85. Zf9-GST did not bind to a third Sp1 site from −39 to −10, which correlated with a lack of transactivation of a reporter-luciferase construct containing a region from −70 to +36.In contrast to the TGF-β1 promoter, however, transactivation of TGF-β types I and II receptor genes by Zf9 occurred only in a mammalian cellular environment (Hep G2) and not inDrosophila. This finding underscores the unique requirements for each promoter in driving gene expression and raises the possibility that Sp1 is an essential component required for Zf9-mediated transactivation of the TGF-β types I and II receptors. This conclusion is based on several lines of evidence: 1) Sp1 is absent fromDrosophila Schneider cells; 2) both this study and previous analyses by Ji et al. (37Ji C. Casinghino S. McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21260-21267Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and us (31Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) emphasize the importance of Sp1 binding sites for basal and stimulated expression of the type I receptor promoter; and 3) Zf9 and Sp1 can functionally synergize with one another in several promoter contexts (38Ratziu R. Kim S.J. Kim Y.S. Dang S. Wong L. Friedman S.L. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 185AGoogle Scholar). It also remains possible that Zf9 may interact with other members of the Kruppel-like family of transcriptional proteins, as has been demonstrated for EKLF and Sp1 (39Gregory R.C. Taxman D.J. Seshasayee D. Kensinger M.H. Bieker J.J. Wojchowski D.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Cooperation between Sp1 and Zf9 in the transcriptional activation of TGF-β1 during stellate cell activation is therefore possible. Not only is Zf9 induced (21Ratziu V. Lalazar A. Wong L. Dang Q. Collins C. Shaulian E. Jensen S. Friedman S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9500-9505Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), but there is also increased Sp1 protein and enhanced binding of stellate cell nuclear extracts during stellate cell activation (40Rippe R.A. Almounajed G. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 241-251PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the cognate sequences recognized by Zf9 are similar to Sp1, the cellular factors required for transactivation by each protein are different, as evidenced by differing activities in Drosophila Schneider cells. In preliminary studies, we have confirmed direct interaction between these two proteins (data not shown). Interestingly, in this earlier study examining Sp1 binding in activated stellate cells (40Rippe R.A. Almounajed G. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 241-251PubMed Google Scholar), a significant amount of nuclear protein that bound to an Sp1 consensus sequence did not supershift with anti-Sp1 antibody. This suggests that other GC box-binding proteins may be present in activated stellate cells, including not only Zf9, but possibly BKLF (25Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), LKLF (26Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell.

(Tokyo). 1993; 114: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), all of which are expressed in liver.These data provide a potentially important link in stellate cells between induction of a transcriptional activator, Zf9, and increased expression of TGF-β1, a key fibrogenic mediator. TGF-β1 induces a large number of matrix genes in stellate cells (17Bachem M.G. Meyer D. Melchior R. Sell K.M. Gressner A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 41Bedossa P. Paradis V. J. Hepatol. 1995; 22 Suppl. 2: 37-42Google Scholar, 42Rosenbaum J. Blazejewski S. Preaux A.M. Mallat A.

Hepatology. 1996; 24: 352-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as in other tissues. The findings further suggest that Zf9 may enhance by the biologic effect of TGF-β1 in vivo not only by transcriptional induction of the gene but also by up-regulation of type I and II TGF-β receptors. This finding may contribute to the increased expression of these receptors during stellate cell activationin vivo and in culture (19Friedman S.L. Yamasaki G. Wong L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10551-10558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas transcriptional induction of TGF-β receptors may explain a key mechanism underlying enhanced fibrogenesis, intracellular signaling events downstream of TGF-β1 signaling are only beginning to be understood (44Kretzschmar M. Massague J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 45Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). In particular, little is known regarding signaling pathways in stellate cells apart from a single study documenting activation of Ras, Raf, MEK, and MAPK (46Reimann T. Hempel U. Krautwald S. Axmann A. Scheibe R. Seidel D. Wenzel K.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).In summary, our data suggest that Zf9/CPBP, a recently described Kruppel-like factor that is rapidly induced following liver injury (21Ratziu V. Lalazar A. Wong L. Dang Q. Collins C. Shaulian E. Jensen S. Friedman S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9500-9505Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), can transcriptionally activate TGF-β1 and its receptors. These findings suggest that Zf9/CPBP may contribute to TGF-β1-mediated autocrine fibrogenesis in stellate cells during liver injury. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) 1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; HSC, hepatic stellate cell; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; RI, type I receptor; RII, type II receptor; RIP, type I receptor promoter; RIIP, type II receptor promoter; luc, luciferase; CPBP, core promoter-binding protein. 1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; HSC, hepatic stellate cell; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; RI, type I receptor; RII, type II receptor; RIP, type I receptor promoter; RIIP, type II receptor promoter; luc, luciferase; CPBP, core promoter-binding protein. is a multifunctional cytokine that plays a key role in the response to injury in a wide variety of tissues (1Border W.A. Noble N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1286-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (2994) Google Scholar). Increased TGF-β1 activity underlies the wound-healing response in kidney (2Border W.A. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1994; 3: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), lung (2Border W.A. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1994; 3: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and vascular tissue (3Saltis J. Agrotis A. Bobik A. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol.

Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), among others. The liver offers a particularly attractive paradigm in which to explore the role of TGF-β1 in tissue fibrosis. Cell-specific markers have been well characterized for in situ analysis, and methods are established for obtaining pure isolates of both parenchymal and nonparenchymal cell types. Such studies conclusively establish hepatic stellate cells as the primary source of extracellular matrix in liver fibrosis and a major cellular target of TGF-β1 (5Friedman S.L. Prog. Liver Dis. 1996; 14: 101-130PubMed Google Scholar, 6Friedman S.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Downstream effects of TGF-β1 in stellate cells include stimulation of matrix gene expression (7Weiner F.R. Giambrone M.A. Czaja M.J. Shah A. Annoni G. Takahashi S. Eghbali M. Zern M.A. Hepatology. 1990; 11: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), up-regulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor (8Knittel T. Fellmer P. Ramadori G. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 745-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and receptors for platelet-derived growth factor (9Pinzani M. Gentilini A. Caligiuri A. De F.R. Pellegrini G. Milani S. Marra F. Gentilini P. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 232-239PubMed Google Scholar), and suppression of collagenase synthesis (10Okuno M. Moriwaki H. Imai S. Muto Y. Kawada N. Suzuki Y. Kojima S. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 913-921PubMed Google Scholar). A role for TGF-β1 in vivo is further emphasized by the development of severe hepatic fibrosis in transgenic mice overexpressing the cytokine in liver cells (11Clouthier D.E. Comerford S.A. Hammer R.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2697-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Both in situ studies (12Milani S. Herbst H. Schuppan D. Stein H. Surrenti C. Am. J.

Hepatology. 1990; 11: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) have also established hepatic stellate cells (previously called lipocytes, Ito, or fat-storing cells) as a major source of TGF-β1. Marked up-regulation of TGF-β1 gene expression and activation of latent cytokine are consistent features of both human (16Castilla A. Prieto J. Fausto N. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) and experimental (14Bissell D.M. Wang S.S. Jarnagin W.R. Roll F.J. J. Clin.

Hepatol. 1997; 26: 886-893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) liver injury. Increased activity of TGF-β1 during hepatic stellate cell activation reflects not only up-regulation and activation of the cytokine but also enhanced responsiveness to TGF-β1 due to increased TGF-β receptor expression. We previously documented induction of TGF-β receptors types I, II, and III during stellate cell activation in vivoand in culture (19Friedman S.L. Yamasaki G. Wong L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10551-10558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor induction in culture was paralleled by increased TGF-β1 binding and enhanced fibronectin gene expression in response to TGF-β1. Increased fibrogenesis is only one of many phenotypic responses characterizing hepatic stellate cell activation. To define more broadly the nature of gene induction during this event, we used subtraction cloning to identify mRNAs up-regulated rapidly after acute injury (20Lalazar A. Wong L. Yamasaki G. Friedman S.L. Gene. 1997; 195: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this approach identified the type II TGF-β receptor among the induced mRNAs. Another mRNA encoded a novel zinc finger partial cDNA; full-length cloning identified a Kruppel-like factor that we have termed Zf9 (21Ratziu V. Lalazar A. Wong L. Dang Q. Collins C. Shaulian E. Jensen S. Friedman S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9500-9505Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), which was also cloned from placenta, where it was termed CPBP (22Koritschoner N.P. Bocco J.L. Panzetta-Dutari G.M. Dumur C.I. Flury A. Patrito L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9573-9580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Zf9 contains three carboxyl-terminal C2H2 zinc fingers similar to other Kruppel-like factors and a serine-rich activation domain with homology in the most amino-terminal 47 amino acids to a new member of the Kruppel-like family, UKLF (23Matsumoto N.

Zf9 is expressed in all adult tissues and binds GC box promoter motifs, similar to binding by other Kruppel-like factors, including EKLF (24Bieker J.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), BKLF (25Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell.

(Tokyo). 1993; 114: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Zf9 mRNA is rapidly induced during stellate cell activation in vivo and in culture, in association with nuclear localization of the protein. Most importantly, the factor transactivates a minimal collagen α1(I) promoter, which contains several GC-rich Sp1 binding sites. Our cloning and characterization of the promoters for both TGF-β1 (28Kim S.J. Glick A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Biol.

In particular, all three promoters contain GC-rich Sp1 binding sites. Such consensus sequences raise the possibility that one or more of these genes might be regulated by Zf9. In this study, we indeed demonstrate that Zf9 transactivates all three genes following transient transfection in mammalian cells, and we compare these interactions with those of Sp1, the prototype GC box-binding protein. DISCUSSIONOur results identify a potential role for the Kruppel-like factor Zf9/CPBP in the increases in TGF-β1 and its receptors which are characteristic of liver injury. A number of studies have identified TGF-β1 mRNA induction in liver injury (13Nakatsukasa H. Nagy P. Evarts R.P. Hsia C.C. Marsden E. Thorgeirsson S.S. J. Clin.

The immediate-early induction of Zf9/CPBP prior to up-regulation of TGF-β1 and its receptors is consistent with the possible role of Zf9/CPBP in this response (20Lalazar A. Wong L. Yamasaki G.

The potential importance of GC-rich regions in this promoter has been emphasized in our earlier publication (28Kim S.J. Glick A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Biol.

Similarly, transactivation of the TGF-β1 type II receptor promoter requires the presence of GC-rich regions from −152 to −127 and from −118 to −85. Zf9-GST did not bind to a third Sp1 site from −39 to −10, which correlated with a lack of transactivation of a reporter-luciferase construct containing a region from −70 to +36.In contrast to the TGF-β1 promoter, however, transactivation of TGF-β types I and II receptor genes by Zf9 occurred only in a mammalian cellular environment (Hep G2) and not inDrosophila.

Whereas transcriptional induction of TGF-β receptors may explain a key mechanism underlying enhanced fibrogenesis, intracellular signaling events downstream of TGF-β1 signaling are only beginning to be understood (44Kretzschmar M. Massague J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 45Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). In particular, little is known regarding signaling pathways in stellate cells apart from a single study documenting activation of Ras, Raf, MEK, and MAPK (46Reimann T. Hempel U. Krautwald S. Axmann A. Scheibe R. Seidel D. Wenzel K.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).In summary, our data suggest that Zf9/CPBP, a recently described Kruppel-like factor that is rapidly induced following liver injury (21Ratziu V. Lalazar A. Wong L. Dang Q. Collins C. Shaulian E. Jensen S. Friedman S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9500-9505Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), can transcriptionally activate TGF-β1 and its receptors. These findings suggest that Zf9/CPBP may contribute to TGF-β1-mediated autocrine fibrogenesis in stellate cells during liver injury. Our results identify a potential role for the Kruppel-like factor Zf9/CPBP in the increases in TGF-β1 and its receptors which are characteristic of liver injury. A number of studies have identified TGF-β1 mRNA induction in liver injury (13Nakatsukasa H. Nagy P. Evarts R.P. Hsia C.C. Marsden E. Thorgeirsson S.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1833-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 14Bissell D.M. Wang S.S. Jarnagin W.R. Roll F.J. J. Clin.

Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The immediate-early induction of Zf9/CPBP prior to up-regulation of TGF-β1 and its receptors is consistent with the possible role of Zf9/CPBP in this response (20Lalazar A. Wong L. Yamasaki G. Friedman S.L. Gene. 1997; 195: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Ratziu V. Lalazar A. Wong L. Dang Q. Collins C. Shaulian E. Jensen S. Friedman S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9500-9505Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Both nuclear extracts from activated stellate cells and recombinant Zf9-GST interact with GC-rich regions within the TGF-β1 promoter. The potential importance of GC-rich regions in this promoter has been emphasized in our earlier publication (28Kim S.J. Glick A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 402-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have documented strong interaction of Zf9-GST with the tandem Sp1 binding sites between −239 and −209, less interaction with a fragment from −124 to −98, and minimal interaction with a single Sp1 site from −82 to −63. This EMSA pattern corresponds very closely with the promoter requirements for Zf9 transactivation in both stellate cells and Hep G2. Moreover, the binding affinity of nuclear extracts from stellate cell to the tandem Sp1 consensus oligo from −124 to −98 (TGFβ1/2) is proportional to the state of cellular activation, with far more nuclear binding in highly activated, immortalized cells than in primary cells. Transactivation of TGF-β1 by Zf9 occurs both in mammalian cells (stellate cells and Hep G2) andDrosophila cells, which lack Sp1. We have also documented transactivation of the key signaling receptors for TGF-β1 by Zf9. Within mammalian (Hep G2) cells, transactivation is functionally linked to the presence of key GC-rich regions from −360 to −349 and from −179 to −151 and correlates with interaction between recombinant Zf9-GST and each of these regions. Similarly, transactivation of the TGF-β1 type II receptor promoter requires the presence of GC-rich regions from −152 to −127 and from −118 to −85. Zf9-GST did not bind to a third Sp1 site from −39 to −10, which correlated with a lack of transactivation of a reporter-luciferase construct containing a region from −70 to +36. In contrast to the TGF-β1 promoter, however, transactivation of TGF-β types I and II receptor genes by Zf9 occurred only in a mammalian cellular environment (Hep G2) and not inDrosophila. This finding underscores the unique requirements for each promoter in driving gene expression and raises the possibility that Sp1 is an essential component required for Zf9-mediated transactivation of the TGF-β types I and II receptors. This conclusion is based on several lines of evidence: 1) Sp1 is absent fromDrosophila Schneider cells; 2) both this study and previous analyses by Ji et al. (37Ji C. Casinghino S. McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21260-21267Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and us (31Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) emphasize the importance of Sp1 binding sites for basal and stimulated expression of the type I receptor promoter; and 3) Zf9 and Sp1 can functionally synergize with one another in several promoter contexts (38Ratziu R. Kim S.J. Kim Y.S. Dang S. Wong L. Friedman S.L. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 185AGoogle Scholar). It also remains possible that Zf9 may interact with other members of the Kruppel-like family of transcriptional proteins, as has been demonstrated for EKLF and Sp1 (39Gregory R.C. Taxman D.J. Seshasayee D. Kensinger M.H. Bieker J.J. Wojchowski D.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cooperation between Sp1 and Zf9 in the transcriptional activation of TGF-β1 during stellate cell activation is therefore possible. Not only is Zf9 induced (21Ratziu V. Lalazar A. Wong L. Dang Q. Collins C. Shaulian E. Jensen S. Friedman S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9500-9505Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), but there is also increased Sp1 protein and enhanced binding of stellate cell nuclear extracts during stellate cell activation (40Rippe R.A. Almounajed G. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 241-251PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the cognate sequences recognized by Zf9 are similar to Sp1, the cellular factors required for transactivation by each protein are different, as evidenced by differing activities in Drosophila Schneider cells. In preliminary studies, we have confirmed direct interaction between these two proteins (data not shown). Interestingly, in this earlier study examining Sp1 binding in activated stellate cells (40Rippe R.A. Almounajed G. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 241-251PubMed Google Scholar), a significant amount of nuclear protein that bound to an Sp1 consensus sequence did not supershift with anti-Sp1 antibody. This suggests that other GC box-binding proteins may be present in activated stellate cells, including not only Zf9, but possibly BKLF (25Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), LKLF (26Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell.

(Tokyo). 1993; 114: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), all of which are expressed in liver. These data provide a potentially important link in stellate cells between induction of a transcriptional activator, Zf9, and increased expression of TGF-β1, a key fibrogenic mediator. TGF-β1 induces a large number of matrix genes in stellate cells (17Bachem M.G. Meyer D. Melchior R. Sell K.M. Gressner A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 41Bedossa P. Paradis V. J. Hepatol. 1995; 22 Suppl. 2: 37-42Google Scholar, 42Rosenbaum J. Blazejewski S. Preaux A.M. Mallat A.

Hepatology. 1996; 24: 352-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as in other tissues. The findings further suggest that Zf9 may enhance by the biologic effect of TGF-β1 in vivo not only by transcriptional induction of the gene but also by up-regulation of type I and II TGF-β receptors. This finding may contribute to the increased expression of these receptors during stellate cell activationin vivo and in culture (19Friedman S.L. Yamasaki G. Wong L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10551-10558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

In summary, our data suggest that Zf9/CPBP, a recently described Kruppel-like factor that is rapidly induced following liver injury (21Ratziu V. Lalazar A. Wong L. Dang Q. Collins C. Shaulian E.

https://openalex.org/W2048127037,"Circulating leukocytes are nonadherent but bind tightly to endothelial cells following activation. The increased avidity of leukocyte integrins for endothelial ligands following activation is regulated, in part, by interaction of the β2 subunit cytoplasmic tail with the actin cytoskeleton. We propose a mechanism to explain how tethering of the actin cytoskeleton to leukocyte integrins is regulated. In resting leukocytes, β2 integrins are constitutively linked to the actin cytoskeleton via the protein talin. Activation of cells induces proteolysis of talin and dissociation from the β2 tail. This phase is transient, however, and is followed by reattachment of actin filaments to integrins that is mediated by the protein α-actinin. The association of α-actinin with integrins may stabilize the cytoskeleton and promote firm adhesion to and migration across the endothelium. Glutathione S-transferase-β2 tail fusion protein/mutagenesis experiments suggest that the affinity of α-actinin binding to the β2 tail is regulated by a change in the conformation of the tail that unmasks a cryptic α-actinin binding domain. Positive and inhibitory domains within the β2 tail regulate α-actinin binding: a single 11-amino acid region (residues 736–746) is necessary and sufficient for α-actinin binding, and a regulatory domain between residues 748–762 inhibits constitutive association of the β2 tail with α-actinin.

Integrins are heterodimeric, transmembrane adhesion molecules composed of noncovalently associated α and β subunits that physically link extracellular ligands to the cytoskeleton (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8988) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of integrin β subunits links these receptors to the actin cytoskeleton (2Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar, 3Pavalko F.M. Otey C.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1994; 205: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, actin filaments cannot bind directly to integrins. Instead, integrins are linked indirectly to actin filaments via several actin-binding proteins, including α-actinin, talin, and filamin. (4Horwitz A.F. Duggan K. Buck C. Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. Nature. 1986; 320: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 5Otey C.A. Pavalko F.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 6Pavalko F.M.

The importance of integrin-cytoskeletal linkage is demonstrated by the observation that deletion of the β subunit tail prevents association of integrins with the cytoskeleton and disrupts normal integrin-ligand interactions (reviewed in Ref. 8Williams M.J. Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ginsberg M.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 109-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Several integrins, including LFA-1 1The abbreviations used are: LFA-1, lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; FMLP, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; PMN, polymorphonuclear leukocyte; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; w.t., wild-type; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: LFA-1, lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; FMLP, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; PMN, polymorphonuclear leukocyte; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; w.t., wild-type; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. and Mac-1, share a common β2 subunit and are present exclusively on leukocytes. These leukocyte integrins mediate cell adhesion to endothelial cell ligands such as intracellular adhesion molecules (reviewed in Ref. 9Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (5845) Google Scholar). Unactivated leukocytes in the circulation are nonadherent, and LFA-1 and Mac-1, both of which are expressed constitutively on resting neutrophils, show very little, if any, binding to their physiologic ligands (10Smith C.W. Marlin S.D. Rothlein R. Toman C. Anderson D.C. J. Clin Invest. 1989; 83: 2008-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Activation of neutrophils with cytokines (leukotriene B4 and tumor necrosis factor-α), chemoattractants (FMLP), or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) results in increased binding of neutrophils to the endothelium (11Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar, 12Peter K. O'Toole T.E. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This increase results, in part, from insertion of integrins onto the cell surface, but both LFA-1 and Mac-1 also undergo a rapid change in ligand avidity as a result of activation, which involves conformational changes in their extracellular domain and a clustering of the receptors in the membrane. The association of cytoskeletal proteins with integrin cytoplasmic tails appears to play an important role in regulating intracellular signaling events that affect the conformation of integrin extracellular domains and promote integrin clustering. Several recent studies suggest that LFA-1 on lymphocytes is constrained by the actin cytoskeleton in resting cells (13Stewart M.P. McKowall A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 14Lub M. van Vliet S.J. Oomen S. Pieters R.A. Robinson M. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Mol. Biol.

Invest. 1996; 97: 2139-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and that Ca2+-mediated activation of the enzyme calpain releases LFA-1 from this constraint to allow integrin clustering upon activation (14Lub M. van Vliet S.J. Oomen S. Pieters R.A. Robinson M. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Kucik et al. (15Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.M. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2139-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that the mobility of LFA-1 in lymphocytes is increased by activation with phorbol ester. In this report, we examine the association of two cytoskeletal proteins that directly interact with β1 and β2 integrin cytoplasmic domains to learn more about how these associations may be regulated. Based on our results, we propose a model in which β2 integrins on unactivated PMNs are tethered to the actin cytoskeleton via the protein talin. Following activation, proteolysis of talin causes release of integrins from the actin cytoskeleton. This would facilitate increased integrin mobility in the membrane, increased ligand binding, and clustering of ligand occupied receptors. Following clustering, integrins reengage the cytoskeleton by binding to the actin cross-linking protein α-actinin as we have previously described (6Pavalko F.M. LaRoche S.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3795-3807PubMed Google Scholar). Results of the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein affinity binding experiments presented here suggest that the association of α-actinin with β2 integrins is regulated by conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domain that unmask the α-actinin binding site between residues 736 and 746 in the membrane proximal half of the tail that is cryptic resting cells. Our model helps explain how the cytoskeleton plays an apparent dual role in the regulation of integrin-mediated leukocyte adhesion: inhibition of adhesion in resting cells but stimulation of adhesion and motility in activated cells. Human PMNs were isolated from fresh citrate phosphate dextrose-anticoagulated blood obtained from volunteer donors using 6% dextran to sediment erythrocytes, followed by separation from lymphocytes by centrifugation in Histopaque 1077 (Sigma). The PMN pellet, which also contained monocytes, was washed in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.2% glucose and resuspended in Dulbecco's PBS with glucose at a concentration of 107 cells/ml. PMNs were activated with either 10 nmformyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) peptide (Sigma) or 50 nm PMA (Sigma). In some experiments, PMNs were preincubated in the calpain inhibitor calpeptin (Calbiochem-Novabiochem), which was prepared in Me2SO at 100 mm and diluted to a final concentration of 100 μm (36 μg/ml) in Dulbecco's PBS. Control cells were incubated in Dulbecco's PBS containing 1 μl of Me2SO/ml. PMN extracts for immunoblot analysis with anti-talin antibody 8d4 (Sigma) and for affinity binding studies were prepared by treating 107 cells with 1 ml of lysis buffer consisting of Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and the protease inhibitors aprotinin (25 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). Following extraction for 10 min on ice, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was saved. Protein concentration was determined using BCA reagent (Pierce); approximately 20 μg was loaded per lane for immunoblot analysis, and 500 μg was loaded onto GST fusion protein affinity columns. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, 5 × 106 cells were lysed in 1 ml of TBS/CHAPS buffer containing 1% CHAPS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.01% NaN3, and 20 mm DNase I and protease inhibitors aprotinin (25 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) as described previously (6Pavalko F.M. LaRoche S.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3795-3807PubMed Google Scholar). Rat embryo fibroblasts (REF-52) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2/95% air in a humidified incubator. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were plated on vitronectin-coated (10 μg/ml) or fibronectin-coated (50 μg/ml) plastic in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum for 6 h. Suspension cells were obtained by trypsinization of substrate adherent cells, which were then washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and maintained in suspension at 37 °C for 2 h to allow the cells time to recover. Extracts in TBS/CHAPS buffer were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 15,000 ×g, and 1 ml aliquots of supernatant were transferred to a fresh 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. This extract was incubated with 50 μl of a 10% w/v solution of protein A-positive Staphylococcus aureus cells in 10% CHAPS lysis buffer for 30 min at 4 °C to remove cellular proteins binding to protein A. The S. aureuscells were sedimented, and an excess of either anti-β2 mAb (KIM127 or MHM23, Dako, Inc.) or anti-β1 integrin antibody (1938, Chemicon) was added to the supernatant and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Then, 100 μl of a 10% suspension of protein A-Sepharose conjugated to rabbit anti-mouse Ig was added to the mixture, which was incubated for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The complexes containing antibody-bound integrin and co-precipitating proteins were pelleted and washed five times with TBS/CHAPS buffer containing 0.1% CHAPS. Then, 15 μl of gel sample buffer was added to the co-immunoprecipitated complexes, which were boiled to release bound proteins. Samples were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Talin or α-actinin co-precipitating with integrins was visualized using monoclonal antibodies 8d4 or BM75.1 (obtained from Sigma), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and chemiluminescence detection (Pierce). Plasmids harboring the cDNAs encoding the human β2 or β1 integrin cytoplasmic tails were generously provided by Drs. William Roeder and A. F. Horwitz, respectively. The region encompassing the cytoplasmic tails of these integrins was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the GST fusion vector, pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-β2 cytoplasmic domain mutations were generated by oligonucleotide-based site-directed mutagenesis using the method of Kunkel (16Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar). The resultant mutations were verified by nucleotide sequencing of the region of interest. The fusion protein constructs were introduced into the Escherichia coli strain BL21, and expression of the GST-β2 or GST-β1 proteins was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione immobilized on Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then covalently coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads using dimethylpimelimidate cross-linker for 1 h at room temperature, prior to use in affinity chromatography-like assays as described by the manufacturer. 500 μg of PMN lysate or 5 μg of purified α-actinin or talin was applied to the column and allowed to bind for 30 min (α-actinin and talin were purified from chicken gizzard as described previously (5Otey C.A. Pavalko F.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Unbound proteins were removed by extensive washing with cell lysis buffer, and specifically bound proteins were eluted with 1 m KCl containing 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Following trichloroacetic acid precipitation and acetone washes, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblot analysis were performed by blocking for 1 h in buffer containing 2.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% gelatin, and 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS and incubation with anti-α-actinin antibody (BM75.1) or anti-talin antibody (8d4) for 1 h. After washing two times in wash buffer (0.2% gelatin, 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS), blots were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody, washed again, and exposed to ECL color development reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We previously reported that the protein α-actinin became associated with the cytoplasmic domain of the β2 subunit in PMNs following activation but that α-actinin did not interact with β2 integrins in unactivated cells (6Pavalko F.M. LaRoche S.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3795-3807PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we searched for cytoskeletal proteins that constitutively bound to β2 integrins and might function to link integrins to actin filaments prior to activation. For these experiments, we first used an integrin co-immunoprecipitation assay. We found that the protein talin, previously reported to bind to the cytoplasmic domain of β1 (4Horwitz A.F. Duggan K. Buck C. Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. Nature. 1986; 320: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) and β3 integrins (17Knezevic I. Leisner T.M. Lam S.C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16416-16421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), co-immunoprecipitated with β2 integrins from unactivated PMNs (Fig. 1 A, −FMLP). Significantly, only the higher molecular mass (approximately 225 kDa) form of talin was seen in the β2 immunoprecipitates from unactivated (−FMLP) cells; the 190-kDa proteolytic fragment of talin, clearly present in PMN extracts, was not present in the integrin co-immunoprecipitates. Somewhat surprisingly, talin failed to co-immunoprecipitate with β2 integrins after activation (Fig. 1 A, +FMLP). Thus, the 225-kDa talin, corresponding to the intact protein, appeared to constitutively bind to the cytoplasmic tail. The bands in the first two lanes that migrate below the 190-kDa talin band and above the band corresponding to the Ig heavy chain appear to be an additional proteolytic fragment of talin. In addition to co-immunoprecipitation, we have also confirmed that purified talin (purified from chicken gizzard) can bind directly to the β2 cytoplasmic tail. In this experiment, the purified 225-kDa talin (but not the 190-kDa proteolytic fragment) bound to a GST fusion protein corresponding to the full-length β2 integrin cytoplasmic tail but did not bind to GST alone (Fig. 1 B). Next, we further investigated the significance of the observation that only intact, 225-kDa talin co-immunoprecipitated with β2 integrins from resting PMNs. Evidence that talin undergoes proteolysis in PMNs following activation was provided by immunoblot analysis. 20 μg of total protein from freshly isolated, unactivated PMNs or 40 μg of total protein from PMNs activated with either the chemotactic peptide FMLP (10 nm) or with the phorbol ester PMA (100 nm) was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against talin (the greater amount of protein from FMLP- and PMA-activated cells was necessary to allow us to detect the small amount of the intact, 225-kDa talin band that was present following activation). Fig. 1 C shows that in resting PMNs, most of the talin is in the high molecular mass (approximately 225 kDa) form, corresponding to the intact protein. The ratios of the 225- to the 190-kDa bands were determined by densitometry prior to and following activation of PMNs with FMLP or PMA. In unactivated cells, the ratio of 225-kDa talin to 190-kDa proteolytic fragment was 0.9; following activation, the ratio of 225-kDa talin to 190-kDa proteolytic fragment was 0.05. Fig. 1 D shows that pretreatment of PMNs for 30 min with the membrane permeant calpain inhibitor calpeptin (100 μm) significantly reduced talin proteolysis following activation so that only 20% of the talin corresponded to the 190-kDa proteolytic fragment (ratio of 225-kDa:190-kDa, 0.8). Together, these results suggest that only full-length 225-kDa talin associates with the β2 cytoplasmic tail as determined by co-immunoprecipitation andin vitro binding. Following activation, the majority of the talin is cleaved by a calpain-like protease to a 190-kDa form that does not associate with the β2 tail. Consistent with our previous report (6Pavalko F.M. LaRoche S.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3795-3807PubMed Google Scholar), we found that association of α-actinin with β2 integrins in PMNs requires activation of the cells. Fig. 2 shows that following activation, α-actinin rapidly associates with the cytoplasmic tail and can be detected in immunoprecipitates of β2 integrin. In contrast, α-actinin in fibroblasts appears to be constitutively associated with the β1 integrins. As shown in Fig. 2, α-actinin can be detected by Western blotting in co-immunoprecipitates with anti-β1 antibody from fibroblasts that have either been grown on fibronectin or vitronectin or maintained in suspension for 2 h. We postulated that sequence differences between the β1 and β2 cytoplasmic domains may be responsible for regulating this differential association of α-actinin. To investigate this question, we constructed GST fusion proteins coupled to Sepharose that correspond to the entire human β1 or β2 cytoplasmic domains sequences (β1, residues 752–798; β2, residues 724–769) and used them as affinity chromatography matrices to assess the ability of α-actinin from cell extracts to bind to each sequence. Fig. 3 A and Table I show that α-actinin bound to the full-length β1 tail (β1 w.t.) but interacted only weakly with the full-length β2 tail (β2 w.t.) fusion protein. α-Actinin binding to the full-length β1 tail was 9.7-fold higher than binding to the full-length β2 tail (Table I). Similar results were obtained when purified α-actinin, instead of cell extract, was applied to the fusion protein affinity columns (not shown). Together with the requirement for activation of PMNs to induce α-actinin-β2 binding, these results suggest that additional events, such as conformational changes in the β2 tail, are required to allow enhanced binding of α-actinin to the cytoplasmic domain.Table ISummary of GST-fusion protein-α-actinin binding studiesConstruct designationAmino acid sequenceFold increase in α-actinin relative to β2 w.t.aβ2 w.t., full-length β2 cytoplasmic domain.β2 w.t. tailKALIHLSDLREYRRFEKEKLKSQWNNDNPLFAKSATTTVMNPKFAES1.0Δ727–746KAL–––––––––-QWNNDNPLFAKSATTTVMNPKFAESBinding not detectableΔ727–736KAL––––-RRFEKEKLKSQWNNDNPLFAKSATTTVMNPKFAES2.2Δ746–769KALIHLSDLREYRRFEKEKLKS––––––––––––-12.2736–746–––––-RRFEKEKLKS––––––––––––-9.8Δ758–769KALIHLSDLREYRRFEKEKLKSQWNNDNPLFAKSA––––––6.0β1 w.t. tailKLLMIIHDRREFAKFEKEKMNAKWDTGENPIYKSAVTTVVNPKYEGK9.7N748AKALIHLSDLREYRRFEKEKLKSQWANDNPLFAKSATTTVMNPKFAES19.7N749AKALIHLSDLREYRRFEKEKLKSQWNADNPLFAKSATTTVMNPKFAES20.3D750AKALIHLSDLREYRRFEKEKLKSQWNNANPLFAKSATTTVMNPKFAES18.2P752AKALIHLSDLREYRRFEKEKLKSQWNNDNALFAKSATTTVMNPKFAES16.4T758EKALIHLSDLREYRRFEKEKLKSQWNNDNPLFAKSAETTVMNPKFAES15.7T758AKALIHLSDLREYRRFEKEKLKSQWNNDNPLFAKSAATTVMNPKFAES14.5T759AKALIHLSDLREYRRFEKEKLKSQWNNDNPLFAKSATATVMNPKFAES17.8T760AKALIHLSDLREYRRFEKEKLKSQWNNDNPLFAKSATTAVMNPKFAES18.9M762VKALIHLSDLREYRRFEKEKLKSQWNNDNPLFAKSATTTVVNPKFAES13.5A767EKALIHLSDLREYRRFEKEKLKSQWNNDNPLFAKSATTTVMNPKFEES17.4K755AKALIHLSDLREYRRFEKEKLKSQWNNDNPLFAASATTTVMNPKFAES1.9F766AKALIHLSDLREYRRFEKEKLKSQWNNDNPLFAKSATTTVMNPKAAES0.7E768AKALIHLSDLREYRRFEKEKLKSQWNNDNPLFAKSATTTVMNPKFAAS0.8Deleted segments are shown by dashed line.

Single base pair substitutions are shown underlined. Consistent with this hypothesis, truncation to remove the COOH-terminal half of the β2 cytoplasmic tail at residue 746 (Δ746–769) resulted in enhanced binding of α-actinin compared with the wild-type β2 tail (Fig. 3 B and Table I). Results from five separate experiments showed that α-actinin binding to Δ746–769 averaged 12.2-fold higher compared with α-actinin binding to wild-type β2. The membrane proximal (NH2-terminal) half of the cytoplasmic domain of β2 expressed in the Δ746–769 truncation mutant contains several conserved residues, including the sequence RFEKEKEK that was previously implicated in α-actinin-β2 binding (6Pavalko F.M. LaRoche S.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3795-3807PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the predicted importance of residues 727–746 for binding, Fig. 3 B and Table I also show that α-actinin could not be detected binding to a deletion mutant in which residues727–746 (Δ727–746) corresponding to the membrane proximal half of the tail were deleted. A third deletion mutant lacking residues 727–736 (Δ727–736) bound α-actinin weakly, with an increase of only 2.2-fold above wild-type β2 binding levels (Fig. 3 Band Table I). Fig. 3 C and Table I show that the 11-amino acid region within residues 736–746 is sufficient for binding α-actinin at a level 9.8-fold above wild-type β2 and was comparable both to α-actinin binding to GST-β1 and to the β2 truncation mutant representing the membrane proximal sequence (Δ746–769). These results indicate that a binding site for α-actinin resides within residues 736–746 and that binding of α-actinin to this region may be masked or sterically impaired by an inhibitory domain between residues 746–769. To further investigate whether the putative α-actinin inhibitory domain in the membrane distal half of the β2 cytoplasmic tail might regulate integrin association with α-actinin, a series of point mutations were created in this region. The results of experiments assessing the ability of α-actinin to bind to these fusion proteins are illustrated in Fig. 4and summarized in Table I. Point mutations at nine residues in the COOH terminus of the tail, N748A, N749A, D750A, P752A, T758(A/E), T759A, T760A, A767E (Fig. 4 and Table I), and M762V (Table I) resulted in binding of α-actinin at levels comparable to or higher than α-actinin binding to Δ746–769. Point mutations at other, apparently less critical residues, including Lys755 (K755A), Phe766 (F766A), and Glu768 (E768A), shown in Fig. 4 and Table I, however, did not alter the wild-type binding phenotype; i.e. weak binding of α-actinin. Thus, altering the conformation of the distal half of the β2 cytoplasmic domain by introduction of point mutations at any of several apparently critical residues relieves the inhibitory effect on α-actinin binding to residues 736–746 in the membrane proximal half of the tail. Although there does not appear to be a critical role for the extreme COOH-terminal end of the tail, between residues 763 and 769, in regulating cytoskeletal interactions, the significance of the A767E point mutation that induced α-actinin binding is not clear. The cytoplasmic tails of integrin β subunits play an important role in mediating interactions with the cytoskeleton and are important in controlling cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions. Integrins that are clustered in the membrane co-localize and physically associate with cytoskeletal proteins in vitro and in vivo(3Pavalko F.M. Otey C.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1994; 205: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Otey C.A. Vasquez G.B. Burridge K. Erickson B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21193-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the role of the β2 integrin cytoplasmic tail in mediating interactions with two cytoskeletal proteins, talin and α-actinin, using human neutrophils and GST-β2 cytoplasmic domain fusion protein affinity columns. Based on our results, we propose a mechanism (illustrated in Fig.5) through which β2 integrins in unactivated neutrophils are tethered to the actin cytoskeleton through a linkage mediated by talin. The activation-induced proteolysis of talin, which can be inhibited by the calpain protease inhibitor calpeptin, may regulate binding of talin to β2 integrins. Such a role for talin has recently been proposed in lymphocytes to explain the regulation of LFA-1-mediated adhesion by calpain (13Stewart M.P. McKowall A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Lub et al. (14Lub M. van Vliet S.J. Oomen S. Pieters R.A. Robinson M. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) showed that the cytoskeleton has different effects on LFA-1-mediated adhesion depending on whether or not LFA-1 was initially clustered or was diffuse on the membrane. They suggested that release of cytoskeletal constraints on LFA-1 in unactivated lymphocytes was necessary to allow lateral movement of LFA-1, and clustering on the membrane was necessary to stabilize cell adhesion. Following activation, β2 integrins may be released from cytoskeletal constraint by breaking the link between talin and integrin upon proteolysis of talin. Once β2 integrins have engaged ligand and clustered in the membrane, reengagement of the actin cytoskeleton, mediated by binding of α-actinin to the membrane proximal half of the tail, may stabilize cytoskeletal-integrin interactions necessary for firm adhesion and transendothelial migration. Distinct domains within the β2 cytoplasmic tail that regulate binding to the protein α-actinin have also been identified. GST-β2 cytoplasmic tail fusion protein binding experiments identified an 11-amino acid region (RRFEKEKLKSQ) between residues 736 and 746 in the membrane proximal half of the tail that are necessary and sufficient for α-actinin binding. A second distinct region in the membrane distal half of the tail was shown to have a unique role in regulating α-actinin binding. An inhibitory region resides between residues 748–769 and prevents association of α-actinin to the membrane proximal binding region. The ability of point mutations at any of several residues in this inhibitory domain (residues Asn748, Asn749, Asp750, Pro752, Thr758, Thr759, Thr760, Met762, and Ala767) to apparently unmask the previously cryptic α-actinin binding site in the β2 tail suggest that the conformation of the tail is important in regulating α-actinin binding. Analysis of the membrane distal region (residues 747–769) revealed the presence of several motifs within this domain that could have significant influence on the structural conformations of the β2 cytoplasmic tail. One of these is the NPXF/Y motif (NPLF in β2), which is structurally important, is conserved among the integrins β subunits (19Haas T.A. Plow E.F. Protein Eng. 1998; 10: 1395-1405Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and has been shown to be important for postligand recognition activities, such as cytoskeletal interactions, firm adhesion, growth control, and shape change (20Chang D.D. Wong C. Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 21O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Culley B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8553-8558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Melanoma cells transfected with β3 integrin in vitro and in vivo failed to migrate on vitronectin-coated surfaces when the NPXY domain was altered by mutation, whereas cells transfected with wild-type β3 attached, spread, and migrated normally (22Filardo E.J. Brooks P.C. Deming S.L. Damsky C. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This deletion did not appear to affect ligand recognition because the cells were still able to bind soluble vitronectin. Hibbs et al. (23Hibbs M.L. Jakes S. Stacker S.A. Wallace R.W. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 24Hibbs M.L. Xu H. Stacker S.A. Springer T.A. Science. 1991; 251: 1611-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) have also shown that mutations within the NPXY motif of β2 did not prevent binding of LFA-1-transfected COS cells to intracellular adhesion molecule-1-coated surface, whereas they prevented downstream phosphorylation of a serine residue. This suggests that this motif could have a potential regulatory role both in influencing protein conformation and in providing a site for kinase binding. NPXY also imparts a tight β turn to the cytoplasmic domain. Our model predicts a structural configuration of the β2 tail in unactivated neutrophils in which the α-actinin binding site is masked as a result of this turn. This model is supported by the findings of Reszka et al. (25Reszka A.A. Hayashi A. Horowitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1321-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), who reported that all four of the amino acids in the region upstream of the NPXY domain in β1 integrins that were essential for cytoskeletal binding were in fact on one face of an α-helix. The exact mechanism of conformational change in vivo, however, is not clear. The membrane distal half of the β2 tail has several potential phosphorylation sites, including a serine (Ser756) and the threonine triplet (Thr758-Thr759-Thr760). Hibbset al. (23Hibbs M.L. Jakes S. Stacker S.A. Wallace R.W. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 24Hibbs M.L. Xu H. Stacker S.A. Springer T.A. Science. 1991; 251: 1611-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) have shown that whereas in vivophosphorylation of the β2 tail was predominantly at Ser756, alteration of this residue by mutagenesis has little effect on ligand binding. Mutation of the threonines to alanine, however, led to a complete loss of ligand binding in their study, suggesting that the region between Ser756 and Met762 could be important for ligand binding and association of cytoskeletal proteins. In our studies, point mutations T758E, which may mimic phosphorylation by introducing a negative charge, and T758A both enhanced α-actinin binding compared with wild-type, suggesting that phosphorylation of threonine 758 is not necessary for inducing binding of α-actinin but may be important for ligand binding. Comparison of the regions previously identified to be important for extracellular ligand binding versus the cytoskeletal protein binding regions described here (summarized in TableII) suggest that distinct domains in the β2 cytoplasmic tail regulate these two events. Hibbs et al. (23Hibbs M.L. Jakes S. Stacker S.A. Wallace R.W. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 24Hibbs M.L. Xu H. Stacker S.A. Springer T.A. Science. 1991; 251: 1611-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) showed that the region between 726 and 755 in the β2 tail was dispensable for intracellular adhesion molecule-1 binding, whereas we have mapped α-actinin binding to this region (727–746). Furthermore, they and others have demonstrated the need for presence of intact threonine triplets for ligand binding, whereas we have shown that single alanine substitution at any of those sites induces α-actinin binding. Additionally, the carboxyl-terminal five amino acid residues, KFAES, have been implicated in ligand binding, in particular the residue Phe766. In contrast, our studies showed that F766A mutation maintained the β2 tail in a wild-type phenotype, i.e. it was unable to bind α-actinin.Table IIComparison of residues important for cytoskeletal association versus adhesion to ICAM-1β2 sequenceRole in regulating the association with α-actininRole in regulating ICAM-1 binding (24Hibbs M.L.

Taken together, these studies suggest involvement of some as yet unknown cytoplasmic factors, which could directly regulate both the above events. Recent evidence has shown that novel proteins, such as cytohesin (26Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B.

Damage of telomeres, if not repaired, causes cell cycle arrest, chromosome fusion, or degradation. Telomeres shorten, however, as a function of each cell division in normal human somatic cells, where telomerase activity is below detectable levels, contributing to the mechanisms underlying cell senescence. In most human cancers, telomeres stop shortening because of the de novo synthesis of telomeric DNA by activated telomerase. Telomerase may thus play a pivotal role in regulating the structure and function of telomeres during human cell immortalization and tumor progression.

Cell. 1997; 90: 785-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar), little is known about how telomerase is activated and maintained at the enzyme levels in human cancers. One possible mechanism is that the tertiary and quaternary structures of the large telomerase complex are modulated by protein phosphorylation in such a way that the enzyme is activated. This hypothesis is based on our previous finding that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) specifically inhibits telomerase activity in the nuclear lysates of human breast cancer cells (25Li H. Zhao L.L. Funder J.W. Liu J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16729-16732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To establish if telomerase is directly regulated by protein phosphorylation and which protein kinase(s) are involved in the process, we have made use of affinity chromatography with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of hTEP1 and produced polyclonal antibodies against hTEP1 and hTERT to isolate telomerase and its potentially responsible protein kinase(s) involved in the regulation of telomerase activity. Our data show that protein kinase Cα (PKCα) is selectively eluted from the hTEP1 peptide affinity column and mediates phosphorylation of hTEP1 and hTERT in intact human breast cancer cells. Phosphorylation of partially purified telomerase results in a marked increase in telomerase activity in vitro. Thus, activation of telomerase and subsequent maintenance of its activity may require a prerequisite phosphorylation of telomerase proteins by PKCα in human breast cancer cells. PKC isoforms, the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, PP2A, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were from BIOMOL Research Laboratories Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Alkaline phosphatase was from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). DNA-dependent protein kinase was from Promega (Madison, WI). Cdc2 protein kinase was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, New York). ATP, Taq DNA polymerase, dNTP, and T4 gene 32 protein were from Boehringer Mannheim Australia Pty. Ltd. (New South Wales, Australia). 32P, [α-32P]ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP were from Amersham Australia Pty. Ltd. (New South Wales). Gel electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were from Sigma Chemical. The telomerase peptides were synthesized by Chiron Technologies Pty. Ltd. (Victoria, Australia). Several peptides were made to produce telomerase peptide affinity column and hTEP1-specific antibodies, and the peptides WGVTEEETRRNRQLEVC and DSEPTPHLKTRQRR were finally selected for making an affinity purification column used in this study and producing anti-hTEP1 antibodies, respectively. For anti-hTERT antibody, the peptide CAREKPQGSVAAPEEEDTD was used. Anti-hTEP1 and anti-hTERT antibodies were raised in rabbits by multiple immunization with the synthetic peptides. The antibodies were then affinity-purified against the respective antigenic peptides as described previously (26Lerner R.A. Green N. Alexander H. Liu F.T. Sutcliffe J.G. Shinnick T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3403-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Anti-PKC isoform antibodies and anti-Cdc2 kinase antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz CA). Anti-casein kinase IIα antibody and anti-mitogen-activated protein kinase antibody were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-PP2Aβ antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The immunoreactive proteins were detected with ECL (Amersham Australia Pty. Ltd.). The hTEP1 peptide affinity column was prepared for purification of telomerase potential regulatory protein kinase and phosphatase by a method described previously (27Woodgett J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the peptide affinity chromatography, ∼10 mg of total proteins of the nuclear telomerase extracts from human breast cancer PMC42 cells were loaded onto the column (bed volume of 10 ml) at a flow rate of ∼0.5 ml/min. Following extensive washing (50 ml), the column was eluted with KCl (0–300 mm) and then a glycine buffer (0.1 mm, pH 2.4). The collected fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies and the TRAP telomerase activity assay (3Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6584) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of proteins in the isolated telomerase fractions were subjected to incubation in phosphorylation buffer containing ATP (∼40 μm, containing 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and Mg2+ (1 mm), and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 10 min before being terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer (28Liu J.-P. Sim A.T.R. Robinson P.J. Science. 1994; 265: 970-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). For protein back-phosphorylation, the proteins were subjected to dephosphorylation by incubation of the samples in the presence of an appropriate concentration of protein phosphatase as indicated in a proper buffer at 30 °C for 5 min prior to phosphorylation (25Li H. Zhao L.L. Funder J.W. Liu J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16729-16732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 28Liu J.-P. Sim A.T.R. Robinson P.J. Science. 1994; 265: 970-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). After the dephosphorylation was terminated by inclusion of NaF (10 mm) and cooling at 0 °C, the samples were then subjected to protein phosphorylation with the adjustment of the buffer to phosphorylation conditions by adding 10–100× stock solutions (25Li H. Zhao L.L. Funder J.W. Liu J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16729-16732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar,28Liu J.-P. Sim A.T.R. Robinson P.J. Science. 1994; 265: 970-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). For PKC-mediated protein phosphorylation, free Ca2+(200 μm), phosphatidylserine (40 μg/ml), PMA (10 μm), and purified recombinant PKCα (1 nm) were included, and for detecting endogenous PKC activity, incubation was carried out in the presence or absence of the PKC inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide I (10 μm) and staurosporine (100 nm). The phosphorylated proteins were subsequently resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. For telomerase protein phosphorylation in intact human breast cancer cells, the cells were incubated with or without the PKC activator PMA for 3 h, and during the last 2 h, 32P was included in the phosphate-free medium to label the intracellular ATP pool and thus phosphoproteins. It was noted that PMA treatment did not induce significant change in the levels of 32P labeling in these cells. After being extensively washed, the cells were lysed, and the total lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography or to further incubations with PP2A plus or minus purified PKC from rat brain (28Liu J.-P. Sim A.T.R. Robinson P.J. Science. 1994; 265: 970-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To determine direct phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of telomerase proteins in intact human breast cancer cells, hTERT and hTEP1 were immunoprecipitated from total cell lysates or partially purified telomerase fractions using specific antibodies against hTERT and hTEP1 peptides and a preimmune IgG as a control, essentially as described elsewhere (28Liu J.-P. Sim A.T.R. Robinson P.J. Science. 1994; 265: 970-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To verify efficient precipitation of telomerase, telomerase activity was assessed in the immunoprecipitation by incubating the supernatant, wash fraction, and immunoprecipitates in a telomerase assay, with the immunoprecipitates being treated or not with PP2A. The measurement of telomerase activity was performed with the TRAP assay as described (3Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6584) Google Scholar). For measuring telomerase activity in the immunoprecipitates, the telomerase reaction was carried out by incubating the immunoprecipitates at 30 °C for 20 min with shaking in a buffer described previously (25Li H. Zhao L.L. Funder J.W. Liu J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16729-16732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), which was then followed by centrifugation to remove the immunoprecipitated beads or phenol/chloroform extraction to obtain the de novosynthesized telomeres for polymerase chain reaction amplification. To analyze the effects of protein kinases and phosphatases on telomerase activity, partially purified telomerase was incubated with PP2A or alkaline phosphatase, and after termination of the reaction with NaF (10 mm), the samples were subjected to the telomerase activity assay or to further incubation of protein phosphorylation at 30 °C for 10 min followed by the telomerase activity assay (25Li H. Zhao L.L. Funder J.W. Liu J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16729-16732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The protein kinases tested included PKCα, PKCδ, PKCε, PKCζ, the DNA-dependent protein kinase, Cdc2 protein kinase, and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A . Inappropriate telomerase activity is associated with a variety of human cancers (3Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6584) Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that the activity of telomerase can be switched off at the enzyme level by PP2A-mediated protein dephosphorylation in the nuclei of human breast cancer cells (25Li H. Zhao L.L. Funder J.W. Liu J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16729-16732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To further explore the mechanisms of regulation of telomerase activity by protein phosphorylation, telomerase was partially purified by hTEP1 peptide affinity chromatography, and protein kinase(s) potentially interacting with the hTEP1 peptide were analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.1 A, although some telomerase passed straight through the peptide affinity column, after extensive washing (five times the column bed volume), a significant amount of telomerase activity could be eluted from the column in particular fractions, with the major peak corresponding to the KCl concentrations of ∼120–150 mm. In contrast, a small amount of telomerase activity was eluted in these fractions from a column packed with a scrambled peptide (data not shown). These findings suggest that a functional telomerase complex is selectively retained in the hTEP1 peptide affinity chromatography column, probably through complex interactions involving multiple contacts between the telomerase complex and the hTEP1 peptide. This speculation is supported by the findings that a substantial amount of immunoreactive hTEP1 was coeluted with telomerase activity from the column (data not shown) and that immunoprecipitated hTEP1 formed multiple oligomers under particular conditions (data not shown). To identify protein kinase(s) putatively involved in regulating telomerase, column fractions were probed with various antibodies against different protein kinases. Interestingly, although no evidence for the presence of Cdc2 kinase, casein kinase IIα, mitogen-activated protein kinase, PKCβ1, PKCε, or PKCζ was found (data not shown), significant levels of immunoreactive PKCα were shown by Western blot analysis in some particular fractions from the low pH glycine elution (Fig. 1 B). As a control for specificity, no PKCα was similarly eluted from the column in which beads were coupled with a scrambled peptide (Fig. 1 C). These data suggest that PKCα interacts with the hTEP1 peptide with a reasonably high affinity and a possible involvement of the kinase in modulating the structure and function of telomerase. Since the structure of hTEP1 is similar to that of Rack1, a receptor for activated PKC (29Mochly-Rosen D. Khaner H. Lopez J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3997-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), in having a WD-40 repeat domain, it is tempting to speculate that the WD-40 repeats in hTEP1 are also involved in mediating PKC binding. To explore whether telomerase proteins are phosphorylated by PKC, hTEP1 was immunoprecipitated from cultured human breast cancer cells prelabeled with 32P. Significant levels of telomerase activity were observed in the immunoprecipitates, and the activity was completely inhibited by PP2A (Fig.2 A), consistent with previous findings that hTEP1 co-immunoprecipitates with telomerase activity (19Harrington L. McPhail T. Mar V. Zhou W. Oulton R. Bass M.B. Arruda I. Robinson M.O. Science. 1997; 275: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar,20Nakayama J. Saito M. Nakamura H. Matsuura A. Ishikawa F. Cell. 1997; 88: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and suggesting that phosphorylation of telomerase protein component(s) is required for enzyme activity. Immunoprecipitated hTEP1 showed a major protein with a molecular mass of ∼300 kDa (data not shown). Autoradiography of immunoprecipitated hTEP1, however, showed that hTEP1 is a phosphoprotein in intact cells (Fig. 2 B). Incubation of cells with the PKC activator PMA increased the phosphorylation of hTEP1 (Fig. 2 B), consistent with PKC mediating the phosphorylation of hTEP1 in human breast cancer cells. To determine if hTEP1 is a direct substrate of PKC and PP2A in vitro, the immunoprecipitates were then subjected to sequential dephosphorylation and rephosphorylation. Endogenously phosphorylated proteins showed near-complete dephosphorylation in the presence of purified PP2A and, following dephosphorylation, were subsequently rephosphorylated in the presence of purified PKCα (Fig.2 B). Omission of PKCα or inclusion of the specific PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I led to no rephosphorylation (data not shown). These data suggest that hTEP1 is a phosphoprotein directly controlled by PKC in vitro and, presumably, similarly in intact human breast cancer cells. Since the rephosphorylation by PKCα was not in full, it is possible that other protein kinase(s) are potentially involved as well.Figure 2PKCα mediates telomerase protein phosphorylation in vitroand in intact cells. A, immunoprecipitation of telomerase activity with anti-hTEP1 antibody from human breast cancer cells and role of protein phosphorylation. Total cell lysates of PMC42 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with preimmune IgG (lanes 1–3) or anti-hTEP1 antibody (lanes 4–8). The supernatants (S), wash fractions (W), and immunoprecipitates (IP) were then analyzed for telomerase activity. Some immunoprecipitates were additionally subjected to further incubation with (lane 8) or without (lane 7) PP2A (20 units) at 30 °C for 5 min, followed by termination of the reaction with NaF before the telomerase activity assay. B, hTEP1 is phosphorylated by PKCα and dephosphorylated by PP2A. Human breast cancer PMC42 cells were treated with the PKC activator PMA (200 nm; lanes 3–5) or diluent (lanes 1and 2) for 2 h, and the intracellular ATP pool was labeled with 32P by inclusion of the radioisotope (0.5 mCi/1 × 106 cells) in a phosphate-free medium. After extensive washing, the cells were lysed for immunoprecipitation with control IgG (lane 1) or anti-hTEP1 antibody (lanes 2–4). The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to incubation with (lanes 4 and 5) or without (lanes 1–3) PP2A (20 units) at 30 °C for 5 min, followed by termination of the reaction with NaF. After the dephosphorylation was terminated, the sample in lane 5 was subjected to further incubation with PKCα in phosphorylation buffer at 30 °C for 10 min, which was then terminated by adding SDS sample buffer and freezing the sample in liquid nitrogen. All samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (upper panel) and immunoblotting (lower panel). C, immunoblotting and co-immunoprecipitation of hTERT and hTEP1.

Since telomerase activity co-immunoprecipitated with hTEP1 from these cells (Fig.2 A) and since the protein doublet was of the appropriate size, it is possible that the phosphoprotein doublet is the catalytic subunit of telomerase (hTERT) co-immunoprecipitated with hTEP1. To determine if hTEP1 and hTERT co-immunoprecipitate, crude nuclear lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-hTERT or anti-hTEP1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 C, hTERT was readily detectable by immunoblotting in the crude nuclear lysates; in addition, hTERT activity could be immunoprecipitated with antibody to either hTERT or hTEP1 from these cells, suggesting that the telomerase catalytic subunit interacts with hTEP1 in the cells. To further explore if hTERT is phosphorylated in intact cells, hTERT was immunoprecipitated from 32P-prelabeled cells. Consistent with the above hypothesis, immunoprecipitated hTERT showed the correct size with significant levels of phosphorylation, which were increased by the PKC activator PMA (Fig. 2 D, lane 2 versus lane 5 and lane 3 versus lane 6), suggesting that PKC also mediates hTERT phosphorylation in human breast cancer cells. Incubation of hTERT immunoprecipitates with PP2A resulted in modest reductions of hTERT phosphorylation under both basal and PMA-stimulated conditions (Fig. 2 D, lane 2 versus lane 3 and lane 5 versus lane 6), suggesting that hTERT may also be reversibly controlled by PKCα and PP2A in intact cells. The relatively small changes in the dephosphorylation of immunoprecipitated hTERT by PP2A could be due to the binding of anti-hTERT antibody or an involvement of other factors. The identities of the phosphoproteins at the top of the gel and with a molecular mass of ∼43 kDa are under further investigation, although the phosphoproteins at the top of the gel could be co-immunoprecipitated hTEP1. These data also suggest that the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of both hTERT and hTEP1 may thereby regulate the function of the telomerase complex in human breast cancer cells. To determine roles for PKCα-mediated phosphorylation of telomerase proteins, the activity of partially purified telomerase was analyzed following differential incubations with different protein kinases, including PKC isoforms, DNA-dependent protein kinase, Cdc2 kinase, and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. Although DNA-dependent protein kinase, Cdc2 kinase, and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A had no effect (data not shown), incubation of the partially purified telomerase having relatively low activity with PKCα resulted in marked increases in telomerase activity. A dramatic increase in telomerase activity was observed at a PKCα concentration as low as 10−13m (Fig.3 A, lane 4 versus lane 5), and the increases were in a dose-dependent fashion with maximal effects at a concentration of ≥10−11m (Fig.3 A). This stimulatory effect was not seen for PKC activators alone (Fig. 2 A, PS) or for PKCα in the absence of its activators (data not shown), suggesting that the phosphorylation activity of PKCα is required for the activation of telomerase. In addition to stimulating the basal activity of partially purified telomerase, PKCα also completely reversed the inhibition of telomerase activity by PP2A. PP2A inhibited the activities of immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2 A) and partially purified (Fig.3 B) telomerase, a concentration-dependent inhibition also found with the nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (Fig.3 B). The telomerase inhibited by PP2A could, however, be completely reactivated by PKCα over a range of concentrations (Fig.3 C), with a maximal effect at ≥10−10m. Thus, the reversible phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of hTERT and hTEP1 as seen above were paralleled by the reversible increase and decrease in telomerase activity induced by PKCα and PP2A, respectively. The finding that telomerase can be reversibly stimulated by PKCα and inhibited by PP2A strongly argues that the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex exists in two structural conformations (phosphorylated and dephosphorylated) that are associated with high or low telomerase activities, structurally and functionally distinct forms of telomerase that can be switched to and fro by PKCα and PP2A. Increases in telomerase activity are paralleled by increased expression of the telomerase catalytic subunit hTERT (8Nakamura T.M. Morin G.B. Chapman K.B. Weinrich S.L. Andrews W.H. Lingner J.

Cell. 1997; 90: 785-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar), in addition to the PKCα-mediated phosphorylation as shown here. It is thus likely that, during the process of telomerase activation in human breast cancer cells, the assembly of a functionally active enzyme complex with newly produced hTERT and other telomerase components requires PKCα-induced phosphorylation of both hTERT and hTEP1. Although the phosphorylation sites on hTERT and hTEP1 have yet to be determined, the interactions between PKCα and telomerase proteins appear to be mediated by direct binding of the kinase to the telomerase complex through regions other than the C1 and C2 domains of PKCα, as demonstrated by testing other PKC isoforms for their effects on telomerase activity. Both the calcium-independent PKCδ and PKCε and the atypical diacylglycerol-independent PKCζ stimulated telomerase activity (Fig. 3 D). This suggests that, although all PKC isoforms possess the potential to regulate telomerase activity, only PKCα is associated with partially purified telomerase in the nuclei of human breast cancer cells, evidence for a specific regulatory role for PKCα in telomerase activity in these cells. Consistent with the observation for PKCα, all PKC isoforms at concentrations >10−8m caused an inhibition of telomerase activity (Fig. 3 D), suggesting a complex interaction between telomerase and PKC. Since PKCδ, PKCε, and PKCζ possess no C2 domain and PKCζ contains a half-C1 domain (30Parker P.J. Kour G. Marais R.M. Mitchell F. Pears C. Schaap D. Stabel S. Webster C. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), these data also suggest that intact C1 and C2 domains are not essential for regulating telomerase activity. Thus, interactions between PKC and the telomerase proteins appear to involve regions other than the C1 and C2 domains of PKC. Since previous studies have shown that PKC inhibitors inhibit telomerase activity during T cell activation (32Bodnar A.G. Kim N.W. Effros R.B. Chiu C.-P. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and in cultured nasopharyngeal cancer cells (33Ku W.C. Cheng A.J. Wang T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and that the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid stimulates telomerase activity in cultured human breast cancer cells (25Li H. Zhao L.L. Funder J.W. Liu J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16729-16732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), it is possible that telomerase activity is dynamically maintained by a balance of the activities between PKCα and PP2A through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the telomerase proteins hTERT and hTEP1. Taken together, these data establish a pathway whereby telomerase is activated in human cancer cells and implicate PKCα as playing a pivotal role in controlling telomerase activity in cultured human breast cancer cells. Given that expression of PKCα is markedly increased in the nuclei of human breast cancer cells, with a 30-fold increase in PKCα expression and a 10-fold increase in kinase activity (34Lee S.A. Karaszkiewicz J.W. Anderson W.B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3750-3759PubMed Google Scholar, 35Blobe G.C. Sachs C.W. Khan W.A. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Wetsel W.C. Obeid L.M. Fine R.L. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Nature. 1991; 308: 693-698Crossref Scopus (5764) Google Scholar). In addition, the reversible regulation of telomerase by PKCα and PP2A is also consistent with the hypothesis that a balance between activation of PKC (36Blobe G.C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 411-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 37Nishizuka Y.

We found that the three tetratricopeptide repeats found in the COOH terminus of ARA9 are necessary and sufficient for interaction with the AHR complex. Conversely, the AHR's ""repressor""/Hsp90 binding domain is required for interaction with ARA9. Because ARA9 closely resembles the 52-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP52), found in the unliganded glucocorticoid receptor (GR) complex, we compared the binding specificities of ARA9 and FKBP52 for AHR and GR. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, ARA9 specifically associated with AHR-Hsp90 complex but not with GR-Hsp90 complexes. In addition, ARA9 showed a greater capacity than FKBP52 to associate with AHR-Hsp90 complexes. The biological importance of this interaction was suggested by the observation that in a yeast expression system ARA9 expression enhanced the response of AHR to the agonist β-napthoflavone, decreasing the EC<sub>50</sub> by greater than 5-fold and increasing the maximal response 2.5-fold. In contrast, co-expression of FKBP52 had no effect on AHR signaling. In addition, although ARA9 contains a domain similar to that found in other FK506-binding proteins, ARA9 binding to <sup>3</sup>H-FK506 could not be detected. Finally, we have characterized the developmental and expression pattern of ARA9 in the developing mouse embryo and mapped the ARA9 locus to human chromosome 11q13.3."

Compartmentalization of metabolic processes in eukaryotic cells requires that participating enzymes be transported to their correct subcellular location.

PTS1 consists of a tripeptide located at the C terminus that is characterized by the sequence SKL or conservative variants ((S/A/C)(K/R/H)(L/M)), whereas PTS2 fits the loose (R/K)(L/V/I)X 5(Q/H)(L/A) consensus sequence (6Rachubinski R.A.

PTS1 was originally defined in mammalian cells using various tripeptides extending from heterologous reporter proteins. Peroxisomal matrix proteins, on the other hand, may be directed to the organelle via C-terminal tripeptides that do not match the original consensus. SQL, KKL, SSL, or NKL target alanine/glyoxylate aminotransferase 1 to peroxisomes in human cells (24Motley A. Lumb M.J. Oatey P.B. Jennings P.R. De Zoysa P.A. Wanders R.J.A. Tabak H.F. Danpure C.J.

Hence, it remains unclear why a particular tripeptide not matching the PTS1 consensus succeeds in directing to peroxisomes selected proteins in some organisms but not in others. This may be due to the requirement by the PTS1 receptor (Pex5p) for particular features or neighboring amino acids (26Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 849-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) that could differ between species; however, other components of the import machinery may also be responsible for such differences. To investigate which C-terminal sequences are recognized by Pex5p and whether there are differences between the human and yeast PTS1 receptors, we performed a two-hybrid screen (27Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4795) Google Scholar) using a peptide library that encodes the activation domain of Gal4p extended at the C terminus by random 16-mer peptides (28Yang M. Wu Z. Fields S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1152-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and a detailed analysis of amino acid sequences recognized by the S. cerevisiae or the human Pex5p is presented. Of the different peptides recognized by the two receptors, a number were tested for their ability to target green fluorescent protein (GFP; Ref. 29Prasher D.C. Eckenrode V.K. Ward W.W.

The influence of adjacent amino acid residues on the ability of C-terminal tripeptides to interact with Pex5p was examined in the two-hybrid system and in anin vitro assay where soluble oligopeptides with identical termini were used to compete with immobilized SKL for binding to Pex5p.

Yeast transformants were selected and grown on minimal medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 2% glucose and supplemented with bases and amino acids (20–150 μg/ml) as required (SC-ura or SC-leu-trp). For fluorescence microscopy, transformed wild type yeast cells (CB80) were grown at 30 °C with shaking in selective media with 0.5% glucose as sole carbon source until the glucose concentration was very low (∼0.05%, usually 12–16 h), harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in twice the original volume of induction medium containing 30 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.3% yeast extract, 0.5% peptone, and 0.2% oleate (adjusted to pH 7.0 with NaOH) and 0.02% Tween 80. For fluorescence microscopy, transformedpex5 mutant cells (CB82) were grown in selective media with 2% ethanol as sole carbon source. For quantitative measurement of β-galactosidase activity, yeast cells were grown at 30 °C with shaking in selective medium (2% glucose) overnight, diluted toA 600 = 0.3 into the same medium, and finally harvested at A 600 = 1. Standard procedures were used for cloning (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Double strand sequencing was performed using the T7 sequencing kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Oligonucleotides were purchased from the Institute for Microbiology and Genetics, University of Vienna, Austria. For PCR, DynaZymeTM DNA polymerase from FINNZYMES OY (Espoo, Finland) or Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used. The 900-bp BamHI–PstI fragment from plasmid pAH957 (16Brocard C.

Plasmid hP87 (TPR domain of human Pex5, amino acids 331–639) was constructed by ligating to anEcoRI–SalI-digested pGBT9 a 1-kilobase pairEcoRI–SalI-digested PCR fragment obtained using oligonucleotides H284 and H314 with pPTS1-BP (9Fransen M.

Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). For in frame cloning of DNA sequences coding for PTS1 peptides isolated in the two-hybrid screen, a BamHI restriction site was introduced at the 3′-end of the open reading frame of the GFP, removing the PTS1 codons, and the BamHI site close to the start of the open reading frame was simultaneously destroyed using PCR (oligonucleotides H336, H337, and template pJR233). After inserting the 800-bpKpnI–PstI-digested PCR fragment in pUC18 (39Norrander J. Kempe T. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 26: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar), the KpnI–HindIII fragment of 800 bp was used to replace the KpnI–HindIII fragment from pJR233, resulting in plasmid 233M. Selected sequences coding for interacting C-terminal endings were isolated from the corresponding library plasmids based on pGAD.GH (28Yang M. Wu Z. Fields S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1152-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) as BamHI–HindIII fragments (80 bp) and subsequently cloned into 233M, creating GFP-fusion proteins with different C termini. The sequence coding for K01 (WARGGSGDGGWAYCFC) was obtained from an additional 80-bpBamHI–HindIII insert in one of the isolated library plasmids. Likewise, for in vivo import experiments in human cells, the pEGFP-C3 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used for construction of GFP fusion proteins with various C termini by cloning the 80-bp BamHI–HindIII fragments into the BglII–HindIII-digested plasmid. The oligonucleotides used were H284 (CAAAGATCTGTCGACTCACTGGGGCAGGCC), H313 (TACCACTACAATGGATG), H314 (CACATGAATTCAACCCCTTGCGTGATCAC), H336 (GAAAATGGGTACCCGGGGGTCCAGTAAAGGAGAAG), and H337 (CATGCCTGCAGGCTCTGGATCCTTGGATAGTTCATC). According to the Matchmaker two-hybrid system protocol (CLONTECH), yeast strain PCY3 was transformed successively with pAH987 or hP87 as well as a two-hybrid peptide library (kindly provided by S. Fields), which consisted of 16 NN(T/G) codons fused to the activation domain of the Gal4 protein (28Yang M. Wu Z. Fields S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1152-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Transformants were grown on selective minimal medium (SC-leu-trp), and replica-plated onto selective medium containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-galactopyranoside (X-gal). Blue colonies were restreaked onto the same medium, and library plasmids from blue single colonies were isolated and used to transform cells of PCY3 harboring plasmid pAH987 or hP87. β-Galactosidase activity was tested using filter assays following the Matchmaker protocol, and plasmids from colonies that turned blue in less than 3 h were isolated and amplified in E. coli. The short inserts were sequenced using oligonucleotide primer H313. For determination of β-galactosidase activities, yeast cells were harvested, washed with distilled water, and broken with glass beads. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211864) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activities were measured photometrically at 420 nm using the substrateo-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as described (41Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Two transformants harboring each of the respective plasmids were tested in duplicate, and the β-galactosidase activities presented here were the average of four determinations (S.D. was less than 15%). The units were defined as nmol of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside hydrolyzed per min (41Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

HeLa cells were grown on tissue culture chamber slides (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%) and 2 mml-glutamine plus penicillin, streptomycin, and fungizone in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2. Primary cultured human fibroblasts obtained from a healthy patient were grown in RPMI (1640 medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%) and 2 mml-glutamine plus penicillin, streptomycin, and fungizone). Transfections were performed using DEAE-dextran (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to standard protocols (42Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar) with either 0.5 μg or 1.5 μg of the selected pEGFP plasmids constructed. Cells were used directly for fluorescence microscopy 48 h after transfection or were processed for immunofluorescence as described by Keller et al. (44Keller G.A. Gould S. Deluca M. Subramani S.

A rabbit polyclonal antibody against GFP (CLONTECH) was used as primary antibody, and anti-rabbit Ig horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody from donkey (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as secondary one. To identify C termini with PTS1 function, a two-hybrid peptide library (28Yang M. Wu Z. Fields S.

https://openalex.org/W2071810294,"Lysenin, a hemolytic protein derived from the earthworm Eisenia foetida, has a high affinity for sphingomyelin. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells exhibited a high cytolytic sensitivity to lysenin, but treatment with sphingomyelinase rendered the cells resistant to lysenin. Temperature-sensitive CHO mutant cells defective in sphingolipid synthesis were resistant to lysenin, and this lysenin resistance was suppressed by metabolic complementation of sphingolipids. Selection of lysenin-resistant variants from mutagenized CHO cells yielded two types of sphingomyelin-deficient mutants, both of which showed less lysenin binding capability than wild-type cells. One mutant strain was severely defective in sphingomyelin synthesis but not glycosphingolipid synthesis, and another strain (designated LY-B) was incapable ofde novo synthesis of any sphingolipid species and had no activity of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT; EC 2.3.1.50) catalyzing the first step of sphingolipid biosynthesis. LY-B cells lacked the LCB1 protein, a component of SPT, and transfection of LY-B cells with the hamster LCB1 cDNA restored both SPT activity and sphingolipid synthesis to the cells. Expression of an affinity peptide-tagged LCB1 protein in LY-B cells caused the endogenous LCB2 protein to adsorb to a tag affinity matrix. In addition, an anti-hamster LCB2 protein antibody co-immunoprecipitated both SPT activity and the wild-type LCB1 protein with the LCB2 protein. Thus, cell surface sphingomyelin is essential for lysenin-induced cytolysis, and lysenin is a useful tool for isolation of sphingomyelin-deficient mutants. Moreover, these results demonstrate that the SPT enzyme comprises both the LCB1 and LCB2 proteins.

The most abundant species of sphingolipid in mammalian cells is sphingomyelin (SM), 1The abbreviations used are: SM, sphingomyelin; SMase, sphingomyelinase; SPT, serine palmitoyltransferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazoyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GM3, N-acetylneuraminyl lactosylceramide. 1The abbreviations used are: SM, sphingomyelin; SMase, sphingomyelinase; SPT, serine palmitoyltransferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazoyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GM3, N-acetylneuraminyl lactosylceramide.which amounts to 5–20% of total phospholipids. Sphingolipid biosynthesis is initiated by condensation of l-serine with palmitoyl CoA, a reaction catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT; EC 2.3.1.50) to generate 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (see Ref. 1Merrill Jr., A.H. Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar for a review of sphingolipid biosynthesis). 3-Ketodihydrosphingosine is converted to dihydrosphingosine, which is N-acylated and then dehydrogenated to form ceramide at the endoplasmic reticulum. After moving to the Golgi apparatus, ceramide is converted to sphingomyelin or glycosphingolipids, and these synthesized complex sphingolipids are translocated to the plasma membrane, where they are highly enriched. SPT is suggested to be a key enzyme for regulation of cellular sphingolipid content (1Merrill Jr., A.H. Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Regulation of sphingolipid synthesis at the SPT step appears to be relevant to prevention of a harmful accumulation of metabolic sphingolipid intermediates including sphingoid bases and ceramide, since repression of other anabolic steps in the sphingolipid synthetic pathway may cause the intermediate accumulation. Genetic studies have shown that two different genes,LCB1 and LCB2, are required for expression of SPT activity in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2Buede R. Rinker-Schaffer C. Pinto W.J. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4325-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 3Nagiec M.M. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, mammalian cDNA homologs of the LCB1 andLCB2 genes have been isolated (5Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 177: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 6Weiss B. Stoffel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 7Hanada K. Hara T.

We have demonstrated that expression of the hamster LCB1 cDNA in SPB-1 strain, a temperature-sensitive Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutant defective in SPT, restored SPT activity to the mutant cells and that a hexahistidine (His6)-tagged hamster LCB1 protein but not an untagged protein produced in SPB-1 cells caused SPT activity to adsorb to a Ni2+-immobilized resin, indicating that the hamster LCB1 protein is a component of the SPT enzyme (7Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. Kuge O. Dickson R.C. Nagiec M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32108-32114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). On the other hand, another research group suggested that mammalian SPT did not require expression of an LCB1 protein, based on observations that overexpression of mouse LCB2 cDNA in human embryonic kidney 293 cells enhanced SPT activity in the cells even without co-expression of mouse LCB1 cDNA (6Weiss B. Stoffel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It is thus currently controversial whether the SPT enzyme comprises two different subunits, namely the LCB1 and LCB2 proteins. Lysenin, a 41-kDa protein derived from the coelomic fluid of the earthworm Eisenia foetida, induces hemolysis of mammalian red cells (8Sekizawa Y. Hagiwara K. Nakajima T. Kobayashi H. Biomed. Res. 1996; 17: 197-203Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 9Sekizawa Y. Kubo T. Kobayashi H. Nakajima T. Natori S. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 191: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that lysenin specifically binds to SM among various lipid types in cell-free systems (10Yamaji A. Sekizawa Y. Emoto K. Sakuraba H. Inoue K. Kobayashi H. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5300-5306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, it remained unclear whether cell surface SM was essential for lysenin-induced cytolysis, since the possibility was not eliminated that lysenin could also bind to other components of cells for inducing cytolysis even without cell surface SM. In the present study, we demonstrated that lysenin requires cell surface SM for its cytolytic activity in CHO cells and showed a novel rational method for isolation of SM-deficient cell mutants, which yielded two types of CHO cell mutant strains. By using one mutant strain lacking the LCB1 protein, we demonstrated, for the first time, direct evidence for complex formation of the LCB1 protein with the LCB2 protein in the SPT enzyme. Lysenin purified from the coelomic fluid ofEisenia foetida (8Sekizawa Y. Hagiwara K. Nakajima T. Kobayashi H. Biomed.

Kobayashi (Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Tokyo). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazoyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was purchased from Sigma, and recombinant Bacillus cereus SMase was from Higeta Shoyu (Tokyo, Japan). Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml) was used as the normal culture medium. Nutridoma medium (F-12 medium containing 1% Nutridoma-SP (Boehringer Mannheim) and gentamicin (10 μg/ml)) and Nutridoma-BO medium (Nutridoma medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal calf serum and 10 μm sodium oleate complexed with bovine serum albumin (BSA)) were used as sphingolipid-deficient culture media (11Hanada K. Nishijima M. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Fujita S. Ogawa T. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23527-23533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cells were routinely maintained in the normal culture medium in a 5% CO2atmosphere in 100% humidity at 33 °C. For culture in sphingolipid-deficient medium, CHO cells were incubated in the normal culture medium at 33 °C for several hours and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then cell monolayers were cultured in Nutridoma medium or Nutridoma-BO medium. In some experiments, Nutridoma-BO medium was supplemented withd-erythro-sphingosine (Matreya) or egg SM (Avanti Polar Lipids) as described previously (11Hanada K. Nishijima M. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Fujita S. Ogawa T. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23527-23533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cell monolayers were incubated in 0.5 ml of F-12 medium containing various concentrations of lysenin in 35-mm dishes at 37 °C for 30 min as described in the legends for Figs. 1 and 2. As a background control, cells were incubated in F-12 medium containing 0.1% SDS. After the addition of 0.1 ml of MTT (5 mg/ml in PBS) to the dishes, the cell monolayers were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and then the MTT-containing medium was removed. Formazan produced in the cell monolayers was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 40 mm HCl/propanol-2, and the absorbance at 570 nm of the solution was measured with a spectrophotometer (12Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45053) Google Scholar). The values of the absorbance at 570 nm were corrected by subtraction of the value obtained from the background control, and the corrected values of the absorbance at 570 nm were used as a measure of viability of cells, which was expressed relative to that of lysenin-untreated control cells as 100%.Figure 2Sphingolipid-deficient mutant cells are resistant to lysenin. A, CHO-K1 and SPB-1 cells were cultured in Nutridoma-BO medium at 40 °C for 2 days, and then lipids were extracted from the cells. After separation of the extracted phospholipids by TLC, the amount of SM was determined by lipid phosphorus quantification. The amount of ceramide in the extracted lipids was determined by a diacylglycerol kinase method. The mean values from duplicate experiments are shown. B, after cultivation in Nutridoma-BO medium at 40 °C for 2 days, CHO-K1 and SPB-1 cells were incubated in F-12 medium containing lysenin (200 ng/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. When indicated, 2 μmsphingosine-BSA complex was added daily to Nutridoma-BO medium during the cultivation (the addition of sphingosine alone did not affect the viability of CHO-K1 or SPB-1). Viability of the cells was determined by an MTT method. Each value shown is the mean from duplicate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) CHO-K1 cells (ATCC CCL 61) were mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate as described previously (13Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22137-22142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenized CHO cells (2 × 105cells) were seeded in a 10-cm culture dish containing 5 ml of the normal culture medium and cultured at 33 °C for 1 day. After changing the medium to Nutridoma-BO medium, the cells were further cultured at 37 or 40 °C for 1 or 2 days. The cell monolayers were washed twice with 5 ml of F-12 medium and then incubated in 5 ml of F-12 medium containing lysenin (100 ng/ml) at 37 or 40 °C for 1 h. The cells exposed to lysenin were washed four times with 5 ml of the normal medium. The surviving cells were cultured in 10 ml of the normal culture medium at 33 °C for several days. The propagated cells were reseeded and subjected to a second cycle of the lysenin treatment under essentially the same conditions as described above. After a total of three cycles of the lysenin treatment, colonies of the surviving cells were formed and purified by limiting dilution. After confirming the lysenin resistance of the purified variants, these clones were analyzed further. Metabolic labeling of lipids with [14C]serine in intact cells was performed as described previously (7Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. Kuge O. Dickson R.C. Nagiec M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32108-32114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The rates of the lipid labeling were corrected for protein. For quantification of lipids, CHO cells (3–6 × 106cells) were seeded in a 15-cm culture dish containing 15 ml of the normal culture medium and cultured at 33 °C for 1 day. Then, after washing twice with 10 ml of PBS, the cell monolayers were further cultivated in 25 ml of Nutridoma medium at 40 °C for 2 days. After washing twice with 10 ml of cold PBS, the cells were harvested by scraping, and lipids were extracted from the harvested cells (14Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem.

The amount of ceramide in lipids extracted from cells was determined by a bacterial diacylglycerol kinase method with an assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For determination of N-acetylneuraminyl lactosylceramide (GM3) amounts, lipids were extracted from CHO cells by a modification of the method of Bligh and Dyer (14Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41844) Google Scholar). Namely, 25 mm HCl containing 0.15 m NaCl was used as an aqueous solution for phase separation. Under these mild acidic conditions, GM3 was efficiently partitioned to the organic solvent phase. The extracted lipids were separated on TLC plates with a solvent of chloroform, methanol, 0.2% CaCl2 (80/30/5 by volume) and were stained by a modification of the method of Nakamura and Handa (15Nakamura K. Handa S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, after air drying, the TLC plates were immersed in 25% methanol containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.05% Coomassie Blue for 5 min, gently washed three times in 25% ethanol containing 0.1 m NaCl, and dried under air. Amounts of GM3were determined by densitometric analysis of the stained plates, using a calibration curve made with a standard GM3. The levels of the lipids in cells were corrected for protein. All manipulations were done at room temperature unless noted otherwise. CHO cells were grown on glass coverslips in Nutridoma-BO medium at 40 °C for 2 days to about 50% confluence. After washing with PBS, the monolayers were fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, washed with PBS, incubated with 0.1 mNH4Cl in PBS for 20 min, and washed with PBS. After blocking with 2% BSA in PBS for 1 h, the monolayers were incubated with lysenin (400 ng/ml in 0.2% BSA/PBS) for 1 h and washed three times with PBS for 5 min with gentle shaking. Then the monolayers were incubated with anti-lysenin antiserum (1:500 dilution in 0.2% BSA/PBS) for 1 h and washed with PBS, followed by incubation with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; 1:200 dilution in 0.2% BSA/PBS) for 1 h. After washing with PBS, the monolayers were observed under a Zeiss Axioscope fluorescence microscope. SPT activity in CHO cell lysates was determined as described previously (16Merrill Jr., A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 754: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and corrected for protein. pSV-cLCB1 and pSV-cLCB2, which are cLCB1- and cLCB2-expressing plasmids, respectively, with a G418-resistance determinant (7Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. Kuge O. Dickson R.C. Nagiec M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32108-32114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), were linearized by digestion withPvuI. LY-B cells were transfected with linearized pSV-cLCB1 or pSV-cLCB2 by lipofection with LipofectamineTM reagent (Life Technologies Inc.). After selection for G418 resistance (400 μg/ml), the drug-resistant transfectants were seeded to prepare replicated colonies on polyester disks, and the replicated colonies were assayed for SPT activity as described previously (13Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22137-22142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When LY-B cells were transfected with pSV-cLCB1, about 50% of the G418-resistant colonies recovered SPT activity. One SPT-positive colony of the transformants transfected with pSV-cLCB1 was purified with a cloning cup and was designated the LY-B/cLCB1 clone. Multiple antigenic peptide forms (17Tam J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5409-5413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar) of a 20-mer peptide (TEEELERAASTIREAAQAVL) corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal region of the cLCB1 protein and a 20-mer peptide (RNGYVRSSTATAAAAGQIHH) corresponding to the amino-terminal region of the cLCB2 protein were used as antigens in rabbits. The specific antibodies were purified from the antisera by affinity chromatography with 21-mer peptides (TEEELERAASTIREAAQAVLC for the cLCB1 protein and RNGYVRSSTATAAAAGQIHHC for the cLCB2 protein) linked to a matrix (SulfoLinkTM Coupling Gel, Pierce). For Western blot analysis, protein samples were incubated in SDS-sample buffer at 37 °C for 15 min, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% acrylamide), and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking the blot membrane with 10% skim milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the LCB1 and LCB2 proteins on the membrane were detected by using the anti-cLCB1 antibody and anti-cLCB2 antibody (0.5 μg/ml), respectively, as the primary antibody and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad; 1:2500 dilution) as the secondary antibody with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), unless otherwise noted. After transfection of LY-B cells with plasmid pSV-HTcLCB1, which encodes a His6-tagged cLCB1 protein (7Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. Kuge O. Dickson R.C. Nagiec M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32108-32114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), transformants having SPT were identified by an in situ SPT assay, and one purified clone was designated LY-B/HTcLCB1. All manipulations were done at 4 °C or on ice unless noted otherwise. Membranes were prepared from CHO cells cultured in spinner bottles at 37 °C as described previously (18Hanada K. Horii M. Akamatsu Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1086: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Stock suspension of 1% soybean phospholipids (asolectin; Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) was prepared by sonication. The membranes (2 mg of protein) were incubated in 1 ml of a solubilization buffer consisting of 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.1% soybean phospholipids, and 1% sucrose monolaurate (Mitsubishi Kasei Shokuhin Inc., Tokyo, Japan) for 10 min. After centrifugation (105 × g, 30 min) of the sample, 0.6 ml of the supernatant fluid was incubated with 50 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h with gentle shaking. The resin was precipitated by centrifuging for 1 min at 2000 × g, and the supernatant fluid was recovered as an unadsorbed fraction. After washing three times with 1 ml of the solubilization buffer, the resin was incubated with 0.6 ml of an elution buffer consisting of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 0.1 m imidazole, 0.1% soybean phospholipids, and 1% sucrose monolaurate for 10 min with gentle shaking. After precipitating the resin, the supernatant fluid was recovered as an adsorbed fraction. The recovered fractions were assayed for SPT activity and analyzed for distribution of the LCB1 and LCB2 proteins by Western blotting. All manipulations were done at 4 °C or on ice unless noted otherwise. A suspension (10 μl of bed volume) of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.3 ml of PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.1% NaN3 was incubated with 5 μg of the anti-cLCB2 antibody or a control preimmune IgG overnight. The resultant resin was washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.1% NaN3 and three times with 50 mmHepes-Na (pH 7.5) containing 1% sucrose monolaurate, prior to immunoprecipitation assay. Membranes (0.8 mg of protein) prepared from CHO-K1 cells were incubated in 0.4 ml of 50 mm Hepes-Na (pH 7.5) containing 1% sucrose monolaurate for 10 min, and after centrifugation (105 × g, 30 min) the supernatant fluid was recovered as the solubilized membrane fraction. A portion (0.2 ml) of the solubilized membrane fraction was incubated with the pretreated resin for 3 h with shaking. After precipitating the resin (104 × g, 10 s), the supernatant fluid was recovered as the nonimmunoprecipitable fraction. The precipitated resin was washed four times with 0.5 ml of 50 mm Hepes-Na (pH 7.5) containing 1% sucrose monolaurate and incubated in 0.2 ml of SDS-sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min. After precipitating the resin, the supernatant fluid was recovered as the immunoprecipitable fraction. The solubilized membrane and nonimmunoprecipitable fractions were assayed for SPT activity and also analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitable fractions was performed by using biotinylated antibodies as the primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptoavidin (Pierce) as the secondary probe for the enhanced chemiluminescence detection. The blot membrane was blocked with 5% BSA in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Biotinylation of the anti-cLCB1 and anti-cLCB2 antibodies was performed with EZ-LinkTM sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using BSA as the standard. CHO-K1 fibroblasts were exposed to various concentrations of lysenin at 37 °C for 30 min, and then their viability was determined. The cells were killed by lysenin in a dose-dependent manner; the LD50 of lysenin was about 35 ng/ml, and exposure to lysenin at more than 200 ng/ml resulted in nearly complete loss of the viability (Fig.1 A). To explore whether cell surface SM was responsible for the lysenin-induced cytolysis, we examined the effect of SMase treatment of cells on lysenin-induced cytolysis. CHO-K1 cells were incubated with various concentrations of B. cereus SMase for 1 h and then exposed to lysenin at 200 ng/ml for 30 min. As shown in Fig.1 B, the SMase treatment dramatically rendered the cells resistant to lysenin, depending on the concentration of SMase, whereas SMase treatment alone without exposure to lysenin did not affect the viability of the cells. When cells were pretreated with SMase at more than 2 milliunits/ml, the cells maintained 100% viability even after the lysenin-treatment (Fig. 1 B). Treatment of CHO-K1 cells with SMase (2 milliunits/ml) resulted in degradation of about 70% of cellular SM with an equivalent increase in the ceramide content (data not shown). These results suggested that depletion of cell surface SM or accumulation of ceramide by SMase treatment caused the lysenin resistance of the cells. We determined whether reduction of SM level without accumulation of ceramide increased the resistance of cells to lysenin. For this, we used a CHO mutant strain (SPB-1 strain) in which de novo sphingolipid synthesis stops at nonpermissive temperatures because of thermolabile SPT activity (11Hanada K. Nishijima M. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Fujita S. Ogawa T. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23527-23533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22137-22142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When cells were cultured in a sphingolipid-deficient medium at 40 °C for 2 days, SM and ceramide levels in SPB-1 cells were reduced to about 30% and less than 5%, respectively, of the wild-type levels (Fig.2 A). After culture under the sphingolipid-deficient conditions, the cells were exposed to lysenin at 200 ng/ml for 30 min. More than 70% of SPB-1 cells exposed to lysenin survived, compared with less than 10% of the wild-type cells (Fig.2 B). When the SM level in SPB-1 cells was restored by the addition of sphingosine to the culture medium for metabolic utilization (11Hanada K. Nishijima M. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Fujita S. Ogawa T. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23527-23533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6254-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), the lysenin resistance of the mutant cells was suppressed (Fig. 2 B). Collectively, these results demonstrated that reduction of SM level in cells conferred lysenin resistance to the cells. We next attempted to isolate SM-deficient mutants by selecting lysenin-resistant variants of CHO cells. Mutagenized CHO-K1 cells were cultured in a sphingolipid-deficient medium for 1–2 days and then exposed to lysenin (100 ng/ml) for 1 h. More than 95% of the cells were killed in the initial exposure to lysenin. After propagation of the survivors in the normal medium, the cells were challenged by the lysenin treatment two more times, and clones of the survivors were purified. We screened a total number of about 2 × 106 mutagenized cells and eventually isolated 27 lysenin-resistant clones. During the screening, cells were propagated at 33 °C and exposed to lysenin at 37 or 40 °C, because lysenin-resistant variants might be temperature-sensitive for growth. However, none of the lysenin-resistant clones obtained in this study exhibited stringent temperature sensitivity for growth (data not shown; see also below). De novo synthetic rates of sphingolipids in these lysenin-resistant mutants were compared by metabolic labeling of lipids with [14C]serine at 40 °C for 2 h. Based on the activity of de novo sphingolipid synthesis, we tentatively classified the lysenin-resistant clones into three types, as summarized in Table I. In type I mutants (clones 1–11), the de novo synthetic rate of SM was less than 20% of the wild-type level, while the synthetic rate of glucosylceramide was more than 50% of the wild-type level. Type II mutants (clones 13, 15, 16, 17, 20, and 21) could not appreciably synthesize SM, glucosylceramide, or ceramide. In type III mutants (clones 14, 18, 23, 24, 28, 32, 33, 35, 37, and 40), the synthetic rate of SM was nearly normal (more than 70% of the wild-type level).Table IClassification of lysenin-resistant CHO mutant clonesMutagen treatmentaBatch number of mutagen treatment from which the lysenin-resistant variants were selected.Lysenin-resistant clone numberSphingolipid synthesisMutant typeSMGlcCerbGlucosylceramide.CeramideBatch 11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (LY-A),cThe lysenin-resistant clones 6 and 16 are also referred to as LY-A and LY-B, respectively. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11−++Type IBatch 213, 15, 16 (LY-B),cThe lysenin-resistant clones 6 and 16 are also referred to as LY-A and LY-B, respectively. 20, 21−−−Type IIBatch 214, 18+++Type IIIBatch 323, 24, 27, 28, 32, 33, 35, 37, 40+++Type IIINone(Wild type CHO-K1)+++CHO cells were incubated with [14C]serine at 40 °C for 2 h, and then radioactivity incorporated into the indicated sphingolipids was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Relative levels of the labeled sphingolipid species in the lysenin-resistant clones are shown: −, less than 20% of the wild-type lev"
https://openalex.org/W2068994296,"Overexpression and amplification of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor (Met) have been detected in many types of human cancers, suggesting a critical role for Met in growth and development of malignant cells. However, the molecular mechanism by which Met contributes to tumorigenesis is not well known. The tyrosine kinase c-Src has been implicated as a modulator of cell proliferation, spreading, and migration; these functions are also regulated by Met. To explore whether c-Src kinase is involved in HGF-induced cell growth, a mouse mammary carcinoma cell line (SP1) that co-expresses HGF and Met and a nonmalignant epithelial cell line (Mv1Lu) that expresses Met but not HGF were used. In this study, we have shown that c-Src kinase activity is constitutively elevated in SP1 cells and is induced in response to HGF in Mv1Lu cells. In addition, c-Src kinase associates with Met following stimulation with HGF. The enhanced activity of c-Src kinase also correlates with its ability to associate with Met. Expression of a dominant negative double mutant of c-Src (SRC-RF), lacking both kinase activity (K295R) and a regulatory tyrosine residue (Y527F), in SP1 cells significantly reduced c-Src kinase activity and strongly blocked HGF-induced motility and colony growth in soft agar. In contrast, expression of the dominant negative c-Src mutant had no effect on HGF-induced cell proliferation on plastic. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that HGF-induced association of c-Src with Met and c-Src activation play a critical role in HGF-induced cell motility and anchorage-independent growth of mammary carcinomas and further support the notion that the presence of paracrine and autocrine HGF loops contributes significantly to the transformed phenotype of carcinoma cells.

However, the molecular mechanism by which HGF binding to its receptor elicits cell transformation is not fully understood. A number of cytoplasmic signaling proteins, such as phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, Grb2, Shc, Ras, and c-Src, have been shown to be involved in Met-dependent signal transduction pathways (17Zhu H. Naujokas M.A. Fixman E.D. Torossian K. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29943-29948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Maina F. dalla Zonca P.

It is important to establish which of these signaling proteins regulate Met-dependent steps in tumor progression, because different signaling proteins may regulate various HGF-induced cellular functions, including mitogenic, motogenic, and morphogenic signals in target cells (18Ponzetto C.

The HGF-mediated signaling pathway is further complicated by the observation that the majority of SH2-containing cytoplasmic effectors bind to a single multifunctional docking site on the cytoplasmic domain of Met, whereas a second site is required for Grb2 binding (17Zhu H.

However, to study the role of specific SH2-containing cytoplasmic effectors in HGF receptor function, approaches to target individual cytoplasmic effectors are required. Recently, we (26Rahimi N.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Activation of c-Src tyrosine kinase in transgenic mice induces mammary epithelial hyperplasias and is required, but is not sufficient, for induction of mammary tumors in polyoma virus middle T-transgenic mice (42Guy C.T. Muthuswamy S.K. Cardiff R.D. Soriano P. Muller W.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 43Webster M.A. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7849-7853Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Altogether, these observations support the notion that increased c-Src kinase activity in mammary carcinomas plays an important role in mammary tumor growth and development. However, the role of c-Src kinase in HGF-induced functions in mammary carcinoma cells is not clearly known. To analyze whether c-Src kinase is involved in HGF-induced mammary carcinoma cell growth, we used a mouse mammary carcinoma cell line, SP1, which expresses HGF and tyrosine-phosphorylated Met, thereby generating an autocrine HGF loop in these cells (44Rahimi N. Tremblay E. McAdam L. Park M. Schwall R. Elliott B. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 263-270PubMed Google Scholar). Our current results demonstrate that c-Src kinase activity is elevated in SP1 cells, compared with nonmalignant Mv1Lu epithelial cells. The increased activity of c-Src kinase correlates with its ability to associate with tyrosine-phosphorylated Met. We therefore examined the effect of expressing a dominant negative mutant form of c-Src on c-Src kinase activity and HGF-induced cell motility and anchorage-independent growth of SP1 carcinoma cells. Taken together, our findings show that c-Src kinase activation plays a significant role in HGF-induced cell motility and anchorage-independent growth, characteristics of the transformed phenotype. Rabbit anti-sheep IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (Westgrove, PN). Mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KT). Rabbit anti-c-Src IgG, anti-Met (mouse) IgG, and anti-PLC-γ1 IgG were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (San Diego, CA). Mv1Lu cells are members of a mink lung epithelial cell line obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MA). Maintenance medium for Mv1Lu cells was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS. The SP1 tumor cell line is derived from a spontaneous poorly metastatic murine mammary intraductal adenocarcinoma and expresses HGF and Met. The characteristics of the SP1 cell line have been described elsewhere (45Rahimi N. Saulnier R. Nakamura T. Park M. Elliott B. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar,46Elliott B.E. Tam S.P. Dexter D. Chen Z.Q. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 51: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Maintenance medium for SP1 cells was RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 7% FBS (Life Technologies, Inc.). cDNAs encoding wild typec-src (SRC) and a dominant negative double mutant ofc-src (SRC-RF) with loss-of-function mutations in the kinase domain (K295R) and a regulatory tyrosine residue (Y527F) ligated into the pRc/CMV plasmid (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) carrying the neomycin resistance marker were obtained from Dr. J. Brugge (47Mukhoupadhyay D. Tsiokas L. Zhou X.M. Foster D. Brugge J.S. Sukhatme V.P. Nature. 1995; 375: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). SP1 cells expressing the mutant c-Src and wild type c-Src were established using the stable transfection LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) method (48Seth P. Brinkmann U. Schwartz G.N. Katayose D. Gress R. Pastan I. Cowan K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1346-1351PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, SP1 cells were grown to 80% confluence. The DNA (1 μg) was mixed with LipofectAMINE reagent (9 μl) in 200 μl of serum-free medium and was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Before transfection, cells were washed once with 2 ml of serum-free medium. For each transfection, the mixed DNA and LipofectAMINE were combined with 0.8 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, and the cells were incubated with this transfection mixture. After 5 h of incubation, an equal volume of RPMI/14% FBS was added to the transfection medium, and incubation proceeded for an additional 24 h. For most experiments, pooled transfected cells selected with G418 (450 μg/ml) were used. In one experiment, SP1 cells were transfected with SRC-RF or SRC, and clones were isolated and tested for Src kinase activity and colony forming efficiency. Cell proliferation was carried out as described elsewhere (45Rahimi N. Saulnier R. Nakamura T. Park M. Elliott B. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, SP1 carcinoma cells and Mv1Lu cells were plated at 104cells/well in 24-well plates under the various conditions indicated. DNA synthesis was measured by adding 0.2 μCi of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Oakville, ON, Canada) at 24 h. After an additional 24 h, cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA. Aliquots of cells were placed in 96-well microtiter plates and transferred to filters using a Titertek cell harvester (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), and [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured in a scintillation counter (Beckman, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Results are expressed as the mean cpm/well ± S.D. of triplicates. Colony growth assays were performed as described previously (49Saulnier R. Bhardwaj B. Klassen J. Leopold D. Rahimi N. Tremblay E. Mosher D. Elliott B. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 360-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, a solution of 1.2% Bactoagar (Difco Lab) was mixed (1:1) with 2× RPMI 1640, supplemented with FBS at final concentrations of 7 or 1% alone or with HGF as indicated, and layered onto 60 × 15-mm tissue culture plates. SP1 cells (103/2.5 ml) were mixed in a 0.36% Bactoagar solution prepared in a similar way and layered (2.5 ml/plate) on top of the 0.6% Bactoagar layer. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 8–10 days. Colonies were fixed with methanol, stained with Giemsa, and counted manually. Results are expressed as mean number of colonies per dish ± S.D. of quadruplicates. To measure cell motility, Transwell culture inserts (8-μm pore size) (Costar, Toronto, ON, Canada) were coated uniformly with gelatin (0.25% w/v, Sigma, Oakville, ON, Canada) on both sides for 2 min at room temperature (50Boyer B. Roche S. Denoyelle M. Thiery J.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5904-5913Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Membranes were washed twice with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and inserted into a 24-well culture plate (Costar, Toronto, ON, Canada) with 1 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were grown to 50% confluence, serum-starved overnight, and harvested in 5 mm EDTA. Cells (2 × 104/100 μl) were plated in the insert and incubated for 6–8 h at 37 °C. Following the incubation, excess medium was removed, and cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 15 min and stained with hematoxylin (Fisher, Oakville, ON, Canada). Cells on the upper side of the membrane were removed by wiping with cotton. Cells on the under side of the membrane were counted using an inverted microscope with phase contrast illumination. Cell motility is expressed as the number of migrating cells per well. In a parallel study, a wounding assay was performed, as described previously (36Rodier J-M. Vallés A.M. Denoyelle M. Thiery J.P. Boyer B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, monolayers of each cell type were “wounded” by scraping with an Eppendorf yellow tip, washed, and incubated alone or with HGF for varying times. Migration was assessed visually by the ability of cells to close the wounded area. Cells were grown to confluence and serum-starved for 24 h. Cells were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline three times and lysed in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EGTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm in an IEC/Micromax centrifuge at 4 °C. Protein concentration of supernatants was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). Equal protein amounts from each cell lysate were incubated with the indicated antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h or overnight. Immunoprecipitates were collected on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed three times with lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked for 15 min with 3% skimmed milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), and probed for 1 h with the indicated antibodies. The membrane was washed three times for 5 min each with TBST buffer, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies for 15 min, and washed three times with TBST for 10 min each time. Immune complexes were detected using ECL (Amersham). In most experiments, anin vitro c-Src kinase assay using enolase as a substrate was performed as described previously (51Atfi A. Drobetsky E. Boissonneault M. Chapdelaine A. Chevalier S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30688-30693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates from SP1 and Mv1Lu cells were prepared, and equal protein amounts from each cell lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Src IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described above. The amount of anti-c-Src IgG was pre-determined to be in excess over c-Src protein, indicating that the majority of c-Src protein in cell lysates is immunoprecipitated (data not shown). One-half of each immunoprecipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and Western blot analysis to confirm the amount of c-Src protein present. The other half of each immunoprecipitate was assayed for c-Src kinase activity, by incubating with 10 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 μmNa3VO4), 1 μl of freshly prepared acid-denatured enolase (Sigma) (5 μg of enolase + 1 μl of 50 mm HCl incubated at 30 °C for 10 min then neutralized with 1 μl of 1 m PIPES, pH 7.0), and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 10 min of incubation at 30 °C, reactions were terminated by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer, and samples were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. Serine and threonine phosphorylations were hydrolyzed by incubating the acrylamide gel in 1m KOH at 45 °C for 30 min, followed by fixing in 45% MeOH and 10% acetic acid for 30 min at room temperature and drying for 2 h at 80 °C under a vacuum. Autoradiograms were produced and quantitated using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). In some experiments (see Fig. 3), c-Src kinase activity was assayed according to Cheng et al. (52Cheng H. Nishio H. Hatase O. Ralph S. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9248-9256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the c-Src tyrosine kinase family-specific cdc2 peptide substrate. Anti-c-Src or anti-Met immunoprecipitates prepared as above were incubated with 40 μl of a reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.4 mm EGTA, 0.4 mm Na3VO4, 40 mm Mg(OAc)2), 5 μl of cdc2 peptide (Life Technologies, Inc., 250 μm/assay), 5 μl of cold ATP (25 μm), and 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. A control consisting of immunoprecipitation with anti-Met IgG under more stringent conditions with RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) where c-Src would not be co-precipitated was also carried out. After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid and incubated for an additional 5 min. Aliquots subsequently were blotted on to p81 paper (Whatman, Fisher, Ottawa, ON, Canada). The p81 paper was washed three times (5 min/wash) with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once with acetone at room temperature, and the radiolabeled c-Src kinase substrate was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Cell lysates from SP1 and Mv1Lu cells were prepared, and equal protein amounts of each lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-Met IgG as described above. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with cold lysis buffer and once with cold kinase buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 μmNa3VO4). In vitro Met kinase activity was determined by incubating immunoprecipitates with 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2× SDS sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were boiled for 3 min and subjected to 7% SDS-PAGE. Serine and threonine phosphorylations were hydrolyzed by incubating the acrylamide gel in 1m KOH at 45 °C for 30 min, followed by fixing and drying as described above. Autoradiograms were produced and quantitated using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). SP1 carcinoma cells express HGF and tyrosine-phosphorylated Met, consistent with an HGF autocrine loop in these cells (44Rahimi N. Tremblay E. McAdam L. Park M. Schwall R. Elliott B. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 263-270PubMed Google Scholar). To test the possibility that activation of c-Src kinase may be involved in Met-induced signaling pathways, we measured the kinase activity of c-Src in SP1 carcinoma cells and an HGF-sensitive epithelial cell line, Mv1Lu. c-Src kinase activity was measured by the capacity of c-Src immunoprecipitates from these cells to tyrosine phosphorylate the substrate, enolase. c-Src immunoprecipitates from serum-starved SP1 cells showed a pronounced elevated kinase activity, which increased only slightly following treatment with exogenous HGF (Fig. 1). In contrast, c-Src kinase activity in Mv1Lu cells was highly dependent on stimulation of cells with exogenous HGF (Fig. 1). The levels of c-Src kinase activity observed correlated with the constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of Met (44Rahimi N. Tremblay E. McAdam L. Park M. Schwall R. Elliott B. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 263-270PubMed Google Scholar) and in vitro Met kinase activity (data not shown) in SP1 cells, and the HGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Met in Mv1Lu cells (Ref. 26Rahimi N. Tremblay E. Elliott B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24850-24855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and data not shown). It is conceivable that the high level of c-Src kinase activity in SP1 cells, could have resulted from interaction of c-Src with activated Met due to an autocrine HGF loop in these cells (44Rahimi N. Tremblay E. McAdam L. Pa"

Here, we studied H69-VP cells that, due to a homozygous mutation, express topoisomerase IIα mostly outside the nucleus. In these cells topoisomerase IIβ showed a normal nuclear localization. However, at mitosis it diffused away from the chromatin despite the nuclear lack of the α-isoform. 80% of these cells performed chromosome condensation and disjunction with the aid of cytosolic topoisomerase IIα, which bound to the mitotic chromatin with low affinity. However, the genotype of these cells was highly polyploid indicating an increased rate of non-disjunction. In 20% of the mutant cells neither topoisomerase II isoform was bound to the mitotic chromatin, which appeared as an unstructured DNA spheroid unable to undergo disjunction and cytokinesis. Parental H69 cells expressing topoisomerase IIα inside the nucleus exhibited high affinity binding of the enzyme to the mitotic chromatin. Their genotype was mostly diploid and stable. We conclude (i) that high affinity chromatin binding of topoisomerase IIα is essential for chromosome condensation/disjunction and (ii) that topoisomerase IIβ does not adopt these functions.

We conclude (i) that high affinity chromatin binding of topoisomerase IIα is essential for chromosome condensation/disjunction and (ii) that topoisomerase IIβ does not adopt these functions. Type II DNA topoisomerases catalyze complex topological changes in the genome by passing intact DNA double helices through transient breaks in another DNA double strand. They play a crucial role in chromosome condensation and disjunction, although their precise function in these processes is still somewhat controversial (1Warburton P.E. Earnshaw W.C. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast to yeast and insects, which have only one form of DNA topoisomerase II, there exist two isoforms (α and β) in mammals, which are encoded by separate genes (2Tsai-Pflugfelder M. Liu L.F. Liu A.A. Tewey K.M. Whang-Peng J. Knutsen T. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7177-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 3Jenkins J.R. Ayton P.

The two isoenzymes share a high degree of structural homology and have similar enzymatic properties (4Drake F.H. Hofmann G.A. Bartus H.F. Mattern M.R. Crooke S.T. Mirabelli C.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8154-8160Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). However, they show different patterns of spatial organization both on the level of the cell (5Chaly N. Chen X. Dentry J. Brown D. Chromosome Res. 1996; 4: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 6Meyer K.N. Kjeldsen E. Straub T. Knudsen B.K. Kikuchi A. Hickson I.D. Kreipe H. Boege F. J.

Cancer. 1997; 75: 1340-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In a given tissue the β-isoenzyme is found in virtually every cell, whereas the α-isoenzyme is restricted to proliferative compartments (7Turley H. Comley M. Houlbrook S. Nozaki N. Kikuchi A. Hickson I.D. Gatter K. Harris A.L. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 75: 1340-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cells in the cell cycle express both isoenzymes, but the subcellular localization is very different. The α-form localizes to the inside of nucleoli (6Meyer K.N. Kjeldsen E. Straub T. Knudsen B.K. Kikuchi A. Hickson I.D. Kreipe H. Boege F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and clusters at centromeric regions (8Rattner J.B. Hendzel M.J. Furbee C.S. Muller M.T. Bazett-Jones D.P. J.

Straub T. Knudsen B.K. Kikuchi A. Hickson I.D. Kreipe H. Boege F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In mitosis the β-isoenzyme diffuses away from the chromatin, whereas the α-isoenzyme becomes up-regulated (9Woessner R.D. Mattern M.R. Mirabelli C.K. Johnson R.K. Drake F.H.

Chromosome Res. 1996; 4: 4-15Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). There are indications that the α-isoenzyme in its chromosome-bound state is mostly catalytically inactive, whereas the β-isoenzyme sustains a diffusible type II topoisomerase activity throughout the cell cycle (6Meyer K.N. Kjeldsen E. Straub T. Knudsen B.K. Kikuchi A. Hickson I.D. Kreipe H. Boege F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that the two isoforms of mammalian DNA-topoisomerase II serve different functions during the cell cycle and particularly in mitosis. However, it is unknown whether these functions are unique.The most straightforward approach would be to block expression of one isoenzyme. However, it has turned out that at least for the α-form this cannot be done without abrogating cell proliferation. Therefore, we have chosen an indirect approach studying cells, which express DNA-topoisomerase IIα outside the nucleus. Such a model is provided by the cell line H69-VP, which was selected from the human small cell lung cancer cell line NCI-H69 by continuous treatment with etoposide (VP-16) (14Jensen P.B. Christensen I.J. Sehested M. Hansen H.H. Vindelov L. Br. J. Cancer. 1993; 67: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The subclone has a homozygous deletion of 9 nucleotides in the gene of human topoisomerase IIα encoding amino acid residues 1490–1492 (KSK), which are part of a cluster of potential nuclear localization sequences in the carboxyl terminus of the enzyme (15Mirski S.E.L. Gerlach J. Cummings H. Zirngibl R. Greer P. Cole S. Exp. Cell. Res. 1997; 237: 452-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The deleted sequence seems to be essential for nuclear translocation of the enzyme (16Wessel I. Jensen P.B. Falck J. Mirski S.E.L. Cole S.P.C. Sehested M. Cancer. Res. 1997; 57: 4451-4454PubMed Google Scholar).

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2129-2134PubMed Google Scholar), H69-VP cells are particularly suited for this study, because their mutation is homozygous and does not affect functional properties of the enzyme (16Wessel I. Jensen P.B. Falck J. Mirski S.E.L. Cole S.P.C. Sehested M. Cancer. Res. 1997; 57: 4451-4454PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that in these cells the mitotic functions of topoisomerase IIα are not adopted by topoisomerase IIβ.RESULTSExtranuclear Expression of Active Topoisomerase IIαThe subclone H69-VP carrying a homozygous mutation of the nuclear localization sequence of the topoisomerase IIα gene contained similar amounts of topoisomerase II activity as the parental cell line H69-WT. This became apparent when serial dilutions of whole cell extracts of log cultures were assessed for DNA decatenation (Fig.1 a). Moreover, the two cell lines expressed similar amounts of topoisomerase IIα and -β antigens, as demonstrated by probing Western blots of whole cell lysates with isoenzyme-specific antibodies (Fig. 1 b, lanes 1and 2). However, major differences between the two cell clones became apparent, when the subcellular organization of topoisomerase II isoforms was assessed. We disrupted the cells by combined hypotonic treatment and mechanical shearing, separated cytosol and nuclei by centrifugation, and analyzed the amounts of topoisomerase IIα and -β in the cytosolic fractions and the nuclei by immunoblotting (Fig. 1 b, lanes 3–6). The parental H69-WT cells expressed both isoforms mostly in the nucleus (Fig. 1 b, lane 5), whereas only minor fractions (20%) of both isoenzymes were detectable in the cytosol (Fig. 1 b, lane 3). In contrast, the mutant cells expressed the α-isoenzyme mainly (>95%) in the cytosol (lane 4). Only a minor fraction (less than 5%) was detectable in the nuclei (lane 6). In contrast, the majority of the β-isoenzyme was present in the nuclei of both cell lines (Fig. 1 b, lane 6). In agreement with previous data (16Wessel I. Jensen P.B. Falck J. Mirski S.E.L. Cole S.P.C. Sehested M. Cancer. Res. 1997; 57: 4451-4454PubMed Google Scholar), this pattern could indicate that the mutant α-isoenzyme cannot gain access to the nuclei of H69-VP cells. However, it could equally well reflect an attenuation of nuclear translocation resulting in an altered equilibrium between cytosolic and nuclear pools of the enzyme, which are both active and readily exchangeable. To exclude the latter possibility, we treated the cells with the topoisomerase II poison teniposide (VM-26). The drug stabilizes a covalent catalytic intermediate of topoisomerase II and DNA, trapping the active fraction of topoisomerase II in covalent DNA-complexes too large to migrate into a polyacrylamide gel. Consequently, enzymes catalytically interacting with the genome will be depleted from the immunoblot. A representative result is demonstrated in Fig. 1 c. In the parental cell line VM-26 caused an almost complete immuno-band depletion of both topoisomerase II isoforms in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 c, lanes 5 and 6), indicating that the full cellular complement of both isoforms is engaged in catalytic DNA turnover. In contrast, in the mutant cell line (Fig. 1 c, line 1–4) only the β-isoform became depleted, whereas the α-isoform was not notably targeted by VM-26 even at concentrations as high as 200 μm. A similar lack in band depletion of the mutant α-isoform has previously been observed using the catalytic topoisomerase II inhibitor ICRF-187 (16Wessel I. Jensen P.B. Falck J. Mirski S.E.L. Cole S.P.C. Sehested M. Cancer. Res. 1997; 57: 4451-4454PubMed Google Scholar). These results could indicate that the major part of the mutant α-isoenzyme does not interact with the genome of the cell. However, similar results would also be obtained if the mutant enzyme was engaged in DNA turnover, but resistant to the drug, or if the mutant enzyme was inactive. In order to exclude these last two possibilities, we checked the activity of topoisomerase II in the cytosolic fraction of H69-VP cells and its susceptibility to VM-26 treatment. The data shown in Fig. 1 d confirm that cytosolic topoisomerase IIα of H69-VP cells was catalytically active (Fig.1 d, lane 5) and could be blocked by VM-26 (Fig.1 d, lanes 6 and 7) in a cell-free system. Thus, the lack of drug-induced band depletion of the mutant topoisomerase IIα inside the cells (Fig. 1 c) must be due to the fact that the major part of the mutant enzyme is unable to enter the nucleus.Chromosome Condensation and DisjunctionThe data in Fig. 1 corroborate previous findings (16Wessel I. Jensen P.B. Falck J. Mirski S.E.L. Cole S.P.C. Sehested M. Cancer. Res. 1997; 57: 4451-4454PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that H69-VP cells proliferate under conditions where the β-isoenzyme of topoisomerase II is predominantly present in the nucleus and engaged in DNA processing, whereas the mutant α-isoform (although catalytically active) appears to be mostly (>95%) excluded from the nucleus. The mutant cell line did not exhibit increased levels of topoisomerase IIα or -β nor an increase in overall cellular topoisomerase II activity, as compared with the parental cells (Fig. 1,a and b), indicating that the lack of nuclear topoisomerase IIα did not stimulate up-regulation of either topoisomerase II isoform. These observations seemed to suggest that topoisomerase IIα is dispensable for cell proliferation or can at least be complemented by the β-isoform to such an extent that an up-regulation of the enzyme is not required for maintaining unattenuated cell proliferation. From our previous localization studies (6Meyer K.N. Kjeldsen E. Straub T. Knudsen B.K. Kikuchi A. Hickson I.D. Kreipe H. Boege F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we knew that usually during mitosis only the α-form binds to the chromosomal scaffold, whereas the β-isoenzyme becomes excluded from the condensed chromatin. If these functions were adopted by topoisomerase IIβ, we would expect the β-isoenzyme to localize to the chromosomal scaffold of the mutant cell line in a similar fashion as normally seen with the α-isoenzyme. To test this assumption, we studied localizations of topoisomerases IIα and -β in whole cells (Fig. 2) and chromosomal metaphase spreads (Fig. 3).Figure 2Fluorescent images (× 630 magnification) of parental H69-WT cells (a) and the mutant subclone H69-VP (b) at various stages of the cell cycle.

In each case images of the same chromosomal metaphase spread are shown, which were simultaneously stained for topoisomerase IIα (left), DNA (middle), and topoisomerase IIβ (right).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Representative fluorescent images of parental H69-WT cells simultaneously stained for topoisomerase IIα, -β, and DNA (Fig.2 a) resembled patterns previously observed in human A431 cells (6Meyer K.N.

In interphase, the α-isoform had a mostly homogeneous distribution in the nucleoplasm, whereas the β-isoform had a highly inhomogeneous reticular distribution in the nucleus. In prometaphase most of the β-isoenzyme diffused into the cytosol and remained there until anaphase, whereas the majority of the α-isoenzyme bound to the condensing chromatin. In chromosomes of parental H69-cells the α-isoform aligned in the axes of the chromosome arms (Fig.3 b). Representative fluorescent images of the mutant H69-VP cells simultaneously stained for topoisomerase IIα, -β, and DNA (Fig. 2 b) confirmed that in interphase the majority of topoisomerase IIα was localized in the cytosol and not in the nucleus, whereas the β-isoenzyme exhibited a nuclear pattern similar to interphases of the parental cell line. However an unexpected result was obtained with mitotic H69-VP cells. The β-isoenzyme did not bind to the chromosomal scaffold but rather diffused into the cytosol and remained excluded from the chromatin throughout mitosis, just like in the parental cells. These observations indicated that topoisomerase IIβ did not substitute for the lacking α-isoenzyme and suggested that none of the type II topoisomerases was required for mitosis. However, from the unusual aspects of the mitotic figures of H69-VP cells and in particular from the staining patterns of topoisomerase IIα in such cells, it became apparent that lack of topoisomerase IIα in the nucleus had a significant effect on chromatin condensation and disjunction. Two distinct types of mitotic events could be discriminated as indicated below.Metaphase Type I (DNA-ball)In about 20% of mitotic H69-VP cells an abortive type of mitosis was observed (Fig. 2 b,Meta Type I). Neither topoisomerase IIα nor -β were bound to the chromatin, which appeared highly condensed and unstructured. Fig. 3 a shows a high resolution image of such metaphases from two views. The DNA appeared to be contracted into the shape of a flattened melon, and both topoisomerase II isoforms were excluded from this DNA spheroid with the exception of two spots, which according to our previous investigations (6Meyer K.N. Kjeldsen E. Straub T. Knudsen B.K. Kikuchi A. Hickson I.D. Kreipe H. Boege F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) probably represent cross-reactions of our topoisomerase IIα antibodies with centrosomes. When H69-VP cells were first brought into accelerated growth by increased serum supplementation and subsequently blocked in metaphase with demecolcine, this abortive type of metaphase occurred with high frequency (80% of the cells). After removal of the block these cells did not continue to grow, but died after a few days, indicating that the ball-shaped chromatin condensed in the absence of topoisomerase II could not be further processed.Metaphase Type II (Chromosomes)Under normal growth conditions about 80% of the metaphases of logarithmically growing H69-VP cells appeared as shown in Fig. 2 b (Meta Type II). These cells contained chromosome-like DNA structures, which were apparently devoid of topoisomerase IIβ, but clearly stained for topoisomerase IIα. Metaphase spreads prepared from H69-WT and H69-VP cells blocked with demecolcine under normal growth conditions and visualized at high resolution are shown in Fig. 3 b. The images are grouped in vertical pairs, the top one showing parental H69-WT cells and the bottom one the mutant cell line H69-VP. In each case a single metaphase plate viewed along the axis of the spindle poles is simultaneously imaged for topoisomerase IIα (left), DNA (middle), and topoisomerase IIβ (right). For the parental H69-WT cells (top) the results are in agreement with our previous observations in A431 cells (6Meyer K.N. Kjeldsen E. Straub T. Knudsen B.K. Kikuchi A. Hickson I.D. Kreipe H. Boege F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and reports from other investigators (8Rattner J.B. Hendzel M.J. Furbee C.S. Muller M.T. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1097-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13Sumner A.T. Chromosome Res. 1996; 4: 4-15Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), probably reflecting the normal situation of the chromosomal organization of topoisomerase IIα and β. The chromosomes formed a ring with the putative centromeric regions oriented toward the center and the arms radiating into the periphery. Immunostaining of this structure was negative for topoisomerase IIβ (Fig. 3 b, right), because the enzyme was mainly localized in the cytosol at this stage of mitosis (compare with Fig. 2) and consequently washed away from the chromosomal spreads. Topoisomerase IIα (Fig. 3 b, left) was aligned in dots along the axes of the chromosome arms. Again, the bright spot in the center probably represents a cross-reaction of the topoisomerase IIα antibodies with centrosomes known from previous studies (6Meyer K.N. Kjeldsen E. Straub T. Knudsen B.K. Kikuchi A. Hickson I.D. Kreipe H. Boege F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Metaphases prepared from the mutant cell line H69-VP under normal growth conditions by demecolcine block (Fig. 3 b, bottom) appeared to be much less ordered. Immunostaining for topoisomerase IIβ (Fig.3 b, right) was negative in such type II metaphases like in the parental cells. Topoisomerase IIα (Fig. 3 b, left) appeared to be bound to the chromosomes of type II metaphases in a similar fashion as in the parental H69 cells, although the immunostaining was somewhat weaker and more accentuated at putative centromeric regions.In summary, the images in Figs. 2 and 3 suggest that topoisomerase IIβ did not (as initially assumed) substitute for the mutant α-isoenzyme lacking in the nuclei of H69-VP cells. On the contrary, mitosis appeared to be entirely sustained by cytosolic topoisomerase IIα, which in these cells probably entered the chromatin after breakdown of the nuclear envelope. Apparently under normal growth conditions in most cases (80%) chromatin condensation and disjunction were possible, because sufficient amounts of topoisomerase IIα gained access and bound to the DNA (Fig. 2 b, Meta Type II and Fig. 3 b, bottom). However, when topoisomerase IIα was not bound to the chromatin in detectable amounts, cells ended up with a DNA spheroid instead of chromosomes (Fig. 2 b, Meta Type I and Fig. 3 a). Time seemed to be a crucial factor for binding of cytosolic topoisomerase IIα to the mitotic chromatin, because formation of topoisomerase IIα-associated chromosomes (metaphase type II) was favored by normal growth conditions, whereas formation of DNA spheroids devoid of topoisomerase IIα (metaphase type I) was favored by accelerated cell growth.We have recently observed that a fraction of topoisomerase IIα binds to chromosomes with a higher affinity than to interphase chromatin. The increase in binding affinity is detectable by an increase in the salt concentration needed for extraction of the enzyme (6Meyer K.N. Kjeldsen E. Straub T. Knudsen B.K. Kikuchi A. Hickson I.D. Kreipe H. Boege F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To find out whether cytosolic topoisomerase IIα could also form such high affinity chromatin bonds in type II metaphases of H69-VP cells (compare with Fig. 3 b), we investigated the salt stability of the chromatin binding of topoisomerase IIα and -β in comparison to the parental cell line. We disrupted the cells by mechanical shearing (10 passages through a 29-gauge needle), sedimented and washed the nuclei, extracted chromatin-bound proteins serially with increasing salt concentrations, and analyzed topoisomerases IIα and -β in these fractions and in the salt-insoluble remnant by immunoblotting and densitometry (Fig. 4). In log cultures of parental H69-WT cells at normal growth conditions (WT, I) only a minor fraction of topoisomerase IIα (30%) was not bound to the chromatin (lanes 1 and 2). The majority of the α-isoenzyme (70%) was extractable by 400 mm KCl (lane 3), but only traces (<1%) resisted extraction by 400 mm KCl and were subsequently released from a tighter chromatin binding by 600 mm KCl or more (lanes 4and 5). When the parental cells were blocked with demecolcine in metaphase at normal growth conditions (WT, M), the bulk of topoisomerase IIα (about 85%) resisted salt extraction by KCl concentrations less than 600 mm(lanes 4 and 5), indicating recruitment of the enzyme to a high affinity chromatin-bound state (6Meyer K.N. Kjeldsen E. Straub T. Knudsen B.K. Kikuchi A. Hickson I.D. Kreipe H. Boege F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A markedly different pattern was observed in the mutant H69-VP cells. In log culture at normal growth conditions (VP, I) the majority of topoisomerase IIα appeared to be not bound to the chromatin (lanes 1 and 2), which confirms the data shown in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3. When the cells were blocked with demecolcine at normal growth conditions (VP, M) and consequently formed type II metaphases such as shown in Fig. 3 b (bottom), a small fraction of topoisomerase IIα (5%) was shifted to the 400 mm KCl extract (Fig. 4, lane 3), but the enzyme was neither detectable in fractions extracted subsequently with higher salt concentrations (lanes 4 and 5) nor in the salt-insoluble remnant (lane 6). These data indicate that in type II metaphases of H69-VP cells (compare Figs. 2 and 3 b), topoisomerase IIα did not undergo a high affinity chromatin bond in the same way as in metaphases of parental H69-WT (Fig. 4, WT, M) or A431 cells (6Meyer K.N. Kjeldsen E. Straub T. Knudsen B.K. Kikuchi A. Hickson I.D. Kreipe H. Boege F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), although a fraction (5%) of the enzyme was bound to the metaphase chromatin with low affinity. Unfortunately, a similar experiment could not be carried out with type I metaphases of H69-VP cells, because these cells were too fragile to endure sequential salt extractions. The four bottom panels of Fig. 4 show chromatin binding of topoisomerase IIβ in interphase (I) and release of the enzyme from the chromatin at mitosis (M). Similar such data were obtained in H69-WT and H69-VP cells, supporting the notion that topoisomerase IIβ does not get recruited to the mitotic chromatin instead of topoisomerase IIα, when the latter is lacking in the nucleus at the onset of mitosis.Figure 4Chromatin binding and affinity of topoisomerase IIα and -β in H69 cells. Parental H69-WT cells (WT) or the mutant subclone H69-VP (VP) were disrupted by mechanical shearing in 100 mm KCl. Nuclei were sedimented, washed with 200 mm KCl, and subsequently extracted with 400, 600, and 800 mm KCl. The supernatant of the cell lysate (lane 1), the isotonic nuclear wash fraction (lane 2), the serial salt extracts (lanes 3–5), and the insoluble chromatin remnants (lane 6) were subjected to Western blotting. Blots were probed for topoisomerase IIα (panels 1–4 from top) or -β (panels 5–8 from top). Each panel represents fractions sequentially obtained from 5 × 105 cells under normal growth conditions either in logarithmic growth (I) or blocked in metaphase by 0.26 μm demecolcine for 24 h (M, same conditions as Fig. 3 b).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We frequently observed that nuclei of H69-VP cells were disfigured and of much larger average size than those of parental H69 cells, suggesting a high frequency of non-disjunction in these cells. This notion was supported by comparative analysis of DNA mass distribution of the two cell lines under normal growth conditions by flow cytometry (Fig. 5). The parental cells (H69-WT) had a normal diploid genotype with a cell cycle distribution not unusual for a tumor cell line (G1 = 41 ± 4%, S = 46 ± 7%, and G2/M = 13 ± 2%). In contrast, H69-VP cells had a complex distribution of DNA mass with a greatly increased peak at the 2n position and an additional broad peak at a position of 4n or larger. Blockade in S- or G2/M-phase resolved this complex pattern into two peaks and revealed that more than 90% of the H69-VP cells were"

Taxol and docetaxel readily bind to and dissociate from microtubules, reaching 95% ligand exchange equilibrium in less than 3 min under our solution conditions (microtubules were previously assembled from GTP-tubulin, GTP-tubulin and microtubule-associated proteins, or GDP-tubulin and taxoid). Microtubules assembled from purified tubulin with Taxol are known to have typically one protofilament less than with the analogue docetaxel and control microtubules. Surprisingly, Taxol binding and exchange induce changes in the structure of preformed microtubules in a relatively short time scale. Cryoelectron microscopy shows changes toward the protofilament number distribution characteristic of Taxol or docetaxel, with a half-time of ∼0.5 min, employing GDP-tubulin-taxoid microtubules.

These results imply that microtubules can exchange protofilaments upon Taxol binding, due to internal dynamics along the microtubule wall. The simplest interpretation of the relatively fast taxoid exchange observed and labeling of cellular microtubules with fluorescent taxoids, is that the Taxol-binding site is at the outer microtubule surface. On the contrary, if Taxol binds at the microtubule lumen in agreement with the electron crystallographic structure of tubulin dimers, our results suggest that the inside of microtubules is easily accessible from the outer solution.

Microtubules are dynamic polar polymers of αβ-tubulin dimers. A Mg2+ ion coordinated with non-exchangeable GTP bound to the α-subunit near the α-β dimerization interface controls the stability of the heterodimer (1Menéndez M. Rivas G. Dı́az J.F. Andreu J.M. J.

GTP hydrolysis in the polymers and GDP/GTP exchange in dimers originate phases of microtubule growth and shrinkage from the ends (dynamic instability). Most microtubules are closed pseudohelical cylinders. There are seams in the microtubule lattices in which the lateral intersubunit contacts are different from the rest of the wall (reviewed in Ref. 3Downing K.H. Nogales E. Curr. Opin.

Biochemistry. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Taxol can drive otherwise inactive GDP-tubulin into microtubule assembly. Binding of exactly one taxoid molecule per tubulin dimer and microtubule elongation are thermodynamically linked processes (18Dı́az J.F. Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 19Dı́az J.F. Menendez M. Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10067-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). On the other hand, binding of Taxol to a few percent of the tubulin molecules in microtubules assembled from GTP-tubulin kinetically suppresses microtubule dynamic instability (20Caplow M. Shanks J. Ruhlen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23399-23402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Derry W.B. Wilson L. Jordan M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2203-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Microtubules are typically formed by 13 protofilaments (22Tilney L.G. Brian J. Bush D.J. Fujiwara K. Mooseker M.S. Murphy D.B. Snyder D.H. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 59: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, this is a relatively flexible property of tubulin assembly. Transitions in the number of protofilaments have been observed along individualin vitro assembled microtubules (23Chrétien D. Metoz F. Verde F. Karsenti E. Wade R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The number of protofilaments is fixed in vivo to 13 or other numbers by microtubule organizing centers and tubulin isoforms (24Lanzavecchia S. Bellon P.L. Dallai R. Afzelius B.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1994; 113: 225-237Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Hirose K. Lockhart A. Cross R.A. Amos L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1997; 275: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The majority of microtubules assembled from purified tubulin with Taxol have 12 protofilaments, that is, one protofilament less than control microtubules, as shown by x-ray solution scattering, thin sectioning, and cryoelectron microscopy (27Andreu J.M. Bordas J. Dı́az J.F. Garcı́a de Ancos J. Gil R. Medrano F.J. Nogales E. Pantos E. Towns-Andrews E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, microtubules induced by the side chain analogue docetaxel (Taxotere) have on average 13.4 protofilaments, similarly to control microtubules (28Andreu J.M. Dı́az J.F. Gil R. de Pereda J.M. Garcı́a de Lacoba M. Peyrot V. Briand C. Towns-Andrews E. Bordas J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31785-31792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, during Taxol- and docetaxel-induced microtubule assembly, bidimensional polymers consisting of open protofilament sheets, which later close into microtubules, have been detected with time-resolved x-ray solution scattering (29Dı́az J.F. Andreu J.M. Diakun G. Towns-Andrews E. Bordas J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2408-2420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The axial center to center spacing between tubulin monomers along one protofilament is typically 4.06 nm for the GDP-tubulin inside microtubules (30Beese L. Stubbs G. Cohen C. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, with the γ-phosphate of the slowly hydrolyzable GTP analogue GMP-PCP, this spacing is 4.20 nm (31Hyman A.A. Chretien D. Arnal I. Wade R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The spacing with GDP relates to the “curved” inactive conformation of GDP-tubulin at depolymerizing microtubule ends, which spontaneously self-associates forming double rings (made of curved protofilament segments), whereas the expanded conformation with GMP-PCP relates to the “straight” active conformation of GTP-tubulin which can assemble into microtubules (32Howard W.D.

Taxol also induces modifications in the rheologic properties of microtubules, consisting of changes in flexural rigidity (40Dye R.B. Fink S.P. Williams Jr., R.C. J. Biol.

Maggs A.C. Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13353-13360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Taxol makes microtubules less susceptible to orientation in high magnetic fields (46Bras W. Diakun G.P. Dı́az J.F. Maret G. Kramer H. Bordas J. Medrano F.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1509-1521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). One obvious question is what happens when taxoids bind to steady state assembled microtubules (47Parness J. Horwitz S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 48Evangelio J.A. Abal M. Barasoain I. Souto A.A. Lillo M.P. Acuña A.U. Amat-Guerri F. Andreu J.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 73-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Will the assembled structures remain with the same protofilaments until they disassemble and assemble again? Will the protofilament number and the axial spacing slowly relax to the Taxol values? Arnal and Wade (39Arnal I. Wade R.H. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 900-908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) have indicated that Taxol addition modifies only slightly the structure of assembled microtubules in comparison to assembly with Taxol, however, they did not report quantification of the Taxol binding in their study. On the other hand, during our studies of taxoid-induced assembly (27Andreu J.M. Bordas J. Dı́az J.F. Garcı́a de Ancos J. Gil R. Medrano F.J. Nogales E. Pantos E. Towns-Andrews E. J. Mol.

J. 1996; 70: 2408-2420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) we acquired preliminary synchrotron x-ray solution scattering data indicating that Taxol addition to preassembled microtubules decreases their diameter. We reasoned that Taxol binding to microtubules should ultimately lead to the same final equilibrium state as direct assembly with Taxol, the only problem being the kinetics of the process. That is, depending on the solution conditions, the polymers might in practice remain locked in the non-Taxol state for a longer time than the experimental observation (or than the average lifetime of microtubules), or their structures will relax toward the Taxol state. Here we report measurements of taxoid binding to assembled microtubules, Taxol and docetaxel ligand exchange in the polymer-binding site, and measurements of microtubule structural changes with cryoelectron microscopy and x-ray scattering. The results show that taxoids readily bind to and dissociate from microtubules, and give compelling evidence that Taxol changes the protofilament number of microtubules made of purified tubulin in a subminute time scale. These novel results and the location of Taxol in the electron crystallography model structure of tubulin (49Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar) indicate previously unexpected features of microtubule structure and function. Purified calf brain tubulin, GDP-tubulin preparation, and chemicals were as described (18Dı́az J.F. Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). GDP-tubulin was equilibrated in PEDTA buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm GDP) to which 7 or 8 mm MgCl2 was added, final pH 6.7. For comparative purposes, GTP-tubulin was obtained by addition of 1 mm GTP to GDP-tubulin aliquots with MgCl2. For glycerol-induced assembly, tubulin was directly equilibrated in glycerol assembly buffer, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 3.4m glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm GTP, to which 6 mm MgCl2 was added, final pH 6.7. All tubulin samples were clarified by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm, 4 °C, during 10 min in TL100.2 and TL100.3 rotors in Beckman TL100 centrifuges before MgCl2 addition. Microtubule protein, containing tubulin and MAPs, was prepared as described (50De Pereda J.M. Wallin M. Billger M. Andreu J.M. Cell Motil. Cytosketon. 1995; 30: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) in 100 mm Mes, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgSO4, 1 mm GTP, pH 6.7. Taxol was kindly provided by the late Dr. M. Suffness, National Cancer Institute, NIH (Bethesda, MD). [3H]Taxol was a gift from Drs. I. Ringel, The Hebrew University (Jerusalem) and S. B. Horwitz, Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Bronx, NY). Docetaxel (Taxotere) and [14C]docetaxel were kindly provided by Rhône-Poulenc Rorer (92165 Antony, France). Microtubules were assembled for 1 h at 37 °C in glycerol assembly buffer, then different amounts of taxoid or the corresponding volume of Me2SO (typically <1%, v/v) were added, and the samples incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The amounts of bound and free taxoid were measured using a radioactive method as described (18Dı́az J.F. Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). To measure equilibrium competition between taxoids for binding to microtubules, GDP-tubulin was assembled at 37 °C in PEDTA buffer containing 1 mm GDP and 8 mm MgCl2, by the addition of Taxol or docetaxel. One hour after the competitor ligand was added and the bound and free taxoids were quantified after an additional 1 h. In control measurements microtubules were directly assembled with the mixture of both Taxol and docetaxel. The time course of the displacement of taxoids was measured as follows. GDP-tubulin was assembled with taxoid as above and diluted to a concentration at which the displacement could be effectively measured,i.e. 5 μm for Taxol assembled samples, and 3 μm for the docetaxel assembled samples, a 6-fold excess of the displacing ligand was added and samples were taken at different times of reaction, and bound Taxol and docetaxel were quantified as above. The time course of the change of the number of protofilaments with taxoids was examined as follows. GDP-tubulin (10 μm) in PEDTA buffer containing 1 mm GDP and 8 mm MgCl2 was assembled by adding an equimolecular concentration of taxoid, the sample was left to assemble for 1 h and then diluted and excess competitor taxoid added exactly as in the taxoid displacement experiments above. Samples were taken at different times of reaction and were processed for electron microscopy. Alternatively, GTP-tubulin (>50 μm) was assembled in glycerol assembly buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. Taxol, docetaxel, at an equimolecular concentration with tubulin, or Me2SO were added samples were taken at different times of reaction and were processed by electron microscopy. Electron micrographs of negatively stained samples were recorded as described (28Andreu J.M. Dı́az J.F. Gil R. de Pereda J.M. Garcı́a de Lacoba M. Peyrot V. Briand C. Towns-Andrews E. Bordas J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31785-31792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples for cryoelectron microscopy were incubated at 37 °C at various times of taxoid exchange and aliquots were transferred to holey grids that had been previously glow discharged. The grids were blotted and plunged into liquid ethane. Electron micrographs were obtained using a JEOL JEM 1200EX II operated at 120 kV and recorded on Kodak SO-163 film. Images were taken at a magnification of ×30,000 with a 20–25 μm underfocus. A GATAN-626 cold stage was used in the recording of the micrographs from the specimens. Lateral views of microtubules contain characteristic longitudinal fringe patterns which are generated by the projection of the protofilaments in the front and back of the microtubule wall. This is due to tilting of the microtubule lattice with respect to the microtubule axis, resulting in a protofilament twist, in order to accommodate more or less than the characteristic 13 protofilaments of a nearly paraxial lattice. Lattice tilting is required to achieve correct cylindrical closure of the tubulin monomers within the lattice, as exemplified with microtubule models and geometrical calculations (27Andreu J.M. Bordas J. Dı́az J.F. Garcı́a de Ancos J. Gil R. Medrano F.J. Nogales E. Pantos E. Towns-Andrews E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 51Chrétien D. Wade R.H. Biol. Cell. 1991; 71: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The number of protofilaments corresponding to each image in this work were classified from the type of fringe pattern (27Andreu J.M. Bordas J. Dı́az J.F. Garcı́a de Ancos J. Gil R. Medrano F.J.

In addition, the orientation of the moiré fringe patterns in cryoelectron micrographs allows determination of microtubule polarity (54Chrétien D. Kenney J.M. Fuller S.D. Wade R.H. Structure. 1996; 4: 1031-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Measurements were made at station 2.1 of the Daresbury Laboratory Synchrotron Radiation Source, UK. Data acquisition and processing, interpretation of the microtubule x-ray scattering, and computer modeling were as described previously (27Andreu J.M. Bordas J. Dı́az J.F. Garcı́a de Ancos J. Gil R.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4036-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A scanning temperature-controlled cell was employed throughout the measurements, which made radiation damage negligible. Cameras (2 and 3 m) and a 512-channel quadrant ionization detector were employed, effectively covering a S range from 0.02 to 0.35 nm−1. S is the absolute value of the scattering vector, defined as S = 2(sinθ)/λ, where 2θ is the angle of the scattered to incident radiation and λ the x-ray wavelength. To monitor the time course of the J 01 andJ 02 scattering maxima, the scattering profiles were acquired in 1-s time frames after isothermal mixing, employing a fast mixing device with a 0.1-s dead time (56Dı́az J.F. Strobbe R. Engelborghs Y. Chacón P. Andreu J.M. Diakun G. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1998; 69: 286-289Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The scattering intensity was corrected for radial dilution multiplying by the scattering vector. To reduce noise to an acceptable level the scattering profiles were averaged in 10-s intervals. TheJ 01 and J 02 peaks were fitted by third order polynomials, and the discrete S value (channel) closest to the maximum taken as the position of theJ 0 peak. The changes in position of the scattering maxima with time were fitted with the pertinent functions employing a least squares Marquardt algorithm (Sigmaplot, Jandel Scientific). Microtubules were first assembled to steady state from purified GTP-tubulin in glycerol-containing buffer, and excess Taxol or docetaxel were added to them. Since taxoid binding and assembly are coupled, an additional fraction of tubulin will assemble. However, choosing an initial concentration of tubulin 10–25-fold larger than the critical concentration for assembly reduces the newly assembled protein to a few percent of total, giving an acceptably small perturbation of the system (Fig. 1). Under these conditions, the binding of radioactively labeled taxoids to microtubules, measured 30 min after Taxol or docetaxel addition by sedimentation in a table top ultracentrifuge, was 0.98 ± 0.06 molecules of taxoid per tubulin heterodimer. An alternative interpretation would be that taxoids were not binding to preassembled microtubules, but that due to dynamic instability, most microtubules fully depolymerized and reassembled with bound taxoid during the experiment. However, since Taxol is known to suppress microtubule dynamics (21Derry W.B. Wilson L. Jordan M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2203-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), we concluded that in these experiments taxoids were most probably directly binding to the assembled microtubules. Next we turned to measuring taxoid exchange in microtubules assembled from GDP-tubulin, which are necessarily devoid of dynamic instability (since there is no GTP to be hydrolyzed). Microtubules were previously assembled with Taxol in equimolecular or larger ratios with tubulin, docetaxel was added to them keeping the total concentration of taxoids constant, and the binding of each taxoid was measured. The results (Fig. 2, solid symbols) showed that at binding equilibrium Taxol had dissociated and docetaxel had bound to microtubules, competing for binding to one site per assembled tubulin dimer (docetaxel has a relative apparent affinity 1.8 times larger than that of Taxol, indicated by the model binding competition shown by the solid lines in Fig. 2). In control measurements both ligands were added before assembly (18Dı́az J.F. Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), giving an equilibrium mixture of Taxol and docetaxel-liganded sites which was practically coincident with the experiment (Fig. 2, empty symbols; see Fig. 7 and equations for ligand competition in Ref. 18Dı́az J.F. Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The same results were obtained with GTP-tubulin (not shown).Figure 7Schematic representation of different hypotheses on how Taxol may reach its binding site at the outer (A) or the inner (B–D) microtubule surface (see “Discussion”). A, Taxol binds at the outer microtubule surface. B, Taxol binds at the inner microtubule surface and its access from the solution into the lumen is facilitated by microtubule dynamic instability. Closed and open circles represent Taxol molecules in the front and back of the lumen, respectively. C, Taxol diffuses from the bulk solution through the microtubule ends and binds into the microtubule lumen. D, entry of Taxol into the microtubule lumen through openings between protofilaments in the microtubule wall. This might be envisaged as relatively large pores, or as dynamic lattice microdefects (the size is exaggerated in the scheme) or as opening and closing of seams between protofilaments from the microtubule ends.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The kinetics of taxoid exchange were examined by diluting microtubules assembled with Taxol into a 6-fold excess of docetaxel and vice versa.

https://openalex.org/W2078613588,"Mammalian phospholipase D (PLD) activity becomes up-regulated when cells are stimulated by a variety of hormones, growth factors, and other extracellular signals. Two distinct PLDs, PLD1 and PLD2, have been identified. The mechanism through which each PLD is activated, however, is poorly understood. Using transiently transfected human embryonic kidney fibroblasts (HEK293), we demonstrate here that PLD1 activity, and to a lesser extent PLD2 activity, is stimulated in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF). PLD2, but not PLD1, associates with the EGF receptor in a ligand-independent manner and becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon EGF receptor activation. Tyrosine 11 (Tyr-11) of PLD2 was identified as the specific phosphorylation site. Mutation of this residue to phenylalanine enhanced basal activity almost 2-fold, but did not alter the magnitude of the EGF-mediated increase in PLD2 activity. In conclusion, we show here for the first time agonist-stimulated activation of both PLD1 and PLD2 in vivo and provide evidence of a distinct type of interaction for each isoform with the EGF receptor. Moreover, our results suggest that agonist-induced tyrosine phosphorylation plays a role in PLD2 regulation. Mammalian phospholipase D (PLD) activity becomes up-regulated when cells are stimulated by a variety of hormones, growth factors, and other extracellular signals. Two distinct PLDs, PLD1 and PLD2, have been identified. The mechanism through which each PLD is activated, however, is poorly understood.

DAG is a well characterized activator of conventional and novel protein kinase C (PKC) isoenzymes, and it has been suggested that the DAG formed through PLD activation contributes to the more pronounced second phase of DAG production in response to growth factors (reviewed in Refs. 2Exton J.H.

Recent investigations, however, have shown that different partially purified PLD activities require distinct cofactors for activation, suggesting the existence of multiple PLD isoforms that are differently regulated. Cofactors that regulate PLD activity include ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), Rho, PKC, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and oleate (reviewed in Refs. 1Cockroft S. Chem.Phys.

Furthermore, tyrosine kinase-mediated PLD activation has been observed in several cell systems (reviewed in Ref. 17Natarajan V. Scribner W.M. Vepa S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The activation of PLD by EGF in pancreatic acinar cells can be inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of unknown proteins is an essential feature for the stimulation of at least some PLD activities (18Rydzewska G. Morisset J. Pancreas. 1995; 10: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Similarly, 4-hydroxynonenal-induced PLD activation in vascular endothelial cells is inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors and enhanced by protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors (19Natarajan V.

PLD1 is located primarily in perinuclear regions in rat embryo fibroblasts (21Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris J. Frohman M.A. Curr.

Two splice variants of PLD1 have been identified, though no differences either in regulation or activity have been observed thus far (24Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu Q.

The PLD1 and PLD2 amino acid sequences share ∼52% identity. PLD2 is associated with the plasma membrane and has, in contrast to PLD1, high basal activity which is not further activated by PKCα, ARF, or Rhoin vitro (21Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J.

Its mode of regulation in vivo at normal levels of expression is not known, although it is probably held quiescent unless stimulated. Upon serum stimulation, PLD2 undergoes redistribution and a role in cytoskeletal reorganization has been suggested (21Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D.

Whether this is mediated by PLD1 or/and PLD2, or yet unidentified PLD isoforms has not been determined. In this paper, we provide evidence that EGF treatment stimulates PLD1 and PLD2 activity in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. PLD2, but not PLD1, forms a physiological complex with the EGF receptor and is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon receptor activation. Whereas EGF receptor kinase activity is essential for the stimulation of PLD2 activity, tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD2 is not. pCGN expression vectors containing the cDNAs of human PLD1 (hPLD1) and mouse PLD2 (mPLD2) have been described previously (20Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29640-29643Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 21Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R.

The cDNAs for the EGFR and mPLD2 (without an HA-tag) were also cloned into a cytomegalovirus promotor-enhancer-driven expression vector. Mutations were generated using the Muta-Gene M13 in vitromutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad) and the following mutagenesis primers: PLD2 Y11F, 5′-CAGATAGTCCCCAAAGGGAAAGAGG; PLD2 Y14F, 5′-GGAGTTCAGAAAGTCCCCATAGGG; PLD1 Y165F, 5′-GGTAATTTTCCAGGAATTTCTGTTTGCTGG; PLD2 Y470F, 5′-CAGTCAGTCGGAATTGCACGTCATC; and EGFR K721A, 5′-CTCTTAATTCCGCGATAGCGACGGG. The PLD2 Y11F mutant was then subcloned back into the HA-tag expression vector. Deletion of the cytosolic domain of EGFR (ΔEGFR) was generated through exonuclease Bal31 digestion of full-length EGFR cDNA and subsequent introduction of a stop codon at amino acid 655. HEK293 cells, which express undetectable endogenous EGFR levels, were obtained from A. Ullrich, Martinsried. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose, 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine, 10 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 enriched, humidified atmosphere. The cells were starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose, 0.5% fetal calf serum, and 2 mml-glutamine, 10 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc) overnight prior to initiating the 30-min EGF (50 nm) stimulation. Transient transfection of HEK293 cells was performed essentially as described by Chen and Okayama (33Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) and Gorman et al. (34Gorman C.M. Gies D. McCray G. Huang M. Virology. 1989; 171: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Prior to lysis, the cells were treated with EGF (50 ng/ml) for 30 min and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in 0.4 ml per 3-cm dish with ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 20 mm NaF, 200 μmNa3VO4, 1 mm AEBSF (Calbiochem), 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma)) and precleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed by addition of 30 μl of Protein G-Agarose (Boehringer-Mannheim) and the appropriate antibody for 3 h, followed by brief centrifugation. The precipitates were washed three times in washing-buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 20 mm NaF, 200 μmNa3VO4, 1 mm AEBSF, 1 mg/mlp-nitrophenyl phosphate). For gel electrophoresis, the immunoprecipitates were dissolved in 2× Laemmli buffer (35van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell, BA85). The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using horseradish-peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents according to the manufacturer instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Polyclonal rabbit antisera against PLD was produced by immunization with a synthetic peptide encoding the 15 C-terminal amino acids of mPLD2 (CPLGSKEGMIPLEVWT). The antiserum recognizes both hPLD1 and mPLD2. Anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories, and anti-EGFR antibody for immunoprecipitation was from Merck, Darmstadt. For detection of the EGFR by Western blot analysis, polyclonal rabbit antiserum produced by immunization with a synthetic peptide encoding amino acids 357–365 of the EGFR was used. Anti-influenza (HA)-tag monoclonal antibody was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. In vivo measurements of PLD activity were performed according to Wakelam, M. J. O. et al. (36Wakelam M.J.O. Hodgin M. Martin A. Kendall D.A. Hills S.J. Signal Transduction Protocols. Human Press Inc., Totowa, New Jersey1995: 271-278Google Scholar), with the following modifications. PLD activity was assayed by measuring the accumulation of 14C-labeled phosphatidylbutanol (PtdBut). The cells were labeled with 4 μCi14C-palmitic acid per 2-cm dish added to the starvation medium and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO2enriched, humidified atmosphere. The cells were washed twice in HHBG buffer (1.26 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 5.37 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, 4.2 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 10 mm glucose) and incubated in 0.3% butan-1-ol in HHBG buffer for 20 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the cells were treated with or without 50 ng/ml EGF in HHBG containing 0.3% butan-1-ol for an additional 30 min. After the incubation, the buffer was aspirated and 0.5 ml of ice-cold methanol was added to each well. The cell debris was scraped into a glass vial and kept on ice. Chloroform and H2O were added to give a final CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O ratio of 1:1:0.8 (v/v). After vortexing, the vials were centrifuged at 1200 ×g for 5 min, and the organic phase was spotted on Whatman LK5DF thin-layer chromatography plates. The labeled products were separated by thin-layer chromatography using the upper phase of a mixture of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane:ethyl acetate:acetic acid:water ratio of 50:110:20:100 (v/v). PhosphorImager technology (Molecular Dynamics) was used to determine the amount of labeled PtdBut and total lipids.In vitro PLD activity was determined by measuring the release of 3H-choline from didecanoyl phosphatidyl [3H]choline (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to Vinggaard et al.

To investigate whether the recently cloned isoforms PLD1 and PLD2 are targeted by the EGFR, we transiently overexpressed either Flu epitope-tagged PLD1 (HA-PLD1) or Flu epitope-tagged PLD2 (HA-PLD2) in combination with the EGFR into HEK293 cells. Activation of PLD was determined by the unique ability of PLD to produce, in the presence of butanol, phosphatidylbutanol (PtdBut), which is not further metabolized. The stimulation of cells with EGF was carried out for 30 min because time course experiments in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with HA-PLD2, and the EGFR revealed maximal PLD2 activation after 30 min of EGF stimulation (data not shown). Similar to native HEK293 cells, overexpression of the EGFR did not result in elevated PLD activity in cells that were treated with EGF for 30 min (Fig. 1), demonstrating that endogenous levels of PLD are either relatively low or unresponsive to EGF treatment. Overexpression of PLD2 resulted in very high basal activity (up to 10-fold higher than in untransfected HEK293 cells), which was further stimulated (1.3-fold) by EGF treatment. Overexpression of PLD2 and the EGFR led to a further increase in EGF-induced PLD2 activity (1.7–2.1-fold in individual experiments), whereas the high basal activity was unaffected. The increase in PLD2 activity did not result from the presence of the HA-tag since a similar increase was observed for PLD2 lacking the HA-tag (see Fig. 6).Figure 6EGF-induced activation of PLD2 Y11F.HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with EGFR, EGFR and PLD2, or EGFR and PLD2 Y11F expression plasmids. The in vivo PLD activity was determined in unstimulated (−) and EGF treated cells (+) after 30 min by measuring the accumulation of PtdBut relative to total lipids. The fold increase of PtdBut formation in response to EGF over basal is given for each set of the transfections. Data are means ± S.E. of one experiment performed in triplicate. The result shown is representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Tyrosine kinase activity has been shown to be essential for EGF-induced PLD activation in pancreatic acinar cells (18Rydzewska G. Morisset J. Pancreas. 1995; 10: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To investigate the importance of the EGFR tyrosine kinase activity for PLD2 activation, we overexpressed HA-PLD2 together with a kinase-inactive EGFR mutant (EGFR K721A). EGF treatment of cells expressing EGFR K721A and PLD2 did not result in activation of PLD2, clearly showing that tyrosine kinase activity is an essential feature for the activation of PLD2 (Fig.1). Overexpression of HA-PLD1 and the EGFR revealed that PLD1, in contrast to PLD2, has low basal activity, although the expression levels of PLD1 and PLD2 are, upon transient transfection into HEK293 cells, comparable (see Fig. 2). Similar to PLD2, EGF treatment enhanced PLD1 activity significantly (2.8-fold), demonstrating that both PLD1 and PLD2 are activated by the EGFR (Fig.1). The experiment in Fig. 1 showed that both PLD1 and PLD2 become activated upon EGF-induced activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the EGFR. To investigate whether PLD1 or/and PLD2 served as a substrate for the EGFR, HA-PLD1 and HA-PLD2 were co-expressed with the EGFR, following which the cells were either left untreated or were treated with EGF for 30 min. Immunoprecipitation of PLD1 and PLD2 with HA-tag-specific antibodies and subsequent Western blot analysis with phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies revealed EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD2, but no tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD1 (Fig. 2). These data show that PLD2 is a substrate for a tyrosine kinase activated by EGF stimulation, which could be the EGFR itself or a different kinase. Confirmation that the PLD2 tyrosine phosphorylation requires activation of the EGFR pathway was demonstrated using the kinase-inactive EGFR (EGFR K721A) under the same conditions, which did not lead to detectable PLD2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3, lanes 9 and10). Because PLD2 is tyrosine phosphorylated in an EGFR-dependent manner and has been shown to be localized to the plasma membrane, we investigated whether PLD2 and the EGFR interact. Complex formation was analyzed by Western blot analysis after immunoprecipitation of the EGFR (using a monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody which recognizes the extracellular domain of the receptor) from HA-PLD2 and EGFR co-expressing HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, immunoprecipitation of the wild-type EGFR resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of PLD2 (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and8, upper panel). The amount of PLD2 that was co-immunoprecipitated with the receptor was similar in untreated and EGF-treated cells, indicating that the interaction does not require receptor activation. This is supported by the finding that PLD2 also interacts with the kinase-inactive EGFR (EGFR K721A) (Fig. 3,lanes 9 and 10). The complex formation between PLD2 and EGFR was eliminated when the cytosolic part of the receptor was almost completely deleted (ΔEGFR, which encodes amino acids 1–655) (Fig. 3, lanes 11 and 12), suggesting not unexpectedly that the interaction is mediated by the cytosolic part of the EGFR. In contrast to PLD2, PLD1 did not co-immunoprecipitate with the EGFR either in EGF-treated or in unstimulated cells (Fig. 3,lanes 5 and 6). EGF-induced activation of the EGFR as well as EGFR-specific tyrosine phosphorylation was confirmed by Western blot analysis using the phosphotyrosine-specific antibody PY20 (Fig. 3, lower panel). We conclude from these data that PLD2, but not PLD1, forms a physical complex with the EGFR that is independent of receptor activation. The interaction of PLD2 with the EGFR was confirmed through determination of EGFR-bound PLD activity in vitro. As shown in Fig. 4, PLD activity co-immunoprecipitated with the EGFR from cells that were co-transfected with HA-PLD2 and EGFR expression plasmids, whereas immunoprecipitation of the EGFR from cells transfected only with HA-PLD2 resulted in recovery of very little PLD activity (Fig. 4, left panel). The PLD2 activity in the EGFR complex did not increase upon EGF stimulation, whereas total PLD activity immunoprecipitated with HA-tag antibodies increased about 1.7-fold upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 4,right panel). Whether this is because of ligand-induced receptor internalization and degradation, partial release of PLD2 from the complex upon EGF stimulation, or changes in PLD2 activity is currently not known, although the first possibility appears most likely because total PLD2 activity increases and similar results are seen in Fig. 1. Even though we do not know the molar ratios of the EGFR and PLD2 upon overexpression in HEK293 cells, the activity data suggest that only a minor fraction of PLD2 (about 10%) is complexed with the EGFR in this setting. Because co-factors which activate PLD2 under in vitroconditions have not been identified yet, tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD2 may have an important regulatory function. To investigate whether tyrosine phosphorylation is required for activation of PLD2, we attempted to identify the specific tyrosine residue(s) in PLD2 which is(are) phosphorylated through the action of the activated EGFR. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of human PLD1 and mouse PLD2 showed that four tyrosine residues in PLD2 (Tyr-11, Tyr-14, Tyr-165, and Tyr-470) are not conserved in PLD1. These tyrosine residues were mutated to phenylalanine, and the ability of the EGFR to phosphorylate these mutants on tyrosine was investigated upon co-overexpression in HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig.5 A, mutation of tyrosine 11 to phenylalanine (Y11F) completely abolished EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD2. None of the other mutations impaired EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD2, showing that tyrosine 11 is the only tyrosine phosphorylation site. It should be noted that none of the mutations had any effect on the protein stability as shown in Fig. 5 A, lower panel. We then sought to determine whether the Y11F mutation interferes with the ability of PLD2 to associate with the EGFR, which might be essential for EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD2. HA-PLD2 and PLD2 Y11F were co-expressed with the EGFR in HEK293 cells, and the amount of PLD2 and PLD2 Y11F that co-immunoprecipitated with the EGFR was determined by Western blot analysis using antiserum directed against the C-terminal 15 amino acids of PLD2. As shown in Fig. 5 B, similar amounts of both wild-type PLD2 and PLD2 Y11F co-immunoprecipitated with the EGFR, revealing that differences in the affinity for the EGFR do not account for the inability of the EGFR to phosphorylate PLD2 Y11F. The effect of the Y11F mutation on EGF-induced PLD2 activation was subsequently studied in HEK293 cells after overexpression of wild-type and PLD2 Y11F. As shown in Fig. 6, both wild-type and PLD2 Y11F activity were stimulated upon EGF treatment to the same extent (1.7- and 1.8-fold, respectively), although the basal and stimulated activities of PLD2 were both elevated as a consequence of the Y11F mutation. These data indicate that the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD2 is neither essential for activation of the enzyme nor for the association with the EGFR and suggests that it may have an important role in yet unidentified functions. The stimulation of PLD activity has been observed in various cell types in response to a large number of agonists including growth factors. EGF treatment stimulates PLD activity in Swiss 3T3 (26Cook S.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem J. 1992; 285: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 29Pettitt T.R. Zaqqa M. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1615-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); however, neither the mechanism of activation nor which of the PLD isoforms are activated has been determined. Our investigations show that both human PLD1 and mouse PLD2 are activated upon EGF stimulation in HEK293 fibroblasts. The fold induction of PLD1 and PLD2 activity corresponds well to the increase of endogenous PLD activity found in response to EGF in other cell systems (26Cook S.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem J. 1992; 285: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 28Kaszkin M. Seidler L. Kast R. Kinzel V. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30Song J. Jiang Y-W. Foster D.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 79-85PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the in vivo activity in COS-7 cells (21Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), PLD1 has low and PLD2 high basal activity in HEK293 cells. Because PLD2 has high basal activity in vitro, it has been suggested that in vivo it is normally inhibited through one or more mechanisms (38Jenco J. Rawligson A. Daniels B. Morris A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4901-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and that it is de-repressed when receptors undergo stimulation (21Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Although our data do not discriminate between this hypothesis and simple activation, the 2-fold induction of PLD2 activity that we observed upon EGF treatment does demonstrate that PLD2 activity is regulated in vivo and that it increases as a result of receptor stimulation. Because overexpressed PLD2 may overwhelm normal regulatory mechanisms (21Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), the degree of EGF-mediated activation of PLD2 may be much more dramatic for endogenous PLD2. The activation of PLD by EGF in pancreatic acinar cells has been shown to be sensitive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, indicating that the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor is an essential feature for activation of at least some PLD activities (18Rydzewska G. Morisset J. Pancreas. 1995; 10: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We show here, that indeed the activation of PLD2 requires EGFR tyrosine kinase activity (Fig. 1). Whether this also applies to PLD1 remains to be investigated. PLD2, but not PLD1, forms a physical complex with the EGFR and is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to receptor activation. The interaction between the EGFR and PLD2 is mediated by the intracellular part of the receptor (Fig. 3). Further mapping of the interaction site using various EGFR deletion mutants suggests that several subdomains of the cytosolic part mediate the interaction with PLD2. 2R. Slaaby and K. Seedorf, unpublished observation. Taken together, the findings that PLD2 complexes with the EGFR and that it becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in an EGF and EGFR-dependent manner suggests as the most likely possibility that PLD2 is a direct substrate for the EGFR. Nonetheless, attempts to show interaction between the EGFR and PLD2 under in vitro conditions failed.2Whether this is because of a certain receptor confirmation which is stabilized by the plasma membrane in vivo, or to formation of a multi-protein complex which is not properly formed under in vitro conditions, is not clear at present. It is, however, interesting to note that the interaction between the EGFR and PKCα (39Seedorf K. Shearman M. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18953-18960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) has very similar properties.2 The identification of tyrosine 11 as the specific phosphorylation site in PLD2 and its subsequent mutation to phenylalanine clearly showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD2 is not required for its basal activity or for agonist-dependent stimulation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD1 has been shown recently in human granulocytes in response to the protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate (25Marcil J. Harbour D. Naccache P.H. Bourgoin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20660-20664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Whether this affects PLD1 activity has not been determined. We have not been able to detect any tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD1 in response to EGF treatment suggesting the involvement of other tyrosine kinases in PLD1 phosphorylation in the presence of protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. Furthermore, because tyrosine 11 is not conserved in the amino acid sequence of PLD1, it must be phosphorylated at a distinct site. The total PLD2 activity increased by approximately 2-fold in response to EGF, whereas the receptor-associated activity did not increase. These data may indicate that PLD2 is released from the receptor upon stimulation and translocates to another location. Several different mechanisms might underlie the PLD2 stimulation, such as increase in PIP2, either locally or as a result of translocation. In this context, the increased basal and stimulated activity of PLD2 Y11F suggests that the mutant enzyme is in a more favorable local environment and/or is more active than the majority of the wild-type PLD2, which presumably is not phosphorylated at Tyr-11. In this context it is interesting to note that PA phosphohydrolase (PAP), which converts PLD-generated PA to DAG, also has been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with the EGFR. Following EGFR activation, PAP was released from the receptor complex and associated with PKCε (40Jiang Y.J. Lu Z. Zang Q. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29529-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Whether PLD2 translocates in a similar way remains to be investigated. The in vitro characterization of PLD1 and PLD2 has revealed that PLD1 is activated by ARF, PKCα, and Rho in a synergistic manner, whereas PLD2 activity remains unaffected by these co-factors (21Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). How the EGFR mediates the activation of either PLD1 or PLD2 in vivo has not been determined yet. The specific interaction with, and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD2 by the EGFR, as well as the specific subcellular localization of PLD1 and PLD2 (21Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) suggests distinct mechanisms of activation. The EGF receptor is just one of many tyrosine kinase receptors found in cells. Our findings raise the possibility that PLD2 expressed at endogenous levels may largely or entirely be complexed with the plasma membrane localized receptors. In the unstimulated levels, such receptors tend to be sequestered into relatively quiescent regions of the membrane that are deficient in PIP2. Because PIP2 is a required co-factor for PLD2, this might provide a potential mechanism through which cells could keep PLD2 inactive in the absence of agonist stimulation. Alternatively, other components of the complex might contribute to the PLD2 inhibition. Subsequent receptor stimulation would lead to local generation of PIP2 through PLC activation, and potentially to PLD2 translocation to more active membrane sites (either plasma membrane or vesicles). We thank A. Ullrich for providing the EGF receptor expression plasmid."

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a precursor 35 S rRNA is transcribed and then processed into the mature 18 S, 5.8 S, and 25 S rRNAs found in ribosomes. These rRNAs are encoded by 100–200 direct rDNA repeats on chromosome XII. Each spacer region between the pol I-driven 35 S transcription units contains a gene encoding the remaining rRNA, 5 S rRNA, transcribed by pol III.The only essential function of pol I in yeast is synthesis of the 35 S rRNA transcript, since the lethal phenotype of a deletion in the second largest subunit of pol I can be rescued by synthesis of the 35 S rRNA transcript by pol II from a GAL promoter placed correctly upstream of the 35 S transcription unit on a high copy plasmid (1Nogi Y. Yano R. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3962-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This provided a screen for mutants dependent on pol II-driven synthesis of rRNA from the GAL promoter (2Nogi Y. Vu L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7025-7030Google Scholar). Such rrn mutants were expected to be defective in pol I activity in vivo, and confirming this, mutations in genes encoding subunits of pol I (those not shared with either pol II or pol III) were isolated (2Nogi Y. Vu L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7025-7030Google Scholar). Other mutations that also caused defects in rRNA synthesis (as assessed by pulse labelingin vivo) eventually proved to lie in genes encoding (subunits of) pol I transcription factors.An important advance in the study of yeast pol I was the development of an in vitro transcription system using a crude extract (3Riggs D.L.

Extracts fromrrn mutant strains were not active, and their activity could be restored by addition of fractions from a wild-type extract. This was used as an assay for the purification of pol I transcription factors (6Keys D.A. Vu L. Steffan J.S. Dodd J.A. Yamamoto R.T. Nogi Y. Nomura M.

The availability of cloned RRN genes, which could be tagged with the hemagglutinin antigen (HA) or hexahistidine, greatly facilitated purification. In this way, the multi-subunit factors, core factor (CF), and upstream activation factor (UAF), and the single subunit factor Rrn3p were identified and shown to be necessary for activity in the crude in vitro system as well as in vivo (6Keys D.A.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3964-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Like higher eukaryotes, the yeast pol I promoter is composed of a core element that is essential for transcription, located roughly between +5 and −40 relative to the start site of transcription, and an upstream element from roughly −60 to −155 which is necessary for high level transcription (13Musters W. Knol J. Dekker A.F. van Heerikhuizen H. Planta R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9661-9678Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Kulkens T. Riggs D.L. Heck J.D. Planta R.J. Nomura M.

In yeast, the upstream element is required for formation of a stable pre-initiation complex (9Keys D.A. Lee B.-S. Dodd J.A. Nguyen T.T. Vu L. Fantino E. Burson L.M. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). UAF initiates stable complex formation and appears to bind the upstream element tightly, because once bound, it is not readily transferred to a competing template (9Keys D.A. Lee B.-S. Dodd J.A. Nguyen T.T. Vu L. Fantino E. Burson L.M. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It seems likely that the core histones H3 and H4 present in UAF are important for the stability of UAF binding to the upstream element (16Keener J. Dodd J.A. Lalo D. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13458-13463Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Also, TATA-binding protein (TBP), which is required for pol I transcription as for pol II and pol III (17Comai L. Tanese N.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2551-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Here we report reconstitution of yeast pol I transcription in vitrofrom highly purified components and, hence, definition of which components are necessary and sufficient for basal transcription and for high level activated transcription. Specifically, we demonstrate rigorously that although TBP is required for high level activated transcription, it is not required for basal transcription.DISCUSSIONFive purified components, pol I, Rrn3p, CF, TBP, and UAF, are sufficient for high level transcription from the yeast rDNA promoterin vitro. Several lines of evidence indicate that thein vitro system faithfully replicates the in vivomechanism. Omission of each component individually showed that each is necessary for high level activity in this purified transcription system, as shown previously for crude systems (5Schultz M.C. Choe S.Y. Reeder R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6Keys D.A. Vu L. Steffan J.S. Dodd J.A. Yamamoto R.T. Nogi Y. Nomura M.

This single-component omission experiment has essentially been replicatedin vivo by using yeast strains with null mutations in genes encoding (subunits of) four of these components: pol I, Rrn3p, CF, and UAF. Such mutations have a lethal or nearly lethal phenotype, but the phenotype can be rescued by transcription of rRNA from a pol II promoter, indicating that the defect is in pol I transcription (1Nogi Y. Yano R. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3962-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 2Nogi Y. Vu L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, some but not all TBP mutants are defective in rRNA synthesis at their non-permissive temperature, indicating that TBP is also necessary for rRNA synthesis both in vivo and in vitro (18Cormack B.P. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 69: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 19Schultz M.C. Reeder R.H. Hahn S. Cell. 1992; 69: 697-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the phenotype of UAF null mutants is slightly leaky, and they exhibit a low level of residual rRNA synthesis from the pol I promoter in vivo (9Keys D.A. Lee B.-S. Dodd J.A. Nguyen T.T. Vu L. Fantino E. Burson L.M. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Correlating with this, when UAF is omitted from the reconstituted in vitro system, only a basal level of transcription is seen. By contrast, pol I, Rrn3p, and CF null mutants are not leaky (2, 6, 10, and 12); 2J. Keener, C. A. Josaitis, J. A. Dodd, and M. Nomura, unpublished data. they do not detectably transcribe rRNA from the pol I promoter in vivo, and these components are required for both high level transcription and basal transcription in vitro. Finally, the start site of pol I transcription reconstituted in vitro is identical to the start site in vivo. The correlations between pol I transcription in vivo and that reconstituted from purified components in vitro argue that conclusions drawn from thein vitro purified system may reflect in vivomechanisms.Yeast rDNA transcription in vitro is greatly stimulated by incubation of pol I and Rrn3p together before addition to the template and other proteins (12Yamamoto R.T. Nogi Y. Dodd J.A. Nomura M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3964-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This preincubation step became unnecessary (and did not stimulate transcription) if a purified complex of pol I and Rrn3p was substituted for the individual components. Formation of the pol I-Rrn3p complex prior to purification by column chromatography depended on preincubation of the individual components together, just as stimulation of transcription using the individual components. We conclude that the active form of pol I for specific transcription is the pol I-Rrn3p complex. Under our conditions, 30–50% of the pol I was complexed with Rrn3p in 1 h. Since recombinant Rrn3p was used, unmodified Rrn3p is most likely functional in transcription. A complex of pol I and Rrn3p, probably representing only a few percent of the total pol I in the cell, has been detected in yeast crude extracts and in more purified pol I preparations (8Milkereit P.

The minimal requirements for correctly initiated (basal) transcriptionin vitro are as follows: promoter DNA extending to −38 upstream of the start site and the protein components pol I, Rrn3p, and CF. These components transcribe the −38 and wild-type (−210) promoters with equal efficiency. The pol I-Rrn3p complex, like pol I alone, is capable only of nonspecific transcription (12Yamamoto R.T. Nogi Y. Dodd J.A. Nomura M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3964-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar); thus it seems likely that the requirement for CF is to direct the pol I-Rrn3p complex to the correct start site.The basal level of transcription observed in this minimal pol Iin vitro system does not require TBP and is not stimulated by addition of TBP, even in large quantities. Rather, TBP and UAF together activate basal transcription 10–50-fold. This activated level of transcription cannot be achieved from the −38 truncated promoter; it requires sequences upstream of −60. However, a promoter truncated to −76 is sufficient for activation.Our data show that the mechanism of action for TBP at the pol I promoter is fundamentally different from that at pol II or pol III promoters. In pol II transcription, TBP is required for basal transcription whether or not the TATA element is present, and when it is present, TATA is usually located around positions −25 to −35 (33Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). (There is an exception known where TBP is dispensable and transcription depends on the YY1 protein binding the initiator sequence near the start site (34Usheva A. Shenk T. Cell. 1994; 76: 1115-1121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Recently, another report of pol II transcription without TBP has appeared (35Wieczorek E. Brand M. Jacq X. Tora L. Nature. 1998; 393: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar).) In pol III transcription, TBP contained in the factor TFIIIB interacts around position −35 (36Kassavetis G.A. Joazeiro C.A.P. Pisano M. Geiduschek E.P. Colbert T. Hahn S. Blanco J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 1055-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Once bound to its site, TFIIIB is sufficient to direct initiation by pol III (37Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The role of TBP in yeast pol I transcription, to participate in activation with UAF, requires an upstream element that is distinct from the “core” region of the promoter required for basal transcription and is different from the role of TBP in pol II and pol III transcription.A previous report defined CF as including TBP, based on physical association of TBP with the known subunits of CF, Rrn6p, Rrn7p, and Rrn11p (11Lin W.L. Moorefield B. Payne J. Aprikian P. Mitomo K. Reeder R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6436-6443Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, that report could not resolve whether TBP was required for transcriptional activity of CF, since TBP was also present in the crude extracts used for transcription. In view of the results here showing the activity of CF in basal transcription without TBP, the affinity of TBP for CF subunits (11Lin W.L. Moorefield B. Payne J. Aprikian P. Mitomo K. Reeder R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6436-6443Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Steffan J.S. Keys D.A. Dodd J.A. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2551-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) should probably be interpreted as an interaction important for activation of basal transcription by TBP plus UAF. Indeed, TBP, as well as UAF, is necessary for incorporation of CF into a stable preinitiation complex (21Steffan J.S. Keys D.A. Dodd J.A. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2551-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and interaction between TBP and UAF is required for rDNA transcriptionin vivo (20Steffan J.S. Keys D.A. Vu L. Nomura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3752-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The mechanism for activation of basal transcription by TBP plus UAF may be stabilization of CF binding to the promoter.Mammalian pol I transcription has been extensively studied in vitro. Full activity in vitro from both mouse and human rDNA promoters requires pol I, upstream binding factor (UBF), and the TBP-containing transcription initiation factor TIF-IB/SL1 (38Bell S.B. Jantzen H.-M. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Two additional factors required in the mouse system, TIF-IA and -IC, associate with pol I prior to template binding and perhaps are part of the human pol I preparation (39Schnapp A. Grummt I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24588-24595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although UBF might be functionally analogous to UAF plus TBP of the yeast pol I system in that it appears to be stimulatory rather than essential (39Schnapp A. Grummt I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24588-24595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Bell S.B. Learned M. Jantzen H.-M. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 241: 1192-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 41Smith S.D. Oriahi E. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mahony O.-D. Rose K. Chen K. Rothblum L.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 6: 3105-3116Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar), there are several important differences between mammalian UBF and yeast UAF. First, UBF is a homodimer containing high mobility group domains, whereas yeast UAF is a multi-subunit complex that includes the core histones H3 and H4. There is no amino acid similarity between UBF and any of the five characterized subunits of UAF. Second, UBF does not appear to mediate stimulation by the upstream promoter element but rather stimulates transcription whether the upstream element is present or not (40Bell S.B. Learned M. Jantzen H.-M. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 241: 1192-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Third, UBF is a relatively abundant protein, at least 100 times more abundant than TIF-IB/SL1 (40Bell S.B. Learned M. Jantzen H.-M. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 241: 1192-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 42Reeder R.H. Pikaard C.S. McStay B. Nucleic Acids Mol. Biol. 1995; 9: 251-263Crossref Google Scholar). By contrast the intracellular amount of UAF is similar to that of CF, a few hundred molecules per cell, an amount roughly comparable to the number of rDNA promoters per cell (unpublished experiments cited in Ref. 9Keys D.A. Lee B.-S. Dodd J.A. Nguyen T.T. Vu L. Fantino E. Burson L.M. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, UBF may play an architectural role (42Reeder R.H. Pikaard C.S. McStay B. Nucleic Acids Mol. Biol. 1995; 9: 251-263Crossref Google Scholar, 43Moss T. Stefanovsky V.Y. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 25-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) distinct from the function of UAF in yeast. It is possible that an undiscovered mammalian homologue of UAF exists which might mediate the stimulatory activity of the upstream element.TIF-IB/SL1 in mammalian systems seems analogous to yeast CF in that it is essential for both basal and UBF-stimulated transcription in vitro, and sequence extending to −45 upstream of the start site suffices for basal transcription (40Bell S.B. Learned M. Jantzen H.-M. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 241: 1192-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Although there is obvious amino acid sequence similarity between subunits of the human and mouse factors TIF-IB and SL1 (44Heix J. Zomerdijk J.C. Ravanpay A. Tjian R. Grummt I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1733-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), no similarity is apparent between these factors and yeast CF. Another incongruity is that TBP is a subunit of TIF-IB/SL1 and appears to be required for transcriptional activity of the complex (45Zomerdijk J.C. Beckman H. Comai L. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 266: 2015-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), but as shown here, TBP is not required for the activity of yeast CF in basal transcription. However, the requirement of TBP for TIF-IB/SL1 transcriptional activity was shown using full human rDNA promoter and UBF (45Zomerdijk J.C. Beckman H. Comai L. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 266: 2015-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A formal possibility remains that TBP is not required for a basal level of human rDNA transcription.The results here confirm the proposed model for yeast pol I transcription (see Ref. 21Steffan J.S. Keys D.A. Dodd J.A. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2551-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar; see Fig. 7). pol I binds Rrn3p in solution, forming a complex that is active in specific transcription. The pol I-Rrn3p complex, together with CF and promoter DNA extending to −38 suffice for a basal level of transcription. An activated level of transcription requires UAF and TBP, in addition to the components necessary for basal transcription, and requires an upstream element that includes promoter DNA between −60 and −155. Perhaps such a relatively large region is required if the DNA is wrapped in nucleosome-like fashion by UAF as might be suggested by the presence of histones H3 and H4. All of the five protein components required for high level transcription of rDNAin vitro have been shown to be necessary for transcriptionin vivo as well. We believe this pol I transcription system reconstituted from purified components, which is faithful to transcription in vivo, represents the basic pol I initiation machinery and may be a useful tool to search for regulatory inputs and influences of nucleolar structure on rDNA synthesis. Of the three nuclear RNA polymerases, it is RNA polymerase I (pol I) 1The abbreviations used are: pol I, RNA polymerase I; UAF, upstream activation factor; CF, core factor; HA1, hemagglutinin antigen; TBP, TATA-binding protein; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; UBF, upstream binding factor. 1The abbreviations used are: pol I, RNA polymerase I; UAF, upstream activation factor; CF, core factor; HA1, hemagglutinin antigen; TBP, TATA-binding protein; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; UBF, upstream binding factor. that synthesizes large rRNAs. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a precursor 35 S rRNA is transcribed and then processed into the mature 18 S, 5.8 S, and 25 S rRNAs found in ribosomes. These rRNAs are encoded by 100–200 direct rDNA repeats on chromosome XII. Each spacer region between the pol I-driven 35 S transcription units contains a gene encoding the remaining rRNA, 5 S rRNA, transcribed by pol III. The only essential function of pol I in yeast is synthesis of the 35 S rRNA transcript, since the lethal phenotype of a deletion in the second largest subunit of pol I can be rescued by synthesis of the 35 S rRNA transcript by pol II from a GAL promoter placed correctly upstream of the 35 S transcription unit on a high copy plasmid (1Nogi Y. Yano R. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3962-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This provided a screen for mutants dependent on pol II-driven synthesis of rRNA from the GAL promoter (2Nogi Y. Vu L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7025-7030Google Scholar). Such rrn mutants were expected to be defective in pol I activity in vivo, and confirming this, mutations in genes encoding subunits of pol I (those not shared with either pol II or pol III) were isolated (2Nogi Y. Vu L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7025-7030Google Scholar). Other mutations that also caused defects in rRNA synthesis (as assessed by pulse labelingin vivo) eventually proved to lie in genes encoding (subunits of) pol I transcription factors. An important advance in the study of yeast pol I was the development of an in vitro transcription system using a crude extract (3Riggs D.L. Nomura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7596-7603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18091-18094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schultz M.C. Choe S.Y. Reeder R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and, later, fractionated extracts (6Keys D.A. Vu L. Steffan J.S. Dodd J.A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3692-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Extracts fromrrn mutant strains were not active, and their activity could be restored by addition of fractions from a wild-type extract. This was used as an assay for the purification of pol I transcription factors (6Keys D.A. Vu L. Steffan J.S. Dodd J.A. Yamamoto R.T. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2349-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The availability of cloned RRN genes, which could be tagged with the hemagglutinin antigen (HA) or hexahistidine, greatly facilitated purification. In this way, the multi-subunit factors, core factor (CF), and upstream activation factor (UAF), and the single subunit factor Rrn3p were identified and shown to be necessary for activity in the crude in vitro system as well as in vivo (6Keys D.A.

Like higher eukaryotes, the yeast pol I promoter is composed of a core element that is essential for transcription, located roughly between +5 and −40 relative to the start site of transcription, and an upstream element from roughly −60 to −155 which is necessary for high level transcription (13Musters W. Knol J. Dekker A.F. van Heerikhuizen H. Planta R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9661-9678Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Kulkens T. Riggs D.L. Heck J.D. Planta R.J. Nomura M.

In yeast, the upstream element is required for formation of a stable pre-initiation complex (9Keys D.A. Lee B.-S. Dodd J.A. Nguyen T.T. Vu L. Fantino E. Burson L.M. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). UAF initiates stable complex formation and appears to bind the upstream element tightly, because once bound, it is not readily transferred to a competing template (9Keys D.A. Lee B.-S. Dodd J.A.

The biochemical pathway by which this organism converts 4-chlorobenzoate to 4-hydroxybenzoate consists of three enzymes: 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA ligase, 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase, and 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase.

On the basis of the structural similarity between these two enzymes, the active site of the thioesterase has been identified and a catalytic mechanism proposed.

On the basis of the structural similarity between these two enzymes, the active site of the thioesterase has been identified and a catalytic mechanism proposed. Within recent years, a variety of soil-dwelling microorganisms have been identified that catabolize halogenated hydrocarbons appearing in the environment due to commercial production and careless waste disposal (1Hileman B.C. Chem. Eng. News. 1993; 71: 11-20Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These bacterial species have attracted significant research attention for their possible employment as bioremediation agents (2Abramowicz D.A. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 1990; 10: 241-251Crossref Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 3Commandeur L.C. Parsons R.J. Biodegradation. 1990; 1: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 4Higson F.K. Adv. Appl.

Of particular interest is the soil-dwelling microbe,Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS-3, which is capable of surviving on 4-chlorobenzoate as its sole source of carbon (6Klages U. Markus A. Lingens F. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 64-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Klages U. Lingens F. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. Parasitenkd. Infektionskr. Hgy. Zweit Naturweiss. Abt. Mikrobiol. C Orig. 1980; 1: 215-223Google Scholar).The metabolic pathway by which 4-chlorobenzoate is degraded to 4-hydroxybenzoate in Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS-3,Arthrobacter sp. strains SU and TM1, andAlcaligenes sp. strain ALP83 is outlined in Scheme FS1 (for a review, see Ref. 8Dunaway-Mariano D. Babbitt P.C. Biodegradation. 1994; 5: 259-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).The first step in this biochemical scheme, namely the thioesterification of 4-chlorobenzoate with CoA, requires one molecule of Mg2+-ATP and is catalyzed by 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA ligase. The next step is catalyzed by 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase and involves the hydrolytic substitution of a hydroxyl for a chloro group at the para-position of the aromatic ring. In the last step, the thioester linkage between the CoA moiety and the 4-hydroxybenzoyl group is cleaved by 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase, hereafter referred to simply as thioesterase. The genes encoding these three enzymes are organized in an operon under the positive control of 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA (8Dunaway-Mariano D. Babbitt P.C. Biodegradation. 1994; 5: 259-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Presently, little is known concerning the evolutionary history of these 4-chlorobenzoate degrading enzymes. The exposure of bacteria to such compounds could have first occurred with the introduction of synthetic chlorinated aromatics into the environment and thus, the acquisition of the 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA pathway genes could have taken place within the last few decades. On the other hand, it is known that a variety of chlorinated aromatic compounds are produced by certain organisms as secondary metabolites (9Gribble G.W. J. Chem. Education. 1994; 71: 907-911Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, 4-chlorobenzoate could be a natural product or alternatively, could be generated through degradation of a more highly functionalized biosynthetic chlorinated aromatic compound. In either of these cases, however, the genes encoding the ligase, the dehalogenase, and the thioesterase would have evolved long ago. Irrespective of the exact age of the enzymes in this pathway, it is expected that they evolved from enzymes already functioning in primary metabolic pathways. In an effort to trace the lineage of these proteins, both amino acid sequence analyses and structural investigations have been carried out on the enzymes fromPseudomonas sp. strain CBS3 (10Babbitt P.C. Kenyon G.L. Martin B.M. Charest H. Slyvestre M. Scholten J.D. Chang K.-H. Liang P.-H. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5594-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 11Benning M.M.

From these studies, it is now known that the 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA ligase belongs to a large family of enzymes which function primarily in thiol template-directed fatty acid and polyketide biosynthetic pathways, while the 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase shares ancestry with the 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase family (8Dunaway-Mariano D. Babbitt P.C. Biodegradation. 1994; 5: 259-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Babbitt P.C. Kenyon G.L. Martin B.M. Charest H. Slyvestre M. Scholten J.D. Chang K.-H. Liang P.-H.

Biol. 1996; 6: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).The lineage of the thioesterase, however, has remained elusive. From previous biochemical studies of the Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS3 enzyme (13Chang K.-H. Liang P.-H. Beck W. Scholten J.D. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5605-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14.Taylor, K. L., Ph. D. Thesis, 1996, University of Maryland, College Park, MD.Google Scholar), it is known that this thioesterase is an efficient catalyst (k cat = 14 s−1;K m = 5 μm), exhibits a high level of substrate specificity, and is largely resistant to inactivation by chemical modification agents directed toward serine, cysteine, lysine, and histidine residues. In addition, the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase is considerably smaller than other thioesterases and earlier searches of the protein sequence data banks failed to reveal structural homology with known proteins (8Dunaway-Mariano D. Babbitt P.C. Biodegradation. 1994; 5: 259-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Babbitt P.C. Kenyon G.L. Martin B.M. Charest H. Slyvestre M. Scholten J.D. Chang K.-H. Liang P.-H. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5594-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity, primary structure, and apparent absence of serine, cysteine, or histidine catalytic residues distinguish this protein from all other thioesterases characterized to date.As described here, we initiated an x-ray crystallographic investigation of the Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS-3 thioesterase to gain further insight into both its catalytic mechanism and evolutionary origin. Quite unexpectedly, the three-dimensional structure of this thioesterase is remarkably similar to that of β-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydrase from Escherichia coli (15Leesong M. Henderson B.S. Gillig J.R. Schwab J.M. Smith J.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 253-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). By superimposing the two structures, it has been possible to identify the probable active site region of the thioesterase and to propose a catalytic mechanism whereby the carboxylate side chain of Asp17activates a water molecule for subsequent nucleophilic attack at the thioester carbonyl carbon of the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA substrate. In addition, recent amino acid sequence searches have identified several similarly sized proteins of unknown function as probable homologues to the thioesterase. Conservation of several key thioesterase structural and/or functional residues among these homologues, including the putative Asp17 catalytic base, suggest that these unknown proteins might display thioesterase activities.DISCUSSIONIn an effort to understand the biological origin of the thioesterase described here, its primary structure was employed to search recent available protein sequence data banks for homologous proteins. A Blastp search (29Altschul S.F. Madden TL. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59166) Google Scholar) identified four protein sequences which showed significant identity to the thioesterase primary structure: hypothetical proteins from Helicobacter pylori (U75328; hyp_hp), Hemophilus influenzae (P44679; hyp_hi),Synechocystis sp. (D64002; hyp_syn), and Aquifex aeolicus (AE000743; hyp_aa). Like the thioesterase, these proteins are small with overall lengths between 128 and 138 amino acid residues. The sequence identities determined from pairwise alignments with the program Bestfit, as implemented in the GCG software package, ranged from ∼21 to 36% (30Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11516) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig.6, the amino acid sequence alignment of these five proteins reveals five positions (Asp17, Gly20, Val22, Ala34, and Pro133 of the thioesterase sequence) at which the residue is invariant and numerous positions matching amino acid side chain size, hydrophobicity, and/or charge. This pattern is suggestive of similar folds among these proteins.Figure 6Amino acid sequence alignments. The alignment shown was constructed according to the program Pileup (GCG) using the thioesterase from Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS3 (C42560; thio_pcbs3) and the hypothetical proteins from H. pylori (U75328; hyp_hp), H. influenzae (P44679; hyp_hi), Synechocystis sp. (D64002; hyp_syn) and A. aeolicus (AE000743; hyp_aa). Secondary structural elements corresponding to the thioesterase model are indicated asarrows and rectangles for β-sheets and α-helices, respectively. Those amino acid residues that are fully or partially conserved are indicated by asterisks.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)It is noteworthy that several of the residues which contribute to the Asp17 containing active site loop of the thioesterase are conserved among these four proteins of unknown function. Examination of the loop structure reveals that the carboxylate side chain of Asp15 (replaced by a Glu residue in hyp-aa) may stabilize the Type III turn through hydrogen bonding to the backbone amide group of Glu12. Gly20 on the other hand, resides in a Type I turn while the side chain of Val22 contributes to the hydrophobic core. The side chain of Asp17 is directed off this loop, into the active site where it serves as the putative base catalyst in the hydrolysis of the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioester. Assuming that the folds of these four proteins are similar to that of the thioesterase, the conservation of both the active site loop and the Asp17 base suggests that these proteins may function in the catalysis of related thioester hydrolysis reactions.A particularly intriguing result to emerge from the present study is the fact that there is no evidence to suggest that the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase is structurally related to known thioesterases functioning in primary or secondary metabolic pathways. The thioesterases of fatty acid and polyketide synthases are subunits or subdomains within large protein structures while other thioesterases are typically independent proteins, commonly homodimers or homotetramers with molecular weights ranging from 25,000 to 40,000 (31Broustas C.G.

The thioesterases of the polyketide synthases share significant amino acid sequence identities with the animal fatty acid thioesterases Types I or II (32Schneider A. Marahiel M.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 169: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Most thioesterases of different function and/or source (plant versus animal versus bacterial) do not, however, share significant sequence identity. Nevertheless, a majority of the thioesterases characterized to date contain the lipase/esterase motif GXSXG and/or C-terminal GXH sequence (33Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9238-9245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) characteristic of charge-relay-hydrolases which use a serine in nucleophilic catalysis and a histidine in combination with a second proton acceptor (typically an Asp) as the catalytic base. In some thioesterases, cysteine substitutes for the nucleophilic serine (31Broustas C.G. Larkins L.K. Uhler M.D. Hajra A.K. J. Biol.

The recent x-ray crystal structure of lux-specific myristol-ACP thioesterase from Vibrio harveyi(35Lawson D.M. Derewenda U. Serre L. Ferri S. Szittner R. Wei Y. Meighen E.A. Derewenda Z.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9382-9388Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a representative of this group, reveals a tertiary structure which closely resembles the consensus fold of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily (36Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1830) Google Scholar).Based on the crystallographic analysis of the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase reported in this paper, it is evident that this enzyme is unrelated in both structure and catalytic mechanism to the active site Ser/Cys family of thioesterases. Mechanistically, the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase shares common ground with the (human) β-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA thioesterase (of the valine catabolic pathway) (37Hawes J.W. Jaskiewicz J. Shimomura Y. Huang B. Bunting J. Harper E.T. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26430-26434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) in that the substrate thioester C=O is polarized by hydrogen bonds donated from backbone amide groups and the attacking water is bound and activated by an active site carboxylate residue. The folds of these two proteins are, however, unrelated. The β-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA thioesterase and coincidentally, the 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase, are members of the enoyl-CoA enzyme superfamily.The amino acid sequence searches conducted in this study linked the primary structure of the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase to a group of small bacterial proteins which, at the present time, have unknown function. The x-ray crystallographic studies of the thioesterase have, on the other hand, linked its tertiary structure to that of theE. coli β-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydrase. The absence of significant amino acid sequence identity between these two proteins is consistent with the high level of primary structural divergence observed among the thioesterase group as a whole and, consequently, our working hypothesis is that the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase and the E. coli β-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydrase share common ancestry.The active sites of the thioesterase and dehydrase are formed through the union of two folded protein chains. The five-stranded β-sheet of the thioesterase monomer becomes, in the dimer, a 10-stranded β-sheet which reverses its direction at the subunit interface thereby creating a solvent accessible crevice encircled by loops. The same pattern is observed with the dehydrase despite its additional 51 amino acids which add a β-α-β motif to the N-terminal region of the protein chain. The active site crevices observed in these two structures are wide and deep. In the case of the dehydrase, the active site region can accommodate a long acyl chain by inserting it between the central α-helix and the inner surface of the subunit β-sheet. The entrances of both enzyme active sites accommodate large substrate appendages, the acyl carrier protein in the case of the dehydrase and CoA in the case of the thioesterase.Given the large potential for adaptation of this active site design to new substrates and chemistries it is expected that the thioesterase/dehydrase fold is exploited in other proteins functioning in fatty acid or polyketide metabolism. The (3R)-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP dehydrase which shares significant sequence homology with the β-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydrase (15Leesong M. Henderson B.S. Gillig J.R. Schwab J.M. Smith J.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 253-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) is one example. The four proteins identified on the basis of primary structure homology with the thioesterase (Fig. 6), constitute at least one additional example. Future identifications of other enzyme relatives will, on the other hand, have to rely on x-ray crystallographic structural determinations since a high level of amino acid sequence divergence (exemplified by the thioesterase and dehydrase pair) may otherwise erase any hints of common ancestry and fold. Within recent years, a variety of soil-dwelling microorganisms have been identified that catabolize halogenated hydrocarbons appearing in the environment due to commercial production and careless waste disposal (1Hileman B.C. Chem. Eng. News. 1993; 71: 11-20Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These bacterial species have attracted significant research attention for their possible employment as bioremediation agents (2Abramowicz D.A. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 1990; 10: 241-251Crossref Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 3Commandeur L.C. Parsons R.J. Biodegradation. 1990; 1: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 4Higson F.K. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 37: 135-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 5Slater J.H. Bull A.T. Hardman D.J. J. Biodegrad. 1995; 6: 181-189Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the soil-dwelling microbe,Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS-3, which is capable of surviving on 4-chlorobenzoate as its sole source of carbon (6Klages U. Markus A. Lingens F. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 64-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Klages U. Lingens F. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. Parasitenkd. Infektionskr. Hgy. Zweit Naturweiss. Abt. Mikrobiol. C Orig. 1980; 1: 215-223Google Scholar). The metabolic pathway by which 4-chlorobenzoate is degraded to 4-hydroxybenzoate in Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS-3,Arthrobacter sp. strains SU and TM1, andAlcaligenes sp. strain ALP83 is outlined in Scheme FS1 (for a review, see Ref. 8Dunaway-Mariano D. Babbitt P.C. Biodegradation. 1994; 5: 259-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The first step in this biochemical scheme, namely the thioesterification of 4-chlorobenzoate with CoA, requires one molecule of Mg2+-ATP and is catalyzed by 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA ligase. The next step is catalyzed by 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase and involves the hydrolytic substitution of a hydroxyl for a chloro group at the para-position of the aromatic ring. In the last step, the thioester linkage between the CoA moiety and the 4-hydroxybenzoyl group is cleaved by 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase, hereafter referred to simply as thioesterase. The genes encoding these three enzymes are organized in an operon under the positive control of 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA (8Dunaway-Mariano D. Babbitt P.C. Biodegradation. 1994; 5: 259-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Presently, little is known concerning the evolutionary history of these 4-chlorobenzoate degrading enzymes. The exposure of bacteria to such compounds could have first occurred with the introduction of synthetic chlorinated aromatics into the environment and thus, the acquisition of the 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA pathway genes could have taken place within the last few decades. On the other hand, it is known that a variety of chlorinated aromatic compounds are produced by certain organisms as secondary metabolites (9Gribble G.W. J. Chem. Education. 1994; 71: 907-911Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, 4-chlorobenzoate could be a natural product or alternatively, could be generated through degradation of a more highly functionalized biosynthetic chlorinated aromatic compound. In either of these cases, however, the genes encoding the ligase, the dehalogenase, and the thioesterase would have evolved long ago. Irrespective of the exact age of the enzymes in this pathway, it is expected that they evolved from enzymes already functioning in primary metabolic pathways. In an effort to trace the lineage of these proteins, both amino acid sequence analyses and structural investigations have been carried out on the enzymes fromPseudomonas sp. strain CBS3 (10Babbitt P.C. Kenyon G.L. Martin B.M. Charest H. Slyvestre M. Scholten J.D. Chang K.-H. Liang P.-H. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5594-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 11Benning M.M.

From these studies, it is now known that the 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA ligase belongs to a large family of enzymes which function primarily in thiol template-directed fatty acid and polyketide biosynthetic pathways, while the 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase shares ancestry with the 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase family (8Dunaway-Mariano D. Babbitt P.C. Biodegradation. 1994; 5: 259-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Babbitt P.C. Kenyon G.L. Martin B.M. Charest H. Slyvestre M. Scholten J.D. Chang K.-H. Liang P.-H. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5594-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 12Engel C. Wierenga R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The lineage of the thioesterase, however, has remained elusive. From previous biochemical studies of the Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS3 enzyme (13Chang K.-H. Liang P.-H. Beck W. Scholten J.D. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5605-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14.Taylor, K. L., Ph. D. Thesis, 1996, University of Maryland, College Park, MD.Google Scholar), it is known that this thioesterase is an efficient catalyst (k cat = 14 s−1;K m = 5 μm), exhibits a high level of substrate specificity, and is largely resistant to inactivation by chemical modification agents directed toward serine, cysteine, lysine, and histidine residues. In addition, the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase is considerably smaller than other thioesterases and earlier searches of the protein sequence data banks failed to reveal structural homology with known proteins (8Dunaway-Mariano D. Babbitt P.C. Biodegradation. 1994; 5: 259-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Babbitt P.C. Kenyon G.L. Martin B.M. Charest H. Slyvestre M. Scholten J.D. Chang K.-H. Liang P.-H. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5594-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity, primary structure, and apparent absence of serine, cysteine, or histidine catalytic residues distinguish this protein from all other thioesterases characterized to date. As described here, we initiated an x-ray crystallographic investigation of the Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS-3 thioesterase to gain further insight into both its catalytic mechanism and evolutionary origin. Quite unexpectedly, the three-dimensional structure of this thioesterase is remarkably similar to that of β-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydrase from Escherichia coli (15Leesong M. Henderson B.S. Gillig J.R. Schwab J.M. Smith J.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 253-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). By superimposing the two structures, it has been possible to identify the probable active site region of the thioesterase and to propose a catalytic mechanism whereby the carboxylate side chain of Asp17activates a water molecule for subsequent nucleophilic attack at the thioester carbonyl carbon of the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA substrate. In addition, recent amino acid sequence searches have identified several similarly sized proteins of unknown function as probable homologues to the thioesterase. Conservation of several key thioesterase structural and/or functional residues among these homologues, including the putative Asp17 catalytic base, suggest that these unknown proteins might display thioesterase activities. DISCUSSIONIn an effort to understand the biological origin of the thioesterase described here, its primary structure was employed to search recent available protein sequence data banks for homologous proteins. A Blastp search (29Altschul S.F. Madden TL. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59166) Google Scholar) identified four protein sequences which showed significant identity to the thioesterase primary structure: hypothetical proteins from Helicobacter pylori (U75328; hyp_hp), Hemophilus influenzae (P44679; hyp_hi),Synechocystis sp. (D64002; hyp_syn), and Aquifex aeolicus (AE000743; hyp_aa). Like the thioesterase, these proteins are small with overall lengths between 128 and 138 amino acid residues. The sequence identities determined from pairwise alignments with the program Bestfit, as implemented in the GCG software package, ranged from ∼21 to 36% (30Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11516) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig.6, the amino acid sequence alignment of these five proteins reveals five positions (Asp17, Gly20, Val22, Ala34, and Pro133 of the thioesterase sequence) at which the residue is invariant and numerous positions matching amino acid side chain size, hydrophobicity, and/or charge. This pattern is suggestive of similar folds among these proteins.It is noteworthy that several of the residues which contribute to the Asp17 containing active site loop of the thioesterase are conserved among these four proteins of unknown function. Examination of the loop structure reveals that the carboxylate side chain of Asp15 (replaced by a Glu residue in hyp-aa) may stabilize the Type III turn through hydrogen bonding to the backbone amide group of Glu12. Gly20 on the other hand, resides in a Type I turn while the side chain of Val22 contributes to the hydrophobic core. The side chain of Asp17 is directed off this loop, into the active site where it serves as the putative base catalyst in the hydrolysis of the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioester.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26430-26434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) in that the substrate thioester C=O is polarized by hydrogen bonds donated from backbone amide groups and the attacking water is bound and activated by an active site carboxylate residue. The folds of these two proteins are, however, unrelated. The β-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA thioesterase and coincidentally, the 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase, are members of the enoyl-CoA enzyme superfamily. The amino acid sequence searches conducted in this study linked the primary structure of the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase to a group of small bacterial proteins which, at the present time, have unknown function. The x-ray crystallographic studies of the thioesterase have, on the other hand, linked its tertiary structure to that of theE. coli β-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydrase. The absence of significant amino acid sequence identity between these two proteins is consistent with the high level of primary structural divergence observed among the thioesterase group as a whole and, consequently, our working hypothesis is that the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase and the E. coli β-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydrase share common ancestry. The active sites of the thioesterase and dehydrase are formed through the union of two folded protein chains. The five-stranded β-sheet of the thioesterase monomer becomes, in the dimer, a 10-stranded β-sheet which reverses its direction at the subunit interface thereby creating a solvent accessible crevice encircled by loops. The same pattern is observed with the dehydrase despite its additional 51 amino acids which add a β-α-β motif to the N-terminal region of the protein chain. The active site crevices observed in these two structures are wide and deep. In the case of the dehydrase, the active site region can accommodate a long acyl chain by inserting it between the central α-helix and the inner surface of the subunit β-sheet. The entrances of both enzyme active sites accommodate large substrate appendages, the acyl carrier protein in the case of the dehydrase and CoA in the case of the thioesterase. Given the large potential for adaptation of this active site design to new substrates and chemistries it is expected that the thioesterase/dehydrase fold is exploited in other proteins functioning in fatty acid or polyketide metabolism. The (3R)-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP dehydrase which shares significant sequence homology with the β-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydrase (15Leesong M. Henderson B.S. Gillig J.R. Schwab J.M. Smith J.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 253-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) is one example. The four proteins identified on the basis of primary structure homology with the thioesterase (Fig. 6), constitute at least one additional example. Future identifications of other enzyme relatives will, on the other hand, have to rely on x-ray crystallographic structural determinations since a high level of amino acid sequence divergence (exemplified by the thioesterase and dehydrase pair) may otherwise erase any hints of common ancestry and fold. We thank Dr. W. W. Cleland for helpful discussions and W. Zhang, L. Luo, and Dr. H. Xiang for protein samples. We appreciate the supportive comments from both reviewers."
https://openalex.org/W2167260676,"Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor (LOX-1) is a recently identified receptor for oxidized low-density lipoprotein, one of the major atherogenic substances. Although LOX-1 was reported to be expressed abundantly in endothelial cells, including atheromatous lesions, the regulation of LOX-1 gene has not yet been clarified. In the present study, we isolated the rat LOX-1 gene and investigated the regulation of gene expression. The rat LOX-1 gene was encoded by a single copy gene spanning over 19 kilobases and consisted of eight exons. Exon boundaries correlated well with the functional domain boundaries of the receptor protein. The promoter region contained putative TATA and CAAT boxes and multiple cis-elements such as NF-κB, AP-1 and AP-2 sites, and a shear stress response element. Northern blot analysis revealed that LOX-1 gene expression was up-regulated 9-fold by shear stress, 21-fold by lipopolysaccharide, and 4-fold by tumor necrosis factor-α, in cultured vascular endothelial cells. LOX-1 was also expressed in macrophages but not in vascular smooth muscle cells. These data provide important information for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of LOX-1 gene regulation and suggest a role for LOX-1 in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Invest. 1989; 84: 1086-1095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that antioxidant drugs slow the progression of atherosclerosis (4Carew T.E. Schwenke D.C. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1987; 84: 5928-5931Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). OxLDL possesses many atherogenic properties. First, OxLDL is thought to be taken up into macrophages via scavenger receptors, which promotes the deposition of lipid-laden foam cells in the vascular walls and leads to fatty streaks (1Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, recent data indicate that OxLDL alters various endothelial functions. OxLDL induces endothelial expression of several proteins, including adhesion molecules (6Khan B.V. Parthasarathy S.S. Alexander R.W. Medford R.M. J. Clin.

Nature. 1990; 344: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), some of which might be involved in endothelial cell-mediated recruitment of monocytes/macrophages into the intima. OxLDL also attenuates the endothelium-dependent vasodilatory response through reduced production of nitric oxide (12Kugiyama K. Kerns S.A. Morrisett J.D. Roberts R. Henry P.D. Nature. 1990; 344: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 13Yokoyama M. Hirata K. Miyake R. Akita H. Ishikawa Y. Fukuzaki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). It has long been thought that there is a specific endothelial receptor for OxLDL. In 1997, Sawamura et al. (14Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar) identified a novel receptor for OxLDL (LOX-1) using expression cloning with bovine cultured endothelial cells. LOX-1 is a membrane protein abundantly expressed in endothelial cells. It binds, internalizes, and degrades OxLDL, but not native LDL or acetylated LDL. Its mRNA was shown to be expressed in human atheromatous lesions. This endothelial receptor might mediate some of the actions of OxLDL in the endothelium. The biologic roles of LOX-1, however, remain to be determined. In a previous study, we performed rat LOX-1 cDNA cloning and demonstrated that it encodes a single-transmembrane protein with its N terminus in the cytoplasm (15Nagase M. Hirose S. Sawamura T. Masaki T. Fujita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 496-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The extracellular region consists of a spacer, 46-amino acid triple repeats, and C-type lectin-like domains. Quite unexpectedly, LOX-1 expression was markedly (>20-fold) up-regulated in the aorta of hypertensive rats (16Nagase M. Hirose S. Fujita T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1417-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which implies a pathophysiologic role for LOX-1 in hypertension or in hypertensive vascular remodeling. However, the genomic structure of LOX-1 or its regulation of expression in vitro has not yet been reported in any species. Here we report the genomic organization of rat LOX-1 and identified several consensus sequences in the 5′-flanking region. We demonstrated that the LOX-1 gene expression was markedly up-regulated by shear stress (9-fold), bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (21-fold), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (4-fold), in cultured vascular endothelial cells. We also examined its expression in cells other than endothelial cells, such as macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells. A rat genomic DNA library (Sau3AI partial digest constructed in the λ phage, EMBL3 SP6/T7) (CLONTECH) was screened with a rat LOX-1 cDNA probe (432-bp XhoI/HindIII fragment,probe 1 in Fig. 1 A). Approximately 5 × 105 phages were plated at a density of 30,000 plaques/15-cm plate, and two replica nitrocellulose filters were prepared from each plate. High stringency screening was performed with hybridization in 50% formamide and final washes in 0.1 × SSC (1 × SSC is 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) containing 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. Plaques that produced positive signals on both replicas were selected and purified. The second and the third rounds of screening were carried out under the same conditions to isolate positive clones. Positive clones were digested withXhoI, EcoRI, SacI, HindIII, and ApaI. Each restriction fragment was subcloned into pBluescript II SK−. The 3′ portion was determined by PCR. Rat genomic DNA (100 ng) prepared from Wistar rat kidneys was amplified by PCR with an Expand Long Template PCR System (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). Primer sets used were: 5′-AATCTGTGTCAGGACCATGGAGAACCCTCA-3′ (forward 1) and 5′-GCTTCCAGCTGAGGGTGTCTATCTGTTCCT-3′ (reverse 1) for RLG11, 5′-GAATCAGAATCTTCAAGAAGCCCTGCAGAG-3′ (forward 2) and 5′-GGGCCCATGGAAGAGGTAACAGTTTTCTTT-3′ (reverse 2) for RLG12, 5′-AAAGAAAACTGTTACCTCTTCCATGGGCCC-3′ (forward 3) and 5′-CAGCTGTCAAGGCCACATGTTTTACACCCA-3′ (reverse 3) for RLG13, and 5′-AGGAGTCCCAGAGAGAACTGAAGGAACAGA-3′ (forward 4) and 5′-CTGAAGAGTTTGCAGCTCTCTGCAGGGCTT-3′ (reverse 4) for RLG14. The amplification was carried out for 35 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 2 min. The products were subcloned into pBluescript II. Nucleotide sequences were determined on both strands using the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method with a Sequi Therm Long-Read cycle sequencing kit (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI) and an Automated Laser Fluorescent DNA Sequencer (model 4000; LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). The sequence and consensus nucleotide motif analyses were performed using the GENETYX-MAC software (Software Development, Tokyo, Japan). Southern blot analysis was carried out according to Sambrook et al. (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.16-9.19Google Scholar). Rat genomic DNA (20 μg each) was digested with restriction enzymes (PstI,EcoRV, EcoRI, and BamHI), electrophoresed on a 0.7% agarose gel, and transferred onto a nylon membrane filter. An EcoRI/BamHI genomic DNA fragment (1.8 kb, probe 2 in Fig. 1 A) was used as a probe. Hybridization and wash were performed as described for the screening. Primer extension analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Promega, Madison, WI). In brief, a synthetic oligonucleotide, 5′-GCCACATGACTTCTGATCAGGCTGGCCATT-3′ (P1) (10 pmol), was end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeled primer (1 pmol) was annealed to poly(A)+ RNA (20 μg) from the rat cultured vascular endothelial cells (described below) at 58 °C for 1 h and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The hybridized primer-RNA complex was extended using 1 unit of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase at 42 °C for 1 h. Following ethanol precipitation, the extension products were separated on a 7 m urea/6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel and visualized with autoradiography. The mobility of the extended products was compared with that of a [γ-32P]dATP dideoxy sequence ladder obtained using the same primer. A 3.2-kb HindIII fragment of λRLG3, which contained the translation initiation site, was subcloned in the HindIII site of pBluescript II and used as a template. A single-stranded antisense DNA was synthesized with this template, end-labeled P1 primer, and T7 DNA polymerase. The products were digested with NheI, purified using alkaline gel electrophoresis, and used as a probe. The probe was hybridized to 20 μg of rat endothelial poly(A)+ RNA at 30 °C overnight. Nonannealed nucleic acids were digested with 1000 units/ml S1 nuclease. The nuclease-resistant products were ethanol-precipitated and electrophoresed in parallel with the primer extension product on a 7 m urea/6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel followed by autoradiography. Primary cultures of endothelial cells (ECs) were obtained from the rat aorta or the descending thoracic aorta of a bovine fetus by brief collagenase digestion of the intimal lining, as described previously (18Korenaga R. Ando J. Tsuboi H. Yang W. Sakuma I. Toyo-oka T. Kamiya A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). An established cultured vascular smooth muscle cell line (A10 cells) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in a controlled atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C. ECs within the 20th passage were exposed to shear stress (see below), bacterial LPS (Escherichia coli 055:B5) (Difco) or TNF-α (Sigma). Six-week-old male Wistar rats (n = 10) were purchased from Tokyo Laboratory Animal Center (Tokyo, Japan). The rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). A 16-gauge elastatic needle was cannulated into the trachea. Alveolar macrophages were recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% EDTA. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested by washing the peritoneal cavities with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% EDTA. ECs were exposed to a well defined steady laminar flow using a parallel plate flow chamber, as described previously (19Wang Y. Shin W.S. Kawaguchi H. Inukai M. Kato M. Sakamoto A. Uehara Y. Miyamoto M. Shimamoto N. Korenaga R. Ando J. Toyo-oka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5647-5655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In brief, the flow chamber consisted of upper acrylic and lower glass plates, which were separated by a rectangular silicon rubber gasket (250 μm thick). ECs were cultured on the glass plate (100 × 70 mm) prior to assembly of the chamber. The inner dimensions of the chamber were 85 × 55 × 0.25 mm. The chamber was filled with culture medium. A peristaltic pump and silicone tubing (ATTO Co., Tokyo, Japan) were used to generate a constant flow. The entire system was placed in an incubator maintained in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C. The intensity of fluid shear stress (τ, dyne/cm2) was calculated as follows: τ = 6μQ/a 2 b, where μ is the fluid viscosity (0.0094 poise at 37 °C);Q is the velocity of the fluid (ml/s); a (0.02 cm) and b (1.4 cm) are cross-sectional dimensions of the flow path. Fluid shear stress (20 dynes/cm2) was applied to the ECs for 0–24 h. Control experiments were simultaneously performed in a static condition with cells derived from the same pool. Total RNA was prepared using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified using an mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). RNA was fractionated on a formaldehyde-denatured 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane filter. The probe was synthesized using reverse transcription-PCR with total RNA from ECs and the following primers: 5′-CTGGCTCTGGCATGAAGAAA-3′ and 5′-CGCCTTCTTTTGACATATACTG-3′. The amplification was carried out for 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 43 °C for 1 min, and 75 °C for 3 min with Pfupolymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random primer labeling method. After prehybridization, nylon membranes were hybridized with the32P-labeled cDNA probe (1 × 106cpm/ml) in a solution containing 50% formamide at 42 °C for 16 h. Blots were then washed in 0.2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. Filters were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR5 film with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. For quantitative analysis, the Northern filters were exposed to an imaging plate and the radioactivity of the bands was quantified as photo-stimulated luminescence with a Bioimage Analyzer (model BAS 2000; Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). The photo-stimulated luminescence value for LOX-1 was standardized with that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Rabbit antiserum was raised against rat LOX-1. In brief, the extracellular region of LOX-1 (amino acid residues 60–364) was subcloned into a (His)6-tagged vector. Expression of the recombinant proteins was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The fusion proteins were then purified using a nickel-agarose column. Rabbits were injected subcutaneously with the purified protein (250 μg) emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma). For boost injections, the rabbits were immunized with 250 μg of the protein emulsified with an equal volume of incomplete Freund's adjuvant every 2 weeks. Bleeding was performed 10 days after the third boost. Proteins from extracts of ECs were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with 1:1000 dilution of the rabbit antiserum against rat LOX-1. After washing with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with 1:5000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 3 h. Proteins were visualized by adding 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. We isolated genomic clones encoding rat LOX-1 using a combination of screening and PCR. Fig. 1 A summarizes the cloning strategy, genomic structure, and partial restriction map. A rat genomic library was screened with a rat LOX-1 cDNA probe (probe 1 in Fig. 1 A). Four genomic clones (λRLG1–4) were isolated from 6 × 105 plaques. The four clones did not cover the 3′ end of the LOX-1 gene, therefore, the missing portion was determined using PCR (RLG11–14). The nucleotide sequence was determined using the restriction fragments of the six overlapping clones (λRLG2, λRLG3, RLG11–14). Comparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences revealed that the coding region consisted of 8 exons distributed over 19 kilobases. Exons 1–8 corresponded to nucleotides 1 through 73, 74 through 175, 176 through 421, 422 through 559, 560 through 697, 698 through 834, 835 through 950, and 951 through 1095. Nucleotide sequences of these exons were identical to sequences obtained from the rat aortic cDNA. Introns 1 through 7 were determined to be 4.0, 2.6, 2.8, 3.1, 4.1, 1.2, and 0.3 kb long. Exon-intron junctions had consensus splice sequences conforming to the gt-ag rule (Fig. 1 B). Fig. 1 C shows the exon organization in relation to the protein structure. Exon 1 encodes the 5′-untranslated region and the N-terminal 25 amino acids in the intracellular domain. Exon 2 encodes 34 amino acids, which is mostly the transmembrane domain. Exon 3 encodes 82 amino acids and corresponds to the juxtamembrane region and repeat 1 in the extracellular domain. Both exon 4 and exon 5 encode 46 amino acids, corresponding to all of repeat 2 (exon 4) and repeat 3 (exon 5). Exons 6–8 encode 131 amino acids, which is mostly the lectin-like domain. Exon 8 also encodes the 3′-untranslated region. Rat genomic DNA was digested with the restriction enzymes PstI, EcoRV,EcoRI, and BamHI and hybridized at high stringency with probe 2 shown in Fig. 1 A. A single band was detected in each lane, indicating that rat LOX-1 is encoded as a single copy gene (Fig. 2). To identify the transcription start site, we first performed primer extension analysis using a 30-mer oligonucleotide P1 (complementary to nucleotides +31 to +60, relative to the ATG codon). The oligonucleotide was end-labeled with 32P, hybridized to RNA, and extended by reverse transcription. As shown in Fig.3, a single extension product of 122 bases was obtained with endothelial RNA (lane 1) but not with control yeast tRNA (lane 2). The accompanying sequence ladder revealed that the band was located 62 nucleotides upstream of the translation start site and corresponded to a guanine residue. To confirm this result, we next performed an S1 nuclease mapping assay using the same RNA and primer used for primer extension. The result from S1 nuclease mapping was in accordance with that from primer extension analysis; a protected fragment of 122 bases was observed with endothelial RNA (lane 3). Thus, the position 62 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation site was most likely a transcription start site and therefore designated as +1. Fig.4 shows the nucleotide sequence of 4.8 kilobases of the 5′-flanking region and the first exon of rat LOX-1. The promoter region contained a putative TATA box (tattta) at −30 to −25 and a CAAT box at −97 to −93. On the other hand, the promoter did not contain GC-rich regions. Computer analysis further identified several potential transcription factor binding sites; six AP-1 sites, four AP-2 motifs, one NF-κB site, and one shear stress response element (SSRE: gagacc). We examined the effects of shear stress, bacterial LPS, and TNF-α on LOX-1 gene expression. In the first experiment, confluent monolayers of ECs were exposed to steady laminar shear flow (20 dyne/cm2). Cells were harvested at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 h and assayed for LOX-1 mRNA with Northern blotting. As a control, cells were incubated without flow stimulus for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 5 (left), we detected a 2.4-kb band for LOX-1 mRNA in ECs. Incubation of ECs in a static condition for 24 h did not produce any significant changes in LOX-1 gene expression. In contrast, fluid shear stress induced a marked time-dependent increase in LOX-1 message levels. The amount of LOX-1 mRNA began to increase within 3 h of shear stress and reached a maximum (9-fold increase over basal levels) at 6 h. The mRNA level declined to a 3-fold increase over basal levels at 24 h. Next, ECs were exposed to LPS (100 ng/ml) and TNF-α (10 ng/ml). LPS induced a dramatic increase in LOX-1 gene expression. The level increased up to 21-fold at 6 h and declined to 16-fold over basal levels at 24 h (Fig. 5, middle). TNF-α, on the other hand, increased LOX-1 expression to a much lesser extent (4-fold). The level remained high, however, over 24 h (Fig. 5,right). The LPS-induced LOX-1 regulation was also examined at the protein level (Fig. 6). Western blot analysis with the rabbit antiserum against rat LOX-1 detected a band of ∼45 kDa in the extract from control ECs (lane 3). The intensity of the band increased after 12 h of LPS exposure (lane 4). Control preimmune serum detected no band (lanes 1 and 2). We also confirmed the specificity of the band by preadsorption of antibody with antigen (data not shown). To examine cell type specificity of LOX-1 gene expression, we performed Northern blot analysis with RNA from peritoneal and alveolar macrophages and cultured vascular smooth muscle cells as well as cultured ECs (Fig. 7). As expected, LOX-1 was expressed in ECs (lane 3), but not in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (lane 4). Interestingly, LOX-1 expression was abundantly expressed in peritoneal (lane 1) and alveolar (lane 2) macrophages in vivo. In the present study, we isolated and characterized the rat LOX-1 gene. The 5′-flanking region contained putative TATA and CAAT boxes and multiple cis-elements, such as NF-κB, AP-1 and AP-2 sites, and a SSRE. LOX-1 gene expression was markedly up-regulated in response to hemodynamic mechanical force, bacterial endotoxin, and cytokine, suggesting a role for LOX-1 in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. LOX-1 is a recently identified OxLDL receptor abundantly expressed in endothelial cells (14Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). It is a type II single-transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic N terminus. It was first isolated in bovine and human, and subsequently our group identified the rat counterpart (16Nagase M. Hirose S. Fujita T. Biochem.

The protein does not appear to couple to G protein, and does not possess definite kinase or cyclase domains or serine, threonine, or tyrosine phosphorylation sites. The functions of this receptor, including the signaling pathways, are yet to be elucidated. In the present study, we determined the genomic structure of the rat LOX-1 gene. The LOX-1 gene consists of 8 exons, and each exon roughly corresponds to the functional domain of the protein: exon 2 to the transmembrane domain and exons 6 through 8 to the lectin-like domain. We reported previously that a 46-amino acid motif in the extracellular domain of the bovine and human LOX-1 was triplicated in the rat LOX-1 (16Nagase M. Hirose S. Fujita T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1417-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Repeats 2 and 3 correspond to all of exons 4 and 5, respectively. The exon organization supports the structural basis of this motif as a functional unit. The repeat structure was also reported in the extracellular domain of the LDL receptor (21Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Yamamoto T. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1984; 37: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Deletion and mutation analyses of this unit are necessary to elucidate the structure-function relationship. In this study, we determined a major transcription start site of the rat LOX-1 gene in ECs. Primer extension and S1 mapping analyses of RNA isolated from rat ECs clearly demonstrated that transcription began 62 bp upstream from the start of translation. The start site was 25 bp downstream of the TATA-like box and 93 bp downstream of the CAAT-like box. On the other hand, there was no GC box. Other start sites might exist in aorta, because one of the cDNA clones we isolated from a rat aortic cDNA library (RL9) had longer 5′-untranslated region (16Nagase M. Hirose S. Fujita T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1417-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, reverse transcription-PCR with multiple primer sets suggests that most transcripts were initiated from the site we identified in this study, at least in cultured ECs (data not shown). Sequencing of genomic clones encoding up to 4.8 kb of the promoter region of the rat LOX-1 gene revealed the presence of several potential cis-elements, such as NF-κB, AP-1 and AP-2 sites, and a SSRE. Although further studies are necessary to determine whether these elements are functional or not, the promoter structure suggests several transcriptional regulation of LOX-1 gene. First, the presence of the NF-κB site suggests its regulation by LPS and cytokines (22McDonald P.P. Bald A. Cassatella M.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3421-3433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the presence of AP-1 and NF-κB binding sites as well as SSRE suggests the regulation by shear stress. The SSRE was the first identified cis-element responsible for the activation of PDGF-B gene by shear stress (23Resnick N. Collins T. Atkinson W. Bonthron D.T. Dewey Jr., C. Gimbrone Jr., M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4591-4595Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), which was subsequently found in other shear-inducible genes. Transcription factors AP-1, NF-κB, Sp1, and Egr-1 have also been shown to be involved in the shear-induced up-regulation (24Shyy J.Y. Lin M.C. Han J. Lu Y. Petrime M. Chien S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8069-8073Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 25Khachigian L.M. Resnick N. Gimbrone Jr., M. Collins T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 26Lin M.C. Almus-Jacobs F. Chen H.H. Parry G.C. Mackman N. Shyy J.Y. Chien S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 27Khachigian L.M. Anderson K.R. Halnon N.J. Gimbrone Jr., M. Resnick N. Collins T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2280-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Indeed, LOX-1 expression was markedly up-regulated by these stimuli. We reported previously that the rat LOX-1 cDNA contained multiple A+U-rich elements in the 3′-untranslated region that may be involved in the rapid degradation of mRNA (16Nagase M. Hirose S. Fujita T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1417-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, we found that, in the presence of actinomycin D, neither LPS nor shear stress altered the half-life of LOX-1 mRNA (data not shown). Thus, it is likely that the up-regulation of LOX-1 mRNA in response to stimuli such as LPS and shear stress was caused by enhanced transcription, not by stabilization of LOX-1 mRNA. The biologic role of LOX-1 has not been determined yet. It may be involved in atherosclerosis, via the actions of OxLDL in the endothelium, such as induction of adhesion molecules (6Khan B.V. Parthasarathy S.S. Alexander R.W. Medford R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 7Kume N. Cybulsky M.I. Gimbrone J.M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1138-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) and growth factors (10Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9910) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of LOX-1 by the stimuli such as LPS, TNF-α, and shear stress appears to be quite reasonable in this context. Unexpectedly, LOX-1 was expressed not only in the endothelium but also in macrophages in vivo. LOX-1 mRNA was previously demonstrated to be expressed in highly vascularized organs such as the placenta, lung, kidney, and vasculatures (14Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar, 16Nagase M. Hirose S. Fujita T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1417-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the expression was very low in the brain, heart, adrenal, and other organs. It suggests that LOX-1 is specifically expressed in ECs and macrophages, which play important roles in the atherosclerotic lesion formation. Of interest, the expression of scavenger receptor (SR-AI), another OxLDL receptor abundantly expressed in macrophages, was reported to be down-regulated by LPS and TNF-α (28van Lenten B.J. Fogelman A.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 112-116PubMed Google Scholar). It is in contrast to the up-regulation of LOX-1 by these stimuli. Recently, CD36, another receptor for OxLDL, was found to be involved in atherosclerosis through PPARγ (29Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J.G. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar, 30Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Adachi et al. (31Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31217-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) identified a new type of endothelial scavenger receptor (SREC). Like other scavenger receptors, it binds acetylated LDL with high affinity, which was partially displaced by OxLDL. Thus, it can be speculated that OxLDL and its receptors on ECs and macrophages constitute a complex network, which interactively leads to the atherosclerotic vascular lesion development. We reported previously that LOX-1 gene expression is markedly enhanced in the aorta of hypertensive rats, stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats, and salt-loaded Dahl salt-sensitive rats, as compared with the low level in control rats (15Nagase M. Hirose S. Sawamura T. Masaki T. Fujita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 496-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This finding implicates a role for LOX-1 in the pathophysiology of hypertension. On the other hand, LOX-1 expression is not enhanced in prehypertensive young stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats and salt-unloaded Dahl salt-sensitive rats (16Nagase M. Hirose S. Fujita T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1417-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, the up-regulation might be induced by hemodynamic, humoral, or other factors related to the hypertensive state. The present study demonstrated that, in vitro, LOX-1 expression was markedly increased by mechanical factor. Hence, it is possible that the mechanical factor has a strong influence on LOX-1 expression in hypertensive rats. Alternatively, enhanced LOX-1 expression might reflect the hypertensive vascular remodeling. In conclusion, we determined the genomic structure of the rat LOX-1 gene. The up-regulation of LOX-1 gene expression by biomechanical stress and cytokines, as well as the presence of NF-κB, AP-1 and AP-2 sites, and SSRE suggest a role for LOX-1 in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis.

Here we used murine FT210 cells, which contain temperature-sensitive Cdc2 mutations, to determine if UCN-01 abrogates G2 arrest through a Cdc2-dependent pathway. We report that UCN-01 cannot induce mitosis in DNA-damaged FT210 cells at the non-permissive temperature for Cdc2 function. Failure to abrogate G2 arrest was not due to UCN-01-inactivation at the elevated temperature because parental FM3A cells, which have wild-type Cdc2, were sensitive to UCN-01-induced G2 checkpoint abrogation. Having established that UCN-01 acted through Cdc2, we next assessed UCN-01's effect on the Cdc2-inhibitory kinase, Wee1Hu, and the Cdc2-activating phosphatase, Cdc25C. We found that Wee1Hu was indeed inactivated in UCN-01-treated cells, possibly just prior to Cdc2 activation and entry of DNA-damaged cells into mitosis. This inhibition appeared, however, to be a consequence of a further upstream action since in vitro studies revealed purified Wee1Hu was relatively resistant to UCN-01-inhibition. Consistent with such an upstream action, UCN-01 also promoted the hyperphosphorylation (activation) of Cdc25C in DNA-damaged cells. Our results suggest that UCN-01 abrogates G2 checkpoint function through inhibition of a kinase residing upstream of Cdc2, Wee1Hu, and Cdc25C, and that changes observed in these mitotic regulators are downstream consequences of UCN-01's actions.

UCN-01 (7-hydroxystaurosporine) is presently being evaluated in phase I clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. UCN-01 has antiproliferative activity both in vitro and in vivo and has been shown to induce apoptosis in some cancer cell systems (1Akinaga S. Gomi K. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Okabe M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4888-4892PubMed Google Scholar, 2Akinaga S. Nomura K. Gomi K. Okabe M. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1993; 32: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 3Akinaga S.

Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 927-936PubMed Google Scholar). UCN-01 has also been found to potentiate the antiproliferative activity of ionizing radiation and some chemotherapeutic DNA-damaging agents in both in vitro andin vivo preclinical model systems (2Akinaga S. Nomura K. Gomi K. Okabe M. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1993; 32: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 5Wang Q. Fan S. Eastman A. Worland P.J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. J. Natl.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4029-4035PubMed Google Scholar), and such findings have suggested the potential use of UCN-01 in combination strategies for cancer treatment (8O'Connor P.M. Cancer Surv. 1997; 29: 151-182PubMed Google Scholar).A potential mechanism by which UCN-01 might enhance the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents was afforded by our previous findings that UCN-01 abrogated cell cycle arrest following DNA damage (5Wang Q. Fan S. Eastman A. Worland P.J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 956-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). This was most likely due to the disruption of cell cycle checkpoint function. Additionally, evidence has been presented for a tendency of UCN-01 to preferentially abrogate DNA damage-induced G2 arrest in p53-disrupted cells, at least those cells created through stable overexpression of the human papillomavirus E6 protein (5Wang Q. Fan S. Eastman A. Worland P.J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 956-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). These findings were similar to results with another clinically utilized agent, pentoxifylline (9Fan S. Smith M.L. Rivet D.J.N. Duba D. Zhan Q. Kohn K.W. Fornace Jr., A.J. O'Connor P.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1649-1654PubMed Google Scholar). To date, UCN-01 has been shown to abrogate cell cycle arrest induced by ionizing radiation (5Wang Q. Fan S. Eastman A. Worland P.J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 956-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), cisplatin (10Demarcq C. Bunch R.T. Creswell D. Eastman A.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4029-4035PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting these diverse DNA-damaging agents activate a common (UCN-01-sensitive) signaling mechanism that induces cell cycle arrest. All three of these DNA-damaging agents induce G2 phase arrest and these agents can also slow progression across S phase (7Shao R.G. Cao C.X. Shimizu T. O'Connor P.M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4029-4035PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sorenson C.M. Barry M.A. Eastman A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 12Lee H. Larner J.M.

Cdc2 must also be phosphorylated on a threonine residue for kinase activity (threonine 161) (13Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar). Cdc2 is kept inactive until the completion of DNA replication by the imposition of inhibitory phosphorylations on the Cdc2 kinase (threonine 14 and tyrosine 15), and these inhibitory phosphorylations are maintained in cells arrested in G2 phase following DNA damage (14O'Connor P.M.

Another Cdc2-inhibitory kinase (Myt1) exists in mammalian cells, and this kinase can phosphorylate Cdc2 on threonine 14 and tyrosine 15 residues (28Liu F. Stanton J.J. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol.

Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1817-1822PubMed Google Scholar), and in some instances basal levels of cyclin B1 have been shown to decrease following DNA damage (40Maity A. McKenna W.G. Muschel R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 41Kao G.D. McKenna W.G. Maity A. Blank K. Muschel R.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 753-758PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that UCN-01 blocks the accumulation of the Cdc2-inhibitory phosphorylations and prematurely activates Cdc2 in DNA-damaged cells (5Wang Q. Fan S. Eastman A. Worland P.J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 956-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). These previous studies suggested that UCN-01 mediated its cell cycle actions through Cdc2 to overcome the G2 arrest induced by the DNA damage checkpoint. However, definitive proof of this was not possible in our previous studies. Indeed, a complication to this straightforward notion is the findings that the phosphatase inhibitor, fostriecin, can induce a mitotic state in cells with impaired Cdc2 function (42Guo X.W. Th'ng J.P. Swank R.A. Anderson H.J. Tudan C. Bradbury E.M. Roberge M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of the Aspergillus nidulans NIMA kinase in mammalian cells can induce mitosis even in the presence of chemical inhibitors of the Cdc2 kinase (17Lock R.B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1817-1822PubMed Google Scholar, 43O'Connell M.J. Norbury C. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4926-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 44Lu K.P. Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 81: 413-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies have raised the possibility that UCN-01 might also act through a Cdc2-independent pathway to induce mitosis in DNA-damaged cells.We investigated whether UCN-01 acts through a Cdc2-dependent or Cdc2-independent pathway to abrogate DNA damage-induced G2 arrest. We used the murine FT210 and FM3A cell lines for this purpose. The FT210 cell line was derived from FM3A cells by mutagenesis (45Mineo C. Murakami Y. Ishimi Y. Hanaoka F. Yamada M. Exp. Cell. Res. 1986; 167: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and contains temperature-sensitive mutations in the Cdc2 gene that render this protein thermolabile (46Th'ng J.P. Wright P.S. Hamaguchi J. Lee M.G. Norbury C.J. Nurse P. Bradbury E.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 313-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We also explored the action of UCN-01 on the Cdc2-inhibitory kinase, Wee1Hu, and the Cdc2-activating phosphatase, Cdc25C, to determine whether these Cdc2 regulators were implicated in UCN-01's action on G2 checkpoint control.We found that, in contrast to fostriecin, UCN-01 did not induce mitotic entry in DNA-damaged FT210 cells in the absence of Cdc2 function. We additionally report that the Cdc2-inhibitory kinase, Wee1Hu, was inactivated in UCN-01-treated cells possibly just prior to Cdc2 activation and entry of DNA-damaged cells into mitosis. Wee1Hu inactivation was, however, not a direct effect of UCN-01, since the purified Wee1Hu kinase was relatively resistant to inhibition by UCN-01. In addition, Cdc25C became hyperphosphorylated in UCN-01-treated cells, and this change correlated with G2checkpoint abrogation. Taken together, our results suggest that UCN-01 abrogates G2 checkpoint function through inhibition of a kinase residing upstream of Cdc2, Wee1Hu, and Cdc25C, and that changes observed in these mitotic regulators are downstream consequences of UCN-01's actions.DISCUSSIONIn the present report, we show that UCN-01, an agent currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, requires the function of the Cdc2 gene product to abrogate G2 arrest induced by DNA damage. This was in contrast to the phosphatase inhibitor fostriecin, which, in accord with previous studies (42Guo X.W. Th'ng J.P. Swank R.A. Anderson H.J. Tudan C. Bradbury E.M. Roberge M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), could induce mitosis in the near complete absence of the Cdc2 protein.We also report that UCN-01-induced G2 checkpoint abrogation is associated with the inactivation of the Wee1Hu kinase just prior to, or at least at the same time as, Cdc2 is activated and the DNA-damaged cells enter mitosis. The inactivation of the Wee1Hu kinase is, however, unlikely to be a direct action of UCN-01, since the purified Wee1Hu kinase was relatively resistant to inhibition by UCN-01. Consistent with the possibility that UCN-01 inhibits a kinase that functions upstream of Wee1Hu in the G2 checkpoint pathway, we found that UCN-01 also promoted the phosphorylation/activation of the Cdc25C phosphatase in DNA-damaged cells.The finding that UCN-01 could abrogate cell cycle arrest induced by a variety of DNA-damaging agents (5Wang Q. Fan S. Eastman A. Worland P.J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 956-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) has stimulated much interest in mapping the pathway, and eventually uncovering the target, through which this response is mediated. We have previously shown that UCN-01-induced G2 checkpoint abrogation is associated with the dephosphorylation and activation of the Cdc2/cyclin B1 complex and that activation of this kinase coincides with the entry of DNA-damaged cells into mitosis (5Wang Q. Fan S. Eastman A. Worland P.J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 956-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). We, however, recently questioned whether there was an absolute requirement for Cdc2 activity in the mechanism through which UCN-01 promotes mitotic entry because Roberge and colleagues (42Guo X.W. Th'ng J.P. Swank R.A. Anderson H.J. Tudan C. Bradbury E.M. Roberge M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) showed that another G2 checkpoint abrogator, fostriecin, which is a potent inhibitor of type 1/2a phosphatases (47Roberge M. Tudan C. Hung S.M. Harder K.W. Jirik F.R. Anderson H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6115-6121PubMed Google Scholar), could induce mitosis in the near complete absence of Cdc2 function (42Guo X.W. Th'ng J.P. Swank R.A. Anderson H.J. Tudan C. Bradbury E.M. Roberge M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To perform these earlier studies, Roberge and colleagues utilized FT210 cells, which contain temperature-sensitive Cdc2 genes that render the Cdc2 protein thermolabile (46Th'ng J.P. Wright P.S. Hamaguchi J. Lee M.G. Norbury C.J. Nurse P. Bradbury E.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 313-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Since these cells had been extensively characterized for this Cdc2 defect and since Roberge and colleagues had successfully utilized this system to assay the effects of fostriecin, we employed the FT210 cell line to assay the importance of Cdc2 function in UCN-01-induced G2 checkpoint abrogation.Our results contrasted with those obtained for fostriecin, which in accord with previous studies (42Guo X.W. Th'ng J.P. Swank R.A. Anderson H.J. Tudan C. Bradbury E.M. Roberge M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), could induce mitosis in the near complete absence of the Cdc2 protein. UCN-01 contrasted with fostriecin in several other ways as well, including the fact that UCN-01 required on-going protein synthesis to induce mitosis in DNA-damaged cells but fostriecin did not (Figs. 1 B and 2 A). Furthermore, the activity of Cdc2 kinase was stable in mitotic arrested cells incubated with UCN-01. In contrast, Cdc2 activation was transient in fostriecin-treated cells and, once cells had entered mitosis, fostriecin promoted the destruction of cyclin B1 (Figs. 1 Cand 2 B).Having determined a requirement for Cdc2 function in the mechanism by which UCN-01 induces mitosis in DNA-damaged cells, we next set out to determine whether the Cdc2-inhibitory kinase, Wee1Hu, could be the target of UCN-01 in the G2 checkpoint. We initially assessed the response of Wee1Hu protein levels and kinase activity in cells that had received DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation. We found that Wee1Hu was not induced by DNA damage either at the protein level or at the kinase activity level. We concluded from these studies that Wee1Hu was not a DNA damage-inducible kinase. When UCN-01 was added to cells following DNA damage, we found that the Wee1Hu kinase was rapidly inactivated. This rapid inactivation occurred just prior to, or at least at the same time as, the activation of Cdc2 and entry of DNA-damaged cells into mitosis. Arresting mitotic cells with the microtubule inhibitor, nocodazole, enabled us to show that Wee1Hu protein levels were decreased after the Wee1Hu kinase had been inactivated by UCN-01. We suggest that the loss of the Wee1Hu protein in mitotic cells is probably a consequence of the combined effect of transcriptional down-regulation of the Wee1Hu gene due to chromosome condensation at mitosis and the relatively short half-life of the Wee1Hu protein (half-life of approximately 4 h; Fig.5 C). Wee1Hu was not, however, the direct target of UCN-01 or the structurally related kinase inhibitor, staurosporine, since neither of these kinase inhibitors were effective at inhibiting Wee1Hu kinase activity at doses up to 300-fold in excess of that required for checkpoint abrogation (Fig.6 C). As this activation must be indirect, we propose a model where UCN-01 acts through a target kinase that functions upstream of Wee1Hu and Cdc25C in the checkpoint pathway that regulates mitotic entry following DNA damage. Consistent with this possibility, we found that UCN-01 promoted the hyperphosphorylation of Cdc25C in DNA-damaged cells, an event that has previously been associated with the activation of Cdc25C phosphatase activity (16O'Connor P.M.

Commun. 1994; 199: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).In yeast, it has recently been found that the checkpoint kinase, chk1, phosphorylates wee1 (52O'Connell M.J. Raleigh J.M. Verkade H.M. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 53Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar, 54Nurse P. Cell. 1997; 91: 865-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation event does not alter wee1 kinase activity (52O'Connell M.J. Raleigh J.M. Verkade H.M. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), but it has been speculated that this phosphorylation could enable the binding of 14-3-3 proteins to wee1, which in turn might aid the function of wee1 (52O'Connell M.J. Raleigh J.M. Verkade H.M. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). This possibility has yet to be proven. Interestingly, two 14-3-3 genes in fission yeast (rad24, rad25) have been identified as components of the G2checkpoint pathway, and yeast defective for these 14-3-3 proteins have, like wee1-defective yeast, compromised checkpoint control (55Ford J.C. al-Khodairy F. Fotou E. Sheldrick K.S. Griffiths D.J. Carr A.M. Science. 1994; 265: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Furthermore, yeast lacking chk1 are, like UCN-01-treated mammalian cells, both hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agents and unable to arrest cell cycle progression following DNA damage (56Walworth N. Davey S. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 363: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 57Walworth N.C. Bernards R. Science. 1996; 271: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 58Furnari B. Rhind N. Russell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). A human homologue of the yeast chk1 has recently been cloned (59Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica- Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 60Flaggs G. Plug A.W. Dunks K.M. Mundt K.E. Ford J.C. Quiggle M.R. Taylor E.M. Westphal C.H. Ashley T. Hoekstra M.F. Carr A.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 977-986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and this kinase has been shown to phosphorylate Cdc25C and confer upon Cdc25C the ability to interact with 14–3-3 proteins (59Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica- Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 61Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30461-30469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction is believed to hinder the cellular function of Cdc25C. When taken together, the findings in the present study and those recently published suggest chk1 could be an upstream target through which UCN-01 abrogates G2 arrest following DNA damage. It will be important in our future studies to determine whether UCN-01 inhibits the Chk1 kinase. An alternative point of action of UCN-01 might be the Myt1 kinase. This kinase phosphorylates Cdc2 on T14 and Y15 (28Liu F. Stanton J.J. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 29Booher R.N. Holman P.S.

Science. 1995; 270: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) and both of these phosphorylations are inhibited by treating cells with UCN-01 (Fig. 2 B). In our future studies, it will be important to also investigate the actions of UCN-01 on Myt1.In summary, we show that the cell cycle checkpoint abrogator, UCN-01, requires the function of the Cdc2 gene product to abrogate G2 arrest induced by DNA damage. This contrasts with fostriecin, which is able to induce mitosis in the near complete absence of the Cdc2 protein. We show that UCN-01 promotes the inactivation of the Wee1Hu kinase just prior to, or at least at the same time as, Cdc2 is activated and the DNA-damaged cells enter mitosis. However, Wee1Hu kinase inhibition appears to be an indirect action of UCN-01. UCN-01 could inhibit a kinase that functions upstream of Wee1Hu in the G2 checkpoint pathway, and, consistent with this possibility, we found that UCN-01 promoted Cdc25C hyperphosphorylation in DNA-damaged cells. These studies provide platform observations upon which to pursue the target of UCN-01's actions in the G2 checkpoint of mammalian cells. UCN-01 (7-hydroxystaurosporine) is presently being evaluated in phase I clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. UCN-01 has antiproliferative activity both in vitro and in vivo and has been shown to induce apoptosis in some cancer cell systems (1Akinaga S. Gomi K. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Okabe M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4888-4892PubMed Google Scholar, 2Akinaga S. Nomura K. Gomi K. Okabe M. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1993; 32: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 3Akinaga S.

Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 927-936PubMed Google Scholar). UCN-01 has also been found to potentiate the antiproliferative activity of ionizing radiation and some chemotherapeutic DNA-damaging agents in both in vitro andin vivo preclinical model systems (2Akinaga S. Nomura K. Gomi K. Okabe M. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1993; 32: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 5Wang Q. Fan S. Eastman A. Worland P.J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. J. Natl.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4029-4035PubMed Google Scholar), and such findings have suggested the potential use of UCN-01 in combination strategies for cancer treatment (8O'Connor P.M. Cancer Surv. 1997; 29: 151-182PubMed Google Scholar). A potential mechanism by which UCN-01 might enhance the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents was afforded by our previous findings that UCN-01 abrogated cell cycle arrest following DNA damage (5Wang Q. Fan S. Eastman A. Worland P.J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 956-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). This was most likely due to the disruption of cell cycle checkpoint function. Additionally, evidence has been presented for a tendency of UCN-01 to preferentially abrogate DNA damage-induced G2 arrest in p53-disrupted cells, at least those cells created through stable overexpression of the human papillomavirus E6 protein (5Wang Q. Fan S. Eastman A. Worland P.J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 956-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). These findings were similar to results with another clinically utilized agent, pentoxifylline (9Fan S. Smith M.L. Rivet D.J.N. Duba D. Zhan Q. Kohn K.W. Fornace Jr., A.J. O'Connor P.M.

The product of a recently described gene, egl-1, binds to and inhibits CED-9. In the present studies, we have addressed the molecular mechanism by which EGL-1 regulates CED-9 function and promotes cell death. Expression of CED-4 and CED-3 resulted in decreased survival and apoptosis of mammalian cells, activities that could be inhibited by CED-9. Importantly, this protective effect of CED-9 was antagonized by EGL-1. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that EGL-1 binding to CED-9 disrupts the association between CED-4 and CED-9, an activity that required the BH3 motif of EGL-1. Consistent with these results, expression of EGL-1 promoted CED-4-dependent processing of CED-3, and this activity of EGL-1 was mediated through inhibition of CED-9. In mammalian cells, CED-9 is known to target the subcellular localization of CED-4 from the cytosol to intracellular membranes. Expression of EGL-1 resulted in redistribution of CED-4 from intracellular membranes, where it co-localized with CED-9, to the cytoplasm, providing further evidence that EGL-1 regulates CED-4 through CED-9. Finally, the levels of EGL-1 were greatly enhanced by co-expression of CED-9 in both mammalian cells and in a cell-free system, suggesting a role for CED-9 in the expression and/or stabilization of EGL-1. These studies provide a mechanism for how EGL-1 functions to antagonize pro-survival of CED-9 and to promote CED-3 activation and programmed cell death.

Genetic analyses of the cell death process in the nematode have identified three genes that play critical roles in the induction and execution of PCD (4Horvitz H.R. Shaham S. Hengartner M.O.

Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 665-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Two nematode genes, ced-3 and ced-4, are required for the execution of the cell death process (4Horvitz H.R. Shaham S. Hengartner M.O. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). CED-3 is homologous to the mammalian interleukin-1β-converting enzyme, which is a member of a family of cysteine proteases (designated caspases) (7Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). CED-3 and related caspases are thought to act as executioners of the nematode and mammalian PCD pathway (8Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4104) Google Scholar). CED-4 also has a mammalian counterpart, Apaf-1 (9Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ced-4 in nematode ALM neurons causes cell death that requires ced-3 activity for efficient killing, suggesting that ced-4 acts upstream ofced-3 (10Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 578-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).Biochemical analyses of CED-3, CED-4, and CED-9 have provided important insight into the regulation of the central cell death machinery in the nematode. CED-9 interacts with CED-4 suggesting that CED-9 regulates cell death by binding to and inactivating CED-4 (11Wu D. Wallen H. Nuñez G.

Furthermore, CED-4 associates with CED-3 and promotes the proteolytic activation of CED-3, and this activation process is inhibited by CED-9 through a multimeric protein complex (13Chinnaiyan A.M.

Recent analyses inC. elegans have identified EGL-1, a nematode counterpart of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Gain-of-function mutations ofegl-1 caused hermaphrodite-specific neurons to undergo PCD, whereas a loss-of-function egl-1 mutation prevented most, if not all, somatic cell deaths in the worm (33Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Marcellus R.C. Branton P.E. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Genetic analyses revealed that egl-1 acts upstream of or in parallel toced-4 and ced-3 and requires ced-9 to exert its effect on PCD (33Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Marcellus R.C. Branton P.E. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed that EGL-1 is a BH3-containing protein most homologous to mammalian Bad, Bik/Nbk, Bid, and Hrk/DP5 (33Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Marcellus R.C. Branton P.E. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). EGL-1 physically associates with CED-9, as determined by in vitro interaction analysis, and requires its BH3 domain for efficient binding to CED-9 (33Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Marcellus R.C. Branton P.E. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), suggesting that EGL-1 might act by binding to and inhibiting CED-9. However, the mechanism by which EGL-1 antagonizes the activity CED-9 remains unknown. In the present study, we have performed biochemical and functional analyses to assess the mechanism by which EGL-1 inhibits the activity of CED-9 and regulates CED-3 and CED-4. Programmed cell death (PCD) 1The abbreviations used are: PCD, programmed cell death; HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryo kidney; mAb, mouse monoclonal antibody; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; wt, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: PCD, programmed cell death; HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryo kidney; mAb, mouse monoclonal antibody; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; wt, wild type. is a conserved mechanism of cellular demise that is critical for embryonic organ development and homeostasis in adult tissues (1Raff M.C.

In the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans, 131 of the 1090 somatic cells generated during development undergo PCD (3Sulston J.E. Schierenberg E. White J.G. Thomson J.N. Dev. Biol. 1983; 100: 64-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2768) Google Scholar). Genetic analyses of the cell death process in the nematode have identified three genes that play critical roles in the induction and execution of PCD (4Horvitz H.R. Shaham S. Hengartner M.O. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Theced-9 gene protects cells that normally survive during worm development (5Hengartner M.O. Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). ced-9 encodes a protein with significant homology to the mammalian Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL survival proteins (6Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 665-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Two nematode genes, ced-3 and ced-4, are required for the execution of the cell death process (4Horvitz H.R. Shaham S. Hengartner M.O. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). CED-3 is homologous to the mammalian interleukin-1β-converting enzyme, which is a member of a family of cysteine proteases (designated caspases) (7Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). CED-3 and related caspases are thought to act as executioners of the nematode and mammalian PCD pathway (8Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4104) Google Scholar). CED-4 also has a mammalian counterpart, Apaf-1 (9Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ced-4 in nematode ALM neurons causes cell death that requires ced-3 activity for efficient killing, suggesting that ced-4 acts upstream ofced-3 (10Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 578-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses of CED-3, CED-4, and CED-9 have provided important insight into the regulation of the central cell death machinery in the nematode. CED-9 interacts with CED-4 suggesting that CED-9 regulates cell death by binding to and inactivating CED-4 (11Wu D. Wallen H. Nuñez G.

Furthermore, CED-4 associates with CED-3 and promotes the proteolytic activation of CED-3, and this activation process is inhibited by CED-9 through a multimeric protein complex (13Chinnaiyan A.M.

https://openalex.org/W1972275692,"Protein-protein interactions play significant roles in the control of gene expression. These interactions often occur between small, discrete domains within different transcription factors. In particular, zinc fingers, usually regarded as DNA-binding domains, are now also known to be involved in mediating contacts between proteins. We have investigated the interaction between the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 and its partner, the 9 zinc finger protein, FOG (Friend Of GATA). We demonstrate that this interaction represents a genuine finger-finger contact, which is dependent on zinc-coordinating residues within each protein. We map the contact domains to the core of the N-terminal zinc finger of GATA-1 and the 6th zinc finger of FOG. Using a scanning substitution strategy we identify key residues within the GATA-1 N-finger which are required for FOG binding. These residues are conserved in the N-fingers of all GATA proteins known to bind FOG, but are not found in the respective C-fingers. This observation may, therefore, account for the particular specificity of FOG for N-fingers. Interestingly, the key N-finger residues are seen to form a contiguous surface, when mapped onto the structure of the N-finger of GATA-1.

Using a scanning substitution strategy we identify key residues within the GATA-1 N-finger which are required for FOG binding. These residues are conserved in the N-fingers of all GATA proteins known to bind FOG, but are not found in the respective C-fingers. This observation may, therefore, account for the particular specificity of FOG for N-fingers. Interestingly, the key N-finger residues are seen to form a contiguous surface, when mapped onto the structure of the N-finger of GATA-1. Individual eukaryotic transcription factors rarely work alone to activate gene expression. Diverse collections of proteins are typically found assembled at promoters and enhancers, where they are thought to act by recruiting the basal transcriptional machinery and/or by influencing chromatin structure (for review, see Refs. 1Felsenfeld G.

Pruss D. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Many different types of protein-protein interactions are required for the coordinated formation of an active transcription complex. These interactions can be grouped into 4 main classes: homotypic interactions, such as the dimerization of leucine zippers; short-range interactions, involved in the cooperative binding of factors at adjacent DNA elements; local interactions between DNA-bound proteins and their ancillary factors, such as coactivators or corepressors; and long range interactions between factors bound at widely spaced control elements, which may mediate DNA looping. Although much is now known about transcription factor dimerization and the way in which proteins contact DNA, much less is known about the molecular interactions made between different transcription factors. It is now apparent that some of the well defined structures known to be involved in protein-DNA interactions are also involved in mediating contacts between different proteins. In particular, there are now several examples of zinc finger domains which are involved in protein-protein interactions (4Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In some cases, such as GATA fingers (see below), these domains are thought to make both protein-protein (5Crossley M.

Science. 1993; 261: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), whereas in other cases, such as the C-terminal fingers of the Ikaros family proteins, the zinc fingers appear to be exclusively dedicated to protein-protein contacts (11Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar).

GATA family transcription factors typically bind to (A/T)GATA(A/G) motifs in DNA and contain one or two Cys-X 2-Cys-X 17-Cys-X 2-Cys zinc fingers. The founding member of the family, the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1, is thought to be involved in the expression of most, if not all, genes transcribed specifically in red blood cells (for review, see Refs. 14Orkin S.H.

Recently, it has been suggested that GATA factors act in conjunction with partner proteins of the FOG family. FOG is a zinc finger protein, which was originally isolated in a screen for proteins that could interact with the zinc finger domain of GATA-1 (7Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). A second member of the FOG family, U-shaped (33Haenlin M. Cubadda Y. Blondeau F. Heitzler P. Lutz Y. Simpson P. Ramain P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3096-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 34Cubadda Y. Heitzler P. Ray R.P. Bourouis M. Ramain P. Gelbart W. Simpson P. Haenlin M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3083-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), was subsequently identified as a partner of the Drosophila GATA factor, Pannier. Both FOG and U-shaped contain 9 putative zinc fingers, 4 of which appear to be classical (TFIIIA-like) CCHH fingers and 5 of which are variant CCHC fingers. FOG is believed to work in concert with DNA-bound GATA-1 to activate gene expression (7Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), whereas U-shaped appears to counter the action of Pannier. Knockout experiments in mice have recently confirmed the essential role of FOG in hematopoiesis (35Tsang A.P. Fujiwara Y. Hom D.B. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1176-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and studies of mutations in Drosophila attest to the importance of the interaction between U-shaped and Pannier in proneural gene expression and bristle cell formation (34Cubadda Y. Heitzler P. Ray R.P. Bourouis M. Ramain P. Gelbart W. Simpson P. Haenlin M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3083-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We have studied the molecular contacts made between murine GATA-1 and FOG in order to gain insights into the general mechanisms by which the two families of transcription factors interact to regulate gene expression. We confirm that one key region of FOG, finger 6, is a true zinc-binding domain and have investigated its interaction with the N-finger of GATA-1. We show that association is reliant on intact zinc-coordinating residues in both GATA-1 and FOG and that the interacting regions map precisely to zinc-binding subdomains within the two proteins. Noting that FOG recognizes the N-finger but not the highly related C-finger of GATA-1, we have explored the basis for this specificity by utilizing a panel of N/C microchimera mutants. This mutagenic analysis identifies key residues within the GATA-1 N-finger that are required for contact with FOG. These residues are conserved within the N-fingers, but not the C-fingers, of all GATA family proteins known to bind FOG. These results confirm the GATA-FOG interaction as an unequivocal finger-finger interaction and have implications for the mechanisms by which these two proteins cooperate to activate gene expression. FOG-finger 6 (residues 694–723) was obtained as a crude product from a solid-phase synthesis carried out by Chiron Mimotopes (Clayton, Victoria, Australia), and was purified using reversed phase HPLC (rpHPLC) 1The abbreviations used are: rpHPLC, reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; GST, glutathioneS-transferase. on a Vydac analytical C18 column (5 μm), employing linear water/acetonitrile gradients. The identity of the purified peptide was established using positive-ion electrospray mass spectrometry (M exp = 3687.8 Da, M obs = 3687 Da), and taken together, the electrospray mass spectrometry and rpHPLC data indicate that the peptide was >95% pure. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter using a 1-mm quartz cuvette. FOG-finger 6 (25 μm) was dissolved in a buffer containing Tris (10 mm) and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, 250 μm) at pH 8.0. ZnCl2 was made up in water at a concentration of 20 mm. CD spectra (190–260 nm) were recorded following the addition of successive 5-μm aliquots of Zn2+. The final spectrum in each case is the sum of five separate spectra with a step size of 0.5 nm, a 1-s response time, a 20-nm min−1 scan rate, and a 1-nm bandwidth. Data were acquired at 20 °C and were baseline corrected by subtraction of the Tris/TCEP buffer. FOG-finger 6 was prepared as for CD spectropolarimetry, and Co2+ was made up as a 20 mm solution of CoCl2 in water. UV and VIS absorption spectra (250–500 and 500–800 nm, respectively) were recorded on a Cary 3 double-beam spectrophotometer using 1-cm matched quartz cuvettes. Co2+ was titrated into both the sample cell and the reference cell (the latter containing the Tris/TCEP buffer only) in 5 μm aliquots. Data were recorded at a speed of 100 nm min−1 with a signal averaging time of 0.1 s. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using either overlap polymerase chain reaction or single primer mismatch polymerase chain reaction with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and mutant oligonucleotide primers (Life Technologies, Inc.). Details of oligonucleotides and plasmids are available on request. In vivo interactions between GATA-1 and FOG were analyzed using a yeast two-hybrid system (CLONTECH). GATA-1 truncations and mutants were cloned in-frame into the Gal4 DNA-binding domain encoding plasmid, pGBT9. The Gal4 activation domain encoding plasmid, pGAD10, was used as the cloning vector for in-frame FOG constructs, both truncations and mutants. Competent HF7c yeast cells were transformed simultaneously with both the appropriate pGBT9 and pGAD10 constructs (CLONTECH Two-hybrid Matchmaker system protocol) and the transformants selected on Leu− Trp−minimal media plates by growth at 29 °C for 3 days. Transformants were then patched onto His− Leu−Trp− plates and monitored for growth for up to 3 days. Western blotting was employed to confirm the expression of GATA and FOG Gal4 fusion proteins that gave negative results in the two-hybrid assay. Yeast protein extractions (CLONTECH Yeast protocol manual) were performed on overnight cultures of HF7c containing the appropriate construct and run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After overnight blotting onto nitrocellulose, Western analysis was performed with antibodies to either the Gal4 activation domain (FOG-GAD10 constructs) or the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (GATA-GBT9 constructs), according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). Secondary antibody was detected using an ECL kit (Amersham). The N-finger (residues 200–254, 200–248, 200–243, 200–239, 200–235, 200–231, and 200–227), C-finger (residues 249–318), and mutants of the N-finger of GATA-1 (residues 200–248) were generated by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned in-frame into the expression vector pGEX2T. The expression of both GST fusion proteins and GST alone was performed using Escherichia coli strain DH5α and purification was carried out as described previously (36Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled FOG (residues 279–760) (7Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) was prepared by in vitrotranscription/translation using the TNT system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). In vitro binding assays were performed in 0.3 ml of buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μm ZnSO4, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with 1 μg of fusion protein attached to glutathione beads and 3 μl of radiolabeled FOG. In all cases, levels of the various GST fusion proteins were confirmed by Coomassie staining. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and the beads were then washed repeatedly with binding buffer. Samples were boiled in loading buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was then dried and any FOG retained by the beads was detected using a PhosphorImager. 10-cm diameter plates of COS cells were transfected with 3 μg of pXMGATA-1, pXMGATA-1 ΔN-finger (37Martin D.K. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), or 3 μg of pXMGATAE203V, V205T, GA208/209QT, and HY222/223DP by the DEAE-dextran method. (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 48 h later, nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (39Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). Gel shift reactions were performed using 1 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe containing the mouse α-globin GATA site (GATCTCCGGCAACTGATAAGGATTCCCTG) as described previously (40Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). 1 μl of N6 monoclonal anti-GATA-1 antibody (Santa Cruz) was added where indicated. To study GATA-1 activity alone, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 2 μg of the GATA-dependent reporter M1αGH (37Martin D.K. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and 2 μg of transactivator plasmid, pXMGATA-1, pXMGATA-1 ΔN-finger, or pXMGATA-1 mutants using the calcium phosphate method (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To examine the synergistic activation of FOG and GATA-1 on the p45 (NF-E2) promoter, 5 μg of p45GH reporter (7Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) was transfected, along with 2 μg of PMT2FOG (7Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) and 0.5 μg of pXMGATA-1, pXMGATA-1 ΔN-finger, or pXMGATA-1 mutants. Growth hormone assays were carried out using Nichols Institute Allegro GH assay kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. All cell culture data is the result of three separate experiments and has been normalized to LacZ levels derived from a co-transfected β-galactosidase-encoding plasmid, EF1α-LacZ. The smallest FOG cDNA clone isolated in the initial two-hybrid screen against the GATA-1 N-finger (residues 200–254), contained residues 563–859, encompassing FOG-finger 6, which is known to bind GATA-1, as well as fingers 5 and 7 (7Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether fingers 5 and 7 could also bind GATA-1 and to delineate the minimal region of finger 6 required for the interaction. A series of deletion mutants were prepared and tested for their ability to interact with the GATA-1 N-finger in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Clones containing finger 6 were capable of binding GATA-1, whereas clones containing either finger 5 alone or finger 7 alone, could not (Fig. 1). Further deletions defined the minimal region required for the interaction to a 40-residue region (690–729), centered around the zinc-binding domain (Cys698 to Cys719). Note that the residues (690–697) immediately before the first cysteine of the finger appear to be necessary for the interaction. These results localize the minimal region of FOG required to bind GATA-1 to finger 6. GATA-type fingers are composed of a zinc-binding fold, followed by a basic tail region. In the case of GATA-1, the tail region of the C-finger has been shown to be important for DNA binding (10Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G. Trainor C. Appella E. Stahl S.J. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1993; 261: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) and has also been implicated in self-associations between GATA proteins (5Crossley M. Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2448-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To determine whether the tail of the N-finger is required for contact with FOG, we prepared a series of N-finger truncation mutants and tested their ability to bind FOG in the yeast two-hybrid system. As shown in Fig. 2, the entire tail region was dispensable for FOG binding. Binding was abolished only when the deletion extended from the tail into the zinc-binding region (i.e. when one of the zinc coordinating cysteines, Cys228, was deleted). GST pull-down experiments, using the same series of constructs, confirmed this result in vitro(data not shown). These findings indicate that a 32-amino acid peptide (residues 200–231) encompassing the zinc-binding region of the N-finger is sufficient for recognition by FOG. As can be seen from TableI, FOG-finger 6 appears related to classical (TFIIIA-like) zinc fingers, in that it contains the characteristic conserved hydrophobic residues and three of the four zinc chelating residues. FOG-finger 6 is unusual, however, in that it has a CCHC rather than a CCHH configuration of putative zinc-ligating residues. In order to determine whether FOG-finger 6 was a genuine metal-binding domain we carried out CD spectropolarimetry and UV/VIS spectrophotometry experiments in the presence of Zn2+ and Co2+, respectively.Table IFOG-finger 6 is related to the zinc fingers of Sp1, EKLF, and TFIIIAShaded boxes indicate conserved residues, whilst the clear box indicates the zinc-coordinating residue in FOG-finger 6 which differs from the TFIIIA consensus. Open table in a new tab Shaded boxes indicate conserved residues, whilst the clear box indicates the zinc-coordinating residue in FOG-finger 6 which differs from the TFIIIA consensus. Fig. 3 A shows far-UV CD spectra of HPLC-purified FOG-finger 6, recorded in the presence of increasing molar ratios of Zn2+. In the absence of metal, FOG-finger 6 displays a spectrum characteristic of an unfolded polypeptide, with a pronounced minimum below 200 nm. The red shift of the minimum to 208 nm and the appearance of a second minimum at 220 nm, following the addition of 1 molar equivalent of Zn2+, are indicative of the formation of secondary structure. The lack of change after the addition of more than 1 equivalent of Zn2+establishes the stoichiometry of the Zn2+·FOG-finger 6 complex as 1:1 (data not shown) and the general form of the spectrum is comparable to those previously observed in studies of CCHH classical zinc fingers (41Parraga G.

In order to probe the geometry of metal ion ligation and the identity of the metal-coordinating residues, we carried out UV/VIS spectrophotometry experiments in the presence of Co2+ (a metal which is commonly used as a spectroscopic probe for zinc-binding proteins, due to its favorable electronic properties (42Frankel A.D.

The appearance of bands at 310 and 350 nm is indicative of cysteinate ligation (42Frankel A.D. Berg J.M. Pabo C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4841-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), while the signals at 600, 650, and 720 nm show both that the metal coordination sphere is tetrahedral and that at least one nitrogen ligand is involved in the metal ligation (43Kosa J.L.

Methods Enzymol. 1993; 226: 52-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 B). Taken together, the CD and UV/VIS data suggest that the FOG finger is capable of folding around zinc, with one histidine and three cysteine residues ligating the metal. We next sought to investigate whether the integrity of the FOG zinc finger was required for its interaction with GATA-1. We prepared two FOG-finger 6 (residues 678–760) mutants in which zinc-coordinating cysteine residues were replaced by alanine, Cys698 → Ala and Cys719 → Ala, and assayed their ability to interact with GATA-1 (residues 200–254) in the yeast two-hybrid system. Neither mutant was able to interact with GATA-1 (Fig. 4). We also mutated the 4th cysteine to histidine, Cys719 → His, to mimic the CCHH configuration of a classical zinc finger. This mutant was also unable to interact with GATA-1 (Fig. 4), suggesting that the unusual CCHC configuration is critical for this protein-protein interaction. To further assess the importance of metal ions, we carried out in vitro GST pull-down experiments in the presence and absence of EDTA. A 35S-labeled in vitro-translated fragment of FOG containing finger 6 was assessed for its ability to interact with GST GATA-N-finger (residues 200–254) immobilized on agarose beads. This fragment of FOG was efficiently retained on the GATA N-finger-coated beads (Fig. 5, lane 2) but not on GST-coated beads (Fig. 5, lane 4). When the experiment was repeated in the presence of 5 mm EDTA, the FOG fragment was no longer retained (Fig. 5, lane 3). We have previously demonstrated that the GATA-1 zinc fingers bind zinc more tightly than classical fingers, and are not affected by the addition of EDTA under these conditions, 2J. P. Mackay, K. Kowalski, and M. Crossley, manuscript in preparation. and we have also carried out additional controls indicating that EDTA does not affect the binding of GST GATA-1-N-finger to glutathione-coated beads (data not shown). Consequently, this particular experiment primarily addresses the importance of metal ions to the FOG finger. We next carried out experiments to investigate whether zinc-binding by the GATA-1 N-finger (residues 200–254) was also required for the interaction. The N-finger coordinates zinc by means of four cysteines, Cys204, Cys207, Cys225, and Cys228. We prepared two cysteine to alanine substitution mutants, Cys204 → Ala and Cys228 → Ala, and tested their ability to interact with FOG-finger 6 (residues 678–760) in the yeast two-hybrid system. In each case the cysteine to alanine mutation abolished the interaction (Fig. 6 A). We confirmed this result in vitro using the GST pull-down assay. In this experiment, GST N-finger (residues 200–254) was able to efficiently sequester in vitro translated FOG (Fig.6 B, lane 2), while N-finger domains with mutations of either Cys204 or Cys228 could not (Fig. 6 B, lanes 3 and 4). In a control reaction, GST-coated beads were similarly unable to bind to FOG (Fig. 6 B, lane 5). Taken together, the results indicate that both FOG-finger 6 and the GATA N-finger must be intact for their interaction to occur; their association therefore represents a true finger-finger interaction. The N- and C-terminal zinc finger domains of murine GATA-1 share about 50% amino acid sequence identity. The existing data suggest that FOG is capable of interacting only with the N-finger (7Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H.

Homologues of vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), syntaxin, and SNAP-25 were identified in CV membranes. A VAMP and syntaxin immunoreactive band at a higher apparent molecular mass (≈70 kDa) was detected; extraction and analysis confirmed that the band contained VAMP, SNAP-25, and syntaxin.

However, disruption is not blocked by lysophosphatidylcholine, which transiently arrests a late stage of fusion. Since removal of lysophosphatidylcholine from Ca2+-treated CV is known to allow fusion, complex disruption occurs independently from the membrane fusion step. As Ca2+ disrupts rather than stabilizes the complex, the presumably coiled-coil SNARE interactions are not needed at the time of fusion.

These findings rule out models of fusion in which SNARE complex formation goes to completion (“zippers-up”) after Ca2+binding removes a “fusion-clamp.” Membrane fusion is the fundamental cellular process by which exocytotic secretion, enveloped virus entry, intracellular trafficking, and fertilization occur. Recently, conceptual advances have been made in how we think of the proteins involved in intracellular membrane trafficking and exocytosis (1Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 2Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar, 3Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar), due in part to the discovery of a series of interactions between homologous proteins known to be required for membrane trafficking in vitro, yeast secretion in vivo, and synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction. These interactions are thought to contribute to the formation of a protein complex that is postulated to mediate the targeting, docking, and subsequent fusion of membranes (2Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). Since clostridial toxins cause a block of synaptic transmission, the finding that these same toxins specifically cleave the membrane proteins of this complex (termed “SNAREs”) 1The abbreviations used are: SNAP, soluble NSF attachment protein; SNARE, SNAP receptor; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; VAMP, vesicle-associated membrane protein; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DTT, dithiothreitol; CV, cortical vesicle(s); LPC, lysophosphatidylcholine; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzensulfonyl fluoride. supports the notion that the complex formed by SNARE components is essential in the pathway of Ca2+-triggered exocytosis (4Bark I.C. Wilson M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4621-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A cytosolic protein, the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), catalyzes the ATP-dependent disassembly of SNARE complexes assembled in vitro (5Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar), suggesting that the disruption of the SNARE complex is actually causal in bilayer fusion (2Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). Alternate hypotheses propose that NSF and SNAPs have a chaperone-like function, altering the conformation of the SNAREs so as to activate them for docking, fusion, or both (6Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Most recently, it has been suggested that inter-membrane, coiled-coil SNARE interactions provide the energy for membrane contact prior to fusion (11Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1087-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 12Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E.

Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). Given that most systems studied are capable of many rounds of membrane fusion and retrieval, it is not clear at which stage in this cycle the SNARE complex functions. One model system that is not complicated by such recycling is the exocytosis of sea urchin egg cortical vesicles (CV). The major permanent block to polyspermy in many eggs is the synchronous exocytosis of thousands of CV, which line the plasma membrane, triggered by an increase in intracellular Ca2+caused by the fertilizing sperm. Isolated sheets of the plasma membrane with docked CV (called cell surface complexes or cortices) are fully functional for exocytosis (14Whitaker M. Biosci. Rep. 1987; 7: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Zimmerberg J. Sardet C. Epel D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2398-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This preparation provides easy access to the intracellular compartment, as the cytoplasmic surface of the egg membrane faces the bathing buffer solution. The CV become localized and attached to the plasma membrane during maturation of the unfertilized egg; thus, all of the components needed for Ca2+ sensing and bilayer fusion are pre-assembled and in place. In fact, only an increase to micromolar free Ca2+concentration is required to trigger exocytosis (14Whitaker M. Biosci. Rep. 1987; 7: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 16Zimmerberg J. Liu J. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 101: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar); by definition, both priming and docking have already occurred as ATP is not required for fusion (17Baker P.F. Whitaker M. Nature. 1978; 276: 513-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Moy G.W. Kopf G.S. Gache C. Vacquier V.D. Dev. Biol. 1983; 100: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 19Whalley T. Whitaker M. Biosci. Rep. 1988; 8: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The CV are tightly bound to the plasma membrane. This has been demonstrated in ultrastructural studies and explains why the complete fusion machinery of the isolated planar cortex remains intact despite shear forces that remove cytoplasm (20Vacquier V.D. Dev. Biol. 1975; 43: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The lack of complications such as reserve vesicle mobilization (21Neher E. Zucker R.S. Neuron. 1993; 10: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) and vesicle recycling (22Schweitzer F.E. Betz H. Augustine G.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 689-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) makes it ideally suited for studying the final steps in a single round of exocytosis. The CV can be removed from the plasma membrane. These isolated CV can be used to reconstitute CV-plasma membrane fusion (19Whalley T. Whitaker M. Biosci. Rep. 1988; 8: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 23Crabb J.H. Jackson R.C. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2263-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) but will also fuse, with comparable Ca2+ sensitivities, to other CV (24Vogel S.S. Zimmerberg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4749-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and to liposomes (25Vogel S.S. Chernomordik L.V. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25640-25643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CV-CV fusion is one of the simplest cases of membrane fusion. In particular, the fact that the isolated CV can fuse with liposomes indicates that CV have sufficient protein machinery for Ca2+ sensing and fusion. Homologues of rat VAMP2 vesicle-associated membrane protein and syntaxin 1A genes have been cloned from Strongylocentrotus purpuratus ovary and testis cDNA libraries, and the presence of the corresponding proteins in the egg and in sperm has been demonstrated (26Conner S. Leaf D. Wessel G. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 48: 106-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Schulz J.R. Wessel G.M. Vacquier V.D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, there have been two reports showing involvement of SNARE components in this sea urchin exocytosis in vivo and in vitro (28Bi G.Q. Alderton J.M. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 29Avery J. Hodel A. Whitaker M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1555-1561PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have characterized the distribution and interactions of SNARE proteins on isolated CV to determine if these proteins could be elements of the molecular machinery for Ca2+-dependent CV-CV fusion. We demonstrate that homologues of syntaxin, VAMP, and SNAP-25 exist on CV and form the heterotrimeric complexes first described in other cell types. We have found that, in the absence of cytosolic factors, SNARE complex disruption in the native membrane is triggered by free Ca2+ concentrations that trigger maximal membrane fusion. This is contrary to the hypotheses in which stable SNARE complexes are needed for fusion, since calcium does not stabilize them in causing fusion. ATP, dithiothreitol (DTT), and protease inhibitors were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, and bovine serum albumin was from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were obtained from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit IgGs and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were from Amersham International (Amersham, UK). Tetanus toxin was purchased from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA). N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) and high quality calcium chloride were from Fluka (Ronkonkoma, NY). Lauroyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) was supplied by Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All other reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies were prepared as described (VAMP, Ref. 30Pevsner J. Hsu S.-C. Braun J.E.A. Calakos N. Ting E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) or were the kind gifts of Drs. Reinhart Jahn (SNAP-25, clone 71.1) and Thomas C. Südhof (syntaxin, I378). Sea urchins of the speciesS. purpuratus were purchased from Marinus (Long Beach, CA) and maintained in aquaria in artificial sea water (435 mmNaCl, 40 mm MgCl2, 15 mmMgSO4, 11 mm CaCl2, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) at a temperature of 10 °C. Eggs were obtained by injecting 0.5m KCl into the intracoelomic cavity, and the jelly coat was removed by passing through 90-μm nylon mesh. Eggs were maintained on ice until use. CV were prepared by a variation of the method of Crabb and Jackson (23Crabb J.H. Jackson R.C. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2263-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cell surface complexes were prepared by homogenization in IM buffer (IM: 220 mm potassium glutamate, 500 mm glycine, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm benzamidine HCl, 2.5 mm ATP, 2 mm DTT, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 6.7) essentially as described previously (31Whalley T. Sokoloff A. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and were transferred to a high pH granule isolation buffer consisting of 450 mm KCl, 5 mmEGTA, 50 mm NH4Cl, 1 mm benzamidine HCl (pH 9.1) on ice. After 1 h many vesicles had detached from the plasma membrane. CV were purified from the plasma membrane debris by centrifugation at 700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the CV was retained and this centrifugation was repeated. Finally, the CV were collected by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. This final CV pellet consisted exclusively of vesicles approximately 1 μm in diameter. Fusion was measured at room temperature essentially as described previously (24Vogel S.S. Zimmerberg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4749-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). CV were suspended in IM to give an A 405 of 0.2 - 0.3 units, measured using a ThermoMax microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Aliquots of a suspension of CV (100 μl) were dispensed into 96-well, flat-bottom microtiter plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and CV-CV contact initiated by centrifugation (1000 × g, 10 min). The turbidity (A 405) of the resulting sheets of CV was measured. Fusion was triggered by addition of an equal volume of Ca2+-IM stock, designed to give the desired free Ca2+ concentration, and the plates were centrifuged again. A final turbidity measurement was made and the extent of fusion calculated as ΔA/A initial, corrected for a background determined by lysing the CV with distilled water. Final free Ca2+ concentrations were verified in mock samples using a Ca2+-sensitive electrode (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). All data were normalized so that the lowest free Ca2+ concentration used (∼100 nm) gave 0% fusion; as there was no significant difference in the extent of fusion triggered by 150–500 μm free Ca2+, the mean fusion determined at these free Ca2+concentrations in each experiment was set to 100%. Membrane proteins from CV were prepared by phase separation in Triton X-114 (32Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, CV were dissolved in Triton X-114 buffer (20 mmPIPES, pH 6.8, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm BAPTA, 2 mm DTT, 2 mmbenzamidine, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin and 2.5% Triton X-114) for 10 min on ice. The sample was centrifuged at 1750 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove particulate material; no insoluble fraction was evident with CV but was found when cortices were extracted. After this, the solution was warmed to 30 °C to induce phase partitioning and the two phases were separated by centrifugation at 1750 × g for 10 min at room temperature. Protein was precipitated from the lower phase (containing the Triton X-114) by mixing with nine volumes of acetone/ethanol (1/1) overnight at −30 °C. The protein was concentrated by centrifugation at 1750 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and dissolved in sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1.5% SDS, 10 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 11% sucrose, and 0.01% bromphenol blue), with or without heating for 3 min in boiling water. Total protein was measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. When CV were treated with tetanus toxin, 50 μg of tetanus holotoxin was incubated with 10 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 37 °C just prior to use. Isolated CV in 1 ml of IM buffer were incubated in the absence or presence of 300 nm toxin (8 μg of tetanus toxin light chain equivalent) at 30 °C for 16 h with constant rotation to prevent settling. Membrane proteins were then extracted from CV with Triton X-114 as described above. When the protein sample was prepared from CV treated with calcium buffer to induce fusion, CV were resuspended in IM to give an absorbance of 0.2–0.3 at 405 nm. Aliquots (3 ml) were dispensed into six-well flat-bottomed plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). To make contacting, layered granules, these plates containing the suspended CV were centrifuged (1000 × g for 5 min). After discarding 1.5 ml of supernatant, 1.5 ml of Ca2+-containing IM buffer to make final free Ca2+ concentrations of 100–450 μm, or an equal volume of IM buffer (control), was added to the wells to trigger fusion, followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. Proteins were extracted with Triton X-114 as described above. Pretreatments with and without NEM (5 mm) or LPC (100 μm) were carried out on CV in suspension at room temperature for 30 min or 5 min, respectively. Before Ca2+ treatment, all samples of CV suspension were examined microscopically to ensure that over 98% of CV remained as single vesicles of 1 μm diameter. Parallel fusion assays were always carried out when the effects of Ca2+, tetanus toxin, or inhibitors of fusion were being studied for their effects on protein complexes. SDS-PAGE was performed in 12% polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in a transfer buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. Blots were blocked for 30 min at room temperature in a solution consisting of 140 mm NaCl, 10 mmNaPO4, 0.05% Tween 20, 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Blots were incubated 90 min at room temperature with primary antibodies diluted in a solution consisting of 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaPO4, 0.05% Tween 20, 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Immunoreactive bands were detected using secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, followed by ECL. Quantitation of immunoblot signals was done by densitometric scanning of films and analysis with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). A small strip corresponding to the location of the 70-kDa VAMP immunoreactive band was cut from a preparative 12% polyacrylamide SDS gel following electrophoresis of an unboiled sample of Triton X-114-extracted CV membrane protein. This piece of gel was finely minced and the protein eluted by grinding with a micropestle in the presence of SDS sample buffer. After removal of gel fragments by centrifugation, protein was concentrated by precipitation with chloroform-methanol, dissolved in SDS-sample buffer once more, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Isolated CV were dissolved in ice-cold solubilization buffer (100 mm KCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, 8 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.12 mm AEBSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. 10 μl of syntaxin 1A antiserum or VAMP-2 antiserum was covalently coupled to protein G-agarose (100 μl of packed beads) using an Immunopure® protein G IgG orientation kit (Pierce). The beads were washed with the buffer described above, and incubated with solubilized CV samples for 5 h at 4 °C, followed by washing again with the same buffer. Bound antigens were eluted with 50 mm triethanolamine (pH 11.5). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-syntaxin 1A and anti-VAMP-2 antibodies. Samples of extracted CV membranes were analyzed for the presence of SNARE proteins by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting by standard procedures. CV contained proteins that cross-reacted with polyclonal antibodies to mammalian VAMP2 at an apparent molecular mass of ∼19 kDa, with antibodies to syntaxin 1A at ∼40 kDa, and with a monoclonal antibody to SNAP-25 at ∼35 kDa (Fig. 1). Samples of rat brain membrane proteins (5Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar) yielded comparable results, although the mammalian VAMP ran at a slightly higher apparent molecular mass (data not shown). The feature of the SNARE hypothesis that accounts for the specificity of membrane interactions is the formation of a complex between pairs of t- and v-SNAREs. It is known that mammalian SNAREs can form a SDS-stable complex that is disrupted only at high temperature (33Hayashi T. McMahon H.T. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO. J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 34Pellegrini L.L. O'Connor V. Lottspeich F. Betz H. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 4705-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To visualize the sea urchin SNARE complex, we prepared a CV membrane protein sample dissolved in SDS sample buffer without boiling. In these samples, syntaxin and VAMP immunoreactivities now also appeared in a form with lower electrophoretic mobility (Fig.2; about 70 kDa), in addition to the monomeric forms previously detected in boiled samples. Immunoblotting with the anti-syntaxin antibody always resulted in a broader and somewhat more diffuse band at 70 kDa than did blotting with the VAMP antibody. After boiling, the 70-kDa band was not detected by either antibody, as shown in Fig. 1. Additional studies showed that when cut and eluted from the gel, boiled, and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the constituents of the 70-kDa band migrated as monomeric VAMP, syntaxin, and SNAP-25 (Fig. 2). Only one band of anti-VAMP-reactive protein at ∼19 kDa was detected in this material derived from the complex band (data not shown). SDS-PAGE of solubilized CV protein at several different gel concentrations (7–15%) still yielded only a single band at 70 kDa, further indicating that this was a single complex (data not shown). Only a small fraction of the total amount of these proteins present in the CV is detected as a SDS-resistant complex. To confirm that CV membrane proteins which cross-reacted with VAMP2, syntaxin 1A, and SNAP-25 antibodies interacted specifically to form a complex, like known t- and v- SNARES, CV membrane proteins were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 and immunoprecipitated with anti-syntaxin 1A antibody or with anti-VAMP2 antibody. Each immunoprecipitate was analyzed by immunoblotting in duplicate lanes using anti-VAMP2, anti-syntaxin 1A, and anti-SNAP-25 antibodies. A protein recognized by the VAMP2 antibody was immunoprecipitated together with syntaxin using the syntaxin 1A antibody, while syntaxin co-immunoprecipitated with VAMP using the VAMP2 antibody (Fig.3). SNAP-25 was also detected in both immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3). Thus a stable complex containing the three putative sea urchin SNAREs was recovered from Triton X-100 extracts of CV membranes. Immunoprecipitation using antibodies to a non-SNARE protein did not result in any detectable recovery of syntaxin and only a faint band corresponding to VAMP (data not shown). We also confirmed the presence of SNARE protein complexes using sucrose gradient centrifugation according to the procedures of Schulz et al.(27Schulz J.R. Wessel G.M. Vacquier V.D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The results of these experiments were also fully consistent with the presence of a heterotrimeric SNARE protein complex on the CV membrane (data not shown). Thus, by direct SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2), as well as co-immunoprecipitation studies (Fig. 3) and sucrose gradient analysis, a fraction of the total VAMP in CV was found in a complex together with both syntaxin and SNAP-25. Another feature of the SNARE complex is the resistance of its constituent proteins to cleavage by clostridial proteases (33Hayashi T. McMahon H.T. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H.

To determine if the SNARE complex exists in a preparation of contacting CV membranes and is thus a candidate for involvement in Ca2+-triggered CV fusion, or whether it is only formed in detergent solution after extraction, we treated intact CV with tetanus toxin. Isolated CV were incubated at 30 °C for 16 h in the absence or presence of 300 nm reduced tetanus toxin. After incubation, microscopic examination showed the CV to still exist singly in suspension. CV membrane proteins were extracted with Triton X-114, dissolved in sample buffer without boiling and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-VAMP2 antibody. Most of the sea urchin VAMP monomer was cleaved by tetanus toxin, whereas VAMP in the 70-kDa complex was insensitive to cleavage (Fig.4 A). However, tetanus toxin treatment did not inhibit CV-CV fusion (Fig. 4 B) or CV-liposome fusion. 2M. Tahara, J. R. Coorssen, and J. Zimmerberg, unpublished observations. Thus the bulk of the VAMP monomer on CV is not needed for Ca2+-triggered fusion. It is possible that the remaining VAMP in the SNARE complex or as monomer was sufficient for fusion. Attempts to further lower the VAMP concentration on CV failed to reduce fusion, but also failed to remove all the VAMP (see “Discussion”). Since the other cross-reacting bands at <14 kDa are not components of the complex (Fig. 2), they are unlikely to be tetanus toxin-resistant VAMPs. Might disruption of the SNARE complex accompany fusion if the complex is linking two membranes early in the fusion process, as suggested by the SNARE hypothesis (2Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar)? We tested the effect of Ca2+, which triggers CV-CV fusion, on SNARE complex stability. Sufficient CaCl2 was added to contacting, layered CV to yield a final free Ca2+ concentration of 450 μm, a concentration known to cause maximal fusion in this system (Ref. 24Vogel S.S. Zimmerberg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4749-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar; see also “Materials and Methods”). Proteins were subsequently analyzed (without boiling) by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were probed with antibodies to VAMP-2. After this Ca2+treatment, the SNARE complex was no longer detected (Fig.5). All the VAMP was now in the monomeric form. To check for losses of proteins from CV, proteins were also extracted from the supernatant after the addition of Ca2+buffer, and from the aqueous phase after detergent extraction, but the SNARE proteins were not detected (data not shown). This complete Ca2+-triggered disruption of SNARE complexes was seen at all free Ca2+ concentrations tested (∼90–500 μm; see also Figs. 6 and7); parallel CV-CV fusion assays confirmed a maximal extent of fusion under these conditions (data not shown).Figure 6Pre-formed SNARE complexes exist on CV and also form bet"

The protein has nucleic acid annealing activity and promotes rapid and extensive hybridization of complementary nucleic acid sequences.

We further show that NC/RT interactions underlie the enhancement of RT processivity within nucleoprotein complexes formed in vitro, suggesting that they are critical for DNA synthesis in vivo.DISCUSSIONCurrent data suggest that NCp7 is an essential co-factor of reverse transcriptase in vitro (22Rodriguez-Rodriguez L.

Recent work in our laboratory also supports an important role for NCp7 during the reverse transcription step of viral replication in vivo(28Berthoux L. Pechoux C. Ottmann M. Morel G. Darlix J.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6973-6981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Poon D.T. Wu J. Aldovini A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6607-6616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Tanchou V. Decimo D. Pechoux C. Lener D. Rogemond V. Berthoux L. Ottmann M. Darlix J.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4442-4447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In vitro reconstitution of functional nucleoprotein complexes showed that their stability is achieved through the binding of NCp7 to the RNA template and NCp7/NCp7 interactions (8Tanchou V. Gabus C. Rogemond V. Darlix J.-L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The coating of RNA by NC and protein/protein interactions within the resulting complex most likely account for the protection of viral RNA from RNase degradation (8Tanchou V. Gabus C. Rogemond V. Darlix J.-L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). While NC/NC interactions may contribute to nucleoprotein complex stability and protection of the RNA template, it remains difficult to reconcile these properties with the widely reported ability of NC to enhance RT activity (22Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Tsuchihashi Z. Fuentes G.M. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15005-15011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Ji X. Klarmann G.J. Preston B.D.

Biol. 1997; 268: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which requires access to the primer and template during replication. Possible interactions between NCp7 and RT have been inferred in the past (18Cameron C.E. Ghosh M. Le Grice S.F. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6700-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,21Peliska J.A. Balasubramanian S. Giedroc D.P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13817-13823Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 31Barat C. Schatz O. Le Grice S. Darlix J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), but the nature of this interaction and its implication in the co-operation of RT and NCp7 during reverse transcription are poorly understood. For these reasons, the focus of the present work was on putative NCp7/RT interactions within nucleoprotein complexes.Using three independent methods to probe protein/protein interactionsin vitro, we show that NCp7 and RT are capable of direct interaction (Figs. 1 and 2). This interaction is independent of nucleic acid integrity, since it remains unaffected by treatment with either RNase or DNase (data not shown). NCp7 interacts with both RT subunits independently (Fig. 1) and requires the presence of both its zinc fingers (Table I, Fig. 2, A and B). The N-terminal domain of NCp7 also seems to be implicated, since the mutant NCp7-(13–64) interacts less efficiently with RT (Fig.2 B).Protein/protein and protein/nucleic acid interactions in active nucleoprotein complexes were analyzed in vitro using a centrifugation method to separate material not participating in high molecular mass complexes. NC mutants described herein show markedly different abilities to bind RNA and participate in high molecular mass complexes. NCp7 mutants NCp7-(13–64) and NCp7-(1–55) show 1.5–2-fold decreased recruitment of RNA into complexes relative to WT NCp7 (TableII), although for NCp7-(1–55) the difference is most evident at low NC concentrations. The reduced ability of these NCp7 mutants to promote high molecular mass complexes containing RNA may be partly explained by RNA affinity differences. A filter-binding assay, measuring RNA affinity directly, was in good agreement with the order and magnitude of differences between the NCp7 mutants (data not shown). The variation in RNA affinity between NCp7 mutants NCp7-(1–55) and NCp7-(13–64) is in agreement with previous data (32Dannull J. Surovoy A. Jung G. Moelling K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1525-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Moreover, differences observed in nucleoprotein complex formation may also be due to defective NCp7/NCp7 interactions. We previously showed that the N-terminal domain of NCp7 is important for cDNA synthesis and nucleocapsid morphogenesisin vivo (28Berthoux L. Pechoux C. Ottmann M. Morel G. Darlix J.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6973-6981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in agreement with evidence demonstrating N-terminal domain involvement in NC/NC interactions (8Tanchou V. Gabus C. Rogemond V. Darlix J.-L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, at least for NCp7-(13–64), which lacks this domain, anomalous NC/NC interactions may contribute to its attenuated capacity to form complexes. Work is in progress to better define the regions in nucleocapsid protein involved in NC/NC and NC/RNA interactions.When we analyzed nucleoprotein complexes in the presence of limiting amounts of RT, we found that the relative quantities of RT co-sedimented with the complexes were lower for NCp7-(1–55) and NCp7-(13–64) relative to NCp7 WT (Table III). This variation may be accounted for by nucleic acid affinity differences outlined above and/or the relative capacities of these NC mutants to recruit RT. For NCp7-(1–55), interaction with RNA is more labile than WT, possibly explaining why RT is retained in complexes to a lesser extent. For NCp7 13–64, both NC/RNA and NC/RT interactions are less efficient, resulting in weak retention of RT in high molecular weight complexes (pellet fraction, Table III). In summary, RT recruitment into nucleoprotein complexes is influenced by the stability of NC/RT interactions as well as the sum of a complex interplay implicating NC/nucleic acid, NC/NC, and RT/nucleic acid interactions.Reverse transcription within nucleoprotein complexes was possible when a limiting amount of RT was added after sedimentation (Figs. 3 and 4), indicating that unlike nucleases, RT can access the primer-template complex even when coated by NC protein (8Tanchou V. Gabus C. Rogemond V. Darlix J.-L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, only NCp7 WT allowed full recovery of reverse transcription activity in the pellet fraction under these conditions (Fig. 4). Furthermore, NCp7 enhances RT processivity, in agreement with recent reports (22Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Tsuchihashi Z. Fuentes G.M. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15005-15011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Ji X. Klarmann G.J. Preston B.D.

Biol. 1997; 268: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In our hands, NCp7 WT and NCp7-(1–55) enhance RT processivity, while NCp7-(13–64) is generally much less efficient in systems based on either 5′- or 3′-HIV-I RNA (Fig. 5, A and B).Taken together, results presented herein allow us to propose an extended model for the enhancement of RT processivity within nucleoprotein complexes. Coupled to the well documented unwinding activity of NC protein (evidenced by its inhibition of self-priming; see Refs. 12Li X. Quan Y. Arts E.J. Li Z. Preston B.D. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P.

Biol. 1997; 268: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) NCp7/RNA interactions as well as NCp7/NCp7 and NCp7/RT interactions act synergistically to form functional nucleoprotein complexes, possibly giving rise to local increases in RT concentration. We speculate that NCp7 coating the RNA template acts as a bridge for additional RT/RNA interactions. These may have a stabilizing effect on RT, making it more likely to remain bound to the template and facilitating renewed RT recruitment if/when elongation is prematurely terminated.The distinct properties observed in this work between NCp7 WT (NCp7-(1–72)) and NCp7-(1–55) are of interest, since both forms are reportedly observed in mature viruses (2Henderson L.E. Bowers M.A. Sowder R.C.D. Serabyn S.A. Johnson D.G. Bess Jr., J.W. Arthur L.O. Bryant D.K. Fenselau C. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1856-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The co-existence of both forms may be of importance, their properties permitting a form of regulation in which distinct activities are utilized at different stages of viral DNA synthesis. Retroviral replication requires conversion of the single-stranded RNA genome into an integration-competent, double-stranded viral DNA (1Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 121-160Google Scholar). This conversion is accomplished by viral reverse transcriptase (RT), 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; NC, nucleocapsid; NCp, NC protein; HIV-I, human immunodeficiency virus, type I; nt, nucleotide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HBB, Hepes binding buffer. 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; NC, nucleocapsid; NCp, NC protein; HIV-I, human immunodeficiency virus, type I; nt, nucleotide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HBB, Hepes binding buffer. which possesses RNA and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities, and occurs within a nucleoprotein complex derived from the virion core. The nucleoprotein complex contains the dimeric RNA genome in close association with 2000–3000 molecules of nucleocapsid (NC) protein (2Henderson L.E. Bowers M.A. Sowder R.C.D. Serabyn S.A.

The nucleoprotein complex is a stable substructure of the viral particle (5Swanstrom R. Wills J.W. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses.

Despite the fact that NCp7 covers the viral RNA (at a stoichiometry of about 1 NCp7 per 7 nt), offering effective protection against nucleases, reverse transcriptase is able to enter these complexes and initiate reverse transcription from tRNALys,3 hybridized to the primer binding site (9Barat C.

The protein has nucleic acid annealing activity and promotes rapid and extensive hybridization of complementary nucleic acid sequences. NCp7 also exhibits strand exchange activity that favors the most stable double-stranded product (14Lapadat-Tapolsky M. Pernelle C. Borie C. Darlix J.L.

In addition, NCp7 enhances the synthesis of full-length cDNA by influencing RT processivity (8Tanchou V. Gabus C. Rogemond V. Darlix J.-L. J. Mol.

The apparent functional cooperation between NCp7 and RT prompted us to closely examine possible interactions between these two viral proteins. Here we show that NCp7 interacts directly with RT, an interaction dependent upon the integrity of the nucleocapsid protein. We further show that NC/RT interactions underlie the enhancement of RT processivity within nucleoprotein complexes formed in vitro, suggesting that they are critical for DNA synthesis in vivo. DISCUSSIONCurrent data suggest that NCp7 is an essential co-factor of reverse transcriptase in vitro (22Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Tsuchihashi Z. Fuentes G.M. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol.

Recent work in our laboratory also supports an important role for NCp7 during the reverse transcription step of viral replication in vivo(28Berthoux L. Pechoux C. Ottmann M. Morel G. Darlix J.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6973-6981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Poon D.T. Wu J. Aldovini A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6607-6616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Tanchou V. Decimo D. Pechoux C. Lener D. Rogemond V. Berthoux L. Ottmann M. Darlix J.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4442-4447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In vitro reconstitution of functional nucleoprotein complexes showed that their stability is achieved through the binding of NCp7 to the RNA template and NCp7/NCp7 interactions (8Tanchou V. Gabus C. Rogemond V. Darlix J.-L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The coating of RNA by NC and protein/protein interactions within the resulting complex most likely account for the protection of viral RNA from RNase degradation (8Tanchou V. Gabus C. Rogemond V. Darlix J.-L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). While NC/NC interactions may contribute to nucleoprotein complex stability and protection of the RNA template, it remains difficult to reconcile these properties with the widely reported ability of NC to enhance RT activity (22Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Tsuchihashi Z. Fuentes G.M. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15005-15011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Ji X. Klarmann G.J. Preston B.D.

Biol. 1997; 268: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which requires access to the primer and template during replication. Possible interactions between NCp7 and RT have been inferred in the past (18Cameron C.E. Ghosh M. Le Grice S.F. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6700-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,21Peliska J.A. Balasubramanian S. Giedroc D.P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13817-13823Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 31Barat C. Schatz O. Le Grice S. Darlix J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), but the nature of this interaction and its implication in the co-operation of RT and NCp7 during reverse transcription are poorly understood. For these reasons, the focus of the present work was on putative NCp7/RT interactions within nucleoprotein complexes.Using three independent methods to probe protein/protein interactionsin vitro, we show that NCp7 and RT are capable of direct interaction (Figs. 1 and 2). This interaction is independent of nucleic acid integrity, since it remains unaffected by treatment with either RNase or DNase (data not shown). NCp7 interacts with both RT subunits independently (Fig. 1) and requires the presence of both its zinc fingers (Table I, Fig. 2, A and B). The N-terminal domain of NCp7 also seems to be implicated, since the mutant NCp7-(13–64) interacts less efficiently with RT (Fig.2 B).Protein/protein and protein/nucleic acid interactions in active nucleoprotein complexes were analyzed in vitro using a centrifugation method to separate material not participating in high molecular mass complexes. NC mutants described herein show markedly different abilities to bind RNA and participate in high molecular mass complexes. NCp7 mutants NCp7-(13–64) and NCp7-(1–55) show 1.5–2-fold decreased recruitment of RNA into complexes relative to WT NCp7 (TableII), although for NCp7-(1–55) the difference is most evident at low NC concentrations. The reduced ability of these NCp7 mutants to promote high molecular mass complexes containing RNA may be partly explained by RNA affinity differences. A filter-binding assay, measuring RNA affinity directly, was in good agreement with the order and magnitude of differences between the NCp7 mutants (data not shown). The variation in RNA affinity between NCp7 mutants NCp7-(1–55) and NCp7-(13–64) is in agreement with previous data (32Dannull J. Surovoy A. Jung G. Moelling K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1525-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Moreover, differences observed in nucleoprotein complex formation may also be due to defective NCp7/NCp7 interactions. We previously showed that the N-terminal domain of NCp7 is important for cDNA synthesis and nucleocapsid morphogenesisin vivo (28Berthoux L. Pechoux C. Ottmann M. Morel G. Darlix J.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6973-6981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in agreement with evidence demonstrating N-terminal domain involvement in NC/NC interactions (8Tanchou V. Gabus C. Rogemond V. Darlix J.-L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, at least for NCp7-(13–64), which lacks this domain, anomalous NC/NC interactions may contribute to its attenuated capacity to form complexes. Work is in progress to better define the regions in nucleocapsid protein involved in NC/NC and NC/RNA interactions.When we analyzed nucleoprotein complexes in the presence of limiting amounts of RT, we found that the relative quantities of RT co-sedimented with the complexes were lower for NCp7-(1–55) and NCp7-(13–64) relative to NCp7 WT (Table III). This variation may be accounted for by nucleic acid affinity differences outlined above and/or the relative capacities of these NC mutants to recruit RT. For NCp7-(1–55), interaction with RNA is more labile than WT, possibly explaining why RT is retained in complexes to a lesser extent. For NCp7 13–64, both NC/RNA and NC/RT interactions are less efficient, resulting in weak retention of RT in high molecular weight complexes (pellet fraction, Table III). In summary, RT recruitment into nucleoprotein complexes is influenced by the stability of NC/RT interactions as well as the sum of a complex interplay implicating NC/nucleic acid, NC/NC, and RT/nucleic acid interactions.Reverse transcription within nucleoprotein complexes was possible when a limiting amount of RT was added after sedimentation (Figs. 3 and 4), indicating that unlike nucleases, RT can access the primer-template complex even when coated by NC protein (8Tanchou V. Gabus C. Rogemond V. Darlix J.-L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, only NCp7 WT allowed full recovery of reverse transcription activity in the pellet fraction under these conditions (Fig. 4). Furthermore, NCp7 enhances RT processivity, in agreement with recent reports (22Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Tsuchihashi Z. Fuentes G.M. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15005-15011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Ji X. Klarmann G.J. Preston B.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 132-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Lapadat-Tapolsky M. Gabus C. Rau M. Darlix J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In our hands, NCp7 WT and NCp7-(1–55) enhance RT processivity, while NCp7-(13–64) is generally much less efficient in systems based on either 5′- or 3′-HIV-I RNA (Fig. 5, A and B).Taken together, results presented herein allow us to propose an extended model for the enhancement of RT processivity within nucleoprotein complexes. Coupled to the well documented unwinding activity of NC protein (evidenced by its inhibition of self-priming; see Refs. 12Li X. Quan Y. Arts E.J. Li Z. Preston B.D. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P.

Biol. 1997; 268: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) NCp7/RNA interactions as well as NCp7/NCp7 and NCp7/RT interactions act synergistically to form functional nucleoprotein complexes, possibly giving rise to local increases in RT concentration. We speculate that NCp7 coating the RNA template acts as a bridge for additional RT/RNA interactions. These may have a stabilizing effect on RT, making it more likely to remain bound to the template and facilitating renewed RT recruitment if/when elongation is prematurely terminated.The distinct properties observed in this work between NCp7 WT (NCp7-(1–72)) and NCp7-(1–55) are of interest, since both forms are reportedly observed in mature viruses (2Henderson L.E. Bowers M.A. Sowder R.C.D. Serabyn S.A. Johnson D.G. Bess Jr., J.W. Arthur L.O. Bryant D.K. Fenselau C. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1856-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The co-existence of both forms may be of importance, their properties permitting a form of regulation in which distinct activities are utilized at different stages of viral DNA synthesis. Current data suggest that NCp7 is an essential co-factor of reverse transcriptase in vitro (22Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Tsuchihashi Z. Fuentes G.M. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol.

J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, at least for NCp7-(13–64), which lacks this domain, anomalous NC/NC interactions may contribute to its attenuated capacity to form complexes. Work is in progress to better define the regions in nucleocapsid protein involved in NC/NC and NC/RNA interactions. When we analyzed nucleoprotein complexes in the presence of limiting amounts of RT, we found that the relative quantities of RT co-sedimented with the complexes were lower for NCp7-(1–55) and NCp7-(13–64) relative to NCp7 WT (Table III). This variation may be accounted for by nucleic acid affinity differences outlined above and/or the relative capacities of these NC mutants to recruit RT. For NCp7-(1–55), interaction with RNA is more labile than WT, possibly explaining why RT is retained in complexes to a lesser extent. For NCp7 13–64, both NC/RNA and NC/RT interactions are less efficient, resulting in weak retention of RT in high molecular weight complexes (pellet fraction, Table III). In summary, RT recruitment into nucleoprotein complexes is influenced by the stability of NC/RT interactions as well as the sum of a complex interplay implicating NC/nucleic acid, NC/NC, and RT/nucleic acid interactions. Reverse transcription within nucleoprotein complexes was possible when a limiting amount of RT was added after sedimentation (Figs. 3 and 4), indicating that unlike nucleases, RT can access the primer-template complex even when coated by NC protein (8Tanchou V. Gabus C. Rogemond V. Darlix J.-L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, only NCp7 WT allowed full recovery of reverse transcription activity in the pellet fraction under these conditions (Fig. 4). Furthermore, NCp7 enhances RT processivity, in agreement with recent reports (22Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Tsuchihashi Z. Fuentes G.M. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15005-15011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Ji X. Klarmann G.J. Preston B.D.

Biol. 1997; 268: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In our hands, NCp7 WT and NCp7-(1–55) enhance RT processivity, while NCp7-(13–64) is generally much less efficient in systems based on either 5′- or 3′-HIV-I RNA (Fig. 5, A and B). Taken together, results presented herein allow us to propose an extended model for the enhancement of RT processivity within nucleoprotein complexes. Coupled to the well documented unwinding activity of NC protein (evidenced by its inhibition of self-priming; see Refs. 12Li X. Quan Y. Arts E.J. Li Z. Preston B.D. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P.

Biol. 1997; 268: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) NCp7/RNA interactions as well as NCp7/NCp7 and NCp7/RT interactions act synergistically to form functional nucleoprotein complexes, possibly giving rise to local increases in RT concentration. We speculate that NCp7 coating the RNA template acts as a bridge for additional RT/RNA interactions. These may have a stabilizing effect on RT, making it more likely to remain bound to the template and facilitating renewed RT recruitment if/when elongation is prematurely terminated. The distinct properties observed in this work between NCp7 WT (NCp7-(1–72)) and NCp7-(1–55) are of interest, since both forms are reportedly observed in mature viruses (2Henderson L.E. Bowers M.A. Sowder R.C.D. Serabyn S.A. Johnson D.G. Bess Jr., J.W. Arthur L.O. Bryant D.K. Fenselau C. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1856-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The co-existence of both forms may be of importance, their properties permitting a form of regulation in which distinct activities are utilized at different stages of viral DNA synthesis. We thank M. Rau, A. Corbin, and. R. Calogero for helpful discussion and critical reading of the manuscript."

In the peripheral nervous system, NO functions as a nonadrenergic-noncholinergic neurotransmitter that mediates relaxation of smooth muscles in gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts and in the cerebral circulation (1Rand M.J. Li C.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 659-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). NO also acts as a retrograde messenger that regulates synaptic efficacy in the central nervous system. Lowering NO levels by NOS inhibitors blocks hippocampal long-term potentiation, a model of learning and memory (2Garthwaite J. Boulton C.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 683-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar, 3Brenman J.E. Bredt D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 119-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent experimental evidence has also indicated that NO plays important roles in neuronal development (4Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 301-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 5Williams C.V. Nordquist D. McLoon S.C. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1746-1755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wu H.H. Willams C.V. McLoon S.C. Science. 1994; 265: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In addition to its physiological roles as a messenger molecule in the peripheral and central nervous systems, NO is also cytotoxic at abnormally high concentrations. In neurons, stimulation of NO synthesis is primarily mediated by the activation of NMDA receptors (2Garthwaite J. Boulton C.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 683-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). Overactivity of an NMDA receptor is implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases including stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (7Lipton S.A. Rosenberg P.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar, 8Samdani A.F. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Stroke. 1997; 28: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Neuronal NOS selective inhibitor was shown to protect brain from ischemic injury (9Iadecola C. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 132-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Moreover, nNOS knock-out mice exhibit increased resistance to excitotoxicity following focal cerebral ischemia (10Huang Z. Huang P.L. Panahian N. Dalkara T. Fishman M.C. Moskowitz M.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1883-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). Neuronal cell cultures from nNOS-deficient mice are resistant to NMDA-mediated neurotoxicity (11Dawson V.L. Kizushi V. Huang P.L. Snyder S.H. Dawson T.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2479-2487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given both the good and bad properties of NO in neuronal signaling, it is essential that NO synthesis is tightly regulated. NO is synthesized from l-Arg by a complicated chemical reaction catalyzed by three isoforms of NOSs, namely nNOS, endothelial NOS (eNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS). Neuronal NOS is the primary regulator of neuronal NO concentration and is a Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent enzyme (12Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3120) Google Scholar). Dual immuno-electron microscopic studies have shown that nNOS co-localizes with NMDA receptors in many neuronal cells (13Aoki C. Rhee J. Lubin M. Dawson T.M. Brain Res. 1997; 750: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The association of nNOS with NMDA receptors is mediated by postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) and PSD-93 using PDZ domains of the proteins (14Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar, 15Brenman J.E. Christopherson K.S. Craven S. McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7407-7415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Co-localization of nNOS and NMDA receptors ensures that Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors is selectively coupled to nNOS activity. Because abnormally high concentrations of NO are neuronal toxic, it is natural that neuronal cells contain an NO level down-regulation mechanism(s) in addition to the NMDA-coupled up-regulation mechanism. Recently, a protein inhibitor, designated as PIN, was discovered to specifically inhibit nNOS (16Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 274: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). PIN contains 89 amino acid residues and is highly stable in solution. 2M. Zhang, unpublished data. 2M. Zhang, unpublished data. The binding of PIN to nNOS destabilizes the dimeric structure of nNOS and thereby inhibits the enzyme activity (16Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 274: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The specificity of nNOS inhibition by PIN originates from the fact that the PIN binding domain of nNOS (amino acid residues 161–245) is absent from eNOS and iNOS (16Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 274: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The expression levels of PIN and nNOS are nearly parallel in different brain regions, supporting the idea that PIN may function as an in vivo nNOS activity regulator (17Greenwood M.T. Guo Y. Kumar U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Following global ischemia, the PIN level rapidly increases in the brain regions that are resistant to ischemic damage (18Gillardon F. Krep H. Brinker G. Lenz C. Böttiger B. Hossmann K.-A. Neurosci. 1998; 84: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The induction of PIN expression following global ischemia presumably counteracts the rise of nNOS activity, thereby protecting neurons from excess NO-induced damage. In this study, we obtained large quantities of pure PIN from a bacterial overexpression system. The protein was shown to exist as a monomer to trimer equilibrium in solution by various biochemical approaches. We have also shown, using NMR spectroscopy, that the previously identified PIN-binding domain of nNOS (amino acid residues 161–245) adopts a random coil structure in solution. The PIN-binding domain of nNOS was mapped to a 17-residue peptide fragment by a combination of NMR spectroscopy and truncation mutations. The results obtained in this work provide insights into the nNOS inhibition mechanism by PIN. The 18-residue synthetic peptide (MKDTGIQVDRDLDGKSHK) corresponding to Met-228 to Lys-245 of nNOS was synthesized by the Peptide Synthesis Laboratory, University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. The purity of the peptide was greater than 95% as judged by analytical high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Because of the lack of aromatic amino acid residues, the concentration of peptide was determined by NMR spectroscopy using the amino acid Tyr as an internal reference. The rat PIN gene was PCR amplified from rat brain cDNA using the following two primers: 5′-GGAATTCCATATGTGCGACCGGAAGG-3′ (coding strand) and 5′-GCGGATCCTTAACCAGATTTGAACAGGAG-3′ (noncoding strand). The amplified PIN fragment was inserted into the NdeI-BamHI sites of the plasmid pET-14b (Novagen). The pET-14b plasmid harboring the PIN gene was then transformed into Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) host cells. To express PIN, host cells containing the PIN plasmid construct were grown in LB medium at 37 °C till theA 600 reached ≈1.0. PIN expression was induced by the addition of IPTG to final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the culture temperature was decreased to 30 °C. Protein expression lasted for 8 h. Uniformly 15N-labeled PIN were prepared by growing the bacteria in M9 minimal medium using15NH4Cl (1 g/liter) as the sole nitrogen source. Recombinant PIN was purified by a combination of a Ni2+-NTA affinity column and other chromatographic techniques. Cell pellets were resuspended in 20–30 ml of Ni2+-NTA column binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm imidazole, 0.5m NaCl) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml antipain. Cells were lysed by a French Press, and the lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 ×g for 30 min. Soluble PIN in the supernatant was purified on the Ni2+-NTA column following the instructions of the manufacturer (Novagen). The His-tagged PIN eluted from the Ni2+-NTA column was directly applied to a Sephacryl 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove small amounts of contaminant proteins. His-tagged PIN was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.5 containing 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.6 m KCl. The fractions containing PIN were combined and dialyzed overnight against 25 mm PO43− buffer containing 1 mm DTT at pH 6.5. The N-terminal His-tag was then cleaved by incubating His-PIN with thrombin (1 unit of enzyme per mg of PIN for 8 h). The His-tag and PIN mixture was loaded on to a CM-Sepharose column equilibrated with 25 mmPO43− buffer at pH 6.5. PIN was then eluted by a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 1 m. The purified PIN was extensively dialyzed against 10 mmNH4CO3 buffer, freeze dried, and stored at −80 °C. The rat PIN-binding domain (PINB) of nNOS encompassing amino acid residues 161 to 245 was cloned from rat brain cDNA by PCR using a pair of primers: 5′-GCGGATCCCATGCCCAAGGCCATG-3′ (coding strand) and 5′-GCGGATCCTATTTGTGCGATTTGCCATC-3′ (noncoding strand). The PCR-amplified fragment was inserted into theBamHI-EcoRI sites of the GST-fusion vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The PINB containing pGEX-2T plasmid was then transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli host cells (Novagen) for large scale protein expression. Various PINB truncation mutants fused with GST were generated in a similar manner using PCR. To express PINB and its truncated forms, host cells containing the PINB plasmids were grown in LB medium at 37 °C toA 600 ≈ 1.0 before the addition of IPTG (0.5 mm final concentration). The expression of the proteins lasted for 3 h at 37 °C, and the cells were then harvested by centrifugation. Uniformly 15N- and15N/13C-labeled PINB were prepared by culturing the bacteria in M9 minimal medium using 15NH4Cl (1 g/liter) as the sole nitrogen source or15NH4Cl (1 g/liter) and13C6-glucose (1 g/liter) as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. GST-fused full-length PINB and its truncated mutants were purified using GSH-Sepharose affinity columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The purified GST-fusion proteins were dialyzed against 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5, to remove GSH, and the protein samples were directly used for PIN-binding assay. Full-length PINB was released from GST-PINB by thrombin digestion while the fusion protein was bound to the affinity column (digested with 3 units of thrombin per mg of GST-PINB for 3 h at room temperature). The supernatant containing PINB was passed through a Sephacryl-100 gel filtration column to remove thrombin and other small amounts of contaminant proteins (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the fractions containing PINB were found to be pure as judged by a single band on an SDS-PAGE gel (data not shown). To cross-link free amino groups of PIN, the protein sample (final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml) was dissolved in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, in the presence of 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT. The sample was then treated with 0.05 mm DFDNB (Pierce) for 1 h at 30 °C. DFDNB was dissolved in methanol, and the final methanol concentration in cross-linking reactions was 5% (v/v). Cross-linking of PIN with DSG (Pierce) was performed identically, except that DSG was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide, and the reaction was carried out at 20 °C for 30 min. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted using a Beckman Optima XLI analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an optical detection system. Experiments were carried out using 12-mm path length cells with quartz windows. The centrifugation was run at 10,000, 15,000 and 20,000 rpm at 20 °C for 12 h at each speed. Samples were considered at equilibrium when sequential scans 2 h apart were superimposable. The protein was dissolved in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 1 mm DTT, pH 6.0, and 100 μl of protein sample was filled in the cell. Data were collected using continuous radial scanning at 280 nm. Partial specific volume was calculated based on the amino acid composition of the protein (19Laue T.L. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, London1992: 90-125Google Scholar). The data of three different speeds were globally fit with a monomer-nmer equilibrium (nPIN ⇌ PINn) with the molecular weight of the monomer as a fixed constant. The experimental data were fit using “Multiorg” software provided by Beckman. The binding between PIN and various truncated forms of GST-PINB was assayed in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5. Equal molar amounts of PIN and various GST-PINB samples (0.6 nmol each) were mixed in 30 μl of the assay buffer. The GST-PINB/PIN complexes were precipitated by 10 μl of fresh GSH-Sepharose beads. The pellets were washed three times with 300 μl of the assay buffer, and the washed pellets were boiled with 30 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The intensity of the PIN band on SDS-PAGE gels was used to judge the binding between PIN and various truncated forms of PINB. All NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian UNITY Inova 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a pulse field gradient driver and a z-axis actively shielded1H(13C,15N)-triple resonance probe head. The temperature of all NMR experiments was maintained at 30 °C. A 15N-labeled and a 15N/13C-labeled PINB sample, dissolved in 90% H2O, 10% D2O containing 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, were prepared for the sequential backbone assignment of the protein. Sensitivity-enhanced 1H-15N-HSQC (20Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2429) Google Scholar), HNCACB (21Witterkind M. Mueller L. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; B101: 201-205Crossref Scopus (852) Google Scholar), and CBCA(CO)NH (22Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 6291-6293Crossref Scopus (926) Google Scholar) experiments were recorded for the sequence-specific backbone resonance assignment of PINB. The sequential assignment was further confirmed by a pair of 15N-separated three-dimensional-TOCSY (mixing time = 71.5 msec), and three-dimensional-NOESY (mixing time = 100 msec) experiments recorded on a 15N-labeled PINB sample (23Zhang O. Kay L.E. Oliver J.P. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). All NMR data were processed and displayed using the NMRPipe software package (24Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11527) Google Scholar). To study the conformational changes of PINB induced by PIN-binding, a15N-labeled PINB sample (≈1.0 mm) was titrated with an unlabeled PIN stock solution (≈2.0 mmconcentration) at a 0.1 molar ratio interval. A1H-15N-HSQC spectrum was recorded at each titration point to monitor spectral changes exclusively originated from PINB during the titration. The conformational changes of PIN resulting from PINB (or the 18-residue synthetic peptide) binding were studied by titrating 15N-labeled PIN (≈1.5 mmconcentration) with an unlabeled PINB (the nNOS peptide) stock solution (≈4 mm) in a similar manner. Various expression conditions were tested to optimize the expression of PIN. It was found that induction of PIN expression at 30 °C for a duration of approximately 8 h gave rise to the highest yield of PIN in the soluble form. Purification of PIN was relatively straightforward. Pure His-tagged PIN was obtained by using a gel filtration column following Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography. The His-tag cleaved by thrombin was removed from PIN by a cation-exchange column (data not shown). An ∼25-mg quantity of pure PIN was purified from 1 liter of LB medium. About half that quantity of PIN was obtained when the expressing strain was grown in M9 minimal medium for stable isotope labeling. The PIN samples used throughout this study contained three extra residues (G-3S-2H-1) resulting from a cloning artifact. High yield expression and successful purification of PIN has enabled detailed structural and functional studies by various biochemical and biophysical techniques. The elution profile of the gel filtration chromatography during PIN purification indicated that PIN has a molecular mass over 25 kDa, indicating that the protein is not a pure monomer in solution (data not shown). Initial NMR experiments also indicated that the line width of the protein is significantly broader than a monomeric protein with 89 amino acid residues, suggesting that the protein may form higher order aggregates at elevated concentrations (data not shown). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out to determine the self-association of PIN in different concentrations. At low protein concentrations (<0.01 mm), the data can be fitted well by treating PIN as a monomer (data not shown). However, when the protein concentration increases, fitting the data to a monomer or a dimer gives poor fits with large nonrandom residuals. Rather, the data for PIN at 0.03 mm or higher fit best to a monomer-trimer equilibrium. Fig. 1 shows the representative fitting result of a sedimentation experiment at an initial PIN concentration of 0.05 mm using a monomer-trimer equilibrium model. The result strongly indicates that PIN exists as a monomer-trimer equilibrium at high concentrations. The monomer-trimer equilibrium of PIN suggested by hydrodynamic studies was further confirmed by chemical cross-linking studies. An amine-selective chemical cross-linking reagent, DSG (with a linking spacer length of 7.7 Å), was used to probe the formation of higher order structure of PIN. As shown in Fig.2 A, a sharp band with a molecular weight of ≈27 kDa can be observed in the DSG-treated protein sample. This 27-kDa band protein presumably represents the cross-linked trimer of PIN as the monomeric PIN migrates at ≈9 kDa. We have also used another amine-selective cross-linker, DFDNB, to covalently link PIN. In contrast to DSG, DFDNB has a much shorter spacer arm (3 Å). Therefore, cross-linking by DFDNB requires two lysine residues of PIN to be in close proximity with each other. As expected, the DFDNB-mediated cross-linking reaction occurs more slowly than that mediated by DSG. In DFDNB-treated PIN, a 27-kDa protein band corresponding to the cross-linked trimer can be detected (Fig.2 B). In addition to this 27-kDa band, a 22-kDa band is also visible, and this 22-kDa band may represent the cross-linked dimer of the protein. The formation of cross-linked dimer by DFDNB may indicate that a pair of lysine residues from two subunits of the trimeric PIN are particularly close in space. To better understand the interaction between PIN and PINB, we set out to determine the three- dimensional structure of PINB by NMR spectroscopy. Fig. 3 A shows the1H-15N-HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled full-length PINB in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. All of the amide protons have a chemical shift dispersion within 0.7 ppm (from 7.9 to 8.7 ppm), and 15N resonances have a chemical shift distribution less than 20 ppm (108.5 to 128.5 ppm). Such narrow chemical shift dispersions (particularly the amide protons) strongly indicate that PINB is likely to adopt a random coil structure in solution. To prove that PINB indeed adopts a random coil structure in solution, we carried out backbone sequence-specific assignment of PINB by heteronuclear multi-dimensional NMR experiments. The combination of a pair of CBCA(CO)NH and HNCACB triple resonances experiments using a15N/13C-labeled PINB allowed us to obtain near complete sequence-specific backbone assignment of the protein (assignment available from the authors). The sequential assignment obtained from the triple resonance experiments was further confirmed by a pair of three-dimensional 15N-separated TOCSY and NOESY experiments recorded with a 15N-labeled PINB (data not shown). After completing the sequence-specific assignment, we analyzed the NOE connections of PINB using data obtained from the15N-separated three-dimensional NOESY experiment. No medium and long range backbone NOE connectivities were observed throughout the protein, indicating that PINB has a random coil structure in solution (data not shown). Other than the NOE connectivities, chemical shift values are particularly informative for determining secondary structures of proteins (25Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the 1Hα and 13Cαchemical shift index (CSI) values plotted as a function of amino acid residues of PINB. It is clear that no regular secondary structural elements can be observed in PINB. Taken together, both NOE connectivities and CSI data show that the 85-residue PINB adopts a random coil structure in solution. To study the interaction between PIN and PINB and conformational changes of PINB induced by PIN binding, we titrated 15N-labeled PINB with unlabeled PIN. A 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum was recorded at each titration point to selectively observe the spectral changes of PINB resulting from the PIN binding. During the titration, the intensities of a selected set of peaks gradually decrease (peaks labeled with asterisks in Fig.3 A), and a new set of resonances appear at completely different chemical shift values (the peaks highlighted with open boxes in Fig. 3 B). The newly appeared peaks presumably represent amino acid residues of PINB that are directly involved in the interaction with PIN. The titration had completed when a half-equivalent amount of PIN was added to the PINB solution, indicating that PIN binds to PINB at a 1:2 stoichiometry. The co-existence of the resonances originating from the free and PIN-bound forms of PINB during the titration demonstrates that two forms of PINB are in a slow chemical change process. Such slow chemical exchange between free PINB and PIN-bound PINB indicates that PIN binds to PINB with a high affinity (K d < 10−6m by assuming a near diffusion controlled on-rate of PINB and the nNOS peptide below). The fact that the GST-PINB/PIN complex could stand the extensive wash of the binding assay buffer also supports that PIN binds to PINB with a K d value of 10−6m or lower (Fig.5). The newly appeared peaks seen in Fig.3 B have significantly broader line widths compared with the peaks in Fig. 3 A, consistent with the fact that the PIN/PINB2 complex has a much larger molecular mass than PINB alone (28 versus 8.5 kDa). Other than the small set of peaks that disappear during the PIN titration, the rest of the resonances exhibit neither chemical shift nor intensity changes (Fig.3), indicating that only a small part of PINB is involved in PIN binding. By taking advantage of the sequence-specific assignment obtained above, we were able to locate the amino acid residues that show peak intensity and chemical shift changes during the titration. The residues that are labeled with asterisks in Fig.3 A correspond to a continuous stretch of 17 amino acid residues (Met-228 to His-244) at the very C-terminal tail of PINB, and this 17-residue peptide fragment is likely to represent the PIN-binding domain of nNOS. To confirm the result of the PIN-binding region identified from the NMR experiments, we created a series of N- and C-terminal truncation mutants of PINB in their respective GST-fusion forms (Fig. 5). These GST-fusion proteins were then assayed for their PIN-binding ability, and the result is shown in Fig. 5. It is clear from the data that the C-terminal ten residues of PINB are absolutely required for PIN-binding, as deletions of ten or more amino acid residues from the C-terminal end of PINB completely abolished its PIN-binding capability, whereas deletions up to 40 amino acid residues from the N terminus had no effect on the PIN-binding. Therefore, the PIN-binding domain of PINB is located within the C-terminal 45 amino acid residues of the protein. The result obtained from these truncation mutation studies agrees with the conclusion drawn from our earlier NMR experiments. A similar strategy was used to selectively observe conformational changes of PIN resulting from PINB binding by using unlabeled full-length PINB to titrate with 15N-labeled PIN. Fig. 6 shows representative panels of the1H-15N-HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled PIN during the titration. Similar to what was observed in the experiment described in Fig. 2, the intensities of free PIN peaks gradually decrease with the addition of increasing amounts of PINB. A new set of resonances, which correspond to the residues of PIN in the complex with PINB, were observed during the titration. This slow chemical exchange process between free PIN and PIN in the complex with PINB agrees with our earlier conclusion stating that PIN binds to PINB with a high affinity. Unlike only a small subset of the PINB peaks undergoing intensity and chemical shift changes, essentially every resonance of PIN shows peak intensity decrease during titration and eventually disappears at the end of the titration (Fig. 6). The result indicates that PIN undergoes a global conformational change upon forming the complex with PINB. At the mid-point of titration (seepanel C in Fig. 6, for example), we observed four peaks for each amino acid residue. The data indicate that PIN may contain two separate binding sites for PINB (see below for details). Extensive line-broadening during the titration using full-length PINB prevented us from a detailed analysis of the interaction between the two proteins. However, we were able to obtain a much clearer picture of the interaction by using a synthetic peptide comprising the PIN-binding region of nNOS (see Fig. 8 A, for example). When"

Mutations at positions 65, 115, 183, 184, and 219 had negligible to moderate influence on the polymerase activity, while Ala substitution at positions 72 and 151 as well as substitution with Ala or Glu at position 113 severely impaired the polymerase function of the enzyme. The K219A, Y115F, and Q151M mutants had no influence on the fidelity; Y183A, Y183F, K65A, and Q151N mutants exhibited higher fidelity on both RNA and DNA templates, while Y115A was less error-prone selectively on a DNA template. Analysis of the three-dimensional model of the enzyme-template primer-dNTP ternary complex suggests that residues Tyr-183, Lys-65, and Gln-151 may have impact on the flexibility of the dNTP-binding pocket by virtue of their multiple interactions with the dNTP, template, primer, and other neighboring residues constituting the pocket. Recruitment of the correct versus incorrect nucleotides may be a function of the flexibility of this pocket. A relatively rigid pocket would provide greater stringency, resulting in higher fidelity of DNA synthesis in contrast to a flexible pocket. Substitution of a residue having multiple interactions with a residue having reduced interaction capability will alter the internal geometry of the pocket, thus directly influencing the fidelity.

During replication of the HIV-1 genome, approximately 35 mutations per million nucleotides are generated (1Mansky L.M. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5087-5094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An awesome daily production rate of as many as 10 billion virions per body containing approximately 3 × 105 mutations can rapidly accumulate a significant number of drug-resistant variants that make chemotherapy ineffective. Dynamics of HIV-1 replication in vivo has demonstrated that, within 2–4 weeks of treatment with nucleoside analogs, the wild type virus in the plasma is completely replaced by the drug-resistant variants (2Wei X.

The single-stranded HIV-1 viral RNA genome is efficiently converted into double-stranded proviral DNA by the virally encoded reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is essential for viral replication and establishing infection. This enzyme is therefore used as a potential target for combating viral infection. However, rapid emergence of drug-resistant viral strains has so far frustrated all efforts in this direction. HIV-1 RT is a highly error-prone enzyme and the most probable source of diversity (4Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A.

Two natural mutations, M184V and E89G, which have been shown to confer resistance to dideoxynucleoside analogs, also enhance the fidelity of DNA synthesis (9Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Rege N.

A natural mutation at codon 151 (Gln → Met; Q151M) of HIV-1 RT has been shown to confer resistance to all dideoxy analogs (15Shirasaka T. Kavlick M.F. Ueno T. Gao W.Y. Kojima E. Alcaide M.L.

Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) and is probably a constituent of the dNTP-binding pocket in the enzyme-TP-dNTP ternary complex (20Sarafianos S.G. Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7207-7216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Kaushik N. Harris D. Rege N. Modak M.J. Yadav P.N.S. Pandey V.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11430-11438Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Earlier mutational studies at position 151 have proposed that besides its direct role in the formation of a dNTP-binding pocket, the side chain of Gln-151 may also help in stabilizing the side chain of Arg-72 (20Sarafianos S.G. Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7207-7216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Kaushik N. Harris D. Rege N. Modak M.J. Yadav P.N.S. Pandey V.N.

Arg-72 has been proposed to be involved in the conformational change of the enzyme-TP-dNTP ternary complex during catalysis (21Kaushik N. Harris D. Rege N. Modak M.J. Yadav P.N.S. Pandey V.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11430-11438Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Kaushik N. Rege N. Sarafianos S.G. Yadav P.N.S. Modak M.J. Pandey V.N.

A close examination of the three-dimensional molecular model structure of HIV-1 RT-DNA-dNTP ternary complex, based on the three-dimensional co-crystal structure of HIV-1 RT-DNA complex (22Kaushik N. Rege N. Sarafianos S.G. Yadav P.N.S. Modak M.J. Pandey V.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11536-11546Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), suggests that a number of amino acid residues may be involved in the formation of the dNTP-binding pocket in the ternary complex. Mutations involving the amino acid residues in the dNTP-binding pocket may, in turn, alter the size and shape of this pocket, thus resulting in an alteration of dNTP selectivity of the correct versus incorrect nucleotide during polymerization. Previous mutagenesis of residue Met-184, a constituent of the dNTP-binding pocket, has shown that changes in this residue have marked effect on the fidelity of DNA synthesis (9Pandey V.N. Kaushik N.

Substitution of Met → Ala at this position makes the enzyme highly error-prone, whereas Met → Val substitution significantly improves the nucleotide selectivity and fidelity of DNA synthesis (9Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Rege N. Sarafianos S.G. Yadav P.N.S. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2168-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In our efforts to understand the contribution of other constituents of this pocket to the fidelity of DNA replication, the mutant derivatives of Lys-65, Arg-72, Tyr-115, Gln-151, Tyr-183, Asp-113, and Lys-219 were studied for their involvement in the process of selection of the correct versus incorrect nucleotide substrates during reverse transcription. Results of these investigations are the subject matter of this report. Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were from Promega or Boehringer Mannheim; Sequenase and DNA sequencing reagents were from U. S. Biochemicals. High performance liquid chromatography-purified dNTPs were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Mutagen-M13 in vitro mutagenesis kit was purchased from Bio-Rad. Expression vector pET-28a and Escherichia coliexpression strain BL21 (DE3) were obtained from Novagen. All other reagents were of the highest available purity grade and were purchased from Fisher, Millipore Corp., Boehringer Mannheim, and Bio-Rad. Fast Flow Chelating Sepharose (iminodiacetic-Sepharose) for immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and synthetic homopolymeric template-primers were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and32P-labeled dNTPs and ATP were the products of NEN Life Science Products. Sequencing primers and oligonucleotides containing the desired mutational changes were synthesized at the Molecular Resource Facility of University of Medicine and Dentistry, New Jersey. An HIV-RNA expression clone pHIV-PBS was a generous gift from Dr. M. A. Wainberg (23Arts E.J. Li X. Gu Z. Kleiman L. Parniak M. Wainberg M.A. J. Biol.

This clone contains a 947-base pair fragment of HIV-1 genome (+473 to +1420), which supplies the RNA corresponding to the PBS region. Two recombinant plasmids, pET-28a-RT66 and pET-3a-RT51, containing p66 and p51 encoding regions, respectively, with metal binding hexahistidine (His-Tag) sequences at the NH2-terminal region were used for isolating the wild type heterodimeric HIV-1 RT (9Pandey V.N.

TheXbaI and SacI fragment (1.432 kilobase pairs) of pET-3a-RT51 encoding the polymerase domain of HIV-1 RT subcloned in bacteriophage M13mp18 was used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis. The mutagenesis protocol using uracil-containing DNA template was essentially as described by Kunkel et al. (24Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A.

The growth of E. coli BL-21 containing pET-28a-RT66 and pET-3a-RT51 clones carrying the WT or mutant subunits, and induction of the enzyme protein was carried out as described before (9Pandey V.N.

Polymerase activity of the WT and mutant enzymes was assayed on three different template-primers, poly(rA)·(dT)18, U5-PBS HIV-1 RNA, and 49-mer U5-PBS DNA templates primed with 17-mer or 18-mer PBS primer. The U5-PBS HIV-1 RNA template was transcribed from the plasmid pHIV-PBS, which contains a 947-base pair fragment of the HIV-1 genome (+473 to +1420) corresponding to the PBS region (23Arts E.J. Li X.

Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and were terminated by addition of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 5 mm inorganic pyrophosphate. Samples were filtered on Whatman GF/B filters. The filters were dried and counted for radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter. For the gel analysis of products, reactions were carried out in a total volume of 6 μl under similar conditions except that 5′-32P-labeled primer/template (15,000 counts/min/assay) was used instead of32P-labeled dNTP, and terminated by the addition of 6 μl of Sanger's gel loading dye (29Sanger F.

The terminated reactions were heated to 90 °C for 5 min, and the products were resolved on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide (7m urea, 1× TBE) sequencing gel. RNase H activity of the WT and mutant HIV-1 RT was determined using a 5′-32P-labeled 30-mer RNA hybridized to a complimentary 30-mer DNA to generate the duplex hybrid (30Lee R. Kaushik N. Modak M.J.

The U5-PBS RNA template primed with 32P-labeled 17-mer DNA primer as well as 49-mer U5-PBS DNA primed with 32P-labeled 19-mer DNA primer was used as the RNA-DNA and DNA-DNA TP, respectively. In each case, the enzyme was pre-incubated with the labeled TP and reactions were initiated by the addition of Mg·rNTP (500 μm) or Mg·dNTP (200 μm) complex. The reactions were carried out in a total volume of 8 μl for 10 min at 25 °C and terminated by the addition of equal volume of Sanger's gel loading dye. The samples were then heated at 90 °C for 5 min and the products were resolved by denaturing 8% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel electrophoresis. In these assays, the U5-PBS RNA and 49-mer U5-PBS DNA templates primed with 5′-32P-labeled 17-mer DNA were used as template primers. The gel-purified 5′-32P-labeled 17-mer PBS primer was annealed with a 2-fold excess of RNA or DNA template by heating the TP mixture to 65 °C and cooling to 30 °C at the rate of 1 °C/min. The [dNTP] was kept at 200 μm for the correct nucleotide and 500 μm for the incorrect nucleotides. The enzymes were pre-incubated with the labeled TP, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of a single Mg·dNTP. The reactions were carried out in a total volume of 8 μl for 30 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of equal volume of Sanger's gel loading dye. The reaction products were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fifteen site-directed mutants of amino acid residues at positions 65, 72, 113, 115, 151, 183, 184, and 219 in the polymerase domain of HIV-1 RT were constructed and expressed in E. coli as described previously (9Pandey V.N.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11536-11546Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the three-dimensional co-crystal structure of HIV-1 RT-DNA complex, residues Asp-113, Tyr-115, Tyr-183, Met-184, and Lys-219 are located on the palm subdomain, Lys-65 and Arg-72 on the finger subdomain, and Gln-151 at the junction of finger and palm subdomain in the polymerase cleft; all these residues are constituents of the putative dNTP-binding pocket. The functional side chains of these residues were replaced with either alanine or substituted by a residue with a similar geometry, hydrophobicity, or charge. The homodimeric form (p66/66) of the enzyme was used throughout these studies since the kinetic parameters of both the heterodimeric (p66/p51) and homodimeric enzymes have been shown to be similar (32Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9745-9753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme preparations were found to be homogeneous with purity greater than 95%. The levels of their expressions, solubility, and yield, as well as their chromatographic characteristics, were identical with that of the wild type enzyme, suggesting that substitutions at the site of mutation did not cause any significant perturbation in the enzyme structure. All the mutants were RNase H-positive and showed a heat inactivation pattern identical to the wild type HIV-1 RT (results not shown), thus providing additional evidence that these mutations did not significantly alter the folded structure of the enzyme protein. The RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of the mutant enzymes was assessed using the homopolymeric poly(rA)·(dT)18 and the heteropolymeric U5-PBS RNA templates primed with complementary 18-mer PBS-DNA primer. The DNA template-dependent primer extension reaction was monitored by using the 49-mer U5-PBS DNA template primed with the PBS primer (Table I). As shown in Fig.1 A, polymerase activity of Y115F, Q151M, Q151N, M184A, M184V, K219A, and K219R mutants remained more or less unaffected on both homopolymeric and heteropolymeric RNA templates while drastic to moderate reduction was observed with K65A, R72A, D113A, D113E, Q151A, Y183A, and Y183F mutants. Similar results were obtained on a DNA template with all mutants except Y183A, which exhibited approximately 28% of the wild type activity on a DNA template but was inactive on RNA template (TableII; Fig. 1 A). The primer extension reaction catalyzed by the mutant derivatives of Asp-113 (D113E, D113A) was severely impaired on both RNA and DNA templates. The results obtained with Asp-113 are at great variance with earlier reports, where conservative and nonconservative substitutions at position 113 were shown to retain 60–80% of the wild type activity (33Larder B.A. Kemp S.D. Purifoy D.J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4803-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 34Boyer P.L. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Whitmer J. Frank P. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 472-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These authors, however, assayed the mutant enzymes in the crude bacterial extracts using poly(rA)·(dT) as the template primer, which is also efficiently utilized by E. coli DNA polymerase I, a possible contaminant in the preparation. Asp-113 of HIV-1 RT has been proposed to be equivalent to Glu-710 of the Klenow fragment. Substitution of Glu → Ala at position 710 of Klenow fragment results in complete loss of the enzyme activity (35Polesky A.H. Dahlberg M.E. Benkovic S.J. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8417-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results with Asp-113 mutants support the contention of its functional equivalence with Glu-710 of the Klenow fragment. Interestingly, substitution of the side chain of Lys-219 with alanine, a residue proposed to be involved in dNTP binding (14Tantillo C. Ding J. Jacobo-Molina A. Nanni R.G. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Pauwels R. Andries K. Janssen P.A.J. Arnold E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 369-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), displayed wild type DNA polymerase activity on both RNA-DNA and DNA-DNA template primers. This observation suggests that the side chain of Lys-219 may not be important for the binding of the incoming dNTPs, although this residue has been implicated in dNTP substrate recognition because Lys → Gln substitution at this position results in AZT resistance (12Larder B.A. Kemp S.D.

The values represent a percentage of the wild type enzyme activity. Values shown in the parentheses are total picomoles of acid-insoluble dNMP incorporated into the primer DNA by WT HIV-1 RT in 10 min at 37 °C. A natural mutation, K65R, was found to confer cross-resistance to 3TC, ddC, and ddI, suggesting the plausible interaction of this residue with dNTP substrate (36Gu Z. Fletcher R.S. Arts E.J. Wainberg M.A. Parniak M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28118-28122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the three-dimensional crystal structure, Lys-65 of HIV-1 RT is spatially equivalent to Arg-754 of the Klenow fragment. Substitution of Arg → Ala at position 754 of the Klenow fragment drastically reduced the affinity for dNTP substrate, resulting in severe impairment of the polymerase activity (37Kaushik N. Pandey V.N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7256-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 38Astatke M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1945-1954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The importance of Arg-754 for the catalytic function of the Klenow fragment was attributed to its coordination with the phosphoryl group of the incoming dNTP substrate (38Astatke M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1945-1954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), as has been proposed for Lys-219 of HIV-1 RT (14Tantillo C. Ding J. Jacobo-Molina A. Nanni R.G. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Pauwels R. Andries K. Janssen P.A.J. Arnold E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 369-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In contrast, the K65A mutant of HIV-1 RT displayed a moderate reduction in the enzyme activity with no significant change in the binding affinity for dNTP substrate; a K mvalue between 1.5 and 2.5 μm was obtained with both enzymes on poly(rC)·(dG)18 and poly(dC)·(dG)18 template primers. These results demonstrate that Lys-65 may not be functionally equivalent to Arg-754, reflecting some basic difference in dNTP binding properties between HIV-1 RT and E. coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment). Interestingly, the RNase H activity of all mutants was intact (data not shown), suggesting an independent function of the polymerase and RNase H domains of the enzyme. Surprisingly, mutants Q151A, R72A, D113A, D113E, and Y115A that were nearly inactive on a RNA template with Mg2+ were capable of incorporating a few nucleotides with Mn2+ as the divalent cation (Fig. 1 B).

Lipoxygenases are a family of non-heme iron-containing dioxygenases that introduce molecular oxygen stereospecifically into 1,4-cis,cis-pentadiene containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (1Nelson M.J. Seitz S.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 878-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These enzymes are distributed widely throughout the plant and animal kingdoms, including lower organisms like marine alga, slime molds, and coral (2Liu Q.Y. Reith M.E. Mol. Marine Biol. Biotechnol. 1994; 3: 206-209PubMed Google Scholar, 3Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Shieh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20949-20957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), but not in bacteria and yeast. Lipoxygenase metabolism leads to the biosynthesis of various bioactive lipid mediators, including leukotrienes, lipoxins, and plant signaling molecules like jasmonic acid (4Samuelsson B. Science. 1983; 220: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (2311) Google Scholar, 5Bell E. Creelman R.A. Mullet J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8675-8679Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). For many years the common viewpoint in the lipoxygenase field was considered to be represented by three major lipoxygenase groups in mammals designated for their positional specificity of molecular oxygen insertion onto arachidonic acid and their cell-specific expression pattern. These major lipoxygenase forms included the neutrophil 5-lipoxygenase, platelet 12-lipoxygenase, and reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase (6Funk C.D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

Several research groups found evidence for a subdivision of the 12-lipoxygenase branch into two classes: platelet-type and leukocyte-type (6Funk C.D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

Nested PCR was performed with primer set oligo(dT)-anchor primer + p10 and anchor primer + p11.Subcloning and DNA Sequence AnalysisPCR products were cloned into the TA cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), and plasmid preparations of positive clones were purified with ion-exchange resin columns (Qiagen). Plasmid DNAs were sequenced by automated DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems BigDye Terminator Ready reaction kit reagents; Applied Biosystems 373 sequencer) using the facilities of the Department of Genetics. Analysis of sequence data was performed with the Genetics Computer Group package.Generation of Expression ConstructsMouse lipoxygenase full-length cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR from newborn mouse body total RNA with a proofreading polymerase mixture (Advantage Klen-TaqI; CLONTECH). The primer set, phosphorylated primer p7 + p8 were used for PCR. The PCR products were directly cloned into PCR3.1 Uni TA cloning expression vector (Invitrogen). Large scale plasmid preparations were purified with plasmid maxiprep kits (Qiagen), and the full-length cDNA was sequenced. Human 12(R)-lipoxygenase full-length cDNA was amplified and cloned similarly from 10 μg of human B cell line (CCL-156) total RNA using primer set: phosphorylated p12 + p13. Two clones from mouse and ten clones from human were sequenced entirely on both strands. Several PCR-induced mutations could be deduced in the aligned sequences. These were corrected by ligation of various restriction fragments judged to contain the correct sequence. Full-length coding region cDNAs of human and mouse lipoxygenases were also subcloned into a green fluorescent protein fusion vector (pEGFP-C2; CLONTECH), the mammalian expression vector pCMV5 (19Andersson S.

Recombinant viruses were amplified twice more to obtain high titer stocks and were used to infect Sf9 cells for enzyme activity analysis.Enzyme Activity Assay and HPLC AnalysisAfter 3 days of infection, Sf9 cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline and sonicated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8, 0.5% Tween 20) on ice for 5 s × 3 times. HEK 293 or COS-M6 cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA and 100 μg of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and harvested 24–48 h later for enzyme activity assay or Western blot analysis. Sonicated suspension (100 μl) was incubated with 100 μm [14C]arachidonic acid or other unlabeled fatty acids at 37 °C for 30 min. Stop solution (200 μl; MeCN:MeOH:HOAc = 350:150:1) was added, and the mixture placed on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was analyzed by RP-HPLC analysis using a Hewlett-Packard 1050 system equipped with a C18 Columbus column (Phenomenex, 5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm), UV detection at 235 nm, a solvent of MeOH:H2O:HOAc (85:15:0.01), and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Collected fractions (1 min) were subjected to liquid scintillation counting. The major metabolite of arachidonic acid was analyzed further by chiral phase-HPLC using a Chiralcel OB-H column (5 μm silica, 250 × 4.6 mm) with a solvent of hexane:isopropanol:acetic acid (100:1:0.1) and flow rate of 1 ml/min and by mass spectrometry.RP-HPLC/Electrospray Mass Spectrometric Identification of ProductsAliquots of fractions collected by RP-HPLC were separated using a 1.0 mm × 15 cm Phenomenex Hypersil C18-BDS column (3 μm particle size) with an HPLC system (Applied Biosystems 140B dual syringe pump) at a flow rate of 40 μl/min with a mobile phase consisting of 70% solvent A (water with 0.005% HOAc (pH 5.7) adjusted with NH4OH) and 30% solvent B (MeCN:MeOH:HOAc, 95:5:0.005 (pH 5.7)). The eluant was monitored by a VG Quattro II mass spectrometer equipped with a co-axial electrospray probe and triple quadrupole analyzer. For the arachidonate metabolite, the multiple reaction monitoring mode was set to m/z 327 > 214, 327 > 184 (deuterated internal standard), 319 > 208, and 319 > 179. The scanning mode was set to acquire daughter ion spectra of m/z 319 fromm/z 50 to 350. Deuterated and authentic HETE standards were obtained from Cayman Chemical Co.Immunoblot AnalysisTransfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Tween 20, and sonicated with a microprobe 5 s × three times. The suspension was boiled with loading buffer for 3 min. Protein was subjected to electrophoresis in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto Hybond EC nitrocellulose and detected by a GFP monoclonal antibody (Berkeley Antibody Co.) or an anti-tetrahistidine tag antibody (catalog number 34670, Qiagen).Northern Blot Analysis15 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed in 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels and blotted onto nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A 900-bp cDNA fragment (primers p7 + p5) was labeled with [32P]dCTP using random primers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was hybridized at 68 °C using QuikHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene) for 1 h and washed with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 15 min and 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 30 min.Southern Blot AnalysisHuman genomic DNA was isolated from human blood buffy coats. 5 μg of DNA was digested with various restriction enzymes at 37 °C overnight and electrophoresed in 0.7% agarose gels, blotted onto nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with a [32P]dCTP-labeled 89-bp PCR fragment (primers p15 and p16; Table I) contained within putative exon 6 at 68 °C.In Situ HybridizationA cDNA of the novel mouse lipoxygenase (as above for Northern analysis) prepared by RT-PCR and cloned directly in pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) in both orientations allowed in vitrotranscription of 35S-labeled riboprobes of both sense and antisense from the T7 RNA polymerase promoter from linearized templates. In situ hybridization was carried out using adaptations of previously described procedures (20Hayashi M. Ninomiya Y. Parsons J. Hayashi K. Olsen B.R. Trelstad R.L. J.

Sections (8 μm) were hybridized, washed, dipped in photographic emulsion (Kodak NTB2), and exposed for 1 week before they were developed and fixed.

Genomics. 1987; 1: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), have been reported previously. The rodent parents of all hybrids except 88H5 were mouse cell lines. The rodent parent of 88H5 is hamster. An 89-bp probe (p15 + p16 primers) was PCR-amplified from the individual DNAs and electrophoresed in a 4% TBE (TBE = 45 mm Tris borate and 1 mm EDTA)-agarose gel.PAC Library Hybridization and Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization AnalysisOligonucleotides (p13 and p16; Table I) specific to the human 12(R)-lipoxygenase cDNA were hybridized to the RCPI 5 PAC library (BAC/PAC Resources, Buffalo, NY) sequentially. PACs were labeled with biotin-16 dUTP and hybridized to metaphase chromosome spreads. A digoxigenin-labeled probe for 17q-tel (Oncor) was used as control.DISCUSSIONA human 12(R)-lipoxygenase and related mouse lipoxygenase cDNA were cloned from limited sequence data in the EST data base. The predicted coding regions for these enzymes display the typical characteristics of other mammalian lipoxygenases (6Funk C.D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

The main difference for these novel lipoxygenases as compared with other sequences is the insertion of a 31-proline-rich amino acid stretch close to the N terminus. While we were completing these studies and preparing this manuscript, two independent groups reported these sequences, cloned in similar fashion from EST information and different sources of starting RNA. Krieg et al. (25Krieg P. Kinzig A. Heidt M. Marks F. Furstenberger G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1391: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) cloned the mouse sequence, while Boeglin et al. (26Boeglin W.E. Kim R.B. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6744-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) cloned the human sequence. The sequences are 86% identical at the amino acid level and are most closely related to the human 15-lipoxygenase, type 2 cloned from hair follicles, and its mouse ortholog, which encodes an 8(S)-lipoxygenase (around 50% identity) and 5-lipoxygenases of different species (about 40% identity; Fig.8). All other mammalian lipoxygenases are less than 40% related to these new sequences.Humans are now known to possess seven distinct lipoxygenase genes; five being functional (ALOX5, ALOX12,ALOX15, ALOX15B, ALOX12B)2and two being pseudogenes (ALOX12P1, ALOX12P2) (see Refs. 17Brash A.R.

Besides this newly discovered 12(R)-lipoxygenase, there is a platelet 12(S)-lipoxygenase, which is also found in epidermis (13Funk C.D. Furci L. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

An 8(R)-lipoxygenase was isolated from the coral Plexaura homomalla recently (3Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Shieh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20949-20957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of 12(R)-HETE has been detected in human psoriatic skin lesions, and its source has been debated (38Woolard P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 136: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 39Holtzman M.J. Turk J. Pentland A. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1446-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). There is now clear evidence that this product can be synthesized by a 12(R)-lipoxygenase as opposed to a cytochrome P450 route of arachidonate metabolism (26Boeglin W.E. Kim R.B. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6744-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).We are not sure why the enzyme activity in the human 12(R)-lipoxygenase baculovirus-infected insect cells was so low. Protein overexpression was reasonable as judged by Western blot analysis. In addition, enzyme activity could not be detected in several other commonly used systems which work well for the “classic” 5-, 12-, and 15-lipoxygenases (HEK 293 cells, baculovirus-infected insect cells, and vaccinia virus-infected HeLa cells). We and others have experienced much difficulty to get other members of the “epidermal-specific” enzymes (epidermal 12(S)-lipoxygenase, 8-lipoxygenase) to express well in HEK 293 cells and baculovirus-infected insect cells 3D.

We postulate that there is an epidermal-specific factor that is required to “activate” these enzymes that is not present in other types of cells. Alternatively, the epidermal lipoxygenases, including the 12(R)-lipoxygenase, may preferentially utilize an as-of-yet unidentified complex lipid substrate rather than simple polyunsaturated fatty acids (arachidonic acid, eicosatrienoic acid, or γ-linolenic acid; see Table II) or may require a post-translational modification that can only be carried out in certain epidermal cells. The low enzyme activity of the human enzyme is likely unrelated to PCR-introduced mutations in the sequence, since our sequence is identical to that of Boeglin et al. (26Boeglin W.E. Kim R.B. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6744-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The mouse enzyme, which yielded no enzyme activity under many different incubation conditions and in many expression systems, had three amino acid differences from the sequence of Krieg et al. (25Krieg P. Kinzig A. Heidt M. Marks F. Furstenberger G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1391: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These were minor changes in noncritical regions of the protein (see Fig. 2 legend) and would not be expected to affect activity to any great extent. Similarly, this group of investigators was unable to obtain active expression of their sequence.All human lipoxygenase genes to date, including the 12(R)-lipoxygenase gene, have been localized to the chromosome 17p13 region, with the exception of the 5-lipoxygenase gene, which is situated on chromosome 10 (31Funk C.D.

The present study examined the hypothesis that the yeast orthologue of MRP, Ycf1p, mediates ATP-dependent GSH transport. [3H]GSH transport was measured in vacuolar membrane vesicles isolated from a control strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (DTY165), the isogenic DTY167 strain that lacks a functional Ycf1p, and in DTY167 transformed with a 2-μm plasmid vector containing YCF1. GSH transport in control vacuolar membrane vesicles was mediated largely by an ATP-dependent, low affinity pathway (K m = 15 ± 4 mm). ATP-dependent [3H]GSH transport was cis-inhibited by substrates of the yeast Ycf1p transporter and inhibited by 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, probenecid, and sulfinpyrazone, inhibitors of MRP1 and MRP2, but was minimally affected by membrane potential or pH gradient uncouplers. In contrast, ATP-dependent GSH transport was not seen in vacuolar membrane vesicles isolated from the DTY167 yeast strain without a functional Ycf1p but was restored to near wild-type levels in the DTY167 strain transformed with YCF1 and expressing the vacuolar Ycf1p transporter. On the other hand, expression and functional activity of a bile acid transporter, Bat1p, and of the V-type ATPase were similar in all three yeast strains. These results provide direct evidence for ATP-dependent low affinity transport of GSH by the yeast Ycf1p transporter. Because of the structural and functional homology between Ycf1p and MRP1 and MRP2, these data support the hypothesis that GSH efflux from mammalian cells is mediated by these membrane proteins.

Turnover of cellular GSH is initiated by export across the plasma membrane for delivery to the catabolic ectoenzymes γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and dipeptidase (1Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5945) Google Scholar, 2Hinchman C.A. Ballatori N. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1994; 41: 387-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Intracellular GSH concentrations are normally 1–10 mm, whereas blood plasma concentrations are 1–20 μm. The mechanisms of GSH transport are not well understood, although recent studies provide some insight (3Lee T.K. Li L. Ballatori N. Yale J. Biol. Med. 1997; 70: 287-300PubMed Google Scholar, 4Li L.

Connolly G.C. Dumont M.E. Ballatori N. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). One mechanism of GSH release involves the organic anion-transporting polypeptide, Oatp1 (5Li L. Lee T.K. Meier P.J. Ballatori N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16184-16191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Li and co-workers (5Li L. Lee T.K. Meier P.J. Ballatori N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16184-16191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that Oatp1 functions as a GSH/organic solute exchanger. Cellular release of GSH down its large electrochemical gradient apparently energizes uptake of organic solutes via the Oatp1 transporter. Oatp1 is a member of a growing family of organic solute transporters whose driving force has not been identified, although the work of Li et al. (5Li L. Lee T.K. Meier P.J. Ballatori N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16184-16191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) suggests that GSH exchange may be both a common mechanism of energy coupling and a mechanism of GSH release from cells. An additional mechanism of GSH release may involve the MRP 1The abbreviations used are: MRP, multidrug resistance associated proteins; DNP-SG, S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; AMP-PNP, adenylylimidodiphosphate, MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: MRP, multidrug resistance associated proteins; DNP-SG, S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; AMP-PNP, adenylylimidodiphosphate, MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. family of membrane transporters (6Ballatori N. Rebbeor J.F. Semin. Liver Dis. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in intact cells indicate that GSH is released by ATP-dependent mechanisms, including possibly the MRP1 and MRP2 proteins; however, none of these studies have directly documented ATP-dependent GSH transport. In contrast, our recent studies in secretory vesicles isolated from thesec6–4 mutant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiaeprovide direct evidence for ATP-dependent GSH transport (7Rebbeor J.F. Connolly G.C. Dumont M.E. Ballatori N. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In these yeast secretory vesicle preparations, GSH was found to be transported largely by a low affinity, ATP-dependent process. Moreover, the kinetics of transport suggested that GSH was a substrate for Ycf1p, the yeast orthologue of mammalian MRP (7Rebbeor J.F. Connolly G.C. Dumont M.E. Ballatori N. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). InS. cerevisiae, Ycf1p is localized preferentially to the vacuolar membrane, where it functions to secrete organic anions such as glutathione S-conjugates into the vacuolar space (8Wemmie J.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Li Z.-S. Szczypka M. Lu Y.-P. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1993; 34: 239-301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the transport mechanism is not known. Once secreted into the vacuole, GSH is degraded by the vacuolar membrane-bound proteins γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and dipeptidase and the amino acids reabsorbed (12Jaspers C. Gigot D. Penninckx M. Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 703-707Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This process is analogous to that carried out by mammalian cells (2Hinchman C.A. Ballatori N. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1994; 41: 387-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 3Lee T.K. Li L. Ballatori N. Yale J. Biol. Med. 1997; 70: 287-300PubMed Google Scholar), although in mammalian cells these degradative enzymes are located on the external surface of the plasma membrane rather than in an intracellular organelle. To test directly the hypothesis that GSH is a substrate for Ycf1p, the present study measured GSH transport in vacuolar membrane vesicles isolated from the DTY165 strain of S. cerevisiae, the isogenic DTY167 strain that lacks a functional Ycf1p and in DTY167 transformed with a high copy plasmid containing YCF1. Our results provide direct evidence for ATP-dependent transport of GSH on Ycf1p, a protein that is structurally and functionally homologous to mammalian MRP1 and MRP2 (13Szczypka M.S. Wemmie J.A.

DTY167 cells were transformed with a high copy 2-μm-based pJAW50 plasmid containing a full-length YCF1(provided by W. S. Moye-Rowley, University of Iowa) according to methods described by Chen et al. (17Chen O. Yang B. Kuo T. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) and selected for tryptophan prototrophy by plating on minimal synthetic medium (0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, 2% (w/v) glucose) supplemented with amino acids, except tryptophan, and nucleosides (CLONTECH). Vacuolar membranes were prepared using methods developed and described by Walworth and Novick (18Walworth N.C. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and Roberts et al. (19Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Briefly, DTY165 and DTY167 strains were grown in 1-liter Fernbach flasks to mid-log phase growth in YPD medium at 30 °C, whereas DTY167/YCF1 transformants were grown in supplemented minimum synthetic medium (minus tryptophan) to an optical density 600 nm of 1.5. Ten minutes after adding 10 mmNaN3 and chilling cells in an ice bath, cells were decanted to preweighed tubes and centrifuged at 5000 × g in a Sorvall GSA rotor for 10 min. Cell pellets were washed with ice-cold 10 mm NaN3, pelleted as before, weighed and frozen at −80 °C in 3–5-g aliquots. Cell pellets were thawed (at room temperature) in preweighed Sorvall SA-600 rotor tubes with 25 ml of 100 mm Tris-SO4, pH 9.4, and 40 mmβ-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at room temperature, pelleted at 3,000 × g for 10 min, and resuspended in spheroplasting buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 20 mmHEPES-Tris, pH 7.5) with 10 mm NaN3, 2 mm EDTA, 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and Zymolyase 100T (1 mg/g cells). Cells were incubated with gentle shaking for 45 min at 37 °C. Spheroplasts were pelleted at 5,000 ×g for 10 min, washed with 1.0 m sorbitol, and pelleted as before, weighed (normal yield is about 9.0 g of spheroplasts), and place on ice. Spheroplast pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of ice-cold Buffer A (12% polysucrose 400, 10 mmMES/Tris, pH 6.9, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/μl leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin) and then disrupted on ice by Dounce homogenization with 20–30 strokes of prechilled pestle A. Cell debris and unbroken spheroplasts were pelleted at 5,000 × for 10 min, and the supernatant (S1) was decanted into three Sorvall TH-641 swinging bucket rotor tubes. These were carefully overlaid with 6 ml of Buffer A and then centrifuged for 30 min at 175,000 ×g. The membrane band on the top of each tube was removed, combined in a prechilled 7-ml Dounce, and homogenized with 20–30 strokes of a type A pestle. The pooled membranes were decanted to one Sorvall TH-641 rotor tube and overlaid with 6 ml of Buffer B (8% polysucrose 400, 10 mm MES/Tris, pH 6.9, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/μl leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin), and centrifuged as before. The wafer was resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold vesiculation buffer (10 mm Tris/MES, pH 6.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/μl of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin), and sequentially passed through an 18-, a 22-, and finally through a 26-gauge needle. The vacuolar membrane vesicles were then added to 24 ml of vesiculation buffer in a prechilled ultracentrifuge tube and pelleted at 53,000 × g (23,000 rpm in Sorvall T-865 ultracentrifuge rotor) for 25 min. The vacuolar membrane pellet was resuspended in vesiculation buffer and passed through an 18-, a 22-, and finally through a 26-gauge needle as before, and aliquots were stored at −80 °C. Spheroplast lysate slow-spin supernatants (S1) and vacuolar membrane vesicles (vacuole) isolated from either DTY165, DTY167, or DTY167/YCF1 cells were added to an equal volume of sample loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 6–20% (w/v) gradient gels. The separated polypeptides were electrotransferred to a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane for 2 h at 130 mA using a semi-dry transfer apparatus. The filters were blocked and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with either a 1:500 dilution of rabbit antisera raised against the yeast Ycf1p antigen (provided by W. Scott Moye-Rowley, University of Iowa), rabbit antisera against the yeast Bat1p (provided by Daniel F. Ortiz, Tufts University), or a 1:1000 dilution of mouse monoclonal antibody against the 100-kDa integral membrane subunit of the V-type ATPase localized in yeast vacuoles (Molecular Probes). Immunoreactive bands were detected by incubating washed membranes with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase enzyme (Sigma) and then visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transport was measured as uptake of radiolabeled substrate into vesicles collected by rapid filtration on Millipore 0.45-μm filter under vacuum, essentially as described previously (20Ballatori N. Mosely R.H. Boyer J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6216-6221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vacuolar membrane vesicles were thawed by immersion in a 30 °C water bath, diluted in transport buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm KCl, with an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 10 mmphosphocreatine, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and either 5 mm Na2ATP or 10 mm NaCl). Diluted vesicles were treated with 0.5 mm acivicin to inhibit resident γ-glutamyl transpeptidase enzyme and passed repeatedly through a 26-gauge needle (10 times) and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min prior to starting the transport reaction. Freshly prepared dithiothreitol was added to 5 mmin all transport solutions used to measure GSH uptake to maintain glutathione in its reduced form. Transport was started by adding 20 μl of diluted vacuolar membrane vesicles to 80 μl of incubation transport buffer (with substrate) at 4 or 30 °C for timed intervals. Transport was quenched by adding 1 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (300 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl), and vesicles were collected by applying 1 ml of quenched reaction solution to prewetted filter under vacuum and washing filter with an additional 4 ml of ice-cold stop buffer. Filters were collected, dissolved in 5 ml of Opti-Fluor (Packard Instrument Co.; Meriden, CT), and radiolabeled drug uptake quantitated by liquid scintillation measurements. Controls for nonspecific binding of drug to filters and vesicles were performed by measuring retention of radiolabeled substrate on filters in the absence of vesicles or on secretory vesicles incubated in transport buffer at 4 °C for each time point. Kinetic data from experiments measuring uptake of radiolabeled substrate in vacuolar vesicles were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear least squares regression analysis using SigmaPlot 4.16. V maxand K m values with standard errors were derived from these curves and K i values were calculated using the equation: K i = [I]/((K m (i)/K m (o)) − 1). Comparison of data measuring initial rates of uptake of [3H]GSH in the presence and absence of inhibitors and enzyme activities from Table Iwere performed by paired Student's t test and correlated top < 0.05.Table IVacuolar enzymatic activityS1Vacuoleα-MannosidaseDTY165115.1 ± 18.7597.0 ± 246.4DTY167122.9 ± 15.7604.9 ± 202.4Total ATPase activityDTY165488.7 ± 41.980.9 ± 17.7DTY167421.0 ± 57.788.0 ± 10.7ATPase activity in the presence of 5 μmbafilomycin ADTY165492.8 ± 41.751.0 ± 12.2aSignificantly different from the total ATPase activity measured in the respective yeast strains, p < 0.05, by Student's t test.DTY167415.2 ± 49.365.2 ± 12.9aSignificantly different from the total ATPase activity measured in the respective yeast strains, p < 0.05, by Student's t test.ATPase Activity in the presence of 100 μm vanadateDTY165185.8 ± 54.4aSignificantly different from the total ATPase activity measured in the respective yeast strains, p < 0.05, by Student's t test.62.5 ± 20.6DTY167131.2 ± 10.0aSignificantly different from the total ATPase activity measured in the respective yeast strains, p < 0.05, by Student's t test.74.9 ± 11.5Total α-mannosidase activity (nmol·h−1·mg protein−1) and ATPase activities (nmol·min−1·mg protein−1) were measured in the supernatant resulting from a slow speed centrifugation of the crude homogenate (S1) and in vacuolar membranes isolated from DTY165 and DTY167 yeast S. cerevisiae.

Values represent mean ± S.E. of measurements taken in 10 different preparations. The enzymatic activity of the vacuolar membrane-bound α-mannosidase (21Opheim D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 524: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and the bafilomycin A-sensitive H+-ATPase (V-type) activity were measured to determine the relative enrichment of these markers in vacuolar membranes isolated from DTY165 and DTY167 strains of S. cerevisiae. The enrichment of α-mannosidase activity in the vacuolar membrane fraction was approximately 5-fold in both yeast strains (Table I), a value that is comparable to that previously reported in these strains (25Tommasini R. Evers R. Vogt E. Mornet C. Zaman G.J.R. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. Martinoia E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6743-6748Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Total ATPase activity was higher in the spheroplast homogenates (i.e. S1 fractions) when compared with vacuolar membranes, but the relative fraction of the ATPase activity inhibited by 5 μm bafilomycin A, a specific V-type ATPase inhibitor (22Yoshimori T. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. Futai M. Tashiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17707-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Crider B.P. Xie X.S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17379-17381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was higher in the vacuolar membranes (26–37%) (Table I). On the other hand, nearly all of the vanadate-sensitive plasma membrane-associated ATPase activity (24Willsky G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3326-3332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was associated with the S1 fractions and did not copurify with the vacuolar membrane fractions of either strain (Table I). This relative enrichment of vacuolar markers is comparable to that previously reported (25Tommasini R. Evers R. Vogt E. Mornet C. Zaman G.J.R. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. Martinoia E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6743-6748Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Ycf1p was detected at ∼140 kDa with a rabbit anti-Ycf1p antisera in the S1 and vacuolar membrane fractions isolated from both the DTY165 and the DTY167/YCF1transformants, whereas no signal was detected in the DTY167 membrane fractions (Fig. 1). These observations confirm that Ycf1p is absent in vacuolar membranes isolated from the DTY167 strain (9Li Z.-S. Szczypka M. Lu Y.-P. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6509-6517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and that the DTY167/YCF1 transformants express Ycf1p that is at least partially localized to the vacuole. In contrast, Bat1p and the integral membrane subunit of the vacuolar V-type ATPase were detected in membrane fractions isolated from all three yeast strains (Fig. 1). Moreover, there was significant enrichment of all three proteins in the vacuolar fraction relative to the S1 starting material (Fig. 1), providing additional evidence for enrichment of vacuolar markers in this membrane subfraction. DNP-SG, a model substrate for Ycf1p, was accumulated by an ATP-dependent mechanism into both DTY165- and DTY167/YCF1-derived vacuolar membrane vesicles (Fig.2 A). In contrast, there was minimal ATP-dependent DNP-SG transport in DTY167-derived vesicles (Fig. 2 A), in agreement with previous findings (9Li Z.-S. Szczypka M. Lu Y.-P. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6509-6517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The residual ATP-dependent uptake of DNP-SG in DTY167-derived vesicles may be attributed to either potential-sensitive transport generated by the V-type ATPase or possibly to the presence of another ATP-dependent transport system. Of significance, both DTY165- and DTY167/YCF1-derived vacuolar membrane vesicles also accumulated 5 mm[3H]GSH in an ATP-dependent manner, whereas little GSH was taken up by the DTY167-derived vesicles (Fig.2 B). The similarity between the transport of DNP-SG and GSH in the vacuolar vesicles indicates that GSH is also a substrate for Ycf1p. GSH uptake into the vesicles was not observed when ATP was replaced with a non-hydrolyzable analogue (AMP-PNP; TableII), providing additional support for this hypothesis.Table IIEffects of inhibitors and a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue on GSH uptake in yeast vacuolar membrane vesiclesnmol·min−1·mg protein−1Control15.5 ± 2.7Gramicidin D (0.01)11.0 ± 2.3Bafilomycin A (0.001)10.6 ± 1.4DIDS (0.5)2.2 ± 0.5Probenecid (5)2.0 ± 0.8Sulfinpyrazone (5)1.5 ± 1.0Vanadate (0.1)4.6 ± 1.1AMP-PNP (5)0.4 ± 0.1ATP-dependent uptake of 5 mm [3H]GSH was measured after 1 min at 30 °C with 15 μg of DTY165-derived vacuolar membrane vesicles in the presence and absence of 5 mm MgATP, except where MgAMP-PNP was substituted for MgATP, and the difference was considered the ATP-dependent component (Control).

In contrast, initial rates of ATP-dependent uptake of 50 μm [3H]taurocholate, a substrate of yeast Bat1p (26Ortiz D.F. St. Pierre M.V. Abdulmessih A. Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15358-15365Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), were similar in vacuolar membrane vesicles isolated from the three yeast strains (Fig. 2 C), confirming the structural and functional integrity of vacuolar vesicles isolated from the strain deficient in Ycf1p (DTY167). The lesser amounts of uptake at later time points in the DTY167/YCF1 strain may represent effects of somewhat different growth conditions. The initial rates of ATP-dependent uptake of increasing extravesicular [3H]GSH concentrations were measured in both DTY165- and DTY167/YCF1-derived vacuolar membrane vesicles (Fig. 3). The results indicate the presence of both saturable and non-saturable components of ATP-dependent GSH uptake (Fig. 3). The non-saturable component was calculated by fitting a least squares linear regression analysis to the data from 18 to 56 mm, and this component of uptake was then subtracted to achieve a corrected data set (open triangles) that were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear least squares regression analysis (Fig. 3). This analysis established that the apparent K m for ATP-dependent GSH uptake was 15 ± 4 and 12 ± 3 mm for DTY165 and DTY167/YCF1, respectively. ATP-dependent GSH transport is therefore of low affinity and is similar to that which we recently measured in secretory vesicles isolated from the NY17 strain of S. cerevisiae (7Rebbeor J.F. Connolly G.C. Dumont M.E. Ballatori N. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The concentration dependence of ATP-dependent GSH uptake was also measured in DTY165- and DTY167/YCF1-derived vacuolar membrane vesicles in the presence and absence of several fixed concentrations of DNP-SG (0, 0.01, and 0.05 mm). The data demonstrated competitive inhibition of ATP-dependent GSH uptake by DNP-SG in both vacuolar membrane vesicle preparations (data not shown), with similar K i values, 28 ± 4 μm and 34 ± 9 μm, respectively. The effects of several inhibitors of Ycf1p and MRP function were tested to characterize further the GSH uptake measured in DTY165-derived vacuolar membrane vesicles (Table II). ATP-dependent uptake of GSH was nearly completely inhibited by DIDS, probenecid, sulfinpyrazone, and vanadate in DTY165-derived vesicles (Table II), consistent with the hypothesis that GSH is a substrate for Ycf1p. On the other hand, bafilomycin A, a V-type ATPase inhibitor, and gramicidin, a H+ionophore and electrical potential uncoupler, produced a relatively small inhibition of GSH transport (Table II). The present findings demonstrate that vacuolar membrane vesicles isolated from the DTY165 strain of S. cerevisiae mediate ATP-dependent transport of GSH, whereas vacuolar membrane vesicles isolated from the isogenic DTY167 strain that has a disruptedYCF1 gene lack this transport activity. DTY165-derived vacuolar membrane vesicles displayed a low affinity (K m = 15 mm) GSH transport system that required ATP hydrolysis and was competitively inhibited by DNP-SG (K i = 22 μm). These features were complemented in DTY167 cells transformed with the YCF1 gene (K m = 12 mm and a DNP-SGK i = 34 μm), indicating that Ycf1p mediates ATP-dependent GSH transport. Furthermore, DIDS, vanadate, sulfinpyrazone, and probenecid, inhibitors of both YCF1 and MRP transport (9Li Z.-S. Szczypka M. Lu Y.-P. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol.

They activate gene expression by binding to κB sites via the DNA-binding domain located within this Rel homology region. Although the regulation of Rel/NF-κB by its inhibitor IκB has been extensively studied, control of the phosphorylation state of Rel/NF-κB remains unclear. Previously, we showed that c-Rel and RelA are involved in CD28-mediated signal transduction (3Bryan R.G. Li Y. Lai J-H. Van M. Rice N.R. Rich R.R. Tan T.-H. Mol. Cell.

We also showed that c-Rel is both constitutively phosphorylated in T cells and that it is also inducibly phosphorylated following T-cell receptor plus CD28 costimulation in T cells (3Bryan R.G. Li Y. Lai J-H. Van M. Rice N.R. Rich R.R. Tan T.-H. Mol. Cell.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). To further study the signaling pathway leading to c-Rel activation, we searched for c-Rel interacting kinases or phosphatases using the yeast two-hybrid system. Here we identify the serine/threonine protein phosphatase X (PPX; also called protein phosphatase 4 (PP4)) that specifically associated with c-Rel and activated NF-κB-mediated transcription. Yeast single-copy plasmids pPC62 and pPC86 (6Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. D. Nathans; the yeast-selectable marker genes LEU2 and TRP1 were swapped between these two plasmids, resulting in a GAL4 transcriptional activation domain vector containing the LEU2 selectable marker (designated pTA), and a GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector carrying the TRP1 selectable marker (designated pDB). DNA encoding amino acids 2 to 300 of c-Rel was cloned into the GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector pDB, designated pDB-c-Rel, and used as bait to screen a human B lymphocyte cDNA library (CLONTECH). Positive yeast clones were selected by colony filter β-galactosidase assay as described (6Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), and yeast DNA was recovered from positive clones and transformed into Escherichia coli. Plasmids containing cDNA clones were identified by restriction mapping and characterized by automated DNA sequencing of both strands. Subsequent two-hybrid interaction analyses were carried out by cotransformation of plasmids containing the GAL4 DNA-binding (pDB) and transcriptional activation (pTA) domains into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. pCI-PPX was constructed by inserting human PPX cDNA into the pcDNA3 expression vector. A PCR-based procedure was employed to insert an XbaI site and a hemagglutinin (HA) tag (YPYDVPDYASL) at the 5′-end and a NotI site at the 3′-end of full-length PPX cDNA. The resulting PCR products were subcloned into the expression vector pCI-neo (Promega) between the corresponding restriction sites and designated pCIneo-HA-PPX. PPX mutants were constructed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to substitute leucine, glutamate, or lysine for the arginine at amino acid 235 in the phosphatase domain (designated PPX-RL, PPX-RE, and PPX-RK, respectively) of the pCIneo-HA-PPX construct.

Cells were plated the day before transfection at a density of 2 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish. 293T cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids as indicated without or with the pVA1 plasmid containing the adenovirus VA1 RNA gene to enhance transient protein expression as described (7Hu M.C-T. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), using the calcium phosphate precipitation protocol (Specialty Media). Cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection, and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays were performed as described previously (4Lai J-H. Horvath G. Subleski J. Bruder J. Ghosh P. Tan T-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4260-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected with the expression vectors as described above. Whole-cell lysates were prepared, immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Rel, anti-NF-κB p50, anti-RelA, or anti-c-Fos antibody, and the HA-tagged PPX or Rab8 protein was detected by Western blotting using an anti-HA mAb as described previously (7Hu M.C-T. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). A double-cycle immunoprecipitation was performed to dissociate the protein-protein complexes as described (3Bryan R.G. Li Y. Lai J-H. Van M. Rice N.R. Rich R.R. Tan T.-H. Mol. Cell.

After transfection, 293T cells were starved for 1 h at 37 °C in labeling medium (methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum), then incubated for 12 h at 37 °C in 2 ml of labeling medium containing [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Amersham) (each at 100 μCi/ml). Cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against c-Rel, NF-κB p50, RelA, or c-Fos proteins. Then, the immunoprecipitates were washed and resuspended in disruption buffer, boiled, immunoprecipitated again with an anti-HA mAb, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%) and autoradiography. The GST-c-Rel, GST-p50, GST-RelA, GST-p53, and GST-c-Jun fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and recovered on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Whole-cell lysates of HA-PPX transfected 293T cells were passed through glutathione-Sepharose columns preloaded with each of the GST fusion proteins. The columns were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the bound proteins were eluted with glutathione elution buffer. HA-PPX protein was detected by Western blotting using an anti-HA mAb. Poly(A)+ RNAs from human and mouse tissues were obtained from CLONTECH. Each sample (2 μg) was denatured and electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and then transferred to a nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 × SSPE. PPX cDNA was labeled with [32P]dCTP to a specific activity of 108dpm/μg, and the membranes were hybridized with the PPX cDNA probe at high stringency. FISH was performed as described previously (8Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). EMSA was carried out with a 32P-labeled DNA probe containing the NF-κB binding motif (the double-stranded oligonucleotides encompassing the NF-κB consensus sequence) using a GelShift assay kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify proteins that interact with c-Rel. The coding sequence of c-Rel cDNA was cloned into a modified yeast single-copy plasmid GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector pDB (Fig. 1 A). The resulting plasmid, pDB-c-Rel, was used as a bait to screen a human B cell line cDNA library. Two positive clones were isolated by a direct yeast colony filter β-galactosidase assay. These yeast single-copy vectors provide a significant advantage for recovery of specific cDNA clones after transformation into E. coli. Both positive clones encoded the protein phosphatase X (PPX; also called protein phosphatase 4 (PP4)); PPX has been previously identified, but its function remains unknown (9Brewis N.D. Street A.J. Prescott A.R. Cohen P.T.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To examine the specificity of its interactions in yeast, the coding sequence of PPX cDNA was cloned into the yeast vectors pTA and pDB, and each of the resulting plasmids was cotransformed into yeast with either the vector alone or other pDB or pTA GAL4 fusion plasmids as listed in Fig.1 B. PPX associated not only with c-Rel but also with NF-κB p50; however, no interaction was detected between this clone and either IκBα or Bcl3 (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that PPX may interact specifically with proteins of the NF-κB family and affect their functions. The human PPX cDNA described here is almost identical in sequence to that described by Brewis and Cohen (10Brewis N.D. Cohen P.T.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 231-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), with the exception of some minor nucleotide sequence discrepancies and one amino acid difference (threonine versus arginine at position 75). The amino acid sequences of human PPX and mouse PPX (GenBankTM accession numbers AF097996 and AF088911) are completely identical. Northern blot analyses revealed that the PPX transcript (∼1.6 kilobases) was expressed at various levels in all of the human and mouse tissues examined (Fig. 2). Using the FISH technique (8Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), PPX was mapped to human chromosome 16 p11.2 (Fig.3).Figure 3Chromosomal mapping of human PPX gene by FISH.

The bound proteins were eluted and immunoblotted with an anti-HA mAb. 38-kDa PPX proteins were detected in the GST-c-Rel-, GST-p50-, and GST-RelA-bound fractions, but not in the GST-p53- and GST-c-Jun bound fractions (negative controls; Fig.4 A). These results indicate that PPX specifically associates with c-Rel and other NF-κB proteinsin vitro. To determine whether interactions between PPX and c-Rel and other NF-κB proteins can occur in vivo, 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with an HA epitope-tagged PPX expression plasmid and a c-Rel, NF-κB p50, or RelA expression plasmid. As controls, 293T cells were also transfected with a c-Rel, p50, or RelA cDNA expression plasmid alone. Cell lysates from transfected cells were immunoprecipitated using antibodies against c-Rel, p50, or RelA. The immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to Western blotting using an anti-HA mAb. The results showed that HA-PPX was coimmunoprecipitated with antibodies against c-Rel, NF-κB p50, and RelA (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2, 4, and6). As negative controls, HA-PPX was not coimmunoprecipitated with c-Fos (lane 7); furthermore, c-Rel, NF-κB p50, and RelA were not coimmunoprecipitated with the HA-tagged Rab8 protein (lanes 8–10). The relative expression levels of HA-PPX (data not shown), c-Rel, p50, RelA, c-Fos, and HA-Rab8 in the transfected cells was confirmed by Western blotting with either anti-HA mAb or antibodies against c-Rel, p50, or RelA (Fig.4 B, lower panel). Furthermore, 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with an HA-PPX expression plasmid and a c-Rel, NF-κB p50, or RelA expression plasmid as described above. Their expression was studied by [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine labeling, and their interactions were analyzed by a double-immunoprecipitation procedure that eliminates most nonspecific binding (3Bryan R.G. Li Y. Lai J-H. Van M. Rice N.R. Rich R.R. Tan T.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7933-7942Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Meyer C.F. Wang X. Chang C. Templeton D. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8971-8976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 C (lanes 2, 4, and6), antibodies against c-Rel, p50, or RelA specifically immunoprecipitated these NF-κB proteins together with PPX. The coimmunoprecipitated HA-tagged PPX protein was verified by the second immunoprecipitation using anti-HA mAb. Taken together, these results indicate that PPX is able to associate with c-Rel, p50, and RelA specifically in vivo. As negative controls, HA-PPX was not coimmunoprecipitated with c-Fos (Fig. 4 C, lane 7); and c-Rel, NF-κB p50, and RelA were not coimmunoprecipitated with the HA-tagged Rab8 protein (lanes 8–10). To elucidate the underlying mechanism of PPX-c-Rel interaction, we used EMSA to examine whether overexpression of PPX could alter the DNA-binding activity of c-Rel. 293T cells were transfected with either an empty vector or a PPX expression plasmid alone or cotransfected with a c-Rel expression plasmid plus either an empty vector or a PPX expression plasmid (10 μg of each plasmid). Various amounts of nuclear extracts prepared from the transfected cells were subjected to EMSA using 32P-labeled oligonucleotides containing the NF-κB-binding sequence as a probe (Fig.5 A). As a negative control, a similar experiment was performed using a PPX mutant (PPX-RL), instead of the wild-type PPX (Fig. 5 B). We found that overexpression of PPX stimulated the DNA-binding activity of c-Rel about 4-fold (Fig.5 A), while overexpression of the PPX-RL mutant appeared to slightly decrease the DNA-binding activity of c-Rel (Fig.5 B). To determine whether PPX could stimulate NF-κB transcriptional activity in cells, PPX expression plasmid (1 μg) was cotransfected into 293T cells with the reporter construct 6tkCAT, containing two NF-κB enhancer motifs and a TK promoter to drive the CAT gene (5Meyer C.F. Wang X. Chang C. Templeton D. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8971-8976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). BLCAT2 (5Meyer C.F. Wang X. Chang C. Templeton D. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8971-8976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), an enhancerless TK-CAT reporter construct, was also used to show that PPX interacts specifically with the NF-κB enhancer. As controls, 293T cells were transfected with 6tkCAT and BLCAT2 alone. PPX activated the CAT activity of 6tkCAT in 293T cells about 5–6-fold, whereas PPX was unable to activate the CAT activity of BLCAT2 in 293T cells (Fig. 5 C). To ensure that the observed NF-κB activation was due to PPX and not other factors, three PPX mutants were constructed by substituting the arginine (Arg-235) in the phosphatase domain with leucine, glutamate, or lysine (designated PPX-RL, PPX-RE, and PPX-RK, respectively), which should abrogate PPX phosphatase activity. Cotransfection of the PPX mutant constructs with 6tkCAT in 293T cells showed that PPX-RL, PPX-RE, and PPX-RK all failed to activate NF-κB-dependent CAT activity (Fig.5 C). These results suggested that the observed stimulation of NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity requires functional PPX. Although protein phosphatase 2A shares a good deal of homology with PPX (∼66% identity); protein phosphatase 2A has been suggested to be able to inactivate IκB kinase and inhibit activation of Rel/NF-κB (11Sun S.C. Maggirwar S.B. Harhaj E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18347-18351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Chen Z. Parent L. Maniatis T.

Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). In contrast, PPX appeared to act on Rel/NF-κB proteins directly and activate Rel/NF-κB-mediated transcription in vivo. The fact that PPX stimulated the DNA-binding activity of c-Rel and activated the NF-κB enhancer activity suggests that PPX may activate NF-κB through augmentation of c-Rel activity. While IκB regulation has been well documented, this novel and intriguing regulation of Rel/NF-κB suggests that the control of Rel/NF-κB signaling pathways is far more complex than previously thought. Thus far, however, the mechanism by which PPX activates Rel/NF-κB-mediated transcription is unclear. It is still plausible that PPX may dephosphorylate and subsequently activate other c-Rel-associated transcription factors or other kinases regulating IκB (e.g. IκB kinases or MEKK1). In fact, an unidentified phosphatase has been found in the IκB kinase complex (14Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Science. 1997; 278: 860-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results identify a protein phosphatase that may be an important activator of Rel/NF-κB signaling. Further investigation of the target(s) of this dephosphorylation event is necessary to understand the mechanism governing the control of Rel/NF-κB in cell proliferation and apoptosis.

Cotransport activity was estimated in intact cells and membrane vesicles by intracellular pH and 22Na+uptake measurements, respectively; rBSC-1 protein was quantified by immunoblotting analysis and mRNA by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. As compared with incubation at pH ∼7.35, acid incubation (pH ∼7.10) up-regulated by 35–100% rBSC-1 transport activity in cells and membrane vesicles, and rBSC-1 protein and mRNA abundance. In contrast, acid incubation did not alter alkaline phosphatase and Na+/K+-ATPase enzyme activities or β-actin protein abundance. After 3 h ofin vivo chronic metabolic acidosis (CMA) rBSC-1 mRNA abundance increased in freshly harvested MTALs, which was accompanied after 1–6 days of CMA with enhanced rBSC-1 protein abundance. These results demonstrate that both in vivo and in vitro CMA stimulate rBSC-1 expression, which would contribute to the adaptive increase in MTAL absorption and urinary excretion of NH4+ in response to CMA.

Increased urinary NH4+ excretion, which augments acid excretion, has long been recognized to be quantitatively the major compensatory response of the kidney against chronic metabolic acidosis (CMA) 1The abbreviations used are: CMA, chronic metabolic acidosis; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; ANOVA, analysis of variance; BCECF-AM, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester; bp, base pair(s); cRNA, complementary RNA; cDNA, complementary DNA; HDMEM, 1:1 mixture of Ham's nutrient mixture F-12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; MTAL, medullary thick ascending limb; NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger; pHi, intracellular pH; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RNAtot, total RNA; RT, reverse transcription; TAL, thick ascending limb; TBS-T, Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20. 1The abbreviations used are: CMA, chronic metabolic acidosis; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; ANOVA, analysis of variance; BCECF-AM, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester; bp, base pair(s); cRNA, complementary RNA; cDNA, complementary DNA; HDMEM, 1:1 mixture of Ham's nutrient mixture F-12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; MTAL, medullary thick ascending limb; NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger; pHi, intracellular pH; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RNAtot, total RNA; RT, reverse transcription; TAL, thick ascending limb; TBS-T, Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20.

Stimulation of proximal tubule ammonium synthesis and secretion was first documented to account for this renal adaptation (2Knepper M.A. Packer R. Good D.W. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 179-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, it is established that most of ammonia leaving the proximal tubule is absorbed by the medullary thick ascending limb (MTAL), which causes ammonia accumulation in the medullary interstitium followed by its secretion in adjacent medullary collecting tubules and thus urinary excretion (2Knepper M.A. Packer R. Good D.W. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 179-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The role of MTAL ammonia absorption may be particularly important in states of CMA since the NH4+ amount absorbed by the loop of Henle is increased under the latter condition (3Buerkert J. Martin D. Trigg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 4Simon E. Martin D. Buerkert J. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this regard, Good (5Good D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F1345-F1353PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that rat MTALs isolated and perfused in vitro have an increased ability to absorb NH4+ in response to CMA; this adaptive response in MTAL would substantially augment NH4+ excretion during metabolic acidosis. However, the mechanisms of this MTAL adaptation are unknown. Absorption of NH4+ by the MTAL occurs by the activities of several carriers. It is now established that the luminal step of MTAL NH4+ absorption involves bumetanide-sensitive Na+-K+(NH4+)-2Cl−cotransport (6Kinne R. Kinne-Saffran E. Schütz H. Schölermann B. J. Membr.

Antibodies to BSC-1 localize the transporter protein at the apical membrane of the cortical and medullary TAL, as well as the macula densa (18Kaplan M.R. Plotkin M.D. Lee W.-S. Xu Z.-C. Lytton J.

Physiol. 1996; 271: F619-F628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter of the murine BSC-1 gene contains several consensus sites for various transcription factors, which suggests that transcription of BSC-1 is responsive to physiological stimuli (20Igarashi P.

Biol. 1997; 158: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Indeed, BSC-1 was recently shown to be up-regulated by chronic saline loading (19Ecelbarger C.A. Terris J. Hoyer J.R. Nielsen S. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F619-F628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and down-regulated by potassium depletion (22Amlal H. Wang Z. Soleimani M. J. Clin.

That BSC-1 mediates the majority of MTAL NH4+ absorption in addition to NaCl absorption suggests that BSC-1 could be regulated by acid-base status; however, this hypothesis has not yet been tested. These considerations prompted us to design the present study to assess whether acidosisper se, simulated in vitro with use of an acid medium, affects rBSC-1, the rat MTAL cotransporter (13Gamba G.

To this end we have measured the effects of a 16-h incubation of the MTAL “shake” suspension (24Attmane-Elakeb A. Sibella V. Moreau A. Vernimmen C. Feldmann G. Paillard M. Bichara M. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 439-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) in an acid-defined medium on rBSC-1 transport activity, protein, and mRNA. We have also determined the abundance in MTAL of rBSC-1 protein and mRNA after in vivo CMA. The results show for the first time that rBSC-1 expression is up-regulated by bothin vivo CMA and in vitro acid incubation. CMA was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats in two ways. In a first series, experimental rats were given 0.28m NH4Cl in distilled drinking water (8–11 mmol/day), whereas control rats from the same shipment drank distilled water for 6 days; rats were housed two or three per cage and were allowed free access to standard rat chow and drinking solution up to the time of the experiments, at which times the rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital. The latter experimental protocol has been used previously to show the adaptive increase in MTAL NH4+ absorption in response to CMA (5Good D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F1345-F1353PubMed Google Scholar). In a second series, CMA was induced by peritoneal dialysis. Rats were anesthetized for 3 h by an intramuscular injection of ketamin chlorhydrate and chlorpromazine (7 and 0.3 mg/100 g in body weight, respectively) and warmed dialysate was infused into the peritoneal cavity through an 18-gauge catheter. Control rats were dialyzed against a solution composed of 110 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 35 mm NaHCO3, and 15 g/liter glucose. Rats to be rendered acidotic were dialyzed against a solution composed of 110 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 35 mmNH4Cl, and 15 g/liter glucose. After 45 min, the dialysate was removed (95–100% of the initial volume). Rats were then allowed to have free access to a sodium-, potassium-, and chloride-deficient diet (in mg/kg of food: 53 Na+, 61 K+, and 43 Cl−) and to a drinking solution containing 60 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 27 mmKHCO3, and 2.5 g/liter glucose for control rats, or 60 mm NaCl, 87 mm KCl, 50 mmNH4Cl (1.5–2 mmol/day), and 2.5 g/liter glucose for acidotic rats (all rats were given the above control diet and drinking water for 5–7 days before peritoneal dialysis). Rats were re-anesthetized 1 or 2 days after the beginning of peritoneal dialysis for the experiments. In both series, blood was collected by aortic puncture, kidneys were rapidly removed, and “primary” suspensions of MTALs were prepared as described below. The method used to isolate MTAL fragments has been previously described in detail (25Leviel F. Borensztein P. Houillier P. Paillard M. Bichara M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have previously established by light and electron microscopy that this primary suspension was made almost exclusively of MTALs (≥95%), occasional thin limbs, and rare outer medullary collecting tubules, with no isolated cells or proximal tubules (24Attmane-Elakeb A. Sibella V. Moreau A. Vernimmen C. Feldmann G. Paillard M. Bichara M. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 439-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). All of the following steps of the preparation of the suspensions were performed under sterile conditions with use of filter-sterilized media, as described previously in detail (24Attmane-Elakeb A. Sibella V. Moreau A. Vernimmen C. Feldmann G. Paillard M. Bichara M. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 439-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In brief, the MTALs were washed three times by gentle centrifugation (230 × g for 2 min) at 37 °C in a medium composed of a 1:1 mixture of Ham's nutrient mixture F-12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HDMEM) supplemented with 5 mmheptanoic acid, 5 mml-leucine, 15 mm Hepes, 0.1 g/liter bovine serum albumin, 400 IU/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin. The MTALs of the primary suspension were divided into two equal parts, which gave the control and acid groups; the HDMEM were supplemented with 10 mmTris, 25 mm NaHCO3, pH ∼7.35 when gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 for the control group, or 7.5 mm Tris, 15 mmNaHCO3, pH ∼7.10 when gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 for the acid group (we have checked that a difference of 25 mosmol/liter with mannitol at pH 7.35 had no significant effect on rBSC-1 mRNA abundance by the method described below (quantitative reverse transcription-PCR; rBSC-1 mRNA was 1.27 ± 0.14 amol/100 ng of RNAtot in control and 1.31 ± 0.11 with additional 25 mm mannitol;n = 3 for both)). The MTALs of each group were suspended in the HDMEM at the appropriate pH in 125-ml flasks placed in a rotary (100 rpm) shaking water bath at 37 °C (hereafter referred to as shake HDMEM suspension); the shake HDMEM suspensions were gassed with a humidified 95% O2, 5% CO2 gas mixture that was filtered through 0.45-μm filter units (NalgeneTM; Nalge Co., Rochester, NY), and were so maintained for up to 16 h in the dark to protect light-sensitive components. At the end of the incubation in the HDMEM, MTALs of each group were washed three times by gentle centrifugation in one of the media listed in Table I at pH 7.4, and maintained on ice until use. Samples destined for measurement of intracellular pH (pHi) were loaded with 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM), and pHi was estimated at 37 °C as described previously in detail (25Leviel F. Borensztein P. Houillier P. Paillard M. Bichara M. J. Clin.

A membrane fraction enriched in apical membrane vesicles was prepared from the MTAL shake HDMEM suspension by a MgCl2-EGTA aggregation plus differential centrifugation method, as described previously (24Attmane-Elakeb A. Sibella V. Moreau A. Vernimmen C. Feldmann G. Paillard M. Bichara M. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 439-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and was stored at −80 °C and used within 2 weeks. Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransport activity was assessed at ambient temperature (22–25 °C), after the membrane vesicles were loaded with solution C in Table I, by a filtration technique using 0.45-μm cellulose acetate-nitrate filters (Millipore, HAWP), as described previously in detail (12Attmane-Elakeb A.

Feldmann G. Paillard M. Bichara M. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 439-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting studies, the pooled membrane pellets P2 of each group were solubilized at ambient temperature for 20 min in Laemmli medium containing (final concentrations) 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol or 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (which made no difference in the results), and 10% glycerol; the solubilized membranes were immediately used or stored at −80 °C. We have also prepared crude membranes from primary and shake suspensions for immunoblotting studies in the following way. MTALs from control and acid suspensions were homogenized in a medium composed of 125 mm sucrose, 12 mm Trizma (Tris base), pH 7.4, 0.1 mm AEBSF, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. These homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min in a Sigma 2K15 centrifuge with a 12145 rotor, and the supernatants were further centrifuged at 210,000 × g for 60 min in a Beckman L-70 Ultracentrifuge with a 70.1 TI rotor. The pelleted membranes were solubilized and stored as described above. Protein amounts were determined by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar); alkaline phosphatase activity was determined from the amount of p-nitrophenol produced after sample addition from p-nitrophenyl phosphate used as a substrate (Sigma Diagnostics, Technical Bulletin 104). Na+/K+-ATPase activity was measured at 37 °C by a radioisotopic method using [γ-32P]ATP, as described previously (12Attmane-Elakeb A. Boulanger H. Vernimmen C. Bichara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25668-25677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed with solubilized membranes (10–50 μg of protein) and prestained molecular weight markers (Sigma), on 6–8.5% polyacrylamide minigels (Mini PROTEAN II, Bio-Rad). Protein was subsequently transferred from the gels electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes (Mini Trans Blot Module, Bio-Rad). Equal loading and transfer efficiency were systematically checked by Ponceau Red staining of the nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% non fat milk powder/TBS-T (150 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 0.1% Tween 20) and exposed overnight at 4 °C to an anti-rBSC-1 polyclonal antibody (rabbit antibody directed against a C-terminal rBSC-1 fusion protein; Ref. 18Kaplan M.R. Plotkin M.D. Lee W.-S. Xu Z.-C. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 40-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and to an anti-β-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (clone AC-15, Sigma-Aldrich Fine Chemicals) diluted 1:500 and 1:100,000, respectively, in 5% nonfat milk powder/TBS-T. Anti-rBSC-1 polyclonal antibody was affinity-purified as described (27Xu J.Z. Hall A.E. Peterson L.N. Bienkowski M.J. Eesalu T.E. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F739-F748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were then exposed to the second antibodies (peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit Ig and anti-mouse Ig; Bio-Rad) for 1.5 h at ambient temperature. After washing in TBS-T, antigen-antibody complexes were detected by autoradiography using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Western blotting Analysis System, Amersham Life Science). The autoradiography was digitized with use of a laser scanner (ScanJet IIcx, Hewlett-Packard), and quantification of each band was performed by densitometry with use of the public domain NIH Image 1.52 software 2The public domain NIH Image program was developed at the United States National Institutes of Health and is available via the World Wide Web (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image). ; for one experiment, rBSC-1 and β-actin proteins of control and acid groups were quantified in duplicate and the densitometry values were normalized so that the mean value of the control group was 100 arbitrary units to facilitate comparisons. For immunoabsorption studies, the affinity-purified anti-rBSC-1 antibody was incubated with the fusion protein for 3 h at room temperature. An example of rBSC-1 and β-actin protein detection is illustrated in Fig. 1. In some membrane preparations, a high molecular weight band was observed at the top of the gel in addition to the expected rBSC-1 band of ∼150 kDa (18Kaplan M.R. Plotkin M.D. Lee W.-S. Xu Z.-C. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 40-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar); the high molecular weight band was likely composed of rBSC-1 protein aggregates, since it was not always observed and reactivity was abolished by pre-adsorption of the antibody with rBSC-1 fusion protein. Indeed, control experiments with affinity-purified anti-rBSC-1 antibody pre-adsorbed with fusion protein gave no labeling for both the ∼150-kDa and high molecular weight bands (Fig. 1); the rBSC-1 bands were also not observed with the pre-immune rabbit serum (not shown). β-Actin protein was visible as a ∼42-kDa band (Fig.1). MTAL total RNA (RNAtot) was extracted from aliquots of primary and shake suspensions by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). To obtain a competitor RNA (cRNA) that differed from the wild rBSC-1 mRNA by a 116-base deletion of the latter, the 5′ end of the rBSC-1 cDNA (bp 1–575) was inserted between theApaI and SalI restriction enzymes sites of the Multicloning Site of pBluescript® SK+ (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) and subcloned with use of DM1TM competent cells (Life Technologies Inc.) to select an unmethylated plasmid, hereafter referred to as the 5′ rBSC-1 cDNA plasmid. A 116-bp deletion (bp 393–509 of the rBSC-1 sequence) of the 5′ rBSC-1 cDNA plasmid was obtained by digestion with StuI and MscI restriction enzymes, followed by self-ligation of the cut plasmid. The deleted 5′ rBSC-1 cDNA plasmid was subcloned, linearized withKpnI restriction enzyme, and 3′ blunt-ended with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. In vitrotranscription was then performed with use of T3 RNA polymerase (mCAPTM RNA capping kit; Stratagene) and [32P]UTP. The amount of transcribed cRNA was determined by the measure of its optical density at 260 nm corrected for the ratio of trichloroacetic acid-precipitated cRNA to total cRNA determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. The primers (Genset) for cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification were chosen from the published rBSC-1 sequence (GenBank accession no.U10097) with the help of Oligo® 4.04 primer analysis software (National Biosciences Inc., Plymouth, MN). The sequences of the primers were: 5′-CCA AAA CCA AGT GCT CGG TAT T-3′ (sense; bases 107–128) and 5′-GGT GTT GCG GTA GTA CTC AAT C-3′ (antisense; bases 536–557). These primers yielded, as expected, only one PCR product of 451 bp from MTAL RNAtot or the undeleted 5′ rBSC-1 cDNA plasmid, and of 335 bp from the cRNA or the deleted 5′ rBSC-1 cDNA plasmid, respectively; after 30 PCR cycles, PCR products resulting from nonspecific hybridization were never observed. The identities of the PCR products were confirmed after digestion by the restriction enzymeHincII by PAGE, followed by Southern blot analysis with a rBSC-1-specific 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe; the sequence of this probe was 5′-CAC CAA CCA CTG TAA AAT AGG T-3′ (bases 172–193). cDNAs were synthesized from MTAL RNAtot and cRNA by reverse transcription (RT) at 37 °C for 60 min with 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies Inc.), 20 pmol of antisense primer, 4 μg of yeast transfer RNA, 2.5 mm of each deoxyribonucleotide (dNTP), 10 mmdithiothreitol, 2 units of ribonuclease inhibitor, and 4.4 μl of 5× RT buffer in a final volume of 22 μl. Reverse transcriptase was then inactivated at 95 °C for 5 min. Each reaction was performed in parallel with an otherwise identical one that contained no reverse transcriptase. For PCR, 10 μl of the cDNA solution were supplemented with 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer, 5.6 mm MgCl2, 40 pmol of sense and antisense primers, 0.5 mm of each dNTP, and 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies Inc.) in a final volume of 50 μl. Samples were overlaid with mineral oil and denatured at 95 °C for 4 min, which was followed by cycles consisting of denaturation at 95 °C (1 min), annealing at 58 °C (1 min), and extension at 72 °C (1.5 min); PCR was completed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. Quantitative PCR was performed using 24 cycles of amplification of cDNAs simultaneously obtained from a fixed amount of MTAL RNAtot (10–150 ng, as appropriate) and 0.27–2 amol of cRNA. We have established these PCR conditions in preliminary experiments to prevent heteroduplexes of PCR amplicons from occurring (heteroduplexes were apparent with ≥28 cycles under otherwise identical conditions). The PCR amplicons were resolved by PAGE and stained with ethidium bromide for 45 min at ambient temperature. A photograph of the gel was digitized using the laser scanner, and quantification of the bands was performed by densitometry with use of the NIH Image 1.52 software. To correct for differences in molecular weight, the densitometry values of the competitive DNA bands were multiplied by the 451/335 bp ratio. We have checked that the amplification efficiencies of the wild and competitive cDNA were identical with up to 27 PCR cycles (0.35 ± 0.04 versus0.38 ± 0.05 per cycle, n = 6 for both) and thus that no further correction was needed, and that the amounts of amplicons obtained after 24 PCR cycles were well within the exponential phase of amplification. The rBSC-1 mRNA abundance was calculated from the linear log-log scale plot of the ratio of the fluorescence intensities of cRNA to MTAL RNAtot PCR products against the known amount of cRNA added in each reaction tube; r values for these linear plots were all >0.99 (see Fig. 7 below). Results are expressed in attomoles of rBSC-1 mRNA/100 ng of RNAtot. Carrier-free 22NaCl, [γ-32P]ATP, and [32P]UTP were obtained from Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK; guanidium thiocyanate, phenol,Taq DNA polymerase, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and restriction enzymes were from Life Technologies, Inc.; dNTP and yeast transfer RNA were from Stratagene. Collagenase CH grade II was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim S.A., Maylan, France; BCECF-AM was from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR;d(−)-mannitol was from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany. AEBSF, leupeptin, amiloride, bumetanide, EGTA, Tris-ATP, and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-chimie S.A.R.L., LaVerpillière, France. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance between experimental groups was assessed by Student's paired or unpaired t test or by one-way ANOVA completed by a t test using the within-groups residual variance of ANOVA, as appropriate. We have previously established that MTALs from shake suspensions were viable and retained, as assessed by electron microscopy examination, their normal tubular structure with only slight ultrastructural changes compared with MTALs from the primary suspension (24Attmane-Elakeb A.

https://openalex.org/W2072086461,"Thrombomodulin (TM), a cell surface glycoprotein, is a critical mediator of endothelial anticoagulant defenses occurring both as a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (β-TM) and a protein (α-TM) unsubstituted by chondroitin sulfate (CS), hence its description as a “part-time” proteoglycan (PG) (Fransson, L.

Based on structural analysis by a combination of sequential exoglycosidase digestion and 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy of the 2AB-oligosaccharide, the structure of the oligosaccharide was elucidated as GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl, which turned out to represent a glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-protein linkage region tetrasaccharide common to various PGs and was considered to be a biosynthetic intermediate of an immature GAG chain. The results may indicate that at least one class of the so-called part-time PGs bear the linkage tetrasaccharide at the GAG attachment sites and that the critical determining step or the rate-limiting step for PG biosynthesis is the transfer of the fifth sugar residue, the first hexosamine, rather than xylose.

J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Dittman W.A. Majerus P.W. Blood. 1990; 75: 329-336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies on the anticoagulant effects of TM demonstrated that it has cofactor activity for thrombin-dependent activation of protein C, direct inhibition of fibrinogen cleavage by thrombin, and indirect enhancement of the association of antithrombin III with thrombin. Although TM is a single polypeptide, it occurs naturally in two major glycoforms, one with (β-TM) and the other without (α-TM) a chondroitin sulfate (CS) chain (3Bourin M.-C. Boffa M.-C. Björk I. Lindahl U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5924-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 4Lin J.-H. McLean K. Morser J. Young T.A. Wydro R.M. Andrews W.H. Light D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25021-25030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and hence has been termed “part-time” PG (5Fransson L.Å. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 406-411Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Comparative studies on the anticoagulant effects of α-TM and β-TM revealed that the CS chain of TM plays an important role in regulating the anticoagulation functions. Indeed, the acceleration of the thrombin inhibition by antithrombin III is dependent on the presence of the CS moiety on TM. This moiety is not essential for protein C activation or enhanced inhibition by protein C inhibitor, but alters thrombin conformation (6Ye J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2373-2379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), changes several kinetic parameters of protein C activation, and further enhances thrombin inhibition by the protein C inhibitor. On the other hand, platelet factor 4, which prevents complex formation between heparin and antithrombin III and thus functions as a procoagulant, binds to β-TM but not to α-TM, thereby promoting the generation of activated protein C (7Dudek A.Z. Pennell C.A. Decker T.D. Young T.A. Key N.S. Slungaard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31785-31792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The CS moiety of TM also acts as the endothelial receptor for Plasmodium falciparum that infects red blood cells (8Gysin J. Pouvelle B. Tonquèze M.L. Edelman L. Boffa M.-C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 88: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The importance of the CS moiety of TM in such a variety of biological processes makes it imperative that we understand how the addition of the CS moiety is controlled. Sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) including CS, dermatan sulfate, and heparin/heparan sulfate, are covalently bound to Ser residues in the core proteins through the common carbohydrate-protein linkage structure, GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser. The biosynthesis of these GAGs is initiated by the addition of Xyl to specific Ser residues in the core protein and is followed by the addition of two Gal residues, a GlcA residue, and then alternating addition of N-acetylhexosamine and GlcA residues. The addition of each sugar is thought to be catalyzed by a specific glycosyltransferase, which uses the corresponding uridine diphosphate sugar as a donor substrate. It has been proposed that an acceptor consensus sequence for xylosyltransferase recognition exists around the serine residues substituted by GAGs (9Rodén L. Koerner T. Olson C. Schwartz N.B. Fed. Proc. Fed. Am. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1985; 44: 373-380Google Scholar, 10Bourdon M.A. Krusius T. Campbell S. Schwartz N.B. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3194-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Mann et al.(11Mann D.M. Yamaguchi Y. Bourdon M.A. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the amino acids surrounding the serine residue generate a conformation whereby the GAG attachment site is bound poorly by xylosyltransferase, and consequently some molecules are substituted and others unsubstituted with GAG, resulting in a “part-time” PG. In addition, Lin et al. (4Lin J.-H. McLean K. Morser J. Young T.A. Wydro R.M. Andrews W.H. Light D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25021-25030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that the conformation well beyond the immediate site of GAG addition plays an important role in GAG attachment. Alternatively, another hypothesis for the formation of part-time PG involves competition for a serine residue between xylosyltransferase and N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (12Gerlitz B. Hassell T.

However, neither model satisfactorily explains the biosynthetic mechanism of part-time PG. We recently identified a novel α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase in fetal bovine serum, and also in mouse mastocytoma cells, which catalyzes the transfer of an α-GalNAc residue to the linkage tetrasaccharide-serine, GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-1-O-Ser, derived from PGs, although its role in GAG biosynthesis remains unclear (13Kitagawa H.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9154-9163Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) reported that the α-GalNAc-capped pentasaccharide sequence bound to an artificial primer was secreted by human melanoma cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and several other human cancer cell lines when carbohydrate synthesis was stimulated using a primer 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-xyloside. More recently, we found that the α-GalNAc-capped pentasaccharide serine GalNAcα1–4GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl1-O-Ser, a reaction product of the α-GalNAc transferase, was not utilized as an acceptor for a glucuronyltransferase involved in CS biosynthesis (16Kitagawa H. Ujikawa M. Tsutsumi K. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, we anticipated that the addition of an α-GalNAc residue to the tetrasaccharide core of the linkage region might serve as a stop signal that precluded further chain elongation, creating a part-time PG, and hence attempted to detect the α-GalNAc-capped pentasaccharide linkage structure GalNAcα1–4GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl on part-time PGs. In the present study, we isolated and characterized theO-linked oligosaccharides on recombinant human α-TM. Structural analysis unexpectedly revealed the occurrence of an immature truncated GAG sequence GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl on the α-TM (47.Nadanaka, S., Kitagawa, H., and Sugahara, K. (1998) Abstracts of XVIth Meeting of the Federation of the European Connective Tissue Societies, August 1–6, 1998, Uppsala, Sweden, Abstr. A45.Google Scholar). The findings suggest that the critical determining step for PG biosynthesis is the transfer of the fifth sugar residue, the first hexosamine, rather than xylose. Two forms of recombinant soluble human TM with or without GAG modification were expressed in CHO-K1 cells using the expression vector pRS7TM-neo, which contained the DNA fragment encoding soluble TM (Ala1–Ala491) (17Nawa K.

ΔHexAα1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl was isolated by HPLC after chondroitinase AC-II digestion of ΔHexAα1–3GalNAcβ1–4GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl. α-TM (600 μg, equivalent to 9.2 nmol) was hydrolyzed in 4 n HCl, 4 mtrifluoroacetic acid (1/1, v/v) at 100 °C for 4 h,N-acetylated, and then pyridylaminated (20Hase S. Ikenaka T. Matsushima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 85: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The resulting pyridylaminated monosaccharides were identified and quantified by HPLC analysis on a PALPAK Type A column (Takara Shuzo Co., Kyoto, Japan). Elution was performed under isocratic conditions using acetonitrile, 0.7 m sodium borate (pH 9.0) (1/9, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min at 65 °C. Eluates were monitored by fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 310 nm and an emission wavelength of 380 nm. Similar analysis was carried out using an Ultrasphere ODS column (4.6 × 250 mm; Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) instead of a PALPAK Type A column, and similar results were obtained from both analyses. α-TM was dissolved in 0.5 m LiOH and kept at 4 °C for 16 h to release O-linked saccharides from the core protein (19Heinegård D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 285: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After neutralization, the sample was applied to a column (2.5 ml bed volume) of AG 50W-X2 (H+ form, Bio-Rad). The flow-through fraction containing the O-linked oligosaccharide components was pooled and neutralized with 1m NH4HCO3. Derivatization with 2AB of the oligosaccharide component of α-TM was performed as described (21Bigge J.C. Patel T.P. Bruce J.A. Goulding P.N. Charles S.M. Parekh R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 230: 616-626Crossref Scopus (728) Google Scholar). The isolated oligosaccharide fraction (0.6 nmol) was lyophilized in a microcentrifuge tube. A 5-μl aliquot each of 0.25 m 2AB and 1.0 m NaCNBH3, both of which were prepared by dissolving in a glacial acetic acid/Me2SO mixture (3/7, v/v), were added to the sample, and the mixture was incubated at 65 °C for 2 h. The excess reagent was removed by gel-filtration HPLC on a TSK-gel G2500PW column (Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan) using 20 mm CH3COONH4 (pH 7.5) as eluent at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Eluates were monitored by fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 330 nm and an emission wavelength of 420 nm. The 2AB-derivatized oligosaccharide fraction (fraction 1, see Fig. 2) was pooled, evaporated to dryness, and used for the structural analysis described below. Enzymatic digestion with chondroitinases ABC or AC-II was carried out using 23 pmol of the 2AB-derivatized oligosaccharide (fraction 1) and 10 mIU of the enzyme in a total volume of 30 μl of appropriate buffer at 37 °C for 20 min according to Sugahara et al. (22Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For successive enzymatic digestion, the 2AB-oligosaccharide (50 pmol) was first incubated with 10 mIU of β-glucuronidase in a total volume of 50 μl of 0.05 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.5, at 37 °C for 10 min as described (23Sugahara K. Yamada S. Sugiura M. Takeda K. Yuen R. Khoo H.E. Poh C.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), then boiled at 100 °C for 1 min to terminate the reaction. One half of the sample was analyzed by HPLC, while the other half was mixed with 1.70 IU of β-galactosidase in 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 4 mmMgCl2 and 0.25 m 2-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C for 16 h (24Sugahara K. Mizuno N. Okumura Y. Kawasaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The 2AB-oligosaccharide (fraction 1) and its digests with β-glucuronidase or β-galactosidase were analyzed in an HPLC system LC10A connected to an RF-535 fluorometric detector (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan) by two methods. Anion-exchange chromatographies were performed on a polyamine-bound silica PA03 column (4.6 × 250 mm, YMC Co., Kyoto, Japan) using a linear gradient from 16 to 530 mm NaH2PO4 over a 60-min period at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at room temperature. Gel filtration chromatographies were performed on a column (7.6 × 500 mm) of Asahipak GS-320 (Asahi Chemical Industry, Kawasaki, Japan) using 50 mm CH3COONH4 as eluent at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. In both analyses, eluates were monitored by fluorescence as described above. The 2AB-oligosaccharide (fraction 1) was repeatedly exchanged in D2O with intermediate lyophilization. The 1H NMR spectra was measured in a Varian VXR-500 using a nanoprobe at 26 °C. Chemical shifts were given relative to sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate but were actually measured indirectly relative to acetone (δ 2.225) in D2O (25Vliegenthart J.F.G. Dorland L. van Halbeek H. Adv. Carbohyr. Chem. Biochem. 1983; 41: 209-374Crossref Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The purified α-TM gave a single but slightly diffuse band of M r65,000–67,000 on SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions (Fig.1). The apparentM r of α-TM was slightly reduced afterN-glycosidase treatment or successive treatment with neuraminidase then O-glycosidase (data not shown). These results most likely indicate that α-TM has been modified withN- and O-linked sugar substituents. To analyze the carbohydrate composition, purified α-TM was subjected to acid hydrolysis followed by N-acetylation and then pyridylaminated (20Hase S. Ikenaka T. Matsushima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 85: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The resulting pyridylaminated sugars were identified and quantified using a PALPAK Type A column or a Ultrasphere ODS column. The results revealed that α-TM contained GalNAc, GlcNAc, Glc, Man, Fuc, Gal, and notably Xyl in a molar ratio of 2:5:0.75:3:1:6:1 (Table I). In the case of uronic acids as carbohydrate constituents, complete liberation is rarely possible without accompanying decomposition. When the reaction condition (4 n HCl, 4 n trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 4 h) was used for hydrolysis, destructive decarboxylation of uronic acid must have occurred (26Aspinall G.O. The Polysaccharides. 1. Academic Press, New York1982: 37Google Scholar). Thus, GlcA was not observed in this analysis even through α-TM contained GlcA as will be described below.Table ICarbohydrate composition of α-thrombomodulinComponentMolar ratioGalNAc2.0Xyl1.0GlcNAc5.0Glc0.75Man3.0Fuc1.0Gal6.0Data are expressed as molar ratios relative to α-thrombomodulin core protein (65 kDa). Open table in a new tab Data are expressed as molar ratios relative to α-thrombomodulin core protein (65 kDa). O-Glycosidically-linked oligosaccharides were liberated from the purified α-TM by mild alkaline treatment and purified by passage through a cation-exchange column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The isolated oligosaccharide fraction was derivatized with a fluorophore 2AB and fractionated by gel filtration HPLC, resulting in two fluorescent components, a 2AB-oligosaccharide (fraction 1) and a putative Glc-2AB (fraction 2) (Fig. 2). The latter peak was co-eluted with the authentic Glc-2AB when they were co-injected (data not shown). The 2AB-derivatized oligosaccharide was analyzed below, whereas the putative Glc-2AB was not analyzed further. Although α-TM seemed to contain O-glycosidase-sensitive oligosaccharides as revealed by the detection of GalNAc by the preliminary sugar composition analysis, O-linked oligosaccharides with a GalNAc residue at the reducing terminus were not detected. However, when 3H-labeled O-linked oligosaccharides released from α-TM by alkaline β-elimination with NaB3H4 were fractionated by HPLC and used for the structural analysis, 3H-labeled galactosaminitol as well as 3H-labeled xylitol were detected indeed by acid hydrolysis of the fractions (data not shown). Therefore,O-linked oligosaccharides with a GalNAc residue at the reducing terminus were actually contained in α-TM but not released by mild alkaline treatment used prior to 2AB-derivatization in the present study. Fraction 1 was subjected to HPLC on an amine-bound silica PA03 column. Only one peak was detected at the elution position of the authentic unsaturated linkage tetrasaccharide ΔHexAα1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-2AB (Fig.3 A), and the molar ratio of the oligosaccharide to the core protein was calculated to be in the range of 0.77–1.33 based on the peak area on HPLC. The peak was shifted to a position corresponding to Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-2AB by β-glucuronidase digestion (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, the peak was not shifted by digestion with chondroitinases ABC or AC-II (data not shown), demonstrating no repeating disaccharide unit. It was not sensitive to neuraminidase or α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase either, indicating that it is not covered with neuraminic acid or α-GalNAc. Fraction 1 was further analyzed by sequential enzymatic digestion using gel-filtration HPLC on a column of GS-320. One major peak was again observed at the elution position slightly ahead of the 2AB-derivatized authentic unsaturated linkage tetrasaccharide ΔHexAα1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-2AB before the enzymatic treatment (Fig. 4 A). The peaks marked by asterisks were attributable to the buffer salts. The peak was shifted to the position of Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-2AB upon β-glucuronidase digestion (Fig. 4 B) and then to the position of Xyl-2AB upon subsequent exhaustive β-galactosidase digestion (Fig. 4 C). These results altogether indicate that the structure of the compound in fraction 1 is most likely GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-2AB.Figure 4Sequential glycosidase digestions of fraction 1 isolated from α-TM. Fraction 1 isolated from α-TM (see Fig.2) was analyzed by gel-filtration HPLC on a column of GS-320 (7.6 × 500 mm), which was eluted with 50 mmCH3COONH4 at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The eluates were monitored by fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 330 nm and an emission wavelength of 420 nm.

It is acting as an activator of biosynthetic genes and a repressor of degradative genes. The DNA binding of FadR to regions within the promoters of responsive genes and operons is inhibited by long chain acyl-CoA thioesters but not free fatty acids or coenzyme A. The acyl-CoA binding domain of FadR was localized by affinity labeling of the full-length protein and an amino-terminal deletion derivative, FadRΔ1–167, with a palmitoyl-CoA analogue, 9-p-azidophenoxy[9-3H]nonanoic acid-CoA ester. Analysis of labeled peptides generated by tryptic digestion of the affinity-labeled proteins identified one peptide common to both the full-length protein and the deletion derivative. The amino-terminal sequence of the labeled peptide was SLALGFYHK, which corresponds to amino acids 187–195 in FadR. Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to estimate affinity of the wild-type full-length FadR, a His-tagged derivative, and FadRΔ1–167 for acyl-CoA. The binding was characterized by a large negative ΔH 0, −16 to −20 kcal mol−1. No binding was detected for the medium chain ligand C8-CoA. Full-length wild-type FadR and His6-FadR bound oleoyl-CoA and myristoyl-CoA with similar affinities, K d of 45 and 63 nm and 68 and 59 nm, respectively. The K d for palmitoyl-CoA binding was about 5-fold higher despite the fact that palmitoyl-CoA is 50-fold more efficient in inhibiting FadR binding to DNA than myristoyl-CoA.

These activated fatty acids are required for the biosynthesis of higher lipids, the acylation of proteins, and catabolism of fatty acids (1Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Acyl-CoA plays a critical role in mitochondrial energy metabolism and in certain pathological responses related to disease. LCACoA are important regulatory ligands for a number of enzymes including, for example, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, citrate synthase, glucokinase, the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase, and the uncoupling protein. LCACoA have also been implicated as effectors of vesicular transport and fusion. A number of studies have been directed at elucidating a role for acyl-CoA compounds in the regulation of the activity of transcription factors. However, there has been only indirect evidence that acyl-CoA compounds regulate gene activity of eucaryotes at the level of transcription (2Choi J.Y. Stukey J. Hwang S.Y. Martin C.E. J. Biol.

FadR is a 239-amino acid protein that regulates the transcription of many unlinked genes and operons encoding proteins required for fatty acid synthesis and degradation. Among the genes directly regulated by FadR are those encoding a specific membrane-associated fatty acid transport protein (FadL), acyl-CoA synthetase, all of the enzymes required for the β-oxidation of fatty acids, two enzymes essential for unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, and the repressor of the genes encoding the glyoxylate bypass genes, IclR. The effect of FadR on the level of transcription is caused by its direct binding to DNA in the promoter regions of FadR-responsive genes (5DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K. Heimert T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This binding in vitro is specifically prevented by long chain fatty acyl-CoA esters and not medium chain acyl-CoA esters or fatty acids (5DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein binds DNA as a dimer (9Raman N. Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30645-30650Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our interests lie in understanding the mechanism by which acyl-CoA controls FadR activity. Previous genetic and biochemical analyses have identified amino acid residues in the carboxyl terminus of FadR that are likely to constitute in part the acyl-CoA (CoA presumably) ligand-binding pocket (8Raman N. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1092-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Raman N. Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30645-30650Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have further localized the acyl-CoA binding domain by deletion and affinity labeling. Additionally, we have used isothermal titration microcalorimetry to assess acyl-CoA binding to the full-length protein, a His-tagged derivative and an amino-terminal deletion protein. Together these studies contribute to our understanding of FadR-DNA and FadR-acyl-CoA interactions and help to further define the region of FadR involved in forming the acyl-CoA binding pocket. E. coli strains LS1155, fadR fadB-lacZ, and LS1348, fadR fabA-lacZ, were used to assess FadR function in vivo as described previously (6DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K. Heimert T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). BL21(λDE3)/pLysS was used as host for overexpression of FadR proteins (10Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCD129 was used for the production of full-length wild-type FadR as previously detailed (5DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pCD307-6 encoding His6-FadR was constructed as follows. An NdeI site was generated at the initiating methionine codon of the wild-type FadR gene by site directed mutagenesis of pCD152 to generate pCD306-6 using the Altered Sites System of Promega as described previously (8Raman N. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1092-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). An NdeI–BamHI fragment from pCD306-6 containing the complete coding sequence of FadR was cloned into the T7 RNA polymerase-responsive expression plasmid pET15b (Novagen) such that the coding sequence of FadR was fused in frame at the amino terminus to the His tag in the vector to generate pCD307-6 encoding His6-FadR. Plasmid pCD307-3 encoding FadRΔ1–167 was constructed in a similar manner, but in this case an NcoI site was constructed in pCD152 at Met168 in wild-type FadR to generate pCD306–3. The NcoI–BamHI fragment encoding amino acid residues 168–239 was subcloned from pCD306–3 into the expression plasmid pET3a to generate pCD307–3. All constructions were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing using promoter T7- and FadR-specific oligonucleotides as primers. Wild type FadR, its truncated mutant FadRΔ1–167, and full-length soluble His6-FadR were overexpressed in E. coliBL21(λDE3)/pLysS harboring the appropriate plasmid using T7 polymerase expression system. Cultures (4 liters) were grown in an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech fermenter with automatic pH control at 37 °C in the previously described medium (11Mandrup S. Højrup P. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (15 μg/ml) untilA 600 was about 4. T7 RNA polymerase was induced by the addition of isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.4 mm. Growth continued for 3–4 h, and cells were harvested by centrifugation. For isolation of full-length, native FadR encoded within pCD129, bacterial cells were disrupted in a French press in 300 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA (TDE buffer), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 70,000 × g for 20 min. The FadR protein was subsequently recovered from inclusion bodies as follows. The pellet was dissolved in the same buffer containing 6 murea, which was then removed by dialysis against TDE buffer containing 20% (v/v) glycerol. A part of the protein that precipitated during urea removal was redissolved and redialyzed. Soluble protein in TDE buffer containing 20% (v/v) glycerol was applied to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column preequilibrated with the same buffer, and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of KCl (to 0.5 m). Fractions containing the protein of interest were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol. This was applied to an S-Sepharose high performance column, and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 1 m KCl in the same buffer at pH 6.5. FadR-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 20% (v/v) glycerol. Protein was concentrated by binding to a 5-ml Q-Sepharose High Trap column and eluting with a linear gradient of 0.4 m KCl. Final purification was achieved by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S-200 HR column developed with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 200 mm KCl containing 20% (v/v) glycerol. Protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration using a Centriprep 10 concentrator and stored at −20 °C. Protein purity and identity was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS) and N-terminal sequencing. For isolation of FadRΔ1–167 encoded in pCD307–3, bacterial cells were disrupted in a French press in 300 ml of TDE buffer, and the homogenate was separated by centrifugation as above. FadRΔ1–167 protein was recovered from inclusion bodies as follows. The pellet was dissolved in the same buffer containing 6 m urea and purified to apparent homogeneity by single step reverse-phase HPLC on a Nucleosil RP18 (230 × 150-mm) column. Prior to injection, the sample was supplemented with trifluoroacetic acid to 0.1%. The column was equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 96% ethanol containing 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid (0–100% in 50 min). Fractions containing pure protein, as evidenced by the appearance of a single protein band upon 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were freeze-dried. Lyophilized protein was redissolved in 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol and stored at −20 °C. Protein purity and identity were further confirmed by ES-MS and N-terminal sequencing. For isolation of His6-FadR encoded within pCD307-6, bacterial cells were disrupted in 200 ml of the binding buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 300 mmNaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol). Most of the target protein (∼90%) was in the soluble fraction after centrifugation. The crude protein preparation was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 15 ml of a 50% slurry of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), which had been prewashed several times with the binding buffer. The slurry was then packed into a column and subsequently washed with 20 column volumes of the binding buffer to elute unbound proteins. The target protein was then eluted with 250 mm imidazole in the binding buffer. Due to a high binding capacity of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, eluted protein was so concentrated that some precipitation occurred but disappeared upon dilution. Imidazole was removed by dialysis against the binding buffer. Protein was essentially pure (initiating Met lost) as confirmed by HPLC, ES-MS, and N-terminal sequencing. The preparation was stored at −20 degrees C. Buffer exchange for isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments was later done using a 5-ml fast desalting High Trap column. The binding of purified His6-FadR to the fadBpromoter in vitro was tested using protein-DNA gel shift assays. A 159-base pair fragment containing the fadBpromoter was amplified by thermocycling using the oligonucleotides BFW (5′-TGATTTCTGCCGAGCGTG-3′) and BRE (5′-AGTCAAGGTACAGGGTGTC-3′) as primers and pCD154 (5DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as template. Reactions were cycled 35 times at 94 °C for 1 min; 36 °C for 1 min; and 72 °C for 1 min. The fragment of interest was gel-purified and end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). Conditions for gel shifts were as described previously (5DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo activity of His6-FadR was assessed by measuring β-galactosidase activities in transformants of strain LS1155 (fadR fadB-lacZ) to test repression and LS1348 (fadR fabA-lacZ) to test activation as described (6DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K. Heimert T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The plasmids used to transform LS1155 and LS1348 to test FadR activity included pCD129, which encodes wild-type FadR under its native promoter as a positive control; pET15b, the His6 vector, a negative control; pGP1-2, which encodes T7-RNA polymerase under the control of an isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible promoter; and pCD307-6, which encodes His6-FadR under the control of a T7-RNA polymerase-responsive promoter. Oleic acid (4 mmol) was dissolved in 40 ml of dioxane, and then 4 ml of 1 m NaOH and 3.2 ml of 2% OsO4 were added. To this mixture, NaIO4(8 g) was added slowly over 5–10 min with stirring, which was continued for 18 h. The solvent was removed by evaporation, and the residue dissolved in water, made alkaline with 2 mNa2CO3, and extracted three times with petroleum spirits (40–60 °C). The aqueous phase was acidified with 4 m HCl and extracted three times with petroleum spirits (40–60 °C)/diethyl ether (1:1). The solvent was evaporated with a stream of nitrogen, and the product 9-oxononanoic acid was dissolved in petroleum spirits/diethyl ether (4:1) and purified on a silica gel column. The yield was 121 mg (21%). The 9-oxononanoic acid was dissolved in 8 ml of absolute ethanol titrated to pH 12 with 2m NaOH and reduced with NaBH4 in two steps. NaBH4 (1.9 g) was dissolved in 1 ml of absolute ethanol and mixed with 750 mCi of [3H]NaBH4 (specific activity 20–40 Ci/mmol, Amersham, UK) dissolved in 1 ml of ethanol. This solution was added slowly over 30 min to the 9-oxononanoic acid solution under continuous stirring. The stirring was continued for 90 min, an additional 5.9 mg of NaBH4 was added, and stirring continued for another 3 h. The solvent was removed with a stream of nitrogen; 10 ml of water was added; the solution was acidified with HCl; and the 9-hydroxy[9-3H]nonanoic acid was extracted with diethyl ether. The ether phase was dried over MgSO4for 6 h. The yield was 131 mg. The 9-hydroxy[9-3H]nonanoic acid was methylated with diazomethane (12Christie W.W. Lipid Analysis. 2nd Ed. Pergamon Press, New York1982: 54-55Google Scholar). The methylated product was dried carefully with benzene and dissolved in 1 ml of dry pyridine and placed on ice; 315 mg of dry tosylchloride was added, and the reaction was allowed to continue overnight with stirring. The reaction mixture was acidified with 2 ml of 1 m HCl and extracted three times with 10 ml of diethyl ether. The combined extracts were washed twice with 5 ml of 1 m HCl and dried with MgSO4; the solvent was evaporated with nitrogen; and the product was dissolved in petroleum spirit and purified on a silica gel column. The yield was 132 mg of 9-tosyl[9-3H]nonanoic acid methyl ester. All the following synthetic steps were carried out under dim light.p-Azidophenol (111 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of ethanol, 44 mg of sodium methoxide was added, and then the solvent was evaporated in a vacuum centrifuge over night. The dry residue was dissolved in 1.5 ml of dry hexamethyl formamide and added to the dried 9-tosyl[9-3H]nonanoic acid methyl ester. The reaction was allowed to run for 5 h at room temperature with stirring. The product 9-p-azidophenoxy[9-3H]nonanoic acid methyl ester was purified on a silica gel column. The fractions containing the product were pooled, and the solvent was evaporated with nitrogen. The dry residue was dissolved in 7 ml of NaOH, and the methyl ester was extracted with diethyl ether. The yield was 77 mg. The 9-p-azidophenoxy[9-3H]nonanoic acid methyl ester was dissolved in 3 ml of ethanol and hydrolyzed with 1 ml of 1m HCl for 6 h at room temperature, 2 ml of water was added, and the free acid was extracted with diethyl ether. The ether phase was dried with MgSO4, the solvent was evaporated with nitrogen, and the product was redissolved in petroleum spirits. Purity was evaluated by thin layer chromatography on silica gel 60 HP-TLC (using petroleum spirit (40–60 °C)/diethyl ether, 1:1). The specific radioactivity was determined to be 870 Ci/mol using the value of 10600 m−1 cm−1 for the molecular extinction coefficient at 257 nm. 9-p-Azidophenoxy[9-3H]nonanoyl-CoA was synthesized as described previously (13Rosendal J. Ertbjerg P. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). All experiments with light-sensitive reagents were performed in dim light. For photoaffinity labeling experiments, FadR or its truncated derivative FadRΔ1–167 was incubated for 3–5 min on ice with [9-3H]APNA-CoA (873 Ci/M) at a molar ratio of 1:1.25 in a final volume of 100 μl in TBE buffer (pH 8.0) followed by UV illumination (300 nm) for 30 s. For competition experiments, a 5-fold excess of palmitoyl-CoA over photoaffinity ligand was included in the reaction. Ten microliters of the reaction mixture were subjected to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, soaked in Amplify reagent, dried, and fluorographed. For peptide mapping, radiolabeled protein was HPLC-purified from nonreacted [9-3H]APNA-CoA on a Dynasphere column (8 × 60 mm) with a 2-propanol linear gradient. This column material was found to provide superior recovery of both protein and very hydrophobic peptides. Label incorporation efficiency was estimated to be 15%. Photoaffinity-labeled protein was dissolved in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 6 m urea and digested with trypsin (2%, w/w) after dilution to bring urea concentration to ∼0.5 m. Peptides were resolved on a Dynasphere column preequilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and developed with a linear gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid (0–70% in 40 min). Poorly resolved peaks containing most of the radioactivity were rechromatographed on the same column using a shallower gradient, and individual peptides were collected and sequenced. Calorimetric measurements were carried out using an OMEGA titration microcalorimeter from MicroCal, Inc. (Northampton, MA). This instrument has been described in detail by Wiseman et al. (14Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). The reference cell was filled with water containing 0.02% sodium azide. The calorimeter was electrically calibrated at each temperature. All solutions used for the experiments were thoroughly degassed by stirring under vacuum. If necessary, protein solutions were spun for several minutes in a bench top centrifuge to remove any visible particles. The concentration of the protein was estimated spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using ε = 33060m−1 cm−1 for FadR and His6-FadR and 12,210 m−1cm−1 for FadRΔ1–167 and was approximately 0.03 mm. Protein under study in appropriate buffer was placed in the sample cell, and a ligand (dissolved in the same buffer as the protein) was drawn into the injection syringe, which was then mounted into a stepper motor for delivery into the sample cell. The syringe with stirrer paddle was rotated at 400 rpm during the experiment to assure immediate mixing. Experiments were performed at a temperature of 27 or 31 °C. The concentration of the ligand, about 0.5 mm, was chosen to ensure full saturation well before final injection. Appropriate blank runs were conducted and subtracted from the corresponding data. The peaks of the thermograms obtained in this manner were integrated using the ORIGIN software supplied with the instrument. A nonlinear regression fitting to the isotherm was done using the CALREG (version 3.0) program (15Sigurskjold B.W. Berland C.R. Svensson B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10191-10199Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The fitting procedure yields the binding constant of the ligand K a, the heat of binding H, and the concentration of the binding sites (stoichiometry) N. Electrospray mass spectra of the proteins were recorded on a Vestec instrument (Vestec Corp., Houston, TX). Buffers and salts were removed from the purified proteins by HPLC. The sample in aqueous buffer was loaded onto a 60 × 8-mm Dynasphere column and then stepwise eluted with a mixture of 90% acetonitrile, 10% water, and 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid. The sample was dried and brought to a final concentration of ∼20 pmol/μl with methanol/water (1:1, v/v) containing 1% acetic acid. The sample was introduced into the mass spectrometer by infusion with a syringe pump with a flow rate of 0.3 μl/min. Spectra were acquired in the positive ion mode at 10 s/scan and mass window of m/z 600–1500 using Teknivent Vector 2 data system. The molecular mass of the protein was calculated by weighted averaging as described by Mann et al. (16Mann M. Meng C.K. Fenn J.B. Anal. Chem. 1989; 61: 1702-1708Crossref Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The spectrometer was independently calibrated using myoglobin. Purified proteins and radiolabeled peptides were sequenced on a Knauer 910 pulsed liquid sequencer with chemicals and program as recommended by the manufacturer. Samples of 20 μl of the amino acid phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were used for amino acid identification on a Knauer on-line HPLC 64 using a 250 × 4-mm Lichrosphere 100 C-18 (5-mm particle size) column and a gradient of acetonitrile in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2, as described by the manufacturer. All protein purification was done on an FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with columns supplied by the same manufacturer. HPLC separations were performed using the Kontron system with a gradient former equipped with a double wavelength detector (used at 216 and 280 nm). A Knauer 8 × 60-mm column was packed with Dynasphere PD-102-RE monosized particles (from Dyna Particles, Lillestrøm, Norway). Nucleosil ODS, 10-μm particle size, 30-μm pore size, was from Machery Nagel (Duren, Germany). Propan-2-ol, acetonitrile (both HPLC grade), and trifluoroacetic acid (trifluoroacetic acid, gas phase sequenator grade) were from Rathburn (Walkerburn, Scotland). l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) was from Sigma. Fluorographic reagent Amplify was from Amersham. Other reagents were obtained from commercial sources and were of reagent grade. Water was of Milli-Q quality. All acyl-CoA esters were synthesized from corresponding fatty acids as described by Sanchez et al.(17), and their purity was checked by HPLC on a Nucleosil ODS column. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, T4 DNA polymerase, and Sequenase version 2.0 were purchased from U.S. Biochemical Corp. [α-35S]dATP and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. In previous work, we identified by random and site-directed mutagenesis a region in FadR including amino acids 216–228 of the 239-amino acid protein that was specifically required for acyl-CoA binding (8Raman N. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1092-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This led us to hypothesize that the acyl-CoA binding domain was located toward the carboxyl terminus of the protein and that the acyl-CoA binding domain might be structurally and functionally separable from the amino-terminal DNA binding domain of FadR (9Raman N. Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30645-30650Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18DiRusso C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7995-8009Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, to further localize and analyze the acyl-CoA binding domain, we have constructed pCD307-3, which overexpresses a protein made up of amino acids 168–239. Amino acid 168 was chosen, since it is an internal methionine that would make a convenient site for translational initiation (18DiRusso C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7995-8009Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The protein encoded within pCD307–3, called FadRΔ1–167, has been purified to apparent homogeneity as evidenced by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ES-MS (data not shown). Dimerization of a portion of the purified FadRΔ1–167 protein was observed when the protein was analyzed by ES-MS, and dimerization could be prevented by dithiothreitol treatment. Partial N-acetylation was also suggested by ES-MS. Both full-length FadR and FadRΔ1–167 were photoaffinity labeled under identical conditions with [9-3H]APNA-CoA. [9-3H]APNA-CoA was previously shown to mimic palmitoyl-CoA in binding to acyl-CoA-binding protein, and the labeled peptides identified in that study were later shown by NMR to indeed be involved in acyl-CoA binding (19Kragelund B.B. Andersen K.V. Madsen J.C. Knudsen J. Poulsen F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1260-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In the present work, we were able to show that [9-3H]APNA-CoA can photoaffinity-label FadR, and this cross-linking was prevented by an excess of palmitoyl-CoA (Fig. 1). No labeling of the protein was detected when it was incubated with [9-3H]APNA-CoA without subsequent illumination. Similar labeling experiments in the presence of delipidated bovine serum albumin (which binds acyl-CoA with a K d of ∼0.5 μm) showed that FadR could be labeled in the presence of a 2-fold excess of bovine serum albumin and therefore that FadR competes effectively with bovine serum albumin for the [9-3H]APNA-CoA (data not shown). The radiolabeled proteins were digested with trypsin in order to identify peptides cross-linked to [9-3H]APNA-CoA. Since the affinity label is at the ϖ-end of the acyl chain, the amino acid residues within a labeled tryptic peptide are expected to be part of a hydrophobic pocket within FadR that binds long chain acyl-CoA. Additionally, some of the amino acid residues within the labeled peptide may make specific contacts with the acyl chain. A tryptic map of full-length FadR photo-cross-linked to [9-3H]APNA-CoA is shown in Fig. 2. The peptides generated by digestion with trypsin were separated by HPLC on a Dynasphere column preequilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and developed with a linear gradient of acetonitrile with 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid (0–70% in 40 min) (Fig.3 A). The major amount of radioactivity was eluted in"
https://openalex.org/W1993693715,"We reported previously that the ζ-form 14-3-3 protein (14-3-3ζ) binds to a platelet adhesion receptor, glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX, and this binding is dependent on the SGHSL sequence at the C terminus of GPIbα. In this study, we have identified a binding site in the helix I region of 14-3-3ζ (residues 202–231) required for binding to GPIb-IX complex and to the cytoplasmic domain of GPIbα. We also show that phosphorylation-dependent binding of c-Raf to 14-3-3ζ requires helix G (residues 163–187) but not helix I. Thus, the GPIbα-binding site is distinct from the binding sites for RSXpSXP motif-dependent ligands. Furthermore, we show that wild type 14-3-3ζ has a higher affinity for GPIb-IX complex than recombinant GPIbα cytoplasmic domain. Deletion of helices A and B (residues 1–32) disrupts 14-3-3ζ dimerization and decreases its affinity for GPIb-IX. Disruption of 14-3-3ζ dimerization, however, does not reduce 14-3-3ζ binding to recombinant GPIbα cytoplasmic domain. This suggests a dual site recognition mechanism in which a 14-3-3ζ dimer interacts with both GPIbα and GPIbβ (known to contain a phosphorylation-dependent binding site), resulting in high affinity binding.

GPIb-IX-V consists of four different transmembrane subunits as follows: disulfide-linked GPIbα and GPIbβ forms a 1:1 complex with GPIX (6Du X. Beutler L. Ruan C. Castaldi P.A. Berndt M.C. Blood. 1987; 69: 1524-1527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the GPIb-IX complex (GPIb-IX) forms a 2:1 complex with GPV which may dissociate in certain detergents such as Triton X-100 (7Modderman P.W.

We found that GPIb-IX is physically associated with an intracellular signaling protein, the ζ-form 14-3-3 protein (14-3-3ζ) (13Du X. Harris S.J. Tetaz T.J. Ginsberg M.H. Berndt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18287-18290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a potential role for 14-3-3ζ in GPIb-IX-V mediated signaling. We further identified a C-terminal 5-residue sequence of GPIbα (SGHSL) that is critical for the binding of 14-3-3ζ (14Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), a result confirmed by Andrew et al. (15Andrews R.K. Harris S.J. McNally T. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in addition to the C-terminal sequence of GPIbα, GPIb-IX binding to 14-3-3ζ also involves a protein kinase A (PKA)-phosphorylated binding site in the cytoplasmic domain of GPIbβ (15Andrews R.K.

Blood. 1998; 91: 1295-1303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 14-3-3ζ belongs to the 14-3-3 family of highly conserved intracellular proteins (17Aitken A. Jones D. Soneji Y. Howell S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The 14-3-3 proteins are dimeric; each monomer is composed of nine anti-parallel α-helices forming a large ligand binding groove as revealed by crystal structure analysis (18Liu D. Bienkowska J.

The 14-3-3 proteins bind and regulate a variety of intracellular signaling molecules, including various protein kinase C isotypes (17Aitken A. Jones D. Soneji Y. Howell S. Biochem. Soc.

Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar). The 14-3-3 proteins also have been implicated in the assembly of protein kinase complexes (30Braselmann S. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4839-4848Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that binding of GPIb-IX to 14-3-3ζ links GPIb-IX to intracellular signaling pathways. In addition, the 14-3-3-binding site in GPIbα has been shown (31Dong J.F. Li C.Q. Sae T.G. Hyun W. Afshar K.V. Lopez J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12421-12427Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) to be important in regulating the lateral movement of GPIb-IX-V in plasma membrane, suggesting its possible involvement in regulating GPIbα interaction with the cytoskeleton. Thus, structural definition of the 14-3-3ζ-GPIb-IX interaction may serve as a basis for understanding the role of 14-3-3 in signaling mediated by GPIb-IX. Many of the 14-3-3-binding proteins contain an Arg-Ser-X-phosphoserine-X-Pro (RSXpSXP) motif, originally found in c-Raf (32Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). At least two of the RSXpSXP motif-containing ligands c-Raf and tryptophan hydroxylase can be induced to bind 14-3-3 by PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation (32Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 33Banik U. Wang G.A. Wagner P.D. Kaufman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26219-26225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Other serine protein kinases have also been shown to induce 14-3-3 binding to various proteins (27Liu Y.C. Elly C. Yoshida H. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14591-14595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar,34Ichimura T. Uchiyama J. Kunihiro O. Ito M. Horigome T. Omata S. Shinkai F. Kaji H. Isobe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28515-28518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recently, several different 14-3-3 binding sequences have been identified in 14-3-3 ligands including RX(Y/F)XpSXP, RXXSXpSXP, and RXSX(pS/pT)XP (where pT is phosphothreonine) (15Andrews R.K. Harris S.J. McNally T. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 27Liu Y.C. Elly C. Yoshida H. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Altman A. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasmic domain of GPIbα, a 5-residue sequence, SGHSL, is both necessary and sufficient for interaction with 14-3-3ζ (14Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 15Andrews R.K. Harris S.J. McNally T. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in contrast to RSXpSXP-containing ligands c-Raf and tryptophan hydroxylase, the cytoplasmic domain of GPIbα appears to be a poor PKA substrate in intact platelets (36Wyler B. Bienz D. Clemetson K.J. Luscher E.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 37Fox J.E. Berndt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9520-9526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, characterization of the structural basis of the GPIbα interaction with 14-3-3 will clarify the differences between RSXpSXP-containing 14-3-3 ligands and GPIbα and further our understanding of how 14-3-3 regulates functions of different types of ligand proteins. In this study, we have identified a binding site in 14-3-3ζ in the helix I region of 14-3-3ζ encompassing residues 202–231 that interact with the GPIbα cytoplasmic domain and the intact GPIb-IX complex. We also show in vitro that c-Raf binds to 14-3-3ζ in a PKA-dependent manner and that this binding requires helix G but not helix I. Thus, the GPIbα-binding site in 14-3-3ζ is distinct from the binding site for RSXpSXP-containing ligand c-Raf. Furthermore, we show that 14-3-3ζ dimerization is required for high affinity binding to GPIb-IX complex, suggesting that a dual site recognition mechanism involving GPIbα and β subunits and dimerized 14-3-3ζ. Cloning of the cDNA encoding wild type 14-3-3ζ was described previously (14Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The 14-3-3ζ cDNA was subcloned into a pmalC2 vector (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The construct (pmal1433ζ) encodes a fusion protein with the N-terminal region corresponding to the Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) and C-terminal region corresponding to 14-3-3ζ. Mutagenesis of pmal1433ζ was performed using PCR techniques (38Du X. Gu M. Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Bennett J.S. Bowditch R. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23087-23092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all mutants except T3, stop codons were introduced into reverse primers at designated sites of the 14-3-3ζ. The stop codon in mutant T3 was introduced inadvertently by PCR error. The mutants were subcloned into a pmalC2 vector at the EcoRI and XbaI sites. Correct sequences were verified by automated sequencing. The wild type 14-3-3ζ and 14-3-3 truncation mutants were purified by affinity chromatography using a cross-linked amylose-Sepharose column (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Equivalent amounts (71 μmol of protein/ml Sepharose) of the purified wild type or mutant 14-3-3ζ or MBP were conjugated onto cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively. Coupling efficiencies in all cases were better than 99% as assessed by optical density at 280 nm wave length. The cDNA encoding GPIbα in a pBlueScript vector was a generous gift from Dr. Jerry Ware at the Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA. The cDNA fragment encoding the cytoplasmic domain of GPIbα (residues 518–610) was generated by PCR with EcoRI andXbaI sites incorporated in the forward and reverse primers, respectively. The PCR product was subcloned into the pmalC2 vector. The correct sequence was verified by automated sequencing. The protein was expressed and purified as described previously (38Du X. Gu M. Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Bennett J.S. Bowditch R. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23087-23092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific binding of the platelet GPIb-IX complex to 14-3-3ζ-conjugated beads has been described previously (14Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, washed platelets were resuspended in Hepes buffer (137 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mmd-glucose, 3.3 mmNa2HPO4, 3.8 mm Hepes, pH 7.35) and solubilized by adding an equal volume of the solubilization buffer (2% Triton X-100, 0.1 m Tris, 0.01 m EGTA, 0.15m NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) containing 0.2 mm E64 (Boehringer Mannheim) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (13Du X. Harris S.J. Tetaz T.J. Ginsberg M.H. Berndt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18287-18290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, platelets were solubilized in the presence of 1 mmCaCl2 but in the absence of EGTA and E64 to allow calpain cleavage of GPIbα and thus generation of the C-terminal domain of GPIb-IX complex. After centrifugation at 100,000 × gfor 30 min, the lysates (200 μl) were incubated with 25 μl (50% (v/v)) MBP-conjugated control beads or 14-3-3ζ-conjugated beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then washed three times in a 1:1 mix of Hepes buffer and solubilization buffer. Bound proteins were extracted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody against GPIbα, WM23 (kindly provided by Dr. Michael C. Berndt, Baker Institute, Melbourne, Australia (39Berndt M.C. Gregory C. Kabral A. Zola H. Fournier D. Castaldi P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 637-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar)). In some experiments, GPIb-IX was also detected using a polyclonal anti-peptide antibody against the C-terminal domain of GPIbα, anti-IbαC (14Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Reactions with antibodies were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and Kodak X-Omat AR film. In some experiments, reactions were visualized using SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce) and quantitated with a Bio-Rad PhosphorImager and chemiluminescence-sensitive phosphor-screens that have a theoretical linear range of 100–104. Binding of recombinant GPIbα cytoplasmic domain fusion protein (Mal-IbαC) to 14-3-3ζ was performed essentially as described above except purified Mal-IbαC fusion protein was used. The Mal-IbαC binding was performed in the platelet lysate buffer described above or in 0.1m sodium citrate, pH 5.6. Binding of Mal-IbαC protein to beads was detected by Western blotting with a rabbit anti-peptide antibody against the cytoplasmic domain of GPIbα, anti-IbαC (14Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Human recombinant c-Raf cDNA (a gift from Dr. Michael Karin, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla) was subcloned into a pmalC2 vector by three-fragment ligation (EcoRI, HindIII, andXbaI) and expressed as a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein. The purified recombinant c-Raf was phosphorylated by incubation with protein kinase A catalytic subunit (10 units/100 μl) (Sigma) and 1 mm ATP in 15 mm Hepes, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EGTA, 130 mm KCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.4, at 22 °C for 30 min. The PKA-treated c-Raf was incubated with 14-3-3ζ-conjugated beads at 4 °C for 1 h. After three washes, bead-bound proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against c-Raf (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Purified MBP-14-3-3ζ fusion protein and 14-3-3 mutants (200 μl, ∼1.5 mg/ml) were analyzed by gel filtration using a Pharmacia Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column and a Pharmacia Explorer 10 high performance liquid chromatography system at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was equilibrated with 0.02 m Tris, 0.15m NaCl, pH 7.4. The molecular mass was determined by comparing with the elution volumes of the molecular mass standard proteins, IgG (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), and ovalbumin (43 kDa). In order to identify the sequence within 14-3-3ζ that is responsible for its interaction with the GPIb-IX complex, we made various 14-3-3ζ truncation mutants (Fig.1). Mutants T1 to T6 were truncated from the C-terminal end of 14-3-3ζ. Mutants T7–T9 were truncated progressively from the N-terminal end of the protein. T11-(136–209) encompasses helices G and H, and T12 contains helices H and I. T13-(188–209) contains a single helix H that was implicated in tryptophan hydroxylase binding (34Ichimura T. Uchiyama J. Kunihiro O. Ito M. Horigome T. Omata S. Shinkai F. Kaji H. Isobe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28515-28518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). T14-(202–231) containing helix I was generated when results obtained with T1–T13 indicated the location of the GPIbα-binding site (see below). As 14-3-3ζ is composed of nine anti-parallel α-helices (A-I), truncation sites in all these mutants are located between two neighboring α-helices as determined by the published crystal structure to avoid disruption of each of these helical structures (Fig. 1). These mutant proteins were expressed as fusion proteins with maltose-binding protein. Equivalent amounts of the purified wild type and mutant 14-3-3ζ were conjugated to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B as described previously (38Du X. Gu M. Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Bennett J.S. Bowditch R. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23087-23092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first examined the binding of Triton X-100-solubilized platelet GPIb-IX to the above described Sepharose beads conjugated with 14-3-3 truncation mutants (T1–T13). MBP-conjugated beads were used as a negative control, and the wild type 14-3-3ζ-beads was used as a positive control. Bead-bound GPIb-IX was detected by Western blotting with an anti-GPIbα antibody, WM23, and quantitated with a Bio-Rad PhosphorImager and chemiluminescence-sensitive phosphor-screens. Fig.2 shows that GPIb-IX binds to wild type 14-3-3ζ- but not MBP-conjugated beads. Removal of the C-terminal tail of 14-3-3ζ by truncation at amino acid residue 231 (mutant T6) did not negatively affect GPIb-IX binding, suggesting that the C-terminal region between residues 231 and 246 is not required. Further truncation at residue 209 (mutant T5), which removes the helix I (the first α-helix from the C-terminal end), completely abolished GPIb-IX binding (Fig. 2). Furthermore, none of the truncation mutants that lack helix I bound to GPIb-IX (T5, T11, T13, Fig. 2; T1-T4, data not shown). Thus, the helix I region encompassing residues 209–231 of 14-3-3ζ appears to be required for binding to GPIb-IX. Truncation mutants T9-(188–246) and T12-(188–231) containing helix H and I interacted with GPIb-IX, indicating that the sequence between residues 188 and 231 of 14-3-3ζ (helices H and I) contains a binding site for the GPIb-IX complex. Similar results were also obtained when bead-bound GPIb-IX was detected with an antibody against the C-terminal region of GPIbα, anti-IbαC (data not shown). Fig. 2 also shows that truncation mutants of 14-3-3ζ lacking the N-terminal domain (T7, T8, T9, and T12) binds significantly less GPIb-IX in comparison with wild type 14-3-3ζ. Since similar amounts of proteins were conjugated to these beads (Fig. 2 C), this result indicates that GPIb-IX bound to these mutants with reduced affinity. In particular, the mutant T7 lacking only 33 residues in helices A and B (1Ware J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 466-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 2Lopez J.A.

However, this reduction in GPIb-IX binding affinity is partially “rescued” by further truncations from the N terminus that removed helices A–E (T8, 20% binding compared with wild type 14-3-3ζ) or helices A–G (T9, 50% binding compared with wild type) (Fig. 2). It is not clear why these further truncations rescued the loss of binding affinity. One of the possibilities is that further truncations resulted in increased accessibility of GPIb-IX to the binding site in helix I. Nevertheless, this result suggests that the N-terminal domain, while important for high affinity, is not required for binding to GPIb-IX. Previously reported crystal structural analysis of 14-3-3ζ has revealed that the N-terminal helices (A and B) are involved in the formation of 14-3-3ζ dimers (18Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H. Liddington R. Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 19Xiao B. Smerdon S.J. Jones D.H. Dodson G.G. Soneji Y. Aitken A. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the reduced affinity for GPIb-IX is caused by disruption of dimerization. To examine this possibility, we determined the molecular mass of the MBP-14-3-3ζ fusion proteins by gel filtration chromatography under non-denaturing conditions. The 14-3-3ζ monomer has a molecular mass of ∼30 kDa (40Zupan L.A. Steffens D.L. Berry C.A. Landt M. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8707-8710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Taken together, these data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of TFII-I is important for its initiator-dependent transcriptional activity. TFII-I is a multifunctional transcription factor with broad biochemical and biological activities and may be involved in several genetic disorders (1Roy A.L. Meisterernst M. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to undertake biochemical dissection of TFII-I to gain functional insights into this novel protein. We have previously shown that TFII-I can bind to the Inr 1The abbreviations used are: Inr, initiator; PAA, phosphoamino analysis; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. element in the natural TATA-less but Inr-containing T-cell receptor Vβ promoter and is required for its Inr-dependent transcription in vitro (4Manzano-Winkler B. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12076-12081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and in vivo (7Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4444-4454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TFII-I can also bind specifically to the Inr element in the TATA- and Inr-containing adenovirus major late promoter and, together with the upstream stimulatory factor, can markedly enhance adenovirus major late promoter transcription via the Inr element in vivo (6Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, the function of TFII-I is not necessarily restricted to the Inr element, as TFII-I can bind to an upstream regulatory element (E-box) both independently and synergistically with the upstream stimulatory factor and stimulate transcription in vivo through E-box elements in the absence of an Inr (6Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus, TFII-I may serve as a transcriptional cofactor that potentially integrates signals from the regulatory components to the basal machinery. Consistent with its multifunctional potentials, TFII-I promotes formation of serum response factor and homeodomain protein Phox1 complexes on the c-fospromoter at the upstream serum response element (8Grueneberg D.A. Henry R.W. Brauer A. Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Gilman M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2482-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). TFII-I functions through the upstream c-sis-inducible factor element and serum response elements, and ectopic expression of TFII-I leads to enhanced transcriptional activation of the c-fos promoter to a variety of stimuli (e.g. epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) (9Kim D.-W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, growth factor stimulation leads to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of TFII-I (9Kim D.-W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Finally, TFII-I is identical to the recently discovered protein BAP-135, which is associated in vivo with Btk (Bruton's tyrosine kinase), a mutation that leads to X-linked immune deficiency in humans and mice (10Yang W. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). 2C. D. Novina, U. Bajpai, V. Cheriyath, S. Pillai, H. H. Wortis, and A. L. Roy, submitted for publication. TFII-I is tyrosine-phosphorylated by Btk in vitro and upon immunoglobulin receptor cross-linking in B-cells (10Yang W. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that TFII-I is a novel factor that can link signal-responsive activator complexes to the general transcription machinery perhaps in a cell type-dependent fashion. Interestingly, TFII-I has also been identified in the breakpoint regions of the 7q11.23 Williams-Beuren syndrome deletion (11Perez Juardo L.A. Wang Y.-K. Peoples R. Coloma A. Cruces J. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To begin to understand the specific role that phosphorylation plays in regulating the functional activity of TFII-I, we have undertaken biochemical analysis of this multifunctional protein. Here we show that TFII-I is phosphorylated basally (i.e. in the absence of apparent extracellular signals) at serine/threonine and tyrosine residues. In vitro dephosphorylation of native TFII-I suggests that phosphorylation is dispensable for its specific DNA binding activity, but is required for its transcriptional activity. Extending these studies in vivo, we show that compared with wild-type TFII-I, a mutant TFII-I (in which the consensus tyrosine phosphorylation site is changed to phenylalanine) failed to significantly activate the Vβ promoter. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of TFII-I is critical for its basal transcriptional properties. In vivo labeling of cultured cells with inorganic phosphate and subsequent processing were done essentially as described (12Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). HeLa cells (3 × 105/ml × 66 ml) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and harvested. Cell pellets were washed and resuspended in serum-free and phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The resuspended cells were supplemented with 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (3000 Ci/mmol). Labeling proceeded for 4 h at 37 °C Phosphate-labeled cells were harvested and washed in ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (3 × 10 ml), and nuclear extracts were prepared (13Dignam J.D. Martin P. Shastry B. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 583-598Google Scholar). Anti-TFII-I antiserum (5 μl) was coupled to protein A-agarose (15 μl, 1:1 slurry) in buffer A (20 mmTris (pH 7.9 at 4 °C), 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, and 100 mm KCl) containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40, incubated for 40 min at 4 °C, washed in buffer A with 0.05% Nonidet P-40 (6 × 1 ml), mixed with labeled nuclear extract, and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking. The beads were washed in buffer A containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The gel was Coomassie Blue-stained, dried, and briefly subjected to autoradiography. A band corresponding to 120 kDa was excised from the gel, rehydrated, and subjected to PAA (14Kamps M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, constantly boiling HCl (90 μl) was added to each sample and allowed to boil for 1.5 h. Samples were dried in a Speed-Vac and washed twice with (50 μl) and once with (25 μl) glass-distilled water. The samples were resuspended in sample buffer containing unlabeled standard phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine. The samples were spotted on TLC plates and subject to electrophoresis for 30 min at 1000 V in the first dimension (buffer: 2.2% formic acid and 7.8% acetic acid) and to TLC in the second dimension (buffer: 70% isopropyl alcohol and 36.5% hydrochromic acid). TLC plates were allowed to dry and were subjected to autoradiography for 1 week at −70 °C. Standards were visualized with ninhydrin spraying and matched with the spots visualized by autoradiography. For immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, the monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (20 μl, 1:1 slurry) for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking. The antibody-coupled beads were washed in buffer A (3 × 0.5 ml), and partially purified TFII-I (15Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Denis M.C. Roy A.L. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1997; 12: 254-263Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was added to the antibody-coupled matrix or to the matrix alone and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The matrix was washed in buffer A (3 × 0.5 ml) and was subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE. For TFII-I Western blots, primary (anti-TFII-I, 1:2500 dilution) and secondary (1:1500 dilution) anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked antibodies were incubated in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (15Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Denis M.C. Roy A.L. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1997; 12: 254-263Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (see Fig. 2) was used at 0.5 μg/ml, and the anti-phosphoserine antibody PSR-45 (Sigma) was used at 1:2000. All Western blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For removal of immune complexes from Western-blotted membranes, each blot was incubated with 62.3 mm Tris (pH 6.9), 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 2 h at 55 °C with one exchange of buffer after 1 h. The membrane stripped of immune complexes was washed in Tris-buffered saline and re-blocked for subsequent Western analysis. Dephosphorylation reactions were performed with alkaline phosphatase-coupled agarose beads (Sigma). The insoluble enzyme was used at 2.95 units/reaction, where 1 unit is defined as the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyze 1.0 μmol of p-nitrophenyl phosphate/min at pH 9.8 and 37 °C. The coupled beads were equilibrated and resuspended in buffer A, and protein was added as indicated. The dephosphorylation reaction proceeded for 20 min at 37 °C. The insoluble beads were centrifuged for 10 s at room temperature, and the supernatant was aspirated and subjected to Western analysis and DNA binding or transcription reactions. EMSA and in vitro transcription reactions were performed as described (4Manzano-Winkler B. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. J. Biol.

Cheriyath V. Denis M.C. Roy A.L. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1997; 12: 254-263Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) used in these assays was carried out as described. COS-7 cells were transfected with pEBII-I by the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (7Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell.

These cells (three plates each for treatment or control) were harvested by scraping, washed in 14 ml of phosphate-buffered saline with 5 mm EDTA, resuspended to 1.5 ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. During the time of harvest, the pervanadate solution was prepared by mixing 20 μl of 0.1 m Na3VO4, 372 μl of H2O, and 8 μl of 30% H2O2 and was incubated for 15 min at room temperature (17Lee Y.J. Luisiri P. Clark M.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3828-3837PubMed Google Scholar, 18Secrist J.P. Burns L.A. Karnitz L. Koretzky G.A. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5886-5893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pervanadate solution (75 μl) was added to the test cells, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (75 μl) was added to the control cells, which were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 rpm, transferred to a microcentrifuge tube in phosphate-buffered saline without EDTA, and microcentrifuged for 5 s, and the supernatant was aspirated. Whole cell extracts were prepared by addition of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 8.0 at 25 °C), 150 mm NaCl, 1.2% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, and 2 mmNa3VO4) containing the protease inhibitors 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and soy bean trypsin inhibitor. The cells were incubated on ice for 15 min with periodic vortexing and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm and 4 °C. Whole cell extracts (200 μg (see Figs. 4 B and 6) and 50 μg (see Fig.4 C)) from untransfected or p146-transfected COS cells with or without pervanadate treatment were subjected to precipitation with glutathione-Sepharose (40 μl, 1:1 slurry; Sigma) for 90 min with rocking at 4 °C. The reactions were centrifuged for 2 min at 9000 rpm and 4 °C. The supernatants were aspirated, and the beads were washed three times. For washing, 1 ml of lysis buffer was added to the beads, vortexed for 5 s, and incubated on ice for 5 min. After the final wash, the supernatant was aspirated, and 2× Laemmli buffer was added to the beads and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western analysis.Figure 6Y-F mutation leads to reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of TFII-I in vivo. COS-7 cells were transfected with 10 μg of wild-type (WT) or Y-F mutant TFII-I expression plasmids. Cells were lysed 60 h post-transfection and subjected to GST pull down as described under “Experimental Procedures.” GST-Sepharose beads bound to proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. The tyrosine phosphorylation levels were detected by Western blot analysis with anti-Tyr(P) antibody 4G10 (α-P-Tyr; left panel). The blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-TFII-I antibody (α-TFII-I;right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The codons for tyrosine residues at amino acids 248 and 249 in TFII-I cDNA were changed to codons for phenylalanine by PCR-based mutagenesis. In the first round of PCR, the region between the codons encoding amino acids 132 and 254 were amplified using primer 1 (5′-ACAGTGGTACCTGTACCATAT-3′) and primer 2 (5′-TTGAATGTTATATTGAaAAaAATCAGG-3′) (Reaction 1). In a separate reaction (Reaction 2), the codons between amino acids 243 and 322 were PCR-amplified using primer 3 (5′-TCAGAAGATCCTGATTtTTtTCAATATAAC-3′) and primer 4 (5′-GGGTTTACGTAGATCAGTGATG-3′). The mutated nucleotides for coding phenylalanine are designated in lowercase letters in primers 2 and 3. In the second round of PCR, 0.25 ng each from Reactions 1 and 2 were mixed and used as templates and amplified using primers 1 and 4. The final product was gel-isolated, digested with Acc65I andSnaBI, and then ligated with pEBGII-I. The positive clone obtained was confirmed by sequencing. Construction of the Vβ promoter fused to the luciferase cassette and transient transfection assays in COS-7 cells were carried out as described (7Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4444-4454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A highly interesting feature revealed by analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of TFII-I is the presence of a number of potential phosphorylation sites, including 35 potential serine/threonine phosphorylation and two tyrosine phosphorylation (EDXDY) sites, suggesting that TFII-I has the potential to be differentially regulated in response to distinct physiological stimuli (6Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus, we first tested the phosphorylation status of native TFII-I in HeLa cells (Fig.1) by PAA. TFII-I was immunoprecipitated by a highly specific anti-TFII-I antibody from orthophosphate-labeled HeLa cells and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig.1 A). The band corresponding to 120 kDa/TFII-I was excised and subjected to PAA (Fig. 1 B). When compared with the ninhydrin standards, PAA revealed that TFII-I was phosphorylated predominantly at serine residues. These assays employed acid hydrolysis of peptide bonds. Because phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine are acid-labile relative to phosphoserine (14Kamps M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), alternative methods were employed to detect potential phosphorylated threonine and tyrosine residues in TFII-I. The detection of phosphotyrosine residues in HeLa-derived TFII-I was attempted by immunochemical analysis subsequent to immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Because TFII-I phosphorylation decreases upon purification, 3C. D. Novina and A. L. Roy, unpublished data. a two column-purified fraction containing TFII-I derived from HeLa nuclear extracts was used for this analysis (Fig. 1 C). TFII-I was detected in immunoprecipitates from this fraction with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, but not with protein A-Sepharose beads alone. However, the amount of TFII-I in the immunoprecipitate, compared with the supernatant, was low (data not shown), indicating either that TFII-I is weakly phosphorylated at tyrosine residues or that only a fraction of total TFII-I is tyrosine-phosphorylated basally under these conditions. We tested whether the basal phosphorylation of TFII-I is necessary and sufficient for its DNA binding and transcription functions. To determine the functional role of phosphorylation of TFII-I, we dephosphorylated native TFII-I in vitro and tested its DNA binding (Fig. 2) and transcriptional (Fig. 3) properties. EMSA showed that the dephosphorylated protein (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2–4) was capable of binding to the Vβ Inr probe almost as efficiently as its phosphorylated counterpart (lane 1). At the highest phosphatase concentrations (lane 4), there was a slight reduction in DNA binding. To demonstrate that the recovery of TFII-I protein after phosphatase treatment was nearly identical in all lanes, Western blot analysis with anti-TFII-I antibody was performed (Fig.2 B, left panel). The slight reduction in EMSA (Fig. 2 A, lane 4) corresponds to a lower recovery of protein observed in Western blotting with anti-TFII-I antibody (Fig.2 B, left panel, lane 4). To demonstrate that TFII-I was efficiently dephosphorylated under these conditions, the blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-phosphoserine antibody (Fig. 2 B, right panel). Untreated native TFII-I (lane 1), but not phosphatase-treated TFII-I (lanes 2–4), was specifically immunoreactive to anti-phosphoserine antibody, suggesting that the dephosphorylation reaction proceeded to completion to the limit of detection by this analysis. Identical results have also been obtained with anti-phosphothreonine and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (data not shown). Next we tested whether the DNA binding specificity of TFII-I was altered during dephosphorylation and found that it was indistinguishable from that of the corresponding phosphorylated protein (Fig. 2 C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that phosphorylation of TFII-I does not significantly alter its DNA binding properties either qualitatively or quantitatively. Finally, we tested the effect of dephosphorylation of TFII-I on Vβ transcription in Jurkat nuclear extracts immunodepleted of endogenous TFII-I (Fig.3 A, compare lanes 1 and 2). Although native phosphorylated TFII-I was competent to fully restore Vβ transcription (compare lanes 2 and 3), identical amounts of in vitro dephosphorylated TFII-I were incompetent to restore Vβ transcription when added to the TFII-I-depleted extract (compare lanes 3 and 4), indicating that phosphorylation of TFII-I is required for its transcriptional activity. To demonstrate that the lack of transcriptional activity of dephosphorylated TFII-I under our assay conditions is not due to carryover of residual phosphatase leading to nonspecific inhibition of the transcription reaction, control experiments were performed (Fig.3 B). Vβ transcription (lane 1) was not inhibited by addition of either bovine serum albumin alone (lane 2) or alkaline phosphatase-treated bovine serum albumin (lane 3). TFII-I has been recently cloned by us and by others as a multifunctional transcription factor (6Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 8Grueneberg D.A. Henry R.W. Brauer A. Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Gilman M.

Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We employed a recombinant form of TFII-I (GST-TFII-I/p146) (7Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4444-4454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Grueneberg D.A. Henry R.W. Brauer A. Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Gilman M.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) to study its function and phosphorylation status in mammalian cells (COS-7) since these cells express low amounts of endogenous TFII-I (7Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4444-4454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether recombinant TFII-I, like native TFII-I, exhibits tyrosine phosphorylation, COS-7 cells ectopically expressing p146 were treated with pervanadate (a potent tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor) (18Secrist J.P. Burns L.A. Karnitz L. Koretzky G.A. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5886-5893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the derived lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti-Tyr(P) antibody (Fig. 4 A, left panel). Compared with both the untransfected and transfected control lysates in the absence of pervanadate, the pervanadate-treated transfected lysate demonstrated several proteins with markedly increased phosphotyrosine content. This blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-TFII-I antibody (Fig. 4 A, right panel) to demonstrate that comparable amounts of p146 are expressed in both pervanadate-treated and untreated lysates. To ensure that p146 is among the proteins that exhibit increased tyrosine phosphorylation, it was pulled down with GST-agarose and probed with anti-Tyr(P) antibody (Fig.4 B, left panel). Whereas beads from neither the untransfected control lysate nor the transfected but untreated lysate showed any significant anti-Tyr(P) antibody-reactive bands, beads from the pervanadate-treated lysate showed a 146-kDa anti-Tyr(P) antibody-reactive band. When stripped and reprobed with anti-TFII-I antibody (Fig. 4 B, right panel), the 146-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein comigrated with GST-TFII-I/p146. Moreover, these data show that almost equal amounts of GST-TFII-I/p146 are pulled down in the untreated lysate compared with the pervanadate-treated lysate. In contrast, and as expected, pervanadate treatment did not cause any significant increase in phosphoserine on ectopically expressed GST-TFII-I since TFII-I from both the pervanadate-treated and untreated lysates showed equal anti-phosphoserine reactivity (Fig. 4 C, left panel) and equal recovery of p146 under both conditions (right panel). We conclude that ectopically expressed TFII-I exhibits tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of any apparent extracellular signals. The pervanadate-treated and untreated lysates were also compared in EMSA, and no significant differences were observed (data not shown). There are two consensus tyrosine phosphorylation motifs (EDXDY) in TFII-I: at positions 244–248 (site I) and 273–277 (site II) (6Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Site I additionally has a tyrosine residue at position 249. However, of the two sites, data base (PROSITE) search only recognized site I as a consensus tyrosine phosphorylation site. Hence, we first decided to mutate this site. PCR-directed mutagenesis was employed to generate a mutant in which both tyrosine residues at positions 248 and 249 in site I were altered to phenylalanine. This mutant henceforth is referred to as the Y-F mutant. To compare the transcriptional phenotype of this mutant with that of the wild-type protein, transient transfection assays were performed using a Vβ reporter construct as described (7Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4444-4454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas wild-type TFII-I exhibited nearly a 4-fold induction of Vβ promoter activity, the mutant failed to activate the promoter significantly over and above the control levels (Fig.5, upper panel). The residual activity seen with the mutant could be due to tyrosine phosphorylation of site II, which has not yet been mutated. More important, the difference in transcriptional activity between wild-type and mutant TFII-I is not due to a difference in their protein expression since Western blot analysis showed that the expression levels were very similar, and thus, the Y-F mutation does not cause any apparent protein instability (Fig. 5, lower panel). That the Y-F mutation leads to reduced basal tyrosine phosphorylation in TFII-I was demonstrated by GST pull-down assays (Fig.6). Lysates were prepared from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with either wild-type or Y-F mutant TFII-I and incubated with GST-agarose. The GST beads were boiled and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (left panel). The difference in tyrosine phosphorylation signals was quantitated by densitometry and found to be 2.32-fold higher in the wild-type than in the mutant protein. To show that equivalent quantities of wild-type and mutant proteins were loaded, the blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-TFII-I antibody. The level of mutant TFII-I was 1.45-fold higher than wild-type TFII-I, and thus, the difference in tyrosine signals between the wild-type and mutant proteins is nearly 4-fold. However, although the mutant shows reduced tyrosine phosphorylation, it still shows some residual tyrosine phosphorylation, which could be due to site II. Regulation of gene-specific transcription factor activity by phosphorylation is not unique (19Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar, 20Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar, 21Jackson S.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 104-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, direct regulation of core promoter activity via phosphorylation of components of the basal transcription machinery has been only recently demonstrated (22Kitajima S. Chibazakura T. Yohana M. Yasukochi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29970-29977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Segil N. Guermah M. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. Heintz N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2389-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 24Dikstein R. Ruppert S. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 84: 781-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In line with these latter observations, we show here that basal transcription of the TATA−Inr+ Vβ promoter is regulated via phosphorylation of TFII-I. For these studies, we attempted to determine the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in TFII-I. We demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of TFII-I is required for its Inr-dependent transcriptional activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report that demonstrates basal transcriptional regulation via tyrosine phosphorylation. Although tyrosine phosphorylation of TFII-I is required for its basal transcription function, we do not yet know the precise mechanism. Since the DNA binding seems to be unaffected by phosphorylation, it is likely that the protein-protein interactions of TFII-I with the basal machinery may be dependent upon its phosphorylation status. It is also possible that tyrosine phosphorylation of TFII-I is required for its nuclear translocation. However, the latter does not appear to be the case as the Y-F mutant readily translocates to the nucleus upon ectopic expression (data not shown). The role of serine phosphorylation in TFII-I is less clear at present. Because there are numerous potential Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites, it is difficult to assess which one of these is utilized inside the cell. It is possible that serine phosphorylation of TFII-I is required for protein stability. Thus, addition of completely dephosphorylated TFII-I to nuclear extract could lead to degradation/proteolysis of the protein. It is also possible that serine phosphorylation may be an obligatory step for tyrosine phosphorylation. Hence, serine phosphorylation may be necessary but not sufficient for transcriptional activity. Since the Y-F mutant retains its serine phosphorylation (data not shown), we cannot rule out this latter possibility. Finally, it remains possible that serine phosphorylation affects its upstream activator functions as opposed to its core promoter functions. Here we have attempted to analyze the basal phosphorylation of TFII-I and its potential effects on DNA binding and transcription. Although TFII-I appears to have both core promoter and upstream activator element-dependent transcription functions, use of the basal Vβ promoter does not allow us to assess the importance of the TFII-I phosphorylation for its upstream element-dependent function. Whereas phosphorylation appears to have no significant role in modulating its DNA binding activity, basal phosphorylation seems to be required for its Inr-dependent transcriptional activity. We would like to emphasize that what we termed as basal phosphorylation may not be so since we cannot rule out cell cycle effects and/or effects of growth factors present in serum that are required to grow the cells. However, since TFII-I is tyrosine-phosphorylated even under very low (0.5%) serum conditions (9Kim D.-W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), it is likely that additional parameters may contribute to phosphorylation of TFII-I. Although we have not yet addressed whether induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TFII-I (e.g. by growth factors) affects its basal transcription functions, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TFII-I in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation appears to correlate with its upstream element-dependent transcription functions at the c-fos promoter (9Kim D.-W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, we postulate that although induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TFII-I may not have any significant role in affecting its DNA binding capabilities, induced tyrosine phosphorylation could have a significant role in modulating its transcription functions, especially upstream activating functions. Because the TFII-I structure reveals several presumptive serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites (6Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), it is likely that TFII-I phosphorylation is induced in response to a wide variety of signaling pathways and consequently affects a multitude of TFII-I-responsive genes. Consistent with this notion, it appears that mitogen-activated protein kinase may be capable of phosphorylating TFII-I both in vitro and in vivo. 4V. Cheriyath, C. D. Novina, and A. L. Roy, unpublished data. Taken together, these observations suggest that the various functions of TFII-I might be regulated by its differential phosphorylation. Structure-function analysis of TFII-I should provide important clues regarding its presumptive role as a mediator between signal transduction and transcriptional cascades."

To determine its functional unit in vivo, we reintroduced wild-type (pentameric) or monomeric mutant (C41F) phospholamban in the hearts of phospholamban knockout mice. Transgenic lines, expressing similar levels of mutant or wild-type phospholamban, were identified, and their cardiac phenotypes were characterized in parallel. Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transport assays indicated similar decreases in SERCA2 Ca2+ affinity by mutant or wild-type phospholamban. However, the time constants of relaxation and Ca2+ transient decline in isolated cardiomyocytes were diminished to a greater extent by wild-type than mutant phospholamban, even without significant differences in the amplitudes of myocyte contraction and Ca2+ transients between the two groups. Langendorff perfusion also indicated that mutant phospholamban was not capable of depressing the enhanced relaxation parameters of the phospholamban knockout hearts to the same extent as wild-type phospholamban. Moreover, in vivo assessment of mouse hemodynamics revealed a greater depression of cardiac function in wild-type than mutant phospholamban hearts. Thus, the mutant or monomeric form of phospholamban was not as effective in slowing Ca2+ decline or relaxation in cardiomyocytes, hearts, or intact animals as wild-type or pentameric phospholamban. These findings suggest that pentameric assembly of phospholamban is necessary for optimal regulation of myocardial contractility in vivo.

Phospholamban (PLB) 1The abbreviations used are: PLB, phospholamban; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; α-MHC, α-myosin heavy chain; kb, kilobase pairs; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; LVSP, left ventricular systolic pressure. 1The abbreviations used are: PLB, phospholamban; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; α-MHC, α-myosin heavy chain; kb, kilobase pairs; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; LVSP, left ventricular systolic pressure. is a transmembrane phosphoprotein that interacts with and reversibly inhibits the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-ATPase. Phosphorylation of PLB by β-adrenergic agonists removes its inhibition and therefore facilitates Ca2+ transport into the SR lumen, enhancing cardiac relaxation. The physiological importance of PLB has recently been elucidated using gene targeting (1Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) and transgenic methodology (2Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn II, G.W. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These studies showed that ablation of PLB was associated with augmentation of the SR Ca2+-ATPase affinity for Ca2+ and basal cardiac contractility as well as attenuation of the cardiac responses to β-adrenergic agonists. By contrast, the SR Ca2+-ATPase Ca2+ affinity and contractile parameters were greatly diminished in cardiomyocytes overexpressing PLB. Thus, biochemical and functional characterization of these animal models indicates that PLB is a major regulator of cardiac contractilityin vivo (3Koss K.L. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar).The functional unit of PLB in native SR membranes is presently unknown. Phospholamban was originally proposed to form homopentamers through interactions with its transmembrane domain in the SR, based on its migration pattern on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (4Wegener A.D. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1834-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Colyer J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1766-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Pentameric assembly has been further supported by site-directed mutagenesis studies in expression systems (6Fujii J. Maruyama K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12950-12955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), computational modeling (7Arkin I.T. Adams P.D. MacKenzie K.R. Lemmon M.A. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4757-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 8Adams P.D. Arkin I.T. Engelman D.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), gel filtration chromatography (9Harrer J.M. Kranias E.G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and EPR spectroscopy studies (10Cornea R.L. Jones L.R. Autry J.M. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2960-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Recently, alanine-scanning mutagenesis studies in expression systems showed that a monomeric form of PLB, in which Leu37 was changed to Ala, suppressed SR Ca2+-ATPase Ca2+affinity more effectively than wild-type or pentameric PLB (11Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 12Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). It was thus postulated that there might be an equilibrium between pentameric and monomeric PLB in SR membranes. Pentameric PLB may represent a less active reservoir, which dissociates to provide active monomeric PLB subunits. However, coexpression of other monomeric forms of PLB, associated with mutation of Cys41 to Phe or Ser, with SR Ca 2+-ATPase in HEK-293 cells failed to demonstrate superinhibition (or gain of function) by PLB monomers (13Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies indicated that a pentameric form of PLB, resulting from mutation of Asn27 to Ala, was more potent than a monomeric mutant (L37A) PLB in inhibiting the SR Ca2+-ATPase Ca2+ affinity (14Kirchhefer U. Autry J.M. Weumann J. Jones L.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): A358Google Scholar, 15Kimura Y. Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14238-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and suggested that the oligomeric structure of PLB may be important in SR Ca2+-ATPase regulation.These in vitro structure-function studies of PLB were recently extended to in vivo systems, and a transgenic mouse model overexpressing a monomeric form of PLB, associated with the mutation C41F, was developed in our laboratory (16Chu G. Dorn II, G.W. Luo W. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cardiac-specific overexpression of monomeric PLB was associated with less inhibition of the SR Ca2+-ATPase Ca2+ affinity, cardiomyocyte mechanics, and Ca2+ kinetics than overexpression of wild-type PLB. However, such studies are difficult to interpret since they are done in the presence of endogenous wild-type or pentameric PLB. The expressed monomers could either coexist with the endogenous pentamers or disrupt pentameric assembly, resulting in the observed phenotype. Thus, it was important to extend these findings to the PLB-deficient background and to reintroduce wild-type or monomeric (C41F) PLB in the cardiac compartment of the knockout mouse to better clarify the physiological effects of monomeric PLB. Our results indicate that although PLB monomers (C41F) inhibit the apparent affinity of the SR Ca2+ uptake system to the same extent as PLB pentamers, they are not as effective in inhibiting the rate of myocardial relaxation assessed in isolated cardiomyocytes, perfused hearts, or intact animals.DISCUSSIONThis study was designed to determine the functional unit of PLBin vivo by reintroducing wild-type (pentameric) or monomeric mutant (C41F) PLB into the cardiac compartment of PLB knockout mice. Although expression of either PLB form was capable of inhibiting the SR Ca2+-ATPase Ca2+ affinity to the same extent, our findings indicate that monomeric PLB was less effective than the pentameric form in reversing the enhanced relaxation parameters of the PLB knockout hearts.The availability of the PLB knockout mouse coupled with a strong cardiac-specific α-MHC promoter allowed us for the first time to assess the functional significance of pentameric or monomeric PLB in a background free of the endogenous protein in vivo. Transgenic lines expressing similar levels of mutant or wild-type PLB were chosen to assess the effects of each PLB form in a physiologically relevant manner. Calcium transport studies showed that wild-type or mutant PLB inhibited the apparent affinity of SR Ca2+-ATPase for Ca2+ to the same extent. Furthermore, there were no alterations in the maximal velocity of the enzyme, consistent with the finding that the levels of SERCA2 were similar between these transgenic lines. However, the pentameric form of PLB depressed the relaxation rate during the steady-state twitch and prolonged the Ca2+ transient decline to a greater extent than the mutant or monomeric PLB in isolated cardiomyocytes. Consistent with the findings at the cellular level, this differential effect was also observed in Langendorff perfused hearts. Furthermore, assessment of cardiac contractile parameters in the intact mouse revealed a greater depression of cardiac relaxation rates by wild-type PLB than by mutant PLB. These findings on cardiac contractile parameters were similar to previous results in models overexpressing similar levels of wild-type or mutant PLB in the presence of the endogenous protein (16Chu G. Dorn II, G.W. Luo W. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the findings on SR Ca2+ transport measurements were different from those in the overexpression models (16Chu G. Dorn II, G.W. Luo W. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Overexpression of pentameric PLB was more effective than that of monomeric PLB in inhibiting the initial rates of SR Ca2+transport, whereas reintroduction of either form of PLB in the null background inhibited this SR parameter to the same extent. The reason for this apparent discrepancy could be due to the following: 1) the stoichiometric ratio of PLB to SERCA2 (0.7 in the transgenic mice in this study versus 2.0 in the overexpression models compared with 1.0 in the wild-type mice), which may affect the nature of interaction between these proteins; 2) the coexistence of PLB pentamers and monomers in the overexpression models, which may mask the maximal inhibitory effects by monomers; 3) compensatory mechanisms, associated with altered PLB expression levels, which may be different between the knockout and overexpression models; and 4) the genetic background of the two models (129/SvJ and CF-1 for the knockout modelsversus FVB/N for the overexpression models), which may contain different modifier alleles.The C41F mutation, chosen in this study, was based on previous in vitro (13Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo (16Chu G. Dorn II, G.W. Luo W. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) studies, which indicated that this mutation resulted in pentamer destabilization and formation of PLB monomers as revealed by SDS-PAGE. However, it is not entirely clear whether the migration pattern of C41F versus wild-type PLB on SDS-polyacrylamide gels reflects the in vivosituation. Future studies using chemical cross-linking (24Young E.F. McKee M.J. Ferguson D.G. Kranias E.G. Memb. Biochem. 1989; 8: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), EPR spectroscopy (10Cornea R.L. Jones L.R. Autry J.M. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2960-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), or low-angle laser light scattering measurements in conjunction with high-performance gel chromatography (25Watanabe Y. Kijima Y. Kadoma M. Tada M. Takagi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) may provide further insights into the oligomeric/monomeric state of PLB in vivo and its molecular dynamics upon mutagenesis or phosphorylation. Furthermore, it could be argued that replacement of cysteine with phenylalanine, which has a bulky side chain, may diminish the inhibitory effects of monomeric (C41F) PLB on cardiac relaxation parameters due to its inefficient interaction with the SR Ca2+-ATPase. However, biochemical reactivity studies of the three Cys residues (Cys36, Cys41, and Cys46) in the transmembrane domain of wild-type (pentameric) PLB indicated that Cys36 and Cys46reacted with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), whereas Cys41 remained unreactive (26Karim C.B. Stamm J.D. Karim J. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12074-12081Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). When PLB was denatured or a monomeric (L37A) form of PLB was used, all three Cys residues including Cys41 reacted with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (26Karim C.B. Stamm J.D. Karim J. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12074-12081Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that Cys41 in wild-type PLB may be located within the pore of the PLB pentamer, which is protected and most insensitive to chemical modification. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that the PLB transmembrane helix is oriented with Cys36 and Cys46 projecting into the lipid hydrocarbon, thus allowing interaction with the SR Ca2+-ATPase, and Cys41 on the helix interface within the pentameric structure of PLB away from the binding region of SR Ca2+-ATPase. Thus, mutation of Cys41 to Phe should not alter the interface of the inhibitory domain of PLB with the SR Ca2+-ATPase and their physical interaction. This assumption is also supported by previous in vitro expression studies of SR Ca 2+-ATPase and PLB (13Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by this study, in which C41F mutant or monomeric PLB was capable of inhibiting the SR Ca2+-ATPase Ca2+ affinity to the same extent as wild-type or pentameric PLB.Langendorff perfusion in the presence of 32P-containing buffer revealed that mutant PLB could be phosphorylated by isoproterenol. The degree of phosphorylation of monomeric PLB appeared to be similar to that of pentameric PLB, suggesting that the functional differences in cardiac preparations expressing wild-type or mutant PLB were not due to alterations in the phosphorylation capability of the mutant form of PLB. Under maximal stimulation by isoproterenol, the functional differences between the two forms of PLB, observed under basal conditions, were abolished, and the contractile parameters were similar between the two groups. It is interesting to note that both the non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of mutant PLB migrated with similar apparent monomeric molecular weight, indicating that phosphorylation did not promote oligomerization of PLB in vivo. These findings using in vivo phosphorylation conditions and SDS-PAGE are different from previous results based on EPR studies, which suggested that in vitro phosphorylation of wild-type or monomeric (L37A) PLB resulted in oligomer formation in lipid bilayers (10Cornea R.L. Jones L.R. Autry J.M. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2960-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).In summary, our findings indicate that cardiac-specific expression of the monomeric form of PLB (C41F) is associated with inhibition of the SR Ca2+-ATPase Ca2+ affinity, similar to wild-type or pentameric PLB, but the mutant form is not as effective as wild-type PLB in suppressing cardiac relaxation parameters, assessed at the cellular, organ, and intact animal levels. This apparent discrepancy between biochemical and physiological findings may be explained by the following possibilities. 1) The assay used to measure initial rates of SR Ca2+ uptake is not sufficiently sensitive to detect small differences in Ca2+ affinity. 2) The Ca2+ uptake assay conditions in vitro do not adequately reflect the dynamic situation in vivo. 3) The pentameric form of PLB may induce a Ca2+ leak in SR membranes via PLB pentamers (7Arkin I.T.

These possibilities may be addressed in future studies designed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the differences between the regulatory effects of the C41F PLB mutant in SR Ca2+ transport assaysin vitro and in functional measurements in vivo. Phospholamban (PLB) 1The abbreviations used are: PLB, phospholamban; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; α-MHC, α-myosin heavy chain; kb, kilobase pairs; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; LVSP, left ventricular systolic pressure. 1The abbreviations used are: PLB, phospholamban; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; α-MHC, α-myosin heavy chain; kb, kilobase pairs; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; LVSP, left ventricular systolic pressure. is a transmembrane phosphoprotein that interacts with and reversibly inhibits the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-ATPase. Phosphorylation of PLB by β-adrenergic agonists removes its inhibition and therefore facilitates Ca2+ transport into the SR lumen, enhancing cardiac relaxation. The physiological importance of PLB has recently been elucidated using gene targeting (1Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) and transgenic methodology (2Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn II, G.W. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These studies showed that ablation of PLB was associated with augmentation of the SR Ca2+-ATPase affinity for Ca2+ and basal cardiac contractility as well as attenuation of the cardiac responses to β-adrenergic agonists. By contrast, the SR Ca2+-ATPase Ca2+ affinity and contractile parameters were greatly diminished in cardiomyocytes overexpressing PLB. Thus, biochemical and functional characterization of these animal models indicates that PLB is a major regulator of cardiac contractilityin vivo (3Koss K.L. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The functional unit of PLB in native SR membranes is presently unknown. Phospholamban was originally proposed to form homopentamers through interactions with its transmembrane domain in the SR, based on its migration pattern on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (4Wegener A.D. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1834-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Colyer J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1766-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Pentameric assembly has been further supported by site-directed mutagenesis studies in expression systems (6Fujii J. Maruyama K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12950-12955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), computational modeling (7Arkin I.T. Adams P.D. MacKenzie K.R. Lemmon M.A. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4757-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 8Adams P.D. Arkin I.T. Engelman D.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), gel filtration chromatography (9Harrer J.M. Kranias E.G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and EPR spectroscopy studies (10Cornea R.L. Jones L.R. Autry J.M. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2960-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Recently, alanine-scanning mutagenesis studies in expression systems showed that a monomeric form of PLB, in which Leu37 was changed to Ala, suppressed SR Ca2+-ATPase Ca2+affinity more effectively than wild-type or pentameric PLB (11Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 12Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). It was thus postulated that there might be an equilibrium between pentameric and monomeric PLB in SR membranes. Pentameric PLB may represent a less active reservoir, which dissociates to provide active monomeric PLB subunits. However, coexpression of other monomeric forms of PLB, associated with mutation of Cys41 to Phe or Ser, with SR Ca 2+-ATPase in HEK-293 cells failed to demonstrate superinhibition (or gain of function) by PLB monomers (13Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies indicated that a pentameric form of PLB, resulting from mutation of Asn27 to Ala, was more potent than a monomeric mutant (L37A) PLB in inhibiting the SR Ca2+-ATPase Ca2+ affinity (14Kirchhefer U. Autry J.M. Weumann J. Jones L.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): A358Google Scholar, 15Kimura Y. Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14238-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and suggested that the oligomeric structure of PLB may be important in SR Ca2+-ATPase regulation. These in vitro structure-function studies of PLB were recently extended to in vivo systems, and a transgenic mouse model overexpressing a monomeric form of PLB, associated with the mutation C41F, was developed in our laboratory (16Chu G. Dorn II, G.W. Luo W. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cardiac-specific overexpression of monomeric PLB was associated with less inhibition of the SR Ca2+-ATPase Ca2+ affinity, cardiomyocyte mechanics, and Ca2+ kinetics than overexpression of wild-type PLB. However, such studies are difficult to interpret since they are done in the presence of endogenous wild-type or pentameric PLB. The expressed monomers could either coexist with the endogenous pentamers or disrupt pentameric assembly, resulting in the observed phenotype. Thus, it was important to extend these findings to the PLB-deficient background and to reintroduce wild-type or monomeric (C41F) PLB in the cardiac compartment of the knockout mouse to better clarify the physiological effects of monomeric PLB. Our results indicate that although PLB monomers (C41F) inhibit the apparent affinity of the SR Ca2+ uptake system to the same extent as PLB pentamers, they are not as effective in inhibiting the rate of myocardial relaxation assessed in isolated cardiomyocytes, perfused hearts, or intact animals. DISCUSSIONThis study was designed to determine the functional unit of PLBin vivo by reintroducing wild-type (pentameric) or monomeric mutant (C41F) PLB into the cardiac compartment of PLB knockout mice. Although expression of either PLB form was capable of inhibiting the SR Ca2+-ATPase Ca2+ affinity to the same extent, our findings indicate that monomeric PLB was less effective than the pentameric form in reversing the enhanced relaxation parameters of the PLB knockout hearts.The availability of the PLB knockout mouse coupled with a strong cardiac-specific α-MHC promoter allowed us for the first time to assess the functional significance of pentameric or monomeric PLB in a background free of the endogenous protein in vivo. Transgenic lines expressing similar levels of mutant or wild-type PLB were chosen to assess the effects of each PLB form in a physiologically relevant manner. Calcium transport studies showed that wild-type or mutant PLB inhibited the apparent affinity of SR Ca2+-ATPase for Ca2+ to the same extent. Furthermore, there were no alterations in the maximal velocity of the enzyme, consistent with the finding that the levels of SERCA2 were similar between these transgenic lines. However, the pentameric form of PLB depressed the relaxation rate during the steady-state twitch and prolonged the Ca2+ transient decline to a greater extent than the mutant or monomeric PLB in isolated cardiomyocytes. Consistent with the findings at the cellular level, this differential effect was also observed in Langendorff perfused hearts. Furthermore, assessment of cardiac contractile parameters in the intact mouse revealed a greater depression of cardiac relaxation rates by wild-type PLB than by mutant PLB. These findings on cardiac contractile parameters were similar to previous results in models overexpressing similar levels of wild-type or mutant PLB in the presence of the endogenous protein (16Chu G. Dorn II, G.W. Luo W. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the findings on SR Ca2+ transport measurements were different from those in the overexpression models (16Chu G. Dorn II, G.W. Luo W. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Overexpression of pentameric PLB was more effective than that of monomeric PLB in inhibiting the initial rates of SR Ca2+transport, whereas reintroduction of either form of PLB in the null background inhibited this SR parameter to the same extent. The reason for this apparent discrepancy could be due to the following: 1) the stoichiometric ratio of PLB to SERCA2 (0.7 in the transgenic mice in this study versus 2.0 in the overexpression models compared with 1.0 in the wild-type mice), which may affect the nature of interaction between these proteins; 2) the coexistence of PLB pentamers and monomers in the overexpression models, which may mask the maximal inhibitory effects by monomers; 3) compensatory mechanisms, associated with altered PLB expression levels, which may be different between the knockout and overexpression models; and 4) the genetic background of the two models (129/SvJ and CF-1 for the knockout modelsversus FVB/N for the overexpression models), which may contain different modifier alleles.The C41F mutation, chosen in this study, was based on previous in vitro (13Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo (16Chu G. Dorn II, G.W. Luo W. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) studies, which indicated that this mutation resulted in pentamer destabilization and formation of PLB monomers as revealed by SDS-PAGE. However, it is not entirely clear whether the migration pattern of C41F versus wild-type PLB on SDS-polyacrylamide gels reflects the in vivosituation. Future studies using chemical cross-linking (24Young E.F. McKee M.J. Ferguson D.G. Kranias E.G. Memb. Biochem. 1989; 8: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), EPR spectroscopy (10Cornea R.L. Jones L.R. Autry J.M. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2960-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), or low-angle laser light scattering measurements in conjunction with high-performance gel chromatography (25Watanabe Y. Kijima Y. Kadoma M. Tada M. Takagi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) may provide further insights into the oligomeric/monomeric state of PLB in vivo and its molecular dynamics upon mutagenesis or phosphorylation. Furthermore, it could be argued that replacement of cysteine with phenylalanine, which has a bulky side chain, may diminish the inhibitory effects of monomeric (C41F) PLB on cardiac relaxation parameters due to its inefficient interaction with the SR Ca2+-ATPase. However, biochemical reactivity studies of the three Cys residues (Cys36, Cys41, and Cys46) in the transmembrane domain of wild-type (pentameric) PLB indicated that Cys36 and Cys46reacted with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), whereas Cys41 remained unreactive (26Karim C.B. Stamm J.D. Karim J. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12074-12081Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). When PLB was denatured or a monomeric (L37A) form of PLB was used, all three Cys residues including Cys41 reacted with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (26Karim C.B. Stamm J.D. Karim J. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12074-12081Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that Cys41 in wild-type PLB may be located within the pore of the PLB pentamer, which is protected and most insensitive to chemical modification. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that the PLB transmembrane helix is oriented with Cys36 and Cys46 projecting into the lipid hydrocarbon, thus allowing interaction with the SR Ca2+-ATPase, and Cys41 on the helix interface within the pentameric structure of PLB away from the binding region of SR Ca2+-ATPase. Thus, mutation of Cys41 to Phe should not alter the interface of the inhibitory domain of PLB with the SR Ca2+-ATPase and their physical interaction. This assumption is also supported by previous in vitro expression studies of SR Ca 2+-ATPase and PLB (13Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

We previously described the contribution of tyrosines within each of the two motifs (Tyr131 and Tyr322) to signal transduction and receptor internalization (Prado, G. N., Taylor, L., and Polgar, P. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 14638–14642). Here, we investigate the effect of exchanging both tyrosine residues simultaneously for alanine, phenylalanine, or serine, termed YAYA (Y131A/Y322A), YFYF (Y131F/Y322F), and YSYS (Y131S/Y322S) receptors, respectively. All of these mutants bound bradykinin (BK) normally, with a K d of approximately 1.1 nm. However, although phosphoinositide (PI) turnover in response to BK by Y131A and Y131S proved negligible, the YAYA mutant returned BK-activated PI turnover to wild type (WT). In contrast, PI turnover with YSYS remained unresponsive to BK. Importantly, the pattern of BK-activated arachidonate release differed markedly in the mutant receptors. For example, whereas Y131S ablated BK-activated arachidonic acid release, conversion of this mutant to YSYS returned the BK-activated receptor function to a level above that of WT. However, YAYA showed only a partial recovery from the poor BK response of Y131A. These and additional results suggest that Tyr131and Tyr322 interact cooperatively in conjunction with at least two separate signaling functions. Given these results, a molecular model of the receptor was generated with the IC2 and the proximal C terminus in close spatial proximity. Conformations were identified to provide structural explanation for these observations. The conserved Thr137 in the IC2 was next substituted with proline (T137P) to prevent phosphorylation at this position or with aspartate (T137D) to emulate phosphorylation. The T137P mutant demonstrated no change from WT with respect to either BK-activated PI turnover or arachidonic acid release. However, the mutant exhibited a markedly reduced capacity to internalize. It also resensitized poorly. The T137D mutant lacked both BK responsive activities. However, it internalized and resensitized normally, as did WT.

FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Desensitization prevents cells from uncontrolled stimulation, and resensitization allows cells to recover and maintain responsiveness (17Bohm S.K. Khitin L.M. Smeekens S.P. Grady E.F. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2363-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Both processes appear to be regulated at the receptor level. Recent studies by Haasemann et al. (18Haasemann M. Cartaud J. Muller-Esterl W. Dunia I. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 917-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that stimulation of BKB2R results in redistribution of the receptor and its internalization in caveolae (18Haasemann M. Cartaud J. Muller-Esterl W. Dunia I. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 917-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On/off regulatory elements have been identified in other receptors (19Nussenveig D.R. Heinflink M.

However, to date, no clear consensus motifs have been identified to determine either internalization or resensitization. The DRYXXI/VXXP motif located in the second intracellular loop (IC2) of the human muscarinic cholinergic receptor has been proposed as important for receptor internalization (23Moro O. Lameh J. Högger P. Sadée W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22273-22276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another important motif is the tyrosine-containing motif located in the proximal BKB2R C terminus. The motifs in this region have been implicated in receptor internalization in other GPCRs, such as neurokinin 1 receptor (17Bohm S.K. Khitin L.M. Smeekens S.P. Grady E.F. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. J.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 140-148PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous results showed that Tyr131 and Tyr322 are crucial for signal transduction (1Prado G.N. Taylor L. Polgar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14638-14642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Truncation of the distal C terminus of BKB2R exhibited normal BK-activated ARA release, PI turnover, and [Ca2+]i flux. Furthermore, our previous results showed that at least some of the structural elements involved in the internalization process are found in the IC2 and the proximal as well as distal C terminus (1Prado G.N. Taylor L. Polgar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14638-14642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Reports of the use of models of BKB2R to explore ligand binding have appeared in the literature (29Kyle D.J. Chakravarty S. Sinsko J.A. Stormann T.M. J. Med Chem. 1994; 37: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Doughty S.W. Reynolds C.A Biochem. Soc.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28277-28286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For example, Kyle et al. (29Kyle D.J. Chakravarty S. Sinsko J.A. Stormann T.M. J. Med Chem. 1994; 37: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) proposed that ligand binding to the receptor is in a twisted S shape with the C-terminal β-turn lodged inside the receptor. Doughty and Reynolds (30Doughty S.W. Reynolds C.A Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) generated a BKB2R model showing an interaction between TM6 and TM7 through an Arg281/Asp266 attraction. However, at this time, the conformational features of the intracellular loops and termini of the BKB2R have not been reported.Herein, we further investigate the relationship between Tyr131 and Tyr322 in terms of signaling, uptake, and resensitization. In conjunction with our results, we generated a molecular model of BKB2R with these two regions in close spatial proximity. We also investigate the role of an apparently critical threonine at position 137 in IC2. Alignment of GPCRs of the peptide subfamily shows that proline is generally conserved at this position. However, the position occupied by this proline is a tryptophan in endothelin receptors and a serine in galanin receptors. Our results suggest that threonine 137 participates in the regulation of BKB2R internalization and resensitization, whereas BKB2R desensitization does not involve this residue.DISCUSSIONWe have generated a number of mutants within the IC2 and proximal C terminus of the BKB2R. All constructs retained the binding kinetics of the WT receptor. However, the mutations showed marked and varied effects on BKB2R signal transduction, receptor internalization, and resensitization. These results suggest that no one motif within the IC face of the BKB2R is solely responsible for a given receptor function. Instead, cooperative interactions appear to be taking place among the various IC domains.For example, replacement of Tyr322, located at the proximal C terminus, with the small, uncharged alanine had little effect on either BK-stimulated ARA release or PI turnover. However, replacement with the small, hydroxyl-containing serine reduced both events markedly. Replacement of Tyr131 with serine also markedly reduced both events. However, when both tyrosine residues, Tyr131 and Tyr322, were mutated to serine (YSYS), the consequent reduction of a bulky residue only impaired the activation of phospholipase C. The double mutation did not affect receptor-stimulated ARA release. In contrast, double mutation of Tyr131 and Tyr322 residues to alanine (YAYA) impaired ARA release but not PI turnover. In this case, a hydrophobic residue at both locations promotes phospholipase C action but hinders the release of ARA. However, a double substitution with phenylalanine, a bulky hydrophobic residue, hinders both signaling pathways. These results demonstrate that discrete sequences within the DRY motif of IC2 and the tyrosine-based motif in the proximal C terminus interact with each other and cause differential effects on BK-activated signal pathways. A possible explanation for this differential signaling is that Tyr322 of the BKB2R is phosphorylated and acts like the YIPP motif, similarly found in the proximal C tail of the AT1 receptor (41Venema R.C. Ju H. Venema V.J. Schieffer B. Harp J.B. Ling B.N. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7703-7708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, our results and results reported by Blaukatet al. (42Blaukat A. Alla S.A. Lohse M.J. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32366-32374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) indicate that this tyrosine residue is not phosphorylated. A more solid explanation is that the two IC regions are cooperatively involved in coupling to more than a single subset of G protein (Gq, Gi, or Gi-like proteins). Interaction between the IC loops and the proximal C tail has been proposed in other GPCRs (43Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). In the β2-adrenergic receptor, the C-terminal portion of IC3 and the proximal C tail are important for Gs activation (44O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Regan J.W. Leader W.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15985-15992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the BKB2R, a small hydrophobic residue such as alanine at Tyr131 and Tyr322 favors interaction with a G protein responsible for PI turnover (Gq). In all, residue size, hydrophobicity, and charge at these positions play important roles in signal transduction. Another example to illustrate the effect of charge is the substitution of the hydrophilic threonine residue at location 137 with either proline or aspartate. Exchange of threonine for proline had no effect on either ARA release or PI turnover. However, the T137D mutant receptor, which displays a negative charge, showed impaired PI turnover and ARA release. Our previous studies demonstrated that point mutations at Tyr131 to serine, alanine, or phenylalanine also affected the rate of receptor internalization as compared with that of WT (1Prado G.N. Taylor L. Polgar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14638-14642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Y131A displayed the slowest rate of uptake, whereas Y131S displayed a rate considerably faster than WT. Our present results further demonstrate that the double mutant YAYA also displayed a very slow rate of uptake, notably slower than WT or the other double mutants. These results confirm the importance of the DRY region in receptor internalization. Apparently, mutant receptors that display either the slowest or the most rapid rates of receptor internalization still show a degree of PI turnover similar to that of WT receptor. This suggests that signal transduction in relation to the Tyr131/Tyr322 interaction is not involved directly with receptor uptake. A similar lack of correlation between internalization and signal transduction was observed in muscarinic (18Haasemann M. Cartaud J. Muller-Esterl W. Dunia I. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 917-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), angiotensin/AT1 (45Hunyady L. Bor M. Baukal A.J. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16602-16609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and β2-adrenergic receptors (46Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar).To further understand the role of IC2 in receptor uptake, we investigated the DRYXXI/VXXPφ motif as proposed in muscarinic cholinergic receptor (23Moro O. Lameh J. Högger P. Sadée W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22273-22276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We aligned this motif with 184 GPCRs belonging to the peptide subfamily. We found that proline is conserved in 71% of the receptors. Conversion of threonine in the BKB2R to proline resulted in a complete loss of receptor uptake. However, substitution of proline at this site did not affect signal transduction. Substitution with a negatively charged aspartate to generate T137D reversed these effects. T137D did not stimulate ARA release or PI turnover but returned receptor uptake to that of WT. This result points to the importance of a negative charge at this site and suggests that phosphorylation at Thr137 participates in termination of receptor function and initiation of receptor uptake. Blaukat et al. (42Blaukat A. Alla S.A. Lohse M.J. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32366-32374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) demonstrated threonine/serine phosphorylation to be taking place in conjunction with BKB2R internalization and resensitization.Our results further suggest that internalization and resensitization are linked, whereas desensitization is a more complicated process related to specific metabolic events regulated by BK. When resensitization was tested by measuring [Ca2+]i, T137P, which was only minimally taken up even after 60 min, showed no resensitization. On the other hand, YFYF, with a moderate rate of internalization, resensitized similarly to WT. YAYA, which was also taken up poorly, but not to the extreme of T137P, resensitized somewhere between YFYF and T137P. It remains to be resolved which receptor motif(s) determine internalization, which determine desensitization, and what correlation exists between these two actions.Our present and previous results, in sum, clearly indicate cooperativity or interaction between the C-terminal tail and IC2 of the receptor. We postulate the presence of α-helices (for the C terminus) and a β-turn (residues 137–138 of IC2) based on homology analysis with structurally defined proteins, following a procedure recently reported for the κ-opiate receptor (36Paterlini G. Portoghese P.S. Ferguson D.M. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 3254-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the relative orientation of the loops and termini, containing the α-helices or β-turns, needs to be established. The aim of our modeling effort is to investigate the conformations with these two regions (IC2 and C terminus) in close proximity. Given the constraints (i.e.presence of the α-helices and β-turn), we looked for conformations that are energetically feasible. There are three possible orientations that would place the C-terminal helix (residues 310–329) in close proximity to Tyr131: it could lie 1) on the membrane surface near TM6-TM5, 2) on the membrane surface near TM1-TM2, or (3Eggerickx D. Raspe E. Bertrand D. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1306-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) across the cytoplasmic ends of the helix bundle. All attempts at placing the C-terminal helix toward TM1-TM2 failed. The topological orientation of the helical bundle does not allow for Tyr131and Tyr322 to come close without disrupting the C-terminal helix or the TM bundle. In contrast, during the simulations starting with the other two orientations, low energy conformations were adapted early and maintained for the remainder of the 200 ps of MD simulation. Of these two, we prefer the first, in which the C-terminal helix lies on the membrane surface, mimicked by a layer of decane molecules in the simulation, near TM6-TM5. In the resulting structure, the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic C-terminal helix projects into the membrane surface. This conformation also places Cys326, postulated to be a site of palmitoylation, adjacent to the membrane surface. One role of the palmitoylation of this residue would be to securely anchor this helix to the membrane surface. Based on this, we exclude the low energy conformations that place the α-helix of the C terminus across the helix bundle, even though from an energetic perspective based on the MD simulations, it is feasible. In Fig. 9, two views of the resulting conformation from the MD simulation, placing Tyr131 and Tyr322 8.1 Å distal from each other, are shown. The resulting conformation places IC3 juxtaposed to IC2 and the C terminus. This is important given the well documented role of IC3 in coupling to the G proteins.Concerning Thr137 and the β-turn, the resulting conformations have this turn well exposed, projecting down into the solvent, readily available for phosphorylation. Mutations at this position indicate that following receptor activation, leading to signal transduction, phosphorylation at this position results in termination of the activated receptor structure. This termination is then followed by internalization and potential resensitization of the receptor. A model of the T137P mutation suggests that it stabilizes the β-turn structure, while removing the possibility of phosphorylation.In summary, our results using BKB2R mutant receptors and consequent molecular modeling involving the distal IC2 and proximal C terminus point to important interaction between these two regions, not only with regard to regulation of signal transduction but also in conjunction with receptor internalization and resensitization. Apparently, the motifs encompassing Tyr131 and Tyr322, perhaps in conjunction with elements within the IC3, dictate BKB2R-G protein interaction.

Its expression in muscle cells is induced by the binding of the positive regulators serum response factor and dystrophin promoter bending factor (DPBF) on a regulatory CArG element present on the promoter. Here we show that the dystrophin CArG box is also recognized by the zinc finger nuclear factor YY1. Transient transfection experiments show that YY1 negatively regulates dystrophin transcription in C2C12 muscle cells. On the dystrophin CArG element YY1 competes with the structural factor DPBF. We further show that YY1 and DPBF binding to the CArG element induce opposite DNA bends suggesting that their binding induces alternative promoter structures. Along with C2C12 myotube formation YY1 is reduced and we observed that YY1, but not DPBF, is a substrate of m-calpain, a protease that is up-regulated in muscle cell differentiation. Thus, high levels of YY1 in non-differentiated muscle cells down-regulate the dystrophin promoter, at least in part, by interfering with the spatial organization of the promoter.

The dystrophin gene, which is altered in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies, is transcribed in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells from a muscle-specific promoter (1Nudel U. Robzik K. Yaffe D.

The minimal dystrophin promoter (−96 to +30) drives the transcription of the CAT reporter gene preferentially in muscle cells, and it is induced by muscle cell differentiation from myoblasts to myotubes (4Gilgenkrantz H.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1731-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The main regulatory element of the dystrophin promoter is a CArG box that is recognized by the serum response factor (SRF), 1The abbreviations used are: SRF, serum response factor; SRE, serum response element; DPBF, dystrophin promoter bending factor; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: SRF, serum response factor; SRE, serum response element; DPBF, dystrophin promoter bending factor; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair(s). which requires the activity of the dystrophin promoter bending factor (DPBF). The latter acts as an architectural component that alters the promoter structure and enhances dystrophin transcription probably facilitating interactions between SRF and the other components of the transcriptional complex (5Galvagni F. Lestingi M. Cartocci E. Oliviero S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1731-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A CArG element was first found in the c-fos promoter where it has been named serum response element (SRE) because of its ability to respond to serum stimulation signaling (6Treisman R. Cell. 1986; 46: 567-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). CArG elements are also present in several muscle-specific promoters (7Boxer L.M. Prywes R. Roeder R. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 8Sartorelli V. Webster K. Kedes L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1811-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 9Moss J.B.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Indication of SRF involvement in muscle-specific transcription is also suggested by its pattern of expression since SRF is mainly expressed in myogenic tissues (16Croissant J.D. Kim J.H. Eichele G.

Moreover, SRF interacts with muscle-specific factors including myogenin, MyoD, and Nkx-2.5 (18Groisman R. Masutani H. Leibovitch M.-P. Robin P. Soudant I. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol.

CArG elements can also be recognized by the nuclear factor YY1. YY1 is a zinc finger protein that binds the DNA with a high degree of flexibility in its DNA recognition (21Hyde-DeRuyscher R.P. Jennings E. Shenk T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4457-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It can act as a transcriptional repressor or activator and, when binding at the initiator element, it becomes a component of the basal transcription complex (22Shi Y. Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: 49-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 23Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.-S. Shenk T.

YY1 interacts with several transcription factors including Sp1, c-Myc, p300, TAFII55, ATF/CREB, and TFIIB and with the histone deacetylase HDA2/mRPD3, suggesting that YY1 activation or repression might be mediated by these interactions (26Seto E.

Moreover, YY1 has been found associated with the matrix suggesting that it may mediate gene-matrix interactions by linking the promoter with nuclear matrix-associated proteins (34Guo B. Odgren P.R. van Wijnen A.J. Last T.J. Nickerson J. Penman S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10526-10530Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). On the c-fos promoter YY1 binds to three different sites (31Lee J.-K. Galvin k.M. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6145-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 35Gualberto A.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2497-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Because the activity of at least one of these sites was dependent on the orientation of its binding site, it was proposed that the different effects of YY1 on transcription could be due to its ability to bend DNA (36Natesan S. Gilman M.Z. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2497-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). On the muscle-specific CArG element YY1 acts as a repressor and it was proposed that YY1-dependent repression was due to its competitive binding with SRF (35Gualberto A. Le Page D. Pons G. Mader S.L. Park K. Atchison M.L. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4209-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 37Lee T.C. Shi Y. Schwartz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here we analyzed the developmentally regulated muscle-specific dystrophin promoter. We present evidence that the dystrophin CArG box is recognized by YY1, which acts as a negative regulator of the dystrophin promoter. We further show that YY1 competes for binding with the structural factor DPBF. Moreover, YY1 and DPBF bend DNA in opposite orientations with respect to a fixed bend. These results suggest that YY1 and DPBF regulate the dystrophin promoter transcription negatively or positively by competing with each other, at least in part, by alternatively organizing the DNA structure. To generate the DMD-CAT constructs the dystrophin core promoter was amplified as described previously (5Galvagni F. Lestingi M. Cartocci E. Oliviero S. Mol. Cell.

All the plasmid structures were verified by sequencing. C2C12 myoblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection of the promoter CAT constructs was performed by the standard calcium phosphate method. Typically, a transfection experiment included 2 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.75 μg of RSV-LacZ plasmid as transfection efficiency control (41Cherrington J.M. Mocarski E.S. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1435-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated increasing amounts of expression plasmids (1, 2, and 4 μg) were added. The amount of transfected plasmids was held constant by the addition of pcDNA3. After transfection, the differentiation of C2C12 cells into myotubes was allowed by changing growth medium to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum. CAT activity was determined as described previously (42Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). Acetylated forms of chloramphenicol were quantified by scanning the thin-layer chromatography plates using the Molecular Dynamics Image Quant radioanalytic system. A minimum of four independent transfection experiments were performed with independent DNA preparations. The activity of the wild type dystrophin promoter (−93 DMD-CAT) was about 120% in C2C12 cells with respect to the pSV40-CAT used as positive control. Preparation of nuclear extracts was performed as described previously (43Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Shaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). Cold in vitrotranslated proteins were prepared using the TnTTM Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's description. The construct FG236 (5Galvagni F. Lestingi M. Cartocci E. Oliviero S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1731-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was used for the synthesis of YY1 and the plasmid pCITE-2a (Novagen) for the mock reaction. YY1 was expressed in E. coli as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein, purified by glutathione affinity chromatography and eluted from the column by adding 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and the GST domain was removed by thrombin digestion (0.01 unit/μl for 45 min at room temperature). The amount of protein recovered was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue and comparison with protein standards. DPBF was obtained from C2C12 nuclear extracts and purified as described previously (5Galvagni F. Lestingi M. Cartocci E. Oliviero S. Mol. Cell.

The probe utilized was obtained by terminal labeling of annealed oligonucleotides. Binding reactions (20 μl) contained 10 μg of nuclear extracts and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 5 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. For assays containing proteins produced by in vitro translation, 1 μl of reticulocyte lysate was used for a standard binding reaction with 200 ng of calf thymus DNA. Complexes were allowed to form for 10 min on ice, and 5 μl of Ficoll 20% were added before being resolved on 6% 39:1 acrylamide-bisacrylamide gels in 0.5% Tris borate-EDTA. Where indicated, 1 μl of anti-YY1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) was added in the reaction mixture. The gel mobility shift reactions of Fig. 4 contained 10 mmTris (pH 7.9), 5 mm MgCl2, 60 mmKCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and the amount of recombinant proteins indicated in the legend. The calpain cleavage assay was performed by adding 1 μl of purified m-calpain (Calbiochem) and incubating the reaction at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of CaCl2 (2 mm final). DNA probes for phasing analysis were prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplifications, using the external primers (11Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R.

The binding reactions were performed as described for the gel mobility shift assays, and the complexes were resolved on 8% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5% Tris borate-EDTA. The mobilities of free DNA and protein-DNA complexes were determined by measuring the distances traveled from the origin of the gel, and the ratios were plotted as a function of the spacer length. Curve fitting was carried out using the program CA-Cricket Graph III. The minimal dystrophin promoter transcriptional activation in muscle cells depends on a CArG box, which is in part similar to the c-fosSRE. Both SRE and dystrophin CArG boxes are recognized by SRF while the ternary complex factor TCF and the bending factor DPBF are specific for the SRE and for the dystrophin CArG element, respectively (5Galvagni F. Lestingi M. Cartocci E. Oliviero S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1731-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To test whether in addition to SRF other proteins bind to both elements we performed competition experiments with the c-fos SRE on the dystrophin CArG. Using electrophoretic mobility retardation assays with nuclear extracts of C2C12 cells and a probe spanning positions −93 to −68 of the dystrophin promoter (CArG) we identified three distinct retarded complexes. The slower and the faster migrating complexes contained SRF and DPBF nuclear factors, respectively (5Galvagni F. Lestingi M. Cartocci E. Oliviero S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1731-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Competition with 100-fold molar excess of a cold double-stranded oligonucleotide carrying the c-fos SRE, which is recognized by both SRF and YY1 (35Gualberto A. Le Page D. Pons G. Mader S.L. Park K. Atchison M.L. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4209-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), abolished both the slower and intermediate migrating bands (Fig. 1 A, lane 3) suggesting that the band with intermediate mobility contained YY1. The addition of polyclonal anti-YY1 antibodies specifically inhibited the formation of the intermediate complex (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). To verify further that YY1 binds to the dystrophin CArG box we performed band shift experiments with in vitro synthesized YY1. YY1 synthesized in vitro recognized both the SRE and the dystrophin CArG element (Fig. 1 C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that YY1 specifically recognizes the dystrophin CArG element. In C2C12 muscle cells the dystrophin promoter containing the CArG element is induced by cell differentiation in vitro by about 4-fold. This induction is mediated by the CArG element since a deleted promoter lacking the CArG box shows a reduced transcriptional activity and is no longer induced by cell differentiation (Fig. 2 A). The promoter activation correlates with a down modulation of YY1 in cells treated in the same way (Fig. 2 B). We therefore tested whether the overexpression of YY1 in differentiated cells would play a negative role on promoter transcription. We cotransfected, in C2C12 muscle cells, an expression vector in which the YY1 cDNA was cloned under the control of the viral CMV promoter (CMV-YY1) with the minimal dystrophin promoter fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (−93 DMD-CAT). Increasing amounts of CMV-YY1 negatively regulated the expression of the DMD-CAT construct, but not the promoter lacking the CArG element −72 DMD-CAT (Fig. 3). Moreover, increasing amounts of the plasmid carrying the YY1 in the antisense orientation (CMV-ReY) did not affect the activity of the −93 DMD-CAT construct thereby excluding the possibility that cryptical plasmid sequences affected dystrophin promoter activity. Thus, YY1 has a negative effect on the dystrophin transcription, and its repression is mediated by the CArG element. The partial overlap of the proteins binding to the dystrophin CArG element suggested that these proteins might influence their binding. Competitive binding between YY1 and SRF was described previously for other muscle-specific CArG elements (35Gualberto A. Le Page D. Pons G. Mader S.L. Park K. Atchison M.L. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4209-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 37Lee T.C. Shi Y. Schwartz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9814-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 38Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 812-822PubMed Google Scholar). As on the dystrophin promoter, the YY1 binding site partially overlaps with the DPBF binding site, we investigated whether YY1 could interfere with the binding of DPBF. In band shift experiments the binding of DPBF to the dystrophin promoter was negatively influenced by the addition of YY1 to the binding mixture (Fig. 4, comparelanes 4-6 with 1–3). Thus, YY1 competes with DPBF for the binding on the dystrophin CArG box suggesting that their binding on the promoter is mutually exclusive. Since both YY1 and DPBF induce bending of the DNA we investigated the structural changes induced by these proteins. YY1 bends the DNA approximately 80°, and it was suggested that its binding could influence the interactions between proteins bound to the two flanking elements (36Natesan S. Gilman M.Z. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2497-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The binding of DPBF to the dystrophin promoter induces a bend of approximately 60° in the double helix axis with a bend center in the stretch of three A nucleotides between positions −79 and −78 just downstream of the CArG box, and its binding acts positively on dystrophin transcription (Fig. 1 D) (5Galvagni F. Lestingi M. Cartocci E. Oliviero S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1731-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As the YY1 center of bending is between the C and A nucleotides of the CCAT core on the dystrophin promoter this position would be between −84 and −83 at about 4 bases upstream with respect to the DPBF-induced bending (Fig.1 D). To test the hypothesis that these proteins induce a definite bending and to measure the angle induced by each protein with respect to a fixed bend, we performed phasing analysis with each protein on the same DNA probe. The probes used for the phasing analysis contain an intrinsic bend induced by an AT-rich track at different distances from the binding site of interest and thereby vary the helical phasing of the two sequences. If the DNA-protein complex under investigation contains a bend, its relative mobility will vary such that it is lowest when the two bends have the same orientation (in-phase) and highest when the two bends have an opposite orientation (out-of-phase) (40Drak J. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3074-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 44Zinkel S.S. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We prepared six probes carrying the AT-rich sequence separated by a set of spacers (10 to 20 base pairs) from the CArG box. The complexes formed independently with YY1 or DPBF were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fig.5, A and B, shows the results of the phasing analysis of YY1 and DPBF, respectively. To determine the relative orientations of the protein-induced DNA bend, the relative mobilities of the complexes were plotted as a function of the spacer length (Fig. 5, C and D). The minima of the curves, corresponding to the minimal relative mobilities of the complexes, were obtained with a spacer of 12 bp and of 16 bp for the complexes containing YY1 and DPBF, respectively. Since the difference between these two spacers is 4 bp and the turn of the DNA helix is on average 10.5 bp, YY1 and DPBF proved to bend the promoter DNA in almost opposite orientations. Previous studies demonstrated that YY1, but not SRF, decreases during muscle-cell development and argue that YY1 reduction is due to its proteolytic degradation in differentiated muscle cells by the calcium-activated protease m-calpain, which is supported by the fact that m-calpain selectively cleaved YY1 but not SRF (37Lee T.C. Shi Y. Schwartz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9814-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 45Kalenik J.L. Chen D. Bradley M.E. Chen S.J. Lee T.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Moreover, the activity of m-calpain is up-regulated during myogenic differentiation and correlates with myoblast fusion (46Kwak K.B. Chung S.S. Kim O.M. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1175: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 47Brustis J.J. Elamrani N. Balcerzak D. Safwate A. Soriano M. Poussard S. Cottin P. Ducastaing A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 64: 320-327PubMed Google Scholar, 48Balcerzak D. Poussard S. Brustis J.J. Elamrani N. Soriano M. Cottin P. Ducastaing A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2077-2082PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that if the degradation of YY1 is involved in the mechanisms associated with the release of transcriptional repression of muscle-specific genes during myogenic differentiation, and that DPBF plays an antagonistic role with respect to YY1, DPBF, like SRF, should be insensitive to proteolytical degradation by m-calpain. In band shift experiments the incubation of YY1 with m-calpain in the reaction mixture reduced the intensity of the retarded complex (Fig.6, lane 2). Under the same conditions, the complex containing DPBF was not affected (lane 5). To establish that the effect observed was due to the proteolytic activity of m-calpain and not, for example, due to a nonspecific inhibition of the binding capacity, we reproduced the reaction in the presence of leupeptin, an inhibitor ofm-calpain activity (49Kumar A. Shafiq S. Wadgaonkar A. Stracher A. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1992; 38: 477-483PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of leupeptin in the reaction is sufficient to prevent the loss of YY1 binding. Thus, unlike YY1, DPBF is not proteolytically degraded by m-calpain. The dystrophin muscle-specific promoter drives transcription in a developmental specific manner. Up-regulation of the promoter correlates with down-regulation of the nuclear factor YY1. We provide evidence that increased transcription of dystrophin is mediated by the release of YY1 repression during muscle cell differentiation in vitro. We show that the structural factors YY1 and DPBF bind competitively to the promoter and induce different bends of the DNA. Thus, the substitution of YY1 with DPBF, during muscle cell development, induces a change in the DNA structure. We propose that this structural change contributes to transcriptional activation of the dystrophin promoter. The nuclear factor YY1 is developmentally down-regulated during muscle differentiation, and it was proposed that YY1 reduction in differentiated myotubes is due to its proteolytic degradation (37Lee T.C. Shi Y. Schwartz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9814-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 45Kalenik J.L. Chen D. Bradley M.E. Chen S.J. Lee T.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the idea that high levels of YY1 in non-differentiated myoblasts keep several muscle-specific genes at a low level of transcription, and upon differentiation, YY1-specific degradation allows the expression of genes at late stages. We observed that YY1 binds directly to the dystrophin CArG element. This binding was shown both with nuclear extracts and also with in vitrosynthesized YY1 suggesting that recognition of the dystrophin CArG box by YY1 does not need accessory factors. Binding of YY1 to the dystrophin promoter may have a functional role since promoter activation correlates with a reduction in YY1 levels in C2C12 differentiated to form myotubes. In fact, cotransfection experiments demonstrated a negative effect of YY1 on the dystrophin promoter suggesting that the binding of YY1 to the CArG element is responsible for promoter repression. This was corroborated by the observation that deletion of the CArG element abolished both promoter activation during myogenic differentiation and YY1 repression. CArG elements are present in the promoters of many genes including serum-responsive genes and several muscle-specific genes. The muscle-specific dystrophin CArG element is recognized by SRF and by the structural factor DPBF, which works as a SRF accessory factor. Thus, unlike the c-fos SRE, in which full activation of the promoter is obtained following binding of the TCF accessory factor, transcriptional activation of the dystrophin promoter requires DPBF (5Galvagni F. Lestingi M. Cartocci E. Oliviero S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1731-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We observed that, on the dystrophin promoter, YY1 competes with DPBF. In support of the hypothesis that during myogenic differentiation calpain-dependent reduction of YY1 may release the promoter repression we observed that YY1, but not DPBF, is selectively degraded by calcium-activated m-calpain. Both YY1 and DPBF are bending factors and exert an opposite effect on promoter transcription. This led us to explore the possibility that bending could be relevant for promoter activity. Phasing analysis revealed that both these proteins induce a detectable bend when they recognize the dystrophin CArG element. However, when binding on the dystrophin CArG element, these factors bend the DNA in opposite directions suggesting that the alternative bending induced by YY1 or DPBF has opposite effects on promoter structure. Thus, it is likely that the alternative binding of YY1 and DPBF to the promoter contributes to promoter regulation by the induction of structural changes. Indirect evidence that the promoter structure is crucial for its proper activity was also observed by base insertions of different lengths between the CArG element and the TATA box: all insertions tested resulted in promoter down-regulation, 2F. Galvagni, unpublished observations. suggesting that the distance between elements of the promoter is crucial for the proper assembly of the various components of the transcription machinery. It is possible that, as cellular DNA is organized in chromatin, the differential bending induced by these factors plays a role in promoter accessibility. Thus, the alternative binding of YY1 or DPBF as structural factors may lead to the formation of highly specific alternative complexes by recruiting specific proteins on the promoter. Several nuclear factors as well as histone deacetylase and matrix components are known to interact with YY1 (22Shi Y. Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Biochim. Biophys.

From this perspective, only a subset of these factors would be selected on the dystrophin promoter by YY1 because of structural constraints. The reduction of YY1 during myogenic differentiation would lead to DPBF binding to the dystrophin CArG element. The alternative bending induced by DPBF on the promoter and its specific protein-protein interactions would lead to the formation of a specific transcriptionally active assembly complex. It is conceivable that some components are in common between these alternative complexes on the CArG element, and a simple change in the helical phasing is sufficient to determine the proper stereochemical organization for either repression or activation. Future experiments will address this model. For example it will be interesting to test whether both YY1 and DPBF are able to recognize the DNA organized in nucleosomal structures and facilitate the access of different regulatory factors by exposing the DNA on the nucleosome.

The enzyme creatine kinase (CK 1The abbreviations used are: CK, creatine kinase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); Cr, creatine; PCr, phosphocreatine. ; EC 2.7.3.2) plays a key role in the energy metabolism of cells that have fluctuating energy requirements (for a review, see Ref. 1Wallimann T.

The cytosolic forms are called M-CK (muscle) and B-CK (brain) and can dimerize with each other (4Eppenberger H.M. Dawson D.M. Kaplan N.O. J. Biol.

The four CK isoenzymes of teleost fish are termed CK-A to CK-D and are all of cytoplasmic origin. CK-A, CK-C, and CK-D are expressed predominantly in striated muscle, stomach, and testis, respectively, while CK-B is expressed ubiquitously or is confined to neural tissue (18Fisher S.E. Whitt G.S.

Based on a comparison of the tissue specificity of expression of the various isoenzymes, it has been hypothesized that CK-II of frogs and CK-A of fish correspond to M-CK of mammals and birds, while CK-IV and CK-C correspond to B-CK (23Wolff J.

Although the existence of more than one subisoform of each CK isoenzyme has been demonstrated in fish by starch gel electrophoresis, this is the first time that the cloning of more than one M-CK subisoform cDNA in any organism has been reported (25Ferris S.D.

We have explored the possible existence of CK gene families in teleost fish, and so far, we have cloned three M-CK subisoforms and four B-CK subisoforms. Here, we report the nucleotide sequences; the predicted amino acid sequences of the three subisoforms of M-CK along with data on their tissue distribution; and the E. coli-expressed recombinant M-CK protein catalytic activities. Also, since the common carp is a poikilothermic fish, we have focused our attention on the catalytic activity of the E. coli-expressed recombinant M-CK proteins of carp at various temperatures. Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were maintained in tanks of circulating aerated water at 25 °C for 3 months under a 12-h day length and were fed a commercial diet. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from striated muscle of the common carp by an established procedure (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Ann. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref Scopus (63191) Google Scholar).

Preliminary Northern blot analysis using the PCR product (663 bp) as a probe revealed that it was expressed in carp striated muscle. After in vitro packaging, 1 × 106primary phages were amplified and plated at a density of ∼50,000 plaques/plate (15 cm), with 12 plates being screened. The probe was prepared by rediPrime labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out in standard hybridization buffer at 42 °C for 16 h (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Filters were finally washed with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 h twice at 65 °C. Positive clones were isolated, purified, and sequenced. The nucleotide sequences were determined by doubled-stranded sequencing according to the dideoxy chain termination method using an ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). The nucleotide sequences were then analyzed with an Applied Biosystems 377A automated DNA sequencer. A sequence homology search and comparison were performed with computer programs of the GCG sequence analysis software package (Genetic Computer Group, Madison, WI). The homologous sequences searched included GenBankTM accession numbers M11660 (dog M-CK), X03233 (mouse M-CK), M10140 (rat M-CK), M14780 (human M-CK),M10012 (chicken M-CK), M11508 (Torpedo M-CK), M14400 (rat B-CK), X59736 (rat Mis-CK), and X57937 (rat Miu-CK). Genomic DNA was prepared from carp muscle tissue with the proteinase K method (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Southern blotting with nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C super, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was carried out following standard procedures from Maniatis et al. (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction digestion of genomic and plasmid DNA was carried out overnight according to the manufacturer's specifications (New England Biolabs). Oligodeoxynucleotide probes were designed to cover the region 27 nucleotides after the stop codon of the three CK cDNAs that contained the most variable sequences (for M1-CK, 5′-AGC GGG GAG CCC TTC CAT TTT TTT CTA-3′; for M2-CK, 5′-AGC GGG AGC CCT TCC TCT TTT TTC CTC-3′; and for M3-CK, 5′-AAT GGC AGA AGT GCT TTT CTT TTT TTA-3′). Each probe was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to a specific activity of approximately 4 × 106 cpm/ml using bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The membranes were hybridized at a high stringency temperature (TH) (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out in standard hybridization buffer at 65 °C for 16 h (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The filters were finally washed with 6× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 52 °C. The membranes were exposed to a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Total RNA was isolated by the acid guanidinium isothiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels, and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C super, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). Probes of different M-CK subisoforms were prepared with the entire 3′-UTRs as templates and labeled by the rediPrime labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C overnight in standard hybridization buffer with 50% formamide (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). After hybridization, the membrane was finally washed twice at 68 °C for 15 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. The membrane was exposed to a PhosphorImager. The three full-length carp M-CK cDNA coding regions were amplified by PCR. To facilitate directional subcloning into the expression vector, forward and reverse primers were designed to contain restriction sites for NdeI andEcoRI at the 5′- and 3′-termini, respectively (BamHI for the 5′-terminal of M2-CK). Both restriction sites were absent in the M-CK cDNAs. The cDNA products were ligated into the pET-28a(+) expression vector (Novagen), in which prokaryotic gene expression is driven by the T7 lac promoter. Nucleotide sequencing was carried out to ensure the absence of PCR-induced mutation. Strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS bacteria were transformed with the resulting cDNA constructs and screened for positive clones. The bacterial cultures were grown in LB broth untilA 600 = 0.3 and then were induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. The bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) containing 5 mm imidazole and 0.5 m NaCl, and ultrasonicated. Purification of recombinant protein was achieved by chromatography on His-Bind resin (Novagen) following the pET system manual (Novagen). The eluted protein was dialyzed with 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 50 μm EDTA, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and then concentrated 10-fold by a YM-10 filter (Amicom). Polyclonal goat anti-human creatine kinase MM isoenzyme was purchased from BIODESIGN. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to the method of Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue (Sigma) and then electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter (Millipore Corp.) (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). The blotted filter was incubated in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, and 3% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Sigma) for 1 h. The filter was incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-M-CK serum, followed by interaction with anti-goat IgG alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody as a secondary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and staining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (Pierce) and nitro blue tetrazolium (Pierce). Protein concentration determination was performed using the Bradford method (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the protein standard (Pierce). Creatine kinase activities were determined by the direct enzyme activity assay, which measured the creatine (Cr) concentration formed in the reverse reaction, PCr + ADP → Cr + ATP, using the colorimetric detection method (31Hughes B.P. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1962; 7: 579-603Crossref Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 32Steeghs K. Benders A. Oerlemans F. de Haan A. Heerschap A. Jost C. Ruitenbeek W. Jost C. van Deursen J. Bruckwilder M. Koudijs J. Jap P. Veerkamp J. Wieringa B. Cell. 1997; 89: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Samples of the recombinant protein were diluted 1:100 in a buffer containing 30 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 50 μm EDTA, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Reagents were from the creatine kinase isoenzyme colorimetric detection kit (Sigma Diagnostics) and were used according to the manufacturer's instructions modified for optimum assay conditions. Reaction mixtures containing 20 mm phosphocreatine (PCr) and 4 mmADP were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and then α-naphthol solution and diacetyl solution were added and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The sample was measured atA 520. CK activity was determined from the creatine standard calibration curve. One enzyme unit corresponds to 1 μmol of creatine formed per min at pH 7.0 and 25 °C. Under this condition, the analysis of the three subisoforms of carp M-CK isoenzymes at different temperatures was carried out. The same direct enzyme assay was used in the kinetic experiments. Reaction conditions for each individual kinetic experiment are described under “Results.” The influence of PCr and ADP concentrations on creatine kinase activity was studied at 25 °C in Trizma (Tris base) buffer (with Mg2+ion) (Sigma). K m for PCr was determined with various PCr (Sigma) concentrations (from 0.5 to 15 mm) and a fixed ADP (Sigma) concentration (4 mm). K m for ADP was determined with various ADP concentrations (from 0.1 to 10 mm) and a fixed PCr concentration (15 mm). For the determination of all kinetic parameters, initial velocity data were analyzed using the EZ-FIT program package by Perrella (33Perrella F.W. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Values ofK m for PCr and ADP and ofV max were calculated by a Lineweaver-Burk plot of three series of independent measurements. S.E. values for calculatedK m and V max values are given. The λ ZAPII cDNA library constructed from poly(A) mRNA of carp striated muscle was screened with a PCR-synthesized nucleotide probe. After the first, second, and third screening, we selected 12 clones for further analysis, and they could be grouped into three PstI restriction patterns. One clone from each group of the cDNAs, designated M1-CK, M2-CK, and M3-CK was picked, and subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis. The lengths for these three cDNA inserts, excluding the poly(A), were 1559, 1580, and 1508 bp for M1-CK, M2-CK, and M3-CK, respectively (Fig. 1). The presumptive polyadenylation signal, ATAAA, was located at nucleotides 1528–1532 and 1541–1545 for M1-CK, nucleotides 1549–1553 and 1562–1566 for M2-CK, and nucleotides 1516–1520 for M3-CK. The lengths of the open reading frame were 1146, 1146, and 1143 bp for M1-CK, M2-CK, and M3-CK, respectively. The homology of the open reading frame nucleotide sequences of M1-CK, M2-CK, and M3-CK was 80% identity to dog and human M-CKs, and this result indicates that these three cDNA inserts represent the muscle form creatine kinase cDNAs (Table I). Nucleotide homology comparison of these carp cDNAs among themselves and with the M-CK, B-CK, Miu-CK, and Mis-CK cDNAs of other organisms is shown in Table I. Nucleotide homology comparison of these carp cDNAs among themselves in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions and the open reading frames is shown in TableII.Table ISequence homology among CK isoenzymes within the coding regionSpeciesIdentityCpM1CpM2CpM3DgMMsMRtMHuMChMTrMRtBRtMiuRtMis%CpM196.084.380.379.580.079.377.877.573.462.261.1CpM296.384.580.279.579.879.977.676.872.762.461.2CpM387.187.179.179.279.078.877.779.072.864.562.0DgM86.987.785.390.690.191.283.179.976.363.461.7MsM86.687.185.096.896.489.983.180.475.663.662.2RtM86.486.984.896.399.589.182.679.875.863.761.6HuM84.885.883.494.795.094.581.079.675.563.561.0ChM84.584.582.990.891.391.188.777.675.562.961.4TrM80.680.178.286.185.184.483.583.574.461.559.9RtB76.775.475.379.178.878.577.580.376.764.060.0RtMiu61.962.261.865.265.665.163.265.362.463.870.5RtMis61.361.861.765.264.764.261.866.062.664.377.8Sequence data were obtained from Refs. 24Mühlebach S.M.

The open reading frame sequences could be translated into proteins of 381 amino acids for both M1-CK and M2-CK and 380 amino acids for M3-CK (Fig. 2). Computer alignment and search were carried out using the programs Pileup and Pretty of the GCG software package and protein sequence data banks. The identity between M1-CK and M2-CK proteins is as high as 96% (Fig. 2, Table I). For the M3-CK protein, the identity with the homologous M1-CK and M2-CK subisoforms is somewhat lower, at approximately 87%, due to differences within sequences of different domains, especially at the N terminus (Fig. 2). Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of the three carp muscle subisoforms revealed 83–87% identity with human and other species' creatine kinase muscle isoenzyme (Table I). In mammals and birds, the amino acid identities within each isoenzyme class range from 88 to 99% (24Mühlebach S.M. Gross M. Wirz T. Wallimann T. Perriard J.C. Wyss M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 133: 245-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Evidently, a higher degree of homology can be observed between the B- and the M-CKs (77–82%), while the homology between the cytosolic and the mitochondrial CK isoforms is lower (60–65%) (Table I) (24Mühlebach S.M. Gross M. Wirz T. Wallimann T. Perriard J.C. Wyss M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 133: 245-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A previously defined “CK framework,” consisting of the six most conserved sequence blocks and “diagnostic boxes,” which are characteristic for any creatine kinase isoenzyme and which may serve to distinguish this isoenzyme from all others, could be observed in the protein sequences of the three carp M-CKs (24Mühlebach S.M. Gross M. Wirz T. Wallimann T. Perriard J.C. Wyss M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 133: 245-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The six highly conserved blocks are boxed in the carp M-CK consensus sequences in Fig. 2. These conserved sequences are flanked by regions that are less conserved, among them the N and C termini (Fig. 2). The absolutely conserved Cys-283, alkylation of which is always paralleled by a very pronounced or even complete loss of enzymatic activity, is also present (41Fueter R. Fueter-Graves E.M. Wallimann T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7022-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A putative adenine nucleotide binding motif (glycine-rich loop) LGXGXXGXV and the absolutely conserved seven-amino acid sequence Cys-Pro-Ser-Asn-Leu-Gly-Thr, referred to as the active site, are also observed (Fig. 2) (42Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 43Fritz-Wolf K. Schnyder T. Wallimann T. Kabsch W. Nature. 1996; 381: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Detection of the carp M-CK genes was by Southern hybridization. The results of the hybridization of the three restricted M-CK genes are shown in Fig.3. The oligonucleotide probes specific for each of the three genes hybridized strongly to their respective target DNAs. The respective gene-specific probes hybridized to a 6.5-kbHindIII fragment, a 3.8-kb PstI fragment, and a 4.7-kb PvuII fragmen"
https://openalex.org/W2065046455,"By complementation of a salt-sensitive mutant ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae, we cloned theSOP1 gene, encoding a 114.5-kDa protein of 1033 amino acids. Cells deleted for SOP1 exhibited sensitivity to sodium stress, but showed no sensitivity to general osmotic stress. Following exposure of sop1Δ cells to NaCl stress, the intracellular Na+ level and the Na+/K+ ratio rose to values significantly higher than in wild type cells. Deletion of SOP2, encoding a protein sharing 54% amino acid identity with Sop1p, produced only slight Na+ sensitivity. Cells carrying asop1Δsop2Δ double deletion became, however, hypersensitive to Na+ and exhibited increased sensitivity also to Li+ and K+, suggesting involvement of both SOP1 and SOP2 in cation homeostasis. The predicted amino acid sequences of Sop1p and Sop2p show significant homologies with the cytoskeletal-associated protein encoded by theDrosophila lethal(2)giant larvae tumor suppressor gene. Immunolocalization of Sop1p revealed a cytoplasmic distribution and cell fractionation studies showed that a significant fraction of Sop1p was recovered in a sedimentable fraction of the cytosolic material. Expression of a Drosophila l(2)gl cDNA in thesop1Δsop2Δ strain partially restored the Na+ tolerance of the cells, indicating a functional relationship between the Sop proteins and the tumor suppressor protein, and a novel function in cell homeostasis for this family of proteins extending from yeast to human.

Ions are continuously transported across the cell membrane, the net flux being adjusted to satisfy the requirement for a cytosol rich in potassium and scarce in sodium. Control of the intracellular concentration of these major monovalent cations is crucial to generate a biochemically-functional intracellular milieu. Since in natural environments Na+ is generally abundant and K+scarce, transport must occur against concentration gradients. Genetic analysis of salt tolerance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has identified a number of cation transporters which interact with multiple regulatory components in a largely unidentified fashion (1Serrano R. Marquez J.A. Rios G. Hohmann S. Mager W.H. Yeast Stress Responses. Landes Co., Heidelberg, Germany1997: 147-169Google Scholar). In particular, a major system involved in K+ uptake is constituted by the TRK1- and TRK2-encoded membrane proteins (2Gaber R.F. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2848-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 3Ko C.H. Buckley A.M. Gaber R.F. Genetics. 1990; 125: 305-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ramos J. Alijo R. Haro R. Rodriguez-Navarro A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 249-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which appear to contribute to the uptake of K+ in symport with protons (1Serrano R. Marquez J.A. Rios G. Hohmann S. Mager W.H. Yeast Stress Responses. Landes Co., Heidelberg, Germany1997: 147-169Google Scholar). The proton gradient providing the driving force for secondary transport is generated by thePMA1-encoded plasma membrane ATPase, a major membrane protein whose activity shows little sensitivity to high extracellular NaCl concentration (5Serrano R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Genome Dynamics, Protein Synthesis, and Energetics. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 523-585Google Scholar). The TRK1/TRK2-dependent transport system also permits influx of Na+, while under NaCl stress, the uptake system has the capacity of increasing its selectivity for K+ over Na+ (6Haro R. Banuelos M.A. Quintero F.J. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Physiol. Plant. 1993; 89: 868-874Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). In yeast cells, influx of Na+ is counteracted by Na+ efflux, the primary pathway being mediated by the P-type ATPase encoded by the PMR2A gene (also known asENA1) (6Haro R. Banuelos M.A. Quintero F.J. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Physiol. Plant. 1993; 89: 868-874Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 7Garciadeblas B. Rubio F. Quintero F.J. Banuelos M.A. Haro R. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The PMR2A gene is part of a gene cluster, containing tandem repeats of 2–5 nearly identical genes (8Wieland J. Nietsche A.M. Strayle J. Steiner H. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3870-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, only PMR2A appears to be significantly expressed (7Garciadeblas B. Rubio F. Quintero F.J. Banuelos M.A. Haro R. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 8Wieland J. Nietsche A.M. Strayle J. Steiner H. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3870-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and transcription of this gene is induced in cells subjected to Na+ or Li+ stress or cells exposed to alkaline pH (7Garciadeblas B. Rubio F. Quintero F.J. Banuelos M.A. Haro R. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). An additional sodium transporter encoded by the NHA1gene and acting as a putative Na+/H+ antiporter was recently identified in S. cerevisiae (9Prior C. Potier S. Souciet J.-L. Sychrova H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Disruption of the NHA1 gene displays only minor effects in wild type cells but elicits increased Na+ sensitivity in S. cerevisiae cells lacking the PMR2 genes. To identify components that are crucial for salt tolerance, the isolation of recessive, salt-sensitive mutations is an obvious approach. However, the only S. cerevisiae mutant characterized so far by this procedure is the calcineurin-defective strain isolated by Mendoza et al. (10Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These authors demonstrated that the protein phosphatase calcineurin, is involved in Na+ tolerance and is required for (i) induced expression of the PMR2A gene and (ii) modulating the K+ uptake system to display increased K+ versusNa+ discrimination. Further evidence that protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation regulate Na+tolerance in S. cerevisiae is provided by the increased cellular tolerance to sodium ions following inactivation of thePPZ1 and PPZ2 encoded serine-threonine phosphatases (11Posas F. Camps M. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13036-13041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, increased dosage of the YCK1or YCK2 gene, encoding yeast homologues of casein kinase I, enhances sodium tolerance (12Robinson L. Hubbard E. Graves P. DePaoli-Roach A. Roach P. Kung C.

By isolation and functional complementation a NaCl-sensitive mutant, we cloned the SOP1 gene. Here we report the initial characterization of the gene product and show that the predicted sequence of Sop1p lacks apparent membrane spanning regions or other characteristics of previously isolated determinants for Na+tolerance, and displays significant homology with theDrosophila p127 protein encoded by the lethal(2)giant larvae (l(2)gl) tumor suppressor gene and its homologues in mouse and man. Our results demonstrate thatSOP1 and a second related gene, designated asSOP2, are involved in regulating cation homeostasis inS. cerevisiae. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the expression of a Drosophila l(2)gl cDNA sequence in theS. cerevisiae sop1Δsop2Δ double mutant can partially restore Na+ tolerance. Our data provide evidence for functional conservation between the Drosophila p127 protein and its yeast homologues, and reveal involvement ofl(2)gl proteins in a new aspect of cell homeostasis. S. cerevisiae strains and genotypes are listed in TableI. Cells were routinely grown at 30 °C in either YEPD medium supplemented with 120 μg/ml adenine or in a synthetic yeast nitrogen base (YNB) medium (Difco) supplemented with 2% glucose and necessary amino acids and nucleotides, to a final concentration of 120 μg/ml for each. The procedure used to isolate the osg4 mutant has been described previously (14Larsson K. Eriksson P. Ansell R. Adler L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Cell density was estimated by measuring optical density at 610 nm in 1-cm cuvettes (OD610).

Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1973Google Scholar). The YCp50-based yeast genomic library (19Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) was used for complementation of the osg4 mutant. Transformants were screened on YNB agar plates containing 1.4 m NaCl, and plasmids from complemented cells were amplified in E. coli. Restriction fragments of a 7.5-kb 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); ORF, open reading frame; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. insert of a YCp50 plasmid complementing the osg4 salt sensitivity were subcloned in the 2μ-based shuttle vector pRS326 (20Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 4.7-kbHindIII/BamHI fragment retaining the complementing capacity was subcloned into pRS316 to generate the pH/B316 plasmid. Overexpression of the SOP1 gene was achieved by subcloning the 4.7-kb HindIII/BamHI fragment into the YEplac195 multicopy vector (21Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar), yielding the YEpH/B vector. To construct a plasmid that expresses a c-Myc-tagged SOP1, an XmaI-SalI fragment containing three copies of the 11-amino acid human c-Myc epitope was removed from the pBsMYC plasmid. This product was subcloned into pBSH/B (pBluescript KS+ containing the HindIII/BamHI fragment) at the Bst11071 site, 190 bp upstream the stop codon of the SOP1 ORF, generating an in-frame fusion. The final construct was verified by sequencing. A 2.0-kbHindIII/SphI fragment containing the c-Myc-tagged carboxyl-terminal half of the SOP1 gene was then excised and subcloned into the multicopy plasmid YEpH/B, or the single-copy plasmid pH/B316, generating the YEpH/Bmyc and pH/B316myc plasmids, respectively. To express the Drosophila l(2)gl gene in S. cerevisiae, a construct for the constitutive expression of thel(2)gl gene was generated as follows. A 5269-bpEcoRI fragment of the cDNA Ec173 inserted in pGEM4 (22Jacob L. Opper M. Metzroth B. Phannavong B. Mechler B.M. Cell. 1987; 50: 215-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the polylinker of the pYX212 and pYX112 plasmids (R&D Systems Inc.), and constructs were controlled by restriction analysis and sequencing. The 4.7-kbHindIII/BamHI fragment harboring theSOP1 gene subcloned into pBluescriptKS+ was cut with BglII and NheI, and the resulting 2.3-kb internal fragment of SOP1 was replaced with theURA3 or LEU2 selectable marker. The resulting constructs were amplified, and the HindIII/BamHI fragment was used to transform S. cerevisiae W303–1A and W303–1B by the LiAc method (23Ito H. Funkuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generatesop1::URA3 and sop1::LEU2null mutants. Deletion of the SOP2 gene was accomplished by the long flanking homology PCR-targeting technique (24Amberg D.C. Botstein D. Beasley E.M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1275-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 15: 259-265Crossref Scopus (700) Google Scholar). In the first step, a set of primers (5′-TTCCGCTTCATAGGAGGAGA-3′ and 5′-GGGGATCCGTCGACCTGCAGCGTACCATTTATAAAATTTTTGTAT -3′) was used to amplify 300 bp of genomic DNA from S. cerevisiae W303, immediately upstream of the second codon of the SOP2 ORF. A second set (5′-AACGAGCTCGAATTCATCGATGATATAGTCCATAAATAGTTTTTA-3′ and 5′-ACGGTTCATCATTCGGAAAA-3′) was used to amplify a 377-bp fragment immediately downstream of the SOP2 ORF stop codon. The 5′ end of the primers adjacent to the insertion site carried 25 nucleotide extensions homologous to the 5′ and 3′ region of thehis5MX6 disruption cassette of plasmid pFA6a-his5MX6 (26Wach A. Brachat A. Alberti-Segui C. Rebischung C. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In the second PCR reaction, pFA6a-his5MX6 was used as template and the 5′- and 3′-homologous regions of the first PCR reaction were fused to the disruption cassette by serving as primers, together with the upstream forward and downstream reverse primers of the flanking regions, thus producing the ORF targeting cassette. This cassette was transformed into a diploid S. cerevisiae W303 strain, and independent transformants were selected for sporulation and verification ofSOP2 replacement. Diploid transformants able to grow on his− plates were sporulated, and the progeny from a complete tetrad was examined by PCR for correct integration of the disruption cassette into one of the SOP2 alleles. A set of primers (forward, 5′-GGGGTACCCTCTGCGCCACCCACAC TTA-3′; reverse, 5′-TTCTGCAGATTCCGTATTTGCCAGTT-3′) hybridizing upstream and downstream, respectively, of the disruption cassette was used to amplify chromosomal DNA. The length of the PCR products was verified by agarose-gel electrophoresis, as was the length of the SphI and XbaI restriction fragments of the PCR product. Tolerance to salt or osmotic stress was examined by spotting 10-fold dilutions (10 μl) of an overnight culture diluted to OD610 ∼1.0 onto YEPD plates (pH 6.9, unless otherwise stated) supplemented with NaCl, LiCl, KCl, sorbitol, or glycerol, as indicated in the text. Tolerance to heat stress and N-starvation was performed as described by Sass et al. (27Sass P. Field J. Nikawa J. Toda T. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9303-9307Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To monitor tolerance to oxidative stress, cells grown overnight in YEPD medium were diluted into fresh YEPD medium to yield an OD610 of approximately 0.2. The cells were left to adjust to the new environment for 2 h, whereupon H2O2 was added to a final concentration of 5 mm. Cultures were then incubated at 30 °C and growth monitored. To determine tolerance to acidic or alkaline conditions, 10-fold dilutions of exponentially growing cells were spotted onto YEPD agar plates buffered at pH 4.8 or 8.6, and growth was assessed after incubation at 30 °C for 24 h. Cells were grown overnight at 30 °C in 500 ml of YEPD medium to mid-exponential phase. The culture was divided into three portions that were diluted with fresh medium to a cell density of 5 × 107 cells. These cultures were centrifuged at 3500 × g for 5 min and then re-suspended in 40 ml of YEPD medium supplemented with 0, 0.7, or 1.0 m NaCl. After incubation for 6 h, triplicate samples of 5 ml of cell suspension were filtered through 0.22-μm filters and washed with three volumes of iso-osmotic CaCl2. The filters were transferred to 5 ml of 20 μm Ca(OH)2 and extracted by heating for 10 min at 95 °C. The cell suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant stored at −20 °C until analyzed. Na+ and K+ concentrations of the supernatants were measured with K+ or Na+ specific electrodes (F2312K potassium selectrode and G502Na sodium selectrode; Radiometer Denmark). Exponentially growing cells were transferred to fresh YEPD medium and the same medium supplemented with 1.0 m NaCl or 1.5 m sorbitol, and incubated for 4 h before isolation and blotting of RNA, as described previously (28Eriksson P. Andre L. Ansell R. Blomberg A. Adler L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The SOP1 probe used was the 1.1-kb NheI fragment labeled by random priming (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar), using hexanucleotides and Klenow fragment from Boehringer Mannheim and [32P]ATP from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. An actin probe was used for loading control (28Eriksson P. Andre L. Ansell R. Blomberg A. Adler L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Strains harboring plasmid YEpH/Bmyc or pH/B316myc and control plasmids without insert were grown to OD610 0.5–1.0 in YEPD medium. Cells were washed by centrifugation and resuspended in twice the pellet volume of resuspension buffer (R-buffer), containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim; 1 tablet/50 ml of cell extract), and either 0.1m or 1 m KCl. Four volumes of glass beads were added, and each suspension was vortexed four times consecutively for 30 s at 4 °C, with incubation on ice between each vortex. Unlyzed cells were removed by centrifugation at 500 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The lysate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. The pellets were resuspended in 100 mm KCl R-buffer and the lysate desalted by gel filtration (Microcolumns, Bio-Rad). Aliquots containing equal amounts of cell material were boiled for 1 min in Laemmli SDS buffer (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% acrylamide gels at 125 V for 1.5 h using a Mini-PROTEAN II electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad) and transferred overnight to Hybond membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturers' protocols. The membranes were first incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.9% NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (Buffer A), supplemented with 1% milk powder and then for 2 h with mouse anti-c-Myc antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) diluted 1:5000 in Buffer A with 1% milk powder. The anti-p127 C39 antibodies were as described by Strand et al. (30Strand D. Raska I. Mechler B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1345-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Membranes were washed once for 5 min in Buffer A, twice for 5 min in 0.2% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.9% NaCl (Buffer B), and twice for 5 min again in Buffer A. The membranes were probed for 1 h with 1:20,000 dilution of anti-mouse peroxidase-linked antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in Buffer A containing 5% milk powder. The blots were washed as before, and antibody detection was performed using ECL labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were fixed in growth media by the addition of formaldehyde to a final concentration of 3.7%, and cells were prepared for immunofluorescence according to Rose et al. (31Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Mouse anti-c-Myc antibodies and sheep anti-mouse Ig-fluorescein, F(ab′)2 fragment secondary antibodies were from Boehringer Mannheim. Glass slides were coated with poly-l-lysine, M r >300,000 (Sigma), to promote cell adhesion. Anti-c-Myc antibody concentration was 0.1 mg/ml, and the concentration of anti-mouse Ig-fluorescein was 0.02 mg/ml. Cells were stained with diamidinophenylindole (1 mg/ml) for 1 min and covered by mounting medium (50 mg ofp-phenylenediamine in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 9) and 45 ml of glycerol). Coverslips were then applied and sealed with nail polish. We previously reported the isolation of a set of osmosensitive (osg) mutants of S. cerevisiae(14Larsson K. Eriksson P. Ansell R. Adler L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Among these mutants we also identified a strain (osg4) that proved specifically sensitive to sodium chloride rather than being generally osmosensitive. Transformation of this mutant with a YCp50-based yeast genomic library (19Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) resulted in the isolation of clones that restored growth of the mutant at high salinity (Fig.1 A), and restriction endonuclease analysis identified a 4.7-kbHindIII/BamHI DNA fragment, which fully complemented the mutation. Subcloning, partial sequencing, and searching of DNA data bases tentatively identified a single large open reading frame, assigned YPR032W by the Yeast Genome Sequencing Project (EMBL accession no. Z49274). The 3102-bp open reading frame is localized to the left arm of chromosome XVI and encodes a putative protein of 1033 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 114.5 kDa. The codon bias (0.054) predicts a low expression of the gene, as indicated by the weak signal observed on a Northern blot (data not shown). Since this gene restored the salt sensitivity of the mutant, it was named SOP1 for sodiumprotection. Homology searches revealed that Sop1p possesses 54% amino acid identity with another S. cerevisiae protein, encoded by the open reading frame YBL106C (EMBL accession no. Z35867). We designated this gene SOP2, since it shows structural and functional (see below) similarities to SOP1. Significant similarity scores were also recovered (Fig.2) between the yeast proteins and the p127 protein encoded by the Drosophila l(2)gl tumor suppressor gene (22Jacob L. Opper M. Metzroth B. Phannavong B. Mechler B.M. Cell. 1987; 50: 215-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 32Mechler B.M. McGinnis W. Gehring W.J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and its homologues from mouse (MGL) (33Tomutsune D. Shoji H. Wakamutsu Y. Kondoh H. Takahashi N. Nature. 1993; 365: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and man (HUGL) (34Strand D. Unger S. Corvi R. Hartenstein K. Schenkel H. Kalmers A. Merdes G. Neumann B. Krieg-Schneider F. Coy J.F. Poutska A. Schwab M. Mechler B.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 291-301PubMed Google Scholar). A well conserved feature in this family of proteins is the presence of WD-40-like motifs in the NH2-terminal half of the proteins (Fig. 2). These motifs were first described for the β subunit of trimeric GTP-binding proteins (35van de Voorn L. Ploegh H.L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 36Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar), and might represent domains for protein-protein interactions. To determine the phenotype of a cell lacking the SOP1 gene, null alleles were constructed by one-step gene disruption (37Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar). ABglII/NheI fragment of the SOP1 open reading frame was replaced by the LEU2 (Fig. 1 B) or URA3 marker gene, and theHindIII/SpeI fragment of the resulting constructs was used to disrupt the SOP1 locus of the W303–1A and W303–1B strains. Southern blot analysis of the genomic DNA prepared from the putative disruptants confirmed the correct replacement of theSOP1 gene with the marker gene constructs (data not shown). The sop1Δ mutant was screened for osmotic sensitivity on agar plates supplemented with NaCl, KCl, LiCl, or sorbitol. Of these solutes, only NaCl strongly restricted the growth of the null mutant (Fig. 3), whereas KCl and the non-ionic agent sorbitol caused no significant decrease in the growth of the mutant compared with that of the wild type. Since Li+ and Na+ ions are relatively similar, it is generally believed that these ions share the same uptake and efflux systems in the cell (6Haro R. Banuelos M.A. Quintero F.J. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Physiol. Plant. 1993; 89: 868-874Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that SOP1 inactivation conferred only minor changes in Li+ tolerance (Fig. 3), suggesting that SOP1 is highly specific for Na+ion homeostasis of S. cerevisiae. To examine whether the sop1Δ strain was sensitive to other forms of stress, we compared the response of mutant and wild type cells to heat stress, nitrogen starvation, oxidative stress, and high and low pH. None of these conditions produced any growth difference between wild type and mutant cells, indicating that a loss of theSOP1 gene causes no general stress response defect (data not shown). However, the Na+ sensitivity of thesop1Δ mutant proved strongly pH-dependent, as indicated by a considerably stronger tolerance to Na+ at pH 4.5 than at 6.9 (Fig. 3 A). As SOP1 inactivation confers sensitivity to NaCl, it was of interest to examine whether the expression of the gene is controlled by environmental salinity. Northern blot analysis revealed a low abundance of SOP1 transcript in cells grown in basal medium and no increased amount of transcript under salt stress conditions (data not shown). We also observed that overexpression ofSOP1 gene from its own promoter on a YEplac195 multicopy vector caused no increase in Na+ tolerance by comparison to control cells, carrying a vector without insert (data not shown). Likewise, overexpression of SOP1 exerted no effect on the Na+ tolerance of a pmr2A null mutant lacking the Na+ extruding ATPase activity, or could not bypass the salt sensitivity of either cnb1 cells (10Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) lacking calcineurin orcmd1-5cells (38Davis T.N. Urdea M.S. Masiarz F.R. Thorner J. Cell. 1986; 47: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) carrying a mutant form of calmodulin unable to bind Ca2+. To examine the effect of SOP1inactivation on Na+ and K+ homeostasis, the intracellular levels of these ions were measured in mutant and wild type cells after conditioning the cells for 6 h in basal medium or in the same medium containing either 0.7 m or 1.0m NaCl. The intracellular Na+ concentration in the mutant cells increased strongly with salinity to become about 3 times higher (0.4 m) than in wild type cells ma"

We cloned the rat and human cDNAs encoding PAM COOH-terminalinteractor protein-1 (P-CIP1). Both cDNAs contain an open reading frame that encodes a novel protein of 435 amino acids. The P-CIP1 protein is highly conserved from rat to human (85% identity) but does not display significant homology to proteins in the GenBank data base. In vitro, P-CIP1 interacts with the cytosolic domain of wild type PAM-1, but does not interact with mutant PAM-1 proteins that fail to target correctly when expressed in endocrine cells. P-CIP1 contains multiple consensus serine/threonine phosphorylation sites and a region predicted to form a coiled-coil at the COOH terminus. When expressed in endocrine cells or fibroblasts, P-CIP1 is distributed in a punctate pattern in the perinuclear area but does not significantly overlap the distribution of transfected wild type PAM-1. The distribution of P-CIP1 displays significant overlap with the distribution of the secretory carriermembrane proteins, internalized Texas Red-conjugated transferrin, and Rab11.

Bioactive peptides act as signaling molecules to regulate a wide range of cellular activities and are the major cargo proteins carried by regulated secretory granules. The bioactive peptides are derived from inactive precursors through a series of post-translational modifications, including endoproteolysis, exoproteolysis, and for over half of all known peptides, COOH-terminal α-amidation (6Bradbury A.F.

Since most of these post-translational modifications occur in secretory granules, the enzymes involved must be targeted together with prohormone substrates to the regulated pathway. The mechanisms involved in this targeting are not understood. However, data from several laboratories studying the targeting of different integral membrane proteins suggests that sorting signals in the cytosolic domain of these proteins are involved (13Koedam J.A.

One integral membrane protein that functions in secretory granules is peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM). This bifunctional enzyme catalyzes the two sequential reactions involved in the α-amidation of bioactive peptides (10Eipper B.A. Stoffers D.A. Mains R.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 19Eipper B.A. Milgram S.L. Husten E.J. Yun H.-Y. Mains R.E. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Alternative mRNA splicing produces PAM proteins that contain or lack a single transmembrane domain, providing a means to directly compare the trafficking of soluble and integral membrane secretory granule-associated proteins (19Eipper B.A. Milgram S.L. Husten E.J. Yun H.-Y. Mains R.E. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). When expressed in the neuroendocrine AtT-20 cell line, soluble PAM proteins are efficiently targeted to secretory granules, where they are stored and eventually secreted in response to secretagogues (20Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 21Milgram S.L. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast, the majority of the integral membrane PAM (e.g. PAM-1) is accumulated in tubuloreticular structures in the perinuclear area, although some of the expressed protein does reside in secretory granules (20Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 21Milgram S.L. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J.

Integral membrane PAM is also internalized from the cell surface and transported to perinuclear vesicles; some of the internalized protein may be degraded in lysosomes or repackaged into newly forming granules (14Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To identify cytosolic sorting signals responsible for targeting integral membrane PAM, we generated a series of cDNAs encoding truncation, deletion, or point mutations within the PAM cytosolic domain. We found that PAM-1 proteins truncated at amino acid residue 936 or lacking residues 928–945 of the cytosolic domain accumulate on the cell surface and are not internalized (15Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17526-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that a tyrosine-based signal (Glu-Tyr936-Ser-Arg-Lys) mediates the efficient internalization of PAM from the cell surface (15Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17526-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and that the phosphorylation state of PAM on Ser937 is one factor that governs the fate of the internalized protein (23Yun H.-Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30075-30083Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Taken together our data indicate that several sorting signals are contained within the PAM cytosolic domain (15Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17526-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Since protein-protein interactions play a role in targeting proteins within the secretory pathway, Alam et al. (1Alam M.R. Caldwell B.D. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28636-28640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify three partial cDNAs encodingPAM cytosolic domain interactingproteins (P-CIPs). In two-hybrid assays, the protein encoded by each of the cDNAs interacts with the wild type PAM cytosolic domain but does not associate with mutant PAM proteins lacking the previously identified cytosolic targeting signals. P-CIP2 displays homology to known protein serine/threonine kinases (1Alam M.R. Caldwell B.D. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28636-28640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and may be involved in phosphorylating PAM, while P-CIP10 (Kalirin) is a member of the Db1 family of proteins (1Alam M.R.

P-CIP10 has nine spectrin-like repeats, a Db1-homology, and a pleckstrin homology domain. Expression of P-CIP10 in AtT-20 cell lines expressing integral membrane PAM accelerates the turnover of PAM. In the present study, we report the cloning and initial characterization of P-CIP1. The P-CIP1 protein is well conserved from rat to human and does not display significant homology to proteins in the GenBank data base. When expressed in endocrine and nonendocrine cells, P-CIP1 accumulates on perinuclear endosomes. Our data suggest that P-CIP1 may play a role in regulating vesicular trafficking in cells. AtT-20 cell lines stably expressing PAM-1, PAM-1/936, or PAM-1/Δ928–945 were described previously (15Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17526-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,20Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Wild type AtT-20 cells and the stable cell lines expressing PAM proteins were extracted in 20 mm sodium TES, pH 7.5, 10 mm mannitol, 1% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors (20Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Fifty micrograms of each cell extract was immunoprecipitated with antisera directed against exon A (Fig.1 A, JH 629) (23Yun H.-Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30075-30083Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads (Sigma) as described previously (14Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated PAM proteins were incubated with 50 nm P-CIP1 in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmCaCl2) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in 1 ml of binding buffer and the bound fractions were eluted from the beads by boiling in Lamelli sample buffer. Proteins which did not bind PAM-1 were concentrated by acetone precipitation and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Bound and unbound fractions were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore Inc., Bedford, MA). P-CIP1 in bound and unbound fractions was compared by immunoblotting using chicken anti-rat P-CIP1a IgY (Antibody 1088) diluted 1:2000. Western blots were performed using enhanced chemiluminescent detection (NEN Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA). Plasmids for yeast two-hybrid assays were described previously (1Alam M.R. Caldwell B.D. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28636-28640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Plasmid pPC86.P-CIP1a (originally called pPC86.I1), which was isolated in the library screen, consists of nucleotides 309–1308 of the final P-CIP1 cDNA (all the P-CIP1 plasmids contain rat P-CIP1 cDNA sequence unless specified). pBS.P-CIP1a was generated by digesting pPC86.P-CIP1a withSalI and NotI and ligating the purified fragment into pBS.SK digested with the same enzymes. To generate pBS.P-CIP1, containing nucleotides 309–1657 of the final P-CIP1 cDNA, we amplified rat adrenal cDNA using sense primer LC3 (5′-AGCGATTTCTGTTGGGTAAGGCC-3′, nts 549–571) and antisense primer LC21 (5′-AAAAGGAAAAGCGGCCGCTTAAGTTGCCAGCAG-3′, nts 1657–1643) which included a NotI enzyme site (underlined). The PCR product was purified, digested with SpeI andNotI, and ligated into pBS.P-CIP1a digested with the same enzymes. The sequence of the region generated by PCR was found to be free of mutations by DNA sequencing. We constructed bacterial expression plasmids pET28.P-CIP1a (nts 309–1308) and pET28.P-CIP1 (nts 309–1657) by digesting pBS.P-CIP1a and pBS.P-CIP1 plasmids withSalI and NotI. The resultant DNA fragments were gel purified and ligated into pET28(c) (Novagen, Madison, WI) digested with the same enzymes. We obtained two pBS plasmids containing human ESTs (ATCC, clones 108497 and 190698) that were homologous to the rat P-CIP1 cDNA. pBS.hP-CIP1 (clone 108497, containing the entire human P-CIP1 cDNA sequence) was used to construct mammalian expression vector pEGFP.hP-CIP1. PCR was used to eliminate the stop codon and add aKpnI site to allow fusion of the human P-CIP1 coding sequence in-frame with the cDNA encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). The P-CIP1 cDNA fragments were digested with PstI and KpnI and ligated into pEGFP-N2 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) digested with the same enzymes. pET28.P-CIP1 or pET28.P-CIP1a plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3, pLysS) Escherichia coli and grown to the appropriate cell density at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C or overnight at 28 °C. The expressed P-CIP1 proteins contained 6 consecutive histidine residues and the T7 epitope tag at the amino terminus. Since both of the P-CIP1 proteins were insoluble in 1% Triton X-100, bacterial lysates were prepared by sonication in ice-cold binding buffer containing 6 m urea and purified on Ni columns according to the manufacturer's instructions. After elution from the Ni columns, the proteins were concentrated and the urea was removed using an UltraFree Centrifugal Filter Unit with a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off (Millipore Inc., Bedford, MA). Full-length P-CIP1 was used for in vitro binding assays, while the P-CIP1a (amino acid residues 1–320) protein was used as immunogen. Chicken anti-P-CIP1a (antibody 1088) was generated at Aves Labs (Portland, OR) using bacterially expressed rat P-CIP1a as immunogen. After collecting 3 eggs prior to immunization, two chickens were immunized by intramuscular injection of polyhistidine-tagged P-CIP1a. Four immunizations were performed, and 1 week following the final immunization, the IgY fraction was purified from 6 eggs collected from each chicken. A rat multiple tissue Northern (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was hybridized with 32P-labeled rat P-CIP1 cDNA probe (nts 350–1657; 1 × 106 cpm/ml). The blot was prehybridized at 68 °C for 30 min and incubated with the probe at 68 °C for 1 h in ExpressHyb (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). After incubation, the blot was washed at room temperature for 30 min in 2 × SSC + 0.05% SDS, followed by 0.1 × SSC + 0.1% SDS for 40 min at 50 °C. Blots were stripped and reprobed with32P-labeled β-actin probe for normalization (CLONTECH). For RT-PRC analyses, total RNA from rat lung, kidney, adrenal, pituitary, ovary, and spleen was purified using RNA-STAT60 (TEL-TEST“B”, Inc.) and treated with DNase (Life Technologies, Inc.). cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and oligo(dT) priming. PCR was performed using Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and rat P-CIP1 gene-specific primers LC-3 (sense, 5′-AGCGATTTCTGTTGGGTAAGGCC-3′, nts 549–571) and LC-19 (antisense, 5′-TCTCTCTGGATGCCACTCAAGTGAG-3′, nts 1374–1350). The quality of each cDNA was verified using cyclophillin specific primers as described (25Sheng M. Cummings J. Rolden L.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 368: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). cDNA libraries were synthesized from 1 μg of rat adrenal gland, whole brain, testis, and kidney poly(A) mRNA using the Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH). Briefly, first and second strand cDNA syntheses were performed as recommended, cDNAs were blunted by incubation with T4 DNA polymerase, and adaptors (CLONTECH) were ligated to each end of the cDNA. Several gene-specific oligonucleotides were designed based on the 1.0-kb P-CIP1 cDNA fragment identified in the yeast two-hybrid screen. PCR reactions were performed using adapter-specific (AP1 or AP2) and P-CIP1 specific primers, KlenTaq DNA polymerase (CLONTECH), and the following PCR conditions: 94 °C × 30 s, 72 °C × 4 min for five cycles; 94 °C × 30 s, 70 °C × 4 min for five cycles; and 94 °C × 20 s, 68 °C × 4 min for 25 cycles. For 3′ RACE we paired sense primer LC3 and adaptor primer AP1 and amplified a distinct 1.3-kb fragment from all tissues examined. For 5′ RACE, initial PCR reactions were performed using adaptor primer AP1 and LC6 (nts 974–924; 5′-GCTGGTGGATCGTGTGGTCCTGAG-3′). Then, 5 μl of the first PCR product was diluted 1:50 in Tricine-EDTA buffer and 5 μl was used as template for a nested PCR using adaptor primer AP2 and P-CIP1 specific primer LC4 (nts 793–768; 5′-GTAATTCGCCGGGCTGAGCTCCCAAG-3′). The resultant PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T easy cloning vector (Promega, Madson, WI) and both DNA strands were sequenced by the University of North Carolina sequencing facility. AtT-20 and CHO cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's and F-12 media containing 10% fetal clone serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). CHO cells were transiently transfected with pEGFP and pEGFP.hP-CIP1 using calcium phosphate or Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA); AtT-20 cells were transfected with the same plasmids using Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For CHO cells, the transfection efficiency was ∼50% for GFP and 10% for P-CIP1 constructs while ∼5% of the AtT-20 cells were transfected. In some experiments, CHO cells were co-transfected with pEGFP.hP-CIP1 and pCIS.PAM-1 (encodes full-length rat PAM-1) (20Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours (calcium phosphate) or 8 h (Superfect) after removing the transfection media, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 50 mmNaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described using the following antisera: JH1479 (rabbit anti-TGN38, 1:1000; Ref. 22Milgram S.L. Kho S.T. Martin G.V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 7C12 (mouse anti-SCAMP, 40 μg/ml; Ref. 26Brand S.H. Laurie S.M. Mixon M.B. Castle J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18949-18957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), JH 629 (rabbit anti-exon A of PAM, 1:1000) (23Yun H.-Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30075-30083Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and rabbit anti-Rab11 antisera (Zymed Laboratories Inc., 1:200). Texas red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or rabbit anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:1000 in PBS containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 were used to visualize immune complexes. The distribution of P-CIP1-GFP chimeras was compared with the distribution of the marker proteins using a Leica TCS-NT Confocal Microscope with FITC (ex = 488 nm, em = 530/30BP) and Texas Red (ex = 568 nm, em = 590LP) filters, a 100 × NA1.3 oil immersion objective, and a pinhole size of 0.8 Airy disc unit. We performed simultaneous scanning for FITC and Texas Red. We also routinely performed sequential scanning for FITC or Texas Red while turning off one laser to confirm that there was no bleed-through. Images were imported into Adobe Photoshop to adjust the brightness and contrast. In all confocal images the figure shown is representative of the majority of cells analyzed (∼40–50 cells for each comparison). In some experiments, transiently transfected cells were treated with 5 μg/ml brefeldin A (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) for 1 h prior to fixation. To determine whether P-CIP1 associated with endosomes, we compared the distributions of P-CIP1-GFP chimeras and internalized Texas Red-conjugated transferrin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were first incubated for 30 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 + 0.2% bovine serum albumin lacking transferrin and then incubated in 40 μg/ml Texas Red-conjugated transferrin at 37 °C for 60 min. The cells were rinsed in PBS, fixed as described above, and the distributions of P-CIP1-GFP and Texas Red-conjugated transferrin were compared by laser scanning confocal microscopy. To analyze the subcellular distribution of GFP and P-CIP1-GFP, transiently transfected CHO cells were rinsed once with PBS, resuspended in 20 mm sodium TES, pH 7.5, 10 mmmannitol containing protease inhibitors (20Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing. Total cell lysates were separated into soluble and particulate fractions by centrifugation at 413,000 ×g for 15 min in a TL-100 tabletop ultracentrifuge. Proteins in soluble and particulate fractions were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to Immobilion-P (Millipore Inc., Bedford, MA), and analyzed by using rabbit polyclonal GFP antisera (CLONTECH) as described above. P-CIP1 was identified by screening yeast two-hybrid library using residues 899–961 of the PAM cytosolic domain as bait (1Alam M.R. Caldwell B.D. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28636-28640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To confirm the yeast two-hybrid results in biochemical assays, and to test whether P-CIP1 interacted with the full-length PAM cytosolic domain (residues 899–976), we immunoprecipitated wild type full-length PAM-1 protein from transfected AtT-20 cell lysates. The immunoprecipitated PAM protein was incubated with 50 nm recombinant P-CIP1 and interactions between PAM and P-CIP1 were detected by Western blotting using P-CIP1 antisera. P-CIP1 interacted with full-length wild type PAM but did not bind to control beads lacking PAM-1 protein (wild type AtT-20 cells; Fig. 1 B). Thus we conclude that P-CIP1 can interact with full-length PAM-1 in biochemical assays. We previously used site-directed mutagenesis and expression in the neuroendocrine AtT-20 cell line to identify amino acid residues critical for the trafficking of PAM. We found that PAM proteins terminating at residue 936 of the cytosolic domain accumulated on the cell surface and were not internalized (15Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17526-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that residues 928–945, including the internalization signal Gly-Tyr936-Ser-Arg-Lys, were essential for targeting integral membrane PAM. To determine whether P-CIP1 interacted with PAM through residues known to be important for PAM trafficking, we performed in vitro binding assays using PAM-1/936 and PAM-1/Δ928–945 proteins. Immunoprecipitated PAM-1/936 or PAM-1/Δ928–945 was incubated with recombinant P-CIP1 and the interaction between P-CIP1 and these mutant PAM proteins was measured. We found that in contrast to full-length PAM-1, P-CIP1 did not specifically interact with PAM-1/936 or PAM-1/Δ928–945 (Fig.1 B). These results were not due to differences in the amount of PAM proteins in the immunoprecipitates, since immunoblots with PAM antisera revealed approximately equal amounts of each PAM protein in the assays (not shown). Thus we conclude that P-CIP1 may interact with PAM via residues within the PAM cytosolic domain that are known to be involved in targeting the protein within the secretory and endosomal systems. To begin our characterization of P-CIP1, we used Northern blot hybridization analysis and RT-PCR to examine the distribution of P-CIP1 mRNA. We found that the expression of P-CIP1 mRNA was not limited to neuroendocrine tissues. Northern blots indicated that P-CIP1 mRNA was expressed in testis, kidney, skeletal muscle, liver, lung, brain, and heart (Fig.2 A). In addition, RT-PCR indicated that P-CIP1 was expressed in pituitary gland, adrenal gland, and ovary (Fig. 2 B). On Northern blots, there were two distinct P-CIP1 mRNAs, ∼1.8 and 5 kb in length (Fig.2 A). These two transcripts varied in expression pattern from tissue to tissue and both were larger than the 1-kb cDNA isolated in the yeast two-hybrid library screen. Therefore we proceeded to clone the entire P-CIP1 cDNA. To clone the 5′ and 3′ ends of the P-CIP1 cDNA, we designed primers for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE; Fig. 3 A) and performed RACE using RNA isolated from several rat tissues including adrenal gland, brain, testis, and kidney. The resulting RACE products were subcloned and sequenced and found to contain sequences overlapping the P-CIP1 cDNA isolated in the yeast two-hybrid library screen.Figure 3Rat P-CIP1 cDNA sequence, structural predictions. A, the coding region is presented as abox, while the untranslated regions are indicated aslines at both ends. The partial P-CIP1 cDNA cloned from yeast two-hybrid library screen is shown below the full-length cDNA and the location of primers used in 3′ or 5′ RACE reactions (LC-3, LC-4, and LC-6) are indicated.

MacMARCKS contains within it a basic effector domain that contains the serine residues that are phosphorylated by protein kinase C, as well as a calcium/calmodulin and actin-binding site. Two previous reports demonstrated that a macrophage cell line expressing a mutant form of MacMARCKS that lacks the effector domain is defective in phagocytosis and cell adhesion (Zhu, Z., Bao, Z., and Li, J. (1995) J. Biol. Chem.270, 17652–17655; Li, J., Zhu, Z., and Bao, Z. (1996) J. Biol. Chem.271, 12985–12990). We report here that macrophages from MacMARCKS null mice phagocytose and spread normally. Thus, although MacMARCKS is recruited to phagosomes, it is not absolutely required for phagocytosis.

MacMARCKS plays a role in coordinating the actin cytoskeleton during such diverse processes as neural tube closure and synaptic transmission and has been proposed to play an important role in phagocytosis by macrophages (4Li J.

MacMARCKS and the closely related family member, MARCKS, are rod shaped proteins that can be divided into three domains based on sequence homology and function (4Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The amino terminus consists of an amino-terminal glycine that is myristoylated followed by a short stretch of highly conserved amino acids with unknown function called the MH2 (MARCKS homology 2) domain (4Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The MH2 domain is followed by a short stretch of basic amino acids, known as the effector domain, which binds calcium/calmodulin, actin, and acidic lipids and which contains the serines that are phosphorylated by PKC (4Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Blackshear P.J. Verghese G.M. Johnson J.D. Haupt D.M. Stumpo D.J. J. Biol.

PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the effector domain of MARCKS regulates the binding of calcium/calmodulin and F-actin to it and also regulates the association of MARCKS with membranes (13Graff J.M.

Much less is known about the effector domain of MacMARCKS; however, the domains are structurally very similar, and PKC also regulates the binding of calcium/calmodulin to the MacMARCKS effector domain (4Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Blackshear P.J. Verghese G.M. Johnson J.D. Haupt D.M. Stumpo D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13540-13546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biochemical data suggest that MacMARCKS, like MARCKS, plays a role in integrating the effects of PKC and calcium on actin dynamics. MacMARCKS has recently been suggested to play a crucial role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton during phagocytosis in macrophages; it is rapidly recruited to the forming phagosome, and expression of a mutant form of the protein lacking an effector domain was reported to completely inhibit phagocytosis in a macrophage cell line (9Zhu Z. Bao Z. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17652-17655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A subsequent report from the same group demonstrated that macrophages expressing this mutant protein were also incapable of spreading (10Li J. Zhu Z. Bao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12985-12990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that although MacMARCKS associates with phagosomes, its presence is not required for phagocytosis; macrophages derived from MacMARCKS null mice phagocytose zymosan normally. Macrophages from MacMARCKS null mice also spread normally. In addition, we show that in our hands, the mutant form of MacMARCKS that lacks the effector domain does not associate with phagosomes, does not displace WT MacMARCKS from phagosomes, and does not inhibit phagocytosis when transfected into a macrophage cell line. Unless indicated otherwise, all reagents were obtained from Sigma. Heterozygous MacMARCKS ± mice (7Chen J. Chang S. Duncan S.A. Okano H.J. Fishell G. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6275-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) were mated, and macrophages were prepared from fetal liver using a variation of a protocol developed by Moore and Williams (17Moore M.A.S. Williams N. Cell Tissue Kinet. 1973; 6: 461-476PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, fetuses were sacrificed at day 14.5 of gestation, and livers were harvested. Limbs and tails were collected at the same time for genotyping as described previously (7Chen J. Chang S. Duncan S.A. Okano H.J. Fishell G. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6275-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The livers were dispersed by passage two times through a 26G needle, red blood cells were lysed, and the remaining cells were plated in 10-cm tissue culture dishes in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) with 20% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 15% L cell conditioned medium, and supplemented with 1%l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2atmosphere, and half of the medium was changed every 3 days. After 7–10 days nonadherent cells were washed away, and the remaining cells (macrophages) were scraped off the plate in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and plated for subsequent experiments. RAW 264.7 (ATCC TIB- 71) were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in Hepes-buffered RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone) supplemented with 1%l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were passaged by resuspension in PBS containing 1 mm EDTA. Macrophages were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously (18Allen L.H. Aderem A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on glass coverslips, stimulated with 50 ng/ml lipopolysacharide for 3 h, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma), and permeabilized in acetone at −20 °C. Nonspecific sites were blocked by incubation in PAB (PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% sodium azide) containing 10% horse serum, and primary antibodies diluted in PAB with horse serum were applied to the cells for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed in PAB, and the appropriate secondary antibodies diluted in PAB with horse serum were incubated with the cells for 1 h. After further washing in PAB, cells were mounted and observed by confocal microscopy using a MRC-1024 system (Bio-Rad) equipped with LaserSharp software and mounted on an Axiovert TV microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) as described previously (18Allen L.H. Aderem A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). MARCKS and MacMARCKS were visualized using affinity purified rabbit antibodies as described previously (6Chang S. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Aderem A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1174-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19Allen L.H. Aderem A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1109-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). F-actin was detected using FITC-phalloidin or tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Talin was detected using monoclonal antibody 8d4 (Sigma). The HA-tagged proteins were detected using a polyclonal rabbit anti-HA antibody (Babco, Berkeley, CA). Phagocytosis of zymosan by primary macrophages was measured as described previously (18Allen L.H. Aderem A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Zymosan particles (Sigma) in Hepes-buffered RPMI were centrifuged onto macrophage monolayers at 4 °C, the cells were warmed by addition of RPMI at 37 °C, and internalization was allowed to proceed. The cells were either fixed and processed for microscopy after 3 min of internalization as described above, or live cells were stained with 0.4% trypan blue in PBS after 90 min of internalization to facilitate counting of phagocytosed particles. Phagocytosis of zymosan by RAW cells was measured by centrifuging FITC-zymosan (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) onto macrophage monolayers as described above. After 1 h of internalization, the cells were washed, extracellular zymosan was dissolved by addition of 100 units/ml lyticase in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and cells were resuspended in PBS + 1 mmEDTA and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan and CELLQuest software (Beckton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Phagocytic indexes (number of particles/100 cells) were calculated by comparison of cellular fluorescence to fluorescence of single zymosan particles and expressed as phagocytic index ± S.E. The pcDNA 3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) expression vectors encoding MacMARCKS and MacMARCKS Δ-effector domain fused to HA at their carboxyl termini have been described before (20Myat M.M. Chang S. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Aderem A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 677-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The wild type construct encodes all 200 amino acids of MacMARCKS, whereas the effector domain deletion mutant excludes amino acids 86–108. DNA for transfections was prepared using Qiagen Tip-500s according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). RAW 264 cells were transfected using a variation on the method described by Stacey et al.(21Stacey K.J. Ross I.L. Hume D.A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 75-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Five million cells in 210 μl of culture medium were placed in a 0.4-cm gap cuvette along with 5 μg of plasmid DNA in 40 μl of PBS. After 10 min at room temperature, the cells were electroporated using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) set at 960 microfarad and 300 V. The cells were immediately transferred to 5 ml of medium, pelleted by centrifugation at 600 × g, resuspended in fresh medium, and cultured for 24 h before addition of 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 10 days of selection, cells were cloned twice by limiting dilution, and cells expressing the desired proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. Whole cell extracts of RAW cells were prepared by resuspending cells in solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, plus 0.5 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.09 trypsin inhibitory units aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubating the mixture on ice for 20 min. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 10 min in a microfuge, and the protein content of the supernatant was analyzed by the BCA method (Pierce). 20 μg of protein from each sample were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in blotto (PBS with 5% milk, 0.01% Tween 20, and 5 mm azide). Primary antibodies were diluted in blotto and applied to the membrane for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed thoroughly with PBS + 0.01% Tween 20 and incubated for 30 min with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted in blotto without azide. After further washing, specific antibody binding was detected by chemiluminescence using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The hemagglutinin tag was detected using a polyclonal rabbit anti-HA antibody (Babco, Berkeley, CA), and MacMARCKS was detected using a MacMARCKS-specific polyclonal antiserum (6Chang S. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Aderem A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1174-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). MacMARCKS null mice die at birth due to neural tube closure defects, so macrophages from adult MacMARCKS knockout mice could not be assessed for phagocytic competence (7Chen J. Chang S. Duncan S.A. Okano H.J. Fishell G. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6275-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To study MacMARCKS null macrophages, we cultured fetal liver-derived macrophages from 14½ day MacMARCKS null embryos. Macrophages were recovered identically from wild type and null (MMKO) fetuses; cells were recovered in similar numbers and had similar morphologies (Fig.1). Immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting studies with antibodies to MARCKS and MacMARCKS confirmed that the MacMARCKS −/− macrophages had no detectable MacMARCKS, whereas the protein was easily detected in macrophages from wild type litter mates (7Chen J. Chang S. Duncan S.A. Okano H.J. Fishell G. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6275-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 and data not shown). The distribution and expression of MARCKS in the MacMARCKS null macrophages was unchanged; MARCKS was found diffusely distributed throughout the cells and on plasma membranes with occasional accumulation on plasma membrane ruffles (Fig. 1 and data not shown). MacMARCKS null macrophages spread normally in response to bacterial lipopolysacharide and in response to phorbol esters (Fig. 1 and data not shown). When wild type and MacMARCKS null macrophages were incubated with zymosan particles, no differences in phagocytic ability were observed. Wild type cells had a phagocytic index (particles/100 cells) of 444 ± 35, whereas MacMARCKS null macrophages had a phagocytic index of 397 ± 45. Because MacMARCKS was not required for internalization of zymosan, we examined more carefully the formation and maturation of the nascent phagosome. One of the earliest steps in phagocytosis is the polymerization of actin beneath a surface-bound particle. Localization of F-actin with FITC-phalloidin revealed that actin polymerized identically around nascent phagosomes in wild type and MacMARCKS null macrophages (Fig. 2) and depolymerized after particle internalization (data not shown). Talin, an actin-binding protein that colocalizes with actin during phagocytosis of zymosan (18Allen L.H. Aderem A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), was also found associated with phagosomes in MacMARCKS null macrophages. MARCKS also accumulated normally around nascent phagosomes, raising the possibility that MARCKS and MacMARCKS may have interchangeable functions during phagocytosis. 90 min after particle internalization, the lysosomal membrane marker, lamp-1, was found on zymosan-containing phagosomes in wild type and MacMARCKS null macrophages, suggesting that after particle internalization and subsequent actin depolymerization, phagosome maturation proceeded normally (data not shown). A requirement for MacMARCKS in phagocytosis and macrophage spreading has been proposed by Li and co-workers (9Zhu Z. Bao Z. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17652-17655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10Li J. Zhu Z. Bao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12985-12990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) based on experiments using the mouse macrophage cell line, J774. In their hands, expression of a mutant form of MacMARCKS lacking the effector domain in J774 cells inhibited phagocytosis of zymosan and prevented cell spreading (9Zhu Z. Bao Z. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17652-17655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10Li J. Zhu Z. Bao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12985-12990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because these observations were at variance with our data using MacMARCKS null macrophages, we attempted to reproduce the inhibition of macrophage functions observed by Li et al. (9Zhu Z. Bao Z. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17652-17655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10Li J. Zhu Z. Bao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12985-12990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). RAW 264 cells were stably transfected with cDNAs encoding HA-tagged wild type MacMARCKS or HA-tagged MacMARCKS lacking the effector domain. The RAW 264 macrophage cell line was chosen instead of J774 cells because they have a much higher transfection frequency, thereby giving us confidence that we were not selecting for rare cells that harbored other potential defects. Immunoblots of cell extracts demonstrated that a variety of independently derived cell lines expressed HA-tagged MacMARCKS and mutant MacMARCKS. Two independent lines expressing each of the HA-tagged proteins at approximately 2–5-fold higher levels than endogenous MacMARCKS were chosen for further study (Fig.3 A). No differences were seen in the phagocytic capacity of RAW cells expressing wild type or mutant MacMARCKS; the phagocytic indexes derived from 10,000 cells exposed to FITC-zymosan are shown in Table I. Immunolocalization of actin and HA-tagged MacMARCKS proteins to nascent phagosomes revealed that the wild type HA-tagged protein (MM-WT) accumulated together with actin around early phagosomes (Fig.3 B). In cells expressing HA-tagged MacMARCKS lacking the effector domain (MM-ΔED), actin accumulated normally around nascent phagosomes, but the HA-tagged protein did not colocalize with the actin (Fig. 3 B). In addition, endogenous, WT MacMARCKS was recruited normally to the forming phagocytic cup in cells expressing an excess of MM-ΔED (Fig. 4), suggesting that the mutant protein does not affect the localization or function of endogenous MacMARCKS. Also, none of the cell lines expressing MM-ΔED showed any defects in spreading (data not shown). The failure of this data to recapitulate the observations of Li and co-workers (9Zhu Z. Bao Z. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17652-17655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10Li J. Zhu Z. Bao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12985-12990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) is puzzling. It is possible that the J774 cells expressing the mutant MacMARCKS protein have some other defect that arose during selection and cloning. Alternatively, it is possible that there are redundant mechanisms in RAW 264 cells that are not present in J774 cells. However, given what is known about the functional domains of MARCKS and MacMARCKS (2Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 3Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is not clear how MM-ΔED acts as a dominant negative mutant; our data suggest that it does not.Table IPhagocytosis by macrophages expressing ΔED-MacMARCKScDNAClonePhagocytic indexNoneParental RAW 26484 ± 1MM-WTAC11.272 ± 1AB12.177 ± 1MM-ΔEDBG9.177 ± 1BF5.188 ± 1Untransfected RAW cells or two independent clones each expressing wild type or mutant forms of MacMARCKS were allowed to phagocytose FITC-zymosan. 10,000 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the phagocytic index for each cell line was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Figure 4MM-ΔED does not displace endogenous MacMARCKS from phagsosomes.

It is possible that MacMARCKS and MARCKS have identical or overlapping functions during phagocytosis and that in the absence of MacMARCKS, MARCKS activity is sufficient. This possibility is currently under investigation.

We also combined these mutations with the elimination of one or both of the possible regulatory N-terminal disulfides by mutating the corresponding cysteines.

The chloroplastic NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase (NADP MDH) 1The abbreviations used are: NADP MDH, NADP malate dehydrogenase; DEPC, diethyl pyrocarbonate; DTT, dithiothreitol; OAA, oxaloacetate; WT, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: NADP MDH, NADP malate dehydrogenase; DEPC, diethyl pyrocarbonate; DTT, dithiothreitol; OAA, oxaloacetate; WT, wild type. (1Hatch M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 895: 81-106Crossref Scopus (722) Google Scholar) (EC 1.1.1.82) catalyzes the reduction of oxaloacetate into malate. In C4-type plants, such as sorghum or maize, it belongs to the photosynthetic CO2 fixation pathway, allowing the export of the reducing power from the mesophyll to the bundle sheath chloroplasts (1Hatch M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 895: 81-106Crossref Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Among all the malate dehydrogenases, the NADP-dependent isoform exhibits a unique property: although NAD-dependent MDHs are permanently active, the NADP-dependent MDH is totally inactive in the oxidized form and activated through the ferredoxin/thioredoxin system by reduction of specific regulatory disulfides (2Johnson H.S. Hatch M.D. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 3Buchanan B.B. Schürmann P. Jacquot J-P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The disulfide bridges reduced by thioredoxin have been identified. The oxidized enzyme has two disulfide bonds per monomer: an N-terminal bond (cysteines 24 and 29) and a C-terminal bond (cysteines 365 and 377) (4Decottignies P. Schmitter J-M. Miginiac-Maslow M.

Luchetta P. Joly C. Decottignies P. Lepiniec L. Gadal P. Sallantin M. Huet J-C. Pernollet J-C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). When the corresponding four cysteines were mutated, the mutant protein was permanently active (5Issakidis E. Saarinen M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J-P. Crétin C. Gadal P. Miginiac-Maslow M. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the two regulatory disulfides played different functional roles. The C-terminal bridge is responsible for blocking the access of OAA to the active site. The reduction of the N-terminal disulfide triggers a slow conformational change at the active site that constitutes the rate-limiting step of the activation kinetics. Additional studies suggested that the conformational change is mediated by disulfide isomerization in which the reduction of the Cys24-Cys29 bridge is followed by the formation of a disulfide bridge between Cys24 and Cys207, located close to the active site. The newly created disulfide would then be reduced by thioredoxin, leading to a fully active enzyme when the C-terminal bridge is reduced (11Ruelland E. Lemaire-Chamley M. Le Maréchal P. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Djukic N. Miginiac-Maslow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19851-19857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Little is known about the mechanism by which the C-terminal disulfide shields access to the active site. Mutation of the two C-terminal cysteines of sorghum enzyme produced a protein that exhibited low but significant activity in the absence of reductant (5Issakidis E. Saarinen M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J-P. Crétin C. Gadal P. Miginiac-Maslow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3511-3517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), showing that the opening of the disulfide allowed OAA to reach the active site. A deletion of the seven-most C-terminal residues of the pea enzyme by a hydrolytic cleavage with carboxypeptidase also led to an enzyme exhibiting some spontaneous activity (i.e. activity without reduction), although the C-terminal bridge was still present (12Fickensher K. Scheibe R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 260: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This suggested that the C-terminal extension might be involved in the locking of the active site independently of the disulfide. A tentative interpretation of these observations was proposed on the basis of structural modeling (13Jackson R.M. Sessions RB. Holbrook J.J. J. Comput Aided Mol. Des. 1992; 6: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); it was predicted that the side-chain carboxyl of Glu388 and terminal carboxyl of Val389 would mimic OAA and interact with positively charged side chains of active-site arginines. The opening of the C-terminal bridge would lead to a displacement of the extension, thus unlocking the active site. In the present study, we investigated a possible role for the two C-terminal residues in the shielding of the active site by using site-directed mutagenesis either to delete the last two C-terminal residues or to eliminate the negative charge of the penultimate residue. The results support a docking model where the negatively charged C-terminal residues bind to positively charged residues of the active-site pocket. In addition, they show an interaction between the C-terminal and the N-terminal ends of the enzyme, with the release of the C-terminal extension being dependent on the conformational change triggered by the reduction of the N-terminal bridges. Restriction endonucleases, DNA modification enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and T4 DNA polymerase were obtained from Appligene. DEAE-Sephacel and Matrex red A chromatographic supports were respectively from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Grace-Amicon.

Bacteria were grown at 37 °C on Luria broth medium; ampicillin at 50 μg/ml was added when the bacteria carried plasmids conferring drug-resistance. The cDNAs encoding the NADP MDH where the Glu387 was replaced by a Gln (E387Q mutant protein) and the NADP MDH where the last two residues (Glu387 and Val388) were deleted (mutant Δ(E387V388)) were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the method of Kunkel (16Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar) The single-stranded M13 template used was M13mdh, a vector in which the wild-type NADP MDH cDNA is cloned (17Issakidis E.

The sequences of the mutagenic oligonucleotides used for the E387Q and the ΔEV mutations are, respectively, 5′-CTACCGGGACAAGTGTAGTTTAG-3′ and 5′-CTACCGGGATAGTTTAGTTAC-3′. A screening of the mutants was performed by sequencing single-stranded M13 DNA obtained from a few plaque isolates. A clone of each mutation was selected, and the entire cDNAs were sequenced to make sure no undesired mutations were present. The NcoI-BamHI fragment of both mutated MDH cDNAs were transferred to a pET vector for production of the modified proteins, leading to vectors pET-mdh(E387Q) and pET-mdh(Δ(E387V388)). The cDNAs containing the combined mutations C29S/C207A/E387Q and C29S/C207A/Δ(E387V388) were obtained by exchanging the NheI-NheI fragment of pET-mdh(C29S/C207A/C365A/C377A) (11Ruelland E. Lemaire-Chamley M. Le Maréchal P. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Djukic N. Miginiac-Maslow M. J. Biol.

The cDNAs containing the combined mutations C29S/E387Q and C29S/Δ(E387V388) or C207A/E387Q and C207A/Δ(E387V388) were obtained by exchanging the NheI-NheI fragment of pET-mdh(C29S/C365A/C377A) or pET-mdh(C207A/C365A/C377A) (11Ruelland E.

To obtain the cDNA coding for the NADP MDH with the double mutation C29S/C207A, the NheI-NheI fragment of pET-mdh (C29S/C207A/Δ(E387V388)) was exchanged for the corresponding fragment pET-mdh(C182A). As theNheI-NheI fragment of pET-mdh(C182A) does not have any mutation, a pET-mdh(C29S/C207A) was created. The DNA sequencing was done using the dideoxy chain termination method (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) (T7 sequencing kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For every mutated cDNA, the sequence of the whole NcoI/BamHI fragment in the expression vector was checked before recombinant protein production. The mutated NADP MDHs were produced using the pET/BL21 production system. The experimental procedures for the production of the mutated proteins and for the preparation of soluble protein extracts from E. coli were described in Issakidis et al. (17Issakidis E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J-P. Crétin C. Gadal P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21577-21583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The main steps consisted of ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, and affinity chromatography on Matrex Red A. When needed, a hydrophobic interaction step on TSK phenyl 5PW column was added. The NADP MDH was then dialyzed against 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 1 mmEDTA and concentrated. Proteins were separated by vertical SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis following the method of Schägger and Von Jagow (19Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). They were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The N-terminal sequence of the purified proteins was verified with an Applied Biosystems model 476A automated sequencer equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin derivative analyzer. Malate dehydrogenase activity of crude extracts and purified samples was assayed by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm at 30 °C. The enzyme was activated at 25 °C in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, by 20 μm E. coli thioredoxin (purified as in Ref. 20de Lamotte-Guéry F. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Stein M. Minard P. Jacquot J-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and 10 mm DTT. NADP MDH activity was measured on aliquots in a standard assay mixture (1 ml) containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 750 μm oxaloacetate, and 140 μm NADPH, unless otherwise indicated. The K m values for NADPH and oxaloacetate were measured with preactivated enzymes, unless otherwise indicated by varying the concentration of one of the substrates at a saturating concentration of the other. S0.5 for thioredoxin were determined by measuring the initial rates of NADP MDH activation in the presence of different concentrations of thioredoxin. The sensitivity of the various mutants to inhibition by DEPC was tested by adding the reagent at a 1 mm concentration either before or after the activation of the enzymes by reduced thioredoxin using incubation conditions described previously (9Lemaire M.

Jacquot J-P. Miginiac-Maslow M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was measured on aliquots as a function of time. Protection by NADPH was performed by adding the reduced cofactor (1 mm) before DEPC treatment. A model of the three-dimensional structure of sorghum MDH was made using the program MODELLER (21Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10294) Google Scholar). The coordinates of the Thermus flavusMDH (pdb ID:1bmd), the structure having the highest amino acid sequence identity (50%) to that of the sorghum enzyme, were used as a template. The N- and C-terminal extensions, characteristic for the NADP MDHs, are not present in any of the other solved MDH structures; hence these regions could not be modeled. The program AUTODOCK (22Goodsell D.S. Olson A.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 8: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar) was used to dock a dipeptide corresponding to the last two C-terminal amino acids, Glu387 and Val388, into the active site of the sorghum MDH model. This program randomly maneuvers a ligand to simultaneously determine both the optimum position and conformation of a ligand bound to its macromolecule receptor. This was done through Monte-Carlo-simulated annealing with rapid energy evaluation by means of affinity grids. The grid used in the present study consisted of 120 × 120 × 120 points with 0.4 Å spacing between each point and was centered around the NADP in the active site. For the purposes of energy calulation, polar hydrogens were added to both the protein and the dipeptide ligand. Charges were from Wener et al. (23Wener S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagona G. Profeta Jr., S. Weiner P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4847) Google Scholar), and potential parameters were as supplied by the software authors. Each Monte-Carlo cycle consisted in the evaluation of 3000 configurations. 50 independent cycles were carried out, and the energetically best configuration among all of them was taken to be the final “docked” configuration. To evaluate the roles of the negative charges of the penultimate Glu387 and of the C-terminal Val388 in the lack of activity of the oxidized form of NADP-malate dehydrogenase, two mutated proteins were created by site-directed mutagenesis. In the first one, the negatively charged side chain of Glu387 was replaced by the neutral side chain of Gln (E387Q mutant), and in the second one, the two most C-terminal residues were deleted (ΔEV mutant). After production in E. coli, both mutant proteins were purified, and their biochemical properties were analyzed. If the mutations of C-terminal negative charges were able to mimic the substitution of the Cys of the C-terminal disulfide, the mutants should exhibit the specific features of the latter, i.e. (I) WT-like, thioredoxin-dependent, activation kinetics, (II) total lack of inhibition of the activation by NADP, (III) discrete spontaneous activity (5% that of the activity of the reduced form), (IV) total inhibition by DEPC added before activation (5Issakidis E. Saarinen M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J-P. Crétin C. Gadal P. Miginiac-Maslow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3511-3517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As predicted, the activation time courses of both mutant proteins were similar to that of the WT protein, and NADP did not inhibit the activation (Fig.1). No activation was observed with the chemical reductant DTT (data not shown). S0.5 for thioredoxins and kinetic characteristics (K m or kcat) of the activated enzymes were not significantly different from those of the WT enzyme (data not shown). However, the mutant enzymes did not exhibit any activity in the oxidized form, which suggested that the access to the active site was still locked. Nevertheless, DEPC partially inhibited the mutant proteins when added before activation, and NADPH protected against inhibition (Fig.2), indicating that DEPC targeted the active-site histidine, like in the unactivated C-terminal Cys mutants and all of the fully activated proteins (9Lemaire M.

Then the pH was raised to 7.9, the activation medium (10 mm DTT + 20 μm thioredoxin) was added, and the activation followed by the appearance of activity as a function of time. The controls were preincubated with an equivalent volume of ethanol (final concentration: 5%). The results are expressed as the percentage of maximum activity. In these conditions, DEPC had no effect on the WT enzyme. For the protection by the cofactor experiment, 1 mm of NADPH was added before DEPC treatment. Similar results were obtained with ΔEV mutant.

The first set of mutations combined the removal of the C-terminal negative charges with the total elimination of the N-terminal disulfides. In these mutants the active site should have reached its optimal catalytic conformation. The cDNAs of NADP MDH bearing the mutations C29S/C207A (a control with no N-terminal disulfide but with the C-terminal negative charges being still present), C29S/C207A/E387Q, or C29S/C207A/ΔEV were created. The corresponding proteins were produced and purified. The C29S/C207A NADP MDH was very similar in behavior to the previously studied C24S/C29S mutant (17Issakidis E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J-P. Crétin C. Gadal P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21577-21583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); it had no spontaneous activity, was activated much faster than the WT protein, and was strictly dependent on reduced thioredoxin for activation. In contrast, the C29S/C207A/E387Q or C29S/C207A/ΔEV mutants (Fig. 3) exhibited a high spontaneous activity, which could be fully inhibited by DEPC (Fig.4). They were activated by reduced thioredoxins almost instantaneously and also by DTT alone, although at a much slower rate. A comparison of the K m values for both the oxidized and reduced enzymes (TableI) revealed no significant differences in the apparent affinity for NADPH, whereas the K m for OAA was dramatically increased in the oxidized forms. The spontaneous activities of the oxidized forms, measured at saturating OAA concentrations, were 95% that of the activities of the corresponding reduced forms. The oxidized mutants thus appeared to differ from the reduced ones only by their lowerk cat/K m ratios (Table I).Figure 4Sensitivity to DEPC of NADP MDHs combining C-terminal mutations with the suppression of the N-terminal disulfides.

The spontaneous activity rate was determined by measuring activity before and after activation by 20 μm thioredoxin and 10 mm DTT; activities were measured in the presence of saturating concentrations of substrate (3.75 mm OAA for the oxidized enzymes, 780 μm OAA for the reduced enzymes) in 100 mmTris, pH 7.9. Open table in a new tab The K m for substrates of the oxidized proteins were determined either by varying NADPH from 2.8 to 280 μm at the saturating concentration (3.75 mm) of oxaloacetate or oxaloacetate from 7.5 μm to 7.5 mm at the saturating concentration (140 μm) of NADPH.

The spontaneous activity rate was determined by measuring activity before and after activation by 20 μm thioredoxin and 10 mm DTT; activities were measured in the presence of saturating concentrations of substrate (3.75 mm OAA for the oxidized enzymes, 780 μm OAA for the reduced enzymes) in 100 mmTris, pH 7.9. The dramatic modifications brought about by the mutation of a single C-terminal negative charge in an MDH devoid of its N-terminal disulfides clearly show that this negative charge plays a major role in blocking the access of OAA to the active site but indicate that the N-terminal extension also plays a role in this mechanism. In a second set of experiments, the role of the reduction of each of the N-terminal disulfides in unblocking the active site has been examined separately by creating combined mutants where only one of the two possible N-terminal disulfides was eliminated. The most striking difference in these mutants, compared with the mutants having no N-terminal disulfide left, is their very low spontaneous activity, ranging from undetectable (C29S/E387Q) to 5% (C29S/ΔEV) at saturating OAA concentration. Their other features resembled those of the mutants missing both N-terminal disulfides: high K m OAA of the oxidized forms (TableI), fast activation kinetics in the presence of reduced thioredoxin (Table II), and ability to be activated by DTT alone at a slow rate (Table II). The accessibility of their active sites was demonstrated by the inhibition of the unactivated enzymes by DEPC (Fig. 5 and6). In contrast, the single N-terminal mutants C29S and C207A were strictly thioredoxin-dependent (Table II) and totally insensitive to DEPC (11Ruelland E. Lemaire-Chamley M. Le Maréchal P. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Djukic N. Miginiac-Maslow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19851-19857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Plots of the activities of combined C-terminal mutants having either one N-terminal disulfide left or no N-terminal disulfide as a function of OAA concentration (Fig. 7) made it clear that when no N-terminal bridge is left, the oxidized enzyme is able to reach the same V max as the reduced form but only at a substantially higher OAA concentration. Thus the reduction of the C-terminal disulfide is still required for the enzyme to reach full catalytic efficiency. In contrast, when an N-terminal disulfide is still present, the oxidized enzyme cannot reach more than 4% that of the activity of the reduced form. This experiment also illustrates the fact that an activation time course, which is performed at a concentration that is saturating for the reduced enzyme, but not for the oxidized enzyme, to prevent substrate inhibition from developing during the activation process, reflects not only the increase inV max but also the decrease inK m during the conformational change of the active site into its high efficiency form.Table IIActivation parameters of mutant NADP-MDHst1/2Activation by 20 μm thioredoxin and 10 mmDTTActivation by 10 mm DTTminC207A1NoneC207A/E387Q0.2525C207A/ΔEV0.2520C29S0.75NoneC29S/E387Q15C29S/ΔEV0.754The purified preparations of the wild-type and mutant NADP-MDHs were activated by either 20 μm thioredoxin and 10 mm DTT or by 10 mm DTT.

The oxidized WT MDH is a very compact enzyme, insensitive to derivatization agents and chemical reductants, inaccessible to OAA, and exclusively reducible by thioredoxin. Previous studies showed that its structure was loosened upon activation (24Miginiac-Maslow M. Issakidis E. Lemaire M. Ruelland E. Jacquot J-P. Decottignies P. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 24: 529-542Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Scheibe R. Geissler A. Rother T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and that the C-terminal disulfide was responsible for blocking access of OAA to the active site (5Issakidis E. Saarinen M. Decottignies P. Jacquot J-P. Crétin C. Gadal P. Miginiac-Maslow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3511-3517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of the present study demonstrate that the negative charge of the penultimate Glu387 is directly involved in this blocking. In fact, all the enzymes mutated at this residue acquired some of the features of the C-terminal Cys mutants, in particular the ability to be inhibited by DEPC in the unactivated form. For all of them, a protection by NADPH was observed, indicating that the target of DEPC was the active-site His. The sensitivity to DEPC was enhanced by the additional mutation of N-terminal disulfides, which does not confer any DEPC sensitivity per se. The characteristics of the ΔEV mutant proteins were not fundamentally different from those introduced by the mutation of the single Glu387, indicating that most of the effects are because of the carboxyl group of this single residue. The sensitivity to DEPC is not paralleled by the appearance of a spontaneous activity in the single C-terminal charge mutants, showing that the access to the active site is more restricted than in the C365A/C377A mutant. Thus, even in the absence of the penultimate carboxyl, a steric hindrance remains, certainly because of the fact that the C-terminal disulfide still maintains the C-terminal extension in a conformation unfavorable for activity. Three negatively charged residues are still present in the extension (D378, E381, D382: Ref.6) and might repel OAA. In contrast, DEPC is a hydrophobic reagent, with no negative charges and, thus, should be able to reach the active site more easily. When the removal of the N-terminal disulfide(s) is combined with the mutation of the C-terminal negative charges, a spontaneous activity is observed in most of the oxidized enzymes. This activity is particularly high when both N-terminal disulfides are absent, a situation where the conformation of the active site is catalytically optimal. In this case, the oxidized enzymes can reach full activity but only at high OAA concentration. This result shows that the oxidized C-terminal extension impairs to some extent the access to the active site and also makes clear the cooperativity between events occurring at the N terminus and those occurring at the C terminus. Indeed, the proteins devoid of N-terminal disulfides have no spontaneous activity at all if the penultimate Glu is present. Thus it is obvious that the conformational change triggered by the reduction of the N-terminal disulfides helps release the C-terminal extension from the active site. A tentative scheme of the structural modifications brought about by the different combinations of mutations is presented in Fig.8. The ability of DTT alone (in the absence of thioredoxin) to activate MDH is also an indication of loosening of the structure. The C29S, C207A, and C29S/C207A mutants as well as the E387Q or ΔEV mutants are strictly dependent on reduced thioredoxin for activity. Combining mutations at both ends yields proteins that can be fully activated by DTT alone, although at a much slower rate. In this regard, the C29S/C207A/E387Q mutant is particularly interesting as only one disulfide, i.e. the Cys365-Cys377disulfide, remains in this mutant. When comparing it to the strictly thioredoxin-dependent C29S/C207A mutant protein, it appears that the additional mutation of Glu387 renders the 365–377 disulfide accessible to DTT. An increase in the activation rates by reduced thioredoxin can also be noted (Table II), consistent with a synergistic interaction between the N-terminal extension and the C-terminal extension during the activation process. The results of the present study support an internal inhibition model for the mechanism by which the C-terminal extension shields the access to the active site in the oxidized enzyme. Obviously the penultimate C-terminal residue is involved in the oxidative inhibition process via its negative charge. It is also clearly responsible for the NADP inhibition effect. The coenzyme binding site is accessible from the outside in NADP MDH, even in the unactivated enzyme. This suggests that the C-terminal extension can enter deep into the active site. This interpretation is supported by modeling the NADP MDH structure (Fig.9) using the coordinates of the T. flavus NAD-MDH (26Kelly C.A. Nishiyama M. Ohnishi Y. Beppu T. Birktoft J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3913-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), which shares 50% identity with the former. In particular, the overall length of the C-terminal extension is sufficient to reach the active-site residues, and the C-terminal dipeptide can be perfectly docked into the active site, mimicking the substrate OAA. However, a definite demonstration of autoinhibition of NADP MDH by its C-terminal extension would require identification of the positively charged partners of the negatively charged C-terminal residues. The experiments reported are also the first indication that during the activation process, the conformational change of the active site and its unshielding may act synergistically. Intrasteric inhibition is well documented in the case of protein kinases (27Kemp B. Pearson R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), where an amino acid stretch in the protein sequence functions as a pseudo-substrate. Other proteins are autoinhibited through the closure of a mobile lid over the active-site pocket (28Andersson A. Jordan D. Schneider G. Linqvist V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). NADP MDH exhibits the unique feature of combining an intrasteric inhibition with a conformational change linked to disulfide isomerization. The inhibition of its activity under oxidative conditions appears to be very complex, especially because its activation is prevented by the oxidized form of the cofactor by a mechanism that is still poorly understood.

Because of this operational asymmetry, we studied variants in which right-side-out (RSO) or inside-out (ISO) orientations could be analyzed independently to ask whether the inward- and outward-facing UhpT surfaces have different substrate specificities. To study the RSO orientation, we constructed a histidine-tagged derivative, His10K291C/K294N, in which the sole external tryptic cleavage site (Lys294) had been removed. Functional assay as well as immunoblot analysis showed that trypsin treatment of proteoliposomes containing His10K291C/K294N led to loss of about 50% of the original population, reflecting retention of only the RSO population. To study the ISO orientation, we used a His10V284C derivative, in which a newly inserted external cysteine (Cys284) conferred sensitivity to the thiol-reactive agent, 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin. In this case, 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin treatment of proteoliposomes containing His10V284C gave about a 60% loss of activity, and immunodetection of biotin showed parallel modification of an equivalent fraction of the original population. Together, such findings indicate that the UhpT RSO and ISO orientations are in about equal proportion in proteoliposomes and that a single population can be generated by exposure of these derivatives to the appropriate agent. This allowed us to study proteoliposomes with UhpT functioning in RSO orientation (His10K291C/K294N) or ISO orientation (His10V284C) with respect to the kinetics of glucose 6-phosphate transport by phosphate-loaded proteoliposomes and also the inhibitions found with 2-deoxy-glucose 6-phosphate, mannose 6-phosphate, galactose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, and inorganic phosphate. We found no significant differences in the behavior of UhpT in its different orientations, indicating that the transporter possesses an overall functional symmetry. UhpT, the sugar phosphate transporter ofEscherichia coli, acts to exchange internal inorganic phosphate for external hexose 6-phosphate.

We found no significant differences in the behavior of UhpT in its different orientations, indicating that the transporter possesses an overall functional symmetry. In Escherichia coli, the uhp locus (foruptake of hexose phosphates) coordinates the expression of four proteins responsible for incorporation of external sugar phosphate. UhpA and UhpB together form a two-component regulatory system that activates expression of the transporter, UhpT, after extracellular G6P binds to the membrane receptor, UhpC (1Kadner R.J. Webber C.A. Island M.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 637-645PubMed Google Scholar). UhpT then acts to move sugar 6-phosphate inward in exchange for internal inorganic phosphate (2Sonna L.A.

Biol. 1998; 164: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) all argue that UhpT has 12 transmembrane α-helices and that its N and C termini lie in the cytoplasm (see Fig. 1). Accordingly, the structure of UhpT (and related transporters) is strongly asymmetric along an axis perpendicular to the membrane surface. This fact, along with the biochemical asymmetry of the in vivo reaction, in which external sugar phosphate can exchanged for internal phosphate, raises the question of whether UhpT has an inherent bias in substrate preference at its extracellular and intracellular surfaces.To address this issue, we used an in vitro preparation in which purified protein can be studied in proteoliposomes loaded with inorganic phosphate. Because proteoliposomes might have UhpT in either (or both) a right-side-out (RSO) 1The abbreviations used are: RSO, right-side-out; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; ISO, inside-out; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MPB, 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TM, transmembrane α-helix. 1The abbreviations used are: RSO, right-side-out; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; ISO, inside-out; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MPB, 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TM, transmembrane α-helix. or inside-out (ISO) orientation, we also designed UhpT derivatives in which one or the other of these orientations could be eliminated by exposure to an appropriate blocking agent. For example, in one case we reasoned that the high proportion of lysine and arginine residues at the UhpT inner surface would confer sensitivity to trypsin (see Fig. 1). To exploit any such side-specific trypsin sensitivity, we constructed a variant lacking the sole tryptic cleavage site at the UhpT extracellular surface (Lys294), so that only RSO molecules would survive exposure to protease. Alternatively, we inserted cysteine (Cys284) into the same extracellular loop (see Fig. 1), creating a mutant inhibitable by low concentrations of MPB, a thiol-reactive agent without effect on wild type UhpT (9Matos M. Fann M.-C. Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18571-18575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); in this case, only ISO molecules would remain active after MPB exposure.Study of these variants suggests that the RSO and ISO forms are present in about equal proportions in proteoliposomes. This finding, in turn, made it possible to ask whether the two orientations showed differential substrate specificity. For this purpose, we conducted a simple kinetic study of G6P transport by proteoliposomes containing UhpT in mixed, RSO, and ISO orientations and also evaluated the inhibitions exerted by alternative UhpT substrates. We found no substantial differences in the behavior of UhpT in its different orientations, indicating that the transporter possesses functional symmetry.RESULTSEarly work showed that addition of trypsin to sensitized intact cells leads to cleavage of wild type UhpT but not of a variant lacking Lys294 (9Matos M. Fann M.-C. Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18571-18575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies in proteoliposomes appeared to contradict this finding, because even mutants lacking Lys294 had some deficit after exposure to protease (see below). A simple explanation for this discrepancy is that UhpT exists in mixed orientation in proteoliposomes, with some molecules inserted RSO and others ISO. Thus, the partial trypsin sensitivity of Lys294 variants would reflect cleavage of the ISO orientation but not the RSO population. This hypothesis prompted us to develop two UhpT variants, His10K291C/K294N and His10V284C (see “Experimental Procedures”), whose properties would allow us to evaluate the proportion of RSO and ISO forms in proteoliposomes and to characterize the properties of each orientation.Comparison of His10UhpT with His10K291C/K294N and His10V284CThe variants studied in this work each have a polyhistidine N-terminal extension to facilitate protein purification (10Tamai E. Fann M.-C. Tsuchiya T. Maloney P.C. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The parental molecule, His10UhpT, was otherwise wild type in sequence. In one derivative, His10K291C/K294N, Lys291 and Lys294 were replaced by cysteine and asparagine, respectively, thereby eliminating tryptic cleavage site(s) 2Prior study concluded that Lys294was the only trypsin-accessible residue at the UhpT extracellular surface (9Matos M. Fann M.-C. Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18571-18575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This is true for the conditions originally tested (9Matos M. Fann M.-C. Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18571-18575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but Lys291 also serves as a cleavage site at the high levels of trypsin (1 mg/ml) used in these experiments. exposed in the extracellular loop between TM7 and TM8 (Fig.1). Using this variant, we anticipated that only RSO molecules would survive exposure of proteoliposomes to trypsin. In a second derivative, His10V284C, we placed a cysteine in the same extracellular loop (Fig. 1) to provide a target for the thiol-reactive agent, MPB (9Matos M. Fann M.-C. Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18571-18575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); here, we expected MPB modification of Cys284 to inhibit the RSO but spare ISO proteins.Initial experiments showed that each variant could be purified in high yield, and a simple kinetic study of [14C]G6P transport showed comparable behavior for both wild type and mutant proteins (Fig.2); maximal velocities were within a 2-fold range, and in each case we recorded a Michaelis constant (K m) of about 50 μm. We confirmed that treatment of His10K291C/K294N proteoliposomes with trypsin and His10V284C proteoliposomes with MPB gave partial inhibitions (about 50% in each case) as expected if both RSO and ISO populations were present (data not shown; see below). In those cases, we also found that the K m for G6P transport was largely unaffected by treatment with trypsin or MPB. Thus, with His10K291C/K294N we noted K m values of 64 and 67 μm, respectively, for the control and trypsin-treated material, whereas with His10V284C, we foundK m values of 32 and 39 μm for control and MPB-treated preparations. These findings would suggest that the RSO and ISO orientations have comparable kinetic responses to G6P (K m values of 67 and 39 μm, respectively), if it can be shown that trypsin and MPB act in the manner predicted. In the experiments described below, therefore, our first goal was to provide direct evidence that these probes function as expected.Figure 2Kinetics of His10UhpT and its derivatives. His10UhpT (○) and its derivatives, His10K291C/K294N (■) and His10V284C (▵) were purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography (10Tamai E. Fann M.-C. Tsuchiya T. Maloney P.C. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and reconstituted in phosphate-loaded proteoliposomes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Initial rates of [14C]G6P transport were measured by 2-min incubations with substrate. Maximal velocities of 2.7, 1.3, and 3.1 μmol/min/mg protein were found for His10UhpT, His10K291C/K294N, and His10V284C, respectively. A K m of 50 μm was derived for each protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)RSO Molecules Remain after Exposure of His10K291C/K294N Proteoliposomes to TrypsinThe tryptic cleavage site at the UhpT extracellular surface is absent in His10K291C/K294N, leading one to expect that only the lysine/arginine-rich intracellular surface of ISO forms would be sensitive to external trypsin. To test this prediction we studied trypsin sensitivity with proteoliposomes containing either His10UhpT or His10K291C/K294N (Fig. 3). Both proteins showed partial sensitivity at low levels of trypsin (<10–100 μg/ml), whereas at higher levels (>100 μg/ml), although His10UhpT continued to display sensitivity, His10K291C/K294N never fell below about 55% of its initial activity (Fig. 3 A). These findings are consistent with degradation of both RSO and ISO forms of His10UhpT but loss of only the ISO population of His10K291C/K294N, and direct tests fully support this interpretation. For example, immunoblots using a C-terminal antibody confirmed that trypsin had acted on the entire His10UhpT population but on only a subset of the His10K291C/K294N present (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–4). A similar conclusion came after examination of duplicate gels probed with the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-conjugated peroxidase designed to detect the polyhistidine N terminus (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5–8). Thus, cleavage at Lys294 in the RSO population should generate an 18-kDa N-terminal fragment and a 33-kDa C-terminal peptide, and, in fact, both products are visualized in the appropriate blots (arrows in Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and6). (The 18-kDa fragment shows poor recovery, perhaps because small hydrophobic proteins are not well retained on nitrocellulose during transfer from the parent gel.) In this same experiment, we also monitored transport of [14C]G6P (Fig.3 C), and those data, too, supported the idea that trypsin targets both RSO and ISO forms of His10UhpT but only ISO molecules of His10K291C/K294N. Moreover, from the residual activity in His10K291C/K294N (55%), one would conclude that the RSO and ISO forms were present in equal proportion; as noted later, this reduction in activity is quantitatively matched by loss of immunoreactivity at 50 kDa (see below). Together, these data indicate that RSO and ISO orientations are present in about equal amounts after reconstitution of UhpT and that preparations containing only the RSO population can be generated by trypsin treatment of His10K291C/K294N.Figure 3Effects of trypsin on proteoliposomes containing His10UhpT and His10K291C/K294N.Proteoliposomes were treated with trypsin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, after exposure to trypsin at the indicated concentrations, the initial rate of G6P transport was estimated by a 5-min incubation with labeled substrate. Rates are expressed as a fraction of the initial value. B, proteoliposomes treated with 1 mg/ml trypsin were processed for SDS-PAGE, and in duplicate gels protein was visualized by either the C-terminal-specific antibody (lanes 1–4) or by the N-terminal polyhistidine detection system (lanes 5–9). In each gel, His10UhpT is shown at the left(lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6); His10K291C/K294N is shown at the right(lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8); control liposomes (no protein) treated with trypsin are shown inlane 9. The arrow and arrowheadindicate, respectively, the N-terminal 18-kDa fragment and C-terminal 33-kDa fragment expected of tryptic cleavage at Lys294 in His10UhpT.

To document the activity of the remaining ISO population, we next studied His10V284C, in which a V284C substitution confers high sensitivity to the thiol-reactive agent, MPB (9Matos M. Fann M.-C.

Proteoliposomes containing His10UhpT were not responsive to MPB at concentrations as high as 200 μm, but we found a clear sensitivity on the part of His10V284C, whose activity was reduced by 60% (Fig.4 A), as anticipated if only the RSO population of His10V284C is inhibitable by the maleimide. With this assumption, the data indicate 50% inhibition of the RSO molecules at 10–15 μm MPB. Matos et al. (9Matos M. Fann M.-C. Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18571-18575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) had found a considerably higher apparent sensitivity for this same mutation (50% inhibition at 1 μm MPB), but this may be expected because they exposed for both longer time (10 minversus 2 min) and at higher temperature (23 °Cversus 4 °C). In this experiment (Fig. 4), we had also exposed MPB-treated and untreated proteoliposomes to the impermeant thiol-reactive probe, [2-(trimethylammonium)-ethyl]methane-thiosulfonate (13Fu D.

In that case, inhibition of activity (by 55%) was found only for the preparation not previously exposed to MPB (data not shown), supporting the idea that MPB reactivity was confined to the RSO population.Figure 4Effects of MPB on proteoliposomes containing His10UhpT and His10V284C.

Rates are normalized to the untreated control value.B, proteoliposomes exposed to 200 μm MPB were processed for SDS-PAGE, and samples containing His10UhpT (lanes 1–3) or His10V284C (lanes 4–6) were analyzed by immunoblot in the presence (lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6) or absence (lanes 1 and 4) of 8 μg/ml streptavidin (9Matos M. Fann M.-C. Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18571-18575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In two cases (lanes 3 and 6) proteoliposomes were solubilized with 0.5% SDS before labeling with MPB and streptavidin.C, in the same experiment, [14C]G6P transport was measured for the control (open symbols) and MPB-treated (black symbols) preparations of His10UhpT (left panel) and His10V284C (right panel). Values are the means ± S.E. of triplicate measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To show MPB modification directly, we used streptavidin to generate a His10V284C-biotin-streptavidin complex whose formation is reflected by loss of immunoreactivity at 50 kDa and its partial recovery at 80–90 kDa (9Matos M. Fann M.-C. Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18571-18575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (Fig.4 B). 3We noted here, as reported before (9Matos M. Fann M.-C. Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18571-18575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), that reactivity of this complex to the anti-UhpT antibody was inefficient, likely because of steric hindrance caused by bound streptavidin. As a result, formation of the complex with streptavidin is judged by loss of immunoreactivity at 50 kDa. We found no evidence of such a complex after MPB treatment of His10UhpT proteoliposomes (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and2) unless endogenous cysteines had been exposed by a preincubation with SDS. By contrast, denaturation was not required for formation of the complex in parallel trials with His10V284C (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4 and 5). Assays of [14C]G6P transport in this same experiment confirmed that MPB modification was, in fact, associated with inhibition of function (Fig. 4 C and see below).Distribution of RSO and ISO Orientations in ProteoliposomesIn several experiments, we assessed the relative loss of sugar phosphate transport caused by treatment with trypsin or MPB and compared this with the fraction of protein that remained unmodified as monitored by immunoblots. Both measurements showed parallel change (Table I), and use of either data set leads one to conclude that proteoliposomes contain RSO and ISO orientations in roughly equal proportion.Table IDistribution of RSO and ISO orientations in proteoliposomesExperimentFraction remainingActivityProteinHis10K291C/K294N ± trypsinI0.560.61II0.480.38III0.550.39Mean0.530.46His10V284C ± MPBI0.330.32II0.380.36III0.460.59Mean0.380.43In experiments similar to those of Figs. 3 and 4, [14C]G6P transport remaining after treatment with trypsin or MPB was measured, and the fraction of protein unaffected by treatment was estimated by densitometric comparison of control and treated preparations after SDS-PAGE. Open table in a new tab Functional Equivalence of RSO and ISO OrientationsIn the preliminary work comparing His10UhpT with its derivatives, His10K291C/K294N and His10V284C, we noted no significant change of K m for sugar phosphate transport when proteoliposomes were treated to generate the single orientations (see above). This may now be interpreted as evidence that the two orientations have similar kinetic features during G6P transport. To extend this analysis, we measured apparent inhibition constants (K i values) derived by competition between [14C]G6P and a number of alternate substrates. The experiments shown in Fig. 5 give examples of such work using a substrate of relatively high affinity (fructose 6-phosphate, K i ≈ 0.2 mm) and one of relatively low affinity (phosphate, K i ≈ 3–5 mm); a number of other experiments of this sort are summarized by Table II. Collectively, those data show that the two UhpT orientations respond in equivalent fashions to the five substrates tested and that the ratio of derivedK i values (RSO/ISO) varies no more than 2-fold for substrates of physiological significance (14Maloney P.C. Ambudkar S.V. Anantharam V. Sonna L.A. Varadhachary A. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such tests were conducted using proteoliposomes loaded with inorganic phosphate, but in two additional experiments (not shown) we studied His10V284C (± MPB) in G6P-loaded proteoliposomes. In that case, apparent K i values for inorganic phosphate were the same as before (Fig. 5 and Table II). Together with the data noted in Fig. 5 and Table II, these findings lead us to conclude that the two orientations of UhpT are functionally equivalent with respect to processing of fructose 6-phosphate, mannose 6-phosphate, 2-deoxoxyG6P, galactose 6-phosphate, and inorganic phosphate.Figure 5Apparent K i values for fructose 6-phosphate and inorganic phosphate.[14C]G6P transport was measured in the absence and presence of fructose 6-phosphate (top panels) or inorganic phosphate (bottom panels) using proteoliposomes containing UhpT of mixed orientation (open symbols) or uniform orientation (closed symbols). The protein used to obtain RSO or ISO orientations is indicated on the individual graphs. Dotted lines intersect the abscissa at the apparent K ivalue. Given a purely competitive interaction with G6P, for these assay conditions the apparent K i should be about 80% of the true K i.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IIApparent Ki values of UhpT substrates measured with proteoliposomes containing protein of mixed, RSO, or ISO orientationTest substrateK iHis10UhpTHis10K291C/K294N ± trypsinHis10V284C ± MPBRSO + ISORSO + ISORSORSO + ISOISOμm2-Deoxy-G6P60 ± 20120 ± 10150 ± 5060 ± 1080 ± 10Mannose 6-phosphate90120 ± 20100 ± 3090 ± 10150 ± 20Fructose 6-phosphate110200 ± 30240 ± 60190 ± 10240 ± 10Galactose 6-phosphate3600 ± 500380036003200 ± 1003900 ± 700Phosphate1300 ± 5004800 ± 1005100 ± 4001900 ± 3002500 ± 300As in Fig. 5, Ki values (where specified, ± S.E. from three separate experiments) were determined for the indicated compounds, using His10UhpT, His10K291C/K294N, and His10V284C along with appropriate treatments (± trypsin or ± MPB) to generate RSO or ISO orientations.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15358-15366Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and those findings suggest a variable result depending not only on the method of reconstitution but perhaps also on the protein in question and the detergent or phospholipid employed (reviewed in Ref. 20Rigaud J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar; see also Ref. 21Knol J. Veenhoff L. Liang W.-J. Henderson P.J.F. Leblanc G. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15358-15366Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A simple argument developed by Rigaud (20Rigaud J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and others (21Knol J. Veenhoff L. Liang W.-J. Henderson P.J.F. Leblanc G. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15358-15366Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) suggests that if reconstitution proceeds by insertion of protein into preformed detergent-destabilized liposomes, one might anticipate a population of uniform orientation due to preferential insertion of the hydrophobic sector into the lipid bilayer. Because the cytoplasmic surface of most membrane proteins is considerably more hydrophilic than the extracellular face, this approach predicts recovery of proteins in a largely ISO orientation, as observed with the Ca2+-ATPase (19Vigneron L. Scarborough G.A. Ruysschaert J.-M. Goormaghtigh E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1236: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), the sodium/proline symporter (22Jung H. Tebbe S. Schmid R.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15358-15366Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). By contrast, if reconstitution proceeds from mixed micelles, as in the method used here, the final population is more likely to be of mixed orientation; this latter expectation may also be favored if, as here, the use of high lipid/protein ratios avoids protein packing considerations by ensuring only a single transporter per proteoliposome (3Ambudkar S.V. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10079-10086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite such arguments, it is clear that direct tests must be used to evaluate each case.In our work with UhpT, a simple detergent-dilution protocol was used for reconstitution at a high lipid-to-protein ratio (3Ambudkar S.V.

Little is known about the factors that control the in vivo assembly and conversion of these clusters. In this study we have designed and constructed a 3Fe to 4Fe cluster conversion variant of Azotobacter vinelandiiferredoxin I (FdI) in which the sequence that ligates the [3Fe-4S] cluster in native FdI was altered by converting a nearby residue, Thr-14, to Cys. Spectroscopic and electrochemical characterization shows that when purified in the presence of dithionite, T14C FdI is an O2-sensitive 8Fe protein. Both the new and the indigenous clusters have reduction potentials that are significantly shifted compared with those in native FdI, strongly suggesting a significantly altered environment around the clusters. Interestingly, whole cell EPR have revealed that T14C FdI exists as a 7Fe protein in vivo. This 7Fe form of T14C FdI is extremely similar to native FdI in its spectroscopic, electrochemical, and structural features. However, unlike native FdI which does not undergo facile cluster conversion, the 7Fe form T14C FdI quickly converts to the 8Fe form with a high efficiency under reducing conditions.

However, unlike native FdI which does not undergo facile cluster conversion, the 7Fe form T14C FdI quickly converts to the 8Fe form with a high efficiency under reducing conditions. One of the most interesting and important features of protein-bound [Fe-S] clusters is their ability to convert from one form to another (for reviews see Refs. 1Beinert H. Holm R.H. Münck E.

The simplest of these reactions involves the interconversion of [3Fe-4S]+/0 and [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters. These two cluster types are structurally very closely related and differ only by the presence or absence of a single iron atom at one corner of a cube. The physiological relevance of an iron loss or uptake mechanism is best illustrated by the example of aconitase and related dehydratases. In the best studied system, aconitase, the [3Fe-4S] cluster is inactive, and the spontaneous conversion to the [4Fe-4S] form of the enzyme represents a self-activation of the enzyme (1Beinert H.

For the related iron-responsive element mRNA-binding protein, which is involved in iron homeostasis, the reverse reaction may be the first step on the route to apoprotein production (9Klausner R.D.

ForBacillus subtilis amidotransferase the stability of the enzyme depends on the presence of a [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster, and exposure to dioxygen inactivates the enzyme by destroying its cluster (12Grandoni J.A. Switzer R.L. Makaroff C.A. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6058-6064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed numerous [4Fe-4S]2+/+-containing proteins are extremely sensitive to dioxygen, and the destruction of the cluster often initiates with the formation of a [3Fe-4S] cluster. Most proteins that contain [3Fe-4S]+/0 clusters do not undergo this type of cluster interconversion, and those that do vary in the ease and reversibility of the reaction (1Beinert H. Holm R.H.

In the majority of proteins that are known to undergo facile 3Fe to 4Fe cluster interconversion, including aconitase, the [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster has one noncysteine ligand, and it is the iron atom that is coordinated by that ligand that is labile (13George S.J.

It is interesting in those cases that the aspartate replaces the cysteine at the central position of a [4Fe-4S]2+/+Cys-X-X-Cys-X-X-Cys-binding motif (Fig. 1). If the aspartate is replaced by a cysteine using site-directed mutagenesis, a stable 4Fe cluster results, but it can no longer be easily converted to a 3Fe cluster (22Busch J.L.H. Breton J.L.

Like these mutants, most native protein-bound [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters that have four cysteine ligands can be converted to the [3Fe-4S]+/0state only during destructive reactions en route to apoprotein, and stable 3Fe cluster forms are not available to study the reverse reaction (25Thomson A.J.

The 3Fe region of the protein therefore does not have either a Cys-X-X-Cys-X-X-Cys or a Cys-X-X-Asp-X-X-Cys motif. There is an additional free Cys at position 11 but that Cys is far removed from the cluster and is not used as a ligand. Our interest in converting the 3Fe cluster of AvFdI to a 4Fe cluster by mutagenesis is motivated both by a desire to understand the structural features that control the interconversion reactions and by the suggestion that the 3Fe to 4Fe conversion reaction, which is so difficult to accomplish with nativeAvFdI in vitro, might be physiologically relevant (34Thomson A.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). That suggestion is based in part on the surprising observation that when apo-FdI is reconstituted in vitro with iron and sulfide the product is an 8Fe protein containing two [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters rather than the extremely stable and well characterized 7Fe form of the protein that contains one [3Fe-4S]+/0 and one [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster (32Morgan T.V. Stephens P.J. Burgess B.K. Stout C.D. FEBS Lett. 1984; 167: 137-141Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In a previous study we constructed a Y13C FdI variant that could easily be modeled with a 4Fe cluster in the 3Fe cluster position. That design was unsuccessful, resulting in a 7Fe protein possibly because A. vinelandii covalently modified the cysteine to form a persulfide that could not be used as a ligand (35Kemper M.A. Stout C.D.

That interpretation is consistent with a recent report that the same mutation in a related ferredoxin from Bacillus schlegelii, which was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, appears to contain a 4Fe cluster in the 3Fe position (24Aono S. Bentrop D. Bertini I. Luchinat C. Macinai R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). 2That report did not, however, include direct UV-visible, CD, or EPR evidence to demonstrate the presence of the former cluster type and the absence of the latter. 2That report did not, however, include direct UV-visible, CD, or EPR evidence to demonstrate the presence of the former cluster type and the absence of the latter. In another study we were successful in constructing an 8Fe version of FdI by deleting residues Thr-14 and Asp-15 to create a Cys-X-X-Cys-X-X-Cys motif in the region of the 3Fe cluster (36Kemper M.A. Gao-Sheridan S. Shen B. Duff J.L.C. Tilley G.J. Armstrong F.A. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12829-12837Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, like the four-Cys coordinated clusters discussed above, the conversion of the new 4Fe cluster back to the 3Fe cluster was a destructive reaction, and a pure sample of the 7Fe form of ΔT14/ΔD15 FdI could not be isolated (36Kemper M.A. Gao-Sheridan S. Shen B. Duff J.L.C. Tilley G.J. Armstrong F.A. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12829-12837Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Here we report the construction, characterization, and interconversion of a T14C variant of FdI that can be isolated both in 7Fe and 8Fe forms and the observation that it is the 7Fe form that accumulates in vivo. The oligonucleotide used for the mutagenesis had the sequence 5′-AAGTGCAAGTACTGCGATTGTGTTGAA-3′ which differs from the wild-type sequence by the substitution of TGC (encoding Cys) for ACC (encoding Thr). The oligo-directed mutagenesis, FdI overexpression inA. vinelandii, and cell growth were performed as described previously (37Shen B. Martin L.L. Butt J.N. Armstrong F.A. Stout C.D. Jensen G.M. Stephens P.J. La Mar G.N. Gorst C. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25928-25939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The parent A. vinelandii strain used for the expression of T14C FdI, designated DJ138, is lacking the genes encoding AvFdI and flavodoxin. The constructed T14C FdI variant strain is designated DJ138/pBS3A1. The purification of native FdI and T14C FdI follows a modification of the purification method described previously (38Stephens P.J. Jensen G.M. Devlin F.J. Morgan T.V. Stout C.D. Martı́n A.E. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3200-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). All steps were carried out anaerobically with or without (as specified below) 2 mm Na2S2O4 present in all buffers. A. vinelandii T14C FdI variant was grown under the N2-fixing condition, and cell-free extracts were prepared from about 1 kg of cell paste. The cell-free extracts were loaded onto a 5 × 20-cm DE52 cellulose column equilibrated with 0.025 m Tris·HCl, pH 7.4. A 3-liter linear 0.1–0.5m NaCl gradient was applied, and T14C FdI was eluted completely by a NaCl concentration of 0.45 m. The ferredoxin fraction, while being diluted with 2 volumes of 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was immediately loaded onto a 2.5 × 12 cm DE52 cellulose column equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was then washed with 2 liters of 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.12 m in KCl, at 240 ml/min. T14C FdI was eluted with 0.3 m KCl. Saturated ammonium sulfate in 0.05 m Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, was added very slowly with stirring to the T14C FdI fraction to 75% saturation in ammonium sulfate. The precipitated protein was recovered by centrifugation and dissolved in the minimum volume of 0.025m Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl. The T14C FdI solution was then loaded onto a 2.5 × 100-cm Sephadex G-50 superfine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column equilibrated with 0.025 m Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1m NaCl. The eluted T14C FdI fraction was concentrated using an Amicon ultrafiltration unit with a YM-10 membrane. For spectroscopic studies all protein samples were prepared anaerobically under argon in a Vacuum Atmospheres glove box (O2 <1 ppm) using degassed buffers. Where concentrated protein was required, the samples were concentrated and buffer exchanged using Centricon-10 microconcentrators. The photoreduction reaction was carried out by mixing T14C FdI, 5′-deazariboflavin and EDTA at final concentrations of 100, 200, and 20 μm, respectively, in 0.1 m Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, and then illuminating for 1 min using white light from a slide projector. UV-visible spectra were obtained with a Hewlett-Packard 8452 Diode Array UV-visible spectrophotometer. CD spectra were recorded using a JASCO J720 spectropolarimeter. EPR spectra were obtained using a Bruker 300 Ez spectrometer, interfaced with an Oxford Instruments ESR-9002 liquid helium continuous flow cryostat. Samples for whole cell EPR were prepared as described elsewhere (36Kemper M.A. Gao-Sheridan S. Shen B. Duff J.L.C. Tilley G.J. Armstrong F.A. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12829-12837Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To determine iron content, samples were digested, and the analysis was carried out as described elsewhere (39Burgess B.K. Jacobs D.B. Stiefel E.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 614: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) using FeCl3·6H2O to generate a standard curve with the native FdI as control. A parallel Lowry assay (40Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was carried out to confirm the quantities of proteins used in the iron analysis. The native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is a modification of the Tricine gel electrophoresis method described elsewhere (41Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). All steps were carried out anaerobically. The acrylamide gel mix contains acrylamide and bisacrylamide at a 37.5:1 ratio. Each gel consisted of a 12% separating layer and a 4% stacking layer. To the separating gel solution, freshly prepared 10% ammonium persulfate and TEMED were added to give final concentrations of 165 μm and 1.32 mm, respectively. Polymerization occurred after 5 min of gel casting. To the stacking gel solution, 10% ammonium persulfate and TEMED were added to give final concentrations of 300 μmand 5 mm, respectively. Polymerization occurred within 30 min. The gels were pre-run for 30 min at 70 V with the running buffer containing 2 mmNa2S2O4. After the protein samples were loaded, the gels were run for 2.5 h at 70 V. The cathode buffer was refreshed with fresh running buffer at 30-min intervals to ensure the continuous presence of sodium dithionite in the gel. The completed gels were treated with Coomassie Blue staining. Purified water of resistivity ∼18 MΩ·cm (Millipore) was used in all experiments. The buffers MES, HEPES, and TAPS, and co-adsorbates polymyxin B sulfate and neomycin sulfate were purchased from Sigma. Other reagents were purchased from Aldrich and were of at least analytical grade. An AutoLab electrochemical analyzer (Eco Chemie, Utrecht, The Netherlands) was used to record DC cyclic voltammograms (in the digital mode) and square-wave voltammetry. The three-electrode configuration featuring all-glass cells (typically holding 600 μl and either a single pot or multipot for pH dependence and metal-uptake experiments) has been described previously (42Armstrong F.A. Butt J.N. Sucheta A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 227: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The sample compartment was maintained at 0 °C. All potential values are given with reference to the standard hydrogen electrode. The saturated calomel reference electrode was held at 22 °C, which we have adopted asE(saturated calomel reference electrode) = +243 mVversus standard hydrogen electrode. Reduction potentials from cyclic voltammograms were calculated as the average of the anodic and cathodic peak potentials, E 0′ = 1/2(E pa + E pc). The pyrolytic graphite “edge” (PGE) electrode (surface area typically 0.18 cm2) was polished prior to each experiment with an aqueous alumina slurry (Buehler Micropolish: 0.3 μm for solution electrochemistry or 1.0 μm for protein film voltammetry) and then sonicated extensively to remove traces of Al2O3. All experiments and handling were carried out under anaerobic conditions in a glove box (Belle Technology, Poole, UK) with an inert atmosphere of N2(O2 <1.0 ppm). Cell solutions used for protein film voltammetry comprised a 60 mm mixed buffer system (15 mm each in HEPES, acetate, TAPS, MES, 0.1 m NaCl) except for experiments at pH 8.5–10.0 in which the buffer also included 7.5 or 15 mmCHES, respectively. Solutions also contained 0.1 mm EGTA and 200 μg/ml polymyxin, with 0.1 m NaCl as principal supporting electrolyte. The pH was adjusted with either HCl or NaOH and was measured at 0 °C before and immediately after experiments. Voltammograms were scanned first in a pot containing a cell solution at pH 7.0 in order to establish a film, following which the coated electrode was transferred to other pots containing solutions at a different pH values or containing Fe(II), Zn(II), or Tl(I). Solutions of metal ions Fe(II) ((NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O), Zn(II) (ZnSO4·6H2O), and Tl(I) (Tl(O2 CCH3)·6H2O) were made up in 20 mm HEPES, 0.1 m NaCl, and 200 μg/ml polymyxin solution at pH 7.0. For film experiments, the solutions used to coat the electrodes were as follows. For the 7Fe form, a 300 μm protein solution was prepared using 45 μl of the mixed buffer cell solution at pH 7.0, mixed with 10 μl of a stock solution of 1.6 mm protein in 25 mm Tris·HCl at pH 7.4. For films of the 8Fe ferredoxin, the solution contained 120 μm protein in 0.1m Tris·HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 200 μg/ml polymyxin, with 2.5 mm sodium dithionite, and 1 mm Fe(II) at pH 7.4. Films were produced by painting a freshly polished electrode surface with about 1 μl of chilled protein solution using a Pasteur pipette drawn to a fine capillary tip, following which the electrode was placed promptly into the cell solution. For bulk solution voltammetry of the 7Fe form, the solution contained 160 μm protein, 25 mm Tris·HCl, and 0.1m NaCl at pH 7.4. For the 8Fe form, the solution contained 120 μm protein, in 0.1 m Tris·HCl and 0.1m NaCl with 1 mm Fe(II), and 2.5 mmsodium dithionite, at pH 7.4. Small aliquots of neomycin stock solution were added (final concentration 4.0 mm) to promote a strong and persistent electrochemical response. This solution was used for both cyclic and square-wave voltammetry. Crystals of oxidized T14C FdI in the 7Fe form were grown by seeding using small native FdI crystals as described previously (48Shen B. Jollie D.R. Stout C.D. Diller T.C. Armstrong F.A. Gorst C.M. La Mar G.N. Stephens P.J. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8564-8575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A large, single crystal, 0.5 × 0.7 × 0.9 mm in size, was mounted in a thin-walled glass capillary using a synthetic mother liquor of 4.8 m(NH4)2SO4, 0.45 mTris·HCl, pH 8.1. Data were collected at room temperature using CuKα radiation from a RU200 x-ray generator operated at 40 kV, 80 mA, and equipped with a graphite monochromator and Xentronics X-1000 area detector mounted on a Siemens P4 goniostat. Data were collected with a single phi scan of 180° with 0.25° oscillations and 6-min exposures per frame. The crystal did not exhibit significant deterioration in the 3 days required for data collection. The data were indexed, integrated, reduced, merged, and scaled using the Xengen suite of programs (TableI) (49Howard A.J. Nielsen C. Xuong N.-H.

Karplus M. Petsko G.A. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1989; 45: 50-61Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Starting coordinates of native FdI (31Stout C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) were modified to contain a Gly at both residues 11 and 14, and all H2O molecules were omitted from the model. This model was refined as a rigid body using data in the resolution range 8.0 to 4.0 Å and then by positional refinement using data to 4.0-, 3.5-, 3.0-, 2.7-, and 2.5-Å resolution. The resulting phases, unbiased for the side chains of residues 11 and 14, were used to calculate ‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ and 2‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖. Fourier maps with all data in the resolution range 20.0 to 2.5 Å. The difference Fourier map revealed large positive 5ς peaks at the positions of Sγ of Cys-11 and C-γ2 of Thr-14 of native FdI, providing an internal check on the correctness of the phases and revealing the position of the Sγ atom in the mutated Cys-14 side chain. The 2.5-Å resolution 2‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ map was consistent with Cys-11 and Cys-14 side chains and was used to model the Cys-14 side chain and remodel the Cys-11 side chain. Density fitting and model building were carried out with the Xtalview suite of programs (51McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graphics. 1992; 10: 44-47Crossref Google Scholar). The electron density and difference electron density did not indicate any significant changes in the [3Fe-4S] cluster or other portions of the structure. The structure was refined by Powell minimization and isotropic B factor refinement at 2.3 Å and then 2.1 Å resolution using Xplor version 3.8 (50Brünger A.T. Karplus M. Petsko G.A. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1989; 45: 50-61Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Side chains of three residues in contact with Thr-14 in native FdI, Asp-15, Lys-84, and Lys-85, were adjusted slightly to fit the 2‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ electron density. Difference Fourier maps were used to locate peaks >3ς for H2O molecules; 48 H2O molecules refined withB factors <50.0 A2 were retained in the model. Statistics for the final refined structure are given in Table I. There are no non-glycine outliers in the Ramachandran plot. Coordinates for oxidized 7Fe T14C FdI have been deposited with the Protein Data Band code 1A6L. In an attempt to convert the [3Fe-4S] cluster into a [4Fe-4S] cluster in the crystal lattice, as observed in solution, two additional data sets were collected.

The native enzyme can be photolabeled at 5 μm TNP-8N3-[α-32P]ADP, and ATP or FITC treatment prevents labeling of the α chain.

Photoinactivation and labeling are prevented by TNP-ADP, vanadate, or strophanthidin and are promoted by Na+ or Mg2+, but not K+.

FEBS Lett. 1987; 225: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or higher oligomers; however, solubilized αβ protomers hydrolyze ATP and catalyze many of the partial reactions associated with the pumping cycle (5Brotherus J.R.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β subunit is required for correct membrane insertion (8McDonough A.A. Geering K. Farley R.A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1598-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and may play a role in K+transport and in stabilizing the α subunit (9Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H.

The Sodium Pump: Structure, Mechanism, Hormonal Control and its Role in Disease. Steinkopf-Verlag, Darmstadt, Germany1994: 445-448Crossref Google Scholar). In the presence of K+, the activity of Na,K-ATPase exhibits a complex non-Michaelian dependence on ATP concentration (11Neufeld A.H. Levy H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6493-6497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement for steady-state phosphorylation is satisfied at micromolar ATP, and yet the rates of hydrolysis and cation transport increase 20–50-fold if ATP is raised to millimolar levels (12Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); this clearly requires more than one encounter between ATP and the enzyme during the reaction cycle. Thus far, it had seemed economical to attribute the apparent multiplicity of ATP binding sites to the structure, probably oligomeric, of the membrane-bound enzyme. This hypothesis entails cooperativity between αβ protomers, with each α subunit having an unique and structurally identical (but conformationally different) ATP binding site. It has also been proposed that an enzyme with a single site, which would alternate between high and low-affinity conformations, could account for the complex behavior with respect to ATP (13Moczydlowski E.G. Fortes P.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2357-2366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This seemed a plausible alternative when the C12E8 (octaethylene glycol dodecyl monoether)-solubilized protomers were shown to present dual responses to ATP in the absence of oligomerization (6Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5332-5336Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our current work supports yet a third possibility: that each αβ protomer presents separate high and low affinity ATP sites. We found that when FITC-modified Na,K-ATPase was solubilized with C12E8, the soluble protomers retained their K+-phosphatase activity but did not recover their ability to hydrolyze ATP (14Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12317-12321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); it follows that FITC must effectively block the high affinity ATP site of every αβ protomer and not just one half of an (αβ)2 membrane dimer. The K+-phosphatase activity of these protomers could be inhibited by TNP-ADP (14Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14277-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); it could also be inhibited by the azido derivative TNP-8N3-ADP. Upon UV irradiation, TNP-8N3-ADP inactivated both pNPPase activity and Pi phosphorylation in a process that was accelerated by Na+ or Mg2+ and inhibited by TNP-ADP or K+. TNP-8N3-ADP also photoinactivated the FITC-modified, solubilized αβ protomers (16Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14277-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The simultaneous covalent binding of FITC and TNP nucleotide to the same soluble protomer suggested that high and low affinity ATP binding occurred at two distinct sites on the protomeric enzyme unit. Previously, we had used indirect methods to demonstrate TNP-nucleotide binding to the fluorescein enzyme (14Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12317-12321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14277-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the use of TNP-8N3-[α-32P]ADP, first as an affinity label for the high-affinity (catalytic) ATP site; we go on to show directly that the FITC-modified α subunit can covalently bind TNP-8N3-[α-32P]ADP. It seems likely, therefore, that the site of primary TNP-8N3-[α-32P]ADP attachment to the FITC-modified Na,K-ATPase is within a regulatory nucleotide pocket distinct from the catalytic ATP binding site. Na,K-ATPase was purified from pig outer renal medulla with the zonal rotor method of Jørgensen (17Jørgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 356: 36-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). The Na,K-ATPase activity ranged from 20 to 35 units/mg of protein at 37 °C. Na,K-ATPase activity was measured using a coupled enzyme spectrophotometric assay at 37 °C, as described previously (16Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14277-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The pNPPase activity was determined from the linear time courses ofp-nitrophenol release at 20 °C (14Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12317-12321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Assay conditions were as follows: 20 mm KCl, 20 mmTris-Cl− (pH 7.5), 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm pNPP. Membrane-bound purified Na,K-ATPase was suspended at 1 mg of protein/ml in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 9.2), and 5 mm EDTA. FITC was prepared as a 10 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to give a final concentration of 50 μm. The suspension was incubated at 20 °C for 30 min in the dark; the membranes were spun down and washed in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge, and the pellet was homogenized in 20 mmTris-Cl− (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA. A control enzyme sample was processed side by side, with the omission of FITC. In all cases, the FITC-treated enzyme retained less than 1% of the Na,K-ATPase activity of the parallel control. Two different approaches were used to obtain 8N3-[α-32P]ADP. 1) 8N3-[α-32P]ATP was purchased and hydrolyzed to 8N3-[α-32P]ADP with Na,K-ATPase. Analytical high performance liquid chromatography on a strong anion exchange column confirmed that hydrolysis was complete. 2) 8N3-[α-32P]ADP was synthesized from [α-32P]ATP (18Czarnecki J. Geahlen R. Haley B. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This was converted to 8Br-[α-32P]ATP by mixing 3 μmol of [α-32P]ATP (9 MBq) dissolved in 250 μl of 1m sodium acetate/acetic acid buffer (pH 3.8) with 250 μl of bromine water (5 μl of Br2/ml). The reaction was essentially complete after 4 h at room temperature. The 8Br-[α-32P]ATP was purified on a DEAE-Sephadex column (1.6 × 20 cm) using a gradient of 0–1 mtriethylammonium formate (pH 5.3). The 8Br-[α-32P]ATP peak was collected, lyophilized, co-evaporated four times with methanol, and then dissolved in 10 ml of dimethylformamide containing 10 mmol of triethylamine azide, prepared according to Haley (19Haley B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 46: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was heated to 75 °C for 10 h. The dimethylformamide was evaporated to a syrup, and the 8N3-[α-32P]ATP purified by a repeat of the DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. The final stage was to convert the 8N3-[α-32P]ATP to 8N3-[α-32P]ADP, using Na,K-ATPase. TNP group addition to 8N3-[α-32P]ADP was according to the method of Seebregts and McIntosh (20Seebregts C.J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2043-2052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), modified as described previously (16Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14277-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The product was purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, Hichrom). A linear gradient (0–100% B) was delivered over 60 min (A = 50 mm triethylammonium formate, pH 6.0; B = methanol), and the peak containing TNP-8N3-[α-32P]ADP was collected, lyophilized, dissolved in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and stored at −80 °C. The yield was approximately 50%. The product had the correct UV/visible absorption spectrum (20Seebregts C.J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2043-2052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and migrated as a single peak when reapplied to the C18 column. The enzyme was suspended in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), with extra additions as specified in the legends to figures, and pipetted into multiwell dishes to a depth of 2–3 mm. The dishes were placed inside a chamber at room temperature and constant humidity and irradiated with a Flowgen VL-6MC UV lamp set at 312 nm, as described (16Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14277-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of unboiled Na,K-ATPase samples (21Cortas N. Elstein D. Markowitz D. Edelman I.S. Biochim. Biophys.

The samples were run on 3% T stacking and 10% T separating slab gels in a Hoefer minigel apparatus at a constant voltage (150 V). All gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and destained with 7% acetic acid, 45% methanol. For autoradiography, the gels were dried, and the x-ray film was exposed with an intensifying screen for 8–72 h at −80 °C. Bands were cut from Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels and eluted at 10 mA per tube for 6–8 h at room temperature, using a Bio-Rad model 422 electroeluter according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration and radioactivity were determined in aliquots of the nondialyzable eluate against appropriate standards, and the number of nmol of TNP-8N3-[α-32P]ADP per mg of α chain protein were calculated. FITC-modified Na,K-ATPase was photolabeled with TNP-8N3-[α-32P]ADP, spun down, and washed in the benchtop ultracentrifuge. The labeled enzyme was resuspended in a medium containing 20 mmTris-Cl− (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA and incubated with l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (2 μg per 90 μg Na,K-ATPase) at 37 °C. The trypsin action was stopped in aliquots, at various times, with a 2.5-fold mass excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor. Samples were drawn and mixed with sample buffer (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar) for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein was precipitated with 7% trichloroacetic acid and quantitated with the bicinchonninic acid method (23Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

All enzyme activities were calculated from the regression coefficients of least-squares linear regressions on product release time-courses. Error bars in Figs. 3 and5 represent the S.E. on multiple determinations, compounded where appropriate. The photoinactivation time-courses did not conform to simple (single or double) exponential decays (16Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14277-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); single exponential functions with a nonzero infinity value could be fitted by nonlinear regression using SigmaPlot 4.0.Figure 5The stoichiometry of fluorescein enzyme photolabeling. Top panel, time courses in Na+ medium. Aliquots of FITC-treated enzyme were photolabeled for periods of up to 30 min in the presence of 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl−, 1 mm EDTA, and 25 μmTNP-8N3-[α-32P]ADP. The enzyme samples were spun down and washed; protein and pNPPase activity were determined (n = 3), and duplicate SDS-PAGE gels were run, with identical loads per channel (10 μg).

[α-32P]ATP was from NEN Life Science Products, and 8N3-[α-32P]ATP was from ICN. Dimethyl sulfoxide, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid, and trifluoroacetic acid were from Aldrich. Blue-Sensitive x-ray film was from Genetic Research Instrumentation. Trypsin (l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated) was from Worthington. All other reagents were of the highest purity available. In order to evaluate the specificity of TNP-8N3-[α-32P]ADP toward ATP sites in Na,K-ATPase, we performed initial experiments with thenative enzyme. We had recently shown that TNP-8N3-ADP photoinactivated the Na,K-ATPase activity of the native sodium pump and that that the enzyme could be protected by excess TNP-ADP. In those experiments, at 5 μmTNP-8N3-ADP, about 30% of the Na,K-ATPase activity remained after 25 min of UV irradiation (16Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14277-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The results in Fig.1 show that when used with the same inactivation protocol, TNP-8N3-[α-32P]ADP is incorporated in the α subunit of the native enzyme. Under these conditions, 100 mm Na+ (Fig. 1, lane 1) or 10 mm Mg2+ (lanes 6 and7) has little or no effect on the labeling obtained with just 20 mm Tris-Cl− (lane 2), whereas 100 mm K+ (lane 3) causes a somewhat lower level of incorporation. The K+ effect is indeed expected as it decreases the nucleotide binding affinity at the catalytic site (24Hegyvary C. Post R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5234-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Nørby J.G. Jensen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 233: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The photolabeling can be prevented by including 2 mm ATP (lane 4) or 0.1 mm TNP-ADP (lane 5) in the medium. Likewise, covalent modification of the enzyme with FITC (lane 8) impedes access of TNP-8N3-[α-32P]ADP at this concentration of the probe (5 μm). Considering that ATP protects the α chain and that FITC blocks a high-affinity ATP site (16Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14277-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26Karlish S.J.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1980; 12: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), it is apparent that the trinitrophenyl group, which increases binding affinity (15Moczydlowski E.G. Fortes P.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2346-2356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), does not have much effect on binding specificity (cf. Refs. 14Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12317-12321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar and 16Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14277-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is most likely, therefore, that the TNP-8N3[α-32P]ADP labeling in Fig. 1 occurs from within the catalytic ATP site of native Na,K-ATPase. The FITC-modified sodium pump cannot catalyze E1 partial reactions or the overall (i.e. Na,K-ATPase) reaction. However, E2 functions, such as K+-phosphatase and phosphorylation by inorganic phosphate, are more or less unaffected (14Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12317-12321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9592-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The E2 partial reactions can still be reversibly inhibited by ATP analogues, such as TNP-ADP, acting with low affinity on the membrane-bound fluorescein enzyme (28Davis R.L. Robinson J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 953: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 29Scheiner-Bobis G. Antonipillai J. Farley R.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9592-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and, crucially, on the soluble αβ protomers prepared from it (14Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12317-12321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The surviving pNPPase activity and [32P]Pi phosphorylation of the FITC enzyme can be photoinactivated using TNP-8N3-ADP at concentrations higher than those required to inactivate the Na,K-ATPase activity of the native enzyme (16Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14277-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and this lends support to the idea of a distinct low-affinity nucleotide site on the αβ protomer. It had been suggested (28Davis R.L. Robinson J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 953: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that the selective survival of E2 functions could be due to a rotation of the fluorescein molecule about its tether, so that access to the active site was possible in theE2 (K+) but not in the E1 (Na+) conformer. In our former study, we found that the TNP-8N3-ADP photoinactivation of the fluorescein enzyme was accelerated by Na+ or Mg2+, and that K+ counteracted their effect. We argued that these effects were exactly the opposite as predicted for TNP-8N3-[α-32P]ADP access to the blocked site and that this made the hypothesis of fluorescein rotation very unlikely (16Ward D.G. Cavieres J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14277-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These cation effects are now expanded in the experiments shown in Fig. 2 (this and subsequent figures refer to the FITC-treated enzyme). Note that the photoinactivation of the pNPPase activity of the FITC-modified sodium pump is conducted at a TNP-8N3-ADP concentration five times higher than that used in the experiments with the native enzyme (Fig. 1). The ordinate is intended to approximate the format of the inactivation rate constant, which would have been calculated had the time courses been simple exponentials. The MgCl2 and NaCl effects occur with low affinities, and MgCl2 promotes a greater maximal inactivation (63%versus 54%). The MgCl2 effect correlates reasonably well with the calculated level of TNP-8N3-ADP·Mg complex (Fig. 2 B, dotted curve). The hyperbolic dependence on the Na+concentration (Fig. 2 A) might mean that a single Na+ site is involved, and the high apparentK 0.5 (97 mm) suggests an “extracellular” effect (30Garrahan P.J. Glynn I.M. J. Physiol. 1967; 192: 159-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 31Garay R.P. Garrahan P.J. J.

This is reminiscent of the allosteric external Na+ site (32Cavieres J.D. Ellory J.C. Nature. 1975; 255: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We wished to find out what other Na,K-ATPase ligands could affect the inactivation rate of the fluorescein enzyme and be used to evaluate the specificity of TNP-8N3-ADP binding. Fig.3 shows the results obtained with vanadate and strophanthidin. The latter was used (35Hoffman J.F. Am. J. Med. 1966; 41: 666-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), instead of ouabain, because facile glycoside release was needed after TNP-8N3-ADP photoinactivation and before assaying thepNPPase activity. Likewise, to aid vanadate release, four washes were given in 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl− (pH 7.5) (36Beaugé L.A. Cavieres J.D. Glynn I.M. Grantham J.J. J. Physiol. 1980; 301: 7-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) before final resuspension in 20 mm Tris-Cl− (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA. From Fig. 3, it is clear that when strophanthidin or vanadate binds to FITC-modified Na,K-ATPase, the TNP-8N3-ADP photoinactivation process is slowed down considerably. The effects of cations and inhibitors on the photolabeling of the fluorescein enzyme with TNP-8N3-[α-32P]ADP were put to the test in the experiments shown in Fig.4. As expected for the higher probe concentration, the label is distributed more widely than observed in the autoradiogram of the native enzyme (Fig. 1), as there is substantial radioactivity associated with the gel front (presumably on lipids and proteolipids) and some in relation to material that fails to penetrate the separating gel. Nevertheless, when it comes to the sodium pump subunits, it is clear that the label goes overwhelmingly to the α chain. Fig. 4, left panel, shows the cation effects. The highest labeling was obtained in the presence of 10 mmMg2+ (lanes 2 and 3), followed by 150 mm Na+ (lane 1), which corresponds to the ranking order for inactivation of the fluorescein enzyme at the same concentration of nonradioactive TNP-8N3-ADP (Fig. 2,A and B). Potassium ions promote a low level of photolabeling (Fig. 4, lane 5) with respect to the buffer control (lane 6) and strongly counteract the effect of Mg ions (lanes 2 and 4). Fig. 4, right panel, shows that the TNP-8N3-[α-32P]ADP photolabeling promoted by 10 mm Mg2+ (lane 1) can be competed by 1 mm TNP-ADP (lane 2) and that it must, therefore, be preceded by reversible probe binding. Lanes 3 and 4 show that vanadate or strophanthidin treatment is effective at reducing the photolabeling of the fluorescein enzyme α subunit, just as it is at preventing photoinactivation of its K+-phosphatase activity (Fig. 3). The slight labeling of the β subunit persists in the fluorescein enzyme treated with vanadate or strophanthidin (Fig. 4, compare lanes 3 and4 to lane 1), and this probably means that it is nonspecific. This is probably also true of the residual α chain labeling in lanes 3 and 4. Taken together with those in Fig. 3, these experiments demonstrate that two pump inhibitors, which bind from opposite sides of the membrane plane, interfere with the low-affinity incorporation of TNP-8N3-ADP in the FITC-modified enzyme. Evidently, this second nucleotide binding locus on the α subunit is sensitive to conformational changes promoted by essential cations or key inhibitors. The stoichiometry of TNP-8N3-[α-32P]ADP photolabeling of the fluorescein enzyme was measured in the experiments shown in Fig. 5. The top panelshows the time course of inactivation of the K+-phosphatase activity of FITC-modified sodium pump caused by 25 μmTNP-8N3-[α-32P]ADP in the presence of 100 mm NaCl; also shown is the mass of radioactive probe incorporated"
https://openalex.org/W2161273194,"Among the polar interactions occurring in pancreatic lipase/colipase binding, only one ion pair involving lysine 400 on lipase and glutamic acid 45 on colipase has been described. These residues are strictly conserved among species, suggesting that the ion pair is likely to play an important role. Therefore, in order to prevent this interaction, mutations intended to neutralize or inverse the charge of these residues have been introduced in the cDNAs encoding horse lipase and colipase. The recombinant proteins have been expressed in insect cells, and their catalytic properties have been investigated. In all cases, preventing the formation of the correct ion pair Lys400/Glu45 leads to lipase-colipase complexes of reduced affinity unable to perform an efficient catalysis, notably in the presence of bile salt micelles. Diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate inhibition experiments with either mutant lipase or mutant colipase indicate a poor stabilization of the lipase flap. These results suggest that the ion pair plays a critical role in the active conformation of the lipase-colipase-micelle ternary complex by contributing to a correct orientation of colipase relative to lipase resulting in a proper opening of the flap.

The enzyme has been shown to exhibit two conformations, an inactive closed conformation in solution, in which a special loop (the flap) masks the active site, and an active open conformation resulting from the motion of the flap and the exposure of the active site to the substrate interface (7van Tilbeurgh H.

This conformation change has been thought to account for the “interfacial activation” of pancreatic lipase. However, recently, it was shown that detergent micelles together with colipase are able to induce the opening of the flap (or stabilize the open lipase conformation) in the absence of any substrate interface (8Hermoso J. Pignol D. Kerfelec B. Crenon I. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18007-18016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This finding was further supported by the observation of a ternary complex associating pancreatic lipase in its open flap state, colipase, and a well characterized detergent micelle (9Hermoso J. Pignol D. Penel S. Roth M. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5531-5536Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The micellar binding site is distinct from the interfacial binding site of the lipase-colipase complex, thus shedding new light on lipase activation under physiological conditions. In solution, in the absence of detergent micelles, colipase exclusively binds to the C-terminal domain of lipase. The binding involves the formation of an ion pair between a glutamic acid residue (Glu45) of colipase and a lysine residue (Lys400) of lipase, these residues being strictly conserved among species. In the presence of micelles, a secondary colipase-binding site involving the lipase flap is generated 25 Å apart from the C-terminal domain binding site. This extra binding site, smaller than the first one, only involves polar interactions and van der Waals contacts. To understand better the pathway of pancreatic lipase activationin vivo, we have investigated the importance of the sole ion pair existing between lipase and colipase. In this respect, we have mutated lysine 400 to glutamic acid or glutamine in lipase and glutamic acid 45 to lysine or glutamine in colipase, and we looked at the impact of these mutations on the lipase/colipase binding and catalytic efficiency of the resulting lipase-colipase complexes either in the absence or in the presence of bile salt micelles. The results clearly indicate that the ion pair Lys400/Glu45 plays a key role in controlling the activity of lipase in the presence of bile salt micelles. The BaculoGold starter package, baculovirus pVL1393 transfer vector, was from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). The culture media X-Press were from Bioproducts (France). Fetal calf serum and antibiotics were purchased from Dutscher (France) and Life Technologies, Inc. (Copenhagen, Denmark). Alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Sigma. The TransformerTM Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit was from CLONTECH. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs (UK). Both proteins were obtained from a horse pancreatic acetonic powder. Horse lipase and colipase were purified according to the methods of Lombardoet al. (10Lombardo D. Chapus C. Bourne Y. Cambillau C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 259-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and Chapus et al. (11Chapus C. Desnuelle P. Foglizzo E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 115: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), respectively. The protein concentrations were determined at 280 nm usingE 1% = 13.3 for lipase and 8.0 for colipase. Mutations were introduced into the pVL1393HoPL and pVL1393HCol plasmids using the Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. After selection by NdeI restriction analysis, the presence of the desired mutation was ascertained by sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method (12Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52756) Google Scholar), and the subsequent plasmids were purified by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation. Transfections were performed as described in the Baculovirus Expression Vector System Manual from PharMingen. Recombinant baculoviruses were produced and purified as described previously (6Ayvazian L. Crenon I. Granon S. Chapus C. Kerfelec B. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Five to six days postinfection, the cultures of infected Sf-21 cells were harvested and centrifuged to remove cells and debris. The supernatants were dialyzed overnight against distilled water and freeze-dried. The dry material was then resuspended in distilled water and submitted to molecular sieving on an Ultrogel AcA 54 column (4 × 200 cm) equilibrated in a 50 mmTris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 m NaCl and 1 mm benzamidine. After an overnight dialysis at 4 °C against a 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm NaCl and 1 mm benzamidine, the recombinant lipases were further purified on a Q Fast Flow column. Elution was performed using a linear NaCl gradient (10–200 mm) in the same buffer. The recombinant colipases were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against a 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm benzamidine and loaded onto a HiTrap blue column (5 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Colipase was selectively eluted in the pass through. The protein elution profiles were followed spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, and the presence of lipase or colipase was investigated by activity measurements and/or Western blotting. Electrophoresis on 10–15% polyacrylamide gels was carried out either in the absence or in the presence of SDS as described by Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207487) Google Scholar). Western blots were performed according to Burnette (14Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5926) Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with specific polyclonal anti-lipase or anti-colipase antibodies from rabbit, and immunodetection was carried out using alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. Native horse colipase (1 μg) or mutant ColE45K or ColE45Q (1–3 μg) was loaded onto a 15% anionic polyacrylamide gel prior to electroblotting on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in the same conditions as mentioned above. The protein blotting/protein overlay assay was performed as described (6Ayvazian L. Crenon I. Granon S. Chapus C. Kerfelec B. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Immunodetection was carried out as mentioned above. Lipase and colipase activities were potentiometrically determined at pH 7.5 and 25 °C using 0.11m emulsified triacylbutyrylglycerol (tributyrin) in 1 mm Tris/HCl buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 in the presence of various NaTDC 1The abbreviations used are: NaTDC, sodium taurodeoxycholate; E600, diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate; CMC, critical micellar concentration. concentrations. One unit corresponds to the release of 1.0 μmol of fatty acid per min. The inhibition experiments were performed at pH 6.0 with 4 mm E600 in the presence of supramicellar concentrations of NaTDC as reported by Hermoso et al. (8Hermoso J. Pignol D. Kerfelec B. Crenon I.

The mixtures were incubated at 20 °C, and aliquots were withdrawn from the mixture at various time intervals. The remaining lipase activity was measured as mentioned above in the presence of 1 mm NaTDC and an excess of native colipase. Models of the different mutant lipases and colipases were built on the basis of the crystal structure of the porcine lipase-colipase complex (8Hermoso J. Pignol D. Kerfelec B. Crenon I. Chapus C.

Amino acid changes were introduced using the graphic program O (15Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr.

Richards F. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Models were first energy minimized using the Powell minimizer algorithm implemented in X-PLOR (17Brunger A.T. Isaac N.W. Taylor M.R. Crystallographic Computing 4: Techniques and Technologies. Oxford University Press, New York1988: 126-140Google Scholar). The Engh and Huber (18Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2547) Google Scholar) force field was used in all energy minimization and molecular dynamic simulations. Subsequently, the slow-cooling molecular dynamic protocol of Brunger et al. (19Brunger A.T. Krukowski A. Erickson J.W. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1990; 46: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) was applied by using the weak temperature coupling method of Berendsen et al. (20Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P. van Gunstern W.F. DiNola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (23900) Google Scholar). The target temperature of 1000 K was decreased by 25 K every 100 steps to reach the final temperature of 300 K. The time step was set to 0.05 fs during the molecular dynamic stages. Finally, the conformation of the different mutants trapped at 300 K was subjected to 500 additional steps of energy minimization. The mutant lipases, LipK400E and LipK400Q, were purified to homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The presence of both mutations was confirmed from the electrophoretic behavior of the mutant lipases on polyacrylamide gel in the absence of SDS (Fig.1). The two mutant lipases were shown to retain at least 80% of the activity of the native or recombinant lipase on emulsified tributyrin in the presence of a non-inhibitory NaTDC concentration (0.1 mm) (Fig. 2). As native lipase, LipK400E and LipK400Q were inhibited by increasing amounts of NaTDC in the absence of colipase. However, in contrast to the native enzyme, they were not fully reactivated by native colipase (Fig.2). To investigate this effect in more detail, we looked at the impact of the mutations on both the apparent affinity between the mutant lipases and native colipase and the catalytic efficiency of the mutant lipase-colipase complexes. Therefore, the rate of hydrolysis of 0.11m emulsified tributyrin (V S) against native colipase concentration was determined at different NaTDC concentrations (Table I). The selected tributyrin concentration was close to the substrate saturating concentration; thus the experimental value of V Sapproached the value of the limiting rate V =k cat[E o]. For each bile salt concentration, the experimental points (V S versus colipase concentration) were fitted to rectangular hyperbolic curves corresponding to a 1:1 stoichiometry between lipase and colipase. The values of K d(app)(lipase/colipase apparent dissociation constant in the presence of a water/lipid interface) and the limiting values of V S(corresponding to 100% lipase complexed with colipase) were determined from the curves and reported in Table I.Table IInfluence of NaTDC concentration on the lipolytic activity of the lipase mutants in the presence of native colipaseNaTDCLipK400QLipK400EKd(app)VSKd(app)VSmmnmunits/mgnmunits/mg0.1ND9413 ± 460ND8090 ± 3200.51.21 ± 0.148663 ± 2593.1 ± 0.57580 ± 27912.04 ± 0.296634 ± 1596.5 ± 0.395990 ± 2301.510.7 ± 0.62183 ± 23034.5 ± 5.21848 ± 53214 ± 1.8960 ± 4324.2 ± 3.26397 ± 3349.82 ± 2.8375 ± 2139.7 ± 6.8116 ± 15The rate of hydrolysis (V S) was measured using a saturating concentration of emulsified tributyrin.

For NaTDC concentrations below the CMC (<1 mm), a moderate effect of NaTDC was observed on the LipK400Q activity on emulsified tributyrin, whereas above this concentration a noticeable change occurred on both the apparent affinity of the mutant lipase for colipase and the catalytic efficiency. However, althoughK d(app), after a sharp increase, reached a plateau value, V S kept on decreasing, when increasing NaTDC concentration. A similar behavior with a somewhat sharper effect onK d(app) was observed with the LipK400E mutant, as expected from the greater negative charge repulsion induced by the mutation. The plots V S versus NaTDC concentration (Fig. 2) show that colipase fails to efficiently reverse the inhibitory effect of bile salts for the two mutant lipases, mainly in the presence of micelles. The recombinant wild type horse lipase, as well as native horse lipase, was fully reactivated by native colipase, thus ensuring that the sensitivity of LipK400E and LipK400Q to supramicellar concentrations of NaTDC in the presence of colipase has to be only correlated to the introduced mutations. The finding of linear plots with a negative slope of −1 when plotting either log V S or logV S/K d(app) versus log [NaTDC micelles] (Fig.3) indicates that there is no micelle cooperativity. The simplest schema fitting the experimental results corresponds to Scheme FS1, whereM represents the concentration of NaTDC micelles;E represents free lipase; C represents free colipase; ECS represents the lipase-colipase complex linked to the substrate; ECM and ECMS represent the lipase-colipase-micelle complex free or linked to the substrate,k p represents the specific rate constant of product formation; and K d, K mic, andK′mic represent the dissociation constants of the ECS, ECM, and ECMS complexes, respectively. In Scheme FS1, ECMS is considered as a nonproductive complex. The mutant lipase-native colipase complexes, although able to bind to the water/lipid interface in the presence of bile salt micelles, can no longer perform an efficient catalysis suggesting a behavior toward NaTDC similar to that of native lipase alone.Figure 3Plots of log V S ,log V S / K d(app), and logK d(app) versuslog [M]. Both V S andV S/K d(app) vary with the NaTDC micelle concentration ([M]) according to the following equations: K d(app) =V/(1 + [M]/K′mic) andV S/K d(app) =V/K d (1 + [M]/K mic) derived from the schema presented under “Results.” A, LipK400Q; B,LipK400E.

Reproducing the experiments with horse colipase (devoid of the VPDPR N-terminal pentapeptide) led to similar results, except for slightly higher plateau values of V S in the presence of bile salt micelles (data not shown). Purification of the recombinant wild type or mutant colipase was achieved as reported under “Experimental Procedures.” Recombinant wild type (data not shown) and colipase mutants possess the expected molecular mass and the expected charge as estimated from their electrophoretic behavior on polyacrylamide gel in the absence of SDS (Fig. 4). The lipase binding property of both mutants was first investigated by the protein blotting/protein overlay technique (Fig.5). A faint band was revealed by anti-lipase antibodies for ColE45Q, whereas no binding could be detected with ColE45K suggesting a lower affinity of these mutant colipases for lipase. Thus, the ability of colipase mutants to reactivate native lipase was kinetically investigated using a saturating concentration of emulsified tributyrin as mentioned above. The values of K d(app) andV S were determined for various NaTDC concentrations (Table II). The two mutants are poorly efficient in counteracting the inhibitory effect of bile salts, notably in the presence of micelles. The E45K mutation led to a particularly severe change in the properties of colipase which became very ineffective in restoring lipase activity even at low NaTDC concentration since at 0.75 mm NaTDC, only 25% of the lipase activity could be recovered. TheK d(app) value was moderately affected for NaTDC concentrations below 1 mm but dramatically increased for NaTDC concentrations above 1 mm. The kinetic analysis of the data could not be performed due to the difficulty in obtaining accurate measurements at high NaTDC concentration.Table IIInfluence of NaTDC concentration on the lipolytic activity of native lipase in the presence of colipase mutantsNaTDCColE45QColE45KK d(app)V SK d(app)V Smmnm%nm%0.75ND89.6 ± 3.83.85 ± 0.3927.8 ± 3.213.3 ± 0.482.3 ± 5.110.1 ± 3.811.2 ± 1.71.515.6 ± 1.360.2 ± 3.4248 ± 742.6 ± 0.5244.7 ± 3.850.6 ± 4.3NDND462.5 ± 27.723.5 ± 2.1NDNDThe rate of hydrolysis (V S) was measured using a saturating concentration of emulsified tributyrin.

The E45Q mutation resulted in a less drastic effect, ColE45Q being able to partly counteract the inhibitory effect of NaTDC for somewhat higher bile salt concentrations. In order to see if the E45K mutation on colipase could compensate the K400E mutation on lipase, we investigated the capability of ColE45K to restore the activity of LipK400E in the presence of various NaTDC concentrations. As shown in TableIII, even at low NaTDC concentrations, a sharp increase of K d(app) is observed in the LipK400E·ColE45K complex as compared with the native lipase-colipase complex, indicative of a lower apparent affinity between lipase and colipase in the former complex. As well, analysis of the V S values indicates that ColE45K failed to correctly abolish the inhibitory effect of NaTDC on LipK400E activity. Moreover, as compared with the LipK400E-native colipase or native lipase-ColE45K complexes, there was no significant increase in the apparent affinity in the LipK400E·ColE45K complex. Therefore there is no compensatory effect of the mutations in the LipK400E·ColE45K complex.Table IIIInfluence of NaTDC concentration on the lipolytic activity of LipK400E in the presence of ColE45KNaTDCKd(app)VSmmnmunits/mg0.7590 ± 153070 ± 2801128 ± 451879 ± 1281.560 ± 7.8185 ± 34The rate of hydrolysis (V S) was measured using a saturating concentration of emulsified tributyrin.

E600 inhibition experiments were performed on both native and K400E lipase using either native or E45K colipase in the presence of NaTDC micelles. In all cases a complete inhibition of the native or recombinant lipase was observed. Blank experiments performed in the absence of colipase clearly indicated that lipase activity was not affected by E600 and remained stable for at least 72 h incubation. Thus, the observed inhibition is indicative of the unmasking of the lipase active site. As previously observed with the native partners (8Hermoso J. Pignol D. Kerfelec B. Crenon I. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18007-18016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), at high bile salt micelle concentration the E600 rate of inhibition is increased (TableIV). However, it must be pointed out that the time required to achieve 50% lipase inhibition was considerably longer with the mutant proteins.Table IVNative lipase and LipK400E inhibition by E600t 50% (h)NaTDC, 1.5 mmNaTDC, 4 mmNative lipase, native colipase3.1 ± 0.2<0.15Native lipase, ColE45K16 ± 24 ± 0.3LipK400E, native colipase35 ± 54.2 ± 0.4LipK400E, ColE45KND5.5 ± 0.3Native horse lipase or LipK400E (8 μm) was incubated at pH 6.0 at room temperature with 4 mm E600 in the presence of NaTDC and either 15 μm native colipase or 16 μm ColE45K.

ND, not determined. No inhibition was observed in the absence of colipase. Finally, as already observed in the kinetic studies, no compensatory effect could be detected when E600 experiments were performed in the presence of both LipK400E and ColE400K. In order to better understand the functional properties of the mutants, structural models of the various mutant lipases and colipases were built on the basis of the crystal structure of the porcine lipase-colipase complex (8Hermoso J. Pignol D. Kerfelec B. Crenon I. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18007-18016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Careful investigation of the models shows that in the case of ColE45K, the mutant displaying the more drastic effects, the location of the Lys45 side chain of the mutant colipase is likely to decrease the stability of the resulting native lipase-mutant colipase complex since this residue faces two lysine side chains of lipase (Lys398 and Lys400), which is energetically unfavorable (Fig.6 A). In the LipK400E-native colipase complex, a repulsive effect, although less severe, can also occur between the two negatively charged side chains, Glu400 and Glu45. However, it must be pointed out that in LipK400E, an intramolecular ion pair is likely to be formed between Glu400 and Lys398 (Fig.6 B) thus stabilizing the negative charge of the mutation. In the presence of amphiphilic compounds, lipolysis occurs through lipase/colipase interactions. Although our basic knowledge on pancreatic lipase/colipase has advanced in the last decade, many of the molecular events occurring at the amphiphile-coated water/lipid interface remain obscure. To obtain more information on the lipase/colipase mechanism of action, we decided to look at the role of the sole ion pair linking lipase to colipase. As expected, impeding the formation of the Lys400/Glu45 ion pair between lipase and colipase affects the apparent affinity between the mutant protein and its native partner. It must be emphasized that this effect depends upon the form of presentation of the bile salt. When NaTDC is spread at the water/lipid interface (below the CMC), the apparent affinity is only moderately decreased. By contrast, above the CMC, when bile salt micelles are formed in the bulk, the apparent affinity is further reduced. For all the mutants, the charge inversion results in a more severe damage than the charge neutralization, particularly for the colipase mutants. Based on modeling experiments, a likely explanation for this finding is that the E45K mutation in colipase gives rise to an electrostatic repulsion between native lipase and the mutant colipase, the Lys45 side chain of colipase facing two lysyl side chains of lipase in the resulting complex. In the LipK400E model, an intramolecular ion pair can occur between Glu400 and Lys398 thus stabilizing the introduced negative charge. The most striking result concerns the effect of the mutations on the catalytic efficiency of the various lipase-colipase complexes (mutant lipase-native colipase or native lipase-mutant colipase). Impeding the formation of the ion pair between lipase and colipase results in a loss of activity against emulsified substrates depending on the bile salt concentration. Increasing the bile salt micelle concentration leads to quite inactive complexes. Two hypotheses could be proposed to explain this phenomenom as follows: (i) a cooperative effect of bile salts micelles resulting in the binding of more than one micelle to the lipase-colipase complex, or (ii) an uncorrect conformation of the lipase-colipase mutant complex worsened by the presence of the micelle. From the analysis of the kinetic results the first hypothesis can be discarded. Thus, although not directly involved in micelle binding, the ion pair Lys400/Glu45 is likely to control the correct orientation of colipase relative to lipase in the ternary complex resulting in a proper opening of the flap. This hypothesis is further supported by experiments of lipase inhibition by E600 in the presence of NaTDC micelles and ColE45K. These experiments, performed in the absence of any water/lipid interface, are representative of the combined effect of bile salt micelles and colipase on the opening of the lipase flap. As compared with native colipase, a very slow inhibition is observed indicative of a poorly active conformation of lipase likely due to a poor stabilization of the lipase flap by the mutant colipase. Preventing the interaction between colipase and the flap of lipase led to the same observation (22Lowe M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It must be emphasized that, in the absence of micelles, the more the bile salts accumulate on the water/lipid interface, the less colipase is able to restore the lipase activity, although the apparent affinity of the lipase-colipase mutant complex remains moderately affected. This finding suggests that impairing the formation of the ion pair could also result in an uncorrect positioning of colipase toward the water/lipid interface and further supports the possible role of colipase in the rearrangement of the amphiphilic compounds coating the water/lipid interface during catalysis, as postulated by Momsenet al. (23Momsen W.E. Momsen M.M. Brockman H.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7271-7281Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Attempts to compensate the K400E mutation on lipase by the E45K mutation on colipase failed. From modeling investigation on mutant lipase, it is proposed that Glu400 is involved in an intramolecular ion pair with Lys398 rather than in an intermolecular ion pair with Lys45 of colipase, thus impeding a proper orientation of the two partners in the complex. Another explanation could be that the lipase/colipase binding is (partly) driven by polar forces and that inverting the charges, notably in colipase, results in an uncorrect association. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that the sole ion pair linking lipase to colipase plays an essential role in the formation of the active conformation of the lipase-colipase complex at the water/lipid interface in the physiological conditions. This ion pair is likely to maintain a correct orientation of colipase relative to lipase, particularly in the presence of bile salt micelles. Moreover, the finding that mutant colipase is unable to correctly abolish the inhibitory effect of bile salts spread at the water/lipid interface in the absence of micelles suggests that colipase might play a complex function during catalysis. Besides its involvement in anchoring lipase at the substrate interface, stabilization of the open lipase conformation, and micelle bind-ing, colipase might participate in the rearrangement of the amphiphilic compounds coating the water/lipid interface. We are greatly indebted to Drs. A. Cornish-Bowden and M. L. Cardenas for helpful discussions concerning the kinetic results. We also acknowledge E. Foglizzo for skillful assistance."

The study of the acceptor specificity indicated that the Mb α-galactosyltransferase prefers Galβ1–3-R as acceptor, and among such glycans, the relative substrate activityV max/K m was equal to 20 μl·mg−1·h−1 for Galβl-3GlcNAcβ1-O-octyl and to 330 μl·mg−1·h−1 for Galβ1–3GalNAcα-1-O-benzyl, showing clearly that Galβ1–3GalNAc disaccharide was the more suitable acceptor substrate for Mb α-galactosyltransferase activity. Nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry data allowed us to establish that the Mb α-galactosyltransferase synthesizes one unique product, Galα1–4Galβ1–3GalNAcα1-O-benzyl. The Galβ1–3GalNAc disaccharide is usually present onO-glycosylation sites of numerous asialoglycoproteins and at the nonreducing end of some glycolipids. We observed that Mb α1,4-galactosyltransferase catalyzed the transfer of galactose onto both natural acceptors. Finally, we demonstrated that the trisaccharide Galα1–4Galβ1–3GalNAcα1-O-benzyl was able to inhibit anti-PK monoclonal antibody-mediated hemagglutination of human blood group PK1 and PK2 erythrocytes.

In fact, it is now well established that protein-bound carbohydrate side chains play important roles on the physicochemical properties and functions of glycoproteins such as antigenicity, immunogenicity, and metabolic clearance (5Klenk H.-D. van Regenmortel M.H.V.

Only a few studies have shown complex N-linked glycans in insect cells. Recent data suggest that the insect cell lines Estigmena acrea andTrichoplusia ni clone Tn-5-B14 (Tn) can add some terminal galactose residues to the recombinant human interferon γ and to the heavy chain of a heterologous murin IgG (25Ogonah W.O.

Only one group has reported that recombinant human plasminogen carries complex type N-glycans with terminal sialic acid residues when expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda clone Sf-21 (Sf-21) or Mamestra brassicae clone SPCMb-92-C6 (Mb) (27Davidson D.J.

As mainly observed on recombinant glycoproteins expressed by the baculovirus/insect cell system, endogenous N-glycan structures found in insect cell glycoproteins have no complex type glycans (16Williams P.J.

Activity measurements of several glycosyltransferases involved in the addition of terminal sugars to N-linked oligosaccharides have demonstrated that lepidopteran cells contain α1,6-fucosyltransferase (36Staudacher E. Kubelka V. März L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 987-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and a low level of β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (37Altmann F. Kornfeld G. Dalik T.

Chem. 1993; 268: 17902-17907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but lack β1,4-galactosyltransferase and sialyltransferase activities. Compared with the information available on the structure and biosynthesis of lepidopteran N-glycans, our knowledge about the synthesis of O-linked oligosaccharides remains rather poor. A comparison of O-glycans on recombinant pseudorabies virus envelope protein gp50 expressed in S. frugiperda clone Sf-9 (Sf-9), Vero and Chinese hamster ovary cells has shown that the protein synthesized by both mammalian cell lines contained exclusively the core 1 disaccharide Galβ1–3GalNAc (T-antigen) mainly substituted by one or two sialic acid residues. On the other hand, most of the O-glycosylation sites of insect-produced protein were only substituted by GalNAc residues, forming Tn-antigen. The Sf-9 cell line also synthesized Galβ1–3GalNAc but in very low amounts, and none of theseO-glycans are substituted by sialic acid residues (39Thomsen D.R. Post L.E. Elhammer A.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 43: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A characterization of the O-linked oligosaccharidic structures on a chimeric respiratory syncytial virus protein as well as on a human interleukin-2 with artificially introduced O-glycosylation sites, expressed in Sf-9 and Sf-21 cells, respectively, yielded similar results; only GalNAc and Galβ1–3GalNAc were found (15Wathen M.W. Aeed P.A. Elhammer A.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2863-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Grabenhorst E. Hofer B. Nimtz M. Jäger V. Conradt H.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Measurement of the two relevantO-glycosyltransferase activities performed in Sf-9, Vero, and Chinese hamster ovary cells has revealed that, even if the three cell lines expressed a comparable level of polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity, there were high variations in core 1 β1,3-Gal-T activity, with Sf-9 cells containing the lowest level (39Thomsen D.R. Post L.E. Elhammer A.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 43: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In summary, the determination of the glycosylation potential of lepidopteran cells achieved through the measurement of the different glycosyltransferase activities, as well as through the identification of the N- and O-glycan structures present on endogenous insect cell glycoproteins or on recombinant glycoproteins expressed by the baculovirus/insect cell system, showed that the glycosylation potential of insect cell lines is deficient in comparison with mammalian cells. Since N- and O-glycan structures found on the insect recombinant glycoproteins are often different from those occurring in the corresponding natural glycoproteins, the aberrant glycosylation pattern can limit the development of the therapeutic glycoprotein production in lepidopteran cells using the baculovirus expression system. Indeed, these changes in glycosylation can cause a decrease of the half-life of the recombinant glycoproteins after blood injection (8Thotakura N.R. Blithe D.L. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 40Wright A. Morrison S.L. J. Exp.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2856-2860PubMed Google Scholar) but also against glycan epitopes normally absent in humans. It is clear that some oligosaccharide epitopes present on glycoproteins or glycolipids expressed at the cell surface of most mammalian species cause a rapid rejection after exposure to human blood. The major element responsible for such human rejection has been identified as a unique carbohydrate structure, the α-galactosyl epitope Galα1–3Gal (44Galili U. Shohet S.B. Kobrin E. Stults C.L.M.

Cell. 1996; 86: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Indeed, as much as 1% of the circulating human IgG were found to interact with Galα1–3Gal epitopes, both on glycoproteins (46Castronovo V. Foidart J.M. Li Vecchi M. Foidart J.B. Bracke M. Mareel M. Mahieu P. Invasion Metastasis. 1987; 7: 325-345PubMed Google Scholar, 47Towbin H. Rosenfelder G. Wieslander J. Avila J.L. Rojas M. Szarfman A. Esser K. Nowack H. Timpl R. J. Exp.

Because the α-galactosyl epitope is strongly antigenic in humans, it was particularly interesting to look for such carbohydrate epitopes on endogenous insect cell glycoproteins, since the glycosylation patterns of the expressed glycoproteins are determined to a large extent by the host cell glycosylation machinery. For that purpose, after electrophoresis and Western blotting of noninfected insect cell homogenates, we have tested the affinity of the insect glycoproteins for an αGal-specific lectin, B. simplicifolia lectin-I isolectin B4 (BSI-B4), which strongly recognizes Galα1–3/4Gal sequences (51Hayes C.E.

Lacto-N-tetraose (Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc) and lacto-N-neotetraose (Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc) were prepared from bovine colostrum (54Paulson J.C. Prieels J.P. Glasgow L.R. Hill R.L. J. Biol.

Galβl-3GalNAc, Galβl-3GalNAcβ1-O-bn, Galβl-3(2-O-Ac)Galβ1-O-methyl, Galβl-3GlcNAcβ1-O-octyl, and Galβl-4GlcNAcβ1-O-bn were generous gifts of Dr. C. Augé (URA CNRS 462, Orsay, France). Asialofetuin was prepared by mild acid hydrolysis of fetuin. The sugar composition of desialylated compounds was controlled by gas chromatography after methanolysis and trimethylsililation. Dowex 1 × 2 (Cl− form, 100–200 mesh), Bio-Gel P-2 (200–400 mesh), and P-4 (200–400 mesh) were purchased from Bio-Rad (Ivry-sor-Seine, France). The Sep-Pak C18 cartridge was purchased from Waters Corp. (Milford, MA). Nitrocellulose membrane BioTrace NT was from Gelman Sciences. Murine monoclonal antibodies anti-P1, anti-Pk, and anti-P and red blood cells from individuals typed in the P/P1 blood group system were from the Institut National de la Transfusion Sanguine (Paris, France). The S. frugiperda clone Sf-9 of IPLB-Sf-21-AE cells (55Vaughn J.L. Goodwin R.H. Tompkins G.J. McCawley P. In Vitro. 1977; 13: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) was obtained from ATCC (CRL 1711), and theT. ni clone Tn-5-B14 was provided by A. Bernard (Glaxo Institute). The M. brassicae clone SPCMb-92-C6 was established by J. M. Quiot at the Station de Pathologie Comparée INRA/CNRS URA 2209. 2J. M. Quiot, unpublished data. The three cell lines were adapted, maintained, and cultivated at 28 °C in EX-CELL 401™ (Sera-Lab, Blackthorn, United Kingdom), a semidefined medium for the serum-free culture of lepidopteran insect cells. Cells were harvested at confluence, and cell homogenates were prepared by lysing the cells at 0 °C with 10 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm MnCl2(1 ml/3 × 107 cells). After a 10-min incubation under continuous stirring, cell homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were used for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentration was determined according to the method described by Peterson (56Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7132) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed under reducing conditions on 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel (57Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) using 40 μg of protein/lane for each cell homogenates. After migration, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane as described by Vaessen et al. (58Vaessen R.T. Kreike J. Groot G.S.P. FEBS Lett. 1981; 124: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The blot was then separated in two parts and treated with polyvinylpyrolidone (2% in Tris-buffered saline (Tris/HCl 10 mm, NaCl 0.15 m, pH 7.4)) prior the incubation with the peroxidase-labeled BSI-B4 (2 μg·ml−1 in Tris-buffered saline containing 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2) with or without 0.5 mGalα1-O-methyl used as a competitor. After washing, labeled glycoproteins were revealed according to the Sigma Fast Staining protocol using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and urea/H2O2. 2 × 108 Mb cells cultured in EX-CELL 401™ were lysed by ultrasonication (5-s pulsed at 0 °C in 10 ml 0.25 m sucrose, 0.2m NaCl solution). Microsome suspensions were prepared by centrifugation as described previously (59Tetaert D. Soudan B. Lo-Guidice J.-M. Richet C. Degand P. Boussard G. Mariller C. Spik G. J. Chromatogr. 1994; 658: 31-38Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C in NaCl/sucrose solution until use. Assays were performed at least in duplicate. The incorporation of [6-3H]Gal was determined by subtraction of the radioactivity measured in the absence of exogenous acceptors, and results were expressed as average values as nmol of Gal residues transferred/mg of protein/h. Microsomal fractions (35 μg of protein) were brought to a final volume of 50 μl with 0.125 m Mes, pH 7.0, 0.15% Triton X-100, 5 mm γ-galactonolactone, 10 mm ATP, 12.5 mm MnCl2, 1 mmUDP-[6-3H]Gal (235 MBq·mmol−1; 11.75 kBq/50 μl), containing 4 mm of oligosaccharide or aryl glycoside, 1 mm of ganglioside, or 2 mg·ml−1of glycoprotein acceptor and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Reaction products were separated from UDP-[3H]Gal depending on the acceptor substrate. For oligosaccharide acceptors, assay mixtures were diluted to 0.5 ml with H2O to stop the reaction, and the amount of incorporated [3H]Gal was determined by ion exchange chromatography on a 1-ml Dowex 1 × 2 column (Cl− form, 100–200 mesh) equilibrated in water. The radioactivity of the corresponding products was detected by scintillation counting (60Vandamme V. Cazlaris H. Le Marer N. Laudet V. Lagrou C. Verbert A. Delannoy P.

Precipitates were collected on glass fiber filters, washed extensively with 5% trichloroacetic acid, distilled water, and ethanol, and processed for scintillation counting (60Vandamme V. Cazlaris H. Le Marer N. Laudet V. Lagrou C. Verbert A. Delannoy P. Biochimie. 1992; 74: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For aryl glycosides and glycolipids, the reactions were stopped by adding 1 volume of ethanol. Samples were centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 5 min, and supernatants were applied to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge. After washing with 5 ml of water, aryl glycosides were eluted with 5 ml of 30% acetonitrile in water and glycolipids with 2 ml of CH3OH, followed by a 5-ml elution with CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1, v/v) and processed for scintillation counting. The rates of all reactions were linear with time, at least for 1 h. For kinetic analysis, incubations were performed for 1 h using various concentrations (0.125–4 mm) of Galβl-3GalNAcα1-O-bn and Galβl-3GlcNAcβ1-O-octyl. Mb microsomal fractions (850 μg of protein) were brought to a final volume of 600 μl in conditions described above with 4 mm UDP-[6-3H]Gal (62 MBq·mmol−1; 0.148 MBq/600 μl), 4 mm of Galβl-3GalNAcα1-O-bn and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The incubation mixture was applied to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge, eluted as described previously, and lyophilized. Aliquots of the incubation mixture (5 μl) were collected after 0, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h and assayed for radioactivity (data not shown). The yield of transfer after 24 h of incubation was 66% (∼970 μg of galactosylated product). The purified product was further analyzed by NMR and mass spectrometry (MS). For the immunoreactivity study, we produced 4 mg of that compound with 90% of purity. That large scale preparation was performed as described above, in a final volume of 1.85 ml (1.4 mg of Mb microsomal proteins) and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. 1H-NMR spectroscopy was performed on a Brüker ASX 400WB spectrometer. Chemical shifts are expressed in ppm downfield from internal sodium 4,4′-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate but were actually measured by reference to internal acetone (δ = 2.225 ppm in D2O at 25 °C). The two-dimensional homonuclear correlation spectroscopy (COSY), with simple and double relay transfer, and the heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence spectroscopy (HMQC) spectroscopy experiments were performed using Brüker standard pulse-sequences. 100 μg of the galactosylated product were permethylated according to Ciucanu and Kerek (61Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3203) Google Scholar) prior to MALD-MS analysis. The methylated compound was then methanolyzed, and the formed methylglycosides were analyzed by GC-MS after peracetylation as described by Fournet et al. (62Fournet B. Strecker G. Leroy Y. Montreuil J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Molecular weight of the permethylated galactosylated product was measured by MALD-MS on a Vision 2000 time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a 337-nm UV laser. The mass spectra were acquired in reflectron mode under 6-kV acceleration voltage and positive detection. The sample was prepared by mixing directly onto the target 1 μl of the analyte solution (typically 50 pmol) and 1 μl of a 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix solution (12 mg·ml−1 in CH3OH/H2O, 70:30) and then allowed to crystallize at room temperature. External calibration was performed using an angiotensin I standard (M r = 1296.7). 10 shots were accumulated for the mass spectrum. GC separation of partially methylated and acetylated methylmonosaccharides from galactosylated product was performed on a fused silica capillary column from SGE (0.32 mm x 25 m) using helium as carrier gas at pressure of 0.5 bar with the following temperature program (110–240 °C at 3 °C/min). The GC-MS analyzer (Delsi DI 700 gas chromatograph) was coupled with a Nermag R10–10 mass spectrometer (Rueil Malmaison, France) using an electron energy of 70 eV and an ionizing current of 0.2 mA. Asialofetuin (1.25 mg, 5 mg·ml−1final concentration) was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C under the conditions described above with Mb microsomal fraction (210 μg of protein) and 0.5 mm of UDP-[6-3H]Gal (0.57 GBq·mmol−1; 74 kBq·μl−1). The sample was made free of UDP-[6-3H]Gal by desalting on Bio-Gel P2 column (200–400 mesh) equilibrated in 0.1 m pyridine acetate, pH 5.6. Further, 3H-labeled asialofetuin sample was submitted to alkaline treatment under reducing conditions in 0.1m NaOH containing 1 m NaBH4 for 48 h at 45 °C (63Spiro R.G. Bhoyroo V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5704-5717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation time, the sample was acidified at pH 6 by addition of Dowex 50 × 8 (H+ form, 20–50 mesh) and evaporated. The sample was then resuspended in methanol and evaporated three times, dissolved in water, and applied to a Bio-Gel P4 column (80 × 1.2 cm, 200–400 mesh) equilibrated in 0.1 m pyridine acetate pH 5.6, to separate released O-glycans from N-glycopeptides. Monoclonal antibodies anti-P1, anti-Pk, anti-P, and BSI-B4 were previously tested by agglutination assays using 0.7% (by volume) suspensions of papain-treated P1, Pk1, Pk2, and p (Tja−) human red cells, for 7 min at 37 °C, in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 150 mm NaCl. This agglutinant system titration allowed to control the specificity of reagents and to determine the correct concentration needed for each antibody or lectin, in order to perform the inhibition assays with both aryl glycosides Galβ1–3GalNAcα1-O-bn and Galα1–4Galβ1–3GalNAcα1-O-bn. Then the monoclonal antibodies and the BSI-B4 at the appropriate dilution were incubated for 4 h at 22 °C in a final volume of 20 μl with a serial dilution of Galβ1–3GalNAcα1-O-bn or Galα1–4Galβ1–3GalNAcα1-O-bn. The mixtures were further tested as described above by agglutination assays against 20 μl of papain-treated P1, Pk1, or Pk2 erythrocytes. 40 μg of cellular glycoproteins from Sf-9, Mb, or Tn cultured in EX-CELL 401™ medium were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and revealed with peroxidase-labeled BSI-B4. As indicated in Fig.1, the three lepidopteran cell lines expressed glycoproteins recognized by BSI-B4. The specificity of the binding of the lectin was shown by the total absence of staining observed when BSI-B4 was incubated in the presence of 0.5 m Galα1-O-methyl used as a competitor. The pattern of expression of revealed bands was dependent on the cell line, showing that the higher staining intensity was obtained with Mb glycoproteins. In Mb, a 100–110-kDa band was strongly revealed by BSI-B4 compared with Sf-9 or Tn in which the staining was of a lower intensity. In Sf-9, BSI-B4revealed a large 95–105-kDa band with two other weak signals at 85 and 190 kDa. Tn glycoprotein staining was observed between 95 and 120 kDa w"

In this paper, the three-dimensional solution structure of synthetic PEAP209–237 was investigated by NMR. These studies indicate that this peptide, which is unstructured in water, folds into an α-helical structure in trifluoroethanol/water (1/1). NMR data revealed two possible three-dimensional models of PEAP209–237. In both models, the proline residue Pro-227 induces a 90° hinge between two α-helical segments (Ser-215 to Ser-221 and Glu-228 to Arg-232) leading to an overallL-shaped structure for the molecule. The negative charge of PEAP209–237 and the low amphipathy of the two α-helical segments imply new mechanisms to explain the antibacterial activity of enkelytin.

This precursor to the opioid pentapeptides is highly conserved from invertebrates (leech, mytilus) (5Salzet M. Stefano G.B.

Seeburg P.H. Adelman J. Eiden L. Herbert E. Nature. 1982; 295: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Because relatively large amounts of enkephalins and enkephalin-containing peptides were present in adrenal medullary chromaffin granules, these organelles have been shown to represent an excellent model to study the intragranular processing of PEA (for review, see Ref. 8Dillen L. Miserez B. Claeys M. Aunis D. De Potter W. Neurochem. Int. 1993; 22: 315-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Proteolytic degradation of PEA in adrenal medulla appears to start at the COOH-terminal region with the removal of peptide B, PEAP209–239 (9Liston D. Patey G. Rossier J. Verbanck P. Vanderhaeghen J.J. Science. 1984; 225: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive forms of peptide B can be found in various regions of brain and circulating in plasma (10Lindberg I. White L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). From bovine adrenal medulla, four peptide B variants were isolated corresponding to the addition of one, two, or three phosphate groups to each peptide chain (11D'Souza N.B. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2548-2552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Watkinson A. Young J. Varro A. Dockray G.J. J. Biol.

Among the complex mixture of intragranular matrix components, we have identified enkelytin, an antibacterial peptide corresponding to the bisphosphorylated PEAP209–237, which is included in peptide B (13Goumon Y. Strub J.M. Moniatte M. Nullans G. Poteur L. Hubert P. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 516-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). More recently, a new antibacterial peptide, exhibiting 98% sequence identity with bovine enkelytin, has been identified as derived from leech and mytilus PEA (14Stefano G.B. Salzet B. Fricchione G.L. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 243-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (98) Google Scholar). 2M. Salzet, B. Salzet, A. Tamieski, M. Verger-Bocquet, Y. Goumon, D. Aunis, M.-H. Metz-Boutigue, M.

Enkelytin is active at a concentration around the micromolar range against several Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, but it is unable to inhibit the Gram-negative bacteria growth (13Goumon Y. Strub J.M. Moniatte M. Nullans G. Poteur L. Hubert P. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 516-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Goumon Y. Lugardon K. Kieffer B. Lefèvre J.F. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29847-29856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, enkelytin has been detected in bovine wound fluid and in bovine chromaffin and human polymorphonuclear cells secretions upon stimulation (16Goumon Y. Lugardon K. Kieffer B. Lefèvre J.F. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29847-29856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In invertebrates, we have established that besides lipopolysaccharide, surgical trauma and electrical stimulation induce the production of enkelytin-like peptide.2 In a recent study we have related the antibacterial activity of enkelytin with structural features (16Goumon Y. Lugardon K. Kieffer B. Lefèvre J.F. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29847-29856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Using various synthetic peptides, we were able to conclude that the antibacterial activity of enkelytin results from three structural parameters: (i) the length of the peptidic chain, (ii) the endogenous conformations of the three proline residues Pro-212, Pro-214, and Pro-227, and (iii) the phosphorylation of the two serine residues Ser-221 and Ser-223. In order to characterize the molecular mechanism by which enkelytin inhibits bacteria growth, it is important to determine the three-dimensional structure of this antibacterial peptide. In this paper we report the three-dimensional structure of the synthetic nonphosphorylated PEAP209–237 in aqueous trifluoroethanol solution, which is the first requirement for the structural analysis of enkelytin. We focused on the conformational changes induced in the active molecule by the phosphorylation of the two serine residues, Ser-221 and Ser-223. This study leads to the characterization of the COOH-terminal domain of PEA whose biological significance in neuroimmunomodulation is revealed by its intact presence in organisms 500 million years divergent in evolution (14Stefano G.B. Salzet B. Fricchione G.L. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 243-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (98) Google Scholar).2 PEAP209–237 was synthesized in our laboratory on an Applied Biosystems 432A peptide synthesizer, SYNERGY, using the stepwise solid-phase synthetic approach (17Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2154Crossref Scopus (6751) Google Scholar) with 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc chemistry). Peptide was further purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a preparative Macherey-Nagel column, Nucleosil RP 300–7C18 (10 × 250 mm). For acquisition of NMR spectra, 2.3 mg of PEAP209–237 was dissolved in 700 μl of aqueous 20 mm sodium acetate-d 6 buffer, pH 5.0, 50 mm NaCl with addition of deuterated trifluoroethanol (trifluoroethanol-d 3) to yield 50% v/v solution. The final peptide concentration corresponds to 1 mm. During all NMR experiments, the temperature was set to 283 K (10 °C). The 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate was used as internal chemical shift reference (0.00 ppm). Spin systems identification experiments, COSY (18Aue W.P. Bartholdi E. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1976; 64: 2229-2246Crossref Scopus (3100) Google Scholar) and HOHAHA (19Braunschweiller L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Google Scholar), were carried out at 500 MHz (1H frequency) on a Bruker AMX 500 spectrometer. A 60-ms DIPSI2 (20Shaka A.J. Lee C.J. Pines A. J. Magn. Reson. 1988; 77: 274-293Google Scholar) isotropic mixing pulse sequence with a B1 field strength of 9.4 kHz was used in the HOHAHA experiment. The spectral width was 6024 Hz in both dimensions, 512 t1 increments were recorded for the F1 dimension, and water signal suppression was achieved by presaturating the water frequency with a low power 2.5-s pulse. A SCUBA COSY (21Brown S.C. Weber P.L. Mueller L. J. Magn. Reson. 1987; 77: 166-169Google Scholar) pulse sequence was used to measure3 J NH-Hα coupling constants in order to restore the intensity of Hα, which were close to the water frequency. 4096 points/ free induction decay were recorded for this experiment leading to a 1.5 Hz/point resolution. NOE buildup were explored by recording several NOESY spectra at 500 MHz with mixing times ranging from 100 to 500 ms. A NOESY (22Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4845) Google Scholar, 23Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar) spectrum was recorded on a 600-MHz DRX 600 spectrometer with mixing times of 500 ms. Processing was performed on IBM RS/6000 computer using the program FELIX V2.10 (Biosym Inc.) and on SGI INDY R5000 computer using UXNMR software (Bruker). Data were zero-filled and processed by apodization with a 90°-shifted sine squared bell window in both dimensions before Fourier transformation. The residual water signal was removed by convolution of the time domain signal with a cosine (24Marion D. Ikura M. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 84: 425-430Google Scholar). The final size of matrices was 2048 × 1024 points for all spectra except the COSY for which a size of 4096 × 1024 points was used. 3 J NH-Hα coupling constants were fitted from one-dimensional slices corresponding to the NH-Hα correlations extracted from the COSY spectrum. A set of distance restraints was obtained by classifying NOE intensities on the 600-MHz 500-ms NOESY map as strong, medium, and weak, corresponding to interproton distance restraints of 2.7, 3.7, and 5.0 Å, respectively. An additional correction of 1.0 Å was added for methylene and methyl groups. These distances were included in the XPLOR 3.1 (25Brünger A.T. Xplor Software Manual,Version 3.1, Ed. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) force field (topallhdg.pro and parallhdg.pro files) as upper bonds soft-square potential functions. An harmonic potential was used to specify torsion angle restraints where needed (see below). The calculations used the simulated annealing protocol proposed by Nilges et al. (26Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS lett. 1988; 239: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) as implemented in the XPLOR 3.1 program package. Successive rounds of structure calculations were performed in an iterative manner with incorporation of initially ambiguous restraints. An all α starting structure (template) was used in initial rounds of calculations. Latest calculations used a random set of initial structures. Average structures were calculated with the final set of refined structures and further energy minimized. 400 steps of energy minimization was calculated on average structures to ensure correct local geometry. The MOLMOL program (27Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) was used to visualize sets of structures and to calculate and draw the electrosatic surface potential of the final three-dimensional models. The complete proton assignment is presented in Table I and Hα chemical shifts, short and medium range NOE patterns, and3 J NH-Hα coupling constants are summerized in Fig. 1. Only one set of resonances was found for all spin systems of the peptide except for the backbone protons of Leu-213. The structural picture that emerges from the NMR data presented in Fig. 1 corresponds to a conformation with two α-helical segments hinged around Pro-227. The first helical segment extends from residue Ser-215 to Ser-223 and the second one from Glu-228 to Arg-232.Table IProton assignments and 3JNH-Hα coupling constants for the PEAP209–237 peptide in a 50% trifluoroethanol-d3 solution (v/v) pH 5.0 at 10 °C.Amino acid3JNH-Hα(Hz)Chemical shifts (ppm)NHHαHβ1Hβ2Hγ1Hγ2Hδ1Hδ2OtherPhe-2094.223.283.16Hδ7.32Hε7.39Ala-210-6.28.484.241.35Glu-2115.28.314.562.061.942.40Pro-2124.422.241.932.072.023.783.70Leu-213 cis7.88.014.651.591.541.700.92Leu-213 trans7.87.994.671.591.541.700.92Pro-2144.432.231.952.041.973.793.60Ser-2155.38.214.434.063.89Glu-2165.98.634.242.082.042.44Glu-2176.88.484.212.062.002.38Glu-2186.28.254.192.082.012.36Gly-219NDaND, not determined.8.443.96, 3.90Glu-2206.18.314.252.122.052.38Ser-2218.08.244.333.913.87Tyr-2226.08.144.463.073.11Hδ7.12Hε6.80Ser-2234.08.124.283.91Lys-2248.57.934.331.931.531.461.70εCH23.00Glu-2256.78.154.322.041.952.43Val-2265.88.014.102.140.980.95Pro-2274.352.341.892.151.983.763.66Glu-228ND8.154.331.971.892.39Met-2294.08.324.272.252.152.602.58Glu-2305.68.354.102.112.072.472.35Lys-2316.57.984.091.881.551.371.68εCH22.91Arg-2327.47.954.101.681.571.491.353.04NH7.36Tyr-2337.88.194.643.222.92Hδ7.18Hε6.80Gly-234ND8.103.97Gly-235ND8.013.86Phe-2368.27.934.653.193.03Hδ7.28Hε7.35Met-2378.07.744.282.061.922.43a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Two NOE patterns characteristic of the cis- and trans-isomers of the Leu-213-Pro-214 peptide bond are detected. This observation, together with the presence of two sets of resonances obtained for Leu-213, clearly indicates the presence of a slow conformational exchange between the cis- and trans-conformations for Pro-214. In contrast, this exchange is not observed for the first proline residue Pro-212, for which the trans-isomer could be unambiguously characterized. The analysis of the NOE pattern involving the Pro-227 residue is in favor of Val-226-Pro-227 peptide bond being in the cis-conformation. However, due to the peak overlap that affects the Val-226 Hα-Pro-227 Hα cross-peak, one cannot exclude completely a possible trans-conformation for the Val-226-Pro-227 peptide bond. Therefore two three-dimensional models corresponding to both cis- and trans- isomers of Val-226-Pro-227 peptide bond are presented. 169 distance constraints were derived from the analysis of the 500-ms NOESY map. Among them, 91 were (i, i + 1) distances, 41 (i,i + 2), 26 (i, i + 3), and 10 were detected between residues separated by more than 3 amino acids. Additional dihedral angle constraints were used for amino acids where NOE pattern, Hα chemical shifts, and3 J NH-Hα coupling constants indicated the presence of an helical conformation. Simulated annealing calculations were carried out with both cis- and trans- topology for Pro-227, resulting in two possible conformations for PEAP209–237. For cis- and trans-isomers of Pro-227, the 25 conformers with the lowest overall energy were selected. None of these structures had distance violations greater than 0.5 Å and showed no dihedral angle deviations greater than 10° from the target value. Average energies for both sets of selected structures are given in Table II. These results indicate that NMR experimental data define a single set of structures for each isomer and that both sets of structures are compatible with experimental distance constraints. The superimposition of the 25 lowest energy structures for each Pro-227 conformation is shown in Fig.2. In both conformations, the two helical segments (Ser-215-Ser-223, Glu-228-Arg-232) of the peptide are bent with an angle of 90°. This orientation is defined by 8 NOE between residues from both sides of Pro-227. However, the orientation of the second helix (Glu-228-Arg-232) in regard to the first one differs, for the trans- and cis-isomers of Pro-227, by an angle of 120°.Table IIStructural statistics and atomic root mean square deviations for the family of 25 calculated structures of the PEAP209–237 peptide for the cis- and trans- isomers of the-Val-226-Pro-227 peptide bond.Pro-227 cisPro-227 transAverage pairwise r.m.s.

A ribbon diagram of the average structure of the PEAP209–237 is presented in Fig.3 for both isomers of Pro-227. Three and a half-canonical helical turns are found in both models, which is in agreement with CD data predicting that a third of the peptide is folded in helical conformation (data not shown). It is worth noting that all aromatic side chains are located on the same side of the helix. The NH2-terminal part has no regular secondary structure due to the lack of medium range NOE observed in this region. The COOH-terminal part of the peptide, which contains the Met-enkephalin motif, is likely to experience some motional averaging that affects3 J NH-Hα coupling constants and NOE values in a different way. Due to the 1/r 6dependence of the dipolar interaction, the helical conformation indicated by the observation of αn(i + 3) and nn(i + 3) NOE may be overestimated in the model (Fig. 3) and might correspond to only a fraction of all possible conformations. The structural analysis of PEAP209–237 demonstrates that this peptide adopts an α-helical fold in trifluoroethanol/water solution. The folding of peptides in the presence of trifluoroethanol is a behavior that is often found for peptides interacting with membranes and has been widely used to study the three-dimensional structure of these molecules. In relation to antibacterial peptides, trifluoroethanol has been used to study the structure of various antibacterial peptides, including cecropin A (29Holak T.A. Engström A. Kraulis P.J.

Iwashita T. Tachibana K. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8009-8017Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), magainin 2 (31Marion D. Zasloff M. Bax A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and ranalexin (32Vignal E. Chavanieu A. Roch P. Chiche L. Grassy G. Calas B. Aumelas A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Futhermore, comparative study of NMR structures of magainin 2 and ranalexin in the presence of phospholipid micelles confirmed the helical structure previously found in trifluoroethanol/water solution (32Vignal E. Chavanieu A. Roch P. Chiche L. Grassy G. Calas B. Aumelas A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Gesell J. Zasloff M. Opella S.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). NMR data indicate that PEAP209–237 is composed of two helical segments (Ser-215-Ser-223 and Glu-228-Arg-232) separated by the loop Lys-224-Pro-227, the proline residue Pro-227 inducing a 90° bend in the structure. The analysis of PEAP209–237 models indicates that the helical structures are stabilized by various favorable side chain interactions. The motif Glu-220-Lys-224 located at the end of the first helical segment corresponds to an electrostatic (i, i + 4) interaction that has been found to be a major contribution in stabilizing short helices (34Marquese S. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8898-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). A similar interaction is found in the second segment, where a salt bridge between Glu-228 and Arg-232 could stabilize the helical conformation. In addition, Pro-227 located at the NH2-terminal end of the second helix appears to be a good helix initiator as based on the NH2-capping process (35Chu S.S. Velde D.V. Shobe D. Balse P. Doughty M.B. Biopolymers. 1995; 35: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 36Chang D.K. Chien W.J. Cheng S.F. Chen S.T. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 49: 432-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the fractional helical conformation observed in the enkephalin motif from NOE data is probably stabilized by the side chain interactions of the two COOH-terminal aromatic residues Tyr-233 and Phe-236 (37Creamer T.P. Rose G.D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1304-1314Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic character is expected to mediate the antibacterial activity. In enkelytin, hydrophobic residues Phe-209, Phe-236, and Met-237 are located on the NH2- and COOH-terminal ends of the molecule and furthermore the aromatic side chain of Phe-209, Tyr-233, Phe-236, and Met-237 are located on the same helical face. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the residue F1 in the ranalexin peptide is essential for the expression of the antimicrobial activity (32Vignal E. Chavanieu A. Roch P. Chiche L. Grassy G. Calas B. Aumelas A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and studies about brevinins, gaegurins, and temporin (38Simmaco M. Mignogna G. Canofeni S. Miele R. Mangoni M.L. Barra D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 788-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) suggest the importance of this residue to induce peptide insertion. The position of the two helical segments observed for PEAP209–237 peptide correlates well with a previous NMR study performed in our laboratory on the synthetic PEAP224–237 in 70% trifluoroethanol (data not shown). In this shorter peptide, NMR data indicated the presence of a helical conformation for residues Glu-228 to Gly-234. Thus, the comparison of the NMR data obtained for the short (PEAP224–237) and longer (PEAP209–237) COOH-terminal fragments of PEA leads to the conclusion that the folding of the COOH-terminal part of the PEAP224–237 is not affected by the addition of the NH2-terminal sequence. Many studies have focused on the three-dimensional structure of the Met-enkephalin sequence (YGGFM), because of its properties to be able to bind to opioid receptors and induce morphine-like effects (1Hughes J. Smith T.W. Kosterlitz H.W. Fothergill L.A. Morgan B.A. Morris R.H. Nature. 1975; 258: 577-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar). A wide range of conformations has been found for enkephalin peptides in crystal (39Aubry A. Birlirakis N. Sakarellos-Daitsiotis M. Sakarellos C. Marraud M. Biopolymers. 1989; 28: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), in Me2SO solution, or bound to membranes (for review, see Ref. 40Milon A. Miazawa T. Higashijima T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), most of them involving β turn and γ turn conformations, but no helical conformation has yet been described. It has been reported that any sequence addition to the NH2terminus of enkephalin peptides leads to the inhibition of binding to the opiate receptor (41Kilpatrick D.L. Tanigucchi T. Jones B.N. Stern A.S. Shively J.E. Hullihan J. Kimura S. Stein J. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3265-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This inhibition may either be due to a steric hindrance or result from the induction of an helical conformation by the additional NH2-terminal sequence, a phenomenon also suggested by our present results. The PEAP209–237 sequence contains three proline residues, two of these (Pro-214, Pro-227) beeing strictly conserved in currently known PEA sequences (13Goumon Y. Strub J.M. Moniatte M. Nullans G.

Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29847-29856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the energy difference between the cis- and trans-isomers of prolines, a residue that is found with high frequency in membrane transport proteins (42Brandl C.J. Deber C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), is reduced in non-polar solvents (43Polinsky A. Goodman M. Williams K.A. Deber C.M. Biopolymers. 1992; 32: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, cis/trans-isomerism may play a functional role in transmembrane helices (44Williams K.A. Deber C.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8919-8923Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The ambiguous NOE pattern observed for Pro-227, while favoring the cis-conformation, did not allow us to discard the trans-conformation and led us to propose two models for the three-dimensional structure. In PEAP209–237, the isomerization of the Val-226-Pro-227 peptide bond would result in a reorientation of the second helical segment relative to the first one by an angle of 120°. This conformational change, which preserves a spatial proximity between two potentially phosphorylated serine residues (Ser-221, Ser-223), located in the first helical segment, and two glutamic residues, located in the COOH-terminal helical segment (Glu-228, Glu-230), may be involved in triggering the antibacterial activity of the peptide. The electrostatic interactions induced by the spatial proximity between phosphorylated serine and glutamate residues may also be critical in inducing the active conformation. The antibacterial bisphosphorylated PEAP209–237, named enkelytin, shares properties with some others antibacterial peptides: helix-kink-helix (30Zagorski M.G. Norman D.G. Barrow C.J. Iwashita T. Tachibana K. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8009-8017Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 45Terwilliger T.C. Weissman L. Eisenberg D. Biophys. J. 1982; 37: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), hydrophobic residues located at the ends of the molecule. However, the surface potential calculated for this peptide highlights its overall negative charge (Fig.4). This feature is in favor of a different mechanism than the one proposed previously for positively charged compounds like cecropins or defensins, which form large pores in the bacterial membrane by direct peptide-membrane electrostatic interactions (46Christensen B. Fink J. Merrifield R.B. Mauzerall D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5072-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Moreover, the amphipatic character of the two helical segments of PEAP209–237 is very low compared with pore-forming peptides. Thus, the structural features of this COOH-terminal PEAP indicate that enkelytin may express its antibacterial activity by different potential mechanisms: (i) a pore-forming or carpet-like mechanism by interaction of its three basic residues with the negative phospholipids and/or glycolipids on bacterial membrane; (ii) a linkage with potential bacterial membrane receptors, including enzymes, pumps, or transporters; (iii) the binding of di- or trivalent ions necessary for the bacteria growth. The 1H NMR study of the synthetic bisphosphorylated PEAP209–237 and of (Ser → Glu) mutants are currently in progress in our laboratory to address the role of electrostatic interactions involved in the antibacterial activity of enkelytin. We are indebted to G. Nullans (INSERM U-338) for synthesis of peptides, to Dr. Patrice Koehl for his help when using the program FFTJVAL, and to Dr. Jean-Louis Baneres (CNRS Montpellier) for CD spectra analysis."

Given their unique properties, these conjugates may have a clinical application for long term, selective inhibition of thrombin. Coagulation occurs by the activation of proenzymes in a cascade leading to generation of thrombin, which in turn converts fibrinogen to fibrin. Thrombin is also responsible for feedback activation of other coagulation factors (1Ofosu F. Sie P. Modi G. Fernandez F. Buchanan M. Blajchman M. Boneu B. Hirsh J. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and is considered the pivotal enzyme in the coagulation pathway (2Choay J. Petitou M. Lormeau J. Sinay P. Casu B. Gatti G. Biophy. Res. Commun. 1983; 116: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Control of thrombin generation regulates plasma coagulant activity. Heparin cofactor II (HC) 1The abbreviations used are: HC, heparin cofactor II; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; DS, dermatan sulfate; AT, antithrombin; HCH, covalent HC-heparin; HCD, covalent HC-DS; ATH, covalent AT-heparin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TSP, Tris/saline/polyethylene glycol. is an important plasma protein that selectively inhibits thrombin (3Tollefsen D. Petska C. Monafa J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6713-6716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) catalyze HC to markedly accelerate the reaction of HC with thrombin (4Ciaccia A.V. Monroe D.M. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14074-14079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). While dermatan sulfate (DS) has been shown to exclusively facilitate thrombin inhibition by HC (3Tollefsen D. Petska C. Monafa J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6713-6716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), other GAGs, such as heparin and heparan sulfate, can catalyze inactivation of thrombin by either HC or plasma antithrombin (AT) (4Ciaccia A.V.

Fluid phase thrombin is readily inhibited by heparin activated AT; however, clot-bound thrombin is resistant to inactivation by either AT+ heparin or AT + low molecular weight heparin (7Hogg P.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26088-26095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, non-covalent HC·DS has been shown to be superior to AT·heparin for inhibition of thrombin in the presence of fibrin (9Bendayan P. Boccalon H. Dupouy D. Boneu B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). There are a number of limitations associated with clinical use of GAGs, due in part to the undesired effects of GAGs upon dissociation from the thrombin inhibitor. First, with regard to the undesired effects of heparin, anticoagulation with standard or low molecular weight heparins can lead to bleeding (11Koopman M.M. Prandoni P. Piovella F. Ockelford P.A. Brandjes D.P. van der Meer J. Gallus A.S. Simoneau G. Chesterman C.H. Prins M.H. Bossuyt P.M. de Haes H. van den Belt A.G. Sagnard L. d'Azemar P. Büller H.R. N. Engl. J.

J. Med. 1995; 332: 1330-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (2148) Google Scholar). Heparin activity may be reduced due to cell surface and plasma protein binding (14Young E. Prins M. Levine M.N. Hirsh J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1992; 67: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Application of heparin in other spaces, such as the lung for treatment of fibrin deposition during neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (15Markarian M. Githens J.H. Fernandez F. Jackson J.J.

Neonat. 1971; 71: 84-97Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), is hampered by the rapid loss of the GAG intravascularly (17Jaques L.B. Mahadoo J. Kavanagh L.W. Lancet. 1976; 7996: 1157-1161Abstract Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Long term heparin use can result in osteoporosis (18Dahlman T. Lindvall N. Hellgren M. Br. J. Obstet.

While DS has decreased cell surface binding (20Dawes J. Pepper D.S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1992; 67: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and causes reduced endothelial intracellular PAI-1 levels (21Marsh N.A. Minter A.J. Chesterman C.N. Blood Coag. Fibrinol. 1990; 1: 133-138PubMed Google Scholar), compared with heparin derivatives, hemorrhagic effects (22Mattiasson S.E. Lindblad B. Stjernquist U. Bergqvist D. Haemostasis. 1995; 25: 203-211PubMed Google Scholar) and loss of activity from plasma protein binding (23Zammit A. Dawes J. Blood. 1995; 85: 720-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are still significant. Both GAGs (heparin and DS) have short intravenous half-lives (24Estes J.W. Pelikan E.W. Kruger-Thiemer E. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1969; 10: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Huang Y. Washio Y. Hara M. Toyoda H. Koshiishi I. Toida T. Imanari T. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and, by acting as a large negative surface, can assist in activation of factor XI (26Gailani D. Broze G.J. Blood Coag. Fibrinol. 1993; 4: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that covalent linkage of HC to either DS or heparin may reduce the problems involved in therapeutic use of GAGs. HC-GAG conjugates would always be in an active form. Since covalent HC-GAG complexes would be large and would not dissociate, clearance due to glomerular filtration or protein-mediated uptake by organs might be reduced, resulting in longer intravenous half-lives. Similarly, since part of the GAG in the covalent complex would be covered by HC, hemorrhagic effects, heparin induced thrombocytopenia, and osteoporosis may be decreased due to steric hindrance. Conjugates of HC and heparin (HCH) may, in addition to direct inactivation of thrombin, also catalyze thrombin inhibition by plasma AT. Covalent HC-DS (HCD) should selectively inhibit thrombin and may give better long term inhibition of clot-bound thrombin compared with non-covalent HC + DS mixtures. Recently, we have prepared covalent complexes of AT and heparin (ATH) (27Chan A. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell L. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). ATH was made without modification of either inhibitor protein or GAG, and gave a product with high anticoagulant activities and long half-life in vivo. We decided to use the same techniques employed for ATH synthesis in order to prepare HCH and HCD covalent complexes. Both HC-GAG conjugates were produced, and their properties and intravenous clearance investigated. All chemicals were of analytical grade. The HC (66 kDa), used in all studies, was from Affinity Biologicals (Hamilton, Ontario (ON), Canada) and gave a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Heparin (sodium salt, from porcine intestinal mucosa) and dermatan sulfate (sodium salt, from bovine mucosa) were both from Sigma (Mississauga, ON, Canada). Heparin was 179.2 units/mg (grade I-A), and the dermatan sulfate was 85% chondroitin sulfate B with any remainder being chondroitin sulfates A and C. Heparinase (heparin lyase, EC 4.2.2.7(hepase)) and chondroitinase ABC (chondroitin ABC lyase, EC 4.2.2.4(ABCase)) were from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Tosyl-glycyl-prolyl-arginyl-4-nitroanalide acetate and general protease P-5147 (which was devoid of GAG degrading activities) were from Sigma. Thrombin (IIa) was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN), while Na125I was from NEN Life Science Products (Mississauga, ON, Canada). Chloramine T was from BDH (Toronto, ON, Canada). The average molecular weights of the heparin and DS were 15,000 and 29,200 (determined by gel filtration), respectively. Heparin and DS were analyzed for chains that contained a free aldose aldehyde end group by reaction with 3,4-dinitrobenzoic acid (7.5 mm) in Na2CO3 (0.24 m) at ≈95 °C for 1 min, followed by measurement of absorbance at 548 nm to determine the amount of 4-amino-3-nitrobenzoate produced (28Borel E. Dueul H. Helvet. Chir. Acta. 1953; 36: 801-807Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The number of aldose aldehyde termini per GAG molecule was calculated by using a xylose standard curve and the average molecular weight for heparin or DS. Synthesis of HCH and HCD followed a procedure similar to that reported previously for ATH, based on the principle of covalent linkage through Schiff base -Amadori rearrangement at 40 °C (27Chan A. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell L. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). HC (0.5 mg in 52.5 μl of 0.02 m phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.3 (PBS)) was mixed with either heparin (27.8 mg in 0.5 ml of PBS) or DS (74.0 mg in 1 ml of PBS) in capped plastic tubes, followed by incubation at 40 °C for 10 days. Subsequently, the reaction mixtures were made 0.05 m in NaBH3CN (by addition of 0.5m NaBH3CN in PBS), and incubation continued at 37 °C for 5 h, in order to reduce any remaining Schiff base. Purification of the complexes formed was achieved by slight modification of the method used previously for production of ATH (27Chan A. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell L. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Each reaction mixture was made 2.5 m in (NH4)2SO4 by addition of 3.0m (NH4)2SO4, 0.02m phosphate, pH 7.0. In each case, the resultant mixture was immediately combined with 1.5 ml of pre-equilibrated, wet, packed butyl-agarose beads (agarose with ether-linked butyl groups, from Sigma)/ml of solution added. After gentle mixing for 30 min, the supernatant was discarded and, after washing the beads with 2.2m (NH4)2SO4 in buffer, the bound complex + free HC were eluted with 0.02 mphosphate, pH 7.0. Eluted material was dialyzed versus 0.01m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, followed by gentle mixing for 30 min with 0.5–1.0 ml of pre-equilibrated, wet, packed DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow beads (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The supernatant was discarded and, after washing the beads with 0.3 m NaCl, 0.01m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, purified complex was eluted with 2.0m NaCl, 0.01 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0. Purified HCH and HCD were concentrated by dialysis (12,000–14,000 molecular weight cut-off), versus PBS at 4 °C, under 1 atm N2pressure. The physicochemical properties and some activities of the HCH and HCD preparations were determined. Conjugates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Prior to electrophoresis, complexes were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with PBS; 0.01 unit of hepase/ml of 0.001 m CaCl2, 0.001m sodium acetate, 0.15 m NaCl; 0.5 unit of ABCase/ml of 0.001 m sodium acetate, 0.15 mNaCl; or 1 μg of P-5147/ml of 0.05 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue (for protein) and with alcian blue followed by silver (for GAG) (30Krueger R.C. Schwartz N.B. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Lanes containing either hepase/ABCase or protease-treated conjugate were scanned for either protein- or GAG-stained material, respectively, by laser densitometry (LKB Ultroscan XL). Comparison of the scans to standard curves, produced by scanning lanes containing varying amounts of either protein (HC) or GAG (heparin or DS), run on the same gel, allowed the mass of HC or GAG (heparin or DS) in each complex to be determined. Given the molecular weights of HC, heparin, and DS, the HC:GAG molar ratio for each conjugate could be calculated. Anticoagulant activity of HCH and HCD was determined by anti-factor Xa and anti-IIa assays in which catalysis of the inhibition of enzyme by exogenous plasma AT and HC were measured (reactions in which the increase in amount of Xa or thrombin inhibited by plasma AT and plasma HC was in vast excess to the conjugate being assayed). Anti-factor Xa activity was measured on an ACL300 using a kit (Stachrom anti-Xa, Diagnostica Stago, Asnières, France), which involved incubation of the sample in plasma with excess factor Xa for 30 s, followed by addition of a chromogenic substrate to measure residual activity. The amount of enzyme activity inhibited during the reaction was compared with a standard curve, constructed from reactions with plasma samples containing standard heparin (from Diagnostica Stago) of known concentrations (units/ml). The amount (units/ml) of the sample was divided by the amount (mg/ml) of heparin or DS present to obtain specific activities for the compound. The antithrombin activity in HCH preparations was determined using an assay similar to that for anti-factor Xa activity except that an anti-IIa kit was used (Instrumentation Laboratory, Lexington, MA). DS could not be measured by the anti-IIa kit due to the reduced sensitivity of the kit for DS. Therefore, DS and HCD antithrombin activity was quantitated by a modified activated partial thromboplastin time assay (using an ST4 machine (Diagnostica Stago, Asnières, France)); where 50 μl of 0.02 m CaCl2 was added to a mixture of 50 μl of Thrombosil I (Hemoliance, Raritan, NJ) + 50 μl of complex diluted in plasma (pre-incubated for 5 min at 37 °C), and the resultant clot time compared with a standard curve of dermatan sulfate in plasma. Addition of anti-human HC antibody neutralized all inhibitory activity, thus verifying that the DS antithrombin assay only detected activity against thrombin (HC only reacts with thrombin; Ref. 3Tollefsen D. Petska C. Monafa J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6713-6716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results for anti-factor Xa assays of HCH and HCD were expressed as units per mg of GAG in the conjugate. Anti-IIa results for HCH and HCD were calculated as the activity per mg of GAG assayed, and expressed as a percentage of the activity attained by the same amount (by mass) of standard heparin or DS. In order to determine that direct antithrombin activity was due to covalent binding of thrombin, HC (1 μm) or complexes (0.25 μm) were reacted with 0.18 μm125I-thrombin (labeled using chloramine T; Ref. 31Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar) at pH 7.4 for 2 h at 37 °C and the resultant products electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Rate of reaction with thrombin was investigated using pseudo first order kinetics. Ten μl of 2 nm thrombin in 0.02 m Tris·HCl, 0.15m NaCl, 0.6% polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4 (TSP) was added rapidly to a well (Nunc 96-well plate; Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) containing 10 μl of inhibitor in TSP at 23 °C. At various times, the inhibition mixture was neutralized by rapid addition of 200 μl of 222 μmtosyl-glycyl-prolyl-arginyl-4-nitroanalide acetate in 0.01 mg of Polybrene/ml of TSP and the remaining thrombin activity against the substrate measured at 405 nm over 10 min. Biomolecular rate constants for inhibition of thrombin were calculated by a method similar to that used previously for ATH (27Chan A. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell L. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which was derived from the work of Kitz and Wilson (32Kitz R. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3245-3249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following model (Reaction 1) was used as a kinetic mechanism for thrombin inhibition. IIa+A⇄k−1k1IIa·A(non­covalentcomplex)→k2IIa­A(covalentcomplex)REACTION 1 The inhibitor A = HCH, HCD, non-covalent HC·H, or non-covalent HC·DS complexes. Apparent rate constants (k app) were calculated from plots (semi-natural log) of the proportion of thrombin (IIa) activity remaining versus time (k app= −[ln(remaining thrombin activity/initial thrombin activity)]/time). Plots of 1/k app versus 1/A allowed for determination of bimolecular rate constants, given as the ratiok 2/K i = 1/slope (wherek 2 = 1/ordinate intercept andK i (the equilibrium constant for disappearance of IIa·A) = −1/abscissa intercept = (k −1 +k 2)/k 1). Samples of HC, HCH, and HCD were labeled with 125I using brief (30 s) reaction with chloramine T (31Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar) and recovery of the product in rabbit albumin (CooperBiomedial Inc., Malvern, PA) as a carrier. Under these conditions, labeled preparations were obtained that retained their integrity, as determined by PAGE. Rabbits (New Zealand White) were then injected intravenously with either H, DS, 125I-HC,125I-HCH, or 125I-HCD. At predetermined time points, 0.45-ml samples of blood were taken into 50 μl of 3.8% (m/v) Na3 citrate. The citrated blood was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 15 min and aliquots of the supernatant plasmas taken for anti-factor Xa heparin assay, DS analysis (modified activated partial thromboplastin time assay, as described above), or counting in a LKB 1272 Clinigamma γ-counter. Synthesis of HCH and HCD relied on Schiff base formation of HC lysyl amino groups with aldose aldehyde groups, followed by Amadori rearrangement. Analysis of free aldose aldehydes from aldose hemiacetal termini in heparin and DS resulted in calculated values of 0.18 and 0.56 per molecule, respectively. Thus, 0.82 and 0.44 of the molecules of heparin and DS, respectively, contained terminal monosaccharide residues which did not have a free aldehyde (likely glycosidically linked to serine; Ref. 33Hatton M.W.C. Berry L.R. Machovich R. Regoeczi E. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Isolation of HCH and HCD from starting materials was achieved by chromatography of the reaction mixtures on butyl-agarose followed by DEAE-Sepharose. SDS-PAGE of the elution of H, DS, HC, HCH, and HCD from butyl-agarose and DEAE-Sepharose is shown in Fig. 1. H and DS were displaced from butyl-agarose beads at high (NH4)2SO4 concentrations (2.5 and 2.2 m, respectively) while HC, HCH and HCD remained bound (Fig. 1 a). After elution of HC + HCH or HC + HCD (devoid of free H or DS, respectively) from butyl-agarose in buffer (no (NH4)2SO4), the material was applied to DEAE-Sepharose (0.01 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0). HC was removed from DEAE beads by 0.3 m NaCl, followed by elution of either HCH or HCD in buffered 2 m NaCl (Fig.1 b). Analysis of the final concentrated preparations showed that, in the separate syntheses, 6.4% of starting HC (by mass) was recovered as HCH and 3.4% was recovered as HCD. Low yields of the conjugates were not due to protein loss during purification since most of the HC could be recovered after DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. Analysis of the products by SDS-PAGE, followed by staining for protein or GAG and laser densitometry, showed that HCH was >99% and >96% free of unreacted HC and H, respectively, while HCD was >92% and >90% free of uncomplexed HC and DS, respectively (Fig.2). Purification of HCH or HCD by gel filtration of the reaction mixtures on Sephadex G-200 did not improve yield or purity.Figure 2Qualitative analysis of covalent heparin cofactor II-glycosaminoglycan complexes.Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% separating gel, reducing conditions) of covalent heparin cofactor II-heparin complex (lane 1) treated with protease (lane 2) or heparinase (lane 3) and covalent heparin cofactor II-dermatan sulfate complex (lane 4) treated with protease (lane 5) or chondroitinase ABC (lane 6) are shown.

Stability of the products was indicative of covalently bonded protein and GAG. Treatment of the compounds with protease or GAG degrading enzymes caused release of the constituent GAGs and HC, respectively (Fig. 2). Quantitative analyses of conjugate composition is given in Table I. Both HCH and HCD preparations had protein:GAG molar ratios of close to 1:1. Gel filtration of HCH and HCD on Sephadex G-200 in 2 m NaCl (to prevent multimerization) gave molecular mass ranges of 84–126 kDa and 90–135 kDa, respectively (using protein molecular weight standards as references).Table IPhysical properties of covalent heparin cofactor II-glycosaminoglycan complexesComplexHC:GAG molar ratioMolecular mass rangekDaHCH0.9384–126HCD1.0990–135HCH and HCD preparations were analyzed for relative protein and GAG content by SDS-PAGE of complexes and standards, followed by differential staining and densitometry.

Given the average molecular weights of the component species, the HC:GAG molar ratios could be determined. Molecular mass values of the conjugates were estimated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 under dissociative conditions (2m NaCl), in comparison with purified reference proteins. Reaction of each conjugate with125I-thrombin verified that 1:1 complexes are produced between inhibitor and enzyme (Fig. 3). Purified preparations were titrated with human thrombin in order to measure inhibitory capacity. For every mole of HCH and HCD used, 0.943 and 0.756 mol, respectively, of thrombin were consumed. Therefore, >94% of HCH and >75% of HCD molecules were active in forming inhibitor complexes with thrombin. Although stable at 4 °C, freezing of concentrated HCH and HCD solutions at −60 °C, followed by a single thawing at 37 °C, reduced thrombin reactive complexes to <10%. Specific activities against factor Xa and thrombin, in plasma, are shown in Table II. In the presence of exogenous plasma HC and antithrombin, both HCH and HCD displayed catalytic activity similar to that of starting H and DS (Table II). Interestingly, HCH was able to catalyze reaction of factor Xa with antithrombin (mechanism of anti-factor Xa assay); however, anti-factor Xa activity of HCD was minimal. Antithrombin (anti-IIa) activities of both conjugates were similar to those of the GAG starting materials (Table II). Calculation of the rate of reaction with thrombin was carried out on measurements of remaining thrombin activity over time at different inhibitor concentrations (Fig.4). The bimolecular rate constants of HCH and HCD were determined to be 1.4 × 107m−1 s−1 and 1.3 × 107m−1 s−1, respectively. These values compared with rate constants of 8.0 × 106m−1 s−1 for heparin and 6.8 × 106m−1s−1 for DS; both measured in the presence of saturating amounts (>10-fold molar excess) of HC. Interestingly,k 2 (rate for conversion of non-covalent thrombin-inhibitor complex to covalent thrombin-inhibitor complex) was ≈3 times slower for HCH than HCD (resulting in a ≈3 times lower value for K i (the equilibrium constant for disappearance of the non-covalent thrombin-inhibitor complex)).Table IIAnticoagulant activities of covalent heparin cofactor II-glycosaminoglycan complexesCompoundAnti-factor XaAnti-IIaunits/mg%Standard heparin184100Dermatan sulfate1.7100HCH18086HCD3.1110HCH and HCD were tested using a commercially available kit to measure inhibition of factor Xa activity (chromagenic end point assay). Inhibition of thrombin (IIa) was determined using either an anti-IIa kit, which analyzed reaction with exogenous IIa by measuring residual chromagenic activity (heparin and HCH), or a clot time based activated partial thromboplastin time assay (DS and HCD). Heparin standards were used in the anti-factor Xa and anti-IIa assays while a DS standard curve was used in the clot-based assay. All assays were in the presence of normal plasma and results represent catalysis of reaction of factor Xa or IIa with exogenous inhibitors (antithrombin or heparin cofactor II) by the test compounds. Anti-factor Xa activity is given as units/mg of glycosaminoglycan assayed. Anti-IIa activity is reported as percentage of activity observed for the same mass concentration of standard heparin or DS.
