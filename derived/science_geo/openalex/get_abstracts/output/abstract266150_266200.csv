https://openalex.org/W2052956590,It has been proven without doubt that mammary cancer and other types of cancer can be induced in rats by administration of estrogens. In a series of experiments with 85 rats subjected to various types of estrogenic treatment it was found that a daily dosage of 200 gamma of estrone administered intramuscularly was most suitable for the detailed study of the mechanism of cancer production in the mammary gland after 150-200 days. Injections of smaller doses would produce cancer in 350-400 days; cancer can be obtained more quickly by the implanting crystalline hormone in the form of pellets or with injections of hormone in oil. Attempts have been made to induce mammary carcinoma with estradiol and diethylstilbestrol; results from such experiments are not yet completed.

The broad geochemical anomaly over the caldera has superimposed on it a small zone of pronounced radon enrichment and mercury depletion coincident with the surface projection of a postulated dike of rising magma. Soil gas geochemistry studies can complement traditional geophysical and geodetical methods in the evaluation of potential volcanic eruption hazards."
https://openalex.org/W1987123793,"Interest in extraterrestrial causes for the apparent 26-to 32-million-year periodicity of mass extinctions has focused on the terminal Eocene event and older events, although there is now evidence of a mid-Oligocene event near the early/late Oligocene boundary, or about 32.4 million years ago. An abrupt (200,000 years or less) mid-Oligocene extinction event appears in the record of North American land mammals, which results in the selective disappearance of archaic members of the fauna and later diversification of other taxa. The selective nature of the extinctions suggests climatic and ecological causes rather than an extraterrestrial catastrophe. Increased mid-Oligocene glaciation, worldwide cooling, a major regression event, and abrupt changes in the flora are probably the immediate causes, and these may have resulted from changes in global oceanic circulation."
