https://openalex.org/W1993629125,"The molecular mechanisms controlling synaptogenesis in the central nervous system (CNS) are poorly understood. Previous reports showed that a glia-derived factor strongly promotes synapse development in cultures of purified CNS neurons. Here, we identify this factor as cholesterol complexed to apolipoprotein E-containing lipoproteins. CNS neurons produce enough cholesterol to survive and grow, but the formation of numerous mature synapses demands additional amounts that must be provided by glia. Thus, the availability of cholesterol appears to limit synapse development. This may explain the delayed onset of CNS synaptogenesis after glia differentiation and neurobehavioral manifestations of defects in cholesterol or lipoprotein homeostasis."

We screened a library to identify drug-like molecules to probe the relation between neurodegeneration and α-synuclein fibrilization. All but one of 15 fibril inhibitors were catecholamines related to dopamine. The inhibitory activity of dopamine depended on its oxidative ligation to α-synuclein and was selective for the protofibril-to-fibril conversion, causing accumulation of the α-synuclein protofibril. Adduct formation provides an explanation for the dopaminergic selectivity of α-synuclein–associated neurotoxicity in PD and has implications for current and future PD therapeutic and diagnostic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2154387825,"Type I collagen is the most abundant protein in humans, and it helps to maintain the integrity of many tissues via its interactions with cell surfaces, other extracellular matrix molecules, and growth and differentiation factors. Nearly 50 molecules have been found to interact with type I collagen, and for about half of them, binding sites on this collagen have been elucidated. In addition, over 300 mutations in type I collagen associated with human connective tissue disorders have been described. However, the spatial relationships between the known ligand-binding sites and mutation positions have not been examined. To this end, here we have created a map of type I collagen that includes all of its ligand-binding sites and mutations. The map reveals the existence of several hot spots for ligand interactions on type I collagen and that most of the binding sites locate to its C-terminal half. Moreover, on the collagen fibril some potentially relevant relationships between binding sites were observed including the following: fibronectin- and certain integrin-binding regions are near neighbors, which may mechanistically relate to fibronectin-dependent cell-collagen attachment; proteoglycan binding may potentially impact upon collagen fibrillogenesis, cell-collagen attachment, and collagen glycation seen in diabetes and aging; and mutations associated with osteogenesis imperfecta and other disorders show apparently nonrandom distribution patterns within both the monomer and fibril, implying that mutation positions correlate with disease phenotype. These and other observations presented here may provide novel insights into evaluating type I collagen functions and the relationships between its binding partners and mutations.

It is synthesized as a soluble, procollagen form, composed of globular C- and N-propeptides, joined to their respective ends of the triple helix (1Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Type I procollagen (Fig. 1A) is composed of two α1 and one α2 chains, each of about 1000 amino acids. Upon secretion from the cell the propeptides are cleaved by the C- and N-proteinases, and the collagen monomer is assembled into the collagen fibril (Fig. 1,A and B), which is the form of the protein found in tissues (Fig. 1C), and consists of microfibrils, or 5-mer bundles of overlapping monomers. Adjacent monomers overlap each other by 234 residues, giving rise to the 67-nm wide “D-period,” the basic repeat structure of the fibril, seen in electron micrographs of collagen fibrils (Fig. 1C). Each D-period consists of an “overlap” and a “gap” zone, which appear as alternating light and dark bands in negatively stained preparations or as a pattern of fine cross-fibril bands (called “a,” “b,” “c,” “d,” and “e” bands) in positively stained preparations (2Chapman J.A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1974; 2: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Type I collagen is proposed to be a key structural component of load-bearing tissues such as bones, tendons, and ligaments; however, it likely also plays many other physiologic functions. Thus, over the past 30 years various molecules and cells have been described that exhibit specific interactions with type I collagen, and for about half of these, their sites of interaction with the collagen triple helix and fibril have been mapped (Tables I andII). These include, for example, sequences proposed to mediate cell adhesion, binding to other matrix molecules, interactions with tissue calcification factors, and glycation, a process of glucose adduct formation onto protein, proposed to contribute to pathologies associated with diabetes and aging (3Reiser K.M.

In some cases, ligands were bound to the collagen I monomer, e.g. phosphophoryn and COMP, and examined by rotary shadowing electron microscopy. In other cases, binding regions on the fibril were visualized using antibodies or stains specific for various collagen interactive ligands and examined by transmission electron microscopy. Gross regions of interaction, such as those of the amyloid protein precursor, one of the α2(I) chain α2β1 integrin binding sites, and the interleukin-2 binding sites, were determined by studying ligand interactions with CNBr peptides of the type I collagen α1(I) or α2(I) chains.

Keys A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. of Sci. 1963; 110: 113-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1856) Google Scholar) and that 30% or more of total protein is represented by collagen (9Lehninger A.L. Biochemistry.2nd Ed. Worth Publishers, Inc., New York1975: 135Google Scholar,10Hall D.A. International Review of Connective Tissue Research, Vol. 2, p. 244. Academic Press, New York1964Google Scholar), and if it is assumed that type I collagen comprises at least 90% of total collagen, it can be calculated that an adult of 70 kg may contain more than 1 × 1021 type I collagen monomers. Thus, the D-period repeat of type I collagen, with its host of numerous functional domains, is perhaps the most prevalent module of extracellular information in the body. Yet, despite the ubiquity and functional significance of type I collagen, unlike for other matrix molecules such as fibronectin and laminin, a map including all of its known functional domains and ligand-binding sites has been unavailable. Thus, here we have begun construction of a map of type I collagen with a view toward identifying relevant interactions and spatial relationships between type I collagen, its ligands, and disease-associated mutations.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDistribution of Ligand-binding Sites and Functional Domains on Type I CollagenWhen the overall distributions of ligand-binding sites and functional domains on type I collagen are examined, three concentrations of sites, or potential hot spots of interaction, are apparent (Fig. 2, boxed regions 1, 2, and 3). These include a region near the N terminus, encompassing residues from about 80–200 (region 1), a more C-terminal region encompassing residues from about 680–830 (region 2), and another extending from about residue 920 to the C terminus (region 3). In general, more ligand-binding sites and functional domains map to the C-terminal half of the collagen molecule. Also, within the D-period most of the ligands interact with multiple sites on the fibril, which always map to two to three monomers, and for each ligand, there is never more than one binding site per monomer. These observations underscore the potential importance of intermonomer multivalency in ligand-fibril binding.Integrin-binding SitesType I collagen is considered an important substrate for cell adhesion, and receptors reported to mediate cell-type I collagen interactions include the α1β1 and α2β1 integrins (18Knight C.G.

Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) but was later shown relevant only for denatured collagen (28Gullberg D. Gehlsen K.R.

Major α1β1 and α2β1integrin-binding sites for native type I collagen have subsequently been localized to 10 regions approximately including residues 84–187, 488–541, and 724–829 by ultrastructural mapping of binding sites between integrin receptors and procollagen monomers (19Xu Y.

Putative integrin binding sequences were identified using two approaches. Thus, triple helical peptides were synthesized to generate a family of overlapping sequences spanning the cyanogen bromide peptide 3 of the α1(I) chain, and the GFPGER sequence at residues 502–508 was shown to be responsible for binding the von Willebrand Factor A-like domains (A-domains) of the α2β1 and α1β1 receptors as well as for mediating platelet- and HT1080 cell-type I collagen attachment (29Knight C.G.

GER or GER-like motifs were found to be present in all of the integrin-binding domains; thus, collagenous peptides were synthesized: GLPGERGRP (most N-terminal site) (Fig. 2, region 1), GFPGERGVQ (central site), and GASGERGPP (most C-terminal site) (Fig. 2, region 2) (19Xu Y.

Thus, the α2β1 and α1β1 receptors may share up to three ligand-binding sites on the type I collagen fibril.Potential Interplay between Integrin- and Matrix-binding SitesConsidering only some of the more recently mapped integrin-binding sites, several potentially significant relationships between these regions and other interactive sites become apparent from the collagen D-period map. For example, four of the integrin-binding sites (19Xu Y. Gurusiddappa S. Rich R.L. Owens R.T. Keene D.R. Mayne R. Hook A. Hook M. J. Biol.

This may relate to the observation that, at least for certain cell types, one mode of attachment to native type I collagen is fibronectin-dependent and is mediated by these integrin receptors (34Schoen R.C. Bentley K.L. Klebe R.J. Hybridoma. 1982; 1: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, the site of binding of the decorin core protein (35Keene D.R. San Antonio J.D. Mayne R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21801-21804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), which has been shown to interact with fibronectin (36Winnemoller M. Schmidt G. Kresse H. Eur. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38981-38989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, regions 2 and 3). This arrangement of sites could thus permit the formation of complexes of any of the integrin receptors, fibronectin, and the decorin core protein, which potentially could play a role in cell-type I collagen interactions. Engagement of type I collagen by cell surface PGs can also potentially modulate the activities of integrin-collagen interactions in a positive or negative manner (37Brennan M.J. Oldberg A. Hayman E.G. Ruoslathi E. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 4302-4307PubMed Google Scholar). Of note is that the site proposed to mediate heparin/HSPG binding to type I collagen, at position 87–90 (38San Antonio J.D. Lander A.D. Karnovsky M.J. Slayter H.S. J.

Thus, potentially, binding of HSPGs or of heparin to type I collagen could modulate integrin-collagen interactions directly (through competition for occupancy of overlapping binding sites) or indirectly (through steric hindrance of binding sites by the GAG chains). Likewise, one of the binding sites for the guanidine HCl-extracted decorin PG (40Yu L. Cummings C. Sheehan J.K. Kadler K.E. Holmes D.F. Chapman J.A. Scott J.E.

Treatment of cells with LMB greatly reduced the level of the smaller complex, suggesting that it originated from the CSN complex by nuclear export.

Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4986) Google Scholar). Among them, the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)1 inhibitor p27 (p27Kip1) is induced or activated by a variety of anti-mitogenic stimuli and is involved in developmental regulation and tumor suppression as well as in cell proliferation in vitroand in vivo (2Sherr C.J.

The expression of p27 is controlled both at the level of transcription and by multiple post-translational mechanisms, among which cell cycle-dependent and substrate-specific proteolysis seems to play an important role (3Sgambato A.

Down-regulation of p27 has been reported to involve the following: (i) phosphorylation of the Thr-187 residue by cyclin E-Cdk2 complex (5Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E.

However, the precise biochemical link between these events remains to be clarified. Nuclear exportation and subsequent degradation of p27 is induced by ectopic expression of Jab1/CSN5 (7Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J.-Y. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Jab1/CSN5 was originally identified as a co-activator of c-Jun transcription factor (13Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), and recent findings (14Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C.

Jab1/CSN5 can directly interact with p27 in vitro as well as in vivo, and in cells overexpressing ectopic Jab1, p27 was exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and induced to be degraded in a manner sensitive to chemical inhibitors of CRM1-dependent nuclear export and the 26 S proteasome. Jab1/CSN5-induced p27 down-regulation does not seem to be mediated through activation of c-Jun, because Jab1/CSN5 overexpression alone does not significantly increase AP-1 activity, and enhancement of AP-1 activity by c-Jun overexpression does not result in p27 down-regulation. Jab1/CSN5 overexpression enables mouse fibroblasts to progress from G0 to S phase in low serum, indicating that Jab1/CSN5 plays an important role in G1 progression and cell proliferation (7Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J.-Y. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Transportation of many proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is mediated by a nuclear export signal (NES) sequence (19Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar), which often contains a conserved stretch of characteristically spaced leucine residues. Mutation of these leucines in the NES core domain disrupts the ability of the protein to locate exclusively in the cytoplasm. CRM1, which belongs to the family of importin β-related nuclear transport receptors, directly and specifically associates with NES and mediates nuclear export of the protein (19Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 20Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The cytotoxin leptomycin B (LMB) disrupts the interaction between CRM1 and NES by directly binding to CRM1 and thereby inhibiting the action of CRM1 (21Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 886: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The energy dependence of nucleocytoplasmic transport can be partly explained by the requirement of the Ran GTPase protein, which is involved in the loading and unloading of the cargo proteins by the exportin (19Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 22Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33414-33422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The majority of endogenous Jab1/CSN5 molecules are included in the COP9 signalosome complex in living cells. The COP9 signalosome was originally identified in Arabidopsis as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis (15Wei N. Deng X.W. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 98-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Successful purification of the COP9 signalosome complex consisting of the identical 8 subunits from mammalian cells revealed that the function of the complex is not necessarily restricted to light/dark-mediated signal transduction in plants. Disruption of CSN5 leads to lethality at the late larva stage during Drosophila development (24Freilich S. Oron E. Kapp Y. Nevo-Caspi Y. Orgad S. Segal D. Chamovitz D.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1187-1190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of the mutant strains revealed that Arabidopsis lacking the COP9 signalosome complex not only fails to respond to darkness but also eventually fails to grow at a relatively early stage during development. These observations show that the COP9 signalosome complex plays a pivotal role in developmental regulation. Although noCSN genes were found in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome except for a Jab1/CSN5 homologue,Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains at least someCSN genes (CSN1 = Caa1, CSN2, -4, and -5) whose products function as a part of the checkpoint control mechanism (25Mundt K.E. Porte J. Murray J.M. Brikos C. Christensen P.U. Caspari T. Hagan I.M. Millar J.B. Simanis V. Hofmann K. Carr A.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1427-1430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the precise biochemical functions of the COP9 signalosome complex except for its associated kinase activity have not been clarified yet, each subunit has been independently characterized. CSN1 (also called GPS1) inhibits JNK1 (Jun N-terminal kinase) and represses Jun-dependent promoter activity (26Spain B.H. Bowdish K.S. Pacal A.R. Staub S.F. Koo D. Chang C.Y. Xie W. Colicelli J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6698-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). CSN2 (also called TRIP15; thyroid hormone receptor-interacting protein 15) interacts with the ligand-binding domain of receptors for thyroid hormone and retinoic acid (27Lee J.W. Choi H.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and alien, a Drosophila homologue of CSN2, is shown to function as a co-repressor of nuclear receptors (28Dressel U. Thormeyer D. Altincicek B. Paululat A. Eggert M. Schneider S. Tenbaum S.P. Renkawitz R. Baniahmad A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3383-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). TheCSN3 gene is hemizygously deleted in patients with Smith-Magenis syndrome (29Elsea S.H. Mykytyn K. Ferrell K. Coulter K.L. Das P. Dubiel W. Patel P.I. Metherall J.E. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 87: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). CSN6 is identical to human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, Vpr-interacting protein and is functionally involved in the G2/M phase transition (30Mahalingam S. Ayyavoo V. Patel M. Kieber-Emmons T. Kao G.D. Muschel R.J. Weiner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3419-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recently, more data on the function of Jab1/CSN5 in addition to the regulator of c-Jun and p27 have been accumulated (17Chamovitz D.A. Segal D. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Jab1/CSN5 activates complexes between SRC-1 (steroid receptor co-activator-1) and various nuclear receptors (31Chauchereau A. Georgiakaki M. Perrin-Wolff M. Milgrom E. Loosfelt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8540-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), promotes degradation of the intracellular precursor of the lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor (32Li S. Liu X. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13386-13393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and participates in the LFA-1 integrin-mediated signal transduction (33Bianchi E. Denti S. Granata A. Bossi G. Geginat J. Villa A. Rogge L. Pardi R. Nature. 2000; 404: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In anergic T-cells, p27 and Jab1/CSN5 participate in antigen-specific T-cell unresponsiveness (34Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Taylor P.A. Berezovskaya A. Grass I. Blazar B.R. Nadler L.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The next obvious question is whether the functions of Jab1/CSN5 mentioned above are mediated by the Jab1/CSN5 monomer or by the COP9 signalosome complex. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of nuclear export mediated by Jab1/CSN5, the physiological importance of Jab1/CSN5 in p27 regulation, and the involvement of other components of the COP9 signalosome complex in nuclear export and p27 regulation. NIH3T3, Swiss 3T3, and COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. In some experiments, cells were treated with LMB (2 ng/ml, purified and prepared by M. Yoshida, see Ref. 21Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

For cell cycle experiments, cells were arrested in G0/G1 by culture in medium containing 0.1% serum or kept contact-inhibited for 48 h, and the cell cycle was re-activated by transferring the cells to 10% serum or at 10% confluence. The cell cycle profile was monitored by flow cytometric analysis of DNA content or by BrdUrd incorporation as described (7Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J.-Y.

For the evaluation of BrdUrd incorporation, cells stained with rabbit polyclonal antibody followed by TR-linked anti-rabbit IgG were treated with 1.5 m HCl and stained with anti-BrdUrd mouse monoclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-linked anti-mouse IgG. The cell samples were viewed by phase contrast or fluorescence microscopy. More than 500 cells were enumerated for each sample. cDNA fragments corresponding to amino acid residues 1–334, 1–198, and 199–334 of mouse Jab1/CSN5 were amplified by PCR and sequenced to confirm sequence integrity. cDNA fragments were inserted into pGEX (Amersham Biosciences) in-frame with GST. GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified as described (36Akamatsu E. Tanaka T. Kato J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16494-16500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Mammalian cell extracts were isolated from proliferating mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts in Tween 20 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, 1% aprotinin, and 0.5% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Binding was performed by incubating GST fusion proteins (10 μg) immobilized on the beads with cell lysates (corresponding to 5 × 106 cells) supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 1 h, and the protein complexes were washed in the same buffer. Bound CRM1 was detected by immunoblotting using a CRM1-specific antibody. To examine interaction between p27 mutants and Jab1/CSN5, the same amount of GST fusion proteins containing p27 variants was mixed with recombinant Jab1/CSN5 or cyclin D1-Cdk4 proteins in Tween 20 buffer as described (7Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J.-Y. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were measured by immunoblotting followed by densitometry. The amount of proteins bound to wild type p27 was set to 100%. Entire coding sequences of mouse and human cDNA were amplified by PCR (CSN1 and -8 from human K562 erythroleukemia cDNA library and CSN2–4, -6, -7a, and 7b from mouse T-cell lymphoma cDNA library) and were inserted into pGEX (Amersham Biosciences) and pQE vectors (Qiagen). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies were produced against His6-tagged polypeptides expressed in bacteria. The generation of antibodies to Jab1/CSN5 and CRM1 was described previously (7Tomoda K. Kubota Y.

All anti-CSN antibodies were tested for specificity and found not to cross-react with other CSN subunits but to recognize both human and mouse proteins. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were affinity-purified using purified GST-tagged recombinant proteins immobilized onto CNBr-activated Sepharose beads. Elution of bound IgG was performed at pH 2.5 and 3.5. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against GST (Z-5), p27 (C-19), Cdk2 (M2), FLAG (D-8), c-Jun (D), Jun B (210), Jun D (329), Cdk4 (C-22), and Grb2 (C-23) and mouse monoclonal antibody to cyclin D1 (72–13G) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to mouse retinoblastoma protein (XZ91, G3–245), p27 (clone 57), and an HA peptide epitope (12CA5) were obtained from PharMingen, Transduction Laboratories, and Sigma, respectively. Anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibody (HA.11) was obtained from Babco.

For glycerol gradient centrifugation analysis, 1 ml of cell lysate was layered onto 10 ml of a 10–40% linear glycerol gradient containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After centrifugation for 24 h at 27,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti40 rotor at 4 °C, 0.5-ml fractions were collected from the bottom and analyzed by immunoblotting. To perform nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation, cells were treated on ice with 0.025% digitonin-containing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and the buffer was immediately recovered as cytoplasmic fractions. Subsequently, cells were incubated with the same buffer without digitonin for 2 min on ice, and nuclear fractions were collected. For selective immunoprecipitation of mini-CSN by our antibody against Jab1/CSN5, incubation of Tween 20 cell lysates with antibody was performed for less than 5 h. An overnight reaction allowed the antibody to recognize certain amounts of the COP9 signalosome complex. This is presumably because the minor population of polyclonal antibody can slowly recognize the 450-kDa COP9 signalosome complex or alternatively because incubation at 4 °C for an extended period alters the conformation of the COP9 signalosome complex such that Jab1/CSN5 epitopes become accessible to the antibody. cDNA corresponding to C-terminal amino acid residues 80–197 of p27 was amplified by PCR (35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min) in a low fidelity PCR buffer (40Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Appl. 1994; 3: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) containing 0.5 mm MnCl2, twice as much Taq polymerase (5 units/100 μl), an increased concentration of MgCl2 (final concentration 7 mm), and extra dCTP and dTTP (final concentration 1 mm) in addition to the standard PCR mixture (preliminary experiments using the lacZ gene as a target showed that the mutation rate under these conditions was more than 80%), and cloned into the pAS2 vector. The size of this mini-p27 library was about 104. All six clones randomly picked from the mini-library contained 1–6 point mutations that contribute to amino acid substitutions. The p27 mini-library was transformed into Y190 yeast cells together with the pACT-Jab1/CSN5 plasmid. To select the mutants unable to interact with Jab1/CSN5, transfectant colonies grown on Trp−Leu− selection medium were tested for β-galactosidase activity, and the white colonies were chosen. Plasmids containing mutated p27 cDNA were recovered from yeast cells and were again tested as to whether they either confer the His requirement or induce the β-galactosidase activity in Y190 cells when transformed with pACT-Jab1/CSN5. The relative β-galactosidase activities contained in lysates isolated from yeast cells were evaluated using β-Galactosidase Reporter Gene Assay kits (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclear export plays an important role in the down-regulation of p27 in cells ectopically overexpressing Jab1/CSN5 because LMB prevents p27 breakdown (7Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J.-Y. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), but we did not find the typical leucine-rich type NES sequence in p27, which prompted us to hypothesize that it is not p27 but Jab1/CSN5 that is the direct target for CRM1-dependent nuclear export. To examine this possibility, we fused the entire coding sequence of Jab1/CSN5 to GST, and we employed an in vitrobinding assay using GST fusion proteins immobilized on beads and cell lysates from proliferating mouse fibroblasts. As expected, the GST-fused Jab1/CSN5 recombinant protein, but not GST alone, was able to interact with CRM1 contained in the lysates in vitro (Fig.1A). Under these conditions, we did not detect interaction between GST-tagged p27 and CRM1 (negative data not shown), indicating that p27 does not contain functional CRM1-binding motifs. Addition of the strong ionic detergent (0.1% SDS) to the reaction mixture inhibited genuine interaction, but the presence of 0.1% non-ionic detergents such as Nonidet P-40 and Tween 20 did not disrupt the Jab1-CSN5-CRM1 complex and reduced the nonspecific binding. Tween 20 had less inhibitory effect on the complex formation than Nonidet P-40. Incubation at 4 °C prevented interaction between the two components (negative data not shown), suggesting that certain enzymatic activities are required for efficient binding of CRM1 to Jab1/CSN5. In fact, it is reported that the efficient and specific association of CRM1 with the NES sequence depends upon the GTP-bound form of the Ran GTPase (19Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 22Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33414-33422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Based upon these results, we performed in vitro binding assays in a buffer containing Tween 20 at 37 °C. In addition to the full-length Jab1/CSN5 protein, the C-terminal truncated mutant (Jab1(C)) containing amino acids 199–334, but not the N terminus mutant (amino acids 1–198, Jab1(N)), bound to CRM1 under these in vitro conditions (Fig.1A). Careful observation of the C-terminal amino acid sequence of Jab1/CSN5 revealed that this region contains the leucine-rich NES-like sequence at amino acids 233–242 (Fig.1B), which is conserved among Jab1/CSN5 proteins from various species. The minimum region (amino acids 233–242) consisting only of this motif was sufficient to interact with CRM1 in vitro, and conversion of leucine residues at 237, 240, and 241 to alanine disrupted the binding (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, addition of LMB to the binding reaction buffer completely blocked the interaction (Fig. 1D). Thus, Jab1/CSN5 contains the leucine-rich NES-like sequence in the C-terminal region, through which Jab1/CSN5 can interact with CRM1. Ectopically expressed Jab1/CSN5 is located both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm and induces a reduction in the nuclear p27 signals. Treatment of cells with 2 ng/ml LMB for 5 h markedly increased the amount of Jab1/CSN5 in the nucleus and prevented down-regulation of p27 (Fig. 1, E and F, and see Ref. 7Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J.-Y. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The Jab1/CSN5 molecule containing a mutant NES (alanine from leucine at 237, 240, and 241) was located mostly in the nucleus, although some signal was still observed in the cytoplasm. However, these cytoplasmic signals did not disappear in the presence of LMB, indicating that the NES mutant of Jab1/CSN5 is refractory to the action of LMB (Fig. 1E). Importantly, mutations in the NES sequence markedly impaired the ability of Jab1/CSN5 to mislocate and down-regulate the endogenous p27 protein (Fig. 1, E and F). Thus, Jab1/CSN5 contains the LMB-sensitive NES sequence in the C-terminal region, and interaction of CRM1 with this motif is required for nuclear export of Jab1/CSN5 and su"

Antigenic proteins frequently contain disulfide bonds, and their reduction in the endocytic pathway facilitates processing. In humans, a gamma interferon–inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) is constitutively present in late endocytic compartments of APCs. Here, we identified the mouse homolog of GILT and generated a GILT knockout mouse. GILT facilitated the processing and presentation to antigen-specific T cells of protein antigens containing disulfide bonds. The response to hen egg lysozyme, a model antigen with a compact structure containing four disulfide bonds, was examined in detail."

Compared with microtubules assembled from purified tubulin, microtubules in a physiological environment polymerize faster and transit more frequently between polymerization and depolymerization. These dynamic properties are essential for the functions of the microtubule cytoskeleton during diverse cellular processes. Here, we have reconstituted the essential features of physiological microtubule dynamics by mixing three purified components: tubulin; a microtubule-stabilizing protein, XMAP215; and a microtubule-destabilizing kinesin, XKCM1. This represents an essential first step in the reconstitution of complex microtubule dynamics-dependent processes, such as chromosome segregation, from purified components."

https://openalex.org/W2015368358,"Trithorax (Trx) is a member of the trithorax group (trxG) of epigenetic regulators, which is required to maintain active states of Hox gene expression during development. We have purified from Drosophila embryos a trithorax acetylation complex (TAC1) that contains Trx, dCBP, and Sbf1. Like CBP, TAC1 acetylates core histones in nucleosomes, suggesting that this activity may be important for epigenetic maintenance of gene activity. dCBP and Sbf1 associate with specific sites on salivary gland polytene chromosomes, colocalizing with many Trx binding sites. One of these is the site of the Hox gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx). Mutations in either trx or the gene encoding dCBP reduce expression of the endogenous Ubx gene as well as of transgenes driven by the bxd regulatory region of Ubx. Thus Trx, dCBP, and Sbf1 are closely linked, physically and functionally, in the maintenance of Hox gene expression."

Another EHEC O157:H7 protein, the Transferred intimin receptor (Tir), is considered the primary receptor for intimin-γ. Nevertheless, Tir-independent binding of intimin-γ to HEp-2 cells has been reported. This observation suggests the existence of a eukaryotic receptor(s) for intimin-γ. In this study, we sought to identify that receptor(s). First, we determined by equilibrium binding titration that the association of purified intimin-γ with HEp-2 cells was specific and consistent with a single host cell receptor. Second, we isolated a protein from lysates of HEp-2 cells that bound intimin-γ and subsequently identified this molecule as nucleolin, a protein involved in cell growth regulation that can be cell surface-expressed. Third, we established that purified intimin-γ and nucleolin were co-localized on the surface of HEp-2 cells and that the site of EHEC O157:H7 attachment was associated with regions of nucleolin expression. Finally, we demonstrated that mouse anti-nucleolin sera significantly decreased the adherence of EHEC O157:H7 to HEp-2 cells. From this, we conclude that nucleolin is the HEp-2 cell receptor for intimin-γ expressed by EHEC O157:H7.

E. coli O157:H7 belongs to a subset of STEC designated enterohemorrhagic E. coli (or EHEC) that not only makes Shiga toxins but also produces a protein called intimin (2Jerse A.E. Yu J. Tall B.D.

In addition to intimin and Tir, the LEE contains genes for a type III secretion system (6Jarvis K.G. Giron J.A. Jerse A.E. McDaniel T.K. Donnenberg M.S. Kaper J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acting in concert, these proteins expressed from the LEE induce the host cell to produce an actin-rich pedestal that appears to cup the bacterium and anchor it into place (reviewed in Ref. 8Goosney D.L. de Grado M. Finlay B.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). EHEC O157:H7 intimin belongs to a family of adhesin molecules that are produced by bacteria capable of evoking A/E lesions, i.e.enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Hafnei alvei, Citrobacter rodentium, as well as EPEC-like bacteria of rabbits and dogs (3Levine M.M.

Members of the intimin family of adhesins are also related to the invasins of Yersinia enterocolitica andYersinia pseudotuberculosis (11Isberg R.R. Voorhis D.L. Falkow S. Cell. 1987; 50: 769-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Not all regions of the intimins and invasin share equivalent amino acid sequence homologies. Indeed, the transmembrane domains of these proteins are relatively conserved, but the sequences of the carboxyl-terminal regions that contain the putative host cell binding domain are divergent (12Frankel G. Candy D.C. Everest P. Dougan G. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1835-1842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13McGraw E.A. Li J. Selander R.K. Whittam T.S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For the Yersinia invasins, these carboxyl-terminal regions bind to the eukaryotic β1integrin receptor (14Isberg R.R. Leong J.M. Cell. 1990; 60: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), whereas for the EPEC and EHEC O157:H7 intimins the carboxyl-terminal domain is required for direct binding to the LEE-encoded intimin receptor Tir (15Batchelor M. Prasannan S. Daniell S. Reece S. Connerton I. Bloomberg G. Dougan G. Frankel G. Matthews S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2452-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Currently, intimins have been classified into at least five different types (α, β, γ, δ, and ε) based on homologies in the carboxyl termini of the proteins (16Adu-Bobie J. Frankel G. Bain C.

Several lines of evidence indicate that intimin-γ is the primary adhesin of EHEC O157:H7. First, intimin-γ is required for adherence of EHEC O157:H7 to tissue culture cells and human pediatric explants (18Donnenberg M.S. Tzipori S. McKee M.L. O'Brien A.D. Alroy J. Kaper J.B. J. Clin.

Third, disruption of the intimin-γ eae gene abolishes adherence of EHEC (18Donnenberg M.S. Tzipori S. McKee M.L. O'Brien A.D. Alroy J. Kaper J.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1418-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Fourth, antiserum raised against intimin-γ blocks binding of EHEC O157:H7 to cultured epithelial cells (22McKee M.L.

The probable role of intimin-γ as an adherence factor for EHEC O157:H7 has prompted an intense search for its putative host cell receptor. Based on both the homology between invasin and the intimins and the capacity of invasin to mediate Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis invasion of the host cells by binding to β1 chain integrins (14Isberg R.R. Leong J.M. Cell. 1990; 60: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), the integrin-binding properties of intimins have been investigated.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20359-20364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the current consensus in the literature is that intimin association with β1 chain integrins is not essential for adherence (28Liu H. Magoun L. Leong J.M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2045-2049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rather, Finlay and co-workers (4De Kenny B. Vinney R. Stein M. Reinscheid D.J. Frey E.A. Finlay B.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 29De Vinney R. Stein M. Reinscheid D. Abe A. Ruschkowski S. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2389-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) convincingly demonstrated that EPEC intimin-α as well as EHEC O157:H7 intimin-γ bind to the cognate bacterial Tir protein that is injected into the host cell by the bacteria. However, the pattern of phosphorylation of EHEC O157:H7 Tir after injection into the host cell is different from that of EPEC Tir, an observation that may suggest differences in the function of these proteins within the eukaryotic cell (29De Vinney R. Stein M. Reinscheid D. Abe A. Ruschkowski S. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2389-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of the tir gene in both EPEC and EHEC abolishes adherence, and this finding supports the critical role of the interaction between Tir and intimin during infection (4De Kenny B. Vinney R. Stein M. Reinscheid D.J. Frey E.A. Finlay B.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 29De Vinney R. Stein M. Reinscheid D. Abe A. Ruschkowski S. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2389-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). That intimin binds to Tir on the host cell surface is incontrovertible. Nevertheless, there is also indirect evidence for a eukaryotic intimin receptor. The findings in favor of such a cellular receptor are as follows. First, enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic E. coli preferentially colonize different portions of the gastrointestinal tract, i.e. these microbes infect the small intestine and large intestine, respectively (3Levine M.M. J. Infect. Dis. 1987; 155: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). This specific tissue tropism appears to be influenced by intimin, as work by Tziporiet al. (21Tzipori S. Gunzer F. Donnenberg M.S. de Montigny L. Kaper J.B. Donohue-Rolfe A. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3621-3627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that in gnotobiotic pigs the location of EPEC colonization can be altered based on the type of intimin (EPEC intimin-α or EHEC intimin-γ) the bacteria express. Furthermore, experiments with human intestinal tissue demonstrate that bacteria that express intimin-γ adhere selectively to the follicle-associated epithelium above the Peyer's patches, whereas the same bacteria that express intimin-α adhere to both the small intestinal mucosa and the follicle-associated epithelium of Peyer's patches (30Phillips A.D. Frankel G. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Second, as inferred earlier, the genetic sequences that encode the host cell binding domains of the different intimin types are far more divergent than the surrounding, more conserved sequences (31Perna N.T. Mayhew G.F. Posfai G. Elliott S. Donnenberg M.S. Kaper J.B. Blattner F.R. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3810-3817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence divergence in the host cell binding regions of the intimins most likely represents changes advantageous for colonization of a particular niche by the different LEE-containing bacteria (12Frankel G. Candy D.C. Everest P. Dougan G. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1835-1842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13McGraw E.A. Li J. Selander R.K. Whittam T.S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A final line of evidence that suggests that intimin may have a host cell surface receptor other than Tir comes from mutational analysis of the host cell binding domain of intimin-α. Mutations in this region of the adhesin disrupt the capacity of the bacteria to adhere to the host cell but do not interfere with the in vitro interaction between intimin and Tir (32Frankel G. Candy D.C. Fabiani E. Adu-Bobie J. Gil S. Novakova M. Phillips A.D. Dougan G. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4323-4328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Frankel G. Philips A.D. Novakova M. Batchelor M. Hicks S. Dougan G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). If Tir functions as the sole intimin receptor, such mutations should not affect bacterial adherence. One caveat to this interpretation is that these mutations may not disrupt binding in vitro but may destabilize the interaction between intimin and Tirin vivo sufficiently to prevent adherence (34Luo Y. Frey E.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Creagh A.L. Knoechel D.G. Haynes C.A. Finlay B.B. Strynadka N.C. Nature. 2000; 405: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). If intimin does bind to a eukaryotic receptor in a manner analogous to that of the invasin-integrin interaction, then purified intimin should bind to the surface of host cells. In fact, several groups have investigated the binding of purified intimin to tissue culture cells with varying results. Frankel and colleagues (12Frankel G. Candy D.C. Everest P. Dougan G. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1835-1842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hartland E.L. Batchelor M. Delahay R.M. Hale C. Matthews S. Dougan G. Knutton S. Connerton I. Frankel G. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) reported that fusion proteins that contained the carboxyl-terminal domain of intimin bind in a punctate manner across the HEp-2 cell surface, whereas De Vinney et al. (29De Vinney R. Stein M. Reinscheid D. Abe A. Ruschkowski S. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2389-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Liu et al. (36Liu H. Magoun L. Luperchio S. Schauer D.B. Leong J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) have found that purified intimin does not bind to HeLa cells unless Tir is first inserted into the host cell membrane by preinfection with an intimin-deletion strain. In accordance with the methodology described by Frankel et al. (12Frankel G. Candy D.C. Everest P. Dougan G. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1835-1842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our experience has been that both holointimin-γ and its carboxyl-terminal domain alone can bind to HEp-2 tissue culture cells in the absence of Tir. 2L. J. Gansheroff and A. D. O'Brien, unpublished data.2L. J. Gansheroff and A. D. O'Brien, unpublished data. For the research presented in this paper, our goals were to quantify the binding of purified intimin-γ to HEp-2 cells, identify the intimin-γ receptor on the cells, and determine whether this interaction is of biological significance with respect to the adherence of EHEC O157:H7 to these epithelial cells. EHEC O157:H7 strain 86-24 was isolated in 1986 from a patient in Seattle, WA and was kindly provided by Dr. Phil Tarr (Children's Hospital and Medical Center, Seattle, WA). DNA isolated from this strain served as a template for amplification of both the eae (intimin-γ) andtir genes. The histidine-tagged expression plasmids pEB313 (encodes all but the first 34 amino acids (potential signal sequence) of the eae gene) and pMW103 (encodes the carboxyl-terminal third of intimin) as well as the E. coli strain L172 that was used for overexpression of intimin-γ proteins have been described previously (24Gansheroff L.J. Wachtel M.R. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6409-6417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37McKee M.L. O'Brien A.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2225-2233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The entire tir gene with some flanking sequence was amplified from EHEC O157:H7 strain 86-24 by PCR with primers that incorporated XbaI restriction sites into the wild-type sequence (31Perna N.T. Mayhew G.F. Posfai G. Elliott S. Donnenberg M.S. Kaper J.B. Blattner F.R. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3810-3817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (GTCATCTAGAGCCGTTTATCGACTACGTGC upstream and CAGAAGCTCTAGAGTTGCCATCC downstream). Restriction enzyme digest patterns of the PCR product were consistent with that of the published sequence for tir (31Perna N.T. Mayhew G.F. Posfai G. Elliott S. Donnenberg M.S. Kaper J.B. Blattner F.R. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3810-3817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fragment was then ligated into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene) to permit overexpression of the Tir protein. This construct was designated pTir and was subsequently transformed into theE. coli strain BL21 (Novagen) that contains a chromosomally encoded T7 polymerase gene under control of the lacrepressor. Plasmid p166 was generously provided by Drs. William Day and Anthony Maurelli (Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD). This pBAD-based plasmid (38Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3923) Google Scholar) contains the gene for the green fluorescent protein (39Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S.L. Gene. 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar) inserted behind an arabinose-inducible promoter. Plasmid p166 was transformed into EHEC strain 86-24 by electroporation. GFP expression was induced with 1% arabinose and was used as a means of visualizing bacterial adherence to HEp-2 cells (see “Bacterial Adherence Assay” below for details). HEp-2 (ATCC CCL23) human laryngeal epithelial cells were maintained by serial passage in EMEM (BioWhittaker), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 20 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, 10 units/ml penicillin G, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin (called complete EMEM). Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For subconfluent HEp-2 cell monolayers, 8-well chamber slides (Lab-Tek) were seeded with 6 × 104 cells/well in complete EMEM and incubated for no more than 24 h (∼80% confluent) before use. Confluent HEp-2 cell monolayers were prepared according to a method previously described for Vero cells (40Wilson B.A. Aminova L.R. Ponferrada V.G. Ho M.L. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). HEp-2 cells were seeded into 8-well chamber slides at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well and incubated for 72 h. The medium in each well was then removed and replaced with complete EMEM that contained 1% fetal calf serum. Cells were maintained under these conditions for up to 48 h prior to use. Luria broth cultures (250 ml) ofE. coli strain L172 transformed with pEB313, pMW103, orE. coli strain BL21 transformed with pTir were grown at 37 °C to an optical density (A600 nm) of 0.8, and protein was expression induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside. Four h after induction, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by the addition of 5 m guanidine hydrochloride, pH 8. Insoluble protein was removed from the lysate by centrifugation. Proteins were then purified from the clarified lysates as follows. Each histidine-tagged intimin-γ protein was purified by passage over a nickel affinity resin (Ni-NTA, Qiagen). Columns were washed with 10 column volumes of 8 m urea, pH 8, followed by 10 column volumes of 8 m urea, pH 6.5. Tagged proteins were eluted by the addition of 2 column volumes of 8 m urea, pH 4.5. The eluted proteins were dialyzed thoroughly against 100 mmsodium phosphate monobasic buffer at pH 4.5, which allowed intimin-γ to remain soluble at high concentration. Proteins were stored frozen at −20 °C in dialysis buffer until needed. The concentrations of the histidine-tagged intimin-γ proteins were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 119710m−1 cm−1 calculated from the amino acid composition of the intimin-γ sequence. Please note that for purposes of brevity, these nickel affinity-purified, histidine-tagged intimin-γ proteins are referred to in this article as intimin-γ or intimin-γ carboxyl-terminal third. We have no reason to suspect that addition of the histidine tag at the amino terminus of the proteins alters in any way the adhesion mediated by the carboxyl-terminal extracellular domain of intimin. The Tir protein was extracted from isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside-induced cultures with 5m urea and concentrated from clarified lysates by 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the precipitate was dialyzed against 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7. The dialysate was then subjected to anion-exchange column chromatography with DEAE-Sephadex A-50 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Protein was eluted from the column with 0.45 m NaCl and was ∼80% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE. Nucleolin was purified from HEp-2 cells as follows. Cells were lysed in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, that contained 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 150 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Soluble nucleolin was extracted from solution with DEAE Sephadex A-50 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and eluted from the resin with lysis buffer that contained 500 mm NaCl. Eluted proteins were precipitated with 30% ammonium chloride and dialyzed against 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 6.5, that contained 250 mm NaCl. The dialysate was then subjected to DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) anion-exchange column chromatography. The column was washed with phosphate buffer containing 300 mm NaCl, and protein was eluted from the column with a linear salt gradient from 300 to 500 mm NaCl. Fractions that contained the highest concentration of nucleolin were pooled. This material appeared homogeneous on Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE and ran as one spot on a two-dimensional gel. An IgG monoclonal antibody against intimin-γ was prepared in collaboration with Virion Systems Inc. (Rockville, MD) 3M. R. Wachtel, L. J. Gansheroff, R. F. Schuman, and A. D. O'Brien, unpublished data.Polyclonal antiserum against intimin-γ was produced in conjunction with Duncroft, Inc. (Lovettsville, VA) by immunization of a sheep with purified intimin-γ mixed with Freund's adjuvant. 4M. Mills, E. M. Twiddy, and A. D. O'Brien, unpublished data. Anti-nucleolin monoclonal antibody C23 (MS-3) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Polyclonal antibodies against HEp-2 cell nucleolin were raised in 6–8-week-old BALB/c female mice by intraperitoneal injection of protein eluted from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel slice and mixed with adjuvant. Serum samples from mice were tested by Western blot analysis for reactivity to HEp-2 cell nucleolin, and immunoreactive serum samples were pooled. Normal mouse serum was obtained from nonimmunized mice of the same lot. In conjunction with Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. (Reamstown, PA), polyclonal antiserum against Tir was produced in a rabbit by subcutaneous injection of electroeluted Tir mixed with adjuvant. Secondary antibodies were obtained from the following suppliers: HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG from Bio-Rad Laboratories; FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Proteins used in this study were separated by molecular weight using SDS-PAGE with a Mini-PROTEAN II Electrophoresis Cell (Bio-Rad) following standard protocols. For two-dimensional electrophoresis, detergent-solubilized HEp-2 proteins were separated in the first dimension by isoelectric focusing using the Mini-PROTEAN Tube Cell (Bio-Rad) and then in the second dimension by SDS-PAGE. Protein gels were blotted onto Optitran nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) with a Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Electrophoretic Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with PBS, pH 7.4, that contained 5% powdered milk and 0.2% Tween 20. For Western analyses, both primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 5% powdered milk, 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS. The anti-nucleolin monoclonal antibody was used at a 1:5,000 dilution and the anti-intimin monoclonal antibody at a 1:7,000 dilution. The HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody was diluted 1:20,000. Immunoreactive proteins were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). For intimin-γ protein overlay assays, purified intimin-γ was diluted to a concentration of 3 μg/ml in PBS, pH 6.5 that contained 2% powdered milk and 0.2% Tween 20. This solution was incubated with blots of SDS-PAGE separated HEp-2 proteins that were not heated or reduced before electrophoresis. Intimin-γ that had bound to specific HEp-2 cell proteins was detected with anti-intimin monoclonal antibodies as described above. For nucleolin protein overlay assays, HEp-2 cells were extracted with 50 mm phosphate buffer pH 8 that contained 0.1% Triton X-100, and the soluble proteins were diluted into PBS, pH 6.5, that contained 2% powdered milk and 0.2% Tween 20. This solution was incubated with immunoblots of intimin-γ (full-length and carboxyl-terminal third) that had been separated by SDS-PAGE without heating or reduction of the samples. Nucleolin from the HEp-2 extract that had bound to intimin-γ or the carboxyl-terminal third of intimin-γ was detected with anti-nucleolin monoclonal antibodies per the above protocol. Intimin-γ was covalently linked by means of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimiide hydrochloride (Sigma) to carboxylate-modified polystyrene particles (Seradyn, Inc.). Bovine serum albumin was covalently linked to the same type of particles as a control to assess the level of nonspecific binding of HEp-2 cell extracts to that matrix. HEp-2 cells were lysed in a 10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 8, that contained 136 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl, 0.5 mm CaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 150 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The pH of the cell extract was then reduced to 6 by a dropwise addition of HCl. Insoluble protein was removed by centrifugation, and the clarified supernatant was mixed gently with the intimin-γ−linked polystyrene particles for 1 h at 25 °C. The particles were removed from solution and washed extensively with buffer. HEp-2 cell proteins that had bound to intimin-γ were eluted by rinsing particles with a 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7, that contained 250 mm NaCl. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. A HEp-2 cell protein with an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa was selected for amino acid sequencing because it displayed the most intense immunoreactive band in intimin-γ protein overlay assays. Following intimin-γ affinity purification, this protein was excised from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and sent to the Protein Chemistry Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry, Texas A&M University. In that laboratory, the protein in the gel slice was reduced, alkylated, and digested with Endo-LysC. Peptides were extracted and purified by reverse-phase, narrow bore, high-pressure liquid chromatography. The purified peptides were then subjected to automated Edman protein sequencing on a Hewlett Packard G1000A Automated Protein Sequencer. Peptide sequences obtained by these methods were used as input for a BLAST search (41Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69694) Google Scholar) of the available data bases. Purified intimin-γ was labeled with biotinamidocaproate N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma) in 0.1 m sod"

Photoelectron spectra of these clusters revealed that the solute dianions were in the center of the water cluster, (H 2 O) n . For small clusters, these spectra were characteristic of the respective solutes, but beyond the first solvation shell ( n ≈ 12), features in the spectra from the solutes were diminished and a new feature from ionization of water emerged, analogous to bulk aqueous solutions. For large clusters with dimensions greater than 1 nanometer, the solute photoemission features disappeared and the spectra were dominated by the ionization of water as the solvent coverage increased. A smooth transition from gas-phase clusters to behavior of electrolyte solutions was clearly revealed, and the large solvated clusters can be used as molecular models to investigate the photophysics and chemistry of aqueous electrolyte solutions."
https://openalex.org/W2078859302,"Malignant transformation occurs in cells that overexpress c-Myc or that inappropriately activate E2F-1. Transformation occurs after the selection of cells that have acquired resistance to apoptosis that is triggered by these oncogenes, and a key mediator of this cell death process is the p53 tumor suppressor. In IL-3-dependent immortal 32D.3 myeloid cells the ARF/p53 apoptotic pathway is inactivated, as these cells fail to express ARF. Nonetheless, both c-Myc and E2F-1 overexpression accelerated apoptosis when these cells were deprived of IL-3. Here we report that c-Myc or E2F-1 overexpression suppresses Bcl-2 protein and RNA levels, and that restoration of Bcl-2 protein effectively blocks the accelerated apoptosis that occurs when c-Myc- or E2F-1-overexpressing cells are deprived of IL-3. Blocking p53 activity with mutant p53 did not abrogate E2F-1-induced suppression of Bcl-2. Analysis of immortal myeloid cells engineered to overexpress c-Myc and E2F-1 DNA binding mutants revealed that DNA binding activity of these oncoproteins is required to suppress Bcl-2 expression. These results suggest that the targeting of Bcl-2 family members is an important mechanism of oncogene-induced apoptosis, and that this occurs independent of the ARF/p53 pathway."

In addition, the Crx gene transfer induced the specific antigens for rod photoreceptors in the iris-derived cells, which was not seen in the adult hippocampus-derived neural stem cells. Our findings demonstrate a remarkable plasticity of adult iris tissue with potential clinical applications, as autologous iris tissue can be feasibly obtained with peripheral iridectomy."

https://openalex.org/W2048875504,"The behavior of purified potato mitochondria toward the main effectors of the animal mitochondrial permeability transition has been studied by light scattering, fluorescence, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting techniques. The addition of Ca2+ induces a phosphate-dependent swelling that is fully inhibited by cyclosporin A if dithioerythritol is present. Mg2+ cannot be substituted for Ca2+ but competes with it. Disruption of the outer membrane and release of several proteins, including cytochrome c, occur upon completion of swelling. Ca2+-induced swelling is delayed and its rate is decreased when pH is shifted from 7.4 to 6.6. It is accelerated by diamide, phenylarsine oxide, and linolenic acid. In the absence of Ca2+, however, linolenic acid (≤20 μm) rapidly dissipates the succinate-driven membrane potential while having no effect on mitochondrial volume. Anoxic conditions favor in vitro swelling and the concomitant release of cytochromec and of other proteins in a pH-dependent way. These data indicate that the classical mitochondrial permeability transition occurs also in plants. This may have important implications for our understanding of cell stress and death processes.

Haworth R.A. Southard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5069-5077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hunter D.R. Haworth R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 3Haworth R.A. Hunter D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). This mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP)1 is viewed as a multiprotein complex composed at least of the voltage-dependent anion channel, the adenine nucleotide translocator (AdNT), and cyclophilin-D, at the contact sites between outer and inner membranes (4Crompton M. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). When the pore opens, solutes up to about 1.5 kDa can pass through the inner membrane, a process known as the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Subsequently, the membrane potential (ΔΨ) decays, oxidative phosphorylation is uncoupled from electron flow, intramitochondrial ions and metabolites are released, and a large amplitude swelling can occur, disrupting the outer membrane and releasing intermembrane compounds. Although pore opening primarily requires the accumulation of Ca2+ in the mitochondrial matrix, it is also modulated by numerous factors. For instance, Pi, low ΔΨ, thiol-oxidizing reagents, low ATP level, fatty acids, anoxia, and reaeration stress all favor pore opening, whereas thiol-reducing agents, low pH, high ΔΨ, and divalent cations other than Ca2+ counteract it (5Zoratti M. Szabò I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar). Inhibition of MPT is readily achieved with submicromolar concentrations of cyclosporin A (CsA) (6Crompton M. Ellinger H. Costi A. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 357-360PubMed Google Scholar,7Broekemeier K.M.

This highly specific effect has decisively contributed to the acceptance of the pore theory (6Crompton M. Ellinger H. Costi A. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 357-360PubMed Google Scholar, 7Broekemeier K.M.

Szabò I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar). The implication of mitochondria and PTP in mammalian cell death gave a new impetus to the research. For instance, cytochrome c has been shown to be released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol (8Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R Newmeyer D.D.

How cytochromec is released into the cytosol is still unclear, but a probable way is via PTP opening and subsequent swelling and disruption of the outer membrane (4Crompton M. J.

In particular, questions remain as to the mechanism of cytochromec release into the cytosol of plant cells and how mitochondria are involved in this process. MPT might be one underlying mechanism, but to date no evidence is available for the occurrence of PTP in plants. Jones (19Jones A. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 225-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) recently discussed the possible role of mitochondria and PTP as stress sensors and dispatchers of programmed cell death in animal and plant cells. Working with pea stem mitochondria, Vianello et al. (20Vianello A. Macrı̀ F. Braidot E. Mokhova E.N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 258-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) showed that the lag phase preceding the ΔΨ collapse induced by carbonyl-cyanide-4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) or by carboxyatractylate was increased by CsA. However, their mitochondria did not exhibit high amplitude swelling, which was suggested to be an intrinsic characteristic of pea stem mitochondria (20Vianello A. Macrı̀ F. Braidot E. Mokhova E.N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 258-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This first attempt to substantiate the occurrence of MPT in plants remained thus inconclusive. Here we present evidence for the existence of MPT in plant mitochondria isolated from potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers. First, Ca2+ (but not Mg2+) induces swelling in the presence of Pi, and this process is completely inhibited by CsA if dithioerythritol is present. Second, swelling of mitochondria causes the complete disruption of the outer (but not of the inner) membrane and a subsequent release of cytochrome cand of several other polypeptides. Third, PTP opening can be delicately modulated by (bio)chemical and physiological factors such as thiol-oxidizing reagents, pH, free fatty acids, and anoxia. We conclude that MPT does occur in plant mitochondria in a very similar way as in animal mitochondria and discuss the implication of these findings for stress physiology and cell death in plants. Only young, nonsprouting potato tubers (S. tuberosum L.) were used. According to the seasonal offer, the cultivars Agria, Stella, and Charlotte were selected. Mitochondria were isolated and purified in a self-generated Percoll gradient essentially as described by Moore et al. (21Moore A.L. Fricaud A.C. Walters A.J. Whitehouse D.G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 19: 133-139PubMed Google Scholar), except that all media contained 5 mm pyruvate and 1 mm succinate. Purified mitochondria were resuspended in storage medium (200 mm sucrose, 5 mm pyruvate, 1 mmsuccinic acid, 5 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.2), kept on ice, and used within 5–6 h. It was achieved with a dye-binding microassay using the Bio-Rad Reagent (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Swelling was determined by monitoring the changes in 90° light scattering (22Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 540 nm with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 1000 spectrofluorimeter. Neutral density filters were inserted into the light pathways so as to shield the photomultiplier from any excess of scattered light. A suspension volume equivalent to 500 μg of mitochondrial protein was delivered to a stirred and thermostated cuvette (25 °C) containing air-saturated incubation medium (200 mm sucrose, 10 mm MOPS, 5 mm succinic acid, 10 μm EGTA, and, except where indicated, 2 μmrotenone, 1 μg/ml oligomycin and 1 mmH3PO4). The pH was adjusted to 7.4 (with Tris base) except where indicated (see legends to Figs. 5 and 7). The final volume was 2 ml. The signal was plotted on a chart recorder.Figure 7Effects of anoxia on Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling and protein release. Mitochondria were suspended in the same medium as in Fig. 1, except that rotenone and oligomycin were omitted. They were then preincubated under normoxic or anoxic conditions for 100 min (dotted lines). Mitochondrial swelling was induced by the addition of 2 mmCaCl2. At the end of the treatments, mitochondria were sedimented, and the supernatants were used for analysis of protein release by SDS-PAGE as in Figs. 2 and 3. A, light scattering.

Supernatants were used to determine the amount of protein released from mitochondria. They were also treated with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (10% (w/v), final concentration) and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 ×g. Precipitated proteins were taken up in a suitable volume of 1 m NaOH, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed as follows. Protein extracts (1 volume) were mixed with ¼ volume of sample buffer (60 mmTris/HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 14.4 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. SDS-PAGE was carried out with a Mini Protean II Dual Slab Cell (Bio-Rad) according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar), using precasted 10–20% linear Tris-HCl acrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). After electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 to scan the polypeptide patterns or blotted onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Immunodetection was performed as described by Arpagaus and Braendle (24Arpagaus S. Braendle R. J. Exp. Bot. 2000; 51: 1475-1477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The selectivity of the monoclonal antibody against cytochromec (clone 7H8.2C12; Pharmingen) was verified with purified horse heart cytochrome c and with total mitochondrial proteins. Pretreatment was carried out in cylindrical glass vials (50 × 14 mm) fitted with rubber septa and screw caps, in a total volume of 2 ml. Hypoxic conditions were first obtained by bubbling argon in the incubation medium. Mitochondria (500 μg of protein) were then added, and the cuvette was closed under argon. The residual O2 was consumed within 1 min, according to parallel measurements with a Clarke O2 electrode (Rank Brothers). Normoxic controls were treated similarly except that the medium was saturated with air and the cuvette was not closed. During both pretreatments, suspensions were kept under constant stirring and temperature (25 °C). All subsequent additions (from N2-saturated stock solutions) were made through the septum with a microsyringe. After completion of the treatments, the samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 18,000 × g. Pellets were delicately resuspended with a brush in storage medium and used for the measurements of membrane intactness (0.250 mg/ml protein in each case). Outer membrane intactness was determined with the method of Neuburger et al. (25Neuburger M. Journet E.P. Bligny R. Carde J.P. Douce R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 312-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), based on the impermeability of the intact outer mitochondrial membrane to exogenous cytochrome c. Inner membrane intactness was estimated from the activity levels of the matrix enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (26Bergman A. Gardeström P. Ericson I. Plant Physiol. 1980; 66: 442-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane potential was monitored with the dye safranine in the fluorometric mode (27Petrussa E. Braidot E. Nagy G. Vianello A. Macri F. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed in 2 ml of a medium made of 200 mm sucrose, 10 mmMOPS, 10 μm EGTA, 2 μm rotenone, 1 μg/ml oligomycin, and 1 mm H3PO4 (pH 7.4 with Tris base) under the same conditions and with the same equipment as for the light scattering experiments, using a dye/protein ratio of 1:20 (5 μm safranine, 100 μg/ml protein). Immediately after isolation, the Percoll-purified mitochondria isolated from Agria, Stella, and Charlotte potato tubers exhibited a high degree of intactness, with an average value of 94.3% ± 1.5 (n = 5) for their outer membrane. Mitochondria kept their volume constant for prolonged periods, as indicated by the stability of the light scattering signal in controls (Fig.1a). We could ascertain an essentially linear relationship between the swelling capacity and the intensity of the light scattering signal under our conditions, as already reported by Petronilli et al. (22Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of CaCl2 (5 mm final concentration) first induced a fast shrinkage, followed by a lag phase and a pronounced swelling (Fig. 1b). This effect was completely abolished by preliminary additions of dithioerythritol and CsA (Fig. 1c). However, neither CsA nor dithioerythritol alone could inhibit the Ca2+-induced swelling; in this case, the only effect was a slight increase of the lag phase (Fig. 1, d ande). When CaCl2 was replaced by an equal concentration of MgCl2, shrinkage still appeared, but no swelling occurred (Fig. 1f). However, at 5 mmCa2+, raising the Mg2+ level up to 20 mm increased the time required for completion of swelling in a linear fashion (10% increase per mm Mg2+;r = 0.997), while leaving unaffected both the lag phase and the swelling amplitude (not shown). No swelling could be obtained after the Ca2+ addition if Pi was omitted from the medium (Fig. 1g). According to tuber variety and physiological age, the Ca2+ concentration required to induce swelling in potato mitochondria ranged from 0.5 to 5 mm but gave similar results. Mitochondrial swelling is usually interpreted as reflecting an expansion of the matrix that may culminate in the physical rupture of the outer membrane (28Douce R. Mannella C.A. Bonner W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The amount of protein released into the medium was thus measured after the removal of mitochondria by centrifugation (Fig. 2A). In addition, SDS-PAGE was employed to visualize the polypeptide pattern of the released protein material (Fig. 2B). Control mitochondria hardly released any proteins (Fig. 2A, lane a), and all of those treatments that did not promote swelling (Fig. 1, c, f, and g) also failed to release proteins (Fig. 2A, lanes c, f, and g). Conversely, significant protein amounts (Fig. 2A, lanes b,d, and e) were found in the medium only if swelling occurred (Fig. 1, a, d, ande). Among the released proteins, and regardless of the treatments, several polypeptide bands were noticeably enriched, and a few others were either depleted or absent as compared with the pattern of total mitochondrial proteins (Fig. 2B, lane h). These differences suggest that the outer and inner membranes are not affected to the same extent by swelling. This was confirmed by determining the intactness of control mitochondria and of those having experienced Ca2+-induced swelling, which show that the outer membrane of the latter was completely disrupted (TableI). In contrast, the inner membrane still exhibited about 60% intactness (Table I), which essentially reflects the increased fragility of the inner membrane upon swelling in an Mg2+-free medium (29Douce R. Mitochondria in Higher Plants: Structure, Function, and Biogenesis. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1985: 45-153Google Scholar).Table IEffect of swelling on the intactness of outer and inner membrane of potato mitochondriaMitochondriaOuter membrane intactnessInner membrane intactness%%Control94 ± 3>98Ca2+-treated<158 ± 3Swelling was induced by 5 mm CaCl2 and monitored by light scattering as in Fig. 1, except that rotenone and oligomycin were absent from the incubation medium.

Control and Ca2+-treated mitochondria were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in storage medium. The intactness of the outer and inner membranes was assayed according to Neuburger et al. (25Neuburger M. Journet E.P. Bligny R. Carde J.P. Douce R. Arch. Biochem.

Plant Physiol. 1980; 66: 442-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Data represent the mean ± S.D. of four independent measurements. Interestingly, the patterns of released proteins (Fig. 2B,lanes b, d, and e) show the presence of a polypeptide with an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of cytochrome c (Fig. 2B, lane i) and which was absent in the patterns from nonswollen samples (Fig. 2B, lanes c,f, and g). A Western blot analysis showed that cytochrome c was effectively released from potato mitochondria and that this release was strictly dependent on Ca2+-induced swelling (Fig.3, compare b and dwith a, e, and f). Moreover, inhibition of swelling by the couple dithioerythritol plus CsA abolished cytochrome c release (Fig. 3c). The redox state of mitochondrial sulfhydryl groups was modulated by a pretreatment of organelles during 1 min either with 1,1′-azo-bis-N,N-dimethylformamide (diamide), which oxidizes thiols to disulfides or with phenylarsine oxide, which bridges two thiol groups (Fig. 4). A subsequent addition of Ca2+ led to a dramatic decrease of the lag phase preceding swelling and to a faster swelling rate, as compared with the control. In addition, on a molar basis, phenylarsine oxide (Fig. 4c) was more efficient than diamide (Fig.4b). Next, the pH dependence of the Ca2+-induced swelling was studied over a physiologically relevant range of pH values (Fig.5). Since it was rapidly apparent that the time required for completion of swelling (see inset of Fig. 5) could vary between different mitochondria preparations assayed under the standard pH 7.4 condition, this time was always taken as 100%, and the other time values were expressed as percentages of this standard time before being plotted against pH. We have compared the Ca2+-induced swelling in two different mitochondria preparations exhibiting extreme values (6.6 and 21.6 min) of this standard time. The two curves were remarkably similar, indicating that they reflect a mechanism that depends on the pH but not on the standard time value. The time required for completion of swelling was 3.5–4-fold longer at pH 6.6 than at 7.6 (Fig. 5). In any case, the two components of the light scattering response displayed a high degree of sensitivity to [H+]; the lag phase was prolonged, and the swelling rate diminished when pH decreased (not shown). It is worth mentioning that within this narrow pH range, swelling was never completely inhibited, even at low pH values; rather, its expression was considerably slowed down with time. Fatty acids are commonly used to alter the structural and bioenergetic properties of mitochondrial membranes. In a first set of experiments, the amplitude of ΔΨ in energized mitochondria was monitored by measuring the change in the safranine fluorescence signal upon a 5-min treatment with linolenic acid (Fig. 6,solid lines). In a second set of experiments with the same mitochondria preparation (but in the absence of safranine), the same fatty acid treatment was applied, but then CaCl2was added to induce swelling, which was monitored by light scattering (Fig. 6, dashed lines). Since mitochondria were isolated in the presence of pyruvate and succinate as stabilizing agents, they could obviously sustain an already large ΔΨ. The addition of succinate thus had only a slight effect and was primarily aimed at developing a maximal ΔΨ that could remain stable during the whole treatment (Fig. 6a). The addition of increasing amounts of linolenic acid (5, 10, and 20 μm) progressively decreased ΔΨ, both in rate and amplitude (Fig. 6,b and c) and eventually collapsed it (Fig.6d). At this point, the complete collapse of ΔΨ was ascertained by the signal insensitivity to the addition of 1 μm FCCP (not shown). The mitochondrial volume remained unaffected during the pretreatment period with linolenic acid. However, striking differences could be observed upon Ca2+ addition (Fig. 6, a–d). Compared with the control (Fig.6a), the lag phase already decreased after pretreatment with 5 μm linolenic acid (Fig. 6b) and completely disappeared at higher concentrations (Fig. 6, c andd). Simultaneously, the swelling rate was noticeably enhanced with increasing fatty acid concentrations (Fig. 6, comparea with b–d). Separate control experiments in the absence of mitochondria have ascertained that no sizable light scattering signal was generated under our conditions when CaCl2 was added to the buffered medium containing linolenic acid. When dithioerythritol and CsA were supplied before the pretreatment with 10 μm linolenic acid, swelling was completely inhibited, whereas depolarization was hardly affected (Fig.6e). On the other hand, the addition of dithioerythritol alone before fatty acid pretreatment could not prevent swelling, while again having no effect on ΔΨ decay (Fig. 6f). Incubation under anoxia is another way to modulate the metabolic status of mitochondria, which will thus experience conditions that are as close as possible to those encountered for example in underground organs of flooded plants or in ischemic animal tissues. However, an important preliminary issue was to know whether an appreciable ΔΨ still existed across the inner mitochondrial membrane under anoxia, as already shown for instance in hepatocytes and endothelial cells (30Andersson B.S. Aw T.Y. Jones D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: C349-C355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Fuji Y. Johnson M.E. Gores G.J. Hepatology. 1994; 20: 177-185PubMed Google Scholar, 32Nomura Y. Miyao T. Tamura M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 388: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). When potato mitochondria were incubated under anoxia in the presence of safranine, its fluorescence signal persisted for more than 120 min at its maximum level (= 100%) if bovine serum albumin (3.6 μm) was present. Without bovine serum albumin, the safranine fluorescence signal decreased over ∼10 min and then tended to stabilize at an intermediary value (∼40%) for a long period too. In both cases, these signals were rapidly and fully abolished by FCCP (data not shown). These results suggest that a sizable ΔΨ could be maintained for the long term in potato mitochondria when the electron transport chain was inactive. After an anoxic pretreatment of about 100 min at pH 7.4, the lag phase between Ca2+ addition and the onset of swelling decreased by about 40%, and the swelling rate almost doubled (compare traces a and b in Fig. 7A). Preincubations of 10 min or more under both normoxia and anoxia were required to observe a clear difference in swelling kinetics between these two conditions. The addition of dithioerythritol and CsA shortly before Ca2+again inhibited swelling (Fig. 7A, trace c), although with a slightly lessened efficiency that is attributable to anoxia itself rather than to the long preincubation period under this condition (compare also lanes band c in Fig. 7B). It is also known that anoxia shifts the cytoplasmic pH of plant cells from about 7.5 under normoxia to as low as 6.2 under anoxia (33Xia J.H. Roberts J.K.M. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). When the anoxia treatment was carried out at pH 6.6 (rather than 7.4), swelling did not occur after the addition of Ca2+ (Fig. 7A, lane d), again suggesting that protons are implicated in counteracting the Ca2+-induced swelling process. SDS-PAGE analysis of mitochondrial supernatants showed that protein release was important when swelling occurred (Fig. 7B, lanes d and e) but was much smaller in its absence (Fig. 7B, lanes a, b,c, f, and g). The electrophoretic patterns of the material released under normoxia (Fig. 7B,lane d) and anoxia (Fig. 7B,lane e) were remarkably similar. In particular, cytochrome c was among the polypeptides released upon swelling (Fig. 7C, lanes d ande). This suggests that swelling of normoxic and anoxic mitochondria stem from a common mechanism. However, at pH 7.4 but in the absence of Ca2+, the anoxia pretreatment alone was not sufficient, even after 100 min or more, to promote swelling (not shown) as well as protein (Fig. 7B, lane c) and cytochrome c (Fig. 7C, lane c) release. This emphasizes once again the central role of Ca2+ in these processes. The first tenet of animal MPT is its requirement for Ca2+ accumulation in the mito"

On the terrestrial planets, central peaks consist of fractured but competent rock uplifted during cratering. Therefore, the observation of central peaks on Europa indicates that an ice layer must be sufficiently thick that the impact events did not completely penetrate it. We conducted numerical simulations of vapor and melt production during cratering of water ice layers overlying liquid water to estimate the thickness of Europa's icy crust. Because impacts disrupt material well beyond the zone of partial melting, our simulations put a lower limit on ice thickness at the locations and times of impact. We conclude that the ice must be more than 3 to 4 kilometers thick."

The SMN protein self-associates independently through regions encoded by exons 2b and 6, and the ability to homodimerize correlates with disease severity (14Young P.J. Man N.T. Lorson C.L. Le T.T.

The primary product of SMN2, SMNΔ7, lacks exon 7, and the resultant protein has a reduced ability to self-associate, accounting for the inability of SMN2 to compensate for the loss ofSMN1 (15Lorson C.L.

Under normal physiological conditions, p53 protein levels are maintained at relatively low levels through a negative feedback loop mediated by HDM2 (23Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar, 24Lain S. Midgley C. Sparks A. Lane E.B. Lane D.P. Exp.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5690-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). HDM2 inhibits p53 transcriptional activity by binding to the p53 transactivation domain and also targets p53 for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (26Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2839) Google Scholar, 27Lane D.P. Hall P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 372-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the developing nervous system, p53 performs a critical role by regulating neuronal apoptotic death (28Eizenberg O. Faber-Elman A. Gottlieb E. Oren M. Rotter V. Schwartz M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5178-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We now show that SMN interacts directly with p53 and that the region encoded by SMN exon 2 mediates the SMN-p53 association. SMN single amino acid substitution mutations that cause SMA inhibited SMN-p53 complex formation. The degree of inhibition correlated with the effects of each mutation on SMN dimerization and SMA disease severity. Following endogenous p53 activation, SMN and p53 accumulated in Cajal bodies. In contrast, in SMA patient-derived fibroblasts with very low SMN protein levels, p53 was localized within the nucleolus and not in Cajal bodies. Increased availability of pro-apoptotic p53 when SMN levels are very low suggests itself as a possible mechanism for loss of motor neurons in SMA. Wild-type SMN, SMN isoform lacking exon 7 (SMNΔ7), point mutated SMN, and SMN exon subconstructs were cloned into the glutathione S-transferase (GST) expression vector pGEX3X (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). p53 cDNA was cloned in to the pRSET-C vector (Invitrogen). Transformed bacteria were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-thio-β-d-thiogalaactoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Expressed recombinant proteins were purified from inclusion bodies by sequential extraction with increasing urea concentrations (2, 4, 6, and 8 m) in phosphate-buffered saline as previously described (29Young P.J. Le T.T. thi Man N. Burghes A.H. Morris G.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Cellular extracts from ∼1 × 105 U2OS cells (human osteosarcoma cells: ATCC HTB96) transiently transfected with 2 μg of pCI:HA-SMN by LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent (Invitrogen) were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5). Anti-p53 antibody (monoclonal DO1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) or anti-SMN antibody (MANSMA1) was used to identify p53 or SMN (respectively) by chemiluminescence (Pierce). When indicated, the cells were treated with 10 nm ALLN for 6 h, 10 mm cycloheximide for 4 h, 10 mm leptomycin B for 6 h, or 10 mJ/cm2 4 h prior to harvesting cellular extracts. LMB binds directly to CRM1 and results in nuclear accumulation of p53 (30Lain S. Xirodimas D. Lane D.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the ALLN peptide inhibits caspase-mediated p53 degradation, whereas cycloheximide and UV treatment stimulates p53 gene expression. The BIAcore biosensor detects changes in total mass at the surface of a sensor chip by measuring variations of the critical angle needed to produce total internal refraction. The change in critical angle is proportional to the amount of bound protein and is expressed as resonance units. In Fig. 1C, the shift in resonance units, or response, is plotted against time and is displayed as a sensorgram. Injected samples contain protein, urea, imidazole, and HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) and therefore are denser than HBS running buffer. This increase in medium density during protein injections produces the large vertical spikes seen on the sensorgram (the initial vertical line indicates the start of an injection, and the second vertical line indicates the end of an injection). The amount of bound protein following an injection is indicated by the increase in the horizontal base line. A Cm5 sensor chip was covalently linked with rabbit anti-mouse IgG by the amino-coupling protocol according to the manufacturer's instructions (BIAcore AB, Stevenage, UK). A BIAcore-X apparatus was used with an operating flow rate of 5 μl/min. All injected volumes were 5 μl. Concentrations of stock recombinant proteins were determined for each reaction prior to injection. The proteins were diluted in HBS to 10 μg/ml unless otherwise stated. To construct the monomer SMN chip, SMN was bound directly to a Cm5 chip (14Young P.J. Man N.T. Lorson C.L. Le T.T. Androphy E.J. Burghes A.H. Morris G.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2869-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Stock SMN solutions in 8 m urea, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol were subjected to gel filtration on a calibrated Sephadex G-15 column in coupling buffer to remove all traces of urea and 2-mercaptoethanol in preparation for amino coupling to the chip. SMN eluted in the excluded volume was coupled immediately to the chip. After coupling, the chip was pulsed with HBS containing 0.1% SDS followed by 10 mm HCl, 8 m urea to remove all noncovalently bound protein and leave monomeric SMN on the chip. Successful coupling was confirmed by binding of previously described SMN-specific mouse monoclonal antibodies, MANSMA1–3 (29Young P.J. Le T.T. thi Man N. Burghes A.H. Morris G.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). For all BIA experiments control proteins, emerin and neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP), that do not interact with SMN were used to determine the background binding values. All of the reactions were performed at least in triplicate, and the plotted values represent the means from the individual experiments. All recombinant proteins used were exposed to a Cm5 chip with no coupled protein to ensure that nonspecific interactions were not occurring on the chip matrix. All stepwise binding reactions were repeated in the absence of each protein, i.e. for the SMN-WT/p53 binding study the primary run lacked MANSMA1 to ensure that the Cm5 rabbit-anti-Mouse IgG chip did not capture SMN or p53. The secondary run lacked SMN-WT, thus demonstrating MANSMA1 did not capture p53. Once these controls were performed and nonspecific interactions were eliminated, the actual experiment was performed, with stepwise injections of MANSMA1, SMN-WT, and p53. Subconfluent U2OS and skin fibroblast cell lines were plated and treated with ALLN, LMB, cycloheximide, or UV light as described above. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 1 min with 50% acetone, 50% methanol, and then washed an additional three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then analyzed by double-label immunofluorescence (29Young P.J. Le T.T. thi Man N. Burghes A.H. Morris G.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 31Young P.J. Le T.T. Dunckley M. thi Man N. Burghes A.H. Morris G.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Images were captured using TRITC and fluorescein isothiocyanate filter sets and a 100× oil immersion objective in conjunction with the Leica TCS-NT confocal microscope. GST and His6 binding resins (Novagen) were washed three times in binding buffer (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40) and incubated with recombinant protein diluted to 100 μg/ml in binding buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed three times with binding buffer and incubated with the respective binding protein diluted to 100 μg/ml in binding buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. Resin was washed three times with binding buffer, and the bound fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining. SMN can function as an anti-apoptotic factor, although its mode of action is unclear. Because the tumor suppressor p53 protein performs a critical role in monitoring neuronal apoptosis of the developing and mature nervous system, we examined whether SMN was involved in a p53 pathway. To determine whether SMN and p53 interact in vivo, the cells were transfected with a HA epitope-tagged SMN and treated with ALLN. ALLN prevents p53 degradation by inhibiting calpain activity and has been used to study endogenous p53 localization patterns (30Lain S. Xirodimas D. Lane D.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation reactions were performed with anti-p53 monoclonal antibody. In extracts of U2OS cells treated with ALLN, p53 co-precipitated with HA-tagged SMN (Fig.1A, left panel). In contrast, SMN was not immunoprecipitated from untreated extracts (Fig.1A, right panel). A direct interaction between SMN and p53 in vitro was shown using recombinant SMN and p53 proteins (Fig. 1B). BIA was used to confirm the specificity of the SMN/p53 interaction. SMN captured on a sensor chip bound high levels of p53 while failing to interact with control proteins, emerin and NAIP (Fig. 1C). Using BIA, the p53-SMN complex was also detected in cellular extracts from cells pretreated with ALLN peptide (Fig. 1D). Endogenous p53 and its complexes were captured on a sensor chip using an anti-p53 monoclonal antibody, and an anti-SMN polyclonal antibody was used to detect complexed SMN. Extracts from untreated cells contained little p53, whereas ALLN-treatment resulted in an 8–10-fold increase in p53 levels (Fig. 1D). p53 complexes captured from ALLN-treated extracts contained SMN (Fig. 1D), but SMN was not detected in untreated control extracts (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with three other treatments that raise p53 levels: LMB, which binds directly to CRM1 and results in nuclear accumulation of p53 (30Lain S. Xirodimas D. Lane D.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); cycloheximide; or UV light (data not shown). To identify the domain(s) of SMN that mediated SMN-p53 complex formation, in vitro binding experiments were performed using recombinant His6-tagged p53 protein and SMN subdomains (peptides encoded by exons 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7) expressed as GST fusion proteins. The domain encoded by SMN exon 2 was necessary and sufficient to bind to p53 (Fig. 2A,left panel). Similarly, hexahistidine-tagged p53 (His6-p53) captured on agarose-linked nickel beads precipitated SMN fragments containing exon 2-encoded sequence but failed to associate with a fragment encoded by exons 4–7 (Fig.2A, right panel). Quantitative BIA studies showed that SMN-exon 2 was sufficient to mediate the p53 interaction and that use of full-length SMN and larger SMN peptides (SMN exons 1–2 and 1–4) did not enhance p53 binding (Fig. 2B). Under increasing NaCl concentrations, full-length SMN protein (SMN-WT), SMN exons 1–2, exons 1–4, and SMN exon 2 displayed similar binding capacities for p53 (Fig. 2C). To determine whether disease-causing SMN mutations disrupt the SMN-p53 complex, three patient-derived SMN mutations consisting of individual single amino acid substitutions (Y272G, T274I, and G279V) were assayed for their ability to interact with p53. Additionally, we assessed the ability of SMNΔ7 to interact with p53. SMNΔ7 is the primary product of SMN2 and is present in SMA patients. Compared with SMN-WT, the SMN missense mutations and SMNΔ7 displayed a dramatically reduced ability to bind p53 (Fig.3A). The decrease in p53 binding correlates with disease severity; mutations 262 and 279 are isolated from severe type I SMA and have the greatest impact on p53 binding, whereas mutation 274 was isolated from a less severe patient and has an intermediate capacity to bind p53 (Fig. 3A). The missense mutations and SMNΔ7 disrupt SMN dimerization to an extent that parallels p53 binding and disease severity (Fig.3B). Functional SMN exists in at least a dimeric state, and the ability to self-associate correlates with disease severity (14Young P.J. Man N.T. Lorson C.L. Le T.T. Androphy E.J. Burghes A.H. Morris G.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2869-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Lorson C.L. Strasswimmer J. Yao J.M. Baleja J.D. Hahnen E. Wirth B. Le T. Burghes A.H. Androphy E.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Consistent with the requirement for self-association, monomeric SMN failed to associate with p53 (Fig. 3C). The monomeric state of the SMN captured on the sensor chip was confirmed by reprobing with wild-type SMN protein as previously described (Fig. 3C) (14Young P.J. Man N.T. Lorson C.L. Le T.T. Androphy E.J. Burghes A.H. Morris G.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2869-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Following dimerization of SMN on the sensor chip, p53 binding was increased ∼6-fold compared with p53 binding by monomeric SMN (Fig.3C). Nuclear SMN is enriched in Cajal bodies and within the nucleolus (5Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3555-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 29Young P.J. Le T.T. thi Man N.

A. 1998; 95: 6492-6497Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although total SMN protein levels and SMN-positive Cajal body numbers correlate with disease severity, a connection to motor neuron loss has not been established (33Coovert D.D. Le T.T. McAndrew P.E. Strasswimmer J. Crawford T.O. Mendell J.R. Coulson S.E. Androphy E.J. Prior T.W. Burghes A.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Recently it has been reported that following treatment with ALLN or LMB, p53 accumulates in nuclear structures consistent with Cajal bodies (24Lain S. Midgley C. Sparks A. Lane E.B. Lane D.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 457-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar,34Nevels M. Tauber B. Kremmer E. Spruss T. Wolf H. Dobner T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether these structures are Cajal bodies, double label immunolocalization was performed on untreated, UV-, cycloheximide-, ALLN-, and LMB-treated U2OS cells (Fig.4). In control cells, a typical SMN distribution was observed, with diffuse cytoplasmic staining and nuclear SMN accumulating in both Cajal bodies and the nucleolus (Fig.4). Low levels of diffuse nuclear p53 were detected. However, SMN and p53 did not co-localize (Fig. 4). In contrast, following treatment of U2OS cells with the p53-inducing stimuli, p53 accumulated in SMN-positive bodies. The four treatments did not visibly alter either the cytoplasmic or nuclear distribution of SMN. The p53-SMN-positive structures also contained p80 coilin, confirming that these structures are Cajal bodies (data not shown). Following activation or stabilization of p53 by agents such as ALLN or LMB, p53 has been shown to partially localize within PML bodies (30Lain S. Xirodimas D. Lane D.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 35Gottifredi V. Prives C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 184-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To determine the relationship between Cajal bodies and PML bodies, immunolocalization was performed on U2OS cells using antibodies against SMN and PML. As expected, there were significantly more PML bodies than Cajal bodies as indicated by the presence of PML compared with SMN-positive foci (Fig. 5). There was, however, a small subset of PML-positive nuclear bodies that also contained SMN, demonstrating that a fraction of Cajal bodies are coincident with PML bodies in untreated U20S cells. Double label immunolocalization was performed on human cultured skin fibroblasts from an unaffected carrier (control) and a type I SMA individual (33Coovert D.D. Le T.T. McAndrew P.E. Strasswimmer J. Crawford T.O. Mendell J.R. Coulson S.E. Androphy E.J. Prior T.W. Burghes A.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). In untreated control fibroblasts, diffuse p53 staining within the nucleus was present, whereas SMN was detectable in discrete nuclear bodies. Following ALLN treatment, p53 co-localized in SMN-positive nuclear bodies (Fig.6), consistent with the distribution patterns observed in U2OS cells. In SMA fibroblasts, endogenous SMN levels were dramatically reduced and SMN-positive nuclear bodies were not detected (Fig. 6). In contrast to carrier fibroblasts, following treatment with ALLN peptide, p53 accumulated primarily in the nucleolus and not in nuclear bodies (Fig.6) Nucleolar localization was confirmed by viewing the cells under phase contrast and with an anti-nucleolin monoclonal antibody (data not shown). We have shown that SMN directly associates with p53 in vivo and in vitro through a series of immunoprecipitations, in vitro bindings, and BIA experiments. The SMN/p53 interaction is mediated through the region encoded by SMN exon 2. Several lines of evidence suggest that the SMN/p53 interaction is functionally significant: 1) SMN mutations isolated from SMA patients disrupt p53 binding in a manner that reflects the severity of disease, and a functional SMN oligomer is essential for the p53 interaction. 2) SMN exon 2 is highly conserved through numerous divergent organisms (36Bertrandy S. Burlet P. Clermont O. Huber C. Fondrat C. Thierry-Mieg D. Munnich A. Lefebvre S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 3) SMN prevents neuronal apoptosis in vivo and in vitro (8Kerr D.A. Nery J.P. Traystman R.J. Chau B.N. Hardwick J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13312-13317Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism behind this protection is unclear. Interestingly, the C-terminal deletions or the missense mutations that inhibited SMN-mediated anti-apoptotic activity also inhibited the ability of SMN to interact with p53. Mutations that disrupt self-association also disrupt SMN functional interactions, including self-association (14Young P.J. Man N.T. Lorson C.L. Le T.T. Androphy E.J. Burghes A.H. Morris G.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2869-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In this study we show that SMN C-terminal mutations prevent binding to p53. SMNΔ7 and the C-terminal point mutations (Y272C, T274I, and G279V) likely destabilize SMN exon 6-mediated dimerization, resulting in reduced SMN self-association even when an intact SMN exon 2 dimerization domain is present in cis. Self-association through the SMN exon 6 domain is significantly stronger than self-association mediated by the SMN exon 2b domain and likely functions as an initial anchor that facilitates additional SMN intra- and inter-molecular interactions (14Young P.J. Man N.T. Lorson C.L. Le T.T. Androphy E.J. Burghes A.H. Morris G.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2869-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, the inability of the C-terminal mutants to bind p53 suggests that the exon 2b interaction is also destabilized. However, the inability of the mutant proteins to associate with p53 is likely not due to gross protein defects, because these mutant proteins retain nearly all of their biochemical properties, although at reduced levels. p53 accumulates in PML nuclear bodies following the inhibition of p53 degradation and by blocking CRM1-mediated p53 translocation (24Lain S. Midgley C. Sparks A. Lane E.B. Lane D.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 457-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These bodies also contained Sm core proteins and U1 snRNP auxillary factor (U1A) (24Lain S. Midgley C. Sparks A. Lane E.B. Lane D.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 457-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). An average mammalian cell contains 10–20 PML bodies, and these bodies dissociate in cells from human acute promyelocytic leukemia patients (6Matera A.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 302-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 37Lamond A.I. Earnshaw W.C. Science. 1998; 280: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). In a broad number of cell lines and in differentiated adult mammalian tissue, SMN and p80 coilin co-localize in another class of nuclear bodies termed Cajal bodies (31Young P.J. Le T.T. Dunckley M. thi Man N. Burghes A.H. Morris G.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 38Carvalho T. Almeida F. Calapez A. Lafarga M. Berciano M.T. Carmo-Fonseca M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 715-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that following activation of p53 by ALLN, cycloheximide, or ultraviolet light treatment, p53 co-localized with SMN and p80 coilin in Cajal bodies. Additionally, a small subset of Cajal bodies spatially co-localized with PML bodies. Although Cajal bodies and PML bodies have been reported as exclusively independent structures (6Matera A.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 302-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), several lines of evidence show that nuclear bodies and their components are highly dynamic (29Young P.J.

Sleeman J. Lamond A.I. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Furthermore, spatial distribution and localization of nuclear bodies are transitory and can be altered under specific physiological conditions (39Lyon C.E. Bohmann K. Sleeman J. Lamond A.I. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The interaction between p53 and SMN suggests that the two proteins have an associated function. However, to date p53 has no role in RNA processing. SMN has been shown to have a role in the induction of apoptosis; however, the mechanism of apoptotic regulation is unclear (8Kerr D.A. Nery J.P.

Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1997; 390: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The lower levels of SMN in SMA patient-derived fibroblasts paralleled the nucleolar localization of p53 in patient fibroblasts, suggesting that high levels of SMN are required either directly or indirectly for p53 localization within nuclear bodies. This could be a mechanism for regulating p53 function, potentially by physical sequestration of p53 in a cellular compartment that inhibits p53 function. Nucleolar accumulation of p53 has recently been shown (41Rubbi C.P. Milner J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 42Mattsson K. Pokrovskaja K. Kiss C. Klein G. Szekely L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1012-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). SMN can also accumulate within the nucleolus of adult neuronal cells and all fetal cell types (31Young P.J. Le T.T. Dunckley M. thi Man N. Burghes A.H. Morris G.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 32Francis J.W. Sandrock A.W. Bhide P.G. Vonsattel J.P. Brown Jr., R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6492-6497Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). ZPR1 facilitates SMN localization within Cajal bodies; however, it is unclear whether ZPR1 is required for the structural maintenance of Cajal bodies (43Gangwani L. Mikrut M. Theroux S. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The exact nature of the motor neuron-specific defect associated with SMA is not known. Interestingly, SMN can function as an anti-apoptotic factor in neuronal cells and has been reported to functionally interact with the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 in a tissue culture model (8Kerr D.A. Nery J.P. Traystman R.J. Chau B.N. Hardwick J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13312-13317Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 40Iwahashi H. Eguchi Y. Yasuhara N. Hanafusa T. Matsuzawa Y. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1997; 390: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In contrast, C-terminal deletions and missense mutations converted SMN to a pro-apoptotic factor (8Kerr D.A. Nery J.P. Traystman R.J. Chau B.N. Hardwick J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13312-13317Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). An anti-apoptotic function of SMN may be significant, with regards to disease, because surviving motor neurons from SMA patients display signs of apoptosis, such as chromatolysis and swelling (44Broccolini A. Engel W.K. Askanas V. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 1637-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 45Simic G. Seso-Simic D. Lucassen P.J. Islam A. Krsnik Z. Cviko A. Jelasic D. Barisic N. Winblad B. Kostovic I. Kruslin B. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 59: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although a role for p53 has not been established in these activities, our results are consistent with a model in which wild-type SMN prevents p53-mediated apoptosis. In the disease state, SMNΔ7 or missense mutations fail to associate with p53, allowing activation of p53-dependent apoptotic pathways. p53 can stimulate apoptosis through multiple mechanisms, including pathways that are dependent and independent of p53-transcriptional activation (21Vousden K.H. Cell. 2000; 103: 691-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Current studies are underway to determine what role SMN plays in p53-dependent apoptotic pathways and to determine the relevance to motor neuron death observed in SMA. We thank J. T. Schiller and A.

https://openalex.org/W2151881633,"The integrin linked kinase (ILK) is a cytoplasmic effector of integrin receptors, involved in the regulation of integrin binding properties as well as the activation of cell survival and proliferative pathways, including those involving MAP kinase, PKB/Akt and GSK-3beta. Overexpression of ILK in cultured intestinal and mammary epithelial cells has been previously shown to induce changes characteristic of oncogenic transformation, including anchorage-independent growth, invasiveness, suppression of anoikis and tumorigenicity in nude mice. In order to determine if ILK overexpression can result in the formation of mammary tumors in vivo, we generated transgenic mice expressing ILK in the mammary epithelium, under the transcriptional control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) long terminal repeat (LTR). By the age of 6 months, female MMTV/ILK mice developed a hyperplastic mammary phenotype, which was accompanied by the constitutive phosphorylation of PKB/Akt, GSK-3beta and MAP kinase. Focal mammary tumors subsequently appeared in 34% of the animals at an average age of 18 months. Given the focal nature and long latency of the tumors, however, additional genetic events are likely required for tumor induction in the MMTV/ILK mice. These results provide the first direct demonstration of a potential oncogenic role for ILK, which is upregulated in human tumors and tumor cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2043923025,"Transcriptional coactivators either bridge transcription factors and the components of the basal transcription apparatus and/or remodel the chromatin structures. We isolated a novel nuclear protein based on its interaction with the recently described general coactivator activating signal cointegrator-2 (ASC-2). This protein CAPER (for coactivator of activating protein-1 (AP-1) and estrogen receptors (ERs)) selectively bound, among the many transcription factors we tested, the AP-1 component c-Jun and the estradiol-bound ligand binding domains of ERα and ERβ. Interestingly, CAPER exhibited a cryptic autonomous transactivation function that becomes activated only in the presence of estradiol-bound ER. In cotransfections, CAPER stimulated transactivation by ERα, ERβ, and AP-1. Thus, CAPER may represent a more selective transcriptional coactivator molecule that plays a pivotal role for the function of AP-1 and ERs in vivo in conjunction with the general coactivator ASC-2.

Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Google Scholar). The AP-1 complex consists of a heterodimer of a Fos family member and a Jun family member. This complex binds the consensus DNA sequence (TGAGTCA) (termed AP-1 sites) found in a variety of promoters. The Fos family contains four proteins (c-Fos, Fos-B, Fra-1, and Fra-2), whereas the Jun family is composed of three proteins (c-Jun, Jun-B, and Jun-D). Fos and Jun are members of the basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) family of sequence-specific dimeric DNA-binding proteins (1Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of the bZIP domain is amphipathic, containing a heptad repeat of leucines that is critical for the dimerization of bZIP proteins, whereas the N-terminal half of the long bipartite helix is the basic region that is responsible for the sequence-specific DNA binding. The nuclear receptor superfamily is a group of ligand-dependent transcriptional regulatory proteins that function by binding to specific DNA sequences named hormone-response elements in the promoters of target genes (reviewed in Ref. 2Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Google Scholar). The superfamily includes receptors for a variety of small hydrophobic ligands such as steroids, triiodothyronine, and retinoids as well as a large number of related proteins that do not have known ligands, referred to as orphan nuclear receptors. The C terminus of the ligand binding domain of these proteins harbors an essential ligand-dependent transactivation function, activation function 2 (AF2), whereas the N terminus of many nuclear receptors often includes AF1. Genetic studies implicated that transcription coregulators (or cofactors) with no specific DNA binding activity are essential components of transcriptional regulation, which ultimately led us to identify a series of coregulatory proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 3McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Google Scholarand 4Lee J.W. Lee Y.C. Na S.Y. Jung D.J. Lee S.K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 289-297Google Scholar). They appear to function by either remodeling chromatin structures and/or acting as adapter molecules between transcription factors and the components of the basal transcriptional apparatus. These proteins include the steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) family, CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300, activating signal cointegrator-2 (ASC-2), and many others (3McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Google Scholar, 4Lee J.W. Lee Y.C. Na S.Y. Jung D.J. Lee S.K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 289-297Google Scholar). SRC-1 and its homologue ACTR, along with CBP and p300, were recently shown to contain histone acetyltransferase activities and associate with yet another histone acetyltransferase protein P/CAF (3McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Google Scholar, 4Lee J.W. Lee Y.C. Na S.Y. Jung D.J. Lee S.K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 289-297Google Scholar). Interestingly, unliganded retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and thyroid hormone receptor (TR) bind to their target genes and repress transcription. “The silencing mediators of RAR and TR” and “nuclear receptor corepressors” are known to mediate this repression (3McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Google Scholar, 4Lee J.W. Lee Y.C. Na S.Y. Jung D.J. Lee S.K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 289-297Google Scholar). Interestingly, the silencing mediators of RAR and TR and nuclear receptor corepressors appear to interact with the estrogen receptor (ER) and the progesterone receptor only in the presence of their respective antagonists (5Xu J. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12195-12199Google Scholar, 6Jackson T.A. Richer J.K. Bain D.L. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Horwitz K.B. Mol.

These proteins harbor transferable repression domains that associate with various histone deacetylases. These results are consistent with the notion that acetylation of histones destabilizes nucleosomes and relieves transcriptional repression by allowing transcription factors access to recognition elements, whereas deacetylation of the histones stabilizes the repressed state (3McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Google Scholar, 4Lee J.W. Lee Y.C. Na S.Y. Jung D.J. Lee S.K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 289-297Google Scholar). It is important to note that many of these coregulatory proteins have shown a very broad spectrum of action with many different nuclear receptors and transcription factors, including AP-1 (3McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Google Scholar, 4Lee J.W. Lee Y.C. Na S.Y. Jung D.J. Lee S.K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 289-297Google Scholar). More recently, however, a series of more target-selective coactivators have been isolated. These include peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) coactivator-1 (PGC-1) (9Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Google Scholar), the human homologue of the yeast DNA repair and TFIIH regulator MMS19 (10Wu X. Li H. Chen J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23962-23968Google Scholar) and p68 RNA helicase (11Endoh H. Maruyama K. Masuhiro Y. Kobayashi Y. Goto M. Tai H. Yanagisawa J. Metzger D. Hashimoto S. Kato S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5363-5372Google Scholar), both of which were shown to be AF1-specific coactivators of ERα, and prothymosin α, which selectively enhances ER activity by interfering with “the repressor of ER” activity (12Martini P.G. Delage-Mourroux R. Kraichely D.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6224-6232Google Scholar, 13Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage-Mourroux R. Chang W. Martini P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6947-6952Google Scholar). In addition, ARA160 was recently reported as the first androgen receptor N-terminal-associated coactivator in human prostate cancer cells (14Hsiao P.W. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22373-22379Google Scholar), and a neuronal-specific corepressor “neuronal interacting factor X 1” was shown to repress transactivation by a subset of nuclear receptors (15Greiner E.F. Kirfel J. Greschik H. Huang D. Becker P. Kapfhammer J.P. Schule R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7160-7165Google Scholar). Interestingly, Smad3 specifically represses transcriptional activation mediated by androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells (16Hayes S.A. Zarnegar M. Sharma M. Yang F. Peehl D.M. ten Dijke P. Sun Z. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2112-2118Google Scholar) while acting as a coactivator specific for ligand-induced transactivation of vitamin D receptor by forming a complex with a member of the SRC-1 family in the nucleus (17Yanagisawa J. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Suzawa M. Watanabe M. Kashiwagi K. Toriyabe T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato S. Science. 1999; 283: 1317-1321Google Scholar). ARA70 has also been shown to stimulate selectively PPARγ and androgen receptor (18Heinlein C.A. Ting H.J. Yeh S. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16147-16152Google Scholar). Finally, JAB1, interacting with c-Jun and JunD but not with JunB or v-Jun, is known to selectively potentiate transactivation by c-Jun or JunD (19Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of a nuclear protein, which was originally isolated as a novel autoantigen from a patient with liver cirrhosis who progressed to hepatocarcinoma (20Imai H. Chan E.K. Kiyosawa K. Fu X.D. Tan E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2419-2426Google Scholar). Our results show that this protein functions as a specific transcriptional coactivator of AP-1, ERα and ERβ. HCC1.4 and HCC1.3 (20Imai H. Chan E.K. Kiyosawa K. Fu X.D. Tan E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2419-2426Google Scholar) were kind gifts from Dr. Eng M. Tan at University of California, San Diego. Polymerase chain reaction fragments encoding CAPER (for coactivator of AP-1 and ERs), CAPER-N, -MI, -MII, -C, -ΔC1, -ΔC2, -ΔN1, -ΔN2, -MII-1, -MII-2, -ASC2-4Δ1, -ASC2-4Δ2, and -ASC2-4Δ3 were constructed intoEcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of the LexA fusion vector pEG202PL, the B42 fusion vector pJG4-5, the mammalian two-hybrid vector pCMX/Gal4 and pCMX/VP16, the mammalian expression/in vitro translation vector pcDNA3, and the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vector pGEX4T-1. Similarly, PCR fragments encoding ERα-ABC, -ABCD, -EF, -D, and -DE were cloned into EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of pJG4-5. Gal4 fusions to ERα and ERβ, LexA fusions to ERαΔAF2, ASC2-4, ASC2-4a, ASC2-4b, and ASC2-4LR, B42 fusions to ERα, ERβ, c-Jun, c-Fos, JunΔ1, JunΔ2, JunΔ3, FosΔ1, FosΔ2, and FosΔ3, GST fusions to ERα and ERβ, mammalian expression/in vitro translation vector for ERα, ASC-2, ASC2-4, c-Jun, and c-Fos, the reporter constructs ERE-Luc, AP1-Luc, Gal4-Luc, and LexA-β-gal, and the transfection indicator construct pRSV-β-gal were as described (21Lee S.-K. Choi H.S. Song M.R. Lee M.O. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1184-1192Google Scholar, 22Lee S.-K. Kim H.J. Na S.-Y. Kim T.S. Choi H.-S. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. J. Biol.

Finally, PCR fragment encoding the full-length ERα was subcloned into the HindIII andXhoI restriction sites of the yeast expression vector p425-Gal1 (23Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Google Scholar). The LexA-ASC2-4 (24Lee S.-K. Na S.Y. Jung S.Y. Choi J.E. Jhun B.H. Cheong J. Meltzer P.S. Lee Y.C. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 915-925Google Scholar) was used as a bait to screen a mouse liver cDNA library in pJG4-5 to identify ASC-2-interacting proteins, and the screening was executed essentially as described previously (25Lee J.W. Choi H.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Google Scholar). The yeast β-galactosidase assay was done as described (25Lee J.W. Choi H.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Google Scholar). For each experiment, at least three independently derived colonies expressing chimeric proteins were tested. The GST fusions or GST alone was expressed in Escherichia coli, bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), and incubated with labeled proteins expressed by in vitro translation by using the TNT-coupled transcription-translation system, with conditions as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). Specifically bound proteins were eluted from beads with 40 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described (26Lee J.W. Ryan F. Swaffield J.C. Johnston S.A. Moore D.D. Nature. 1995; 374: 91-94Google Scholar). CV-1 cells were grown in 24-well plates with medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped serum. After 24 h of incubation, cells were transfected with 100 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector pRSV-β-gal and 100 ng of an indicated reporter gene, along with c-Fos, ASC-2, ERα, CAPER, CAPER-MII-2, and Gal4 fusions to ERα and ERβ as well as various CAPER fragments. Total amounts of expression vectors were kept constant by adding decreasing amounts of the CDM8 expression vector to transfections. Twelve hours later, cells were washed and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. After 12 h, cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with 0.1 μm ligand. Cells were harvested 24 h later, and luciferase activity was assayed as described (26Lee J.W. Ryan F. Swaffield J.C. Johnston S.A. Moore D.D. Nature. 1995; 374: 91-94Google Scholar), and the results were normalized to the β-galactosidase expression. To search for interacting proteins with the recently described transcriptional coactivator ASC-2 (24Lee S.-K. Na S.Y. Jung S.Y. Choi J.E. Jhun B.H. Cheong J. Meltzer P.S. Lee Y.C. Lee J.W. Mol.

Jhun B.H. Cheong J. Meltzer P.S. Lee Y.C. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 915-925Google Scholar) as a bait. A few independent cDNAs encoded a protein similar to human proteins HCC1.3 and HCC1.4 (20Imai H. Chan E.K. Kiyosawa K. Fu X.D. Tan E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2419-2426Google Scholar). These proteins were described previously as novel nuclear autoantigens identified with antibodies from human hepatocarcinoma. These proteins are identical except the presence of additional six amino acids in HCC1.4. The isolated mouse clones retained the internal six amino acids, like HCC1.4, and had only two amino acid changes from the human proteins (results not shown). HCC1.3 and HCC1.4 were indistinguishable in their binding and transcriptional coactivation properties (results not shown), and thus we focused only on HCC1.3 for the rest of the studies presented here. Based on their functional properties (this paper) and ubiquitous expression pattern (20Imai H. Chan E.K. Kiyosawa K. Fu X.D. Tan E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2419-2426Google Scholar), we renamed these proteins CAPER (for coactivator ofAP-1 and ERs). Despite the lack of direct sequence homology, it is interesting to note that CAPER and PGC-1, the recently defined transcription coactivator of PPARγ (9Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Google Scholar), has a few conserved features in common (Fig.1A). These include a cryptic autonomous transactivation domain (Fig. 5B), a region rich in Ser-Arg pairs (so called SR domains) (reviewed in Ref. 29Tacke R. Manley J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 358-362Google Scholar), and an RNA recognition motif (RRM) (30Shamoo Y. Abdul-Manan N. Williams K.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 725-728Google Scholar) with homology to corresponding domains found in hnRNP proteins and SR factors (Fig. 1B). The RRM, consisting of two highly conserved peptide motifs, ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-1 and RNP-2, confers both RNA and single-stranded DNA binding activity (30Shamoo Y. Abdul-Manan N. Williams K.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 725-728Google Scholar). The hnRNP family of proteins includes members that are involved in all aspects of RNA metabolism (reviewed in Ref. 31Krecic A.M. Swanson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 363-371Google Scholar), and some of them have been shown to have transcriptional activity through association with single-stranded DNA enhancer sequences in the promoter region of the genes they regulate (32Eggert M.

The association of SR domains and RRMs is typical of the classical SR splicing factors that play a key role in both constitutive splicing and in the regulation of alternative splicing in vivo (29Tacke R. Manley J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 358-362Google Scholar). Interestingly, PGC-1 was recently shown to mediate mRNA splicing (35Monsalve M. Wu Z. Adelmant G. Puigserver P. Fan M. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 307-316Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of a novel class of proteins that may coordinate the coupled events of transcription and mRNA processing in vivo(reviewed in Ref. 36Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1415-1429Google Scholar). Thus, it will be interesting to examine whether CAPER and the recently defined “PGC-1-related coactivator,” a serum-inducible coactivator of nuclear respiratory factor 1-dependent transcription in mammalian cells (37Andersson U. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3738-3749Google Scholar), are also involved with mRNA processing. When LexA fusion to ASC2-4 was coexpressed in yeast with the amphiphatic acidic transactivation domain B42 (25Lee J.W. Choi H.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Google Scholar) fused to various CAPER constructs (Fig.2A), only the full-length CAPER and CAPER-C enhanced the LexA-ASC2-4-directed transactivation (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the interaction interface with ASC-2 may involve the C-terminal region of CAPER (i.e. CAPER-C in Fig. 2A). Consistent with these yeast results, GST fusions to the full-length CAPER and CAPER-C but not GST alone interacted with in vitro translated ASC2-4 (Fig.2C). The CAPER-interacting domain was further mapped to the N-terminal region of ASC2-4 (i.e. ASC2-4Δ3 consisting of the ASC-2 residues 1172–1273) in yeast, as shown in Fig.2D.Figure 5The autonomous transactivation domain ofCAPER. A, CV-1 cells were transfected withlacZ expression vector (100 ng), the increasing amount of expression vectors for Gal4 alone or Gal4 fusions to the full-length CAPER and various CAPER fragments, and a reporter geneGal4-Luc (100 ng), as indicated. Open andsolid boxes indicate 50 and 100 ng of each Gal4 construct, respectively. Normalized luciferase expressions from triplicate samples were calculated relative to the lacZ expressions. The experiments were repeated at least three times, and the representative results were expressed as fold activation (n-fold) over the value obtained with Gal4 alone, with the error bars as indicated. B, expression vectors for LexA/CAPER, LexA/CAPER-MII, and ERα were transformed into a yeast strain containing an appropriate lacZ reporter gene, as described (24Lee S.-K. Na S.Y. Jung S.Y. Choi J.E.

Normalized lacZexpressions from triplicate samples were calculated relative to the result with B42 alone. The data are representative of at least two similar experiments. C, ASC2-4 was labeled with [35S]methionine by in vitro translation and incubated with glutathione beads containing GST alone and GST fusions to the full-length CAPER and CAPER-C, as indicated. Beads were washed, and specifically bound material was eluted with reduced glutathione and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Approximately 20% of the total reaction mixture was loaded as input. D, B42 fusion to CAPER-C was coexpressed with indicated LexA fusions to different ASC-2 fragments in a yeast strain containing an appropriate lacZ reporter gene, as described (21Lee S.-K. Choi H.S. Song M.R. Lee M.O. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1184-1192Google Scholar). The receptor-interacting LXXLL motif (38Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Google Scholar, 39Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Google Scholar) of ASC2-4 is as indicated.

These included p53, the NFκB component p50, the activating protein-1 components c-Jun and c-Fos, serum response factor, retinoid X receptor α, RARα, TRα and -β, PPARα, liver X receptor α and β, farnesoid X receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, and ERα and -β. Among these factors, only c-Jun, ERα, and ERβ appeared to interact significantly with CAPER (see below). Transactivation mediated by LexA fusion to CAPER was stimulated by B42 fusions to the full-length c-Jun and JunΔ3 but not JunΔ1, JunΔ2, c-Fos, FosΔ1, FosΔ2, and FosΔ3 in yeast (Fig. 3, Aand B). In addition, B42-JunΔ3 stimulated transactivation by LexA fusion to CAPER-MII fragment but not -N, -MI, and -C fragments (Fig. 3C). It is noteworthy that the transcriptionally inert full-length CAPER contains a cryptic autonomous transactivation function ascribed to the MII region (i.e. compare the basal activities of LexA fusions to the full-length CAPER and CAPER-MII in Fig. 3C). Corroborating these yeast results, GST fusion to CAPER-MII interacted with in vitro translated c-Jun but not c-Fos (Fig. 3D). Thus, the MII subregion of CAPER appears to interact specifically with the C-terminal region of c-Jun (i.e. JunΔ3). Transactivation directed by LexA fusions to the full-length CAPER and CAPE-MII but not CAPER-N, -MI, and -C was stimulated by B42 fusion to ERα and ERβ in an E2-dependent manner (Fig.4A). Interestingly, these E2-dependent interactions were retained with a mutant ERα that lacks the AF2 core region (i.e.ERαΔAF2). This AF2-independent interaction of CAPER with ERα is consistent with the lack of LXXLL motif in CAPER, which was recently shown to be a binding interface for many AF2-dependent coactivators (38Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Google Scholar, 39Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Google Scholar). In contrast to the wild type ERα, however, ERαΔAF2 also bound CAPER in the presence of partial antagonist tamoxifen. The yeast results further suggested that the interaction interfaces involve the EF domains of ERα (Fig.4B) and the MII-2 fragment of CAPER (i.e. the CAPER residues 356–400) (Fig. 4C). This prediction was also confirmed in the in vitro GST pull-down assays, in which radiolabeled CAPER or CAPER-MII specifically interacted with GST fusion to ERα only in the presence of E2 (Fig. 4D). Similarly, CAPER-MII also interacted with GST fusion to the full-length ERβ only in the presence of E2 but not tamoxifen. Overall, these results clearly indicated that CAPER binds the AP-1 component c-Jun and both ERα and β.Figure 4CAPER as ER interactant. A andC, the indicated B42 and LexA plasmids were transformed into a yeast strain containing an appropriate lacZ reporter gene, as described (24Lee S.-K. Na S.Y. Jung S.Y. Choi J.E. Jhun B.H.

F indicates the full-length CAPER, whereas N, MI, MII, and C are as shown in Fig. 2A. All the ER fragments used were fusions to B42 (C). Normalized lacZexpressions from triplicate samples were calculated relative to the result with B42 alone. The data are representative of at least two similar experiments. B, the full-length ERα as well as five ERα fragments are as indicated, in which A–F denotes functional modules of nuclear receptors (2Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G.

Approximately 20% of the total reaction mixture were loaded as input.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Many transcription coactivators are known to exhibit transcriptional activities when forced to bind DNA (2Mangelsdorf D.J.

Interestingly, Gal4 fusions to the full-length CAPER or CAPER-ΔC1, -ΔC2, -N, -ΔN1, -ΔN2, and -C fragments directed transcriptional activities lower than that mediated by Gal4 alone in CV-1 cells (Fig.5A). However, a cryptic activation function was unraveled with the MII fragment, which was further localized to the MII-1 fragment (i.e. the CAPER residues 291–355). These results also suggested the presence of independent transcriptional repression function, both at the N- and C-terminal regions of CAPER. However, it is not currently clear whether these regions have intrinsic repressive activities or simply mask the activation function within the MII-1 region. Surprisingly, the transcriptionally inert full-length CAPER fused to the DNA-binding protein LexA, upon coexpression of ERα in the presence of E2, became fully active in yeast (Fig. 5B). Consistent with the direct involvement of the activation function within the MII region in this E2/ERα-dependent activation of CAPER, transactivation mediated by LexA-CAPER-MII was further stimulated by E2/ERα. Similar results were also obtained with Gal4 fusions to CAPER and CAPER-MII in CV-1 cells (results not shown). These results are analogous to the recent report (40Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Wu Z. Fan M. Xu J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Google Scholar), in which transcriptionally inactive PGC-1 was stimulated upon coexpression of activated PPARγ. They further demonstrated that the docking of PGC-1 to PPARγ stimulates an apparent conformational change in PGC-1 that permits binding of SRC-1 and CBP/p300, resulting in a large increase in transcriptional activity (40Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Wu Z. Fan M. Xu J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Google Scholar). Because CAPER was isolated based on its interaction with ASC-2, which also serves as an excellent coactivator of ERs (27Lee S.-K. Anzick S.L. Choi J.E. Bubendorf L. Guan X.Y. Jung Y.K. Kallioniemi O.P. Kononen J. Trent J.M. Azorsa D. Jhun B.H. Cheong J.H. Lee Y.C. Meltzer P.S. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34283-34293Google Scholar), activated-ERα may also cause a conformational change with CAPER, resulting in better bindings with ASC-2 or other coactivator molecules. This possibility is currently under investigation. The functional significance of the interactions of CAPER with c-Jun and ERs was tested in cotransfections. CAPER potently stimulated transactivation by AP-1 when tested with AP1-luciferase reporter construct (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, ASC-2 showed a relatively week synergy with CAPER only in the presence of 200 ng of ASC-2 expression vector (compare the transactivation levels of 50 ng of CAPER, 200 ng of ASC-2, and both in Fig. 6A). Similar results were also obtained with Gal4 fusions to c-Jun and c-Fos (results not shown). With both ERE-luciferase and Gal4-luciferase reporter constructs, coexpression of CAPER in CV-1 cells stimulated the E2-dependent level of transcriptional activities without significantly affecting the basal activities (Fig. 6B). In contrast, CAPER had no coactivation function with other transcription factors that did not show significant interactions with CAPER. These included TR, RAR, p53, and serum response factor (results not shown). Interestingly, CAPER-MII-2, which contains the ERα-interacting region (Fig.4C), exhibited a dominant negative phenotype with the ERα transactivation (Fig. 6C), suggesting the possible importance of the direct ERα-CAPER interactions in E2-mediated transactivation. Overall, these results strongly suggest that CAPER is a bona fide transcriptional coactivator molecule of AP-1 and ERs. In this report, we have shown that CAPER is a transcriptional coactivator molecule whose function, in contrast to multifunctional integrator molecules like CBP/p300, SRC-1, and ASC-2 (3McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Google Scholar, 4Lee J.W. Lee Y.C. Na S.Y. Jung D.J. Lee S.K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 289-297Google Scholar), is rather selective to AP-1, ERα, and ERβ. As summarized in Fig.6D, CAPER contains distinct binding sites for c-Jun (Fig. 3) and ERs (Fig. 4) and significantly enhances their transactivation potential in cotransfections (Fig. 6, A and B). In particular, a fragment of CAPER that contains a binding site for ERα (i.e. CAPER-MII-2) acted as a potent dominant negative mutant for E2-dependent transactivation by ERα (Fig. 6C), suggesting the possible importance of the direct interactions between ERα and CAPER. It is noted that CAPER was originally isolated as a molecule that specifically interacts with transcriptional integrator ASC-2 (24Lee S.-K. Na S.Y. Jung S.Y. Choi J.E. Jhun B.H. Cheong J. Meltzer P.S. Lee Y.C. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 915-925Google Scholar, 27Lee S.-K. Anzick S.L. Choi J.E. Bubendorf L. Guan X.Y. Jung Y.K. Kallioniemi O.P. Kononen J. Trent J.M. Azorsa D.

Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 241-254Google Scholar), and we further localized the ASC-2-binding site to the C-terminal region of CAPER (Fig. 2). Under our experimental conditions, however, we were not able to demonstrate clearly the synergistic activation function of CAPER and ASC-2, although some synergy was observed with the AP-1 transactivation in the presence of a higher dose of ASC-2 expression vector (Fig.6A). Further work is warranted to fully resolve this issue. CAPER contains an autonomous transactivation domain that was localized to the CAPER residues 291–355 (i.e. CAPER-MII-1) (Fig.5A). Strikingly, the full-length CAPER was transcriptionally inactive, unless coexpressed with E2-bound ERα (Fig.5B). The CAPER residues 291–400 (i.e. CAPER-MII) that also contains the neighboring ERα-binding site behaved similarly. These results strongly suggest that CAPER undergoes a conformational change upon binding activated ERα. Similar results were recently reported with PGC-1 (9Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Google Scholar), in which the docking of PGC-1 to PPARγ stimulated an apparent conformational change in PGC-1 that permits binding of SRC-1 and CBP/p300, resulting in a large increase in transcriptional activity (40Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Wu Z. Fan M. Xu J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Google Scholar). The similarity between CAPER and PGC-1 also includes the presence of SR domains and RRMs (Fig. 1). The association of SR domains and RRMs is typical of the classical SR splicing factors that play a key role in both constitutive splicing and in the regulation of alternative splicing in vivo (29Tacke R. Manley J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 358-362Google Scholar). Indeed, PGC-1 was shown recently to mediate mRNA splicing (35Monsalve M. Wu Z. Adelmant G. Puigserver P. Fan M. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 307-316Google Scholar). PGC-1-related coactivator, a serum-inducible coactivator of nuclear respiratory factor 1-dependent transcription in mammalian cells, was also isolated as an RRM-containing coactivator molecule (37Andersson U. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3738-3749Google Scholar). While this manuscript was in preparation, Iwasaki et al. (41Iwasaki T. Chin W.W. Ko L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33375-33383Google Scholar) reported another RRM-containing coactivator activator (CoAA) as a novel ASC-2-interacting protein. Interestingly, CoAA, in contrast to CAPER, showed rather broad target specificity, stimulating transactivation mediated by multiple hormone-response elements (41Iwasaki T. Chin W.W. Ko L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33375-33383Google Scholar). These results suggest an interesting possibility that ASC-2 may act as a platform to recruit various RRM-containing coactivator molecules such as CoAA and CAPER. Notably, p68 RNA helicase was recently isolated as a transcriptional coactivator specific for the AF1 of ERα (11Endoh H. Maruyama K. Masuhiro Y. Kobayashi Y. Goto M. Tai H. Yanagisawa J. Metzger D. Hashimoto S. Kato S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5363-5372Google Scholar), whereas RNA helicase A was found to mediate association of CREB-binding protein with RNA polymerase II (42Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1107-1112Google Scholar). In addition, a novel transcriptional coactivator p52 interacted not only with transcriptional activators and general transcription factors to enhance activated transcription but also with the essential splicing factor ASF/SF2 both in vitro and in vivo to modulate ASF/SF2-mediated pre-mRNA splicing (43Ge H. Si Y. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 751-759Google Scholar). It is important to note that post-transcriptional mRNA processings such as 5′-capping, splicing, and polyadenylation can take place cotranscriptionally in vivo (36Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1415-1429Google Scholar). Thus, these proteins and CAPER may also act as adapter molecules to coordinate various pre-mRNA processings and transcriptional initiation of class II genes, in addition to functioning as transcriptional coactivators. Consistent with this idea, CAPER was originally found colocalized with splicing factors in nuclear speckles (20Imai H. Chan E.K. Kiyosawa K. Fu X.D. Tan E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2419-2426Google Scholar) like PGC-1 (35Monsalve M. Wu Z. Adelmant G. Puigserver P. Fan M. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 307-316Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have shown that CAPER is a novel transcriptional coactivator specific to ERs and AP-1. Studies of CAPER, along with PGC-1 and other related molecules, may provide an important insight into the coupling mechanisms of different mRNA processings in vivo. We thank Dr. Eng M. Tan for plasmids."

The development of cell polarity depends on an ability to organize components of the cytoskeleton with reference to the extracellular environment. In fibroblasts and other motile cells, polarity can be stimulated by chemotactic gradients, the anterior portion of the cell forming a flattened, protrusive structure termed the lamellipodium. The leading edge or tip of this lamellipodium is the point at which members of the integrin family of adhesion receptors engage the extracellular matrix in an interaction that leads to the clustering of integrins into an array of small multiprotein focal complexes (1Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). These focal complexes contain a number of structural and signaling proteins capable of initiating the polymerization of actin within the lamellipodial tip (1Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar), and this provides the driving force for cell migration. The adaptor protein paxillin is recruited into focal complexes at an early stage following integrin engagement (2Nakamura K. Yano H. Uchida H. Hashimoto S. Schaefer E. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27155-27164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Paxillin consists of an NH2-terminal region containing five leucine-rich motifs termed “LD domains” and a COOH-terminal region with four tandem LIM domains. Numerous proteins have been identified that bind to one or other of these domains, many of which are thought to participate in signaling pathways that regulate the dynamic properties of focal complexes and thereby cell motility (3Turner C.E.

Additionally, immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy indicates that paxillin localizes to the perinuclear ER and Golgi membranes and binds to several proteins each exhibiting specific GAP activities toward ARF1 or ARF6 GTPases (9Mazaki Y.

Cell. 2001; 12: 645-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Both these GTPases are essential in intracellular trafficking and the establishment of cell polarity. However, the precise roles and the mechanisms by which paxillin is involved in the establishment of cell polarity still largely remain to be established. The targeting of certain mRNAs is emerging as a possible mechanism by which cell polarity can be generated and maintained. The mRNA for β-actin contains a specific sequence in its 3′-UTR, termed the “ZIPcode” that directs it to the lamellipodium during cell migration (13Kislauskis E.H. Singer R.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 975-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Introduction of ZIPcode antisense oligonucleotides into migrating cells delocalizes the β-actin mRNA from the lamellipodium and results in loss of polarity and directional movement (14Shestakova E.A. Singer R.H. Condeelis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7045-7050Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The mechanism for β-actin mRNA localization in fibroblasts is most likely mediated by recruitment of a mRNA protein complex onto the actin cytoskeleton, and it is possible that this is mediated at least in part by the ZIPcode-binding protein (15Ross A.F. Oleynikov Y. Kislauskis E.H. Taneja K.L. Singer R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2158-2165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, β-actin mRNA localization has been shown to require the activation of rho kinase (16Latham V.M., Yu, E.H. Tullio A.N. Adelstein R.S. Singer R.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1010-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), strongly implicating a role for myosin II in the translocation of ZIPcode bearing mRNAs to the lamellipodia. Indeed it has been shown that in yeast, Ash1 mRNA is transported along actin filaments to the daughter cell by the docking of an RNA-containing protein complex onto a myosin motor, Myo4p (17Long R.M., Gu, W. Lorimer E. Singer R.H. Chartrand P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6592-6601Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In neuronal cells, β-actin mRNA is transported to the tips of neurites and advancing growth cones, most likely by virtue of the same ZIPcode. In contrast to fibroblasts, however, the acto-myosin system is not the main player in localizing β-actin mRNA to the neurite tip. β-actin mRNA is located in large macromolecular granules, and the transport of these along neuronal processes is dependent on microtubules (18Bassell G.J. Zhang H. Byrd A.L. Femino A.M. Singer R.H. Taneja K.L. Lifshitz L.M. Herman I.M. Kosik K.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 251-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that, depending on the cell type, large ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes containing β-actin mRNA can be transported on both microfilamentous and microtubular cytoskeletal tracks. In neurones, the mRNA for secreted neuropeptides such as vasopressin are transported to the tips of the dendrites (19Mohr E. Fuhrmann C. Richter D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that a satellite secretory pathway containing elements of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi interstitial compartment and Golgi that are necessary to locally translate and process these secretory proteins, is present in dendritic spines (20Pierce J.P. Mayer T. McCarthy J.B. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 351-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The 3′-UTR of the vasopressin mRNA contains sequences responsible for localizing it to dendrites, termed the “dendritic localizer sequence” (19Mohr E. Fuhrmann C. Richter D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the dendritic localizer sequence has been shown to bind to the multifunctional RNA-binding protein poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1), indicating that this protein may have a role in the polarized delivery of mRNA (21Mohr E. Prakash N. Vieluf K. Fuhrmann C. Buck F. Richter D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7072-7079Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Using a proteomic approach, we have now shown that cellular paxillin is associated with PABP1 and that the two proteins bind directly to each other in vitro. Both paxillin and PABP1 shuttle between the cytosol and nucleus and localize to the leading edge of migrating cells and to the dense ER, the main site of secretory protein synthesis within the cell. Our findings raise the possibility that a paxillin·PABP1 complex plays a role in the cellular localization of certain mRNAs within the cell and that this may contribute to the development of cell polarity in migrating cells. Monoclonal mouse anti-paxillin, anti-clathrin heavy chain and anti-Rab11 were from Transduction Laboratories. Monoclonal mouse anti-PABP1 (clone 6B12) was a kind gift from Matthias Gorlach (22Gorlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Exp.

FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was from Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Swiss and NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and transfected as described previously (25Roberts M. Barry S. Woods A. van der Sluijs P. Norman J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1392-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out 24 h post-transfection. EGFP-paxillin-α and EGFP-paxillin-β cDNAs have been described previously (9Mazaki Y. Uchida H. Hino O. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22435-22441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The human sequence of PABP1 (residues 10–636) was cloned into BamHI and SacI sites of the His-tagged bacterial expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen). PQE-30-PABP1 was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL-21, grown to a density of 0.3 (A 600 nm) at 37 °C, and then induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for a further 2 h at 22 °C. E. coli were lysed in a French press in a buffer containing 20 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 2 mmbenzamidine, 30 μg/ml leupeptin, 15 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF). 1.0% (v/v) Igepal CA-630 was then added, the lysates clarified by centrifugation, and His-PABP1 was recovered by incubation with 50% NTA-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. His-PABP1 was eluted with a buffer containing 100 mm EDTA at 4 °C and dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.4. PCR-amplified DNA fragments corresponding to the LD1 (aa 1–20), LD2 (aa 141–160), LD3 (aa 212–231), LD4 (aa 263–282), and LD5 (aa 299–317) motifs of human paxillin-α were subcloned into the BamHI-EcoRI site of the pGEX-2TK vector (26Hashimoto S. Tsubouchi A. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6037-6045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), as previously reported (6Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The construct encoding chick paxillin residues 54–313 in the pGEX-2T vector was a generous gift from Dr. Chris Turner (SUNY, Syracuse, NY). GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (9Mazaki Y. Uchida H. Hino O. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22435-22441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to 60% confluence and washed twice in ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 200 mm NaCl, 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 15 mm NaF, 1.5 mmNa3VO4, 7.5 mm EDTA and 7.5 mm EGTA, 1.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.75% (v/v) Igepal CA-630, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm AEBSF (1.14 μl/cm2 culture area) and scraped from the dish with a rubber policeman. Lysates were passed three times through a 27G needle and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitations, magnetic beads conjugated to sheep anti-mouse IgG were blocked in PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA and then bound to mouse anti-paxillin or the control IgG1 antibody, MOPC. For pull-downs, anti-mouse magnetic beads were bound to mouse anti-rabbit IgG, followed by rabbit anti-GST and finally GST, GST-paxillin-(54–313), or GST-LD domains. Antibody and fusion protein-coated beads were incubated with lysates for 2 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. Unbound proteins were removed by extensive washing in lysis buffer and, for analysis of35S-labeled proteins, co-immunoprecipitating material was eluted from the beads by incubation in lysis buffer supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) SDS for 10 min on ice with constant trituration. For analysis of immunoprecipitates and pull-downs by Western blotting, the proteins were removed from the beads by boiling for 10 min in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (27Norman J.C. Jones D. Barry S.T. Holt M.R. Cockcroft S. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1981-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). 25 ml of cell lysate derived from 109 Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts was immunoprecipitated with either anti-paxillin or the control IgG1 (MOPC) as described above. Co-immunoprecipitating proteins were eluted from the beads with a buffer containing 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 0.5% (w/v) SDS and resolved on 6% SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were visualized by colloidal Coomassie staining, excised from the gel, and destained completely prior to digestion according to the published procedure by Shevchenko et al. (28Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). The destained gel slice was then subjected to dithiothreitol (1 mg/ml) to reduce cystinyl residues and then to iodoacetamide (10 mg/ml) to effect alkylation prior to incubation with trypsin. The supernatant liquid from the digest was sampled directly and prepared for MALDI analysis according to the fast evaporation deposition method, using cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and nitrocellulose as described by Jensen et al. (29Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 4741-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). MALDI mass spectra were obtained using a ToFSpec instrument (Micromass, Manchester, UK) fitted with a 337-nm nitrogen laser. Spectra were acquired using the instrument in reflectron mode, and internal mass calibrated using ion signals produced by trypsin autodigestion peptides. Peptide mass errors obtained were typically below 50 ppm. Proteins were identified by searching nonredundant protein sequence data bases with lists of tryptic peptide masses (peptide mass maps) generated from the proteins by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using PeptideSearch d software. Maxisorp plates (96-well) (Nunc) were coated with purified His-PABP1 (10 ng/well) in 50 mmNa2CO3, pH 9.6, overnight at 4 °C, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Various concentrations of GST, GST-paxillin-(54–313) and GST-paxillin LD4 in PBS were added to the wells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Unbound fusion proteins were removed by washing with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and bound fusion proteins detected using rabbit anti-GST followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and visualized by chromogenic reaction with ortho-phenylenediamine as described previously (25Roberts M. Barry S. Woods A. van der Sluijs P. Norman J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1392-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In parallel with this, nonspecific binding of GST fusion proteins to BSA-coated wells was determined, and these values subtracted from those obtained using His-PABP1 coated wells. Cells were grown to 60% confluence, and the monolayers scraped into cell fractionation buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa2VO4, 1 mm AEBSF, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 3 μg/ml pepstatin A. The cells were lysed by 10 passes of a Dounce homogenizer, and nuclei removed by centrifugation at 700 × g for 10 min. Post-nuclear supernatants were layered onto a linear gradient of 10–40% iodixanol in cell fractionation buffer and centrifuged at 48,000 ×g for 18 h at 4 °C. Gradients were eluted and linearity of the gradient confirmed by refractometry. Proteins were precipitated from the gradient fractions with 20% trichloroacetic acid, and the migration positions of paxillin and intracellular compartments determined by Western blotting with antibodies against the following marker proteins; calreticulin (ER), rab11 (endosomes), and clathrin heavy chain (clathrin-coated vesicles). For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were fixed in 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Following this, they were permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and the paraformaldehyde quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA for 1 h, and cells incubated with the primary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. Detection was by FITC or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies. The actin cytoskeleton was visualized by counterstaining with FITC or Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted in Profade antifade mountant (Molecular Probes) and viewed on a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope with EGFP fluorescence being collected into the fluorescein channel. Numerous paxillin-binding proteins have been identified using GST-paxillin pull down assays and yeast two hybrid screens. However, it is unclear how many of these proteins form stable complexes with paxillin in the cell. To approach this question, magnetic beads conjugated to anti-paxillin monoclonal antibodies were incubated with Triton X-100 lysates of subconfluent 3T3 fibroblasts labeled to steady state with [35S]methionine/cysteine. Following extensive washing in a buffer containing 1.5% Triton X-100 and 0.75% Igepal CA-630, co-precipitating proteins were eluted from the beads with a buffer containing 0.5% SDS for 10 min on ice. Under these elution conditions, paxillin itself remained associated with the beads (data not shown), thus allowing the identification of co-precipitating proteins in the same molecular weight range as paxillin. Analysis of the eluted proteins by SDS-PAGE and fluorography identified several components that were specifically found in the paxillin but not in the control immunoprecipitates, most notably proteins of 170 kDa, 105 kDa and 70 kDa (Fig. 1 A). To identify these proteins, paxillin was immunoprecipitated from lysates made from 109 cells, and the co-precipitating components visualized by staining the gels with colloidal Coomassie. Bands corresponding to the 170-kDa, 105-kDa and 70-kDa proteins (Fig.1 B) were excised from the gel and digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The 170-kDa protein, p170, yielded 13 tryptic peptides corresponding to those predicted to be obtained from clathrin heavy chain-1 (CHC-1) (Table I). CHC has previously been identified as a binding partner for paxillin (6Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), although the significance of this is not yet known. Interestingly, the other two paxillin-associated proteins, p105 and p70, are both proteins known to bind mRNA. From p105, we identified 16 peptides that matched polypyrimidine tract binding (PTB) protein-associated splicing factor (PSF) (Table I), a protein known to bind to PTB protein and proposed to play a role in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. From p70, we identified six peptides from PABP1 (Table I) that associate with the 3′-poly(A) tail of mRNAs.Table IPeptide analysis of proteins co-immunoprecipitating with paxillinProteinsPeptide bandsTotal coveragep170145HSSLAGCQIINYR157191/1675 = 11% Clathrin HC-1164WLLLTGISAQQNR176298ISGETIFVTAPHEATAGIJGVNR320367KFNALFAQGNYSEAAK382469SVDPTLALSVYLR481626ALEHFTDLYDIKR638838GQFSTDELVAEVEKR852896ENPYYDSRVVGKYCEKR9121011IVLDNSVFSEHR10221227LASTLVHLGEYQAAVDGAR12451444QLPLVKPYLR14531482TSIDAYDNFDNISLAQR14981499LEKHELIEFR1508p10533SPPPGMGLNQNR44222/707 = 31% PTB-associated splicing factor280ANLSLLR286299LFVGNLPADITEDEFKR315320YGEPGEVFINK330333GFGFIKLESR342366FATHAAALSVR376377NLSPYVSNELLEEAFSQFGPIER399400AVVIVDDR407414GIVEFASKPAAR425480FAQHGTFEYEYSQR493519LESEMEDAYHEHQANLLR536542RQEELRR547567QEEERR572592QREESYSR599667FGQGGAGPVGGQGPR681694GREEYEGPNKKPR706p7031FSPAGPILSIR4177/522 = 15% Poly(A)-binding protein 151SLGYAYVNFQQPADAER67139GYGFVHFETQEAAER153229GFGFVSFER237354IVATKPLYVALAQR367372QAHLTNQYMQR382Proteins co-immunoprecipitating with paxillin were resolved in SDS-PAGE and visualised by colloidal Coomassie staining, and bands corresponding to proteins of 170 kDa, 105 kDa, and 70 kDa excised from the gel displayed in Fig. 1 B.

Peptides derived from p170 correspond to clathrin heavy chain, from p105 to PTB-associated splicing factor (PSF) and those from p70 to poly(A)-binding protein (PABP1). Protein bands observable at 50 and 97 kDa were not analyzed by mass spectrometry. We detected proteins of these sizes associated with the control IgG (Fig. 1 A), thus it was difficult to ensure the specificity of their association with paxillin immunoprecipitates. In addition, we were unable to identify some of the less abundant components of the paxillin immunoprecipitates, for instance the band at 150 kDa (Fig. 1 A), as these were present in insufficient quantity to obtain sequence from the mass spectrometry analysis. Two distinct poly(A)-binding proteins, PABP1 and PABP2, are expressed in mammalian cells, and these differ markedly in their proposed function and subcellular localization (24Calado A. Carmo-Fonseca M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2309-2318PubMed Google Scholar). Both PABP1 and PABP2 are RNA recognition motif (RRM)-containing proteins that bind to the poly(A)-tails of mRNA, and it is possible that these properties alone are sufficient to confer association with paxillin. However, Western blot analysis of paxillin immunoprecipitates with antibodies specific for either PABP1 or PABP2 indicated that paxillin associated exclusively with PABP1 (Fig.2 A), suggesting that sequences specific to PABP1, and not merely the possession of a poly(A)-binding RRM motif, are responsible for paxillin binding. As PABP1 associates with mRNA, it is possible that paxillin binds to PABP1 via RNA. We investigated this possibility by treating cell lysates with RNase for 6 min at 30 °C prior to immunoprecipitation. However, RNase-pretreatment did not reduce the quantity of PABP1 coprecipitating with paxillin (Fig. 2 A), indicating that the association is most likely to involve a protein-protein interaction. Mouse fibroblasts express both the α and β isoforms of paxillin (9Mazaki Y. Uchida H. Hino O. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol.

Together with several enzymes containing the first identified, non-proteinous quinone cofactor, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), the enzymes containing those cofactors constitute a quinoprotein family of enzymes (6Davidson V.L. Principles and Applications of Quinoproteins. Marcel Decker, NY1993Google Scholar). Quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenases (QH-AmDH) from Gram-negative bacteria represent a new type in the quinoprotein class of amine-oxidizing enzymes because they contain not only a quinone but also one or two hemes as a redox active group (7Adachi O.

The structure of the presumed quinone cofactor in QH-AmDH remain to be settled, although biochemical and spectroscopic analyses have suggested the presence of a quinone group similar to, but not identical, with TTQ (7Adachi O.

Although we initially encountered difficulties in the interpretation of the chemical and mass data, the progress in elucidating the crystal structure of the enzyme enabled us to unequivocally identify a novel quinone cofactor, cysteine tryptophylquinone (CTQ) (naming is analogous with that for TTQ). Besides this novel “in situ-generated” quinone cofactor, the covalent structure reported in the preceding article (10Vandenberghe I. Kim J.-K. Devreese B. Hacisalihoglu A. Iwabuki H. Okajima T.

These links are unprecedented as they are thioether bonds between a cysteine sulfur atom and a methylene carbon atom of an aspartic or a glutamic acid residue. QH-AmDH of P. putida was purified as described (7Adachi O. Kubota T. Hacisalihoglu A. Toyama H. Shinagawa E. Duine J.A. Matsushita K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and crystallized at 20 °C using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. Drops were prepared by mixing 5 μl of 12 mg ml−1 protein solution with 5 μl of a reservoir solution of 18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethylether and 50 mm NiCl2. Crystals grew in a space group C2 (unit cell: a = 167.2,b = 91.5, c = 78.9 Å, and β = 113°) with one heterotrimeric molecule in the asymmetric unit. To prepare the complex with p-nitrophenylhydrazine (pNPH), the native crystals were soaked in the solutions supplemented with 1 mmpNPH. The heavy atom derivatives were obtained by soaking the crystals in solutions containing heavy atom reagents. The data sets for the native crystals, the pNPH-complexed crystals, and the crystals for heavy atom derivatives were collected at 287 K on Beam Line 18B at Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan) (see Table I). The intensity data were integrated and scaled with DPS/MOSFLM (11Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and EESF-EACMB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography.

Open table in a new tab The structure was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement and anomalous scattering. The location of the initial heavy atom sites was determined by the difference Patterson method. The experimental phases to 3.0 Å were calculated using SHARP (13De La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) with a figure of merit of 0.74 including all derivatives followed by solvent flattening by SOLOMON (14Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 32-42Crossref Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) with a figure of merit of 0.94. The resulting phases were improved and extended to 2.6 Å. The model of QH-AmDH was built stepwise into the 2.6-Å map with the program O (15Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), and a series of refinements was performed with the program XPLOR (16Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar). In this stage, the α- and β-subunits were modeled nicely on the electron density map, but the γ-subunit could be modeled only partially because of its anomalous structure containing very few α-helices and no β-strands (see “Results and Discussion”). Therefore, the phases were further improved based on this temporal model, and subsequently the 2Fo − Fc electron density map was calculated at 1.9-Å resolution. The resultant map was of sufficient quality for tracing the whole polypeptide chain of the γ-subunit with the side chains referring to the primary structure. After several rounds of refinement and manual rebuilding,Rfactor and Rfree were reduced to 29.8 and 26.7%, respectively. Water molecules were picked up from the difference map on the basis of the peak heights and distance criteria except for those whose thermal factors after refinement were above 58 Å2 (corresponding to the maximum thermal factor of the main chain atoms). Further model building and refinement cycles resulted in an Rfactor value of 21.1% and an Rfree value of 24.5% calculated for 87,307 reflections (Fo > 2ς(Fo)) observed in a 10.0–1.9-Å resolution range (see Table II). During the last step of the refinement, unambiguous water molecules were added including those with a temperature factor higher than 58 Å2. The maximum temperature factor of the water molecules was 78 Å2.Table IIRefinement and model statisticsNativepNPHRefinement statistics RefinementResolution limit10.0–1.9 Å10.0–2.0 ÅRfactor(%)21.1 (23.7)2-aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution cells.21.1 (27.9)Rfree (%)24.5 (29.6)25.0 (29.3) Mean B factorsMain chain atoms (Å2)18.719.8Side chain atoms (Å2)19.521.0Water atoms (Å2)30.630.4Model statistics DeviationsBond length (Å)0.0090.009Bond angles (deg)1.611.63 Ramachandran plotFavored (%)87.285.5Allowed (%)11.613.3Generously allowed (%)0.90.9Disallowed (%)0.30.32-a Values in parentheses are for the highest resolution cells. Open table in a new tab The same refinement procedure was applied to thepNPH-complexed enzyme but using the coordinates of the native QH-AmDH as an initial model. When theRfactor value reached below 29%, the difference Fourier map clearly exhibited the residual electron density corresponding to the bound pNPH. Further model building and refinement cycles gave Rfactor andRfree values of 21.1 and 25.0%, respectively, calculated for 74,658 reflections (Fo > 2ς(Fo)), observed in a 10.0–2.0-Å resolution range (see Table II). The maximum temperature factor of the assigned water molecules was 75 Å2. The final models of the native enzyme and the pNPH complex both contained 909 amino acid residues and two heme c groups with 457 water molecules for the native enzyme and 359 water molecules plus one pNPH molecule (as the hydrazone) for the pNPH complex. No interpretable electron density was observed for one N-terminal residue of the α-subunit, three N-terminal residues and residues 220–226 of the β-subunit, and two N-terminal residues of the γ-subunit. Both models had a good quality with 98.8% of residues falling in the most favorable and additionally allowed region and only 0.3% in the disallowed region, when the stereochemistry was assessed by PROCHECK (17Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) (see Table II). Structure diagrams were drawn with programs MOLSCRIPT (18Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), Raster3D (19Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3878) Google Scholar), and BOBSCRIPT (20Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graphics. 1997; 15: 132-134Crossref Scopus (1795) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the native QH-AmDH was determined at 1.9-Å resolution (TablesI and II), utilizing the DNA-based protein sequence (10Vandenberghe I. Kim J.-K. Devreese B. Hacisalihoglu A. Iwabuki H. Okajima T. Kuroda S. Adachi O. Jongejan J.A. Duine J.A. Tanizawa K. Van Beeumen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42923-42931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous biochemical analysis (7Adachi O. Kubota T. Hacisalihoglu A. Toyama H. Shinagawa E. Duine J.A. Matsushita K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the enzyme is composed of three non-identical subunits: a 494-residue α-subunit (∼60 kDa) carrying two heme c groups, a 349-residue β-subunit (∼40 kDa), and a 79-residue γ-subunit (∼9 kDa) bearing the quinone cofactor. The γ-subunit is embedded in the crevice of the α-subunit with an extensive intersubunit interface with a contacting surface area of 4,640 Å2, making the αγ pair look like a single subunit (Fig. 1A). When viewed in cross-section, the convex “bottom” of the heterodimer lies on the concave “top” surface of the β-subunit, with a contacting surface area of 4,913 Å2 to build up the overall heterotrimeric structure. As a result, only 34% of the surface area of the γ-subunit is exposed to solvent. The α-subunit comprises four distinct domains (I–IV). Domain I has a predominant helical structure and can be subdivided into two subdomains, each containing a heme c group covalently attached to a Cys residue through a thioether linkage, as in class I cytochromes c (21Moore G.R. Pettigrew G.W. Cytochrome C: Evolutionary, Structural and Physicochemical Aspects. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990Crossref Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The overall structure of domain I is similar to that of a di-heme cytochromec (22Chen Z.W. Koh M. Van Driessche G. Van Beeumen J.J. Bartsch R.G. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Mathews F.S. Science. 1994; 206: 430-432Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 23Fülöp V. Ridout C.J. Greenwood C. Hajdu J.

Structure. 1997; 5: 203-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), in which the two cytochrome c-like domains are related by a pseudo 2-fold axis, suggesting that the α-subunit harbors a di-heme cytochrome c forming an intramolecular electron transfer system. One of the two hemec groups (heme I) is encapsulated within the protein interior, facing the interface with the γ-subunit, whereas the other heme c (heme II) is situated at the interface between the α- and β-subunits, exposing one of its sides toward the solvent. The two heme planes are tilted by about 51° with each other and separated in an Fe–Fe distance of 15.8 Å. The two iron atoms of the heme groups have different axial ligands, His-106α and His-128α in heme I and His-18α and Met-46α in heme II, suggesting that they have different redox potentials. Domains II–IV of the α-subunit consist mainly of β-structures with two short α-helices located on the surface side of domain IV. Domain II has a typical β-barrel structure with eight up-and-down antiparallel β-strands. Domain III is a pseudo barrel formed by three and four antiparallel β-strands. Domain IV is also a pseudo barrel of seven β-strands with an additional β-sheet of three strands on the N-terminal side and the C-terminal loop interacting with the γ-subunit. It is noteworthy that the barrel folds of domains III and IV resemble those of the first and third domains, respectively, of the monomeric galactose oxidase, which contains another type of post-translationally generated redox cofactor, the Cys-Tyr adduct, in which Cys and Tyr are covalently coupled to each other by a thioether bond between the sulfur atom and the phenyl ring (25Ito N.

Knowles P.F. Dooley D.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 990-991Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The β-subunit is folded into seven motifs of four up-and-down antiparallel β-strands, which are arranged around a pseudo seven-fold axis, giving a seven-bladed propeller. The N- and C-terminal β-strands of each blade are located on the inner and outer side, respectively, of the β-propeller, and the C-terminal strand is connected to the N-terminal strand of the neighboring blade. The β-propeller fold has also been observed in galactose oxidase (25Ito N. Phillips S.E. Stevens C. Ogel Z.B. McPherson M.J. Keen J.N. Yadav K.D. Knowles P.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) and in quinoproteins such as TTQ-containing methylamine dehydrogenase (27Chen L. Doi M. Durley R.C. Chistoserdov A.Y. Lidstrom M.E. Davidson V.L. Mathews F.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and PQQ-dependent glucose (28Oubrie A. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Duine J.A.

Biol. 2000; 297: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) dehydrogenases. A structure similarity search (31Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) showed that the large β-propeller subunit of methylamine dehydrogenase is quite similar to the β-subunit of QH-AmDH. The most surprising finding revealed by this work concerns the structure of the small γ-subunit. As deduced from the DNA sequence (10Vandenberghe I. Kim J.-K. Devreese B. Hacisalihoglu A. Iwabuki H. Okajima T. Kuroda S. Adachi O. Jongejan J.A. Duine J.A. Tanizawa K. Van Beeumen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42923-42931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), this 79-residue subunit contains a total of four Cys and five Trp residues. However, neither free SH groups nor S-S bridges were detected in it by chemical analysis (10Vandenberghe I. Kim J.-K. Devreese B. Hacisalihoglu A. Iwabuki H. Okajima T. Kuroda S. Adachi O. Jongejan J.A. Duine J.A. Tanizawa K. Van Beeumen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42923-42931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, during the initial stage of the structure determination by x-ray crystallography, modeling of the γ-subunit puzzled us with its main chain branching off at many points in the electron density map. Complete modeling of the γ-subunit became possible only after the 2Fo − Fcelectron density map was calculated at 1.9-Å resolution using the phases improved on the basis of the models of the α- and β-subunits. The quality of the omit electron density map reached the point at which the side chains were identified from the shape of the electron densities contoured at the 1-ς level. In this stage, the side chains of all the Cys residues in the γ-subunit were found to have unusually close contacts with a Trp, Asp, or Glu residue. For example, the Sγ atom of Cys-37γ was within the covalent bond distance with the indolyl C4 atom of Trp-43γ. Also, extra electron densities were found to protrude from the C6 and C7 positions of the indolyl group of Trp-43γ, which were assigned to oxygen atoms based on the previous finding that the γ-subunit contains a quinone group similar to, but not identical with, TTQ (7Adachi O. Kubota T. Hacisalihoglu A. Toyama H. Shinagawa E. Duine J.A. Matsushita K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Consequently, the crystal structure has revealed that one (Cys-37γ) of the four Cys residues is covalently cross-linked to the side chain of Trp-43γ (at C4 of the indole ring), which is modified to an ortho-quinone, resulting in the novel quinone cofactor CTQ (Figs. 1B and2A). Furthermore, the other three Cys residues are involved in thioether cross-bridges with an Asp or Glu residue, all in a hitherto unknown bonding with a methylene carbon atom of acidic amino acid side chains: Cys-7γ–Glu-16γ (Cγ) (Fig.2B), Cys-27γ–Asp-33γ (Cβ) (Fig. 2A), and Cys-41γ–Asp-49γ (Cβ) (Fig. 2C). Crystallographic identification of these cross-linked structures greatly enabled us to interpret the results obtained by the chemical and mass spectrometric analyses of the γ-subunit, as reported recently (10Vandenberghe I. Kim J.-K. Devreese B. Hacisalihoglu A. Iwabuki H. Okajima T. Kuroda S. Adachi O. Jongejan J.A. Duine J.A. Tanizawa K. Van Beeumen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42923-42931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Besides the novel CTQ cofactor encaged by multiple internal cross-bridges, another intriguing feature is that the γ-subunit scarcely contains regular secondary structures as it has only two short α-helices with many turns and bends (Fig. 1B). A schematically drawn structure of the γ-subunit (Fig. 2D) reminds us of peptide antibiotics with an internal loop rather than of a protein. Indeed, in a structure similarity search using the DALI calculation (31Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar), no structure with Z scores of higher than 2.0 was found, indicating that the polypeptide fold of the γ-subunit is unique. It thus appears that the multiple cross-links play at least a structural role in maintaining the globular structure of the small γ-subunit polypeptide. The γ-subunit occupies the space formed between the interface of the α- and β-subunits with 11 N-terminal residues (Ala-3γ, Cys-7γ–Thr-11γ, Val-17γ–Gly-21γ) and 29 C-terminal residues (Met-51γ–Lys-79γ) exposed to the solvent on both sides of the molecule. The three cross-bridges of Cys to Asp or Glu contained in 48 N-terminal residues (Ala-3γ–Met-50γ), together with numerous internal hydrogen bonds, lead to a compact γ-subunit and an encaged CTQ. As compared with the C-terminal part, this region is rich in hydrophobic and acidic residues. CTQ resides in the vicinity of the interface between the β- and γ-subunits and near the pseudo seven-fold axis of the β-subunit, directing its C6 carbonyl group toward the interface. The topology of CTQ, heme I, and heme II (Fig.1B) suggests that intramolecular electron transfer occurs from substrate-reduced CTQ to heme II via heme I followed by intermolecular electron transfer from heme II to azurin (7Adachi O. Kubota T. Hacisalihoglu A. Toyama H. Shinagawa E. Duine J.A. Matsushita K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The fact that the quinone ring of CTQ is separated by about 7.8 Å from the edge of heme I with a dihedral angle of 19° with respect to each plane supports this view. On close inspection of the γ-subunit structure, the active site cavity seems to be located at the interface between the β- and γ-subunits, surrounded by CTQ 43γ, the side chains of Pro-13γ, Asp-33γ, Pro-40γ, and Trp-42γ from the γ-subunit, and the side chains of Leu-198β, Phe-200β, Trp-201β, Phe-258β, Tyr-298β, and Thr-341β from the β-subunit (Fig.3A). Inside the cavity, two water molecules (W1 and W2) are found. A hydrogen-bonding network exists between the C6 carbonyl group of CTQ, the carboxylate group of Asp-33γ, W1, and W2, and the hydroxyl group of Tyr-298β. The N1 nitrogen and C7 carbonyl oxygen of CTQ are hydrogen-bonded to the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Thr-10γ and amide nitrogen atoms of Asp-12γ and Gly-14γ, respectively. To determine the catalytic site of CTQ where substrate amines react (either the C6 or the C7 carbonyl), the structure of enzyme inhibited by pNPH (7Adachi O. Kubota T. Hacisalihoglu A. Toyama H. Shinagawa E. Duine J.A. Matsushita K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was also determined at a 2.0-Å resolution (Tables I and II). The difference Fourier map clearly indicated a positive electron density peak in the active site cavity, which could be modeled nicely by the hydrazone of CTQ with pNPH bound to the C6 position and the phenyl ring accommodated in the hydrophobic cavity, displacing the two water molecules (Fig. 3B). Thus, in the catalytic process, the substrate amine presumably reacts with the C6 carbonyl group of CTQ, forming a Schiff base intermediate similar to the proposed reaction mechanism of TTQ-dependent methylamine dehydrogenase (32Davidson V.L. Davidson V.L. Principles and Applications of Quinoproteins. Marcel Decker, NY1993: 73-95Google Scholar). Because Asp-33γ is the sole residue close enough to the C6 carbonyl oxygen of CTQ and the Schiff base imine nitrogen, it could act as a catalytic base abstracting the α-proton from the CTQ substrate Schiff base. The hydrophobic environment around Asp-33γ could be helpful in raising the pKa value of the carboxylate group, thereby enhancing its catalytic function. It should also be noted that the conformational flexibility of the carboxylate group of Asp-33γ is largely restricted by the cross-link from Cys-27γ to this residue. The unique active site structure of QH-AmDH raises a number of questions: Why, when, where, and how are the CTQ cofactor and the multiple internal cross-links in the γ-subunit generated? In the absence of further information, these questions cannot be answered yet. However, sequencing of the gene cluster encoding QH-AmDH of P. putidahas already provided a clue for how the biogenesis could take place (10Vandenberghe I. Kim J.-K. Devreese B. Hacisalihoglu A.

In the stretch containing the structural genes for the three subunits, a hypothetical 53-kDa protein was found whose sequence is homologous to that of “sulfatase-activating enzyme,” containing an iron/sulfur cluster and participating in the oxidative formation of the formylglycine cofactor in the active site of sulfatase (33Szameit C.

Upon expression of the viral genome, three HIV-1 gene products participate in the removal of the primary viral receptor from the cell surface. To investigate the role of surface-CD4 in HIV replication, we have created a set of Jurkat cell lines which constitutively express surface levels of CD4 comparable to those found in peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes. Expression of low levels of CD4 on the surface of producer cells exerted an inhibitory effect on the infectivity of HIV-1 particles, whereas no differences in the amount of cell-free p24 antigen were observed. Higher levels of cell surface CD4 exerted a stronger inhibitory effect on infectivity, and also affected the release of free virus in experiments where the viral genomes were delivered by electrotransfection. The CD4-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity was not observed in experiments where the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein was used to pseudotype viruses, suggesting that an interaction between CD4 and gp120 is required for interference. In contrast, inhibition of particle release by high levels of cell-surface CD4 was not overcome by pseudotyping HIV-1 with foreign envelope proteins. Protein analysis of viral particles released from HIV-infected Jurkat-T cells revealed a CD4-dependent reduction in the incorporation of gp120. These results demonstrate that physiological levels of cell-surface CD4 interfere with HIV-1 replication in T cells by a mechanism that inhibits envelope incorporation into viral membranes, and therefore provide an explanation for the need to down-modulate the viral receptor in infected cells.

Virol. 1993; 67: 7238-7245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that the combined action of three HIV-1 gene products is required for the nearly complete elimination of CD4 from the cell surface encouraged investigators to examine why HIV has to reduce the cell surface expression of its own receptor. By analogy with other retroviruses, it was first speculated that removal of CD4 from the cell surface would impede superinfection of cells, an event that might augment cytotoxic effects and lead to cell death before productive infection and release of viral particles occurs (20Temin H.M. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1986; 10: 399-405Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Stevenson M. Meier C. Mann A.M. Chapman N. Wasiak A. Cell. 1988; 53: 483-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Although down-modulation of the viral receptor as a way to impede superinfection has been demonstrated in some retroviruses (21Stevenson M. Meier C. Mann A.M. Chapman N. Wasiak A. Cell. 1988; 53: 483-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 22Wang H. Dechant E. Kavanaugh M. North R.A. Kabat D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23617-23624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the short half-life of HIV-infected PBLs would suggest that impeding superinfection confers no physiological advantage to the virus in the periphery. Two recent reports have proposed other explanations for the need to down-modulate CD4 expression. Overexpression of CD4 in HIV-transfected 293T cells leads to the reduction in infectivity (23Lama J. Mangasarian A. Trono D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 622-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and release (24Ross T.M. Oran A.E. Cullen B.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) of HIV-1 particles. Although the precise mechanism of action remains to be elucidated, both groups showed evidence that specific interactions between the CD4 and the viral envelope proteins are required for the inhibitory action of CD4. Pseudotyping of HIV-1 particles with foreign envelope proteins (VSVg or MLV) eliminates the negative effects of CD4. Furthermore, mutant CD4 proteins unable to bind to the envelope protein fail to interfere with HIV replication (23Lama J. Mangasarian A. Trono D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 622-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 24Ross T.M. Oran A.E. Cullen B.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). These experiments were performed in human embryonic kidney cells (293T) which do not resemble the cellular environment found in infection of CD4-positive primary T cells and macrophages. Furthermore, transfected 293T cells may not reflect the physiological levels of CD4 found in the natural targets of infection. For instance, Ross et al. (24Ross T.M. Oran A.E. Cullen B.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) used 293T cells expressing surface CD4 levels 12-fold higher than those found on SupT1 cells, a human T cell line with high levels of surface CD4. Therefore, several issues were raised as to whether physiological levels of surface CD4 would exert a similar effect in T cells (25Harris M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 459-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To investigate the relevance of the CD4-mediated inhibitory effect, we have extended our studies to transformed T cells constitutively expressing specific levels of surface CD4. Our findings demonstrate that physiological levels of surface CD4 interfere in an envelope-dependent manner with the infectivity of HIV-1 particles released from T cells. The parental Jurkat-T cell line used in this study is a CD4-negative derivative of the Jurkat lymphoblastoid cell line (26Weiss A. Wiskocil R.L. Stobo J.D. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 123-128PubMed Google Scholar). Jurkat-T cells express the large T antigen protein from SV40, whose gene is maintained with G418 selection. These cells allow high expression of genes driven from plasmids containing cytomegalovirus promoters. Jurkat-T cells were kindly provided by Dr. N. Coudronniere (La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, San Diego). To construct CD4-positive cells, Jurkat-T cells were transfected with a full-length CD4 expression plasmid and selected with zeocin (0.1 mg/ml) in RPMI medium also containing penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine, Hepes, and 10% fetal calf serum. Two weeks after selection, cells were stained with a phycoerythrin-conjugated CD4 mAb and sorted with a Becton-Dickinson flow cytometry apparatus for high and low surface expression of CD4. After sorting, cells were selected for another week in zeocin (0.1 mg/ml) and G418 (0.2 mg/ml), and frozen in liquid nitrogen until usage. Before use, cells were thawed and grown in the presence of G418 (0.2 mg/ml) for 3–4 days. High-CD4 cells were further purified with CD4 microbeads as specified by the manufacturer (Miltenyi Biotec Inc.). CD4-negative cells were also incubated with CD4 microbeads and purified in the same way, but this time the unbound fraction was collected. Cells were maintained in 0.2 mg/ml G418 for 2–3 additional days before electroporation. Levels of surface CD4 were always monitored before each experiment. CD4 surface levels were maintained constant for at least 10 days after enrichment with microbeads. Stocks of viruses were produced by chemical transfection of the human kidney fibroblastic cell line 293T, or by electroporation of Jurkat-T cells. Jurkat-T cells were electroporated in 2-mm gap cuvettes with a BTX electroporation system set to deliver 20-ms pulses at 150 volts. Twenty-four to thirty-six hours after electroporation supernatant fluids were collected, filtered through 0.45-μm units, and used immediately for infectivity assays. The amount of p24 antigen in supernatant fluids was used to normalize samples containing virus. The levels of p24 antigen were estimated with an enzyme-linked immunoassay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Infectivity assays were performed in either CD4-positive Jurkat-T cells, CEM-GFP, or HeLa P4 reporter cell lines. CEM-GFP is a T-lymphoid cell line with a stably integrated green fluorescent protein gene (GFP) whose expression is driven by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter (27Gervaix A. West D. Leoni L.M. Richman D.D. Wong-Staal F. Corbeil J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4653-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), whereas P4 are HeLa-derived CD4-positive cells expressing the β-galactosidase gene under the control of the HIV promoter (28Charneau P. Mirambeau G. Roux P. Paulous S. Buc H. Clavel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Unless specified, infection of Jurkat-T and CEM-GFP cells were performed following a previously described centrifugation method (29Collins K.L. Chen B.K. Kalams S.A. Walker B.D. Baltimore D. Nature. 1998; 391: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 30O'Doherty U. Swiggard W.J. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10074-10080Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 × 106 cells were incubated with viral supernatants (0.5–1 μg of p24 protein) in 24-well plates in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene and 10 mm Hepes, and centrifuged at room temperature for 90 min (2,500 rpm) in a table-top centrifuge (Sorvall RT6000B). After centrifugation cells were washed and incubated at 37 °C in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Infection of HeLa P4 cells was performed in the presence of 20 μg/ml DEAE dextran. Routinely, after infection of reporter cells 5 μmazidothymidine was added to block new cycles of replication. To collect HIV particles, Jurkat-T cells were electroporated with the proviral construct NL4.3-GFP (kindly provided by Dr. Cohen, Harvard University), or infected with R7HXB2viruses (viral stocks produced from transfected 293T cells). NL4.3-GFP is a replication-competent vector which contains all the HIV proteins including Env and Nef, together with a GFP reporter gene used to monitor infected cells. Nef-deleted versions (NL4.3ΔNef-GFP or R7HXB2ΔNef) were used to study the effect of CD4 down-regulation. In some experiments, additional pseudotyping proteins were provided by co-transfection with the vectors pMDG (31Dull T. Zufferey R. Kelly M. Mandel R.J. Nguyen M. Trono D. Naldini L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8463-8471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (encoding VSVg) or pMLV (encoding the amphotropic MLV envelope protein) (32Naldini L. Blomer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (4018) Google Scholar). Expression of CD4 in 293T cells was achieved with the pCMX-CD4 plasmid (23Lama J. Mangasarian A. Trono D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 622-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Labeled cells were routinely fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde after staining and analyzed in a FACScalibur system (Becton-Dickinson) running with the CellQuest software program. CD4 surface expression was analyzed by staining with the OKT4 mAb, followed by goat anti-mouse Cy5-conjugated antibodies (CalTag Laboratories). The epitope recognized by the OKT4 mAb does not overlap with the gp120-binding domain (33Saggioro D. Sorio C. Calderazzo F. Calleagro L. Panozzo M. Berton G. Chieco-Bianchi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1368-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). OKT4 was routinely purified in our laboratory from the precipitates of ascites fluids saturated with ammonium sulfate. Intracellular staining of p24 was performed with the IntraStain kit following the recommendations of the manufacturer (DAKO) using a p24-specific mAb (KAL-1, from DAKO) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (DAKO). To examine virion-associated proteins, particles were pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion at 26,000 rpm in a SW28 rotor (Beckman) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The liquid was aspirated and the walls of the tube wiped before resuspending the pellet. Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and remaining sucrose was washed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm (4 °C for 90 min) in a table-top Eppendorf Microfuge. These pellets were resuspended in 100–200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Equal amounts of p24 protein were separated in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, probed with specific antibodies, and then revealed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.). HIV-1-specific antibodies were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Program (NIH-ARRP). Envelope incorporation was estimated with a gp120-specific sheep antiserum, whereas p24 levels were analyzed with the 183-H12-5C mAb. Western blot analysis of CD4 was performed with the T4-4 antiserum (NIH-ARRP). The CD4 protein is essential for entry of CD4-dependent HIV strains into target cells (34Bour S. Geleziunas R. Wainberg M.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 63-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of CD4 after viral entry remains controversial. To investigate the role of CD4 during HIV replication we engineered a set of Jurkat cell lines expressing different levels of surface CD4. By utilizing Jurkat-T cell lines that differed solely in the levels of expression of CD4 we minimized the contribution of unknown factors, which might vary among different T cell lines. CD4-positive cells were derived from a Jurkat cell line constitutively expressing the SV40 large T antigen. This modification was needed to achieve levels of CD4 expression comparable with those found in CD4-positive lymphocytes. Jurkat-T cells were then transfected with a CD4 expression plasmid (pCMX-CD4), selected with 0.1 mg/ml zeocin, and subjected to magnetic separation based on their levels of surface CD4. After magnetic separation, Jurkat-CD4 cells were grown for 2–3 days and stained with a CD4-specific mAb (OKT4) to estimate surface expression (Fig.1). The mean values of their fluorescence intensities (m.f.) were estimated and compared with the levels found in CD4-positive peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and monocytes stained in parallel. Jurkat-T high-CD4 cells expressed levels of surface CD4 10-fold higher than low-CD4 cells (m.f. 296 versus 28). CD4 surface levels on Jurkat-T low-CD4 cells were comparable with the levels found in monocytes (m.f. 39), whereas expression in high-CD4 cells was 106% higher than in CD4-positive PBLs and 28% higher than in SupT1 cells. These analyses show that surface levels of CD4 in these cell lines fairly reflect the levels of expression observed in the natural targets of HIV infection. Two days after sorting Jurkat-T cells were subjected to electroporation with proviral constructs (Fig. 2). We used a proviral vector (NL4.3-GFP) encoding a GFP reporter gene that allowed us to readily monitor HIV producer cells. NL4.3-GFP is a replication competent vector that encodes all the HIV-1 proteins, including Env, Vpu, and Nef. The nef gene is expressed from a bicistronic RNA in which translation is driven by an internal ribosomal entry site (2Chen B.K. Gandhi R.T. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6044-6053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NL4.3-GFP down-modulates MHC class I protein to an extent similar to the parental wild-type virus (35Cohen G. Gandhi R. Davis D.M. Mandelboim O. Chen B. Strominger J. Baltimore D. Immunity. 1999; 10: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Twenty hours after electroporation, cells were stained with the CD4-specific OKT4 mAb and the level of surface CD4 in GFP-positive cells was analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2). Interestingly, expression of the complete set of HIV genes was needed to achieve maximal down-modulation of CD4. In fact, even the entire set of CD4 down-modulating genes present in wild-type viruses (env, vpu, andnef) did not achieve complete removal of CD4 from the surface of producer cells. This fact was observed even in Jurkat-T cells expressing low levels of surface CD4, but was more evident in high-CD4 cells, where the CD4-specific fluorescence signal was significantly above that observed in CD4-negative cells or in CD4-positive cells stained with isotype-matched control antibodies (Fig. 2B). The requirement of the nef gene for efficient CD4 down-modulation was confirmed in low- and high-CD4 cells. A NL4.3ΔNef-GFP vector lacking the nef gene showed a significant defect in the ability to down-modulate CD4. This defect was more evident in high-CD4 cells, where more than 50% of the HIV producer cells did not show significant reductions in surface CD4. These results strongly support the idea that down-modulation of surface CD4 requires a complete set of HIV down-modulator genes, and that this function may be saturated at physiological levels of CD4.Figure 2CD4 surface levels in Jurkat-T cells expressing HIV proteins. Jurkat-T cells expressing either low (panel A) or high (panel B) surface CD4 were electroporated with 20 μg of a proviral construct (NL4.3-GFP, indicated as wild-type) or its Nef-defective version (NL4.3ΔNef-GFP, shown as ΔNef). Twenty hours after electroporation cells were stained with a CD4-specific mAb (OKT4) and the levels of surface CD4 were analyzed by flow cytometry. The histograms show the fluorescence in GFP-positive cells transfected with either wild-type virus (solid line) or the Nef-defective version (filled histogram). Levels of surface CD4 in untransfected cells (GFP-negative cells from the same electroporation) are shown as thin line histograms. Staining with isotype-matched antibody is also shown (dotted lines).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Twenty-four hours after electroporation, viruses were collected from the supernatant and their infectivity assessed in Jurkat-T low-CD4 cells. Target cells were infected with viruses produced either in the absence of CD4, or with low- or high-CD4 surface levels. The number of GFP-positive cells was estimated by flow cytometry 24 h after infection. First, we wanted to assure that the relationship between the number of GFP-positive cells and the input virus was linear. Target cells were exposed to different amounts of viral supernatant and the infectivity assessed. As shown in Fig. 3, the relationship between the number of GFP-positive cells and the added volume was linear. The infectivity titer obtained in the linear range of the curve was 1,260 GFP-positive cells/ng of p24 capsid protein. Therefore, this parameter can be used to estimate the infectivity titer of viral supernatants. Infections described below were analyzed within the linear range observed in Fig. 3. In Fig.4A, the infectivity of HIV particles released from producer cells expressing different levels of surface CD4 was analyzed. Expression of CD4 in Jurkat-T cells reduced the infectivity of HIV, as compared with particles produced in CD4-negative cell cultures. Interestingly, the infectivity of wild-type particles released from low-CD4 cells was inhibited by 75%. These results suggest that residual CD4 levels found in the surface of low-CD4 cells transfected with wild-type particles (Fig. 2A) are sufficient to diminish HIV infectivity. The infectivity of wild-type particles released from high-CD4 cells was decreased by 90%. The inhibitory effect of CD4 was also revealed in Nef-deleted viruses. In these viruses infectivity was reduced by 95% when released from high CD4-expressor cells (Fig. 4A). It is important to note that expression of surface CD4 in high-CD4 cells was not homogenous. About 10–13% of the culture showed levels of surface CD4 comparable with those in low-CD4 cells (see Fig. 1). Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the low number of infectious particles released from the high-CD4 cultures are indeed produced from these low expressor cells. Attempts to remove these low-CD4 contaminant cells by further rounds of purification were not successful. To determine the specificity of the results, cells were electroporated with a mixture of NL4.3-GFP proviral vector and a plasmid encoding the VSVg envelope glycoprotein (pMDG). Co-expression of VSVg allowed mixed pseudotyping of HIV particles and abrogated the CD4 inhibitory effect even in cells expressing high surface levels of the HIV receptor (Fig. 4A). Therefore, expression of CD4 does not compromise the ability of the cells to produce fully infectious HIV particles if pseudotyped with an heterologous envelope. The CD4-inhibitory effects were revealed only when HIV enters into cells via its own envelope. To a lesser extent, co-expression of the amphotropic MLV envelope also overcame the CD4-mediated inhibitory effect. The partial recovery observed in high-CD4 cells is likely due to the lower efficiency of MLV-pseudotyping, as compared with VSVg pseudotypes, and the fact that a fraction of the mixed pseudotyped particles may still enter into cells using CD4 as receptor. Under the experimental conditions used above, VSVg-pseudotyped particles were 10-fold more infectious than either HIV- or MLV-pseudotyped particles (for absolute values see Fig.5).Figure 4Surface CD4 interferes with the infectivity and release of HIV. Jurkat-T cells expressing no CD4, low-CD4, or high levels of surface CD4 (see Fig. 1) were electroporated with 20 μg of a proviral construct (NL4.3-GFP) alone, or in the presence of either a VSVg expression vector (VSV) or a plasmid encoding the amphotropic envelope from Moloney leukemia virus (MLV). Samples electroporated with a wild-type version of the NL4.3-GFP vector are shown as “WT.” Those transfected with the NL4.3ΔNef-GFP construct are indicated as “ΔNef.” Twenty hours after electroporation, the cells were separated by centrifugation and the infectivity of the viral supernatants was determined by infecting Jurkat-T low-CD4 cells and scoring the number of GFP-positive cells by flow cytometry (panel A). In panel B, the amount of cell-free virus released was estimated with an immunocapture assay for the p24 capsid antigen. Data are presented as the percentage value found in CD4-negative cells.

Jurkat-T cells expressing either no-CD4 or high levels of surface CD4 (producer cells) were electroporated with a wild-type NL4.3-GFP proviral construct (“WT,” panels A, C,E, and G) or with a Nef-defective one (“ΔNef,” panels B, D, F, andH). Some of the electroporation mixtures also contained a plasmid encoding VSVg (“VSV,” panels C,D, G, and H).

Significant progress has been made in recent years concerning the hepatic formation and secretion of apoB100-containing very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) (1Rustaeus S. Lindberg K. Stillemark P.

Studies with primary rat hepatocytes and the rat hepatoma cell line McA-RH7777 have allowed investigators to characterize the assembly of lipoproteins with either full-length apoB100 or with apoB48, which in humans is only expressed in the intestine. Studies of B48-VLDL have indicated that it is assembled via two discontinuous lipidation steps in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (4Boren J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Innerarity T.L. Boren J. Yamanaka S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol.

In the first step, apoB48 is associated with a small amount of lipid to form a primordial particle with high buoyant density. These high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles (designated B48-HDL) may be secreted from the cells if further lipid recruitment does not occur. Alternatively, the B48-HDL particle can undergo a second lipidation step, expanding its lipid content, primarily triglyceride, to form apoB48-VLDL. This conversion of B48-HDL into B48-VLDL is associated with increased synthesis of cellular lipid. The assembly of apoB100-VLDL also appears to involve a two-step pathway in McA-RH7777 cells (4Boren J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rustaeus S. Lindberg K. Boren J. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol.

ApoB100-HDL, however, are mostly degraded intracellularly in McA-RH7777 cells in the absence of adequate lipid to stimulate their conversion to VLDL. Furthermore, characterization of each discrete stage of apoB100-VLDL formation in McA-RH777 cells has been much less well developed than it has been for apoB48-VLDL formation (6Stillemark P. Boren J.

It is also unclear if, in the presence of oleic acid, the assembly of apoB100-VLDL in HepG2 cells occurs in a single or a two-step process. The assembly of apoB100-lipoproteins requires the initial translocation of apoB100 across the ER membrane, during which apoB100 interacts with a number of molecular chaperones, including Hsp70 in the cytosol, calnexin in the ER membrane, and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) in the ER lumen (9Zhou M.

In the course of translocation, the hydrophobic apoB100 polypeptide is lipidated via an MTP-dependent process. Mutations that inactivate or abolish MTP activity are associated with the syndrome of abetalipoproteinemia, an almost total absence of apoB100-containing lipoproteins in the plasma (14Sharp D. Blinderman L. Combs K.A. Kienzle B. Ricci B. Wager-Smith K. Gil C.M. Turck C.W. Bouma M.E. Rader D.J. Aggerbeck P.L. Gregg R.E. Gordon D.A. Wetterau J.R.

Additionally, in liver-derived cells, inactivation of MTP with MTP-specific inhibitors abolishes the initial translocation of apoB100 across the ER, resulting in degradation of the nascent protein and absent secretion (16Haghpassand M.

The role of MTP in the later, second-step lipidation of apoB100 is, however, much less certain. Thus, despite general agreement that MTP activity is required for efficient, initial translocation of apoB100 across the ER membrane in cultured cells (18Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Sharp D. Mullaney D.

We have demonstrated previously that, in HepG2 cells, assembly and secretion of nascent (radiolabeled) apoB100-lipoproteins were not impaired by an MTP inhibitor if the inhibitor was added 60 min after the cells were pulse-labeled and then chased in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor (22Mitchell D.M. Zhou M. Pariyarah R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Fisher E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14733-14738Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, if MTP was inhibited immediately after radiolabeling, assembly, and secretion of apoB100-lipoproteins were almost completely abolished. On the basis of these data, we speculated that there probably exists a window of time after the initiation of translation during which the dependence of apoB100 upon MTP for secretion diminishes. A similar model had been proposed for the formation and secretion of apoB48-VLDL in McA-RH7777 cells (8Rustaeus S. Stillemark P. Lindberg K. Gordon D. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5196-5203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to extend our previous observation and explore, in detail, the role of MTP, as well as that of newly synthesized TG, in the assembly and subsequent secretion of apoB100-VLDL in both HepG2 and McA-RH7777 cells. N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal(ALLN), dimethyl sulfoxide, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free) were purchased from Sigma. MTP inhibitors (CP-10447, BMS-197636-01 and BMS-200150) were generous gifts of Pfizer Inc. (CP-), and Bristol-Squibb (BMS-), respectively. Sheep anti-human apoB100 polyclonal antibodies were from Roche. [3H]glycerol and [35S]methionine/cysteine were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Minimum essential medium (MEM) was purchased from Invitrogen. HepG2 cells and McA-RH7777 cells, obtained from ATCC, were grown in six-well plates coated with collagen. HepG2 cells were maintained in MEM containing 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum. McA RH7777 cells were maintained in DMEM containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 10% fetal bovine, and 10% horse serum (Invitrogen). The medium was changed to experimental serum-free MEM containing 1.5% BSA, and other compounds. Subconfluent HepG2 cells were preincubated in serum-free MEM containing 1.5% BSA for 1 h, followed by pretreatment with serum-free MEM containing 1.5% BSA and 40 μg/ml ALLN for 1 h, and then labeled with Eagle's MEM containing BSA, ALLN, and 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine for 20 min. Pulse labeling was followed by two chase periods, chase I (0–90 min) and chase II (150 min). New medium was used for chase II. Besides BSA and ALLN, chase medium contained 10 mm methionine and 3 mmcysteine. Medium was collected at the indicated times and used for either immunoprecipitation, lipid extraction, or sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. Cells were either lysed for immunoprecipitation or treated for lipid extraction. Subconfluent McA RH7777 cells were preincubated in serum-free DMEM containing 1.5% BSA for 2 h, followed by pretreatment with serum-free MEM containing 1.5% BSA and 40 μg/ml ALLN for 1 h, and then labeled with Eagle's MEM containing BSA, ALLN, and 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine for 20 min. Pulse labeling was followed by two chase periods, chase I (60 min) and chase II (60 min) with serum-free DMEM containing 1.5% BSA and 40 μg/ml ALLN. After chase II, medium was collected for sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation and analyzed by immunoprecipitation as discussed below. Media were transferred to tubes containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (PI) (30 μl/ml, PI: 1 mm benzamidine, 5 mm EDTA, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0) and 0.86 mm freshly added phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cells were harvested with homogenization buffer (62.5 mm sucrose, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and PI). Immunoprecipitation of apoB100 in medium or cellular lysate was carried out according to the method of Dixon et al. (23Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein A-Sepharose CL4B was added to the reaction solution to precipitate apoB100, which was released with sample buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol) by boiling for 5 min. Samples were resolved with SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was treated with Autofluor (National Diagnostic, Atlanta, GA) and, after drying, exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-Omat AR) at −70 °C. Protein bands, as visualized by fluorography, were cut out for liquid scintillation counting. Labeled cells were washed with cold PBS and then extracted with hexane/isopropanol (3/2, v/v) (1.5–2 ml/well) at room temperature for 2 h (24Furukawa S. Sakata N. Ginsberg H.N. Dixon J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22630-22638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extraction solution was collected, and the remaining cellular proteins were lysed with 0.1 n NaOH. The media were extracted with 20 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v) at room temperature for 2 h. Then five volumes of H2O were added to the mixture, which was then spun for 5 min at 2,000 rpm. The lower organic phase was carefully transferred to a new tube. The organic solvent was dried under a stream of N2 gas. The lipid content of the cells and/or the media was re-suspended in a small volume of hexane and applied to plastic thin layer chromatography plate, which was developed in hexane-ethyl ether-glacial acetic acid (70/30/1, v/v/v). The lipid spots were visualized with iodine vapor and analyzed with liquid scintillation counting. The cellular protein levels were determined with a Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit. The method was modified from Rustaeus et al. (8Rustaeus S. Stillemark P. Lindberg K. Gordon D. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5196-5203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, pulse-chased HepG2 or McA-RH7777 cells were washed and harvested with cold PBS. The cell pellets were further washed once with cold 150 mmsucrose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and finally re-suspended and homogenized 10 times with a pre-chilled Dounce homogenizer in 3 ml of cold buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 40 μg/ml ALLN, 30 μl/ml PI, and 150 μg/ml freshly added PMSF. The homogenate was spun at 1,900 × g for 10 min at 4 °C; the supernatant was further spun at 50,000 rpm (Beckman TL-100) for 60 min at 4 °C to precipitate the microsomes. Microsome pellets were re-dissolved in 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4 (containing 5 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 40 μg/ml ALLN, 30 μl/ml PI, 150 μg/ml freshly added PMSF) so as to get an approximate concentration of 1 mg/ml protein. 1 ml of microsomes was mixed with 1 ml 250 mm sucrose in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 ml of 0.0625% deoxycholate in PBS, and 0.5 ml of 0.1 sodium carbonate, with final pH 10.5. The mixture was incubated for 25 min at room temperature. To improve recovery of radiolabeled apoB100, albumin was added to get a final concentration of 0.75%, and the incubation was extended for 5 min. The mixture was then adjusted to contain 12.5% sucrose, 1× PBS, and 150 mm NaCl for sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of apoB-containing lipoproteins were conducted as described by Boren et al. (4Boren J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the sucrose gradient was formed by layering from the bottom of the tube: 2 ml of 47% sucrose, 2 ml of 25% sucrose, 5 ml of sample in 12.5% sucrose, and 3 ml of PBS. All solutions contained 0.1 mm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 0.86 mm PMSF, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 5 μm ALLN, 5 μm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm PBS, pH 7.4. The gradients were spun at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman SW40 rotor for 65 h at 12 °C, then unloaded into 12 fractions. Previous studies in our laboratories revealed that, in HepG2 cells, if apoB100 degradation by the proteasome was prevented by inhibitors such as ALLN or lactacystin, nascent apoB100 could be found associated with the translocon for a prolonged period of time (as long as 2 h) after translation should have been completed (22Mitchell D.M. Zhou M. Pariyarah R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Fisher E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14733-14738Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Additionally, despite being physically close to Sec61 (the major translocon protein) as determined by cross-linking studies, and being significantly ubiquitinated, apoB100 could be secreted rapidly after stimulation of cellular lipid synthesis with oleic acid. Finally, in those studies, we observed that, after a 1–2-h chase period (which was enabled by the use of proteasome inhibitors), apoB100 secretion appeared to be independent of MTP (22Mitchell D.M. Zhou M. Pariyarah R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Fisher E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14733-14738Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). On the basis of these data, in the present study, we conducted additional experiments to 1) confirm our prior observation that apoB100 secretion could be independent of MTP activity, 2) determine the role of TG synthesis in the MTP-independent secretion of apoB100, and 3) characterize the type of lipoprotein assembled and secreted when secretion is MTP-independent. Because HepG2 cells only secrete a modest proportion of their apoB100-lipoproteins as VLDL, we also conducted studies in McA-RH7777 cells. We carried out all of the following studies using ALLN to prevent the rapid co-translational degradation of nascent apoB100 that can typically occur in cultured liver cells so as to allow the detailed exploration of late assembly and secretion events. We realize that much of the apoB100 we are measuring in the studies described below would normally (in the absence of ALLN) have been degraded co-translationally. However, we strongly believe that these apoB100 molecules are no different, in terms of their intracellular transport, from the apoB100 molecules that escape proteasomal degradation and are secreted from the cells. Indeed, in a preliminary experiment in which McA-RH7777 cells were studied in the absence of ALLN, addition of an MTP inhibitor immediately after radiolabeling of the cells resulted in an 85% reduction in apoB secretion over the next 2 h compared with control cells without MTP inhibitor. In contrast, addition of an MTP inhibitor 60 min after radiolabeling only reduced apoB secretion by 30% over the next 2 h (data not shown). These results indicate clearly that use of ALLN in the studies described below, although making it easier to conduct the studies (by increasing the amount of apoB secreted from the cells), did not alter the processes we were investigating. Fig. 1 depicts the general protocol used in the studies to be described. To fully characterize the time frame during which assembly and secretion of apoB100-lipoproteins changes from an MTP-dependent to an MTP-independent process, we designed a protocol with two chase periods. Subconfluent HepG2 cells were first pre-incubated with 1.5% BSA for 60 min and then treated with both BSA and ALLN for an additional 60 min prior to radiolabeling. ALLN was present throughout the remainder of the protocol. After 20 min of radiolabeling with [35S]methionine/cysteine, there were two chase periods, I and II. Chase I varied from 0 to 90 min (see Fig. 1). No MTP inhibitor was applied in chase I. Chase I medium was replaced by new medium with or without 25 μm Pfizer MTP inhibitor CP-10447, and chase II was carried out for an additional 150 min. The chase II medium was collected to determine 35S-labeled apoB100 secretion in the presence or absence of MTP-inhibition. The data are presented as apoB100 secreted during chase II in the presence of the MTP inhibitor as a percentage of the apoB100 secreted during chase II in the absence of the MTP inhibitor; each data point differs by the length of chase I (0–90 min). We found (Fig. 2A) that if chase I was 0 min (i.e. the medium was changed immediately after radiolabeling), then apoB100 secretion in the presence of CP-10447 during the succeeding 150-min chase II was only 24.1 ± 0.8% of that measured for control cells not treated with CP-10447 during chase II. However, as the duration of chase I progressively increased, i.e. up to 90 min, apoB100 secretion during chase II, in the presence of CP-10447, increased linearly to 50.2 ± 1.4%, 55.9 ± 2.0%, 64.5 ± 5.1%, 69.2 ± 6.1%, 75.6 ± 7.1%, and 85.0 ± 7.6% of the secretion rate of the control cells that were untreated during chase II. In other words, inhibition of apoB100 secretion during chase II decreased from ∼76%, if the MTP inhibitor was added immediately after labeling (i.e., chase I was 0 min), to only 15%, if the MTP inhibitor was added 90 min after labeling (Fig. 2B). We also used a higher dose of CP-10447, i.e. 50 μm, and obtained very similar results (data not shown). This experiment indicated that an MTP inhibitor gradually loses its effect on the assembly and secretion of apoB100-lipoproteins when it is added to the media at longer and longer times after the synthesis of apoB100 has been initiated. Based on our recent studies (22Mitchell D.M. Zhou M. Pariyarah R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Fisher E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14733-14738Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 25Pariyarath R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Johnson A.E. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 541-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (80) Google Scholar), when chase I was 60 min or greater, most newly synthesized apoB100 in these HepG2 cells would be almost fully translated, but would still be associated with the translocon, ribosomes, Hsp70, and the proteasome. It appears that this is the pool of apoB100 that has lost its dependence on MTP activity for secretion. These data are similar to those reported by Rustaeus et al.(8Rustaeus S. Stillemark P. Lindberg K. Gordon D. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5196-5203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) using brefeldin A (BFA) to inhibit lipoprotein assembly in McA-RH7777 cells during an initial chase period. In that study, the authors found that inhibition of MTP within 15 min of labeling resulted in a marked decrease in apoB100 secretion, but that this effect was significantly reduced if MTP was inhibited after longer chase periods. Their protocol differed from ours in that they used BFA to inhibit the movement of nascent apoB100 from the ER membrane into the ER lumen. The mechanism whereby BFA reversibly inhibits the assembly of apoB100-lipoproteins is unclear, although a recent report from the same group suggests that BFA-mediated inhibition of intracellular vesicular trafficking may be important (26Asp L. Claesson C. Boren J. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26285-26292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although published data suggested that CP-10447 did not inhibit TG synthesis in HepG2 cells (16Haghpassand M. Wilder D. Moberly J.B. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1468-1480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we observed during the present studies that CP-10447 did inhibit TG synthesis in HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were preincubated with 1.5% BSA for 60 min, then labeled for 2 h with 10 μCi/ml [3H]glycerol in the presence of increasing doses of CP-10447. The results in Fig.3 demonstrate that synthesis of TG was significantly inhibited by CP-10447 at a concentration of 25 μm, which also effectively inhibited apoB100 secretion (see Fig. 2A, chase I; 0 min). This effect of CP-10447 appeared to be specific, as there was no concomitant inhibition of phospholipid synthesis during these experiments (data not shown). Furthermore, the inhibition of TG synthesis by CP-10447 was dose-dependent. We also labeled HepG2 cells in the presence of 25 μm CP-10447 for 1–6 h, finding that this agent significantly inhibited TG synthesis during that entire time course (data not shown). Because CP-10447 inhibits both MTP lipid transfer activity (referred to as “MTP activity”) (16Haghpassand M. Wilder D. Moberly J.B. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1468-1480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and TG synthesis (Fig. 3), we studied other drugs, which inhibited either MTP activity only or TG synthesis only. We chose the Bristol Myers Squibb MTP inhibitor, BMS-197636-01, which only inhibits MTP activity (27Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and the fatty acyl-CoA synthetase inhibitor, triacsin C, which inhibits only TG synthesis (28Igai R.A. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We followed the general protocol depicted in Fig. 1, but chose the two extremes of chase I: 0 or 90 min. In addition, [3H]glycerol was added to the media in chase II to determine the role of newly synthesized TG under each condition. The results, depicted in Fig. 4A, showed that if chase I was 0 min, CP-10447 (25 μm) not only reduced apoB100 secretion in chase II (24.7 ± 1.3% of control cells not treated with CP-10447 during chase II), it also reduced cellular TG synthesis (22.3 ± 2.1% of control) and secretion of newly synthesized TG (20.0 ± 2.0% of control) during chase II. By comparison, although BMS-197636-01 (0.1 μm), when added after a chase I of 0 min, similarly reduced the secretion of both apoB100 (26.1 ± 0.1% of control) and newly synthesized TG (26.1 ± 4.1% versus control) during chase II, it did not affect TG synthesis during chase II at all (114.8 ± 6.8% of control). When triacsin C (4 μm) was added after a 0-min chase I, it acted like CP-10447 and reduced apoB100 secretion (46.1 ± 7.4% of control), TG synthesis (49.2 ± 6.6% of control), and secretion of newly synthesized TG (62.1 ± 4.9% of control) during chase II. These studies demonstrated that inhibition of either MTP activity or TG synthesis (or both) during the co-translational and early stages of apoB100-lipoprotein assembly (chase I equal to 0 min) results in significant inhibition of both apoB100 and TG secretion. Furthermore, inhibition of TG secretion during chase II was observed with the MTP inhibitors whether or not they inhibited TG synthesis. In sharp contrast, if chase I was 90 min (Fig.4B), none of the three reagents, CP-10447, BMS-197636-01, or triacsin C, significantly impaired apoB100 secretion during chase II: Inhibition was only 16.0, 19.2, and 13.9%, respect"

To investigate the role of these lipids in regulating Golgi structure and function, we developed a novel assay to follow the release of post-Golgi vesicles. Isolated rat liver Golgi membranes were incubated with [3H]CMP sialic acid to radiolabel endogenous soluble and membrane glycoproteins present in the late Golgi and trans-Golgi network. The release of post-Golgi secretory vesicles was determined by measuring incorporation of 3H-labeled proteins into a medium speed supernatant. Vesicle budding was dependent on temperature, cytosol, energy and time. Electron microscopy of Golgi fractions prior to and after incubation demonstrated that the stacked Golgi cisternae generated a heterogeneous population of vesicles (50- to 350-nm diameter). Inhibition of phospholipase D-mediated PA synthesis, by incubation with 1-butanol, resulted in the complete fragmentation of the Golgi membranes in vitro into 50- to 100-nm vesicles; this correlated with diminished PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis. Following alcohol washout, PA synthesis resumed and in the presence of cytosol PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis was restored. Most significantly, under these conditions the fragmented Golgi elements reformed into flattened cisternae and the re-assembled Golgi supported vesicle release. These data demonstrate that inositol phospholipid synthesis is essential for the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus.

Science. 1975; 189: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2338) Google Scholar). In the past decade significant progress has been made in characterizing different classes of coat proteins, which function at various steps of the pathway (2Springer S. Schekman R. Science. 1998; 281: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Transport vesicles interact with at least two distinct types of protein complex; those involved in vesicle formation and budding from donor organelles, e.g. coatomer; COP-I and -II; and those facilitating vesicle targeting to and fusion with the correct acceptor membranes (SNAREs)1 (3Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Several ancillary proteins, including members of the Rab family of small GTP-binding proteins interact with specific vesicles to regulate steps in the transfer process: targeting, docking, and fusion (4Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent theories have suggested that the Rab-related proteins in conjunction with SNAREs may play a key role in regulating the specificity of vesicle interactions (5Pelham H.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 99-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition to the Rabs, another family of GTP-binding proteins, ARFs (ADP-ribosylation factors) recruit COP-I and -II coat complexes as well as clathrin adaptors (6Roth M.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 174-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,7Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. Curr. Opin.

Considerable evidence has demonstrated that, in addition to the aforementioned components, inositol phospholipids play a key role in controlling vesicle transport from the Golgi apparatus and in regulating various steps in endocytosis in mammalian and yeast cells (12De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Several laboratories have shown that ARFs may regulate vesicle trafficking, in part by effecting changes in phospholipid metabolism (6Roth M.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 174-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that ARF1 and -6 recruit phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase β to Golgi membranes and Type-Iα phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase to the plasma membrane, respectively (13Godi A. Pertile P. Meyers R. Di Marra P. Tullio G. Iurisci C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 55Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T.

It is likely that different phosphatidylinositol kinase isoforms function in regulating the level of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) in the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane as well as in other membranes. An initial link between phospholipid metabolism and ARFs came from earlier observations from several laboratories (6Roth M.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 174-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It was shown that ARF1 activates a phospholipase D activity (14Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Phospholipase D hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to generate phosphatidic acid (PA), which stimulates the synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2as well as promoting COP-1 binding to membranes (6Roth M.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 174-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and release of nascent secretory vesicles from the TGN (18Chen Y.G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Additionally, our data demonstrated that PA stimulation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis is required for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the Golgi apparatus (19Siddhanta A. Backer J.M. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12023-12031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Treatment of growth hormone-secreting rat pituitary GH3 cells with 1-BtOH led to the synthesis of phosphatidyl butanol rather than PA as a result of the transphosphatidylation activity of PLD. Under these conditions hormone secretion was inhibited, in part, due to diminished PtdIns(4,5)P2synthesis, which resulted in quantitative fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus. Upon alcohol removal, the Golgi apparatus structure was restored and hormone secretion resumed. In contrast to these results, other investigators have suggested that ARF-activated PLD does not function in mediating PtdIns(4,5)P2 biosynthesis in the Golgi apparatus or in COP-I recruitment (13Godi A. Pertile P. Meyers R. Di Marra P. Tullio G. Iurisci C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 20Jones D.H. Morris J.B.

To understand further the mechanism by which polyphosphoinositide synthesis functions in regulating the structural organization of the Golgi apparatus, we have now utilized a novel assay system to follow the release of radiolabeled endogenous glycoproteins into post-Golgi vesicles in vitro. To this end, we exploited previous observations (22Sommers L.W. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10811-10817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Varki A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 16-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that specific nucleotide sugar transporters and sialyl transferase enzymes, which localize to late Golgi cisternae and the TGN, can incorporate radiolabeled nucleotide sugars into endogenous cargo molecules efficiently (22Sommers L.W. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10811-10817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Perez M. Hirschberg C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our rationale was to use purified rat liver Golgi membranes labeled with radioactive sialic acid to follow the release of soluble and membrane glycoproteins from the TGN into post-Golgi vesicles in response to changes in PA and PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis. In agreement with our earlier findings, vesicle budding was stimulated by exogenously added bacterial PLD and addition of 1-butanol resulted in complete fragmentation of Golgi cisternae (18Chen Y.G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 19Siddhanta A. Backer J.M. Shields D.

Strikingly, following alcohol washout, PA and PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis resumed, and the fragmented Golgi reformed into its characteristic flattened cisternae in vitro. Most significantly, the re-assembled Golgi apparatus was able to support nascent vesicle release. Our results demonstrate that inositol phospholipid synthesis is essential for maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus. The following antibodies were used: monoclonal antibody 1D9 against ARF1 was provided by Dr. R. Kahn. A rabbit antibody to PLD1, designated P1–P4, was generated using four peptides specific to human PLD1 and has been described previously (17Freyberg Z. Sweeney D. Siddhanta A. Bourgoin S. Frohman M. Shields D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 25Bourgoin S. Harbour D. Desmarais Y. Takai Y. Beaulieu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3172-3178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody to TGN38 was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO; monoclonal anti-Rab5 was obtained from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, NY. Rabbit antibodies were as follows: to calnexin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; to α1-antitrypsin (from Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA); and to transferrin (from Cappel, Aurora, OH). Rabbit anti-connexin43 was a gift of Dr. Eliot Hertzberg, Albert Einstein College of Medicine; rabbit anti-Tom20 was a gift from Dr. Gordon Shore, McGill University. Bacterial PLD (Streptomyces chromofuscus) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Rat liver Golgi membranes were isolated using a modification of the procedure of Slusarewicz et al. (26Slusarewicz P. Nilsson T. Hui N. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 4 °C; four to six livers from rats that had been fasted overnight were homogenized using a loose fitting Potter homogenizer in 3 volumes of 0.5 m sucrose containing 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 2.5 mm MgCl2 and a mixture of protease inhibitors. A post-nuclear supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min; this fraction was diluted to 0.25 m sucrose and transferred to Beckman SW28 Ultracentrifuge tubes. 12 ml of the supernatant was underlayered with 7, 9, and 7 ml of 0.5, 0.86, and 1.3 m sucrose, respectively, in the same buffer and centrifuged at 28,000 rpm (100,000 × gav) for 90 min. Material floating at the 0.5 m/0.86 m sucrose interface, which was enriched in Golgi membranes (Fig. 1), was diluted to 0.25m and centrifuged at 7000 rpm in the SW28 rotor for 30 min onto a 100-μl cushion of 1.3 m sucrose. This step was repeated, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in 2–3 ml of 0.25m sucrose-containing buffer. Isolated Golgi membranes were stored at −80 °C until use. All steps were preformed at 4 °C. Four rat brains were homogenized using a loose fitting Potter homogenizer in 3 volumes of 0.25 m sucrose containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. A post-nuclear supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min followed by centrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000 × g for 3 h. The high speed supernatant was dialyzed overnight against 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, and a mixture of protease inhibitors and concentrated using a Centriprep-10 concentrator (Amicon). Aliquots were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. Galactosyl and sialyl transferase activities were determined by incubating fractions with either [3H]UDP galactose or [3H]CMP sialic acid (27Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). [3H]UDP galactose (10 Ci/mmol) and [3H]CMP sialic acid (33.2 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Each reaction (25 μl) contained vesicle budding buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 110 mm KAc, pH 7.4), 1 μCi of [3H]nucleotide sugar, 1 μm non-radioactive nucleotide sugar, and 30 μg of protein from each gradient fraction; for assay of galactosyl transferase activity samples contained 5 mmMnCl2. Following incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the samples were spotted onto Whatman 3MM filter discs to determine the incorporation of radioactivity into ice-cold trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material. The filters were washed extensively, dried, and counted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. Golgi membranes (20 μg) were incubated with [3H]CMP sialic acid as above for 30 min at 37 °C in a volume of 60 μl. Following incubation, 100 μmnon-radioactive CMP-sialic acid was added in addition to 120 μg of cytosol (2 mg/ml final concentration) and an energy regeneration system (EGS) containing (1 mm ATP, 0.02 mm GTP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 80 μg/ml creatine phosphate kinase). When cytosol alone was incubated in the absence of Golgi membranes, there was no incorporation of [3H]CMP sialic acid. To assay for release of post-Golgi vesicles, samples were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min and the vesicles were separated from residual Golgi membranes by centrifugation for 1 min at 12,000 ×g. The supernatant containing released vesicles and pellets (corresponding to residual Golgi membranes) were either precipitated with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid or treated with 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated overnight at 4 °C with appropriate antibodies. The antibody-antigen complexes were incubated with Protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C and washed twice with 0.1% Triton X-100 in the preceding buffer followed by washing twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. [3H]CMP sialic acid-labeled Golgi membranes were treated with 1.0% 1-butanol or t-butanol for 30 min at 37 °C or 4 °C in the presence of cytosol and energy (EGS). Samples were then diluted 5- to 10-fold with buffer followed by centrifugation in a Beckman Airfuge at 100,000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet containing fragmented Golgi elements was resuspended in vesicle budding buffer. Aliquots of these membranes were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min with rat brain cytosol (2 mg of protein/ml) in the absence or presence of EGS (above). Vesicles and reformed Golgi cisternae were separated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 1 min. The supernatant and pelleted material were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and electron microscopy. The synthesis of PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 was determined as described by Siddhantaet al. (19Siddhanta A. Backer J.M. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12023-12031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Rat liver Golgi membranes were incubated with or without 2.0 mg/ml rat brain cytosol in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 125 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP (final specific activity, 70 μCi/mmol) at 37 °C for 15 min. Reactions were terminated by extraction with acidified chloroform/methanol. The chloroform phase was recovered and washed with methanol:1 nHCl (1:1), and the organic phase was dried, resuspended in chloroform:methanol:12 n HCl (200:100:1), and spotted on TLC plates. Radiolabeled phospholipids were detected by autoradiography and identified by co-migration with nonradioactive standards. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Before incubation with primary antibodies the membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk containing 0.2% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline. Following incubation, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies diluted 1:2000 were used to detect primary antibodies; gel bands were visualized by Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). [3H]Sialic acid-labeled proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the radioactive polypeptides were detected by fluorography. The fluorograms were scanned, and the band intensities were quantified using a computing densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Golgi membranes and samples from thein vitro membrane budding and vesiculation reactions were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer and post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide followed by 1% uranyl acetate. The samples were then dehydrated through a series of graded ethanol concentrations and embedded in LX112 resin (LADD Research Industries, Burlington, VT). Ultra thin sections were cut on a Reichert Ultracut E ultramicrotome, stained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate, and viewed on a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. To quantitate the relative numbers of Golgi stacks, individual cisternae, and vesicles, the method of Misteli (28Misteli T. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 269-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Four categories of membrane profiles were defined. Cisternae were identified as membranes with a length greater than four times the width; stacked Golgi profiles were those with two or more cisternae that were adjacent for more than half their length; small vesicles were those with a size of 50–100 nm; and large vesicles were those of 100–350 nm (28Misteli T. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 269-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Contaminating membranes such as plasma membrane or endoplasmic reticulum were not included in the analysis. The different membrane profiles were counted by randomly overlaying a transparent grid of 1-cm squares across each micrograph. Each membrane category that intersected a horizontal line and fell within a box that corresponded to a 2.5-μm square (actual size) was counted. The proportion of each membrane profile to the total membrane was equal to the number of line intersections per category divided by total number of membrane intersections. Two random areas from at least 20 micrographs of each treatment were counted. Purified Golgi membranes were isolated from rat liver according to methods used previously (26Slusarewicz P. Nilsson T. Hui N. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Following centrifugation, the gradient was fractionated, aliquots of alternate fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using antibodies to Golgi, ER, mitochondria, endosomal, and plasma membrane marker proteins (Fig.1A). TGN38 a trans-Golgi marker, co-fractionated on the gradient with an opaque band of material at the interface of 0.5 and 0.86 m sucrose (fractions 23–28). Gradient fractions radiolabeled with both [3H]CMP sialic acid or [3H]UDP galactose had a peak of radioactivity at fraction 27 that co-sedimented with TGN38 (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, this material was highly enriched in Golgi stacks and cisternae, as evinced by electron microscopy (Fig. 1C). Calnexin, a marker for the ER (29Bergeron J.J.M. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), and Tom20, a mitochondrial outer membrane (30Schleiff E. Silvius J.R. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) protein, sedimented through the gradient (fractions 30–39) and overlapped only minimally with Golgi marker proteins. A second band of membranous material floating between 0.86 and 1.3 m sucrose was highly enriched in the plasma membrane as indicated by the localization of connexin43, a gap junction protein (Fig. 1A) and electron microscopy (Fig. 1B). Rab5, a marker for early endosomes, was mostly cytosolic and present in fractions corresponding to the load zone (fractions 1–12). Our recent work demonstrated that in several different cell types PLD1 was detected in the perinuclear Golgi region and bound to Golgi membranes (17Freyberg Z. Sweeney D. Siddhanta A. Bourgoin S. Frohman M. Shields D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Consequently, it was of interest to identify which fractions contained this enzyme: Most of the PLD1-immunoreactive material was present in two regions of the gradient; those corresponding to the Golgi apparatus (fractions 23–30) and plasma membrane (fractions 35–39; Fig. 1A). Fractions 17 and 18 were enriched in both ARF1 and PLD1, although most ARF1 was recovered in the cytosol. Surprisingly, little PLD2 immunoreactivity was detected in fractions corresponding to the plasma membrane (31Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In contrast to PLD1, most of the PLD2-immunoreative material was present in the endosomal, Golgi, and lighter membrane fractions. Material collected from fractions 24–29, corresponding to Golgi membranes, was pooled and used for subsequent experiments. Our initial goal was to radiolabel endogenous glycoproteins in the late Golgi/TGN and follow their release into post-Golgi vesicles in vitro. Isolated Golgi membranes were incubated with [3H]CMP sialic acid, and its incorporation into N-linked glycoproteins was determined (Fig. 2). Consistent with earlier observations (22Sommers L.W. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10811-10817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the translocation of [3H]CMP sialic acid across Golgi membranes and its incorporation into endogenous glycoprotein acceptors was cytosol- and energy-independent (Fig. 2A). Measurement of the trichloroacetic acid precipitable radioactivity across the sucrose gradient ([3H]sialic acid-labeled or3H-galactosylated polypeptides; Fig. 1A) revealed only background radioactivity in fractions corresponding to the cytosol (fractions 1–12) demonstrating incorporation was dependent on the presence of Golgi membranes. Analysis of the total radiolabeled material by SDS-PAGE revealed a heterogeneous distribution of polypeptides ranging in size from ∼200 to 40 kDa (Fig. 2B,lanes 7 and 8). To determine the efficiency of vesicle budding from the TGN, we measured the release of [3H]sialic acid-labeled cargo molecules into a medium speed supernatant fraction (Fig. 2, B and C). Samples were incubated in the presence and absence of an energy regeneration system (EGS) and/or cytosol. Following incubation, the putative post-Golgi vesicles (supernatant, S) were separated from residual Golgi membranes (pellet, P) by brief centrifugation (12,000 × g for 1 min). Similar to data obtained using permeabilized cells (27Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), vesicle release was energy-, cytosol-, and temperature-dependent (Figs. 2B,lanes 3–8, and 2C). Hepatocytes synthesize numerous specific proteins. We therefore used antibodies to two such soluble secreted glycoproteins, α1-antitrypsin and transferrin (Fig.3A, lanes 5,6, 9, 10; Mr51,000 and 78,000, respectively) as well as to the Golgi integral membrane protein TGN38 (∼90 kDa) to identify these molecules by immunoprecipitation following vesicle release from the TGN (Fig. 3,A and B). All three polypeptides were evident, although their relative distribution in the vesicle (S) and residual Golgi (P) fractions was significantly different. In particular, the release of transferrin-containing vesicles was higher (∼20%) than that of TGN38 (∼14%; Fig. 3, B andC) and more efficient than release of the total acid-precipitable radioactivity, suggesting selective packaging of cargo molecules in vitro. Whether this represents formation of separate vesicle populations containing different cargo molecules or the differential “filling” of transferrin and TGN38 into the same vesicle remains to be determined. Additionally, two major transferrin-immunoreactive bands were evident in the residual Golgi (P) fraction (Figs. 3A, lane 10, and3B) whereas a faster migrating species was released into the vesicle fraction (S) (Fig. 3A, lanes 9and 10). The latter transferrin molecule may correspond to post-Golgi processing of transferrin in the released vesicles. If vesicles were released from the Golgi membranes, then cargo molecules should be resistant to exogenously added proteases. Conversely, if the cargo molecules had leaked into the incubation medium from ruptured membranes or were present as a result of nonspecific effects on membranes, the radiolabeled polypeptides would be protease-sensitive. To distinguish between these possibilities, supernatant and pellet fractions were digested with proteinase K in the absence and presence of detergent (Fig.4). In the absence of detergent, virtually all the polypeptides were protease resistant (Fig.4A, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, in the presence of Triton X-100, there was quantitative proteolysis of all polypeptides (lanes 5 and 6). Additional evidence that the radiolabeled cargo molecules were present in vesicles was obtained by use of high speed centrifugation, 100,000 ×g for 5 min (Fig. 4; lanes 7–12). If the cargo molecules were present in vesicles, they would be expected to sediment upon high speed centrifugation. Alternatively, if these glycoproteins had leaked into the 12,000 × g supernatant fractions (lanes 2 and 4), they would be unlikely to sediment at 100,000 × g. Consistent with the protease protection data, all the radiolabeled glycoproteins were present in the pellet fraction following centrifugation at 100,000 ×g (Fig. 4, lanes 7, 8). Furthermore, solubilization of the membranes with Triton X-100 released all the radiolabeled cargo molecules into the medium and high speed supernatant fractions (Fig. 4, lanes 9–12), a result that is consistent with these molecules being present in membrane-bound vesicles. To confirm that specific cargo molecules were present in"

After atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) binding to NPRA, ligand-receptor complexes are internalized, processed intracellularly, and sequestered into subcellular compartments, which provided an approach to examining directly the dynamics of metabolic turnover of NPRA in intact cells. The translocation of ligand-receptor complexes from cell surface to intracellular compartments seems to be linked to ANP-dependent down-regulation of NPRA. Using tryptic proteolysis of cell surface receptors, it was found that ∼40–50% of internalized ligand-receptor complexes recycled back to the plasma membrane with an apparent t 12 = 8 min. The recycling of NPRA was blocked by the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine, the energy depleter dinitrophenol, and also by low temperature, suggesting that recycling of the receptor is an energy- and temperature-dependent process. Data suggest that ∼70–80% of internalized 125I-ANP is processed through a lysosomal degradative pathway; however, 20–25% of internalized ligand is released intact into the cell exterior through an alternative mechanism involving an chloroquine-insensitive pathway. It is implied that internalization and processing of bound ANP-NPRA complexes may play an important role in mediating the biological action of hormone and the receptor protein. In retrospect, this could occur at the level of receptor regulation or through the initiation of ANP mediated signals. It is envisioned that the endocytotic pathway of ligand-receptor complexes of ANP-NPRA would lead to termination and/or diminished responsiveness of ANP in target cells.

Natriuretic peptides belong to a family that comprises at least three members, ANP, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), but each is derived from a separate gene (4Rosenzweig A. Seidman C.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 229-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The biological actions of these peptide hormones are triggered by interactions with highly selective and specific receptors. Three subtypes of natriuretic peptide receptors have been identified and characterized by molecular cloning, namely natriuretic peptide receptor-A, -B, and -C, also designated as NPRA, NPRB, and NPRC, respectively (5Garbers D.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 6Koller K.J. deSauvage F.J. Lowe D.G. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2581-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Two of these receptors, NPRA and NPRB, contain guanylyl cyclase (GC) activity and produce the intracellular second messenger cGMP in response to ligand binding. The third receptor, NPRC, lacks the GC catalytic domain and has been termed the clearance receptor (7Maack T. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 54: 11-27Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The evidence suggest that both ANP and BNP selectively bind to NPRA, and CNP has been shown to activate primarily NPRB. However, all three natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP, and CNP) indiscriminately bind to NPRC. NPRA is essentially thought to be the primary ANP signaling molecule because most of the physiological effects of the hormone can be triggered by cGMP or its cell-permeable analogs (8Anand-Srivastava M.B. Trachte G.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 455-497PubMed Google Scholar, 9Drewett J.G. Garbers D.L. Endocrinol. Rev. 1994; 15: 135-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 10Pandey K.N. Sowers J.R. Contemporary Endocrinology: Endocrinology of the Vasculature. Humana Press, Inc., Totawa, NJ1996: 255-267Google Scholar).NPRA is a unique class of cell surface receptors that contains an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single transmembrane-spanning region, an intracellular protein kinase-like homology domain (protein-KHD), and a GC catalytic domain (5Garbers D.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The GC catalytic region of NPRA has been assigned to ∼250 amino acid residues that presumably constitute the catalytic active site of the receptor (11Liu Y. Ruoho E.R. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 12Sunahara R.K. Beuve A. Tesmer J.J.G. Sprang S.R. Garbers D.L. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 5993-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although the transmembrane GC receptors contain a single cyclase catalytic active site per polypeptide chain, they function as homodimers (14Wilson E.M. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar,15Yang R.B. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13738-13742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The protein-KHD is a region of ∼280 amino acids that immediately follows the transmembrane-spanning domain of the receptor. It has been suggested that the dimerization region of the receptor is located between the protein-KHD and GC catalytic domain, predicted to form an amphipathic α-helix (16Garbers D.L. Lowe D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30741-30744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The integrity of these regions of NPRA are conserved across the species. Previous studies as well as recent data have indicated that protein-KHD seems to be important for ANP-dependent activation of NPRA (17Larose L. Rondeau J.-J. Ong H. DeLean A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 115: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that ANP binding to NPRA activates ATP binding to protein-KHD in the intracellular cytoplasmic space, which in turn activates the GC catalytic domain of the receptor (19Goraczniak R.M. Duda T. Sharma R.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Duda T. Goraczniak R.M. Sharma R.K.

However, the exact mechanisms of activation and relay of signals from protein-KHD to GC catalytic active site of the receptor remains to be established. Previous studies have proposed that NPRA exists as a dimer and that one molecule of ANP binds to a receptor dimer, suggesting a receptor-to-ANP binding stoichiometry of 2:1 (22Rondeau J.J. McNicoll N. Gagnn J. Bouchard N. Ong H. De Lean A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2130-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, recent observations have indicated that an equimolar binding stoichiometry between the extracellular domain of NPRA and ANP for ligand-induced dimerization was 1:1 (23Misono K.S. Sivasubramanian N. Berkner K. Zhang X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Van den Akker F. Zhang X. Myagi M. Huo X. Misono K.S. Yee V.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the validity of these schemes remains to be firmly established, and the interactive role of receptor dimers with bound ligands have yet to be elucidated.Despite the considerable progress on the structure-function studies, the issue of internalization of NPRA, an important member of the GC-coupled membrane receptor family, is controversial. There is currently a debate over whether ANP-NPRA complexes internalize at all or whether the cell utilizes some other mechanisms to release ANP from NPRA. Indeed, controversy exists because it has been reported earlier by default that among the three natriuretic peptide receptors only NPRC is internalized with bound ligand (25Koh G.Y. Nussenzweig D.R. Okolicany J. Price D.A. Maack T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11987-11994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Maack T. Kidney. Int. 1996; 49: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Hence, from a thematic standpoint, it is clearly evident that there is a current need to provide a consensus forum that establishes the cellular trafficking and processing of ANP-NPRA complexes in intact cells. The present study was undertaken to resolve this important issue and to elucidate unequivocally the ligand-regulated internalization and trafficking of NPRA in stably expressing human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells without interference from other natriuretic peptide receptor proteins. It is implied that after internalization, ligand-receptor complexes dissociate inside the cell and a population of the receptor recycles back to the plasma membrane. Subsequently, some of the dissociated ligand molecules escape the lysosomal degradative pathway, are released intact into culture media, and may reenter the cell by retroendocytotic mechanisms. In the present report, utilizing pharmacological and physiological perturbants, we have studied the cellular regulation and processing of ligand-receptor complexes in intact HEK-293 cells stably expressing recombinant NPRA.DISCUSSIONThese present studies were undertaken to address the kinetics of internalization, sequestration, recycling, and down-regulation of recombinant NPRA in intact 293 cells. The data establish that NPRA is a dynamic macromolecule that traverses through the subcellular compartments before it is degraded in the lysosomes. In 293 cells, the recombinant NPRA was expressed at a very high density with aB max of 2–3 × 106 receptor sites/cell and a K d value of 2.5 × 10−10m. The expression of recombinant NPRA in 293 cells seems to be at a higher density compared with endogenous receptors present in Leydig tumor cells, as reported previously (30Pandey K.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4382-4390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 125I-ANP binding assay was utilized to determine the post-binding kinetics and cellular itinerary of the labeled ligand-receptor complexes in intact cells. In the past, the interrelationship between the endocytotic mechanisms, intracellular sequestration, and ANP-dependent down-regulation of NPRA has been controversial. It is conceivable that the homeostatic regulation of NPRA and cellular sensitivity of ANP would be dependent on a dynamic equilibrium and reutilization of the ligand-receptor complexes from the cell surface to the cell interior. Therefore, to understand the dynamics of the interrelationship between these processes, the events that occur after the binding of ligand to the receptor were investigated in 293 cells expressing a high density of recombinant NPRA. The results presented herein demonstrate that125I-ANP binds to cell surface NPRA, enters through the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis, and is delivered to the intracellular compartments until it reaches a steady-state level after 30 min (t 12 = 15 min). The distribution of125I-ANP radioactivity to the cell surface, intracellular compartments, and into the culture medium revealed a dynamic equilibrium between the rates of 125I-ANP uptake, subcellular sequestration, degradation, and extrusion from the cell interior to the extracellular space. The majority of the internalized125I-ANP was degraded and rapidly released into the culture medium, which consisted of ∼70–75% degraded products and 20–25% intact ligand. The rates of internalization, degradation, and release of 125I-ANP were markedly decreased in the presence of metabolic inhibitors such as chloroquine and dinitrophenol and also at low temperature, which suggested that the metabolic processing of125I-ANP in 293 cells is, in part, lysosomal. However, after longer incubation periods, the effect of chloroquine was only partially effective in blocking the release of both the degraded and intact ligands.Previous studies from this laboratory as well as reports by others have suggested that endogenous NPRA undergoes rapid endocytosis in Leydig tumor (MA-10) cells (30Pandey K.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4382-4390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Pandey K.N. Inagami T. Misono K.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8467-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and in PC-12 cells (33Rathinavelu A. Isom G.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). On the other hand, studies by Maack and colleagues (25Koh G.Y. Nussenzweig D.R. Okolicany J. Price D.A. Maack T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11987-11994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that ANP-NPRA complexes were not processed intracellularly in renomedullary interstitial cells. These authors suggest that a rapid dissociation of receptor-ligand complexes probably occurs upon ANP binding to NPRA at 37 °C, and the intact ligand is released into the culture medium. A trace amount of 125I-ANP may be released from the receptor by the neutral endopeptidase, as described in neuroblastoma cells (34Delporte C. Poloczek P. Tastenoy M. Winard J. Christopher J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 227: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, further studies have not been carried out to support those postulates. Our recent data in COS-7 cells transiently expressing NPRA have provided the evidence that its internalization seems to be controlled by sequences located within the carboxyl-terminal domain of this receptor protein (28Pandey K.N. Kumar R., Li, M. Nguyen H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 259-267PubMed Google Scholar). The phenomena of receptor-mediated internalization and metabolic processing of ANP through the non-guanylyl cyclase-containing receptor, NPRC, have been investigated in a number of laboratories utilizing vascular smooth muscle cells, which contain a predominantly high density of endogenous NPRC (35Hirata Y.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6503-6513Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Early studies of the post-binding events of NPRC were greatly facilitated because of its predominant presence in vascular smooth muscle cells, which are among the important target cells for ANP. In contrast, studies on the post-binding events of NPRA were hampered because of the lack of suitable target cells that exclusively contained this receptor protein. The results from this present study with recombinant 293 cells, which predominantly express NPRA, firmly establish that ANP-NPRA complexes are rapidly internalized and sequestered into the intracellular compartments and the degraded products released into culture medium.Further experiments revealed that a short-term exposure of recombinant 293 cells with increasing concentrations of unlabeled ANP at 37 °C resulted in an accelerated loss of cell surface receptors. The maximal effect of ANP on down-regulation of NPRA occurred between 40 and 60 min, suggesting the involvement of receptor-mediated endocytosis and subsequent metabolic degradation and redistribution of ligand-receptor complexes in the cell interior. The data suggested that ∼30–35% of NPRA returned to the cell surface in ANP-treated cells. The treatment of cells with unlabeled ANP accelerated the release of intact ligand, indicating that ANP-dependent down-regulation of its receptor involves the internalization of ligand-receptor complexes, which dissociate intracellularly and probably escape the lysosomal degradative pathway. Nevertheless, an alternate mechanism also seems to exist for the release of intact ligand (Fig.9). Dual pathways for the intracellular processing of ligand-receptor complexes have also been proposed previously for insulin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors (44Marshall S. Green A.

In our metabolic processing studies of NPRA, ANP binding has been used as an index of NPRA activity. Degradation, on the other hand, is considered as the actual loss of receptor from the cell interior by proteolysis into amino acids. Temporally, inactivation may precede degradation, or both events may occur simultaneously. An invaluable experimental tool in the elucidation of NPRA inactivation would be the use of ANP-induced receptor down-regulation. Essentially, down-regulation may result in a loss of cellular NPRA by means of an accelerated rate constant for receptor internalization and presumably inactivation. Desensitization and/or inactivation of NPRA have been suggested by mechanisms involving ANP-dependent dephosphorylation of this receptor protein (48Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14636-14642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanisms of dephosphorylation-dependent inactivation of NPRA are not well understood. In contrast, it has also been suggested that phosphorylation of NPRA occurs (17Larose L. Rondeau J.-J. Ong H. DeLean A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 115: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 20Duda T.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 50Koller K.J. Lipari M.T. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5997-6003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It would be anticipated that inactivation of NPRA might occur intracellularly, and the inhibition of internalization should prevent this process. However, the molecular and biochemical nature of the inactivation process of NPRA and the subcellular localization of the events have yet to be determined.To examine the recycling of recombinant NPRA, 293 cells were treated with trypsin at 4 °C for 10 min, which abolished cell surface receptors. However, after washing the cells free of trypsin and incubating them in fresh medium at 37 °C, a return in125I-ANP binding was observed. In parallel, one group of trypsin-treated cells was also exposed to cycloheximide. Interestingly, in cycloheximide-treated cells, binding of 125I-ANP was 25–30% lower as compared with control cells without cycloheximide treatment. These observations provided further evidence that a return in 125I-ANP binding was due to the recycling of NPRA. However, a complete return in ANP binding did not occur, suggesting that a new protein synthesis may also be required. Both the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine and the metabolic inhibitor dinitrophenol, which deplete cellular ATP, disrupted the internalization and recycling process of NPRA. However, it has been reported that ATP is not required for internalization of insulin receptors (51Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3201-3213Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 52Smith R.M. Jarett L. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 1551-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but it seems to be essential for the internalization of EGF receptors (53Carpenter G. Cohen S. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). It is envisioned that the receptor-mediated endocytosis of ANP-NPRA complexes may involve a number of sequential sorting steps through which ligand-receptor complexes could be eventually degraded, recycled back to the cell surface, or released into the cell exterior. A number of these events may take place sequentially, as shown in Fig. 9. The first step would be the noncovalent binding of ligand to the cell surface receptor. The receptors, through some intrinsic affinity or aggregation induced by protein binding, must cluster into pits on the cell membrane. The proposed itinerary would be consistent with the current data indicating that ligand-receptor complexes should be delivered to the lysosomes. Acidification of lysosomes may induce the dissociation of ligand from the receptor, and a population of receptor molecules may recycle back to the plasma membrane. The data are consistent with the following findings: (a) a lysosomotropic agent such as chloroquine is unable to completely block the ligand-receptor degradation in lysosomes; (b) the release of intact ANP seems to occur through a lysosome-independent pathway; and (c) recycling of endocytosed receptor back to the plasma membrane occurs simultaneously with the process leading to the degradation of the majority of ligand-receptor complexes into lysosomes.The present findings indicate that internalized ANP bifurcates into two major pathways: a degradative pathway, through which the majority of internalized ANP (70–80%) of all incoming ligand is processed in lysosomes, and a retroendocytotic pathway that accelerates the release of intact ANP. This approach should provide a direct assessment of ligand-bound receptor trafficking for various ligand-receptor complexes in different cell types. It is conceivable that some remarkable differences do exist with regard to the internalization, processing, and metabolic turnover among various types of membrane receptors. Our results show that recombinant 293 cells begin to release degraded ANP within minutes after internalization of ligand-receptor complexes at 37 °C. The phenomenon of ANP-NPRA degradation is similar to that reported for low density lipoprotein receptors in human fibroblasts (54Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3330-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 55Chen W-J. Goldstein T.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13101-13106PubMed Google Scholar), and thyrotropin hormone receptors in GH3 cells (60Ashworth R., Yu, R. Nelson E.J. Dermeer S. Gershengorn M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the degradation of asialoglycoprotein and its receptor complexes is not observed until about 30 min after endocytosis in hepatoma cells (61Hartford J. Bridges K. Ashwell G. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3191-3197PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the degradation of EGF is not detectable for at least 20 min in hepatocytes (62Dunn W.A. Hubbard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 249: 5153-5162Google Scholar). Although there is no apparent explanation to account for such differences, several possibilities may be considered. Because the internalization of receptor-bound ligand should not be the limiting factor, there may be multiple pathways leading to the eventual metabolic turnover of ligand-receptor complexes, perhaps utilizing different intermediate vesicles for the transfer of ligands to the site of degradation. If this was the case, then the route could be determined by either intrinsic properties of ligand-receptor complexes or the way various cells process the incoming ligands. It is also possible that there may be a single metabolic pathway composed of several distinct processing steps, which should be unique for a specific ligand-receptor complex. The present results demonstrating that chloroquine effectively interrupts the degradative processing without exerting a deleterious effect on the retroendocytotic pathway is novel and intriguing. In agreement with our findings, several other types of ligand-receptor complexes recycle through the chloroquine-insensitive pathway, including EGF, insulin, and asialoglycoprotein receptors (46Sorkin A. Krolenkom S. Kudrjavtceva N. Lazebnik J. Teslenko L. Soderquist A.M. Nikolsky N. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 112: 55-63Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 47Well A. Wellsh J.B. Lazer C.S. Wiley H.S.

Acta. 1984; 805: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This establishes the notion that after internalization, many types of ligand-receptor complexes can recycle through the chloroquine-insensitive pathway and finally be degraded via chloroquine-sensitive lysosomal pathway.

The control of PI metabolism by phosphatidylinositol kinases has been the subject of extensive investigation; however, little is known about how phosphatidylinositol kinases regulate traffic in polarized epithelial cells. Because phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K)-mediated phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P) production has been suggested to regulate biosynthetic traffic in yeast and mammalian cells, we have examined the role of PI4Kβ in protein delivery in polarized MDCK cells, at different levels of the biosynthetic pathway. Expression of wild type PI4Kβ had no effect on the rate of transport of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) through the Golgi complex, but inhibited the rate oftrans-Golgi network (TGN)-to-cell surface delivery of this protein. By contrast, expression of dominant-negative, kinase-dead PI4Kβ (PI4KβD656A) inhibited intra-Golgi transport but stimulated TGN-to-cell surface delivery of HA. Moreover, expression of PI4KβD656A significantly increased the solubility in cold Triton X-100 of HA staged in the TGN, suggesting that altered association of HA with lipid rafts may be responsible for the enhanced transport rate. Both wild type and kinase-dead PI4Kβ inhibited basolateral delivery of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, suggesting an effector function for PI4Kβ in the regulation of basolateral traffic. Thus, by contrast with the observed requirement for PI4Kβ activity and PI(4)P for efficient transport in yeast, our data suggest that changes in PI(4)P levels can stimulate and inhibit Golgi to cell surface delivery in mammalian cells.

These lipids are synthesized by specific kinases localized to distinct regions of cells (3Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). In turn, numerous effector molecules alter the activity of these kinases to enhance the production of particular phosphoinositide species and thus control the regulation of these various cellular functions.The function of PI metabolism in biosynthetic traffic has been the subject of recent investigation. Several studies suggest that synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P) mediated by PIK1, a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K), plays an important role in regulating biosynthetic traffic in yeast (4Simon J.-P. Morimoto T. Bankaitis V.A. Gottlieb T.A. Ivanov I.E. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11181-11186Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 5Jones S.M. Alb J.G.

Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Additionally, an elegant study in mammalian cells demonstrated that ADP-ribosylation factor recruits the β isoform of PI4K, a homolog of PIK1, to the Golgi complex, where it stimulates synthesis of PI(4)P and ultimately increases phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (PIP2) levels (9Godi A. Pertile P. Meyers R. Di Marra P. Tullio G. Iurisci C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). However, the effect of remodeling phosphatidylinositol composition on membrane traffic through the Golgi complex was not tested. Moreover, the role of PI kinases in regulating biosynthetic traffic in polarized cells, where proteins are segregated in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and differentially targeted to the apical or basolateral plasma membrane, has not been examined.We previously demonstrated that frequenin, a positive modulator of PI4Kβ, selectively inhibited the delivery of newly synthesized influenza hemagglutinin (HA) from the TGN to the apical cell surface in polarized MDCK cells (10Weisz O.A. Gibson G.A. Leung S.-M. Roder J. Jeromin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24341-24347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This finding was somewhat surprising, given previous studies demonstrating that inhibition of PI(4)P synthesis blocked secretory traffic in yeast (7Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 8Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 11Hama H.

To investigate this further, we generated recombinant adenoviruses encoding wild type and kinase-dead PI4Kβ and tested their effects on cellular PI composition and on traffic through the secretory pathway in polarized cells. Our data reveal a complex role for PI4Ks at multiple steps along the biosynthetic pathway.DISCUSSIONPIKs have been implicated in the regulation of numerous transport steps along the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways (reviewed in Refs.1Huijbregts R.P.H. Topalof L. Bankaitis V.A. Traffic. 2000; 1: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 2Czech M.P.

Biol. 2001; 180: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These proteins can act directly to alter PI composition in cells, but can also exert their effects by modulating the activity of other proteins that regulate membrane traffic. The development of dominant-negative, kinase-dead mutants that compete with endogenous PIKs for effector binding has aided in the analysis of this complex field. Here we report that expression of a kinase-dead mutant of PI4Kβ inhibits intra-Golgi traffic but selectively stimulates delivery of an apical marker from the TGN to the cell surface of polarized MDCK cells. Moreover, expression of mutant PI4Kβ transiently alters the solubility properties of influenza HA in cold Triton X-100. Together, our data demonstrate that PI4Kβ acts as both a positive and negative regulator of biosynthetic transport.Regulation of Intra-Golgi Traffic by PI4KβThere is considerable evidence from previous studies that decreased PI(4)P levels in yeast cause defects in secretion. Yeast with a temperature-sensitive mutation in SEC14, which encodes an essential PI transfer protein required for formation of Golgi-derived transport vesicles (4Simon J.-P. Morimoto T. Bankaitis V.A. Gottlieb T.A. Ivanov I.E. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11181-11186Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 5Jones S.M. Alb J.G. Phillips S.E.

Moreover, cells carrying temperature-sensitive Pik1 mutations had decreased PI(4)P levels and delayed kinetics of invertase secretion and vacuolar delivery of carboxypeptidase Y (6Foti M. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2396-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 7Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. Nat.

Because Pik1 localizes to the trans-Golgi and because mutants accumulate Golgi membranes (see below), this enzyme appears to play an important role in Golgi-to-plasma membrane delivery in yeast (7Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). By contrast, the other PI4K in yeast, Stt4p, plays a distinct, non-overlapping function and appears to be important in regulating actin cytoskeleton organization, vacuolar morphology, and cell wall integrity (8Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar).We found that expression of wild type PI4Kβ in polarized MDCK cells had no effect on intra-Golgi traffic. These data are consistent with our previous studies, which showed that overexpression of the PI4Kβ activator frequenin had no effect on this step in biosynthetic transport (10Weisz O.A. Gibson G.A. Leung S.-M. Roder J. Jeromin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24341-24347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). By contrast, expression of dominant-negative PI4Kβ reduced the rate at which newly synthesized HA traversed the Golgi complex. We observed a slight decrease in the rate of acquisition of endo H resistance, and greater effect on the rate of HA sialylation in cells expressing PI4KβD656A compared with control. This suggests that PI4Kβ regulates transport in multiple Golgi compartments, resulting in a cumulative slowing of transport as proteins traverse each cisterna of the Golgi complex. One possibility is that a threshold level of PI(4)P is required for efficient transport through the Golgi complex, but that increased amounts are not stimulatory.PI4Kβ Regulates TGN to Apical Cell Surface DeliveryAs predicted by our previous findings with frequenin, overexpression of wild type PI4Kβ inhibited TGN-to-PM delivery of HA, whereas kinase-dead PI4Kβ stimulated this step in transport. These data contrast with the observed requirement for PI4Kβ activity and PI(4)P for efficient transport in yeast (see above) and suggest that changes in PI(4)P levels can both positively and negatively regulate Golgi-to-cell surface delivery.The stimulation of HA cell surface delivery by PI4KβD656Acould be caused by an increase in the rate of HA exit from the TGN or to more efficient vesicle trafficking to/fusion with the apical plasma membrane. We believe that the effect we observe occurs at the level of the TGN, because both wild type and kinase-dead PI4Kβ localize to the Golgi complex. Moreover, mutant PI4Kβ does not stimulate apical release from vesicles carrying recycling or transcytosed proteins in polarized MDCK cells. 2J. R. Bruns, M. T. Miedel, and O. A. Weisz, unpublished data. Although this does not preclude a specific role for PI4Kβ in fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles with the apical plasma membrane, there does not appear to be a general enhancement of vesicle fusion with the apical plasma membrane in these cells.We demonstrated previously that overexpression of frequenin has no effect on the basolateral delivery of newly synthesized pIgR in polarized MDCK cells (10Weisz O.A. Gibson G.A. Leung S.-M. Roder J. Jeromin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24341-24347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Additional experiments demonstrated that neither wild type PI4Kβ nor PI4KβD656A affected the overall transport rate of pIgR to the basolateral cell surface. However, because this protein is not efficiently staged in the TGN at 19 °C, 3G. Apodaca, personal communication. these experiments cannot identify differential effects on pre- and post-TGN transport. Therefore we examined the effects of wild type PI4Kβ and PI4KβD656A on transport of another basolateral marker, VSV G. Surprisingly, both wild type and dominant-negative PI4Kβ significantly inhibited TGN-to-basolateral delivery of this protein. One possible explanation for this disparity is that the pIgR transport assay is not sensitive enough to detect inhibition by the PI4Ks. In this regard, because PI4KβD656A decreases the rate of intra-Golgi transport, we expected to observe at least a slight inhibition of transport by this protein, yet we saw no effect. However, another perturbant of biosynthetic traffic, bafilomycin A1, significantly and reproducibly inhibited pIgR transport in this assay. Alternatively, it is possible that basolateral transport of pIgR and VSV G are regulated by different mechanisms. Regardless, the inhibition of VSV G transport by both wild type and dominant-negative PI4Kβ that we observed suggests that basolateral trafficking of this protein is not directly regulated by PI4K enzymatic activity, but rather via effector molecules that interact with PI4Kβ. For example, protein kinase C has been shown to be important for efficient budding of TGN-derived vesicles, but its phosphorylating activity was not required (28Simon J.-P. Ivanov I.E. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 355-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Expression of Dominant Negative PI4β Alters HA Detergent SolubilityExpression of PI4KβD656A but not wild type PI4Kβ significantly decreased the amount of HA that was insoluble in cold Triton X-100 after a 19 °C chase. However, no difference in HA solubility was detected when the cells were warmed to 37 °C to allow cell surface transport to proceed. There are several possible explanations for these observations. One is that HA staged at 19 °C in control cells has access to a later, possibly post-TGN, compartment than HA in cells expressing PI4KβD656A; in this regard, cell surface HA was slightly more detergent-insoluble than HA staged at 19 °C. This would be consistent with our observation that more HA had reached the PM after 4 h of chase in control cells than in PI4KβD656A-expressing cells; however, this is difficult to reconcile with the overall stimulation in transport rate of HA that we observed in PI4KβD656A-expressing cells. Another more intriguing possibility is that expression of PI4KβD656A alters Golgi/TGN lipid composition in a manner that selectively affects HA association with lipid microdomains in this organelle. The selective effect on HA solubility we observed at 19 °C versus 37 °C would be consistent with the presence of distinct, non-miscible pools of PIP at different cellular locations (6Foti M. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2396-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 8Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar).Although a lipid-mediated effect on HA solubility is unexpected because lipid rafts are thought to be held together by lipid-lipid interactions in the luminal rather than the cytoplasmic domain, this has never been rigorously tested. Interestingly, several reports have demonstrated enrichment of PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2 in detergent-insoluble lipid domains (29Pike L.J. Casey L. J. Biol.

This is of particular interest because lipid rafts have been suggested to function as platforms from which signal transduction cascades can be initiated (33Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2541) Google Scholar, 34Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5102) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that a linkage may exist between generation of PI species and the regulation of apical transport.Role of PI(4)P in Biosynthetic TransportAlthough we observed a clear increase in 32P-labeled PIP recovered from metabolically labeled cells overexpressing wild type PI4Kβ, expression of PI4KβD656A did not appreciably alter radiolabeled PIP levels. This is likely a result of the constitutive turnover of large pools of PIP in other compartments that would be insensitive to PI4KβD656A expression (see above). Nevertheless, although it is impossible to assess how PI4KβD656A affects PI composition in the Golgi, let alone in individual Golgi cisternae, we suspect that altered PI(4)P levels directly contribute to both the stimulation and inhibition of traffic that we observed because: 1) PI4KβD656A has different effects on both intra-Golgi transport and apical delivery kinetics of HA compared with wild type PI4Kβ; 2) PI4KβD656A alters the detergent solubility properties of HA staged in the TGN, suggesting that it may affect Golgi complex lipid composition; and 3) coexpression of wild type PI4Kβ blocks the effects of PI4KβD656A on intra-Golgi transport, cell surface delivery, and detergent solubility of HA. Thus, it is likely that changes in PI(4)P levels can directly affect transport rates along the biosynthetic pathway.Several studies suggest that changes in PI(4)P levels may regulate Golgi complex morphology as well as function. Cells expressing temperature-sensitive mutants of SEC14 or PIK1 accumulate Berkeley bodies, which are thought to represent hypertrophy of the Golgi cisternae in response to the transport blockade (7Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 8Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol.

Similarly, Godi et al. (9Godi A. Pertile P. Meyers R. Di Marra P. Tullio G. Iurisci C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) found that overexpression of dominant-negative but not wild type PI4Kβ in COS-7 cells resulted in dramatic alterations in the distribution of the Golgi marker giantin, resulting in a disorganized pattern with irregular filamentous and punctate structures. By contrast, we saw no observable changes in giantin staining at the light microscope level in MDCK cells overexpressing large amounts of either wild type or mutant PI4Kβ. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear, but it could be caused by differences in the cell type or expression level used in our study.Although PI(4)P is the most abundant phosphatidylinositol in the Golgi complex, other downstream metabolites may also play a role in regulating biosynthetic transport. Several roles for PIP2in Golgi transport have been suggested, including recruitment and regulation of a Golgi membrane cytoskeleton (36Godi A. Santone I. Pertile P. Devajaran P. Stabach P.R. Di Morrow J.S. Tullio G. Polishchuk R. Petrucci T.C. Luini A. De Matteis M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8607-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 37Lorra C. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E113-E115Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and participation in a positive feedback loop involving ADP-ribosylation factor and phospholipase D that would drive protein transport (see Ref. 38Martin T.F.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar for review.) In addition, overexpression of the α isoform of phosphatidylinositol 5-kinase in cells resulted in actin polymerization selectively on membrane vesicles containing lipid rafts to form actin comets (39Rozelle A.L. Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M. Driessens M.H.E. Insall R.H. Roth M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Marriott G. Hall A. Yin H.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), although the consequences of this on membrane transport rates were not assessed. The phosphatidylinositol 5-kinase responsible for generation of PIP2 in the Golgi has not yet been identified. We found that expression of wild type and mutant PI4Kβ had little effect on total cellular PIP2 levels, but the subcellular distribution of this pool could not be ascertained. However, we saw no observable change in the overall distribution of an adenovirally expressed construct encoding the green fluorescent protein-tagged pleckstrin homology domain from phospholipase Cδ (which avidly binds PIP2), when either wild type or mutant PI4Kβ were coexpressed in MDCK cells (data not shown).In summary, our data demonstrate that PI4Kβ regulates transport at multiple compartments in the Golgi complex and can play both positive and negative regulatory roles in membrane traffic. The opposing effects of dominant-negative PI4KβD656A on intra-Golgi transportversus Golgi-to-cell surface delivery of HA reinforces the complex role that phosphatidylinositol metabolism plays in the regulation of biosynthetic traffic. PIs can regulate traffic via their structural role as membrane components or via their ability to recruit proteins via specific domains (such as pleckstrin homology, Src homology 2, and FYVE domains). It is likely that both of these functions contribute to the overall role of PI4Kβ in biosynthetic transport. Recent technological developments, including the generation of lipid-specific probes (40Thomas C.L. Steel J. Prestwich G.D. Schiavo G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the ability to perform detailed kinetic analyses in live cells (41Hirschberg K. Miller C.M. Ellenberg J. Presley J.F.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 140-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) should be useful tools for sorting out this complexity. Phosphatidylinositols (PIs)1 play important roles in myriad cellular processes, including signaling, membrane trafficking, cell proliferation, and cytoskeletal organization (see Refs. 1Huijbregts R.P.H. Topalof L. Bankaitis V.A. Traffic. 2000; 1: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar and 2Czech M.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar for reviews.) These lipids are synthesized by specific kinases localized to distinct regions of cells (3Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). In turn, numerous effector molecules alter the activity of these kinases to enhance the production of particular phosphoinositide species and thus control the regulation of these various cellular functions. The function of PI metabolism in biosynthetic traffic has been the subject of recent investigation. Several studies suggest that synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P) mediated by PIK1, a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K), plays an important role in regulating biosynthetic traffic in yeast (4Simon J.-P. Morimoto T. Bankaitis V.A. Gottlieb T.A. Ivanov I.E. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11181-11186Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 5Jones S.M. Alb J.G.

Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Additionally, an elegant study in mammalian cells demonstrated that ADP-ribosylation factor recruits the β isoform of PI4K, a homolog of PIK1, to the Golgi complex, where it stimulates synthesis of PI(4)P and ultimately increases phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (PIP2) levels (9Godi A. Pertile P. Meyers R. Di Marra P. Tullio G. Iurisci C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). However, the effect of remodeling phosphatidylinositol composition on membrane traffic through the Golgi complex was not tested. Moreover, the role of PI kinases in regulating biosynthetic traffic in polarized cells, where proteins are segregated in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and differentially targeted to the apical or basolateral plasma membrane, has not been examined. We previously demonstrated that frequenin, a positive modulator of PI4Kβ, selectively inhibited the delivery of newly synthesized influenza hemagglutinin (HA) from the TGN to the apical cell surface in polarized MDCK cells (10Weisz O.A. Gibson G.A. Leung S.-M. Roder J. Jeromin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24341-24347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This finding was somewhat surprising, given previous studies demonstrating that inhibition of PI(4)P synthesis blocked secretory traffic in yeast (7Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 8Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 11Hama H.

To investigate this further, we generated recombinant adenoviruses encoding wild type and kinase-dead PI4Kβ and tested their effects on cellular PI composition and on traffic through the secretory pathway in polarized cells. Our data reveal a complex role for PI4Ks at multiple steps along the biosynthetic pathway. DISCUSSIONPIKs have been implicated in the regulation of numerous transport steps along the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways (reviewed in Refs.1Huijbregts R.P.H. Topalof L. Bankaitis V.A. Traffic. 2000; 1: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 2Czech M.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, and 27Cockroft S. De Matteis M.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 180: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These proteins can act directly to alter PI composition in cells, but can also exert their effects by modulating the activity of other proteins that regulate membrane traffic. The development of dominant-negative, kinase-dead mutants that compete with endogenous PIKs for effector binding has aided in the analysis of this complex field. Here we report that expression of a kinase-dead mutant of PI4Kβ inhibits intra-Golgi traffic but selectively stimulates delivery of an apical marker from the TGN to the cell surface of polarized MDCK cells. Moreover, expression of mutant PI4Kβ transiently alters the solubility properties of influenza HA in cold Triton X-100. Together, our data demonstrate that PI4Kβ acts as both a positive and negative regulator of biosynthetic transport.Regulation of Intra-Golgi Traffic by PI4KβThere is considerable evidence from previous studies that decreased PI(4)P le"
https://openalex.org/W2035031210,"αIIbβ3, a platelet-specific integrin, plays a critical role in platelet aggregation. The affinity of αIIbβ3 for its ligands such as fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor is tightly regulated in an uncharacterized intracellular process termed inside-out signaling. Calcium integrin-binding protein (CIB) has been identified as a protein interacting with the cytoplasmic tail of the αIIb subunit of αIIbβ3, but its physiological role has not been defined. In the present study, I demonstrate that CIB activates αIIbβ3 bothin vitro and in vivo. CIB interacts directly with the αIIb cytoplasmic tail, thereby increasing the affinity of αIIbβ3 for fibrinogen in anin vitro fibrinogen-binding assay. The interaction of CIB with the αIIb cytoplasmic tail is enhanced in a Ca2+-dependent manner. A physiological agonist, ADP, stimulates platelets, activating αIIbβ3. When the interaction of CIB with the αIIb cytoplasmic tail is blocked in native platelets by a permeable competing peptide, αIIbβ3activation is not detected even in the presence of ADP. This result indicates that direct interaction of CIB with the αIIbcytoplasmic tail converts αIIbβ3 from a resting to an active conformation. This suggests that CIB plays an important role in one of the pathways that modulate the affinity of αIIbβ3 for its ligand."

The ABI3, ABI4, and ABI5 genes encode proteins belonging to three distinct classes of transcription factors: the basic B3 domain, APETALA2 domain, and the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain families, respectively.

Structure-function studies with VP1 in transient gene expression assays have demonstrated that the N-terminal acidic domain functions as both a transcriptional activator and repressor (39Hoecker U. Vasil I.K. McCarty D.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2459-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The conserved B2 domain is required for transactivation of the ABA-inducible Em promoter and for enhancing the in vitro binding of various bZIP proteins to their cognate targets (40Hill A. Nantel A. Rock C.D. Quatrano R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3366-3374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).

Recently, TRAB1 was shown to bind both ABA-responsive promoter elements and VP1, thereby providing a mechanism for bZIP and VP1 transactivation of ABA signaling (33Hobo T. Kowyama Y. Hattori T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15348-15353Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Similarly, two-hybrid assays in yeast have shown that ABI5 forms homodimers and binds to ABI3; the B1 domain of ABI3 was essential for these interactions (42Nakamura S. Lynch T.J. Finkelstein R.R. Plant J. 2001; 26: 627-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation by ABA of TRAB1 and VP1 transactivation was not at the level of DNA binding (33Hobo T. Kowyama Y. Hattori T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15348-15353Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of additional regulatory mechanisms. PvALF, a bean ortholog of VP1 that transactivates theβ-Phas promoter, has been proposed to function by remodeling chromatin independent of exogenous ABA (43Li G.F. Bishop K.J. Chandrasekharan M.B.

In this study, we utilized transient gene expression in protoplasts from embryonic rice callus cultures to functionally analyze the interactions of genetically defined ABA regulatory genes (ABI5, ABI1-1, and VP1) and pharmacological effectors (La3+, 1-butanol, and an inhibitor of phospholipase D) (44Gampala S.S.L.

We have obtained evidence that ABI5 specifically interacts with all tested ABA signaling effectors and promoters from both monocots and dicots, demonstrating the conservation of ABA signaling in plants and the utility of rice protoplasts for molecular and cell biological dissection of ABA regulatory mechanisms. Embryonic rice suspension cultures (Oryza sativa L. cv IR-54) were kindly provided by Dr. W. M. Marcotte, Jr. (Clemson University, Clemson, SC) and propagated in Murashige and Skoog medium (46Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (54339) Google Scholar). Three days after subculturing, protoplasts were isolated and transformed with various mixtures of DNA constructs using polyethylene glycol precipitation as previously described (47Maas C. Reichel C.

Aliquots of transformed protoplast samples were treated with or without ABA and pharmacological agents for 16 h in the dark in a final volume of 0.8 ml of Krens solution. 1-Butanol was obtained from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium). Synthetic ABA and lanthanum chloride were obtained from Sigma. Fluorescein diacetate was obtained from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR) and was stored as 1% stock solution in acetone at −20 °C. ABA was dissolved and stored in absolute ethanol at −20 °C as a 0.1 m stock solution. Prior to use, required dilutions of ABA, lanthanum chloride, and 1-butanol were made in Krens solution, and control samples received the same volumes of solvents as in ABA and pharmacological treatments.

Plasmids pG1 and pDirect2.6 were used as controls to demonstrate the protein-specific nature of the ABI5 and ABI1-1 effects. Plasmid pG1 is identical to pG2 except that it is wild type at amino acid 180 (Gly) and that the phosphatase active site has been mutated (G174D) to express a null mutant (25Sheen J. Proc. Natl.

Typically 60 μg of DNA for reporter constructs and 40 μg of DNA for effector constructs were used for transformations. Cell viability was measured by staining the protoplasts with 0.01% fluorescein diacetate, and batches of protoplasts with viability higher than 90% were used for transformations. Previous results have demonstrated a specific log linear dose response to exogenous ABA of various promoters in synergy with transgene effectors in transiently transformed rice protoplasts (44Gampala S.S.L.

To test the role of ABI5 in ABA signaling in rice protoplasts and further examine the conservation of ABA signaling machinery among species, we measured the effect of overexpressed ABI5 cDNA, driven by the Ubi promoter, on various ABA-inducible promoters. Table I shows the results of numerous promoter activation experiments that tested the specificity and extent of functional interactions of ABA and co-expressed ABI5. In these experiments a construct containing the Ubi promoter alone was transformed in the negative control samples to account for possible DNA effects or titration of endogenous transcription factors. Therefore, the effects observed by Ubi::ABI5 co-transformation are due to ABI5 overexpression. There was a significant 12-fold induction of wheat Em::GUS expression observed with 10 μm ABA treatment. Co-transformation of Ubi::ABI5 cDNA specifically and significantly transactivatedEm::GUS expression more than 2-fold over control, in the presence or absence of ABA (Table I). Co-expression of ABI5 also specifically and significantly transactivated the ABA-inducibleHva1 and Hva22 promoters of barley, theβ-Phas promoter of bean, but not the non-ABA-inducible35S promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus (Table I). The ABI5 transactivation functioned in synergy with exogenous ABA, based on the observed factorial rather than additive responses of promoters to ABA plus ABI5 treatments compared with either treatment alone (Table I). This result demonstrates that ABI5 transactivation acted via an ABA-specific pathway.Table IABI5 transactivates the ABA-inducible barley promoters Hva1, Hva22, and bean β-Phas promoter in riceConstructFold induction in GUS expressionNo ABA+ ABAEm∷GUS112 ± 0.61-aSignificantly different than control, p < 0.003 (two-sided Student's ttest, equal variance assumed).Em∷GUS +Ubi∷ABI52.3 ± 0.121-aSignificantly different than control, p < 0.003 (two-sided Student's ttest, equal variance assumed).28 ± 2.61-cSignificantly higher than either ABA or Ubi∷ABI5 reference, p < 0.03 (one-sided Student's t test, equal variance assumed).Hva1∷GUS15.3 ± 0.91-aSignificantly different than control, p < 0.003 (two-sided Student's ttest, equal variance assumed).Hva1∷GUS +Ubi∷ABI53.6 ± 0.81-aSignificantly different than control, p < 0.003 (two-sided Student's ttest, equal variance assumed).16.9 ± 3.01-cSignificantly higher than either ABA or Ubi∷ABI5 reference, p < 0.03 (one-sided Student's t test, equal variance assumed).Hva22∷GUS13.4 ± 0.51-aSignificantly different than control, p < 0.003 (two-sided Student's ttest, equal variance assumed).Hva22∷GUS +Ubi∷ABI53.5 ± 0.51-aSignificantly different than control, p < 0.003 (two-sided Student's ttest, equal variance assumed).8.1 ± 0.91-cSignificantly higher than either ABA or Ubi∷ABI5 reference, p < 0.03 (one-sided Student's t test, equal variance assumed).β-Phas∷GUS13.6 ± 0.51-aSignificantly different than control, p < 0.003 (two-sided Student's ttest, equal variance assumed).β-Phas∷GUS + Ubi∷ABI54.7 ± 0.41-aSignificantly different than control, p < 0.003 (two-sided Student's ttest, equal variance assumed).52 ± 7.21-cSignificantly higher than either ABA or Ubi∷ABI5 reference, p < 0.03 (one-sided Student's t test, equal variance assumed).35S∷GUS11.0 ± 0.21-bNot significantly induced by ABA nor trans-activated by ABI5, p > 0.50 (one-sided Student's t test, equal variance assumed).35S∷GUS +Ubi∷ABI50.8 ± 0.11-bNot significantly induced by ABA nor trans-activated by ABI5, p > 0.50 (one-sided Student's t test, equal variance assumed).0.9 ± 0.11-bNot significantly induced by ABA nor trans-activated by ABI5, p > 0.50 (one-sided Student's t test, equal variance assumed).Fold induction (ABA treatment and/or ABI5 transactivation) were calculated relative to control (zero ABA added, equal to unity) in paired samples co-transformed with either Ubi∷ABI5 cDNA effector construct or Ubi∷expression vector alone and treated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ForEm, Hva1, and Hva22 experiments, the concentration of ABA used was 10 μm; forβ-Phas experiments, it was 100 μm.

In addition to its role in oxidation reduction reactions, in which NAD(H) and its phosphorylated form, NADP(H), act as hydride donors and acceptors, NAD is also important for other cellular processes, such as the activity of NAD-dependent DNA ligases, mono- and poly(A)DP-ribosylation of proteins, and production of the intracellular calcium-mobilizing molecules cADPR and NaADP (1Ziegler M.

NAD is synthesized via a multi-step de novo pathway or via a pyridine salvage pathway. The enzyme nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN)1 adenylyltransferase (AT, EC 2.7.7.18) sits at the convergence of these two pathways. NaMN AT catalyzes the conversion of ATP and NaMN to nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD) (Fig. 1) that is directly processed to NAD by NAD synthetase. The nadD gene, encoding NaMN AT, was the first enzyme demonstrated to be essential for NAD biosynthesis and bacterial cell survival by both the de novo and salvage pathways (3Hughes K.T. Ladika D. Roth J.R. Olivera B.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 213-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Along with sequence homology, the specificity of these enzymes for NMNversus NaMN provides a useful method for classifying new genes within this family. Although there is sequence conservation between the eubacterialnadD genes (Fig. 2), sequence alignment of nadD NaMN ATs to the eukaryotic enzymes or archeal enzymes is difficult outside of the region surrounding the (H/T)XGH nucleotidyl transferase consensus sequence. Adenylyltransferases encoded by the nadD gene prefer the nicotinic acid containing NaMN over NMN as a substrate by a factor that ranges from 6:1 to 2000:1 (4Magni G. Amici A. Emanuelli M.

Primary sequence studies indicate that NaMN AT belongs to the nucleotidyl-transferase α/β phosphodiesterases superfamily of enzymes that contain the (H/T)XGH signature motif. Members of this family share the same basic catalytic mechanism, involving direct nucleophilic attack upon an α-phosphate followed by the release of pyrophosphate, whereas the enzyme provides stabilization of the transition state prior to the formation of a new phosphodiester bond. The recent structure determination of NMN ATs from M. jannaschii and M. thermoautotrophicum has allowed this sequence and functional homology to be extended to the structural conservation of residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis (16D'Angelo I.

Understanding the biochemical, physical, and structural properties of these essential enzymes and placing them in a larger biological context are the first steps in exploring this potential. To this end, we report here the identification of an unassigned reading frame in Bacillus subtilis (yqeJ) as a NaMN AT. We have expressed the recombinant enzyme in Escherichia coli and show that it prefers NaMN as a substrate to NMN, allowing us to assign it as thenadD gene of B. subtilis. It differs from the NMN ATs from M. jannaschii and M. thermoautotrophicumboth in its substrate specificity and oligomeric state. It is dimeric as opposed to hexameric (16D'Angelo I. Raffaelli N.

Edwards A.M. Pai E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7225-7232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have determined the three-dimensional structure of NaMN AT from B. subtilis to 2.2Å and 3.2Å with the NaAD bound. This has allowed us to identify key residues in substrate binding and catalysis. These structures will provide invaluable information in the ongoing development of anti-microbial agents targeting NAD biosynthesis. The B. subtilis yqeJ gene was PCR-cloned into a modified version of pET16b to yield pML208. This E. coli expression vector has the yqeJ coding sequence downstream of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The expressed protein contains the peptide MGHHHHHHHHHHSSGHIEGRHMPGGS fused to Lys2 of the native sequence. This provides a purification tag and contains the cleavage site for Factor Xa between Arg20 and His21 of the peptide, resulting in the cleaved protein having six extra amino acids on its N terminus. To produce selenomethionine-labeledyqeJ, the protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli at 25 °C. The cultures were grown in shake flasks in LeMaster's medium and induced at log phase with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cultures were harvested 4 h post-induction. Unlabeled yqeJ was also expressed in BL21DE3 E. coli, but at 37 °C. High density expression was carried out in a Biostat C-10 bioreactor (B. Braun Biotech). The culture was induced with 1.0 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final) at 4.6A600. The cells were harvested 4 h post-induction at 9.0 A600. The purification, unless otherwise stated, was performed at 4 °C. Bacteria were resuspended in buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl) and lysed by passage through a Microfluidics microfluidizer. The lysate was collected and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant, containing 40% of the expressed yqeJ NaMN AT (the remainder being insoluble), was applied to a Poros PI column (Applied Biosystems) that was coupled to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen). The nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column was washed with 50 mmimidazole, and the protein was eluted with a 50–800 mmimidazole gradient. 10 mm EDTA was added to the fraction containing yqeJ NaMN AT, for 6 h, followed by dialysis against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2. The His tag was removed fromyqeJ NaMN AT by a 6-h digestion with Factor Xa (New England Biolabs) at room temperature. The reaction was applied to a Poros HQ 50 column, and the bound protein was eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. The peak fraction containing yqeJ NaMN AT was diluted and applied to a Poros S column. The flow through, containingyqeJ NaMN AT, was applied to TSK gel G3000 SW column (TosoHaas), equilibrated with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl. Protein purity was >95%. Discontinuous HPLC assay. The discontinuous HPLC assay is based upon the assays published by Mehlet al. (12Mehl R.A. Kinsland C. Begley T.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4372-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and Balducci et al. (18Balducci E. Emanuelli M. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Amici A. Magni G. Orsomando G. Polzonetti V. Natalini P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The reaction conditions were 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.36 or 0.18 mg/mlyqeJ protein incubated at 37 °C. For the forward reaction, the incubations contained 1 mm ATP and 1 mm NaMN or NMN. For the reverse reaction, the incubations contained 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate and 0.5 mmNaAD or NAD. The reactants and products were separated by chromatography on a 3.9 × 150-mm C18 column (Novapack 5 μm; Waters Inc). Buffer A was 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. Buffer B was 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, in 20% MeOH. The elution conditions were: 0–3 min in 100% buffer A, 3.0–3.1 min to 100% buffer B, and 3.1–7 min in 100% buffer B. The absorbance of reactants and products was detected at 254 nm. Under these conditions NaMN eluted at 1.16 min, NMN eluted at 1.29 min, ATP eluted at 2.12 min, NaAD eluted at 5.37 min, and NAD eluted at 5.47 min. A continuous assay to monitor the reaction in the forward direction was based upon the EnzChek pyrophosphate assay from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). In this assay inorganic pyrophosphate produced in the forward reaction of yqeJ is cleaved by inorganic pyrophosphatase to phosphate, which is used by the second coupling enzyme, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, to convert the chromogenic substrate 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside to ribose-1-phosphate and 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine (E360 = 11,000 m−1cm−1). The reaction conditions were 20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside, 1 unit of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, 0.01 unit of inorganic pyrophosphatase, and 0.03 μg/ml yqeJ. The reaction volume was 125 μl and was carried out in a 96-well plate at room temperature using a Spectomax 384 Plus plate reader recording continuously at 360 nm (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For the Km determinations, NaMN was varied from 25 to 500 μm with ATP held at 2 mm, and ATP was varied from 50 to 1000 μmwith NaMN held constant at 1 mm. All kinetic constants were determined from nonlinear fits of the experimental data using the enzyme kinetic module of Sigmaplot 7.0 (SPSS, Inc., San Rafael, CA). The reaction conditions were the same for the Kmdeterminations for NMN except the MgCl2 concentration was increased to 50 mm, and the yqeJ concentration was increased to 75 μg/ml because of the lower activity against this substrate. Substrate inhibition was seen in assays using NMN as a substrate, with the double reciprocal plots curving sharply upwards above 5 mm. The data were fit to a model of substrate inhibition using the equation: v =Vmax/(1 + Km/S +S/Ki). The Kidetermined for NMN was 17 ± 3 mm. NMN was varied from 0.5 to 10 mm with ATP held constant at 0.6 mm. We also determined the kinetic constants of yqeJ using NMN and ATP substrates with a second coupled assay system, one coupling NAD production to its reduction by alcohol dehyrogenase. This assay was described by Balducci et al. (5Balducci E. Orsomando G. Polzonetti V. Vita A. Emanuelli M. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Magni G. Natalini P. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and has been used to characterize other NMN ATase. Using this assay we obtained values ofKm and Vmax for NMN very similar to those determined with the purine nucleoside phosphorylase-coupled assay described above. The alcohol dehydrogenase-coupled assay was not suitable to assay NaMN as a substrate, presumably because NaAD is not a good substrate for alcohol dehydrogenase. The back reaction for yqeJ NaMN AT was monitored using the coupled enzyme assay of hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (from yeast). yqeJ NaMN AT converts pyrophosphate and NaAD (or NAD) to NaMN (or NMN) and ATP. The ATP is then used by hexokinase to phosphorylate glucose to give glucose-6-phosphate and ADP. Glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized to 6-phospho-glucono-δ-lactone by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and NADP is reduced to NADPH. The assay is followed by the absorbance of NADPH at 340 nm. We used glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from bakers' yeast because this enzyme prefers NADP to NAD as a co-substrate. The assay conditions were: 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaPPi, 10 mm KCl, 5 units of hexokinase, 5 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 1 mm glucose, and 0.5 mm NADP+. yqeJ concentration is 0.0015 mg/ml for NaAD determination and 0.0075 mg/ml for NAD determination. ForKm determinations, NaAD was varied from 5 to 100 μm holding PPi at 1 mm, NAD was varied from 1 to 10 mm holding PPi at 1 mm, and PPi was varied from 0.1 to 2 mm holding NaAD at 500 μm. At a high concentration of NaPPi a precipitate was observed. This limited the concentrations of PPi that could be used in the assays. Crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 18 °C in drops containing 1.5 μl of protein stock solution (14 mg/ml protein, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl) mixed with 1.5 μl of well solution (8% PEG 3350, 100 mm MgCl2) and equilibrated against 1 ml of well solution. Block shaped crystals grew in 3 weeks, measuring ∼50 μm across. NaAD-NaMN AT complex co-crystals were grown at 18 °C in drops containing 1.0 μl of protein stock solution (14 mg/ml protein, 2 mm NaAD, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl) mixed with 1.0 μl of well solution (20% PEG 3350, 100 mm magnesium acetate) and 0.3 μl of xylitol (30% w/v). Plate-like crystals grew in 1–3 weeks to ∼200 × 50 × 20 μm. Crystals of the apo-form belong to the space group P21 with unit cell parametersa = 43.98 Å, b = 126.10 Å,c = 70.58 Å, and β = 92.73° and contain four molecules of NaMN AT in the asymmetric unit, implying a solvent content of 58.5%. To harvest crystals, an equal volume of a solution of 35% PEG 3350, 100 mm MgCl2 was added to drops, and after equilibration for several minutes the crystals were swiped through another drop of this solution and cooled rapidly in liquid nitrogen. The data collection statistics are shown in Table II. Multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) data were recorded at the 5.0.2 beam line of the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory using a Quantum-4 detector. The data were collected at two energies chosen based on the measured absorption at the selenium K edge: 12661 eV (λ = 0.9792 Å) and 12959 eV (λ = 0.9567 Å) corresponding to maximum f“ and a remote energy, respectively. Intensities were integrated and scaled using the programs Denzo and Scalepack (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

To harvest crystals, ethylene glycol was added to the drops to 20%, and after mixing, the crystals were cooled rapidly in liquid nitrogen. The data collection statistics are shown in Table II. MAD data were recorded at the 5.0.2 beam line of the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory using a Quantum-4 detector. The data were collected at two consecutive energies, based on the measured absorption at the selenium K edge: 12662 eV (λ = 0.9791Å) and 12863 eV (λ = 0.9639Å) and corresponding to maximum f“ and a remote energy. Intensities were integrated and scaled using the programs Denzo and Scalepack (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38445) Google Scholar). The apo structure was determined by the MAD method. Initially 22 selenium sites were found with the program SOLVE (20Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar), and phasing with these sites in the program CNS (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16947) Google Scholar) revealed two additional sites by means of a difference Fourier map. Phases were calculated from these 24 sites in the programs CNS and SHARP (22De La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 4772-4794Google Scholar) and improved by solvent modification with the program Solomon (22De La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 4772-4794Google Scholar). ARP/WARP (23Perrakis A. Morris R.J. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar) was used to partially trace the α-carbon backbone. The complete model, with the exception of residues 42–52 in all molecules and residues 118–126 in molecules A and C, was built into the experimental map. After several iterative cycles of refinement using CNS and model improvement, water molecules were placed automatically in CNS. A simulated annealing composite omit map was calculated to check the final model. FinalRwork and Rfree values of 22.21 and 25.44% were obtained. The NaAD-NaMN AT complex structure was determined using a combination of MAD phases and molecular replacement using the apo enzyme structure. Initially 21 selenium sites were found using the program ShakeNBake (24Weeks C.M. Miller R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 120-124Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and phasing with these sites in the program MLPhare (25CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19730) Google Scholar) revealed 13 additional sites by means of a difference Fourier map. Phases were calculated from these 34 sites and improved with solvent flattening and 4-fold averaging with the program DM (25CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19730) Google Scholar). This experimental map was used to build four of the six molecules in the asymmetric unit, employing strict non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. At this point, the refined structure of the apo-enzyme became available. The complex model was edited such that fragments of the high resolution apo model were substituted wherever the apo model was in good agreement with electron density in the experimental map. MAD phases were then combined with model phases to generate improved maps, and two more molecules were identified. Density for the first four molecules found is significantly stronger than for the final two; however, density for the bound NaAD is good for all 6 molecules. The final Rvalues after releasing NCS restraints and rebuilding areRfree = 0.2798 and Rwork= 0.2787. 90 μg of B. subtilis NaMN AT was run on an Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Superose 12 H/R 10/30 column in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The retention time of B. subtilis NaMN AT was 27.3 min. To determine the apparent molecular weight of B. subtilis NaMN AT, the following standards were also run on the column under the same conditions: thyroglobin, 670,000; Gamma globulin, 158,000; ovalbumin, 44,000; myoglobin, 17,000; and vitamin B-12, 1,350 (Bio-Rad). Protein was pre-equilibrated by dialysis at 4 °C in 20 mm Hepes and 10 mmMgCl2, pH 7.2. The partial specific volume of B. subtilis NaMN AT was calculated based on the amino acid composition, and the density of the solvent was calculated from the chemical composition of the buffer using the computer program SEDNTERP and adjusted for temperature. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed on a Beckman XLI/XLA Analytical Ultracentrifuge operating at a rotor speed of 30,000 rpm using 400-μl samples loaded into two-channel carbon-Epon centerpieces in an An-60 Ti titanium rotor pre-equilibrated to temperature at least 1 h prior to each experiment. The sedimentation coefficients and molecular weights were obtained by fitting the data to the program SVEDBERG (26Philo J.S. Schuster T.M. Lane T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser, Boston, MA1994: 156-170Crossref Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 4 and 20 °C using a rotor speed of 18,000 rpm. The samples (400 μl) were loaded into two-channel cells at three different protein concentrations. The scans were recorded at 4 and 20 °C, and the signal was detected using absorbance optics (280 nm) and interference optics. Equilibrium was judged to be achieved when no deviations in a plot of the difference between successive scans taken 3 h apart were observed, usually within 24 h. However, temperature and ligand did have a minor effect upon the apparent molecular weight as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation. The variation between the velocity and equilibrium values at the different protein concentrations can be attributed to hydrodynamic effects. The molecular weight of the protein in the presence and absence of ligand was obtained from sedimentation equilibrium experiments using the following equation. Cr=C0expM(1−v¯ρ)ω2r2−r02/2RT+baseEquation 1 Where Cr is the absorbance at radiusr; C0 is the absorbance at reference radius r0; M is the molar mass of the macromolecule; v̄ is the partial specific volume of the macromolecule (ml/g); ρ is the density of the solvent; ω is the angular velocity of the rotor; R is the gas constant;T is the temperature; and base is the base-line offset. The molecular weight of yqeJ NaMN AT was obtained from sedimentation velocity experiments using Equation 2.M=(sRT)/(1−v¯ρ)DEquation 2 Where s is the sedimentation coefficient andD is the diffusion coefficient obtained by fitting the data to the program SVEDBERG (26Philo J.S.

The Streptococcus pneumonia genome was sequenced and searched for essential genes that may be suitable targets for the development of anti-microbial agents. Those genes identified were then tested in B. subtilis and E. coli. An unassigned open reading frame, yqeJ, that was essential in all three organisms was identified in B. subtilis. Comparisons of its amino acid sequence with those in GenBankTM using the program Blast (27Altschol S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69694) Google Scholar) revealed that it has homology to a number of putative adenylyltransferases including the recently assigned nadD gene of E. coli (12Mehl R.A. Kinsland C. Begley T.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4372-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).yqeJ contains the signature nucleotidyl transferase consensus sequence (H/T)XGH. As can be seen in Fig. 2,B. subtilis yqeJ is closely related to E. coli nadD and other putative eubacterial NaMN ATs. TheB. subtilis enzyme is more distantly related to E. coli nadR and other eukaryotic and archeal NMN ATs. Alignment of the B. subtilis NaMN AT to these species was difficult because of little homology outside of the region around the (H/T)XGH consensus sequence. This later group of enzymes includes the NMN AT from M. jannaschii and M. thermoautotrophicum for which three-dimensional structures have recently been determined (16D'Angelo I. Raffaelli N.

The bone morphogenetic protein response element (BRE) of Xvent-2Bwas previously identified and characterized with respect to Smad1 and Smad4 binding sites. In this study, we further report on the transcriptional regulation of Xvent-2B. We provide evidence that Xvent-2B (Xvent-2) maintains its own expression through autoregulation. This activity was demonstrated for the endogenous gene by reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis and was found to be insensitive to cycloheximide.

In the early Xenopus embryo, the BRE was shown to be sufficient to drive expression of a green fluorescent protein reporter in a similar pattern compared with the endogenous gene. Furthermore, Xvent-2B was able to activate the BRE in luciferase reporter assays, and in co-injection experiments Xvent-2B and Smad1 were found to synergistically activate the BRE. Moreover, glutathioneS-transferase pull-down experiments demonstrated that Xvent-2B directly and specifically interacts with Smad1. This association was mediated by the MH1 domain of Smad1 and required the C-terminal domain of Xvent-2. The failure of an Xvent-2 mutant lacking the C terminus to stimulate the BRE underlines the significance of the C-terminal domain in the described autoregulatory loop.

Consistent with the Xvents as downstream effectors of BMP, these genes are expressed in the ventral and lateral marginal zones and are excluded from the dorsal-most regions of early Xenopus embryos. Ectopic expression of the Xvents in the dorsal blastomeres mimics the BMP-induced ventralization of Xenopus embryos and results in the activation of BMP-induced genes. Moreover, these proteins can rescue the dorsalizing effects of the dominant negative BMP receptor. The intracellular transducers of TGF-β signaling are the Smad family of proteins (reviewed in Refs. 12Itoh S. Itoh F. Goumans M.J. ten Dijke P. Eur. J.

Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 are substrates for BMP receptors, whereas Smad2 and Smad3 are mediators of TGF-β and activin-like signaling (14Baker J.C. Harland R.M.

Phosphorylation by the type I receptor triggers hetero-oligomerization of receptor-specific Smads with Smad4 and translocation to the nucleus, where the Smad complex directly participates in the regulation of target genes. The Xvent-2B and Xvent-2 promoters, like other immediate response genes of TGF-β members, contain Smad binding elements that have been shown to confer BMP-4 inducibility (21Henningfeld K.A. Rastegar S. Adler G. Knöchel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21827-21835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). We have previously localized a BMP-4 responsive region between −275 and −152 of the 5′-flanking region of Xvent-2B. This region was shown to contain two Smad1 binding sites and an essential CAGAC motif that serves as a Smad4 recognition element. The upstream Smad1 binding sites were not required for stimulation by BMP-4; however, these sites were shown to be required for full transcriptional activation. Although it has been shown that the Smads are sequence-specific transcriptional modulators, specificity of action requires the cooperation of the Smads with other transcription factors (reviewed in Refs. 23Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 24ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Trends Biochem.

These include examples of factors that synergistically cooperate with the Smads via binding to adjacent elements and/or direct interaction with the Smads. The zinc finger protein OAZ has been identified recently as a Smad1 cofactor involved in the BMP-induced transcriptional activation of theXvent-2 gene (22Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). OAZ is ubiquitously expressed in the early Xenopus embryo and thus is a good candidate for the Smad1/Smad4 cofactor required for the initial Xvent-2activation. However, by early neurula stages expression of OAZ becomes restricted to the anterior neural plate, a region where expression of the Xvent-2 gene family is excluded (5Onichtchouk D. Gawantka V. Dosch R. Delius H. Hirschfeld K. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Development. 1996; 122: 3045-3053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ladher R. Mohun T.J. Smith J.C. Snape A.M. Development. 1996; 122: 2385-2394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests the existence of additional factors that are required to maintain and restrict the Xvent-2 expression. Because Xvent-2 has been shown to act not only as a repressor but also as an activator (26Schuler-Metz A. Knöchel S. Kaufmann E. Knöchel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34365-34374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we investigated in this study whether Xvent-2 can fulfill this role through an autoregulatory mechanism. We provide evidence that Xvent-2B can maintain its own transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that activation by Xvent-2B and Smad1 occurs in an additive fashion, and Xvent-2B can associate directly and specifically with Smad1. His-Xvent-2 was generated by subcloning the Xvent-2 cDNA into pRSET vectors (Invitrogen) for expression in bacteria. GST fusion proteins were created by subcloningXenopus Smad1, Xenopus Smad2, human Smad3, human Smad4, and Xvent-2 cDNAs into the pGex4T3 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The Smad1 deletion mutants were prepared using the following primers and cloned in the pCS2 vector as described: Smad1 linker/MH2 domains (aa 12–467) up-5′-CGGGGATCCATGAGTCCTGTCTTGCCACCT-3′ and down-5′-CGGGGATCCCTAATCCATTAACGAGACCGA-3′ (BamHI); Smad1 L domain (aa 132–269) up-5′-CGGGGATCCATGAGTCCTGTCTTGCCACCT-3′ and down-5′-GGGGATCCTTAGTGTTTTGGCTCTTCATATG-3′ (BamHI); Smad1 MH1 domain (aa 1–131) up-5′-CGGGGATCCATGAACGTGACGAGCTTGTTC-3′ and down-5′-CGGGAATTCCTACTCCACTCGTTTGTAATGATA-3′ (BamHI and EcoRI); Smad1 MH1/linker domains (aa 1–239) up-5′-CGGGGATCCATGAACGTGACGAGCTTGTTC-3′ and down-5′-GGGGATCCTTAGTGTTTTGGCTCTTCATATG-3′ (BamHI). Xvent-2-MT-pCS2 was PCR-amplified with the following primers and subcloned into the XhoI andXbaI sites of the pCS2 vector containing the N-terminal MT: up-5′-CCGCTCGAGATGACTAAAGCTTTCTCC-3′ and down-5′-GCTCTAGACTAATAGGCCAGAGGTTGCCC-3′. Xvent-2 promoter reporter constructs and Xvent-2B/pCS2 were described previously (6Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21Henningfeld K.A. Rastegar S. Adler G. Knöchel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21827-21835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The Xvent-2B (−275/−152)(−32/+34) promoter pGL3 construct was linearized with HindIII, and the overhang was filled in to create a blunt end. The fragment was then excised by cleavage with KpnI and cloned into theKpnI/SmaI sites of the pd2EGFP-1 vector (CLONTECH). Xenopusembryos were obtained by in vitro fertilization, dejellied in 2% cysteine hydrochloride in 0.1× MBSH (10 mmHEPES pH 7.4, 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.82 mmMgSO4, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.66 mm KNO3) and staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (27Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin).. North Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1967Google Scholar). Embryos were injected in 1× MBSH containing 4% Ficoll. Deletion mutants were injected at the 4-cell stage into both dorsal blastomeres (total 10 nl, 20 pg/blastomere). Capped mRNA for microinjections were in vitro transcribed (mMessage-mMachine™ SP6 Kit, Ambion) and purified over an RNA easy column (Qiagen). Linearization and transcription of DNA was as indicated: pSP64T3-BMP-4 (Xenopus BMP-4, BamHI, SP6); pSP64T3-Smad1 (Xenopus Smad1, XbaI, SP6); Xvent-2-MTpCS2 (NotI, SP6); Xvent-2BpCS2 (NotI, SP6). (RNA concentration Xvents: 200 pg/blastomere, Smad1: 250 pg/blastomere, BMP-4: 500 pg/blastomere.) The pRL-CMV or pRL-TKRenilla reporter plasmid (Promega) was always co-injected in promoter assays to allow for normalization of firefly luciferase values. Injected embryos were collected at stage 11 and deep frozen in liquid nitrogen. For luciferase assays, embryos were lysed in 10 μl of passive lysis buffer/embryo (Dual Luciferase Assay System, Promega). Following centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C, 20 μl of the supernatant was used to separately determine firefly andRenilla luciferase activities. Embryos were injected dorsally in both blastomeres at the 2-cell stage with 500 pg of MT-Xvent mRNA, collected at stage 11, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The embryos were homogenized on ice in lysate buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium vanadate, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and cleared by centrifugation three times for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. The Bradford assay was used to quantify total protein concentration (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3)Plus (Stratagene) and purified in batch under native conditions. His-tagged Xvent-2 was purified with NTA-agarose (Qiagen), and GST proteins were isolated using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The purified proteins were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol) and quantified by the Bradford method. Plasmid DNA was linearized withKpnI, and transgenic embryos were created essentially as described (29Sparrow D.B. Latinkic B. Mohun T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: e12Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). -35S-labeled proteins were prepared using the troponin T-coupled transcription-translation system (Promega). To 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in 500 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) was added an equal amount (5 μg) of purified GST or GST fusion proteins, and 35S-labeled proteins (5 μl) was added. The reactions were rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed four times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40). 2× SDS loading buffer was added (30 μl), and the samples were boiled for 5 min and analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize GST proteins, dried, and subjected to phosphorimager analysis. For pull-down assays from cell lysates, experiments were performed with 25 μg of total protein fromXenopus. Western analysis was performed with the anti-Myc antibody 9E10. Xenopus embryos were injected into both ventral blastomeres at the 4-cell stage with Xvent-2 (400 pg) or Xvent-2B (400 pg) RNA. At stage 7.5 embryos were treated with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) until control embryos reached stage 10.5. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy mini columns (Qiagen; RNeasy protocol for isolation of total RNA from animal tissues). DNase digestion as performed by the addition of 1.5 μl of RNase-free DNase I (Roche) and 5 μl of 25 mm MgCl2 to 50 μl of total RNA. The reaction was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C followed by inactivation of DNase by heating for 10 min at 75 °C. cDNA synthesis was performed under the following conditions: 1× RT reaction buffer (Amersham Biosciences), 10 ng of oligo(dT)12–18, 10 ng of random primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 26.8 units of RNAguard™ RNase inhibitor (Amersham Biosciences), 10 units of Maloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Amersham Biosciences), and 600 ng total of RNA. For PCR reactions the following primers and annealing conditions have been used: Histone H4 (upstream primer, 5′-CGGGATAACATTCAGGGTATCACT-3′; downstream primer, 5′-ATCCATGGCGGTAACTGTCTTCCT-3′; 56 °C annealing temperature), Xvent-2 (upstream primer, 5′-CATCATCATCCCCTGGAG-3′; downstream primer, 5′-TAGAGTTGGATCGACTCGT-3′; 50 °C annealing temperature), or Xvent-2B (upstream primer, 5′-GGGACCTTAATACCTCAAC-3′; downstream primer, 5′-GAGCTGGAGCGACTTGC-3′; 50 °C annealing temperature). The desired promoter fragments were excised from pGL3 vector (−275/−152 fused to the minimal promoter (−32/+34) or −370/+34) and 3′-labeled on one strand by a fill-in reaction with [α-32P]dATP and Klenow DNA polymerase. Binding reactions were carried out on ice for 30 min in 30 μl of binding buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 13.2% glycerol) containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 1 ng of the gel-purified probe. After 5 min of pre-incubation the protein was added and incubated for 30 min. The concentration of MgCl2 was subsequently raised to 5 mm for DNase I footprinting, and 0.065 units (free DNA) or 0.195 units (DNA + protein) of DNase I were added at room temperature for 45 s. The DNase I digestion was stopped by addition of an equal volume of sample buffer (66% deionized formamide, 20 mm EDTA, and 660 mm sucrose). Sequencing reactions were performed according to the method of Maxam and Gilbert (30Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8988) Google Scholar). After pre-electrophoresis for 2 h at 70 watts, samples were analyzed by 7% denaturing PAGE at 60 watts in 1× Tris borate EDTA. The ability of Xvent-2B to activate itself was studied in Xenopus embryos injected in both ventral blastomeres at the 4-cell stage with mRNA encoding the closely related Xvent-2. The Xvent-2 and Xvent-2Bgenes show identical expression patterns and appear to be functionally redundant. These genes probably arose either by the known tetraploidization within Xenopus laevis or by a separate gene duplication event. Although the amino acid sequences between Xvent-2 and Xvent-2B are highly conserved (83% overall sequence identity, 98% within the homeobox), the cDNA sequences are sufficiently divergent to allow the design of primers that can distinguish between the endogenous Xvent-2B and the injected Xvent-2 mRNA. Overexpression of Xvent-2 resulted in the activation of Xvent-2B and vice versa; Xvent-2B stimulated the transcription of Xvent-2 (Fig.1, compare lanes 1and 2). To test whether this activation was direct or required the de novo synthesis of downstream factors of Xvents, embryos were incubated in cycloheximide just before the onset of zygotic transcription at midblastula transition. This procedure allows for the translation of previously injected RNAs but prevents translation of zygotic transcripts. In both instances, the activation was insensitive to cycloheximide treatment, suggesting that the activatory effect is direct (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4). Because both proteins bind to identical target sequences and the proximal promoter sequences of both genes are highly conserved showing 95% nucleotide identity within the −240/+1 upstream region (6Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,22Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), 2W. Knöchel and H. Friedle, unpublished data. it is reasonable to assume that both Xvent-2 and Xvent-2B are subject to autoregulation. This conclusion is consistent with our previous observation that Xvent-2B, but not the more distantly related Xvent-1B, can activate the 5′-flanking region of Xvent-2B spanning from −275 to +34 (6Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As the previously characterized BRE (21Henningfeld K.A. Rastegar S. Adler G. Knöchel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21827-21835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) by sequence inspection contains putative Xvent-2B binding elements, we investigated the ability of this element to direct correct spatial and temporal expression in Xenopusembryos using a transgenic approach (29Sparrow D.B. Latinkic B. Mohun T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: e12Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The BRE (−275/−152) together with the minimal promoter were cloned in front of the GFP reporter, and the linearized construct was co-injected with isolated sperm nuclei into unfertilized eggs. GFP expression was found to be restricted to the ventral marginal zone of the early gastrula embryo (Fig. 2,B–D). As gastrulation proceeded, expression expanded dorsally but was excluded from the dorsal lip and later from the dorsal midline. Comparison of GFP expression with a whole mountin situ hybridization of endogenous Xvent-2Btranscripts (Fig. 2A) demonstrates that the identified BRE is capable of driving correct spatial expression of the reporter gene in the early Xenopus embryo. Initial gel shift experiments had shown that both Xvent-2 and Xvent-2B proteins bind to the Xvent-2B promoter (data not shown). To further demonstrate that Xvent-2 is directly involved in an autoregulatory circuit, DNase I footprinting experiments were performed with32P-labeled DNA fragments of the Xvent-2Bpromoter. As shown in Fig. 3, increasing concentrations of bacterially expressed Xvent-2 resulted in a concentration-dependent protection of distinct regions within the Xvent-2B promoter spanning from −275 to −50, relative to the transcription start site. Three of the identified Xvent-2 binding sites are located within the delineated BMP response element of the Xvent-2B promoter. All protected regions contain at the core a 5′-TAAT-3′ homeodomain consensus binding site (31Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar) that was also shown to be a preferred Xvent-2 binding motif (26Schuler-Metz A. Knöchel S. Kaufmann E. Knöchel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34365-34374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 32Trindade M. Tada M. Smith J.C. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 442-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To determine whether the BRE is sufficient to confer activation by Xvent-2B, promoter reporter assays were performed. Shown in Fig.4 dorsal co-injection of Xvent-2B mRNA, with the luciferase reporter under the control of theXvent-2B BRE (−275/−152) fused in front of the minimal promoter (−32/+34), resulted in more than a 2-fold activation inXenopus embryos. Interestingly, this activation was also observed with a mutated BRE, which included an altered Smad4 binding site. The mutations were sufficient to abolish transcriptional activation by the BMP signaling transducers, Smad1/Smad4 (21Henningfeld K.A. Rastegar S. Adler G. Knöchel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21827-21835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and (as shown in Fig. 4) activation by BMP-4. Xvent-2B, in contrast, failed to activate the goosecoid promoter demonstrating the specificity of activation (data not shown). Because both Xvent-2B and Smad1 bind and activate the BRE, we tested whether these factors cooperated together in reporter assays. A higher transcriptional activity was observed on the BRE when Xvent-2B and Smad1 were co-injected together, compared with the levels obtained by either factor alone (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that Smad1 and Xvent-2B act in an additive fashion in transcriptional activation ofXvent-2B. To exclude the possibility that the activation by Xvent-2B of its own promoter was occurring indirectly via the activation of BMP-4 (5Onichtchouk D. Gawantka V. Dosch R. Delius H. Hirschfeld K. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Development. 1996; 122: 3045-3053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Schuler-Metz A. Knöchel S. Kaufmann E. Knöchel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34365-34374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we tested the ability of Xvent-2B to activate a mutated BRE. Although Smad1 alone is unable to activate this mutated promoter, it is still able to potentiate the autoregulation by Xvent-2B, suggesting that this activation occurs through an alternative mechanism involving the recruitment of additional transcriptional activators (e.g. CBP/p300) following Smad1 binding to Xvent-2. In summary, the reporter assays illustrate Xvent-2 autoregulation and synergism with Smad1 and demonstrate a mechanism unique from the previously described BMP-4/Smad1/Smad4 activation. The synergistic activation of Xvent-2B by Smad1 and Xvent-2B led us to evaluate whether these two factors could physically interact using GST pull-down assays. RNA encoding Myc-tagged Xvent-2 was injected into both blastomeres of 2-cell stage embryos, and total cell lysates were prepared at stage 11 and incubated with GST or GST-Smad fusion proteins. Xvent-2B from these lysates specifically bound to GST-Smad1 but not to GST, GST-Smad4, or GST-Smad3 (Fig.5). To determine whether this interaction was direct, analogous pull-down experiments using GST-Xvent-2 and in vitro-translated Smad proteins were performed. In this assay, Smad1 bound strongly to GST-Xvent-2 but not to the GST control (Fig.6, lanes 7 and4). A slight interaction with Smad3 was observed in this assay; however, binding of Xvent-2 with Smad4 was not detected (Fig. 6,lanes 8 and 9). Deletion mutants of Smad1 were created and used in the pull-down assay to map the Xvent-2 binding domain. In contrast to the MH2/linker mutant or the linker domain alone, a strong interaction was observed with the MH1/linker construct and the MH1 domain alone (Fig.7, compare lanes 13and 15 with lanes 12 and14). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the Smad1 MH1 domain is required and sufficient to facilitate Xvent-2 binding. To delineate the domains within Xvent-2 responsible for Smad1 binding, mutants were created in which the N- or C-terminal regions flanking the homeodomain were removed. GST-Smad1 strongly bound the mutant lacking the N-terminal 184 amino acids, whereas the removal of the C-terminal domain completely abolished binding (Fig.8A, compare lanes 8 and 9). Thus, Xvent-2 domains that are critical for Smad1 are located outside of the homeodomain within the C terminus. Further support for the significance of the C-terminal domain of Xvent-2 in the autoregulatory loop was gained from co-injections of the −275/−152 promoter/luciferase construct with Xvent-2, Xvent-2ΔC, Xvent-2ΔN, and Xvent-1 RNA (Fig. 8B). Neither Xvent-1 nor Xvent-2ΔC was able to stimulate the reporter activity as was observed with Xvent-2 and also with Xvent-2ΔN. These results are consistent with the notion that the C-terminal domain of Xvent-2 is required as a transcriptional activation domain that interacts with the MH1 domain of Smad1. The Smad family of transcriptional factors interacts in a sequence-specific manner with regulatory elements within target genes. Because the DNA binding affinity of Smads is low, Smads are thought to cooperate with additional factors to increase specificity and selectivity (33Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Smads have been shown to associate and synergize with a variety of transcription factors including ubiquitously expressed and tissue-specific transcription factors as well as those that receive regulatory signals from other signaling pathways (reviewed in Refs. 23Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar,24ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 64-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). A limited number of Smad binding partners are able to discriminate among members and form complexes with pathway-restricted Smads of the same class. The first such factor was the winged-helix/forkhead DNA-binding factor FAST-1, which in response to TGF-β and activin signaling binds to Smad4 via direct interaction with Smad2/3 and regulates transcription of the Mix.2 andgoosecoid genes (34Chen X.

This NDH-1 houses nine putative iron-sulfur binding sites, eight of which are generally found in bacterial NDH-1 and its mitochondrial counterpart (complex I). The extra site contains a CXXCXXXCX27C motif and is located in the Nqo3 subunit. This motif was originally found in Escherichia coli NDH-1 and was assigned to a binuclear cluster (gz, y, x = 2.00, 1.95, 1.92) and named N1c. In this report, the Thermus Nqo3 fragment containing this motif was heterologously overexpressed, using a glutathione S-transferase fusion system. This fragment contained a small amount of iron-sulfur cluster, whose content was significantly increased by in vitro reconstitution. The UV-visible and EPR spectroscopic properties of this fragment indicate that the ligated iron-sulfur cluster is tetranuclear with nearly axial symmetry (g∥,⊥ = 2.045, ∼1.94). Site-directed mutants show that all four cysteines participate in the ligation of a [4Fe-4S] cluster. Considering the fact that the same motif coordinates only tetranuclear clusters in other enzymes so far known, we propose that the CXXCXXXCX27C motif in the Nqo3 subunit most likely ligates the [4Fe-4S] cluster.

Considering the fact that the same motif coordinates only tetranuclear clusters in other enzymes so far known, we propose that the CXXCXXXCX27C motif in the Nqo3 subunit most likely ligates the [4Fe-4S] cluster. bacterial proton-translocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase mitochondrial proton-translocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase glutathione S-transferase maltose binding protein quinone menaquinone ubiquinone truncated form (85AA) of the T. thermophilus Nqo3 subunit transcription factor for fumarate nitrate reduction biotin synthase Coomassie Brilliant Blue dithiothreitol mid-point redox potential isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside Bacterial proton-translocating NADH-quinone (Q) oxidoreductase (NDH-1)1 and its mitochondrial counterpart (complex I) are believed to be the most elaborate iron-sulfur proteins (1Cammack R.

To decipher the mechanism of electron transfer within the NDH-1/complex I, it is necessary to study physicochemical properties of individual iron-sulfur clusters and their subunit locations. For this purpose, we have attempted to individually express the putative cofactor-binding subunits of the Paracoccus denitrificans NDH-1, which is composed of 14 different subunits (designated Nqo1–14) (7Yano T.

Thermus thermophilus HB-8, which was isolated from a hot spring in Japan, is an extremely thermophilic, aerobic, Gram-negative bacterium (17Oshima T. Imahori K. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1974; 24: 102-112Crossref Scopus (496) Google Scholar). It is known that this bacterium contains NDH-1 in the respiratory chain (18Ohnishi T. Meinhardt S.W. Yagi T. Oshima T. Kim C.

Bacteriol. 1980; 48: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The enzyme was partially purified (19Yagi T. Hon-nami K. Ohnishi T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2008-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and the gene cluster encoding the T. thermophilus NDH-1 was sequenced (22Yano T. Chu S.S. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4201-4211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The gene cluster is composed of 14 structural genes (designatednqo1–14) similar to those of other bacteria (3Yagi T. Di Yano T. Bernardo S. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 23Yagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). On the basis of its deduced primary structure, the T. thermophilusNDH-1 is predicted to harbor nine iron-sulfur clusters (22Yano T. Chu S.S. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4201-4211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast, P. denitrificans NDH-1, which contains only UQ-10 (24Collins M.D. Jones D. Microbiol. Rev. 1981; 45: 316-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is believed to bear eight iron-sulfur clusters (3Yagi T. Di Yano T. Bernardo S. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 23Yagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 25Yagi T. Yano T. Matsuno-Yagi A.

Interestingly, the T. thermophilus Nqo3 andEscherichia coli NuoG (a Nqo3 homologue) subunits are predicted to ligate an additional iron-sulfur cluster with a unique cysteine cluster motif (256CXXCXXXCX27C291,T. thermophilus numbering), which is not found in P. denitrificans and higher organisms (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, E. coli NDH-1 shows slowly relaxing binuclear-type EPR signals (gz, y, x = 2.00, 1.95, 1.92), which have not been found in the NDH-1 from other bacteria. Therefore, it was proposed that the additional unique cysteine sequence motif in the NuoG subunit was responsible for the signals from the binuclear cluster N1c (26Friedrich T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 27Leif H. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J.

However, no further detailed experiments have been conducted to date. The same type of putative Fe/S binding sequence motif has been reported so far in ten other bacterial NDH-1 gene clusters (including Salmonella typhimurium) (see Fig. 1B) (29Smith M.A. Finel M. Korolik V. Mendz G.L. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 174: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, of interest to identify the iron-sulfur cluster coordinated by this motif and to characterize it to clarify the functional role(s) of this additional iron-sulfur cluster found in limited members of bacterial NDH-1. The present paper describes the expression, reconstitution, and UV-visible and EPR spectroscopic characterization of the iron-sulfur cluster ligated by the additional cysteine cluster motif in the Nqo3 subunit. Our results indicate that this cysteine motif most likely coordinates a [4Fe-4S] cluster rather than a [2Fe-2S] cluster. The site-directed mutation experiments suggest that the four cysteine residues are involved in the ligation of this [4Fe-4S] cluster. This iron-sulfur cluster has a unique feature, very high sensitivity to oxygen exposure, which has not been observed on other EPR-detectable iron-sulfur clusters in NDH-1/complex I. pGEX4T-3 vector, glutathione-Sepharose 4B gel, thrombin, and anti-GST antibody were from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. (Arlington Heights, IL). pMALc2g, amylose resin, genenase I, and anti-MBP antiserum were from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). The SuperSignal was from Pierce (Rockford, IL). pGEX2TKCS was a generous gift from Dr. Masahiko Aoki (The Scripps Research Institute). The DNA fragment encoding the N1c region (85AA, see Fig. 1A) was obtained from pTTH-1 plasmid (22Yano T. Chu S.S. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4201-4211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) by PCR using a sense primer to introduce NdeI restriction site at the translation initiation site and an antisense primer to construct XhoI site near the stop codon, respectively: N1cF (sense), 5′-GACCATATGGCCCGCTTCCGCGCCCGAAACTGG-3′; N1cR2 (antisense), 5′-GTTCTCGAGTCACTCCTCCCAGGTGGCCTCCACGAG-3′ (the italicized bases were altered from T. thermophilus DNA; the underlined bases indicate the newly introduced restriction sites,NdeI site for N1cF and XhoI for N1cR2; the boldface bases illustrate a constructed stop codon). The construct was ligated into NdeI/XhoI sites of pET16b and pGEX2TKCS expression vectors. The final constructs were designated as pET16b/N1c and pGEX2TKCS/N1c, respectively. For overexpression of the full-length Nqo3 subunit, three different constructs were prepared. The nqo3 gene was obtained from the pTTH-1 plasmid (22Yano T. Chu S.S. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4201-4211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) by PCR. The sense primers were designated to generate NdeI site for a pET21a expression vector, orSnaBI site for pMALc2g, or EcoRI site for pGEX4T-3 at the nqo3 initiation codon: nqo3F(NdeI), 5′-GGAGGTCATATGGTCCGGGTCAAGG; nqo3F(SnaBI), 5′-GGATACGTAATGGTCCGGGTCAAGGTGAACGACCGC-3′; nqo3F(EcoRI), 5′-GGGAATTCCATGGTCCGGGTCAAGGTGAACGACCGC-3′ (the italicized bases were altered from T. thermophilus DNA; the underlined bases indicate the newly introduced restriction sites). The antisense primer was made from the genomic sequence at the downstream of the unique BamHI site located in the first third of nqo3 gene (22Yano T. Chu S.S. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4201-4211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar): nqo3R (antisense), 5′-GATCCAGATCTCGTTGACCTCGG-3′. PCR amplification, purification, and subcloning of these DNA fragments (∼800 bp) were carried out as described previously (22Yano T. Chu S.S. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4201-4211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Each DNA fragment was verified by sequencing. The NdeI/HindIII,SnaBI/HindIII, andEcoRI/NotI fragments harboring the entirenqo3 gene were ligated into pET21a, pMALc2g, and pGEX4T-3, respectively. The proper constructs were confirmed by cleavage with several restriction enzymes. The final constructs were designated pET21a/nqo3, pMALc2 g/nqo3, and pGEX4T-3/nqo3. Expression of the N1c fragment was conducted basically according to Yano et al. (10Yano T. Yagi T. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18264-18270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). CompetentE. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS was transformed with pET16b/N1c or pGEX2TKCS/N1c. The cells were cultured into 500 ml of TB medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin, 100 μg/ml carbenicillin, 50 μg/ml ferric ammonium citrate, and 50 μmNa2S at 37 °C until A600 nmreached 0.5. After addition of 0.1 mm IPTG, cells were grown for 16–18 h at 25 °C. The cells harvested were suspended in anaerobic 50 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg leupeptin and 1 mmEDTA. The cell suspensions were freeze-thawed twice and sonicated. After unbroken cells and inclusion bodies were removed by repeated centrifugations, the supernatant was spun in an Ultracentrifuge at 50,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C in a 60Ti rotor. The inclusion body fraction was prepared as described previously (9Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The supernatant was degassed in vacuo and purged with argon and brought into an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products). The following procedures were performed under anaerobic conditions (oxygen level <1 ppm) at room temperature. The His-tagged N1c fragment was purified according to Ref. 8Yano T. Magnitsky S. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28598-28605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar. Purification of the GST-fused N1c fragment was carried out as follows. The supernatant was applied on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity column (1.5 × 3.0 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm DTT (TD buffer). The adsorbed protein was eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione with 0.2 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride or 1% protease inhibitor mixture. Expression of the full-length Nqo3 subunits was conducted by using pET21a/nqo3, pMALc2g/nqo3, and pGEX4T-3/nqo3 vectors according to the procedure of the N1c fragments (see above), except for the followings.E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was used as competent cells. The transformed cells were grown at 30–33 °C untilA600 nm reached ∼2.0. After addition of 0.5 mm IPTG, the cells were further incubated for 6–8 h at 15 °C. The cells were suspended to 7.5% (w/v) in anaerobic 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 200 mm NaCl on ice before use. The cells were broken up by two passages through a French Pressure cell at 2000 p.s.i. After unbroken cells and inclusion body were removed, the supernatant was spun in an Ultracentrifuge at 50,000 rpm for 60 min in the 60Ti rotor. The supernatant and pellet were analyzed for expression level of each form of the Nqo3 subunit. Expression level in the soluble fraction of non-fused Nqo3 subunit by pET21a/nqo3 was insufficient for conventional purification. GST-fused Nqo3 subunit by pGEX4T-3/nqo3 could not be detected in the soluble fraction. In contrast, MBP-fused Nqo3 subunit by pMALc2g/nqo3 was significantly expressed in the soluble fraction. Therefore, MBP-fused Nqo3 subunit was purified under anaerobic conditions basically according to the manufacturer's protocols. The reconstitution procedures were carried out in the anaerobic chamber by a modified method of Yano et al. (8Yano T. Magnitsky S. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28598-28605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Yano T. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol.

The purified GST-fused N1c fragment was diluted to 10–20 μm with TD buffer containing 10% glycerol (TDG buffer). β-Mercaptoethanol was added to the protein solution at 1.0% (v/v), and the solution was gently mixed and left for 90 min. Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 and Na2S were added to the protein solution at a final concentration of 240–480 μm. The reconstitution proceeded for 2–3 h. Unbound Fe2+ and S2−were removed by the desalting 10DG column. The reconstituted GST-fused N1c fragments were applied on a DEAE (Toyopearl 650M) column (0.8 × 1.0 cm) equilibrated with TDG buffer. The protein was eluted by 500 mm NaCl. Non-fused N1c fragment was obtained by treatment with thrombin for 3 h at room temperature after reconstitution, subsequent passing through a glutathione affinity column, and DEAE column chromatography. If required, the proteins were desalted by the 10DG column, and concentrated with Microcon-10 (Millipore). 10–20% glycerol was useful to keep the isolated N1c fragments from precipitating and adsorbing to resins or membranes. A similar strategy was used for in vitro reconstitution of iron-sulfur clusters into the MBP-fused Nqo3 subunit. The non-fused Nqo3 subunit was isolated after reconstitution by overnight incubation with genenase I at room temperature and subsequent DEAE column chromatography. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using the GeneEditor™ in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system kit (Promega). Each cysteine in the N1c fragment was mutated to alanine individually. The following oligonucleotides were designed as target primers; C256A, 5′-GAGACCCCCACCACCGCCGCCCTCTGCCCC-3′; C259A, 5′-ACCACCTGCGCCCTCGCCCCCGTGGGGTGC-3′; C263A, 5′-CTCTGCCCCGTGGGGGCCGGGATCACCGCC-3′; C291A, 5′-AACGAGATCTGGATCGCCGAGGCGGGCCGCTTC-3′ (mutated bases are underlined). Expression, purification, and reconstitution of the mutated GST-fused N1c fragments were performed as described above for the wild-type. Typically, a 500- to 1000-μl sample of anaerobically prepared GST-fused N1c (4–5 mg/ml) in TDG buffer was taken out of the glovebox and left in air at room temperature. Samples stirred slowly were withdrawn at desired times for analyses. UV-visible spectra were recorded on protein samples in a cuvette sealed with a Teflon cap after each sample was mixed with air by gently inverting the cuvette two or three times at periodic intervals during exposure to air. After the reconstituted GST-fused N1c fragment was exposed to air for 30 min, the sample was brought into the glovebox and diluted to 20 μm with the anaerobic 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 10% glycerol and 10 mm DTT. Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 and Na2S were slowly titrated into the protein solution to final concentrations of 480 μm. Excess iron, sulfide, and DTT were removed by a 10DG column. The molecular size of the purified GST-fused N1c fragment was determined by a gel filtration column TSK-G3000SW (Tosohaas) (2.5 × 30 cm). EPR spectra were measured by a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer operating at X band frequency (9.4 GHz). The sample temperature was varied using an Oxford ESR model 900 helium flow cryostat. Microwave frequency was monitored by a Hewlett-Packard 5350 frequency counter. Spin quantitation was performed under non-power-saturated conditions using 500 μm Cu-EDTA as a standard. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on an SLM-Amico DW-2000 and Beckman DU640 spectrophotometers at room temperature. For sequence analysis, GCG software programs were used to analyze the amino acid sequence and sequence comparison of polypeptides (30Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). A homology search was carried out using the BLAST program running at the NCBI (31Altschul S.F. Madden T.L.

As shown in Fig.1A, the P. denitrificans and T. thermophilus Nqo3 subunits contain at least three iron-sulfur cluster binding segments. From the N terminus, they are CX10CX2CXnC, HX3CX2CX5C, and CX2CX2CX42–43CP, which have been suggested to ligate a binuclear cluster (N1b), a tetranuclear cluster (possibly N5), and a tetranuclear cluster (N4), respectively (10Yano T. Yagi T. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18264-18270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 2T. Yano, E. Nakamaru-Ogiso, T. Yagi, and T. Ohnishi, unpublished results. Following these iron-sulfur cluster binding motifs, the T. thermophilus Nqo3 and E. coli NuoG subunits contain an extra cysteine cluster,256CXXCXXXCX27C291(T. thermophilus numbering), which is not found inP. denitrificans and higher organisms (Fig. 1A). Although this cysteine cluster has been considered to coordinate an iron-sulfur cluster, its properties have not been further investigated. Because the presence of these three iron-sulfur clusters may interfere with characterization of the fourth iron-sulfur cluster in the T. thermophilus Nqo3 subunit when a full-length form of subunit is used, we decided to express an internal polypeptide fragment (85AA), which encompasses the extra four-cysteine cluster (Cys256, Cys259, Cys263, and Cys291). The fragment (called the N1c fragment hereafter) starts just after the previous run of cysteines (end at residue 230), which are the presumptive ligands of cluster N4, and contain the C-terminal stretch (see Fig. 1A and “Experimental Procedures”). When His-tagged forms of the N1c fragment was expressed in E. coli using pET16b/N1c(85AA), the product was predominantly expressed as dark-red brown inclusion bodies under all conditions tested. Once the C-terminal region of the N1c fragment was truncated by 10 residues, the inclusion body looked whitish. In contrast, the GST-fused N1c fragment was expressed in a soluble fraction and much less inclusion bodies were formed. The expressed GST-fused N1c fragment was purified from the cytoplasmic fraction by glutathione-affinity and DEAE column chromatography to nearly homogeneous form as shown in Fig.2A (lanes 1,2, and 4). The expressed GST-fused N1c fragment was readily recognized by affinity-purified anti-N1c antibody and anti-GST antibody (Fig. 2B, lane 1). We successfully isolated non-fused N1c fragment by treatment with thrombin (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 6). The apparent molecular sizes of the expressed GST-fused, His-tagged, and non-fused N1c fragments on the SDS gel were in good agreement with their deduced molecular sizes, 38.8, 12.3, and 9.8 kDa, respectively (Fig.2A). A trace amount of cleaved GST domain was detected in the purified non-fused N1c fragment by Western blotting (Fig.2B, right). However, this contaminated GST protein could be easily removed by incubation of the purified non-fused N1c fragment fractions at 65 °C for 2 min followed by centrifugation. These results indicate that the non-fused N1c fragment of T. thermophilus Nqo3 subunit is heat-stable. The purified GST-fused N1c fragment was light brown, indicating that it contained iron-sulfur clusters. As shown in Fig.3A, its UV-visible absorption spectrum exhibited very small but characteristic absorbance of iron-sulfur clusters. The contents of the non-heme Fe and acid-labile S2− in the preparation were 0.1–0.2 atoms/mol. We attempted to reconstitute iron-sulfur clusters in vitro by following our previous reports (7Yano T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28606-28611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11Yano T. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5907-5913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) by applying several different conditions regarding pH, protein concentration, Fe and S2−concentrations, incubation time, and so forth. Because higher concentrations of proteins, Fe, and S2− in the reaction mixture readily cause aggregation of the fragments, it was necessary to maintain lower concentrations of these factors (10–15 μmof protein; five to six times excess of Fe2+ and S2−) to ensure a high efficiency of reconstitution. The Fe2+ form in ferrous ammonium sulfate was preferred to Fe3+ form in ferric chloride for our reconstitution, and the reconstitution reaction was allowed to proceed at pH 8.0 for at least 2–3 h. Once the iron-sulfur cluster was reconstituted, the protein became stable at room temperature and anaerobic conditions for 1–2 weeks without any observable change. The reconstituted GST-fused N1c protein contained 1.8–3.1 atoms of Fe and 1.5–3.6 atoms of S2−/mol. The relative molecular mass of the reconstituted GST-fused N1c fragment was determined to be ∼40 kDa by the molecular exclusion column chromatography, indicating that the reconstituted GST-fused N1c fragment is a monomer. This excludes a possibility of inter-subunit ligation of the iron-sulfur cluster. The GST segment was removed by thrombin digestion, and the non-fused N1c fragments were purified by a glutathione-affinity column and DEAE column chromatography. Although this digestion and the following isolation procedures appeared to result in a slight loss of the iron-sulfur clusters, the isolated non-fused N1c fragment still contained 0.7–1.5 atoms of Fe and 0.7–1.2 atoms of S2−/mol. The absorption spectra of the reconstituted GST-fused N1c fragment (as prepared) exhibited a broad absorption peak around"

One of the p160 proteins (GRIP1) is tethered to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) through κB-responsive elements, most likely via NF-κB, with which it also associates through its coactivator motifs (LXXLL motifs, “NR boxes”). Indeed, the Tat-stimulated κB-defective HIV-1 LTR had a markedly impaired response to GRIP1, whereas NR box-defective GRIP1 proteins lost part of their Tat coactivator effect on the HIV-1 LTR. Through its N-terminal basic helix-loop-helix and C-terminal domains, GRIP1 binds to the N-terminal region of Tat and to the host cell protein cyclin T1, respectively, which is normally complexed with CDK9 as P-TEFb. Thus, NF-κB is crucial for tethering p160 coactivator molecules to the HIV-1 LTR, allowing full activation of this promoter by Tat. Interestingly, cotransfection of Tat, GRIP1, and cyclin T1 enhanced not only the activity of the HIV-1 LTR, but also the glucocorticoid receptor-mediated stimulation of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter, suggesting that Tat can also attract the P-TEFb complex to the MMTV LTR through GRIP1. Thus, it appears that the coactivator complexes of the HIV-1 and MMTV LTRs both include p160 coactivators and use similar coactivator and elongation complexes for their transcription. Tat may function as an adaptor molecule, efficiently stimulating the processes of transcription initiation and elongation through potentiation of the coupling of p160 coactivators and the P-TEFb complex.

Genet. 1999; 33: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Tat, an 86-amino acid HIV-1-encoded protein, is tethered to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) by binding to a small transcribed viral RNA stem-loop structure called TAR (transactivationresponse region) (2Tang H. Kuhen K.L. Wong-Staal F. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Feng S. Holland E.C. Nature. 1988; 334: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The transactivation domain of Tat, localized in the N-terminal region of the molecule, strongly interacts with cyclin T1, a component of P-TEFb (positive-actingtranscription elongation factor-b), which also contains CDK9 (cyclin-dependentkinase-9) or PIALRE (4Wei P.

Grana X. Peterlin B.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7154-7159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This complex phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II and is required for the elongation of transcription of many genes (6Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Thus, Tat enhances transcription by tethering P-TEFb to the HIV-1 LTR and by facilitating the transcription elongation step. Coactivators play an essential role in the transactivating activity of many transcription factors (7McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). They accomplish this by transducing transcription signals to the transcription initiation complex and to downstream transcription machinery. Coactivators also possess histone acetyltransferase activity, by which they loosen DNA revolutions around nucleosomes (7McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar, 8Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and enhance transcription by increasing accessibility of other transcription factors and machinery to the promoter region. Among them, one family of coactivator molecules consisting of the homologous p300 and CBP (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein) may serve as macromolecular docking “platforms” for transcription factors from several signal transduction cascades, including nuclear receptors, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, AP-1, NF-κB, p53, Ras-dependent growth factor, and the STAT (signal transducer and activator oftranscription) proteins (8Glass C.K.

Because of their central position in many signal transduction cascades, the p300/CBP coactivators have also been called co-integrators. p/CAF, originally reported as a human homolog of yeast Gcn5 that interacts with p300/CBP, is also a broad coactivator with histone acetyltransferase activity (8Glass C.K.

Recently, Tat was shown to interact with p300/CBP and p/CAF, which play an important role in the transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR. p300 enhances the transcription of the HIV-1 LTR incorporated in the host genome (20Marzio G.

They also modulate the binding affinity of Tat for TAR and cyclin T1 by acetylating Tat at specific lysine residues. Coactivator molecules interacting preferentially with nuclear receptors have been described and include members of the p160 family of proteins: SRC1 (steroid receptorcoactivator-1); TIF-II (transcription intermediary factor) or GRIP1 (glucocorticoidreceptor-interactingpolypeptide-1), also called SRC2; and p/CIP (p300/CBP/co-integrator-associatedprotein), activator of thyroid receptor, or RAC3, also called SRC3 (7McKenna N.J.

Chen J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). They contain one or more copies of the coactivator signature motif sequence LXXLL, which is necessary for interaction with the nuclear hormone receptors (8Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

On the nuclear receptor-responsive promoters, p300/CBP, p/CAF, and p160 coactivators form complexes via their mutual interaction domains and activate the downstream transcription cascade. Among them, p160 coactivators are first tethered to the promoter region and play a central role in efficiently attracting p300/CBP and possibly p/CAF to the transcriptosome (25Shang Y. Hu X.

Also, we have shown that Vpr markedly potentiates glucocorticoid receptor action on glucocorticoid-responsive element-containing promoters such as the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) LTR, acting as a nuclear receptor coactivator (30Kino T. Gragerov A. Kopp J.B. Stauber R.H. Pavlakis G.N. Chrousos G.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Like p300/CBP and the p160 coactivators, Vpr contains the coactivator signature motif LXXLL at amino acids 64–68. Vpr binds to p300 at the region between amino acids 2045 and 2191, which also interacts with p160 coactivators, and efficiently attracts p300 to the promoter, similar to p160 coactivators (30Kino T.

Pavlakis, submitted for publication.2T. Kino, A. Gragerov, G. P. Chrousos, and G. N. Pavlakis, submitted for publication. Interestingly, Vpr also enhances the HIV-1 LTR activity using its LXXLL motif and p300-binding site, suggesting that Vpr enhances both the glucocorticoid-responsive promoter and the HIV-1 LTR through a similar mechanism.2 Therefore, we examined the possibility that the HIV-1 LTR employs a similar coactivator complex for its transactivation as a glucocorticoid-responsive promoter. Here, we show that a host nuclear receptor coactivator p160 protein functions as a coactivator of Tat on the HIV-1 LTR, bridging promoter-bound proteins and the Tat-P-TEFb complex. BS-Tat contains Tat cDNA, which encodes amino acids 1–86 (two exons) of Tat. L3-Luc possesses the full-length HIV-1 LTR promoter, which drives the luciferase reporter gene. HIV-LTR-Luc and mκB-HIV-LTR-Luc, which possess the luciferase gene under the control of the wild-type HIV-1 LTR or an HIV-1 LTR mutant with its two κB sites deleted, respectively, were kind gifts from Dr. K. L. Calame (Columbia University, New York). MMTV-LTR-Luc contains the full-length MMTV LTR promoter, which contains four glucocorticoid-responsive element sites, and was a generous gift from Dr. G. L.

Rosenfeld (University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA), respectively. pSG5-p/CIP was constructed by inserting the cDNA of p/CIP from the pCMX-p/CIP into pSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla). pSG5-GRIP1-fl, pSG5-GRIP1-NRB-IIm, pSG5-GRIP1-NRB-IIIm, and pSG5-GRIP1-NRB-II+IIIm, which express wild-type GRIP1 and the corresponding NR (nuclear receptor-binding) box-defective GRIP1 proteins, were generous gifts from Dr. M. R. Stallcup (University of Southern California, Los Angeles). pSG5-GRIP1-NRB-Im and pSG5-GRIP1-NRB-I+II+IIIm were constructed by introducing mutations that replaced the first and second leucines of the LXXLL motif located at amino acids 641–645 with alanines using the PCR-assisted mutagenesis reaction with pGS5-GRIP1-fl and pGS5-GRIP1-NRB-II+IIIm as templates. pGEX-4T3-GRIP1-(1–1462), pGEX-4T3-GRIP1-(1–301), pGEX-4T3-GRIP1-(596–774), pGEX-4T3-GRIP1-(740–1217), pGEX-4T3-GRIP1-(1101–1462), pGEX-4T3-GRIP1-(1–97), pGEX-4T3-GRIP1-(99–227), and pGEX-4T3-GRIP1-(247–344) were constructed by inserting GRIP1 cDNA fragments which encode the corresponding polypeptides into pGEX-4T3. pM-GRIP1-(1–1462), pM-GRIP1-(300–1462), pM-GRIP1-(1–1217), pM-GRIP1-(300–1217), pM-GRIP1-(1–301), pM-GRIP1-(300–640), pM-GRIP1-(596–774), pM-GRIP1-(740–1217), and pM-GRIP1-(1101–1462) were constructed by subcloning the cDNA fragments of the corresponding portions of GRIP1 into pM. pcDNA3-HA-CDK9, pcDNA3-HA-cyclin T1, pcDNA3-HA-cyclin T2a, and pcDNA3-HA-cyclin T2b were kind gifts from Dr. D.

M. Evans (Salk Institute, La Jolla). pcDNA3, Bluescript SK(+), and pSV40-β-gal were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), Stratagene, and Promega (Madison, WI), respectively. A204 cells were transfected using Lipofectin (Invitrogen). Jurkat cells were transfected by electroporation (960 microfarads, 250 mV). HeLa cells were transfected by the method as previously described (30Kino T. Gragerov A. Kopp J.B. Stauber R.H. Pavlakis G.N. Chrousos G.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To keep the same amount of DNA, vacant plasmids or Bluescript SK(+) was employed. For experiments using MMTV LTR or HIV-1 LTR constructs as reporter plasmids, 1.0–2.0 μg/well or 20 μg/cuvette coactivator-expressing plasmids with 1.5 μg/well or 15 μg/cuvette MMTV-LTR-Luc or 0.5 or 5 μg/well HIV-1 LTR constructs with 0.5 or 5 μg/well pSV40-β-gal were used for A204 and HeLa cells or Jurkat cells, respectively. The cells were transfected or treated with 1.0 μg/well or 10 μg/cuvette BS-Tat or 10−6m dexamethasone 24 h after transfection, and cell lysates were collected after a 48-h transfection. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined as previously described (30Kino T. Gragerov A. Kopp J.B. Stauber R.H. Pavlakis G.N. Chrousos G.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 32Kino T. Nordeen S.K. Chrousos G.P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 70: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown in 175-cm2 flasks and transfected with 20 μg/flask pM-Tat, pcDNA3-HA-cyclin T1, and pSG5-GRIP1-fl. Cell lysis and co-immunoprecipitation were carried out using lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 400 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and CompleteTM tablets (one tablet/50 ml;Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Proteins were precipitated by anti-GRIP1 or anti-Gal4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) bound to protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After blotting on nitrocellulose membrane, Gal4-fused Tat or hemagglutinin-tagged cyclin T1 was visualized using anti-Gal4 or anti-hemagglutinin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. 35S-Labeled SRC1a, p/CIP, wild-type and mutant GRIP1 proteins, Tat, cyclin T1, and glucocorticoid receptor-α were generated by in vitrotranslation using pSG5-SRC1a, pCMX-p/CIP, pSG5-GRIP1, pGEM2-Tat, pcDNA3-HA-cyclin T1, and pGR107 as templates, respectively. Interaction was tested with GST-fused Tat, GRIP, and cyclin T1 fragments or GST protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 1.5 h. For Tat or GST-Tat, interactions were tested in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After vigorous washing with the buffer, proteins were eluted and separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel.

Vpr potentiates both the Tat-stimulated HIV-1 LTR and the dexamethasone-stimulated MMTV LTR by efficiently attracting p300 through two distinct domains, an LXXLL motif and a p300-binding site.2 This prompted us to examine the contribution of p160 coactivators, which also contain LXXLL motifs and a p300-binding site, to the HIV-1 LTR. As shown in Fig.1 (A–C, left panels), SRC1a, GRIP1, and p/CIP increased Tat-stimulated HIV-1 LTR activity by 3–5-fold depending on the cell lines and coactivators employed. Of the three coactivators, GRIP1 showed the most potent effect on the HIV-1 LTR. As expected, these coactivators similarly increased dexamethasone-stimulated MMTV LTR activity in the same cell lines (Fig. 1, A–C, right panels), suggesting that the HIV-1 LTR uses p160 coactivators for its transcriptional activation, similar to the glucocorticoid-responsive MMTV LTR. p160 coactivators interact with the p50 subunit of NF-κB and enhance its responsive promoters (33Na S.Y.

McInerney E. Westin S. Thanos D. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the HIV-1 LTR contains two κB-responsive elements, we examined the possibility that p160 coactivators are attracted to the HIV-1 LTR through NF-κB. In HeLa cells, GRIP1 partially lost its enhancing effect on a κB-mutated HIV-1 LTR, suggesting that κB sites are in part necessary for the attraction of GRIP1 (Fig. 2A). We tested the contribution of nuclear receptor-binding sites of p160 coactivators to the HIV-1 LTR by employing four GRIP1 mutants defective in one or all of the LXXLL motifs. GRIP1 proteins defective in NR boxes II and III partially lost their enhancing effect on the Tat-stimulated wild-type HIV-1 LTR in HeLa cells, whereas the NR box I mutant showed derepression. The GRIP1 mutant defective in all three NR boxes showed a partial effect (Fig. 2B). We compared the activities of these GRIP1 NR box mutants on the HIV-1 LTR with those on the MMTV LTR and a κB-responsive promoter to further investigate the mechanism of contribution. All NR box-mutated GRIP1 mutants dramatically lost their enhancing effect on the MMTV LTR, whereas they similarly lost some of their effect on the HIV-1 LTR, suggesting that NR boxes of GRIP1 are functional regarding its effect on the HIV-1 LTR, possibly through the transcriptional activity of NF-κB (Fig. 2B). Because p160 coactivators strongly enhanced the Tat-stimulated HIV-1 LTR, we next examined the possibility that Tat and p160 coactivators form complexes in human cells. Because Tat is known to associate with cyclin T1, we also examined the involvement of this protein in the complex. We transfected cells with vectors expressing Gal4 DNA-binding domain-fused Tat and hemagglutinin-tagged cyclin T1 and precipitated a potential complex using specific antibodies against GRIP1 or Gal4. The precipitates were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were visualized by probing with the indicated antibodies. Tat and cyclin T1 were co-immunoprecipitated by the anti-GRIP1 antibody (Fig. 3), indicating that these proteins form a complex with GRIP1 in HeLa cells. To further examine Tat/p160 coactivator binding, we next used a GST pull-down assay. In vitro translated and labeled p160 coactivators SRC1a, GRIP1, and p/CIP all bound to bacterially produced GST-fused Tat protein (Fig.4A). We constructed GST-fused GRIP1 fragment-expressing plasmids to localize the binding site of Tat on this molecule (Fig. 4B). We also examined the binding of cyclin T1 to GRIP1 fragments. Tat interacted strongly with GRIP1-(1–301) and weakly with GRIP1-(740–1217). Cyclin T1 also interacted with GRIP1-(1–301) and GRIP1-(1101–1462), but not with GRIP1-(740–1217). Neither Tat nor cyclin T1 bound to the domains of GRIP1 that interact with nuclear receptors (Fig. 4C) (2Tang H. Kuhen K.L. Wong-Staal F. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 4Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A.

As positive controls, we examined the interactions of dexamethasone-bound glucocorticoid receptor-α and GRIP1. The former bound to GRIP1-(596–774) strongly and to GRIP1-(740–1217) weakly, as previously reported (35Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol.

Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Because GRIP-(1–301) interacts strongly with both Tat and cyclin T1, we determined a narrower region containing the specific binding site(s). Interestingly, both Tat and cyclin T1 efficiently bound to the GRIP1-(1–97) sequence, which has a basic helix-loop-helix polypeptide conformation (Fig. 4D) (7McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar, 23Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). We also examined their in vitro binding in a mammalian two-hybrid assay and obtained similar results (data not shown). To determine the Tat- and cyclin T1-specific binding sites for GRIP1, we made a series of GST-Tat and GST-cyclin T1 fragment-expressing plasmids. Fig. 5 (A andB) shows the functional domains of Tat and cyclin T1 and the GST-Tat and GST-cyclin T1 fragment fusion proteins employed, respectively. GRIP1 interacted with Tat-(1–86), Tat-(1–72), and Tat-(1–40) (Fig. 5C), i.e. the N terminus, which also contains its transactivation domain and the binding site for cyclin T1 (Fig. 5A) (2Tang H. Kuhen K.L. Wong-Staal F. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 4Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). GRIP1 interacted with cyclin T1-(1–308) and cyclin T1-(1–255), which also contain the domain that binds to the Tat molecule (Fig. 5D) (4Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). To examine the in vivo relevance of the in vitroTat/GRIP1 binding, we examined the effect of GRIP1 fragments defective in binding to Tat and/or cyclin T1 on the Tat-stimulated HIV-1 LTR in HeLa cells (Fig. 6A). GRIP1-(300–1462) defective in its N-terminal portion dramatically lost its enhancing effect on the Tat-stimulated HIV-1 LTR. GRIP1-(1–1217), which did not have its C-terminal portion, however, also partially lost its stimulatory effect. GRIP1-(300–1217), defective in both the N and C termini, became completely inactive for the Tat-stimulated HIV-1 LTR. We next examined the effect of shorter GRIP1 fragments on the GRIP1 enhancement of the Tat-stimulated HIV-1 LTR (Fig. 6B). GRIP1-(1–301), GRIP1-(740–1217), and GRIP1-(1101–1462) all strongly abolished the GRIP1 enhancement of the HIV-1 LTR, whereas GRIP1-(300–640), which did not interact with Tat and cyclin T1, did not show such an effect. Because GRIP1 interacted with both Tat and cyclin T1 and functioned as a coactivator of Tat on the HIV-1 LTR, we examined the possibility that P-TEFb may be involved in transactivation of the glucocorticoid-responsive promoter. Three different P-TEFb proteins containing three different isoforms of cyclin T (T1, T2a, and T2b) are known, formed by each of these cyclin T proteins and CDK9. All three P-TEFb proteins significantly increased the dexamethasone-stimulated MMTV LTR in HeLa cells (Fig.7A). Cyclin T2b was the most potent of the cyclin T isoforms on the MMTV LTR. Interestingly, Tat transfection moderately increased the luciferase activity of the dexamethasone-stimulated MMTV LTR in HeLa cells in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 7B). When we cotransfected Tat, P-TEFb components cyclin T1 and CDK9, and GRIP1 altogether, we observed strong synergy in increasing dexamethasone-stimulated MMTV LTR activity (Fig. 7C). These results indicate that Tat and P-TEFb function as enhancer molecules in the glucocorticoid receptor transactivation system, cooperating with p160 coactivators. This also supports the hypothesis that Tat modulates the association of p160 coactivators and the P-TEFb complex. All three subtypes of p160 coactivators, including SRC1a, GRIP1, and p/CIP, enhanced the Tat-stimulated HIV-1 LTR in three different cell lines, functioning as coactivators of the HIV-1 LTR (Fig. 1, A–C). Tat bound to all three p160 coactivators and interacted strongly with the amino-terminal region of GRIP1, which contains a basic helix-loop-helix domain, and to a lesser degree with the GRIP1-(740–1217) region, which contains one of the transactivation domains of GRIP1 (Fig. 4, A, C, and D) (7McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar, 23Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Cyclin T1 also bound GRIP1 at the same basic helix-loop-helix domain and moderately at GRIP1-(1101–1462), which contains the second transactivation domain of GRIP1 (Fig. 4, C and D) (7McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar, 23Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). All these GRIP1 fragments were necessary for the Tat enhancement of the HIV-1 LTR (Fig. 6). Because p300 and p/CAF are known to be present in the HIV-1 LTR (20Marzio G. Tyagi M. Gutierrez M.I.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6106-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), the HIV-1 promoter appears to develop a coactivator complex, which is reminiscent of the classic nuclear receptor coactivator complex formed on the MMTV LTR. Tat/HIV-1 LTR and nuclear receptor-driven promoters also share Tip60 (Tat-interacting protein of60 kDa), which possesses histone acetyltransferase activity and functions as a coactivator in both promoters (41Brady M.E.

Subramanian T. Coleman D. Chinnadurai G. Virology. 1996; 216: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Therefore, the extended coactivator complex formed on the HIV-1 or MMTV LTR appears to use similar components and configurations. In the nuclear receptor-responsive promoters, p160 coactivators are first tethered to the promoter via nuclear hormone receptors and play an essential role in attracting other coactivators such as p300/CBP and p/CAF (25Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Because p160 coactivators are accumulated on the HIV-1 LTR, they might play a similar role in this promoter. p300 and p/CAF acetylate the Tat molecule, modulating the binding affinity of Tat for TAR and cyclin T1 (40Kiernan R.E. Vanhulle C. Schiltz L. Adam E. Xiao H. Maudoux F. Calomme C. Burny A. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. Benkirane M. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6106-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Because p160 coactivators contain histone acetyltransferase activity, they might also acetylate the Tat molecule and hence regulate its transactivating activity as well. The Hin-2 gene (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number U19179), which is the marker of an insertion point of the HIV-1 LTR into the human genomic DNA, encodes a protein almost identical in sequence to amino acids 1102–1462 of the human SRC1a and GRIP1 coactivators. This region of GRIP1 contains the binding site(s) for cyclin T1, necessary for the full activation of the HIV-1 LTR. Therefore, it is possible that HIV-1 might increase the expression of this protein by inserting its LTR in front of its coding sequence. In this situation, the expressed protein could enhance this promoter's activity, which may be beneficial for viral replication and proliferation. GRIP1 is indirectly tethered to the promoter partially through NF-κB-responsive elements (Fig. 2A). p50, a component of NF-κB, binds p160 coactivators and attracts them to an NF-κB-responsive promoter (33Na S.Y. Lee S.K. Han S.J. Choi H.S. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10831-10834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 34Sheppard K.A. Rose D.W. Haque Z.K. Kurokawa R. McInerney E. Westin S. Thanos D. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is quite likely that one of the major mechanisms of tethering p160 proteins to the HIV-1 LTR is via NF-κB. However, because the impact of destruction of κB-responsive elements was partial, other as yet unknown factor(s) may also contribute to the attraction of p160 proteins. Because the HIV-1 LTR contains binding sites for several transcription factors in addition to those for NF-κB, one or more of such transcription factors might also bind to and attract p160 proteins. The HIV-1 LTR appears to employ the LXXLL motifs of p160 coactivators for its transcriptional activation (Fig. 2B). In our hands, the effect of NR box-defective p160 coactivators on the activity of the HIV-1 LTR was similar to that observed on the κB-defective promoter. We demonstrated that NR boxes II and III positively contributed to transcription, whereas NR box I showed the opposite effect. A previous report suggested the positive involvement of the NR box II LXXLL motif of SRC1 in NF-κB-stimulated transcription (34Sheppard K.A. Rose D.W. Haque Z.K. Kurokawa R. McInerney E. Westin S. Thanos D. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for the discrepancy between our results and those of the previous report is not known; however, it may be explained by the difference in the p160 coactivators employed: we used GRIP1, whereas the previous study employed SRC1. Alternatively, it may be because we used a different experimental system. We employed transient expression of GRIP1 mutant molecules, whereas the other study employed microinjection of neutralizing antibody for NR box domains. Although the mechanistic implication of LXXLL in the HIV-1 LTR remains unclear, it is likely that the HIV-1 LTR accumulates as yet unknown protein(s), which may interact with the LXXLL motifs of p160 coactivators. One such candidate protein may be a nuclear receptor. Indeed, several nuclear receptors are known to be associated with the HIV-1 LTR (43Sawaya B.E. Rohr O. Aunis D. Schaeffer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23572-23576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 44Desai-Yajnik V. Hadzic E. Modlinger P. Malhotra S. Gechlik G. Samuels H.H. J.

Also recently, the glucocorticoid receptor was found in the transcription complex formed on an NF-κB-responsive promoter by a chromatin immunoprecipitation method (47Nissen R.M. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2314-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Because only the heterodimer form of NF-κB, composed of the p65 and p50 subunits, associates with p160 proteins in vivo (34Sheppard K.A. Rose D.W. Haque Z.K. Kurokawa R. McInerney E. Westin S. Thanos D. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that interaction of NF-κB with p160 coactivators at the promoter region is necessary for Tat and/or cyclin T1 to properly regulate the HIV-1 LTR. p160 coactivators contain two transactivation domains, activation domain (AD) 1 and AD2 (16McKenna N.J. Xu J. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 23Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Some of the AD1 activity is catalyzed by interaction with p300/CBP, whereas the mechanism of AD2 transactivation is not clear. The methyltransferase CARM1 binds to AD2 and enhances transcription of some nuclear receptor-responsive promoters (48Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). We showed that cyclin T1 binds at the N-terminal and AD2 regions of GRIP1 (Fig. 4, B and C), and both domains contribute to GRIP1 enhancement of Tat activity. Myocyte enhancer factor-2C, a transcription factor important for muscle differentiation, also binds N- and C-terminal portions of GRIP1 (31Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that these two regions form a composite transactivation domain in the three-dimensional GRIP1 molecule. The P-TEFb complex might explain some activity of this hypothetical transactivation domain in p160 coactivators. We showed that Tat and the P-TEFb complex also enhanced dexamethasone-stimulated MMTV LTR activity (Fig. 7A). This suggests that the P-TEFb complex also contributes to the transcription of glucocorticoid-responsive genes through p160 coactivators and provides evidence that GRIP1, Tat, and cyclin T1 are functionally associated in vivo. It appears that Tat enhances the interaction between P-TEFb and a coactivator complex containing GRIP1 and/or other p160 molecules by positioning itself sequentially between the transcription initiation step, organized by the coactivator complex, and the transcription elongation step, governed by the P-TEFb complex. Thus, Tat enhances transcription from both the HIV-1 LTR and a glucocorticoid-responsive promoter (Fig.8). p160 coactivators may provide a binding domain for Tat, functioning as a platform for the regulation of the HIV-1 LTR activity by Tat, TAR, and P-TEFb and of the MMTV LTR activity by Tat and P-TEFb.

https://openalex.org/W2038055852,"Thyroid papillary carcinomas are characterized by RET/PTC rearrangements that cause the tyrosine kinase domain of the RET receptor to fuse with N-terminal sequences encoded by heterologous genes. This results in the aberrant expression of a ligand-independent and constitutively active RET kinase. We analysed actin reorganization induced by the RET/PTC1 oncogene in PC Cl 3 rat thyroid epithelial cells. Differently from oncogenes Src, Ras and Raf, RET/PTC1 caused actin filaments to form prominent stress fibers. Moreover, stress fibers were identified in human thyroid papillary carcinoma cell lines harboring RET/PTC1 rearrangements but not in thyroid carcinoma cells negative for RET/PTC rearrangements. RET/MEN 2A, a constitutively active but unrearranged membrane-bound RET oncoprotein, did not induce stress fibers in PC Cl 3 cells. Induction of stress fibers by RET/PTC1 was restricted to thyroid cells; it did not occur in NIH3T3 fibroblasts or MCF7 mammary cells. RET/PTC1-mediated stress fiber formation depended on Rho but not Rac small GTPase activity. In addition, inhibition of Rho, but not of Rac, caused apoptosis of RET/PTC1-expressing thyroid cells. We conclude that Rho is implicated in the actin reorganization and cell survival mediated by the chimeric RET/PTC1 oncogene in thyroid epithelial cells, both phenotypes being cell type- and oncogene type-specific."

Numerous functions for MT1-MMP, the most abundant and active MT-MMP, have been described in various biological settings; however, key structural elements that influence the activity of the enzyme still remain to be elucidated. In particular, the role of the MT1-MMP propeptide domain has not been established. The primary role of the propeptide region of secreted MMPs involves maintaining the latency of the proenzymes (1Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3890) Google Scholar, 2Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A.

In the case of MT1-MMP, the propeptide region appears to mediate additional functions that are critical for enzymatic activity (6Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34745-34752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Cao J. Rehemtulla A. Bahou W. Zucker S. J. Biol.

Recent studies indicate that the propeptide of MT1-MMP acts as an intramolecular chaperone for the enzyme (16Cao J. Hymowitz M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29648-29653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Genetically engineered MT1-MMP lacking the propeptide domain, ΔproMT1-MMP, is not functionally competent when expressed on the surface of transfected cells, despite the fact that this recombinant protein contains the essential sequence information of the mature form of MT1-MMP. Co-transfection of incompetent cells with propeptide cDNA of MT1-MMP in trans along with ΔproMT1-MMP restores proteolytic activity. Chaperone function has not been attributed to the propeptides of secreted MMPs. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that the propeptide of MMP-3 does not serve as a chaperone for this secreted enzyme (17Wetmore D.R. Hardman K.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6549-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The prodomains of non-membrane-bound bacterial proteases, such as subtilisin and α-lytic protease (18Shinde U.P. Liu J.J.

Biol. 2000; 477: 261-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), confer chaperone function to the respective enzymes. Propeptide-deleted forms or mutants in critical amino acids required for the chaperone function of these enzymes are misfolded and inactive. Denatured mature proteases lacking the propeptide domain can be refolded properly in the presence of their respective propeptide domains and restore the enzymatic function (18Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although membrane type MMPs share structure homology with secreted MMPs, they also contain unique sequences that may confer different features to the enzymes of this subgroup. In this study we have addressed the role in folding and trafficking of MT1-MMP of a unique sequence in the propeptide of MT1-MMP, which is remarkably conserved in all six members of the membrane type MMPs, but not in secreted MMPs (Fig. 1A). To assess the contribution of this four-amino acid sequence, 42YGYL45, to the chaperone activity of the propeptide, we targeted the sequence for mutational analysis. Constructs containing Ala substitutions for a single or a pair of adjacent residues in this sequence were expressed in COS-1 cells and tested for function in terms of binding TIMP-2 and activation of proMMP-2. The function of the MT1-MMP constructs was also evaluated in terms of the ability of respective transfected cells to migrate in situ over a fibronectin substrate (23Nakahara H. Howard L.

In the studies described here, mutations in this conserved42YGYL45 region were demonstrated to be detrimental for MT1-MMP function. These results indicate that this four-amino acid sequence within the propeptide domain of MT1-MMP contains important conformational information for the folding of MT1-MMP and constitutes an important component of the intramolecular chaperone moiety of the propeptide. Chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma except for fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) hydrochloride, which was purchased from Research Organics (Cleveland, OH). Human fibronectin was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Restriction enzymes were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The pSG5 expression vector was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Monoclonal antibody against the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP (Ab-114) was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), polyclonal antibodies against the hinge region of MT1-MMP (AB815) were from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA).

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies were both from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- and Texas Red isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies, respectively, were from Rockland (Gilbertsville, PA). Human proMMP-2 was purified from transfected COS-1 cells as described previously (15Cao J. Rehemtulla A. Bahou W. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30174-30180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar,30Cao J. Sato H. Takino T. Seiki M. J. Biol.

COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2. MT1-MMP cDNA encoding an open reading frame from amino acids Met1–Val582 was cloned in a pSG5 expression vector employing a SV40 promoter (6Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34745-34752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This construct was used as a template for the introduction of double Ala substitutions in the desired positions of the N-terminal propeptide domain of MT1-MMP. Construction of the mutated forms was accomplished by PCR amplification using partially overlapping mutagenic primers as follows. For substitutions of Tyr42-Gly43 to Ala-Ala (Y42A/G43A), a PCR fragment coding for the signal and part of the propeptide domains of MT1-MMP containing the desired mutations was generated by amplifying the MT1-MMP cDNA with the 5′ end MT1-MMP forward primer (5′ to 3′, CACGAATTCCGGACCATGTCTCCCGCCCCAAGA) and mutagenic reverse primer (5′ to 3′, AAGGCAGCTTGCTGTAGCCAGGCTTC), whereas the PCR fragment coding for the rest of the MT1-MMP molecule starting at the mutation site, down to the C-terminal end, was amplified using a forward primer complementary to the mutagenic reverse primer (5′ to 3′, TGGCTACAGCAAGCTGCCTACCTGCCTCCCGGG; nucleotides corresponding to altered amino acid residues are underlined) and the 3′ end MT1-MMP reverse primer (5′ to 3′, CACGAATTCTCAGACCTTGTCCAGGGAAC). Full-length mutated MT1-MMP was obtained using the 5 and 3′ end primers of wild-type MT1-MMP and a mix of the PCR generated fragments as templates. The resulting PCR fragment was inserted in pSG5 using the EcoRI site. Mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The rest of the mutants were generated in a similar way using the following mutagenic primers (5′ to 3′ end): for Gly43-Tyr44 to Ala-Ala (G43A/Y44A), forward primer (CTACAGCAATATGCCGCCCTGCCTCCCGGGGAC) and reverse primer (AAGGCGGCATATTGCTGTAGCCAGGC); for Tyr44-Leu45 to Ala-Ala (Y44A/L45A), forward primer (CAGCAATATGGCGCCGCGCCTCCCGGGGACCTA) and reverse primer (AACGCGGCGCCATATTGCTGTAGCCA); for Ser34-Pro35 to Ala-Ala (S34A/P35A), forward primer (CCCAAAGCAGCAGCTTCGCCGCCGAAGCCTGG) and reverse primer (GAAGCTGCTGCTTTGGGC); for Gly48-Asp49 to Ala-Ala (G48A/D49A), forward primer (ATGGCTACCTGCCTCCCGCGGCCCTACGTACC) and reverse primer (GGGAGGCAGGTAGCCATA). For single Ala substitutions in MT1-MMP, the following primers were used: for Tyr42 to Ala (Y42A), forward primer (CTACAGCAAGCTGGCTACCTGCCT) and reverse primer (CAGGTAGCCAGCTTGCTGTAG); for Gly43 to Ala (G43A), forward primer (CAGCAATATCAGTACCTGCCTCCC) and reverse primer (AGGCAGGTACTGATATTGCTGTA); for Tyr44 to Ala (Y44A), forward primer (CAATATGGCGCCCTGCCTCCCGG) and reverse primer (GGGAGGCAGGGCGCCATATTGCT). ΔproMT1-MMP (MTΔPro) lacking the entire N-terminal propeptide, MTPro encoding the propeptide sequence of MT1-MMP (amino acids 1–109), and MTProHA encoding for the propeptide domain (amino acids 1–109) with the HA epitope inserted on the C terminus of the propeptide (Fig. 1B) were constructed as described before (16Cao J. Hymowitz M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29648-29653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Construction of 108ARAA111 has been described previously (15Cao J. Rehemtulla A. Bahou W. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30174-30180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For MT1-MMPHA carrying the HA insertion between amino acids Val107 and Arg108 forward primer (TACCCCTACGACGTGCCCGACTACGCCCGAAGGAAGCGCTACGCCATC; nucleotides coding for the HA epitope are underlined) and reverse primer (GGCGTAGTCGGGCACGTCGTAGGGGTAAACATTGGCCTTGATCTCAGC) were employed. Plasmids carrying wild-type or mutant MT1-MMP were transiently transfected in COS-1 cells using the calcium phosphate method. By the end of transfection time, cells were washed with PBS and allowed to recover and express proteins for an additional 20–30 h in DMEM/fetal calf serum media before being used for further analysis (30Cao J. Sato H. Takino T. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 801-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Schematic diagrams of all mutants are shown in Fig.1B. Recombinant TIMP-2, kindly provided by Y. DeClerck and K. Langley, was iodinated as previously described and binding of 125I-labeled TIMP-2 to COS-1 cells propagated in 24-well dishes was performed in duplicate as described previously (6Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34745-34752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For equilibrium binding experiments, dilutions of125I-labeled TIMP-2 (0.3–6 nm) in bovine serum albumin/PBS/Ca2+ were added to cells in the presence or absence of excess unlabeled recombinant TIMP-2. After 3 h of incubation at 4 °C, supernatant fluid and washes were collected as the unbound 125I-TIMP-2 fraction. Cell monolayers were then lysed in 0.1% SDS in 0.1 n NaOH and collected as the bound fraction. Bound and unbound 125I-TIMP-2 was measured by γ counting. The residual radioactivity associated with cells in the nonspecific binding experiment (20-fold excess TIMP-2) was subtracted from the total bound fraction (no unlabeled TIMP-2) to give specific binding. Scatchard plot analysis of binding data was used to create best fit curves. Cells transiently transfected with wild-type or mutant MT1-MMP were seeded on glass or FITC-fibronectin-coated coverslips, and incubated in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. After 17 h of incubation, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. For the detection of plasma membrane-bound MT1-MMP by immunofluorescence, fixed cells were subsequently treated as follows. After washing with PBS and blocking with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, cells were incubated with polyclonal antibody against the hinge region of MT1-MMP for 2 h at room temperature, washed four times with PBS, incubated with Texas Red isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, and washed four times with PBS. When detection of TIMP-2 (endogenous TIMP-2 bound on the cell surface) or HA epitope was required, respective monoclonal antibodies against TIMP-2 or HA epitope were included in the solution of primary antibody against MT1-MMP, followed by incubation with a mixture of FITC-labeled anti-mouse antibodies together with the TRITC-labeled anti-rabbit antibody. Coverslips were then washed with PBS and finally mounted on microscope slides over a drop of Vecta-Shield anti-fading mounting solution. Staining was visualized using an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope. FITC-labeled fibronectin was prepared and used for coating glass coverslips as described by Nakahara et al. (23Nakahara H. Howard L. Thompson E.W. Sato H. Seiki M. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7959-7964Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Briefly, FITC-labeled fibronectin (50 μg/ml) was layered over 12-mm glass coverslips precoated with a thin film of cross-linked gelatin and allowed to bind at room temperature for 1 h. Coverslips were then washed with PBS, sterilized with 70% ethanol, and transferred to a 12-well tissue culture plate where they were equilibrated in serum-free DMEM medium until use. Cells transiently transfected with wild-type or mutant MT1-MMP, usually 30 h after transfection, were seeded on FITC-fibronectin-coated coverslips, and incubated in a 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator. Where indicated, recombinant TIMP-2 or TIMP-1 was included in the conditioned media of transfected MT1-MMP cells in a concentration of 200 nm. After 17 h of incubation, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde. For the detection of plasma membrane-bound MT1-MMP by immunofluorescence, cells were fixed and treated as described. Before mounting on microscope slides, coverslips were quenched for autofluorescence with NaBH4 and washed with PBS. Degradation of the fluorescein substrate and migration of the cells through the degradation pathway, as well as cell surface location of MT1-MMP, were visualized using an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope. 30 h after transfection, COS-1 cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with recombinant proMMP-2 in serum-free DMEM. Conditioned medium was collected after 20 h and subjected to gelatin zymogram as described (15Cao J. Rehemtulla A. Bahou W. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30174-30180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Gelatin lysis bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis as described previously (15Cao J. Rehemtulla A. Bahou W. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30174-30180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells, transfected with the plasmid encoding wild-type MT1-MMP as described under “Materials and Methods,” were seeded on coverslips precoated with FITC-labeled fibronectin. Following 17 h of incubation, cells on coverslips were fixed and immunostained for cell-surface MT1-MMP. As shown in Fig.2 (row B,middle panel), dark areas on the FITC-fibronectin film depict fibronectin degradation occurring contiguous with wild-type MT1-MMP-transfected cells. Examination of films indicate that transfected cells migrated along the degradation path (Fig. 2,row B, right panel,arrow). MT1-MMP cDNA-transfected cells, positively stained for cell surface expression of the enzyme (Fig. 2, row B,right panel), and degraded fibronectin, whereas mock-transfected cells did not degrade the substrate (Fig. 2,row A, middle panel). These results indicate that the degradation of fibronectin and cell migration are associated with cell surface expression of MT1-MMP. Incubation of MT1-MMP cDNA-transfected cells in the presence of TIMP-2 inhibited both fibronectin degradation and cell migration (Fig.2, row D), thus both functions are MMP-dependent. On the other hand, the presence of TIMP-1, which has minimal effect on other MT1-MMP functions (6Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34745-34752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), had no effect on either fibronectin degradation or cell migration (Fig. 2,row C). These results suggest that degradation of fibronectin and cell migration are MT1-MMP-dependent and are not mediated by the function of a secreted MMP, which would have been inhibited by TIMP-1. COS-1 cells were transfected with wild-type MT1-MMP cDNA, a propeptide deletion mutant of MT1-MMP cDNA referred to as ΔproMT1-MMP, or with vector cDNA alone. Specific rabbit anti-MT1-MMP antibodies were employed to demonstrate the localization of both wild-type MT1-MMP and Δpro MT1-MMP at the cell surface. To examine cell surface binding properties, TIMP-2 binding (endogenous TIMP-2) was monitored by immunofluorescence. Incubation with an anti-TIMP-2 mouse monoclonal antibody was followed by incubation with an FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody. As shown in Fig.3A, wild-type MT1-MMP cDNA-transfected cells (MT1-MMP) efficiently bound TIMP-2, but ΔproMT1-MMP cDNA-transfected cells (MTΔpro) did not. TIMP-2 binding was restored for ΔproMT1-MMP-expressing cells when they were co-transfected intrans with a plasmid encoding the propeptide domain of MT1-MMP, MTPro (Fig. 3A, MTΔPro+MTPro), although the percentage of positively stained cells was less than that of wild-type MT1-MMP-transfected cells. Transfected cells were tested in the fibronectin degradation/migration assay. Although ΔproMT1-MMP cDNA-transfected cells (Fig.3B, MTΔPro) or MTPro cDNA-transfected cells (data not shown) did not degrade the fluorescein substrate and subsequently migrate, COS-1 cells co-transfected with both ΔproMT1-MMP and MTPro in trans, exhibited both fibronectin degradation and migration similar to that observed with wild-type MT1-MMP cDNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). The percentage of transfected cells that displayed both degradation and migration was less than the respective wt MT1-MMP-transfected cells; this observation may be attributed to the lower efficiency of co-transfected cells expressing both ΔproMT1-MMP and MTPro cDNA (16Cao J. Hymowitz M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29648-29653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These results indicate that both functions, TIMP-2 binding and induction of the migratory phenotype of MT1-MMP-expressing cells, require cell synthesis of the propeptide domain of MT1-MMP for proper function of MT1-MMP at the cell surface (16Cao J. Hymowitz M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29648-29653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Previous studies from this laboratory showed that wild-type MT1-MMP is detected as a 63-kDa immunoreactive band in cell lysates of transfected COS-1 cells (6Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 29648-29653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This molecular size corresponds to the proenzyme form of MT1-MMP. However, these data cannot be used as evidence that MT1-MMP on the plasma membrane exists in the proenzyme form. Reports employing other types of cells have described furin-induced cleavage of MT1-MMP at the RRKR recognition motif in the trans-Golgi network and delivery of the mature (activated) enzyme to the cell surface (Refs. 9Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar and 32Yana I. Weiss S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2387-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar; data not shown from this laboratory). To investigate whether MT1-MMP is displayed on the cell surface in the form of the active enzyme or in the nonprocessed form of the proenzyme, COS-1 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding a full-length MT1-MMP chimera, which carries an HA tag upstream of the RRKR furin cleavage site in the propeptide domain, MT1-MMPHA. The presence of the propeptide was examined in nonpermeabilized cells by immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody against the HA epitope. Cleavage of the propeptide before trafficking to the cell membrane would remove the HA tag from the protein and consequently result in negative staining. As displayed in Fig. 3C, MT1-MMPHA cDNA-transfected cells were positively stained on the cell surface for the HA epitope (Fig.3C, MT1-MMPHA, green) indicating that MT1-MMP is transported to the plasma membrane without cleavage of the propeptide, thus in the proenzyme form. It should be noted that insertion of the HA tag did not interfere with the function of the enzyme as confirmed by the fibronectin degradation/migration assay (Fig. 3B, FITC-fibronectin,MT1-MMPHA). The next experiments investigated whether the propeptide/ΔproMT1-MMP interaction complex, which restores the function of ΔproMT1-MMP, can be detected on the surface of the co-transfected cells. To confirm detection of cell-surface associated propeptide by immunofluorescence, a cDNA coding for the isolated propeptide with a HA epitope in the C-terminal end (Fig. 1B) was co-transfected with ΔproMT1-MMP cDNA into COS-1 c"

https://openalex.org/W1975681329,"The reduction potential (E 0′) of the [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster of Azotobacter vinelandii ferredoxin I (AvFdI) and related ferredoxins is ∼200 mV more negative than the corresponding clusters of Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus ferredoxin and related ferredoxins. Previous studies have shown that these differences inE 0′ do not result from the presence or absence of negatively charged surface residues or in differences in the types of hydrophobic residues found close to the [4Fe-4S]2+/+clusters. Recently, a third, quite distinct class of ferredoxins (represented by the structurally characterized Chromatium vinosum ferredoxin) was shown to have a [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster with a very negativeE 0′ similar to that of AvFdI. The observation that the sequences and structures surrounding the very negative E 0′ clusters in quite dissimilar proteins were almost identical inspired the construction of three additional mutations in the region of the [4Fe-4S]2+/+cluster of AvFdI. The three mutations, V19E, P47S, and L44S, that incorporated residues found in the higherE 0′ P. asaccharolyticus ferredoxin all led to increases in E 0′ for a total of 130 mV with a 94-mV increase in the case of L44S. The results are interpreted in terms of x-ray structures of the FdI variants and show that the major determinant for the large increase in L44S is the introduction of an OH–S bond between the introduced Ser side chain and the Sγ atom of Cys ligand 42 and an accompanying movement of water. The reduction potential (E 0′) of the [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster of Azotobacter vinelandii ferredoxin I (AvFdI) and related ferredoxins is ∼200 mV more negative than the corresponding clusters of Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus ferredoxin and related ferredoxins. Previous studies have shown that these differences inE 0′ do not result from the presence or absence of negatively charged surface residues or in differences in the types of hydrophobic residues found close to the [4Fe-4S]2+/+clusters. Recently, a third, quite distinct class of ferredoxins (represented by the structurally characterized Chromatium vinosum ferredoxin) was shown to have a [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster with a very negativeE 0′ similar to that of AvFdI. The observation that the sequences and structures surrounding the very negative E 0′ clusters in quite dissimilar proteins were almost identical inspired the construction of three additional mutations in the region of the [4Fe-4S]2+/+cluster of AvFdI. The three mutations, V19E, P47S, and L44S, that incorporated residues found in the higherE 0′ P. asaccharolyticus ferredoxin all led to increases in E 0′ for a total of 130 mV with a 94-mV increase in the case of L44S. The results are interpreted in terms of x-ray structures of the FdI variants and show that the major determinant for the large increase in L44S is the introduction of an OH–S bond between the introduced Ser side chain and the Sγ atom of Cys ligand 42 and an accompanying movement of water. Most iron-sulfur ([Fe-S]) proteins are intimately involved in essential electron transfer reactions, including membrane-bound electron transport systems; their functions, however, are not restricted to electron transfer and include direct catalysis of hydration/dehydration reactions, O2 and iron sensing, regulation of gene expression, iron storage, metal cluster assembly, and the generation and stabilization of radical intermediates (for reviews, see Refs. 1Beinert H.

To meet these diverse functions, individual proteins have increased the variety of [Fe-S] cluster structures by adding or subtracting iron and sulfide atoms to vary the cluster type, or by introducing noncysteine ligands. Even after adopting a specific cluster type (e.g. [4Fe-4S] clusters with four cysteine ligands), proteins can control reactivity further by stabilizing a particular redox couple (e.g. 3+/2+, 2+/+, or +/0) or by modulation of the reduction potential (E 0′) of a particular redox couple (7–19). Thus, high potential iron proteins have [4Fe-4S]3+/2+ E 0′ ranging from 90 to 450 mV (7Bertini I. Gori-Savellini G. Luchinat C. J. Biol. Inorg.

Both experimental and theoretical research has been directed toward understanding how the polypeptide surrounding the cluster controls the reduction potential. Factors that have been proposed as being important include (a) solvent exposure of the cluster, (b) specific hydrogen bonding networks especially NH–S bonds, (c) the proximity and orientation of protein backbone and side chain dipoles, and/or (d) the proximity of charged residues to the cluster (7Bertini I. Gori-Savellini G. Luchinat C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 114-118Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21–35). This study concerns protein control of the reduction potential of a [4Fe-4S]2+/+cluster that is ligated via a typical CXXCXXC motif with one remote Cys ligand. Previous studies in this area have focused on comparing the environments of the clusters in structurally characterized proteins. The [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster of Azotobacter vinelandii ferredoxin I (AvFdI) 1The abbreviations used are:AvFdI andAvFdIIIA. vinelandii ferredoxin I and III, respectivelyPaFdP. asaccharolyticusferredoxinCvFdC. vinosum ferredoxinFdferredoxinFdIferredoxin IMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidEPRelectron paramagnetic resonanceTAPSN-tris[hydroxymethyl]methyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid 1The abbreviations used are:AvFdI andAvFdIIIA. vinelandii ferredoxin I and III, respectivelyPaFdP. asaccharolyticusferredoxinCvFdC. vinosum ferredoxinFdferredoxinFdIferredoxin IMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidEPRelectron paramagnetic resonanceTAPSN-tris[hydroxymethyl]methyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid has a lowE 0′ of about −620 mV (pH 7.0) (36Iismaa S.E.

Sundquist J.E. Burris R.H. Orme-Johnson W.H. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2633-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Comparison of the structures of these proteins showed that the peptide folding around the analogous clusters is highly conserved with respect to the location of the four Cys ligands, the Cys dihedral angles, and the eight amide groups hydrogen-bonded to sulfur atoms of the cluster (22Backes G. Mino Y. Loehr T.M. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Sweeney W.V. Adman E.T. Sanders-Loehr J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 2055-2064Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Although early theoretical studies suggested that the solvent access to the [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster of PaFd might explain its more positive E 0′ value, a more recent 0.95-Å structure of C. acidiurici ferredoxin failed to reveal the presence of internal water molecules (38Dauter Z.

Those substitutions, however, failed to raise the E 0′ of the [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster of AvFdI. Thus, at present both experimental and theoretical approaches have failed to determine what factors are responsible for the 200-mV difference inE 0′ for the [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters of AvFdI versus PaFd and C. acidiurici ferredoxin.

Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out as described elsewhere (29Shen B. Jollie D.R. Stout C.D. Diller T.C. Armstrong F.A. Gorst C.M., La Mar G.N. Stephens P.J. Burgess B.K. J. Biol.

Cell growth and the purification and triclinic crystallization of FdI variants were carried out as described elsewhere (39Vazquez A. Shen B. Negaard K. Iismaa S. Burgess B.K. Protein Exp. Purif. 1994; 5: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). All mutants accumulated to native levels in the cells. EPR spectra were obtained using a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer, interfaced with an Oxford liquid helium cryostat. For spin quantitation of reduced [4Fe-4S]+, the spectrum of L44S after reduction by 4 mm sodium dithionite was recorded at 15 K using 60 μm purified L44S FdI at a microwave power 12 of 1 milliwatt. Under those conditions, the EPR signal of FdI is linearly proportional to (microwave power) 12. A sample of 50 μmCu2+-EDTA used as a standard was recorded at the same EPR setting and temperature, where the signal is also linearly increasing in the function of (power) 12. Absorption spectra were recorded in 0.5-ml quartz cuvettes on a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. CD spectra were obtained using a Jasco J-500C spectropolarimeter. For UV-visible and CD measurements of reduced sample, 4 mm sodium dithionite was added to samples in a Vacuum Atmospheres anaerobic chamber. UV-visible and CD measurements were carried out using 1-ml volume cylindrical cells with fused quartz windows. Purified water of resistivity ∼18 megaohms-cm (Millipore) was used in all experiments. The buffers MES, HEPES, and TAPS and the co-adsorbate neomycin sulfate were purchased from Sigma. An AutoLab electrochemical analyzer (EcoChemie, Utrecht, The Netherlands) was used to record DC voltammograms. The three-electrode configuration featuring all glass cells has been described previously (40Armstrong F.A. Butt J.N. Sucheta A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 227: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The sample compartment (typically holding 500 μl) was maintained at 0 °C to optimize stability. AllE 0′ values are given with reference to the standard hydrogen electrode. The saturated calomel electrode was held at 22 °C, which we have adopted as E (saturated calomel reference electrode) = +243 mV versus standard hydrogen electrode (41Bard A.J. Faulkner L.R. Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1980Google Scholar). E 0′ values from cyclic voltammetry were calculated as the average of the anodic and the cathodic peak potentials, E 0′ = ½(E pa + E pc). The pyrolytic graphite “edge” electrode (surface area typically 0.18 cm2) was polished prior to each experiment with an aqueous alumina slurry (Buehler Micropolish; 1.0 μm) and then sonicated extensively to remove traces of Al2O3. All experiments were carried out under anaerobic conditions in a glove box (Vacuum Atmospheres Company) with an inert atmosphere of N2 (O2 < 1.0 ppm). Prior to electrochemical experiments, all protein samples were checked for purity by running fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) with a Mono Q column equilibrated with 0.05 m Tris, pH 7.4, and a linear gradient from 0.05 to 1 m NaCl. Bulk electrochemistry solutions contained 0.05–0.1 mm protein in 60 mm mixed buffer (15 mm Tris, 15 mm MES, 15 mm TAPS, 15 mm acetate), with 0.1 m NaCl as supporting electrolyte and 4 mm neomycin. Neomycin stabilizes the protein-electrode interactions. For the investigation of pH dependence, protein solutions were dialyzed extensively against the buffered solution at the required pH, using an Amicon 8MC diafiltration unit equipped with a microvolume assembly and a YM-3 membrane, or by the addition of 15 μl of stock protein solution in 50 mmTris, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 8.0, to 385 μl of the required buffer. The pH of the solution was checked after each experiment. Tetragonal crystals of the V19E and P47S FdI mutants were grown as previously described (32Chen K. Tilley G.J. Sridhar V. Prasad G.S. Stout C.D. Armstrong F.A. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36479-36487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Data for the V19E and P47S mutants were collected using an R-AXIS IV imaging plate, Osmic mirrors, and a Rigaku RU300 rotating anode x-ray source equipped with an Crystal Logic N2 cryogenic system; data for the L44S mutant were collected at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory beam line 7-1. The structures were solved by molecular replacement. The V19E FdI structure was refined to 1.65-Å resolution withR = 0.249 and R free = 0.265; the P47S FdI structure was refined to 1.90-Å resolution withR = 0.240 and R free = 0.266. Monoclinic crystals of L44S FdI were grown as for native FdI with the addition of 200 mm lithium sulfate to the reservoir solution. The space group is C2 with a = 130.8,b = 85.6, c = 67.2 Å, β = 117.9°, and four molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined to 2.20-Å resolution withR = 0.243 and R free = 0.286. Details of the data collection and refinement for each mutant FdI structure determination are included in the Protein Data Bank depositions. The coordinates for the structures of the V19E, L44S (four independent structures), and P47S mutants of FdI have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession codes 1G3O, 1GAO, and 1G6B, respectively. Eight-iron ferredoxins containing two [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters have long been known to fall into two general classes with respect to sequence motifs. The “clostridial-type” ferredoxins, represented by the structurally characterized PaFd and C. acidiurici ferredoxin, are M r ∼5,550 proteins where both clusters receive three of their four ligands from a CXXCXXC motif (1Beinert H.

The other class is represented by the structurally characterized,M r 9,058 Chromatium vinosumferredoxin (CvFd), which has one cluster ligated by a CXXCXXC motif and the other ligated by a CXXCX 8C motif (42Matsubara H.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1765-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Regardless of these differences in sequence motif, both classes of proteins have long been believed to contain two [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters of equivalent E 0′ (10Stephens P.J. Jollie D.R. Warshel A. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2491-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 42Matsubara H. Saeki K. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 38: 223-280Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This view was challenged in 1998 by our discovery that a ferredoxin from A. vinelandii (AvFdIII) was very similar toCvFd based on molecular weight and sequence motif and yet had very different E 0′ values of −486 and −644 mV for its two [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters (45Gao-Sheridan H.S. Pershad H.R. Armstrong F.A. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5514-5519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A reexamination of CvFd then led to the conclusion that it also had very different E 0′ of about −460 mV and about −655 mV for its two [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters (46Kyritsis P. Hatzfeld O.M. Link T.A.

Chem. 2001; 6: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These studies further identified the lowerE 0′ cluster of CvFd as the one with the CXXCXXC motif. The similarity of E 0′ values for the [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster of AvFdI (−620 mV at pH 7.0) and the lower E 0′ clusters ofAvFdIII and CvFd led us to extend the sequence and structure comparison to include these proteins. Fig.1 compares the sequences around the [Fe-S] clusters of PaFd, AvFdI,CvFd, and AvFdIII. Although clearly evolutionarily related (48Fukuyama K. Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Poulos T. Wieghardt K. Handbook of Metalloproteins. I. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK2001: 543-552Google Scholar), PaFd and AvFd vary greatly in size (M r 5,556 versus12,050) and cluster composition (8Fe versus 7Fe), and they share only 48% sequence similarity in their first 50 amino acids, where the clusters are located. As in previous studies (10Stephens P.J. Jollie D.R. Warshel A. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2491-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 22Backes G. Mino Y. Loehr T.M. Meyer T.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8564-8575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the homologous [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters (i.e. the second cluster from the NH2 terminus) are being compared, with PaFd having an E 0′ value ∼200 mV more positive than the corresponding cluster in AvFdI.AvFdI and CvFd also vary greatly in size (M r 12,050 versus 9,058) and cluster composition (7Fe versus 8Fe) and share only 42% sequence similarity in their first 50 amino acids, where the clusters are located. In this case, however, it is the first cluster from the NH2 terminus of CvFd that has a very lowE 0′ value, similar to the second cluster from the NH2 terminus of AvFdI. Despite these differences, Fig. 1 shows that the sequences surrounding the two lowE 0′ clusters in AvFdI andCvFd (or AvFdIII) are extremely similar to each other. In a previous study, we constructed D23N, F25I, H35D, E38S, and E46A variants of AvFdI (Fig. 1) and found no change inE 0′ (29Shen B. Jollie D.R. Stout C.D. Diller T.C. Armstrong F.A.

Based on the sequence comparisons shown in Fig. 1 and based on the protein structures, we have now constructed and characterized V19E, L44S, and P47S variants ofAvFdI in attempts to mimic their positions inPaFd for which E 0′ is higher. The residues corresponding to Val19 and Pro47 are completely conserved in the low E 0′ classes of ferredoxins. As discussed elsewhere, the residue corresponding to Leu44 varies, and in the low E 0′ ferredoxins, it is generally Leu or Val or occasionally Met (46Kyritsis P. Hatzfeld O.M. Link T.A. Moulis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15404-15411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The selection of these mutations was further encouraged by theoretical and experimental studies showing positive changes inE 0′ induced by substitution of nonpolar residues (e.g. Leu and Val) by polar residues, including serine (32Chen K.

Fig. 2 A is an overlay of the homologous [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters ofCvFd and AvFdI, showing their similarity in this region. Fig. 2 B is an overlay of the same region ofAvFdI and PaFd, showing the positions in the native proteins of the three residues under consideration relative to the cluster. The V19E, L44S, and P47S variants of AvFdI were constructed, expressed in their native background in A. vinelandii, and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These variants were all air-stable and accumulated to levels similar to that of native FdI in the cell. Fig. 3compares the UV-visible absorption spectra of each of the variants with those of native FdI, both in their air-oxidized states and following the anaerobic addition of dithionite. The oxidation states of the clusters in the presence of air are [4Fe-4S]2+ and [3Fe-4S]+. For native FdI, dithionite reduces only the [3Fe-4S]+ cluster to the “zero” oxidation level but does not reduce the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster because its reduction potential is too low (36Iismaa S.E.

This result is also obtained for V19E and P47S variants. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 3, dithionite causes considerably more reversible bleaching of L44S, suggesting that the E 0′ value for its [4Fe-4S]2+/+cluster has increased relative to native FdI. This reduction of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster in L44S was confirmed by EPR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 4, air-oxidized FdI exhibits a characteristic g = 2.01 EPR signal that arises from the [3Fe-4S]+ cluster having S = ½. Val19, Leu44, and Pro47 are all remote from that cluster, and, as expected, the mutation of these residues did not influence that signal. Consistent with the data shown in Fig. 3, the anaerobic addition of dithionite to V19E and P47S FdIs led to reduction of the [3Fe-4S]+ cluster to the “zero” oxidation level and disappearance of the g = 2.01 signal but did not result in reduction of the [4Fe-4S]2+cluster, the same result that is obtained for native FdI (36Iismaa S.E.

For L44S, the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster could be partially reduced by dithionite (Fig. 4), thereby confirming the conclusion from the UV-visible absorption experiment (Fig. 3). Spin quantitation of the signal of the [4Fe-4S]+ cluster using Cu-EDTA showed that 20% of the L44S [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster was reduced by dithionite, consistent with the E 0′ data discussed below. The wavelength dependence and form of the CD spectra of oxidized and reduced native FdI and V19E, L44S, and P47S variants are extremely similar (Fig. 5). In previous studies of variants that showed structural rearrangements in the vicinity of the [4Fe-4S]2+/+, the CD spectra were dramatically different (36Iismaa S.E. Vázquez A.E. Jensen G.M.

Thus, the CD data, combined with the UV-visible and EPR strongly suggest that the overall protein folding in solution and the environment around the clusters has not been significantly perturbed in any of the altered proteins.Figure 5CD spectra of native FdI (thin lines) and V19E, L44S, and P47S FdI variants (thick lines) in the oxidized and reduced states.

https://openalex.org/W2087494830,"A systematic analysis was carried out to examine the effects of ribonucleotide substitution at various locations within the promoter element for T7 RNA polymerase. Ribonucleotides could be introduced at most positions without significantly decreasing transcription efficiency. A critical window of residues that were intolerant of RNA substitution was defined for both the nontemplate and template strands of the promoter. These residues are involved in important contacts with the AT-rich recognition loop, specificity loop, and β-intercalating hairpin of the polymerase. These results highlight the malleability of T7 RNA polymerase in recognizing its promoter element and suggest that promoters with altered backbone conformations may be used in molecular biology applications that use T7 RNA polymerase for in vitrotranscription.

These results highlight the malleability of T7 RNA polymerase in recognizing its promoter element and suggest that promoters with altered backbone conformations may be used in molecular biology applications that use T7 RNA polymerase for in vitrotranscription. T7 RNA polymerase T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP)1 is widely utilized in molecular biology research for the transcription of RNA. The behavior of this enzyme is critically dependent on its interaction with the promoter element. The T7 bacteriophage genome contains a variety of promoters that are recognized by T7 RNAP, all of which are related to a 23-base pair consensus sequence (see Fig. 1) (1Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). The promoter can be divided into a recognition domain, encompassing positions −17 through −5, and an initiation domain, encompassing positions −4 through +6 (2Chapman K.A. Burgess R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5413-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 3Chapman K.A. Gunderson S.I. Anello M. Wells R.D. Burgess R.R.

Transcription initiates at the +1 position. Thus, the promoter is commonly viewed as spanning positions −17 through −1 even though the consensus sequence extends 6 base pairs beyond the site of initiation. In practice, this allows for the introduction of a wide variety of template sequences downstream of the −1 position to transcribe almost any desired RNA sequence. Numerous studies have illuminated details of the interactions between T7 RNAP and the recognition and initiation domains of the promoter. Through the use of Fe(II)-EDTA footprinting analysis it was shown that the protein recognizes the double-stranded DNA promoter on one face of the helix as indicated by protein protections that alternated between the template and nontemplate strands from positions −17 through +2 (6Muller D.K. Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3306-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). More recent studies involved the introduction of modified bases at defined locations within the promoter, providing information concerning interactions between T7 RNAP and specific functional groups of the DNA (4Li T. Ho H.H. Maslak M. Schick C. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3722-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5Újvári A. Martin C.T. J. Mol.

Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 666-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Those studies indicated major groove interactions in the recognition domain of the promoter at positions −11 through −5, confirming earlier modification interference experiments that implicated positions −12 through −5 as being important for binding interactions in the major groove of the DNA (9Jorgensen E.D. Durbin R.K. Risman S.S. McAllister W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 645-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recent crystal structure of T7 RNAP complexed with its promoter confirmed the results of prior biochemical studies and supports a model in which polymerase binding occurs on one face of the DNA helix (10Cheetham G. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). A detailed picture of polymerase-promoter interactions is provided by this structure. Specifically, the AT-rich recognition loop of the polymerase (residues 93–101) lies in close proximity to the minor groove of base pairs −17 through −13. The specificity loop of the protein (residues 739–770) is in close contact with the open region of the template strand of the promoter at positions −4 through −1 and also interacts with the major groove at positions −11 through −7. Residue Val-237, within the intercalating β-hairpin region of the polymerase, engages in stacking interactions with the base pair at position −5. Interactions between T7 RNAP and its promoter also have been studied by examining the effects of mutations within the promoter sequence, indicating potentially important interactions that involve specific base pairs (2Chapman K.A. Burgess R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5413-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 11Ikeda R.A. Ligman C.M. Warshamana S.

In general, mutations at positions −9 through −7 significantly reduce or abolish transcription, a finding that is supported by interactions that have been identified between position −8 of the promoter and Gln-758 within the specificity loop of the protein (15Rong M. He B. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). There is a preference for either A-T or T-A base pairs at positions −17 through −13 (13Diaz G.A. Raskin C.A. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Imburgio D. Rong M. Ma K. McAllister W.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10419-10430Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), confirming the need for flexibility in this region to allow interaction with the AT-rich recognition loop of the protein (10Cheetham G. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Positions −11 and −10 are tolerant of mutations, although these positions are somewhat constrained by interactions with Asn-748 in the specificity loop of the protein (15Rong M. He B. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Raskin C.A. Diaz G. Joho K. McAllister W.T. J. Mol.

A. 1993; 90: 3147-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Some tolerance for mutations also exists at positions −6 through −4 (14Imburgio D. Rong M. Ma K. McAllister W.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10419-10430Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), which is the region of transition between the paired and unpaired portions of the DNA when the polymerase is bound (4Li T. Ho H.H. Maslak M. Schick C. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3722-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5Újvári A. Martin C.T. J. Mol.

Almost any base pair can exist at positions −3 through −1 (14Imburgio D. Rong M. Ma K. McAllister W.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10419-10430Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), which are unpaired when interacting with the specificity loop of the protein (10Cheetham G. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The present study sought to investigate the consequences for T7 RNAP activity of introducing ribonucleotides within the consensus promoter sequence. This work complements previous mutational analyses by identifying positions within the promoter that are conformationally important for productive interaction with T7 RNAP. It also highlights alternative forms of the T7 RNAP promoter that may be useful in molecular biology applications. For example, RNA-containing promoters have been utilized previously in the continuous in vitroevolution of ligase ribozymes (18Wright M.C. Joyce G.F. Science. 1997; 276: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This system involves an RNA-catalyzed RNA ligation reaction with a promoter-containing oligonucleotide substrate that is composed partially of RNA. Additionally, a nontemplate promoter strand that contains RNA residues at its 3′-end may be attached to the 5′-end of any RNA with T4 RNA ligase. Following reverse transcription, this promoter-containing sequence could be transcribed directly by T7 RNAP, allowing amplification of an RNA without knowing the sequence at its 5′-end. All oligonucleotides were synthesized using a PerSeptive Biosystems Expedite automated DNA/RNA synthesizer and were deprotected according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Expedite DNA phosphoramidites and solid supports were purchased from PerSeptive Biosystems, and 2′-O-triisopropylsilyloxymethyl RNA phosphoramidites and solid supports were purchased from Glen Research. Oligonucleotides were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, eluted from the gel, and ethanol-precipitated. Concentrations of oligonucleotides were determined spectrophotometrically with extinction coefficients calculated as described previously (19Puglisi J.D. Tinoco Jr., I. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 304-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged T7 RNAP was purified from Escherichia coli strain BL21 containing plasmid pBH161 (kindly provided by William McAllister) using His-Bind resin (Novagen) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. A molar extinction coefficient of ε280 = 1.4 × 105m−1 cm−1 was used to determine the enzyme concentration (20King G.C. Martin C.T. Pham T.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and the specific activity was determined by comparison to commercially available T7 RNAP (Stratagene). The nontemplate strand contained 17 nucleotides, and the template strand contained 22 nucleotides that encoded the RNA sequence 5′-pppGGACU-3′. The template and nontemplate oligonucleotides (10 pmol of each) were annealed in a 4.5-μl volume that contained 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 1 mm Na2EDTA, which was heated at 65 °C for 5 min followed by the addition of 0.5 μl of a mixture containing 150 mm MgCl2, 20 mmspermidine, 500 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 50 mmdithiothreitol and then incubated at 37 °C for 5–10 min. The remaining components of the transcription mixture were added to give a final volume of 25 μl that contained 0.4 μm template oligonucleotide, 0.4 μm nontemplate oligonucleotide, 0.4 μm T7 RNAP (23.2 units/μl), 15 mmMgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm each of ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP, and 5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (21Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Transcription was allowed to proceed for 15 min at 37 °C, and then 5 μl of the reaction mixture was removed and added to 5 μl of a solution containing 9 m urea, 20% sucrose, 90 mm Tris-borate (pH 8.3), 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.1% SDS, and 25 mm Na2EDTA. Transcription products were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Transcription efficiencies were determined relative to reactions involving the wild-type promoter and a template encoding the same RNA transcript and are reported as the average of at least three replicate experiments. In vitro transcription was carried out using the consensus T7 RNAP promoter in which one or more contiguous deoxynucleotides upstream of the initiation site were replaced by ribonucleotides. These changes were made at either the 5′- or 3′-end of either the nontemplate or template strand from positions −17 through −1. The nontemplate strand is of the same sense as the RNA transcript and runs from position −17 (at the 5′-end) to position −1 (at the 3′-end), encompassing the recognition domain and a portion of the initiation domain (Fig.1). The template strand is of the opposite sense and runs from position −17 (at the 3′-end) to position +5 (at the 5′-end). In the standard assay, the two strands were allowed to anneal, and then T7 RNAP was added to initiate transcription. After 15 min, the reaction was quenched, and the products were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Similar assays using synthetic oligonucleotides have been utilized previously to study T7 RNAP-promoter interactions and the effect of various mutations and base modifications within the promoter element on transcription efficiency (4Li T. Ho H.H. Maslak M. Schick C. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3722-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5Újvári A. Martin C.T. J. Mol.

Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6918-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Comparable yields are obtained when using either a synthetic or plasmid DNA template that encodes the same RNA sequence (22Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherall G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar). In the present study, transcription efficiency was measured relative to that of an all-DNA promoter whose activity was defined as being 100%. The average transcription yield with the wild-type promoter was 30–40 copies of RNA per copy of DNA template, which is typical for a 15-min transcription reaction. For the RNA-containing promoters, deoxythymidine was replaced with uridine rather than 5-methyl uridine. With the exception of position −6 of the template strand, the absence of the 5-methyl group was not expected to have a significant effect on transcription efficiency (7Maslak M. Jaworski M. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4270-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). RNA substitution first was carried out on the nontemplate strand, starting from the 3′-end. Full promoter activity was retained when the DNA residues at positions −12 through −1 all were replaced by RNA, followed by a sharp decrease in transcription efficiency when position −13 was replaced as well (Fig.2a). This region of RNA substitution includes the sites of contact with the intercalating β-hairpin and specificity loop of the polymerase (10Cheetham G. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Starting from the 5′-end of the nontemplate strand, promoter activity began to decline when the DNA residues at positions −17 through −15 were replaced by RNA. This region includes the sites of minor groove contacts with the AT-rich recognition loop of the protein (10Cheetham G. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Transcription efficiency decreased progressively as more RNA residues were introduced, resulting in almost no detectable transcription product when residues −17 through −12 were replaced by RNA. In a similar fashion, RNA residues were introduced into the template strand starting from the 5′-end. It was found that the DNA residues at positions −4 through −1 could be replaced by RNA without affecting transcription efficiency (Fig. 2b). This region of the template strand is in close contact with the specificity loop of the protein (10Cheetham G. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The level of transcription was reduced to ∼40% compared with that of the all-DNA promoter when position −5 also was replaced by RNA. This residue is in contact with Val-237 in the β-hairpin region of the protein (10Cheetham G. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Introduction of additional RNA residues from the 5′-end, spanning positions −7 through −1, resulted in a level of transcription that was only about 10% compared with that of the all-DNA promoter. Starting from the 3′-end of the template strand, full transcription activity was retained when the DNA residues at positions −17 through −15 were replaced by RNA. This region is at the site of interaction with the AT-rich recognition loop of the protein (10Cheetham G. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). When additional residues in this region were converted to RNA, encompassing positions −17 through −13, transcription efficiency decreased to ∼50% compared with that of the all-DNA promoter. As the segment of RNA substitution was extended to include the region that contacts the specificity loop of the polymerase, there was a progressive decrease in transcription efficiency. RNA substitution extending to position −11 reduced transcription efficiency to about 40% compared with that of the all-DNA promoter and to about 10% when positions −10 and −9 also were replaced by RNA. In view of the results described above, it appeared that there is a critical window of residues within both the nontemplate and template strands of the promoter that must contain DNA to retain full T7 RNAP activity. To investigate this possibility, a nontemplate strand was constructed that contained RNA residues at positions −17 through −15 and positions −10 through −1. The polymerase retained ∼75% of full transcription activity with this promoter (Fig. 3). Conversely, when only residues −14 through −11 were replaced by RNA, transcription efficiency decreased to ∼10%. This defines a critical window of four residues within the nontemplate strand that are intolerant of RNA substitution. Positions −14 and −13 within this window contact the AT-rich recognition loop of T7 RNAP, and position −11 contacts the specificity loop of the protein (10Cheetham G. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Efforts were made to further pinpoint critical sugar positions within the nontemplate strand. Using a promoter with RNA residues at positions −17 through −15 and positions −11 through −1, transcription efficiency was 40% compared with that of the all-DNA promoter. Narrowing the window even further, with RNA substitutions at all positions except −13 and −12, reduced transcription efficiency to 35%. When the nontemplate strand contained only a single DNA residue at either position −13 or position −12 transcription activity was reduced to 10% (Fig. 3). A nontemplate strand containing all RNA residues showed no detectable activity under the assay conditions (data not shown). A critical window of DNA residues also was defined for the template strand, although this window was not as sharp as for the nontemplate strand. When positions −17 through −13 and positions −4 through −1 were replaced by RNA, transcription efficiency was reduced to ∼40% compared with that of the all-DNA promoter (Fig. 3). Conversely, when RNA was introduced at positions −12 through −5, transcription efficiency was reduced to about 5%. Finally, promoters were constructed in which both the nontemplate and template strands were made to contain the maximum number of RNA residues. Combining a nontemplate strand with RNA residues at positions −17 through −15 and positions −10 through −1 and a template strand with RNA residues at positions −17 through −13 and positions −4 through −1 resulted in a low level of transcription activity (Fig. 3). When the same nontemplate strand was combined with a template strand that contained RNA residues only at positions −4 through −1, transcription efficiency was 35% compared with that of the all-DNA promoter (data not shown). The consequences of introducing RNA residues within the nontemplate strand of the promoter suggest that there are compensatory DNA-protein interactions at the two ends of the promoter that are sensitive to the conformation of the nucleic acid backbone. These compensatory interactions involve the AT-rich recognition loop and specificity loop of the polymerase. When DNA residues are present at positions that contact the AT-rich recognition loop, RNA residues can be introduced at all positions that interact with the specificity loop while retaining almost full transcription activity. Conversely, when DNA residues are present in the region that interacts with the specificity loop, RNA residues can be introduced at some but not all of the positions that contact the AT-rich recognition loop (Fig. 2a). Transcription efficiency is significantly reduced when RNA residues are present in both regions of protein contact within the nontemplate strand (Fig. 3), defining a critical window of residues that must be DNA (Fig. 4). When T7 RNAP is bound to its promoter, the base pairs at positions −17 through −13 deviate from the canonical B-form helical structure due to widening of the minor groove, resulting in a conformation that is intermediate between A-form and B-form (10Cheetham G. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). One might expect, therefore, that RNA substitution at these positions would facilitate interaction with the protein by widening the minor groove and favoring a more A-like conformation. However, transcription efficiency was significantly reduced when these positions were replaced by RNA (Fig.2a). This suggests either that it is necessary to maintain a helical structure that is intermediate between A-form and B-form to allow proper interaction with the AT-rich recognition loop of the protein or that other crucial DNA-protein contacts are disrupted by RNA substitution in this region. Further investigation of this issue might involve the introduction of various nucleotide analogues, such as 2′-deoxy, 2′-fluoro nucleotides, which adopt an A-form conformation but lack the 2′-hydroxyl group (26Saenger W. Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure. Springer-Verlag, New York1984: 61-65Google Scholar). There is a requirement for a greater number of DNA residues within the template strand compared with the nontemplate strand of the promoter. This is not surprising considering the greater number of protein contacts that occur with the template strand (10Cheetham G. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Positions −4 through −1 of the template strand may be replaced by RNA without significantly affecting transcription efficiency, but substitution at position −5 as well has a highly deleterious effect (Fig. 2b). The base pair at position −5 interacts with the intercalating β-hairpin of T7 RNAP through stacking interactions with Val-237 (10Cheetham G. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of the DNA-protein complex, the intercalating β-hairpin appears to lie close to the sugar moiety of the deoxyguanylate at position −5 of the template strand (Fig. 4). Thus, altering the sugar pucker or introducing a 2′-hydroxyl group at this position may disrupt this interaction. Positions −4 through −1 of the promoter are unpaired when it is complexed with T7 RNAP. The specificity loop of the polymerase interacts with these residues primarily through contacts to the sugar-phosphate backbone (10Cheetham G. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), as supported by studies that indicate a tolerance for almost any mutation at these positions (14Imburgio D. Rong M. Ma K. McAllister W.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10419-10430Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A C3′-endo sugar pucker is established at the transcription start site in the DNA-protein complex (27Cheetham G.M.T. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), which suggests that substitution of RNA residues at positions −4 through −1 of the template strand might facilitate transition to this A-form-like conformation and therefore facilitate transcription. However, this benefit is likely to be counterbalanced by the increased stability of the RNA-DNA heteroduplex compared with the DNA-DNA homoduplex (28Roberts R.W. Crothers D.M. Science. 1992; 258: 1463-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), making it more difficult for this region of the promoter to dissociate prior to formation of the active transcription complex (27Cheetham G.M.T. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Positions −12 through −5 of the template strand are intolerant of RNA substitution. These positions have been studied previously by introducing either mutations or base modifications (4Li T. Ho H.H. Maslak M. Schick C. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3722-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 7Maslak M. Jaworski M. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4270-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 8Schick C.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10419-10430Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), demonstrating an absolute requirement for the sequence YGAG (Y = C or T) at positions −10 through −7. Introducing ribonucleotides of the same sequence at these positions greatly reduces transcription efficiency, whereas full promoter activity is maintained when the corresponding positions of the nontemplate strand are replaced by RNA (Fig. 2). This is likely due to the close interaction of the template strand with the specificity loop of the protein (10Cheetham G. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The residues at positions −10, −9, and −8 of the template strand have direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonding contacts with Asn-748, Arg-756, and Gln-758, respectively, within the specificity loop. The ability to introduce so many ribonucleotides into the promoter without significantly affecting T7 RNAP transcription efficiency begs the question as to whether one could develop a mutant form of the polymerase that utilizes an all-RNA promoter. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability to screen for functional mutant polymerases inE. coli (29Ikeda R.A. Chang L.L. Warshamana G.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9115-9124Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 30Suzuki M. Baskin D. Hood L. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9670-9675Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this way, a mutant T7 RNAP was identified that directs transcription from several different promoter sequences that are not utilized by the wild-type enzyme (29Ikeda R.A. Chang L.L. Warshamana G.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9115-9124Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It would be difficult to use the same strategy to select for T7 RNAP variants that utilize an all-RNA promoter. However, other directed evolution strategies might be used such as phage display (31Forrer P. Jung S. Plückthun A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 514-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) or methods in which a mRNA is linked to its corresponding protein during in vitro translation (32Roberts R.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A simpler experiment would be the evolution of mutant promoter sequences that allow T7 RNAP to utilize an all-RNA promoter. T7 RNAP can operate on an RNA template (33Cazenave C. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6972-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 34Arnaud-Barbe N. Cheynet-Sauvion V. Oriol G. Mandrand B. Mallet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3550-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and catalyze the extension of an RNA primer (33Cazenave C. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6972-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus continuous in vitro evolution might be used to evolve mutant all-RNA promoters similar to what has been achieved for mutant DNA promoters (35Breaker R.R. Banerji A. Joyce G.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11980-11986Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The malleability of the T7 RNAP-promoter interaction opens the door for a variety of applications that utilize a promoter element of altered chemical composition.

Their superantigenic activity can be attributed to their ability to cross-link major histocompatibility complex class II molecules with T-cell receptors (TCRs) to form a tri-molecular complex. Each superantigen is known to interact with a specific Vβelement of TCR. Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB, a superantigen), a primary cause of food poisoning, is also responsible for a significant percentage of non-menstrual associated toxic shock syndrome in patients with a variety of staphylococcal infections. Structural studies have elucidated a binding cavity on the toxin molecule essential for TCR binding. To understand the crucial residues involved in binding, mutagenesis analysis was performed. Our analysis suggest that mutation of a conserved residue Thr112 to Ser (T112S) in the binding cavity induces a selective reduction in the affinity for binding one TCR Vβ family and can be attributed to the structural differences in the native and mutant toxins.

Bacterial Toxins: Handbook of Natural Toxins. 14. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1988: 131-163Google Scholar). Illness occurs following ingestion of staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs)1 produced by S. aureus growing in contaminated food. Manifestations, which appear 4–6 h after ingestion of contaminated food, include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and headache. Their production during systemic S. aureus infections has been often associated with fatal toxic shock syndrome (3Herman A. Kappler J.W. Marrack P. Pullen A.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 745-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 4Betley M.J. Borst D.W. Regassa L. Fleischer B. Biological Significance of Superantigens. Karger, Basel, Switzerland1992: 1-64Google Scholar). The relationship between the enterotoxic and superantigenic properties of SEs is not clearly understood, although there is some evidence suggesting that these biological responses may be mediated by distinct mechanisms involving different sites on the toxin (5Harris T.O. Grossman D.G. Kappler J.W. Marrack P. Rich R.R. Betley M.J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3175-3183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on antibody specificities, the SEs have been divided into eight distinct serological types, andS. aureus strains can express either none, one, or a combination of SEs. The serotypes defined to date are designated SEA, SEB, SEC1, SEC2, SEC3, SED, SEE, SEG, SEH, SEI, and SEJ (1Bergdoll M.S. Easmon C.S.F. Adlam C. Staphylococci and Staphylococcal Infections. 2. Academic Press, London, UK1983: 559-598Google Scholar, 2Spero L. Johnson-Winegar A. Schmidt J.J. Hardegree M.C. Tu A.T. Bacterial Toxins: Handbook of Natural Toxins. 14.

Iandolo J.J. Stewart G.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 16: 227-233Crossref Google Scholar). Within the family, a high level of amino acid sequence homology is found. In addition to their enterotoxic properties, SEs have superantigenic properties (9Marrack P. Kappler J. Science. 1990; 248: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). The immunomodulatory effects of SEs, such as immunosuppression, enhancement of endotoxic shock, and induction of cytokine release, can be attributed to the fact that SEs are potent T-cell mitogens. The ability of SEs to induce proliferation of T-cells is somewhat similar to conventional antigen presentation by MHC class II molecules to T-cell receptors (TCRs) and hence known as microbial superantigens. However, unlike conventional antigens, the T-cell mitogenicity of SEs does not require antigen processing and lacks the normal specificity of the TCR for specific epitopes in response to conventional antigens. They are selective in that they do not induce the proliferation of all T-cells but selectively stimulate T-cells expressing certain Vβ families of TCRs, and the T-cell response to SEs is not self-MHC class II-restricted (9Marrack P. Kappler J. Science. 1990; 248: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 10White J. Hermann A. Pullen A.M. Kubo R. Kappler J.W. Marrack P.

Science. 1989; 244: 811-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Thus superantigens cross-link MHC class II molecules and the TCR via sites that are close to but distinct from those involved in conventional antigen presentation. This bypasses the normal TCR specificity for conventional T-cell epitopes, resulting in the stimulation of a substantial proportion of the total T-cell population and overproduction of cytokines. A considerable amount of structural data is now available describing the molecular architecture for members of the SE family and has identified the MHC class II and TCR recognition sites on the toxin molecules (for recent reviews see Refs. 12Papageorgiou A.C. Acharya K.R. Structure. 1997; 5: 991-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 13Kotb M. Curr. Opin.

Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 369-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Among the SEs, SEB is the most potent toxin, and our study has focused on the role of critical amino acid residues at the TCR-binding cavity (see Refs.15Swaminathan S. Furey W. Pletcher J. Sax M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 16Papageorgiou A.C. Tranter H.S. Acharya K.R. J. Mol.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 807-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the residues that surround the T-cell receptor-binding cavity on the surface of SEBs are most important to TCR binding; Asn23, Tyr175, and Asn179 have been shown to play a key role in TCR binding (18Briggs C. Garcia C. Zhang L. Guan L. Gabriel J.L. Rogers T.J. Immunology. 1997; 90: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Based on the native structure of the toxin, we have constructed several point mutants and have studied the effect of each mutation on TCR specificity. One such mutation, Thr112 → Ser (T112S), a conserved residue in all SEs and located in the TCR binding cavity, induced altered T-cell specificity, and we describe the differences in molecular interactions through the elucidation of the crystal structure of the mutant at 2.0-Å resolution. We also address the molecular basis of the interaction of SEB with T-cells bearing different TCR Vβ chains. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals and enzymes were purchased from Sigma or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The wild type seb gene was amplified using PCR with S. aureus strain S6 template DNA and the oligonucleotide primers 5′-GGGAATTCATGTATAAGAGATTATTTATTTC-3′ and 5′-GGGAAGCTTGGCAACAAGGGGTTAATGCTA-3′. For SEBT112S, two DNA fragments that flanked the site of the mutation were first amplified using PCR with S. aureus strain S6 template DNA. The amplified DNA fragments were purified and used in a subsequent round of PCR to generate a DNA fragment that encoded the mutated sebgene. The amplified wild type and mutated seb genes were treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and ligated withSmaI-digested pBluescript. The cloned DNA was sequenced to confirm the authenticity of the genes. For preliminary studies the cloned DNA was excised with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned into similarly digested plasmid pKK223-3 (Amersham Biosciences). The recombinant plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Blue (Stratagene, The Netherlands), and the recombinant bacteria were selected on L-agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For production of purified protein for T-cell mitogenicity studies and for crystallization, each gene was subcloned into plasmid pMalc2 (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK) to generate a gene encoding a maltose-binding protein-SEB fusion protein. These recombinant plasmids were used to transform E. coli strain XL1 Blue, which was cultured as described above. For initial studies, E. coli XL-1 Blue cells containing the appropriate recombinant pKK223-3 plasmid were cultured in 10 liters of L-broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml tetracycline at 30 °C. When theA600 nm of the culture reached 0.4 units, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After a further incubation of 4 h, the cells were collected by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 10 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in 30 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mmEDTA, and 20% (w/v) sucrose. This was incubated for 30 min at 0 °C and subsequently centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C); the supernatant was removed, and (NH4)2SO4 was added to 80% (561 g/liter) saturation. Precipitated material was collected by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and dissolved in 20 ml of 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). After dialysis against 3× 1 liter of the same buffer, 2.5 ml of pH 3–10 ampholytes (Bio-Rad) were added, and the proteins were separated by preparative isoelectric focusing using a Rotophor system (Bio-Rad). Fractions containing SEB were isolated and dialyzed against 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). For larger scale production of SEB and T112S, the recombinant plasmids were transferred to E. coli X1776. These recombinant bacteria were each cultured in tryptone soya broth (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) supplemented with the following to the final concentrations indicated: 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mmmagnesium chloride, 0.5% (w/v) glucose, 0.01% (w/v) diaminopimelic acid, 0.005% (w/v) thymidine, and 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Cultures (400 ml) were incubated with shaking (180 rpm) at 37 °C. When theA600 nm of the culture reached 0.7 units, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Cultures were incubated for a further 3.5 h, and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The cells were resuspended in 30 ml of column buffer as follows: 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), containing 200 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.06 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Lysozyme (5 ml of 10 mg/ml solution) was added, and the suspension was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Aliquots were sonicated on ice 3 times with 20-s intervals. The crude cell extract was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was decanted and filtered using a 0.22-μm disposable filter. The supernatant was applied to a 40-ml amylose resin column (New England Biolabs), which had previously been equilibrated with column buffer. The column was washed with 400 ml of column buffer. Elution buffer (column buffer containing 10 mm maltose) (40 ml) was added to the drained resin, and the column was rolled for 1 h at room temperature. The eluate was collected as 1-ml fractions, which were analyzed at 280 nm and by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing an optimum concentration of protein were pooled and cleaved with 1.6 ml (1600 units) of factor Xa (Amersham Biosciences) in column buffer containing 1 mmCaCl2 and 0.05% (w/v) SDS. Cleavage was allowed to continue overnight at room temperature, and the cleaved product was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 20 mm NaCl overnight at 4 °C. The sample was filtered using a 0.22-μm filter, before loading onto a 16/10 Mono Q anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). Cleaved SEB did not bind to the column, and was collected as fractions, whereas the maltose-binding protein and factor Xa bound to the column. The fractions of SEB were pooled and concentrated by stirred cell ultrafiltration (Millipore UK Ltd., Watford, Hertfordshire, UK). The purified proteins were quantified using a Coomassie Blue dye binding assay (Bio-Rad) or using a BCA assay (Perbio Science UK Limited, Cheshire, UK) and also quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using anti-SEB monoclonal antibodies. The SEB preparations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10–15% gradient gels; Amersham Biosciences) followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The gels were scanned using a Bio-Rad Gel Document 1000. A flow cytometric assay was employed to detect binding of SEB and T112S mutant to Raji (a human lymphoblastoid cell line that expresses MHC class II) and RJ2.2.5 (an MHC class II-deficient mutant). Briefly, cells were suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution with HEPES (3 mm), 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide. 5 × 105 cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 10−7m SEB or T112S mutant, and surface-bound toxins were detected by immunofluorescence following labeling with polyclonal rabbit anti-SEB (diluted 1:100) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by FITC sheep anti-rabbit IgG (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed between steps. 10,000 cells were acquired on a Becton Dickinson FACScan, and data were analyzed using Becton Dickinson Lysis II software. Results were plotted as histograms of green fluorescence (Fl-1), and MHC class II binding was detected as a shift to the right of mean fluorescence intensity on Raji cells in the presence of bound toxins, compared with the MHC class II-negative mutant. Note that a small proportion of RJ2.2.5 cells bound the sheep anti-rabbit Ig nonspecifically in the presence or absence of toxins, which does not otherwise obscure the result. Direct immunofluorescence was used to determine the TCR Vβfamilies expressed by human T-cells activated by SEB or the mutant by flow cytometry. Mononuclear cells were separated from the peripheral blood of 10 volunteers by one-step density centrifugation. Cells were cultured for 3 days with SEB (5 × 10−7m), the mutant T112S (5 × 10−7m), or the polyclonal mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA), 10 μg/ml. T-cell blasts were prepared for flow cytometry in phenol red-free Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 5 mm HEPES buffer, 2% fetal bovine serum, and 1% sodium azide. Cells (5 × 105) were incubated for 30 min at 5 °C in the dark with direct FITC-conjugated mAb specific for families of human T-cell TCR Vβ (a kit comprising antibodies to Vβ 3.1, 5.1, 5.2/5.3, 5.3, 6.7, 8, 12, and 13 and Vα 2, 12.1, Serotec, Oxford, UK). Cells were also incubated with a direct FITC-conjugated mAb specific for CD3 (PharMingen, Oxford, UK) to determine the proportion of T-cells after stimulation. Direct FITC-conjugated isotype control, mAbs were also used to determine the level of background labeling of T-cells after stimulation, which was subtracted from the test data. After washing, data from 10,000 cells were acquired for each sample and analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK). The results are expressed as the percent of T-cells expressing a particular TCR Vβ chain. Crystals of T112S mutant were grown at 16 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Samples (2 μl) of the reservoir solution (0.8 ml) containing 30% (w/v) PEG 4,000, 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.6), and 0.1m ammonium acetate were mixed with an equal volume of the protein stock solution on siliconized coverslips. The crystals belong to orthorhombic space group P212121with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The crystallization condition and packing of molecules in the mutant structure are different from those previously reported for the native SEB toxin (16Papageorgiou A.C. Tranter H.S. Acharya K.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar,20Swaminathan S. Furey W. Pletcher J. Sax M. Nature. 1992; 359: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Diffraction data were collected at 100 K using crystallization reservoir solution as cryoprotectant. The first data set was collected to 2.0 Å at the synchrotron radiation source (Electra), Trieste, Italy, using an MAR 345 image plate. Seventy nine images were collected with an oscillation range of 1.5° per image. A second data set (55 images) was collected at Daresbury, UK, station PX 9.5 to 1.8 Å with an oscillation range of 1.5° using an MAR CCD detector. Data processing, scaling, and merging of the two data sets were carried out using the HKL suite (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

This resultant structure was subjected to rigid body refinement followed by the calculation of an average electron density map. The structure was refined by simulated annealing using the maximum likelihood target as implemented in the program CNS (23Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. GrosseKunstleve R.W.

The refinement was continued using cycles of simulated annealing and B factor refinement. Electron density maps (Fo − Fc and 2Fo − Fc) were calculated after each cycle of refinement and visualized using the program O (24Jones T.A. Zon J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Water molecules were added to the model manually based on the density seen in the electron density maps and also by using the water pick protocol with the program CNS. In the final rounds of refinement the non-crystallographic restraints were gradually released, and the two molecules were checked and refined individually. The final model has a crystallographic R factor (Rcryst) of 22.7% for all data from 40.0 to 2.0-Å resolution and anRfree of 24.6% for 5% of the data omitted (Table I). The TCR-binding site on SEB has been identified previously from the three-dimensional structure of the complex as a shallow cavity on the surface of the enterotoxin (17Li H. Llera A. Tsuchiya D.

Parker M.W. Protein Toxin Structure. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 231-251Crossref Google Scholar). Mutational analysis has confirmed the role in T-cell binding of many of the residues forming this cavity (17Li H. Llera A. Tsuchiya D. Leder L. Ysern X. Schlievert P.M. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R.A.

Immunology. 1998; 94: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thr112 is one of the TCR-binding site “rim” residues proposed by Swaminathan et al. (20Swaminathan S. Furey W. Pletcher J. Sax M. Nature. 1992; 359: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and this residue is conserved in SEA, SEB, SEC1, SEC2, SEC3, SED, and SEE (25Swaminathan S. Furey W. Sax M. Parker M.W. Protein Toxin Structure. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 231-251Crossref Google Scholar). However, the role of this residue has not yet been determined experimentally. Hence we have investigated the properties of a T112S mutant. For the production of recombinant wild type SEB or T112S mutant, the encoding genes were expressed as maltose-binding protein fusions in E. coli. The proteins were purified using affinity chromatography and cleaved with factor Xa to release SEB or T112S mutant. Based on scanning densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels, the purified proteins were judged to be at least 95% pure, and the yield obtained was ∼8 mg of wild type SEB per liter of culture and 10 mg of T112S mutant per liter of culture. The TCR and MHC class II-binding sites are adjacent on the surface of SEB (17Li H. Llera A. Tsuchiya D. Leder L. Ysern X. Schlievert P.M. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R.A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 807-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 27Jardetzky T.S. Brown J.H. Gorga J.C. Urban R.G. Chi Y.I. Stauffacher C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). However, residue Thr112 is located on the region of the TCR-binding cleft which is distal to the MHC class II-binding site. This suggested that unless gross conformational changes had occurred in the T112S mutant protein, binding to MHC class II would be unaffected by this mutation. The ability of SEB and T112S mutant to bind the Raji human lymphoblastoid cell line in a flow cytometric assay was used as a measure of relative affinity of binding to MHC class II, as used previously (28Metzroth B. Marx T. Linning M. Fleischer B. Infect. Immun. 1993; 6: 2445-2453Crossref Google Scholar). SEB and T112S mutant bound to Raji cells with equal fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1,b and c). The assay was considered to be specific as the MHC class II-negative mutant RJ2.2.5 failed to bind SEB or T112S mutant (Fig. 1, e and f), and the rabbit anti-SEB and FITC sheep anti-rabbit Ig failed to bind either cell type in the absence of SEB or T112S (Fig. 1, a and c). The results confirm that the T112S mutation has no effect on MHC class II binding and suggest that the structure of the MHC class II binding region was unaffected by this amino acid substitution. Other workers (26Garcia C. Briggs C. Zhang L. Guan L. Gabriel J.L. Rogers T.J. Immunology. 1998; 94: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have also shown that amino acid substitutions at other positions within the TCR-binding site of SEB do not influence the ability to bind MHC class II. Like these workers, we are therefore able to interpret changes in T-cell activation by the T112S mutant protein as indicative of changes in the TCR-binding site rather than changes in the ability to bind MHC class II. Staphylococcal enterotoxins are known to activate human T-cells bearing a range of TCR Vβ chains, but the precise spectrum of activity differs between the individual enterotoxins. To investigate whether the Thr112-Ser substitution had modulated the ability of the protein to activate T-cells, preliminary studies were undertaken in which human peripheral blood T-cells were stimulated with SEB or T112S, and Vβ-specific mRNA levels were measured using semi-quantitative PCR. These experiments revealed a reduced expression of TCR Vβ3 mRNA by T-cells activated by T112S compared with those activated by native SEB. 2J. D. Hayball, personal communication. To confirm this preliminary result, we undertook a flow cytometric analysis by measuring TCR Vβ family expression by T-cells following activation with SEB, T112S mutant, or PHA. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 10 human volunteers were cultured for 3 days in the presence of SEB, T112S mutant, or PHA, and the expansion of T-cells expressing different TCR Vβwas determined by flow cytometry. SEB is known to activate selectively human Vβ 3, Vβ 12, Vβ 14, Vβ 15, Vβ 17, and Vβ 20 T-cells, whereas PHA activates all Vβ families in the proportions present in peripheral blood (29Lavoie P.M. Thibodeau J. Sékely R.-P. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 168: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The results indicated that both SEB and T112S mutant selectively induced T-cells bearing Vβ 3.1 and 12 compared with PHA as detected by the range of antibodies used (Fig. 2). As expected, SEB did not induce T-cells bearing Vβ 5, 6.7, 8, or 13. The T112S mutant also failed to activate these T-cells (Fig. 2). SEB and the T112S mutant appeared to activate T-cells bearing Vβ 12 to an equal degree (Fig. 2). However, in all of the individuals tested, the proportion of Vβ 3.1 T-cells induced by T112S mutant was reduced compared with SEB. Indeed, the proportion of Vβ 3.1 T-cells activated by T112S mutant was in the range 24–86% below that for SEB, suggesting a substantial reduction in the affinity of T112S mutant for the Vβ 3.1 family of TCR compared with native SEB. As expected, PHA, SEB, and T112S mutant induced the same proportion of Vα 2 and Vα 12.1 T-cells, as Vα TCR families are not known to be selectively expanded by superantigens. These findings indicated that the affinity of the enterotoxin toward the Vβ 3.1 TCR had been reduced by the introduction of the Thr112 to Ser substitution, without altering the response of Vβ 12 T-cells. The structure of T112S mutant was determined at 2.0-Å resolution (Fig. 3). The final model contained 3802 non-hydrogen protein atoms and 173 water molecules (Table I).

In these cases, mutations have been identified in the DDB2 gene (DDB2(-)) that codes for the small subunit, p48, of the DDB heterodimer. In four DDB2(- )strains, neither p48 nor DDB activity were observed before or after UV-irradiation, despite an unusually strong up-regulation of DDB2 mRNA levels after UV-irradiation. In a fifth strain, XP82TO, p48 was detectable and both DDB2 mRNA and p48 levels were more up-regulated after UV-irradiation than in normal primary cells. Moreover, DDB activity also became apparent after irradiation. XP82TO showed very mild clinical manifestations compared with the other DDB(-) patients. These results, coupled with our findings that most, if not all DDB(+) cells classified as XP-E were misclassified, suggests a direct correlation between DDB2 levels and the XP-E phenotype."

RNA polymerase cAMP receptor protein The transition from aerobic to anaerobic respiration in the facultative anaerobe Escherichia coli is, in part, governed by the global transcription factor FNR (the regulator offumarate and nitrate reduction) (1Green J. Scott C. Guest J.R. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2001; 44: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar,2Kiley P.J. Beinert H. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 22: 341-352Crossref Google Scholar). FNR is a one-component sensor/regulator protein that senses changes in cytoplasmic oxygen concentration directly via an oxygen-labile [4Fe-4S] cluster. Each FNR monomer can acquire a single [4Fe-4S] cluster, which is coordinated by three N-terminal cysteine residues (Cys20, Cys23, and Cys29, but not Cys16) and a fourth cysteine residue (Cys122) (3Sharrocks A.D.

Chem. 1990; 265: 18733-18736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon incorporation of [4Fe-4S] clusters, the FNR monomers dimerize; the resultant dimeric FNR can bind DNA and contact RNA polymerase (RNAP)1 holoenzyme to produce a productive complex at FNR-dependent promoters (5Lazazzera B.A. Beinert H.

Activation of FNR-dependent promoters by [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing, dimeric FNR requires appropriate contacts between FNR and RNAP. Two surface-exposed activating regions (AR1 and AR3) that are involved in FNR-RNAP communication have been characterized (7Lonetto M.A. Rhodius V. Lamberg K. Kiley P.J. Busby S. Gross C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1353-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Green J. Baldwin M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,10Williams S.M. Savery N.J. Busby S.J.W. Wing H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4028-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). At class I promoters (where the FNR site is centered at −61.5 bp or further from the transcription initiation site), AR1 of the downstream subunit of the FNR dimer contacts the C-terminal domain of the α-subunit of RNAP (10Williams S.M. Savery N.J. Busby S.J.W. Wing H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4028-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11Li B. Wing H. Lee D. Wu H. Busby S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2075-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). At class II promoters (where the FNR site is centered at or about −41.5 bp from the transcription initiation site), AR3 makes the dominant contact with RNAP via the ς70-subunit, and now AR1 of the upstream FNR subunit contacts the C-terminal domain of the α-subunit (7Lonetto M.A. Rhodius V. Lamberg K. Kiley P.J. Busby S. Gross C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1353-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The cAMP receptor protein (CRP) of E. coli, a structural homologue of FNR, also uses AR1 to activate transcription at class I promoters but has a different strategy at class II promoters, where it uses a different activating region (AR2) to contact the N-terminal domain of the α-subunit of RNAP instead of the ς70-AR3 contact formed by FNR (12Busby S. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Although apparently not normally active in FNR, AR2 activity can be generated by screening for second site mutations that compensate for an impaired AR1 (11Li B. Wing H. Lee D. Wu H. Busby S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2075-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Aerobic inactivation of FNR occurs when the iron-sulfur cluster reacts with molecular oxygen. The [4Fe-4S] cluster is disassembled in response to oxygen, ultimately yielding inactive, monomeric apo-FNR (13Six S. Trageser M. Kojro E. Fahrenholz F. Unden G. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1996; 62: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 14Jordan P.A Thomson A.J. Ralph E.T. Guest J.R. Green J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Substitution of any of the four cysteine ligands of the iron-sulfur cluster has profound effects upon the in vivo activity of FNR. Altering Cys122 abolishes the ability of FNR to activate transcription from model FNR-dependent promotersin vivo (3Sharrocks A.D. Green J. Guest J.R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Melville S.B. Gunsalus R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18733-18736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, replacing Cys20, Cys23, or Cys29 generates FNR proteins with impaired but detectable in vivo activity (3Sharrocks A.D. Green J. Guest J.R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Melville S.B. Gunsalus R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18733-18736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have focused on determining the cause of the residual activity of the FNR proteins with N-terminal cysteine substitutions, particularly the FNR-C20S variant. Anaerobically purified FNR-C20S, in contrast to wild-type FNR, did not contain [4Fe-4S] clusters, suggesting that FNR-C20S cannot incorporate a [4Fe-4S] cluster (2Kiley P.J. Beinert H. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 22: 341-352Crossref Google Scholar). However, FNR-C20S protein purified under aerobic conditions has been shown to have a similar iron content to wild-type FNR prepared in the same way, suggesting that both proteins contain degraded iron-sulfur clusters (15Green J. Sharrocks A.D. Green B. Geisow M. Guest J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Additionally, in vitro analysis has revealed that aerobically purified FNR-C20S can bind DNA in footprinting reactions (15Green J. Sharrocks A.D. Green B. Geisow M. Guest J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), albeit with lower affinity than aerobically purified, unaltered FNR. Isolated FNR-C20S can also acquire a [4Fe-4S] cluster in vitro with properties similar to that wild-type FNR, and the formation of the cluster drives FNR-C20S dimerization as judged by enhanced site-specific DNA binding (16Ralph E.T. Scott C. Jordan P.A. Thomson A.J. Guest J.R. Green J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, second site substitutions in the activating regions of FNR-C20S (AR1, AR2, or AR3) can correct for the C20S substitution, allowing in vivo activation of expression from FNR-dependent promoters. These observations suggest that FNR-C20S can assemble oxygen-labile [4Fe-4S] clusters in vivo and that the presence of the miscoordinated iron-sulfur clusters promotes dimerization and DNA binding but not the conformational changes required for effective contact with RNAP and transcription regulation (16Ralph E.T. Scott C. Jordan P.A. Thomson A.J. Guest J.R. Green J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here evidence is presented to show that FNR-C20S can acquire an oxygen-sensitive cluster in vivo and that this is sufficient to mediate anaerobic repression of a simple FNR-regulated promoter. The FNR-C20S variant also formed heterodimers with FNR-E209V, further indicating that the miscoordinated iron-sulfur cluster of FNR-C20S can promote dimerization. These heterodimers activated transcription from an FNR-dependent class II promoter, but only when FNR-C20S was the upstream subunit of the FNR dimer, indicating that the impaired activity of FNR-C20S in vivo is probably due to a failure to make productive interactions with RNAP. This was supported by the finding that amino acid substitutions in AR3 or those that unmask AR2 suppress the effects of the orientation of the FNR-C20S·FNR-E209V heterodimers at class II promoters. Finally, studies with FNRΔ29, which lacks all the N-terminal cysteine residues and thus cannot form iron-sulfur clusters, indicated that two iron-sulfur clusters, one per subunit are required for FNR dimerization. Therefore, it is concluded that the model describing the aerobic-anaerobic FNR switch can be refined such that iron-sulfur cluster assembly by two FNR monomers permits dimerization and enhanced DNA binding but that only correctly liganded iron-sulfur clusters can cause the necessary conformational changes to establish effective contacts with RNAP and subsequent transcription activation. The E. colistrains used were based upon JRG1728 (ΔfnrΔlac) (17Spiro S. Guest J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).

The media were supplemented with tetracycline (35 μg ml−1), kanamycin (25 μg ml−1), and ampicillin (100 μg ml−1) as appropriate. β-Galactosidase assays were in accordance with the method of Miller (21Miller J.H.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar), and the strains used were grown from an inoculum of 1:200 until anA600 of 0.3–0.6 was reached before β-galactosidase activity was estimated. Total RNA was prepared using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was extracted from cultures ofE. coli strain JRG1728 (Δfnr Δlac) containing pGS196 (encoding wild-type FNR) and the FFmelR lac reporter plasmid grown either aerobically or anaerobically to an A600 of 0.3–0.4. The concentration of total RNA isolated was determined using a UNICAM UV4 UV-visible spectrophotometer. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using a Qiagen Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase kit in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions using 100 nmol of total RNA/μl of reaction volume. The cDNA was then used as the template for PCR using appropriate primers for lacZ and tatE. A PCR master mix was prepared for each condition and then aliquoted into 20 μl of reaction volumes. The products were labeled by including [α32P]dGTP in the reaction mix. One reaction aliquot was removed from the thermocycler (Hybaid Omn-E) after five cycles (melting, 95 °C, 30 s; annealing, 62 °C, 45 s; extension, 72 °C, 60 s) and after every subsequent cycle (total cycles, 15). The samples were resolved on Tris-borate EDTA buffered 20% polyacrylamide gels and detected by autoradiography. The relative quantities of each product were determined by scanning (Sharp JX-330) the autoradiograph and subsequent quantitative analysis using ImageMaster software (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). FNR-C20S has been shown to incorporate an iron-sulfur cluster in vitrothat enhances binding of FNR-C20S dimers to DNA containing an FNR site. However, in vivo, FNR-C20S has a much reduced ability to activate expression from FNR-dependent promoters (FFmelR, dms, and frdA), nor can FNR-C20S repress transcription from the FNR-repressed cyoAand ndh promoters as effectively as the wild-type protein (3Sharrocks A.D. Green J. Guest J.R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Melville S.B. Gunsalus R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18733-18736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This could suggest that the [4Fe-4S]-containing form of FNR-C20S is not generated in vivo, resulting in diminished activity. However, activation by FNR requires interaction between FNR and RNAP, and so defects in in vivoFNR-C20S-dependent transcription activation may not be indicative of the absence of DNA binding by FNR-C20S. Moreover, FNR-dependent repression at many natural promoters has proved to be a complex process (1Green J. Scott C. Guest J.R. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2001; 44: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), so again the action of FNR proteins at these promoters may not be wholly representative of their ability to bind DNA per se. Fortunately, a simple, synthetic, FNR-repressed lacZ reporter is available (theFFgalΔ4 promoter) in which transcriptional activity is blocked by the binding of active FNR close to the −10 element (18Williams S.M. Wing H.J. Busby S.J.W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 163: 203-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of the FFgalΔ4 promoter in a strain containing FNR was repressed in an oxygen-dependent manner (Table I), confirming that this promoter is repressed in the presence of anaerobic, active FNR. As would be expected, the FNR variant, FNRΔ29, that is incapable of incorporating an iron-sulfur cluster because it lacks all four N-terminal cysteines, could not repress transcription from the FFgalΔ4 promoter. However, when FNR-C20S was present a 5.7-fold anaerobic repression ofFFgalΔ4, compared with 13-fold with wild-type FNR, was observed. Therefore, it seems likely that FNR-C20S can bind the FNR site of the FFgalΔ4 promoter in vivo in an oxygen-responsive manner and repress transcriptional activity by promoter occlusion. Because FNRΔ29 cannot repress transcription from this simple promoter, it may be concluded that incorporation of iron-sulfur clusters is required for this activity and thus that FNR-C20S can acquire iron-sulfur clusters in vivo.Table ITranscriptional repression of FFgalΔ4 by FNR and FNR-C20SRegulatorExpression from FFgalΔ4promoter (β-galactosidase)AerobicAnaerobicMiller unitsFNR444 (95)34 (2)FNR-C20S488 (20)85 (5)FNRΔ29470 (6)575 (37)Each strain tested contained a pRW50 derivative in which the expression of the lac operon was driven from the FFgalΔ4promoter.

The standard deviations are shown in parentheses. Active, dimeric FNR binds DNA in a site-specific manner, targeting a 14-bp imperfect palindrome (TTGATNNNNATCAA). In the simplest case of FNR-dependent transcription activation, FNR binds at this site centered −41.5 base pairs upstream of the transcript start. However, although many natural FNR-dependent promoters have such an architecture, their activities are also influenced by other transcription factors responding to different environmental stimuli (such as the availability of alternative electron acceptors). The semi-syntheticFFmelR promoter (with an FNR consensus siteTTGATCTAGAATCAA centered at −41.5) was created to provide a simple model FNR-regulated promoter and has subsequently been modified to facilitate the study of FNR-dependent transcription activation (19Bell A. Busby S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the DNA-binding helix of FNR at position 209 (E209V) changes the binding specificity of the regulator from TTGAT (F) to TTAAT (Y) (19Bell A. Busby S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This altered FNR-binding site has been engineered into the simple class II FNR-dependent FFmelR promoter (described above), creating the FNR-E209V-activated YYmelR promoter by replacing the consensus FNR (FF) site with the YYsite (TTAATCTAGAATTAA). The wild-type half-site (F) can also be fused with the variant FNR half-site (Y), creating a promoter with either FYor YF regulatory sites. These sites confer specificity for FNR·FNR-E209V hybrid dimers, and the orientation of the dimer relative to the transcriptional machinery is determined by the orientation of the DNA-binding half-sites in the hybrid promoter (Fig.1). Thus, this series of lacZreporters possess variations on the FNR consensus within the context of the same promoter sequence. This system can be adapted to probe the effect of introducing one FNR-C20S iron-sulfur cluster and one wild-type iron-sulfur cluster into an FNR dimer. By co-expressing FNR-E209V, which recognizes the Y half-site and has a normal iron-sulfur cluster, with FNR-C20S, which recognizes the Fhalf-site, the impact of the miscoordinated FNR-C20S cluster can be assessed at these simple model FNR-activated promoters. The plasmids expressing the FNR proteins are selected such that less FNR-E209V is present in the bacteria than FNR-C20S. Thus, most FNR-E209V should be in the form of FNR-E209V·FNR-C20S heterodimers. Therefore, a strain of E. coli lacking chromosomally encoded FNR (JRG1728) was transformed a pLG339 derivative encoding FNR-E209V and with theFFmelR, FYmelR, YFmelR, orYYmelR reporter plasmids. The four reporter strains were transformed with a pBR322 derivative encoding either FNR, FNR-C20S, or FNRΔ29. Using this system the presence of FNR-C20S·FNR-E209V or FNR-C20S·FNRΔ29 heterodimers would be exposed either by activation from one or both hybrid promoters (FY and YF) or by a reduction in FNR-E209V-mediated activation of theYYmelR promoter (TableII).Table IITranscription activation by oriented FNR heterodimersRegulator combinationExpression from test promoter (β-galactosidase)FFmelRYYmelRFYmelRYFmelRMiller unitsFNR + FNR-E209V2171 (21)147 (19)888 (129)935 (174)FNRΔ29 + FNR-E209V222 (46)995 (154)289 (96)442 (38)FNR-C20S + FNR-E209V211 (67)420 (6)965 (94)422 (24)Each strain tested expressed FNR-E209V and a pRW50 derivative in which the expression of the lac operon was driven from theFFmelR, YYmelR, FYmelR, orYFmelR promoters.

The standard deviations are shown in parentheses. Analysis of the strains containing the FFmelR reporter plasmid showed that a significant level of activation was only observed in the presence of wild-type FNR, suggesting that neither FNR-C20S or FNRΔ29 homodimers nor FNR-E209V·FNR-C20S or FNR-E209V·FNRΔ29 heterodimers can activate expression from this promoter, whereas wild-type FNR homodimers can. This type of analysis, in which β-galactosidase activity is used to report promoter activity, is a frequently used, simple, and convenient approach. However, a number of other factors not directly related to transcription (such as mRNA turnover, protein assembly, and protein turnover) could influence the measured output. Therefore, it was deemed prudent to obtain an independent measure of transcription to ensure that the effects observed in the lacZ reporter experiments are due to changes in transcription. Such a correlation between β-galactosidase activity and lacZ transcript was sought by analyzing the amount of transcript produced from the FNR-dependent FFmelR-reporter plasmid in JRG1728 (Δfnr Δlac) expressing fnr from pGS196 under aerobic and anaerobic conditions using quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (see “Experimental Procedures”). The amount of FNR-dependent lacZ mRNA produced was compared with the amount of mRNA produced from the chromosomaltatE gene, which has been shown to be transcribed at the same rate in the presence or absence of oxygen (22Jack R.L. Sargent F. Berks B.C. Sawers G. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The finding that the ratio of tatE transcript in aerobic compared with anaerobic cultures was in the range 1.2–1.3 confirmed the previous reports (22Jack R.L. Sargent F. Berks B.C. Sawers G. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and indicated that this transcript is an appropriate internal control for measuring changes in the lacZtranscript. During aerobic growth the ratio of lacZ totatE mRNA was 0.3–0.4, whereas anaerobic growth the ratio was 2.2–2.5. This represents up to 8.3-fold induction in FNR-dependent anaerobic induction of this transcript. Measurement of β-galactosidase activity under the same conditions revealed a 12-fold increase when anaerobic cultures were compared with aerobic cultures. Thus, these data suggest that β-galactosidase activity is representative of transcriptional activity from the pRW50-based FNR-dependent lacZ fusion reporters used here. The YYmelR reporter was most active when FNR-E209V was combined with FNRΔ29 and displayed reduced activity when either wild-type FNR or FNR-C20S was present. Because FNR-E209V-driven expression from YYmelR was high in the presence of FNRΔ29, it is suggested that iron-sulfur cluster incorporation into both FNR subunits is essential for dimerization. The reduced level of FNR-E209V-driven expression from YYmelR in the presence of FNR and FNR-C20S indicates that both wild-type FNR and FNR-C20S can dimerize with FNR-E209V but that these heterodimers fail to recognize the YYmelR promoter and therefore fail to activate transcription. Furthermore, the formation of heterodimers reduces the pool of available FNR-E209V homodimer, thereby reducing expression from the YYmelR promoter relative to that observed when FNRΔ29 is co-expressed with FNR-E209V. The extent of the reduction in activity from the YYmelR promoter was not as great for FNR-C20S-expressing strains compared with that observed for those containing wild-type FNR (a 6.7-fold difference between wild-type FNR and FNRΔ29 compared with a 2.3-fold difference between FNR-C20S and FNRΔ29). This suggests that although FNR-C20S is able to form dimers, its ability to do so is impaired relative to the wild-type FNR or that FNR-C20S dimers are efficiently formed but do not bind DNA as well as the unaltered FNR protein. At promoters that require the action of heterodimers (FY andYF) the presence of FNRΔ29 fails to lead to activation from the hybrid-binding sites, again indicating that the presence of a cluster in each FNR monomer may be required for dimerization. The presence of the wild-type FNR allowed transcription to occur, demonstrating that the wild-type FNR and FNR-E209V can form an active dimer. The ability of FNR-E209V·FNR-C20S heterodimers to mediate transcription activation at the FYmelR and YFmelRhybrid promoters was found to be dependent upon the orientation of the two subunits of the hybrid dimer. Activation of transcription from theFYmelR promoter was found to be similar for heterodimers of FNR-E209V with both FNR or FNR-C20S, but at the YFmelRpromoter the observed level of transcription for FNR-E209V heterodimers with FNR-C20S was closer to that found for FNR-E209V·FNRΔ29 heterodimers. These observations are in accord with the hypothesis that the iron-sulfur clusters acquired by FNR-C20S promote dimerization and DNA binding but fail to align the activating regions of FNR with their cognate sites in RNAP (Fig. 2). Thus, at the FYmelR promoter the correctly configured AR3 of the FNR-E209V subunit is juxtaposed to the ς70 subunit of RNAP allowing the strong activating contact to be made. It has been shown previously that class I activation by the FNR-C20S homodimer is less affected by the C20S induced iron-cluster defect than class II activation, and thus AR1 is probably less affected than AR3 (16Ralph E.T. Scott C. Jordan P.A. Thomson A.J. Guest J.R. Green J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is the slightly impaired AR1 of the FNR-C20S monomer that is adjacent to the C-terminal domain of the RNAP α subunit at theFYmelR promoter, allowing a partial contact to be made. Thus, the FYmelR promoter can be activated by the FNR-E209V·FNR-C20S heterodimer. Conversely, at the YFmelRpromoter, the FNR-C20S subunit would be required to make the essential AR3 contact with RNAP but cannot, presumably because its AR3 is incorrectly configured as a consequence of the miscoordinated iron-sulfur cluster. Thus, activation from the YFmelRpromoter cannot be mediated by the FNR-C20S·FNR-E209V heterodimer. It has been shown that the inability of the FNR-C20S homodimer to activate transcription can be compensated for by the introduction of second site mutations that augment AR1 and AR3 or by unmasking the normally silent AR2 (16Ralph E.T. Scott C. Jordan P.A. Thomson A.J. Guest J.R. Green J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the possibility that these second site substitutions affect a signal transduction step other than communication with RNAP (such as improving DNA binding affinity) has not been excluded. Thus, the orientation dependence of FNR-E209V·FNR-C20S heterodimers, shown in Fig. 2, should be abolished when FNR-C20S derivatives carrying compensatory mutations in AR2 or AR3 (e.g. FNR-C20S/E47K and FNR-C20S/K60R, respectively) are used in the place of FNR-C20S. The data (Table III) show that both FNR-C20S/E47K and FNR-C20S/K60R are more active than FNR-C20S in the strain containing the FFmelR reporter, which confirms that the second-site mutations do restore some activity to FNR-C20S. Because both FNR-C20S/E47K and FNR-C20S/K60R could interfere with transcriptional activation by the FNR-E209V homodimer at theYYmelR promoter, it seems likely that FNR-C20S/E47K and FNR-C20S/K60R can dimerize efficiently with FNR-E209V. At theFYmelR and YFmelR promoters FNR-C20S/E47K·FNR-E209V and FNR-C20S/K60R·FNR-E209V heterodimers behave like the FNR·FNR-E209V heterodimer, activating transcription from both promoters. This demonstrates that by adjusting RNAP contacts through the modified AR2 or AR3, communication with RNAP was re-established, and productive complexes could then be formed allowing transcription from the YFmelR promoter.Table IIITranscription activation by oriented FNR heterodimers carrying amino acid substitutions in AR2 or AR3Regulator combinationExpression from test promoter (β-galactosidase)FFmelRYYmelRFYmelRYFmelRMiller unitsFNR + FNR-E209V2304 (400)283 (77)1138 (203)914 (18)FNR-C20S/E47K + FNR-E209V2434 (115)139 (12)1237 (26)1144 (35)FNR-C20S/K60R + FNR-E209V1821 (133)462 (54)1304 (232)1000 (179)Each strain tested expressed FNR-E209V and harbored a pRW50 derivative in which the expression of the lac operon was driven from the FFmelR, YYmelR, FYmelR, orYFmelR semi-synthetic promoters.

The purpose of this work was to investigate the effects of a miscoordinated iron-sulfur cluster on the ability of FNR to regulate transcription. It had been previously shown that although FNR-C20S had only trace activityin vivo, it was able to acquire an oxygen-labile iron-sulfur cluster that enhanced DNA binding in vitro (3Sharrocks A.D. Green J. Guest J.R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Melville S.B. Gunsalus R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18733-18736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ralph E.T. Scott C. Jordan P.A. Thomson A.J. Guest J.R. Green J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that amino acid substitutions in the activating regions of FNR-C20S could partially rescue activity in vivo suggested that the inactivity of FNR-C20S in vivo is due to a lesion in signal transduction downstream of cluster acquisition and DNA binding (16Ralph E.T. Scott C. Jordan P.A. Thomson A.J. Guest J.R. Green J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The evidence presented here supports this contention by demonstrating that FNR-C20S can regulate the activity of a simple FNR-repressed promoter in an oxygen-dependent mannerin vivo. The simplest explanation for this observation is that FNR-C20S can dimerize and bind DNA in response to oxygen-starvation through the assembly and disassembly of a [4Fe-4S] cluster. Conversely, FNRΔ29 cannot regulate the same simple FNR-repressed promoter, presumably because it cannot form an iron-sulfur cluster. This is consistent with the in vitrodata suggesting that the acquisition of a [4Fe-4S] cluster by FNR-C20S is sufficient to cause dimerization and DNA binding (16Ralph E.T. Scott C. Jordan P.A. Thomson A.J. Guest J.R. Green J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like wild-type FNR, FNR-C20S was found to form functional heterodimers with FNR-E209V, again indicating that FNR-C20S is able to dimerizein vivo. Both wild-type FNR and FNR-C20S can interfere with FNR-E209V-dependent activation from the YYmelRpromoter, but FNR-C20S was less able to so than wild-type FNR. It is possible that the possession of a miscoordinated [4Fe-4S] cluster slightly impairs the dimerization of FNR-C20S. Because FNRΔ29 cannot form active heterodimers with FNR-E209V nor interfere with FNR-E209V-dependent regulation, it seems likely that FNRΔ29 cannot form heterodimers. This suggests that to form a dimer both, and not just one, of the FNR subunits must contain an iron-sulfur cluster, although one, or both, of these may be miscoordinated as in the case of FNR-C20S. The conclusion that both subunits of an FNR dimer must contain a cluster to permit dimerization and transcriptional activity is in accord with previous studies (23Lazazzera B.A. Bates D.M. Kiley P.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In contrast the structurally homologous CRP of E. coli has been demonstrated to be most active when one of the available allosteric sites of the CRP dimer remains unoccupied (a CRP2·cAMP1complex) rather than a CRP2·cAMP2 complex in which one cAMP molecule is bound per subunit of CRP (24Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6914-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although incorporation of a miscoordinated [4Fe-4S] cluster has only a small effect on FNR dimerization (16Ralph E.T. Scott C. Jordan P.A. Thomson A.J. Guest J.R. Green J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it does dramatically influence the effectiveness of subsequent processes vital to transcription activation, crucially including configuring AR3 such that it can make productive contacts with RNAP. Moreover, although FNR-C20S can regulate the simple FNR-repressed FFgalΔ4 promoter, it is unable to repress transcription from more complex promoters to the same extent as the wild-type FNR (3Sharrocks A.D. Green J. Guest J.R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Melville S.B. Gunsalus R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18733-18736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This may suggest that repression by FNR requires the correct spatial organization of repression-specific regions of amino acids. Conformational changes required for repression may, as those required for activation, be dependent upon the incorporation of a properly coordinated iron-sulfur cluster. The majority of characterized FNR-repressed promoters contain multiple FNR-binding sites (for example, see Refs. 25Marshall F.A. Messenger S.L. Wyborn N.R. Guest J.R. Wing H. Busby S.J.W. Green J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Govantes F. Albrecht J.A. Gunsalus R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1456-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Meng W. Green J. Guest J.R. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1521-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and recent evidence suggests that FNR·FNR contacts between tandemly bound FNR dimers, but not FNR·RNAP contacts, may be involved in repression of transcription from these promoters (25Marshall F.A. Messenger S.L. Wyborn N.R. Guest J.R. Wing H. Busby S.J.W. Green J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Green J. Marshall F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10244-10248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, the correct coordination of the [4Fe-4S] cluster may be required for both FNR·RNAP communication, required in FNR-mediated activation, and FNR·FNR contacts, required for FNR-mediated repression at some promoters. Because the ligands of the FNR iron-sulfur cluster appear to have such a pivotal role in positioning the activating regions, it is interesting to note that many FNR homologues possess N-terminal cysteine signatures different to that of E. coli FNR (for example FnrP fromParacoccus denitrificans, AadR from Rhodopseudomonas palustris, and the FnrN proteins from Rhizobium leguminosarum; Refs. 29De Van Spanning R.J.M. Boer A.P.N. Reijnders W.N.M. Westerhoff H.V. Stouthamer A.H. Van Der Oost J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 893-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 30Dispensa M. Thomas C.T. Kim M.K. Perrotta J.A. Gibson J. Harwood C.S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5803-5813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Anthamatten D. Scherb B. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2111-2120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that different arrangements of ligands found in FNR proteins have evolved to allow optimal alignment of their activating regions with their cognate RNAP. Taking account of the evidence presented here, the model describing the aerobic-anaerobic FNR switch can be refined such that iron-sulfur cluster assembly into two FNR monomers permits their dimerization and enhances site-specific DNA binding. However, correctly engaged iron-sulfur cluster ligands are not essential for these processes, but a correctly engaged Cys20 ligand is essential to establish productive communication with RNAP (via the correct arrangement of activating regions, and possibly repressing regions). Thus, the FNR iron-sulfur cluster is not only the sensor of oxygen and the promoter of dimerization and site-specific DNA binding, but its configuration is fundamental in transmitting the oxygen starvation signal to RNAP and thus plays an important structural role in FNR."
