The relationship between the specific activities of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate from glucose-1-14C and -6-14C and triose-P isomerization has been analyzed. The specific activities are a function of three independent variables, the rate of triose-P isomerization, the contribution of the pentose cycle to glucose metabolism, and relative outflow from the dihydroxyacetone-P or glyceraldehyde-P pools. Equations to calculate the relative specific activities of these two compounds, the rate of triose-P isomerase, and the pentose cycle contribution under conditions of incomplete isotopic equilibration of triose-P have been derived. When synthesis of glycerol is limited, previously derived methods for evaluating the pentose cycle with the use of glucose-1-14C and -6-14C can be applied. 2. The contribution of the pentose cycle was calculated from 14C yields from glucose-1-14C and -6-14C, and from uniformly labeled 14C-glucose, and from degradation of glycerol derived from glucose-2-14C on incubation of epididymal fat tissue from rats. On the addition of epinephrine and growth hormone, similar estimates were obtained by three independent methods, theoretically valid in the absence of complete triose-P isomerization. Two methods, requiring complete equilibration, differed. Under other conditions, all five methods agreed closely. The contribution of the pentose cycle was correlated with fatty acid synthesis. In tissue from rats fasted and refed, or with insulin stimulation, the contribution averaged 25%. In the presence of growth hormone it averaged 11%. In rats fed ad libitum and without hormone, the contribution averaged 14%, and 7% in the presence of epinephrine. 3. Specific activities of the triose phosphates from glucose-1-14C and -6-14C and their rates of isomerization were estimated for the intact adipose tissue. The relative rates ranged from 2 to 10 times those of glucose utilization and were not greatly affected by dietary conditions or hormones. 4. Glucose utilization by tissue from rats fasted and refed, with insulin present, was seven times as high as that of tissue from rats fed ad libitum and without insulin. Of the utilized glucose carbon, 38% appeared in CO2, 45% in fatty acids, and 5% in glycerol. About two-thirds of the CO2 was derived via pyruvate decarboxylation and one-third via the pentose cycle; very little CO2 was evolved via the Krebs cycle. Epinephrine stimulated glucose utilization 3-fold. Of the glucose carbon, 30% appeared in CO2, 7% in fatty acids, and 40% in glycerol. Over half of the CO2 arose via the Krebs cycle, and one-tenth or less via the pentose cycle. Depending on diet and hormones, intermediate patterns between these two extremes were observed. 5. A balance of formation and utilization of reduced pyridine nucleotides in the cytoplasm was established. The total amount of reduced di- and triphosphopyridine-nucleotides formed in the cytoplasm was in small excess over hydrogen equivalents required for the synthesis of fatty acids, glycerol, and lactate. Under conditions of enhanced fatty acid synthesis, the TPNH formed via the pentose cycle was found to provide only 59 to 88% of the hydrogen required for fatty acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1557604991,"Phospholipase C (α toxin of Clostridium perfringens) has been found to cause, at relative high concentrations, the lysis of fat cells isolated from rat epididymal adipose tissue. Lysis of the fat cells resulted in the loss of insulin response in proportion to the amount of cells broken. It is suggested that the effects of insulin on glucose metabolism by the fat cell are dependent on the presence of an intact cell membrane. The level of flexokinase activity in the fat cell was not affected by insulin or phospholipase C; sufficient hexokinase was present to account for all the glucose phosphorylated by fat cells in response to insulin. Evidence is presented that glucose is transported in the fat cell by a carrier-mediated, stereospecific process. Insulin and treatment of fat cells with phospholipase C under conditions that did not cause lysis, stimulated the transport of glucose. Anabolic processes, such as fatty acid synthesis from glucose and amino acid incorporation into protein, were also stimulated by insulin and phospholipase C. The action of phospholipase C on glucose transport and amino acid utilization was a function of enzyme concentration, suggesting that the amount of cellular phospholipid hydrolyzed by the enzyme determined the amount of solute entering the cell. Phospholipids appear, therefore, to be linked to transport processes. The common effects of insulin and phospholipase C on the fat cell suggests that the same parameter in the cell is affected by these substances. It is hypothesized that insulin and phospholipase C act on the plasma membrane to alter the configuration of its lipoproteins from a laminated to a micellar or globular form. The latter configuration of the membrane lipoproteins might have interstices that permit the carrier-mediated passage of solutes into the cell."

https://openalex.org/W2083962704,"Compared to homologous tissues from adult animals, rapidly growing embryonic and fetal tissues contain large amounts of collagen proline hydroxylase. Lung and skin from scorbutic guinea pigs contain one-third as much enzyme as normal tissues do. A rapid increase in proline hydroxylase occurs on the 2nd day of formation of granuloma after injection of carrageenan and on the 4th day of wound healing. The increase in enzyme activity is associated with the onset of collagen biosynthesis and deposition."
https://openalex.org/W1983883756,"Dopamine, apomorphine, isoproterenol, and norepinephrine each increased the concentration of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in slice of rat caudate nucleus. The concentrations of dopamine, apomorphine isoproterenol, and norepinephrine causing half-maximal increases were 60, 150, 0.03 and 30 micromoles per liter, respectively. The effect of dopamine was blocked by fluphenazine, a dopamine receptor antagonist, but not by propranolol, a beta-andrenergic receptor antagonist. Conversely, the effect of isoproterenol was blocked by propranolol but not by fluphenazine. The results suggest that in rat caudate nucleus there are two distinct catecholamine receptors capable of causing increased concentrations of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, one having the characteristic of dopamine receptor, and the other having the characteristics of beta-adrenergic receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1545089847,"The dependence of chemical shifts in the nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of pyridine nucleotides on concentration, pH, and temperature has been examined. The data indicate that all of the dinucleotides exist predominantly in a folded conformation, with the planes of the two rings stacked in parallel. The free energy of formation of the intramolecular complexes has been estimated to be of the order of -0.5 to -1.0 Kcal per mole. The present data do not allow a distinction between a single complex with a unique geometrical configuration and a multiplicity of complexes undergoing rapid exchange. However, the relative instability of the complexes, together with a detailed examination of the 64 alternative structures with the aid of molecular models, leads us to prefer the latter possibility."

https://openalex.org/W1989520958,"Brief stimulation of cholinergic preganglionic nerve fibers resulted in an increase in guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in the bullfrog sympathetic ganglion. When the release of synaptic transmitter was prevented by a high-magnesium, low-calcium Ringer solution, stimulation of preganglionic nerve fibers did not increase cyclic GMP in the ganglion. The increase in cyclic GMP caused by preganglionic stimulation was also blocked by the muscarinic antagonist, atropine. The data indicate that the increase in cyclic GMP is associated with synaptic transmission and support the possibility that cyclic GMP may mediate the postsynaptic action of acetylcholine at muscarinic cholinergic synapses."

https://openalex.org/W1583895060,"Abstract Dihydrofolic reductase has been purified approximately 8000-fold from chicken liver and appears to be essentially homogeneous by the criterion of aminopterin inhibition. The observed turnover number in the range of 300 (dihydrofolate at pH 7.4) agrees with various calculated values. The titration with aminopterin also confirmed the remarkably low molecular weight (23,000) for a pyridine nucleotide enzyme and suggests one binding site per molecule. The most effective stabilizing agent for the enzyme was triphosphopyridine nucleotide or its reduced form. The binding of TPN is reflected in its ability to act as a potent competitive inhibitor of the reductase reaction (Ki = 2.4 x 10-6 m). With dihydrofolate and TPNH, the purified enzyme exhibits two pH optima, 4 and 7.4. At the neutral pH optimum, the reaction is specific for these two substrates. In the acid pH range, DPNH may be utilized as the reducing agent with dihydrofolate (pH optimum, 5.5), and folate exhibits significant substrate activity with TPNH (pH optimum, 3.8). Also in the acid range, citrate is an inhibitor of the reduction of dihydrofolate, but not folate. Kinetic analysis of the interaction of dihydrofolate with the enzyme and TPNH yielded a curve with an estimated Km of approximately 1.5 x 10-7 m at pH 7.4. Although Vmax is 3 to 4 times higher at pH 4.5 than pH 7.4, the Km appears to be the same at both pH ranges. The interaction of folate with the enzyme and TPNH yields normal kinetics with a Km of 6.7 x 10-6 (citrate buffer). The interaction of TPNH with the enzyme and dihydrofolate reveals normal kinetics at pH 7.4 and sigmoid kinetics at pH 4 with either dihydrofolate or folate. However, the apparent Km appears to be the same (1.6 x 10-6) with either substrate and at either pH."
https://openalex.org/W1530372748,"The reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide-cytochrome f reductase of chloroplasts is shown to be identical with TPNH diaphorase, transhydrogenase, and ferredoxin-TPN reductase. The crystalline enzyme, aflavin adenine dinucleotide-flavoprotein, has a molecular weight of 40,000 to 45,000. Turnover numbers of 4,600 and 18,000 are calculated for TPNH-cytochrome f reductase and ferricyanide reductase activities, respectively. The Km values for TPNH-ferricytochrome f and ferricyanide are reported. The mechanism of ferricytochrome f and of ferricyanide reactions seem to differ on the basis of reaction kinetics. The former, but not the latter, seem to involve the formation of a ternary complex of enzyme with both substrates. The enzyme is reversibly inactivated by preincubation with TPNH; TPN prevents and reverses inactivation. Relatively low concentrations of urea convert the reversible inactivation by TPNH into an irreversible process. The function of FAD and urea-sensitive bonds in the preservation of the native structure of the enzyme is discussed on the basis of these findings."

https://openalex.org/W1513540136,"Abstract The total biosynthesis of ubiquinone-9 from p-hydroxy[U-14C]benzoate has been demonstrated in mitochondria isolated from rat liver slices preincubated with mevalonic acid. Two partial reactions were also demonstrated. These were the conversion of p-hydroxybenzoate to 5-demethoxyubiquinone-9 and sequentially, the conversion of 5-demethoxyubiquinone-9 to ubiquinone-9. Furthermore, these reactions were found to be catalyzed by the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. It appeared that the only external requirements for this mitochondrial system are ATP, p-hydroxybenzoate, and a source of isopentenyl pyrophosphate. Conversion of 5-demethoxyubiquinone-9 to ubiquinone-9, which involves one hydroxylation and one methylation, is dependent upon molecular oxygen, S-adenosylmethionine, and reducing equivalents as indicated by a preference for succinate over malate. The over-all reaction is inhibited by CO but not by KCN. External ATP was essential for the conversion of p-hydroxybenzoate to 5-demethoxyubiquinone-9, but not for the conversion of 5-demethoxyubiquinone-9 to ubiquinone-9. These data suggest that the inner membrane of liver mitochondria is capable of the hydroxylation and methylation of aromatic precursors of ubiquinone."

https://openalex.org/W2163755475,"Abstract The chemical syntheses of mono- and dimethyl esters of riboflavin phosphate were accomplished by allowing riboflavin to react with the appropriate mono- and dimethylchlorophosphoric acids. Riboflavin monomethyl phosphate was found to be coenzymatically active with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-cytochrome c aporeductase, pyridoxine (or pyridoxamine) phosphate apooxidase, and glycolate apooxidase. Riboflavin phosphate esters of cellulose phosphate and diethylaminoethyl cellulose were prepared by reactions with riboflavin dichlorophosphate in pyridine; the corresponding derivative of cellulose was prepared by reaction with riboflavin phosphate and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in pyridine. The riboflavin phosphate cellulose compounds were used to retain the riboflavin phosphate-dependent apoenzymes selectively during their chromatographic purification from extraneous protein. Extensive enrichment of glycolate apooxidase was achieved by chromatography on riboflavin phosphate cellulose."

These data support previous observations that vitamin D(2) is not effective in preventing metabolic bone disease in this species.
https://openalex.org/W2069684284,"The maintenance of the cation gradients between endolymph and perilymph in the cochlea requires the operation of a cation pump. An adenosine triphosphatase system activated by sodium and potassium is present in high activity in the cochlear membranes (tegmentum vasculosum and stria vascularis). The cochlear microphonic potential is inhibited by perilymphatic perfusion of ouabain and erythrophleine. Since the microphonic potential depends on the high concentration of potassium ions in the endolymph, our findings strongly suggest the operation of an adenosine triphosphatase cation pump system activated by sodium and potassium, in the generation of cochlear cation gradients."

There is approximately a 10-fold increase in the specific activity of liver glutamate dehydrogenase during the spontaneous metamorphosis of tadpoles (Rana catesbeiana). 2. Comparative studies of glutamate dehydrogenases from premetamorphic tadpole liver and adult frog liver revealed differences in kinetic constants for DPN and TPN, in the effect of temperature on initial rates with DPN as coenzyme, in the crude molecular weights estimated from sucrose density centrifugation, and in relative reactivities with l-amino acids other than glutamate. 3. An antibody produced in rabbits against crystalline frog liver glutamate dehydrogenase precipitates glutamate dehydrogenase preparations from frog, tadpole, beef, and chicken liver and affects their reaction kinetics in a similar manner."
https://openalex.org/W1517916753,"Abstract The binding and function of FMN, 3,6,7-trimethyl-9-(1'-d-ribityl)isoalloxazine 5'-phosphate (3-methyl-FMN),6,7-dichloro-9-(1'-d-ribityl)isoalloxazine 5'-phosphate (6,7-dichloro-FMN), and 6,7-dimethyl-9-(5'-hydroxypentyl)isoalloxazine 5'-phosphate (5'-hydroxypentyl-FMN) has been investigated with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate dehydrogenase and NADPH cytochrome c reductase from yeast, NADH oxidase from a pseudomonad, pyridoxamine phosphate oxidase from liver, and glycolate oxidase from spinach. Considerable variation has been observed in the quantitative behavior of the flavin phosphates with the differing apoenzymes through measurements of Vmax and Km or Ki. The earlier postulation that the 3-imino group of the isoalloxazine is primary point of attachment of the flavin phosphate to an FMN-dependent apoenzyme must now be modified, especially for the NADPH dehydrogenase (old yellow enzyme) which has been considered to be the prototype of flavin coenzyme-apoenzyme interaction. Present observations with 3-methyl-FMN indicate a lack of absolute dependence on the 3-imino group and suggest a rather diffuse interaction through mutual polarization or partial charge transfer between relatively large portions of the isoalloxazine structure and perhaps aromatic amino acid residues in the proteins. The generally better binding than function of 6,7-dichloro-FMN indicates that the relatively poor function of similar analogues may be expected with substituent changes in position 6 and 7 which are of the approximate size of methyl groups but through contribution to the electromeric structure of the isoalloxazine markedly change the oxidation-reduction potential. The optimal requirement for a full complement of secondary hydroxyl groups in d configuration on the side chain in position 9 is apparent from the generally decreased coenzymatic activity seen with 5'-hydroxypentyl-FMN. However, there is no absolute dependence on interaction of the enzymes with each secondary hydroxyl group of a flavin phosphate, but rather a steric relationship which favors proper disposition of coenzyme to apoenzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1543352718,"Abstract The dihydrofolate reductase of the amethopterin-sensitive Streptococcus faecalis (SF/O) and of the amethopterin-resistant mutant strain S. faecalis/Ak(SF/Ak) have been partially purified by a three step procedure comprising treatment with protamine sulfate, fractionation with ammonium sulfate, and gel filtration. The most highly purified material in gel filtration fractions catalyzes the reduction of 2.4 or 4.9 µmoles of dihydrofolate per min per mg of protein of SF/O or SF/Ak, respectively. Half-maximal reaction velocities of both enzymes were calculated to occur at dihydrofolate and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate concentrations of 0.013 and 0.022 mm, respectively. Inhibition by amethopterin of dihydrofolate reduction is essentially stoichiometric with excess enzyme, and reversible with equivalent or excess inhibitor. The purified enzymes exhibit several properties which indicate a structural dissimilarity. Optimal activity of the SF/O enzyme occurs at pH 6.2; pH 6.7 is optimum for the SF/Ak enzyme. The preparation of the SF/Ak dihydrofolate reductase shows a 12-fold elevation in titration of amethopterin per unit of activity. The enzymes appear to migrate through a column of Sephadex G-100 at slightly different rates. Several possible causes of the alteration in drug-binding ability of the SF/Ak dihydrofolate reductase preparation have been considered: a decreased turnover rate; an accelerated dissociation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex; and an altered drug affinity. Attention has been given also to drug interaction at buffer sites other than the reactive site; partial attachment of drug to enzyme; and the presence of other amethopterin-binding protein with considerably lower dihydrofolate reductase activity. Another interesting, and perhaps not unrelated, difference was observed upon extended incubation of cultures. In SF/Ak, amethopterin-binding capacity and enzyme activity decreased proportionately while enzyme activity remained constant in SF/O."

The reaction catalyzed was found to be 5-Keto-d-fructose + NADPH + H+ ⇌ d-fructose + NADP+ with an equilibrium far towards the right (Keq = 2 x 1010). Km values for NADPH, NADP+, 5-ketofructose, and fructose were 1.8 x 10-6 m; 1.3 x 10-3 m; 4.5 x 10-3 m; and 7.0 x 10-2 m, respectively, at pH 7.4."

https://openalex.org/W1551058913,"Abstract Parathyroid hormone administered in vivo to rabbits produced a metabolic alteration in kidney cortex mitochondria, evidenced by diminished respiratory rate, respiratory control, and P:O ratio with a series of substrates including pyruvate plus fumarate, succinate, α-ketoglutarate, malate, citrate, and isocitrate. The adenosine triphosphate-inorganic phosphate exchange reaction rate was decreased and adenosine triphosphatase activity was increased compared to control mitochondria. These changes did not become apparent until about 12 hours after injection, were undiminished by 24 hours, and could be elicited with as little as 200 U.S.P. units of hormone. Under identical conditions liver mitochondria were unaffected. Diphospho- and triphosphopyridine nucleotides in combination frequently elevated the respiration in parathyroid-treated mitochondria close to or above control levels with citrate and isocitrate but not with the remaining substrates and had no effect no respiratory control with any of the substrates. The effects of the hormone could not be duplicated by elevating and maintaining in otherwise normal rabbits serum calcium concentrations at twice normal level for 6 hours. It is concluded that the effects produced by parathyroid hormone on kidney are multiple in nature and related to the Ca++-raising potency of the preparations."

They concluded that this addit.ional TPN+ was destroyed in the strong acid ext,raction and that therefore in liver tissue the total content of TPNf + TPNH is higher, and the ratio of TPNH to TPN+ lower, than reported by earlier investigators (3-6). Burch, Lowry, and Von Dippe (1) used the common method consisting of extraction of the tissue first and then assay of the pyridine nucleotides. The reduced pyridine nucleotides were measured after alkaline extraction and the oxidized forms after acid extraction. Each extraction must preserve the corresponding oxidation-reduction form of the pyridine nucleotides or else apparent deviations of the total pyridine nucleotide content will be observed. The extraction method of Burch, Lowry, and Von Dippe (1) was examined with a new enzymatic assay of reduced pyridine nucleotides in alkaline extracts (7) and a method for the assay of both reduced and oxidized pyridine nucleotides in one extract (8,Q). Upon extraction with perchloric acid, TPNH and DPNH are quantitatively degraded to adenosine 5’.diphosphate ribose 2’.phosphate and adenosine 5’-diphosphate ribose, respectively. These degradation products and t,he unaffected oxidized pyridine nucleotides are separated by ion exchange chromatography and measured by their absorption at 265 mp. By this method, it can be decided whether the acid-labile TPN+ of Burch et al. (I) really occurs, or whether it is due to conversion of TPNH to TPN during the inactivation of the tissue in the course of extraction. In the first case, the total amount of TPN+ + TPNH assayed should be higher in the weak acid ext.ract than in the strong acid extract, whereas in the second case it should be the same in both extracts."
