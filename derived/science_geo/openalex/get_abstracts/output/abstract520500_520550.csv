We addressed these issues using mice heterozygous for Dlx5/6, which regulate GABAergic interneuron development. In Dlx5/6+/− mice, FSINs become abnormal following adolescence, coinciding with the onset of cognitive inflexibility and deficient task-evoked γ oscillations.

These findings elucidate a mechanism whereby abnormal FSIN development may contribute to the post-adolescent onset of schizophrenia endophenotypes. Furthermore, they demonstrate a causal, potentially therapeutic, role for PFC interneuron-driven γ oscillations in cognitive domains at the core of schizophrenia. In the prefrontal cortex (PFC), rhythmic neural activity in the gamma-frequency band (γ; ∼30–120 Hz) is believed to play a key role in many cognitive functions (Uhlhaas and Singer, 2010Uhlhaas P.J. Singer W. Abnormal neural oscillations and synchrony in schizophrenia.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 100-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). γ oscillations in the cortex and hippocampus are controlled by a specific class of inhibitory interneurons that can be identified based on either their fast-spiking electrophysiological properties or their expression of calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) (Cauli et al., 1997Cauli B. Audinat E. Lambolez B. Angulo M.C. Ropert N. Tsuzuki K. Hestrin S. Rossier J. Molecular and physiological diversity of cortical nonpyramidal cells.J.

Neurophysiol. 1993; 70: 387-396PubMed Google Scholar). Fast-spiking PV interneurons (FSINs) fire rhythmically at γ frequencies in vivo (Penttonen et al., 1998Penttonen M. Kamondi A. Acsády L. Buzsáki G. Gamma frequency oscillation in the hippocampus of the rat: intracellular analysis in vivo.Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 718-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and selectively activating PV interneurons at 40 Hz in vivo leads to a specific increase in the power of γ oscillations not seen with stimulation of other cell types (Cardin et al., 2009Cardin J.A. Carlén M. Meletis K. Knoblich U. Zhang F. Deisseroth K. Tsai L.H. Moore C.I. Driving fast-spiking cells induces gamma rhythm and controls sensory responses.Nature. 2009; 459: 663-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). Conversely, inhibiting PV interneurons suppresses the power of evoked γ oscillations in vivo (Sohal et al., 2009Sohal V.S. Zhang F. Yizhar O. Deisseroth K. Parvalbumin neurons and gamma rhythms enhance cortical circuit performance.Nature. 2009; 459: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar), demonstrating that PV cells play major roles in γ oscillations. Altered γ oscillations in the PFC and other brain regions may be associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Schizophrenia comprises positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions, as well as deficits in PFC-dependent cognitive domains such as attention, cognitive flexibility, working memory, and social cognition (Green, 2006Green M.F. Cognitive impairment and functional outcome in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.J. Clin. Psychiatry. 2006; 67: e12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cognitive deficits seem to represent the core of the disorder, because whereas other symptoms may enter periods of remission, cognitive symptoms persist throughout the duration of illness, correlate best with long-term functional outcome, and often precede the onset of frank psychosis (Green, 2006Green M.F. Cognitive impairment and functional outcome in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.J. Clin. Psychiatry. 2006; 67: e12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Minzenberg and Carter, 2012Minzenberg M.J. Carter C.S. Developing treatments for impaired cognition in schizophrenia.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2012; 16: 35-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, current antipsychotic treatments are only minimally effective for cognitive symptoms (Minzenberg and Carter, 2012Minzenberg M.J. Carter C.S. Developing treatments for impaired cognition in schizophrenia.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2012; 16: 35-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). EEG recordings over human frontal cortex reveal increases in γ oscillations specifically during PFC-dependent tasks that require cognitive flexibility (Cho et al., 2006Cho R.Y. Konecky R.O.

Gamma oscillatory power is impaired during cognitive control independent of medication status in first-episode schizophrenia.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2010; 35: 2590-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In contrast, during the same tasks, patients with schizophrenia show decreases or no change in γ oscillations, along with impaired performance. Studies of post-mortem brain tissue from subjects with schizophrenia have also consistently found abnormalities in cortical GABAergic interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) (Volk and Lewis, 2013Volk D.W. Lewis D.A. Prenatal ontogeny as a susceptibility period for cortical GABA neuron disturbances in schizophrenia.Neuroscience. 2013; 248: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), a process directed by several transcription factors including Dlx1, Dlx2, Lhx6, Dlx5, and Dlx6. In particular, in schizophrenia, levels of GAD67 and PV are lower for PV interneurons within the PFC, and markers for GABA transporters, post-synaptic GABA receptors, and ion channels associated with PV interneurons are abnormal as well (Lewis et al., 2005Lewis D.A. Hashimoto T. Volk D.W. Cortical inhibitory neurons and schizophrenia.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 312-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar, Volk and Lewis, 2013Volk D.W. Lewis D.A. Prenatal ontogeny as a susceptibility period for cortical GABA neuron disturbances in schizophrenia.Neuroscience. 2013; 248: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This has led to the hypothesis that in schizophrenia, dysfunction of MGE-derived interneurons, particularly PV interneurons, results in deficient task-evoked γ oscillations that contribute to cognitive dysfunction and other symptoms of the disease (Lewis et al., 2005Lewis D.A. Hashimoto T. Volk D.W. Cortical inhibitory neurons and schizophrenia.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 312-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar, Uhlhaas and Singer, 2010Uhlhaas P.J. Singer W. Abnormal neural oscillations and synchrony in schizophrenia.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 100-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether the alterations in interneurons observed in schizophrenia cause abnormal γ oscillations and thereby contribute to cognitive deficits or whether alterations in PV interneurons and γ oscillations represent incidental or compensatory changes. While many studies have found important schizophrenia-related abnormalities in mutant mice with disruptions in cortical GABAergic interneurons (Belforte et al., 2010Belforte J.E. Zsiros V. Sklar E.R.

By contrast, NMDAR antagonists can both increase baseline γ oscillations and decrease sensory stimulus-evoked γ power (Saunders et al., 2012Saunders J.A. Gandal M.J. Siegel S.J. NMDA antagonists recreate signal-to-noise ratio and timing perturbations present in schizophrenia.Neurobiol. Dis. 2012; 46: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, specific aspects of GABAergic interneuron development that may contribute to the post-adolescent onset of schizophrenia remain largely unknown. Most critically, it has not yet been possible to demonstrate any causal role for interneuron-driven γ oscillations in cognition. Thus, the hypothesized links between interneuron dysfunction, deficient task-evoked γ oscillations, and deficits in PFC-dependent cognition remain tentative at best. Here we set out to (1) test whether the deficiency of factors that guide the development of MGE-derived interneurons can elicit key pathophysiological findings (prominent deficits in FSINs) and endophenotypes (decreased task-evoked γ oscillations and impaired PFC-dependent cognition) linked to schizophrenia, (2) identify developmental processes that could contribute to the post-adolescent onset of schizophrenia, and (3) directly implicate γ-frequency activity of PFC interneurons in cognitive domains linked to schizophrenia. To address these issues, we analyzed Dlx5/6+/− mutant mice. Although Dlx5 and Dlx6 are not known to be abnormal in schizophrenia, these homeobox transcription factors play critical roles in the development of MGE-derived cortical GABAergic interneurons. Knocking out Dlx5/6 reduces numbers of PV interneurons without affecting numbers of interneurons belonging to other classes (Wang et al., 2010Wang Y. Dye C.A. Sohal V. Long J.E. Estrada R.C. Roztocil T. Lufkin T. Deisseroth K. Baraban S.C. Rubenstein J.L. Dlx5 and Dlx6 regulate the development of parvalbumin-expressing cortical interneurons.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 5334-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), suggesting that Dlx5/6 are particularly important for FSIN development. While overall numbers of FS/PV interneurons are normal in both Dlx5/6+/− mice and schizophrenia, we hypothesized that they may exhibit functional abnormalities in Dlx5/6+/− mice that parallel their histochemical alterations in schizophrenia. Many factors can modulate the consequences of reductions in gene dosage in ways that depend on background strain. Therefore, although we carried out the bulk of our studies in Dlx5/6+/− mice on a mixed (CD1 and C57Bl/6) background, as described below, we also confirmed that major behavioral and physiological phenotypes of Dlx5/6+/− mice were also present in two additional lines of mice with disruptions in Dlx5/6: (1) Dlx5/6+/− mice that had been backcrossed to CD1 for at least six generations, and (2) mice that combined heterozygosity for Dlx6 with a forebrain GABAergic neuron-specific knockout of Dlx5 (DlxI12b::Cre × Dlx5fl/-Dlx6+/−; Figure S1) and were on a different background than our Dlx5/6+/− mice. To assess FSIN function in Dlx5/6+/− mice, we made whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from FSINs in layer 5 of medial PFC (mPFC) in adult (P63—P82) mutant mice and wild-type (WT) littermates. We visually identified interneurons for electrophysiological analyses using AAV and the DlxI12b enhancer to express mCherry (Lee et al., 2014Lee A.T. Gee S.M. Vogt D. Patel T. Rubenstein J.L. Sohal V.S. Pyramidal neurons in prefrontal cortex receive subtype-specific forms of excitation and inhibition.Neuron. 2014; 81: 61-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Based on electrophysiological criteria, we selected FSINs for further study (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The well-established correspondence between PV expression and FS electrophysiological properties was maintained in Dlx5/6+/− and WT mice, as there were no significant differences in intrinsic properties between immunohistochemically identified PV cells (n = 5 for each genotype) and electrophysiologically identified FSINs (n = 16–23 for each genotype). Based on their responses to a series of current injections, FSIN excitability was abnormal in Dlx5/6+/− mice (Figures 1B and 1C ). Specifically, Dlx5/6+/− FSINs had wider spikes, higher input resistances, slower membrane time constants, and markedly elevated action potential thresholds (WT, n = 23; Dlx5/6+/−, n = 16). While more subtle changes may be present in other cell types, examination of the same properties in pyramidal neurons and non-FS interneurons did not reveal any changes of comparable magnitude (Figures S2C and S2D). We also confirmed that similar differences in the intrinsic properties of adult FSINs were present in Dlx5/6+/− mice backcrossed to CD1 for at least six generations, and in DlxI12b::Cre × Dlx5fl/−Dlx6+/− conditional knockout mice (Figures S2E and S2F). Again, comparable deficits were not seen in pyramidal neurons or non-FS interneurons (Figures S2E and S2F). Next, we examined whether these abnormalities in FSIN properties were age dependent. FSIN intrinsic properties mature over several weeks (Okaty et al., 2009Okaty B.W. Miller M.N. Sugino K. Hempel C.M. Nelson S.B. Transcriptional and electrophysiological maturation of neocortical fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 7040-7052Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and based on recordings at P16–P20, P45–P49, and P63–P82, we observed a progressive maturation of FSIN properties—specifically, decreases in spike half-width and membrane time constant (Goldberg et al., 2011Goldberg E.M. Jeong H.Y. Kruglikov I. Tremblay R. Lazarenko R.M. Rudy B. Rapid developmental maturation of neocortical FS cell intrinsic excitability.Cereb. Cortex. 2011; 21: 666-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (Figures S2A and S2B). Remarkably, FSIN intrinsic properties in Dlx5/6+/− mice were normal at the first two time points (P16–P20: n = 8 mice per genotype, p = 0.5–0.9; P45–P49: n = 9 WT and n = 5 Dlx5/6+/−mice, p = 0.4–0.9; Figure 1C). Thus, the abnormal FSIN properties we found in Dlx5/6+/− mice only appear during the post-adolescent period, when the normal maturation of FSIN intrinsic properties is largely complete. We also assayed whether intrinsic FSIN deficits occur within a broader context of deficient inhibitory output by comparing evoked inhibitory currents in pyramidal neurons within the mPFC of adult Dlx5/6+/− and WT mice. We expressed ChR2-eYFP in interneurons using the same DlxI12b enhancer previously used to fluorescently label interneurons for patching. We recorded from P63–P88 layer 5 pyramidal neurons while delivering light flashes across a high-power field to optogenetically evoke inhibitory currents (Figure 1D). We stimulated at 40 Hz to measure the ability of interneurons to generate synchronized γ-frequency inhibition (Figures 1E and 1F). The amplitudes of optogenetically evoked IPSCs were much lower in Dlx5/6+/− mice (n = 16) compared to WT littermates (n = 14; p < 0.001). (To control for possible confounding differences in ChR2-eYFP expression, we confirmed that eYFP fluorescence was not decreased in Dlx5/6+/− mice; cf. Figure S6C.) Thus, in addition to the intrinsic abnormalities described above, there is an overall impairment in the ability of local inhibitory circuits to generate γ-frequency inhibition, and other interneuron subtypes do not simply compensate for FSIN deficits. Our next series of experiments examined whether these abnormalities in the post-adolescent development of FSINs and in local inhibitory output accompanied cognitive and behavioral endophenotypes of schizophrenia. We specifically assessed anxiety, cognitive flexibility, and social interaction. 7-week-old Dlx5/6+/− mice did not show significant differences in anxiety, measured by time spent in the center of a novel open field (n = 9 mice per genotype; Figure 2A) or the open arms of an elevated plus maze (EPM; WT, n = 4; Dlx5/6+/−, n = 5; Figure 2B). However, after 10 weeks of age, there was a significant increase in both measures of anxiety in Dlx5/6+/− mice compared to their WT littermates (open field: n = 9 WT and 8 Dlx5/6+/− mice, p < 0.01; EPM: n = 4 mice per genotype, p < 0.05; Figures 2A and 2B). A similar age-dependent increase in anxiety was observed in DlxI12b::Cre × Dlx5fl/−Dlx6+/− mice (Figure S3A). Next, we specifically assessed cognitive flexibility using a task (Figure 2C) in which a mouse learns to associate food reward with either an odor or a digging medium (initial association). In this task, mice are presented with two bowls on each trial and must choose to dig in one bowl to find the food reward. Each bowl contains a different odor and a different digging medium, and the odor-medium combinations vary from trial to trial. Once the mouse has learned the initial association between food reward and a specific stimulus (either an odor or digging medium), the type of stimulus that predicts reward changes (e.g., from an odor to a digging medium or vice versa), and the new rule must be learned (rule shift). As our data below show, performance on this task depends strongly on the mPFC, and deficits in performance on this task observed in Dlx5/6+/− mice are stable across multiple days of testing. At 7 weeks of age, both Dlx5/6+/− and WT mice (n = 5 per genotype) could learn the initial association and rule shift after similar numbers of trials (Figure 2D). However, after 10 weeks of age, while both groups of mice still learned the initial association in a similar number of trials, adult Dlx5/6+/− mice were specifically impaired during the rule-shifting portion of the task (n = 8 mice per genotype; p < 0.001; Figures 2F and 2G). We further confirmed that adult Dlx5/6+/− mice had no deficiency in odor detection (Figure S3B). Finally, similar rule-shifting deficits occurred in Dlx5/6+/− mice backcrossed to CD1 for at least six generations, as well as in DlxI12b::Cre × Dlx5fl/−Dlx6+/− mice (Figures S3C–S3F). We also tested whether Dlx5/6+/− mice could learn a new rule that was the reverse of the initial association. For example, if mice initially learned to associate an odor (garlic) with food reward, then the previously unrewarded odor (coriander) became associated with food reward. Initially, we simply appended this “rule reversal” to the end of our rule shift task (WT, n = 6; Dlx5/6+/−, n = 7; Figures 3A and 3B ). We also carried out the rule reversal immediately following the initial association, then tested mice on a rule shift (n = 5; Figures 3A and 3C). In both cases, Dlx5/6+/− mice performed normally on the rule reversal but were extremely impaired during the rule shift. This demonstrates that after Dlx5/6+/− mice form an initial association, they can learn a rule that is the reverse of that initial association, but not one based on a set of stimuli that were previously irrelevant to the outcome of each trial (Figure 3C). This broadly resembles the effects of mPFC lesions in a more extensive version of this task, in which mPFC lesions impair learning of associations based on previously irrelevant cues, but not the reversal of previously learned associations (Bissonette et al., 2008Bissonette G.B. Martins G.J. Franz T.M. Harper E.S. Schoenbaum G. Powell E.M. Double dissociation of the effects of medial and orbital prefrontal cortical lesions on attentional and affective shifts in mice.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 11124-11130Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as we will describe, this selective impairment during rule shifts but not rule reversals is identical to the pattern elicited by acute optogenetic inhibition of mPFC interneurons. In addition to measuring anxiety and cognitive flexibility, we also compared social interaction in Dlx5/6+/− and WT mice. We did not find differences in the time Dlx5/6+/− and WT mice spend investigating a novel juvenile mouse introduced into their home cage, although we did find differences in social interaction-induced EEG oscillations, described below. We implanted EEG electrodes at the dorsolateral border of PFC and recorded intracranial EEG from freely moving mice of both genotypes at 7 weeks of age and in adults (at least 10 weeks old) (Figures 4A and 4B ). First, we examined EEG power at baseline, when mice were resting in their home cage. Adult (n = 8 per genotype), but not 7-week-old (n = 5 per genotype), Dlx5/6+/− mice exhibited an increase in baseline γ oscillations (Figures 4C and 4D). This is notable because whereas many studies of schizophrenia have reported decreases in γ oscillations evoked by tasks, others have reported increases in baseline or resting γ power (Lee et al., 2006Lee S.-H.

Elevations in baseline γ oscillations have also been observed in previous studies of mice with deficits in interneuron function (Carlén et al., 2012Carlén M. Meletis K. Siegle J.H. Cardin J.A.

NMDA receptor ablation on parvalbumin-positive interneurons impairs hippocampal synchrony, spatial representations, and working memory.Neuron. 2010; 68: 557-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). We also verified that similar increases in baseline γ oscillations occur in DlxI12b::Cre × Dlx5fl/−Dlx6+/− mice (Figure S4A). Next, we examined whether in addition to increased baseline γ oscillations, we could also observe the deficient task-evoked γ oscillations that are associated with cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. For this, we recorded and analyzed prefrontal EEG activity during rule shifting. The recruitment of PFC γ oscillations by rule shifting was not markedly different in Dlx5/6+/− and WT mice at 7 weeks of age (Figure 4E), when Dlx5/6+/− mice perform normally. However, in adult Dlx5/6+/− mice, rule shifts recruited significantly less γ power (62–120 Hz) (Figure 4G). Thus, like the abnormalities in FSINs, anxiety, and cognitive flexibility described earlier, EEG abnormalities in Dlx5/6+/− mice only appear following adolescence. Notably, we confirmed that deficient rule shift-evoked γ oscillations are region specific, as EEG recordings over temporal cortex during rule shifting do not show γ-frequency differences between WT and Dlx5/6+/− mice (Figure S4C). To test whether deficient γ oscillations could be observed during other PFC-dependent tasks, we recorded EEG activity during social interaction (Figures 4F and 4H). Notably, mPFC stimulation alters behavior during this task (Yizhar et al., 2011Yizhar O. Fenno L.E. Prigge M. Schneider F. Davidson T.J. O’Shea D.J. Sohal V.S. Goshen I. Finkelstein J. Paz J.T. et al.Neocortical excitation/inhibition balance in information processing and social dysfunction.Nature. 2011; 477: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar), and changes in mPFC activity also occur during social tasks in humans (Assaf et al., 2010Assaf M. Jagannathan K. Calhoun V.D. Miller L. Stevens M.C. Sahl R. O’Boyle J.G. Schultz R.T. Pearlson G.D. Abnormal functional connectivity of default mode sub-networks in autism spectrum disorder patients.Neuroimage. 2010; 53: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Task-evoked rhythmic activity was similar in Dlx5/6+/− and WT mice at 7 weeks of age (Figure 4F). By contrast, in adult mice, social interaction induced robust increases in PFC γ oscillations in WT, but not Dlx5/6+/− mice (Figure 4H). In fact, Dlx5/6+/− mice exhibited a slight decrease in prefrontal γ power. We observed similar deficits in DlxI12b::Cre × Dlx5fl/−Dlx6+/− mice (Figure S4B). Thus, decreased task-evoked γ power and increased baseline γ power both appear in Dlx5/6+/− mice in concert with the post-adolescent onset of FSIN abnormalities, suggesting that these phenomena may reflect a singular underlying pathological process. To test whether mPFC interneuron dysfunction is sufficient to disrupt cognitive flexibility, we injected the mPFC of DlxI12b-Cre mice, which selectively express Cre in GABAergic interneurons (Han et al., 2012Han S.

To investigate this, we optogenetically activated steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1)-expressing neurons in the dorsomedial and central parts of the VMH (VMHdm/c), and observed a range of context-dependent somatomotor and autonomic responses resembling animals' natural defensive behaviors. By activating independent pathways emanating from the VMHdm/c, we demonstrated that VMHdm/c projection to the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG) induces inflexible immobility, while the VMHdm/c to anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHN) pathway promotes avoidance. Consistent with the behavior changes induced by VMH to AHN pathway activation, direct activation of the AHN elicited avoidance and escape jumping, but not immobility. Retrograde tracing studies revealed that nearly 50% of PAG-projecting VMHdm/c neurons send collateral projection to the AHN and vice versa. Thus, VMHdm/c neurons employ a one-to-many wiring configuration to orchestrate multiple aspects of defensive behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W1995315737,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with loss of the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin and disruption of cell-cell junctions as well as with acquisition of migratory properties including reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and activation of the RhoA GTPase. Here we show that depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton of various metastatic cancer cell lines with Cytochalasin D (Cyt D) reduces cell size and F-actin levels and induces E-cadherin expression at both the protein and mRNA level. Induction of E-cadherin was dose dependent and paralleled loss of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin. E-cadherin levels increased 2 hours after addition of Cyt D in cells showing an E-cadherin mRNA response but only after 10-12 hours in HT-1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 cells in which E-cadherin mRNA level were only minimally affected by Cyt D. Cyt D treatment induced the nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of EMT-associated SNAI 1 and SMAD1/2/3 transcription factors. In non-metastatic MCF-7 breast cancer cells, that express E-cadherin and represent a cancer cell model for EMT, actin depolymerization with Cyt D induced elevated E-cadherin while actin stabilization with Jasplakinolide reduced E-cadherin levels. Elevated E-cadherin levels due to Cyt D were associated with reduced activation of Rho A. Expression of dominant-negative Rho A mutant increased and dominant-active Rho A mutant decreased E-cadherin levels and also prevented Cyt D induction of E-cadherin. Reduced Rho A activation downstream of actin remodelling therefore induces E-cadherin and reverses EMT in cancer cells. Cyt D treatment inhibited migration and, at higher concentrations, induced cytotoxicity of both HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells and normal Hs27 fibroblasts, but only induced mesenchymal-epithelial transition in HT-1080 cancer cells. Our studies suggest that actin remodelling is an upstream regulator of EMT in metastatic cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2156455154,"Habituation represents a fundamental form of learning, yet the underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are not well defined. Here we report on a genome-wide genetic screen, coupled with whole-genome sequencing, that identified 14 zebrafish startle habituation mutants including mutants of the vertebrate-specific gene pregnancy-associated plasma protein-aa (pappaa). PAPP-AA encodes an extracellular metalloprotease known to increase IGF bioavailability, thereby enhancing IGF receptor signaling. We find that pappaa is expressed by startle circuit neurons, and expression of wild-type but not a metalloprotease-inactive version of pappaa restores habituation in pappaa mutants. Furthermore, acutely inhibiting IGF1R function in wild-type reduces habituation, while activation of IGF1R downstream effectors in pappaa mutants restores habituation, demonstrating that pappaa promotes learning by acutely and locally increasing IGF bioavailability. In sum, our results define the first functional gene set for habituation learning in a vertebrate and identify PAPPAA-regulated IGF signaling as a novel mechanism regulating habituation learning."
https://openalex.org/W1992575481,"Collapse of endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling in the amygdala contributes to stress-induced anxiety, but the mechanisms of this effect remain unclear. eCB production is tied to the function of the glutamate receptor mGluR5, itself dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation. Herein, we identify a novel pathway linking eCB regulation of anxiety through phosphorylation of mGluR5. Mice lacking LMO4, an endogenous inhibitor of the tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B, display reduced mGluR5 phosphorylation, eCB signaling, and profound anxiety that is reversed by genetic or pharmacological suppression of amygdalar PTP1B. Chronically stressed mice exhibited elevated plasma corticosterone, decreased LMO4 palmitoylation, elevated PTP1B activity, reduced amygdalar eCB levels, and anxiety behaviors that were restored by PTP1B inhibition or by glucocorticoid receptor antagonism. Consistently, corticosterone decreased palmitoylation of LMO4 and its inhibition of PTP1B in neuronal cells. Collectively, these data reveal a stress-responsive corticosterone-LMO4-PTP1B-mGluR5 cascade that impairs amygdalar eCB signaling and contributes to the development of anxiety."

Oligodendrocytes (OLs) produce and assemble the myelin sheath, which insulates axons in the CNS and facilitates saltatory conduction. Given their vital role in CNS physiology, loss of myelinating OLs can result in several neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS) in adults and cerebral palsy (CP) in children (Chang et al., 2002Chang A.

OLs have a robust capacity for regeneration (or remyelination), suggesting that endogenous cellular mechanisms can be employed for repair of white matter injury (WMI). However, areas of WMI in both adults and children are populated by “stalled” OL precursors (OLPs), suggesting that the molecular mechanisms governing OLP differentiation into OLs is suppressed by inhibitory signals within these lesions (Billiards et al., 2008Billiards S.S.

Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating OLP differentiation into OLs may reveal therapeutic strategies that stimulate remyelination after WMI. A central tenet of regenerative biology is that restorative processes parallel those found in development. Among the key molecular processes that suppress OLP differentiation during development and after WMI is Wnt signaling. Chronic activation of canonical Wnt signaling in OLPs results in delayed developmental and regenerative myelination (Emery, 2010Emery B.

These functional studies, coupled with elevated expression of key pathway components in OLP populations in human WMI, suggest that Wnt signaling is a crucial regulatory node that is dysregulated after WMI and a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Fancy et al., 2011Fancy S.P.

Studies on Wnt signaling have focused on how key distal transcriptional effectors of this pathway regulate OLP differentiation; however, the contributions of the proximal membrane and intracellular components that transduce these signals have not been examined in this context. One critical aspect of Wnt signal transduction is the clustering of Wnt receptor complexes into signalosomes, which are required for the initiation, amplification, and maintenance of Wnt signaling (Bilic et al., 2007Bilic J. Huang Y.L. Davidson G. Zimmermann T. Cruciat C.M. Bienz M. Niehrs C.

Wnt receptor signalosomes represent a potential therapeutic target because they function at the cell membrane and are therefore more accessible for pharmacological manipulation. In spite of these potential therapeutic attributes, the mechanisms that regulate Wnt receptor clustering and subsequent signalosome formation remain uncharacterized during OLP development and remyelination. A key step in signalosome formation is the aggregation and clustering of Frizzled/LRP/Dishevelled/Axin complexes, which facilitates amplification and maintenance of Wnt signaling (Bilic et al., 2007Bilic J. Huang Y.L. Davidson G. Zimmermann T. Cruciat C.M. Bienz M. Niehrs C.

Recently we found that Daam2 is required for canonical Wnt signaling during patterning in the dorsal spinal cord, functioning through the clustering and formation of Wnt receptor signalosomes (Lee and Deneen, 2012Lee H.K. Deneen B. Daam2 is required for dorsal patterning via modulation of canonical Wnt signaling in the developing spinal cord.Dev. Cell. 2012; 22: 183-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). At the biochemical level, Daam2 promotes the aggregation of Dishevelled (Dvl) complexes, which supports signalosome formation and potentiates Wnt activity. While these studies implicate Daam2 as a vital component of the Wnt receptor complex and provide a framework for understanding signalosome formation, the underlying mechanisms of Daam2 function remain poorly characterized. During gastrulation the PIP5K-Ptdlns(4,5)P2 (PIP2) pathway controls LRP5/6 phosphorylation and subsequent clustering of Wnt receptor complexes (Pan et al., 2008Pan W. Choi S.C. Wang H. Qin Y. Volpicelli-Daley L. Swan L. Lucast L. Khoo C. Zhang X. Li L. et al.Wnt3a-mediated formation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate regulates LRP6 phosphorylation.Science. 2008; 321: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Activation of PIP5K is regulated through its association with Dvl, in a Wnt3a-dependent manner (Qin et al., 2009Qin Y. Li L. Pan W. Wu D. Regulation of phosphatidylinositol kinases and metabolism by Wnt3a and Dvl.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22544-22548Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). That Daam2 synergizes with Wnt3a in the dorsal spinal cord and also associates with Dvl suggests a possible functional link with the PIP5K-PIP2 pathway during Wnt signalosome formation in the CNS (Lee and Deneen, 2012Lee H.K. Deneen B. Daam2 is required for dorsal patterning via modulation of canonical Wnt signaling in the developing spinal cord.Dev. Cell. 2012; 22: 183-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Importantly, a deeper mechanistic understanding of Wnt signalosome formation can potentially offer novel therapeutic insight into repair after WMI, as the role of Daam2 and its associated biology in OLP populations during development and after WMI remains completely undefined. Using this premise as our starting point, we show that Daam2 regulates canonical Wnt signaling and signalosome formation through the PIP5K-PIP2 axis. Examination of Daam2 function during OLP development revealed that it suppresses their differentiation into OLs. These developmental findings were subsequently applied to WMI, where we found that Daam2 is similarly expressed in OLPs in human white matter lesions and functions to suppress their differentiation in mouse models of WMI. Our mechanistic studies suggested that pharmacological inhibition of PIP5K function might be an approach to suppress the Wnt pathway in OLPs. Translation of these findings to our WMI models revealed that inhibition of PIP5K promotes OLP differentiation in vitro and remyelination during in vivo regeneration. Together, these data identify a novel mechanism that regulates Wnt signaling in OLPs and point to a potentially new therapeutic approach for stimulating myelin repair after WMI. Previous studies have linked PIP2 production to Wnt signalosome formation (Pan et al., 2008Pan W. Choi S.C. Wang H. Qin Y. Volpicelli-Daley L. Swan L. Lucast L. Khoo C. Zhang X. Li L. et al.Wnt3a-mediated formation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate regulates LRP6 phosphorylation.Science. 2008; 321: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Given that Daam2 regulates signalosome formation, we assessed whether it regulates PIP2 activity in chick spinal cord by co-electroporating Daam2-shRNAi (or mutant shRNAi control) with a PLCδ-PH-GFP reporter, which binds PIP2 and reports its intracellular localization (Balla and Várnai, 2002Balla T. Várnai P. Visualizing cellular phosphoinositide pools with GFP-fused protein-modules.Sci. STKE. 2002; 2002: pl3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that knockdown of Daam2 results in decreased membrane localization of the reporter (Figures 1A and 1B versus 1C–1E). In parallel, we performed a PIP2 ELISA assay on these chick spinal cords and found a drastic decrease in PIP2 production in the presence of the Daam2-shRNAi (Gray et al., 2003Gray A. Olsson H. Batty I.H. Priganica L. Peter Downes C.

Further biochemical analysis of these interrelationships using in vitro lipid binding assays (Heo et al., 2006Heo W.D. Inoue T. Park W.S. Kim M.L. Park B.O. Wandless T.J. Meyer T. PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(4,5)P2 lipids target proteins with polybasic clusters to the plasma membrane.Science. 2006; 314: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) indicates that Daam2 does not directly associate with PIP2 (Figures S1A–S1F), suggesting an indirect regulatory relationship. The production of PIP2 is regulated by PIP5K (van den Bout and Divecha, 2009van den Bout I. Divecha N. PIP5K-driven PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis: regulation and cellular functions.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 3837-3850Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that Daam2 regulates PIP2 production, and Wnt signaling, through PIP5K. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether PIP5K overexpression rescues dorsal patterning and canonical Wnt signaling in the absence of Daam2. As indicated in Figure 1, co-electroporation of PIP5K with the Daam2-shRNAi restored canonical Wnt activity and dorsal patterning in the developing spinal cord (Figures 1G–1P). Moreover, ELISA assay analysis shows that PIP5K rescued PIP2 production, further correlating Daam2-dependent Wnt activity to PIP2 production (Figure 1Q). To confirm the role of PIP5K in Wnt signaling, we performed shRNAi knockdown in chick and found a loss of dorsal patterning and Wnt signaling, phenotypes that parallel knockdown of Daam2 (Figures S1G–S1U). To establish the functional relationship between Daam2 and PIP5K during Wnt signalosome formation we used in vitro clustering assays (Bilic et al., 2007Bilic J. Huang Y.L. Davidson G. Zimmermann T. Cruciat C.M. Bienz M. Niehrs C. Wnt induces LRP6 signalosomes and promotes dishevelled-dependent LRP6 phosphorylation.Science. 2007; 316: 1619-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, Lee and Deneen, 2012Lee H.K. Deneen B. Daam2 is required for dorsal patterning via modulation of canonical Wnt signaling in the developing spinal cord.Dev. Cell. 2012; 22: 183-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). siRNA knockdown of PIP5K completely blocked the clustering of Wnt receptor complexes mediated by Daam2, reinforcing their cooperative relationship during the construction of Wnt receptor complexes at the cellular level (Figures 1R–1Y; see Figures S1V and S1W). Further examination into their relationship revealed that Daam2 and PIP5K co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) and subsequent GST pull-down studies confirmed that they directly interact (Figures 2A and 2B). Investigation into the nature of the biochemical relationship between Daam2 and PIP5K revealed that the Daam2-GBD domain and the N-terminal region of PIP5K are required for their associations (Figure 2C, lane 2; Figure 2D, lane 3). These results suggest that the N-terminal region of PIP5K is required for its function toward Wnt signaling. To test this, we performed rescue analysis of Daam2-shRNAi with the PIP5K mutants in the chick spinal cord, finding that the PIP5K mutants lacking either the N terminus (ΔN) or the kinase domain (ΔKD) do not rescue Wnt signaling or dorsal patterning, while the C-terminal deletion (ΔC) does (Figures 2E–2R). These data indicate that the kinase and the N-terminal domains of PIP5K are required for its function in this context. Another key finding from our biochemical studies is that the Daam2-GBD domain is required for its interaction with PIP5K (Figure 2C, lane 2). Importantly, the GBD domain is essential for interactions with Rho-GTPases, which also associate with Daam2 (Figure S1Y). These observations, put together with previous studies demonstrating that Sp-8-pCPT-cAMPs (cAMP) inhibit PIP5K activity through Rho signaling (Yang et al., 2004Yang S.A. Carpenter C.L. Abrams C.S. Rho and Rho-kinase mediate thrombin-induced phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase trafficking in platelets.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42331-42336Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggest an approach for inhibiting Daam2/PIP5K function. To examine whether this pharmacological approach similarly suppresses Wnt signaling in the spinal cord, we cultured chick spinal cord explants (see Figure 2S) with Sp-8-pCPT-cAMPs. Analysis revealed a selective loss of dorsal markers and canonical Wnt signaling, which is likely due to reduced PIP5K activity, as PIP2 production is also drastically reduced (Figures 2T–2Z). Finally, treatment with Sp-8-pCPT-cAMPs blocked Daam2-mediated Wnt receptor clustering (Figures 1Z–1EE and S1X). Collectively, these data indicate that Daam2 regulates Wnt signaling through PIP5K-PIP2 and suggest that inhibition of this pathway suppresses Wnt signaling in the developing CNS. To investigate a potential role for Daam2 in glial populations we characterized its expression patterns during gliogenesis in the developing and post-natal spinal cord. To determine the extent of its expression in the OL and astrocyte lineages, we assessed its co-expression with markers of these glial lineages in the developing spinal cord of a Daam2LacZ/+ mouse we recently generated (Figure S2; see Supplemental Information). Analysis of Daam2 expression at E18.5 revealed co-localization with Olig2 in OLPs and GLAST in astrocyte precursors (ASPs) (Figures 3A and 3B). Daam2 expression was also detected in OL and astrocyte populations (Figures 3C and 3D). These findings were corroborated by double in situ hybridization (Figures S3A–S3H). Analysis in the adult spinal cord revealed similar expression patterns (Figures 3E–3H). These data indicate that Daam2 is expressed in both OL and astrocyte lineages in the embryonic and adult spinal cord. That Wnt signaling plays a vital role in suppressing OLP differentiation, and Daam2 is a key regulator of Wnt signaling, raises the possibility that Daam2 may regulate OLP differentiation. To test this, we overexpressed Daam2 in the embryonic chick spinal cord and found a reduction in the number of MBP- and PLP-expressing cells at E11 (Figures 3I, 3K, and 3O; see Figures S3Z–S3CC for high-magnification images). Importantly, this was coupled with no change in the number of OLPs or ASPs, indicating the suppression of OL differentiation by Daam2 is not due to a loss of OLP populations or interconversion of glial sub-lineages (Figures 3L–3N and 3P). Next, we assessed OL differentiation in the spinal cord of Daam2 knockout mice (see Figure S2), finding that loss of Daam2 results in the precocious differentiation of MBP- and PLP-expressing OLs at P0 (Figures 4A and 4B versus 4D, 4E, 4G, and 4H; see Figures S3DD–S3GG for high-magnification images). This effect is not secondary to changes in the constituency of other glial lineages, as there were no differences in the number of OLPs (Figure 4C versus 4F and 4I) or astrocytes between Daam2+/− and Daam2−/− mice (Figures S4A and S4B). Subsequent analysis at later post-natal time points revealed that the levels of MBP and PLP expression were comparable between the Daam2+/− and Daam2−/−, indicating that Daam2 is required for the proper timing of OLP differentiation (Figures S4C–S4J). To confirm that loss of Daam2 accelerates OLP differentiation, we generated OLP cultures from Daam2+/− and Daam2−/− embryos. A total of 3 days after induction of differentiation, we found a drastic increase in the number of MBP- and PLP-expressing cells in the Daam2-knockout cultures (Figures 4J and 4K versus 4M, 4N, 4P, and 4Q), with no effect on the expression of OLP markers (Figure 4L versus 4O and 4R). Consistent with a role in the timing of differentiation, a similar, albeit less drastic, enhancement of OLP differentiation was witnessed 7 days post-differentiation (Figures S4K–S4P). Together, these gain- and loss-of-function studies indicate that Daam2 suppresses OLP maturation by regulating the time course of their maturation into MBP- and PLP-expressing OLs. Having established that Daam2 regulates Wnt signaling through the PIP5K-PIP2 axis (see Figures 1 and 2), we next examined whether Daam2 functions through this mechanism to suppress OLP differentiation. Using double in situ hybridization, we found that Daam2 and PIP5K are co-expressed in the post-natal spinal cord, and that PIP5K is similarly expressed in OLP populations in the spinal cord (Figure S3). To determine whether PIP2 production is dysregulated in the absence of Daam2, we transfected OLPs generated from Daam2+/− and Daam2−/− embryos with the PLCδ-PH-GFP reporter, finding reduced membrane localization, coupled with diffuse, cytosolic distribution of the reporter in the absence of Daam2 (Figures 4S and 4T versus 4U and 4V). This effect is consistent with reduced membrane production of PIP2 and parallels our results in the chick spinal cord. Given the link between PIP2 production and Wnt signaling (Figure 1) (Pan et al., 2008Pan W. Choi S.C. Wang H. Qin Y. Volpicelli-Daley L. Swan L. Lucast L. Khoo C. Zhang X.

Chem. 2009; 284: 22544-22548Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we sought to correlate these changes in OLP differentiation and membrane production of PIP2 to Wnt activity. To this end we measured Wnt activity in Daam2+/− and Daam2−/− OLPs by transfecting them with the TOP-nRFP Wnt reporter (Lee and Deneen, 2012Lee H.K. Deneen B. Daam2 is required for dorsal patterning via modulation of canonical Wnt signaling in the developing spinal cord.Dev. Cell. 2012; 22: 183-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis revealed a significant reduction in the number of cells reporting Wnt activity in Daam2−/− OLP populations (Figure 4T versus 4V and 4X). These results parallel those found during patterning of the embryonic spinal cord (see Figure 1) and suggest a direct mechanistic link between the Daam2-PIP2 axis and Wnt signaling in OLPs. To extend this model and establish a direct link between Daam2 and PIP2 in OLPs we next determined whether Daam2 suppresses OLP differentiation through PIP5K by examining whether overexpression of PIP5K in Daam2−/− OLP populations is sufficient to block accelerated OLP differentiation. Toward this, Daam2−/− OLPs were infected with lentivirus containing Cherry or PIP5K and harvested at 3 and 7 days after the induction of differentiation. Analysis of OL differentiation revealed that PIP5K overexpression blocked the precocious and enhanced appearance of MBP- and PLP-expressing cells in Daam2−/− OLPs (Figures S4Q–S4U). These effects of PIP5K were not due to a loss of OLP populations, as the number of Olig2-expressing cells was unchanged, and indicates that Daam2 function during OLP differentiation is mediated in part through PIP5K and, again, parallels our observations from the chick spinal cord (Figure 1). That Daam2 signals through the PIP5K-PIP2 axis during OLP differentiation suggests that inhibition of this signaling axis may similarly promote OLP maturation. To test this possibility, we generated OLPs from embryonic spinal cord and added Sp-8-pCPT-cAMPs after induction of differentiation. Analysis at 3 and 7 days post-differentiation revealed precocious and enhanced OL differentiation, marked by expression of MBP, coupled with no changes in the number of OLPs (Figures 4Y–4CC). These findings suggest that Daam2 functions through PIP5K and implicate PIP5K-PIP2 signaling in the suppression of OLP differentiation. Our foregoing data describing the ability of Daam2 to suppress OLP differentiation in developmental systems led us to investigate whether it has a similar function during remyelination after WMI in the adult spinal cord. Toward this objective, we examined Daam2 expression and function in a lysolecithin model of WMI, a well-established gliotoxic injury model that allows for the precise evaluation of remyelination repair kinetics (Figure S5A) (Fancy et al., 2009Fancy S.P. Baranzini S.E. Zhao C. Yuk D.I. Irvine K.A. Kaing S. Sanai N. Franklin R.J. Rowitch D.H. Dysregulation of the Wnt pathway inhibits timely myelination and remyelination in the mammalian CNS.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1571-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Using the Daam2-LacZ mouse, we performed lysolecithin lesioning on adult spinal cord, finding that Daam2 is indeed expressed in OLP populations at induced lesion sites (Figures 5A and 5B). To address whether Daam2 similarly suppresses OLP differentiation during remyelination, we next performed lysolecithin lesioning on Daam2+/− and Daam2−/− mice and analyzed the extent of OLP differentiation at 7 days post lesion (dpl), a time point that precedes normal remyelination and is devoid of mature OL populations (Figures 5C and S5). Analysis of OLP differentiation in Daam2 knockout mice revealed a 5-fold increase in the number of MBP- and PLP-expressing cells compared to heterozygote controls (Figures 5E and 5F versus 5I, 5J, and 5T), without any effect on the number of Olig2-expressing cells (Figures 5G, 5K, and 5U). Additionally, the reactive astrocyte and inflammatory responses are unaffected by the loss of Daam2 (Figures S5B–S5E). These data indicate that Daam2 suppresses OLP differentiation after WMI. Next we performed the complementary gain-of-function experiments in the lesioned spinal cord. For this, the spinal cords of wild-type mice were subjected to lysolecithin lesioning and followed by a secondary injection of lentivirus containing GFP or Daam2-IRES-GFP at 3 dpl, during the height of OLP recruitment to the lesion (Figure 5C, bottom). Because we anticipated that Daam2 overexpression would suppress OLP differentiation, we evaluated lesions at 12 dpl, a time point where a significant number of OLPs have differentiated into OLs. As expected, the GFP control showed extensive OL differentiation (Figures 5M and 5N), while the lesions injected with the Daam2-containig virus exhibited a drastic decrease in the number of MBP- and PLP-expressing OLs (Figures 5Q, 5R, and 5V). This decrease in OL differentiation was not the result of diminished OLPs or changes in the reactive astrocyte response, since the number of Olig2- and GFAP-expressing cells was not affected by Daam2 overexpression (Figures 5O, 5S, 5W, and S5F–S5I). Together these studies indicate that Daam2 suppresses OLP differentiation after WMI and, in con"

Dunbar (PI 552538) and wild G. soja (PI 326582A) exhibited significant differences in root architecture and root-related traits. In this study, phenotypic variability for root traits among 251 BC2F5 backcross inbred lines (BILs) developed from the cross Dunbar/PI 326582A were identified. The root systems of the parents and BILs were evaluated in controlled environmental conditions using a cone system at seedling stage. The G. max parent Dunbar contributed phenotypically favorable alleles at a major quantitative trait locus on chromosome 8 (Satt315-I locus) that governed root traits (tap root length and lateral root number) and shoot length. This QTL accounted for >10% of the phenotypic variation of both tap root and shoot length. This QTL region was found to control various shoot- and root-related traits across soybean genetic backgrounds. Within the confidence interval of this region, eleven transcription factors (TFs) were identified. Based on RNA sequencing and Affymetrix expression data, key TFs including MYB, AP2-EREBP and bZIP TFs were identified in this QTL interval with high expression in roots and nodules. The backcross inbred lines with different parental allelic combination showed different expression pattern for six transcription factors selected based on their expression pattern in root tissues. It appears that the marker interval Satt315–I locus on chromosome 8 contain an essential QTL contributing to early root and shoot growth in soybean."

The structure and morphology were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD). Photoluminescence (PL) properties of un-doped and Al-doped ZnO showed significant changes in the optical properties providing evidence for several types of defects such as zinc interstitials (Zni), oxygen interstitials (Oi), zinc vacancy (Vzn), singly charged zinc vacancy (VZn-), oxygen vacancy (Vo), singly charged oxygen vacancy (Vo+) and oxygen anti-site defects (OZn) in the grown NSs. The Al-doped ZnO NSs have exhibited shifted PL peaks at near band edge (NBE) and red luminescence compared to the un-doped ZnO. The Raman scattering results provided evidence of Al doping into the ZnO NSs due to peak shift from 145 cm-1 to an anomalous peak at 138 cm-1. Presence of enhanced Raman signal at around 274 and 743 cm-1 further confirmed Al in ZnO NSs. The enhanced D and G band in all Al-doped ZnO NSs shows possible functionalization and doping process in ZnO NSs."

If food intake is not adjusted to meet the changing energy demands associated with changes of ambient temperature, a serious challenge to body energy stores can occur. To more fully understand the coupling of thermoregulation to energy homeostasis in normal animals and to investigate the role of the adipose hormone leptin to this process, comprehensive measures of energy homeostasis and core temperature were obtained in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice and their wild-type (WT) littermate controls when housed under cool (14°C), usual (22°C) or ∼ thermoneutral (30°C) conditions. Our findings extend previous evidence that WT mice robustly defend normothermia in response to either a lowering (14°C) or an increase (30°C) of ambient temperature without changes in body weight or body composition. In contrast, leptin-deficient, ob/ob mice fail to defend normothermia at ambient temperatures lower than thermoneutrality and exhibit marked losses of both body fat and lean mass when exposed to cooler environments (14°C). Our findings further demonstrate a strong inverse relationship between ambient temperature and energy expenditure in WT mice, a relationship that is preserved in ob/ob mice. However, thermal conductance analysis indicates defective heat retention in ob/ob mice, irrespective of temperature. While a negative relationship between ambient temperature and energy intake also exists in WT mice, this relationship is disrupted in ob/ob mice. Thus, to meet the thermoregulatory demands of different ambient temperatures, leptin signaling is required for adaptive changes in both energy intake and thermal conductance. A better understanding of the mechanisms coupling thermoregulation to energy homeostasis may lead to the development of new approaches for the treatment of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2171405997,"We studied potential links between environmental factors, nitrous oxide (N2O) accumulation, and genetic indicators of nitrite and N2O reducing bacteria in 12 boreal lakes. Denitrifying bacteria were investigated by quantifying genes encoding nitrite and N2O reductases (nirS/nirK and nosZ, respectively, including the two phylogenetically distinct clades nosZI and nosZII) in lake sediments. Summertime N2O accumulation and hypolimnetic nitrate concentrations were positively correlated both at the inter-lake scale and within a depth transect of an individual lake (Lake Vanajavesi). The variability in the individual nirS, nirK, nosZI, and nosZII gene abundances was high (up to tenfold) among the lakes, which allowed us to study the expected links between the ecosystem’s nir-vs-nos gene inventories and N2O accumulation. Inter-lake variation in N2O accumulation was indeed connected to the relative abundance of nitrite versus N2O reductase genes, i.e. the (nirS+nirK)/nosZI gene ratio. In addition, the ratios of (nirS+nirK)/nosZI at the inter-lake scale and (nirS+nirK)/nosZI+II within Lake Vanajavesi correlated positively with nitrate availability. The results suggest that ambient nitrate concentration can be an important modulator of the N2O accumulation in lake ecosystems, either directly by increasing the overall rate of denitrification or indirectly by controlling the balance of nitrite versus N2O reductase carrying organisms."

We examined the relationship between phospholipid composition of mammary epithelial cells and the size of both intracellular and secreted milk fat globules. Primary culture of mammary epithelial cells was cultured in medium without free fatty acids (control) or with 0.1 mM free capric, palmitic or oleic acid for 24 h. The amount and composition of the cellular lipids and the size of the lipid droplets were determined in the cells and medium. Mitochondrial quantity and expression levels of genes associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and polar lipid composition were determined. Cells cultured with oleic and palmitic acids contained similar quantities of triglycerides, 3.1- and 3.8-fold higher than in controls, respectively (P < 0.0001). When cultured with oleic acid, 22% of the cells contained large lipid droplets (>3 μm) and phosphatidylethanolamine concentration was higher by 23 and 63% compared with that in the control and palmitic acid treatments, respectively (P < 0.0001). In the presence of palmitic acid, only 4% of the cells contained large lipid droplets and the membrane phosphatidylcholine concentration was 22% and 16% higher than that in the control and oleic acid treatments, respectively (P < 0.0001). In the oleic acid treatment, approximately 40% of the lipid droplets were larger than 5 μm whereas in that of the palmitic acid treatment, only 16% of the droplets were in this size range. Triglyceride secretion in the oleic acid treatment was 2- and 12-fold higher compared with that in the palmitic acid and control treatments, respectively. Results imply that membrane composition of bovine mammary epithelial cells plays a role in controlling intracellular and secreted lipid droplets size, and that this process is not associated with cellular triglyceride content."
https://openalex.org/W2013343698,"Background Mitochondria are critical to cardiac injury during reperfusion as a result of damage sustained during ischemia, including the loss of bcl-2. We asked if bcl-2 depletion not only leads to selective permeation of the outer mitochondrial membrane (MOMP) favoring cytochrome c release and programmed cell death, but also favors opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). An increase in MPTP susceptibility would support a role for bcl-2 depletion mediated cell death in the calcium overload setting of early reperfusion via MPTP as well as later in reperfusion via MOMP as myocardial calcium content normalizes. Methods Calcium retention capacity (CRC) was used to reflect the sensitivity of the MPTP opening in isolated cardiac mitochondria. To study the relationship between bcl-2 inhibition and MPTP opening, mitochondria were incubated with a bcl-2 inhibitor (HA14-1) and CRC measured. The contribution of preserved bcl-2 content to MPTP opening following ischemia-reperfusion was explored using transgenic bcl-2 overexpressed mice. Results CRC was decreased in mitochondria following reperfusion compared to ischemia alone, indicating that reperfusion further sensitizes to MPTP opening. Incubation of ischemia-damaged mitochondria with increasing HA14-1concentrations increased calcium-stimulated MPTP opening, supporting that functional inhibition of bcl-2 during simulated reperfusion favors MPTP opening. Moreover, HA14-1 sensitivity was increased by ischemia compared to non-ischemic controls. Overexpression of bcl-2 attenuated MPTP opening in following ischemia-reperfusion. HA14-1 inhibition also increased the permeability of the outer membrane in the absence of exogenous calcium, indicating that bcl-2 inhibition favors MOMP when calcium is low. Conclusions The depletion and functional inhibition of bcl-2 contributes to cardiac injury by increasing susceptibility to MPTP opening in high calcium environments and MOMP in the absence of calcium overload. Thus, ischemia-damaged mitochondria with decreased bcl-2 content are susceptible to MPTP opening in early reperfusion and MOMP later in reperfusion when cytosolic calcium has normalized."

Texture analysis is a powerful quantitative approach for analyzing voxel intensities and their interrelationships, but has been thus far limited to analyzing regions of interest. The proposed method provides a 3D statistical map comparing texture features on a voxel-by-voxel basis. The validity of the method was examined on artificially generated effects as well as on real MRI data in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The artificially generated effects included hyperintense and hypointense signals added to T1-weighted brain MRIs from 30 healthy subjects. The AD dataset included 30 patients with AD and 30 age/sex matched healthy control subjects. The proposed method detected artificial effects with high accuracy and revealed statistically significant differences between the AD and control groups. This paper extends the usage of texture analysis beyond the current region of interest analysis to voxel-by-voxel 3D statistical mapping and provides a hypothesis-free analysis tool to study cerebral pathology in neurological diseases."

Our results indicate the salience of both peer selection and peer influence effects for friendship tie choice and adolescent drinking behavior. Concurrently, the main effect models indicate that parental monitoring and the parental home drinking environment affected adolescent alcohol use in the small school sample, and that parental home drinking environment affected adolescent drinking in the large school sample. In the small school sample, we detect an interaction between the parental home drinking environment and choosing friends that drink as they multiplicatively affect friendship tie choice. Our findings suggest that future research should investigate the synergistic effects of both peer and parental influences for adolescent friendship tie choices and drinking behavior. And given the tendency of adolescents to form ties with their friends' friends, and the evidence of local hierarchy in these networks, popular youth who do not drink may be uniquely positioned and uniquely salient as the highest rank of the hierarchy to cause anti-drinking peer influences to diffuse down the social hierarchy to less popular youth. As such, future interventions should harness prosocial peer influences simultaneously with strategies to increase parental support and monitoring among parents to promote affiliation with prosocial peers."
https://openalex.org/W2001506606,"Purpose Harmful alcohol consumption among the ageing population is an important public health issue. Very few studies ask drinkers why they change their consumption in later life. The aim of this paper was to determine whether a group of people aged over 60 years increased or decreased their alcohol consumption over the past decade and to determine the reasons for their change. We also examined whether the responses varied by age, sex and socio-economic position (SEP). Subjects and Methods Data were taken from 6,011 participants (4,310 men, 1,701 women, age range 61 to 85 years) who completed questionnaires at phase 11 (2012-2013) of the Whitehall II Cohort Study. Results Over half the study members reported a change in alcohol consumption over the past decade (40% decreased, 11% increased). The most common reasons given for decreases were as a health precaution and fewer social occasions. Common reasons for increases were more social occasions and fewer responsibilities. The lowest SEP group was less likely to increase consumption compared to high SEP (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.81). Women were more likely to increase consumption in response to stress/depression than men (RR1.53, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.25). Compared to high SEP, the lowest SEP group was less likely to reduce as a health precaution (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.76). Conclusions Alcohol consumption in late life is not fixed. Reasons for change vary by age, sex and SEP. Such information could be used to tailor intervention strategies to reduce harmful consumption."

To determine the cytotoxicity of oleanolic acid, HEp-2 cells were incubated with oleanolic acid at 37oC. MICs (minimal inhibition concentrations) for L. monocytogenes, E. faecium, and E. faecalis were determined using two-fold microdilutions of oleanolic acid, and bacterial cell viability was then assessed by exposing the bacteria to oleanolic acid at 2 × MIC. To investigate the mode of antimicrobial action of oleanolic acid, we measured leakage of compounds absorbing at 280 nm, along with propidium iodide uptake. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were also analysed. The viability of HEp-2 cells decreased (P < 0.05) at oleanolic acid concentrations greater than 128 μg mL-1. The MICs were 16-32 μg mL-1 for L. monocytogenes and 32-64 μg mL-1 for E. faecium and E. faecalis, and bacterial cell viability decreased (P < 0.05) about 3-4 log CFU mL-1 after exposure to 2 × MIC of oleanolic acid. Leakage of 280 nm absorbing materials and propidium iodide uptake was higher in oleanolic acid –treated cells than in the control. The cell membrane was damaged in oleanolic acid-treated cells, but the control group had intact cell membrane in SEM images. The results indicate that oleanolic acid can kill L. monocytogenes, E. faecium, and E. faecalis by destroying the bacterial cell membrane."

Unfortunately, little is known about the in vivo production of soluble IL-15Rα/IL-15 complexes (sIL-15 complexes), particularly regarding the circumstances that induce them and the mechanisms responsible. The main objective of this study was to elucidate the signals leading to the generation of sIL-15 complexes. In this study, we show that sIL-15 complexes are increased in the serum of mice in response to Interferon (IFN)-α. In bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC), IFN-α increased the activity of ADAM17, a metalloproteinase implicated in cleaving IL-15 complexes from the cell surface. Moreover, knocking out ADAM17 in BMDCs prevented the ability of IFN-α to induce sIL-15 complexes demonstrating ADAM17 as a critical protease mediating cleavage of IL-15 complexes in response to type I IFNs. Type I IFN signaling was required for generating sIL-15 complexes as in vivo induction of sIL-15 complexes by Poly I:C stimulation or total body irradiation (TBI) was impaired in IFNAR-/- mice. Interestingly, serum sIL-15 complexes were also induced in mice infected with Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or mice treated with agonistic CD40 antibodies; however, sIL-15 complexes were still induced in IFNAR-/- mice after VSV infection or CD40 stimulation indicating pathways other than type I IFNs induce sIL-15 complexes. Overall, this study has shown that type I IFNs, VSV infection, and CD40 stimulation induce sIL-15 complexes suggesting the generation of sIL-15 complexes is a common event associated with immune activation. These findings reveal an unrealized mechanism for enhanced immune responses occurring during infection, vaccination, inflammation, and autoimmunity."

Most taxa of the subfamily occur in eastern Asia and Mexico but the monospecific genus Linnaea has a circumboreal to north temperate distribution. In this study, we conducted phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses for Linnaeoideae and its close relatives based on sequences of the nuclear ribosomal ITS and nine plastid (rbcL, trnS-G, matK, trnL-F, ndhA, trnD-psbM, petB-D, trnL-rpl32 and trnH-psbA) markers. Our results support that Linnaeoideae is monophyletic, consisting of four eastern Asian lineages (Abelia, Diabelia, Dipelta and Kolkwitzia), the Mexican Vesalea, and Linnaea. The Mexican Vesalea was formerly placed in Abelia, but it did not form a clade with the eastern Asian Abelia; instead Vesalea and Linnaea are sisters. The divergence time between the eastern Asian lineages and the Mexican Vesalea plus the Linnaea clade was dated to be 50.86 Ma, with a 95% highest posterior density of 42.8 Ma (middle Eocene) to 60.19 Ma (early Paleocene) using the Bayesian relaxed clock estimation. Reconstructed ancestral areas indicated that the common ancestor of Linnaea plus Vesalea may have been widespread in eastern Asia and Mexico or originated in eastern Asia during the Eocene and likely migrated across continents in the Northern Hemisphere via the North Atlantic Land Bridges or the Bering Land Bridge. The Qinling Mountains of eastern Asia are the modern-day center of diversity of Kolkwitzia-Dipelta-Diabelia clade. The Diabeliaclade became highly diversified in Japan and eastern China.

https://openalex.org/W2037177018,"Swelling-activated pathways for myo-inositol, one of the most abundant organic osmolytes in mammalian cells, have not yet been identified. The present study explores the SLC5A3 protein as a possible transporter of myo-inositol in hyponically swollen HEK293 cells. To address this issue, we examined the relationship between the hypotonicity-induced changes in plasma membrane permeability to myo-inositol Pino [m/s] and expression/localization of SLC5A3. Pino values were determined by cell volumetry over a wide tonicity range (100–275 mOsm) in myo-inositol-substituted solutions. While being negligible under mild hypotonicity (200–275 mOsm), Pino grew rapidly at osmolalities below 200 mOsm to reach a maximum of ∼3 nm/s at 100–125 mOsm, as indicated by fast cell swelling due to myo-inositol influx. The increase in Pino resulted most likely from the hypotonicity-mediated incorporation of cytosolic SLC5A3 into the plasma membrane, as revealed by confocal fluorescence microscopy of cells expressing EGFP-tagged SLC5A3 and super-resolution imaging of immunostained SLC5A3 by direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). dSTORM in hypotonic cells revealed a surface density of membrane-associated SLC5A3 proteins of 200–2000 localizations/μm2. Assuming SLC5A3 to be the major path for myo-inositol, a turnover rate of 80–800 myo-inositol molecules per second for a single transporter protein was estimated from combined volumetric and dSTORM data. Hypotonic stress also caused a significant upregulation of SLC5A3 gene expression as detected by semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. In summary, our data provide first evidence for swelling-mediated activation of SLC5A3 thus suggesting a functional role of this transporter in hypotonic volume regulation of mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2067485136,"Background Our previous in vitro studies have demonstrated dose-dependent effects of CXCR2 ligands on hepatocyte cell death and proliferation. In the current study, we sought to determine if CXCR2 ligand concentration is responsible for the divergent effects of these mediators on liver regeneration after ischemia/reperfusion injury and partial hepatectomy. Methods Murine models of partial ischemia/reperfusion injury and hepatectomy were used to study the effect of CXCR2 ligands on liver regeneration. Results We found that hepatic expression of the CXCR2 ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), was significantly increased after both I/R injury and partial hepatectomy. However, expression of these ligands after I/R injury was 30-100-fold greater than after hepatectomy. Interestingly, the same pattern of expression was found in ischemic versus non-ischemic liver lobes following I/R injury with expression significantly greater in the ischemic liver lobes. In both systems, lower ligand expression was associated with increased hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration in a CXCR2-dependent fashion. To confirm that these effects were related to ligand concentration, we administered exogenous MIP-2 and KC to mice undergoing partial hepatectomy. Mice received a “high” dose that replicated serum levels found after I/R injury and a “low” dose that was similar to that found after hepatectomy. Mice receiving the “high” dose had reduced levels of hepatocyte proliferation and regeneration whereas the “low” dose promoted hepatocyte proliferation and regeneration. Conclusions Together, these data demonstrate that concentrations of CXC chemokines regulate the hepatic proliferative response and subsequent liver regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2122827153,"Conventional cytostatic cancer treatments rarely result in the complete eradication of tumor cells. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies focus on antagonizing the immunosuppressive activity of established tumors. In particular, recent studies of antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DCs) eliciting a specific antitumor immune response has raised the hopes of achieving the complete elimination of tumor tissue. Genistein, fingolimod and betulin have already been described as active compounds in different types of cancer. Herein, we applied an integrated screening approach to characterize both their cytostatic and their immune-modulating properties side-by-side. As will be described in detail, our data confirmed that all three compounds exerted proapoptotic and antiproliferative activity in different B16 melanoma cell lines to a given extent, as revealed by an MTT assay, CFSE and DAPI staining. However, while genistein and fingolimod also affected the survival of primary bone marrow (BM) derived DCs of C57BL/6 mice, betulin exhibited a lower cytotoxicity for BMDCs in comparison to the melanoma cells. Moreover, we could show for the first time, that only betulin caused a simultaneous, highly specific immune-stimulating activity, as measured by the IL-12p70 release of Toll-like receptor 4-stimulated BMDCs by ELISA, which was due to increased IL-12p35 mRNA expression. Interestingly, the activation of DCs resulted in enhanced T lymphocyte stimulation, indicated by increased IL-2 and IFN-γ production of cytotoxic T cells in spleen cell co-culture assays which led to a decreased viability of B16 cells in an antigen specific model system. This may overcome the immunosuppressive environment of a tumor and destroy tumor cells more effectively in vivo if the immune response is specific targeted against the tumor tissue by antigen-loaded dendritic cells. In summary, cytostatic agents, such as betulin, that simultaneously exhibit immune stimulatory activity may serve as lead compounds and hold great promise as a novel approach for an integrated cancer therapy."

Although information concerning its genome and transcriptome has recently been reported, relatively little information is available for G. lucidum at the proteomic level. In this study, protein fractions from G. lucidum at three developmental stages (16-day mycelia, and fruiting bodies at 60 and 90 days) were prepared and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. A search against the G. lucidum genome database identified 803 proteins. Among these proteins, 61 lignocellulose degrading proteins were detected, most of which (49 proteins) were found in the 90-day fruiting bodies. Fourteen TCA-cycle related proteins, 17 peptidases, two argonaute-like proteins, and two immunomodulatory proteins were also detected. A majority (470) of the 803 proteins had GO annotations and were classified into 36 GO terms, with “binding”, “catalytic activity”, and “hydrolase activity” having high percentages. Additionally, 357 out of the 803 proteins were assigned to at least one COG functional category and grouped into 22 COG classifications. Based on the results from the proteomic and sequence alignment analyses, a potentially new immunomodulatory protein (GL18769) was expressed and shown to have high immunomodulatory activity. In this study, proteomic and biochemical analyses of G. lucidum were performed for the first time, revealing that proteins from this fungus can play significant bioactive roles and providing a new foundation for the further functional investigations that this fungus merits."
https://openalex.org/W2040247632,"Identifying signatures of selection can provide a straightforward insight into the mechanism of artificial selection and further uncover the causal genes related to the phenotypic variation. Based on Illumina Porcine60KSNP chip data, four complementary methods, Long-Range Haplotype (LRH), Tajima's D, Cross Population Extend Haplotype Homozygosity Test (XPEHH) and FST, were implemented in this study to detect the selection signatures in the whole genome of one typical Chinese indigenous breed, Rongchang, one Chinese cultivated breed, Songliao, and two western breeds, Landrace and Yorkshire. False Discovery Rate (FDR) was implemented to control the false positive rates. In our study, a total of 159, 127, 179 and 159 candidate selection regions with average length of 0.80 Mb, 0.73 Mb, 0.78 Mb and 0.73 Mb were identified in Landrace, Rongchang, Songliao and Yorkshire, respectively, that span approximately 128.00 Mb, 92.38 Mb, 130.30 Mb and 115.40 Mb and account for approximately 3.74-5.33% of genome across all autosomes. The selection regions of 11.52 Mb shared by Landrace and Yorkshire were the longest when chosen pairs from the pool of the four breeds were examined. The overlaps between Yorkshire and Songliao, approximately 9.20 Mb, were greater than those of Yorkshire and Rongchang. Meanwhile, the overlaps between Landrace and Songliao were greater than those of Landrace and Rongchang but less than those of Songliao and Ronchang. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the genes/QTLs relevant to fertility, coat color, and ear morphology were found in candidate selection regions. Some genes, such as LEMD3, MC1R, KIT, TRHR etc. that were reported under selection, were confirmed in our study, and this analysis also demonstrated the diversity of breeds."
https://openalex.org/W2055397316,"Background Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is a multifunctional scaffolding protein serving as a platform for the cell’s signal-transduction and playing an important role in inflammation. However, its role in inflammatory bowel disease is not clear. A recent study showed that Cav-1 is increased and mediates angiogenesis in dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis, which are contradictory to our pilot findings in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. In the present study, we further clarified the role of Cav-1 in TNBS-induced colitis. Methods In BALB/c mice, acute colitis was induced by intra-rectal administration of one dose TNBS, while chronic colitis was induced by administration of TNBS once a week for 7 weeks. To assess the effects of complete loss of Cav-1, Cav-1 knockout (Cav-1−/−) and control wild-type C57 mice received one TNBS administration. Body weight and clinical scores were monitored. Colon Cav-1 and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were quantified through ELISAs. Inflammation was evaluated through histological analysis. Results Colon Cav-1 levels were significantly decreased in TNBS-induced colitis mice when compared to normal mice and also inversely correlated with colon inflammation scores and proinflammatory cytokine levels (IL-17, IFN-γ and TNF) significantly. Furthermore, after administration of TNBS, Cav-1−/− mice showed significantly increased clinical and colon inflammatory scores and body weight loss when compared with control mice. Conclusions and Significance Cav-1 may play a protective role in the development of TNBS-induced colitis. Our findings raise an important issue in the evaluation of specific molecules in animal models that different models may exhibit opposite results because of the different mechanisms involved."
https://openalex.org/W2079788535,"The ability to survive stressful conditions is important for every living cell. Certain stresses not only affect the current well-being of cells but may also have far-reaching consequences. Uncurbed oxidative stress can cause DNA damage and decrease cell survival and/or increase mutation rates, and certain substances that generate oxidative damage in the cell mainly act on DNA. Radiomimetic zeocin causes oxidative damage in DNA, predominantly by inducing single- or double-strand breaks. Such lesions can lead to chromosomal rearrangements, especially in diploid cells, in which the two sets of chromosomes facilitate excessive and deleterious recombination. In a global screen for zeocin-oversensitive mutants, we selected 133 genes whose deletion reduces the survival of zeocin-treated diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. The screen revealed numerous genes associated with stress responses, DNA repair genes, cell cycle progression genes, and chromatin remodeling genes. Notably, the screen also demonstrated the involvement of the vesicular trafficking system in cellular protection against DNA damage. The analyses indicated the importance of vesicular system integrity in various pathways of cellular protection from zeocin-dependent damage, including detoxification and a direct or transitional role in genome maintenance processes that remains unclear. The data showed that deleting genes involved in vesicular trafficking may lead to Rad52 focus accumulation and changes in total DNA content or even cell ploidy alterations, and such deletions may preclude proper DNA repair after zeocin treatment. We postulate that functional vesicular transport is crucial for sustaining an integral genome. We believe that the identification of numerous new genes implicated in genome restoration after genotoxic oxidative stress combined with the detected link between vesicular trafficking and genome integrity will reveal novel molecular processes involved in genome stability in diploid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1989536694,"Arabidopsis CRINKLY4 (ACR4) is a receptor-like kinase (RLK) involved in the global development of the plant. The Arabidopsis genome encodes four homologs of ACR4 that contain sequence similarity and analogous architectural elements to ACR4, termed Arabidopsis CRINKLY4 Related (AtCRRs) proteins. Additionally, a signaling module has been previously proposed including a postulated peptide ligand, CLE40, the ACR4 RLK, and the WOX5 transcription factor that engage in a possible feedback mechanism controlling stem cell differentiation. However, little biochemical evidence is available to ascertain the molecular aspects of receptor heterodimerization and the role of phosphorylation in these interactions. Therefore, we have undertaken an investigation of the in vitro interactions between the intracellular domains (ICD) of ACR4, the CRRs and WOX5. We demonstrate that interaction can occur between ACR4 and all four CRRs in the unphosphorylated state. However, phosphorylation dependency is observed for the interaction between ACR4 and CRR3. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the ACR4 gene family has revealed a conserved 'KDSAF' motif that may be involved in protein-protein interactions among the receptor family. We demonstrate that peptides harboring this conserved motif in CRR3 and CRK1are able to bind to the ACR4 kinase domain. Our investigations also indicate that the ACR4 ICD can interact with and phosphorylate the transcription factor WOX5."
https://openalex.org/W2087607722,"Objective To examine the diagnostic performance of shorter versions of Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), including Alcohol Consumption (AUDIT-C), in identifying risky drinkers in primary care settings using conventional performance measures, supplemented by decision curve analysis and reclassification table. Study design and Setting A cross-sectional study of adult males in general outpatient clinics in Hong Kong. The study included only patients who reported at least sometimes drinking alcoholic beverages. Timeline follow back alcohol consumption assessment method was used as the reference standard. A Chinese translated and validated 10-item AUDIT (Ch-AUDIT) was used as a screening tool of risky drinking. Results Of the participants, 21.7% were classified as risky drinkers. AUDIT-C has the best overall performance among the shorter versions of Ch-AUDIT. The AUC of AUDIT-C was comparable to Ch-AUDIT (0.898 vs 0.901, p-value = 0.959). Decision curve analysis revealed that when the threshold probability ranged from 15–30%, the AUDIT-C had a higher net-benefit than all other screens. AUDIT-C improved the reclassification of risky drinking when compared to Ch-AUDIT (net reclassification improvement = 0.167). The optimal cut-off of AUDIT-C was at ≥5. Conclusion Given the rising levels of alcohol consumption in the Chinese regions, this Chinese translated 3-item instrument provides convenient and time-efficient risky drinking screening and may become an increasingly useful tool."
https://openalex.org/W2021121384,"Objectives Extreme endurance exercise is known to be associated with an enlargement of the left ventricular (LV) chamber, whereas inactivity results in inverse changes. It is unknown if these dimensional relationships exist in patients. Methods We analyzed the relationship of exercise capacity and LV dimension in a cohort of sequential patients with a normal ejection fraction undergoing stress echocardiography. In a total of 137 studies the following questions were addressed: (a) is there a difference in LV dimensions of patients with an excellent exercise capacity versus patients with a poor exercise capacity, (b) how is LV dimension and exercise capacity affected by LV wall thickness and (c) how do LV dimensions of patients who are unable to walk on a treadmill compare to the above groups. Results Patients with a poor exercise capacity or who are unable to physically exercise have a 34 percent smaller LV cavity size when compared to patients with an excellent exercise capacity (p<0.001). This reduction in LV chamber size is associated with concentric LV hypertrophy and a reciprocal increase in resting heart rate. In addition, cardiac output reserve is further blunted by chronotropic incompetence and a tachycardia-induced LV volume reduction. In conclusion the relationship of exercise capacity and cardiac dimensions described in extreme athletes also applies to patients. Our exploratory analysis suggests that patients who cannot sufficiently exercise have small LV cavities."
https://openalex.org/W1974002457,"Objective This study was conducted to estimate the cause-specific mortality in male emergency responders (ER), compare with that of Korean men. Mortality was also compared between more experienced firefighters (i.e., firefighters employed ≥20 years and firefighters employed ≥10 to <20 years) and less experienced firefighters and non-firefighters (i.e., firefighters employed <10 years and non-firefighters) to investigate associations between mortality and exposure to occupational hazards. Methods The cohort was comprised of 33,442 males who were employed as ERs between 1980 and 2007 and not deceased as of 1991. Work history was merged with the death registry from the National Statistical Office of Korea to follow-up on mortality between 1992 and 2007. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for ERs were calculated in reference to the Korean male population. Adjusted relative risks (ARRs) of mortalities for firefighters employed ≥20 years and ≥10 years to <20 years were calculated in reference to non-firefighters and firefighters employed < 10 years. Results Overall (SMR=0.43, 95%CI=0.39–0.47) and some kinds of cause-specific mortalities were significantly lower among ERs compared with the Korean male population. No significant increase in mortality was observed across the major ICD-10 classifications among ERs. Mortality due to exposure to smoke, fire, and flames (SMR=3.11, 95% CI=1.87–4.85), however, was significantly increased among ERs. All-cause mortality (ARR=1.46, 95% CI=1.13–1.89), overall cancer mortality (ARR=1.54, 95% CI=1.02–2.31) and mortality of external injury, poisoning and external causes (ARR=3.13, 95% CI=1.80–5.46) were significantly increased among firefighters employed ≥20 years compared to those of non-firefighters and firefighters employed < 10 years. Conclusions An increase in mortality due to all cancer and external injury, poisoning, and external causes in firefighters employed ≥20 years compared with non-firefighters and firefighters employed <10 years suggests occupational exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2025344021,"Nanoparticles are increasingly used to adjuvant vaccine formulations due to their biocompatibility, ease of manufacture and the opportunity to tailor their size, shape, and physicochemical properties. The efficacy of similarly-sized silica (Si-OH), poly (D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly caprolactone (PCL) nanoparticles (nps) to adjuvant recombinant capsomere presenting antigenic M2e modular peptide from Influenza A virus (CapM2e) was investigated in vivo. Formulation of CapM2e with Si-OH or PLGA nps significantly boosted the immunogenicity of modular capsomeres, even though CapM2e was not actively attached to the nanoparticles prior to injection (i.e., formulation was by simple mixing). In contrast, PCL nps showed no significant adjuvant effect using this simple-mixing approach. The immune response induced by CapM2e alone or formulated with nps was antibody-biased with very high antigen-specific antibody titer and less than 20 cells per million splenocytes secreting interferon gamma. Modification of silica nanoparticle surface properties through amine functionalization and pegylation did not lead to significant changes in immune response. This study confirms that simple mixing-based formulation can lead to effective adjuvanting of antigenic protein, though with antibody titer dependent on nanoparticle physicochemical properties."
https://openalex.org/W1988979754,"Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) belongs to a group of fatal, transmissible protein misfolding diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). All TSEs are caused by accumulation of misfolded prion protein (PrPSc) throughout the central nervous system (CNS), which results in neuronal loss and ultimately death. Like other protein misfolding diseases including Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, TSEs are generally not diagnosed until the onset of disease after the appearance of unequivocal clinical signs. As such, identification of the earliest clinical signs of disease may facilitate diagnosis. The retina is the most accessible part of the central nervous system, and retinal pathology in TSE affected animals has been previously reported. Here we describe antemortem changes in retinal function and morphology that are detectable in BSE inoculated animals several months (up to 11 months) prior to the appearance of any other signs of clinical disease. We also demonstrate that differences in the severity of these clinical signs reflect the amount of PrPSc accumulation in the retina and the resulting inflammatory response of the tissue. These results are the earliest reported clinical signs associated with TSE infection and provide a basis for understanding the pathology and evaluating therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2076553642,"Although many patients prefer to stay and die at home at the end of life, many are hospitalised. Little is known about how to avoid hospitalisations for patients living at home.To describe how hospitalisation at the end of life can be avoided, from the perspective of the GPs, nurses and family carers.A qualitative design with face-to-face interviews was used. Taking 30 cases of patients who died non-suddenly, 26 GPs, 15 nurses and 18 family carers were interviewed in depth. Of the 30 patients, 20 were hospitalised and 10 were not hospitalised in the last three months of life.Five key themes that could help avoid hospitalisation at the end of life emerged from the interviews. The key themes were: 1) marking the approach of death, and shifting the mindset; 2) being able to provide acute treatment and care at home; 3) anticipatory discussions and interventions to deal with expected severe problems; 4) guiding and monitoring the patient and family in a holistic way through the illness trajectory; 5) continuity of treatment and care at home. If these five key themes are adopted in an interrelated way, this could help avoid hospitalisations, according to GPs, nurses and family carers.The five key themes described in this study can be seen as strategies that could help in avoiding hospitalisation at the end of life. It is recommended that for all patients residing at home, GPs and community nurses work together as a team from the moment that it is marked that death is approaching up to the end of life."
https://openalex.org/W2026704233,"Background Leaf width is an important agricultural trait in maize. Leaf development is dependent on cell proliferation and expansion, and these processes exhibit polarity with respect to the longitudinal and transverse axes of the leaf. However, the molecular mechanism of the genetic control of seed vigor remains unknown in maize, and a better understanding of this mechanism is required. Methodology/Principal Findings To reveal the genetic architecture of leaf width, a comprehensive evaluation using four RIL populations was performed, followed by a meta-analysis. Forty-six QTLs associated with the widths of leaves at different positions above the uppermost ear were detected in the four RIL populations in three environments. The individual effects of the QTLs ranged from 4.33% to 18.01% of the observed phenotypic variation, with 14 QTLs showing effects of over 10%. We identified three common QTLs associated with leaf width at all of the examined positions, in addition to one common QTL associated with leaf width at three of the positions and six common QTLs associated with leaf width at two of the positions. The results indicate that leaf width at different leaf positions may be affected by one QTL or several of the same QTLs. Such traits may also be regulated by many different QTLs. Thirty-one of the forty-six initial QTLs were integrated into eight mQTLs through a meta-analysis, and 10 of the 14 initial QTLs presenting an R2>10% were integrated into six mQTLs. Conclusions/Significance mQTL1-2, mQTL3-1, mQTL7, and mQTL8 were composed of the initial QTLs showing an R2>10% and included four to six of the initial QTLs that were associated with two to four positions in a single population. Therefore, these four chromosome regions may be hot spots for important QTLs for these traits. Thus, they warrant further studies and may be useful for marker-assisted breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2121037619,"Background Many prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) programs currently prioritize antiretroviral therapy (ART) for women with advanced HIV. Point-of-care (POC) CD4 assays may expedite the selection of three-drug ART instead of zidovudine, but are costlier than traditional laboratory assays. Methods We used validated models of HIV infection to simulate pregnant, HIV-infected women (mean age 26 years, gestational age 26 weeks) in a general antenatal clinic in South Africa, and their infants. We examined two strategies for CD4 testing after HIV diagnosis: laboratory (test rate: 96%, result-return rate: 87%, cost: $14) and POC (test rate: 99%, result-return rate: 95%, cost: $26). We modeled South African PMTCT guidelines during the study period (WHO “Option A”): antenatal zidovudine (CD4 ≤350/μL) or ART (CD4>350/μL). Outcomes included MTCT risk at weaning (age 6 months), maternal and pediatric life expectancy (LE), maternal and pediatric lifetime healthcare costs (2013 USD), and cost-effectiveness ($/life-year saved). Results In the base case, laboratory led to projected MTCT risks of 5.7%, undiscounted pediatric LE of 53.2 years, and undiscounted PMTCT plus pediatric lifetime costs of $1,070/infant. POC led to lower modeled MTCT risk (5.3%), greater pediatric LE (53.4 years) and lower PMTCT plus pediatric lifetime costs ($1,040/infant). Maternal outcomes following laboratory were similar to POC (LE: 21.2 years; lifetime costs: $23,860/person). Compared to laboratory, POC improved clinical outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. Conclusions In antenatal clinics implementing Option A, the higher initial cost of a one-time POC CD4 assay will be offset by cost-savings from prevention of pediatric HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W1975814524,"The non-coding small RNA, IhtA expressed by the obligate intracellular human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis modulates the translation of HctA, a key protein involved in replicative to infectious cell type differentiation. Using a combination of bioinformatics and mutagenesis we sought to identify the base pairing requirement for functional repression of HctA protein expression, with an eye to applying our findings towards the identification of additional targets. IhtA is predicted to fold into a three stem:loop structure. We found that loop 1 occludes the initiation codon of hctA, while loop 2 and 3 are not required for function. This 7 nucleotide region forms G/C rich interactions surrounding the AUG of hctA. Two additional genes in the chlamydial genome, CTL0322 and CTL0097, contained some elements of the hctA:IhtA recognition sequence. The mRNA of both CTL0322and CTL0097 interacted with IhtA in vitro as measured by biolayer interferometry. However, using a CheZ reporter expression system, IhtA only inhibited the translation of CTL0322. The proposed IhtA recognition site in the CTL0322 message contains significant G/C base pairing on either side of the initiation codon while CTL0097 only contains G/C base pairing 3’ to the AUG initiation codon. These data suggest that as the functional interacting region is only 6-7nt in length that full translation repression is dependent on the degree of G/C base pairing. Additionally our results indicate that IhtA may regulate multiple mRNAs involved in the chlamydial infectious cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1983893513,"Serfling-type periodic regression models have been widely used to identify and analyse epidemic of influenza. In these approaches, the baseline is traditionally determined using cleaned historical non-epidemic data. However, we found that the previous exclusion of epidemic seasons was empirical, since year-year variations in the seasonal pattern of activity had been ignored. Therefore, excluding fixed ‘epidemic’ months did not seem reasonable. We made some adjustments in the rule of epidemic-period removal to avoid potentially subjective definition of the start and end of epidemic periods. We fitted the baseline iteratively. Firstly, we established a Serfling regression model based on the actual observations without any removals. After that, instead of manually excluding a predefined ‘epidemic’ period (the traditional method), we excluded observations which exceeded a calculated boundary. We then established Serfling regression once more using the cleaned data and excluded observations which exceeded a calculated boundary. We repeated this process until the R2 value stopped to increase. In addition, the definitions of the onset of influenza epidemic were heterogeneous, which might make it impossible to accurately evaluate the performance of alternative approaches. We then used this modified model to detect the peak timing of influenza instead of the onset of epidemic and compared this model with traditional Serfling models using observed weekly case counts of influenza-like illness (ILIs), in terms of sensitivity, specificity and lead time. A better performance was observed. In summary, we provide an adjusted Serfling model which may have improved performance over traditional models in early warning at arrival of peak timing of influenza."
https://openalex.org/W1997142186,"Understanding how tropical tree species differ in their growth strategies is critical to predict forest dynamics and assess species coexistence. Although tree growth is highly variable in tropical forests, species maximum growth is often considered as a major axis synthesizing species strategies, with fast-growing pioneer and slow-growing shade tolerant species as emblematic representatives. We used a hierarchical linear mixed model and 21-years long tree diameter increment series in a monsoon forest of the Western Ghats, India, to characterize species growth strategies and question whether maximum growth summarizes these strategies. We quantified both species responses to biotic and abiotic factors and individual tree effects unexplained by these factors. Growth responses to competition and tree size appeared highly variable among species which led to reversals in performance ranking along those two gradients. However, species-specific responses largely overlapped due to large unexplained variability resulting mostly from inter-individual growth differences consistent over time. On average one-third of the variability captured by our model was explained by covariates. This emphasizes the high dimensionality of the tree growth process, i.e. the fact that trees differ in many dimensions (genetics, life history) influencing their growth response to environmental gradients, some being unmeasured or unmeasurable. In addition, intraspecific variability increased as a power function of species maximum growth partly as a result of higher absolute responses of fast-growing species to competition and tree size. However, covariates explained on average the same proportion of intraspecific variability for slow- and fast-growing species, which showed the same range of relative responses to competition and tree size. These results reflect a scale invariance of the growth process, underlining that slow- and fast-growing species exhibit the same range of growth strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2015312348,"Purpose The role of family history to the risk of breast cancer was analyzed by incorporating menopausal status in Hong Kong Chinese women, with a particular respect to the estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) type. Methods Seven hundred and forty seven breast cancer incident cases and 781 hospital controls who had completed information on family cancer history in first-degree relatives (nature father, mother, and siblings) were recruited. Odds ratio for breast cancer were calculated by unconditional multiple logistic regression, stratified by menopausal status (a surrogate of endogenous female sex hormone level and age) and type of relative affected with the disease. Further subgroup analysis by tumor type according to ER status was investigated. Results Altogether 52 (6.96%) breast cancer cases and 23 (2.95%) controls was found that the patients’ one or more first-degree relatives had a history of breast cancer, showing an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 2.41 (95%CI: 1.45–4.02). An excess risk of breast cancer was restricted to the ER+ tumor (OR = 2.43, 95% CI: 1.38–4.28), with a relatively higher risk associated with an affected mother (OR = 3.97, 95%CI: 1.46–10.79) than an affected sister (OR = 2.06, 95%CI: 1.07–3.97), while the relative risk was more prominent in the subgroup of pre-menopausal women. Compared with the breast cancer overall, the familial risks to the ER+ tumor increased progressively with the number of affected first-degree relatives. Conclusions This study provides new insights on a relationship between family breast cancer history, menopausal status, and the ER+ breast cancer. A separate risk prediction model for ER+ tumor in Asian population is desired."
https://openalex.org/W2031350450,"Recent evidence in adipocytes points to a role for synuclein-γ in metabolism and lipid droplet dynamics, but interestingly this factor is also robustly expressed in peripheral neurons. Specific regulation of the synuclein-γ gene (Sncg) by PPARγ requires further evaluation, especially in peripheral neurons, prompting us to test if Sncg is a bona fide PPARγ target in murine adipocytes and peripheral somatosensory neurons derived from the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Sncg mRNA was decreased in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (~68%) by rosiglitazone, and this effect was diminished by the PPARγ antagonist T0070907. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed PPARγ protein binding at two promoter sequences of Sncg during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis. Rosiglitazone did not affect Sncg mRNA expression in murine cultured DRG neurons. In subcutaneous human WAT samples from two cohorts treated with pioglitazone (>11 wks), SNCG mRNA expression was reduced, albeit highly variable and most evident in type 2 diabetes. Leptin (Lep) expression, thought to be coordinately-regulated with Sncg based on correlations in human adipose tissue, was also reduced in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by rosiglitazone. However, Lep was unaffected by PPARγ antagonist, and the LXR agonist T0901317 significantly reduced Lep expression (~64%) while not impacting Sncg. The results support the concept that synuclein-γ shares some, but not all, gene regulators with leptin and is a PPARγ target in adipocytes but not DRG neurons. Regulation of synuclein-γ by cues such as PPARγ agonism in adipocytes is logical based on recent evidence for an important role for synuclein-γ in the maintenance and dynamics of adipocyte lipid droplets."
https://openalex.org/W2054165029,"Objective We aimed to examine factors associated with untreated diabetes in a nationally representative sample of the Japanese population. Research Design and Methods We pooled data from the Japanese National Health and Nutrition Survey from 2005 to 2009 (n = 20,496). Individuals aged 20 years and older were included in the analysis. We classified participants as having diabetes if they had HbA1c levels ≥6.5% (≥48 mmol/mol). People with diabetes who self-reported that they were not currently receiving diabetic treatment were considered to be untreated. We conducted a multinomial logistic regression analysis to determine factors associated with untreated diabetes relative to non-diabetic individuals. Results Of 20,496 participants who were included in the analysis, untreated diabetes was present in 748 (3.6%). Among participants with untreated diabetes, 48.3% were previously diagnosed with diabetes, and 46.5% had HbA1c levels ≥7.0% (≥53 mmol/mol). Participants with untreated diabetes were significantly more likely than non-diabetic participants to be male, older, and currently smoking, have lower HDL cholesterol levels and higher BMI, non-HDL cholesterol levels, and systolic blood pressure. Conclusions A substantial proportion of people in Japan with untreated diabetes have poor glycemic control. Targeting relevant factors for untreated diabetes in screening programs may be effective to enhance the treatment and control of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2026709356,"Though the etiology is largely unknown, testicular cancer incidence has seen recent significant increases in northern Europe and throughout many Western regions. The most common cancer in males under age 40, age period cohort models have posited exposures in the in utero environment or in early childhood as possible causes of increased risk of testicular cancer. Some of these factors may be tied to geography through being associated with behavioral, cultural, sociodemographic or built environment characteristics. If so, this could result in detectable geographic clusters of cases that could lead to hypotheses regarding environmental targets for intervention. Given a latency period between exposure to an environmental carcinogen and testicular cancer diagnosis, mobility histories are beneficial for spatial cluster analyses. Nearest-neighbor based Q-statistics allow for the incorporation of changes in residency in spatial disease cluster detection. Using these methods, a space-time cluster analysis was conducted on a population-wide case-control population selected from the Danish Cancer Registry with mobility histories since 1971 extracted from the Danish Civil Registration System. Cases (N=3297) were diagnosed between 1991 and 2003, and two sets of controls (N=3297 for each set) matched on sex and date of birth were included in the study. We also examined spatial patterns in maternal residential history for those cases and controls born in 1971 or later (N= 589 case-control pairs). Several small clusters were detected when aligning individuals by year prior to diagnosis, age at diagnosis and calendar year of diagnosis. However, the largest of these clusters contained only 2 statistically significant individuals at their center, and were not replicated in SaTScan spatial-only analyses which are less susceptible to multiple testing bias. We found little evidence of local clusters in residential histories of testicular cancer cases in this Danish population."

We identified episodes during which the subjects seemed to enact dreams or presumed dream-like mentation (NPB arousals) versus episodes with physiological movements (no-NPB arousals). A time-frequency analysis (Morlet Wavelet Transform) of the scalp EEG signals around each NPB and no- NPB arousal onset was performed, and the amplitudes of the spectral frequencies were compared between NPB and no-NPB arousals.19 NPBs were identified, 12 of which consisting of 'elementary' NPBs while 7 resembling confusional arousals. With quantitative EEG analysis, we found an amplitude reduction in the 5-6 Hz band 40 seconds before NPBs arousal as compared to no-NPB arousals at F4 and C4 derivations (p<0.01).Many PD and MSA patients feature various NREM sleep-related behaviors, with clinical and electrophysiological differences and similarities with arousal parasomnias in the general population.This study help bring to attention an overlooked phenomenon in neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2319035172,"Angina pectoris is a common clinical symptom that often results from myocardial infarction. One typical characteristic of angina pectoris is that the pain does not match the severity of the myocardial ischemia. One possible explanation is that the intensity of cardiac nociceptive information could be dynamically regulated by certain brain areas. As an important nucleus for processing cardiac nociception, the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) has been studied to some extent. However, until now, the morphological and functional involvement of the NTS in chronic myocardial infarction (CMI) has remained unknown. In the present study, by exploring left anterior descending coronary artery ligation surgery, we found that the number of synaptophysin-immunoreactive puncta and Fos-immunoreactive neurons in the rat NTS two weeks after ligation surgery increased significantly. Excitatory pre- and postsynaptic transmission was potentiated. A bath application of a Ca2+ channel inhibitor GABApentin and Ca2+ permeable AMPA receptor antagonist NASPM could reverse the potentiated pre- and postsynaptic transmission, respectively. Meanwhile, rats with CMI showed significantly increased visceral pain behaviors. Microinjection of GABApentin or NASPM into the NTS decreased the CMI-induced visceral pain behaviors. In sum, our results suggest that the NTS is an important area for the process of cardiac afference in chronic myocardial infarction condition."
https://openalex.org/W2077031721,"Proteus mirabilis isolates commonly have decreased susceptibility to imipenem. Previously, we found P. mirabilis hfq mutant was more resistant to imipenem and an outer membrane protein (OMP) could be involved. Therefore, we investigated the role of this OMP in carbapenem susceptibility. By SDS-PAGE we found this OMP (named ImpR) was increased in hfq mutant and LC-MS/MS revealed it to be the homologue of Salmonella YbfM, which is a porin for chitobiose and subject to MicM (a small RNA) regulation. We demonstrated that ImpR overexpression resulted in increased carbapenem MICs in the laboratory strain and clinical isolates. Chitobiose induced expression of chb (a chitobiose utilization operon). Real-time RT-PCR and SDS-PAGE were performed to elucidate the relationship of hfq, impR, chb and MicM in P. mirabilis. We found MicM RNA was decreased in hfq mutant and chbBC-intergenic region (chbBC-IGR) overexpression strain (chbIGRov), while impR mRNA was increased in hfq mutant, micM mutant and chbIGRov strain. In addition, mutation of hfq or micM and overexpression of chbBC-IGR increased ImpR protein level. Accordingly, chitobiose made wild-type have higher levels of ImpR protein and are more resistant to carbapenems. Hfq- and MicM-complemented strains restored wild-type MICs. Mutation of both impR and hfq eliminated the increase in carbapenem MICs observed in hfq mutant and ImpR-complementation of hfq/impR double mutant resulted in MICs as hfq mutant, indicating that the ImpR-dependent decreased carbapenem susceptibility of hfq mutant. These indicate MicM was antisense to impR mRNA and was negatively-regulated by chbBC-IGR. Together, overexpression of ImpR contributed to the decreased carbapenem susceptibility in P. mirabilis."
https://openalex.org/W2085698394,"Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) treatment induces arteriosclerosis and vascular senescence. Here, we report that the systemic inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production by L-NAME causes pulmonary emphysema. L-NAME-treated lungs exhibited both the structural (alveolar tissue destruction) and functional (increased compliance and reduced elastance) characteristics of emphysema development. Furthermore, we found that L-NAME-induced emphysema could be attenuated through both genetic deficiency and pharmacological inhibition of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Because PAI-1 is an important contributor to the development of senescence both in vitro and in vivo, we investigated whether L-NAME-induced senescence led to the observed emphysematous changes. We found that L-NAME treatment was associated with molecular and cellular evidence of premature senescence in mice, and that PAI-1 inhibition attenuated these increases. These findings indicate that NO serves to protect and defend lung tissue from physiological aging."
https://openalex.org/W1989062288,"Construal Level Theory (CLT) [1] defines psychological distance as any object, event, or person that cannot be experienced by the self in the here and now. The goal of the present research was to demonstrate that feelings of uncertainty are closely linked to the concept of psychological distance. Two experiments tested the assumption that spatial distance and uncertainty are bidirectionally related. In the first experiment, we show that perceived spatial distance leads to a feeling of uncertainty. The second experiment revealed that a feeling of uncertainty leads to a perception of greater distance. By demonstrating that distance is closely tied to uncertainty, the present research extends previous research on both distance and uncertainty by incorporating previously unexplained findings within CLT. Implications of these findings such as the role of uncertainty within CLT are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2019633075,"Recent developments have led to an enormous increase of publicly available large genomic data, including complete genomes. The 1000 Genomes Project was a major contributor, releasing the results of sequencing a large number of individual genomes, and allowing for a myriad of large scale studies on human genetic variation. However, the tools currently available are insufficient when the goal concerns some analyses of data sets encompassing more than hundreds of base pairs and when considering haplotype sequences of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Here, we present a new and potent tool to deal with large data sets allowing the computation of a variety of summary statistics of population genetic data, increasing the speed of data analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2020226466,"The study examined whether women excel at tasks which require processing the identity of objects information as has been suggested in the context of the well-known object location memory task. In a computer-simulated task, university students were shown simulated indoor and outdoor house scenes. After studying a scene the students were presented with two images. One was the original image and the other a modified version in which one object was either rotated by ninety degrees or substituted with a similar looking object. The participants were asked to indicate the original image. The main finding was that no sex effect was obtained in this task. The female and male students did not differ on a verbal ability test, and their 2D:4D ratios were found to be comparable."
https://openalex.org/W1966814958,"Biological networks are typically comprised of many parts whose interactions are governed by nonlinear dynamics. This potentially imbues them with the ability to support multiple attractors, and therefore to exhibit correspondingly distinct patterns of behavior. In particular, multiple attractors have been demonstrated for the electrical activity of the diseased heart in situations where cardioversion is able to convert a reentrant arrhythmia to a stable normal rhythm. Healthy hearts, however, are typically resilient to abnormal rhythms. This raises the question as to how a healthy cardiac cell network must be altered so that it can support multiple distinct behaviors. Here we demonstrate how anatomic defects can give rise to multi-stability in the heart as a function of the electrophysiological properties of the cardiac tissue and the timing of activation of ectopic foci. This leads to a form of hysteretic behavior, which we call dynamic entrapment, whereby the heart can become trapped in aberrant attractor as a result of a transient change in tissue properties. We show that this can lead to a highly inconsistent relationship between clinical symptoms and underlying pathophysiology, which raises the possibility that dynamic entrapment may underlie other forms of chronic idiopathic illness."
