Aberration counts were made on material fixed 42, 49, and 72 hours after treatment. Control material fixed at each interval was also examined. Two doses, 25 and 50 r, were used. (M. H. R.)"

The present report is concerned primarily with techniques and procedures developed to insure removal of non-lipide contaminants from preparations of these lipides."

The insoluble MnO/sub 2/ was reduced with NaHSO/sub 3/, dissolved in HCl, and the mixture was freed of interfering nuclides with Fe(OH) (OAc). The Mn was precipitated as MnNH/sub 4/PO/sub 4/ and ignited to Mn/sub 2/P/sub 2/O/sub 7/, which was counted. The ..gamma..-spectrum of the isolated sample was identical with that of authentic /sup 54/Mn. This nuclide accounted for 40% of the total ..gamma..-activity of the sample. Calculations indicate that megacurie quantities were produced at the time of detonation, possibly from stable Mn and Fe, emphasizing the importance of induced radioactivity in fallout."
