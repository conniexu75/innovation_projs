https://openalex.org/W2057863409,"Photosynthesis uses light energy to drive the oxidation of water at an oxygen-evolving catalytic site within photosystem II (PSII). We report the structure of PSII of the cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus at 3.5 angstrom resolution. We have assigned most of the amino acid residues of this 650-kilodalton dimeric multisubunit complex and refined the structure to reveal its molecular architecture. Consequently, we are able to describe details of the binding sites for cofactors and propose a structure of the oxygen-evolving center (OEC). The data strongly suggest that the OEC contains a cubane-like Mn3CaO4 cluster linked to a fourth Mn by a mono-micro-oxo bridge. The details of the surrounding coordination sphere of the metal cluster and the implications for a possible oxygen-evolving mechanism are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2034984769,"One of the outstanding challenges in the field of porous materials is the design and synthesis of chemical structures with exceptionally high surface areas. Such materials are of critical importance to many applications involving catalysis, separation and gas storage. The claim for the highest surface area of a disordered structure is for carbon, at 2,030 m2 g(-1) (ref. 2). Until recently, the largest surface area of an ordered structure was that of zeolite Y, recorded at 904 m2 g(-1) (ref. 3). But with the introduction of metal-organic framework materials, this has been exceeded, with values up to 3,000 m2 g(-1) (refs 4-7). Despite this, no method of determining the upper limit in surface area for a material has yet been found. Here we present a general strategy that has allowed us to realize a structure having by far the highest surface area reported to date. We report the design, synthesis and properties of crystalline Zn4O(1,3,5-benzenetribenzoate)2, a new metal-organic framework with a surface area estimated at 4,500 m2 g(-1). This framework, which we name MOF-177, combines this exceptional level of surface area with an ordered structure that has extra-large pores capable of binding polycyclic organic guest molecules--attributes not previously combined in one material."

https://openalex.org/W2017947281,"Mangrove forests are one of the world's most threatened tropical ecosystems with global loss exceeding 35% (ref. 1). Juvenile coral reef fish often inhabit mangroves, but the importance of these nurseries to reef fish population dynamics has not been quantified. Indeed, mangroves might be expected to have negligible influence on reef fish communities: juvenile fish can inhabit alternative habitats and fish populations may be regulated by other limiting factors such as larval supply or fishing. Here we show that mangroves are unexpectedly important, serving as an intermediate nursery habitat that may increase the survivorship of young fish. Mangroves in the Caribbean strongly influence the community structure of fish on neighbouring coral reefs. In addition, the biomass of several commercially important species is more than doubled when adult habitat is connected to mangroves. The largest herbivorous fish in the Atlantic, Scarus guacamaia, has a functional dependency on mangroves and has suffered local extinction after mangrove removal. Current rates of mangrove deforestation are likely to have severe deleterious consequences for the ecosystem function, fisheries productivity and resilience of reefs. Conservation efforts should protect connected corridors of mangroves, seagrass beds and coral reefs."

https://openalex.org/W2081839805,"Mammals cannot naturally produce omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids--beneficial nutrients found mainly in fish oil--from the more abundant omega-6 (n-6) fatty acids and so they must rely on a dietary supply. Here we show that mice engineered to carry a fat-1 gene from the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans can add a double bond into an unsaturated fatty-acid hydrocarbon chain and convert n-6 to n-3 fatty acids. This results in an abundance of n-3 and a reduction in n-6 fatty acids in the organs and tissues of these mice, in the absence of dietary n-3. As well as presenting an opportunity to investigate the roles played by n-3 fatty acids in the body, our discovery indicates that this technology might be adapted to enrich n-3 fatty acids in animal products such as meat, milk and eggs."
https://openalex.org/W2057351112,"Prefrontal cortex (PFC) supports flexible behavior by mediating cognitive control, though the elemental forms of control supported by PFC remain a central debate. Dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) is thought to guide response selection under conditions of response conflict or, alternatively, may refresh recently active representations within working memory. Lateral frontopolar cortex (FPC) may also adjudicate response conflict, though others propose that FPC supports higher order control processes such as subgoaling and integration. Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is hypothesized to upregulate response selection by detecting response conflict; it remains unclear whether ACC functions generalize beyond monitoring response conflict. The present fMRI experiment directly tested these competing theories regarding the functional roles of DLPFC, FPC, and ACC. Results reveal dissociable control processes in PFC, with mid-DLPFC selectively mediating resolution of response conflict and FPC further mediating subgoaling/integration. ACC demonstrated a broad sensitivity to control demands, suggesting a generalized role in modulating cognitive control."
https://openalex.org/W2085728531,"Although important for apoptosis, the mechanism of Bax regulation is poorly understood. This study demonstrates that phosphorylation of Ser184 regulates Bax activity. The phosphorylation required phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt activation and appeared to be mediated by Akt itself. In the serine-phosphorylated form, Bax was detected in the cytoplasm, could not be immunoprecipitated with the activation-specific antibody 6A7, and promoted heterodimerization with Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and A1. Apoptotic neutrophils possessed reduced levels of serine-phosphorylated Bax correlating with an increase in activated Bax as well as an increase in the amount of Bax found translocated to the mitochondria. We suggest that Bax is regulated by phosphorylation of Ser184 in an Akt-dependent manner and that phosphorylation inhibits Bax effects on the mitochondria by maintaining the protein in the cytoplasm, heterodimerized with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members.

Apoptosis is a natural and required process that allows normal development, removal of damaged or mutated cells, and remodeling of tissues (1Hetts S.W. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1998; 279: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Pro- and anti-apoptotic signals are carefully balanced in the neutrophil, a cell whose life span both in vivo and in vitro is only a few hours. The major role of the neutrophil is to kill and eliminate microorganisms. During inflammation, however, this intrinsically beneficial function may go awry, so proteases and oxidants are released into the environment, where they begin to destroy the surrounding tissue. The extent of damage is thought to be controlled in part by neutrophil apoptosis. Initiation of the apoptotic process inhibits the ability of neutrophils to move, degranulate, and produce superoxide (2Lee A. Whyte M.K. Haslett C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 3Haslett C. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 160: S5-S11Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) and leads to rapid removal of the cells before cytolysis ensues. Thus, understanding how neutrophil apoptosis is controlled, especially at the site of inflammation, is critical. As with most cell types, neutrophil apoptosis is regulated by Bcl-2 family members, a complex group of proteins composed of members that can either promote apoptosis such as Bax, Bak, Bad, and Bim or that inhibit apoptosis such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and A1 (4Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Although the neutrophil does not express Bcl-2 and contains only a limited amount of Bad, it does contain the pro-apoptotic proteins Bak and Bax and the anti-apoptotic proteins, Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and Al (5Moulding D.A. Quayle J.A. Hart C.A. Edwards S.W. Blood. 1998; 92: 2495-2502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Weinmann P. Gaehtgens P. Walzog B. Blood. 1999; 93: 3106-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There exists some evidence indicating that Bax is necessary for inducing neutrophil apoptosis and that this effect can be down-regulated by antiapoptotic stimuli (6Weinmann P. Gaehtgens P. Walzog B. Blood. 1999; 93: 3106-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Pryde J.G. Walker A. Rossi A.G. Hannah S. Haslett C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33574-33584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). There are also reports indicating that Bax function is altered in chronic inflammatory diseases and that, under these conditions, neutrophil apoptosis is significantly attenuated (8Dibbert B. Weber M. Nikolaizik W.H. Vogt P. Schoni M.H. Blaser K. Simon H.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13330-13335Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Bax is a 21-kDa protein that is important in controlling cell death, particularly in hematopoietic cells. Cells that overexpress Bax show enhanced apoptosis (9Shinoura N. Yoshida Y. Asai A. Kirino T. Hamada H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5703-5713Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), whereas Bax-null cells show resistance to both spontaneous and induced apoptosis. Bax expression has also been associated with tumor development and hematopoietic malignancies (10Meijerink J.P. Mensink E.J. Wang K. Sedlak T.W. Sloetjes A.W. de Witte T. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J.

The protein is normally found in the cytoplasm heterodimerized to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL; however, once the cell is exposed to an apoptotic stimulus, Bax translocates to the mitochondria (12Granville D.J.

Cell Death & Differ. 2000; 7: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), where it is thought to form oligomers. These promote apoptosis by forming large pores, resulting in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c (15Eskes R. Antonsson B. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S.

Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Regulation of Bcl-2 family members can occur by a number of mechanisms, including up-regulation of synthesis (17Huang H.M. Huang C.J. Yen J.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 1764-1771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), enhancement of degradation, and phosphorylation. Both anti- and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members may be controlled by phosphorylation. For example, the pro-apoptotic ability of Bad is inhibited by Akt-mediated phosphorylation, which induces it to pair with the 14-3-3 protein instead of heterodimerizing with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Another pro-apoptotic family member, Bik, is regulated in a similar manner. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL also become phosphorylated, and this inactivates their anti-apoptotic abilities (18Scatena C.D.

Although phosphorylation of Bax as a means for regulation has not been well documented, Lewis et al. (19Lewis S. Bethell S.S. Patel S. Martinou J.C. Antonsson B. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that recombinant Bax lacking the C-terminal tail is phosphorylated in vitro by MAPK 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MEK1, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-1; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; GM-CSF, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MEK1, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-1; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; GM-CSF, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. and protein kinase A. In addition, Ser184 has been implicated as being important for regulating Bax activity. Thus, it seems likely that Bax could be regulated by phosphorylation, but this has not yet been demonstrated within cells. One of the key enzymes involved in regulating apoptosis is Akt/protein kinase B. Akt, a 60-kDa serine/threonine kinase expressed in most cell types (20Kandel E.S. Hay N. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 210-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar), has been shown to inhibit both spontaneous and stress-induced apoptosis in neutrophils (21Al-Shami A. Naccache P.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 5236-5246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It appears to be responsible for regulating growth factor-mediated survival in most cell types (23Gibson S. Tu S. Oyer R. Anderson S.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17612-17618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 24Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E.

Commun. 2000; 277: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Akt is activated by a variety of growth factors via PI3K-generated phosphatidylinositols (26Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate induces recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane, where it is serine/threonine-phosphorylated. Active Akt is thought to inhibit apoptosis in a variety of ways, both upstream and downstream of mitochondrial perturbation. It can lead to inhibition of caspase-9 activity, phosphorylation of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bad, or regulation of transcription factors such as cAMP-responsive element-binding protein and NF-κB and members of the Forkhead family (20Kandel E.S. Hay N. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 210-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 24Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). These multiple anti-apoptotic effects of Akt make it a prime kinase candidate for inducing phosphorylation of Bax and thus inhibiting its pro-apoptotic abilities. This study focuses on the mechanism by which Bax is regulated, particularly in neutrophils. It is suggested that antiapoptotic stimuli lead to the activation of Akt and Ser184 phosphorylation of Bax. This phosphorylation promotes its sequestration to the cytoplasm and promotes its ability to heterodimerize with the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, thus inhibiting its pro-apoptotic abilities. Material and Antibodies—[32P]Orthophosphate and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The PI3K inhibitors LY-294,002 and wortmannin were obtained from Sigma and used at 20 μm and 100 nm, respectively. The MEK1 inhibitor PD 98059 (Calbiochem) was used at 25 μm. Murine TNF-α and human TNF-α (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were used at 1000 units/ml, and GM-CSF (R&D Systems) was used at 100 ng/ml. Anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Alexis (San Diego, CA). Monoclonal antibody 4G10, Akt constructs, and active and inactive Akt proteins were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-β2 integrin clustering antibody 2LPM19c was obtained from Dako Corp. (Carpinteria, CA) and used at 2 μg/ml. Anti-Bax antibody, antibody 6A7 (which recognizes only the open form of Bax), and anti-human and anti-mouse Bax, anti-Mcl-1, and anti-Bcl-xL antibodies were obtained from Pharmingen. Mouse monoclonal antibody 1273 against human mitochondria was raised against a 65-kDa surface protein and was obtained from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). MitoTracker Red CMXRos was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR) and used at 75 nm. Mouse anti-Bax antibody used for immunofluorescence and anti-A1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution for Western blotting or at 1 μg/ml for immunoprecipitations unless otherwise indicated. Neutrophil Isolation—Human neutrophils were purified from whole blood as described previously (28Haslett C. Guthrie L.A. Kopaniak M.M. Johnston Jr., R.B. Henson P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 101-110PubMed Google Scholar). Neutrophil purity is >95% with typically ≤2% eosinophils. Initial viability is >98%. PLB-985 Cell Line Growth and Differentiation—Cells were grown in stationary suspension culture in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Inc.), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Biological Industries) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. PLB-985 cells were differentiated with retinoic acid for 3 days, and efficiency of differentiation was determined via a nitro blue tetrazolium test. Preparation of Murine Peritoneal Neutrophils—Mouse peritoneal exudate neutrophils were prepared following the methods of Savige et al. (29Savige J.A. Saverymuttu S.H. Pinching A.J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1984; 58: 737-744PubMed Google Scholar). Cytospun samples typically reveal nearly pure neutrophils (>90%) with occasional macrophages. Typical yields are ∼20 × 106 peritoneal neutrophils/mouse. Bax knockout mice were obtained via permission from Dr. Stanley Kosmeyer. Assessment of Neutrophil Apoptosis—Following isolation, neutrophils were suspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1% LPS-free BSA (A 1933, Sigma) and incubated in conical polypropylene tubes (Sarstedt, Inc., Sparks, NV) for varying times, after which 2 × 105 cells were diluted and cytocentrifuged at 600 rpm for 3 min on glass slides and stained with a modified Wright-Giemsa stain. Cells were counted as apoptotic if their nuclei lost segmentation and appeared round and darkly stained as described previously (34Whitlock B.B. Gardai S. Fadok V. Bratton D. Henson P.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1305-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). At least 200 cells were counted per slide in a blinded fashion. The accuracy of morphological assessment was checked periodically by flow cytometric analysis of hypodiploid DNA in propidium iodidestained neutrophils. Apoptotic percentages obtained by these two methods agreed within 5%. [32P]Orthophosphate Labeling of Neutrophils and PLB-985 Cells— Orthophosphate labeling was performed according to Andrews and Babior (30Andrews P.C. Babior B.M. Blood. 1983; 61: 333-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 50 × 106 neutrophils were diluted to 5 × 106 cells/ml with incubation buffer (6.0 mm HEPES/Tris (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm glucose, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.25 mm CaCl2) for 30 min. Cells were then labeled with [32P]orthophosphate following incubation with 1 mCi/sample for 6 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with PBS, resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in RMPI 1640 medium plus 1% BSA, exposed to 100 ng/ml GM-CSF or medium alone, and cultured for an additional 4 h. Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Bax was immunoprecipitated from 100 × 106 [32P]orthophosphate-labeled neutrophils treated with or without 100 ng/ml GM-CSF. The immunoprecipitates were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane slices containing Bax were excised, and phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described by Frankel et al. (31Frankel S.K. Van Linden A.A. Riches D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Ninhydrin staining and autoradiography determined the location of the phosphoamino acids. Protein Extraction and Immunoblotting—Neutrophils were subjected to hypotonic lysis and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer according to Hsu and Youle (32Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and Gilmore et al. (33Gilmore A.P. Metcalfe A.D. Romer L.H. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 431-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In brief, neutrophils at 10 × 106/ml were resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 1 mm NaF, and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate with the protease inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride before homogenization. A 5× isotonic buffer (525 mm mannitol, 172 nm sucrose, 12.5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), and 2 mm EDTA) was then added. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described (34Whitlock B.B. Gardai S. Fadok V. Bratton D. Henson P.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1305-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In brief, 25 μl of protein A beads and 1 μg of antibody were added for 2 h with rotation at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged, and the beads washed were three times with hypotonic lysis buffer before addition of 1× Laemmli buffer. Western blotting and immunoblotting were performed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described (34Whitlock B.B. Gardai S. Fadok V. Bratton D. Henson P.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1305-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 35Frasch S.C. Nick J.A. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Worthen G.S. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8389-8397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). For experiments using PLB-985 cells transfected with murine Bax, cells were lysed in the same manner, but lysates were first immunodepleted of human Bax overnight with excess antibody, after which lysates were spun down and transferred to protein A beads containing 1 μg/ml anti-murine Bax antibody and immunoprecipitated for an additional 2 h prior to immunoblotting. Blots were stripped and reprobed for equal loading. Immunofluorescence—Bax translocation was analyzed according to Dewson et al. (36Dewson G. Cohen G.M. Wardlaw A.J. Blood. 2001; 98: 2239-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Neutrophils were incubated with or without GM-CSF for 20 h. Cells were then incubated with 75 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos for 45 min at 37 °C and subsequently cytospun. Slides were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and then washed five times with PBS. Samples were permeabilized in 0.5% CHAPS for 30 min, followed by incubation in blocking buffer (2% goat serum with 3% BSA in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibody (anti-Bax antibody 6A7; 5 μg/ml in blocking buffer) was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed five times with PBS, after which Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (diluted 1:300 in blocking buffer; Molecular Probes, Inc.) was added for 50 min at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (5 μg/ml; Calbiochem) for 10 min at room temperature, and slides were mounted. Images were collected with Slidebook on a Leica DMRXA microscope at magnification ×62. For Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL localization, cells were treated in a similar manner, except that they were taken directly from the blood isolation and were stained with Mito-Tracker Red CMXRos prior to fixation and staining with 1 μg of Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, or an isotype control. Co-localization of Bax and Mcl-1 was performed in a similar manner, except that MitoTracker Red CMXRos was not added prior to the cytospin. After fixation, samples were incubated with rabbit anti-Mcl-1 and mouse anti-Bax antibodies overnight at 4 °C, at which point samples were washed and incubated with a mixture of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies for 1 h prior to mounting and visualization. Bax cDNA and Ser184 Mutations—Murine Bax cDNA in a Thy1 vector was prepared as described by Hildeman et al. (37Hildeman D.A. Mitchell T. Teague T.K. Henson P. Day B.J. Kappler J. Marrack P.C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Mutations of Ser184 were performed by site-directed mutagenesis of the Bax construct. The resulting PCR products were sequenced for confirmation of mutation and ligated into the multiple cloning site of the retroviral Thy1 vector. Retroviral Infections—PLB-985 cells were retrovirally infected. In brief, Phoenix cells were grown in culture and, 24 h prior to CaCl2 transfection, were trypsinized, resuspended at 1.5 × 105/ml, and plated at 3 × 105 cells in 35-mm wells previously coated with 0.1 μl/ml poly-d-lysine for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were grown overnight, and CaCl2 was then transfected with 1 μg of vector plasmid along with 1 μg of a packaging plasmid (for human cell pCLampho), 144 μl of water, and 50 μl of CaCl2 (1 m). This mixture was added very slowly to 200 μl of 2× Hanks' buffered saline solution that was lightly vortexed. After addition, 200 μl was added to each set of cells for overnight culture at 37 °C. The next day, the medium was replaced; and after 48 h, the virus was collected by aspirating the medium into a 15-ml conical tube and spinning at 1500 rpm for 5 min. The virus was resuspended in 1 ml of supplemented RPMI 1640 medium and added to 2 × 106 PLB-985 cells previously plated in 6-well plates. 1 μl of Polybrene was then added, and the cells were spun for 2 h at 2000 rpm in a plate spinner. Cells were allowed to recover for 30 min, at which point the medium was removed, and 2 ml of RPMI 1640 medium plus fetal bovine serum was added. Cells were then cultured overnight; and the next day, transfection efficiency was determined with anti-Thy1 antibody by flow cytometry. In brief, 100 μl of each transfection was spun down, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and 1 μg of phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-Thy1 antibody was added for 1 h in the dark. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assay—Phosphorylation experiments with active and inactive Akt proteins were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bax was immunoprecipitated from 10 × 106 unstimulated neutrophils and washed five times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in reaction buffer containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP diluted in 500 μl of unlabeled ATP plus 75 mm MgCl2. 1 μg of active or inactive Akt was then added to the sample for 20 min at 37 °C. The immunoprecipitates were centrifuged and washed six times with reaction buffer, boiled in 1× Laemmli buffer, run on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and immunoblotted, and autoradiographs were obtained. Blots were reprobed for total Bax levels. Mitochondrial Isolation—Neutrophils (5 × 107) were resuspended in cavitation buffer (100 mm sucrose, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% BSA, 10 μm triethanolamine, 5% Percoll, 0.01% digitonin, and protease inhibitors) pressurized in the cavitation chamber at 420 p.s.i. for 5 min. Cells were spun down at 2500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove the nuclei. Supernatants were then spun at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet containing the mitochondria was resuspended in mitochondrial buffer (300 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm MOPS, 0.1% BSA, and protease inhibitors). The protein concentration was determined, at which point samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer and then stored at -20 °C. Subcellular Fractionation of Neutrophils—Neutrophil granular fractions were supplied by one of us (N. B.) and were isolated by subcellular fractionation as described by Kjeldsen et al. (38Kjeldsen L. Sengelov H. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Granular fractions were loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed for either Mcl-1 or a mitochondrion-specific marker (monoclonal antibody 1273). Neutrophils from Bax-null Mice Display Resistance to Both Spontaneous and Stress-induced Apoptosis—Neutrophils either isolated from the peripheral blood or elicited by sterile infection undergo rapid, unstimulated apoptosis. This is inhibited by activation of either the PI3K/Akt or MAPK pathway. Recently, Bcl-2 family members have been implicated in regulating neutrophil apoptosis, in particular the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology 3 domain-containing molecule Bax (39Wang K. Gross A. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6083-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To examine a potential modulatory role for Bax in neutrophil apoptosis, cells from Bax-/- mice and littermate controls were isolated from a sterile inflammatory site induced by thioglycolate injection, and the spontaneous rate of apoptosis was assessed. Cells were also treated with the PI3K inhibitor LY-294002 to investigate the importance of the PI3K pathway in spontaneous apoptosis. After 12 h of culture, neutrophils from Bax-/- mice displayed 50% less spontaneous apoptosis compared with their littermate controls (Fig. 1). Additionally, the PI3K inhibitor LY-294002 enhanced the number of apoptotic cells in control mice while having only a slight enhancing effect on cells in Bax-null mice. This suggests that the Akt pathway is not as important in preventing death in Bax-/- cells as in control cells. The spontaneous apoptotic process in neutrophils can be enhanced by pro-apoptotic stress stimuli such as TNF-α and anti-Fas IgM (40Liles W.C. Kiener P.A. Ledbetter J.A. Aruffoe A. Klebanoff S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 41Tudan C. Jackson J.K. Blanis L. Pelech S.L. Burt H.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5798-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cells isolated from control mice had 30% enhanced apoptosis when treated with TNF-α (Fig. 1). However, the apoptosis of Bax-null cells was not significantly affected. These data suggest an important role for Bax in regulating both spontaneous and stress-induced apoptosis of neutrophils. Anti-apoptotic Stimuli Induce Phosphorylation of Bax—Protein phosphorylation is a potent and widely diverse means by which cells regulate signaling. Phosphorylation of Bax has been implicated as a means of regulation, but this has never been demonstrated. To pursue the possibility that phosphorylation could inhibit Bax activity, neutrophils were cultured in the presence or absence of the anti-apoptotic stimulus GM-CSF. Cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate prior to stimulation. Bax was then immunoprecipitated, and 32P incorporation was detected by autoradiography. Bax from GM-CSF-stimulated cells displayed a significant increase in 32P incorporation/phosphorylation compared with control cells (Fig. 2A). These data indicate that anti-apoptotic conditions result in Bax phosphorylation and support the possibility that phosphorylation can regulate Bax activity. To determine whether the phosphorylation occurs at threonine, serine, or tyrosine, neutrophils were again cultured with 32P in the presence of GM-CSF. Samples were lysed, and Bax was immunoprecipitated and analyzed for phosphoamino acids. Using internal standards visualized by ninhydrin staining and Akt (a molecule that is serine-phosphorylated) as a positive control (data not shown), we observed that GM-CSF induced serine phosphorylation of Bax (Fig. 2B). There was no significant evidence for phosphothreonine or phosphotyrosine. Anti-phosphoserine Antibodies Specifically Recognize Bax—To establish a practical experimental system for analyzing Bax phosphorylation, a specific anti-phosphoserine antibody for Bax was sought. After examining a number of anti-phosphoserine antibodies (all of which showed some reactivity with Bax in GM-CSF-stimulated neutrophils), the IgG clone 7F12 (Alexis) was chosen (Fig. 3A). Although the IgM clones 4H4, IL8, and LB4 demonstrated reactivity with Bax, we selected the IgG clone 7F12 for ease of use in subsequent experiments. Control IgM and IgG antibodies as well as anti-phosphothreonine and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were ineffective in immunoprecipitating Bax (Fig. 3B). This provided additional evidence that Bax is selectively serine-phosphorylated. As shown in Fig. 3C, three unrelated anti-apoptotic stimuli (GM-CSF, LPS, and anti-β2 integrin clustering antibody 2LPM19c) (31Frankel S.K. Van Linden A.A. Riches D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) each induced Bax serine phosphorylation. By contrast, TNF-α, acting as a pro-apoptotic stimulus, decreased Bax phosphorylation. Activation of PI3K and Akt Induces Bax Phosphorylation— Two major anti-apoptotic pathways that inhibit neutrophil apoptosis are the PI3K/Akt and MEK1/ERK pathways (34Whitlock B.B. Gardai S. Fadok V.

The current standard of care is pegylated interferon α in combination with ribavirin, which has a sustained viral response rate of 40–50% in genotype 1 HCV-infected patients, which accounts for the majority of the hepatitis C population in the United States and Japan, and of 80–90% in patients infected with genotype 2 or 3 HCV (4Davis G.L.

Thus, more effective therapeutic drugs with fewer side effects and shorter treatment durations are needed for patients infected with HCV. HCV is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus with a 9.6-kb positive-polarity genome, which encodes a polyprotein precursor of about 3,000 amino acids. The HCV polyprotein is proteolytically processed by cellular and HCV proteases into at least 10 distinct products, in the order of NH2-C-E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B-COOH (for a review, see Ref. 7Blight K.J. Kolyhalov A.A. Reed K.E. Agapov E.V. Rice C.M. Antiviral Ther. 1998; 3: 71-81PubMed Google Scholar). NS3 serine protease and helicase as well as NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase are believed to be components of a replication complex responsible for viral RNA replication and have been shown to be essential for the HCV replication in chimpanzees (8Kolykhalov A.A. Mihalik K. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2046-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). These HCV enzymes have been the major targets for the development of HCV-specific therapeutics during the past decade (for a review, see Ref. 9De Francesco R. Tomei L. Altamura S. Summa V. Migliaccio G. Antiviral Res. 2003; 58: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, successful discovery of a new HCV-specific drug candidate has been hampered by the lack of a robust, reproducible infectious virus cell culture system.

In phase I trials, a 2–3-log reduction of HCV viral load was observed after a 2-day treatment, which provided the first proof-of-concept evidence that HCV NS3·4A protease inhibitors could be a new therapeutic option for hepatitis C patients (24Lamarre D.

(March 7, 2002), International Patent WO 0218369, Eli Lilly and Co.Google Scholar), was selected as a clinical candidate for hepatitis C (26Perni R.B. Chandorkar G. Chaturvedi P.R. Courtney L.F.

Resistance to specific antiviral drugs is a major factor limiting the efficacy of therapies against many retroviruses or RNA viruses, due to the error-prone nature of the viral reverse transcriptases or RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. As new HCV-specific inhibitors enter clinical trials, resistance could become a major problem in patients treated with drugs targeting HCV NS3·4A serine protease or NS5B RNA polymerase. In this report, we used the HCV subgenomic replicon system to identify resistance mutations against two HCV protease inhibitor clinical candidates, BILN 2061 and VX-950. The in vitro resistance mutations selected against either inhibitor resulted in a significant reduction in susceptibility to the inhibitor itself. However, the primary resistance mutations against BILN 2061 were fully susceptible to VX-950, and the major resistance mutation against VX-950 remained sensitive to BILN 2061. Plasmid Construction—A DNA fragment encoding residues Ala1–Ser181 of the HCV NS3 protease (GenBank™ CAB46913) was obtained by PCR from the HCV Con1 replicon plasmid, I377neo/NS3–3′/wt (renamed as pBR322-HCV-Neo in this study) (10Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar) and inserted into pBEV11 2S. Chamber, personal communication. for expression of the HCV proteins with a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag in Escherichia coli. Resistance mutations against the HCV NS3·4A PI were introduced into this construct by PCR-based, site-directed mutagenesis. To generate the HCV replicon containing the PI-resistant mutations, a 1.2-kb HindIII/BstXI fragment derived from the HCV Con1 replicon was subcloned into a TA cloning vector, pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The PI-resistant mutations in the NS3 serine protease domain were introduced into the pCR2.1 vector containing the HindIII/BstXI HCV fragment by PCR, and a 579-bp BsrGI/BstXI fragment containing the mutated residue was subcloned back into a second generation Con1 replicon plasmid containing three adaptive mutations, pBR322-HCV-Neo-mADE (see below). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Generation of HCV Replicon Cells—The Con1 subgenomic replicon plasmid, pBR322-HCV-Neo, was digested with ScaI (New England Biolabs). Full-length HCV subgenomic replicon RNA was generated from the linearized DNA template using a T7 Mega-script kit (Ambion) and treated with DNase to remove the template DNA. The run-off RNA transcripts were electroporated into Huh-7 cells, and stable HCV replicon cell lines were selected with 0.25 or 1 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin) in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HCV replicon-stable cells were maintained in DMEM, 10% FBS, and 0.25 mg/ml G418. During the course of generation of the HCV subgenomic replicon stable cell lines, several different patterns of adaptive mutations were identified. One of these patterns contains three substitutions in the HCV nonstructural proteins, 3C. Lin, unpublished results. which were introduced into the original pBR322-HCV-Neo plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis to generate the second generation subgenomic replicon plasmid, pBR322-HCV-Neo-mADE. When the T7 run-off RNA transcripts from the ScaI-linearized pBR322-HCV-Neo-mADE plasmid were electroporated into Huh7 cells, stable replicon cell colonies were formed at a much higher efficiency than the original Con1 replicon RNA. The resistance mutations identified in this study were introduced into the pBR322-HCV-Neo-mADE replicon plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis. Stable replicon cell lines were generated using the T7 transcripts derived from either wild type pBR322-HCV-Neo-mADE or the ones with the resistance mutations. IC50 Determination of HCV PIs in the HCV Replicon Cell Assay— HCV Con1 subgenomic replicon cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 0.25 mg/ml G418. On the day prior to the assay, 10,000 HCV replicon cells/well were plated in a 96-well plate in DMEM plus 10% FBS. The next day, the medium was removed, and a compound serially diluted in DMEM, 2% FBS, and 0.5% Me2SO was added. The replicon cells were incubated with the compounds for 48 h. Total cellular RNA was extracted using RNeasy-96 (Qiagen), and the copy number of the HCV RNA was determined by a quantitative, real time RT-PCR (Taqman) assay. The cytotoxicity of the compounds was measured using a mitochondrial enzyme-based cell viability assay, CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). The IC50 and CC50 values of the compounds were calculated using four-parameter curve fitting (SoftMax Pro). Selection of HCV PI-resistant Replicon Cells—The HCV Con1 subgenomic replicon stable cells were serially passed in the presence of 0.25 mg/ml G418 and slowly increasing concentrations of VX-950 (series A) or BILN 2061 (series B). The concentrations of VX-950 ranged from 3.5 μm (or 10× IC50) in the 48-h assay (see above), to 28 μm (80× IC50). For BILN 2061, the starting concentration was 80 nm (80× IC50), and the final concentration was 12.5 μm (12,500× IC50). During the course of selection, replicon cells were split twice per week when a 70–90% confluence was reached. Fresh HCV PI was added every 3–4 days regardless of whether the cell culture was split. Identification of HCV PI Resistance Mutations—During the selection of HCV PI-resistant replicon cells, cell pellets were collected every time the cell culture was split. Total cellular RNA was extracted using the RNeasy miniprep kit (Qiagen). A 1.7-kb-long cDNA fragment encompassing the HCV NS3 serine protease region was amplified with a pair of HCV-specific oligonucleotides (5′-CCTTCTATCGCCTTCTTG-3′ and 5′-CTTGATGGTCTCGATGG-3′) using the Titan One-Step RT-PCR kit (Roche Applied Science). The amplified products were purified using the QIA-quick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). To monitor the emergence of the HCV PI-related mutations in the HCV NS3 serine protease domain during the selection, the purified 1.7-kb RT-PCR products of PI-treated replicons from several different culture time points were subjected to sequence determination. To determine the frequency of PI-resistant mutations, the 1.7-kb RT-PCR products of HCV RNA of the VX-950 or BILN 2061-resistant replicon cells were ligated into the TA cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). For each time point, multiple individual bacterial colonies were isolated, and the HCV NS3 protease coding region of the purified plasmid DNA was sequenced. Expression and Purification of the HCV NS3 Serine Protease Domain—Each of the expression constructs for the HCV NS3 serine protease domain containing the wild type sequence or the resistance mutations (A156S, D168V, or D168A) were transformed into BL21/DE3 pLysS E. coli cells (Stratagene). Freshly transformed cells were grown at 37 °C in a BHI medium (Difco) supplemented with 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol to an optical density of 0.75 at 600 nm. Induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was performed for 4 h at 24 °C. Cell pastes were harvested by centrifugation and flash frozen at -80 °C prior to protein purification. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. For each of the HCV NS3 proteases, 100 g of cell paste was lysed in 1.5 liters of buffer A (50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol) and stirred for 30 min. The lysates were homogenized using a microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Newton, MA), followed by ultracentrifugation at 54,000 × g for 45 min. Imidazole was added to the supernatants to a final concentration of 5 mm along with 2 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin pre-equilibrated with buffer A containing 5 mm imidazole. The mixtures were rocked for 3 h and washed with 20 column volumes of buffer A plus 5 mm imidazole. The HCV NS3 proteins were eluted in buffer A containing 300 mm imidazole. The eluates were concentrated and loaded onto a Hi-Load 16/60 Superdex 200 column, pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The appropriate fractions of the purified HCV proteins were pooled and stored at -80 °C. Enzymatic Assays for the HCV NS3 Serine Protease Domain—Enzymatic activity was determined using a modification of the assay described by Taliani et al. (27Taliani M. Bianchi E. Narjes F.

An internally quenched fluorogenic depsipeptide (FRET substrate), Ac-DED(EDANS)EEαAbuΨ[COO]ASK (DABCYL)-NH2, was purchased from AnaSpec Inc. (San Jose, CA). The assay was run in a continuous mode in a 96-well microtiter plate format. The buffer was composed of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 μm KK4A peptide (KKGSVVIVGRIVLSGK). The KK4A peptide represents the central region of the NS4A cofactor from genotype 1a with lysine residues added for improved solubility (28Landro J.A. Raybuck S.A. Luong Y.-C. O'Malley E.T. Harbeson S.L. Morgenstern K.A. Rao G. Livingston D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9340-9348Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by the addition of the FRET substrate after a 10-min preincubation of the buffer components with a 2 nm concentration of the NS3 protease at room temperature. The reaction was monitored at 30 °C for 20 min using a Molecular Devices fmax fluorometric plate reader. The filters for excitation and emission wavelengths were 355 and 495 nm, respectively. For determination of substrate kinetic parameters, concentrations of the FRET peptide were varied from 0.5 to 7.0 μm. Intermolecular quenching was not observed in this range. The substrate kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax, were determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Inhibition constants (Ki) were determined by titration of enzyme activity using the assay described above, except that compound dissolved in Me2SO (no greater than 2% (v/v) Me2SO; solvent only was used as control) was added to the buffer components and enzyme after the initial 10-min preincubation as described above. This mixture was incubated for an additional 15 min at room temperature prior to an incubation with the FRET substrate for another 20 min at 30 °C. Seven or eight concentrations of compound were assayed, and the resulting data were fitted to the integrated form of Morrison's equation for tight binding inhibition (29Morrison J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 185: 269-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). All substrate and inhibitor data were fitted using Marquardt-Levenberg nonlinear regression with GraphPad Prism software. Modeling—VX-950 and BILN 2061 were modeled into the active site of the NS3 serine protease domain using the crystal structure of a full-length HCV NS3 protein fused with a NS4A polypeptide, which was published by Yao et al. (30Yao N. Reichert P. Taremi S.S. Prosise W.W. Weber P.C. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: 1353-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (367) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1CU1). The coordinates of the protease domain of the A segment in this structure showed that the C-terminal strand of the NS3 protein binds in the substrate-binding site of the protease. The terminal carboxyl group of this strand is located near active site residues (His57, Asp81, and Ser139) such that it forms hydrogen bonds with the side chains of His57 and Ser139 as well as the backbone amides of residues 137 and 139, which form the oxyanion hole. Additionally, the last six residues (residues 626–631) of the NS3 protein form an extended, antiparallel β strand along the edge of the E2 strand of the protease β barrel (31Love R.A. Parge H.E.

Cell. 1996; 87: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) and makes 12 backbone-to-backbone hydrogen bonds. A product-based inhibitor like BILN 2061 is expected to bind to the NS3 protease in a similar fashion. Therefore, we utilized the coordinates of this crystal structure to build our models of inhibitor-protease co-complexes. BILN 2061 molecule was built using QUANTA molecular modeling software (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA), and manually docked into the active site such that its carboxyl group overlays with the C-terminal carboxylate of the full-length NS3 protein. The inhibitor molecule was then rotated such that it makes all of the following backbone hydrogen bonds: P1 NH with Arg155 carbonyl, P3 carbonyl with Ala157 NH, and P3 NH with Ala157 carbonyl. This mode of binding placed the large P2 group of the BILN 2061 in direct clash with the Arg155 side chain. To avoid the clash, the Arg155 side chain was modeled in an extended conformation, which was observed in a crystal structure of NS3 protease complexed with a close analogue of BILN 2061 (32Tsantrizos Y.S. Bolger G. Bonneau P. Cameron D.R. Goudreau N. Kukolj G. LaPlante S.R. Llinas-Brunet M. Nar H. Lamarre D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 1356-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The inhibitor was energy-minimized in two stages. In the first stage, only the inhibitor and the side-chain atoms of Arg123, Arg155, and Asp168 of the protease were allowed to move during energy minimization for 1000 steps. In the second stage, all of the side-chain atoms of the protease were allowed to move along with the inhibitor for 1000 additional steps. This modeled structure closely mimics the published structure of the BILN 2061 analog (32Tsantrizos Y.S. Bolger G. Bonneau P. Cameron D.R. Goudreau N. Kukolj G. LaPlante S.R. Llinas-Brunet M. Nar H. Lamarre D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 1356-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A similar procedure was adopted for modeling VX-950 into the NS3 protease active site. VX-950 was modeled as a covalent adduct with si-face attachment of the Ser139 side chain to the keto carbonyl of the inhibitor. This binding mode was observed for analogous ketoamide inhibitors (33Perni R.B. Pitlik J. Britt S.D. Court J.C. Courtney L.F. Deininger D.D. Farmer L.J. Gates C.A. Harbeson S.L. Levin R.B. Lin C. Lin K. Moon Y.-C. Luong Y.P. O'Malley E.T. Rao B.G. Thomson J.A. Tung R.D. Van Drie J.H. Wei Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 1441-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and ketoacid inhibitors (34Di Marco S. Rizzi M. Volpari C. Walsh M.A. Narjes F. Colarusso S. De Francesco R. Matassa V.G. Sollazzo M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7152-7157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The main chain of the inhibitor was overlaid with residues 626–631 of the C-terminal strand of the full-length NS3 protein such that it makes all of the following backbone hydrogen bonds: P1 NH with Arg155 carbonyl, P3 carbonyl with Ala157 NH, P3 NH with Ala157 carbonyl, and P4 cap carbonyl with NH of Cys159. In this binding mode, the P2 group of VX-950 was placed in the S2 pocket without any need to move the Arg155 side chain. The t-butyl and the cyclohexyl groups were placed in S3 and S4 pockets, respectively. To be consistent, we used the same two-stage energy minimization protocol used for the BILN 2061 model. The side chain of Asp168 is exposed to solvent. The valine side chain of the D168V mutant can adopt three canonical conformations with χ1 = 60, -60, or 180°. All three orientations of the Val168 side chain were modeled. The interaction energy of the D168V mutant enzyme and the inhibitor was minimized by allowing the inhibitor and Val168 atoms to move while fixing positions of all of the other atoms of the protein molecule. In all cases, the Val168 side chain does not cause any steric clash with the inhibitor atoms. The serine mutation at Ala156 was modeled by the following procedure. The Ala156 side chain is in van der Waals contact with the P2 group of both of the inhibitors. The serine side chain of the A156S mutant was modeled at three canonical conformations of χ1 = 60, -60, and 180°, and the energy was minimized by holding the conformation of the rest of the protein fixed. These models were used to examine the effects of this mutation on inhibitor binding. The -60° conformation was found to have the lowest energy as it forms a hydrogen bond with the neighboring Arg155 carbonyl, but it causes the maximal number of unfavorable contacts with both inhibitors. The 60 and 180° conformations are energetically equivalent, but the 60° conformation has fewer unfavorable contacts and was used in our analysis.

VX-950 is a reversible, covalent inhibitor of the HCV NS3·4A serine protease. Although competitive with the peptide substrate in the active site, it exhibits apparent noncompetitive inhibition as a result of its tight binding properties and time-dependent inhibition mechanism. 4C. A. Gate and Y.-P. Luong, unpublished data. Incubation of the HCV Con1 subgenomic replicon cells with VX-950 resulted in a concentration-dependent decline of the HCV RNA level, as measured by the real time RT-PCR (Taqman) method (Fig. 2B). The IC50 value of VX-950 is 354 nm in the 48-h assay.Fig. 2Development of VX-950-resistant replicon cells. A, HCV Con1 subgenomic replicon cells were serially passed in the presence of G418 and increasing concentrations of VX-950. Replicon cells were split, and fresh VX-950 was added to medium twice a week, as indicated by filled diamonds. The open rectangle indicates the time period in which the replicon cells had little or no overall growth accompanied by a concurrent massive cell death. Total cellular RNA of replicon cells at various time points (indicated by open arrows) during the resistance selection was extracted and the RT-PCR product covering the HCV NS3 serine protease was sequenced either directly or after being subcloned into the TA vector. B, dose-dependent inhibition of the wild type (filled triangle) or the series A (VX-950-resistant) (open circle) replicon cells at day 56 by VX-950 was shown. HCV RNA level was determined after 48-h incubation with VX-950.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify VX-950 resistance mutations, the Con1 subgenomic replicon cells were serially passed in the presence of 0.25 mg/ml G418 and slowly increasing concentrations of VX-950 (series A) (Fig. 2A). The starting concentration of VX-950 was 3.5 μm, or 10 times the IC50, and the highest concentration was 28 μm, or 80 times the IC50. Replicon cells were split, or the medium was replenished every 3 or 4 days, and fresh VX-950 was added. Since a HCV NS3 serine protease inhibitor, such as VX-950, inhibits the HCV polyprotein processing and consequently blocks replication of HCV RNA, the steady state level of HCV proteins and neomycin transferase protein gradually declined and eventually became undetectable in the presence of high concentrations of VX"

Despite decades of progress in animal models of listeriosis, much remains unknown about the processes of infection and colonization. Here, we report that L. monocytogenes can replicate in the murine gall bladder and provide evidence that its replication there is extracellular and intraluminal. In vivo bioluminescence imaging was employed to determine the location of the infection over time in live animals, revealing strong signals from the gall bladder over a period of several days, in diseased as well as asymptomatic animals.

https://openalex.org/W2135803007,"Cancer cells are more susceptible to chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptosis than their normal counterparts. Although it has been demonstrated that the increased sensitivity results from deregulation of oncoproteins during cancer development (Evan, G. I., and Vousden, K. H. (2001) Nature 411, 342–348; Green, D. R., and Evan, G. I. (2002) Cancer Cell 1, 19–30), little is known about the signaling pathways leading to changes in the apoptotic threshold in cancer cells. Here we show that low RKIP expression levels in tumorigenic human prostate and breast cancer cells are rapidly induced upon chemotherapeutic drug treatment, sensitizing the cells to apoptosis. We show that the maximal RKIP expression correlates perfectly with the onset of apoptosis. In cancer cells resistant to DNA-damaging agents, treatment with the drugs does not up-regulate RKIP expression. However, ectopic expression of RKIP resensitizes DNA-damaging agent-resistant cells to undergo apoptosis. This sensitization can be reversed by up-regulation of survival pathways. Down-regulation of endogenous RKIP by expression of antisense and small interfering RNA (siRNA) confers resistance on sensitive cancer cells to anticancer drug-induced apoptosis.

The very process of deregulated oncogene expression during cancer development also sensitizes cancer cells to apoptotic signals (1Evan G.I. Vousden K.H.

Here we show that cancer cells can also be sensitized to apoptosis by up-regulating the expression levels of RKIP (Raf kinase inhibitor protein). RKIP was originally identified as an interacting partner of Raf-1 and a negative regulator of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade initiated by Raf-1 (8Yeung K. Seitz T. Li S. Janosch P.

RKIP also inhibits nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) 1The abbreviations used are: NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; 9NC, 9-nitrocamptothecin; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; 7-AAD, 7-amino-actinomycin D; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; Z-VAD-FMK, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; 9NC, 9-nitrocamptothecin; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; 7-AAD, 7-amino-actinomycin D; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; Z-VAD-FMK, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. signaling by negatively modulating the activating phosphorylation of IKKα and IKKβ via upstream kinases (9Yeung K.C.

Although the molecular mechanism by which RKIP inhibits the Raf and NF-κB signaling pathways has been partially delineated, little is known about the biological relevance of the inhibition of these pathways by RKIP. In addition to these functions, we presently demonstrate the rapid up-regulation of RKIP during induction of chemotherapy-triggered apoptosis in human prostate and breast cancer cells. However, in DNA-damaging agent-resistant cancer cells, treatment with the drugs does not up-regulate RKIP expression. Ectopic expression of RKIP sensitizes DNA damage agent-resistant cells to undergo apoptosis. Down-regulation of RKIP expression confers resistance to 9-nitrocamptothecin (9NC) by releasing its inhibitory constraint on two major survival pathways in cancer cells. Our studies suggest that RKIP represents a novel apoptotic marker in human cancer cells.

Forty to 48 h after transfection, both adherent and floating cells were collected for analyses. A Renilla luciferase gene (Promega) driven by the constitutive thymidine kinase promoter was included in all transfection experiments as an internal control to correct for transfection efficiency. Dual luciferase assays were performed using a kit obtained from Promega. Immunoblot Analyses—Total cell extracts were prepared as described previously (11Chatterjee D. Schmitz I. Krueger A. Yeung K.

Immunohistochemistry of Human Tissue—Radical prostatectomy specimens were obtained at the time of surgery from prostate cancer patients at the University of Michigan and frozen in liquid nitrogen within 30 min after surgical excision as described previously (12Rashid M.G. Sanda M.G. Vallorosi C.J. Rios-Doria J. Rubin M.A. Day M.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 489-492PubMed Google Scholar). Histological confirmation of both tumor and normal regions of each prostate gland and tumor grading were performed as described previously (13Rubin M.A. Zhou M. Dhanasekaran S.M. Varambally S.

Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, and all tissue procurement was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. Frozen tissue blocks were sectioned on a cryostat, and frozen sections were placed on slides, which were immersed in acetone at 4 °C for 15 min and air dried for 30 s and then stored in phosphate-buffered saline until immunostaining was performed. RKIP protein expression was detected using a rabbit polyclonal anti-RKIP antibody (1:400 dilution; Upstate Biotechnology) followed by the streptavidin-biotin method, which included horseradish peroxidase and diaminobenzidine chromogen (Histostain Kit; Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Immunostaining intensity was scored by a urologist (Y. K.) blinded to Gleason score, tumor size, and clinical outcome as described previously (13Rubin M.A. Zhou M. Dhanasekaran S.M. Varambally S.

Briefly, the spectrum of staining intensity in all the samples was evaluated, and then each sample scored as negative (score 1), weak (score 2), moderate (score 3), or strong (score 4), based on the amount of stain detected. Cell Death/Survival Analyses—At various times after treatment with the indicated drugs, adherent and floating cells were collected for analysis. Apoptosis was assayed by staining the cells with annexin-V and 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) and quantified by a Guava personal cytometer (Guava, Burlingame, CA). Alternatively, total cell extracts were prepared and analyzed for both PARP and caspase-8 cleavage by immunoblotting. To determine fractions of apoptotic cells in transient transfection experiments, cells were co-transfected with a membrane-targeted EYFP expression plasmid (Clontech). Forty to 48 h after transfection, adherent and floating cells were stained with cy5-annexin V (Pharmingen). YFP- and annexin-V-positive cells were quantified by a Guava personal cytometer (Guava). For viable cell counting, 3 × 105 cells were transfected with a total of 2 μg of plasmid DNA, 0.2 μg of pCMV-LacZ, and 1.8 μg of effector plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent (Invitrogen). Forty to 48 h after transfection, the cells were fixed and stained with X-gal. Viable blue-stained cells, determined by their morphology, were counted from 20 randomly selected fields. Data are displayed as mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. Reverse Transcription-PCR Assays—DU145 cells were treated with 9NC for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated, and 1 μg was used for first-strand synthesis, which then served as a template for PCR reactions using a 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis kit purchased from Roche Applied Science. The RKIP PCR primers were as follows: hrkip1 (sense in exon 1), 5′-CCTCGCCATGCCGGTGGACC-3′; hrkip2 (antisense in exon 1), 5′-CCGCCGCCCCGGCGTAGGTG-3′; hrkip3 (sense in exon 2), 5′-GGATGCTCCCAGCAGGAAGG-3′; and hrkip4 (antisense in exon 3), 5′-CCTTGGGAGGCCCCGAGCCC-3′. The β-actin PCR primers were 5′-ATCTGGCACCAGACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGCG-3′ and 5′-CGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGC-3′. The PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide.

Infected cells were cultured in puromycin selection medium for 3 days, and drug-resistant cells were pooled. The percentage of retrovirus-infected cells ranged from 60% to 80%, as estimated in parallel infections using retroviruses expressing green fluorescent protein. Expression of relevant genes was confirmed by immunoblotting.

Sci. 1996; 803: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 11Chatterjee D. Schmitz I. Krueger A. Yeung K. Kirchhoff S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Wyche J.H. Pantazis P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7148-7154PubMed Google Scholar). 9NC inhibits topoisomerase I, thereby introducing single-strand breaks into the DNA molecule (15Covey J.M. Jaxel C. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5016-5022PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis was measured by binding to 7-AAD and annexin-V (16Koopman G. Reutelingsperger C.P. Kuijten G.A. Keehnen R.M. Pals S.T. van Oers M.H. Blood. 1994; 84: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Schmid I. Krall W.J. Uittenbogaart C.H. Braun J. Giorgi J.V. Cytometry. 1992; 13: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), as well as by the cleavage of caspase-8 and PARP, a downstream physiological target of the caspase-8 cleavage cascade (Fig. 1a, left panel and b, top panels). In contrast, apoptosis was not induced in a 9NC-resistant DU145 subline, RC1, treated with 9NC concentrations up to 1 μm for 48 h (Fig. 1a, right panel and b, bottom panels). Because NF-κB is a regulator of apoptosis (18Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R94-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we analyzed both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of 9NC-treated DU145 and RC1 cells for NF-κB activation. NF-κB activity was consistently up-regulated, as indicated by increased expression of an NF-κB reporter and IκB degradation in 9NC-treated cells (Fig. 1c, right panel). No difference was detected in extracts from the DU145 cells before and after 9NC treatment (Fig. 1c, left panel). In acknowledgment of the anti-apoptotic effects of NF-κB, we reasoned that increased NF-κB activity might account for the resistant phenotype of RC1 cells to 9NC treatment. In agreement with this reasoning, inhibition of NF-κB activity by ectopic expression of IκB-SR, a super-repressor of NF-κB (19Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar, 20Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar) in RC1 cells, re-sensitized the cells to 9NC (Fig. 1e, top panels and f). Considering the inhibitory effects of RKIP on NF-κB signaling (9Yeung K.C. Rose D.W. Dhillon A.S. Yaros D. Gustafsson M. Chatterjee D. McFerran B. Wyche J. Kolch W. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7207-7217Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), we examined the expression of RKIP in these two cell lines before and after 9NC treatment. Comparable RKIP levels were detected in RC1 extracts prepared from cells before and after 9NC treatment, but RKIP expression was robustly increased in 9NC-treated DU145 cells (insets in Fig. 1c). To investigate whether the induction of RKIP expression resulted from a DNA damage response or was a consequence of apoptosis, we blocked 9NC-mediated apoptosis in DU145 cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (21Atkinson E.A. Barry M. Darmon A.J. Shostak I. Turner P.C. Moyer R.W. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21261-21266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As expected, inhibiting the activities of caspases, the major executors of apoptosis in mammalian cells, protected DU145 cells from apoptosis (Fig. 1g). Importantly, Z-VAD-FMK treatment did not block 9NC-induced RKIP expression, indicating that induction of RKIP was not the consequence of apoptosis (Fig. 1g). We have shown recently that unlike DU145 cells, RC1 cells contain a mutated topoisomerase I, and this has been associated with development of resistance to 9NC (22Urasaki Y. Laco G.S. Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Kohlhagen G. Gioffre C. Zhang H. Chatterjee D. Pantazis P. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1964-1969PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether 9NC introduces DNA strand breaks in RC1 cells, we monitored the extent of H2A.X phosphorylation with H2A.X phospho-specific antibodies. H2A.X is a histone variant, which is rapidly phosphorylated at serine 139 in response to DNA damage and is indicative of a cell committed to the apoptotic pathway (23Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar). After treatment with 9NC, the histone variant H2A.X was robustly phosphorylated in DU145 cells but remained unphosphorylated in RC1 cells (Fig. 1d). The data described above therefore suggest that RKIP is the downstream target of a DNA damage-mediated signaling pathway initiated by 9NC and that this pathway is defective in RC1 cells. The known protective effects of NF-κB, the strong induction of RKIP in the 9NC-treated DU145 cell line, and the loss of this effect in the RC1 cell line imply that one biological role of RKIP may be to exert a repressive effect on the NF-κB pathway in certain situations, allowing apoptosis to proceed. To assess whether RKIP was functionally linked to the apoptosis-resistant phenotype, we transfected RC1 cells with an RKIP expression vector and subsequently treated them with 9NC. Expression of RKIP re-sensitized the cells to 9NC-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 1, e and f). It is important to note that overexpression of neither RKIP nor IκB-SR alone fully induces apoptosis in RC1 cells (Fig. 1e, bottom panels). To determine whether induction of RKIP expression is chemotherapeutic agent-specific, we examined the effects of other DNA-damaging agents on DU145 cells. Both cisplatin and etoposide up-regulated RKIP expression and caused apoptosis in DU145 cells (Fig 2a and b). Remarkably, the onset of apoptosis, as indicated by percentage of apoptotic cells, coincided with a robust induction of RKIP expression (Fig. 2, a and b). The human prostate carcinoma cell lines PC3 and LNCaP were also investigated for RKIP expression after 9NC treatment. No significant changes were observed in LNCaP cells, but an increase in RKIP expression was readily observed in PC3 cells after 9NC treatment (Fig. 2c). We next investigated at which level the expression of RKIP was regulated. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated a significant increase of RKIP mRNA after challenge with 9NC (Fig. 2d). The observed difference in the amounts of RKIP mRNA in untreated versus treated cells was not the result of global alteration of gene expression because the level of the β-actin control was unchanged. Because RKIP expression was low in some prostate cancer cells in vitro, we decided to examine expression of RKIP in primary prostate tumors. The clinical relevance of RKIP expression to prostate cancer was evaluated by comparing RKIP protein expression in clinical samples of normal prostate with prostate cancer tissue. RKIP staining intensities were 4, 4, 4, 4, and 3 for five normal prostate samples and 2, 2, 2, 3, and 4 for five primary prostate tumors of Gleason score 5 or higher. A representative result is shown in Fig. 2e. These results demonstrate that RKIP staining intensity is decreased in primary prostate tumors compared with normal prostate. To examine whether up-regulation of RKIP is the cause or consequence of DNA damage-induced apoptosis in DU145 cells, we simultaneously monitored RKIP expression and extent of apoptosis at various times after 9NC treatment, as measured by the cleavage of PARP and binding to 7-AAD/annexin-V. Although substantial cleavage of PARP was detected as early as 12 h after 9NC treatment, it required 24 h of treatment for a significant portion of the cell population to stain positive for both 7-AAD and annexin-V, entering the final stage of apoptosis (Fig. 3, a and b). Consistent with a causal role of RKIP in 9NC-induced apoptosis, the peak RKIP expression preceded the onset of extensive apoptosis (Fig. 3, a and b). Furthermore, overexpression of RKIP in DU145 cells could induce apoptosis almost as efficiently as t-Bid, a constitutively activated pro-apoptotic molecule (24Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was measured using various approaches, including counting the number of viable cells, monitoring the extent of cleavage of caspase-8 and PARP, and evaluating binding to annexin-V (Fig. 3, c-e). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that RKIP is the cause of 9NC-mediated apoptosis in DU145 cells. We reasoned that if RKIP is the cause of apoptosis in DU145 cells, then we should be able to protect these cells from apoptosis by blocking the 9NC-triggered increase in RKIP expression. Indeed, down-regulation of RKIP expression by antisense RKIP expression vector and RKIP small interfering RNA blocked 9NC-induced apoptosis in DU145 as measured by PARP cleavage and by the number of viable cells (Fig. 3, f-h). The NF-κB and Raf signal pathways are both important in determining cell survival in many different cell types (18Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R94-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Muenchen H.J. Lin D.L. Walsh M.A. Keller E.T. Pienta K.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1969-1977PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sovak M.A. Bellas R.E. Kim D.W. Zanieski G.J. Rogers A.E. Traish A.M. Sonenshein G.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2952-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 27Murakami M.S. Morrison D.K. Science's STKE. 2001; http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2000/53/pe1PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of these signaling pathways in DU145 cell survival was investigated by a loss-of-function approach. We interfered with the NF-κB and Raf signaling pathways in DU145 cells by ectopically expressing either IκB-SR or a dominant-negative mutant of Raf (RafDN) (28Kolch W. Heidecker G. Lloyd P. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 426-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). As expected, we observed inhibition of an NF-κB reporter and down-regulation of the Raf signaling pathway as measured by MEK dephosphorylation in IκB-SR- or RafDN mutant-transfected cells (data not shown). Importantly, down-regulation of either pathway was accompanied by an increase in apoptosis as measured by a reduction in the number of viable cells (Fig. 4a). It is also noteworthy that the pro-apoptotic effects of either IκB-SR or RafDN are comparable with that of the well-characterized pro-apoptotic protein t-Bid in DU145 cells (Fig. 4a). Conversely, ectopic expression of the activated Raf (Raf-CAAX) by retroviral transduction partially protected the DU145 cells from 9NC-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4b, row 2). The survival-promoting effects of Raf-CAAX are comparable with that of ectopic expression of CrmA, a known inhibitor of caspase-8 (Fig. 4b, row 6) (29Zhou Q. Snipas S. Orth K. Muzio M. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7797-7800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, expression of p65 or p52 either failed to protect or minimally protected the DU145 cells from apoptosis (Fig. 4b, rows 3 and 4). We speculate that the failure is probably because neither p65 nor p52 is constitutively active. In addition, we observed that the expression levels obtained with retroviral transduction are not as high as transient expression driven by cytomegalovirus promoter (data not shown). None-theless, the expression of p65 augmented the survival effects of activated Raf, resulting in the total protection of cells from apoptosis (Fig. 4b, row 5), and thus supports our argument that NF-κB is an important survival factor in DU145 cells. We next investigated the possibility that RKIP induces apoptosis by antagonizing either one of the two survival pathways. As shown in Fig. 4, c and d, RKIP-induced apoptosis was relieved by overexpression of the p65 subunit of NF-κB or the constitutively active form of Raf (BXB). The effects of p65 and BXB on RKIP-induced apoptosis are not due to a lower RKIP expression in combined transfection because RKIP levels are similar as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 4d, bottom panel). This indicates that NF-κB as well as Raf up-regulation has an apoptosis-sparing effect. In agreement with our hypothesis that RKIP induces apoptosis by antagonizing Raf and NF-κB signaling, overexpression of RKIP in DU145 cells diminished the phosphorylation of both MEK and IκB-α (Fig. 4e). An aberrant up-regulation of NF-κB activity is often observed in breast cancer cell lines (30Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar, 31Rayet B. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts prepared from normal, untransformed breast epithelial 578Bst cells displayed low levels of NF-κB DNA binding activity, whereas elevated levels of activity were detected in extracts from the breast tumor cell line 578T (26Sovak M.A. Bellas R.E. Kim D.W. Zanieski G.J. Rogers A.E. Traish A.M. Sonenshein G.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2952-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Inhibition of this NF-κB activity by microinjection of IκB protein into breast cancer cell lines induced apoptosis (26Sovak M.A. Bellas R.E. Kim D.W. Zanieski G.J. Rogers A.E. Traish A.M. Sonenshein G.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2952-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Consistent with these studies, we also observed elevated levels of NF-κB activity as measured by the phosphorylation of IκB (Fig. 5a). In agreement with the observed inhibitory role of RKIP on NF-κB signaling (9Yeung K.C. Rose D.W. Dhillon A.S. Yaros D. Gustafsson M. Chatterjee D. McFerran B. Wyche J. Kolch W. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7207-7217Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), higher levels of NF-κB activity in 578T correlated with decreased expression of RKIP (Fig. 5a). The converse was observed in the normal cell line 578Bst (Fig. 5a). Consistent with the decreased levels of RKIP, the Raf signaling pathway was comparatively elevated in 578T, as measured by the activities of transcriptional factor AP-1 and phosphorylation of MEK (Fig. 5a). Next we determined whether the expression levels of RKIP could be up-regulated by DNA-damaging agents. Unlike the prostate cancer DU145 cells, RKIP protein expression in 578T did not change after treatment with the DNA-damaging drugs 9NC, cisplatin, and etoposide (Fig. 5c). Furthermore, 578T cells did not undergo apoptosis after 9NC treatment as indicated by the lack of PARP cleavage and binding to annexin-V (Fig. 5, b and c). The nonresponsiveness to DNA damage-induced apoptosis was not due to mutations in the apoptotic pathways in 578T cancer cells because apoptosis was induced by another pro-apoptotic drug, Taxol (Fig. 5, b and c). Finally, restoring the expression levels of RKIP by ectopic expression triggered apoptosis (Fig. 5d), comparable with that triggered by ectopically expressed IκB super-repressor IκB-SR (Fig. 5d, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 4 and 5). Similar results were observed with the MCF7 breast cancer cell line (Fig. 5, e-h). The underlying mechanism determining whether a cell will die after DNA damage is complex (32Rich T. Allen R.L. Wyllie A.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). However, it is known that the threshold for the activation of apoptosis in response to DNA damage is set lower in cancer cells than in their normal counterparts (1Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2612) Google Scholar, 2Green D.R. Evan G.I. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 19-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 3Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). Although it is axiomatic that the pro-apoptotic trait of cancer cells results from activation of oncogenes, the effectors through which oncoproteins generate sensitivity to apoptosis remain elusive (4Fearnhead H.O. Rodriguez J. Govek E.E. Guo W. Kobayashi R. Hannon G. Lazebnik Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13664-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Here we show that RKIP expression levels are low in prostate cancer cells and increase after DNA damage. The direct correlation of RKIP expression with the extent of apoptosis raises the possibility that up-regulation of RKIP is one of the mechanisms that sensitizes cancer cells to apoptotic signals in response to DNA damage. Four lines of evidence support a causal role for RKIP. First, we observed a direct correlation among the expression levels of RKIP, the tumorigenic ability of cells when xenografted in thymus-less (nude) mice, and the sensitivity of cancer cells to DNA damage-mediated apoptosis. Both DU145 and PC3 cells are tumorigenic in nude mice and have a low level of RKIP expression, which can be significantly induced to high levels after DNA damage. In contrast, non-tumorigenic LNCaP cells have a comparatively high level of RKIP expression. After DNA damage, the RKIP expression levels in LNCaP cells remained unchanged, and the cells went into growth arrest, whereas RKIP expression levels in PC3 and DU145 cells robustly increased, and the cells traversed rapidly from G1 to S, followed by extensive cell death. Second, 9NC-resistant prostate cancer RC1 cells, whose RKIP expression levels did not change upon DNA damage, were re-sensitized to undergo 9NC-triggered apoptosis after RKIP overexpression. This raises the possibility of using RKIP overexpression as a mean to overcome resistance to 9NC in RC1 cells (33Pantazis P. Han Z. Balan K. Wang Y. Wyche J.H. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 3623-3638PubMed Google Scholar). Third, the ectopic expression of RKIP-induced apoptosis in the absence of apoptotic signals in DU145 cells. Fourth, down-regulation of RKIP expression protected DU145 cells from 9NC-induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, sensitization could be a direct consequence of increased death signaling. Alternatively, RKIP could sensitize cancer cells to apoptosis by inhibiting the Raf/MEK/ERK and NF-κB survival signaling pathways. Although the two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, several lines of evidence presented in this communication strongly suggest the indirect model. We have shown that both Raf/MEK/ERK and NF-κB are important survival signaling pathways in DU145 cells. Down-regulation of either pathway can induce apoptosis. Conversely, up-regulation of both pathways completely protected DU145 from 9NC-induced apoptosis. Also, up-regulation of either pathway diminished the extent of apoptosis induced by RKIP. It remains to be determined whether RKIP also plays a direct role in inducing apoptosis in DU145 cells. Is the sensitization effect of RKIP toward DNA damage-mediated apoptosis specific to prostate carcinoma cells? Our studies with the breast cancer cell lines 578T and MCF7 showed that the expression level of RKIP was low and underwent minimal changes upon DNA damage. In agreement with the role of RKIP in inducing apoptosis, very little cell death occurred after 2 days of incubation with DNA-damaging drugs at concentrations that caused extensive apoptosis in DU145 cells. Both 578T and MCF7 cells expeditiously succumbed to apoptosis after incubation with Taxol, an anti-cancer drug with a mode of action quite different from those described for DNA-damaging drugs. Therefore, our observations in breast cancer cells are consistent with our hypothesis that RKIP plays an important role in apoptosis and suggest that the expression of RKIP can be regulated by more than one pathway after apoptotic insults. We also demonstrated that restoring normal RKIP levels in breast cancer cells by ectopic expression triggers spontaneous apoptosis. The capacity to suppress apoptosis is one of the essential acquired attributes in cancer cells. Up-regulation of survival signaling is one of the common strategies a cancer cell exploits. Previous studies by others (30Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar, 31Rayet B. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar), together with the findings described in this communication, show that NF-κB and the activated Raf are two of the major determinants of survival in breast cancer cells. In view of its previously demonstrated inhibitory activity toward NF-κB and Raf signaling, we speculate that down-regulation of RKIP is one of the strategies breast cancer cells employ to evade oncogene-induced apoptosis. In this study, we have shown a correlation between the expression levels of RKIP and tumorigenicity in prostate and breast cancer cells. Consistent with studies of cancer cell lines in vitro, we have also shown that the expression levels of RKIP decrease in primary prostate tumors compared with normal prostate tissue. In line with our studies, Fu et al. (34Fu Z. Smith P.C. Zhang L. Rubin M.A. Dunn R.L. Yao Z. Keller E.T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2003; 95: 878-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) have recently reported that RKIP is a clinically relevant and novel suppressor of prostate cancer cell metastasis. Their study demonstrates that low levels of RKIP expression correlate with increased metastatic potential. Taken together with our data, it is tempting to speculate that the metastatic potential of tumor cells could be prevented by chemotherapy-triggered induction of RKIP, which would lead to apoptosis in target cells. The expression of RKIP could represent a useful marker of response to relevant chemotherapeutic agents and eventually be implemented in a molecular-targeted therapeutic strategy for prostate and other cancers. Finally, we have shown that some cancer cells, when subjected to an apoptotic insult, have the ability to up-regulate RKIP expression and become sensitive to apoptosis. Under these conditions of intact RKIP expression, only the further acquisition of genetic lesions, as observed in RC1 cells and some breast cancer cells, will allow survival and further malignant progression. Unlike other classical tumor suppressor genes, which usually have complete loss-of-function mutations in tumor cells, the expression levels of RKIP are decreased or become non-inducible, but they are always detectable. The presence of active RKIP in cancer cells will therefore allow the isolation of agonist drugs that increase the interaction between RKIP and its targets. The identification of signaling pathways that regulate RKIP expression will also expedite the design of effective therapy for patients with cancers refractory to chemotherapeutic treatments. In summary, we hypothesize that RKIP may function as a tumor suppressor gene in the development of human prostate and breast cancer. The expression of RKIP may represent a novel prognostic marker in the evolution of cancer and provides a therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2160618865,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are critical for development, wound healing, and for the progression of cancer. It is generally accepted that MMPs are secreted in a latent form (proMMP) and are activated only upon removal of their inhibitory propeptides. This report shows that three members of the SIBLING (Small, Integrin-Binding LIgand, N-linked Glycoprotein) family can specifically bind (Kd approximately equal nM) and activate three different MMPs. Binding of SIBLING to their corresponding proMMPs is associated with structural changes as indicated by quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, increased susceptibility to plasmin cleavage, and decreased inhibition by specific natural and synthetic inhibitors. Activation includes both making the proMMPs enzymatically active and the reactivation of the TIMP (tissue inhibitors of MMP) inhibited MMPs. Bone sialoprotein specifically binds proMMP-2 and active MMP-2, while osteopontin binds proMMP-3 and active MMP-3, and dentin matrix protein-1 binds proMMP-9 and active MMP-9. Both pro and active MMP-SIBLING complexes are disrupted by the abundant serum protein, complement Factor H, thereby probably limiting SIBLING-mediated activation to regions immediately adjacent to sites of secretion in vivo. These data suggest that the SIBLING family offers an alternative method of controlling the activity of at least three MMPs."

Behavioral observations revealed a hypokinetic period in rats sacrificed at 3 and 5 days, and dystonic episodes in animals sacrificed at 8 days. Less than 20% of the total number of animals given rotenone depicted brain lesions after 8 days of treatment, as demonstrated by a significant loss of DA fibers in the striatum, but not of DA nigral neurons. Tyrosine hydroxylase-negative striatal territories were characterized by post-synaptic toxicity as demonstrated by a decreased number of interneurons labeled for choline acetyltransferase, NADPH-diaphorase, parvalbumin, and projection neurons labeled for calbindin and nerve growth factor inducible-B (NGFI-B). Post-synaptic neurodegeneration was demonstrated further by abundant striatal staining for Fluoro-Jade. Decrease in the nuclear orphan receptor Nurr1 expression was the only significant change observed at the level of the substantia nigra. Autopsy reports confirmed that animals suffered from severe digestion problems. These data suggest that hypokinesia observed between 3 and 5 days is the result of general health problems rather than a specific motor deficit associated to Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms. Overall, the effects of rotenone toxicity are widespread, and subcutaneous administration of this toxin does not provide the neuropathological and behavioral basis for a relevant and reliable PD model."

https://openalex.org/W2130232098,"The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) is involved in the regulation of cell death, but its role in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha- and Fas-mediated apoptosis in primary cells is not well defined. In primary rat hepatocytes expressing an IkappaB superrepressor, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 strongly decreased TNF-alpha-induced cell death, caspase 3 activation, and DNA laddering. In contrast, SP600125 did not rescue mouse hepatocytes from Fas-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis in mouse hepatocytes, induced by human TNF-alpha, was blocked by SP600125, indicating that TNF-receptor (TNF-R) 1-mediated JNK activation is important for TNF-alpha-induced death. However, mouse TNF-alpha was more efficient than human TNF-alpha in activating JNK and killing mouse hepatocytes, suggesting that TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 cooperate in JNK activation and apoptosis. SP600125 rescued actinomycin D-pretreated hepatocytes and hepatocytes expressing a dominant negative c-Jun from TNF-alpha, indicating that JNK exerts its proapoptotic effect independently of transcription and c-Jun. SP600125 delayed the mitochondrial permeability transition, inhibited cytochrome c release and prevented bid degradation after TNF-alpha, suggesting that JNK-regulated proapoptotic factors act upstream of the mitochondria. Moreover, overexpression of JNK1 activated a mitochondrial death pathway in hepatocytes, albeit less efficiently than TNF-alpha. This study demonstrates that JNK augments TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes through a signaling pathway that is distinct from the pathway by which it regulates proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2047989123,"Surfactant protein B (SP-B) is an essential constituent of pulmonary surfactant. SP-B is synthesized in alveolar type II cells as a preproprotein and processed to the mature peptide by the cleavage of NH2- and COOH-terminal peptides. An aspartyl protease has been suggested to cleave the NH2-terminal propeptide resulting in a 25-kDa intermediate. Napsin, an aspartyl protease expressed in alveolar type II cells, was detected in fetal lung homogenates as early as day 16 of gestation, 1 day before the onset of SP-B expression and processing. Napsin was localized to multivesicular bodies, the site of SP-B proprotein processing in type II cells. Incubation of SP-B proprotein from type II cells with a crude membrane extract from napsin-transfected cells resulted in enhanced levels of a 25-kDa intermediate. Purified napsin cleaved a recombinant SP-B/EGFP fusion protein within the NH2-terminal propeptide between Leu178 and Pro179, 22 amino acids upstream of the NH2 terminus of mature SP-B. Cathepsin H, a cysteine protease also implicated in pro-SP-B processing, cleaved SP-B/EGFP fusion protein 13 amino acids upstream of the NH2 terminus of mature SP-B. Napsin did not cleave the COOH-terminal peptide, whereas cathepsin H cleaved the boundary between mature SP-B and the COOH-terminal peptide and at several other sites within the COOH-terminal peptide. Knockdown of napsin by small interfering RNA resulted in decreased levels of mature SP-B and mature SP-C in type II cells. These results suggest that napsin, cathepsin H, and at least one other enzyme are involved in maturation of the biologically active SP-B peptide. Surfactant protein B (SP-B) is an essential constituent of pulmonary surfactant. SP-B is synthesized in alveolar type II cells as a preproprotein and processed to the mature peptide by the cleavage of NH2- and COOH-terminal peptides. An aspartyl protease has been suggested to cleave the NH2-terminal propeptide resulting in a 25-kDa intermediate. Napsin, an aspartyl protease expressed in alveolar type II cells, was detected in fetal lung homogenates as early as day 16 of gestation, 1 day before the onset of SP-B expression and processing. Napsin was localized to multivesicular bodies, the site of SP-B proprotein processing in type II cells. Incubation of SP-B proprotein from type II cells with a crude membrane extract from napsin-transfected cells resulted in enhanced levels of a 25-kDa intermediate. Purified napsin cleaved a recombinant SP-B/EGFP fusion protein within the NH2-terminal propeptide between Leu178 and Pro179, 22 amino acids upstream of the NH2 terminus of mature SP-B. Cathepsin H, a cysteine protease also implicated in pro-SP-B processing, cleaved SP-B/EGFP fusion protein 13 amino acids upstream of the NH2 terminus of mature SP-B. Napsin did not cleave the COOH-terminal peptide, whereas cathepsin H cleaved the boundary between mature SP-B and the COOH-terminal peptide and at several other sites within the COOH-terminal peptide. Knockdown of napsin by small interfering RNA resulted in decreased levels of mature SP-B and mature SP-C in type II cells. These results suggest that napsin, cathepsin H, and at least one other enzyme are involved in maturation of the biologically active SP-B peptide. Surfactant protein B (SP-B) 1The abbreviations used are: SP-B, surfactant protein B; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; siRNA, small interfering RNA; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. is a 79-amino acid, hydrophobic peptide associated with surfactant phospholipids in the alveolar airspaces of the lung (1Weaver T.E.

Acta. 1998; 1408: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). SP-B facilitates the formation and maintenance of a phospholipid-rich film (pulmonary surfactant) along the alveolar epithelial surface. Targeted disruption of the SP-B locus in mice results in altered surfactant structure and function, leading to respiratory failure within minutes of birth (3Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J.

Similarly, hereditary SP-B deficiency in human infants leads to postnatal respiratory failure that is invariably fatal even with surfactant replacement therapy (5Nogee L.M. deMello D.E. Dehner L.P.

Acute SP-B deficiency in the adult lung that results in a decrease of SP-B concentration by 75–80% in the alveolar airspaces also leads to lethal respiratory failure (8Melton K.R. Nesslein L.L.

Collectively, these data indicate that SP-B is absolutely required for postnatal lung function and survival (9Cole F.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L540-L542Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). SP-B is synthesized as a preproprotein by alveolar type II epithelial cells and non-ciliated bronchiolar (Clara) cells in the lung; however complete processing of the precursor to the biologically active mature peptide occurs only in type II cells (10Lin S.

The proprotein traffics through the secretory pathway of the type II cell to the multivesicular body/late endosome compartment where sequential cleavage of the NH2- and COOH-terminal peptide domains results in generation of the mature peptide (11O'Reilly M.A. Weaver T.E.

There is also some evidence that processing of the proprotein may be initiated in the Golgi (15Korimilli A. Gonzales L.W. Guttentag S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8672-8679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Pro-SP-B processing is complex and may involve multiple enzymes and cleavage sites. Proteolytic cleavage of the NH2-terminal propeptide was reported previously to be mediated by an aspartyl protease (16Weaver T.E. Lin S. Bogucki B. Dey C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L95-L103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A novel aspartyl protease with a very restricted expression pattern was reported recently to be localized predominantly to type II cells in the lung and proximal tubule cells of the kidney (17Mori K.

The gene encoding this protease, variously referred to as napsin A, kidney-derived aspartic protease-like protein, or TAO2 (herein referred to as napsin), clusters with other type II cell genes in which expression is significantly up-regulated in pulmonary adenocarcinomas (21Chuman Y.

Importantly, expression of napsin was shown to be regulated by TTF-1, a phosphorylated member of the Nkx2 family of homeodomain-containing transcription factors that also regulates the lung-specific expression of SP-B (24DeFelice M. Silberschmidt D. DiLauro R. Xu Y. Wert S.E. Weaver T.E. Bachurski C.J. Clark J.C. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35574-35583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Mice homozygous for a mutant hypophosphorylation TTF-1 allele (Titf1PM/PM) expressed lower levels of mature SP-B peptide and increased levels of proprotein. Consistent with an SP-B processing defect, expression of the gene encoding napsin was down-regulated by ∼21-fold in Titf1PM/PM mice and was associated with neonatal lethality (24DeFelice M. Silberschmidt D. DiLauro R. Xu Y. Wert S.E. Weaver T.E. Bachurski C.J. Clark J.C. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35574-35583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that napsin plays an important role in processing of the SP-B proprotein. Recently another enzyme, cathepsin H, was also implicated in the processing of the propeptide of SP-B (25Guttentag S. Robinson L. Zhang P. Brasch F. Buhling F. Beers M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 28: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The current study was therefore undertaken to directly assess the ability of napsin and cathepsin H to process the SP-B proprotein. Generation of Napsin Antibody—Type II cells were isolated from adult mouse lungs as described previously (26Rice W.R. Conkright J.J. Na C.L. Ikegami M. Shannon J.M. Weaver T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L256-L264Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and total RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed. PCR primers were designed based on the published mouse napsin DNA sequence (17Mori K. Ogawa Y. Tamura N. Ebihara K. Aoki T. Muro S. Ozaki S. Tanaka I. Tashiro K. Nakao K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Tatnell P.J. Cook M. Peters C. Kay J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6921-6930Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and napsin amplified from type II cell cDNA. The napsin cDNA was subsequently cloned into pET21 (Novagen) and then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Following induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 4 h, recombinant napsin was recovered by extraction of the bacterial pellet with 6 m guanidine in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl followed by NTA affinity chromatography, as described previously (28Holzinger A. Phillips K.S. Weaver T.E. BioTechniques. 1996; 20 (808): 804-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recombinant napsin was dialyzed against TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and injected into rabbits to generate polyclonal antisera as described previously (29Lin S. Phillips K.S. Wilder M.R. Weaver T.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The napsin antibody was characterized by Western blotting untransfected HEK293 cells or HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the cDNA encoding mouse or human napsin. The specificity of the immunoreaction was confirmed by absorption of the crude antiserum with recombinant napsin prior to Western blotting as described previously (29Lin S. Phillips K.S. Wilder M.R. Weaver T.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Fixed cryoprotected frozen lung and kidney tissues from adult mice were processed for immunogold labeling with napsin antibody and protein A gold as described previously in detail (13Voorhout W.F. Veenendaal T. Haagsman H.P. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. van Golde L.M. Geuze H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L479-L486PubMed Google Scholar). Generation and Purification of Human Napsin—Human napsin cDNA was cloned in pEGFP-N3 (Clontech). To generate an HA-tagged napsin cDNA (not fused with EGFP), PCR was performed using specific primers to human napsin, 5′ primer agc gct agc atg tct cca cca ccg ctg ct and 3′ primer (with a stop codon) cgc gaa ttc tca agc gta gtc tgg gac gtc gta tgg gta ccc ggg gaa ctg cgc ctg cg. As a control vector, the EGFP sequence was removed from pEGFP-N3 using restriction enzymes SalI and NotI and both ends were filled in with Klenow fragment followed by self-ligation. All constructs were subjected to bidirectional sequencing. The control vector or napsin-HA was stably transfected into HEK293 cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). For stable expression, transfected cells were selected with G418 (Invitrogen) and G418-resistant colonies were analyzed for the expression of napsin by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody (clone 3F10; Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 20 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Elugent (Calbiochem)) at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C overnight, and the matrix was washed with lysis buffer six times. Generation of Recombinant SP-BΔcand Cleavage by Napsin and Cathepsin H—The sequence encoding residues 1–279 of the human SP-B proprotein (SP-BΔc) was cloned in-frame with a six-residue COOH-terminal histidine tag and ligated into pVL1393 (BD Biosciences). Recombinant baculovirus was produced by homologous recombination in Spodoptera frugiperda cells as described by McCormack et al. (30McCormack F.X. Damodarasamy M. Elhalwagi B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3173-3181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Fresh monolayers of Trichoplusia ni cells were infected with plaque-purified recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 2 and cultured in serum-free media for 72 h. Recombinant SP-BΔC was purified from the culture medium of infected insect cells by NTA affinity chromatography, under nondenaturing conditions, as described previously (28Holzinger A. Phillips K.S. Weaver T.E. BioTechniques. 1996; 20 (808): 804-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant SP-BΔC was incubated with immunoprecipitates from the stable transfectants of napsin-HA or empty vector in incubation buffer (0.1 m sodium acetate, 20 mm EDTA, pH 4.7) or with cathepsin H (Biomol Research Laboratories) in incubation buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm cysteine, pH 6.8) at 37 °C for 2 h. Pepstatin A was added at 50 ng/μl as indicated. Generation of Recombinant Human SP-B/EGFP in Bacteria and Cleavage by Napsin and Cathepsin H—EGFP cDNA was amplified by PCR using pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) as a template followed by cloning into pET28a (Novagen) at the EcoRI and HindIII sites. Human SP-B fragments (amino acids 146–207, 272–298, 294–320, and 318–381) were amplified by PCR from the human SP-B cDNA and cloned in-frame with EGFP at the NheI and EcoRI sites. The sequences of the constructs were confirmed bidirectionally. BL21(DE3) was transformed with the constructs and protein synthesis was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Recombinant SP-B/EGFP fusion protein was purified by NTA affinity chromatography. All recombinant proteins were synthesized as soluble proteins in bacteria. Purified recombinant SP-B/EGFP was incubated with immunoprecipitates from the stable transfectants of napsin-HA or empty vector in incubation buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.5) or with cathepsin H in incubation buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm cysteine, pH 6.8) at 37 °C for 2 h. The reaction products were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by gel transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and individual bands were cut out from the membrane and subjected to Edman degradation (Protein Analysis Center, Karolinska Institute). Western Blotting—Samples were resolved on 16.5 or 10–20% Tris/Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blotting was performed with antiserum directed against recombinant mouse napsin, antiserum 28031 directed against the mature SP-B peptide, antiserum 55522 directed against the NH2- and COOH-terminal propeptides of SP-B (29Lin S. Phillips K.S. Wilder M.R. Weaver T.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and antiserum 76694 directed against the mature SP-C peptide (31Ross G.F. Ikegami M. Steinhilber W. Jobe A.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L1104-L1108PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were washed, and peroxidase activity was developed by SuperSignal West Pico (Pierce). The intensity of the signal was analyzed by IMAGEQUANT 5.0 (Amersham Biosciences). siRNA—Mouse napsin-specific siRNAs were synthesized with the silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The target sequences of the two most effective siRNAs were as follows: siRNA2, aat ctt aaa ccc act gaa tgg, and siRNA3, aac tat tgg ttt ggg aac gcc. Cathepsin H siRNA was synthesized by Cenix Bioscience. The target sequences of the three most effective siRNAs were as follows: cath182, aag gaa gat tca agc cca caa; cath206, aag gaa cca cac att taa aat; cath362, aag gaa gaa agg aaa tgt tgt. As a control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase siRNA was synthesized according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mouse type II cells were isolated from 6-week-old female C57/6 mice as described previously (26Rice W.R. Conkright J.J. Na C.L. Ikegami M. Shannon J.M. Weaver T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L256-L264Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Transfection of synthesized siRNAs was performed with GeneSilencer Reagent (Gene Therapy Systems). The transfection was carried out with 100 nm siRNA and 5 μl of Gene Silencer Reagent in a 12-well plate. Napsin Expression in Mouse Lung and Kidney Tissues— Western blotting with an antibody directed against bacterially derived recombinant mouse napsin detected a single immunoreactive protein in HEK293 cells transfected with the cDNA encoding mouse napsin but not in untransfected cells (Fig. 1A). Absorption of the antiserum with recombinant napsin prior to Western blotting completely blocked the immunoreaction. Napsin was readily detected by Western blotting of the adult mouse lung and kidney homogenates or lysates of type II cells isolated from adult mouse lung. However napsin was considerably more abundant in kidney tissue because immunoreactive protein was detected with less than 1 μg of kidney homogenate, whereas at least 30 μg of lysate from a purified population of type II cells was required to detect the protein (not shown). Western blotting of fetal lung homogenates detected napsin as early as day 16 of gestation, 1 day prior to the onset of SP-B expression and processing in fetal lung (32Stahlman M.T. Gray M.P. Falconieri M.W. Whitsett J.A. Weaver T.E. Lab. Investig. 2000; 80: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The subcellular localization of napsin was characterized by immunoelectron microscopy. In stably transfected HEK293 cells (not shown) and mouse kidney epithelial cells, lysosomes were heavily labeled with the napsin antibody (Fig. 2A). In type II cells of the lung, napsin was localized to lamellar bodies (Fig. 2B), which belong to the family of lysozyme-related organelles (33Weaver T.E. Na C.L. Stahlman M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 13: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and multivesicular bodies (Fig. 2C). Labeling was somewhat more prominent in multivesicular bodies but was considerably less intense than the labeling of lysosomes in kidney epithelial cells, consistent with the results of Western blotting. Napsin was also detected in lysosomes of alveolar macrophages (not shown) as reported previously (19Mori K. Shimizu H. Konno A. Iwanaga T. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 2002; 65: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Napsin was not detected in type I epithelial cells or bronchiolar Clara cells. Cleavage of the NH2- and COOH-terminal Propeptide of SP-B by Napsin and Cathepsin H—To determine whether napsin was involved in proteolytic processing of the SP-B proprotein, mouse type II epithelial cells were labeled with 35[S]methionine/cysteine for 3 h. The medium containing secreted SP-B proprotein was recovered and immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed against the mature SP-B peptide (Fig. 3). Immunoprecipitates were subsequently incubated with a crude membrane preparation isolated from untransfected HEK293 cells or cells stably transfected with the napsin cDNA. SP-B proprotein, Mr = 42,000, and a major processing intermediate (Mr = ∼25,000) were detected in untreated medium, as well as medium treated with membrane extract from transfected and untransfected cells (Fig. 3). Both membrane extracts processed the proprotein; however, only the membrane extract from napsin-transfected cells produced an increase in the Mr ∼25,000 processing intermediate and in smaller peptides that were immunoprecipitated with the SP-B mature peptide antibody (Fig. 3, lane T). The Mr = 25,000 SP-B processing intermediate was shown previously to arise by removal of the NH2-terminal propeptide (11O'Reilly M.A. Weaver T.E. Pilot-Matias T.J. Sarin V.K. Gazdar A.F. Whitsett J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1011: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: L100-L108PubMed Google Scholar, 16Weaver T.E. Lin S. Bogucki B. Dey C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L95-L103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the role of napsin in the processing of the NH2-terminal propeptide, recombinant pro-SP-B lacking the entire 102-amino acid COOH-terminal domain (SP-BΔC) was isolated from the medium of baculovirus-infected insect cells. Human napsin with an HA tag was expressed in HEK293 cells and purified by immunoprecipitation using an anti-HA affinity matrix. Recombinant SP-BΔC was incubated with immunopurified napsin for 2 h (pH 4.7, 37 °C) in the presence or absence of pepstatin A, an inhibitor of aspartic proteinases, or with cathepsin H for 2 h (pH 6.8, 37 °C). Western blotting showed that SP-BΔC was cleaved by napsin and that this cleavage was complete and inhibited by pepstatin A (Fig. 4). Cathepsin H similarly cleaved SP-BΔC to generate a peptide that migrated with Mr = 11–12,000 (Fig. 4). The additional 28-kDa band in the cathepsin H reaction is related to cross-reactivity of the primary or secondary antibody with cathepsin H (Fig. 4, compare lane 4 with lane 6). The cleaved peptides were detected by an antibody directed against the mature SP-B peptide, and both cleaved peptides were larger than the mature peptide (Mr = 9000), indicating that napsin and cathepsin H cleaved within the SP-B propeptide upstream of the NH2 terminus of the mature peptide. Because sufficient material was not obtained for sequencing of the cleavage site, recombinant human SP-B peptides fused to EGFP were produced in bacteria. All recombinant proteins were produced as soluble proteins in bacteria. The SP-B146–207/EGFP fusion protein included the 55 residues between the saposin-like domain in the NH2-terminal propeptide and the mature peptide as well as the first 7 residues of mature SP-B (Fig. 5). Incubation of purified SP-B146–207/EGFP with immunopurified napsin for 2 h (pH 6.5, 37 °C) resulted in the generation of a peptide with Mr ∼33,000 (Fig. 5). Amino acid sequence analysis of the recovered peptide fragment showed that napsin cleaved the SP-B146–207/EGFP fusion protein between Leu178 and Pro179, 22 amino acids upstream from the NH2 terminus of the mature peptide. The calculated molecular mass of mature SP-B with an NH2-terminal extension of 22 residues is 11.1 kDa, a value that is in good agreement with the results of the napsin-mediated cleavage of SP-BΔc purified from insect cell medium (Fig. 4). The incubation of SP-B146–207/EGFP fusion protein with cathepsin H also resulted in cleavage within the propeptide. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that cathepsin H cleaved the fusion protein between Ala187 and Arg188, 13 amino acids upstream of the NH2 terminus of the mature peptide (Fig. 6). Thus, cathepsin H cleaved between the napsin cleavage site and the NH2 terminus of mature SP-B but did not generate the NH2 terminus of the mature peptide.Fig. 6Cleavage of SP-B146–207/EGFP by cathepsin H. SP-B146–207/EGFP was incubated with cathepsin H, pH 6.8, at 37 °C for 2 h. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the cleaved peptide fragment was analyzed by Edman degradation. GFP, green fluorescent protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ability of napsin and cathepsin H to generate the COOH terminus of the SP-B mature peptide was also tested. An SP-B fragment (SP-B272–298), consisting of the last eight amino acids of the mature SP-B and the 19 residues between the mature peptide and the saposin-like domain in the COOH-terminal domain of the proprotein, was expressed in-frame with EGFP (Fig. 7). SP-B272–298/EGFP was expressed as a soluble protein in bacteria. Incubation of purified SP-B272–298/EGFP with immunopurified napsin, under the same conditions used to process SP-B146–207/EGFP, did not result in cleavage of the fusion protein. In contrast, cathepsin H cleaved SP-B272–298/EGFP between Met279 and Asp280, demonstrating that cathepsin H has the ability to generate the COOH terminus of the SP-B mature peptide (Fig. 7). To further determine whether napsin or cathepsin H could cleave at other positions within the COOH-terminal peptide, we synthesized two more SP-B/EGFP fusion proteins covering the remainder of the COOH-terminal domain of pro-SP-B (Fig. 7, SP-B294–320/EGFP and SP-B318–381/EGFP). Both SP-B/EGFP fusion proteins were expressed as soluble proteins. Neither SP-B/EGFP protein was cleaved by napsin (Fig. 7). In contrast, cathepsin H cleaved SP-B294–320/EGFP between Ala316 and Ile317 and SP-B318–381/EGFP was cleaved between Leu349 and Val350 and a second time between His377 and Ser378. In summary, napsin processing is restricted to the NH2-terminal propeptide, whereas cathepsin H is involved in the processing of both the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of pro-SP-B (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Summary of napsin and cathepsin H cleavage sites in human SP-B proprotein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Knockdown of Napsin and Cathepsin H in Type II Cells—The biologic relevance of napsin-mediated processing of the SP-B proprotein was assessed by inhibiting napsin expression in the primary cultures of mouse type II cells (Fig. 9). Preliminary experiments with fluorescent siRNA probes indicated that more than 90% of type II cells were routinely transfected with these reagents. Five different napsin siRNAs were synthesized and transfected into isolated type II cells. Two siRNA sequences were subsequently selected based on their ability to suppress napsin protein levels relative to the control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase siRNA or transfection reagent alone (Fig. 9). The siRNA-mediated decrease in napsin protein was accompanied by a decrease in the level of SP-B mature peptide in type II cells after 2 days of culture. The concentration of SP-C mature peptide was also decreased. There was no evidence of siRNA-mediated cytotoxicity (i.e. increased lactate dehydrogenase release), and the concentration of other proteins (e.g. SP-A) was not affected (not shown). These data suggest that napsin plays a key role in processing the SP-B proprotein to the biologically active mature peptide. Knockdown experiments were also attempted with five siRNA sequences for cathepsin H. The most effective of these siRNAs decreased cathepsin H protein levels to 40% of those in control cells; however the pattern of SP-B processing and the concentration of mature peptide were not altered (not shown). Processing of SP-B occurs during transit through the secretory pathway in type II epithelial cells. We have reported previously (16Weaver T.E. Lin S. Bogucki B. Dey C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L95-L103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that a membrane-associated aspartic proteinase is involved in the processing of SP-B. Napsin is a membrane-associated aspartyl protease with a very restricted pattern of expression (19Mori K. Shimizu H. Konno A. Iwanaga T. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 2002; 65: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Schauer-Vukasinovic V. Bur D. Kling D. Gruninger F. Giller T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the present study, we localized napsin to the lamellar bodies and multivesicular bodies of type II epithelial cells in concordance with reports from other groups (19Mori K. Shimizu H. Konno A. Iwanaga T. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 2002; 65: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34Brasch F. Ochs M. Kahne T. Guttentag S. Schauer-Vukasinovic V. Derrick M. Johnen G. Kapp N. Muller K.M. Richter J. Giller T. Hawgood S. Buhling F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49006-49014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This specific subcellular localization supports the hypothesis that napsin is involved in processing of the SP-B proprotein. In addition, napsin expression was detected as early as day 16 of gestation in the fetal lung, which is consistent with the time of onset (day 17) of SP-B expression and processing. This is also consistent with a previous study that detected weak expression of napsin mRNA on day 15 with increased intensity on day 16 (18Mori K. Kon Y. Konno A. Iwanaga T. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 2001; 64: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We employed three types of experiments to show that napsin is capable of cleaving the SP-B proprotein. In the first experiment, SP-B proprotein from the medium of type II cell cultures was incubated with a crude membrane fraction from napsin-transfected or untransfected HEK293 cells. The levels of the 25-kDa intermediate were enhanced after incubation with the membrane extract from napsin-transfected cells, suggesting that napsin is involved in the generation of this intermediate. Small amounts of lower molecular mass polypeptides (16 and 19 kDa) were also observed after incubation with membrane extracts from napsin-transfected cells. These forms may arise from cleavage of the 25-kDa polypeptide by napsin. Alternatively, accumulation of the-25 kDa intermediate may facilitate further cleavage by other enzyme(s) present in the membrane extract. In the second experiment, recombinant SP-BΔc was produced in baculovirus-infected insect cells. SP-BΔc was shown previously to be completely processed to the biologically active mature peptide in transgenic mice (35Akinbi H.T. Breslin J.S. Ikegami M. Iwamoto H.S. Clark J.C. Whitsett J.A. Jobe A.H. Weaver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9640-9647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). When expressed in insect cells, SP-BΔc was secreted into the medium, suggesting that the quality control apparatus in the secretory pathway recognized the recombinant protein as being correctly folded. Incubation of recombinant SP-BΔc with purified human napsin generated a peptide that was slightly larger than mature SP-B and was detected by an antibody directed against the mature peptide, indicating that napsin cleaved pro-SP-B within the NH2-terminal propeptide. In the third experiment, a recombinant human pro-SP-B peptide was produced as a soluble EGFP fusion protein in E. coli. We have shown previously that the expression of recombinant SP-BΔc in bacteria resulted in an insoluble recombinant protein likely related to the complex folding requirements of the saposin-like domain in the propeptide (28Holzinger A. Phillips K.S. Weaver T.E. BioTechniques. 1996; 20 (808): 804-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To avoid refolding of insoluble recombinant SP-B, the peptide interval between the saposin-like domain and the mature peptide (amino acids 146–207) was fused to EGFP. SP-B146–207/EGFP was expressed as a soluble protein and was purified from bacterial lysates by Ni-NTA chromatography. This fusion protein was cleaved by napsin between amino acid 178 and 179, consistent with the results of the napsin-mediated cleavage of SP-BΔc. Because the estimated molecular mass of glycosylated SP-B179–381 (from the napsin cleavage site in the NH2-terminal propeptide to the end of the COOH-terminal peptide) is 24–25 kDa, this result is consistent with the hypothesis that napsin produces the 25-kDa intermediate in type II cells. Previous analyses using a fluorescent resonance energy transfer-based approach demonstrated that human napsin cleaved between hydrophobic residues with a preference for Leu at position P1 (36Schauer-Vukasinovic V. Wright M.B. Breu V. Giller T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1492: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 37Gruninger-Leitch F. Schlatter D. Kung E. Nelbock P. Dobeli H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4687-4693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The results of the current study conform to this pattern and indicated that human napsin cleaved between two hydrophobic amino acids, Leu178 and Pro179. In contrast, five other Leu-Pro sites in the SP-B146–207/EGFP fusion protein were not cleaved, suggesting that these sites were inaccessible and/or that neighboring residues produced an unfavorable context for cleavage. Napsin also did not cleave any of the COOH-terminal peptide-EGFP fusion proteins. These results differ significantly from the recent study of Brasch et al. (34Brasch F. Ochs M. Kahne T. Guttentag S. Schauer-Vukasinovic V. Derrick M. Johnen G. Kapp N. Muller K.M. Richter J. Giller T. Hawgood S. Buhling F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49006-49014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) who detected multiple cleavage sites when napsin was incubated with a refolded full-length recombinant SP-B substrate; napsin-mediated cleavage was detected immediately after Val180 and Ala184 in the propeptide, Ala276 in the mature peptide, and Trp354 in the COOH-terminal peptide domain of the proprotein. In the present study, napsin cleaved within the NH2-terminal propeptide but did not cleave within the mature peptide or the COOH-terminal domain. As suggested by Brasch et al. (34Brasch F. Ochs M. Kahne T. Guttentag S. Schauer-Vukasinovic V. Derrick M. Johnen G. Kapp N. Muller K.M. Richter J. Giller T. Hawgood S. Buhling F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49006-49014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), napsin-mediated cleavage of the mature peptide in their study may have been the result of inappropriate refolding of bacterially produced SP-B protein leading to exposure of non-native cleavage sites. Alternatively, differences in incubation conditions, preparation of recombinant SP-B, or enzyme preparation may have contributed to the discrepancies between these two studies. A cysteine protease, most likely cathepsin H, was suggested to be involved in the final step of SP-B processing (25Guttentag S. Robinson L. Zhang P. Brasch F. Buhling F. Beers M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 28: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cathepsin H, like napsin, was shown to be localized to lamellar bodies, and multivesicular bodies of type II cells (39Ishii Y. Hashizume Y. Kominami E. Uchiyama Y. Anat. Rec. 1991; 230: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 40Yayoi Y. Ohsawa Y. Koike M. Zhang G. Kominami E. Uchiyama Y. Arch. Histol.

Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and E-64, a water-soluble inhibitor of cathepsins B, H, L, and calpain, inhibited the most distal step in SP-B processing, i.e. cleavage of SP-B9 to SP-B8. To determine whether cathepsin H could cleave the NH2-terminal propeptide, recombinant SP-B146–207/EGFP fusion protein was used as substrate for the enzyme. A cleavage site was detected within the NH2-terminal proprotein between Ala187 and Arg188, consistent with the endopeptidase activity of cathepsin H. This result shows that at least one more enzyme, in addition to napsin and cathepsin H, is involved in generation of the NH2 terminus of mature SP-B. Interestingly, in contrast to napsin, cathepsin H also cleaved the COOH-terminal peptide of SP-B at several sites. The cleavage sites by napsin and cathepsin H are summarized in Fig. 8. Importantly, one of the cleavage sites was the boundary between mature SP-B and the COOH-terminal domain, suggesting that cathepsin H is involved in the final step of the COOH-terminal processing of pro-SP-B. The biologic relevance of the other COOH-terminal cleavages sites remains unclear. A siRNA experiment was performed to determine whether napsin is required for the cellular processing of pro-SP-B. Decreased levels of mature SP-B were accompanied by the knockdown of napsin, indicating an important role for napsin in the processing of pro-SP-B. Accumulation of the 42-kDa proprotein was not detected in treated or untreated type II cells in these experiments (not shown). This is not unexpected, because we have never been able to detect pro-SP-B by Western blotting (except following lung injury) presumably because the proprotein is rapidly processed or degraded. We also observed decreased levels of mature SP-C in the presence of napsin siRNA. Because SP-B expression is required for processing of SP-C, decreased levels of mature SP-C may result from deficiency of mature SP-B (3Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J. Stahlman M.T. Stripp B.R.

A direct involvement of napsin in pro-SP-C processing cannot, however, be excluded at present. Recent investigations have shown that siRNA can activate the interferon pathway leading to complications in the interpretation of such experiments (43Sledz C.A. Holko M. de Veer M.J. Silverman R.H. Williams B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 38Bridge A.J. Pebernard S. Ducraux A. Nicoulaz A.L. Iggo R. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 263-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). We used glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase siRNA, expected to activate nonspecific pathways to the same extent as napsin siRNA, as a negative control. Results are expressed in relation to this control and suggest that decreased levels of mature SP-B and mature SP-C are not because of nonspecific activity but because of decreased expression of napsin. Comparable siRNA experiments for cathepsin H were not conclusive, presumably because we were unable to achieve complete inhibition of enzyme expression. Although it is possible that cathepsin H is not involved in SP-B processing in vivo, the finding that cathepsin H cleavage generates the exact COOH terminus of the mature peptide argues strongly that this is a biologically relevant processing event. In conclusion, it is clear from this study and those of Brasch et al. (34Brasch F. Ochs M. Kahne T. Guttentag S. Schauer-Vukasinovic V. Derrick M. Johnen G. Kapp N. Muller K.M. Richter J. Giller T.

Chem. 2003; 278: 49006-49014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) that multiple proteolytic enzymes are involved in generating the biologically active SP-B mature peptide. Our data suggest that napsin is essential for pro-SP-B processing and may be the aspartyl protease involved in generating the 25-kDa pro-SP-B intermediate implicated in the earlier study (16Weaver T.E. Lin S. Bogucki B. Dey C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L95-L103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cathepsin H generates the COOH terminus of mature SP-B and may also be involved in processing of the propeptide. The identity of the enzyme(s) responsible for generation of the NH2 terminus of the biologically active peptide remains unknown.

To understand the mechanism by which the affinity of a common TM-TM interactive motif is controlled at the sequence level, we compared two well characterized GXXXG motif-containing homodimers, those formed by human erythrocyte protein glycophorin A (GpA, high-affinity dimer) and those formed by bacteriophage M13 major coat protein (MCP, low affinity dimer). In both constructs, the GXXXG motif is necessary for TM-TM association. Although the remaining interfacial residues (underlined) in GpA (LIXXGVXXGVXXT) differ from those in MCP (VVXXGAXXGIXXF), molecular modeling performed here indicated that GpA and MCP dimers possess the same overall fold. Thus, we could introduce GpA interfacial residues, alone and in combination, into the MCP sequence to help decrypt the determinants of dimer affinity. Using both in vivo TOXCAT assays and SDS-PAGE gel migration rates of synthetic peptides derived from TM regions of the proteins, we found that the most distal interfacial sites, 12 residues apart (and ∼18 Å in structural space), work in concert to control TM-TM affinity synergistically.

Specificity for a given helix-helix interaction is achieved through the appropriate presentation of complementary side chains, which serve as recognition elements between associating helices. The most highly studied, and apparently widespread, mode of association is mediated by the so-called GXXXG motif, which is known to act as a universal scaffold for the assembly of both TM helices (2Deber C.M.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5990-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The GXXXG motif, where two glycine residues are separated by any three amino acids on a helical framework, gives rise to a flat surface region on one face of the helix. This arrangement of Gly residues permits the close approach of interacting helices, whereupon extensive packing interactions take place between pairs of surrounding residues. It has been proposed that a portion of the interactive strength of GXXXG-mediated associations may originate from inter-helix hydrogen bonds between Cα hydrogens and carbonyl oxygen atoms on the adjacent helix (11Senes A. Ubarretxena-Belandia I. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9056-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The glycophorin A transmembrane (GpA-TM) segment is a well characterized transmembrane helix dimer that associates with high affinity, principally by using a central GXXXG motif (3Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M.

The details of side chain-side chain packing for GpA are known in considerable detail, having been gleaned originally from extensive mutagenesis experiments (3Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12719-12725Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), computer modeling (13Treutlein H.R. Lemmon M.A. Engelman D.M. Brunger A.T.

Proteins. 1996; 26: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and, subsequently, from a high-resolution structural analysis using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for the GpA dimer in both detergent micelles (12MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) and lipid bilayers (15Smith S.O. Song D. Shekar S. Groesbeek M. Ziliox M. Aimoto S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6553-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Despite the high occurrence of the GXXXG motif in transmembrane helices (7Senes A. Gerstein M. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 921-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), GpA-TM is the only GXXXG peptide dimer with a structure determined to high resolution (11Senes A. Ubarretxena-Belandia I. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9056-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not clear whether other membrane proteins containing this motif adopt a similar dimeric fold to GpA or have alternate structure. Moreover, it is not known how residues surrounding GXXXG motifs “tailor” the affinity of their helix-helix interactions for the required structural and functional purposes. For instance, the transmembrane helix of the major coat protein of the M13 bacteriophage (MCP-TM) contains a GXXXG motif (2Deber C.M. Khan A.R. Li Z. Joensson C. Glibowicka M. Wang J. Proc. Natl.

However, unlike the highly stable GpA-TM dimer, the affinity of MCP-TM helix-helix self-association is comparatively weak (22Dawson J.P. Melnyk R.A. Deber C.M. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Indeed, such low affinity seems to be a requirement for phage viability (18Henry G.D. Sykes B.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), thus raising the intriguing notion that the MCP homodimer may not be optimized for stability, but is instead designed to be in flux between the monomeric and dimeric states during the life cycle of the phage (20Melnyk R.A. Partridge A.W. Deber C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The GpA and MCP systems thus afford the opportunity to directly investigate the detailed mechanism by which the stability of a GXXXG-mediated interaction is either optimized (in the case of GpA) or not (in the case of MCP). In the present work, we initially establish, by using a method developed to model TM helix oligomers (23Kim S. Chamberlain A.K. Bowie J.U. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), that the primary sequence of MCP is compatible with the dimers of the type formed by GpA. Then, through systematic replacement of the interfacial residues of MCP with those of GpA, individually or in combination, we assess the relative contributions of the interfacial sites in stabilizing TM helix-helix interactions, using both in vitro (TM peptides) and in vivo (TOXCAT) techniques. These combined approaches provide a model in which TM helix-helix interactive motifs are modulated through the propagation of long range cooperative interactions along a 12-residue segment of the oligomeric interface. Computation of MCP Oligomerization—The structures of MCP-TM helix (amino acids 25-42, AWAMVVVIVGATIGIKLF) and mutants were built as uniform α-helices having a backbone torsion angle of ϕ = -65° and ψ = -40° (24Smith L.J. Bolin K.A. Schwalbe H. MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 494-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) using the Insight II Biopolymer package (Accelrys). We used the backbone-dependent rotamer library program, SCWRL (25Bower M.J. Cohen F.E. Dunbrack Jr, R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1268-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), to chose the side chain rotamers. Structure prediction of MCP dimer was carried out as described (23Kim S. Chamberlain A.K. Bowie J.U. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, the dimer optimization started with 200 pairs of helices placed in random orientations with respect to each other. Then, the packing interaction of each helix pair was optimized by using the MC minimization method. The internal backbone and side-chain positions were kept fixed during the minimization, but the relative positions of the helices were given all six degrees of freedom. The energy function used was a softened van der Waals potential without any electrostatic component. The simulations were stopped after a maximum of 100,000 MC steps or if 15,000 steps occurred without moving to a lower energy. All six orientation parameters were changed during a step; a step of the same magnitude and direction was repeated if the previous step resulted in lower energy. The step size in each parameter was randomly selected. The temperature was initially set at 500 K and decreased linearly to 0.1 K over the first 50,000 steps. In this manner, we generated a large collection of independently optimized structures. After the MC simulations, the dimer structures were filtered to remove structures incompatible with the dimer symmetry. Then, we clustered the remaining structures by Cα root-mean-square (RMS) distances using NMRCLUSTER (26Kelley L.A. Gardner S.P. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1063-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Finally, the median model from the largest cluster was selected as our final predicted structure. This method follows the hypothesis that the correct structure is likely to reside in a broader energy well than the other incorrect structures (27Shortle D. Simons K.T. Baker D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11158-11162Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and was previously successful in predicting homo-symmetric TM helix bundle structures (23Kim S. Chamberlain A.K. Bowie J.U. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis—Peptides corresponding to MCP residues 21-48 (with three added N-terminal lysine residues) were synthesized with standard Fmoc chemistry on a PerSeptive Biosystems Pioneer™ peptide synthesizer. Synthesis employed the Pioneer standard (45 min) cycle. Addition of Fmoc-protected labels was done during synthesis using an extended cycle (60 min). The HATU/DIEA activator pair was used with a 4-fold excess amino acid. A low-load (0.18-0.22 mmol/g) PAL-PEG-PS resin was used to produce an amidated C terminus. Peptides were cleaved with a mixture of 88% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% phenol, 5% ultra-pure water, 2% triisopropylsilane. Cleaved peptides were precipitated with ice-cold diethyl ether. Centrifuged pellets were dried in a desiccator, redissolved in ultra-pure water, and lyophilized. Crude peptide powder was dissolved in water, and 10 mg of peptide were loaded onto a C4 preparative reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) column. The major peak from a water/MeCN gradient was collected and lyophilized. Mass spectrometry was used to confirm the molecular weight of the purified peptide, and the micro-BCA assay was used to determine peptide concentration. Analytical HPLC chromatography was employed to confirm the purity of peptides as >95% pure. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism spectra were recorded using a Jasco J-720 circular dichroism spectropolarimeter. Purified peptide samples were dissolved in buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.2 with 20 mm SDS or 30 mm β-octylglucopyranoside. Spectra were obtained at peptide concentrations between 20 and 50 μm. Measurements were made using a quartz cuvette with a path-length of 0.1 mm. Spectral scans were performed from 250-190 nm, with a step-resolution of 0.2 nm, a speed of 20 nm/min, and a bandwidth of 1.0 nm. SDS-PAGE—Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 4-12% NuPage precast gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). Samples were boiled for 5 min prior to loading. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence spectroscopy (steady-state) fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Photon Technology International C-60 fluorescence spectrometer. Samples were examined in a stoppered 2-mm × 10-mm quartz cuvette (Hellma, Concord, ON, Canada). Emission spectra were collected from 300 to 450 nm (λex = 295 nm), 0.1 s/nm, bandpass 2 nm for excitation and emission. Small unilamellar vesicles of Escherichia coli lipids were made using the following procedure. Peptide samples were frozen at -80 °C and lyophilized in rimless 12-mm × 75-mm glass Pyrex tubes. E. coli polar lipid extract from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) in chloroform was then aliquoted into tubes containing dried peptide samples. Organic solvent was removed by using a dry nitrogen stream and further lyophilized overnight. Samples were hydrated using 500 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8) and vortexed periodically for 30 min. Small unilamellar vesicles were formed using bath sonication (30-s bursts) until solutions were clear (10 min). TOXCAT Chimera Construction—MCP TOXCAT constructs consist of an N-terminal DNA-binding domain of ToxR, a transmembrane domain, and the periplasmic maltose-binding protein. Individual constructs were cloned by mutating the wild-type MCP construct (kindly provided by J. Dawson) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) protocol using oligonucleotides ∼20 base pairs long. The mutation was located in the center of the oligonucleotide. Constructs were transformed into E. coli NT326 (MalE-) cells. Whole-cell lysates were used to estimate expression levels of the constructs. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE, and then Western analysis was carried out using antibodies against MBP (NEB). Blots were developed using goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase secondary antibody (Pierce). The presence of MBP in the periplasm was confirmed by growth on minimal maltose media. CAT Assays—Cell-free extracts were made by pelleting 200 μl of cells at an A600 of 0.6, resuspending in 500 μl of 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, then lysing with 20 μl of 100 mm EDTA, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and one drop of toluene, at 30 °C for 30 min. The cell-free extract was then diluted 1:80 before being used in the CAT assays. Briefly, samples were incubated at 37 °C with tritiated chloramphenicol and n-butyryl coenzyme A. After 90 min, the reaction was halted by partitioning the [3H]chloramphenicol-butyryl CoA complex into xylene. The organic phase was washed and quantified using the radiolabel. All measurements were performed four times. Errors shown are standard deviations on four measurements. Structural Similarity of MCP and GpA Dimer Structures—We first investigated whether the MCP-TM can dimerize to form a structure similar to the known GpA-TM dimer (12MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 15Smith S.O. Song D. Shekar S. Groesbeek M. Ziliox M. Aimoto S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6553-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) or whether alternative structures might be preferred. Therefore, we applied an algorithm shown to be effective at modeling homo-oligomeric TM helix bundles when the number of subunits is known (23Kim S. Chamberlain A.K. Bowie J.U. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Using this program, a single, strongly favored model for the packing of MCP-TM was generated (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this model, the glycyl residues from the GXXXG motif are juxtaposed in the dimer interface, thus facilitating close helix-helix approach. Detailed examination of the final structure of the MCP-TM dimer revealed a strong resemblance to that of the GpA-TM dimer, notwithstanding significant differences in side chain volume of the non-Gly interfacial residues (Fig. 1). Both models display a right-handed, helix-helix crossing angle of approximately -40°. The Cα RMSD between this model of the MCP-TM and the GpA-TM obtained from solid-state NMR distance measurements is only 1.6 Å, and for GpA-TM from solution, the NMR measurement is 2.1 Å (RMSD between the structure from solid and solution NMR is 0.8 Å). Thus, the side chains on MCP-TM can be considered to be sterically compatible with the side chains in the GpA-TM dimer structure and vice versa. Comparison of MCP Model and GpA Interfaces—If MCP-TM and GpA-TM dimers adopt similar structures, then the differences in their relative helix-helix affinity must be attributable to differences in interactions involving the non-Gly residues in the respective interfaces. Fig. 2 shows an alignment of MCP and GpA sequences, with the interfacial residues labeled a through g. It is apparent that both interfaces possess, in addition to the embedded GXXXG motif at the c and e positions, a significant content of β-branched amino acids (V, I, T). It has been proposed that β-branched residues, which have constrained rotameric freedom in an α-helical conformation, reduce the entropic cost of folding in TM proteins (7Senes A. Gerstein M. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 921-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Despite these similarities in residue type, all five non-Gly interfacial residues (a, b, d, f, g) differ between MCP (VV, A, I, F) and GpA (LI, V, V, T) (Fig. 2). Distal Sites in the Interface Act Synergistically to Stabilize Association: TOXCAT Assays in Bilayers—To investigate how subtle differences in the interfacial residues of the GpA and MCP dimers contribute to helix-helix association, we first assessed how substitutions in MCP to the corresponding residues in GpA affected the affinity of dimerization in natural bilayers using the TOXCAT assay (28Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the sequences in the regions a-g of all constructs made and tested. As expected, GpA-wt showed much higher affinity in the TOXCAT assay than did MCP-wt (Fig. 4B). In fact, the GpA-G83I mutant, which is considered to be largely monomeric, gave comparable CAT levels to that of MCP-wt. We note, however, that the GXXXG motif in GpA occurs near the N terminus of GpA, whereas in MCP, the GXXXG motif is further toward the C terminus (Fig. 4A). As a result, the start and end points of the TM segments are not equivalent and thus, the relative positions of the GXXXG motifs are not equivalent. To ensure that the disparity in CAT levels did not arise simply from the different positions of the GXXXG motifs relative to the ToxR domains, we prepared an MCP construct (termed MCP-GpA) in which the entire interface (positions a, b, d, f, g) of MCP was mutated to the corresponding GpA residues (Fig. 3). As seen in Fig. 4B, the MCP-GpA association is comparable with that of GpA-wt; the decrease observed for MCP-GpA may reflect the different positioning of the dimer interface in the bilayer, as described above. These experimental observations reinforce the notion that the GpA interface is optimized for TM-TM affinity relative to that of the MCP interface. The results for the MCP mutants shown in Fig. 4C were thus normalized to the affinity of the MCP-GpA construct, as this is the maximum affinity expected for the MCP variants. Assessment of the stabilization imparted to the MCP dimer by each of the singly substituted constructs (V30L, V31I, and F42T), revealed little, if any, change in affinity as judged by the TOXCAT assay (Fig. 4C). V30L enhanced dimerization only slightly, whereas V31I and F42T had no significant effect on dimerization. These results were expected for V31I; in our MCP model (Fig. 1), the helices are rotated slightly, placing Val31 on the surface, rather than the interface, so in the context of the MCP sequence, this position would not be expected to contribute much to dimer affinity. Moreover, at position b (Ile75 in GpA; Val31 in MCP), it was shown previously that both an I75V mutation in GpA and (in the opposite direction) a V31I mutation in MCP, had little or no effect on dimer stability for GpA and MCP, respectively (3Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12719-12725Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The lack of significant affinity enhancement observed for single MCP mutants V30L and F42T was perhaps unexpected, especially given the dramatic effects the reverse changes have in the GpA background (see above). Thus, if interfacial residues contribute only individually to the stability of interacting helices, the results thus far would predict that no combination of these three mutants (V30L, V31I, F42T) should result in any additional stabilization of the MCP dimer. Yet, when the V30L and F42T mutants were combined to form the double MCP mutant V30L/F42T, a dramatic increase in stability was observed (Fig. 4C), resulting in a signal measuring ∼70% of MCP-GpA. That the resulting affinity of this construct far exceeded the additive sum of the two mutants (∼45% MCP-GpA) indicates that V30L and F42T work in tandem to stabilize the dimer in a synergistic fashion. The increase in affinity observed as one progresses from the triply substituted MCP (V30L/V31I/F42T), which is ∼80% of the full MCP-GpA construct (V30L/V31I/A35V/I39V/F42T), thus points to a minor, but discernible, role for the d and f positions in contributing to dimer stability. To investigate the mechanism underlying the stabilization imparted by the double mutant V30L/F42T, an additional mutant was generated in which the g position was substituted to Val, whereas the V30L substitution was retained (Fig 4D). For this double mutant (V30L/F42V), the size of the g side chain was retained, but the hydroxyl group was removed. The synergistic effect seen above for the V30L/F42T mutant was not observed for the V30L/F42V mutant (Fig. 4D), suggesting a discrete role of the hydroxyl group in stabilizing TM dimer affinity. Oligomerization States of Synthetic Transmembrane Peptides—We next characterized the behavior of several of the GpA/MCP hybrid mutants in the context of synthetic TM peptides. Peptides afford the opportunity, not otherwise accessible in the TOXCAT constructs, to perform additional biophysical analyses on the isolated TM segments. MCP-TM peptides were designed to include the putative TM domain of MCP (residues 21-48), along with three non-native N-terminal Lys residues, which facilitate peptide synthesis, purification, and characterization (20Melnyk R.A. Partridge A.W. Deber C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We reported previously that MCP-TM peptides designed in this manner were in equilibrium between the monomeric and dimeric states (20Melnyk R.A. Partridge A.W. Deber C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The circular dichroism spectra of all of the present TM peptide constructs were superimposable in both SDS and in n-octyl-glucopyranoside and indicate about 70% helical content (Fig. 5A). The occurrence of a native Trp residue (Trp26) in all MCP peptides allowed us to use fluorescence spectroscopy to further assess whether single- or multiple-mutations to the interface affected the stable insertion of peptides into detergents and phospholipid bilayers. As shown in Fig. 5B, Trp26 fluorescence was blue-shifted (327-331 nm) and identical in both MCP wt and MCP-GpA, indicating comparable insertion properties in both detergent and phospholipid environments. SDS-PAGE has proven to be a valuable tool to assess the association of TM segments for many different sequences (3Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M.

A. 2001; 98: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Fig. 5C shows the migration behavior of the MCP peptide variants on SDS gels. We found that the migration of the TM peptides correlates well with the affinity measured by the TOXCAT assay. On the gels, a rapid equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric species is established, resulting in positioning of the dimer band as a function of both the degree of exchange and the relative population of the monomeric species. In particular, the low affinity MCP-wt peptide dimer migrates faster than the high-affinity MCP-GpA peptide. Migration rates of other mutants are largely consistent with affinities determined by TOXCAT assays. The GXXXG motif provides a basic scaffold responsible for mediating TM helix-helix interactions. Indeed, early studies on GpA found that the central GXXXG portion was the most crucial part of the interaction motif, as judged by its hypersensitivity to mutation (3Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12719-12725Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), and its ability to singularly mediate the assembly of otherwise monomeric sequences (41Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The universality of this motif was demonstrated in a study wherein libraries were used to randomly select high-affinity TM sequences based on the two-in-two-out motif of GpA (6Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Though biased to this right-handed crossing motif, it was found that 80% of the high-affinity isolates contained the GXXXG motif. The solution NMR structure of GpA further confirmed how the presence of the two Gly residues in the interface can facilitate the close approach of helices, thereby allowing extensive backbone-backbone and side chain-side chain interactions to occur (12MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments have shown that mutation of any interfacial position along the GpA-TM to Ala is energetically costly (42Fleming K.G. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14340-14344Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This is most significantly pronounced with Gly79 and Gly83, where the dimer is destabilized by 1.7 and 3.2 Kcal/mol, respectively. It has been suggested that the GXXXG motif may derive much of its interactive energy from the Cα hydrogen of the Gly residues forming hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyls of the adjacent helix, which would have enhanced strength in the apolar lipid environment (11Senes A. Ubarretxena-Belandia I. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9056-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Here, we undertook a comparative analysis of two GXXXG-containing TM sequences (GpA and MCP), both of which are involved in mediating homodimerization, but with very different affinities (22Dawson J.P. Melnyk R.A. Deber C.M. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and sought to understand how the non-Gly interfacial residues control the affinity of association. Other than their common GXXXG motif, there is no sequence identity between MCP and GpA at the five remaining interfacial sites: a, b, d, f, and g. However, based on previous mutagenesis studies of GpA (2Deber C.M. Khan A.R. Li Z. Joensson C. Glibowicka M. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11648-11652Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) that examined these positions in an extensive library, we reasoned that the differences at the b, d, and f positions would have only a marginal effect on affinity. As well, the observed hyper-variability observed at these sites in the high-affinity isolates obtained by Russ et al. (6Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) prompted us to focus principally on the a and g positions for the present study. We found that it was necessary to convert both a and g positions of MCP to the corresponding GpA residues to impart the full stability effects, indicating that these residues, which are separated by 12 residues in the linear sequence and ∼18 Å, as seen in the GpA-TM structure, act synergistically to stabilize the interface. As illustrated schematically in Fig. 6, we propose that the strong coupling between these two residues can be explained by the changes in structure induced by position a, which propagate along the helical axes to bring the residues in the g position into close proximity, allowing formation of an interhelical Thr-mediated hydrogen bond, either between two Thr hydroxyl substituents, or, as observed by Smith et al. (43Smith S.O. Eilers M. Song D. Crocker E. Ying W. Groesbeek M. Metz G. Ziliox M. Aimoto S. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2476-2486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), between the Thr hydroxyl and a backbone carbonyl group. The low affinity observed for the double mutant V30L/F42V allowed us to exclude both size and β-branching as the basis for the stability imparted by the residue at the g position. The importance of the a position for facilitating this H-bond is underlined by the fact that the F42T construct alone, with Val at the a position, showed no increase in dimer affinity relative to MCP-wt. In effect, the a site acts as a molecular switch that controls whether an interaction (in this instance, an H-bond) can take place at the g position, and by extension, modulates the affinity of GXXXG-mediated interactions. Thus, three hallmark sequence features, present simultaneously, produce high TM-TM affinity: (i) a central GXXXG motif; (ii) a Leu residue at the a position; and (iii) either a Thr or Ser residue at the g position. The general sequence pattern LXXXGXXXGXXX(T/S) seems to represent a scaffold used by TM helices to ensure high-affinity interactions. Recognition and assembly between TM helices are likely controlled by a small set of core sequence motifs. Of these, the GXXXG motif is one of the most over-represented motifs in TM segments (7Senes A. Gerstein M. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 921-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Using the comparative approach presented here, wherein a “weak” dimer (MCP) can be converted to a “strong” dimer (GpA) in a residue-dependent manner, we were able not only to delineate the contribution from each residue to dimer stability, but also to understand how side chains can communicate with each other over relatively long distances to synergistically control interaction affinity. Structurally, these results were validated by the gross similarity of the model structure of the MCP-TM dimer to the GpA-TM dimer. The 12-residue separation of the a and g positions along the TM helix indicates that long-range interactions play a direct role in the folding of TM domains in membrane proteins. Thus, although the GXXXG Gly residues are determinants of interfacial assembly, it is the surrounding interfacial residues that ultimately control and tune the affinity and dynamics of TM helix-helix interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2106912409,"Movement of phosphatidylserine (PS) to the plasma membrane outer leaflet is a nearly universal marker of apoptosis and occurs during activation of many cells. Neutrophils stimulated with the chemotactic peptide formylated Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) demonstrated transient PS exposure. Stimulated outward movement of PS was accompanied by enhanced inward movement of several phosphorylcholine lipid probes and was associated with enhanced FM 1-43 staining indicative of phospholipid packing changes. Unlike apoptosis, inward movement of exogenously added fluorescent PS did not decline, and DNA was not cleaved during fMLP stimulation. Movement of phospholipids occurred within minutes following stimulation, was independent of endocytosis/pinocytosis, and was consistent with bidirectional, transbilayer phospholipid flip-flop. While the role of phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is controversial in flip-flop, we sought evidence for its role in enhanced phospholipid movements during fMLP stimulation. Using antibodies to the carboxyl-terminal domain of PLSCR1, its presence in the plasma membranes of non-permeabilized neutrophils was confirmed by flow cytometry. Additionally subcellular fractionation demonstrated that PLSCR1 was also located in secretory vesicles and tertiary and secondary granules. Activation of neutrophils with fMLP, however, did not significantly alter surface labeling suggesting that stimulated phospholipid flip-flop does not require additional mobilization of PLSCR1 to the plasma membrane. As expected for palmitoylated proteins, PLSCR1 was enriched in detergent-insoluble membranes and co-localized with raft markers at the neutrophil uropod after stimulation. Of note, PS exposure, phospholipid uptake, and FM 1-43 staining also localized to the uropod following stimulation demonstrating that both PLSCR1 and phospholipid flip-flop characterize this specialized domain of polarized neutrophils.

Most resting cells appear to demonstrate marked asymmetry in the transbilayer distribution of phospholipids composing the plasma membrane with the majority of sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine (PC) 1The abbreviations used are: PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride, HCl; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PAF, platelet-activating factor; cPAF, 1-O-[hexadecyl-1′-,2′-3H(N)]2-N-methylcarbamyl-platelet activating factor; CT-B, cholera toxin B; fMLP, formylated Met-Leu-Phe; FVa, activated Factor V; GM1, Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,4(Neu5Acα2,3)Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1-ceramide, NH4; GM3, Neu5Acα2,3Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1-ceramide, NH4; KRPD, Krebs-Ringer phosphate-dextrose, MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; NBD, (7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PLSCR1, phospholipid scramblase 1; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. 1The abbreviations used are: PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride, HCl; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PAF, platelet-activating factor; cPAF, 1-O-[hexadecyl-1′-,2′-3H(N)]2-N-methylcarbamyl-platelet activating factor; CT-B, cholera toxin B; fMLP, formylated Met-Leu-Phe; FVa, activated Factor V; GM1, Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,4(Neu5Acα2,3)Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1-ceramide, NH4; GM3, Neu5Acα2,3Galβ1,4Glcβ1,1-ceramide, NH4; KRPD, Krebs-Ringer phosphate-dextrose, MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; NBD, (7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PLSCR1, phospholipid scramblase 1; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. localizing to the membrane outer leaflet and most phosphatidylethanolamine and nearly all phosphatidylserine (PS) localizing to the membrane inner leaflet (1Daleke D.L.

This phospholipid asymmetry is thought to be maintained by both an aminophospholipid translocase activity that flips (inward) PS, and to a lesser extent phosphatidylethanolamine, from the outer leaflet back to the inner leaflet and a low spontaneous rate of phospholipid flip and flop (outward) across the plasma membrane bilayer (1Daleke D.L.

Recognition of exposed PS on the apoptotic cell by a stereospecific receptor on the phagocyte signals for both phagocytic engulfment and down-regulation of inflammatory mediator production (6Henson P.M. Bratton D.L. Fadok V.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R795-R805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). As such, apoptotic cells are cleared in an efficient and non-phlogistic manner (7Henson P.M. Bratton D.L. Fadok V.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). PS exposure has also been reported under certain conditions during activation of inflammatory cells and on capacitated spermatozoa (8De Vries K.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Gadella B.M. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 2122-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For example, PS is exposed on platelets stimulated by thrombin and collagen, on B cells with the B cell antigen receptor capped, on mast cells with cross-linked FcϵRI, and most recently on neutrophils treated with dimeric galectin-1 after initial stimulation with fMLP (9Bevers E.M.

Externalization of PS on inflammatory cells is thought to play a role in the activation of both complement and coagulation cascades and supports the binding and activity of secreted phospholipases A2 (see “Discussion”). The mechanism(s) of enhanced exposure of PS during apoptosis has been shown variously to be either caspase-dependent or -independent and to require cytoskeletal alterations, calcium flux, or oxidation (14Bratton D.L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5134-5139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Where it has been investigated, PS exposure is thought to result, at least in part, from loss of PS flip due to declining aminophospholipid translocase activity (14Bratton D.L. Fadok V.A. Richter D.A. Kailey J.M. Guthrie L.A. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26159-26165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 17Verhoven B. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of PS exposure during cellular activation have received much less attention. Where it has been studied, PS exposure in activation, like apoptosis, is accompanied by enhanced staining with lipophilic dyes that indicate changes in membrane lipid packing and enhanced nonspecific uptake of phospholipids bearing various head groups including PC species (12Williamson P.

J. 2000; 349: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Notably the mechanisms of phospholipid movement and the proteins involved in either outward movement of PS or inward movement of PC have not been unequivocally identified (see “Discussion”). Members of the P-type ATPase family have been proposed as candidate proteins mediating flip of PS from the outer leaflet to the inner leaflet and are credited with establishing and maintaining the basal asymmetric distribution of PS, but reverse function resulting in PS exposure has not been noted (1Daleke D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 3Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P.

Genomics. 1999; 1: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Other proteins of the ABC family have been proposed as mediating flop of phospholipids from inner leaflet to outer leaflet (e.g. ABCA1, ABCB1, and ABCB4) (for reviews, see Refs. 1Daleke D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar and 22Pomorski T. Hrafnsdottir S. Devaux P.F. van Meer G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) but have not been found to enhance inward flip of phospholipids from outer leaflet to inner leaflet. Also these proteins appear to be constitutively active with little evidence that they are activated within minutes of stimulation as has been described for PS exposure in inflammatory cells. Although controversial, the PLSCR1 is hypothesized to mediate calcium-activated, bidirectional, nonspecific (with regard to head group) phospholipid movement that has been shown to accompany PS exposure in apoptosis and cellular activation (23Yu A.

However, where phospholipid movement has been associated with PLSCR1 expression, the precise mechanisms of movement have not been elucidated. Movement of phospholipids could involve either transbilayer flip-flop across the plasma membrane (27Zhou Q. Zhao J. Stout J.G. Luhm R.A. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18240-18244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and/or, given PLSCR1 localization to recycling endosomes in epithelial cells (28Sun J. Nanjundan M. Pike L.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6338-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), could involve bilayer mixing during vesicle-plasma membrane fission and fusion. Here we have shown that stimulated neutrophils transiently expose PS during fMLP activation in the absence of evidence for apoptosis. PS exposure was accompanied by altered plasma membrane phospholipid packing and enhanced inward movement of both alkyl- and acyl-linked choline-containing phospholipids. As these phospholipid movements were not accompanied by evidence of either actin-dependent or actin-independent endocytosis/pinocytosis, the data are strongly supportive of phospholipid movement by flip-flop across the plasma membrane. Furthermore we present evidence that phospholipid flip-flop and membrane packing changes occurred in “raft” membranes at the uropod of polarized neutrophils, and that plasma membrane PLSCR1 co-localized to these same domains. Reagents—Cholera toxin B (CT-B)-Alexa 555, FM 1-43, annexin V-Alexa 488, fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin, 6-((N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)hexanoyl)sphingosyl phosphocholine (NBD-sphingomyelin), and Lucifer Yellow were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). 1-Palmitoyl-2-[12-[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]hexanoyl[-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine] (NBD-PS) and 1-palmitoyl-2-[12-[(7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]hexanoyl[-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine] (NBD-PC) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Radiolabeled 1-O-[hexadecyl-1′,2′-3H(N)]2-N-methylcarbamyl-platelet activating factor (cPAF) was synthesized by PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Anti-CD55 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-CD11b was from Dako Corp. (Carpenteria, CA). Anti-CD45 clone BRA-55, fatty acid-free BSA, and fMLP were from Sigma. AEBSF, aprotinin, and leupeptin were from Calbiochem. Factor Va and anti-Factor Va were from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Rabbit PLSCR1 antiserum was raised against the 14 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of PLSCR1 (sequence CESTGSQEQKSGVW). Cell Isolation and Culture—Using endotoxin-free reagents and plasticware, human neutrophils were isolated by the plasma Percoll method as described previously (29Haslett C. Guthrie L.A. Kopaniak M.M. Johnston Jr., R.B. Henson P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 101-110PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, all incubations were done in NBD buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2,5mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) or Krebs-Ringer phosphate-dextrose (KRPD) buffer (0.9% saline, 4.8 mm KCl, 0.93 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 3.1 mm NaH2PO4, 12.5 mm Na2HPO4, 5% dextrose) with designated amounts of fatty acid-free BSA. T-Rex-293 cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 humidified incubator. cPAF Uptake—Uptake of radiolabeled cPAF was carried out as described previously (24Frasch S.C. Henson P.M. Kailey J.M. Richter D.A. Janes M.S. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23065-23073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Uptake of [3H]cPAF took place over the last 5 min of stimulation with fMLP at 37 °C. Samples were diluted with an equal volume of ice-cold 10% BSA in KRPD buffer and washed two more times with 5% BSA in KRPD buffer at 4 °C to remove outer leaflet lipid. The cell pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of 1% Triton X-100. Uptake of labeled lipid was determined by scintillation counting. NBD-PS, NBD-PC, NBD-sphingomyelin, Annexin V, and Factor Va Staining—NBD-PC (2.5 μg), NBD-PS (2.5 μg), or NBD-sphingomyelin (5.0 μg) was dried under nitrogen and resuspended in 20 μl of NBD buffer and 180 μl of propidium iodide (50 μg/ml stock). Neutrophils were stimulated as described at a concentration of 5 × 106/ml in NBD buffer with 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.25% BSA. Following stimulation, a final concentration of 1.25 μg/ml NBD-PC or NBD-PS or 2.5 μg/ml NBD-sphingomyelin was added to 100 μl of cells at 37 °C for 5 min. Outer leaflet lipid was removed by diluting cells with an equal volume of ice-cold 10% BSA in NBD buffer followed by two additional washes at 4 °C with 5% BSA in NBD buffer. Cells were resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold NBD buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry. For annexin V staining, 1 × 106 cells in 100 μl of NBD buffer with 2.5 mm CaCl2, annexin V-Alexa 488 (1:50), and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, diluted with 400 μl of ice-cold NBD buffer with 2.5 mm CaCl2, and analyzed by flow cytometry. For activated Factor V (FVa) staining, 1 × 106 neutrophils in 100 μl NBD buffer with 1% BSA and 1 mm CaCl2 were transferred to 100 μlof FVa and propidium iodide (10 μg/ml and 5 μg/ml, respectively) or propidium iodide alone for the last 10 min of stimulation. Cells were then fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 3% paraformaldehyde, 3% sucrose in PBS, washed once, and incubated with 100 μl of anti-FVa antibody (final concentration of 10 μg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed once and incubated with 100 μl of anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 (1:100 in NBD buffer plus 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.1% BSA) for 30 min on ice, washed once, and analyzed by flow cytometry. For fluorescence microscopy, FVa staining was performed as for flow cytometry except in the absence of propidium iodide and incubated for 15 min at room temperature with Cy3 goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 diluted 1:100. Cells were mounted on coverslips with OPDA (20 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in 1 m Tris base (pH 8.5) diluted 1:1 with glycerol) and viewed with a Lieca DMRXA fluorescence microscope using a 63× oil (numerical aperture 1.32) Plan-Apo objective. Images were analyzed using Slidebook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc., Denver, CO). FM 1-43 and Lucifer Yellow Staining—Neutrophils at 10 × 106 cells/ml in NBD buffer with 0.05% BSA and 1 mm CaCl2 were stimulated with fMLP for the times indicated. For the last minute of stimulation, 5 × 105 cells were transferred to 450 μl of NBD buffer and FM 1-43 (final concentration of 2.0 μm) and allowed to incubate for an additional 1 min at 37 °C. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold NBD buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry. Lucifer Yellow staining was carried out as described previously (30Fittschen C. Henson P.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Raft Membrane Isolation—Neutrophils (300 × 106)at20 × 106/ml in KRPD buffer with 0.25% BSA were stimulated with fMLP for 15 min. Following stimulation, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm MES (pH 6.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm AEBSF, 1 mm NaF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin) and sonicated for 1 min on ice. Unbroken cells, nuclei, and debris were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was added to 2 ml of 80% sucrose in MES-buffered saline (25 mm MES (pH 6.5), 150 mm NaCl), and the lysates were centrifuged through a 10–40% continuous sucrose gradient for 18–24 h at 37,000 rpm at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, 1-ml fractions were harvested from the bottom by puncturing the tube with an 18-gauge needle. Protein concentrations in each fraction were determined by the Bradford protein assay (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), and 10 μg of protein were run on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed for PLSCR1 or CD55. Alkaline Phosphatase Assay—Sucrose density fractions were measured for alkaline phosphatase activity to identify rafts. Fraction samples (20 μl) were added to a 96-well flat bottom plate and mixed with 200 μl of reaction buffer (5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 100 mm 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (pH 10.0)). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for at least 15 min, and the absorbance was read in a microplate reader at 405 nm. Cloning and Transfection of PLSCR1—RNA isolated from Jurkat cells was synthesized to cDNA using a reverse transcriptase for PCR kit (Clontech Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was used as a template to amplify full-length PLSCR1 using the forward primer 5′-AAGAATTCGGCAGCCAGAGAACTGTTTTAA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-AAGAATTCGCAGTTTTTCAAAGGAAGTTTCA-3′, both of which have engineered an EcoRI restriction enzyme cloning site on the 5′ ends. The PCR product of the correct size was purified and cloned directly into the EcoRI sites of pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen), which allows the expression of the cloned gene in the presence of doxycycline. T-Rex-293 cells, expressing the tetracycline repressor, were transfected with PLSCR1 in the absence or presence of doxycycline to induce expression of PLSCR1 using FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection into lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), and 10 μg of protein were run on 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed for PLSCR1. PLSCR1, CD45, and Cholera Toxin B Staining—For PLSCR1 staining, neutrophils (2 × 106)at20 × 106/ml were blocked for 15 min on ice with 1% BSA in KRPD buffer and then incubated with either PLSCR1 serum (1:50) or preimmune serum (1:50) from the same rabbit on ice for an additional 30 min. Primary antibody was removed, and neutrophils (in KRPD buffer with 0.25% BSA) were stimulated with fMLP for 10 min at 37 °C, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, 3% sucrose in PBS at room temperature for 10 min, washed twice with PBS, and incubated with Cy3 goat anti-Rabbit F(ab′)2 diluted 1:100 for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed twice more with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry. For CD45, neutrophils were preincubated as above except with 10 μg/ml mouse anti-human CD45 or isotype control antibody, and Cy3 anti-mouse F(ab′)2 diluted 1:100 was used. For fluorescence microscopy, cells were pretreated with antibody as above or with CT-B-Alexa 555 diluted 1:200 and either settled for 20 min at room temperature on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (pretreated with 100 μg/ml in PBS at 4 °C overnight) followed by fMLP stimulation at 37 °C or stimulated in suspension. Following stimulation, cells were fixed as above and incubated for 15 min at room temperature with secondary antibody, washed three times with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS, stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin (1:250) and 5 μg/ml Hoechst in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, mounted with OPDA, and viewed with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope using a 63× oil (numerical aperture 1.4) Axiovert 200M objective. Images were analyzed using Slidebook software. Live Cell Imaging—Neutrophils (7.5 × 106 cells at 5 × 106/ml) in NBD buffer with 0.01% BSA, 1 mm EDTA, 300 μm EGTA, and either FM 1-43 or NBD-PC at a final concentration of 16 μm or 5 μg/ml, respectively, were placed in a BSA (0.01%)-coated Delta T dish (Bioptechs, Inc.) that was preheated to 37 °C. Neutrophils were stimulated with fMLP, and images were taken over 5 min with an inverted Olympus IX70 microscope equipped with a Sensicam camera connected to TILL-vision software (T.I.L.L. Photonics GmbH) every 3 s with a 500-ms exposure time for FM 1-43 and every 5 s with a 3-s exposure time for NBD-PC. Subcellular Fractionation—Neutrophil granules were isolated by Percoll density gradients from control neutrophils as described previously (32Kjeldsen L. Sengelov H. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane and secretory vesicles from control neutrophils were isolated by free flow electrophoresis as described previously (33Sengelov H. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). PS Exposure on fMLP-stimulated Neutrophils—Using FVa as a sensitive probe to detect outer leaflet PS (34Zhai X. Srivastava A. Drummond D.C. Daleke D. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5675-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we were able to demonstrate that fMLP stimulation resulted in transient PS exposure that was evident as early as 10 min and returned to base-line levels by 45 min (Fig. 1A). In contrast, this transient PS exposure was minimally detectable by the less sensitive annexin V binding (data not shown). PS exposure during fMLP stimulation was not accompanied by loss of aminophospholipid translocase activity as was seen during UV-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1B); indeed PS uptake during fMLP stimulation appeared to be enhanced. Nor was activation of caspase 3 or DNA degradation (data not shown) seen following stimulation with fMLP. These data demonstrate that transient PS exposure during neutrophil activation was not associated with apoptosis. PS Exposure Was Accompanied by Enhanced Uptake of Other Glycerophospholipids—To test whether the outward flop of endogenous PS was both specific for PS and unidirectional or alternatively was bidirectional as suggested by enhanced PS uptake observed in Fig. 1B, we tested whether exogenous phosphocholine-containing diradyl lipid probes presented to the activated neutrophil would be internalized. Using a non-hydrolyzable, alkyl-linked phosphocholine probe, c-PAF, fMLP stimulation resulted in enhanced phospholipid uptake that was rapid in onset, occurred as early as 5 min, and peaked at 15 min following stimulation (Fig. 1C). Enhanced phospholipid uptake did not result from stimulation of the PAF receptor by c-PAF as it occurred in the presence of the PAF receptor inhibitor WEB 2086 (data not shown) and was identical for the fluorescently labeled NBD-PC, an ester-linked phosphatidylcholine probe that does not stimulate the PAF receptor (Fig. 1D). As a positive control, neutrophils stimulated to undergo apoptosis with UV irradiation also showed increased phospholipid uptake of choline-containing probes (14Bratton D.L. Fadok V.A. Richter D.A.

GFLs signal through a common receptor tyrosine kinase (Ret) and one of the four ligand-binding co-receptors (GFRα1 to 4). Ligand-induced translocation of Ret to lipid rafts, where it interacts with the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src, is a prerequisite for full biological activity of these neurotrophic factors. This interaction and subsequent activation of Src are required for GFL-mediated neuronal survival, neurite outgrowth, or cell proliferation. Here we show by multiple approaches that Ret tyrosine 981 constitutes the major binding site of the Src homology 2 domain of Src and therefore the primary residue responsible for Src activation upon Ret engagement. Other tyrosines such as 1015 and 1029 may contribute to the overall interaction between Ret and Src, as judged by overexpression experiments. By generating a phosphospecific antibody, we demonstrate that tyrosine 981 is a novel autophosphorylation site in Ret. Importantly, we also show that this tyrosine becomes phosphorylated in dissociated sympathetic neurons after ligand stimulation.

First identified as survival-promoting factors in vitro, the GFLs support the survival of cultured sympathetic, sensory, motor, enteric, and midbrain dopaminergic neurons (1Kotzbauer P.T. Lampe P.A.

Science. 1993; 260: 1130-1132Google Scholar). GFLs signal via a multicomponent receptor system, consisting of a common transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (Ret) that does not bind GFLs directly and one of the four glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked coreceptors (GFRα1to α4), which provide ligand specificity. Ret is alternatively spliced to produce at least two variants of identical sequence up to residue 1063, followed by a unique C-terminal sequence composed of either 9 or 51 amino acids (Ret9 and Ret51) (reviewed in Ref. 6Airaksinen M.S. Titievsky A. Saarma M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 313-325Google Scholar). Recent genetic experiments have confirmed the importance of GFLs for the development of the nervous system and revealed an unexpected role in kidney morphogenesis. Thus, targeted deletion of Ret (as well as GDNF or GFRα1) results in renal agenesis and lack of enteric neurons distal to the stomach, along with variable cell losses in the parasympathetic, sensory, and motor nervous systems (for reviews, see Refs. 7Airaksinen M.S. Saarma M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 383-394Google Scholar and 8Baloh R.H. Enomoto H. Johnson Jr., E.M. Milbrandt J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 103-110Google Scholar). Interestingly, a detailed analysis of knockout mice has expanded the roles of GFLs in vivo from neuronal survival to proliferation, migration, and axonal elongation of neuronal precursors (9Enomoto H. Crawford P.A. Gorodinsky A. Heuckeroth R.O. Johnson Jr., E.M. Milbrandt J. Development. 2001; 128: 3963-3974Google Scholar, 10Gianino S. Grider J.R. Cresswell J. Enomoto H. Heuckeroth R.O. Development. 2003; 130: 2187-2198Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, receptor tyrosine kinases undergo autophosphorylation of selected tyrosine residues, which become docking sites for adaptor proteins and enzymes that propagate the signal. Typically, these signaling proteins contain modular domains such as Src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine-binding domains that only recognize phosphotyrosines surrounded by specific sequences. In the case of Ret, some of these tyrosines as well as their binding partners have been identified and characterized. Tyr905 is conserved in many receptor tyrosine kinases and lies in the activation loop of the kinase domain. Mutation of this site causes a severe but not complete decrease in Ret activity. This tyrosine serves also as a binding site for Grb10 and Grb7 (11Pandey A. Duan H. Di Fiore P.P. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21461-21463Google Scholar, 12Pandey A. Liu X. Dixon J.E. Di Fiore P.P. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10607-10610Google Scholar). Phospholipase C-γ and Grb2 bind to Tyr1015 and Tyr1096 (which is only present in Ret51), respectively (13Borrello M.G. Alberti L. Arighi E. Bongarzone I. Battistini C. Bardelli A. Pasini B. Piutti C. Rizzetti M.G. Mondellini P. Radice M.T. Pierotti M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2151-2163Google Scholar, 14Alberti L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12691-12694Google Scholar). Besides these residues, other tyrosines such as Tyr1029 have been identified as autophosphorylation sites in Ret, but their binding partners are currently unknown (23Liu X. Vega Q.C. Decker R.A. Pandey A. Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5309-5312Google Scholar). The same work also suggested the presence of more potential autophosphorylated tyrosines in the receptor, which remain to be mapped. We and others have shown that one important mediator of GFL bioactivity is the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Src. The activity of this enzyme is necessary for full GDNF-induced neuronal survival and differentiation (24Encinas M. Tansey M.G. Tsui-Pierchala B.A. Comella J.X. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1464-1472Google Scholar) as well as Ret-mediated cell proliferation (25Melillo R.M. Barone M.V. Lupoli G. Cirafici A.M. Carlomagno F. Visconti R. Matoskova B. Di Fiore P.P. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Santoro M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1120-1126Google Scholar). The interaction between Src and Ret occurs only after the receptor translocates to specialized membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts, in response to ligand stimulation (26Tansey M.G. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 611-623Google Scholar). At least part of the interaction is dependent on the direct binding of the SH2 domain of Src to one or more yet unidentified tyrosines on Ret (26Tansey M.G. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 611-623Google Scholar). In the present work, we identify tyrosine 981 as the major Src-binding residue of the receptor. We also show that tyrosines 1015 and 1029 partially contribute to the overall binding of Src to Ret. By generating a phosphospecific antibody to this residue, we demonstrate that Tyr981 is a novel Ret autophosphorylation site. Finally, mutation of tyrosine 981 to phenylalanine reduces GDNF-mediated survival in transfected cerebellar granule neurons in culture. Cell Lines, Transfection, and Plasmids—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 1.4 mm l-glutamine. NBL-S neuroblastoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Sigma) plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 1.4 mm l-glutamine. 293 cells were seeded in 6-well dishes (Falcon; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and co-transfected with Ret mutants, GFRα1, and Src by the calcium phosphate method. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 3 h, stimulated with 50 ng/ml GDNF for 10 min, and processed for analysis. Ret mutants were generated by PCR mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing. The Δ1014 Ret mutant is truncated at amino acid 1014 of human Ret and has a C-terminal Myc tag. The expression plasmids coding for Src, GFRα1, Ret9, and Ret51 are described elsewhere (26Tansey M.G. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 611-623Google Scholar, 24Encinas M. Tansey M.G. Tsui-Pierchala B.A. Comella J.X. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1464-1472Google Scholar). The plasmid coding for the SH2 domain of Src fused to GST was a generous gift of Dr. Christine A. Cartwright (Stanford University) (27Chang B.Y. Conroy K.B. Machleder E.M. Cartwright C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3245-3256Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and GST Pull-down Assays—Cells were rinsed with PBS and lysed on 1 ml of ice-cold co-immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2VO4 plus complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science)). Cleared lysates were typically split in two 400-μl aliquots that were subjected to either immunoprecipitation or GST pull-down. The rest of the lysate was saved for immunoblot analysis. Immunoprecipitation was carried out at 4 °C for 2 h or overnight by using the indicated antibodies in the presence of protein A- and/or protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with co-immunoprecipitation buffer, and resuspended in Laemmli's buffer. Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation included anti-Ret9 (C-19G), anti-Ret51 (C-20), and anti-Myc (9E10) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the extracellular domain of Ret generated previously in our laboratories. For pull-down experiments, lysates were incubated with 5 μg of recombinant GST-Src SH2 fusion protein for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C, collected with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), washed three times with co-immunoprecipitation buffer, and resuspended in Laemmli's buffer. The recombinant fusion protein was expressed in DH5α Escherichia coli, purified by standard glutathione-Sepharose chromatography, and dialyzed. When needed, the pull-down assay was performed in the presence of a 20 μm concentration of the indicated phosphopeptides. For details on the sequence of Tyr(P)905, Tyr(P)1015, Tyr(P)1062, and Tyr(P)1096 phosphopeptides, see Ref. 28Tsui-Pierchala B.A. Ahrens R.C. Crowder R.J. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34618-34625Google Scholar. The sequences of Tyr(P)952 and Tyr(P)981 phosphopeptides were CLGGNPY(PO4)PGIPP and CSEEMY(PO4)RLMLQ, respectively. Immunoblot and Far Western Analysis—Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and blocked in TBST (0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline) containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. Membranes were next incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody in TBST containing 2% bovine serum albumin, washed three times with TBST, and then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The immunoblots were finally washed with TBST and developed with a chemiluminescent substrate (Supersignal; Pierce). For Far Western analysis, Ret immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P as above. Membranes were then incubated with 2 μg/ml of GST-Src SH2 diluted in TBST containing 2% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with a monoclonal anti-GST antibody (Covance Research Products Inc., Richmond, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used to develop the blots as above. The antibodies used for immunoblot analysis were as follows: anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions (Charlottesville, VA), anti-Ret9 (C-19 rabbit) and anti-Src (B12) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-phospho-Src (Tyr416) from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and anti-phospho-Tyr905 Ret (42Postigo A. Calella A.M. Fritzsch B. Knipper M. Katz D. Eilers A. Schimmang T. Lewin G.R. Klein R. Minichiello L. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 633-645Google Scholar). Membranes were stripped in 125 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 65 °C. Antibody Production—The antibody to phosphorylated Tyr981 of Ret was produced by first generating a peptide containing the sequence CSEEMY(PO4)RLMLQ (Biomolecules Midwest Inc., Waterloo, IL). This peptide was covalently bound to the large carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin via their N-terminal cysteine residues by using maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). The protein conjugates were then injected into rabbits (Covance), and the sera were tested for specific antibody production by Western analysis. The highest titer antiserum was affinity-purified by binding the antibodies to affinity columns produced by covalently linking the corresponding phosphopeptide to an agarose resin (Pierce). The nonspecific antibodies were washed off the column, and the specific antibodies were eluted by using both acidic (100 mm glycine, pH 2.5) and basic (100 mm triethylamine, pH 11) buffers. These eluates were then pooled, dialyzed, and concentrated with a Centriprep centrifugal device (Millipore). Sympathetic Neuron Cultures—Sympathetic neurons from the rat superior cervical ganglia were dissociated and maintained in vitro as described previously (29Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1207-1222Google Scholar). Sympathetic neurons were maintained for 9–12 days in vitro in the presence of nerve growth factor (50 ng/ml) and then switched to medium containing a lower concentration of nerve growth factor (2 ng/ml) for 24 h prior to stimulation with GDNF (50 ng/ml) for the length of time described. Cerebellar Granule Cell Survival—Rat cerebellar granule cell dissection and cultures were performed at postnatal day 7, as originally described by in Ref. 30D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Google Scholar and as modified in Ref. 31Miller T.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Google Scholar. Granule cell transfection was performed by using a calcium phosphate protocol (32Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Google Scholar) modified as in Ref. 33Moulder K.L. Onodera O. Burke J.R. Strittmatter W.J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 705-715Google Scholar. Specifically, 250 ng of EGFP (Clontech) were co-transfected with 250 ng of Ret and 500 ng of GFRα1 per well in four-well dishes (Nunc, Naperville, IL). Two days after transfection, the initial number of EGFP-positive cells in designated fields (usually 150–200 cells) was counted. Cultures were rinsed three times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and switched to high potassium plus serum medium (K25+S, basal medium Eagle (Invitrogen) plus 10% fetal bovine serum and a final concentration of 25 mm KCl), low potassium without serum medium (K5-S), or K5-S supplemented with 50 ng/ml GDNF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 48 h. After this period, the number of EGFP-positive cells remaining in the same fields was scored in a blinded manner to obtain the percentage of neuronal survival. Ret Kinase Activity Is Necessary but Not Sufficient for Src Binding—We and others have demonstrated that Src can directly bind to activated Ret in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner (24Encinas M. Tansey M.G. Tsui-Pierchala B.A. Comella J.X. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1464-1472Google Scholar, 25Melillo R.M. Barone M.V. Lupoli G. Cirafici A.M. Carlomagno F. Visconti R. Matoskova B. Di Fiore P.P. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Santoro M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1120-1126Google Scholar, 26Tansey M.G. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 611-623Google Scholar). In an attempt to map the Src binding tyrosine(s) in Ret, we constructed different receptor mutants and transiently co-transfected them together with Src in 293 cells. Simple overexpression of wild type Ret induced ligand-independent activation of its kinase activity, as judged by phosphotyrosine blotting of Ret immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1A). However, optimal co-immunoprecipitation of Src was not achieved unless cells were co-transfected with GFRα1 and stimulated with GDNF, despite the fact that total Ret phosphorylation was not significantly increased by the presence of ligand. In contrast, Far Western analysis using the SH2 domain of Src fused to GST (GST-Src SH2) as a probe revealed the presence of the Src docking tyrosine(s) in Ret in both control and GDNF-stimulated cells, with no further effect of ligand (Fig. 1A). Finally, tyrosines 905, 1015, 1062, and 1096 were also phosphorylated to comparable extents under both conditions (data not shown), as assessed by immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibodies (28Tsui-Pierchala B.A. Ahrens R.C. Crowder R.J. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34618-34625Google Scholar). These results are consistent with our previous observations, underscoring the necessity of ligand-mediated translocation of Ret to lipid rafts to achieve Src binding (and optimal biological responses) but not for phosphorylation and generation of Src binding site(s) in the receptor (24Encinas M. Tansey M.G. Tsui-Pierchala B.A. Comella J.X. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1464-1472Google Scholar, 26Tansey M.G. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 611-623Google Scholar). The interaction of Src with Ret is dependent on the binding of the Src SH2 domain to phosphorylated tyrosine(s) in Ret (26Tansey M.G. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 611-623Google Scholar). Moreover, at least one of these phosphotyrosines is mapped within the juxtamembrane or the kinase domains of one oncogenic form of Ret (25Melillo R.M. Barone M.V. Lupoli G. Cirafici A.M. Carlomagno F. Visconti R. Matoskova B. Di Fiore P.P. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Santoro M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1120-1126Google Scholar). To confirm the latter result in the context of the Ret proto-oncogene, we used a mutant of the receptor truncated at the end of the kinase domain (residue 1014) and, therefore, lacking several autophosphorylation tyrosines (residues 1015, 1062, and 1096). A Myc tag was added at the C terminus of the mutant to facilitate its manipulation. Pull-down assays using GST-Src SH2 revealed that the mutant receptor retained the ability to interact with this domain (Fig. 1B), confirming the existence of Src binding site(s) upstream of residue 1014. As expected, the introduction of a point mutation (K758M) in the ATP binding site of Ret kinase that renders a catalytically inactive receptor abolished the interaction (Fig. 1B), confirming that association of the Src SH2 domain with Ret depends on an intact kinase activity of the receptor. Ret Tyrosine 981 Constitutes a Major Src Binding Site—The optimal consensus sequence for the SH2 domain of Src has been determined to be pYEEI by screening of a phosphopeptide library (34Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Google Scholar). In the same study, Met, Leu, and Val are also preferred residues at position +3 (three amino acids C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine). Moreover, structural studies suggest that the +3 residue is critical for SH2 binding to synthetic phosphopeptides (35Waksman G. Shoelson S.E. Pant N. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1993; 72: 779-790Google Scholar). Since none of the tyrosines present in the juxtamembrane or the kinase domains of Ret fit the optimal sequence, we decided to analyze those that have one of the above residues at position +3 (Fig. 2). Thus, we generated tyrosine-to-phenylalanine point mutants of residues 752, 809, 952, and 981 in the context of Ret51. In addition, we used the catalytically compromised K758M and Y905F mutants to assess whether phosphorylation-independent binding of Src to Ret also occurred (by means of other Src domains such as the Src homology 3 or the unique domains). Fig. 2 shows a summary of the structure of Ret and the mutants used in this study. Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that neither Tyr752 nor Tyr809 was relevant for Src binding, since mutation of these sites did not impair the interaction of Ret with Src. In contrast, the amount of Src co-immunoprecipitated by K758M and Y905F was greatly reduced as compared with wild type Ret, suggesting that most of the interaction between Src and Ret relies on the binding of the Src SH2 domain to one or more phosphotyrosines in the receptor, with minor or no participation of other Src domains. Finally, Y952F and Y981F mutants showed a striking loss of interaction with Src, although some residual binding was observed when compared with either K758M or Y905F (Fig. 3). However, the global phosphotyrosine content of Y952F mutant was severely reduced, making it difficult to interpret the role of this tyrosine in Src binding. This reduction in the phosphotyrosine content of Y952F was due to a decreased kinase activity of the mutated receptor, as revealed by a parallel reduction in the phosphorylation of Tyr905 (data not shown). Binding of the SH2 domain of Src to phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinases promotes Src activation, which can be monitored by assessing the level of Src autophosphorylation on tyrosine 416 (36Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the degree of phosphorylation of that tyrosine as an indicator of Src binding to Ret. Lysates from 293 cells expressing GFRα1 along with the indicated Ret mutants and stimulated with GDNF were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with a specific p-Y416-Src antibody (Fig. 4A, bottom two panels). Phosphorylation of this tyrosine correlated well with the degree of kinase activity of Ret mutants, except for Y981F mutation, which caused a marked but not complete reduction of Src phosphorylation, despite showing levels of kinase activity comparable with those of wild type Ret. In contrast, the Y952F receptor, despite its severely compromised kinase activity, induced levels of Src autophosphorylation similar to those promoted by Y981F, suggesting that tyrosine 952 does not contribute to Src phosphorylation (Fig. 4A, bottom two panels). Therefore, Tyr981 appears to be involved in Src binding by two independent approaches: co-immunoprecipitation and Src autophosphorylation. Since co-immunoprecipitation experiments cannot discriminate between direct or indirect association, we conducted both Far Western and GST pull-down experiments (using the GST-Src SH2 recombinant protein) to determine whether Tyr981 represents a direct binding residue for the SH2 domain of Src. Surprisingly, only a very modest reduction of this binding was observed by either method (Fig. 4A, top four panels), suggesting that additional sites outside the kinase domain of Ret may exist. Alternatively, Tyr981 might not constitute a direct binding site for Src. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we introduced a Y981F point mutation in the context of the Δ1014 truncated Ret and tested its ability to bind the SH2 domain of Src in GST pull-down assays. As shown in Fig. 4B, the binding of Δ1014/Y981F Ret to Src SH2 was virtually undetectable. For comparison, we also included a Δ1014/Y905F mutant, which bound with similar or even higher affinity to GST-Src SH2 than Δ1014/Y981F, although its total tyrosine phosphorylation was marginal. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that Tyr981 is a major Src binding site in Ret but additional sites exist beyond residue 1014. Tyrosine 1096 Interacts with the SH2 Domain of Src in Vitro but Does Not Contribute to Src Binding in Vivo—In an attempt to map these putative additional sites, we generated a series of tyrosine-to-phenylalanine single mutants of residues 1015, 1029, 1062, and 1096, which constitute Ret autophosphorylation sites located C-terminal to the kinase domain of the receptor (23Liu X. Vega Q.C. Decker R.A. Pandey A. Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5309-5312Google Scholar, 28Tsui-Pierchala B.A. Ahrens R.C. Crowder R.J. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34618-34625Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed a decrease in interaction of mutants Y1015F, Y1029F, and, to a lesser extent, Y1062F, whereas Y1096F co-immunoprecipitated the same amount of Src as wild type Ret. However, neither pull-down assays nor phospho-Src immunoblot showed a reproducible effect on Src binding/activation by any of the above mutants (Fig. 5A). Double mutants consisting of Y981F plus either Y1015F or Y1029F did not show any further decrease in the pull-down assay as compared with single Y981F (data not shown). We reasoned that perhaps overexpression of Ret was leading to its aberrant phosphorylation on additional residues that might be providing ectopic docking sites for Src. Therefore, we decided to use a more physiological model in which wild type, endogenous Ret was phosphorylated only in response to ligand. GDNF-stimulated NBL-S human neuroblastoma cells, which express both Ret and GFRα1, were used for this purpose. To test the role of specific tyrosines, a competitive GST pull-down assay was performed with GST-Src SH2 in the presence of phosphopeptides comprising the sequences around tyrosines 905, 952, 981, 1015, 1062, and 1096. Phosphopeptides containing tyrosines 952 and 981 competed with Ret for the binding of GST-Src SH2 with similar efficiency, whereas phosphopeptides for tyrosines 905, 1015, and 1062 peptides had no effect (Fig. 5B). Surprisingly, the phosphopeptide containing tyrosine 1096 was the best competitor, causing a complete blockade of the binding, although the Y1096F mutant did not show a decreased interaction with Src in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 5, compare A and B). Thus, the binding of Src SH2 to Tyr1096 apparently takes place in vitro but not in intact cells (see “Discussion”). Analysis of Point Mutations in the Ret9 Splice Isoform—The above result (strong binding of Src SH2 to tyrosine 1096 in vitro) may explain why the drastic reduction in Src co-immunoprecipitation seen with some Ret mutants did not translate to a similar decrease in binding to GST-Src SH2 in both pull-down and Far Western analysis (e.g. compare the effect of Y981F mutation in Figs. 3 and 4A). Since phospho-Tyr1096 tightly binds GST-Src SH2 in vitro, the contribution of other residues to the overall binding of Ret to that domain may be masked by that tyrosine (note, however, that co-immunoprecipitation indicated that Tyr1096 had no role in Src binding in intact cells). Therefore, we d"
https://openalex.org/W2171960272,"Two key regulatory enzymes in the bile acid biosynthesis pathway are cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase/CYP7A1 (7α-hydroxylase) and sterol 12α-hydroxylase/CYP8B1 (12α-hydroxylase). It has been shown previously that hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF-4) and the α1-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) are activators of 7α-and 12α-hydroxylase transcription and that the small heterodimer partner (SHP) suppresses bile acid biosynthesis by heterodimerizing with FTF. However, the role of FTF in bile acid biosynthesis has been studied only in tissue culture systems. In heterozygous FTF knockout mice, 7α- and 12α-hydroxylase genes were expressed at 5-7-fold higher levels than in wild-type mice, an apparent direct contradiction to previous in vitro observations. This higher expression of the 7α- and 12α-hydroxylase genes resulted in a 33% higher bile acid pool in their gallbladders, bile more enriched in cholic acid, and a 13% decrease in plasma cholesterol levels. Adenovirus-mediated FTF overexpression in wild-type mice resulted in 10-fold lower expression of the 7α- and 12α-hydroxylase genes and up to 8-fold higher SHP expression, highlighting the dual role that FTF plays in different promoters. Shorter overexpression times still resulted in lower 7α- and 12α-hydroxylase expression, but unchanged SHP expression, suggesting that two different mechanisms are involved in the FTF-mediated suppression of 7α- and 12α-hydroxylase expression. This FTF-mediated suppression of the expression of two bile acid biosynthesis genes resulted in a 3-fold lower rate of bile acid synthesis in a rat bile fistula animal model. Based on these observations and on protein binding studies performed in vitro and by chromatin immunoprecipitation, we hypothesize that FTF has two synergetic effects that contribute to its role in bile acid biosynthesis: 1) it has the ability to activate the expression of SHP, which in turn heterodimerizes and suppresses FTF transactivation activity; and 2) it occupies the FTF/HNF-4 recognition site within the 7α- and 12α-hydroxylase promoters, which can otherwise be occupied by a factor (HNF-4) that cannot be suppressed by SHP. Two key regulatory enzymes in the bile acid biosynthesis pathway are cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase/CYP7A1 (7α-hydroxylase) and sterol 12α-hydroxylase/CYP8B1 (12α-hydroxylase).

In mammals, cholesterol is required for several important functions such as cell growth and differentiation, maintenance of cell membrane integrity and as a precursor of steroid hormones. Another important biological function of cholesterol is its role as a bile acid precursor. Bile acid synthesis is responsible for the catabolism of >50% of body cholesterol in mammals. The catalytic process of cholesterol to bile acids occurs exclusively in the liver (1Russell D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 137-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). It is well known that both genetic defects and environmental factors lead to disarrangements in cholesterol metabolism, which, in turn, produce many different degenerative conditions such as hypercholesterolemia and cholesterol gallstone disease (2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4288) Google Scholar, 3Shaw R. Elliot W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7177-7182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conversion of cholesterol to cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid (the primary bile acids in humans and rodents) is done through four routes (1Russell D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 137-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Two of the routes that are well studied are the “classic” or “neutral” pathway and the “alternative” or “acidic” pathway. In the neutral pathway, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (referred to throughout as 7α-hydroxylase) hydroxylates cholesterol to 7α-hydroxycholesterol. This is the rate-limiting and controlling step. In the alternative pathway, cholesterol is hydroxylated to produce 27-hydroxycholesterol, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase/CYP27A1. This oxysterol then undergoes 7α-hydroxylation by the enzyme oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (1Russell D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 137-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). 7α-Hydroxycholesterol is ultimately converted into cholic acid by the action of sterol 12α-hydroxylase/CYP8B1 (referred to throughout as 12α-hydroxylase), which is the specific step in cholic acid synthesis. If 12α-hydroxylase is not present or active, then the 7α-hydroxycholesterol is transformed to chenodeoxycholic acid. Chenodeoxycholic acid has higher hydrophobicity compared with cholic acid. Thus, 12α-hydroxylase determines the hydrophobicity of the bile acid pool and the absorption of dietary sterols, one of the primary functions of bile acids (1Russell D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 137-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). The ratio of cholic acid to chenodeoxycholic acid has been postulated to play a role in cholesterol gallstone formation (3Shaw R. Elliot W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7177-7182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and affects bile cholesterol and phospholipid secretion, thus altering intestinal cholesterol absorption and receptor-mediated lipoprotein uptake by the hepatocyte (4Heuman D.M. Hylemon P.B. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1161-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bile acids negatively regulate the transcription of the 7α-hydroxylase gene, which controls output from the classic pathway. Recent studies have delineated many of the factors involved in this regulation. LRH-1 (liver receptor homolog-1), also known as CYP7A promoter-binding factor (5Nitta M. Ku S. Brown C. Okamoto A.Y.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) genes. We refer to this nuclear receptor as FTF. Bile acids activate the transcription of the small heterodimer partner (SHP) via binding of the hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor to its binding site in the SHP promoter. In turn, it has been proposed that SHP dimerizes with FTF and diminishes its activity on the 7α-hydroxylase promoter by mechanisms not yet well understood (11Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Roth M.E. Maloney P.R. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Mol.

Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism has recently been proposed for this down-regulation of 7α-hydroxylase transcription that involves the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (13Gupta S. Stravitz R.T. Dent P. Hylemon P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15816-15822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Via this mechanism, the JNK pathway is activated by bile acids, which in turn activate c-Jun, resulting in higher SHP transcription. Another SHP-independent mechanism has also been proposed for the down-regulation of 7α-hydroxylase transcription in which bile acids suppress 7α-hydroxylase transcription by inhibiting the transactivation potential of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF-4), which binds to and activates the 7α-hydroxylase promoter (15Crestani M. Sadeghpour A. Stroup D. Galli G. Chiang J.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2192-2200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), through a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (14De Fabiani E. Mitro N. Anzulovich A.C. Pinelli A. Galli G. Crestani M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30708-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Finally, a fourth mechanism has been proposed to be involved in the bile acid-mediated regulation of 7α-hydroxylase transcription, which also implicates HNF-4 (46De Fabiani E. Mitro N. Gilardi F. Caruso D. Galli G. Crestani M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39124-39132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Via this mechanism, bile acids impair the recruitment of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein by HNF-4. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that bile acid-induced dissociation of coactivators from HNF-4 decreases the recruitment of RNA polymerase II on the core promoter and downstream in the 3′-untranslated regions of these two genes, reflecting the reduction of gene transcription (14De Fabiani E. Mitro N. Anzulovich A.C. Pinelli A. Galli G. Crestani M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30708-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). All of these studies have been carried out in cells in culture and in vitro. Our laboratory has performed several studies directed toward understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the transcription and bile acid-mediated regulation of the 12α-hydroxylase gene. All of these studies have also been carried out in cells in culture and in vitro. We have shown that FTF is required for 12α-hydroxylase promoter activity (9del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17793-17799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). FTF binds to two sites within the rat 12α-hydroxylase promoter, and both sites are required for both promoter activity and bile acid-mediated regulation. We have also shown that SHP is involved in the down-regulation of the 12α-hydroxylase promoter (10del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SHP in HepG2 cells suppresses 12α-hydroxylase promoter activity. We have also shown that, despite the interaction between HNF-4 and SHP and the apparent requirement for HNF-4 for 12α-hydroxylase promoter activity, bile acids suppress only FTF-activated 12α-hydroxylase promoters. Although FTF was first functionally characterized as a key transcription factor for the transcription of the α1-fetoprotein (AFP) gene (hence its name), in the last few years, it has become apparent that it might play a major role in bile acid metabolism and more generally in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. In addition to the role that FTF seems to play in the transcription and regulation of the 7α- and 12α-hydroxylase genes, it has been proposed recently that it might also be involved in intestinal bile acid transport through its involvement in the transcription and regulation of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (16Chen F. Ma L. Dawson P.A. Sinal C.J. Sehayek E. Gonzalez F.J. Breslow J. Ananthanarayanan M. Shneider B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19909-19916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Also, human enterocyte MRP3 (multidrug resistance protein-3) has been reported to work as a bile acid transporter in human enterocytes, and its expression is induced by bile acids through a fundamentally different mechanism than the mechanism involved in the bile acid-mediated regulation of 7α- and 12α-hydroxylase genes (17Inokuchi A. Hinoshita E. Iwamoto Y. Kohno K. Kuwano M. Uchiumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46822-46829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). FTF also participates in self-regulation of its transcription (18Pare J.F. Roy S. Galarneau L. Belánger L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13136-13144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed to be involved also in the transcription and regulation of SHP (12Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar, 19Lee Y.K. Parker K.L. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20869-20873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), potentially playing an additional role in the regulation of the transcription of the 7α-and 12α-hydroxylase genes. In addition, FTF is required for reverse cholesterol transport because it induces the expression of the human cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene (20Luo Y. Liang C.P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24767-24773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and the scavenger receptor class B type I gene (21Schoonjans K. Annicotte J.S. Huby T. Botrugno O.A. Fayard E. Ueda Y. Chapman J. Auwerx J. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, as is the case for the transcriptional regulation of the 7α- and 12α-hydroxylase genes, all the evidence for these roles of FTF comes from experiments in tissue culture cells. As indicated above, the involvement of FTF in bile acid synthesis has been studied only in tissue culture. Animal studies should be performed to demonstrate whether FTF is indeed involved in the transcription of key genes implicated in bile acid biosynthesis and regulation. We have used three complementary animal models to study the in vivo role of FTF in bile acid biosynthesis. First, a knockout mouse model in which the FTF gene has been deleted was used. Second, in vivo overexpression of FTF in the mouse was accomplished using an adenovirus system. Third, we used a bile fistula animal model to quantify bile acid synthesis in vivo in rats overexpressing FTF. All three models show that FTF acts as a suppressor of 7α- and 12α-hydroxylase gene expression. These studies, combined with in vitro gel retardation assays and ChIP experiments, led us to hypothesize that FTF has two synergetic effects that contribute to its role in bile acid biosynthesis: 1) it has the ability to activate the expression of SHP, which in turn heterodimerizes and suppresses FTF transactivation activity; and 2) it occupies the FTF/HNF-4 recognition site within the 7α-and 12α-hydroxylase promoters, which can otherwise be occupied by a nuclear receptor (HNF-4) that cannot be suppressed by SHP. Materials—Reagents used in DNA cloning and sequencing were from New England Biolabs Inc. and Invitrogen. Common laboratory chemicals were from Fisher, Sigma, or Bio-Rad. Oligonucleotides were prepared in the Medical College of Virginia DNA Synthesis Facility by the phosphoramidite method on an automated DNA synthesizer. Plasmids for in vitro synthesis of FTF and HNF-4 have been described previously (10del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Anti-FTF antibodies were prepared against amino acids 179-197 of the mouse FTF sequence and were affinity-purified before use. Anti-HNF-4 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Western Blot Analysis—Liver nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (22Subramanian A. Wang J. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 29: 2173-2178Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 10 μg of nuclear protein was fractionated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, incubated with the affinity-purified anti-FTF antibody (8 μg/ml), and processed with a Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Animals—All mice were ∼8 weeks of age at the time of the experiments. Mice were maintained in a 12-h light/12-h dark controlled environment with free access to water and standard laboratory rodent food. Harvesting of the indicated tissues was done at the middle of the dark period. FTF+/- mice were a generous gift from Dr. L. Belánger (Laval University, Quebec) and have been described previously (23Falender A.E. Lanz R. Malenfant D. Belánger L. Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 3598-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). FTF+/- mice were received at the Virginia Commonwealth Animal Facility after at least 10 generations of inbreeding. A colony was generated and used as described under “Results.” Heterozygous mice were detected by PCR analysis using oligonucleotides from the neomycin gene used in the generation of knock-in mice. FTF-null mice are embryonic lethal at embryonic day 7.5. For the bile acid synthesis rate quantification, age- and weight-matched adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 275 and 325 g were housed under controlled lighting conditions on a natural light/dark cycle (4 a.m. to 4 p.m.). For the overexpression experiments, male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories and maintained for 2 weeks prior to the experiments. They were injected with the indicated number of viral particles through the tail vein and harvested after either 3 or 5 days as indicated. Adenovirus Preparation and Propagation—The adenovirus construct used in this study was obtained through the Massey Cancer Center Shared Resource Facility of the Virginia Commonwealth University. pZeroTG/CMV-hFTF needed to create that construct was prepared as follows. A 1.6-kb fragment from pCI-hFTF (10del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) cut with SacII and ScaI was cloned into pCMX, which had been linearized with BamHI and blunt-ended, which resulted in pCMX-hFTF. An EcoRV/NheI fragment generated from pCMX-hFTF was cloned into the EcoRV site of pZeroTG/CMV. The resulting pZeroTG/CMV-hFTF plasmid was cotransformed with ClaI-linearized pTG/CMV (containing the entire Ad5dl324 genome) into Escherichia coli. Recombinant plasmids were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). Adenovirus DNA from the resulting plaques was further screened by analytical digestions for the presence of the insert. To purify the recombinant virus, the crude supernatant was carefully layered over a two-step CsCl gradient as described (24Pandak W.M. Ren S. Marques D. Hall E. Redford K. Mallonee D. Bohdan P. Heuman D.M. Gil G. Hylemon P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48158-48164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For the mouse experiments, a control virus was used that contained the LacZ sequence. For the rat experiments, the control virus used was prepared with empty pZeroTG/CMV. RNA Isolation and Quantification—Total liver RNA was isolated by the guanidine thiocyanate lysis/cesium chloride centrifugation method (25Ramirez M.I. Karaoglu D. Haro D. Barillas C. Bashirzadeh R. Gil G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2809-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or using the SV total RNA isolation kit (Promega). In some experiments, 7α-hydroxylase, 12α-hydroxylase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase, and cyclophilin mRNAs were quantified by RNase protection assay as described (26Gerbod-Giannone M.-C. del Castillo-Olivares A. Janciauskiene S. Gil G. Hylemon P.B. J. Biol.

Groups of age- and weight-matched animals were used in all experiments. Under brief methoxyflurane anesthesia, bile fistulas and intravenous cannulas were placed as described previously (4Heuman D.M. Hylemon P.B. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1161-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All animals received a continuous infusion of glucose/electrolyte replacement solution at 1.1 ml/h during the course of the experiment. Following surgery, the rats were housed in individual metabolic cages with free access to water and chow. Dietary intake, activity, and bile flow were carefully monitored. 1.5 × 1011 particles of the adenovirus (Ad) containing the human FTF cDNA in front of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (Ad-FTF) or the control virus were infused through the jugular immediately after surgery. Diverted bile was collected in 4-h increments throughout the course of the experiment. At the end of 72 h, animals were briefly anesthetized and decapitated, and blood was collected for determination of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Under these chronic biliary diverted conditions, bile acid secretion is equivalent to bile acid synthesis. Bile Acid Quantification and Bile Cholesterol and Phospholipids—Mouse gallbladders were collected on a piece of filter paper. Bile acids were extracted by the Folch method (27Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bile collected from the biliary diverted rats was also extracted by the Folch method. Conjugated bile acids were quantified from both types of samples by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (28Pandak W.M. Li Y.C. Chiang J.Y. Studer E.J.

The chloroform phase was stored for later analysis of cholesterol and phospholipids using a quantitative enzymatic assay from commercially available kits (Wako Bioproducts), with minor modifications, using 1 ml of the chloroform phase, which was evaporated under nitrogen before adding the color reagent. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described (10del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using 8 fmol of the indicated rat 12α-hydroxylase and AFP 32P-labeled DNA probes. In vitro proteins were prepared using the TnT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). ChIP—We used a modification of the method described by Weinmann and Farnham (29Weinmann A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods (Orlando). 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Briefly, cross-linking of proteins to DNA was accomplished by adding formaldehyde to 400 mg of chopped liver at a final concentration of 1% in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, followed by a 15-min incubation at room temperature. Glycine was added to a final concentration of 125 mm to stop the cross-linking reaction. Tissue was collected by centrifugation, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and disaggregated in 4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline with a Dounce homogenizer. Cells were resuspended in cell lysis buffer and incubated for 10 min in ice. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 7 ml of hypotonic nuclear lysis buffer. After 15 min on ice, glass beads (0.7 g, 212-300 μm) were added and sonicated five times for 15 s at setting 2.5 in a Sonic Dismembrator 550 (Misonix Inc.) to an average length of 500-1000 bp. The chromatin solution was adjusted to a protein concentration of 4.0 mg/ml. Chromatin aliquots corresponding to 100 μg of protein were precleared with 20 μl of pre-blocked staphylococcus A in a 300-μl final volume of radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h at 4 °C. Precleared chromatin was incubated with 1 μg of nonspecific antibody (sc-8954, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HNF-4 antibody H-171 (sc-8987, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or no antibody at 4 °C for 12 h. Immunoprecipitation, washing, and elution of immune complexes were carried out as described (29Weinmann A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods (Orlando). 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar). After cross-link reversions and RNase A and proteinase K digestions, samples were resuspended in 30 μl of sterile 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 1 mm EDTA, and 2 μl was used in each PCR with the primers shown in Table I. Total input chromatin samples (supernatants from no-antibody immunoprecipitations) were resuspended in 100 μl of sterile H2O and then diluted 1:10 before PCR.

https://openalex.org/W2019666686,"Recent observations have revealed that an unexpectedly high fraction--a few per cent--of the trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) that inhabit the Kuiper belt are binaries. The components have roughly equal masses, with very eccentric orbits that are wider than a hundred times the radius of the primary. Standard theories of binary asteroid formation tend to produce close binaries with circular orbits, so two models have been proposed to explain the unique characteristics of the TNOs. Both models, however, require extreme assumptions regarding the size distribution of the TNOs. Here we report a mechanism that is capable of producing binary TNOs with the observed properties during the early stages of their formation and growth. The only required assumption is that the TNOs were initially formed through gravitational instabilities in the protoplanetary dust disk. The basis of the mechanism is an exchange reaction in which a binary whose primary component is much more massive than the secondary interacts with a third body, whose mass is comparable to that of the primary. The low-mass secondary component is ejected and replaced by the third body in a wide but eccentric orbit."
https://openalex.org/W2134928477,"Carbonic-anhydrase (CA) inhibitors are used in the treatment of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP) and related channelopathies but their mechanism of action is unknown. Patch-clamp experiments and molecular modeling investigations were performed to evaluate the mechanism of actions of CA inhibitors on skeletal muscle Ca2+-activated-K+ (BK) channel of K+-deficient rats used as animal model of hypoPP. CA inhibitors showing different degree of CA inhibition such as acetazolamide (ACTZ), dichlorphenamide (DCP), hydrochlorthiazide (HCT), etoxzolamide (ETX), methazolamide (MTZ), and bendroflumethiazide (BFT), which lacks inhibitory effects on CA enzymes, were tested in vitro on BK channels. The application of ACTZ, BFT, ETX, and DCP to excised patches activated the BK channel with potency: ACTZ(DE50=7.3x10(-6)M)>BFT(DE50=5.93x10(-5)M)>ETX(DE50=1.17x10(-4)M)>>DCP. In contrast, MTZ and HCT failed to activate the BK channel. Molecular modeling studies showed that the capability of CA inhibitors to open the BK channel was related to the presence in their structures of an intra-molecular hydrogen bond with calculated inter-atomic distances ranging between 1.82 A degrees and 3.01 A degrees and of an aromatic ring poor of electrons. ACTZ, BFT, ETX, and DCP showed these pharmacofores, while MTZ and HCT did not. Our data indicate that the activation of BK channel is a property of CA inhibitors that interact with the channel subunit/s and that this effect is not related to their capability to inhibit the CA enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2045437403,"Models of DNA replication in yeast and Xenopus suggest that Mcm10p is required to generate the pre-initiation complex as well as progression of the replication fork during the elongation of DNA chains. In this report, we show that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mcm10p/Cdc23p binds to the S. pombe DNA polymerase (pol) α-primase complex in vitro by interacting specifically with the catalytic p180 subunit and stimulates DNA synthesis catalyzed by the pol α-primase complex with various primed DNA templates. We investigated the mechanism by which Mcm10p activates the polymerase activity of the pol α-primase complex by generating truncated derivatives of the full-length 593-amino acid Mcm10p. Their ability to stimulate pol α polymerase activity and bind to single-stranded DNA and to pol α were compared. Concomitant with increased deletion of the N-terminal region (from amino acids 95 to 415), Mcm10p derivatives lost their ability to stimulate pol α polymerase activity and bind to single-stranded DNA. Truncated derivatives of Mcm10p containing amino acids 1–416 retained the pol α binding activity, whereas the C terminus, amino acids 496–593, did not. These results demonstrate that both the single-stranded DNA binding and the pol α binding properties of Mcm10p play important roles in the activation. In accord with these findings, Mcm10p facilitated the binding of pol α-primase complex to primed DNA and formed a stable complex with pol α-primase on primed templates. A mutant that failed to activate or bind to DNA and pol α, was not observed in this complex. We suggest that the interaction of Mcm10p with the pol α-primase complex, its binding to single-stranded DNA, and its activation of the polymerase complex together contribute to its role in the elongation phase of DNA replication. Models of DNA replication in yeast and Xenopus suggest that Mcm10p is required to generate the pre-initiation complex as well as progression of the replication fork during the elongation of DNA chains.

Much progress has been made identifying proteins that assemble during early stages in replication prior to the start of DNA synthesis. These events are directed by origins of replication, which orchestrate formation of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) 1The abbreviations used are: pre-RC, pre-replication complex; pol, polymerase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; ds, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded; SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; RPA, replication protein A; sp, S. pombe. 1The abbreviations used are: pre-RC, pre-replication complex; pol, polymerase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; ds, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded; SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; RPA, replication protein A; sp, S. pombe. at origins during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. They include origin binding by the origin recognition complex and subsequent recruitment of Cdc6 and Cdt1, followed by the loading of the Mcm2-7 complex (1Maiorano D. Moreau J. Mechali M. Nature. 2000; 404: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 2Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Nurse P. Nature. 2000; 404: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Further progression is regulated by the cell cycle through the activation of two S phase promoting kinases, the S phase cyclin-dependent kinase and Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase. Activation of the pre-RC by these kinases promotes Cdc45 association with origins (3Zou L. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3086-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 4Mimura S. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5699-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), events that lead subsequently to DNA unwinding and the ordered assembly of the replication fork machinery. The DNA polymerase α-primase (pol α-primase) complex also plays an essential role in initiation by synthesizing short RNA primers required to begin both leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis. The four subunit structure of pol α-primase is conserved, and each subunit is essential for cell viability in yeast (5Sugino A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 319-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 6Wang T.S.-F. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. 31. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 461-493Google Scholar). The largest subunit of pol α-primase (p180) contains the DNA polymerase catalytic center (7Plevani P. Foiani M. Valsasnini P. Badaracco G. Cheriathundum E. Chang L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7102-7107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and elongates RNA primers of 8–12 nucleotides synthesized by primase. The catalytic center of primase is located within the p48 subunit (8Santocanale C. Foiani M. Lucchini G. Plevani P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1343-1348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which exists as a tight complex with p58 (9Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol.

The p58 subunit was shown to be required for distinct aspects of primer synthesis, including initiation and elongation (11Zerbe L.A. Kuchta R.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4891-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The fourth subunit of DNA pol α-primase, p70/β, is suggested to recruit the complex onto chromatin as a result of its cell cycle-regulated phosphorylated state (12Foiani M. Liberi G. Lucchini G. Plevani P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 14: 883-891Crossref Google Scholar, 13Desdouets C. Santocanale C. Drury L.S. Perkins G. Fioiani M. Plevani P. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4139-4146Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Polymerase α-primase subunits have been reported to interact with a number of replication proteins including Cdc45 (14Kukimoto I. Igaki H. Kanda T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), Dna2 (15Formosa T. Nittis T. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1459-1470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), RPA (16Dornreiter I. Erdile L.F.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3176-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), consistent with the idea that replication forks are large precisely assembled multiprotein complexes. Mcm10p has been implicated both in the initiation and elongation steps of DNA replication. MCM10 was first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using screens for mutants defective in DNA replication and for the stable maintenance of plasmids (20Solomon N.A. Wright M.B. Chang S. Buckley A.M. Dumas L.B. Gaber R.F. Yeast. 1992; 8: 273-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Merchant A.M. Kawasaki Y. Chen Y. Lei M. Tye B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3261-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Initiation at replication origins is drastically reduced in the mcm10-1 mutant, and replication across origins is impeded (21Merchant A.M. Kawasaki Y. Chen Y. Lei M. Tye B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3261-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 22Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 913-926PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in MCM10 result in a delay in the completion of DNA synthesis after cells are released from HU arrest (23Kawasaki Y. Hiraga S.-I. Sugino A. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 975-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting that Mcm10p is essential for continued fork progression. MCM10 mutants are suppressed by mutant MCM5 and MCM7 genes and are synthetically lethal with mutant genes of ORC, CDC45, DNA2, DPB11, and genes encoding subunits of DNA polymerase δ and ϵ (22Homesley L.

Seven new mutants named slm1–slm6 for synthetically lethal with mcm10 include mutations in genes that are allelic to MCM7, MCM2, CDC45, DNA2, and mutations in novel DNA repair genes represented by SLM2 and SLM6 (28Araki Y. Kawasaki Y. Sasanuma H. Tye B.K. Sugino A. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic interactions have been reported between Mcm10p and members of the Mcm2-7p family and the S. pombe Dfp1p/Dbf4p (29Sclafani R.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2111-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These interactions lead to the stimulation of the Hsk1/Cdc7-Dfp1/Dbf4p kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of Mcm2p and Mcm4p in vitro (30Lee J.-K. Seo Y.-S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2334-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, Mcm10p is required for the association of Mcm2-7p complex with origins at early stages of replication (22Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 913-926PubMed Google Scholar). However, depletion of Mcm10p from Xenopus extracts affects a later step of DNA replication, blocking the chromatin association of Cdc45p, events that lead to DNA unwinding, suggesting that Mcm10p is required for progression of the pre-RC to subsequent replication stages (31Wohlschlegel J.A. Dhar S.K. Prokhorova T.A. Dutta A. Walter J.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 233-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with recent results in S. pombe, where Cdc23 was shown to be required for Cdc45 chromatin association and did not affect earlier stages of initiation (32Gregan J. Lindner K. Brimage L. Franklin R. Namdar M. Hart E.A. Aves S.J. Kearsey S.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3876-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, Mcm10p appears to play important roles at all stages of DNA replication, like Cdc45 and the Mcm2-7 complex, and may be situated at the moving replication fork in association with the elongation machinery. In the course of studies with S. pombe Mcm10p/Cdc23p, we detected an interaction between Mcm10p and the pol α-primase complex. This interaction was specific for the catalytic subunit of the polymerase complex and prompted us to examine the influence of Mcm10p on the catalytic activity of pol α-primase. In this report, we demonstrate that Mcm10p can markedly stimulate the DNA polymerase activity of the complex and appears to do so by interacting with both single-stranded DNA and the p180 subunit, thus facilitating the binding of the polymerase complex to primed DNA. Construction of Recombinant Baculoviruses—Baculoviruses expressing each subunit of S. pombe pol α-primase complex were constructed by subcloning the cDNAs encoding full-length proteins into pFastBac1 (Invitrogen). pFastBac-p180 was constructed by PCR amplification of pREP81-p180 (kindly provided by T. S. Wang, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA) using the primers p180-1 (5′-TGT GCG CGC AAT CAT GAG AAA GAG AAA CGC-3′) and p180-2 (5′-AAA CTG CAG TCA CGA TGA AAA TAT CAG TCC-3′) to obtain the non-tagged p180 clone. Primers p180-1 and p180-3 (5′-AAA CTG CAG CGA TGA AAA TAT CAG TCC CAT-3′) were used to obtain the C-terminal His6-2Flag-tagged p180 clone. These products, as well as those described below, were subcloned into the BssHII and PstI sites of pFastBac1. pFastBacp70 was constructed by PCR amplification using primers p70-1 (5′-TGT GCG CGC AAC CAT GGA ATT TCC TAT CGA TGA TG-3′) and p70-2 (5′-AAA CTG CAG CTA ACG GTC TAT GGT AGA C-3′) to obtain the untagged p70 clone. Primers p70-1 and p70-3 (5′-AAA CTG CAG TAG TTT TAA AAT TTC TGC CTT G-3′) were used to construct the C-terminal His6-2Flag-tagged p70 clone. pFastBac-p58 was formed by PCR amplification of pREP81-spp2 using primers pSpp2-1 (5′-TGT GCG CGC AAC CAT GTT CAG AAC GAC CAA-3′) and pSpp2-2 (5′-AAA CTG CAG AGC TTA TGA TTC TAA ACT AAG TTG-3′) to obtain the untagged p58 clone, or primers pSpp2-1 and pSpp2-3 (5′-AAA CTG CAG CGA TGA AAA TAT CAG TCC CAT-3′) to obtain the C-terminal His6-2Flag-tagged p58 clone. pFastBac-p48 was prepared as described for pFastBac-p58, except that the PCR primers used were pSpp1-1 (5′-TGT GCG CGC AAC CAT GAC TGT TCA AAT CGA TGA ATT G-3′) and pSpp1-2 (5′-AAA CTG CAG AGC TTC CAT CCT TTC ATG-3′) to synthesize the non-tagged p48, or primers pSpp1-1 and pSpp1-3 (5′-AAA CTG CAG AAA TTC CAA ATT CTC ATG TTT TCT TTT-3′) to obtain the C-terminal His6-2Flag-tagged p48 clone. Expression and Purification of S. pombe pol α-Primase Subunits and Complexes—Sf9 cells were grown in Grace's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Co-infections with different combinations of viruses were used to prepare the pol α-primase subcomplexes (Fig. 1). The four-subunit pol α-primase complex was isolated from Sf9 cells infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10 in a 2-liter flask (250 ml of 2.0 × 106 cells/ml). Cells were harvested, lysed in 20 ml of Buffer L (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.1 m sodium glutamate, 10 mm MgC12, 1 mm KC1, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm benzamidine), incubated on ice for 15 min, followed by Dounce homogenization (10 strokes with a B pestle), sonication (three times each for 1 min), and centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (20 ml, 21.5 mg/ml) was mixed with 2 ml of Ni-NTA beads, the mixture rotated at 4 °C for 3 h, and bound proteins eluted in Buffer E (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.1 m sodium glutamate, 0.2 m imidazole, 1 mm MgC12, 10 mm KC1, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm benzamidine). Approximately 8 mg of protein was obtained from this step. To obtain homogeneous pol α-primase, the Ni-NTA fraction (350 μg) was subjected to glycerol gradient sedimentation on a 15–40% gradient. Approximately 23 μg of protein of the pure complex was recovered in peak fractions. Bacterial Expression and Purification of S. pombe Mcm10p—C-terminal His-tagged Mcm10p was cloned into a pET28 vector and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Freshly transformed BL21(DE3) (pET28-pMcm10) cells were grown with shaking at 25 °C in 1 liter of LB medium containing 40 μg/ml kanamycin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and induced (at an A590 of 0.6) with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated for 7 h at 16 °C. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 35 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HC1, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaC1, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm benzamidine). Cells were incubated for 1 h on ice in lysis buffer with 50 μg/ml lysozyme, disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with 3 ml of Ni-NTA beads (Invitrogen) pre-equilibrated with Buffer H/0.5 (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaC1, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgC12, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm benzamidine) and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with rocking. The beads were washed three times with 10 bead volumes of Buffer H/0.5 containing 25 mm imidazole, and bound proteins were eluted with an equal bead volume of Buffer H/0.5 containing 0.2 m imidazole, yielding ∼6 mg of Mcm10p. This material was diluted 2.0-fold in Buffer H plus 0-0.25 m NaC1 and applied to a heparin-agarose column (0.9 cm × 1.5 cm). The column was washed with two column volumes of Buffer H, 0.3 m NaC1, and bound proteins eluted with Buffer H, 0.6 m NaC1. The eluted protein peak (2 mg of protein) was pooled and an aliquot (250 μg of protein) was applied to a Sephadex-200 column (HR 10/30) in Buffer H, 0.4 m NaC1 to yield 100 μg of purified protein. Mcm10p preparations from the heparin-agarose step were used in immunoprecipitation, and nitrocellulose DNA binding reactions and Sephadex-200 column preparations were used in the replication and formation of DNA-protein complex assays described below. Truncated Mcm10p derivatives, Mcm10p-(96–593) containing amino acids 96–593, Mcm10p-(295–593), Mcm10p-(1–497), Mcm10p-(1–303), and Mcm10p-(1–230) were also cloned into a pET28 vector, expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3), and purified in a similar manner. The Mcm10p-(416–593) derivative did not bind to heparin-agarose, and for this reason this step was replaced by Q-Sepharose chromatography in Buffer H, 0.05 m NaC1 and Mcm10p-(416–593) was eluted with Buffer H, 0.15 m NaCl. Interactions between pol α-Primase Subunits and Mcm10p—Purified proteins (2 pmol each), shown in Fig. 1, were combined and incubated in 0.5 ml of Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaC1, 10 mm MgC12, 1 mm KC1, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 1 h and then mixed with 30 μl of anti-Flag M2 antibody-agarose beads in the absence or presence of 0.1 mg/ml Flag peptide. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with 0.3 ml of Buffer B, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-Mcm10p. In Mcm10p immunoprecipitation experiments, 2.5 μl of Mcm10p polyclonal antibodies or pre-immune serum were added to an incubated mixture of Mcm10p and pol α-primase. After 1 h at 4 °C, 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads were added, and proteins bound were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Flag. In vitro transcription/translation-immunoprecipitation experiments with Mcm10p derivatives were performed (see Fig. 5C). Radiolabeled, in vitro translated full-length and truncated derivatives of Mcm10p were incubated with 2 pmol of purified pol α-primase complex in an immunoprecipitation experiment as described above, except that the omission of pol α-primase was used as a negative control. After incubation and washing, Laemmli loading dye was added and the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and quantitated with a Fuji imager. Nitrocellulose Filter Binding Assays—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing either 40 fmol of either 5′-32P-labeled 89-mer, single-stranded (ss) DNA (1000 cpm/fmol) or 5′-32P-labeled 89-mer, double-stranded (ds) DNA, 1000 cpm/fmol), 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm KCl, 50 mm sodium glutamate, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl and 800 μm dATP were incubated with the indicated levels of RPA, or Mcm10p, or Mcm10p truncated derivative, at 37 °C for 30 min. Reaction mixtures were filtered through alkaline-washed nitrocellulose membrane, washed three times with 0.5 ml of 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm magnesium acetate, and bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. DNA Replication Assays—DNA polymerase activity was measured using three different DNA templates: hairpin A, hairpin C, and the primed 89-mer TG40 repeat. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 75 mm KCl, 50 mm sodium glutamate, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 20 μm dNTPs required to support DNA synthesis (i.e. with hairpin A, dATP and [α-32P]dTTP; with hairpin C, dATP and [α-32P]dGTP; with the TG40 repeat, dCTP and [α-32P]dATP), 10 pmol of substrate (unless otherwise specified), and the indicated amounts of enzyme in the presence or absence of Mcm10p as specified. After incubation for 60 min at 37 °C, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was spotted on DE-81 paper, washed three times with 0.5 m sodium phosphate, and nucleotide incorporation measured. The remaining reaction mixture was treated with 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, then extracted with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and subjected to 10% denaturing PAGE analysis. DNA Primer Templates—The 94-mer hairpin C (5′-(C)36 TTT CCC TGT GCC CTT CGT ATA CGA TGG GTT TTT CCC ATC GTA TAC GAA GGG CAC AGG G-3′), the 94-mer hairpin A (5′-(A)36 TTT CCC TGT GCC CTT CGT ATA CGA TGG GTT TTT CCC ATC GTA TAC GAA GGG CAC AGG G-3′), the 89-mer TG40-repeat (5′-(TG)19 TTGG TTG GCC GAT CAA GTG CCC AGT CAC GAC GTT GTA AAA CGA GCC CGA GT-3′), and the 50-mer primer (5′-CAC TCG GGC TCG TTT TAC AAC GTC GTG ACT GGG CAC TTG ATC GGC CAA CC-3′) were synthesized by International Technology (IDT), and purified by denaturing 6% SDS-PAGE. To anneal the 50-mer primer to the 89-mer TG40-repeat template DNA, the two oligomers were mixed in a 2:1 (primer:template) molar ratio in 0.1 m NaC1, 10 mm Tris-HC1, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and slowly cooled to 37 °C. Isolation of a Mcm10p and pol α-Primase Complex on Primed DNA— The protein-DNA complex containing the pol α-primase and Mcm10p was isolated by affinity capture on an immobilized DNA template containing a 5′-biotin group, which is bound to streptavidin-agarose beads. To form the immobilized complex, a DNA replication reaction mixture (20-μl reaction volume) containing Buffer F (50 mm Hepes-KOH buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 75 mm KCl, 50 mm sodium glutamate, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% Nonidet P-40), 5 pmol of 5′-biotinylated hairpin C DNA template, 100 μm dATP, varying levels of pol α-primase (indicated) in the presence or absence of 2 pmol of Mcm10p was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with occasional agitation. Streptavidin-agarose (Pierce) beads (10 μl) were added, and the mixture was rotated at room temperature for 20 min. The mixture was then chilled on ice, and the beads washed three times with 400 μl of ice-cold wash buffer (40 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 20% glycerol, and 0.02% Nonidet P-40). The washed beads were resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample, the beads were boiled, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Reconstitution and Characterization of Baculovirus S. pombe pol α-Primase—S. pombe pol α-primase subunits comprise p180, β, Spp2, and Spp1, homologues of the human pol α-primase p180, p70, p58, and p48 subunits, respectively. In conformity with the terminology used for the human proteins, we will refer to the S. pombe subunits of the pol α-primase as p180, p70, p58, and p48. The apparent molecular masses of S. pombe p180, p70, p58, and p48 subunits in SDS-PAGE are ∼180, 70, 53, and 56 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1, lanes 1–4). Four recombinant baculoviruses, each encoding a specific subunit of pol α-primase, were constructed and used to infect Sf9 cells. Both untagged and C-terminal His-Flag-tagged derivatives of the p70, p58, and p48 subunits expressed well in Sf9 cells, whereas expression of the full-length p180 subunit was low possibly as a result of protease degradation. Coexpression of the p180 and p70 subunits, however, increased the recovery of the full-length p180 subunit (data not shown). Combinations of untagged and tagged subunits were tested to determine the optimal combinations for the isolation of the four-subunit and other subcomplexes. Proteins were purified by either consecutive binding to Ni-NTA resin followed by anti-Flag monoclonal antibody binding and elution, or, as in the case of the four-subunit enzyme, Ni-NTA binding followed by glycerol gradient sedimentation. These procedures resulted in the isolation of highly purified individual subunits (Fig. 1, lanes 1–4), the p180-His-Flag/p70 complex (Fig. 1, lane 5), the p58-His-Flag/p48 (Fig. 1, lane 6) subunit complex, and the holoenzyme complex (Fig. 1, lane 7). The purified cloned pol α-primase complex contained polymerase activity (7.0 μmol of deoxynucleotide incorporated in 30 min/mg of protein) and primase activities (13 μmol of deoxynucleotide incorporated in 30 min/mg of protein, as performed by Schneider et al.) (10Schneider A. Smith R.W.P. Kautz A.R. Weisshart K. Grosse F. Nasheuer H.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21608-21615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), comparable with those of the pol α-primase complex isolated from extracts of S. pombe cells (data not shown). His-tagged spMcm10p (called Cdc23p in S. pombe) was cloned and expressed in E. coli and purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” The purified material was more than 90% pure as shown in Fig. 1 (lane 8). Mcm10p Interacts with the pol α-Primase—The binding of Mcm10p to chromatin and its association with a number of proteins involved in the initiation and elongation of DNA replication prompted us to examine its interactions with purified pol α-primase complex using co-immunoprecipitation procedures (Fig. 2). The four-subunit pol α-primase associated with the Mcm10p (Fig. 2A). When individual Flag-tagged subunits of the pol α-primase were examined, strong interaction was noted only with the p180 subunit (Fig. 2B, lanes 2–5). These experiments were carried out by immunoprecipitation with Flag antibodies followed by Western blotting with anti-Mcm10p. The interaction between Mcm10p and p180 was also observed in reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments using Mcm10p polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 2C), whereas interaction with p70 was not observed. Mcm10p Stimulates pol α Activity—We next examined whether the Mcm10p-p180 interaction influenced the enzymatic activities associated with pol α-primase. The template used in the replication reaction (Fig. 3A) was a hairpin molecule containing a 25-bp duplex region and a single-stranded 5′ tail of 3 dTMPs followed by 36 dCMP residues (hairpin C). Reactions with this template were carried out in the presence of dATP and [α-32P]dGTP. In the absence of dATP, dGMP incorporation was not detected (data not shown). We found that the addition of Mcm10p increased the polymerase activity 3–5-fold. The stimulation of the polymerase activity by Mcm10p was maximized by lowering the pH of the reaction (from 7.4 to 7.0) and by adding potassium chloride, sodium glutamate, and Nonidet P-40. Under these conditions, the activity of pol α was reduced 5-fold without affecting the polymerase activity observed in the presence of Mcm10p. Using these conditions, the influence of a fixed concentration of Mcm10p on the rate of DNA synthesis by varying levels of the pol α-primase complex was examined (Fig. 3A). As shown, Mcm10p stimulated DNA synthesis and this effect was most dramatic at low concentrations of pol α-primase. Reactions containing 40 or 200 fmol of pol α-primase were stimulated 25- and 4-fold by Mcm10p, respectively. Marked stimulation of the polymerase activity by Mcm10p was also observed with all DNA templates described under “Materials and Methods.” The level of Mcm10p required to activate the pol α activity was examined in replication assays carried out in the presence of a constant amount of pol α-primase and varying levels of Mcm10p (Fig. 3B). Reaction mixtures contained 10 pmol of the primed 89-mer TG40 repeat template and 10 fmol of the pol α-primase, conditions that supported DNA synthesis poorly in the absence of Mcm10p (Fig. 3A). Maximal stimulation was observed with ∼1 pmol (50 nm) Mcm10p, and 1/2 Vmax was detected at 10 nm Mcm10p. These results indicate that the level of Mcm10p required to stimulate the polymerase activity maximally was ∼50–100 times higher than the level of pol α-primase added. On the other hand, maximal activation by Mcm10p occurred at a molar level conside"
https://openalex.org/W2160513919,"Sarcosine oxidase (SOX) is known as a peroxisomal enzyme in mammals and as a sarcosine-inducible enzyme in soil bacteria. Its presence in plants was unsuspected until the Arabidopsis genome was found to encode a protein (AtSOX) with ∼33% sequence identity to mammalian and bacterial SOXs. When overexpressed in Escherichia coli, AtSOX enhanced growth on sarcosine as sole nitrogen source, showing that it has SOX activity in vivo, and the recombinant protein catalyzed the oxidation of sarcosine to glycine, formaldehyde, and H2 O2 in vitro. AtSOX also attacked other N-methyl amino acids and, like mammalian SOXs, catalyzed the oxidation of l-pipecolate to Δ1-piperideine-6-carboxylate. Like bacterial monomeric SOXs, AtSOX was active as a monomer, contained FAD covalently bound to a cysteine residue near the C terminus, and was not stimulated by tetrahydrofolate. Although AtSOX lacks a typical peroxisome-targeting signal, in vitro assays established that it is imported into peroxisomes. Quantitation of mRNA showed that AtSOX is expressed at a low level throughout the plant and is not sarcosine-inducible. Consistent with a low level of AtSOX expression, Arabidopsis plantlets slowly metabolized supplied [14C]sarcosine to glycine and serine. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed low levels of pipecolate but almost no sarcosine in wild type Arabidopsis and showed that pipecolate but not sarcosine accumulated 6-fold when AtSOX expression was suppressed by RNA interference. Moreover, the pipecolate catabolite α-aminoadipate decreased 30-fold in RNA interference plants. These data indicate that pipecolate is the endogenous substrate for SOX in plants and that plants can utilize exogenous sarcosine opportunistically, sarcosine being a common soil metabolite.

These data indicate that pipecolate is the endogenous substrate for SOX in plants and that plants can utilize exogenous sarcosine opportunistically, sarcosine being a common soil metabolite. Sarcosine (N-methylglycine) is a key metabolite of the mammalian liver, where it is formed from glycine by the action of glycine N-methyltransferase or from the oxidation of glycine betaine (1Balaghi M.

Sarcosine is also a common soil metabolite of creatinine, which animals excrete in urine, and various soil bacteria can utilize sarcosine as a nitrogen and carbon source (3Kvalnes-Krick K. Jorns M.S.

CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 425-435Google Scholar). Bacterial and mammalian SOXs belong to a recently recognized family of enzymes that catalyze oxidative reactions with secondary or tertiary amino acids and contain covalently bound flavin (5Reuber B.E.

Structure. 1999; 7: 331-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The archetypal family members are the monomeric SOXs (MSOXs) of bacteria such as Bacillus sp. MSOXs are active as monomers, have a molecular mass of ∼44 kDa, an N-terminal ADP-binding motif, and contain FAD bound to a conserved cysteine residue (7Trickey P. Wagner M.A. Jorns M.S. Mathews F.S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8825-8829Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mammalian SOXs are closely related to MSOXs and are alternatively named pipecolate oxidases (PIPOXs) because l-pipecolate is also a good substrate (5Reuber B.E. Karl C. Reimann S.A. Mihalik S.J. Dodt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6766-6776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mammalian SOX/PIPOXs have C-terminal tripeptide peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1) motifs and are located in peroxisomes (5Reuber B.E. Karl C. Reimann S.A. Mihalik S.J. Dodt G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5588-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the NikD enzyme of Streptomyces tendae (10Venci D. Zhao G. Jorns M.S.

More distant family members are heterotetrameric bacterial SOXs, and mammalian sarcosine and dimethylglycine dehydrogenases (7Trickey P. Wagner M.A. Jorns M.S. Mathews F.S. Structure. 1999; 7: 331-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). There seems to be little evidence that sarcosine is a natural plant product (12Hunt S. Barrett G.C. Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Amino Acids. Chapman and Hall, London1985: 55-138Crossref Google Scholar) and none at all that plants have pathways leading to sarcosine from glycine, glycine betaine, or creatinine (13Rontein D. Basset G.

Transgenic Res. 2002; 11: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It was therefore initially surprising to find that Arabidopsis has a gene (At2g24580) encoding a close homolog of bacterial MSOXs and mammalian SOX/PIPOXs and that other plants have similar genes (15Hanson A.D. Gage D.A. Shachar-Hill Y. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 206-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Hanson A.D. Roje S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 119-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). However, consistent with there being sarcosine-oxidizing activity in plants, sarcosine application induced expression of formate dehydrogenase in potato leaves (17Hourton-Cabassa C. Ambard-Bretteville F. Moreau F. Davy de Virville J. Rémy R. Francs-Small C.C. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). As this enzyme is induced in plants by formaldehyde or formate (17Hourton-Cabassa C. Ambard-Bretteville F. Moreau F. Davy de Virville J. Rémy R. Francs-Small C.C.

Bot. 2001; 79: 796-804Google Scholar), its induction by sarcosine could be explained by the release of formaldehyde. Moreover, pipecolate is a catabolite of lysine in plants (20Galili G. Tang G. Zhu X. Gakière B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and occurs widely (12Hunt S. Barrett G.C. Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Amino Acids. Chapman and Hall, London1985: 55-138Crossref Google Scholar) so that, like mammals, plants might be expected to have PIPOX activity. To assign a function to the Arabidopsis SOX homolog, we first used a functional assay in E. coli to demonstrate that it has SOX activity in vivo and showed that the recombinant protein has SOX and PIPOX activity. We then characterized the enzyme further, showed that it is imported into peroxisomes, and confirmed that Arabidopsis can oxidize sarcosine in vivo. Lastly, we analyzed levels of sarcosine and pipecolate in plants with suppressed SOX expression and wild type controls. Chemicals and Reagents—[N-methyl-14C]Sarcosine (55 mCi/mmol) and [carboxyl-14C]sarcosine (50 mCi/mmol) were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO), [14C]formaldehyde (54 mCi/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and Redivue™ [35S]methionine (1180 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences. Specific radioactivities were adjusted as needed with unlabeled compound. (6R, 6S)-Tetrahydrofolate was from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). Other biochemicals were from Sigma. Ion exchange resins were from Bio-Rad. PeroXOquant peroxide assay kits were from Pierce. Cellulose TLC plates (0.1-mm layer thickness) were from Merck. Plants and Growth Conditions—Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia) plants were grown at 23 °C in 12-h days (photosynthetic photon flux density of 80 microeinstein m–2 s–1) in potting soil irrigated with water; and when roots were required, plants were grown in hydroponic culture as described (21Gibeaut D.M. Hulett J. Cramer G.R. Seemann J.R. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Pumpkin seeds (Cucurbita pepo, cv. Connecticut Fields) were purchased from Siegers Seed Co. (Zeeland, MI). Pumpkin seedlings were grown in moist vermiculite for 6 days in the dark at 25–28 °C. cDNA Isolation and Expression in E. coli—Expressed sequence tag (EST) GenBank™ accession number T41826 encoding AtSOX was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Columbus, OH), sequenced, and cloned into pET-43.1a (Novagen) as follows. Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used to amplify the cDNA using the primers 5′-ATATACATATGGAATATTCCGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TATATCTCGAGTTAATGTTTCAATGG-3′ (reverse). The resulting amplicon was digested with NdeI and XhoI and cloned between the same sites of pET-43.1a. This construct (pET43-SOX) was electroporated into E. coli DH10B cells, verified by sequencing, and electroporated into E. coli Rosetta™ (DE3) cells (Novagen). For enzyme production, cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol until A600 reached 0.6. Isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added (final concentration 100 μm), and incubation continued for 18 h at 25 °C. RNA Interference (RNAi) Experiments—A 475-bp AtSOX cDNA fragment was amplified using the primers 5′-CACCATTCGACGTGATTGTCGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCAATCGCAAGCGTCTG-3′ (reverse), and the amplicon was cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO® vector using the pENTR™ Directional TOPO® Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The SOX sequence was then transferred into the pHELLSGATE8 vector (22Wesley S.V. Helliwell C.A. Smith N.A. Wang M.B. Rouse D.T. Liu Q. Gooding P.S. Singh S.P. Abbott D. Stoutjesdijk P.A. Robinson S.P. Gleave A.P. Green A.G. Waterhouse P.M. Plant J. 2001; 27: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar) using the LR Clonase™ recombination method (Invitrogen). The sequence-verified pHELLS-GATE-SOX construct was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain ABI. Arabidopsis plants (ecotype Columbia) were transformed by the vacuum infiltration method (23Bechtold N. Ellis J. Pelletier G. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1993; 316: 1194-1199Google Scholar). Kanamycin-resistant T2 plants were used for real time quantitative RT-PCR analyses and amino acid analyses. Utilization of Sarcosine as Nitrogen Source by E. coli Overexpressing AtSOX—Cells were plated on M9 minimal medium (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) minus NH4Cl, containing trace elements (25Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 0.4% glucose, 1.5% agar, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 100 μm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and 17.5 mm sarcosine or 2.2 mm glycine as the nitrogen source (filter-sterilized, added after autoclaving). Growth was at 25 °C. Enzyme Assays—Oxidase assays were carried out at 30 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, in 20-μl reaction mixtures in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Product formation was linear with time and enzyme level. Tests with various assay volumes and with O2 instead of air as headspace gas indicated that O2 diffusion did not significantly limit the reaction rate. For routine assays, substrates were unlabeled, H2O2 formation was estimated colorimetrically with the PeroXOquant kit, and incubation time was 60 min. Km and kc values were estimated by curve-fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation using non-linear regression; the enzyme was taken to be 90% pure. Km and kc data are the means of three determinations, and S.E. values were <5% of the means. To determine stoichiometry, formaldehyde and glycine formation were quantified radiochemically, respectively using [N-methyl-14C]sarcosine or [carboxyl-14C]sarcosine (55 nCi/assay, plus unlabeled sarcosine to give a total concentration of 10 mm). The [14C]formaldehyde assay was also used during protein purification. To determine [14C]formaldehyde, a 10-μl portion of the reaction mixture was stopped by adding 75 μl of 1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 5 μl of 1 m formaldehyde, and 75 μl of 400 mm dimedone in 50% ethanol and boiled for 5 min. The 14C product was extracted into 1 ml of toluene, and an 0.8-ml aliquot was taken for scintillation counting. Data were corrected for recovery of [14C]formaldehyde spikes. To determine [14C]glycine, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was mixed with an equal volume of acetone to stop the reaction, and subjected to thin layer electrophoresis at 4 °C for 20 min at 1.8 kV in 1.5 m formic acid. [14C]Glycine zones were located by autoradiography, scraped from the plate, and quantified by scintillation counting. Data were corrected for recovery. Protein Purification and Molecular Mass Determination—Operations were at 0–4 °C. Rosetta™ cells from a 1-liter culture were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 11 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (buffer A), and broken in a Mini-BeadBeater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK) using 0.1-mm zirconia/silica beads. After centrifugation (20,000 × g, 30 min), the supernatant was subjected to 30–50% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4 fractionation; after centrifugation (20,000 × g, 30 min) the pellet was dissolved in 2.6 ml of buffer A and desalted on two in-series PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A. Subsequent steps used a Waters 626 high pressure liquid chromatography system. Proteins were loaded on a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) that was washed with buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–0.5 m NaCl (0.2 ml min–1, total volume 7.5 ml). Fractions with SOX activity were pooled, concentrated in a Centricon YM-30 unit (Millipore, Billerica, MA), loaded on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A plus 0.15 m NaCl, and eluted with the same buffer. SOX fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, desalted on a 1-ml Sephadex G-25 spin column equilibrated in buffer A plus 10% glycerol, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C. This preparation had no catalase activity, as judged by the 100% recovery of H2O2 spikes added to SOX assays. Native molecular mass was estimated using the Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column and thyroglobulin, apoferritin, β-amylase, bovine serum albumin, and carbonic anhydrase as standards. SDS-polyacrylamide gels contained 12.5% polyacrylamide and were stained with Coomassie Blue. Protein was estimated by Bradford's method (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Proteolysis and Mass Spectrometry—Purified AtSOX (75 μg, in 100 μl of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10% glycerol) was mixed with 400 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.7, and 30 μmol of dithiothreitol and heated at 55 °C for 10 min. Iodoacetamide (20 mg) was then added followed by incubation in darkness at 23 °C for 30 min. The reduced and alkylated protein was precipitated at –20 °C for 18 h with 10 volumes of 10% trichloroacetic acid in acetone containing 0.075% SDS, harvested by centrifugation, washed in cold acetone, and air-dried. The precipitate was dissolved in 200 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, and digested with 1 μg of sequencing grade endoproteinase Asp-N (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 18 h. Mass spectrometry was carried out in the Protein Chemistry Core Facility at the University of Florida. MALDI-TOF MS analyses used a Voyager DE-Pro instrument (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Undigested SOX samples were mixed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, adsorbed to a C4 Zip-Tip microcolumn (Millipore), and eluted with 60% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 10 mg/ml sinapinic acid. The eluate was spotted onto the sample plate and analyzed in the linear mode. Asp-N peptides were treated similarly except that a C18 Zip-Tip was used, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid replaced sinapinic acid, and the operation was in the reflectron mode. For peptide analysis, the data evaluated were monoisotopic peaks; mass accuracy was <10 ppm. Precursor and product ion scanning were performed on a Q-Star instrument (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a nanoflow electrospray device and operated in negative ion mode (27Newton-Vinson P. Hubalek F. Edmondson D.E. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 334-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Identification of Δ1-Piperideine-6-carboxylate—Purified AtSOX was added to 10 mml-pipecolate solutions, and the reaction was followed in situ by 1H NMR. Spectra (128–1024 transients) were acquired at 500 MHz on a UnityPlus instrument (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) using 90° pulses and a recycle time of 5 s that included the presaturation of the water resonance for 1.9 s. For comparison to Δ1-piperideine-2-carboxylate, spectra of the product of lysine oxidase acting on lysine were acquired. Sarcosine Metabolism by Arabidopsis—A 15-day-old plant was washed free of soil, and the lower two-thirds of its root system was severed under water. The plant (0.2 g of fresh weight) was placed with the cut roots in a microcentrifuge tube containing 1.74 μCi (35 nmol) of [carboxyl-14C]sarcosine in 20 μl of water. After incubation for 6 h in the light, adding water to the tube to replace evapotranspiration losses, unabsorbed 14C was quantified, and the plant was ground in liquid N2 and extracted by gentle agitation in 0.8 ml of 30 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, for 20 min at 0 °C. After centrifuging to clear, the extract was mixed with 4 volumes of acetone and recentrifuged. The supernatant was mixed with 8 ml of water and applied to a 1-ml column of AG 50 (H+) resin. Amino acids were eluted with 5 ml of 2.5 n HCl, lyophilized, and analyzed by thin layer electrophoresis as above. The pellet was washed with 80% acetone, dried, redissolved in 0.75 ml of 6 n HCl, and heated at 110 °C for 12 h. After lyophilizing, the hydrolysate was dissolved in water and analyzed by thin layer electrophoresis. Amino acid zones were located autoradiographically and by reference to standards, and their 14C contents were determined by scintillation counting. [14C]Glycine and [14C]serine data were corrected for label present in these zones in a control sample spiked with [carboxyl-14C]sarcosine before extraction. Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from three samples of each tissue using RNeasy kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and treated with DNase (DNA-free™ kit, Ambion, Austin, TX). Real time quantitative RT-PCR was performed on 250 ng of RNA in 25-μl reactions using TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR master mix reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and an Applied Biosystems Gene-Amp 5700 sequence-detection system. The primers and probe (designed with Applied Biosystems Primer Express software) were as follows: forward primer 5′-GGATGGTTGATTCCGAAGGA-3′; reverse primer 5′-TCGTCCGGTGTCATCGAATA-3′; probe 5′-CCGTGGCGACTCAGCTTTGT-3′. The fluorescent reporter dye 6-carboxyfluorescein and the quencher dye 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine were bonded to the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The amplicon was 64 bp long. RT-PCR conditions were as follows: 48 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The standard was sense-strand RNA, prepared as described (28Rontein D. Wu W.I. Voelker D.R. Hanson A.D. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1678-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The template for in vitro transcription was PCR-amplified AtSOX cDNA, and the primers were 5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGAACAAAAGCTGGCTACGGTGTGTTATTGGAGA-3′ (forward, the T3 promoter sequence is underlined) and 5′-AAAAAAATCACGAAATCCTCGTCC-3′ (reverse). Samples and standards were run in duplicate. A CT threshold value was determined from amplification curves by selecting an optimal ΔRn (emission of the reporter dye over starting background fluorescence) in the exponential part of the plots. Preparation of Radiolabeled Proteins for Import into Peroxisomes— Plasmid pMV2 containing a full-length spinach glycolate oxidase cDNA was provided by C. R. Somerville (Carnegie Institution, Stanford, CA). pMV2 was linearized with HindIII and pET43-SOX with XhoI. The linearized DNAs were transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). Radiolabeled glycolate oxidase and AtSOX were synthesized in a cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. The efficiency of translation was assessed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation onto glass fiber filters followed by ethanol washes and liquid scintillation counting (29Brickner D.G. Harada J.J. Olsen L.J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Isolation of Pumpkin Glyoxysomes—Glyoxysomes were isolated from pumpkin cotyledons as described previously (29Brickner D.G. Harada J.J. Olsen L.J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The glyoxysomal pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer (Hepes-KOH, pH 6.0, 0.3 m mannitol) to a final concentration of 35 mg/ml total protein. Import Reactions—In vitro protein import reactions (final volume 200 μl) were initiated by adding 35S-labeled glycolate oxidase or AtSOX (5 × 105 cpm trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein) to 350 μg of glyoxysomes in the presence of import buffer (25 mm Mes-KOH, pH 6.0, 0.5 m sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5mm MgATP). The reaction temperature was 26 °C unless otherwise noted. Import reactions were incubated for 30 min and then the glyoxysomes were treated with thermolysin (25 μg/ml in 0.5 mm CaCl2) to remove non-imported proteins. Protease treatment was for 30 min on ice; reactions were stopped by adding EDTA (10 mm final concentration) to inhibit the thermolysin. The protease-treated glyoxysomes were then repurified on a sucrose cushion, solubilized in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described (29Brickner D.G. Harada J.J. Olsen L.J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Note that only proteins protected by an intact glyoxysomal membrane would be protease-resistant. Lysed or compromised organelles would not be recovered from the sucrose cushion. Where indicated, samples were treated with Triton X-100 (1% v/v final concentration) to lyse the organelles following import and protease treatment as described (29Brickner D.G. Harada J.J. Olsen L.J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Amino Acid Analysis—Samples (0.4–1.2 g fresh weight, 10–30 plants) were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –20 °C. Extraction was for 48 h at 4 °C with 10 ml of methanol containing 250 nmol of 3,4-dehydro-dl-proline as an internal standard, followed by phase separation by adding CHCl3 (5 ml) and water (6 ml); the aqueous phase was dried in an air stream, redissolved in 1 ml of water, and applied to 1 × 4.5-cm columns of AG 50 (H+). After washing columns with 8 ml of water, amino acids were eluted with 6 ml of 6 m NH4OH and dried. Amino acids were then derivatized with 200 μl of isobutyl alcohol:acetyl chloride (5:1 v/v) (120 °C, 20 min), dried, then derivatized with 100 μlof heptafluorobutyric anhydride (120 °C, 10 min). Samples were brought to near dryness and redissolved in 100 μl of ethyl acetate:acetic anhydride 1:1 (v/v), of which 1-μl aliquots were analyzed by GC and electron ionization GC-MS, essentially as described (30Rhodes D. Handa S. Bressan R.A. Plant Physiol. 1986; 82: 890-903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Response factors were determined using an amino acid standard mixture (Sigma) supplemented with 250 nmol of 3,4-dehydro-dl-proline, sarcosine, α-amino-n-butyrate, or dl-pipecolic acid. Tests showed that sarcosine and pipecolic acid added to Arabidopsis extracts were recovered quantitatively after processing as described above. Characterization of a SOX cDNA from Arabidopsis— Searches of GenBank™ revealed a single intronless Arabidopsis gene (At2g24580) encoding a putative SOX protein and five cognate Arabidopsis ESTs. Sequencing of a full-length EST confirmed that it specifies a protein (AtSOX) with ∼33% overall sequence identity to mammalian SOX/PIPOX and Bacillus MSOX (Fig. 1). The AtSOX sequence has the features characteristic of the MSOX family (5Reuber B.E. Karl C. Reimann S.A. Mihalik S.J. Dodt G. J. Biol.

Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar) near the N terminus and a conserved cysteine residue (Cys325) in the C-terminal region that, in MSOX, is the covalent attachment site of FAD (8Wagner M.A. Khanna P. Jorns M.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5588-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). There is also a conserved histidine near the N terminus (His50) that aligns with the covalent attachment site of FAD in sarcosine and dimethylglycine dehydrogenases (8Wagner M.A. Khanna P. Jorns M.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5588-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Mewies M. McIntire W.S. Scrutton N.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, a difference from mammalian SOX/PIPOX is that the C-terminal tripeptide, LKH, is not a classical PTS1 signal (5Reuber B.E. K"
https://openalex.org/W1992292411,"The role of individual integrins in human β-cell development and function is largely unknown. This study describes the contribution of αv-integrins to human β-cell adhesion, spreading, and motility. Developmental differences in αv-integrin utilization are addressed by comparing the responses of adult and fetal β-cells, and vitronectin is used as a substrate based on its unique pattern of expression in the developing pancreas. Fetal and adult β-cells attached equally to vitronectin and integrin αvβ5 was found to support the adhesion of both mature and immature β-cell populations. Fetal β-cells were also observed to spread and migrate on vitronectin, and integrin αvβ1 was found to be essential for these responses. In contrast to their fetal counterparts, adult β-cells failed to either spread or migrate and this deficit was associated with a marked down-regulation of αvβ1 expression in adult islet preparations. The integrin αvβ3 was not found to support significant β-cell attachment or migration. Based on our findings, we conclude that integrins αvβ5 and αvβ1 are important mediators of human β-cell adhesion and motility, respectively. By supporting fetal β-cell migration, αvβ1 could play an important role in early motile processes required for islet neogenesis.

Integrins are a family of heterodimeric transmembrane adhesion molecules comprised of non-covalently associated α- and β-subunits. By external ligand recognition and concomitant recruitment of cytoskeletal and signaling elements these recognition molecules serve to integrate the interior machinery of a cell with the extracellular environment (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1987; 48: 549-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3111) Google Scholar). Integrins have been implicated in a plethora of processes required for normal development including cell survival, proliferation, cytodifferentiation, migration, and spatial segregation (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1987; 48: 549-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3111) Google Scholar, 2Giancotti F.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 691-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 3Lin C.Q.

The αv-integrin subfamily currently contains five members (αvβ3, αvβ5, αvβ1, αvβ6, and αvβ8), which all recognize components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; PEC, pancreatic epithelial cells; VN, vitronectin; pAb, polyclonal antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; ICC, islet-like cell cluster; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. via the linear tripeptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). Despite recognizing a common epitope there are marked differences in ligand binding specificity of these αv-integrins (7van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). The different αv-integrins also have unique spatial and temporal patterns of cell and tissue expression during organogenesis implying different and potentially important roles in development (8Yamada S. Brown K.E. Yamada K.M. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1995; 3: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus far either animal or in vitro studies have indicated a role for αv-integrins in embryo implantation (9Bader B.L. Rayburn H. Crowley D. Hynes R.O.

Among the various ECM components recognized by αv-integrins, vitronectin (VN) has the distinction of being recognized by all five of the known αv-subfamily members (15Schvartz I. Seger D. Shaltiel S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Following ECM sequestration, VN can regulate a variety of cellular processes including migration, differentiation, proliferation, and morphogenesis (15Schvartz I. Seger D. Shaltiel S. Int. J.

Histopathol. 1997; 12: 787-797PubMed Google Scholar) Importantly, VN expression has recently been confirmed in the developing human pancreas in association with both epithelial cells and insulin-expressing cells emerging from the ductal epithelium (17Cirulli V. Beattie G.M. Klier G. Ellisman M. Ricordi C. Quaranta V. Frasier F. Ishii J.K. Hayek A. Salomon D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1445-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Based on this highly restricted distribution it is suggested that endocrine progenitors may arise from a larger pool of VN-producing cells (17Cirulli V. Beattie G.M. Klier G. Ellisman M. Ricordi C. Quaranta V. Frasier F. Ishii J.K. Hayek A. Salomon D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1445-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). An important inference of this study is that local VN biosynthesis and deposition could instigate or otherwise modulate critical migratory or morphogenic events required for islet neogenesis. Studies assessing the impact of matrix interactions on β-cell development and function are limited in number but provide important evidence that the matrix can influence many aspects of β-cell biology including survival (18Wang R.N.

Interaction with ECM has been shown to be important for the long term ex vivo survival of β-cells (18Wang R.N. Rosenberg L. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 163: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and collagen, matrigel, and fibrin gels have been shown to provide a compliant matrix environment suitable for maintaining islet viablity and function (25Lucas-Clerc C.

Complex laminin-rich matrices have also been shown to facilitate islet formation (28Bonner-Weir S. Taneja M. Weir G.C. Tatarkiewicz K. Song K.H. Sharma A. O'Neil J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7999-8004Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), to promote the proliferation of human β-cells in response to hepatocyte growth factor (20Beattie G.M. Cirulli V. Lopez A.D. Hayek A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 1852-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and to amplify insulin secretion in response to secretagogues (24Bosco D. Meda P. Halban P.A. Rouiller D.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). As a purified ligand, laminin has been shown to promote the differentiation of fetal mouse pancreatic β-cells (22Jiang F.X. Cram D.S. DeAizpurua H.J. Harrison L.C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 722-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 23Jiang F.X. Georges-Labouesse E. Harrison L.C. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 107-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In most cases the requisite integrins involved in these responses remains to be determined. The contribution of αv-integrins to β-cell development and function has not been assessed. However, αvβ3 and αvβ5 expression has been described in the developing human pancreas both on ductal epithelium and in immature islets, and both of these integrins are proposed to support pancreatic epithelial cells (PEC) adhesion (17Cirulli V. Beattie G.M. Klier G. Ellisman M. Ricordi C. Quaranta V. Frasier F. Ishii J.K. Hayek A. Salomon D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1445-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Importantly, a cyclic RGD peptide, which can disrupt αv-integrin ligation, has also been shown to prevent normal islet development in vivo (17Cirulli V. Beattie G.M. Klier G. Ellisman M. Ricordi C. Quaranta V. Frasier F. Ishii J.K. Hayek A. Salomon D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1445-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In this study we assess, for the first time, the impact of αv-integrin expression and utilization on human β-cell adhesion, spreading, and migration. VN is used as the primary substrate based on its ability to support interactions with multiple αv-integrins and its unique pattern of expression in the developing pancreas (15Schvartz I. Seger D. Shaltiel S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 17Cirulli V. Beattie G.M. Klier G. Ellisman M. Ricordi C. Quaranta V. Frasier F. Ishii J.K. Hayek A. Salomon D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1445-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Our studies identify those αv-integrin heterodimers required for β-cell adhesion, spreading, and migration and contrast the αv-integrin mediated responses of both adult and fetal β-cells. These studies highlight significant developmental differences in αv-integrin-mediated motility between fetal and adult β-cells and indicate a potentially important role for αvβ1 in motile processes required for early islet neogenesis. Reagents—Function-blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to human αvβ3 (LM609), αvβ5 (PIF6), and the β1-subunit (P4C10) were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). A blocking mAb to the human αv-subunit (L1A3) was kindly provided by Dr A. Strongin (Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). An anti-αv polyclonal antibody (pAb; VNR) with potent function-blocking activity to αv-integrins (29Silletti S. Mei F. Sheppard D. Montgomery A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1485-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) was generated at the Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, CA). mAbs used for Western blotting including anti-human αv (LM142), β1 (LM534), and β3 (AP3) were purchased from Chemicon. A mAb to human insulin (2D11-H5) was acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and a sheep pAb (PC059) to insulin was from The Binding Site Inc. (San Diego, CA). Secondary donkey anti-sheep and anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphotase or fluorescein were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Purified human VN was from Chemicon. Tissue Procurement, Processing, and Cell Culture—Institutional approval was obtained for the use of fetal and adult human pancreata. Human adult cadaveric pancreata (ages 37-65 years) were obtained via the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Human Islet Distribution Program and human fetal pancreata (19-21 weeks gestational age) were provided by Advanced BioResources (Alameda, CA). Fetal pancreata were digested with a collagenase solution (Collagenase-P; 2.5 mg/ml) as described previously (20Beattie G.M. Cirulli V. Lopez A.D. Hayek A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 1852-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Resulting cell clusters were re-suspended in RPMI 1640 containing 10% normal human serum and were incubated overnight to allow the formation of islet-like cell clusters (ICCs) (20Beattie G.M. Cirulli V. Lopez A.D. Hayek A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 1852-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These ICCs typically contained 75-85% epithelial cells and 2-4% insulin-reactive cells (30Beattie G.M. Levine F. Mally M.I. Otonkoski T. O'Brien J.S. Salomon D.R. Hayek A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 78: 1232-1240PubMed Google Scholar). ICCs derived from individual pancreases (∼100-200) were then seeded into Petri dishes coated with a HTB-9 matrix and were then grown as monolayers in the presence of RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 10 ng/ml of hepatocyte growth factor (Genentech, San Francisco, CA) as described previously (20Beattie G.M. Cirulli V. Lopez A.D. Hayek A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 1852-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cells were expanded for 3 days prior to use and were confirmed to contain 85-90% PEC and 1-2% insulin-positive β-cells. Adult islet preparations were isolated in-house using a modified semiautomated method essentially as described previously (31Ricordi C. Lacy P.E. Finke E.H. Olack B.J. Scharp D.W. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 413-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Islet clusters were subsequently expanded on HTB-9 matrix for 3-5 days prior to use as described for fetal ICC preparations. Expanded adult islet preparations typically contained 30-40% insulin-positive β-cells and 50-60% epithelial cells. Immunofluorescence and Morphological Analysis—The morphology and actin organization of adherent β-cells was assessed by double staining for insulin and F-actin. Adult and fetal pancreatic cell monolayers grown on HTB-9 matrix were harvested with a 0.025% trypsin/Versene solution (Versene 1:5000; Invitrogen), and single cell populations were added to glass chamber slides (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) previously coated with VN (5 μg/ml for 4 h at 37 °C). After 90 min, adherent cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 10 min. After blocking (2% donkey serum and 1% BSA in PBS) the cells were incubatated with an anti-insulin mAb (2D11-H5 at 1:250; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 45 min. The cells were subsequently incubated for 45 min with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). To reveal F-actin organization the cells were washed and further stained for 20 min with an Alexa Fluor 546 phalloidin conjugate (1:100 dilution; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were photographed using an inverted Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescent microscope and a 60× objective. Cell Adhesion and Spreading Assays—96-Well high binding EIA plates (Costar, Corning, NY) were coated with VN (5 μg/ml in PBS) for 4 h at 37 °C. These wells were subsequently blocked with 5% BSA for 45 min prior to use. Control wells received BSA alone. Adult and fetal pancreatic cell monolayers on HTB-9 matrix (70-80% confluence) were harvested with a 0.025% trypsin/Versene solution, and single cell populations were added at 1 × 104 cells/well in fibroblast basal medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 0.5% BSA and 0.4 mm MnCl2 (pH 7.4). The contribution of integrins to cell adhesion and spreading was assessed using function-blocking antibodies as specified under “Results.” The cells were pretreated with the antibodies for 20 min prior to the addition of both cells and antibodies to VN-coated wells. Anti-integrin mAbs were used at 40 μg/ml. Cells were allowed to adhere at 37 °C for 90 min and were then carefully washed and non-adherent cells removed under a constant vacuum. Remaining adherent cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde. To detect adherent β-cells, the paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X, blocked, and incubated for 45 min with a sheep pAb to human insulin (dilution 1:500; The Binding Site Inc.). After washing, the cells were incubated for a further 45 min with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated donkey anti-sheep antibody absorbed against mouse serum (dilution 1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Color was developed using Vector Red® substrate as recommended by the manufacturer (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Insulin-positive cells per field were counted using an inverted microscope equipped with a 20× objective and an occular grid. β-Cell spreading was assessed by enumerating round versus spread insulin-positive cells per field. Treatments were performed in duplicate and a minimum of eight fields were scored per well. After evaluating β-cell adhesion adherent epithelial cells were visualized by staining with 1% toluidine blue for 20 min. The adhesion and spreading of these cells were assessed as described for β-cells. The percentage of β-cells attaching to immobilized VN was determined by calculating the number of insulin-positive cells seeded per well versus the number of positive cells that had attached per well by the end of the assay. The number of positive cells seeded was determined by immunostaining harvested cells in suspension and then counting positive cells with the aid of a hemocytometer. Migration Assays—Migration was assessed using 6-well Transwell migration plates from Costar. The undersides of the insert membranes (8.0 μm pore size) were coated with VN (5 μg/ml in PBS) for 4 h at 37 °C. Control wells were treated with 5% BSA. Adult and fetal pancreatic cells expanded on HTB-9 matrix (70-80% confluence) were harvested with 0.025% trypsin/Versene and were re-suspended in fibroblast basal medium supplemented with 0.5% BSA and 0.4 mm MnCl2 (pH 7.4). The cells were then added to migration plates at 5 × 105 cells per insert. The contribution of integrins to migration was assessed using function-blocking antibodies as specified in the results section. The cells were pretreated with the antibodies for 20 min prior to the addition of both cells and antibodies to migration plates. Anti-integrin mAbs were used at 40 μg/ml and were added to upper and lower chambers. Directed migration from the upper to lower chamber of the transwell was determined after 12-14 h. Cells on the underside of the membrane inserts were fixed, permeabilized, and stained for insulin as described above for adhesion and spreading assays. The upper side of the membrane inserts was swabbed to remove cells that failed to migrate. The entire underside of the insert was then scanned and counted for insulin-positive cells using an inverted microscope equipped with a 40× objective. Migrant epithelial cells on the underside of the inserts were counted after staining with 1% toluidine blue. Epithelial cells were counted per grid field using a 20× objective, and a minimum of eight fields were scored per membrane. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—The integrin expression profiles of adult and fetal pancreatic cells were determined by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Fetal and adult pancreatic preparations were expanded for 3 days on HTB-9 matrix prior to the harvesting of cell monolayers using a lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 1% Nonidet P-40 (pH 8.0), and an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After 30 min on ice, lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min and were precleared by mixing with protein-G-agarose beads (100 μl of beads/500 μg of lysate; Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C. Cleared lysates were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a rabbit pAb to the αv-integrin subunit (1:100 dilution; AB1930; Chemicon). An equal quantitity of protein was also incubated with 5 μl normal rabbit serum as a control. Integrin-antibody complexes were immunoprecitated by mixing with protein-G-agarose beads (100 μl) for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed, mixed in non-reducing sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Immunoprecipitates and untreated cell lysates were electrophoresed under non-reducing conditions on 5-12% Tris-glycine polyacrilamide gels. Protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride paper and blotted with antibodies to various integrin subunits including β1 (LM534), β3 (AP3), β5 (11D1), and αv (LM142). Flow Cytometry—Surface integrin expression associated with fetal or adult pancreatic cells was assessed by flow cytometry (FACS) analysis. Subconfluent monolayer cultures were harvested with 0.025% trypsin/Versene, washed, and stained with FITC-conjugated antibodies to human αv (IMM-1044; Immunotech), αvβ3 (PM6/13; Chemicon), and αvβ5 (P1F6; Chemicon). FITC-conjugated isotype-matched antibodies were used as controls. Expression of the β1-subunit was determined by staining a mAb P4C10 (Chemicon) followed by a FITC-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG secondary (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Cells were incubated with primary or secondary antibodies for 60 min in 100 μl of ice-cold FACS buffer (PBS, 0.1% BSA, 0.2% sodium azide). Cells were analyzed using a FACscan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Fetal and Adult β-Cells Adhere Equally to VN but Show Disparate Levels of Spreading and Actin Organization—VN was selected as a substrate for adhesion assays based on its expression in the developing pancreas and its ability to serve as ligand for multiple αv-integrins. Levels of β-cell and PEC attachment over time were assessed using both fetal and adult pancreatic preparations. The number of insulin-positive cells plated at the start of the assay was determined by immunostaining and then counting positive cells with a hemocytometer. The percentage of β-cells adhering to immobilized VN was then calculated by staining and counting the number of attached insulin positive cells per well. Using this approach, it was determined that ∼50% of the β-cells plated attached to VN over a 30-180-min time course (Fig. 1A). Levels of attachment between adult and fetal β-cells were comparable (Fig. 1A), and no attachment to BSA-blocked control wells was observed (not shown). Adult and fetal PEC attachment was also equivalent, but the fraction of PEC adhering to VN was higher than that observed for both adult or fetal β-cells (Fig. 1A). Please note that only strongly adherent β-cells are likely to remain after the multiple washing steps required for insulin immunostaining. Despite comparable levels of adhesion, adult and fetal β-cells showed marked differences in their ability to spread and reorganize actin after attachment to VN. While the majority of fetal β-cells spread after 90 min, most adult β-cells failed to do so (Fig. 1B, left panel). Despite the spreading deficit of adult β-cells, adult PEC in the same preparations spread just as well as their fetal counterparts (Fig. 1B, right panel). The disparity in spreading between insulin-positive fetal and adult cells is shown in Fig. 2, A and B. By simultaneous staining for insulin (green) and actin (red) it was confirmed that fetal β-cells reorganize their actin to form small actin-rich filopodia and weak stress fibers, while most adult β-cells (>80%) had no clear actin organization whatsoever (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast to fetal and adult β-cells, PEC in the same preparations adopted a characteristic epithelial morphology with large well defined lamellipodia and distinct stress fibers (Fig. 2, C-F). Occasional adherent fibroblasts (Fb.) in the pancreatic preparations were distinguished by a characteristic elongated morphology (Fig. 2E). These findings confirm that VN can serve as a robust substrate for β-cell attachment and point to a profound developmental difference in the relative ability of adult and fetal β-cells to spread and reorganize actin on this susbstrate. β-Cells Utilize Multiple Integrins to Attach to VN but Require αvβ1 for a Spreading Response—Adhesion assays were performed using fetal ICC and adult islet preparations and the contribution of individual integrin subunits or heterodimers assessed using specific function blocking antibodies. β-Cell adhesion to VN in the presence or absence of these antibodies was assessed by counting the number of adherent insulin-positive cells per unit area. Confirming a dominant role for αv-integrins, a function blocking antibody to the αv-subunit blocked adult and fetal β-cell adhesion by ∼70% (Fig. 3, A and B). Using an antibody specific for the αvβ5 heterodimer it was confirmed that 50-60% of this αv-mediated adhesion can be attributed to ligation of αvβ5 (Fig. 3, A and B). Blocking the β1-integrin subunit also had a significant impact, particularly on the adhesion of fetal β-cells (Fig. 3, A and B). β1-Integrins known to recognize VN, and therefore candidates for supporting β-cell adhesion, include both αvβ1 and α8β1. A further determination of the potential contribution of each of these integrins is, however, complicated by a lack of function-blocking antibodies specific for these heterodimers. The contribution of integrin αvβ3 was consistently found to be minor or insignificant (Fig. 3, A and B). An evaluation of PEC adhesion within the same assays confirmed that these cells, like β-cells, have a strong dependence on αv-integrins and αvβ5 in particular (Fig. 3, C and D). Fetal β-cells that still attached to VN in the presence of antibodies to the αv- or β1-integrin subunit were almost entirely prevented from spreading (Fig. 3E). Complete abrogation of function as a result of blocking either αv- or β1-subunits is regarded as an indication of αvβ1 involvement (32Dahm L.M. Bowers C.W. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1175-1183PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, the results presented in Fig. 3E can be fully explained on the basis that integrin αvβ1 makes a significant contribution to fetal β-cell spreading. Importantly, expression of the αvβ1 heterodimer by fetal pancreatic cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitation studies, which are described later in this report. Significant β-cell spreading still occurred in the presence of an antibody to αvβ5 despite the important contribution of this integrin to initial β-cell attachment (Fig. 3E). Accordingly, αvβ5 either fails to support significant β-cell spreading or is not essential for this process. The finding that blocking β1 completely prevents β-cell spreading supports the notion that αvβ5 cannot substitute for αvβ1 in this process. However, it is important to note that in contrast to fetal β-cells, fetal PEC were able to use both αvβ1 and αvβ5 for cell spreading (Fig. 3F). β-Cell Migration to VN Is Only Evident in Fetal Cells and Requires αvβ1—Conventional transwell migration assays were modified to allow the detection of insulin-positive cells that had migrated to VN. Migration assays were performed using fetal and adult pancreatic preparations, and migrant β-cells were detected on the underside of porous membrane inserts by staining for insulin (Fig 4A). Subsequent staining with toluidine blue allowed the further detection of migrant PEC and occasional fibroblasts (Fb.) (Fig. 4B). Although fetal and adult β-cells adhered equally well to VN (Fig. 1A), only fetal β-cells were able to migrate to this substrate (Fig. 5A). The migration deficit of adult β-cells was not reciprocated by adult PEC, which migrated just as well as their fetal counterparts (Fig. 5B). Indicating an important role for αvβ1, the migration of fetal β-cells to VN was completely abrogated in the presence of antibodies to either the αv- or β1-integrin subunit (Fig. 5C). This result is consistent with the fin"

In addition, JNK has been demonstrated to promote transformation of epithelial cells by increasing both proliferation and survival. Although numerous studies have reported a role for JNK in promoting Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis, there is a paucity in the literature studying the antiapoptotic function of JNK during Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis. Consequently, we have used the recently described specific JNK inhibitor SP600125 and RNA interference to inhibit endogenous JNK activity in the prostate carcinoma cell line DU 145. We demonstrated that endogenous JNK activity increased the expression of a kinase, HIPK3, that has previously been implicated in multidrug resistance in a number of tumors. HIPK3 has also been reported to phosphorylate FADD. The interaction between FADD and caspase-8 was inhibited, but abrogation of JNK activity or HIPK3 expression was found to restore this interaction and increased the sensitivity of DU 145 cells to Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis. In conclusion, we present novel evidence that JNK regulates the expression of HIPK3 in prostate cancer cells, and this contributes to increased resistance to Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis by reducing the interaction between FADD and caspase-8.

The Fas receptor is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily of receptors and is expressed in many tissues (1Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4559) Google Scholar). Ligation of Fas receptor with Fas ligand or Fas-activating antibodies results in Fas receptor clustering at the plasma membrane, recruitment, and activation of caspase-8 via the adapter protein FADD and subsequent cleavage of a number of downstream targets, culminating in apoptosis (2Algeciras-Schimnich A.

Fas-mediated apoptosis is believed to be a mechanism by which the immune system destroys defective cells or cells expressing abnormal surface proteins (3O'Connell J. Houston A. Bennett M.W. O'Sullivan G.C. Shanahan F. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition, various anti-cancer drugs are dependent on Fas receptor activation in order to induce apoptosis (4Micheau O. Solary E. Hammann A. Dimanche-Boitrel M.T. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 287-294PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, there is a selective pressure on tumor cells to inhibit Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis, and resistance to Fas is a common event during cancer progression. Prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer in men and is a leading cause of death in elderly males (6Parkin D.M. Bray F.I. Devesa S.S. Eur. J. Cancer. 2001; 37: 4-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Current chemotherapeutic regimens do not increase long term survival in patients with prostate cancer (7Petrylak D.P. Urology. 1999; 54: 30-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and this has been linked to an increased resistance to Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis (8Hedlund T.E. Duke R.C. Schleicher M.S. Miller G.J. Prostate. 1998; 36: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Hormone-refractory prostate cancer usually displays increased malignancy, proliferation, and metastatic potential over androgen-sensitive tumors and can survive in the absence of androgen. Transformation of prostate epithelial cells from a preneoplastic state into an intraepithelial neoplasm requires a number of sequential genetic alterations (9Dong J.T. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2001; 20: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Some of these aberrations in protein function increase the resistance of prostate cancer cells to apoptosis, whereas others decrease the dependence of prostate cancer cells on growth factors for survival and proliferation. One protein that has been implicated in transformation and progression in numerous tumors including prostate cancer (10Potapova O. Anisimov S.V. Gorospe M. Dougherty R.H. Gaarde W.A. Boheler K.R.

Dean N. McKay R. Rhim J.S. Depatie C. Mercola D. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 391-401PubMed Google Scholar). Antisense strategies designed to reduce JNK expression have been shown to reduce prostate tumor burden and also sensitize these tumors to systemic therapy using chemotherapeutic drugs (17Gjerset R. Haghighi A. Lebedeva S. Mercola D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 175: 495-520PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate the role of endogenous JNK activity in Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis in prostate cancer. In contrast with our recent publications, where we show that prolonged overactivation of JNK is proapoptotic in prostate cancer cells (18Costa-Pereira A.P. McKenna S.L. Cotter T.G. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 82: 1827-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Curtin J.F. Cotter T.G. Br. J. Cancer. 2002; 87: 1188-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we demonstrate here that endogenous JNK activity can promote survival in DU 145 prostate cancer cells. We show that inhibition of endogenous JNK activity decreases the expression of the Fas/FADD-interacting kinase HIPK3 (FIST/PKY/DYRK6). The interaction between FADD and caspase-8 is defective in DU 145 cells, but incubation with SP600125 restores the affinity of FADD for caspase-8 and restores the ability of DU 145 cells to undergo Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis. Cell Lines and Reagents—DU 145, PC-3, and Jurkat T cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). PPC-1 and ALVA 31 cells were a gift of Gary and Heidi Miller (University of Colorado). DU 145 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 4 mml-glutamine (all from Sigma). PC-3, PPC-1, and ALVA 31 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 4 mml-glutamine. Jurkat T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mml-glutamine, and 10 IU ml–1 penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C and routinely subcultured every 2–3 days. Unless otherwise stated, cells were grown to 75% confluence before treatment with various drugs and inhibitors. The probes used for the apoptosis assays were annexin V-FITC (IQ Products), propidium iodide (Sigma), and JC-1 (Molecular Probes). The primary antibodies used in this study were rabbit anti-c-Jun (Calbiochem); mouse anti-actin clone AC-15 (Sigma); mouse anti-phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) clone G9, mouse anti-caspase-8 clone IC12, and rabbit anti-caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit anti-JNK and rabbit anti-protein kinase Cζ (anti-PKCζ) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit anti-BID (BioSource International); mouse anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PharMingen); mouse anti-FADD clone IF7 and rabbit anti-ERK2 (Upstate Biotechnology); and rabbit anti-rat HIPK3 (a gift of Jorma Palvimo, University of Helsinki, Finland). All peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from DAKO (Denmark). Rabbit anti-FADD (Upstate Biotechnology) was used for immunoprecipitations and protein G-agarose slurry was purchased from Pierce. The Fas-activating mouse anti-Fas IgM (clone CH11) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. The JNK inhibitor SP600125, the Mek1 inhibitor U0126, the p38 inhibitor SB203580, the PKCζ pseudosubstrate inhibitor, and the caspase inhibitors Z-IETD-fmk and Z-LEHD-fmk were from Calbiochem. Small interfering RNA oligonucleotides and control oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon, and oligofectamine was purchased from Invitrogen. Primers used to amplify mRNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR were designed using GeneFisher software and were purchased from MWG. Other reagents required for reverse transcriptase-PCR were bought from Promega, λ-phosphatase was purchased from New England Biolabs, and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Apoptosis Assays—Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide were used to detect apoptosis by flow cytometry as described previously (20Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4607) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, cells were incubated with 200 ng ml–1 anti-Fas IgM for 24 h. Cells were preincubated for 1 h with 0.5% Me2SO in the presence or absence of SP600125. Caspase inhibitors were added to cells 10 min prior to treating with anti-Fas IgM. Cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences) was used to analyze the data. Mitochondrial membrane depolarization can be measured in intact cells using the fluorescent cationic cell-permeable probe JC-1 (21Salvioli S. Ardizzoni A. Franceschi C. Cossarizza A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). DU 145 cells were incubated for 24 h with SP600125 and anti-Fas IgM as described above and incubated with JC-1 probe as described previously (21Salvioli S. Ardizzoni A. Franceschi C. Cossarizza A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, and a decrease in FL-2 fluorescence is indicative of mitochondrial membrane depolarization. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were treated as described in the figure legends. The cells were then harvested and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4; 150 mm NaCl; 1 mm each NaF, NaVO4, and EGTA; 1% Nonidet P-40; 0.25% sodium deoxycholate; 0.2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride; 1 μg ml–1 each antipain, aprotinin, and chymostatin; 0.1 μg ml–1 leupeptin; 4 μg ml–1 pepstatin) for 20 min on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min to remove insoluble debris, and protein concentrations were determined. At least 30 μg of protein was loaded into each lane of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis of the samples and transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane were carried out. Staining of the membrane with the various antibodies was performed using the manufacturer's recommended protocol. λ-Phosphatase Treatment of Cell Lysates—λ-Phosphatase treatment was carried out on DU 145 cell lysates as described previously (22Zhou S. Tannery N.H. Yang J. Puszkin S. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12655-12662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 μg of protein was diluted in 10 μl of 1× phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35, 2 mm MnCl2) with or without 1 μl of λ-phosphatase and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Samples were diluted in SDS-PAGE loading dye, and Western blot analysis was carried out as described earlier. Cell Cycle Analysis—DU 145 cells were treated with 50 μm SP600125, 8 mm hydroxyurea, and 2 μg ml–1 nocodazole for 24 h. At least 200,000 DU 145 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline/EDTA and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol overnight at –20 °C. Cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline/EDTA with 40 μg ml–1 propidium iodide and 200 μgml–1 DNase-free RNase A (Sigma) in the dark for 30 min, and DNA content of cells was analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer. RNA Interference—Cells were transfected with target or control siRNA (see Table I for sequences) using oligofectamine following the manufacturer's protocol exactly. Expression of HIPK3 was determined every day after transfection, and 4–5 days after transfection was found to be optimal for silencing HIPK3 in DU 145 cells. RNA and protein were extracted, taken on day 4, and apoptosis assays were begun on day 4 and completed by day 5.Table ITarget sequences for RNA interferenceNameSequenceControl5′-AAA AAU UUC CAC CCC CCG GGC-3′HIPK35′-AAU ACU UAC GAA GUC CUU CAU-3′JNK15′-AAG GAA TAG TAT GCG CAG CTT-3′5′-GAAGCTCCACCACCAAAGATC-3′JNK25′-GACTCAACCTTCACTGTCCTA-3′5′-CAGCGTGCACTAACTTCATGA-3′c-JunSMARTPOOL™ Open table in a new tab Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—RNA was extracted from 100,000 DU 145 cells using Trizol reagent, and 0.5 μg was converted to cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase.

Total cell protein was diluted to 1 μg ml–1 in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 10 μg μl–1 rabbit anti-FADD overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-agarose-conjugated beads (Pierce) were prepared according to the manufacturer's recommended instructions and incubated with the samples for a further 2 h at 4 °C. FADD was immunoprecipitated by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 3 min. The beads were washed four times in phosphate-buffered saline and boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 5 min. The agarose beads were precipitated out of solution by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 2 min, and the sample was loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blot. SP600125 Inhibits Endogenous JNK Activity in DU 145 Prostate Carcinoma Cells—Increased JNK activity, in particular JNK2, has been implicated in promoting proliferation and drug resistance in prostate cancer (10Potapova O. Anisimov S.V. Gorospe M. Dougherty R.H. Gaarde W.A. Boheler K.R. Holbrook N.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3257-3263PubMed Google Scholar). Administering antisense directed against JNK1 and JNK2 inhibited prostate tumor growth significantly by increasing the susceptibility of cells to apoptosis (16Yang Y.M. Bost F. Charbono W. Dean N. McKay R. Rhim J.S. Depatie C. Mercola D. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 391-401PubMed Google Scholar) and was found to sensitize prostate cancer cells to cytotoxic drugs (23Potapova O. Haghighi A. Bost F. Liu C. Birrer M.J. Gjerset R. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14041-14044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). JNK can activate the transcription factor c-Jun by phosphorylating two key residues, Ser63 and Ser73. Once phosphorylated, active c-Jun can alter the expression of a number of genes, including itself. We used the specific JNK inhibitor SP600125 (24Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar) to inhibit JNK activity in DU 145 prostate carcinoma cells. JNK activity was assessed by analyzing the extent of normal c-Jun expression and phosphorylation in DU 145 cells incubated with and without 50 μm SP600125. In addition, the effects of SP600125 on the high levels of JNK activity that accompanies incubation with anisomycin were also analyzed. We found that c-Jun expression was reduced when incubated with 50 μm SP600125 for 4 h. Furthermore, anisomycin-mediated phosphorylation of c-Jun was partially inhibited in cells pretreated with 50 μm SP600125 for 4 h. These data suggested that 50 μm SP600125 inhibits endogenous JNK activity in resting DU 145 cells and can also reduce the activity of JNK following treatment with anisomycin (Fig. 1A). The upstream JNK kinase MKK4 can be inhibited when high concentrations of SP600125 are used (24Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). We investigated whether MKK4 was significantly inhibited in DU 145 cells using 50 μm SP600125 and found that phosphorylation of JNK at Thr183 and Tyr185 by anisomycin was not affected in cells co-incubated with 50 μm SP600125. This suggests that inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway by SP600125 in DU 145 cells is due entirely to inhibition of JNK activity and not through inhibiting other upstream kinases in the JNK cascade (Fig. 1B). SP600125 Sensitizes DU 145 Prostate Carcinoma Cells to Fas-mediated Apoptosis—We used 50 μm SP600125 to decrease the endogenous activity of JNK in DU 145 prostate carcinoma cells and observed a concomitant increase in the sensitivity of these cells to Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 1C). This was also evident for PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells (data not shown). This suggests that JNK increases the resistance to Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis in resting prostate carcinoma cells. Treatment with the caspase-8-specific inhibitor Z-IETD-fmk completely abrogated apoptosis, demonstrating that apoptosis in response to SP600125 and anti-Fas IgM was entirely dependent on caspase-8 activity (Fig. 1C). This result agrees with the current theory that caspase-8 is the apical caspase in the Fas receptor pathway and is absolutely required for the subsequent caspase cascade and apoptosis following Fas receptor engagement with Fas ligand. In contrast, inhibition of caspase-9 activity with the specific inhibitor Z-LEHD-fmk did not completely abrogate apoptosis in response to treatment with SP600125 and anti-Fas IgM. Therefore, mitochondrial amplification of caspase-9 activity may accelerate, but it is not absolutely required for apoptosis in response to SP600125 and anti-Fas IgM (Fig. 1C). It has been reported that lower concentrations of SP600125 can inhibit JNK activity in some cells (24Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). We incubated DU 145 cells with 25 and 50 μm SP600125 and analyzed JNK activity through c-Jun expression. Although 50 μm SP600125 effectively reduces c-Jun expression, we found that 25 μm SP600125 was insufficient for decreasing JNK activity in DU 145 cells (Fig. 1D). In addition, 25 μm SP600125 did not significantly increase sensitivity of cells to Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 1E). These data suggest that 50 μm is the minimum concentration of SP600125 that inhibits JNK activity in DU 145 prostate cancer cells. JNK Activity Inversely Correlates with Sensitivity to Fas Receptor-mediated Apoptosis in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines— Antisense strategies against JNK have proved effective in animal models of prostate cancer, suggesting that JNK activity plays a role in prostate tumor progression (17Gjerset R. Haghighi A. Lebedeva S. Mercola D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 175: 495-520PubMed Google Scholar). We analyzed levels of phosphorylated JNK in four prostate cancer cell lines; DU 145 cells and PC3 cells were originally isolated from prostate cancer metastases, whereas PPC-1 and ALVA 31 cells originated from primary tumors. We found that DU 145 cells, PC3 cells, and PPC-1 cells all express high levels of phosphorylated JNK in comparison with ALVA 31 cells. Total JNK levels were similar in all cell lines studied (Fig. 1A). Although DU 145, PC3, and PPC-1 cells all express significantly more c-Jun than ALVA 31 cells, this is most striking in DU 145 cells (Fig. 2B). When we compared these data with the sensitivity of cells to Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis, we found that elevated endogenous JNK activity correlated with resistance to Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis in prostate carcinoma cell lines (Fig. 2C). Only ALVA 31 cells were found to be sensitive to apoptosis induced by anti-Fas IgM. Endogenous JNK Activity Increases the Resistance of DU 145 Cells to Fas-mediated Apoptosis by Inhibiting Caspase-8 Activation by Fas Receptor—Our data suggest that elevated JNK activity prevents Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines. In order to gain further insight into this novel antiapoptotic function of JNK, we analyzed the major events that occur following incubation with SP600125 and anti-Fas IgM in DU 145 cells. We found that caspase-8 is only cleaved and activated when FADD and caspase-8 are recruited together to the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) following Fas receptor engagement with anti-Fas IgM. Detectable cleavage products of caspase-8 were only evident in cells coincubated with both SP600125 and anti-Fas IgM (Fig. 3A). As a result, the recruitment and cleavage of caspase-8 in the DISC is defective in resting DU 145 cells, and inhibition of JNK activity can increase the cleavage of caspase-8 in response to anti-Fas IgM. We also analyzed events downstream of caspase-8 activation during Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis and observed cleavage and activation of Bid only in DU 145 cells incubated with both SP600125 and anti-Fas IgM (Fig. 3B). In addition, we only detected mitochondrial membrane depolarization and caspase-3 cleavage products in response to anti-Fas IgM when endogenous JNK activity had been decreased (Fig. 3, C and D). These results suggested that inhibition of JNK using SP600125 facilitated DU 145 cells to undergo Fas-mediated apoptosis primarily by enhancing either recruitment of or subsequent cleavage of caspase-8 at the DISC. FADD Phosphorylation Is Regulated by Endogenous JNK in DU 145 Cells—A number of proteins are recruited to the cytoplasmic domain of Fas receptor oligomers. These include FADD, RIP, RAIDD, and DAXX, which function primarily as adapter proteins, and caspase-2, caspase-8, caspase-10, FLIP, and ASK1, which initiate various proteolytic and kinase cascades in cells (25Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). We did not observe any significant alterations in expression of Fas receptor, Fas ligand, FADD, caspase-8, DAXX, or FLIP in response to SP600125 treatment (data not shown). However, although FADD migrated as a double band in untreated and anti-Fas IgM-treated cells, incubation with SP600125 reduced the expression of the upper band (Fig. 4A). In addition, we found that SP600125 could reduce this double band in the prostate carcinoma cell lines PC-3, ALVA 31, and PPC-1 (data not shown). Incubation of protein extracts with λ-phosphatase reduced the expression of the upper band, confirming that this mobility shift was due to dephosphorylation of FADD (Fig. 4B). Recently, it has been demonstrated that ERK can regulate FADD phosphorylation in leukemia cells. The authors demonstrated that inhibition of ERK activity using CI-1040 reduced FADD phosphorylation over a 72-h period and concomitantly increased the sensitivity of these cells to Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis (26Meng X.W. Chandra J. Loegering D. Van Becelaere K. Kottke T.J. Gore S.D. Karp J.E. Sebolt-Leopold J. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47326-47339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We also observed a decrease in FADD phosphorylation and a concomitant increase in the sensitivity of cells to Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis. However, induction of apoptosis is more rapid in our system and is evident after 24 h. We analyzed the extent of FADD phosphorylation after 1-, 8-, and 24-h incubation with SP600125. We found that although FADD dephosphorylation was not immediate, it preceded induction of apoptosis and began to decrease significantly after 8 h (Fig. 4C). We were concerned that SP600125 may also inhibit ERK activity and consequently reduce the extent of FADD phosphorylation in DU 145 cells. Therefore, we inhibited ERK activity using the Mek inhibitor U0126 and p38 activity using the p38 inhibitor SB203580. We found that FADD phosphorylation in DU 145 cells was not dependent on either ERK activity or p38 activity (Fig. 4D). Next we wished to determine whether increased JNK activity could also increase the levels of FADD phosphorylation. However, 250 ng ml–1 anisomycin did not increase the levels of FADD phosphorylation in DU 145 cells (Fig. 4E). This suggests that either JNK-dependent FADD phosphorylation is already at a maximum level or that different signal transduction pathways are activated during endogenous JNK activity and anisomycin-induced JNK activity. JNK Does Not Regulate Cell Cycle Progression in DU 145 Cells—FADD phosphorylation has previously been described and correlates with cell cycle progression. Cells arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle display predominantly unphosphorylated FADD, whereas cells arrested during mitosis display predominantly phosphorylated FADD (27Scaffidi C. Volkland J. Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1236-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition, JNK has previously been implicated in cell cycle progression during DNA synthesis (28Potapova O. Gorospe M. Bost F. Dean N.M. Gaarde W.A. Mercola D. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24767-24775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and it was possible that JNK regulated FADD phosphorylation by arresting DU 145 cells in the G1 phase or S phase. We confirmed that phosphorylation of FADD is regulated by cell cycle-dependent kinase in DU 145 cells using 8 mm hydroxyurea to arrest cells during G1 phase and 2 μg ml–1 nocodazole to arrest cells during mitosis (Fig. 5A). However, incubation with SP600125 did not arrest DU 145 cells in the S phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 5, B and C). In addition, the rate of proliferation of cells incubated with SP600125 was not significantly altered compared with untreated DU 145 cells (data not shown). These data suggest that JNK does not regulate FADD phosphorylation in DU 1"

Here we show that ALT-C also inhibits the adhesion of a mouse fibroblast cell line (NIH-3T3) to collagen I (IC50 2.2 μm). In addition, when immobilized on plate wells, ALT-C supports the adhesion of this cell line as well as of human vein endothelial cell (HUVEC). ALT-C (3 μm) does not detach cells that were previously bound to collagen I. ALT-C (5 nm) induces HUVEC proliferation in vitro, and it inhibits the positive effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or FGF-2 on the proliferation of these cells, thus suggesting a common mechanism for these proteins. Gene expression analysis of human fibroblasts growing on ALT-C- or collagen-coated plates showed that ALT-C and collagen I induce a very similar pattern of gene expression. When compared with cells growing on plastic only, ALT-C up-regulates the expression of 45 genes including the VEGF gene and down-regulates the expression of 30 genes. Fibroblast VEGF expression was confirmed by RT-PCR and ELISA assay. Up-regulation of the VEGF gene and other growth factors could explain the positive effect on HUVEC proliferation. ALT-C also strongly activates Akt/PKB phosphorylation, a signaling event involved in endothelial survival and angiogenesis.

Cell attachment to the extracellular matrix depends mostly on the integrins, a large family of glycoproteins expressed at the cell surface (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Google Scholar). Integrins are heterodimers formed of noncovalently associated α- and β-subunits (2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1987; 48: 549-554Google Scholar). In many cells in culture, integrin-mediated adhesion results in specialized adhesion sites, named focal contacts (3Lo S.H. Chen L.B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 9-24Google Scholar). In these sites, structural and signaling proteins such as integrins, cytoskeletal proteins, and kinases are concentrated and initiate signal transduction pathways (4LaFlamme S.E. Auer K.L. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 111-118Google Scholar). Aggregation of integrin receptors, ligand occupancy, and tyrosine kinase-mediated phosphorylation are the key events that results in diverse processes such as cell migration and differentiation, tissue remodeling, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and tumor cell invasion and metastasis (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Google Scholar, 5Juliano R.L. Varner J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 812-818Google Scholar). Antagonists of integrins have been developed in order to provide powerful therapeutic approaches for the treatment of several types of cancer, such as antibodies to the αv integrin (6Mitjans F. Sander D. Adan J. Sutter A. Martinez J.M. Jaggle C.S. Moyano J.M. Kreysch H.G. Piulats J. Goodman S.L. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2825-2838Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides with the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) can competitively block the binding of several integrins to their ligands and efficiently reduce platelet aggregation and the number of experimental metastasis (7Saiki I.

Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 502-512Google Scholar). Disintegrins are small peptides derived from viperidae snake venoms with an internal RGD or KGD motif (9Gould R.J. Polokoff M.A. Friedman P.A. Huang T.F. Holt J.C. Cook J.J. Niewiarowski S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1990; 195: 168-171Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Disintegrins can bind to integrins and interfere with integrin function. In platelets, disintegrins inhibit the adhesion of fibrinogen to its receptor, the integrin αIIbβ3, resulting in inhibition of platelet aggregation (10Huang T.F. Holt J.C. Lukasiewicz H. Niewiarowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6157-6163Google Scholar, 11Gan Z.R. Gould R.J. Jacobs J.W. Friedman P.A. Polokoff M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19827-19832Google Scholar). Some RGD-disintegrins have been shown to inhibit tumor cell-extracellular matrix adhesion (12Sheu J.R. Huang T.F. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 158-162Google Scholar) and decrease the number of experimental metastasis (13Trikha M. De Clerck Y.A. Markland F.S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4993-4998Google Scholar, 14Danen E.H. Marcinkiewicz C. Cornelissen I.M. van Kraats A.A. Pachter J.A. Ruiter D.J. Niewiarowski S. van Muijen G.N. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 188-196Google Scholar). RGD-disintegrins bind mostly to α5β1 or αvβ3 integrins in distinct cell types therefore inhibiting also cell adhesion to fibronectin (13Trikha M. De Clerck Y.A. Markland F.S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4993-4998Google Scholar). Accutin and triflavin, two RGD-disintegrins from Agkistrodon acutus and Trimeresurus flavoviridis venoms, respectively, inhibit angiogenesis and induce apoptosis in endothelial cells (15Yeh C.H. Peng H.C. Huang T.F. Blood. 1998; 92: 3268-3276Google Scholar, 16Sheu J.R. Yen M.H. Kan Y.C. Hung W.C. Chang P.T. Luk H.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 445-454Google Scholar). The VAP1 protein (vascular apoptosis-inducing protein) isolated from Crotalus atrox venom is a metalloprotease/disintegrin that induces apoptosis (17Araki S. Masuda S. Maeda H. Ying M.J. Hayashi H. Toxicon. 2002; 40: 535-542Google Scholar). Since it was shown that the RGD-dependent αvβ3 integrin provides a survival signal to proliferative endothelial cells during new blood vessel growth (18Brooks P.C. Clark R.A. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1994; 264: 569-571Google Scholar, 19Friedlander M. Brooks P.C. Shaffer R.W. Kincaid C.M. Varner J.A. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1500-1502Google Scholar), it is thought that the anti-adhesive activity of RGD-disintegrins on endothelial cells may contribute to their anti-angiogenic activity. A different class of disintegrin is also found in some snake venoms that do not have the RGD motif. These proteins are larger than the RGD-disintegrins (about 30 kDa) and they have an extra C-terminal, cysteine-rich domain (20Paine M.J. Desmond H.P. Theakston R.D. Crampton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22869-22876Google Scholar, 21Hite L.A. Jia L.G. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 182-191Google Scholar, 22Jia L.G. Wang X.M. Shannon J.D. Bjarnason J.B.

These disintegrin-like proteins do not bind to the integrin αIIbβ3, α5β1, or αvβ3, but they interact with the collagen receptor, the α2β1 integrin therefore inhibiting cell adhesion to collagen I (23Souza D.H. Iemma M.R. Ferreira L.L. Faria J.P. Oliva M.L. Zingali R.B. Niewiarowski S. Selistre-de-Araujo H.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 341-350Google Scholar). The majority of the RGD and non-RGD disintegrins is synthesized in the venom gland as precursor forms having a pro- and metalloprotease domains, and proteolytic processing of these proteins releases the disintegrin-like/cysteine-rich domain (20Paine M.J. Desmond H.P. Theakston R.D. Crampton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22869-22876Google Scholar, 21Hite L.A. Jia L.G. Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Arch. Biochem.

Related proteins (the ADAMs, 1The abbreviations used are: ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloprotease; Akt/PKB, protein kinase B; BIM, bisindolylmaleimide IV; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CMFDA, 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; EGR, early growth response; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; FGF-2, fibroblast growth factor 2; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; IL-11, interleukin 11; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; TGFβ, transforming growth factor-β; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ALT-C, Alternagin-C. for a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) are found in mammals as well as in several other organisms, in which they are involved in several physiological processes such as fertilization, cell differentiation, and shedding of receptors (25Myles D.G. Kimmel L.H. Blobel C.P. White J.M. Primakoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4195-4198Google Scholar). The ADAMs have a similar domain organization with extra domains including transmembrane and intracellular domains (26Wolfsberg T.G. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 275-278Google Scholar). Both ADAMs and snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) belong to the Reprolysin protein family of metalloproteases (27Fox J.W. Long C. Bailey G. Snake Venom Enzymes. Alaken Press, Ft. Collins, CO1998: 151-178Google Scholar). We have previously described the isolation and characterization of ALT-C, a disintegrin-like protein from Bothrops alternatus snake venom (23Souza D.H. Iemma M.R. Ferreira L.L. Faria J.P. Oliva M.L. Zingali R.B. Niewiarowski S. Selistre-de-Araujo H.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 341-350Google Scholar). ALT-C is synthesized as a precursor form with a metalloprotease domain, from which is released after proteolytic processing, yielding a form with disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains (23Souza D.H. Iemma M.R. Ferreira L.L. Faria J.P. Oliva M.L. Zingali R.B. Niewiarowski S. Selistre-de-Araujo H.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 341-350Google Scholar). ALT-C binds to the α2β1 integrin-transfected-K562 cells therefore inhibiting collagen I adhesion (IC50, 100 nm). When immobilized on plate wells, ALT-C promotes the adhesion of α2β1 integrin transfected-K562 cells but not the adhesion of control cells. ALT-C does not bind to the integrins αIIbβ3, α5β1, αvβ3, α1β1, α9β1, and α4β1 (23Souza D.H. Iemma M.R. Ferreira L.L. Faria J.P. Oliva M.L. Zingali R.B. Niewiarowski S. Selistre-de-Araujo H.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 341-350Google Scholar). In human neutrophils, ALT-C also induces migration via integrin signaling, with activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and its association with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), leading to the increase in the content of F-actin and Erk-2 nuclear translocation (28Mariano-Oliveira A. Coelho A.L. Terruggi C.H.B. Selistre-de-Araujo H.S. Barja-Fidalgo C. Freitas M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4799-4808Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that jararhagin, a metalloprotease/disintegrin homologue from Bothrops jararaca venom mimics the collagen interaction with fibroblasts resulting in an up-regulation of the α2β1 integrin and the matrix metalloproteases MMP-1 and MT1-MMP genes (29Zigrino P. Kamiguti A.S. Eble J. Drescher C. Nischt R. Fox J.W. Mauch C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40528-40535Google Scholar). Therefore, disintegrin-like proteins can activate integrins leading to significant modifications of cellular events and it may be in a different way from the RGD-disintegrins. However, these events are not well understood yet. In the present work we show that ALT-C induces endothelial cell proliferation in vitro, and these effects could be mediated at least in part by an increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor. These effects are opposite to those observed for most RGD-disintegrins, which inhibit angiogenesis and induce apoptosis (15Yeh C.H. Peng H.C. Huang T.F. Blood. 1998; 92: 3268-3276Google Scholar, 30Hong S.Y. Lee H. You W.K. Chung K.H. Kim D.S. Song K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 502-508Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first report of a disintegrin acting as a survival factor. Materials—The venom of B. alternatus was kindly provided by the venom commission of Instituto Butantan, São Paulo, SP, Brazil. Alternagin-C (ALT-C) was purified from B. alternatus as previously described (23Souza D.H. Iemma M.R. Ferreira L.L. Faria J.P. Oliva M.L. Zingali R.B. Niewiarowski S. Selistre-de-Araujo H.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 341-350Google Scholar). Recombinant human FGF-2, VEGF165 and the mouse anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (clone 26503) were purchased from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN. Genistein, LY294002, PMA, and bisindolylmaleimide IV (BIM) were from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA. Protein A/G-agarose, anti-Akt, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase was from Caltag Laboratories. Cell Lines—Mouse embryo fibroblasts NIH-3T3 were from American Type Culture Collection. Human fibroblasts were obtained from Clonetics™. Isolation of Human Endothelial Cells—Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were routinely obtained by treatment of umbilical veins with 0.1% collagenase IV solution (Sigma) as previously described (31Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Google Scholar) and maintained in 199 medium (M-199) with HEPES (Sigma) supplemented with antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin), 2 mm glutamine, and 20% fetal calf serum (FCS, Cultilab, Campinas, Brazil), at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere until they reached confluence. Cells were used in first or second passages only, and subcultures were obtained by treatment of confluent cultures with 0.025% trypsin/0.2% EDTA solution in PBS. Inhibition of Cell Adhesion—Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, streptomycin, fungizon, and geneticin in the case of transfected cells at 37 °C in a water-jacketed CO2 incubator. Adhesion of cells labeled with 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CMFDA) was performed as described previously (23Souza D.H. Iemma M.R. Ferreira L.L. Faria J.P. Oliva M.L. Zingali R.B. Niewiarowski S. Selistre-de-Araujo H.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 341-350Google Scholar). Briefly, collagen type I (1 μg/well), was immobilized on a 96-well microtiter plates (Falcon, Pittsburgh, PA) in 20 mm HEPES buffer plus 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 1 mm MnCl2 (adhesion buffer) overnight at 4 °C. Wells were blocked with 1% BSA in adhesion buffer. Cells (5 × 106/ml) were labeled by incubation with 12.5 μm 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate in adhesion buffer at 37 °C for 30 min. Unbound label was removed by washing with the same buffer. Labeled cells were incubated with ALT-C at several concentrations before being transferred to the plate (1 × 105 cells/well) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After washing to remove unbound cells, the remaining cells were lysed by the addition of 0.5% Triton X-100. In parallel, a standard curve was prepared in the same plate using known concentrations of labeled cells. The plates were read using a Spectra-Max Gemini XS fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with a 485-nm excitation and 530-nm emission filters. Adhesion and Detachment Assays—To test if ALT-C could induce cell adhesion, plate wells were coated with ALT-C (0.5–20 μg/ml), and labeled cells were allowed to adhere for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by lysis and measurement of released fluorescence. For detachment assays, collagen type I (0.1–1 μg/well) was immobilized on a 96-microtiter well plate in adhesion buffer overnight at 4 °C. CMFDA-labeled cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were allowed to adhere for 30 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of disintegrins to the medium. After washing with adhesion buffer to remove unbound cells, the remaining cells were lysed, and the plate was read as described above. In the case of HUVECs, the percentage of adhered cells was determined by adding MTT (0.5 mg/ml, final concentration) and incubating at 37 °C for 3 h at 5% CO2. The solution was removed and replaced by 200 μl of isopropyl alcohol, and the absorbance of the solution was measured at 595 nm. Cell Proliferation Assay—HUVECs (104 cells/well) were incubated in a 96-well plate in 100 μl of 199 medium plus 5% FBS for 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Then, 100 μl of fresh medium having FGF-2 or VEGF, ALT-C or both at different concentrations were added to each well, followed by 72 h incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cell concentration was measured by adding MTT (0.5 mg/ml, final concentration) and incubating at 37 °C for 3 h at 5% CO2 as described above. For assays with mouse fibroblasts, FGF-2 and VEGF were omitted. Cell proliferation was also measured in response to immobilized ALT-C. 96-well culture plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were incubated with ALT-C solutions in PBS (1–20 μg/ml), overnight at 4 °C. After blockade with 0.1% BSA in PBS, 1 × 104 cells/well were seeded in 199 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and grown for 72 h. In order to investigate the possibility that the cell counts obtained after 72 h merely reflected a proportional difference in initial cell adhesion rates for each condition, an adhesion assay was run in parallel, and revealed after allowing cells to adhere for 2 h. The number of cells was then quantified by the MTT procedure as above. Gene Expression—Plate wells were coated overnight with ALT-C (10 μg/ml) or collagen type I (40 μg/ml) and then blocked with 1% BSA. Human fibroblasts (passage 4) at 80% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum were seeded (2 × 106 cells/ml) in 10-cm plastic dishes on ALT-C, collagen type I or directly on plastic and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Culture medium was removed, and cells were lysed with lysis buffer from QIAgen RNEasy kit for isolation of total RNA. Target Preparation, GeneChip™ Hybridization, and Data Analysis— Labeled cRNA was synthesized from total RNA according to standard Affymetrix protocols. Briefly, 20 μg per sample of total RNA and a poly(T) primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter were used to generate double-stranded cDNA. A T7 based in vitro transcription reaction (Enzo BioArray HighYield RNA Transcript labeling kit) was used to generate biotin-labeled and amplified cRNA from double-stranded cDNA. Total RNA integrity and cRNA size distribution were analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis in an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Ten microgram samples of labeled cRNA were hybridized to Affymetrix HU-95A probe arrays, containing probes sets representing ∼10,000 genes, for 16 h, and scanned with the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner. Data were analyzed with Affymetrix Microarray Analysis Suite v 5.0 and dChip© softwares. Genes up- or down-regulated at statistical significant levels (p < 0.05) and a fold change of ≥1.5 were considered to be a significant change of gene expression compared with the control cells. Analysis of VEGF Expression by RT-PCR and ELISA—Human fibroblasts were grown on 6 cm dishes coated with ALT-C (10 μg/ml), collagen type I (40 μg/ml) or collagen I treated with soluble ALT-C (400 nm). Cells were lysed 4, 24, and 48 h after treatment, and total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Samples were treated with DNase before the experiments in order to discharge any contaminant DNA. RT-PCR was run using the Superscript one-step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer's instructions. The following VEGF primers were used: forward, GAGCGGAGAAAGCATTTGTTT; reverse TGCAACGCGAGTCTGTGTTT. β-Actin primers were used in the same conditions as endogen controls (forward, CGTGGGCCGCCCTAGGCACCAGGG, and reverse, CGGAGGAAGAGGATGCGGCAGTGG). PCR products were analyzed in a 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. For ELISA, cells were disrupted by using a cell lysis buffer made of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7,4 plus 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% Glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml pepstatin. ELISA assays were performed using the kit Quantikine immunoassay for human VEGF (R&D Systems, Minneaopolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 200 μl of conditioned medium, cell extracts, controls or standards were added on each well, previously coated with human monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody. After 2 h of incubation, wells were washed and incubated with an enzyme-linked polyclonal anti-VEGF antibody. Following another wash, a substrate solution was added to wells and color developed in proportion to the amount of VEGF bound in the initial step. The plate was read on a Dynex plate reader with absorbance of 450 nm. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting for Detecting Akt/PKB Activation—HUVEC monolayers (5 × 105 cells/ml) were preincubated with genistein (80 μm), LY294002 (3 μm), or BIM (10 nm) for 10 min at 37 °C prior to incubation with PMA (30 nm) or ALT-C (5 nm) for 15 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/μl aprotinin, 10 μg/μl leupeptin, 2 μg/μl pepstatin, and1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein content in the cell extracts was determined by the method of Bradford (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Google Scholar). Lysates (2 μg/μl) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Akt/PKB antibody (1:200). Then, protein A/G-agarose (20 μl/mg protein) was added, and samples were incubated at 4 °C under rotation for 2 h. The contents of Akt/PKB and phosphorylated Akt/PKB were analyzed by Western blotting. Cellular proteins (30 μg) were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences) and blocked with Tween-TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Primary antibodies used in Western analysis were anti-Akt/PKB (1:1000) and anti-phosphoserine (1:1000) antibodies. The polyvinylidene difluoride filters were next washed three times with Tween-TBS, followed by a 1-h incubation with appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to biotin. Then, the filters were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (1:1000). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) staining. The bands were quantified by densitometry, using Scion Image Software (Scion Co., Frederick, MD). Statistical significance was assessed by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's t test, and p < 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Statistical Analysis of Data—All adhesion and cell proliferation assays were analyzed for statistical significance. Each experiment was repeated three times in triplicate and mean and standard error mean were calculated. For the comparison of multiple concentrations of ALT-C against the control group, Dunnett's statistical approach was used. For the experiments with one dose of ALT-C in various cell types, each treated group was compared with its own control using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni's post-hoc analysis. Acceptable p levels were * (p < 0.05) and ** (p < 0.01). ALT-C Inhibits the Adhesion of Mouse Fibroblasts to Collagen I—It was previously reported by our group that ALT-C inhibits the adhesion of α2β1-transfected cells to collagen type I, with an IC50 of 100 nm (23Souza D.H. Iemma M.R. Ferreira L.L. Faria J.P. Oliva M.L. Zingali R.B. Niewiarowski S. Selistre-de-Araujo H.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 341-350Google Scholar). Here we show that the binding of mouse fibroblasts (NIH-3T3) to collagen I is also inhibited by ALT-C (Fig. 1). ALT-C inhibited collagen binding to fibroblasts with an IC50 of 2.2 μm. Inhibition was not 100% even in higher concentrations probably due to the presence of other collagen receptors in fibroblasts. These results suggest that the integrin α2β1 is involved in the adhesion of this cell type in the binding of collagen I. ALT-C Supports the Adhesion of Fibroblasts and Endothelial Cells—It was previously demonstrated that ALT-C supports the adhesion of α2β1-transfected K562 cells but not the control cells (23Souza D.H. Iemma M.R. Ferreira L.L. Faria J.P. Oliva M.L. Zingali R.B. Niewiarowski S. Selistre-de-Araujo H.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 341-350Google Scholar). Here we show that ALT-C also significantly supported the adhesion of fibroblasts and endothelial cells in a mass-dependent fashion (Fig. 2, A and B). Adhesion to collagen I was considered to be 100%. These results confirm the effect of ALT-C as an adhesion molecule. In agreement with these data, ALT-C was unable to detach cells that were previously adhered to collagen I (Fig. 3A). We have done a collagen concentration x adhesion curve for both fibroblasts and HUVECs, in which we could see that even collagen concentrations lower than 0.01 μg/well support cell adhesion (not shown). The collagen concentration that gives 50% of adhesion was 0.04 and 0.12 μg/well for HUVECs and fibroblasts, respectively. The adhesion of mouse fibroblasts to collagen I (0.12 μg/well) was not affected by incubation with ALT-C (1–4 μm) for 2 h (Fig. 3A). Comparable results were obtained for HUVECs (Fig. 3B); however, lower ALT-C concentrations must be used since HUVECs from primary culture are more sensitive than the fibroblast cell line used in this work. Only at the dose of 100 nm ALT-C induced a low but significant detachment (10%). Thus, ALT-C strongly favors cell adhesion and does not reproduce the anti-adhesive actions already described for some RGD-type disintegrins (33Yeh C.H. Peng H.C. Yih J.B. Huang T.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1425: 493-504Google Scholar, 34Della Morte R. Squillacioti C. Garbi C. Derkinderen P. Belisario M.A. Girault J.A. Di Natale P. Nitsch L. Staiano N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5047-5054Google Scholar). ALT-C Induces Endothelial Cell Proliferation—The ability to antagonize cell adhesion has been described as a main feature of anti-angiogenic disintegrins. Since the disintegrin-like ALT-C promoted endothelial cell adhesion, we further investigated its effects on endothelial proliferation. The stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation achieved when ALT-C was immobilized on plastic was proportional to the concentration of ALT-C coated to plastic surfaces (Fig. 4A). In the presence of 5% fetal calf serum, no significant variations were seen in the initial adhesion rates among the different conditions (adhesion measured after 2 h from seeding cells), including cells adhering on wells coated only with BSA. However, only in wells coated with ALT-C the number of cells increased after 72 h, and the increase was dependent on ALT-C concentration (Fig. 4A). HUVECs were also responsive to treatment with different concentrations (1–100 nm) of soluble ALT-C (Fig. 4B). The induction of proliferation observed when treating cells with 5 nm ALT-C was comparable to that observed with cultures treated with 10 ng/ml FGF-2 or 10 ng/ml VEGF, two potent angiogenic factors (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, concentrations of ALT-C greater then 10 nm significantly reduced this effect. ALT-C (10 and 100 nm) significantly inhibited the VEGF and FGF-2 effects, respectively (Fig. 4C). ALT-C did not induce proliferation of mouse fibroblasts in any of the doses and periods tested (Fig. 4D). Gene Expression Induced by ALT-C—In order to explain the effects of ALT-C on cell proliferation, we performed a gene expression assay using the GeneChip™ technology. When compared with human fibroblast growing on plastic, ALT-C induced a significant increase in several genes related to cell cycle control, including VEGF (Fig. 5) and other growth factors such as inducible early growth response (TGFβ), interleukin 11 (IL-11), early growth response 2 and 3 (EGR2 and 3), and insulin-induced gene (IIG1). A total of 45 genes were up-regulated and 30 genes were down-regulated with this experiment. The expression of VEGF may explain t"
https://openalex.org/W2069443682,"Signal transduction pathways that co-regulate a given biological process often are organized into networks by molecules that act as coincidence detectors. Phosphoinositides and the Rho-type GTPase Cdc42 regulate overlapping processes in all eukaryotic cells. However, the coincidence detectors that link these pathways into networks remain unknown. Here we show that the p21-activated protein kinase-related kinase Cla4 of yeast integrates signaling by Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P). We found that the Cla4 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain binds in vitro to several phosphoinositide species. To determine which phosphoinositides regulate Cla4 in vivo, we analyzed phosphatidylinositol kinase mutants (stt4, mss4, and pik1). This indicated that the plasma membrane pool of PI4P, but not phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate or the Golgi pool of PI4P, is required for localization of Cla4 to sites of polarized growth. A combination of the Cdc42-binding and PH domains of Cla4 was necessary and sufficient for localization to sites of polarized growth. Point mutations affecting either domain impaired the ability of Cla4 to regulate cell morphogenesis and the mitotic exit network (localization of Lte1). Therefore, Cla4 must retain the ability to bind both Cdc42 and phosphoinositides, the hallmark of a coincidence detector. PI4P may recruit Cla4 to the plasma membrane where Cdc42 activates its kinase activity and refines its localization to cortical sites of polarized growth. In mammalian cells, the myotonic dystrophy-related Cdc42-binding kinase possesses p21-binding and PH domains, suggesting that this kinase may be a coincidence detector of signaling by Cdc42 and phosphoinositides. Signal transduction pathways that co-regulate a given biological process often are organized into networks by molecules that act as coincidence detectors. Phosphoinositides and the Rho-type GTPase Cdc42 regulate overlapping processes in all eukaryotic cells. However, the coincidence detectors that link these pathways into networks remain unknown. Here we show that the p21-activated protein kinase-related kinase Cla4 of yeast integrates signaling by Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P). We found that the Cla4 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain binds in vitro to several phosphoinositide species.

In eukaryotes from yeast to humans, signaling by the Rho-type GTPase Cdc42 and phosphoinositides coordinately regulates overlapping sets of cell biological processes (reviewed in Refs. 1Martin T.F.

The type III PI 4-kinase Stt4 and the PI4P 5-kinase Mss4 are required for polarization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton and regulation of a protein kinase C-activated MAP kinase cascade (17Homma K.

The Golgi-localized type III PI 4-kinase Pik1 regulates trafficking through the Golgi apparatus (19Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol.

Yeast cells also express a type II PI 4-kinase (Lsb6) that localizes to the plasma membrane and vacuole (22Han G.S. Audhya A. Markley D.J. Emr S.D. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47709-47718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 23Shelton S.N. Barylko B. Binns D.D. Horazdovsky B.F. Albanesi J.P. Goodman J.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); however, the function of this enzyme is unknown. The PI 3-kinase encoded by VPS34 is required for protein sorting in the endocytic pathway (24Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Because Cdc42 and phosphoinositide signaling pathways co-regulate overlapping sets of biological processes, cells must integrate these pathways into networks. Signal integration could occur directly via multidomain proteins that are activated simultaneously by two or more signals (25Bourne H.R. Nicoll R. Cell. 1993; 72: 65-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 26Prehoda K.E. Lim W.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), thereby functioning as coincidence detectors. An example is N-WASp, which stimulates the nucleation of actin filament assembly by the Arp2/3 complex in mammalian cells (27Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). N-WASp is activated synergistically upon binding the Rho-type GTPase Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2 (27Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar)). The mechanisms that integrate Cdc42 and phosphoinositide signaling in yeast are unknown. However, several proteins have the potential to act directly as coincidence detectors of these two signaling pathways. One such protein is the PAK-related protein kinase Cla4. Cla4 possesses in its non-catalytic N-terminal region a Cdc42-binding domain (PBD) and a plekstrin homology (PH) domain (28Cvrckova F. De Virgilio C. Manser E. Pringle J.R. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1817-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), which potentially binds phosphoinositides. Other PH domain-containing proteins that interact with Cdc42 include Cdc24 (the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42 (29Zheng Y. Cerione R. Bender A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2369-2372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and the related proteins Boi1/2 (unknown function (30Bender L. Lo H.S. Lee H. Kokojan V. Peterson V. Bender A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 879-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)). Whether the PH domain of Cdc24 binds phosphoinositides is unknown. However, the PH domain of Boi1 does bind PI4,5P2 (31Hallett M.A. Lo H.S. Bender A. BMC Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Boi1 PH domain point mutants impaired in PI4,5P2 binding fail to function or localize to the bud cortex (31Hallett M.A. Lo H.S. Bender A. BMC Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Cdc42 scaffold protein Bem1 possesses a phox homology domain that binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P (32Yu J.W. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44179-44184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar)), which has a prominent role in protein trafficking to the vacuole (24Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). In contrast, other Cdc42-interacting proteins in yeast lack domains known to bind phosphoinositides. These proteins include Ste20 (a PAK homolog that possesses a PBD but lacks a PH domain (33Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar)), Gic1/2 (function unknown (34Chen G.C. Kim Y.J. Chan C.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2958-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)), Iqg1 (IQGAP homolog (35Osman M.A. Cerione R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)), Msb1 (function unknown (36Bender A. Pringle J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1295-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar)), and the Cdc42 GTPase-activating proteins Rga1, Rga2, and Bem3 (29Zheng Y. Cerione R. Bender A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2369-2372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Smith G.R. Givan S.A. Cullen P. Sprague Jr., G.F. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, relatively few yeast proteins apparently have the potential to function directly as coincidence detectors of Cdc42 and phosphoinositide signaling. Here we have determined whether the PAK-related kinase Cla4 functions as a coincidence detector of signaling by Cdc42 and phosphoinositides. By analyzing phosphoinositide binding to the Cla4 PH domain in vitro, Cla4 localization in phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinase mutants, and Cla4 function in vivo, we provide evidence indicating that Cla4 must bind both Cdc42 and PI4P, as expected for a coincidence detector of these two signaling pathways. Plasmid Construction—Enzymes used for recombinant DNA manipulations were purchased from commercial sources and used as recommended by the manufacturers. The complete CLA4 gene, including the promoter and 3′-untranslated region, was amplified using primers (forward 5′-CCACACCCCGGGGAGAAATCACCACTGGAAAC-3′ and reverse 5′-CCACACGGGCCCTAGAAGCTGAAGCATGGACG-3′), digested with ApaI and SmaI (sites underlined) to generate appropriate ends, and cloned into pRS314 or pRS315 (38Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pRS314Cla4 and pRS315Cla4. To tag the Cla4 protein at its C terminus with green fluorescent protein (GFP), we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate a unique NheI site just prior to the CLA4 stop codon of pRS314Cla4 into which the GFP coding region flanked by NheI sites was inserted, resulting in pRS314Cla4-GFP. Prior studies have shown that this C-terminal fusion is fully functional (39Holly S.P. Blumer K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 845-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To generate GFP-tagged Cla4 truncation mutants, we used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce NheI sites at desired locations in the CLA4 gene on pRS314Cla4. The GFP coding region flanked by NheI sites then was inserted into the NheI site of the engineered CLA4 gene cassette. In so doing we created the following pRS314Cla4-GFP derivatives: Cla4-(1–246)-GFP (GFP inserted after amino acid 246) and Cla4-(1–527)-GFP (GFP inserted after amino acid 527). In-frame internal deletion mutations in CLA4 were generated by using site-directed mutagenesis to introduce two NheI sites into pRS314Cla4 at locations flanking the regions of Cla4 to be deleted. Following NheI digestion, purification, and ligation of the cleaved plasmid, we generated mutants lacking sequences encoding the PH domain or Cdc42-binding domain (PBD). To generate GFP-tagged forms of these internal Cla4 deletion mutants, we replaced most of the CLA4 coding region of pRS314Cla4-GFP (contained on a XhoI fragment) with XhoI fragments from the PH or PBD deletion mutant plasmids. Amino acid substitutions within the phosphoinositide- and Cdc42-binding surfaces of the PH domain and PBD of Cla4 were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (K71N, K96N, and K99N in the PH domain or H192L and H195L in the PBD). The entire coding and promoter regions of all cloning and mutagenesis products were sequenced. GFP fusions to the PH domain or PBD of Cla4 were constructed as follows. The parent plasmid was pUG36, a single copy vector in which the MET25 promoter drives expression of EGFP. Sequences encoding the Cla4 PH domain (amino acids 62–181) were amplified as a fragment flanked by HindIII and XhoI sites and cloned into pUG36 cleaved with HindIII and XhoI. A second Cla4 PH domain (flanked with HindIII sites and lacking a C-terminal stop codon) was then inserted into pUG36-Cla4PH at the HindIII site. The stop codon between the two PH domains was eliminated by site-directed mutagenesis so that the resultant plasmid pUG36-GFP-2XCla4PH expressed a GFP fusion linked to two tandem copies of the Cla4 PH domain. A similar procedure was used to generate a plasmid (pUG36–2XPLCδPH) that expressed GFP fused to two tandem copies of the PH domain of human PLCδ (residues 1–175 (40Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) in which the two PH domain-encoding sequences were flanked by HindIII/XhoI and HindIII sites. To generate a TRP1-marked plasmid expressing the GFP-PLC-PH domain fusion, we subcloned a SacI/KpnI fragment from pUG36–2XPLCδPH into pRS314. The Cla4 PBD (amino acid residues 184–242) was cloned into pUG36 at the ClaI site. Similar methods were used to generate a construct containing two PBDs fused to GFP. To create a plasmid expressing GFP fused to both the PH and PBD of Cla4, we amplified sequences encoding residues 62–242 of Cla4 flanked by two ClaI sites and inserted this fragment in the ClaI site of pUG36, yielding pUG36-Cla4PHPBD. Site-directed mutagenesis of the above-noted plasmids was used to generate mutant forms of the Cla4 PH domain defective in phosphoinositide binding (K71N, K96N, and K99N). GST fusion proteins containing the Cla4 or PLCδ PH domain were generated using the pGEX-3X (Amersham Biosciences) vector. The Cla4 PH domain (amino acids 62–181) and the human PLCδ PH domain (amino acids 1–175) were amplified flanked by appropriate restriction sites and inserted into pGEX-3X at the EcoRI site or BamHI/EcoRI sites, respectively. For expression of the untagged Cla4 PH domain, the Cla4 PH domain-encoding sequence was amplified with NdeI/BglII ends and cloned into the pET11a vector (Stratagene) digested with NdeI/BamHI. Escherichia coli and Yeast Strains—E. coli strains (Stratagene) used were DH5α, XL1-Blue for mutagenesis experiments, and BL21DE3 cells for GST fusion protein expression. All Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table I. The yeast strains generated in this study were derivatives of W303. A 3X-GFP-TRP1 cassette was integrated in W303 at the LTE1 locus using pBJ1368 linearized with EcoRV as described (41Castillon G.A. Adames N.R. Rosello C.H. Seidel H.S. Longtine M.S. Cooper J.A.

Clones selected on media lacking tryptophan were screened by microscopy for cortical GFP fluorescence. The genes encoding CLA4 and SWE1 were disrupted with PCR-generated kanamycin and hygromycin resistance gene cassettes, respectively. Disruptions were confirmed by PCR of yeast genomic DNA and by evaluation of bud morphology.Table IStrains used in this studyStrainGenotypeRef./sourceSWY518MATa ade2-1::ADE2 ura3-1 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 his3-11, 15 can1-10039Holly S.P.

Briefly, fresh BL21DE3 transformants expressing GST, GST-Cla4PH, or GST-PLCδPH were grown overnight in a 2-ml LB-amp culture. One liter of LB-amp was inoculated and grown to an A600 of 0.6–0.8. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm to induce fusion protein expression, and the cultures were grown for 16 h at 25 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 20 min at 1000 × g. Pellets were suspended in 25 ml of ice-cold Buffer A (50 mm Hepes, 0.5 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors. Cells were lysed by one round of freeze-thawing in the presence of 2 mm dithiothreitol, treated with lysozyme and Triton X-100 (0.5% final concentration), and incubated on ice for 2–4 h. Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant fraction was filtered before overnight incubation with 2 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The supernatant/glutathione-agarose mixture was poured into a column and washed with Buffer B (20 mm Hepes, 25 mm NaCl, 2% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) with and then without Triton X-100. GST fusion proteins were eluted with buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm glutathione, pH 8), and fractions were collected. Relevant fractions were identified by measuring protein concentrations, which were pooled and dialyzed overnight. GST fusion proteins were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C in glycerol-containing buffer. Protein-lipid overlays were performed as described previously (42Dowler S. Currie R.A. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, nitrocellulose membranes spotted with 100 pmol of various purified phospholipids (Echelon, Inc.) were incubated in blocking buffer (TBST (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween containing 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma)) for at least 1 h prior to addition of GST fusion proteins. Recombinant GST, GST-Cla4PH, or GST-PLCδPH (0.5 μg/ml) was added to the blocking buffer, and blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Blots were washed with TBST (6 times over 30 min) and incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody to GST for 2 h at room temperature (1:10,000 dilution in TBST). After blots were washed, they were incubated with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution in TBST; ICN Biomedicals, Inc.). Protein binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed as described (32Yu J.W. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44179-44184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles lacking or containing 3% (mol/mol) PI3P, PI4P, PI4,5P2, or PI3,5P2 were prepared and immobilized onto an L1 sensor chip using a Biacore X instrument. For purified GST-PH fusion proteins tested, protein concentration was determined by comparison with bovine serum albumin standards on SDS-PAGE, and for the binding analysis of purified untagged PH domains, protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm. Microscopy—To localize GFP-tagged proteins expressed in yeast, we transformed relevant yeast strains with plasmids expressing GFP-tagged proteins of interest or fused GFP to the protein of interest expressed from the chromosome. Plasmid-containing cells were grown overnight in 2 ml of selective media, diluted the next day, and grown to early log phase. For experiments using temperature-sensitive PI kinase mutants, a portion of the culture was shifted from permissive (26 °C) to non-permissive (37 °C) temperature. After incubation for 1–2 h, cells were collected by brief centrifugation and visualized by fluorescence microscopy with a temperature-controlled microscope as described below. For studies involving yeast strains expressing mutant forms of the Stt4 or Mss4 PI kinases, we grew wild type and mutant strains in media containing 1 m sorbitol to provide osmotic support and prevent cell lysis as described previously (19Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 43Stefan C.J. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 542-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Fluorescence images of live cells were collected using a cooled CCD camera (DAGE) mounted on a temperature-controlled Olympus IX 70 inverted microscope equipped with a UPlanApo 100× objective. Images were acquired and analyzed with NIH Image 1.62. Immunoblotting—Yeast cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells with NaOH (44Yaffe M.P. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4819-4823Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked, probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against GFP (1:2000 dilution (45Seedorf M. Damelin M. Kahana J. Taura T. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1547-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar)) and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.), and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). To determine how Cdc42 and phosphoinositide signaling in yeast is integrated into networks that co-regulate specific cell biological processes, we focused on Cla4, a PAK-related protein kinase that is a direct effector of Cdc42 (Fig. 1A). The rationale for doing so was severalfold. In contrast to other proteins such as Boi1 that bind Cdc42 by poorly understood mechanisms, Cla4 uses its conserved PBD to bind Cdc42 (46Benton B.K.

Furthermore, Cla4 probably binds Cdc42 by a mechanism highly similar to that used by mammalian PAK1 because the residues in PAK1 that bind Cdc42 are conserved in Cla4 (Fig. 1B) (47Morreale A.

Likewise, structural studies of PH domain-containing proteins have identified sequence features directly involved in binding the phosphoinositide head group (48Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Several of these residues are conserved in the Cla4 PH domain (Fig. 1C), although it is unknown whether the Cla4 PH domain binds phosphoinositides. Finally, phosphoinositide kinase mutants are available to determine whether Cla4 is regulated by phosphoinositide production (17Homma K. Terui S. Minemura M. Qadota H. Anraku Y. Kanaho Y. Ohya Y. J.

The PH Domain of Cla4 Binds Phosphoinositides in Vitro—We determined initially whether the Cla4 PH domain binds phosphoinositides in vitro by performing protein-lipid overlay assays and surface plasmon resonance experiments. For protein-lipid overlay assays, we incubated nitrocellulose membranes containing spots of pure phosphoinositides or other lipids with purified GST fusion proteins containing the PH domain of Cla4 or the PH domain of PLCδ as a positive control. Membranes were washed and probed with an anti-GST antibody to detect binding of GST-tagged PH domains. The results indicated that the GST-Cla4 PH fusion protein binds most strongly to the monophosphorylated phosphoinositides PI3P, PI4P, and PI5P, and to PI3,5P2 (Fig. 2A). The Cla4 PH domain bound less strongly to several other lipids including PI4,5P2. At an equivalent concentration, a GST fusion containing the PLCδ PH domain bound strongly to PI4,5P2 and weakly to other lipids (Fig. 2A), confirming the specificity of this PH domain (49Lemmon M. Ferguson K. O'Brien R. Sigler P. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). GST without a PH domain did not bind (data not shown). Therefore, the PH domain of Cla4 is similar to many PH domains that bind in vitro to several phosphoinositide species (50Kavran J.M. Klein D.E.

To complement qualitative measures of phosphoinositide-PH domain interaction determined by lipid overlay assays, we performed quantitative surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments to determine the affinity of the Cla4 PH domain for various phosphoinositides. These experiments used dioleoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles containing 3% (mol/mol) PI3P, PI4P, PI3,5P2, or PI4,5P2 immobilized on sensor chips. Responses of sensor chips were recorded following exposure to various concentrations of the purified His-tagged Cla4 PH domain. The resultant dose-response curves indicated that the Cla4 PH domain binds with highest affinity to PI4,5P2 (Kd = 20 μm) and PI3,5P2 (Kd = 21 μm) (Fig. 2B). By comparison, the PLCδ PH domain was found to bind PI4,5P2 with a Kd of 1.7 μm (data not shown). We also found that the Cla4 PH domain binds PI3P or PI4P with lower affinity (Kd > 100 μm; Fig. 2B).

https://openalex.org/W2134863443,"Nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB p50 protein is involved in promoting survival in hippocampal neurons after trimethyltin (TMT)-injury. In the current study, hippocampal NF-kappaB activity was examined and quantitated from transgenic kappaB-lacZ reporter mice after chemical-induced injury. NF-kappaB activity was localized primarily to hippocampal neurons and significantly elevated over that in saline-treated mice between 4 and 21 days after TMT injection. Seven days after TMT injection, a timepoint of elevated NF-kappaB activity, gene expression in the hippocampus was studied by microarray analysis through comparison of expression profiles between treated nontransgenic and p50-null mice with their saline-injected controls. Seventeen genes increased in nontransgenic TMT-treated mice relative to saline-treated as well as showing no increase in p50-null mice, indicating a role for p50 in their regulation. One of these genes, the Na+, K+-ATPase-gamma subunit, was detected in brain for the first time. Several of the genes modulated by NF-kappaB are potentially related to neuroplasticity, providing additional evidence that this transcription factor is a neuroprotective signal in the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2151849130,"Interleukin-2 tyrosine kinase, Itk, is an important member of the Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases that play a central role in signaling through antigen receptors such as the T-cell receptor, B-cell receptor, and Fcϵ. Selective inhibition of Itk may be an important way of modulating many diseases involving heightened or inappropriate activation of the immune system. In addition to an unliganded nonphophorylated Itk catalytic kinase domain, we determined the crystal structures of the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated kinase domain bound to staurosporine, a potent broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor. These structures are useful for the design of novel, highly potent and selective Itk inhibitors and provide insight into the influence of inhibitor binding and phosphorylation on the conformation of Itk. Interleukin-2 tyrosine kinase, Itk, is an important member of the Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases that play a central role in signaling through antigen receptors such as the T-cell receptor, B-cell receptor, and Fcϵ.

These structures are useful for the design of novel, highly potent and selective Itk inhibitors and provide insight into the influence of inhibitor binding and phosphorylation on the conformation of Itk. The Tec kinases are a family of five non-receptor tyrosine kinases that play a central role in signaling through antigen-receptors such as the T-cell receptor (TCR), 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T-cell receptor; IL, interleukin; SH domain, Src homology domain; PH domain, pleckstrin homology domain; TH domain, Tec homology domain; Tec, tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; r.m.s., root mean square. 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T-cell receptor; IL, interleukin; SH domain, Src homology domain; PH domain, pleckstrin homology domain; TH domain, Tec homology domain; Tec, tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; r.m.s., root mean square. B-cell receptor, and Fcϵ (1Miller A.T. Berg L.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 331-340Google Scholar) and are essential for T-cell activation. Three members of the family, Itk, Rlk, and Tec, are activated downstream of antigen receptor engagement in T-cells and transmit signals to downstream effectors, including PLC-γ. A fourth member, Btk, appears to act independently of T-cell signaling and is essential for B-cell development and activation. Btk-deficient murine mast cells have reduced degranulation and decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines following FcϵRI cross-linking (2Kawakami Y. Kitaura J. Hata D. Yao L. Kawakami T.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 286-290Google Scholar). Btk deletion in mice has a profound effect on B-cell proliferation induced by anti-IgM and inhibits immune responses to thymus-independent type II antigens (3Ellmeier W. Jung S. Sunshine M.J. Hatam F. Xu Y. Baltimore D. Mano H. Littman D.R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1611-1623Google Scholar, 4Mukhopadhyay S. Mohanty M. Mangla A. George A. Bal V. Rath S. Ravindran B. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2914-2921Google Scholar). A biological role for the final member of this family, Bmx, has not been identified. Itk is a key member of this family, and a number of factors point to the importance of this kinase in immune disease. Deletion of Itk in mice results in reduced TCR-induced proliferation and secretion of the cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and interferon-γ (5Schaeffer E.M. Debnath J. Yap G. McVicar D. Liao X.C.

Also, the immunological symptoms of allergic asthma are attenuated in Itk-/- mice, and lung inflammation, eosinophil infiltration, and mucous production are drastically reduced in response to challenge with the allergen OVA (8Mueller C. August A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5056-5063Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Itk gene is reported to be more highly expressed in peripheral blood T-cells from patients with moderate or severe atopic dermatitis than in controls or patients with mild atopic dermatitis (9Matsumoto Y. Oshida T. Obayashi I. Imai Y. Matsui K. Yoshida N.L. Nagata N. Ogawa K. Obayashi M. Kashiwabara T. Gunji S. Nagasu T. Sugita Y. Tanaka T. Tsujimoto G. Katsunuma T. Akasawa A. Saito H. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2002; 129: 327-340Google Scholar). In certain cell types, the role of Itk may be intricately linked with other members of the family. For example, in mast cells, Btk and Itk are both expressed and activated by FcϵRI cross-linking (10Kawakami Y. Yao L. Tashiro M. Gibson S. Mills G.B. Kawakami T.J. Immunology. 1995; 155: 3556-3562Google Scholar). Splenocytes from Rlk-/- mice secrete half the IL-2 produced by wild type animals in response to TCR engagement (5Schaeffer E.M. Debnath J. Yap G. McVicar D. Liao X.C. Littman D.R. Sher A. Varmus H.E. Lenardo M.J. Schwartzberg P.L. Science. 1999; 284: 638-641Google Scholar), whereas the combined deletion of Itk and Rlk in mice leads to a profound inhibition of TCR-induced responses, including proliferation and production of the cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and interferon-γ (5Schaeffer E.M. Debnath J. Yap G. McVicar D. Liao X.C. Littman D.R. Sher A. Varmus H.E. Lenardo M.J. Schwartzberg P.L. Science. 1999; 284: 638-641Google Scholar, 7Schaeffer E.M. Yap G.S. Lewis C.M. Czar M.J. McVicar D.W. Cheever A.W. Sher A. Schwartzberg P.L. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1183-1188Google Scholar). Furthermore, intracellular signaling following TCR engagement is affected in Itk/Rlk-deficient T-cells, where inositol triphosphate production, calcium mobilization, mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, and activation of the transcription factors NFAT and AP-1 are all reduced (5Schaeffer E.M. Debnath J. Yap G. McVicar D. Liao X.C. Littman D.R. Sher A. Varmus H.E. Lenardo M.J. Schwartzberg P.L. Science. 1999; 284: 638-641Google Scholar, 7Schaeffer E.M. Yap G.S. Lewis C.M. Czar M.J. McVicar D.W. Cheever A.W. Sher A. Schwartzberg P.L. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1183-1188Google Scholar). Together, these studies have defined an important role for Itk in TCR signaling leading to thymic development, cytokine gene expression, and activation-induced cell death. However, modulation of immunological disease with small molecule Itk inhibitors will require that they are both potent and selective within the Tec family and against other kinases. Thus, crystal structures of Itk provide essential information for researchers seeking to exploit the potential of Itk inhibition, and the work described herein represents a major step forward in this quest. To date, the only other member of the Tec family of tyrosine kinases for which a crystal structure of the catalytic domain is available is an inactive form of murine Btk (11Mao C. Zhou M. Uckun F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41435-41443Google Scholar). Itk shares a similar subunit structure with the other members of the Tec family, being composed of SH2, SH3, and catalytic kinase domains. The SH2 and SH3 domains may have important modular functions in the targeting signaling molecules to specific locations and regulation of intramolecular interactions (12Pawson T. Nash P. Science. 2003; 300: 445-452Google Scholar, 13Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the homologous Src and Abl/Arg protein tyrosine kinase families, which contain N-terminal lipid modulation signals, Itk contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that acts as a membrane-targeting unit (14Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Google Scholar). Additionally, the region between this PH and the SH3 domain is unique to Tec kinases and has been called the Tec homology (TH) region (15Vihinen M. Nilsson L. Smith C.I. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 263-265Google Scholar). Deletion of the SH3 and TH regions has been shown to affect the catalytic efficiency of the kinase but not the ATP binding affinity (16Hawkins J. Marcy A. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 22: 211-219Google Scholar) (See Fig. 1). Here we report the crystal structures of the unphosphorylated and the phosphorylated kinase domains of Itk in complex with staurosporine at high resolution. For comparison, we have also determined the crystal structure of the unliganded and unphosphorylated form of the Itk kinase domain. Expression, Purification, and Enzymatic Characterization—A truncated version of the Itk kinase domain (residues 357–620) was inserted into the bacterial/baculoviral expression vector pBEV10, 2Chambers, S. P., Austen, D. A., Fulghum, J. R., and Kim, W. (2004) Protein Expression Purif., in press. incorporating an N-terminal hexahistidine purification tag and thrombin cleavage site. The enzyme was overexpressed in baculovirus expression system using Hi5 insect cells. Itk was purified using nickel/nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose metal affinity chromatography (Novagen), and the hexahistidine tag was then removed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 22 units of mg-1 thrombin (Sigma). Subsequent purification by size exclusion on a Superdex 200(26/60) column (Amersham Biosciences) yielded a homogeneous, unphosphorylated sample suitable for crystallization. Activation of this purified Itk protein was performed by incubating a small protein sample with 1:100 (w/w) Lck:Itk overnight at 4 °C in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm ATP. Separation of the phosphorylated Itk protein from unphosphorylated protein was achieved by a ResourceQ column purification step. Phosphorylation of Itk by Lck was confirmed by Western blotting using a monoclonal phosphotyrosine antibody from Cell Signaling (P.N.9411). The phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Itk protein samples were desalted on a Hiload desalting (16/60) column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris, pH 8.6, containing 50 mm NaCl and 2 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C and concentrated to 10 mg/ml for crystallization. Dynamic light scattering (data not shown) was used to determine the most suitable protein buffer for crystallographic studies. Radiometric kinase assays were performed for the Itk enzyme used in crystallography (residues 357–620) and an Itk enzyme containing the catalytic kinase domain and the TH and SH2 domains (residues 113–620). The assay buffer consisted of 10 mm MOPS (pH 8), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Tween 20, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Assays were carried out in a total volume of 100 μl at 25 °C in the presence of 60 nm Itk, 5 μm SAM68 peptide substrate (Src-associated in mitosis 68-kDa protein (31Di Fruscio M. Chen T. Richard S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2710-2715Google Scholar), residues 332–443), 2 μl of staurosporine Me2SO solution, and 150 μm [γ-33P]ATP (200 μCi of [33P]ATP/μmol ATP (Amersham Biosciences)). Kinetic parameters were calculated from nonlinear regression. ATP Km determinations were performed in the above conditions over the [γ-33P]ATP concentration range of 0 to 250 μm. Mass Spectrometry and Phosphorylation Site Identification—All proteins used in crystallization studies were characterized using mass spectrometry. Protein mass determination was performed on a Micromass Quattro II mass spectrometer with an HP1100 HPLC system. 5 μg of protein was loaded onto a Phenomenex C4 reversed phase column and eluted into the mass spectrometer in 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile. The system was standardized against horse heart myoglobin, and mass determination was performed using MassLynx software. The mass of the basal Itk protein was determined to be 30,598.5 ± 3.4 daltons, compared with an expected mass of 30,598.1 daltons for the thrombin cleaved enzyme. The mass of the Lck-activated Itk protein was determined to be 30,678.3 ± 2.2 daltons, indicating the presence of one phosphorylation. The unphosphorylated and phosphorylated enzymes were then digested with modified trypsin (Promega) and subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry on an Applied Biosystems QSTAR quadropole time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled to an LC Packings (Dionex) HPLC system using the Analyst and MASCOT (Matrix Science) software. The resulting tandem mass spectrometry data showed good coverage of the protein with the peptide FVLDDQYTSSTGTK phosphorylated on the tyrosine in the Lck-activated Itk protein only. This identified phosphopeptide corresponds to residues 506–519 in Itk. Manual interpretation of the data as well as automatic determination using the MASCOT software confirms the presence of the phosphate on tyrosine 512. Crystallization—Crystals of phosphorylated Itk (residues 357–620) were grown in the presence of 0.5 mm staurosporine by hanging-drop vapor diffusion from a solution of 0.8 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.7, 0.2 m magnesium acetate, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Plate-like crystals formed after about 5 days at 20 °C, growing to a maximum size of 150 × 150 × 5 μm in 2 weeks. Crystals of the unphosphorylated Itk-staurosporine complex were obtained in the same conditions and grew with the same morphology. Crystals of apounphosphosphorylated Itk (residues 357–620) were grown by hangingdrop vapor diffusion from a solution of 6% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, and 0.1 m MES, pH 5.7. For data collection at 100 K, crystals were equilibriated for 20 s in a solution of mother liquor containing 30% glycerol as cryoprotectant. Data Collection and Refinement—Data for the frozen Itk-staurosporine crystals were collected at beamline 14.1 (Synchrotron Radiation Source, CCLRC Daresbury Laboratory, Daresbury, Warrington, UK) using an ADSC Q4 CCD detector and nitrogen cryostream. Data for the frozen apo-Itk crystals were collected “in-house” using CuKα radiation. All data were reduced using MOSFLM (32Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1696-1702Google Scholar) and CCP4 (33Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar) using a simplified homology model based on the known crystal structure of Btk and data between 15 and 3.5Å. Two molecules/asymmetric unit were identified with an R-factor of 47.0% (correlation coefficient of 27.1). The unphosphorylated staurosporine complex and the apo, unphosphorylated structures were subsequently solved using the phosphorylated form as starting model. All initial structures were subjected to multiple rounds of molecular dynamics refinement in CNX (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA ©2000) and manual rebuilding in Turbo-Frodo (35Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory.Vol. 81. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991: 86Google Scholar) and Quanta (Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA, ©1998, 2000). During structure refinement noncrystallographic symmetry restraints for positional parameters and B-factors were applied with weights of 400 and 5 σ (B) in crystallography NMR software, respectively. The bound staurosporine molecule could be seen clearly in the active sites (see Fig. 2). Coordinates—Refined x-ray coordinates for the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated staurosporine complex structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank data base with accession codes 1ITK and 2ITK. The unphosphorylated apo-Itk structure has also been deposited with accession code 3ITK. Overall Structure of Itk Kinase Domain—The phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Itk kinase domains (residues 357–620) crystallized with staurosporine in similar conditions and formed crystals of similar morphology. The unliganded Itk enzyme crystallizes in a different space group. The structure of the phosphorylated form was solved by molecular replacement using a homology model based on the known crystal structure of Btk (Protein Data Bank entry 1K2P). The unphosphorylated staurosporine complex and apo forms were subsequently solved using the phosphorylated form as the starting model. In the three crystal structures, the electron density for residues 502–521, which corresponds to the activation loop and incorporates the activating trans-phosphorylation site Tyr512, is absent because of disorder. The crystal structures of Itk have a fold typical of protein kinases (17Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Google Scholar, 18Sicheri F. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 777-785Google Scholar), comprising a small N-terminal lobe (residues 357–437) connected to the large C-terminal lobe (residues 438–620) via a flexible hinge region (see Fig. 1). This hinge region is located in the cleft between the two lobes and forms part of the catalytic active site in which staurosporine binds. The N-terminal lobe is a five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet with a single α-helix connecting two of the strands. The C-terminal lobe is mainly α-helical and contains the substrate-binding site located in a groove on its surface. The overall topology of the Itk kinase domain is most similar to Src family kinases such as Lck (13Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Google Scholar, 19Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Google Scholar) and distinct from serine/threonine kinases such as Cdk2 (20Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Lawrie A.M. Morris M.C. Tunnah P. Divita G. Johnson L.N. Endicott J.A. J..Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8746-8756Google Scholar) and Aurora-2 (21Cheetham G.M. Knegtel R.M. Coll J.T. Renwick S.B. Swenson L. Weber P. Lippke J.A. Austen D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42419-42422Google Scholar). For residues located in the catalytic kinase domain of phosphorylated Itk, the r.m.s. deviations for all main chain atoms with Src and Lck are 2.23 and 1.88 Å as compared with 8.97 and 6.68 Å for Cdk2 and Aurora-2, respectively The phosphorylated and unphosphorylated inhibitor-bound Itk structures can be readily superimposed with an r.m.s. deviation for 245 C-α atoms of 0.37 Å. In both structures, the αC-helix is completely ordered, placing the catalytically important residues Glu406, Lys391, and Asp500 in an orientation that resembles the active form of a protein kinase (by reference to the structure of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (22Narayana N. Cox S. Shaltiel S. Taylor S.S. Xuong N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4438-4448Google Scholar)). The unliganded and unphosphorylated structure of murine Btk (11Mao C. Zhou M. Uckun F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41435-41443Google Scholar) resembles the liganded structure of Itk in both the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms (r.m.s. deviation for 243 C-α atoms of 1.4 and 1.5 Å, respectively). However, there are a number of important differences in the N-terminal kinase lobe of Itk, which are confined to two regions, the αC-helix and its preceding loop (residues 393–413) and also the glycine-rich loop (residues 362–378). These two loop regions are adjacent to each other in the Itk structure and determine the overall size and shape of the ATP-binding pocket. Most importantly, the glycine-rich loop in Itk assumes a more open and extended conformation, reminiscent of an active kinase. In contrast, this loop is collapsed into the active site of Btk in what appears to be an inactive conformation (Fig. 2). Also, in Itk, the αC-helix and preceding loop have rotated around residues Lys391 and Met410 by an angle of 12° vertically and 11° horizontally relative to the corresponding region in the Btk structure. In this way, the C-helix and residue Glu406 in Itk are moved closer to the bound inhibitor and the other catalytically important residues, Lys391 and Asp500. This active conformation of the αC-helix and adjacent loop region in Itk is stabilized by significant hydrophobic interactions established at three positions in the active site. First, residue Met398 stacks against the aromatic ring of Phe374, constraining the arrangement of the αC-helix and glycine-rich loop. Phe403 and Met410 make further hydrophobic interactions, packing closely with Ile431, Leu433, and Phe435. Together, Met398, Phe403, Ala407, Met410, and Met411 (from the αC-helix), Phe374 (from the Gly-rich loop), and Val424, Leu433, and Lys391 define an extensive hydrophobic pocket lying adjacent to the Itk active site. The size and shape of this pocket are different in the Src Tyr kinase family as well as the Ser/Thr kinases such as Cdk2. Although residues Met398, Phe403, and Met410 are conserved in Itk and Btk, Phe435 is unique to Itk (see Table II). This residue is therefore identified as a gatekeeper or blocker of this hydrophobic pocket and might thereby play a critical role in a quest for selective inhibitors of Itk over Btk as well as other kinase families (Figs. 2 and 3).Table IISequence comparison of active site residues in the TEC family kinases For comparison, residues in and around the bound ATP-binding site of Itk have been grouped according to how they interact with ATP, by references to other protein kinase structures. Therefore, residues that are essential in creating the binding pocket for adenosine, the ribose moiety, and the first and second (TP2) phosphate groups of ATP are differentiated. Similarly, residues that create the p-fluorophenyl binding pocket, first observed in the MAP kinase family (30Wilson K.P. McCaffrey P.G. Hsiao K. Pazhanisamy S. Galullo V. Bemis G.W. Fitzgibbon M.J. Caron P.R. Murcko M.A. Su M.S. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 423-431Google Scholar), are indicated by FP. The interaction of these residues with staurosporine can be seen in Figs. 2 and 3. The conserved kinase catalytic residue is indicated in blue, an unusual cysteine residue in magenta, and the specificity-determining gatekeeper residue, Phe435, in red. Targeting new interactions between an inhibitor and residue Cys442 may be a way to improve selectivity for the TEC-family kinases over homologous kinases such as Lck and Src, which have serine residues at this position. Residue numbering corresponds to Itk. Open table in a new tab The ability of protein kinases to alternate between catalytically active and inactive states in response to specific signals underlies their use as molecular switches. The N- and C-terminal lobes have been seen to alter their relative orientations in a number of different kinase structures, with a closed conformation being associated with the active form of the kinase as it correctly positions the γ-phosphate group of ATP with respect to the substrate. Inactive forms of protein kinases have been observed in various open configurations in which the two lobes of the catalytic domain are further apart. Itk is phosphorylated at the membrane on residue Tyr512 in the activation loop segment of the catalytic subunit by Src family kinases (23Mahajan S. Fargnoli J. Burkhardt A.L. Kut S.A. Saouaf S.J. Bolen J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5304-5311Google Scholar, 24Backesjo C.M. Vargas L. Superti-Furga G. Smith C.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 510-515Google Scholar). The unphosphorylated and phosphorylated-staurosporine structures of Itk superimpose closely on the unphosphorylated apo structure (r.m.s of 1.1 Å for 245 Cα atoms) with no reorientation of the N- and C-terminal lobes, indicating that large scale conformational changes within the kinase domain are not induced by phosphorylation on Tyr512. Interactions in the ATP-binding Site of Itk—The active site of Itk is bounded by the glycine-rich loop, which contains the consensus kinase sequence Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly (residues 370–375), and the hinge region (residues 435–442). Staurosporine binds to the Itk kinase domain at the interface of the N- and C-terminal lobes via hydrophobic interactions with Ile369, Val377, and Ala389 (N-terminal lobe), Phe435 and Tyr437 (hinge region), and Leu489 and Cys442 (C-terminal lobe), all of which line the active site. Upon ligand binding, the gatekeeper residue, Phe435, makes a beneficial edge-face interaction with the conjugated ring system of staurosporine. In addition, the lactam group mimics the interactions of the adenine base in ATP with the hinge region of the protein backbone, where two conserved hydrogen bonds are formed between the lactam-nitrogen N-19 in staurosporine and the carboxyl group of Glu436 and the lactam-oxygen O-30 with the backbone amine group of Met438 (see Fig. 2). An additional hydrogen bond is mimicked in the staurosporine sugar moiety, where the methylamino group contacts the backbone carbonyl of Arg486. Unlike the PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase)-staurosporine complex (25Prade L. Engh R.A. Girod A. Kinzel V. Huber R. Bossemeyer D. Structure. 1997; 5: 1627-1637Google Scholar), there is no hydrogen bond between this methylamino group and the Oδ2 of Glu127 (PKA numbering) because this is a cysteine (Cys442) in ITK. The extent of these interactions is reflected in the potency of staurosporine for the isolated kinase domain (Ki ≤ 10 nm) (see “Materials and Methods”). In the unliganded Itk structure, the αC-helix and residue Phe435 are more disordered than in the complexed structures (as judged by refined atomic B-factors and electron density maps). Thus the formation of the staurosporine complex is sufficient to complete a transition to an ordered conformation of the kinase domain. Furthermore, the similar active conformations of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated staurosporine complexes appears to be independent of crystal packing artifacts as the uncomplexed Itk enzyme crystallizes in a different space group. Staurosporine-induced conformational changes of protein kinases, including considerable induced-fit rearrangement with the inhibitor and opening or closing of the active site have been observed previously (25Prade L. Engh R.A. Girod A. Kinzel V. Huber R. Bossemeyer D. Structure. 1997; 5: 1627-1637Google Scholar). Activating Role of Tyr512 Phosphorylation in Itk—For several protein kinases including Irk, calmodulin-dependent kinase, protein kinase II, myosin light chain kinase, and protein kinase C, a pseudo-substrate sequence within the activation loop has been observed to block access to the substrate-binding pocket of the catalytic cleft. Phosphorylation of the activation loop is thus required to remove this pseudo-substrate sequence and promote the active kinase conformation. In Itk, the ATP-binding site is not occluded by the activation loop, and therefore phosphorylation of residue Tyr512 appears to have no role to play in a self-inhibitory mechanism. In reporting the inactive crystal structure of murine Btk, the authors speculated upon an activation mechanism that is triggered upon phosphorylation of the equivalent activation loop tyrosine, Tyr551. This proposal suggested that in the unphosphorylated state of Btk, Arg544 binds to Glu445. Upon activation by a Src family kinase this interaction is released, so that Arg544 now binds to the phosphorylated Tyr551 and brings about a large conformational change involving the αC-helix. This conformational movement enables Glu445 to bind to the catalytic Lys430 in a movement that primes the nucleotide-binding pocket for ATP binding. Hence, phosphorylation on Tyr551 would have the effect of both preventing the engagement of Glu445 in the catalytic center and stabilizing a new conformation of the αC-helix. This mechanism is similar to that proposed by Yamaguchi and Hendrickson (19Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Google Scholar) for the activation of Lck (Protein Data Bank code 3lck) where phosphorylation of Tyr394 causes a switch in the orientation of Arg363, resulting in a restructuring of the activation segment, which then no longer impedes the inward movement of the C-helix. In contrast with these activation mechanisms, our results demonstrate that no similar conformational changes are triggered in Itk upon inhibitor binding to the ATP-binding pocket of the unphosphorylated apo-enzyme. Moreover, no subsequent conformational movements occur upon phosphorylation of the ligand bound form. This suggests that Tyr512 is not essential in the preparatory activation steps, because the architecture of the ATP- and substrate-binding sites are already compatible with ATP (or inhibitor) binding. This surprising result brings into question the activating role of phosphorylation of Tyr512 in Itk. Like all Tec family members, Itk possesses both SH2 and SH3 domains. In addition, Itk has a PH and a TH domain within which are a GTPase-activating protein homology region and a proline-rich region. It is possible that one or more of these might have an influence in the formation of the substrate binding site and reorganization around the phospho-tyrosine site. To explore the role of these noncatalytic domains we have determined that the Kcat of Itk is reduced by 26-fold upon deletion of the SH2, SH3, and TH domains, whereas the affinity (Km) for ATP and Ki for staurosporine remain relatively unchanged (see “Materials and Methods”). This is consistent with complete activation of Itk in primary T-cells requiring autophosphorylation at residue Tyr180 subsequent to transphosphorylation in the activation loop (26Wilcox H.M. Berg L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37112-37121Google Scholar). These data and our structures therefore suggest an intricate regulation mechanism in Itk involving the SH2, SH3, and TH domains, a mechanism that is distinct from the proposed activation of Btk and the simple activation mechanism of many serine-threonine kinases. Possible insight into this auto-activation mechanism might be provided by comparison with Src, another phosphotyrosine kinase. The structure of c-Src, comprising the SH3, SH2, catalytic domain, and regulatory C-terminal tail, has been determined in the inactive form. The SH2 and SH3 domains are located on the distal surface of the catalytic domain, leaving both nucleotide- and peptide-binding sites unimpeded. Their role appears to be to influence the location of the αC-helix via an interaction with the SH2-linker region where Gln251 and Gln253 interact with Gln324 (in the loop following αC-helix) and Arg318 (in the αC-helix), respectively. The two residues in the SH2 linker are not conserved in Itk, and in sequence alignments map to a valine and alanine, respectively, that can no longer interact with the corresponding residues, Gln420 (in the loop after αC-helix) and Ser414 (in the αC-helix). In the absence of these important interactions between the SH2 linker and the catalytic domain, it is likely that the linker follows a different conformation, with the possible consequence that the SH domains are not assembled in the same manner as Src (27Brazin K.N. Fulton D.B. Andreotti A.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 607-623Google Scholar, 28Pursglove S.E. Mulhern T.D. Mackay J.P. Hinds M.G. Booker G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 755-762Google Scholar). This hypothesis is confirmed in solution studies on Btk where the full-length enzyme adopts a linear arrangement (29Marquez J.A. Smith C.I. Petoukhov M.V. Lo Surdo P. Mattsson P.T. Knekt M. Westlund A. Scheffzek K. Saraste M. Svergun D.I. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4616-4624Google Scholar). In a linear arrangement, the full-length enzyme might dimerize, and Tyr512 might then play a role in the autophosphorylation of the SH3 domain of the dimeric partner. Implications for Structure-based Drug Design—The work described in this article provides a strong basis for the design and development of novel immunomodulatory therapies. In determining the crystal structures of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Itk kinase domains in ligand-bound and apo forms, we have shown that phosphorylation of Tyr512 does not induce order in the activation loop or promote rearrangement of protein side chains in the ATP-binding site. This includes the catalytically essential residues, which appear to have active conformations in both structures. This leads us to postulate that an Itk inhibitor will bind with similar affinity to the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated kinase domains. This surprising result, which provides the first structural evidence for dual inhibition of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Itk, has not been observed for any other kinase. Furthermore, our results highlight the significance of residue Phe435 as gatekeeper to an extensive hydrophobic pocket in the ATP-binding site and its key role in the design of selective inhibitors. This is important, as selective inhibition of Itk may be a way of modulating a number of specific immune diseases. 3J. Das, J. Wityak, C. Liu, R. V. Moquin, J. A. Furch, J. Lin, S. H. Spergel, A. M.

Alternatively, an inhibitor of the other TEC family members (Btk, Rlk, Tec, and Bmx) may exploit the smaller threonine residue at this position, either via a hydrogen-bonding interaction or by accessing the hydrophobic pocket. A broad-spectrum inhibitor of the entire Tec family could be achieved using small lipophilic groups positioned close to residue Phe435. Such inhibitors may have a general role in noncytotoxic immunosuppression. We thank Julian Golec for valuable comments and critical reading of the manuscript.

Data base analysis revealed that 135 single nucleotide polymorphisms along the human SLC12A3 gene that encodes the Na+:Cl- cotransporter have been reported. Eight are located within the coding region, and one results in a single amino acid change; the residue glycine at the position 264 is changed to alanine (G264A). This residue is located within the fourth transmembrane domain of the predicted structure. Because Gly-264 is a highly conserved residue, we studied the functional properties of this polymorphism by using in vitro mutagenesis and the heterologous expression system in Xenopus laevis oocytes. G264A resulted in a significant and reproducible reduction (∼50%) in 22Na+ uptake when compared with the wild type cotransporter. The affinity for extracellular Cl- and for thiazide diuretics was increased in G264A. Western blot analysis showed similar immunoreactive bands between the wild type and the G264A cotransporters, and confocal images of oocytes injected with enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged wild type and G264A cotransporter showed no differences in the protein surface expression level.

The fundamental role of the Na+:Cl- cotransporter encoded by the SLC12A3 gene in preserving the extracellular fluid volume and divalent cation homeostasis has been firmly established by the identification of inactivating mutations of this gene as the cause of Gitelman's disease (8Simon D.B.

TSC also serves as the target for the thiazide-type diuretics that are currently recommended as the drug of choice for treatment of hypertension (11Chobanian A.V. Bakris G.L. Black H.R. Cushman W.C. Green L.A. Izzo Jr., J.L. Jones D.W. Materson B.J. Oparil S. Wright Jr., J.T. Roccella E.J. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2003; 289: 2560-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (16367) Google Scholar). Finally, a defect in TSC regulation by the WNK1 and WNK4 kinases has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a salt-dependent form of human hypertension known as pseudohyopaldosteronism type II (12Wilson F.H. Kahle K.T. Sabath E. Lalioti M.D. Rapson A.K. Hoover R.S. Hebert S.C. Gamba G. Lifton R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 13Yang C.L.

Vered I. Mouallem M. Tzadok-Witkon M. Pauzner R. Farfel Z. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 3248-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Taken together, all these observations suggest that TSC molecular variants, resulting from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), could contribute to the normal variations in blood pressure in the population at large, to the inherited predisposition toward essential hypertension, and/or to the differential response to diuretic therapy.Despite the important role of TSC in cardiovascular physiology, pharmacology, and pathophysiology, little is currently known about the structure-function relationships in this cotransporter. By using [3H]metolazone binding to membrane preparations from rat renal cortex, Tran et al. (15Tran J.M. Farrell M.A. Fanestil D.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F908-F915PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that thiazides and Cl- share the same binding site. Recent studies in which the functional properties of the cloned cotransporter were determined, however, provided evidence that metolazone competes with both Na+ and Cl- ions (16Monroy A. Plata C. Hebert S.C. Gamba G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F161-F169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the thiazide-binding site may be shared by both ions and not only by Cl-, as suggested by Tran et al. (15Tran J.M. Farrell M.A. Fanestil D.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F908-F915PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, nothing is known regarding domains or amino acid residues defining the TSC ion transport kinetics or thiazide affinity. So far, within the family of electroneutral cotransporters, some aspects of the structure-function relationships have been investigated only in the two isoforms of the Na+:K+:2Cl- cotransporter, BSC1/NKCC2 and BSC2/NKCC1. Results between both isoforms, however, have shown important differences suggesting that conclusions reached in one member of the family cannot be extended to the other members. For example, in BSC2/NKCC1, Isenring et al. (17Isenring P. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24556-24562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Isenring P.

The SNPs within the coding regions that were considered as potentially important were incorporated into the rat TSC cDNA by using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Automatic DNA sequencing was used to corroborate all the mutations. All primers used for mutagenesis were custom-made (Sigma).Genotyping of the G264A Polymorphism—A restriction fragment length polymorphism method was created for the G264A polymorphism to confirm it and to simplify its detection in 200 normal subjects. Total genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood according to standard procedures. PCR was conducted using 125 ng of genomic DNA using the primer pair sense 5′-AGACCGTGCGGGACCTGCTC-3′ and antisense 5′-CCTCCTCCATGGCCTCCTCACCTT-3′. PCR was conducted for 34 cycles with denaturation at 96 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s, with a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min. The G264A variant was recognized by restriction fragment length polymorphism by using Btg1 (New England Biolabs), and the restriction fragments were separated on 7.5% PAGE, and visualized under ultraviolet light after staining with ethidium bromide. The polymorphism was confirmed by automatic sequencing (AbiPrism®) in all positive cases.Assessment of the Na+:Cl-Cotransporter Function—Oocytes were harvested from anesthetized adult female Xenopus laevis frogs, defolliculated, and prepared for microinjection following our standard procedure (16Monroy A.

The next day mature oocytes were injected with 50 nl of water or cRNA transcribed in vitro, using the T7 RNA polymerase mMESSAGE kit (Ambion), at a concentration of 0.5 μg/μl. Oocytes were then incubated for 3 days in ND96 with sodium pyruvate and gentamicin and 1 day in Cl--free ND96 (16Monroy A. Plata C. Hebert S.C. Gamba G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F161-F169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of the Na+:Cl- cotransporter was determined by assessing tracer 22Na+ uptake (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in groups of at least 15 oocytes following our standard protocol (16Monroy A. Plata C. Hebert S.C. Gamba G. Am. J.

Gluconate was used as a Cl- substitute and N-methyl-d-glucamine as a Na+ substitute. At the end of the uptake period tracer activity was determined for each dissolved oocyte by β-scintillation counting.Western Blotting—Western blot analysis was used to compare WT with mutant protein in cRNA-injected oocytes following our standard protocol (22Meade P.

In brief, groups of 15 oocytes injected with water or cRNA were homogenized in 2 μl/oocyte of homogenization buffer and centrifuged twice at 100 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Protein extracts from oocytes (four oocytes per lane) were heated in sample buffer containing 6% SDS, 15% glycerol, 0.3% bromphenol blue, 150 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and 2% β-mercaptoethanol, resolved by Laemmli SDS-7.5% PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. For immunodetection we used a rabbit polyclonal anti-rat TSC antibody (generously provided by Dr. Mark Knepper, National Institutes of Health), diluted 1:1000 (23Wang X.Y. Masilamani S. Nielsen J. Kwon T.H. Brooks H.L. Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The membrane was exposed to anti-TSC antibody diluted in blocking buffer (TTBS, 0.2% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C, subsequently washed in TTBS, and incubated for 60 min at room temperature with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary (anti-rabbit) antibody (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer and washed again. Immunoreactive species were detected using Immun-Star Chemiluminescent Protein Detection Systems (Bio-Rad).Assessment of the TSC Expression at the Oocytes Plasma Membrane—The surface expression of wild type or mutant TSC (see below) was determined by assessing the fluorescence in the Xenopus oocytes using a TSC fusion construct that we have previously validated (12Wilson F.H. Kahle K.T. Sabath E. Lalioti M.D. Rapson A.K. Hoover R.S. Hebert S.C. Gamba G. Lifton R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 24Hoover R.S.

In this construct, the EGFP was fused to the amino-terminal domain of TSC. Xenopus oocytes were then microinjected with water as control or with EGFP-WT-TSC or EGFP-mutant-TSC cRNA. After 4 days of incubation, oocytes were monitored for EGFP fluorescence in the oocytes surface using a Zeiss laser-scanning confocal microscope (objective lens ×10, Nikon). Excitation and emission wavelengths used to visualize EGFP fluorescence were 488 and 515–565 nm, respectively. We have shown previously that EGFP-TSC fluorescence in the oocytes surface colocalizes with the F-404 specific plasma membrane dye and that oocytes injected with EGFP-TSC exhibit significant thiazide-sensitive 22Na+ uptake, indicating the EGFP-TSC fluorescence is located in the plasma membrane (24Hoover R.S.

For densitometry analysis, the plasma membrane fluorescence was quantified by determining the pixel intensity around the entire oocytes circumference using SigmaScan Pro image analysis software.Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance is defined as two-tailed p < 0.05, and the results are presented as mean ± S.E. The significance of the differences between means was tested with the Student's t test.RESULTSSingle Nucleotide Polymorphisms in the SLC12A3 Gene—Up to 135 SNPs have been informed within the SLC12A3 gene. 127 SNPs are located within intronic sequences and only eight are within exonic sequences. Fig. 1 depicts the proposed TSC topology (25Gamba G. Miyanoshita A. Lombardi M. Lytton J. Lee W.S. Hediger M.A. Hebert S.C. J. Biol.

These are the SNPs A122A, T465T, S628S, A714A, G875G, and I1017I corresponding to the NCBI SNP cluster IDs rs2304479, rs5801, rs55802, rs5803, rs5804, and rs2289113, respectively. Two SNPs result in a single amino acid change. One is the R863K SNP (cluster ID rs8060046) that was considered as irrelevant because this SNP located within the carboxyl-terminal domain results in a conserved substitution of the positively charged amino acid arginine, which is present in the human cotransporter (8Simon D.B.

In contrast, the other SNP that alter the primary sequence of human TSC (ID number rs1529927) predicts a change of the nonpolar amino acid glycine at the position 264 for the residue alanine.

Thus, the G264A SNP was considered as potentially important and therefore was introduced into TSC by in vitro mutagenesis.Allele Frequency of the G264A Polymorphism—A restriction fragment length polymorphism strategy was used to assess the presence of G264A SNP by PCR. The PCR product (510 bp) contained a constant Btg1 restriction site, and therefore, when digested, two bands of 461 and 49 bp, respectively, are observed in GG genotype (encoding glycine at position 264 in both alleles). In contrast, in GA genotype heterozygotes (that is one allele encoding glycine and the other encoding alanine at position 264), a new specific Btg1 restriction site was used, and then four bands of 461, 390, 71, and 49 bp were observed. To test the allele frequency of the G264A polymorphism, 200 Caucasian subjects were genotyped. The sample included 119 males and 81 females with the following characteristics (mean ± S.D.): age 52 ± 16 years, systolic blood pressure 117 ± 11 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 69 ± 7 mmHg, and body mass index of 24 ± 4 kg/m2. None of the subjects had present or past cardiovascular conditions including hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, or diabetes. The frequency of the GA genotype was 2% in the sample studied. No subjects with AA phenotype were detected (that is homozygotes encoding alanine at position 264 in both alleles). Shown in Fig. 2A is a representative gel containing the Btg1-digested PCR fragment from a normal subject and one heterozygous for the GA genotype. Fig. 2, B and C, illustrates sequencing of this region in a GG and a GA phenotype (codons GGC and GCC, respectively). Thus, our results suggest that G264A is a true SNP.Fig. 2A, example of a genotyping result for the Gly-264 → Ala (G264A) polymorphism. The polymorphism consists in a G to C transversion at codon 264 that changed the glycine-encoding codon GGC to the alanine-encoding codon, GCC. The PCR products were digested with Btg1 and resolved on SDS-PAGE: lane 1, molecular weight marker, lane 2, GA heterozygous (codon GCC); lane 3, GG homozygous (codon GGC), and lane 4 (undigested PCR product).

The best expression so far observed in stably transfected eukaryotic cells (MDCK cells) with human TSC cDNA consists of small increase (∼25%) over background (35De Jong J.C.

Thus, X. laevis oocytes were microinjected with cRNA transcribed from wild type TSC (WT) or from TSC harboring the G264A SNP (G264A). As shown in Fig. 3, WT or G264A cRNA injection induced a significant increase in 22Na+ uptake in X. laevis oocytes. However, the increase in G264A-injected oocytes was of a significantly lower magnitude than the increase observed in WT oocytes. Uptake in WT-injected oocytes was 3448 ± 234 pmol oocyte-1 h-1, whereas in G264A-injected oocytes was 1712 ± 366 pmol oocyte-1 h-1 (p < 0.01, n = 20). As shown in Fig. 3, the uptake was due to the TSC activity because a complete inhibition of uptake was observed in the absence of extracellular chloride or in the presence of the thiazide-type diuretic, metolazone. A reduction of a similar magnitude in the G264A activity was consistently observed in every single experiment. In order to ensure that the reduction in 22Na+ uptake was not due to differences in the amount of cRNA injected or in the transcription rate of the protein, cRNA concentration was determined by densitometry of the corresponding bands in the ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel, and the transcribed protein was assessed by Western blot analysis of the injected oocytes. No differences were found between WT and G264A in the amount of cRNA injected (Fig. 3B), as well as in the TSC protein produced by the oocytes (Fig. 3C).Fig. 3Functional expression of WT and G264A cotransporters in X. laevis oocytes.A, 22Na+ uptake in oocytes that were injected with water, with 25 ng of cRNA from WT, or from G264A.

To study the first possibility, we assessed the surface expression of the WT and G264A proteins by injecting X. laevis oocytes with the cRNA encoding the WT or G264A cotransporters that had been tagged previously with the EGFP. To perform these experiments, we used the EGFP-tagged TSC construct that we have characterized previously (24Hoover R.S. Poch E. Mo"
https://openalex.org/W1966016176,"The proteolytic processing of the precursor of the β-amyloid peptides (APP) is believed to be a key event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. This processing is activated through a pathway involving the PDGF receptor, Src, and Rac1. In this paper, we demonstrate that this pathway specifically acts on APP and requires the YENPTY motif present in the APP cytosolic domain. Considering that several results indicate that the adaptor proteins interacting with this domain affect the processing of APP, we examined their possible involvement in the PDGF-induced pathway. By using an APP-Gal4 reporter system, we observed that the overexpression of Fe65 activates APP-Gal4 cleavage, whereas X11 stabilizes APP. Although mDab1 and Jip1 have no effect, Shc induces a strong activation of APP cleavage, and the contemporary exposure of cells to PDGF causes a dramatic cooperative effect. The analysis of point mutations of the APP YENPTY motif indicates that Fe65 and PDGF function through different mechanisms. In fact, Fe65 requires the integrity of APP695 Tyr682 residue, whereas PDGF effect is dependent upon the integrity of Asn684. Furthermore, the mutation of Asp664 of APP, which is the target site for the caspase-directed APP cleavage, strongly decreases the effect of Fe65. This suggests that Fe65 activates the cleavage of APP by caspases, and in fact, caspase inhibitor Z-VEVD decreases the APP cleavage induced by Fe65. On the contrary, the effects of Shc overexpression, like those of PDGF, are completely absent in the presence of compound X and require the integrity of the Asn684 residue of APP695. The involvement of Shc in the pathway regulating APP processing is confirmed by the effects of constitutively active and dominant negative mutants of Src and Rac1.

In fact, the main constituent of senile plaques, the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), derives from the proteolytic processing of APP, and mutations of the APP gene are responsible for some rare cases of genetically inherited AD. Furthermore, presenilins are key factors of the molecular machinery catalyzing the cleavage of APP, and mutations of the two presenilin genes are responsible for most of the cases of familial AD (for reviews, see Refs. 1Selkoe D.J.

It is well demonstrated that APP is a type I membrane protein that is cleaved by two different proteolytic enzymes, named α- and β-secretases. These cleavages generate soluble extracellular fragments, named α- and β-APPs, and two forms of transmembrane stubs, Cys83 and Cys99, as a consequence of the activity of α- and β-secretases, respectively. These stubs are then substrates of a third enzyme, the γ-secretase, which cleaves them within the transmembrane helix, thus generating from Cys99 the 40–42 amino acid-long peptide Aβ and from Cys83 a smaller fragment named p3. The cleavage of Cys83 and Cys99 by γ-secretase also results in the generation of a C-terminal peptide of 57 residues (APP intracellular domain, AICD) (3De Strooper B. Annaert W. J.

Several results indicated that APP could be considered a cargo receptor for kinesin-I because of its interaction with the light chain subunit of this motor protein (18Kamal A. Stokin G.B. Yang Z. Xia C.-H. Goldstein L.S.B. Neuron. 2000; 28: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Fast anterograde axonal transport of presenilin-1 is dependent upon APP, and kinesin-I and the latter are involved in the transport of the vesicle compartment where the secretase-directed processing of APP occurs (22Kamal A. Almenar-Queralt A. LeBlanc J.F. Roberts E.A. Goldstein L.S. Nature. 2001; 414: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Additionally, the proteolytic processing of APP recalls that of another membrane protein named Notch, whose intracellular domain is released from the membrane upon a γ-secretase cleavage and is translocated into the nucleus where it associates with the transcription machinery and regulates several genes, in association with other transcription factors (for a review, see Ref. 23Mumm J.S. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The similarity between APP and Notch is strengthened by the observations that AICD has been also found in the nucleus (24Kimberly W.T. Zheng J.B. Guenette S.Y. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol.

Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) and are found associated with active chromatin on the promoter of the KAI1 gene (27Baek S.H. Ohgi K.A. Rose D.W. Koo E.H. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2002; 110: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The possibility that APP could regulate nuclear functions is further supported by results indicating that Fe65, one of the cytosolic ligands of APP, is a nuclear protein (28Minopoli G. de Candia P. Bonetti A. Faraonio R. Zambrano N. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6545-6550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) interacting, further than with Tip60, with the late Simian virus 40 transcription factor (LSF) and regulating the expression of the thymidylate synthase and GS3Kβ genes (29Bruni P.

Furthermore, AICD also interacts with JIP1 and X11; in these cases, it could also be involved in gene regulation (31Scheinfeld M.H. Matsuda S. D'Adamio L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1729-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 32Biederer T. Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Liu X. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7340-7351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the cleavage of APP by α- and/or β-secretases and the resulting cleavage of Cys83 or Cys99 by γ-secretase result in the release of AICD from the membrane anchor and in its translocation into the nucleus, where, in association with other proteins, it could regulate gene transcription. The attractiveness of this hypothesis would be increased if the cleavage of APP and the resulting gene regulation could be triggered by events, such as extracellular signals, thus assigning to APP a role in signal transduction. We have demonstrated recently that APP processing is induced by activated PDGF receptor through a pathway involving the activation of Src and Rac1 (33Gianni D. Zambrano N. Bimonte M. Minopoli G. Mercken L. Talamo F. Scaloni A. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9290-9297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate that some partners of the APP cytodomain play a key role in the regulation of APP processing. In particular, Fe65 and Shc increase the cleavage of APP by two different mechanisms: Fe65 induces the caspase-dependent cleavage of APP, whereas Shc cooperates with PDGF in the activation of the secretase-directed processing of APP. DNA Constructs—The APP-Gal4 construct and the CAT reporter construct controlled by Gal4 cis-elements (G5B-CAT) have been described (33Gianni D. Zambrano N. Bimonte M. Minopoli G. Mercken L. Talamo F. Scaloni A. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9290-9297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). N-terminal mutants of APP-Gal4 were generated in a Gal4 expression cassette obtained by cloning a PCR fragment of the yeast Gal4 cDNA between the sites NotI and ApaI of the pRcCMV vector (Invitrogen). The primers used to amplify Gal4 were: 5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTAAGCTACTGTCTTCTATCGAACAAGC and 5′-CATCGGGCCCTTACTCTTTTTTTGGGTTTGGTGGGG. To ensure the proper membrane location of the deleted proteins, the coding sequence of the APP signal peptide was added to the 5′ end of the vector polylinker by cloning (in the HindIII site) a double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide with a modified 5′ Hind III sequence (the upper strand sequence was: 5′-AGCTAACTAAGGCCATGCTGCCCGGTTTGGCACTGCTCCTGCTGGCCGCCTGGACGGCTCGGGCGCTGA). Next, the PCR fragments encoding the N-terminal portions of the human APP695 cDNA used in this study were obtained with the forward primers D19–119, 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGTGAGTTTGTAAGTGATGCCCTTC; D19–260, 5′-CCCAAGCTTCCCTACGAAGAAGCCACAGAGAG; D19–467, 5′-CCCAAGCTTCAGTCTCTCTCCCTGCTCTACAAC; and D19–581, 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGGTTGACAAATATCAAGACGGAGG. The reverse primer, common to all N-terminal mutants, was 5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCGTTCTGCATCTGCTCAAAGAACTTG. The C-terminal deletion mutants have been amplified by PCR with the common forward primer, 5′-CCCAAGCTTACTAAGGCCATGCTGCCCGGTTTGGCACTGC, and with the reverse primers DC07, 5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCCTTGTAGGTTGGATTTTCGTACGGC; DC14, 5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCGCCGTTCTGCTGCATCTTGGAC; and DC44, 5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCTTTCTTCTTC AGCATCACCAAGG. The PCR products of the N- and C-terminal deletions, obtained from a human APP695 cDNA template, have been cloned in the Gal4/signal peptide cassette between the Hind III and NotI sites. The point mutations were introduced in the wild-type APP-Gal4 construct through site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene mutagenesis kit) with complementary primer pairs bearing the desired mutations. The sequences of the corresponding forward primers were Y682G, 5′-CCAAGATGCAGCAGAACGGCGGCGAAAATCCAACCTACAAGTTCTTTG; N684A, 5′-AAGATGCAGCAGAACGGCTACGAAGCTCCAACCTACAAGTTCTTTGAGCA; Y687A, 5′-CGGCTACGAAAATCCAACCGCCAAGTTCTTTGAGCAGATGC; D664N, 5′-GGTGTGGTGGAGGTTAACGCCGCTGTCACC.

Cell Culture Conditions, Transfections, and Treatments—HEK293, HeLa, and HeLaAG cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transfections were performed by calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation with equal amounts of plasmid DNA in 60-mm cell culture dishes. PDGF stimulation of transfected cells was started 24 h after transfection and allowed to proceed for 16–24hinthe presence of 40 ng/ml of recombinant human PDGF-BB (Sigma). Treatments of the cell cultures with the inhibitors were performed for the indicated times at the following concentrations: 10 μm PP2 (Calbiochem), 2 μm AG1296 (Calbiochem), 10 μm secretase inhibitor compound X (Calbiochem), 50 μm Z-DEVD-fmk (Alexis). Preparation of Cell Extracts, Western Blotting, Reporter Analyses, and Aβ Assay—For Western blot analyses, cells were harvested in cold PBS, resuspended in lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) and kept on ice for 15 min. Then the extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. 20 μg of each extract were resolved on 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels (Invitrogen) under reducing conditions and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Filters were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in T-PBS solution (phosphate-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with appropriate dilutions of primary antibodies. The excess antibody was removed by sequential washing of the membranes in T-PBS, and then a 1:5000 dilution of the appropriate secondary antibody (conjugated horseradish peroxidase) was added to the filters for 30 min at room temperature. The excess was removed by sequential washing of the membranes in T-PBS, and the signals were detected by chemiluminescence, using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). The antibodies used and their dilutions were: anti-APP 6E10 (Sigma), 1:1000; anti-APP CT695 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., 1:250; anti-Fe65 (36Zambrano N. Buxbaum J.D. Minopoli G. Fiore F. De Candia P.

CAT expression was measured by using colorimetric CAT enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (Roche Applied Science). Transiently transfected HeLa cells were harvested in cold TEN buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl), lysed by freezing at -80 °C and rapid thawing at room temperature, and resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 400 mm NaCl). Total extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C, and their protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. For CAT concentration measurement, 150 μg of each protein extract were used. Luciferase assays were carried out as described (29Bruni P. Minopoli G. Brancaccio T. Napolitano M. Faraonio R. Zambrano N. Hansen U. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35481-35488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), using a Berthold tube luminometer. Aβ1–40 was assayed in triplicates from conditioned media of HEK293 cells transiently transfected with APP695 and with Shc p46, Fe65, or SrcYF. 48 h after transfection, 100 μl of culture media were harvested and assayed with an EIA kit (IBL, Gunma, Japan), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The Cytodomain of APP Is Required for the PDGF-induced Cleavage of APP-Gal4—To examine the structural constraints of APP that are necessary to allow PDGF to induce APP processing, we have generated a series of deletion mutants of the extracellular/intraluminal domain of APP, and these cDNAs have been cloned in frame with that encoding the whole Gal4 transcription factor. These constructs, under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, direct the expression of fusion proteins in which Gal4 is fused at the C terminus of APP deletion mutants, all possessing a signal peptide to obtain the proper membrane location. These expression vectors were transfected in HeLa cells together with G5B-CAT vector driving CAT expression under the control of five Gal4 responsive elements (see Fig. 1A); thus, the measurement of CAT functioning as a readout of the cleavage of APP (33Gianni D. Zambrano N. Bimonte M. Minopoli G. Mercken L. Talamo F. Scaloni A. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9290-9297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated or not with PDGF to assess the ability of the growth factor to induce the processing of each construct. As shown in Fig. 1B, all of the deletion mutants of the extracellular/intraluminal domain are responsive to PDGF treatment to the same extent, thus indicating that this domain of APP is not involved in the response to PDGF. An additional deletion mutant, represented by Cys99 fused to Gal4, was not suitable for this experiment, given the high basal level of CAT protein observed upon transfection, regardless of the treatment with PDGF. Similarly, three deletion mutants of the intracellular (IC) domain of APP have been generated and cloned in-frame with the whole Gal4 protein. The analysis of these deletion mutants allowed us to observe that the removal of the C-terminal 14 residues of APP results in the abolition of the responsiveness to PDGF (see Fig. 1C). This result is in agreement with those demonstrating that the deletion of the YENPTY motif present in this region abolishes the β-secretase-mediated processing of APP and strongly decreases Aβ production (37Perez R.G. Soriano S. Hayes J.D. Ostaszewski B. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Chen X. Stokin G.B. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18851-18856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). PDGF Specifically Activates the Secretase-directed Processing of APP—The abolition of the PDGF effect on APP-Gal4 processing observed in APP mutants lacking part of the cytodomain suggests that the PDGF-Src-Rac pathway could specifically activate the processing of APP and not that of other γ-secretase substrates lacking specific signals present in APP. To address this point, we examined the effects of the PDGF-activated pathway on Notch, another substrate of the secretase machinery. To do this, we transfected HeLa cells with Notch or with its deletion mutant, NotchΔE, together with a plasmid in which the luciferase gene is transcribed under the control of cbf-1 cis-elements. As shown in Fig. 2, in cells transfected with the entire Notch protein, the expression of the reporter gene was not activated by the PDGF treatment, and in cells transfected with NotchΔE, which is a substrate of γ-secretase (34Kopan R. Schroeter E.H. Weintraub H. Nye J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), the treatments with the PDGF-R inhibitor AG1296 or with the Src inhibitor PP2 had no effect. As expected, however, the γ-secretase inhibitor, compound X, completely inhibited luciferase gene expression. These results support the hypothesis of a specific effect of the PDGF on APP processing. Considering the results reported in Fig. 1C, it is possible that one or more specific ligands of the APP cytodomain could play a role in the induction of APP cleavage by PDGF. Adaptor Proteins Interacting with the Cytodomain of APP Affect the PDGF-induced Cleavage of APP-Gal4 —The region of the APP cytodomain, whose deletion causes the abolition of the response to PDGF, contains the YENPTY motif that is known to interact with several different PTB-containing proteins. To evaluate the role of these molecules on APP-Gal4 cleavage induced by PDGF, HeLaAG cells, stably expressing APP-Gal4 (33Gianni D. Zambrano N. Bimonte M. Minopoli G. Mercken L. Talamo F. Scaloni A. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9290-9297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), were transfected with vectors driving the expression of Fe65, X11α, mDab1, JIP1, or Shc and then treated or not with PDGF-BB. As shown in Fig. 3, some of these proteins have a significant effect on CAT accumulation, either in the presence or absence of PDGF treatment. The overexpression of Fe65 results in an accumulation of CAT that is higher than that previously observed after PDGF treatment. The exposure to PDGF of Fe65-transfected cells let us observe even higher levels of CAT, but lower than those expected if the CAT accumulation due to PDGF treatment is simply summed to that because of Fe65 overexpression alone. On the contrary, CAT expression upon PDGF treatment in X11α-transfected HeLaAG cells was significantly lower than that observed in cells not overexpressing X11. Finally, although mDab1 and JIP1 have no evident effect upon PDGF-induced APP-Gal4 cleavage, the consequences of Shc transfection were dramatic. In fact, the levels of CAT reached in cells transfected with Shc vector were two times higher than those observed in mock-transfected cells exposed to PDGF. More importantly, PDGF and Shc seem to act cooperatively, given the very high levels of CAT measured when Shc-transfected cells were exposed to PDGF. Fe65-induced Cleavage of APP-Gal4 Is Independent from the Pathway Activated by PDGF—We first explored the effects of Fe65 and asked whether these effects are due to the interaction of Fe65 with APP. To this aim, we transfected HeLaAG cells with mutant forms of Fe65 lacking the PTB2 domain, which is involved in the interaction with APP, or bearing a point mutation in the PTB2 domain (C655F), which is known to prevent the formation of the Fe65-APP complex (8Duilio A. Faraonio R. Minopoli G. Zambrano N. Russo T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Baek S.H. Ohgi K.A. Rose D.W. Koo E.H. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2002; 110: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). These two mutant proteins were completely devoid of activity, as demonstrated by the fact that CAT does not accumulate upon their transfection. Furthermore, PDGF treatment has the same effect on mock-transfected HeLaAG cells and in cells transfected with Fe65 mutants, thus suggesting no dominant-negative effect of these mutant proteins on PDGF-induced pathway (see Fig. 4B). The observation that the effects of Fe65 and those of PDGF are not cooperative suggests that Fe65 could induce the cleavage of APP-Gal4 through a pathway different from that activated by PDGF. This possibility is supported by the analysis of the effects of PDGF treatment or of the Fe65 overexpression on the cleavage of APP-Gal4 proteins, bearing point mutations of the YENPTY motif. In fact, as shown in Fig. 4C, the mutation of the Tyr682 residue, which is known to prevent the binding of Fe65 (8Duilio A. Faraonio R. Minopoli G. Zambrano N. Russo T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), completely abolishes the effect of Fe65 overexpression, whereas the mutations of Asn684 and Tyr687 residues, which are compatible with the formation of Fe65-APP complex (8Duilio A. Faraonio R. Minopoli G. Zambrano N. Russo T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), have no effect on the cleavage induced by Fe65. On the contrary, the mutation of Tyr682 does not affect th"

We have investigated the in vivo modulation by bradykinin of neurally enhanced early angiogenesis in rat models of knee synovitis. The increased endothelial cell proliferation that was observed 24 h after intra-articular injection of substance P (10 nmols) was completely blocked by either NK1 or B2 receptor antagonists (SR140333 or FR172357, respectively). In mild synovitis induced by 0.03% Carrageenan, but not in naïve animals, injection of bradykinin (100 nmols) increased endothelial cell proliferation. In moderate synovitis induced by 3% kaolin and 3% carrageenan, the combined blockade of both NK1 and B2 receptors inhibited 64% of the synovitis-enhanced endothelial cell proliferation. Synovitis-enhanced endothelial cell proliferation was also inhibited by the B2 receptor antagonist alone (27%) but not by the NK1 receptor antagonist alone. B1 receptor agonist (des-Arg9-bradykinin) and antagonist (SR240612A) did not significantly modulate endothelial cell proliferation. B2 receptor mRNA was constitutively expressed in both mild and moderate inflammation, whereas B1 mRNA production was induced in the moderate inflammation model. These findings demonstrate that substance P and bradykinin can act on NK1 and B2 receptors, respectively, to promote endothelial cell proliferation in acute synovitis."

On reduction of the nonheme iron, the μ-oxo bridge is broken, and the ferric heme iron is hydroxylated or hydrated, depending on the pH. At present, the catalytic cycle of NOR is a matter of much debate, and it is not known to which redox state(s) of the enzyme nitric oxide can bind. This study has used cyanide to probe the nature of the active site in a number of different redox states.

Chem. 1970; 245: 4508-4518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (or SERCA2a, Ref. 10Zarain-Herzberg A. MacLennan D.H. Periasamy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4670-4677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a member of the P-type ATPase family (11Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). The transport process involves the movement of two Ca2+ from the cytoplasm into the lumen of the SR following the hydrolysis of a single molecule of ATP (12Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although significantly lower coupling efficiencies have been measured empirically (13Shannon T.R. Chu G. Kranias E.G. Bers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7195-7201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The reaction cycle is relatively slow and thus a large number of SERCA2 molecules are expressed in cardiac muscle (up to 45% of total SR protein content, 14Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Pace R.C. Stokes D.L.

The most important of these is phospholamban, which is a naturally occurring inhibitor of the Ca2+-ATPase. In its dephosphorylated state, phospholamban is able to interact with SERCA and reduce Ca2+-pump activity through a reduction in the apparent Ca2+ affinity of the pump (15Kranias E.G. Biochim.

Phosphorylation of phospholamban on one of a number of sites (Ser-16, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; Thr-17, CaMKII; Ref. 19Simmerman H.K. Lovelace D.E. Jones L.R. Biochim. Biophys.

J. 1996; 316: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), to reveal enhanced Ca2+ transport activity at all physiological Ca2+ concentrations. The kinetic basis of inhibition and subsequent activation of Ca2+ transport is complex; involving contributions from the acceleration of particular reaction steps in the catalytic cycle of SERCA (21Tada M. Yamada M. Ohmori F. Kuzuya T. Inu M. Abe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1985-1992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and an increase in the coupling efficiency between ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+ movement (13Shannon T.R. Chu G. Kranias E.G.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8394-8397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) observed SERCA phosphorylation by CaMKII following the immunoprecipitaton of SERCA from a solubilized, kinase-treated SR preparation. In addition, Xu et al. (24Xu A. Hawkins C. Narayanan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8394-8397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated the phosphorylation of purified SERCA2a by CaMKII, which was accompanied by a 1-fold stimulation of Ca2+-ATPase activity at all [Ca2+]. Subsequent studies identified Ser-38 as the principal site of phosphorylation (25Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Narayanan N. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26492-26496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Odermatt A. Kurzydlowski K. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14206-14213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and still further studies noted substantial enhancement of Ca2+-ATPase activity (1–1.5-fold increase in activity) despite the low stoichiometry of SERCA phosphorylation (12–13% of total SERCA; Ref. 26Hawkins C. Xu A. Narayanan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31198-31206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Simple extrapolation of these latter data sets might suggest that phosphorylation of SERCA has the capacity to stimulate Ca2+-pump activity ∼10-fold, making this form of regulation more significant than that achieved by phospholamban.The control of Ca2+-pump function by direct phosphorylation is not observed by all investigators. Odermatt et al. (30Odermatt A. Kurzydlowski K. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14206-14213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) detected no direct stimulation of Ca2+-pump function following CaMKII treatment, although phospholamban-mediated control was clearly evident. Furthermore this study noted a sizeable inhibition of basal Ca2+-pump activity upon brief exposure to Ca2+-free conditions (30Odermatt A. Kurzydlowski K. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14206-14213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These Ca2+-free conditions were similar to the “control” conditions of Xu et al. (24Xu A. Hawkins C. Narayanan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8394-8397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), making it unclear whether Xu et al. (24Xu A. Hawkins C. Narayanan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8394-8397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had described stimulation of pump activity in response to CaMKII phosphorylation or artifactual inhibition of pump activity under (Ca2+-free) control conditions. In separate studies Ready et al. (14Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Pace R.C. Stokes D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14964-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) explored the phosphorylation of SERCA using highly purified cardiac SR and highly purified SERCA2a. CaMKII was unable to phosphorylate SERCA in either of these preparations, however the phosphorylation of a junctional SR protein of 100 kDa was noted. This phosphoprotein co-migrated with SERCA in one-dimensional electrophoretic separations but did not share its distribution throughout the SR network. As such the identity of the phosphoprotein was suggested to be a protein unrelated to SERCA.A number of physiological and pathophysiological observations might be explained in terms of altered SERCA activity upon phosphorylation of Ser-38. The lack of independent confirmation of the incidence or importance of Ser-38 phosphorylation of SERCA has prevented confident implication of this event as a molecular explanation of particular physiological observations (6Hasenfuss G. Pieske B. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2002; 34: 951-969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 31DeSantiago J. Maier L.S. Bers D.M. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2002; 34: 975-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have produced and characterized an antibody specific for the Ser-38 phosphorylated form of SERCA2a in an attempt to evaluate whether Ser-38 phosphorylation occurs. This antibody is able to detect Ser-38 phosphorylation at levels of 0.03 pmol and above; however, it failed to detect SERCA in any experiment performed (included those involving kinase-treated SR containing up to 60 pmol of SERCA2a, and those involving myocytes exposed to CaMKII-activating interventions). As such we conclude that Ser-38 phosphorylation of SERCA does not occur to a significant extent in the situations examined.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Calmodulin was purified from bovine testes by the method of Gopalakrishna and Anderson (32Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). CaMKII was provided by Professor Howard Schulman (Stanford, CA). SERCA2a peptide (YLEPAILE); and phosphorylated and dephosphorylated SERCA2a peptides (31KLKERWGS(PO4)NEL41 and 31KLKERWGSNEL41) were purchased from Neosystem, France. PKI peptide (TTYADFIASGRTGRRNAIHD-amide) was obtained from Alta Bioscience, Birmingham, UK. Sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC) cross-linker was from Pierce. Calyculin A was obtained from Alexis Corporation; IGEPAL CA-630, BSA and protein A-Sepharose 4B from Sigma; Triton and SDS from BHD; and [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from ICN. Sure 2 supercompetent cells were obtained from Stratagene and BLR competent cells from Novagen.Preparation of Phosphospecific Antibodies—Ca2+-ATPase peptide phosphorylated on Ser-38 (31KLKERWGS(PO4)NEL41) was prepared by the CaMKII phosphorylation of peptide 31KLKERWGSNEL41. The phosphopeptide was purified to homogeneity by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) using carbodiimide cross linkage (33Goodfriend T. Fasman G. Levine L. Science. 1964; 144: 1344-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) and dialyzed extensively against buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl). Adult New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with ∼150 μg KLH and attached peptide at 6-week intervals and immune serum collected 11 days after immunizations. Serum was prepared and stored at –70 °C. A polyclonal antiserum is described herein: SERCA PS-38 raised to the phosphorylated peptide.Production of Scaffolding Protein Titin I27 Domains (denoted (I27)5)—A gene encoding a concatamer of mutant forms of the I27 domain of titin was provided by Prof. Radford (University of Leeds, Ref. 34Brockwell D.J.

It is referred to as (I27)5 throughout this study. (I27)5 was expressed and purified as described in Brockwell et al. (34Brockwell D.J. Beddard G.S. Clarkson J. Zinober R.C. Blake A.W. Trinick J.

After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the maleimide-activated peptide was purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex Peptide HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). The chromatography was performing using 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2, and a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Fractions of interest were pooled and urea was added to the fractions to make a final urea concentration of 9 m. (I27)5 concatamer (0.1 μmol) was added to the mixture and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The conjugate was dialyzed extensively against water. Final product was stored at –20 °C. The same procedure was followed to conjugate SERCA2a peptide (YLEPAILE) to (I27)5 concatamer. Protein concentration was determined by a BCA assay (35Li C Wang J.H. Colyer J. Biochem. 1990; 29: 4535-4540Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Phosphorylation of SR Proteins by CaMKII—Rabbit and canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were prepared as described previously (36Tikhonov V.N. Mustafin I.S. Zh. Anal. Khim. 1965; 20: 390Google Scholar). Phosphorylation reactions were conducted at 37 °Cin100 μl of buffer (adapted for Hawkins et al., Ref. 26Hawkins C. Xu A. Narayanan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31198-31206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), containing 1 mg/ml SR vesicles and 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 9.0), 5 mm MgSO4,2 μm calyculin A, and 1 μm PKI. For phosphorylation by CaMKII (3 μg/ml or 6 μg/ml), the buffer contained 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 37.5 μg/ml of calmodulin. For the control samples, Ca2+ (1 mm EGTA present), calmodulin and CaMKII were omitted from the assay medium. The phosphorylation reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP to a final concentration of 2 mm. In some experiments [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity of 400–550 cpm/pmol) was used. After 2 min of incubation, the reactions were stopped by adding 25 μl of concentrated Laemmli sample buffer (5×-strength) resulting in a final solution composition of 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE/Western blotting as described previously (38Rodriguez P. Bhogal M.S. Colyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38593-38600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).Isolated Cardiac Myocytes—Isolated rat ventricular myocytes were prepared from male Wistar rats according to the method of Frampton et al. (39Frampton J.E. Orchard C.H. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1992; 453: 385-400Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After isolation, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of a HEPES-based solution of the following composition (mm): NaCl 130; KCl 5.4; CaCl2 1; MgCl2 1.4; NaH2PO4 0.4; HEPES 5; glucose 10; creatine 10, and taurine 20 at pH 7.4. Cells were counted using a counting chamber (Weber Scientific International Ltd.). Aliquots (100 μl) of the myocyte suspension were placed in wells of a perspex container and stimulated via platinum electrodes at 0.5 Hz with a pulse width of 5 ms at room temperature. CaMKII activation in myocytes was provoked by exposure of myocytes to 1 μm isoproterenol; to 2.5 mm extracellular calcium; to 1 μm of the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A; or to increased stimulated frequency (2.5 Hz). After 5 min, concentrated Laemmli sample buffer (5-strength), containing 50 mm NaF and 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate to prevent dephosphorylation of SR proteins during sample preparation (40Calaghan S. White E. Colyer J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), was added to each cell suspension. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE.Immunoblot Analysis—Myocardial proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10 and 15% polyacrylamide gels as described by Laemmli (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Following separation, proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Pall BioSupport, Portsmouth, UK) by semi-dry blotting, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked for 2–4 h at room temperature using 5% dried milk and Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4), 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were probed overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies: PT-17 (1:5000) for the Thr-17 phosphorylated form of phospholamban (41Drago G.A. Colyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25073-25077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); α-CLEP (1:5000) for SERCA2a (16Colyer J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17486-17493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and SERCA PS-38 (1:5000) antiserum specific for the Ser-38-phosphorylated form of Ca2+-ATPase. A secondary horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody raised in rabbit (goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L); Jackson Immunochemicals; lot number 38179) or protein A peroxidase (Sigma) were used in combination with two enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate or SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate, Pierce) to visualize the primary antibodies. Data were captured using a Fuji LAS-1000 Imaging System CCD Camera (AIDA software for analysis).Method of Stripping Membranes—Following immunoblot analysis, membranes were incubated at 55 °C in stripping buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 2% SDS, and 0.7% β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min. Membranes were then washed in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4), 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% dried milk for 2–4 h at room temperature, and probed overnight at 4 °C with another primary antibody.Phosphorimaging and Data Analysis—The amount of 32P incorporation into the cardiac SR proteins was determined by phosphorimaging. Phosphorimage plates were exposed to PVDF membranes for 48 or 72 h, and densitrometric analysis of the data was conducted using Fuji BAS-1000 scanner (AIDA software for analysis). Phosphoproteins were also excised from PVDF membranes and quantified by scintillation counting.ELISA—Competitive ELISA experiments were performed by standard protocols (42Hudson L. Hay F.C. Practical Inmunology.3rd Ed. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford1980: 348-350Google Scholar) using o-phenylene diamine as the substrate for peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies (Jackson Immunochemicals). ELISA plates were coated with phosphorylated Ser-38 peptide at 1 μg/well, and phosphorylated, and de-phosphorylated Ser-38 peptides were used as competing agents as described in the relevant figure.Statistics—All values are expressed as mean ± S.D. for n experiments, and statistical significance was evaluated using the Student's t test for unpaired data.RESULTSThe phosphorylation of SERCA2 on Ser-38 has been described as a regulatory feature capable of very significant activation of Ca2+-ATPase activity (24Xu A. Hawkins C. Narayanan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8394-8397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hawkins C. Xu A. Narayanan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31198-31206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although its occurrence and implication have been disputed (14Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Pace R.C. Stokes D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14964-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 30Odermatt A. Kurzydlowski K. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14206-14213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This site, although unique to SERCA2, is contained within a segment of the protein which is highly conserved between SERCA1 and SERCA2 (Fig. 1A), particularly from residue 39 onwards (43Brandl C.J. Green N.M. Korczak B. MacLennan D.H. Cell. 1986; 44: 597-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). As such, the two proteins are likely to display comparable structures in this region. This segment of SERCA1, for which two high resolution structures exist (11Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 44Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar), is a surface exposed, highly mobile segment of the protein (Fig. 1B, highlighted in black). This segment remains solvent exposed in both conformational extremes of the enzyme (E1, E2; Fig. 1B). Assuming that the structure of this segment of SERCA2 is comparable, Ser-38 would be surface exposed and mobile. This would make it accessible to kinases and phosphatases in the major conformational states of the enzyme, and would also make it accessible to an antibody specific for this site. We have produced a phosphorylation site-specific antibody to this feature (highlighted in black in the equivalent structure of SERCA1, Fig. 1) in an effort to define the incidence and role of Ser-38 phosphorylation in cardiac muscle. A polyclonal antibody was produced to the sequence 31KLKERWGS(PO4)NEL41, phosphorylated at Ser-38 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2 shows that this polyclonal antiserum, SERCA PS-38, was specific for the phosphorylated peptide, because the phosphopeptide was a potent inhibitor of antibody binding to antigen (IC50 18 nm), whereas the equivalent dephosphorylated peptide was unable to interfere with antibody: antigen recognition.Fig. 1Residue 38 is located in an accessible, highly mobile domain on the surface of SERCA. A, the primary sequence of SERCA2 and SERCA1 in the region of the proposed phosphorylation site (Ser-38, SERCA2) is compared (taken from Brandl et al., Ref. 43Brandl C.J. Green N.M. Korczak B.

SERCA was not detected in these Western blot experiments (see Fig. 5 for an example). It was important to establish the basis of this negative result, to ensure that it was providing information about the incidence of Ser-38 phosphorylation, rather than recording a technical failing of the antibody or experiment. To this end, we constructed a calibration standard comprising the phosphopeptide epitope attached to an irrelevant scaffolding protein. The scaffolding protein was chosen as it contained a single site for peptide attachment (Fig. 3A) thus providing a uniform structure for the presentation of epitope peptide, ideal for accurate quantitation.Fig. 5A cardiac phosphoprotein of 100 kDa is not recognized by SERCA2 antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2025531019,"An interaction between cytochrome a in oxidized cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) and anions has been characterized by EPR spectroscopy. Those anions that affect the EPR g = 3 signal of cytochrome a can be divided into two groups. One group consists of halides (Cl-, Br-, and I-) and induces an upfield shift of the g = 3 signal. Nitrogen-containing anions (CN-, NO2-, N3-, NO3-) are in the second group and shift the g = 3 signal downfield. The shifts in the EPR spectrum of CcO are unrelated to ligand binding to the binuclear center. The binding properties of one representative from each group, azide and chloride, were characterized in detail. The dependence of the shift on chloride concentration is consistent with a single binding site in the isolated oxidized enzyme with a Kd of ∼3 mm. In mitochondria, the apparent Kd was found to be about four times larger than that of the isolated enzyme. The data indicate it is the chloride anion that is bound to CcO, and there is a hydrophilic size-selective access channel to this site from the cytosolic side of the mitochondrial membrane. An observed competition between azide and chloride is interpreted by azide binding to three sites: two that are apparent in the x-ray structure plus the chloride-binding site. It is suggested that either Mg2+ or Arg-438/Arg-439 is the chloride-binding site, and a mechanism for the ligand-induced shift of the g = 3 signal is proposed.

The respiratory heme-copper oxidases constitute a super-family of terminal oxidases in both prokaryotic organisms and the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. Cytochrome c oxidases (CcO) 1The abbreviations used are: CcO, cytochrome c oxidase; CcO·CN, complex of oxidized CcO with cyanide; ET, electron transfer; DM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; Mes, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; Ches, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: CcO, cytochrome c oxidase; CcO·CN, complex of oxidized CcO with cyanide; ET, electron transfer; DM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; Mes, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; Ches, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid. catalyze the reduction of molecular oxygen to water using the reducing equivalents supplied by ferrocytochrome c. Four redox centers of CcO are involved in promoting electron transfer (ET) from cytochrome c to dioxygen. CuA and cytochrome a are primary electron acceptors, and electrons from these sites are delivered to the binuclear center of CcO, consisting of cytochrome a3 and CuB, where oxygen is reduced to water. ET is coupled to the generation of transmembrane proton gradient. Two different processes contribute to the formation of this gradient. The first is the oxidation of cytochrome c from the cytosolic side with the protons required for water formation taken from the matrix side. The second process involves active proton translocation from the matrix to the cytosolic side and is referred to as proton pumping. Substantial insight into the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme has been obtained from studies of the interaction of ligands with CcO. Most of these studies are devoted to the direct interaction of external molecules with the redox active centers. However, there are sites distant from the redox centers that may well be involved in catalysis. One such site is a surface segment from Gly-49 to Asn-55 on the cytosolic side of subunit I of bovine CcO. It has been established that this region undergoes a redox-coupled conformational change (1Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Fei M.J. Libeu C.P.

Tsukihara T. Yoshikawa S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 12: 112Google Scholar), and a surface site, Asp-51 of subunit I, sensitive to the redox state of cytochrome a, was identified as essential for proton translocation (3Shimokata K. Katayama Y. Shimada H. Yoshikawa S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 12: 105Google Scholar, 4Tsukihara T. Shimokata K. Katayama Y. Shimada H. Muramato K. Aoyama H. Mochizuki M. Shinzawa-Itoh K.

A second intriguing distant site is the nonredoxactive magnesium located at the bottom of a well connected to the cytosolic side of the membrane. Magnesium has been suggested to participate in the exit of water from CcO (5Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). This suggestion is consistent with the present evidence showing that water departs the catalytic center via a discrete pathway involving magnesium (6Florens L. Schmidt B. McCracken J. Ferguson-Miller S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7491-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Schmidt B. McCracken J. Ferguson-Miller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). The experimental identification of distant sites that may have a physiologically relevant interaction with the redox center(s) brings a new aspect for both the consideration and exploration of these sites in the catalytic mechanism. At least one site has been implicated by the modulation of the EPR signal of oxidized cytochrome a by several anions (8Hartzell C.R. Beinert H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 368: 318-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 9Wilson D.F. Erecinska M. Owen C. Arch. Biochem.

Spencer J.P.E. Brandt U. Rich P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Because the binuclear center, composed of cytochrome a3 plus CuB, is the established site where external ligands are bound directly, it led to the idea that the EPR signal of cytochrome a is affected from this center. However, our previous work on ligand binding suggested the interaction of cytochrome a with azide is not mediated by the cytochrome a3-CuB center and that there has to be at least one additional binding site (13Li W. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1833-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This site was recently located in the crystal structure of the enzyme-azide complex and shown to be in the proximity of cytochrome a on the hydrophobic surface of the enzyme within the membrane (14Fei M.J. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Yamaguchi H. Tsukihara T. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yoshikawa S. Acta Cryst. D. 2000; 56: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this work we have used EPR spectroscopy to classify anions into three groups via their effect on the low field g-value of cytochrome a in oxidized CcO. One group consists of very weakly or noninteracting anions (phosphate, sulfate). The anions from the other two groups induce opposite shifts of the g = 3 signal. A detailed characterization of the interaction with chloride and azide shows there is a novel chloride-binding site in native oxidized CcO. Hepes, Tris, Mes, Ches, NaN3, l-histidine, HCl, and EDTA were from Sigma. NaCl, Na2SO4, Na2HPO4, and K3Fe(CN)6 were from Fisher. NaCN, KBr, KNO3, and NaNO2 were from Mallinckrodt Chemical Works. KI was from J. T. Baker. Peroxide-free detergent Triton X-100 was from Roche Diagnostics, and n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DM) was from Anatrace. Bovine heart mitochondria and CcO were isolated using the method of Soulimane and Buse (15Soulimane T. Buse G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with a minor modification (16Fabian M. Palmer G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria were subjected to protein extraction twice with Triton X-100 and K2SO4. The second extract contained solubilized CcO and was further purified on a Sepharose Q fast flow column. In this study, we made some additional changes. EDTA (1 mm) and histidine (1 mm) was added to the original extraction medium (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 250 mm sucrose) to minimize binding of transition metals; the EDTA was omitted for the second extraction. After loading on the column the second extract was washed with 1 liter of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm histidine, and 0.1% Triton X-100 before eluting with a sulfate gradient. (Either K2SO4 or Na2SO4 can be used without any noticeable differences in the binding of anions to isolated CcO.) The preparation of mitochondria depleted of cytochrome c was based on the earlier methods (17Jacobs E.E. Sanadi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 531-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lenaz G. MacLennan D. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 499-504Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated from fresh beef hearts (15Soulimane T. Buse G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and washed twice with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and 250 mm sucrose. The washed mitochondria were diluted to a protein concentration of about 3.3 mg/ml with cold 10 mm Na2SO4, stirred at 4 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 26,000 × g for 30 min. Cytochrome c was extracted by suspension of the sediment in cold solution of 100 mm Na2SO4 and 10 mm K3Fe(CN)6. This suspension was stirred at 4 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 25 min. To ensure that extraction of cytochrome c was complete, this step was repeated four times using 100 mm Na2SO4 with ferricyanide omitted and three times with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, containing 50 mm Na2SO4. These mitochondria were used directly for chloride binding measurement at pH 7.6. For experiments at pH 6.8, the pH of the mitochondrial suspension was lowered by small additions of dilute H2SO4. Enzyme concentration was determined at pH 8.0 from the absorbance of isolated oxidized enzyme at 424 nm using A = 158 mm-1 cm-1. Enzyme concentration in the mitochondria was determined on mitochondria clarified with 0.1% dodecyl maltoside from the absorption of dithionite-reduced CcO·CN minus oxidized CcO·CN using ΔA606-620 = 18.6 mm-1 cm-1 for cytochrome a (19Liao G.-L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1274: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To determine the dependence of CcO catalytic activity on NaCl concentration, both purified enzyme and mitochondria solubilized with 0.1% DM were used. The oxidation of 10 μm ferrocytochrome c by 4.5 nm CcO was monitored at 550 nm and 22 °C (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1% DM). The ionic strength of the solution was held constant (I = 210) using mixtures of Na2SO4 and NaCl. The midpoint potential of cytochrome a was estimated in the CcO·CN under argon atmosphere using cytochrome c present as a redox indicator (Eobs0 = 264 mV at pH 7.7 and 23 °C) (20Margalit R. Schejter A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 32: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The midpoint potential of cytochrome a was calculated from the equilibrium ratios of (cytochrome a3+)/(cytochrome a2+) and (cytochrome c3+)/(cytochrome c2+). These ratios were obtained from optical spectra after addition of 12.8 μm ferrocytochrome c to 2.6 μm CcO·CN in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The CcO·CN had been depleted of free cyanide by gel filtration. To determine the effect of chloride on the rate of cytochrome a reduction by ferrocytochrome c at constant and high ionic strength, the CcO·CN complex was used once more. Typically, 3 μm CcO·CN was mixed with 29 μm reduced cytochrome c in the Gibson-Durrum stopped-flow instrument at 13 °C. The buffer was 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, and 0.1% DM, and the ionic strength was maintained at I = 460 by NaCl and Na2SO4. The high ionic strength and reduced temperature were necessary to detect the electron transfer kinetics by stopped flow (21Antalis T.M. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6194-6206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of chloride on intramolecular electron transfer from cytochrome a to cytochrome a3, 3.7 μm oxidized CcO was rapidly mixed with 40 μm ferrocytochrome c plus 0.1 m dithionite in the stopped-flow instrument at 23 °C under argon. Under these conditions, a large fraction of CuA and cytochrome a was reduced in the dead time of the instrument, and, predominantly, the kinetics of electron transfer to the binuclear center was observed. The solution contained 10 mm Ches buffer, pH 9.0, 0.1% DM, and 48 mm NaCl. In the control samples, chloride was replaced by 16 mm Na2SO4. The stopped-flow measurements were made about 20 min after dissolving stock CcO in the buffer. All samples for EPR were frozen by quick immersion in a methanol dry ice bath at a temperature of -58 °C and then transferred to liquid nitrogen and stored at this temperature. EPR spectra were recorded at 10 K on a Varian E6 spectrometer. The conditions for measurements were: frequency, 9.26 GHz; power, 3 mW; modulation amplitude, 10 G; and the modulation frequency, 100 kHz. All dissociation constants were established from the spectral shift of the g = 3 signal in the EPR spectrum of oxidized CcO induced by the binding of anions. Chloride binding to isolated CcO was studied at three pH values: at pH 5.7 (20 mm Mes, 100 mm Na2SO4, 0.1% Triton X-100), at pH 7. 6 (10 mm Hepes, 0.1% Triton X-100), and at pH 8.8 (10 mm Ches, 0.1% Triton X-100). At pH 5.7, a high ionic strength was necessary to avoid enzyme precipitation. The dependences of spectral shifts on the ligand concentration were normalized before the fit was applied. To normalize the amplitudes, the following assumptions based on the resolutions of the g = 3 peak into two gaussian curves were employed. In mitochondria, the whole population of CcO is in the chloride-bound state at a chloride concentration of 1 m. For purified CcO, about 80% of CcO is in this chloride-bound state in the presence of 20 mm NaCl. In the presence of 20 mm azide, 1 m NaCl converts ∼70% of purified CcO to the chloride-bound state. At liquid helium temperatures, the EPR spectrum of oxidized “rapid” CcO only exhibits signals caused by low spin cytochrome a and CuA. The absorption-like g = 3 signal of oxidized cytochrome a of purified CcO (Fig. 1A) is unaffected by sodium ions over the range 10–400 mm at pH 7.6. This peak is also insensitive to the addition of 100 mm Na2SO4 or 100 mm sucrose, brief sonication of the enzyme under a stream of nitrogen on ice, repeated freezing and thawing, and storage on ice for 14 h in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm Na2SO4, 0.1% Triton X-100 (w/v). In addition, the complex between cytochrome c and CcO prepared by stoichiometric addition of oxidized cytochrome c to CcO at low ionic strength (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100) did not affect the peak at g = 3. A downfield shift of about 5 G and slight broadening of the peak occurred following the addition of 150 mm sodium phosphate (Table I).Table IThe effect and affinity of anions to cytochrome a in oxidized CcOLigandsInduced shift of g3 signalKdgaussmmLow-field NaCN302.3 NaN33515.6 NaNO2353.3 NaNO328NDaNot determinedHigh-field NaCl243.5 KBr28∼2bEstimated value KI17∼15bEstimated valueNo or small low-field shift NaPi5 Na2SO40a Not determinedb Estimated value Open table in a new tab However, we have found anions that markedly influence the g = 3 signal of oxidized CcO. On the basis of the observed spectral shifts, all ligands tested were consequently divided into one of three groups (Table I). The first group, nitrogen-containing ligands (cyanide, azide, nitrite, and nitrate), induces a low field shift of the g = 3 peak of ∼30–35 G. The second group contained halides (chloride, bromide, and iodide), which shifted the g = 3 peak by ∼17–30 G to a higher magnetic field. The third group was the large anions, phosphate and sulfate, which caused little, if any, shift. The presence of two opposing spectral effects suggested the presence of two separate binding sites for these ligands. To test this possibility we selected, for further characterization, a representative from each of the first two groups: azide, because it has been located in the vicinity of cytochrome a in the crystal structure of the CcO-azide complex (14Fei M.J. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Yamaguchi H. Tsukihara T. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yoshikawa S. Acta Cryst. D. 2000; 56: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and chloride, because it may have some relevance for CcO catalysis (22Orii Y. Mogi T. Sato-Watanabe M. Hirano T. Anraku Y.

Biochem. 1997; 122: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Chloride Binding—It has been demonstrated previously that chloride can bind to the binuclear center of CcO (24Scott R.A.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13046-13052Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, the observation that the g = 3 peak of cytochrome a is sensitive to chloride raises the question of whether or not the influence of chloride on the EPR spectrum of cytochrome a is a consequence of chloride binding to the catalytic center. That this is not the case was established by the following observations. First, the rate of chloride binding to the site that interacts with cytochrome a is much faster than the rate of chloride binding to the binuclear center (29Fabian M. Skultety L. Brunel C. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6061-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The reaction with cytochrome a was complete in <1 min, the time needed for manually mixing the enzyme and chloride and freezing the EPR sample in a methanol/dry ice slush. Longer incubation of CcO with chloride at room temperature had no additional affect on the EPR spectrum. By contrast, the binding of chloride to the binuclear center occurs on a time scale of hours at pH 7.6 (29Fabian M. Skultety L. Brunel C. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6061-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Second, the g = 3 signal observed in the presence of chloride is restored to the signal of the original untreated CcO immediately following the removal of chloride by gel filtration, whereas release of chloride from the binuclear center is an extremely slow process (29Fabian M. Skultety L. Brunel C. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6061-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Third, the binding of chloride to the binuclear center is associated with the changes in the optical spectrum (12Moody A.J. Richardson M. Spencer J.P.E. Brandt U. Rich P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 27Giuffre A. Stubauer G. Brunori M. Sarti P. Torres J. Wilson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32475-32478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 29Fabian M. Skultety L. Brunel C. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6061-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that were not observed when the EPR spectrum of cytochrome a was already modified by chloride. Finally, the influence of chloride and all other ligands tested on the cytochrome a EPR signal was also observed in the complex of oxidized CcO with cyanide bound in the binuclear center. Increasing the concentration of sodium chloride in samples of purified oxidized CcO led to an increasing amount of enzyme with its g = 3 peak shifted upfield by about 24 gauss (Fig. 1A). Thus, in a sample containing 20 mm NaCl, the EPR spectrum was resolved into two gaussian curves with about 80% of CcO having the upfield shifted signal (chloride-bound) and the remainder chloride-free. Between 0 and 20 mm NaCl the binding process is associated with a decrease of EPR intensity of unreacted enzyme with a parallel increase of intensity because of chloride-bound enzyme. This process can be nicely visualized from the difference EPR spectra of chloride-treated minus untreated enzyme (Fig. 1B). At concentrations of sodium chloride between 20 mm and 1 m, the effect of chloride was reversed, and the normalized amplitude in the difference spectra slightly decreased (Fig. 2A). A similar dependence was obtained from normalized areas under gaussian curves (Fig. 2A). For this purpose, the g = 3 peak at each chloride concentration was resolved to two gaussian curves and the relative area under the curve, corresponding to the chloride-bound state, calculated. The dependence of normalized amplitudes can be fitted assuming a single chloride-binding site with a Kd of 3.5 mm at pH 7.6 (Fig. 2B). This Kd was insensitive to increasing the ionic strength by the addition of 50 mm Na2SO4, to replacing the detergent Triton X-100 with 0.1% DM, and to changing of the buffer from 10 mm Hepes to 10 mm Tris. The estimated Kd for bromide and iodide are 2 and 15 mm, respectively (Table I). Measurements with chloride at both pH 5.7 and 8.8 gave almost identical results. In both cases, the binding of chloride proceeded in two phases, with the first phase having Kd values of 3.4 and 2.5 mm at pH 5.7 and 8.8, respectively. At all three pH values (pH = 5.7, 7.6, and 8.8), raising the concentration of NaCl to 1 m did not convert the g = 3 peak of isolated CcO to a homogenous EPR signal. At this high concentration of NaCl, ∼70% of the enzyme population exists in the high field-shifted state. Chloride has a similar effect on the EPR signal of oxidized CcO present in mitochondrial membranes (8Hartzell C.R. Beinert H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 368: 318-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Because the EPR spectra of cytochrome c and cytochrome a overlap in the g = 3 region, we first depleted the mitochondria of cytochrome c as described under “Experimental Procedures.” With membrane-bound CcO, we noticed two differences in the behavior of the g = 3 signal compared with the isolated enzyme. First, there was only the high field shift of the g = 3 signal upon chloride binding; the second phase of chloride binding is missing at both pH 7.6 and 6.8. Second, the dissociation constant is about 4–5-fold larger than that found with the purified enzyme. From the fits to the data for CcO in mitochondria, a single binding site with Kd values of 12.5 and 15.6 mm at pH values of 7.6 (Fig. 2B) and 6.8, respectively, were determined. The presence of a second phase in chloride binding with isolated CcO, but not with the membrane-bound enzyme, suggests the purification procedure leads to some modification of the enzyme. To examine this possibility, we collected samples of enzyme after each purification step and measured the EPR spectra of the untreated sample and the sample treated with 200 mm NaCl. The data suggested that CcO is modified during chromatography on Sepharose Q. Thus, the longer the time the enzyme spends being washed on the Sepharose Q column (with either 70 mm K2SO4 or Na2SO4 in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and 0.1% Triton X-100), the greater the fraction of CcO that reacts with chloride in two phases. Competition between the Binding of Azide and Chloride— The crystal structure of the azide complex of bovine cytochrome oxidase reveals a second binding site for azide that is close to cytochrome a and on the surface of the enzyme (14Fei M.J.

To test whether this site could also bind chloride, we determined the Kd for chloride in the absence and in the presence of 20 mm NaN3 (Figs. 2B and 3A); we have also compared the affinity of CcO for azide with and without 50 mm NaCl (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Azide-induced shift of the g = 3 signal of oxidized CcO in the absence and presence of chloride.A, 40 μm oxidized oxidase (control (0)) and in the presence of 10 and 100 mm NaN3.

The fraction of CcO with an EPR spectrum almost unchanged from that of untreated enzyme could be interpreted as a population of enzyme that does not react with azide (Fig. 3A). That this is not the case was readily demonstrated. The addition of 10 mm sodium chloride to azide-free enzyme produced the expected upfield shift of the EPR spectrum (Fig. 3B), whereas addition of this same concentration of sodium chloride to the enzyme pretreated with sodium azide left the azide-modified EPR spectrum unchanged (Fig. 3A). The response of CcO to azide was again indicative of the presence of two populations of cytochrome oxidase, observed in the interaction of chloride with CcO and attributed to the modification of enzyme during isolation. As before, enzyme samples were collected at each stage of the purification and reacted with 200 mm azide. It was again observed that it was mainly chromatography on Sepharose Q that led to the development of this inhomogeneous response to ligand binding. It can be seen that the presence of azide decreases the affinity of CcO for chloride (Fig. 3). To estimate quantitatively the effect of azide, we again measured the high field shift of the g = 3 signal produced by raising the concentration of NaCl. Fitting the normalized plot of the signal increase on the high field side of the g = 3 peak resulted in a single binding site with a Kd of 70 mm (Fig. 2B). The same value was determined from a plot of the signal decrease at the low field side of the g = 3 peak. The result indicated that the two populations of CcO, characterized by the distinct maxima observed in the presence of 20 mm azide, showed the same affinity for chloride. This affinity was about 20-fold smaller than that determined in the absence of azide. At this point it would appear that our data can be explained in two ways: (i) there is only one ligand-binding site, and chloride and azide compete for it, or (ii) there are two different sites, but there is an interaction between them such that when azide occupies its specific site, the affinity of the second site for chloride is decreased 20-fold. To examine these alternatives we compared the affinity of CcO for azide in the presence and absence of 50 mm NaCl (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, at this concentration of NaCl, there was no reduction in the affinity of CcO for azide, as revealed in the spectra of enzyme treated with 10 mm azide and with and without 50 mm chloride (Fig. 4, A and B). In both cases, azide induced a low field shift of the g = 3 signal. Moreover, it appears the fraction of CcO that underwent the low field shift following reaction with 10 mm NaN3 was enha"

https://openalex.org/W2067032198,"At the Materials Research Society meeting in Boston last October, I had flashbacks of my first conference eight years ago. In 1996, as a new master's student, I went to the Conference of Metallurgists in Montreal, Canada, and was completely overwhelmed. I didn't know what to say or who to talk to — I just had the vague sense that somehow I was supposed to 'network'. Instead, I hid from the crowds at the conference bookstore."
