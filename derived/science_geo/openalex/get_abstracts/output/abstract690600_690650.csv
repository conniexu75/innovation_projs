https://openalex.org/W4221044986,"High-risk large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) has poor outcomes with standard first-line chemoimmunotherapy. In the phase 2, multicenter, single-arm ZUMA-12 study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03761056) we evaluated axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel), an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, as part of first-line treatment in 40 patients with high-risk LBCL. This trial has completed accrual. The primary outcome was complete response rate (CRR). Secondary outcomes were objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), event-free survival (EFS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), assessment of safety, central nervous system (CNS) relapse and blood levels of CAR T cells and cytokines. The primary endpoint in efficacy-evaluable patients (n = 37) was met, with 78% CRR (95% confidence interval (CI), 62-90) and 89% ORR (95% CI, 75-97). As of 17 May 2021 (median follow-up, 15.9 months), 73% of patients remained in objective response; median DOR, EFS and PFS were not reached. Grade ≥3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events occurred in three patients (8%) and nine patients (23%), respectively. There were no treatment-related grade 5 events. Robust CAR T-cell expansion occurred in all patients with a median time to peak of 8 days. We conclude that axi-cel is highly effective as part of first-line therapy for high-risk LBCL, with a manageable safety profile."

https://openalex.org/W4221027163,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is especially severe in aged populations1. Vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are highly effective, but vaccine efficacy is partly compromised by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced transmissibility2. The emergence of these variants emphasizes the need for further development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, especially for aged populations. Here we describe the isolation of highly virulent mouse-adapted viruses and use them to test a new therapeutic drug in infected aged animals. Many of the alterations observed in SARS-CoV-2 during mouse adaptation (positions 417, 484, 493, 498 and 501 of the spike protein) also arise in humans in variants of concern2. Their appearance during mouse adaptation indicates that immune pressure is not required for selection. For murine SARS, for which severity is also age dependent, elevated levels of an eicosanoid (prostaglandin D2 (PGD2)) and a phospholipase (phospholipase A2 group 2D (PLA2G2D)) contributed to poor outcomes in aged mice3,4. mRNA expression of PLA2G2D and prostaglandin D2 receptor (PTGDR), and production of PGD2 also increase with ageing and after SARS-CoV-2 infection in dendritic cells derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Using our mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2, we show that middle-aged mice lacking expression of PTGDR or PLA2G2D are protected from severe disease. Furthermore, treatment with a PTGDR antagonist, asapiprant, protected aged mice from lethal infection. PTGDR antagonism is one of the first interventions in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals that specifically protects aged animals, suggesting that the PLA2G2D-PGD2/PTGDR pathway is a useful target for therapeutic interventions."

https://openalex.org/W4221092226,"Single-cell RNA sequencing methods can profile the transcriptomes of single cells but cannot preserve spatial information. Conversely, spatial transcriptomics assays can profile spatial regions in tissue sections, but do not have single-cell resolution. Here, we developed a computational method called CellTrek that combines these two datasets to achieve single-cell spatial mapping through coembedding and metric learning approaches. We benchmarked CellTrek using simulation and in situ hybridization datasets, which demonstrated its accuracy and robustness. We then applied CellTrek to existing mouse brain and kidney datasets and showed that CellTrek can detect topological patterns of different cell types and cell states. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics experiments on two ductal carcinoma in situ tissues and applied CellTrek to identify tumor subclones that were restricted to different ducts, and specific T cell states adjacent to the tumor areas. Our data show that CellTrek can accurately map single cells in diverse tissue types to resolve their spatial organization. CellTrek maps single cells to their spatial coordinates in tissues."
https://openalex.org/W4221126430,"Abstract Current small-molecule inhibitors of KRAS(G12C) bind irreversibly in the switch-II pocket (SII-P), exploiting the strong nucleophilicity of the acquired cysteine as well as the preponderance of the GDP-bound form of this mutant. Nevertheless, many oncogenic KRAS mutants lack these two features, and it remains unknown whether targeting the SII-P is a practical therapeutic approach for KRAS mutants beyond G12C. Here we use NMR spectroscopy and a cellular KRAS engagement assay to address this question by examining a collection of SII-P ligands from the literature and from our own laboratory. We show that the SII-Ps of many KRAS hotspot (G12, G13, Q61) mutants are accessible using noncovalent ligands, and that this accessibility is not necessarily coupled to the GDP state of KRAS. The results we describe here emphasize the SII-P as a privileged drug-binding site on KRAS and unveil new therapeutic opportunities in RAS-driven cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4221118890,"Abstract The use of the edible photosynthetic cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis (spirulina) as a biomanufacturing platform has been limited by a lack of genetic tools. Here we report genetic engineering methods for stable, high-level expression of bioactive proteins in spirulina, including large-scale, indoor cultivation and downstream processing methods. Following targeted integration of exogenous genes into the spirulina chromosome (chr), encoded protein biopharmaceuticals can represent as much as 15% of total biomass, require no purification before oral delivery and are stable without refrigeration and protected during gastric transit when encapsulated within dry spirulina. Oral delivery of a spirulina-expressed antibody targeting campylobacter—a major cause of infant mortality in the developing world—prevents disease in mice, and a phase 1 clinical trial demonstrated safety for human administration. Spirulina provides an advantageous system for the manufacture of orally delivered therapeutic proteins by combining the safety of a food-based production host with the accessible genetic manipulation and high productivity of microbial platforms."
https://openalex.org/W4221086349,"Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) screening represents the standard of care for detecting allograft rejections after heart transplant. Manual interpretation of EMBs is affected by substantial interobserver and intraobserver variability, which often leads to inappropriate treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, unnecessary follow-up biopsies and poor transplant outcomes. Here we present a deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) system for automated assessment of gigapixel whole-slide images obtained from EMBs, which simultaneously addresses detection, subtyping and grading of allograft rejection. To assess model performance, we curated a large dataset from the United States, as well as independent test cohorts from Turkey and Switzerland, which includes large-scale variability across populations, sample preparations and slide scanning instrumentation. The model detects allograft rejection with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.962; assesses the cellular and antibody-mediated rejection type with AUCs of 0.958 and 0.874, respectively; detects Quilty B lesions, benign mimics of rejection, with an AUC of 0.939; and differentiates between low-grade and high-grade rejections with an AUC of 0.833. In a human reader study, the AI system showed non-inferior performance to conventional assessment and reduced interobserver variability and assessment time. This robust evaluation of cardiac allograft rejection paves the way for clinical trials to establish the efficacy of AI-assisted EMB assessment and its potential for improving heart transplant outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4220807374,"The application of large-scale metabolomic profiling provides new opportunities for realizing the potential of omics-based precision medicine for asthma. By leveraging data from over 14,000 individuals in four distinct cohorts, this study identifies and independently replicates 17 steroid metabolites whose levels were significantly reduced in individuals with prevalent asthma. Although steroid levels were reduced among all asthma cases regardless of medication use, the largest reductions were associated with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment, as confirmed in a 4-year low-dose ICS clinical trial. Effects of ICS treatment on steroid levels were dose dependent; however, significant reductions also occurred with low-dose ICS treatment. Using information from electronic medical records, we found that cortisol levels were substantially reduced throughout the entire 24-hour daily period in patients with asthma who were treated with ICS compared to those who were untreated and to patients without asthma. Moreover, patients with asthma who were treated with ICS showed significant increases in fatigue and anemia as compared to those without ICS treatment. Adrenal suppression in patients with asthma treated with ICS might, therefore, represent a larger public health problem than previously recognized. Regular cortisol monitoring of patients with asthma treated with ICS is needed to provide the optimal balance between minimizing adverse effects of adrenal suppression while capitalizing on the established benefits of ICS treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4220777335,"Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) of in-vitro-fertilized embryos has been proposed as a method to reduce transmission of common disease; however, more comprehensive embryo genetic assessment, combining the effects of common variants and rare variants, remains unavailable. Here, we used a combination of molecular and statistical techniques to reliably infer inherited genome sequence in 110 embryos and model susceptibility across 12 common conditions. We observed a genotype accuracy of 99.0-99.4% at sites relevant to polygenic risk scoring in cases from day-5 embryo biopsies and 97.2-99.1% in cases from day-3 embryo biopsies. Combining rare variants with polygenic risk score (PRS) magnifies predicted differences across sibling embryos. For example, in a couple with a pathogenic BRCA1 variant, we predicted a 15-fold difference in odds ratio (OR) across siblings when combining versus a 4.5-fold or 3-fold difference with BRCA1 or PRS alone. Our findings may inform the discussion of utility and implementation of genome-based PGT in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W4221079770,"The olfactory system’s ability to detect and discriminate between the vast array of chemicals present in the environment is critical for an animal’s survival. In mammals, the first step of this odor processing is executed by olfactory sensory neurons, which project their axons to a stereotyped location in the olfactory bulb (OB) to form glomeruli. The stereotyped positioning of glomeruli in the OB suggests an importance for this organization in odor perception. However, because the location of only a limited subset of glomeruli has been determined, it has been challenging to determine the relationship between glomerular location and odor discrimination. Using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and machine learning, we have generated a map of most glomerular positions in the mouse OB. These observations significantly extend earlier studies and suggest an overall organizational principle in the OB that may be used by the brain to assist in odor decoding. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, Wang et al. recreate a map of glomerular locations in the mouse olfactory bulb. This work describes a spatial organization that may be used by the brain to assist in odor decoding."
https://openalex.org/W4220818695,"Having a good awareness of ovarian cancer (OC) risk and protective factors could facilitate early diagnosis. This study aimed to assess Palestinian women's awareness about OC risk and protective factors and to identify the factors associated with having good awareness.A cross-sectional study was conducted from July 2019 to March 2020 in the two main areas of Palestine: the West Bank and Jerusalem (WBJ) and the Gaza Strip. A translated-into-Arabic version of the validated OC awareness measure was utilized. Adult women attending hospitals, primary healthcare centers, and public spaces at 11 governorates were invited to participate. The awareness level was categorized based on the number of factors recognized: poor (0 to 5), fair (6 to 10) and good (11 to 15).Of the 6095 women approached, 5618 agreed and completed the questionnaire (response rate = 92.1%). The final analysis included 5411 questionnaires. The most identified modifiable OC risk factor was 'being a smoker' (n = 4024, 74.4%), whereas the least identified was 'having in vitro fertilization treatment' (n = 1652, 30.5%). The most identified non-modifiable OC risk factor was 'having ovarian cysts' (n = 3136, 58.0%), whereas the least identified was 'having endometriosis' (n = 1880, 34.7%). The most identified OC protective factor was 'breastfeeding' (n = 4770, 88.2%), whereas the least identified was 'using the pill for a long time' (n = 930, 17.2%). Only 820 women (15.2%) displayed good awareness of OC risk and protective factors. Women from the Gaza Strip were slightly more likely than women from the WBJ to have good awareness (16.4% vs. 14.2%). In contrast, post-secondary education, higher monthly income, being married, and knowing someone with cancer were associated with an increase in the likelihood of displaying good awareness.The overall awareness of OC risk and protective factors in this study was low. Educational interventions are needed to improve Palestinian women's awareness."
https://openalex.org/W4220868735,"The marine microbial natural product salinosporamide A (marizomib) is a potent proteasome inhibitor currently in clinical trials for the treatment of brain cancer. Salinosporamide A is characterized by a complex and densely functionalized γ-lactam-β-lactone bicyclic warhead, the assembly of which has long remained a biosynthetic mystery. Here, we report an enzymatic route to the salinosporamide core catalyzed by a standalone ketosynthase (KS), SalC. Chemoenzymatic synthesis of carrier protein-tethered substrates, as well as intact proteomics, allowed us to probe the reactivity of SalC and understand its role as an intramolecular aldolase/β-lactone synthase with roles in both transacylation and bond-forming reactions. Additionally, we present the 2.85-Å SalC crystal structure that, combined with site-directed mutagenesis, allowed us to propose a bicyclization reaction mechanism. This work challenges our current understanding of the role of KS enzymes and establishes a basis for future efforts toward streamlined production of a clinically relevant chemotherapeutic."
https://openalex.org/W4220921344,"Monolingualism has typically been understood as a homogeneous phenomenon. The linguistic experiences of monolinguals are usually overlooked when analysing the impact of foreign language experiences on language processing and cognitive functioning. In this study, we analyse the linguistic experiences of 962 English-speaking individuals from the United Kingdom (UK) who identified as monolinguals. Through an online survey, we found that more than 80% of these monolinguals had learned at least one foreign language, dialect, or type of jargon. More than half of this 80% of monolinguals also used languages they had learned at some point in their lives. Moreover, nearly 40% of all the studied monolinguals confirmed that they had been passively exposed to foreign languages or dialects in their environment; approximately a fourth of these monolinguals who declared exposure to at least one foreign language (or dialect) confirmed that they also used these languages. Furthermore, activities that involved passive use of languages (i.e., activities that require reading or listening but do not require speaking or writing; e.g., watching TV) were occasionally carried out in foreign languages: around 26% of these monolinguals confirmed the passive use of more than one language. Lastly, around 58% of monolinguals who had visited one or more non-English-speaking countries declared the active use of foreign languages during their stay(s). These results suggest that the linguistic experiences of monolinguals from the UK often include exposure to and use of foreign languages. Moreover, these results show the need to consider the specificity of the monolingual language experience when analysing the impact of foreign languages on cognitive functioning, as differences in the language experiences of bilinguals also have divergent impacts on cognition. Lastly, monolingual experiences are different from bilingual experiences; therefore, existing questionnaires that evaluate language experiences should be adapted to capture the particular linguistic experiences of monolinguals."
https://openalex.org/W4220754295,"Glycation is a nonenzymatic posttranslational modification (PTM) known to be increased in the brains of hyperglycemic patients. Alpha-synuclein (αSN), a central player in the etiology of Parkinson’s disease, can be glycated at lysine residues, thereby reducing αSN fibril formation in vitro and modulating αSN aggregation in cells. However, the molecular basis for these effects is unclear. To elucidate this, we investigated the aggregation of αSN modified by eight glycating agents, namely the dicarbonyl compound methylglyoxal (MGO) and the sugars ribose, fructose, mannose, glucose, galactose, sucrose, and lactose. We found that MGO and ribose modify αSN to the greatest extent, and these glycation products are the most efficient inhibitors of fibril formation. We show glycation primarily inhibits elongation rather than nucleation of αSN and has only a modest effect on the level of oligomerization. Furthermore, glycated αSN is not significantly incorporated into fibrils. For both MGO and ribose, we discovered that a level of ∼5 modifications per αSN is optimal for inhibition of elongation. The remaining sugars showed a weak but optimal inhibition at ∼2 modifications per αSN. We propose that this optimal level balances the affinity for the growing ends of the fibril (which decreases with the extent of modification) with the ability to block incorporation of subsequent αSN subunits (which increases with modification). Our results are not only relevant for other αSN PTMs but also for understanding PTMs affecting other fibrillogenic proteins and may thus open novel avenues for therapeutic intervention in protein aggregation disorders.

Our results are not only relevant for other αSN PTMs but also for understanding PTMs affecting other fibrillogenic proteins and may thus open novel avenues for therapeutic intervention in protein aggregation disorders. Glycation (also known as the Maillard reaction or nonenzymatic glycosylation) refers to a cascade of reactions between ketones or aldehydes (found in reducing sugars and other metabolites) and amino groups (1Byun K.

Advanced glycation end-products produced systemically and by macrophages: A common contributor to inflammation and degenerative diseases.Pharmacol. Ther. 2017; 177: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This starts with the formation of Amadori compounds and leads, via the formation of various intermediates, to the accumulation of a collection of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) (2Henning C. Glomb M.A. Pathways of the Maillard reaction under physiological conditions.Glycoconj. J. 2016; 33: 499-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 3Zhang Q. Ames J.M. Smith R.D. Baynes J.W.

Due to its nonenzymatic origin (which contrasts with other posttranslational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation, acetylation, or methylation), glycation does not occur at defined loci or time points. Proteins can be modified at the N terminus, Arg guanidinium groups, or Lys amino groups (5Thornalley P.J.

Myher J.J. Preparation and characterization of glucosylated aminoglycerophospholipids.Lipids. 1995; 30: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), respectively. While reducing sugars such as ribose and glucose can play a role in these processes, the most important glycating agents found in vivo are low-molecular-weight carbonyl compounds (9Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Role of oxidative stress in diabetic complications: A new perspective on an old paradigm.Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar), in particular the dicarbonyl metabolite methylglyoxal (MGO, Fig. 1A insert) (10Thornalley P.J.

Hyperglycemia, as frequently observed in diabetes, causes complications associated with protein glycation but is also associated with various neurodegenerative diseases (see below). Glycated proteins not only induce inflammation through the AGE receptors on cell surfaces but also affect protein structure and function by altering the chemical composition of the modified residues (12Vicente Miranda H. Outeiro T.F. The sour side of neurodegenerative disorders: The effects of protein glycation.J. Pathol. 2010; 221: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13Taghavi F. Habibi-Rezaei M.

Singh N. Jaggi A.S. Advanced glycation end products and diabetic complications.Korean J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2014; 18: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). For instance, albumin glycation (an inevitable consequence of high blood sugar levels) induces molten globule states (15Sattarahmady N. Moosavi-Movahedi A.A. Ahmad F. Hakimelahi G.H. Habibi-Rezaei M. Saboury A.A. Sheibani N. Formation of the molten globule-like state during prolonged glycation of human serum albumin.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 933-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and these destabilized states can more easily form amyloid-like fibrils, which in turn can act as seeds for aggregation-prone proteins like amyloid-beta (16Ferdousi M.

The intrinsically unfolded protein Alpha-synuclein (αSN) has a central role in the etiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and other diseases, collectively termed synucleinopathies. Some of these diseases are known for the accumulation of intracellular protein inclusions known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, composed, among other proteins and molecules, of aggregated αSN (17Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Alpha-synuclein in Lewy bodies.Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (5865) Google Scholar). αSN overexpression or mutations cause rare genetic forms of PD. Importantly, the most common form of PD is sporadic, without apparent changes in the levels of expression of WT αSN (18Burre J. Sharma M. Sudhof T.C. Cell biology and pathophysiology of alpha-synuclein.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2018; 8a024091Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, PD is thought to be associated with the tendency of αSN to form oligomeric and amyloid-like aggregates (19Soto C. Unfolding the role of protein misfolding in neurodegenerative diseases.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). While a definite causal relationship between the type of αSN aggregation and neurodegeneration remains controversial (20Alam P. Bousset L. Melki R.

Neurochem. 2019; 150: 522-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), it is thought that certain types of aggregated αSN species are toxic to neurons. In particular, soluble intermediate species (oligomers) are more toxic on a per-mass level than mature fibrils (21Karpinar D.P. Balija M.B. Kugler S. Opazo F. Rezaei-Ghaleh N. Wender N. Kim H.Y.

Glycation of αSN and AGE adducts has been described in the brains of PD patients, particularly the frontal cortex (24Dalfó E. Portero-Otín M. Ayala V. Martínez A. Pamplona R. Ferrer I.

AGEs have also been detected in Lewy bodies in pre-PD stages and are increased in αSN, purified from PD patients’ erythrocytes (26Munch G. Luth H.J. Wong A. Arendt T. Hirsch E. Ravid R. Riederer P.

Rep. 2017; 7: 13713Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). αSN is glycated by MGO as well as by reducing sugars such as ribose and glucose. While the glyoxalate systems with the glyoxalases Glo1 and Glo2 catabolize reactive dicarbonyls in cells, it is thought that once early and advanced glycation products are formed, they become rather stable (2Henning C. Glomb M.A. Pathways of the Maillard reaction under physiological conditions.Glycoconj. J. 2016; 33: 499-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 28Rabbani N. Thornalley P.J. Glyoxalase in diabetes, obesity and related disorders.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 22: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Since αSN is a long-lived protein with 15 lysine residues in its primary amino acid sequence, it can potentially be glycated at multiple sites over time, leading to the accumulation of a variety of early glycation products and AGEs (12Vicente Miranda H.

Moreover, glycation of aSN can result in inactivation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a glycolytic enzyme associated with neurodegenerative diseases (32Semenyuk P. Barinova K.

Several antidiabetic drugs have beneficial effects in PD patients, but the precise molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown. Recently, it was found that DJ-1 (linked to familial PD) has deglycase activity, removing MGO and glyoxal from αSN and alleviating the effects of MGO-induced aggregates of αSN in cells (34Taipa R.

Thus, it is tempting to hypothesize that glycation enhances PD-associated αSN pathology. Glycation-induced changes in aggregation is not unique for αSN (39Iannuzzi C. Irace G. Sirangelo I.

Importantly, glycated monomeric or oligomeric αSN not only does not form fibrils on its own but also prevents fibril formation of unmodified αSN. However, the molecular mechanism involved in these effects on aggregation remains unclear. Here, we examine the effects of eight different naturally occurring glycation agents on modification and fibril formation of αSN, namely MGO, the pentose sugar ribose, and the hexose sugars fructose, mannose, glucose, galactose, sucrose, and lactose. Glucose is the key energy source in living organisms and present in the millimolar range in human plasma. Ribose is a highly abundant naturally occurring sugar (100 μM in fasting serum) that is essential for every living cell, since it is a component of several biomolecules including RNA, DNA, and ATP (45Gross M. Zollner N. Serum levels of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide during long-term D-ribose administration in man.Klin. Wochenschr. 1991; 69: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fructose, a common supplement in the typical Western diet, has received much attention in the last years. Human fasted serum fructose levels are in the micromolar range and are elevated in diabetic patients (46Kawasaki T. Akanuma H. Yamanouchi T. Increased fructose concentrations in blood and urine in patients with diabetes.Diabetes Care. 2002; 25: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Lactose is the primary energy source in the first months of human life. In addition, we completed our systematic approach by including mannose, galactose, and the disaccharide sucrose. Mannose is a monosaccharide required for glycoprotein synthesis. The serum concentration of mannose is approximately 40 μM (47Sone H. Shimano H. Ebinuma H. Takahashi A. Yano Y. Iida K.T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima H. Kawakami Y. Okuda Y. Noguchi Y. Ushizawa K. Saito K. Yamada N. Physiological changes in circulating mannose levels in normal, glucose-intolerant, and diabetic subjects.Metabolism. 2003; 52: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Galactose, one of the most abundant sugars in human adult diet, is important in many metabolic processes, including glycosylation (48Conte F. van Buuringen N. Voermans N.C. Lefeber D.J. Galactose in human metabolism, glycosylation and congenital metabolic diseases: Time for a closer look.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Gen. Subj. 2021; 1865: 129898Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). MGO is clearly the most reactive species, followed by ribose, while the six other sugars show much lower levels of reactivity. This reactivity ranking is maintained when we examine the impact on aggregation of αSN. We find that glycated αSN strongly inhibits the fibril elongation step but not the initial nucleation step. The highest level of inhibition of unmodified αSN is achieved using αSN modified with around 4 to 5 MGO or ribose groups per αSN, while the remaining sugars inhibit more weakly, with their effects peaking at 2 to 3 sugars per αSN. We propose that this optimal level is caused by a trade-off between reduced binding affinity for the growing fibril ends with glycation and the increased ability to block elongation. We also suggest that this will have relevance for other types of PTMs, opening novel concepts for intervention in protein aggregation disorders. We started out by measuring the extent to which different agents glycate αSN. Recombinant human αSN was incubated with each glycating agent for 5 days at 37 °C, with constant agitation. Since several glycation products fluoresce, we monitored glycation through the increase in fluorescence at their maximum intensity at 390 nm when excited at 240 nm (Fig. S1A) (15Sattarahmady N. Moosavi-Movahedi A.A. Ahmad F. Hakimelahi G.H. Habibi-Rezaei M. Saboury A.A. Sheibani N. Formation of the molten globule-like state during prolonged glycation of human serum albumin.Biochim. Biophys.

Characterization of advanced glycation end products for biochemical studies: Side chain modifications and fluorescence characteristics.Anal. Biochem. 2005; 338: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). There was a large difference between different agents. MGO, ribose, and mannose induced a significant increase in fluorescence intensity, while the remaining five hexose sugars did not (Fig. 1A). The glycating agents alone were not fluorescent (Fig. S1B). We note that neither glycating agents nor glycated αSN are expected to interfere with the fluorescence of Thioflavin T (ThT) (excitation at 450 nm and emission at 485 nm) even after excitation at 438 nm (Fig. S1C). To investigate the kinetics of αSN glycation, we monitored the fluorescence signal over time in a plate reader over a week at 37 °C, using different concentrations of glycating agent. To minimize aggregation, samples were incubated without shaking. We subsequently confirmed, by centrifugation and A280 analysis of the supernatant of unmodified αSN, that the amount of soluble αSN was unchanged at the end of the incubation period. Furthermore, analysis by ThT fluorescence showed no fibril formation (data not shown). The fluorescence signal associated with the glycation of αSN by MGO and ribose followed an inverted exponential decay over time, while the fluorescence induced by other glycating agents showed a linear increase, indicating that the kinetics for these agents was too slow to reach a plateau within the 6 to 8 days of the experiment (Fig. S2). Rate constants obtained from the exponential decays with MGO and ribose showed a hyperbolic dependence on the concentration of glycating agent, indicating a saturation phenomenon analogous to that of the Michaelis–Menten curve in enzyme kinetics (Fig. 1, B and C). From these curves, we estimated apparent binding constants of 15 mM and 486 mM for MGO and ribose, respectively (Table 1). For the less efficient glycating agents, we only observed a linear relationship between the slopes of the plots in Fig. S2 and the concentration of the agent (Fig. 1D). Importantly, different glycating agents do not produce exactly the same fluorescent AGE products when reacting with Lys or His residues on αSN, precluding direct comparison of the raw fluorescence data (49Schmitt A. Schmitt J. Munch G. Gasic-Milencovic J. Characterization of advanced glycation end products for biochemical studies: Side chain modifications and fluorescence characteristics.Anal.

Grishina T. Frolov A. Probing protein glycation by chromatography and mass spectrometry: Analysis of glycation adducts.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017; 18: 2557Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This was also apparent in our data. When data from all agents were compared, changes in the fluorescence signal obtained with different glycating agents did not correlate directly with the changes in the extent of αSN modifications according to MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. S3). Fortunately, for each individual agent, the fluorescence signal correlated with the extent of modification. Therefore, we normalized the fluorescent data according to the extent of glycation at the end-stage of incubation for each glycating agent to be able to compare the glycation rates in different agents. To allow direct comparison between the two most efficient glycating agents, we analyzed the raw data from these modifications in the same manner as that for the less reactive agents, i.e., we determined the initial slopes of the time course of glycation by MGO and ribose from Fig. S2 and plotted them versus [MGO] and [ribose]. The slope of the initial linear part of that plot can be compared directly with the values for the other glycation agents (Table 1). Clearly, MGO was the most efficient agent, followed by ribose which shows a 30-fold lower affinity and a 32-fold lower initial rate constant. Then, there was a large gap down to the less reactive group, ranked in decreasing reactivity: mannose> glucose > galactose > lactose > fructose. Finally, sucrose had undetectable glycating activity.Table 1Kinetic parameters for αSN glycationaAll data based on fluorescence time profiles normalized by the extent of modification (see main text).Binding modeGlycating agentKD (mM)bThe rate constant for glycation kobs was obtained from exponential decays in Figure 1, B and C.

Intoxication of liver leads to accumulation of free radicals that eventually cause damage, fibrosis, cirrhosis and cancer. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ) belongs to hepatotoxin is converted to a highly reactive free radical by cytochrome P450 enzymes that causes liver damage. Plant extracts derived quercetin has substantial role in hepatoprotection. This study highlights the possible mechanism by which quercetin plays significant role in hepatoprotection. HPLC analysis revealed the abundance of quercetin in the fruit extracts of Gynocardia odorata and Diospyros malabarica , were isolated, purified and subjected to liver function analysis on Wistar rats. Post quercetin treatment improved liver function parameters in the hepatotoxic Wistar rats by augmenting bilirubin content, SGOT and SGPT activity. Gene expression profile of quercetin treated rats revealed down regulation of HGF, TIMP1 and MMP2 expressed during CCl 4 induction. In silico molecular mechanism prediction suggested that quercetin has a high affinity for cell signaling pathway proteins BCL-2, JAK2 and Cytochrome P450 Cyp2E1, which all play a significant role in CCl 4 induced hepatotoxicity. In silico molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation have shown that quercetin has a plausible affinity for major signaling proteins in liver. MMGBSA studies have revealed high binding of quercetin (ΔG) -41.48±11.02, -43.53±6.55 and -39.89±5.78 kcal/mol, with BCL-2, JAK2 and Cyp2E1, respectively which led to better stability of the quercetin bound protein complexes. Therefore, quercetin can act as potent inhibitor against CCl 4 induced hepatic injury by regulating BCL-2, JAK2 and Cyp2E1."
https://openalex.org/W4220665649,"Although capsaicin has been studied extensively as an activator of the transient receptor potential vanilloid cation channel subtype 1 (TRPV1) channels in sensory neurons, little is known about its TRPV1-independent actions in gastrointestinal health and disease. Here, we aimed to investigate the pharmacological actions of capsaicin as a food additive and medication on intestinal ion transporters in mouse models of ulcerative colitis (UC). The short-circuit current (Isc) of the intestine from WT, TRPV1-, and TRPV4-KO mice were measured in Ussing chambers, and Ca2+ imaging was performed on small intestinal epithelial cells. We also performed Western blots, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence on intestinal epithelial cells and on intestinal tissues following UC induction with dextran sodium sulfate. We found that capsaicin did not affect basal intestinal Isc but significantly inhibited carbachol- and caffeine-induced intestinal Isc in WT mice. Capsaicin similarly inhibited the intestinal Isc in TRPV1 KO mice, but this inhibition was absent in TRPV4 KO mice. We also determined that Ca2+ influx via TRPV4 was required for cholinergic signaling-mediated intestinal anion secretion, which was inhibited by capsaicin. Moreover, the glucose-induced jejunal Iscvia Na+/glucose cotransporter was suppressed by TRPV4 activation, which could be relieved by capsaicin. Capsaicin also stimulated ouabain- and amiloride-sensitive colonic Isc. Finally, we found that dietary capsaicin ameliorated the UC phenotype, suppressed hyperaction of TRPV4 channels, and rescued the reduced ouabain- and amiloride-sensitive Isc. We therefore conclude that capsaicin inhibits intestinal Cl- secretion and promotes Na+ absorption predominantly by blocking TRPV4 channels to exert its beneficial anti-colitic action."
https://openalex.org/W4220908580,"Five antibiotic resistance (AR) genes have been used to select for transgenic eukaryotic cell lines, with the BleoR, PuroR, HygR, NeoR, and BsdR cassettes conferring resistance to zeocin, puromycin, hygromycin, geneticin/G418, and blasticidin, respectively. We recently demonstrated that each AR gene establishes a distinct threshold of transgene expression below which no cell can survive, with BleoR selecting for the highest level of transgene expression, nearly ∼10-fold higher than in cells selected using the NeoR or BsdR markers. Here, we tested the hypothesis that there may be an inverse proportionality between AR protein function and the expression of linked, transgene-encoded, recombinant proteins. Specifically, we fused each AR protein to proteasome-targeting degron tags, used these to select for antibiotic-resistant cell lines, and then measured the expression of the linked, recombinant protein, mCherry, as a proxy marker of transgene expression. In each case, degron-tagged AR proteins selected for higher mCherry expression than their cognate WT AR proteins. ER50BleoR selected for the highest level of mCherry expression, greater than twofold higher than BleoR or any other AR gene. Interestingly, use of ER50BleoR as the selectable marker translated to an even higher, 3.5-fold increase in the exosomal loading of the exosomal cargo protein, CD63/Y235A. Although a putative CD63-binding peptide, CP05, has been used to decorate exosome membranes in a technology known as ""exosome painting,"" we show here that CP05 binds equally well to CD63-/- cells, WT 293F cells, and CD63-overexpressing cells, indicating that CP05 may bind membranes nonspecifically.

The formulation was characterised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetry (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) methods. The galenic SeDeM methodology was used to establish the profile of the active ingredient-excipient mixture and guarantee its suitability for producing tablets by the direct compression method. The results demonstrate that the amorphous rosuvastatin calcium tablets formulation developed made it possible to obtain cost-effective tablets by direct compression with optimal pharmacotechnical characteristics that showed a remarkable disintegration and dissolution rate.

https://openalex.org/W4226060035,"Deficiencies in Cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) lead to hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCy), which is considered a risk factor for cardiovascular, bone and neurological disease. Moreover, CBS is important for the production of cysteine, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and glutathione. Studying the biological role of CBS in adult mice has been severely hampered by embryological disturbances and perinatal mortality. To overcome these issues and assess the effects of whole-body CBS deficiency in adult mice, we engineered and characterized a Cre-inducible Cbs knockout model during ageing. No perinatal mortality occurred before Cbs−/− induction at 10 weeks of age. Mice were followed until 90 weeks of age and ablation of Cbs was confirmed in liver and kidney but not in brain. Severe HHCy was observed in Cbs−/− (289 ± 58 µM) but not in Cbs+/− or control mice (<10 µM). Cbs−/− showed impaired growth, facial alopecia, endothelial dysfunction in absence of increased mortality, and signs of liver or kidney damage. CBS expression in skin localized to sebaceous glands and epidermis, suggesting local effects of Cbs−/− on alopecia. Cbs−/− showed increased markers of oxidative stress and senescence but expression of other H2S producing enzymes (CSE and 3-MST) was not affected. CBS deficiency severely impaired H2S production capacity in liver, but not in brain or kidney. In summary, Cbs−/− mice presented a mild phenotype without mortality despite severe HHCy. The findings demonstrate that HHCy is not directly linked to development of end organ damage."

GLSF and GLS dose-dependently inhibited epidermal growth factor-induced JB6 transformation at non-toxic concentrations. SKH-1 mice which were fed with diets containing GLSF (1.25%), GLS (0.99%) or the fruiting body (GLF) (0.26%) were exposed to chronic low-dose ultraviolet (UV) radiation to assess their effects on skin carcinogenesis. GLSF, but not GLS or GLF, reduced skin tumor incidence and multiplicity. In non-tumor skin tissues of mice, GLSF attenuated UV-induced epidermal thickening, expression of Ki-67, COX-2 and NF-κB, while in tumor tissues, GLSF increased expression of CD8 and Granzyme B. To examine the effects of GLSF on UV-induced immunosuppression, mice which were fed with GLSF were evaluated for the contact hypersensitivity (CHS) response to dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB). GLSF significantly reversed UV-mediated suppression of DNFB-induced CHS by increasing CD8+ and decreasing CD4+ and FoxP3+ T-cells in mouse ears.

Aim To investigate socio-demographic factors and professional practice associated with the risk of COVID-19 among HCWs in health establishments in Normandy, France. Methods A cross-sectional and 3 case-control studies using bootstrap methods were conducted in order to explore the possible risk factors that lead to SARS-CoV2 transmission within HCWs. Case-control studies focused on risk factors associated with (a) care of COVID-19 patients, (b) care of non COVID-19 patients and (c) contacts between colleagues. Participants 2,058 respondents, respectively 1,363 (66.2%) and 695 (33.8%) in medical and medico-social establishments, including HCW with and without contact with patients. Results 301 participants (14.6%) reported having been infected by SARS-CoV2. When caring for COVID-19 patients, HCWs who declared wearing respirators, either for all patient care (ORa 0.39; 95% CI: 0.29–0.51) or only when exposed to aerosol-generating procedures (ORa 0.56; 95% CI: 0.43–0.70), had a lower risk of infection compared with HCWs who declared wearing mainly surgical masks. During care of non COVID-19 patients, wearing mainly a respirator was associated with a higher risk of infection (ORa 1.84; 95% CI: 1.06–3.37). An increased risk was also found for HCWs who changed uniform in workplace changing rooms (ORa 1.93; 95% CI: 1.63–2.29).

The PME for occurrence (PME-O) and progression (PME-P) were almost totally different at proteome composition and function. Proteins for occurrence and progression rarely overlapped and crossed. Immunity played a central role in PME-O, whereas inflammation, angiogenesis and metabolism were critical in PME-P. Proteome profiling identified three PME subtypes with different features of HCC. Thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP) was validated as an antiangiogenic target in an orthotopic HCC mouse model. Overall, the proteomic characterization of the PME revealed that the entire processes of HCC occurrence and progression differ substantially.

Pressure differentials across 2-ply materials ranged from 0.57 to > 12 mm H2O/cm2 on samples of equal surface area with 6 of 16 materials exceeding the recommended medical mask limit. Models were calibrated to predict 2-ply cotton mask FFEs and differential pressures for each fabric based on pore characteristics and fabric weight. Models indicated cotton fabrics from 6 of 9 consumer categories can produce cloth masks with adequate breathability and FFEs equivalent to a medical mask: T-shirt, fashion fabric, mass-market quilting cotton, home décor fabric, bed sheets and high-quality quilting cotton. Masks from one cloth mask and the medical mask were re-tested with a mask fitter to distinguish filtration from leakage. The fabric and medical masks had 3.7% and 41.8% leakage, respectively. These results indicate a well fitted 2-ply cotton mask with overhead ties can perform similarly to a disposable 3-ply medical mask on ear loops due primarily to the superior fit of the cloth mask which compensates for its lower material filtration efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W4220665536,"The present study investigates the influence of framing, different amounts to lose, and probabilities of a risky and sure choice option, time limits, and need on risky decision-making. For a given block of trials, participants were equipped with a personal budget (number of points). On each trial within a block, a specific initial amount is possibly taken from the budget by the outcome of a gamble or the choice of a sure loss option. The goal was to avoid losing points from the budget for not falling below a predefined need threshold. Three different levels of induced need were included. Employing a psychophysical experimental approach, we furthermore tested a sequential component of human risk behavior towards a need threshold inspired by research on animal foraging behavior. Risk-sensitivity models and the Stone-Geary framework serve as generating hypotheses on need thresholds. We found that framing, need, and probabilities influenced risky choices. Time limits and initial amounts moderated the framing effect. No sequential component was observed."
https://openalex.org/W4220765859,"The solvent accessible surface area and the solvent accessible volume are measurements commonly used in implicit solvent models to include the effect of forces exerted by solvents on the protein surfaces (or the atoms on protein surfaces). The two measurements have limitations in describing interactions between proteins (or proteins’ atoms) mediated/bridged by solvents. This is because describing the interactions between proteins should be able to capture the chain of protein-solvent-protein interactions while the solvent accessible surface area or the solvent accessible volume can capture only protein-solvent interactions. If we represent the solvent as a continuous medium, we can consider an atom of a protein can effectively interact with the solvent within a certain distance from its surface (or its own solvent-interacting sphere). In this case, the protein-solvent-protein interactions can be measured by the amount of solvent interacting with two proteins’ atoms at the same time (or the volume shared by the two atoms’ solvent-interacting spheres excluding the volumes occupied by proteins’ atoms). We call the shared volume as the common solvent accessible volume (CSAV); there has been no method developed to determine the CSAV. In this work, we propose a new sweep-line-based method that efficiently calculates the common solvent accessible volume. The performance and accuracy of the proposed sweep-line-based method are compared with those of the naïve voxel-based method. The proposed method takes log-linear time to the number of atoms involved in a CSAV calculation and linear time to the resolution. Our results, tested with 52 protein structures of various sizes, show that the proposed sweep-line-based method is superior to the voxel-based method in both computational efficiency and accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W4220818367,"The dexterity and affordability of gene-editing technologies promise wide-ranging applications in agriculture. Aiming to take advantage of this, proponents emphasize benefits such as the climate-mitigating promises of gene editing. Critics, on the other hand, argue that gene editing will perpetuate industrialized forms of agriculture and its concomitant environmental and social problems. Across a representative sample of US and Canadian residents (n = 1478), we investigate public views and perceptions of agricultural gene editing. We advance existing survey-based studies, which tend to focus on whether knowledge, familiarity, trust, or perceptions of naturalness predict views on gene editing. Instead, we examine whether broader societal concerns about industrialized food systems-a key claim about genetic engineering launched by critics-predicts comfort with gene editing. We also explore the predictive power of views of climate change as an urgent problem, following proponent arguments. Survey results explore gene editing views in reference to specific cases (e.g., drought-tolerant wheat) and specific alternatives (e.g., versus pesticide use). We find that people critical of industrialized food systems were most likely to express overall absolute opposition to the technology, whereas those concerned with the imminence of climate change were more likely to support climate-relevant gene editing. Our findings suggest the need for further research into the conditions upon which public groups find gene editing compelling or not-namely, if applications enhance or counter industrial food systems, or offer particular climate adaptive benefits. Furthermore, we argue that attention to broader societal priorities in surveys of perceptions may help address calls for responsible research and innovation as concerns gene editing."
https://openalex.org/W4220842927,"This paper investigates the extent to which in-utero exposure to droughts influences the health outcomes of Bangladeshi children in early childhood. Exploiting the plausibly exogenous deviations of rainfall from the location-specific norms, we find that deficient rainfall during the prenatal period is harmful to child health. Specifically, in-utero exposure to droughts decreases the height-for-age, weight-for-height, and weight-for-age z-scores by 0.10, 0.11, and 0.11 standard deviations among children under five years old, respectively. Our heterogeneity analyses reveal that the adverse health setbacks fall disproportionately on children of disadvantaged backgrounds. Exploring the differential effects by trimesters of exposure, we further show that experiencing droughts during the second and the third trimesters leaves injurious effects on early childhood health."
https://openalex.org/W4220881255,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a lethal cancer of bile duct epithelial cells with a high mortality rate and limited therapeutic options. An effective treatment is, therefore, urgently needed to improve treatment outcomes for these patients. To develop a new therapeutic option, we engineered T cells secreting αCD133-αCD3 bispecific T-cell engager and evaluated their antitumor effects against CD133-expressing CCA cells. The cDNA encoding αCD133-αCD3 bispecific T-cell engager (αCD133-αCD3-ENG) was cloned into pCDH lentiviral construct and its expression was tested in Lenti-X 293T cells. T cells from healthy donors were then transduced with engineered lentiviruses to create T cells secreting αCD133-αCD3 engager to evaluate their antitumor activities. The average transduction efficiency into T cells was approximately 60.03±21.65%. In the co-culture system containing T cells secreting αCD133-αCD3 engager (as effector cells) and mWasabi-luciferase-expressing CCA cells (KKU-100 and KKU-213A; as target cells), the effector T cells exhibited significantly higher cytolytic activities against the target CCA cells (49.0±9.76% and 64.10±13.18%, respectively) than those observed against the untransduced T cells (10.97±10.65%; p = 0.0103 and 9.80±11.05%; p = 0.0054) at an effector-to-target ratio of 5:1. In addition, the secreted αCD133-αCD3 engager significantly redirected both transduced T cells and bystander T cells to kill the target CCA cells (up to 73.20±1.68%; p &lt;0.05). Moreover, the transduced and bystander T cells could kill the target CCA spheroids at a rate approximately 5-fold higher than that of the no treatment control condition ( p = 0.0011). Our findings demonstrate proof-of-principle that T cells secreting αCD133-αCD3 engager can be an alternative approach to treating CD133-positive CCA, and they pave the way for future in vivo study and clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W4220968578,"The pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) resides in human macrophages, wherein it exploits host lipids for survival. However, little is known about the interaction between M.tb and macrophage plasmalogens, a subclass of glycerophospholipids with a vinyl ether bond at the sn-1 position of the glycerol backbone. Lysoplasmalogens, produced from plasmalogens by hydrolysis at the sn-2 carbon by phospholipase A2, are potentially toxic but can be broken down by host lysoplasmalogenase, an integral membrane protein of the YhhN family that hydrolyzes the vinyl ether bond to release a fatty aldehyde and glycerophospho-ethanolamine or glycerophospho-choline. Curiously, M.tb encodes its own YhhN protein (MtbYhhN), despite having no endogenous plasmalogens. To understand the purpose of this protein, the gene for MtbYhhN (Rv1401) was cloned and expressed in Mycobacterium smegmatis (M.smeg). We found the partially purified protein exhibited abundant lysoplasmalogenase activity specific for lysoplasmenylethanolamine or lysoplasmenylcholine (pLPC) (Vmax∼15.5 μmol/min/mg; Km∼83 μM). Based on cell density, we determined that lysoplasmenylethanolamine, pLPC, lysophosphatidylcholine, and lysophosphatidylethanolamine were not toxic to M.smeg cells, but pLPC and LPC were highly toxic to M.smeg spheroplasts, which are cell wall-deficient mycobacterial forms. Importantly, spheroplasts prepared from M.smeg cells overexpressing MtbYhhN were protected from membrane disruption/lysis by pLPC, which was rapidly depleted from the media. Finally, we found that overexpression of full-length MtbYhhN in M.smeg increased its survival within human macrophages by 2.6-fold compared to vector controls. These data support the hypothesis that MtbYhhN protein confers a growth advantage for mycobacteria in macrophages by cleaving toxic host pLPC into potentially energy-producing products."
https://openalex.org/W3102738528,"Soluble B and T lymphocyte attenuator (sBTLA) has been shown to be associated with severity and outcome, in critically ill septic patients. We aimed to assess the dynamic expression of sBTLA, as a prognostic biomarker of long-term mortality in patients with bloodstream infection (BSI) and sepsis, and to evaluate its association with biomarkers indicative of inflammation and immune dysregulation. Secondarily, sBTLA was evaluated in association with severity and bacterial etiology. Patients with BSI (n = 108) were prospectively included, and serially sampled from admission to day 28. Blood and plasma donors (n = 31), sampled twice 28 days apart, served as controls. sBTLA concentration in plasma was determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Associations between sBTLA on day 1–2 and 7, and mortality at 90 days and 1 year, were determined with unadjusted, and adjusted Cox regression. Differences related to severity was assessed with linear regression. Mixed model was used to assess sBTLA dynamics over time, and sBTLA associations with bacterial etiology and other biomarkers. sBTLA on day 1–2 and 7 was associated with mortality, in particular failure to normalize sBTLA by day 7 was associated with an increased risk of death before day 90, adjusted HR 17 (95% CI 1.8–160), and one year, adjusted HR 15 (95% CI 2.8–76). sBTLA was positively associated with CRP, and negatively with lymphocyte count. sBTLA on day 1–2 was not linearly associated with baseline SOFA score increase. High SOFA (≥4) was however associated with higher mean sBTLA than SOFA ≤3. sBTLA was not associated with bacterial etiology. We show that sustained elevation of sBTLA one week after hospital admission is associated with late mortality in patients with BSI and sepsis, and that sBTLA concentration is associated with CRP and decreased lymphocyte count. This suggests that sBTLA might be an indicator of sustained immune-dysregulation, and a prognostic tool in sepsis."

https://openalex.org/W4220724551,"Domain of Unknown Function 89 (DUF89) proteins are metal-dependent phosphohydrolases. Exemplary DUF89 enzymes differ in their metal and phosphosubstrate preferences. Here, we interrogated the activities and structures of two DUF89 paralogs from fission yeast-Duf89 and Duf8901. We find that Duf89 and Duf8901 are cobalt/nickel-dependent phosphohydrolases adept at hydrolyzing p-nitrophenylphosphate and PPi. Crystal structures of metal-free Duf89 and Co2+-bound Duf8901 disclosed two enzyme conformations that differed with respect to the position of a three-helix module, which is either oriented away from the active site in Duf89 or forms a lid over the active site in Duf8901. Lid closure results in a 16 Å movement of Duf8901 Asp195, vis-à-vis Asp199 in Duf89, that brings Asp195 into contact with an octahedrally coordinated cobalt. Reaction of Duf8901 with BeCl2 and NaF in the presence of divalent cations Co2+, Ni2+, or Zn2+ generated covalent Duf8901-(Asp248)-beryllium trifluoride (BeF3)•Co2+, Duf8901-(Asp248)-BeF3•Ni2+, or Duf8901-(Asp248)-BeF3•Zn2+ adducts, the structures of which suggest a two-step catalytic mechanism via formation and hydrolysis of an enzyme-(aspartyl)-phosphate intermediate. Alanine mutations of Duf8901 Asp248, Asn249, Lys401, Asp286, and Asp195 that interact with BeF3•Co2+ squelched p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity. A 1.8 Å structure of a Duf8901-(Asp248)-AlF4-OH2•Co2+ transition-state mimetic suggests an associative mechanism in which Asp195 and Asp363 orient and activate the water nucleophile. Whereas deletion of the duf89 gene elicited a phenotype in which expression of phosphate homeostasis gene pho1 was derepressed, deleting duf8901 did not, thereby hinting that the DUF89 paralogs have distinct functional repertoires in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W4220731724,"Glucokinase activators are regarded as potent candidates for diabetes treatment, however, in clinical studies on patients with type 2 diabetes, a diminishing efficacy was observed after chronic treatment with them. The mechanism of this reduction has not been elucidated, and whether it is a class effect of glucokinase activators remains inconclusive. Here, we firstly identified a diabetic animal model that shows the diminished efficacy after long-term treatment with MK-0941, a glucokinase activator that exhibited diminished efficacy in a clinical study, and we analyzed the mechanism underlying its diminished efficacy. In addition, we evaluated the long-term efficacy of another glucokinase activator, TMG-123. Goto-Kakizaki rats were treated with MK-0941 and TMG-123 for 24 weeks. The results showed that glycated hemoglobin A1C levels and plasma glucose levels decreased transiently but increased over time with the continuation of treatment in the MK-0941-treated group, while decreased continuously in the TMG-123-treated group. Only in the TMG-123-treated group, higher plasma insulin levels were shown at the later stage of the treatment period. For the mechanism analysis, we conducted a hepatic enzyme assay and liver perfusion study in Goto-Kakizaki rats after chronic treatment with MK-0941 and TMG-123, and revealed that, only in the MK-0941-treated group, the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase was increased, and hepatic glucose utilization was decreased compared to the non-treated group. These data indicate that disruptions in hepatic glucose metabolism are involved in the diminished efficacy of glucokinase activators."
https://openalex.org/W4220841190,"Duration is a key component in the design of training activities in sport which aim to enhance athlete skills and physical qualities. Training duration is often a balance between reaching skill development and physiological targets set by practitioners. This study aimed to exemplify change point time-series analyses to inform training activity duration in Australian Football. Five features of player behaviour were included in the analyses: disposal frequency, efficiency, pressure, possession time and player movement velocity. Results of the analyses identified moments of change which may be used to inform minimum or maximum activity durations, depending on a practitioner’s objectives. In the first approach, a univariate analysis determined change points specific to each feature, allowing practitioners to evaluate activities according to a single metric. In contrast, a multivariate analysis considered interactions between features and identified a single change point, reflecting the moment of overall change during activities. Six iterations of a training activity were also evaluated resulting in common change point locations, between 196 and 252 seconds, which indicated alterations to player behaviour between this time period in the training activities conduction. Comparisons of feature segments before and after change points revealed the extent to which player behaviour changed and can guide such duration decisions. These methods can be used to evaluate athlete behaviour and inform training activity durations."

https://openalex.org/W4221066836,"Studying ecosystem dynamics is critical to monitoring and managing linked systems of humans and nature. Due to the growth of tools and techniques for collecting data, information on the condition of these systems is more widely available. While there are a variety of approaches for mining and assessing data, there is a need for methods to detect latent characteristics in ecosystems linked to temporal and spatial patterns of change. Resilience-based approaches have been effective at not only identifying environmental change but also providing warning in advance of critical transitions in social-ecological systems (SES). In this study, we examine the usefulness of one such method, Fisher Information (FI) for spatiotemporal analysis. FI is used to assess patterns in data and has been established as an effective tool for capturing complex system dynamics to include regimes and regime shifts. We employed FI to assess the biophysical condition of eighty-five Swedish lakes from 1996-2018. Results showed that FI captured spatiotemporal changes in the Swedish lakes and identified distinct spatial patterns above and below the Limes Norrlandicus, a hard ecotone boundary which separates northern and southern ecoregions in Sweden. Further, it revealed that spatial variance changed approaching this boundary. Our results demonstrate the utility of this resilience-based approach for spatiotemporal and spatial regimes analyses linked to monitoring and managing critical watersheds and waterbodies impacted by accelerating environmental change."

Furthermore, the identity of religious groups and the localized characteristics of their behavioral practices continue to dominate the evolution of religious places. Therefore, this study analyzed the spatio-temporal patterns of Christian activity places, and further studied the characteristics and mechanisms of various influencing factors on the spatial distribution of places using a geographically weighted regression model from a socio-spatial perspective. The following results were obtained: (1) Christian activity places form a distribution pattern of circling aggregation within the core area and polycentric dispersion outside the core area. There is a certain coupling relationship between spatio-temporal patterns of places and marketization in Yiwu City. (2) The spatial differentiation pattern of influencing factors has an obvious circle-layer characteristic. The regression coefficients of population mobility, age structure, public services, and jobs-housing space are larger, and social structure and spatial resource allocation are becoming the main driving forces of spatial differentiation. (3) Due to the differences in spatial resource allocation and believers' behavioral choices, the above factors have distinct differences in urban core areas, urban-rural transition areas and rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W4220653337,"Pearl color is an important factor influencing pearl value, and is affected by the nacre color of the shell in Hyriopsis cumingii. Coproporphyrinogen-III oxidase (CPOX) is a key enzyme in porphyrin synthesis, and porphyrins are involved in color formation in different organisms, including in the nacre color of mussels. In this study, a CPOX gene (HcCPOX) was identified from H. cumingii, and its amino acid sequence was found to contain a coprogen-oxidase domain. HcCPOX mRNA was expressed widely in the tissues of white and purple mussels, and the highest expression was found in the gill, followed by the fringe mantle. The expression of HcCPOX in all tissues of purple mussels (except in the middle mantle) was higher than that of white mussels. Strong hybridization signals for HcCPOX were observed in the dorsal epithelial cells of the outer fold of the mantle. The activity of CPOX in the gill, fringe mantle, and foot of purple mussels was significantly higher than that in white mussels. Moreover, the expression of HcCPOX and CPOX activity were decreased in RNA interference experiments. The findings indicate that HcCPOX might contributes to nacre color formation in H. cumingii by being involved in porphyrin synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W4220662582,"Background Angiogenic growth mediators (AGMs) and oxidative stress (OS) both play essential roles in normal placental vascular development and as such, placental alterations in these factors contribute to pre-eclampsia (PE). Suboptimal health status (SHS), an intermediate between health and disease, has been associated with imbalanced AGMs and OS biomarkers. Thus, SHS pregnant women may be at increased risk of developing PE and may present abnormal placental alteration and expression of AGMs and OS compared to optimal health status (OHS) pregnant women. We examined the histopathological morphology, immunohistochemical expression of AGMs antibodies and oxidative DNA damage marker in the placentae of SHS and OHS pregnant women who developed early-onset PE (EO-PE) and late-onset (LO-PE) compared to normotensive pregnancy (NTN-P). Methods This nested case-control study recruited 593 singleton normotensive pregnant women at baseline (10–20 weeks gestation) from the Ghanaian Suboptimal Health Status Cohort Study (GHOACS) undertaken at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Ghana. Socio-demographic, clinical and obstetrics data were collected, and a validated SHS questionnaire-25 (SHSQ-25) was used in classifying participants into SHS (n = 297) and OHS (n = 296). Participants were followed until the time of PE diagnosis and delivery (32–42 weeks gestation). Blood samples were collected at the two-time points and were assayed for AGMs; soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), placental growth factor (PIGF), vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), and soluble endoglin (sEng), and OS biomarkers; 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 8-epiprostaglandinF2-alpha (8- epi-PGF2α) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) using ELISA. Placental samples were collected for histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Results Of the 593 pregnant women, 498 comprising 248 SHS and 250 OHS women returned for delivery and were included in the final analysis. Of the 248 SHS women, 56, 97 and 95 developed EO-PE, LO-PE and NTN-P, respectively, whereas 14, 30 and 206 of the 250 OHS mothers developed EO-PE, LO-PE and NTN-P, respectively. At baseline, SHS_NTN pregnant women had a significant imbalance in AGMs and OS biomarkers compared to OHS_NTN pregnant women (p&lt;0.0001). At the time of PE diagnosis, SHS_NTN-P women who developed EO-PE, LO-PE, and NTN-P had lower serum levels of P1GF, VEGF-A and TAC and correspondingly higher levels of sEng, sFlt-1, 8-epiPGF2α, and 8-OHdG than OHS-NTN-P women who developed EO-PE and LO-PE, NTN-P ( p &lt;0.0001). A reduced placental size, increased foetal/placental weight ratio, and a significantly higher proportion of fibrinoid necrosis, infarction, villous fibrin, syncytial knots, calcification, chorangiosis, tunica media/vascular wall hypertrophy and chorioamnionitis was associated with the SHS group who developed PE (EO-PE&gt;LO-PE) more than OHS groups who developed PE (EO-PE&gt;LO-PE) when all were compared to NTN-P ( p &lt;0.0001). The intensity of antibody expression of PIGF and VEGF-A were significantly reduced, whereas Flt-1, Eng and 8-OHdG were significantly increased in placentae from SHS-pregnant women who developed EO-PE&gt;LO-PE more than OHS- pregnant women who developed EO-PE&gt;LO-PE when all were compared to NTN-P ( p &lt;0.0001). Conclusion Increased lesions, oxidative DNA damage, and imbalanced expression between pro-and anti-AGMs are associated more with SHS-embodied PE placentae rather than OHS-embodied PE subtypes, thus potentially allowing differential evaluation of PE."

https://openalex.org/W4220747772,"The evolution of biochemical models is difficult to track. At present, it is not possible to inspect the differences between model versions at the network level. Biochemical models are often constructed in a distributed, non-linear process: collaborators create model versions on different branches from novel information, model extensions, during curation and adaption. To discuss and align the versions, it is helpful to abstract the changes to the network level. The differences between two model versions can be detected by the software tool BiVeS. However, it cannot show the structural changes resulting from the differences. Here, we present a method to visualise the differences between model versions effectively. We developed a JSON schema to communicate the differences at the network level and extended BiVeS accordingly. Additionally, we developed DiVil, a web-based tool to represent the model and the differences as a standardised network using D3. It combines an automatic layout with an interactive user interface to improve the visualisation and to inspect the model. The network can be exported in standardised formats as images or markup language. Our method communicates the structural differences between model versions. It facilitates the discussion of changes and thus supports the collaborative and non-linear nature of model development.

https://openalex.org/W4220782253,"The genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF) results when mutations in the gene for the anion channel CFTR reduce CFTR's activity below a critical level. CFTR activity = N·PO·γ (number of channels x open probability x channel conductance). Small molecules are now available that partially restore CFTR function with dramatic improvements in health of CF subjects. Continued evaluation of these and other compounds in development will be aided by accurate assessments of CFTR function. However, measuring CFTR activity in vivo is challenging and estimates vary widely. The most accurate known measure of CFTR activity in vivo is the 'β/M' ratio of sweat rates, which is produced by stimulation with a β-adrenergic agonist cocktail referenced to the same individual's methacholine-stimulated sweat rate. The most meaningful metric of CFTR activity is to express it as a percent of normal function, so it is critical to establish β/M carefully in a population of healthy control subjects. Here, we analyze β/M from a sample of 50 healthy adults in which sweat rates to cholinergic and β-adrenergic agonists were measured repeatedly (3 times) in multiple, (~50) identified sweat glands from each individual (giving ~20,000 measurements). The results show an approximately 7-fold range, 26-187% of the WT average set to 100%. These provide a benchmark against which other measures of CFTR activity can be compared.
