https://openalex.org/W2081910903,"Genetic control elements are usually situated in local regions of chromatin that are hypersensitive to structural probes such as DNase I. We have reconstructed the chromatin structure of the hsp70 promoter using an in vitro nucleosome assembly system. Binding of the GAGA transcription factor on existing nucleosomes leads to nucleosome disruption, DNase I hypersensitivity at the TATA box and heat-shock elements, and rearrangement of adjacent nucleosomes. ATP hydrolysis facilitates this process, suggesting that an energy-dependent pathway is involved in chromatin remodelling."

https://openalex.org/W1602112219,"The Escherichia coli heat shock proteins DnaK and DnaJ function cooperatively as molecular chaperones. Central to their biochemical functions is the ability of DnaJ to interact with DnaK and to stimulate its ATPase activity. Here, we report the genetic isolation of dnaJ12, which has a nonsense mutation at codon 109, yet was able to support lambda growth at 30 degrees C. The 12-kDa DnaJ12 protein was purified to homogeneity and shown to be active in an in vitro lambda-DNA replication system and to be capable of stimulating DnaK's ATPase activity, specifically at the step of ATP hydrolysis. The previously well studied and characterized dnaJ259 mutation was also cloned and sequenced, revealing a single His-->Gln amino acid change at codon 33. The purified DnaJ259 protein was inactive in an in vitro lambda-DNA replication system and was unable to stimulate DnaK's ATPase activity. Consistent with this, an NH2-terminal deletion of the first 34 amino acids or an Asp insertion at residue 35 of DnaJ resulted in a protein that completely lacked DnaJ activity. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the highly conserved NH2-terminal region of DnaJ, the so-called J region, is necessary and sufficient for stimulating both DnaK's ATPase activity and lambda-DNA replication. These results may be applicable to other eukaryotic proteins that contain this conserved J domain as proteins that interact and stimulate the hydrolysis of ATP by their cognate HSP70 proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1554913126,"Calcium binding to regulatory sites located in the NH2-terminal domain of troponin C (TnC) induces a conformational change that blocks the inhibitory action of troponin I (TnI) and triggers muscle contraction. We used deletion mutants of TnI in conjunction with a series of TnC mutants to understand the structural and functional relationship between different TnI regions and TnC domains. Our results indicate that TnI is organized into structural and regulatory regions which interact in an antiparallel fashion with the corresponding structural and regulatory regions of TnC. Functional studies show that the COOH-terminal region of TnI, when linked to the inhibitory region (TnI103-182) can regulate actomyosin ATPase. A TnI lacking the first 57 amino acids (TnId57) has been shown to have similar properties (Sheng, Z., Pan, B.-S., Miller, T. E., and Potter, J. D. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 25407-25413). Regulation was not observed with the COOH-terminal region alone (TnI120-182), with the NH2-terminal region alone (TnI1-98), or with the NH2-terminal linked to the inhibitory region (TnI1-116). Binding studies show that the NH2-terminal region of TnI interacts with the COOH-terminal domain of TnC in the presence of Ca2+ or Mg2+ and that the inhibitory plus COOH-terminal region of TnI (TnI103-182) interacts with the NH2-terminal domain of TnC in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Based on these results we propose a model for the Ca(2+)-induced conformational change. In our model the NH2-terminal domain of TnI is anchored strongly to the COOH-terminal domain of TnC in the absence and presence of Ca2+ while the inhibitory and COOH-terminal regions of TnI switch between actin-tropomyosin in the absence of Ca2+ to binding sites in both NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of TnC in the presence of Ca2+."

https://openalex.org/W1516576268,"To identify cellular factors that assist in membrane protein biogenesis, we looked for mutants affected in the stop transfer anchoring process. Using a SecY-PhoA fusion protein in which alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) mature sequence is attached to the last cytoplasmic domain following the 10th transmembrane segment of SecY, we isolated a mutation (std101) that allowed significant export of the PhoA moiety across the membrane. The mutation did not cause nonspecific leakage of cytoplasmic proteins. The mutation was identified as a single base change in the ftsH gene, causing an amino acid substitution in the proposed periplasmic region of FtsH, a putative membrane-bound ATPase. In addition, the ftsH1 temperature-sensitive mutation caused a similar phenotype. Disruption of the chromosomal ftsH in combination with a lac promoter-controlled copy of ftsH on a plasmid rendered the cell viability dependent on lac induction. Repression of this system resulted in a strong Std phenotype as well as significant export defects of beta-lactamase and OmpA. Thus, the loss of ftsH function enhances translocation of normally anchored protein segments and retards that of normally translocated proteins. These results suggest that FtsH participates in assembly of proteins into and through the membrane. It is needed for the cell to assure efficient stop-transfer of some transmembrane proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1667331074,"The promoter of the human Ha-ras gene is very GC-rich, has four Sp1-binding sites and no TATA element. Transcription initiates at multiple start sites spread over a 90-base pair region, with a major cluster between +1 and +11. We detected the binding of a HeLa nuclear protein to the region from +6 to +20, a region which overlaps the major cluster and includes nine start sites within its boundaries. When part of this region was mutated, the nine start sites were abolished, so the region may be an initiator. The regulatory elements of the promoter have no differential effect on start site usage. But Sp1 bound to GCIV located at -38 acts as a start site selector, increasing the activity of the start sites from +1 downstream but not the upstream sites at -31, -21, and -10. When spacers of increasing length were inserted 3' to GCIV, the major cluster dwindled, and the upstream sites became strong sites, first the one at -10 and then the one at -21. Thus start sites were strongest when put into an Sp1-selected locus 36 to 53 base pairs downstream from GCIV and weak when outside this locus. The start sites with these properties may be due to initiators."
https://openalex.org/W1778137154,"The TrkB receptor protein-tyrosine kinase is a receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3. In response to brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 treatment, TrkB expressed exogenously in Rat-2 cells is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. At least 2 regions of TrkB contain phosphorylated tyrosines. The major sites of autophosphorylation are in the region containing Tyr-670, Tyr-674, and Tyr-675, which lies in the kinase domain and corresponds by sequence homology to the Tyr-416 autophosphorylation site in p60c-Src. Tyr-785, which lies just to the COOH-terminal side of the kinase domain in a relatively short tail characteristic of the Trk family of protein-tyrosine kinase receptors, is also phosphorylated in response to neurotrophin-3 treatment. The sequence around Tyr-785 fits a consensus sequence for binding phospholipase C-gamma 1. The simplest interpretation of these results is that, in response to neurotrophin binding, at least two and perhaps all three of the tyrosines in the Tyr-670/674/675 region are autophosphorylated independently, and Tyr-785 is autophosphorylated in vivo. Following activation of TrkB, phospholipase C-gamma 1 is phosphorylated on Tyr-783, Tyr-771, and Tyr-1254. Phospholipase C-gamma 1 also forms a complex with TrkB in response to neurotrophin-3 treatment, consistent with the possibility that one of the TrkB autophosphorylation sites provides a binding site for the phospholipase C-gamma 1 SH2 domains, as is the case for other receptor protein-tyrosine kinases. We conclude that phospholipase C-gamma 1 is directly phosphorylated by TrkB. Since phosphorylation of Tyr-783 and Tyr-1254 results in activation of phospholipase C-gamma 1, we predict that neurotrophin-3 leads to activation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 following binding to TrkB in Rat-2 cells."

https://openalex.org/W1490670694,"G protein gamma-subunits are isoprenylated and carboxyl-methylated at the C-terminal cysteine, which is indispensable for the function of photoreceptor G protein transducin (T alpha beta gamma). However, the physiological role of the methylation and its reversibility have been unclear. Here we isolated methylated and non-methylated forms of farnesylated T beta gamma, and demonstrated that the methylation remarkably facilitates not only the membrane association of T beta gamma but also the subunit interaction between T alpha and T beta gamma. Consequently, the functional coupling of transducin with light-activated receptor, metarhodopsin II, was stabilized by the methylation, resulting in acceleration of GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio) triphosphate) binding to T alpha. An examination of the reversibility of the methylation suggested that T gamma is kept fully methylated in rod outer segments. These observations indicate that the methylation of T gamma plays an important role in the most efficient photon-signal transduction process in rod cells."

https://openalex.org/W1530646247,"The MLA 144 gibbon T cell line is infected with a type C retrovirus and constitutively expresses interleukin-2 (IL-2) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). IL-2 mRNA levels are 10-fold more abundant than GM-CSF in these cells. Comparable transcriptional rates for these lymphokines suggested the involvement of post-transcriptional mechanisms in selective IL-2 mRNA accumulation. IL-2 mRNA is exceptionally stable in MLA cells with a t1/2 of more than 8 h. The presence of reiterated AUUUA sequences in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) has been shown to confer mRNA lability. The provirally altered MLA IL-2 allele encodes an mRNA in which three AUUUA motifs have been deleted. Six major cytoplasmic proteins bound in vitro transcribed RNA probes containing sequences from the 3'-UTR of normal human IL-2 (3'-IL-2), GM-CSF (delta 2R1), and the virally altered MLA IL-2 (3'-IL-2 PV) mRNA. Increased binding of these proteins to 3'-IL-2 PV was observed relative to 3'-IL-2 or delta 2R1. Northwestern blotting demonstrated similar differential ability of a 36- and 43-kDa protein to bind, as well as showed that these proteins colocalized by immunoblotting as hnRNP A1 and C, respectively. These findings suggest a direct correlation between differential binding of cytoplasmic proteins to AU-rich 3'-UTRs in vitro and lymphokine mRNA stability in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1503148643,"The cellular function of annexin IV was evaluated by correlating tissue expression, cellular localization, and whole-cell electrophysiology. Immunolocalization and biochemical data demonstrate that annexin IV is concentrated along the apical membranes of many epithelia. Introduction of purified exogenous annexin IV into colonic T84 cells through a patch pipette specifically prevented Ca(2+)-dependent Cl- current activation. Affinity-purified antibody against annexin IV applied in the same manner enhanced the activation. Reduction of the endogenous level of annexin IV with a derivatized oligodeoxynucleotide antisense to annexin IV mRNA lowered the threshold for the Ca(2+)-induced current response, mimicking the enhancement of current activation exerted by anti-annexin IV antibody. The inhibitory effect of annexin IV on Ca(2+)-dependent Cl- conductance represents a novel mechanism by which Ca(2+)-binding proteins modulate membrane channel activity."

https://openalex.org/W1556382982,"The small prohead RNA (pRNA) of the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage phi 29 is essential for ATP-dependent packaging of viral DNA. The 174-, 124-, and 120-residue forms of pRNA produced in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase were equivalent in prohead binding and DNA packaging activity to pRNAs produced in phi 29-infected cells. pRNA binding to proheads, characterized by the use of Northern hybridization and filter binding assays, was specific, rapid, and irreversible in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+. Proheads produced in phage-infected cells carried 5.8 +/- 2.7 copies of pRNA, and proheads assembled in Escherichia coli in the absence of pRNA bound 6.0 +/- 3.5 copies of pRNA. Footprints of proheads on pRNA generated with the ribonucleases A, T1, and V1 showed that nucleotides 22-84, 5' to 3', were protected from ribonuclease attack. Enhanced cleavage at nucleotides 37-40 with ribonuclease V1 suggested a conformational change of pRNA upon prohead binding."
https://openalex.org/W1587622948,"EPR spectra attributed to the redox active tyrosine residues on the oxidizing side of photosystem II (TyrZ and TyrD) have almost identical line shapes, although the tyrosyl radicals differ in stability and redox characteristics. Strongly modified spectra of oxidized TyrD in site-directed mutants in a histidine residue, H189 on the D2 reaction center protein in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803, support a structural model where H189 interacts closely, probably via a hydrogen bond, to TyrD (Tommos, C., Davidsson, L., Svensson, B., Madsen, C., Vermass, W., and Styring, S. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 5436-5441). To determine whether TyrZ and the corresponding histidine on the D1 protein (D1-H190) interacts similarly, we have generated His-Phe (H190F) and His-Tyr (H190Y) mutations in the C2 symmetry related H190 residue on the D1 reaction center protein by site-directed mutagenesis in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The H190F and H190Y mutants assemble photosystem II reaction centers capable of primary photochemistry but unable to oxidize water. We have obtained kinetic spectra of a flash-induced transient EPR signal that we assign to oxidized TyrZ in the D1-H190 mutants. The spectra are identical in line width (18-20 G) and hyperfine structure to the wild-type spectrum from oxidized TyrZ and exhibit decay kinetics (t 1/2 approximately 500 ms) typical for the TyrZ radical in managenese-depleted photosystem II membranes. However, both TyrZ and TyrD were oxidized with reduced (10-15%) quantum yield in these mutants, indicating that the kinetics of electron donation to P+680 were significantly modified as a result of the mutation. Thus, the altered kinetics of TyrZ in the mutants suggest that there is an interaction between TyrZ and His-190 on the D1 protein. However, unlike the situation on the D2 side, the presence of a hydrogen bond between TyrZ and H190 on the D1 protein is improbable."
https://openalex.org/W1521689319,"The ruvC gene has been cloned into the plasmid pT7-7 under the control of the T7 phi 10 promoter. Following induction with isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside, the 19-kDa RuvC protein was overexpressed to 20-30% of total cell protein. RuvC has been purified to homogeneity by a simple procedure involving precipitation from the crude lysate, followed by three chromatographic steps. The purified protein resolves synthetic Holliday junctions (60 nucleotides in length) by cleavage at the 3'-side of a phosphate group, to produce nicked duplex DNA. Under the same conditions no cleavage of linear duplex or single-stranded DNA was detected. However, low levels of cleavage were observed with supercoiled form I and single-stranded circular DNA substrates, consistent with the interaction of RuvC with secondary structures. Using synthetic Holliday junctions, we show that RuvC-mediated resolution requires Mg2+ (10 mM) and exhibits an alkaline pH optimum (pH 9.0). No energy cofactors are needed. When RuvC was analyzed by gel filtration and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, monomeric and dimeric forms of the protein were observed."
https://openalex.org/W1576786159,"Zymogen granules of the exocrine pancreas are the secretory organelles responsible for the regulated secretion of digestive enzymes. Several proteins are associated with or are integral components of the lipid bilayer that forms the zymogen granule membrane. These proteins likely represent important components in the regulated secretion of digestive enzymes. VAMPs (vesicle-associated membrane proteins)/synaptobrevins are a family of 18-kDa integral membrane proteins originally characterized in synaptic vesicles. Polyclonal antisera raised against either a VAMP/glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein or rat brain synaptic vesicles, detected an 18-kDa immunoreactive protein in zymogen granule membranes that co-migrates electrophorectically with rat brain synaptic vesicle VAMP. Rat brain synaptic vesicle VAMP was detected by both antisera. Botulinum-B toxin treatment of zymogen granule membranes did not result in cleavage of zymogen granule membrane VAMP, indicating that exocrine pancreatic VAMP is either VAMP1 or a novel VAMP-isoform. Immunofluorescent studies demonstrated that exocrine pancreatic VAMP localized with GP2, a zymogen granule membrane protein, to the apical region of pancreatic acinar cells. No significant labeling was observed in basolateral regions of pancreatic acinar cells. These results establish the presence of a VAMP protein in the zymogen granule of the rat pancreas and suggest that VAMPs have a role in exocrine secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1521655014,"Complexes of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) with phospholipids are known to induce cholesterol efflux from cells. In a cholesteryl ester accumulation system in which rat peritoneal macrophages were incubated with acetylated low density lipoprotein (acetyl-LDL) and either dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine complexes (DMPC/apoA-I) or native high density lipoprotein (HDL), DMPC/apoA-I exhibited a much stronger effect than native HDL in preventing cholesteryl ester accumulation. The mechanism for this phenomenon was investigated in the present study. After 18 h incubation with DMPC/apoA-I in a cell-free system, acetyl-LDL was re-isolated from DMPC/apoA-I by Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration chromatography. Re-isolated acetyl-LDL exhibited an increase in its phospholipid content by 86% as well as a reduction in the electrophoretic mobility. Its endocytic degradation by macrophages was reduced by 60% when compared with control acetyl-LDL, suggesting a significant reduction in the ligand activity for the macrophage scavenger receptor. Transfer of apolipoproteins between acetyl-LDL and DMPC/apoA-I did not occur. These results indicate that transfer of DMPC from DMPC/apoA-I to acetyl-LDL weakens the ligand activity for the scavenger receptor due probably to a decrease in net negative charge. This study demonstrated for the first time that lipid modification (change in the lipid moiety) of acetyl-LDL can induce alteration in its apolipoprotein moiety, leading to a significant loss of its biological activity. Because discoidal HDLs are known to occur in vivo, this phenomenon may explain one of the anti-atherogenic functions of HDL in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1501900559,"The product of gene 2.5 protein of bacteriophage T7, a single-stranded DNA-binding protein, physically interacts with phage encoded DNA polymerase and primase/helicase proteins. A truncated gene 2.5 protein (GP2.5-delta 21C) was constructed by in vitro mutagenesis and lacks the 21 carboxyl-terminal amino acids found in wild-type gene 2.5 protein, 15 of which are acidic. GP2.5-delta 21C cannot substitute for wild-type gene 2.5 protein in vivo; the phage are not viable and exhibit less than 1% of the DNA synthesis observed in wild-type phage-infected cells. GP2.5-delta 21C has been purified to apparent homogeneity from cells overexpressing its cloned gene and has a conformation that differs from that of the wild-type gene 2.5 protein as judged by its circular dichroism spectra. Purified GP2.5-delta 21C retains its ability to bind to single-stranded DNA; the association constant of the protein for single-stranded DNA, determined by nitrocellulose filter binding, is 3.2 x 10(6) M-1 and is identical to that determined for wild-type gene 2.5 protein. However, GP2.5-delta 21C is a monomer in solution, whereas the wild-type protein exists as a dimer. GP2.5-delta 21C does not physically interact with T7 DNA polymerase as measured by affinity chromatography and fluorescent emission anisotropy. The mutant protein cannot stimulate T7 DNA polymerase activity on primed single-stranded DNA templates."
https://openalex.org/W1566671679,"A mammalian endonuclease that resolves Holliday junctions has been partially purified from extracts of calf thymus and Chinese hamster ovary cells. The activity acts upon (i) synthetic Holliday junctions and (ii) recombination intermediates made by the Escherichia coli RecA protein and appears to be functionally analogous to the E. coli RuvC protein. Cleavage occurs by the introduction of symmetrically related nicks in strands of like polarity to produce nicked duplex DNA products. The nicks can be repaired by DNA ligase. The resolvase is specific for Holliday junctions and does not act upon Y junctions, G/A mismatches, or heterologous loops. The substrate specificity is therefore similar to that of E. coli RuvC protein and contrasts with the broad range specificity of other junction resolvases such as T4 endonuclease VII. The mammalian resolvase activity has been observed at normal levels in extracts prepared from a series of DNA repair-defective cells. These include the x-ray or UV-sensitive hamster lines xrs-5, xrs-6, and Chinese hamster ovary 43-3B (defective in ERCC-1), and murine cells that are severely immunodeficient and defective in both V(D)J rejoining and DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W1576774544,"The monoclonal antibody (mAb) AA4 recognizes two alpha-galactosyl derivatives of the GD1b ganglioside on rat mast cells and on the rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cultured cell line. Here we demonstrate that mAb AA4 coprecipitated both protein tyrosine and serine kinases. In contrast, a monoclonal antibody to the GD3 ganglioside did not coprecipitate any kinase activity. In kinase assays of mAb AA4 immunoprecipitates there were phosphorylated proteins of 71-80, 53/56, and 41/42 kDa. All proteins were phosphorylated on tyrosine, whereas the 71-80- and 41/42-kDa proteins were also phosphorylated on serine residues. The precipitation of these proteins by mAb AA4 correlated with the presence of the alpha-galactosyl derivatives of GD1b. The 53/56-kDa proteins were identified as the Src-related tyrosine kinase p53/56lyn. The presence of p53/56lyn in the mAb AA4 immunoprecipitates was specific and was observed when several different detergents were used. The same 71-80-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated by mAb AA4 and anti-Lyn antibodies and may play a role in the interaction of p53/56lyn with the gangliosides. Although there is a weak association of the high affinity IgE receptor with these gangliosides, the coprecipitation of p53/56lyn with mAb AA4 was not secondary to the association of this kinase with receptor. These complexes of gangliosides and several proteins that include p53/56lyn, a serine kinase, and the high affinity IgE receptor could play an important role in receptor-mediated signal transduction."

https://openalex.org/W1572993936,"To investigate whether electrogenic and ATP-dependent taurocholate transport activities are both mediated by the same bile acid-transporting polypeptide in rat liver, we further purified isolated canalicular membrane vesicles by free flow electrophoresis. Removal of most of the contaminating endoplasmic reticulum resulted in a complete loss of electrogenic taurocholate transport from an ecto-ATPase-enriched canalicular membrane subfraction. In contrast, ATP-dependent taurocholate transport remained associated with both an ecto-ATPase-enriched and an ecto-ATPase-free canalicular membrane subfraction. Microsomes containing 64% of total endoplasmic reticulum exhibited saturable electrogenic (Km approximately 270 microM), but no ATP-dependent taurocholate uptake. Golgi membrane vesicles were devoid of any taurocholate transport activity. These results indicate that electrogenic taurocholate transport resides entirely in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas ATP-dependent bile acid transport is an intrinsic function of the canalicular membrane as well as of a so far unidentified intracellular membrane bound compartment. Hence, the two transport activities are most probably mediated by two different bile acid transporting polypeptides. Furthermore, the finding of ATP-dependent taurocholate transport in virtually ecto-ATPase-free vesicles argues against the concept of primary active bile acid transport being exclusively mediated by the canalicular ecto-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1599078439,"Abstract The transcriptional regulatory protein Id, a negatively trans-acting protein with a helix-loop-helix motif that is expressed in many proliferating tissues early in development, continues to be expressed in postmitotic adult cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle. Following the observation of a doublet band of 1.1 and 1.25 kilobases on Northern hybridizations of Id1 cDNA with mRNA isolated from both cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle cells, we identified and sequenced an alternatively spliced Id1 gene product containing an insert of 214 base pairs within the domain of the original Id1 cDNA. A protein with a molecular mass corresponding to that predicted by the Id1.25-kilobase mRNA sequence could be identified on immunoblots of cell lysates from neonatal and adult rat ventricular myocytes. The insert appears to be a coding intron, based on the presence of intron-exon consensus sequences at the insert boundaries and the presence of the originally described Id1 carboxyl-terminal sequence immediately downstream from, and out of frame with, this insert. In contrast to Id1 and Id2, which do not form homodimers, the carboxyl-terminal sequence of this alternatively spliced Id1 transcript, termed Id1.25, permits homodimerization. Thus, alternative splicing of Id1 may allow for tissue-specific expression of Id1, while formation of homodimers could provide a post-translational mechanism to regulate the ability of Id1.25 to bind and inactivate E2A gene products."
https://openalex.org/W1595457691,"The intracellular basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) dioxin receptor mediates signal transduction by dioxin (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin). In analogy to nuclear receptors that are members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily the dioxin receptor is a ligand-inducible transcriptional regulator that directly binds to response elements within regulated genes. The most commonly studied dioxin receptor ligands are dioxin itself and structurally related environmental contaminants. A physiological ligand has not yet been identified. Interestingly, however, indolo[3,2-b]carbazole, a compound formed from precursors in the diet, has been shown to bind the murine dioxin receptor with high affinity in vitro. In the present study we show that this compound and its methylated derivative 5,11-dimethylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole very potently activated transcription from a dioxin or xenobiotic response element (XRE)-driven reporter gene in both murine and human hepatoma cells. This effect was not observed in mutant, dioxin-resistant hepatoma cells which are either deficient in expression of dioxin receptor or the bHLH receptor partner factor Arnt. In vitro indolocarbazoles induced XRE binding activity by the human dioxin receptor-Arnt complex in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, both dioxin- and indolocarbazole-activated forms of dioxin receptor regulate target gene expression by the same mechanism involving recruitment of the bHLH factor Arnt and recognition of the XRE element. Finally, the indolo[3,2-b]carbazole-activated human dioxin receptor appeared to generate more stable complexes with the XRE target sequence relative to those produced by the dioxin-activated receptor form, indicating interesting mechanistic differences between different classes of dioxin receptor ligands in their abilities to modulate human dioxin receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W1554679010,"A plasmid that directs the overexpression of the Escherichia coli regulatory protein TyrR was constructed. Cell extracts of an E. coli strain harboring the plasmid were used to develop a two-step procedure for purifying homogeneous TyrR. The weight-average molecular weight of the pure protein was determined by sedimentation equilibrium analyses to be 110,000 +/- 5,000, indicating that native TyrR is a homodimer. The binding of ligands to TyrR was investigated by the techniques of sedimentation velocity meniscus depletion and steady state dialysis. One mol of ATP bound per mol of TyrR subunit with half-maximal saturation at 5-7 microM ATP. ATP binding curves exhibited positive cooperativity, with a value of 1.3 for the Hill constant, nH. The binding was not significantly affected by the presence of either 500 microM tyrosine or 2 mM phenylalanine. Binding of tyrosine to TyrR (40 microM subunit) could not be detected in the absence of ATP, indicating that the TyrR-tyrosine complex has a dissociation constant (Kd) in excess of 180 microM. However, binding was observed in the presence of saturating ATP (200 microM), where 1 mol of tyrosine bound per mol of TyrR subunit with half-maximal saturation at 50 microM tyrosine. The binding exhibited positive cooperativity (nH of 1.2). There was no detectable binding of either phenylalanine or tryptophan to TyrR (40 microM) in the absence or presence of 200 microM ATP, indicating that any binding of these amino acids to TyrR or TyrR.ATP also has a Kd in excess of 180 microM. Each of these amino acids was found to inhibit the binding of tyrosine by TyrR.ATP when present in large molar excess (20 microM tyrosine and 2 or 10 mM phenylalanine or tryptophan), indicating that TyrR binds each of these amino acids, albeit more weakly than it binds tyrosine."
https://openalex.org/W1505344145,"Sulfolobus shibatae B12 is a thermophilic archaebacterium that contains an inducible virus named SSV1. The viral DNA has been shown to be positively supercoiled before encapsidation. We have previously purified an archaebacterial DNA topoisomerase from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius DSM 639, reverse gyrase, likely responsible for this positive supercoiling reaction. In order to study an homogeneous system containing both reverse gyrase and one of its preferential substrate, SSV1 DNA, we have purified this enzyme from S. shibatae. During the course of the purification, we have detected another topoisomerase activity. In order to separate and purify these two topoisomerases, we have devised a new purification procedure. Purified S. shibatae reverse gyrase is a 124-kDa monomer, with a Stokes radius of 43 A and a sedimentation coefficient of 6.2 S. It is able to perform a DNA reverse gyration per se at 10 mM NaCl in a Mg- and ATP-dependent manner. The other topoisomerase is a monomer of about 40 kDa, with a Stokes radius of 25 A and a sedimentation coefficient of 4 S. This additional topoisomerase activity is Mg-dependent and ATP-independent and catalyzes only a relaxation reaction of negatively supercoiled DNA at 150 mM NaCl. This new ATP-independent topoisomerase activity seems to be a proteolysis product of reverse gyrase."
https://openalex.org/W1522330173,"We have targeted the expression of recombinant human extracellular superoxide dismutase, a glycosylated tetrameric metalloprotein, to the mammary gland of transgenic mice. This was achieved by using regulatory elements from either the murine whey acidic protein gene or the ovine beta-lactoglobulin gene to control expression of human extracellular superoxide dismutase cDNA. Whey acidic protein regulatory sequences directed high level mammary gland-specific expression of the recombinant gene and secretion of biologically active extracellular superoxide dismutase into the milk. The produced recombinant protein was fully active, it was in tetrameric form, it showed heparin affinity, and its mass was similar to that of the native enzyme. In addition, the in vivo plasma clearance in a rabbit model was similar to the previously studied native and recombinant forms. To our knowledge, this is the first example of efficient production of a tetrameric, protease-susceptible metalloprotein in milk of transgenic animals. Production at equivalent levels in transgenic farm animals would yield sufficient extracellular superoxide dismutase for therapeutic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W1584102679,"In this paper, we describe three approaches to study the single trimethyllysine 115 in calmodulin. First, 14N NMR spectroscopy has been used as a novel spectroscopic tool. Because of the unique symmetrical tetrahedral substitution of its side chain, the trimethyllysine residue gives rise to a sharp 14N NMR resonance; hence, this has allowed the detection and quantitation of the level of trimethylation. Trimethyllysine side chains of bovine testis calmodulin and yeast cytochrome c were shown to have a high mobility in aqueous solution as determined by 14N NMR relaxation measurements. Second, we have purified mammalian calmodulin from an overproducing Escherichia coli strain. By comparison of the 1H-13C heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence spectra of 13C-dimethylated calmodulin samples from bovine testis and E. coli, the resonance for Lys-115 in bacterially expressed calmodulin could be identified. pH titration experiments showed that epsilon-NH2 group of Lys-115 has a normal pKa value both in the apo and Ca2+ forms of the protein and in a complex of calmodulin with a 22-residue calmodulin-binding peptide derived from myosin light chain kinase. Third, we have shown that mutation of Lys-115 to the uncharged Gln residue does not alter the ability of the protein to stimulate the enzymes cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and myosin light chain kinase. These results show that the trimethylation of Lys-115 is not caused by an unusual pKa and reactivity of its epsilon-NH2 group and that its side chain remains flexible. Moreover, our data suggest that the introduction of a permanent positive charge on Lys-115 by trimethylation is also not the major reason for this specific post-translational modification."
https://openalex.org/W1567983985,"We report biochemical characterization of two recently identified mutants of yeast RAS2, RAS2-E99K and RAS2-E130K. These mutants exhibit dominant activating phenotypes in yeast. Characterization of their intrinsic GTPase and GDP dissociation as well as their ability to stimulate adenylate cyclase showed that these activities of RAS2-E99K mutant protein were similar to those of the wild type protein. RAS2-E130K protein, on the other hand, differed from the wild type protein with a fast GDP dissociation rate and 2-fold higher activation of adenylate cyclase. When the sensitivity to GTPase-activating protein (GAP) was examined, we found that the RAS2-E99K protein was approximately 1200-fold less sensitive to NF1-GAP activity. In addition, the affinity for NF1 as revealed by competition binding experiments was reduced more than 150-fold with RAS2-E99K protein. Thus, the RAS2-E99K mutation affects interaction with GAP proteins. This mutation is particularly interesting because it is the first mutation identified in the alpha 3 region of ras protein that affects GAP interaction. The alpha 3 region appears to be directly involved in interaction with NF1, since peptides containing the sequence encompassing residue 99 of RAS2 inhibit NF1-GAP activity. These results suggest that the interaction between ras and GAP involves a larger region within ras than previously recognized."
https://openalex.org/W1529157617,"Abstract Activation of the c-abl protooncogene occurs in Abelson murine leukemia virus, Hardy-Zuckerman-2 feline sarcoma virus, and during the chromosomal translocation that generates the BCRABL fusion gene. The three genes exhibit varying degrees of transforming activity; the two viral genes transform NIH-3T3 cells in vitro, whereas the BCRABL gene is incapable of transforming these cells. To determine whether genetic alterations can enhance the transforming potential of the BCRABL gene, we employed genetic selection techniques which led to the isolation of a mutant form of the BCRABL gene with high levels of fibroblastic transforming activity. Molecular analysis of this clone shows that it suffered a deletion of 3' ABL sequences and their replacement with a cellular sequence of unknown origin, termed X. This tripartite gene is capable of inducing 35 foci/10 ng of DNA. Deletion of 3' ABL sequences analogous to that seen in the activated BCRABL protein without the addition of X yields 5 foci/100 ng of DNA. These results suggest that carboxyl-terminal truncations unmask the fibroblastic transforming activity of the BCRABL gene product and the addition of X sequences dramatically enhances this transforming potential, indicating a dominant contribution by the X reading frame."
