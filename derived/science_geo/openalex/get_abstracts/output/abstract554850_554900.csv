https://openalex.org/W2296172910,"To test whether there is a relationship between the level of national corruption and the intrinsic honesty of individuals, a behavioural test of the honesty of people from 23 countries was conducted; the authors found that high national scores on an index of rule-breaking are linked with reduced personal honesty. Honesty is an important character trait in all human societies. Good institutions that limit cheating and rule violations are crucial for prosperity and development, yet deception is common in nature and humans are no exception. Using a behavioural test of honesty with young people (in 23 countries) in which lying is undetectable at the individual level but can be inferred at the population level, Simon Gächter and Jonathan Schulz find that high national scores on an index of rule-breaking are linked with reduced personal honesty. Deception is common in nature and humans are no exception1. Modern societies have created institutions to control cheating, but many situations remain where only intrinsic honesty keeps people from cheating and violating rules. Psychological2, sociological3 and economic theories4 suggest causal pathways to explain how the prevalence of rule violations in people’s social environment, such as corruption, tax evasion or political fraud, can compromise individual intrinsic honesty. Here we present cross-societal experiments from 23 countries around the world that demonstrate a robust link between the prevalence of rule violations and intrinsic honesty. We developed an index of the ‘prevalence of rule violations’ (PRV) based on country-level data from the year 2003 of corruption, tax evasion and fraudulent politics. We measured intrinsic honesty in an anonymous die-rolling experiment5. We conducted the experiments with 2,568 young participants (students) who, due to their young age in 2003, could not have influenced PRV in 2003. We find individual intrinsic honesty is stronger in the subject pools of low PRV countries than those of high PRV countries. The details of lying patterns support psychological theories of honesty6,7. The results are consistent with theories of the cultural co-evolution of institutions and values8, and show that weak institutions and cultural legacies9,10,11 that generate rule violations not only have direct adverse economic consequences, but might also impair individual intrinsic honesty that is crucial for the smooth functioning of society."
https://openalex.org/W2296763054,"Apolipoprotein M (ApoM) transports sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in plasma, and ApoM-deficient mice (Apom(-/-)) have ∼50% reduced plasma S1P levels. There are 5 known S1P receptors, and S1P induces adherens junction formation between endothelial cells through the S1P1 receptor, which in turn suppresses vascular leak. Increased vascular permeability is a hallmark of inflammation. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships between vascular leakage in ApoM deficiency and S1P1 function in normal physiology and in inflammation. Vascular permeability in the lungs was assessed by accumulation of dextran molecules (70 kDa) and was increased ∼40% in Apom(-/-) mice compared to WT (C57Bl6/j) mice. Reconstitution of plasma ApoM/S1P or treatment with an S1P1 receptor agonist (SEW2871) rapidly reversed the vascular leakage to a level similar to that in WT mice, suggesting that it is caused by decreased plasma levels of S1P and reduced S1P1 stimulation. In a carrageenan-induced model of inflammation, Apom(-/-) mice had increased vascular leakage compared with that in WT mice. Adenoviral overexpression of ApoM in Apom(-/-) mice decreased the vascular leakage compared to adenoviral overexpression of green fluorescent protein. The study suggests that vascular leakage of albumin-sized particles in ApoM deficiency is S1P- and S1P1-dependent and this dependency exacerbates the response to inflammatory stimuli.-Christensen, P.

https://openalex.org/W2299839948,"Social rhythm refers to the regularity with which one engages in social activities throughout the week, and has established links with bipolar disorder, as well as some links with depression and anxiety. The aim of the present study is to examine social rhythm and its relationship to various aspects of health, including physical health, negative mental health, and positive mental health.Questionnaire data were obtained from a large-scale multi-national sample of 8095 representative participants from the U.S., Russia, and Germany.Results indicated that social rhythm irregularity is related to increased reporting of health problems, depression, anxiety, and stress. In contrast, greater regularity is related to better overall health state, life satisfaction, and positive mental health. The effects are generally small in size, but hold even when controlling for gender, marital status, education, income, country, and social support. Further, social rhythm means differ across Russia, the U.S., and Germany. Relationships with mental health are present in all three countries, but differ in magnitude.Social rhythm irregularity is related to mental health in Russia, the U.S., and Germany."

Cell treatment with trehalose could decrease cytosolic aggregates of potentially pathogenic proteins, including mutant huntingtin, α-synuclein, and phosphorylated tau that are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we demonstrate that trehalose also alters the metabolism of the Alzheimer disease-related amyloid precursor protein (APP). Cell treatment with trehalose decreased the degradation of full-length APP and its C-terminal fragments. Trehalose also reduced the secretion of the amyloid-β peptide. Biochemical and cell biological experiments revealed that trehalose alters the subcellular distribution and decreases the degradation of APP C-terminal fragments in endolysosomal compartments. Trehalose also led to strong accumulation of the autophagic marker proteins LC3-II and p62, and decreased the proteolytic activation of the lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D. The combined data indicate that trehalose decreases the lysosomal metabolism of APP by altering its endocytic vesicular transport.

The combined data indicate that trehalose decreases the lysosomal metabolism of APP by altering its endocytic vesicular transport. Alzheimer disease is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques that contain aggregates of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ). 5The abbreviations used are: Aβamyloid β-peptideAPPamyloid precursor proteinAICDAPP intracellular domainAtgautophagy-related geneBaf A1bafilomycin A1BECN1beclin-1CTFC-terminal fragmentEBSSEarle's balanced salt solutionFLfull lengthCat Dcathepsin DLC3microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3LAMP2lysosome-associated membrane protein 2mTORmechanistic target of rapamycinPSpresenilinMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastdKOdouble knock-outAPP-SWSwedish mutant variant of APP. Aβ is derived from the amyloid precursor protein by sequential proteolytic processing by β- and γ-secretases (1.Selkoe D.J. Alzheimer's disease: genes, proteins, and therapy.Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5156) Google Scholar, 2.O'Brien R.J. Wong P.C. Amyloid precursor protein processing and Alzheimer's disease.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 34: 185-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). The initial cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase results in the secretion of the soluble ectodomain and the generation of a membrane-tethered C-terminal fragment (APP-CTFβ). Subsequently, APP-CTFβ can be cleaved by γ-secretase to liberate Aβ from cellular membranes (2.O'Brien R.J. Wong P.C. Amyloid precursor protein processing and Alzheimer's disease.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 34: 185-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). In an alternative pathway, APP can also be cleaved by α-secretase within the Aβ domain, thereby generating CTFα. The subsequent cleavage of APP-CTFα by γ-secretase results in secretion of a small peptide called p3 (2.O'Brien R.J. Wong P.C. Amyloid precursor protein processing and Alzheimer's disease.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 34: 185-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). It is important to note that APP is also metabolized by additional pathways, including proteasomal and lysosomal degradation (3.Pasternak S.H. Bagshaw R.D. Guiral M. Zhang S. Ackerley C.A. Pak B.J.

The metabolism of APP is also regulated by macroautophagy (herein referred to as autophagy), a lysosome-dependent degradative pathway for long lived proteins, organelles, and nutrient recycling (6.Mizushima N.

Autophagy: from phenomenology to molecular understanding in less than a decade.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). Autophagy starts with the formation of double-membrane vesicles, the so-called autophagosomes, which further fuse with lysosomes to become autolysosomes for degradation of autophagosome contents by lysosomal hydrolases (8.Levine B. Kroemer G. Autophagy in the pathogenesis of disease.Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar). Autophagy is an essential prosurvival pathway induced by a variety of stress factors, including nutrient deprivation, growth factor withdrawal, oxidative stress, infection, and hypoxia (9.Kroemer G. Mariño G. Levine B. Autophagy and the integrated stress response.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 280-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). These factors contribute to the etiology of multiple diseases such as cancer, stroke, heart disease, and infection (10.Murrow L. Debnath J. Autophagy as a stress-response and quality-control mechanism: implications for cell injury and human disease.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2013; 8: 105-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic cells have a basal autophagic activity under normal physiological conditions. Cells deficient in autophagy show diffuse abnormal protein accumulation and mitochondrial disorganization (11.Hara T. Nakamura K. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakahara Y. Suzuki-Migishima R. Yokoyama M.

Basal autophagy is particularly important and active in the liver and non-dividing cells such as neurons and myocytes (11.Hara T. Nakamura K. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakahara Y. Suzuki-Migishima R.

Dysfunction in autophagy is implicated in the pathogenesis of many human diseases, including different types of neurodegeneration (15.Kundu M. Thompson C.B.

Trehalose is a natural non-reducing disaccharide containing two d-glucose residues connected via an α,α-1,1 linkage. It functions not only as an energy source but is also used to protect cells against heat, cold, oxidation, or dehydration (20.Richards A.B. Krakowka S. Dexter L.B. Schmid H. Wolterbeek A.P.

However, the role of trehalose in the cellular metabolism of the Alzheimer disease-associated APP remains to be investigated. In this study, we analyzed the role of trehalose in the cellular metabolism of APP. Interestingly, trehalose strongly decreased the degradation of APP and its CTFs. By biochemical and cell biological approaches, we demonstrate that trehalose interferes with endocytic vesicular trafficking as indicated by decreased processing of cathepsin D (Cat D), redistribution of lysosome-associated protein (LAMP)2, and accumulation of the autophagy-related proteins microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and p62. The combined data demonstrate that trehalose exerts complex effects on vesicular trafficking, thereby decreasing the metabolism of APP and the secretion of Aβ.

Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. H4-mCherry-GFP-LC3 stable clones were generated from transfection of H4 cells with mCherry-GFP-LC3 constructs. The protocol was performed with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clones were selected with 25 μg/ml puromycin. Cells were processed for immunocytochemistry as described previously (28.Tamboli I.Y. Prager K. Thal D.R. Thelen K.M. Dewachter I. Pietrzik C.U. St George-Hyslop P. Sisodia S.S. De Strooper B.

Subsequently, cells were kept in blocking solution (90% PBS, 10% FCS, 0.1% Triton X-100) at room temperature for 1 h, incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight or at room temperature for 1–2 h, and then incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were imaged with a Carl Zeiss Axio Imager 2 ApoTome fluorescence microscope for optical sectioning. Signal intensity and co-localization were analyzed with AxioVision software. For quantification, randomly selected images (n = 10) were used. Signals were quantified in two randomly chosen boxes (150 μm2) per cell. Values represent means ± standard deviation (S.D.). For lysis, cells were incubated in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1% phosphatase inhibitor and 1% proteinase inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) for 15 min. Particulate materials were removed by centrifugation at 13,200 rpm for 15 min, and supernatants were used for further analyses. To isolate cellular membranes, cells were incubated in hypotonic buffer D (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 25 mm glycerol 2-phosphate, 1 mm DTT) supplemented with 1% proteinase inhibitor on ice for 10 min. Cells were then homogenized using 21-gauge needles and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min to pellet nuclei. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 30 min to obtain the membrane fraction as a pellet. Membrane fractions or cellular lysates were separated by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk for 1 h and incubated with primary antibodies overnight and appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using ECL reagent (GE Healthcare) and an ECL imaging station (ChemiDoc XRS, Bio-Rad). Quantification of signals was done by the Quantity One software package (Bio-Rad). For subcellular fractionation, cells were subjected to a hypotonic shock as described above. Postnuclear fractions (3800 rpm, 5 min) were loaded onto a discontinuous gradient (30, 20, 17.5, 15, 12.5, 10, 7.5, 5, and 2.5% OptiPrepTM; Sigma Aldrich; 1.2 ml each) and separated at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 8 h without using the brake. Single fractions were collected at a volume of 1 ml, and proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Cells were grown on 6-well culture plates until 70% confluence in DMEM as described above. For collection of Aβ, 750 μl of fresh medium was added overnight. Conditioned media were cleared by centrifugation. Cells were briefly washed and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Both cell lysates and conditioned media were analyzed by electrochemiluminescence technology (MesoScale Discovery) for Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ42 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were grown in Petri dishes until 80% confluence. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated in serum and methionine-free medium for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with 20 μCi of 35S-radiolabeled methionine/cysteine for 30 min to pulse label newly synthesized proteins. After pulse labeling, cells were washed with label free-medium containing 10% serum and a 5-fold excess of unlabeled methionine and chased for the indicated time periods. Cells were then lysed, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to PVDF membrane, radiolabeled proteins were quantified by phosphorimaging.

To assess the effect of trehalose on APP metabolism, human neuroglioma H4 cells that endogenously express APP were incubated with trehalose for different time periods, and APP levels were analyzed by Western immunoblotting. Cell treatment with trehalose strongly increased levels of APP full length (FL) (Fig. 1, A and B) and, even more pronounced, of APP-CTFs (Fig. 1, A, C, and D). Trehalose also significantly increased the secretion of soluble APP derived from α-secretory processing into conditioned media (Fig. 1, E and F), suggesting that the increased levels of cellular APP-FL were not caused by inhibition of APP secretion. To test whether trehalose exerts similar effects in other cell types, we also used human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y, liver Hep-G2, and embryonic kidney 293 cells. Trehalose induced accumulation of APP-FL and particularly of APP-CTFs in all tested cell lines (Fig. 1G), very similar to the effects observed in human H4 cells. We next wanted to test whether the trehalose-dependent increase in APP-FL and APP-CTFs is due to altered degradation. To inhibit de novo protein biosynthesis, H4 cells were incubated with cycloheximide and chased in the absence or presence of trehalose. In the absence of trehalose, levels of APP-FL and its CTFs declined within 2 h after block of de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 1F). In the presence of trehalose, levels of APP-FL also declined. Notably, levels of APP-CTFs were stabilized and even increased after 1 and 2 h of cycloheximide treatment in the presence of trehalose (Fig. 1H). The increase in APP-CTFs after block of protein biosynthesis could be explained by the ongoing processing of APP-FL by α- and β-secretases. These data indicate that trehalose inhibits the degradation of APP-CTFs without inhibition of secretory processing of APP-FL. Levels of Aβ derived from endogenous APP in the different cell lines were below the detection limit (not shown). Thus, we used previously described fibroblasts that express either APP-WT or the familial Alzheimer disease-associated Swedish mutant variant of APP (APP-SW) (30.Karaca I. Tamboli I.Y. Glebov K. Richter J. Fell L.H. Grimm M.O. Haupenthal V.J. Hartmann T. Gräler M.H. van Echten-Deckert G. Walter J.

Chem. 2014; 289: 16761-16772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As expected, levels of Aβ in conditioned media from cells expressing the APP-SW variant were much higher than that in media from APP-WT-expressing cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Incubation of cells with trehalose reduced the secretion of the different length variants Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ42 from both APP-WT- and APP-SW-expressing cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Levels of cell-associated or intracellular Aβ were very low. Only Aβ40 could be detected in lysates of APP-SW-expressing cells. Here, levels were slightly increased upon cell treatment with trehalose (Fig. 2B). These data demonstrate that trehalose decreases the secretion of Aβ and impairs the degradation of APP-CTFs. γ-Secretase is critically involved in the cleavage of APP-CTFs and Aβ generation. Thus, we next tested the potential effect of trehalose on γ-secretase activity. Purified membranes of H4 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of trehalose, and γ-secretase activity was monitored by the detection of the APP intracellular domain (AICD) released into the supernatant. In control samples, AICD was readily detected, indicating efficient cleavage of APP-CFTs by γ-secretase (Fig. 3, A and B). As expected, pharmacological inhibition of γ-secretase by the specific inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester efficiently reduced the generation of AICD (Fig. 3, A and B). However, trehalose did not decrease the formation of AICD (Fig. 3, A and B), demonstrating that trehalose does not inhibit γ-secretase activity. To further test whether trehalose induced accumulation of APP-CTFs independently of γ-secretase inhibition, we next used fibroblasts from WT and PSdKO mice. PSdKO cells lack both catalytically active variants of presenilins and thus have no γ-secretase activity. Accordingly, basal levels of APP-CTFs were higher in PSdKO than in WT cells (Fig. 3, C and D). Interestingly, trehalose further increased APP-CTF levels in PSdKO cells (Fig. 3, C and D), indicating that the observed accumulation of APP-CTFs upon cell treatment with trehalose is not caused by inhibition of γ-secretase activity. The combined data demonstrate that trehalose decreases the degradation of APP-CTFs without inhibiting γ-secretase. We next analyzed the effects of trehalose on LC3, which is widely used as a marker for autophagosomes. Upon induction of autophagy, LC3 is converted from a cytosolic form (LC3-I) to a phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated form (LC3-II) and thereby recruited to membranes of autophagosomes (31.Otomo C.

However, the role of PIWI in cancer remains elusive. Here we report that one of the four PIWI proteins in humans, PIWIL4, is highly expressed in both breast cancer tissues and the cytoplasm of MDA-MB-231 cells derived from breast cancer. Reducing PIWIL4 expression drastically impairs the migration ability of MDA-MB-231 cells, significantly increases their apoptosis, and mildly affects their proliferation. Our transcriptome and proteome analysis reveal that these functions are at least partially achieved via the PIWIL4 regulation of TGF-β and FGF signaling pathways and MHC class II proteins.

Furthermore, TNBC patients do not benefit from targeted treatments such as endocrine therapy or trastuzumab because this subtype of cancer lacks the appropriate targets for these drugs. These challenges point to the pressing need to identify pathogenic pathways in TNBC. Recent studies have identified genetic alterations and gene expression profiles associated with subtypes of TNBC, including the implication of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) pathway in TNBC (29.Banerji S.

However, therapeutic blockade of this pathway with the PI3K/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor has not been effective, indicating the existence of other mechanisms that are determinative in inducing TNBC. Here we report that PIWIL4 is widely expressed in breast cancer samples and several cell lines derived from TNBC. To explore the mechanisms involved in TNBC, we focused our study on using a cell line (MDA-MB-231) as a model in which PIWIL4 is expressed at the highest level. We show that reducing PIWIL4 expression significantly compromises cell migration, increases apoptosis, and reduces proliferation of the cells. These effects may be achieved at least in part by activating TGF-β, MAPK/ERK, and FGF signaling. In addition, PIWIL4 represses MHC class II expression, which might help cancer cells to avoid immune recognition and reaction. MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-453 cells were cultured in L-15 medium (Leibovitz, Sigma, L1518-500ML) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C without CO2. BT474 and 4T1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, 61870036) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and MCF-10A cells were cultured in MEBM medium (Lonza, CC-3151) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, and these three cell lines were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. 20 pairs of clinical samples were purchased from the tissue bank of the Institute of Health Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The local ethics committee approved the study, and the regulations of this committee were followed. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the protocol of the manufacturer.

The PIWL4 cDNA primers were designed as follows: forward, 5′-CGCGGATCCATGAGTGGAAGAGCCCG-3′; reverse, 5′-CGCGGATCCTCACAGGTAGAAGAGATGG-3′. Total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis by SuperScript® III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, 18080044) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The cDNA was used as a template for amplification by Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, M0530L) in PCR and cloned into the pMDTM19-T vector by a cloning kit (Takara, 6013). Total proteins were extracted by radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-24948) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Samples were mixed (3:1) with 4× protein SDS-PAGE loading buffer (Takara, 9173) and heated at 100 °C for 10 min. The human testicular total protein lysate was purchased from Clontech (catalog no. 635309). 30 μg of protein was resolved by the TGX Fast Cast acrylamide kit, 7.5% or 10% (Bio-Rad, 1610173TA) at 120 V, and electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane (Merck/Millipore, IPVH00010) at 0.3A for 1.5 h. The membrane was blocked with 5% DifcoTM skim milk (BD Biosciences, 232100) at room temperature for 2 h, which was diluted with TBS (Bio-Rad, 1706435) supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-29113).

A cell cycle/checkpoint antibody sampler kit (Cell Signaling Technology, 9917) was used for detecting cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of CDC2 and CHK2. RNAi vector pSUPER-puro was purchased from Promega. Three short hairpin DNA sequences were designed as in supplemental Table S1. The DNA sense and antisense sequences were annealed in a pairwise fashion and cloned into the pSUPER-puro vector. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies, 11668019) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Transfected cells were selected using 0.8 μg/ml puromycin. The silencing effect on the PIWIL4 gene was assessed by quantitative PCR and Western blotting analysis according to the aforementioned protocols. Approximately 106 cells were washed with PBS twice, followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 3 min. The resulting supernatant was discarded. The pellet was added to 150–200 μl of buffer B (10 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor, and 1 mm DTT), incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 4 °C at 13,200 rpm for 6 min. Cytoplasmic proteins were collected as the supernatant to new tubes and stored at −80 °C until use. The nuclear pellet was washed with 500 μl of wash buffer (10 mm Hepes, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor, and 1 mm DTT) and centrifuged at 4 °C at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the nuclear pellet was dissolved in 50–80 μl of extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, 0.64 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2.5% glycerol, protease inhibitor, and 1 mm DTT), vortexed for 15 s, incubated on ice for 30 min, vortexed for 10–15 s at 10-min intervals, and centrifuged at 4 °C and 13,200 rpm for 20 min. The supernatants, which contained nucleus proteins, were collected in new tubes and stored at −80 °C for later use. Separation of the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions was verified by Western blotting for β-tubulin and TBP (Cell Signaling Technology, anti-β-tubulin and anti-TBP antibody). We stained cancer cells with the FITC Annexin V apoptosis detection kit I (BD Biosciences, 556547) according to the protocol of the manufacturer and analyzed early- and late-stage apoptosis by FACS (FACS AriaTM IIII, BD Biosciences). Cells were mixed (1:1) with trypan blue solution, 0.4% (Gibco, 15250061), 10 μl of which was seeded on Countess chamber slides (Invitrogen, C10312) and counted with a CountessTM automated cell counter (Invitrogen, C10227). 2 × 103 cells/well were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates and 6-cm2 dishes. Each sample had three repeats. Cell proliferation was determined using CellTiter 96® AQueous MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt) reagent powder (Promega, G1111) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Absorbance at 490-nm wavelength was read using EnSpire® multimode plate readers (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and clone formation was visualized by staining with crystal violet solution (Beyotime Biotechnology, C0121). 5 × 104 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate, and a wound was introduced with a wound maker kit (Essen Bioscience). Wounded monolayers were washed twice with PBS to remove non-adherent cells. Cells were cultured in 2% FBS for 48 h, and the wound healing tracks were recorded with an IncuCyte® Zoom live-cell analysis system (Essen Bioscience). The transwell assay was done using Corning FluoroBlokTM cell culture inserts (Falcon, 351152) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. 2 × 105 cells were seeded on a coverslip (Fisherbrand, 12-545-83) in a 24-well plate. After 24 h, cells were washed three times in 1× PBST (1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, 5 min each time), fixed in 4% formaldehyde (paraformaldehyde powder, 95%, 158127-2.5KG, Sigma) at room temperature for 15 min, incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-29112) at room temperature for 15 min, washed in PBST three times (5 min each wash), blocked in 3% BSA at room temperature for 2 h, and washed in TBST again for 5 min. The cells were incubated with anti-PIWIL4 (Abcam, ab111714, 1:500 dilution) and anti-hDcp1a (56-Y) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-100706, 1:500 dilution) in 3% BSA at 4 °C overnight with no primary antibody addition as a negative control. After incubation, cells were washed three times in 1× PBST, 5 min each time. FITC-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG and IgM (heavy and light chain) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 115-095-044, 1:100 dilution) or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG, Fc fragment-specific (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 111-585-008, 1:500 dilution) were added and incubated at room temperature for 2 h, followed by a PBST wash once for 5 min. DAPI (Life Technologies, D1306, 1:5000 dilution) was then added to the PBST buffer and incubated at room temperature for10 min, followed by three washes in PBST, 5 min each time. Coverslips were removed one at a time, and we added 1 drop of FluorPreserveTM (Merck/Millipore, 345787-25MLCN), mounted them to the glass slide, pressed gently, sealed them with nail polish, and stored them at 4 °C overnight before confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Zeiss, LSM710). 106 MDA-MB-231 cells or cells treated with shPIWIL4–1, shPIWIL4–2, or shPIWIL4–3 were collected, lysed in 200 μl of SDT lysis buffer (4% (w/v) SDS, 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.6), and 0.1 m DTT), and then incubated at 95 °C for 3–5 min. Filter-aided proteome preparation was carried out according to the protocol detailed in supplemental Data 1 and sequenced by Thermo Scientific Fusion with EASY-nLC 1000. For RNA sequencing, ∼106 MDA-MB-231 cells with or without shPIWIL4–3 treatment were collected. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen, 15596026) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. mRNAs and small RNAs were sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq3000 platform (Jing Neng Co., Shanghai, China). HTSeq software was used for the statistics of the original mRNA deep sequencing data of the control and shPIWIL4–3-treated samples. DESeq software was used to screen differentially expressed genes compared with the control (p ≤ 0.05 or -fold change ≥ 2). A gene ontology and pathway analysis was conducted using an online tool. Gene ontology level 2 and 3 categories were selected for mRNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis, respectively. The small RNA sequences were generated with Illumina HiSeq3000, and we trimmed off linkers with the FASTX toolkit. We selected sequences with sizes ranging from 12–43 nucleotides for analysis. The reference genome was human genome hg38. The gene annotation information was based on the Ensembl annotation. The miRNA annotation was based on version 21 of miRBase. Repeats and transposon annotation were based on RepeatMasker. Complete rRNA references were from the NCBI. One mismatch was allowed for mapping sequences against rRNA, tRNA, small nucleolar RNA, and small nuclear RNA. Human known piRNAs in piRNABank and piRBase served as references to identify known piRNAs. Only the small RNAs that had an identical sequence to these reference piRNA sequences were defined as known piRNAs. The abundance of piRNAs was scaled according to the total mapped reads for comparison across different conditions. The shPIWIL4 treated-to-nontreated control ratio was calculated to measure the effect of PIWIL4 knockdown on piRNAs. In total, we detected ∼200 small RNAs annotated as piRNAs in piRNABank and piRBase, of which ∼20 were affected (fold change ≥ 2 or ≤ ½) when PIWIL4 was knocked down. It has been reported that PIWI proteins have aberrant and ectopic expression in cancers, such as the expression of PIWIL2 in breast cancer (17.Kwon C. Tak H. Rho M. Chang H.R. Kim Y.H. Kim K.T.

Because all PIWI proteins are necessary for germ line development and stem cell self-renewal, we systematically examined the expression of three known active PIWI genes in humans, piwil1, piwil2, and piwil4, in six different types of human breast cancer cell lines and 20 pairs of normal and breast cancer samples from 20 patients by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1). piwil1 and piwil2 are expressed in four and two cell lines, respectively, at significantly higher levels than in a normal breast cell line (MCF-10A, a physiologically negative control) or a mouse breast cancer line (4T1, Fig. 1, A and B), consistent with a previous report of PIWIL2 expression in breast cancer cells (35.Lee J.H.

Pathways of proliferation and antiapoptosis driven in breast cancer stem cells by stem cell protein Piwil2.Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 4569-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, PIWIL1 is expressed at significantly higher levels compared with the normal tissue controls in two of 20 breast cancer samples (Fig. 1D). PIWIL2 is more highly expressed than PIWIL1 in one cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 1B), and four of 20 breast cancer samples (Fig. 1E). Remarkably, PIWIL4 is expressed at very high levels in five of six cancer cell lines, much higher than PIWIL1 and PIWIL2 (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, PIWIL4 is significantly expressed in nine of 20 breast cancer samples, with five samples displaying a more than 50-fold up-regulation (Fig. 1F). This indicates that, among the three PIWI genes known to be active, PIWIL4 has the best correlation with breast cancer. To further establish a functional correlation between the expression of PIWI proteins and breast cancer, we analyzed a cancer genomics data bank, cBioPortal (36.Cerami E. Gao J. Dogrusoz U.

Our analysis showed that all three human PIWI genes have genetic alterations in breast cancer. We found that 2%, 7%, and 2% of breast patients cancer patients have amplification, deletion, missense mutation, and truncation of PIWIL1, PIWIL2, and PIWIL4, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1). Moreover, 2%, 2%, and 4% of PIWIL1, PIWL2, and PIWIL4 patients have mRNA up-regulation (supplemental Fig. S1). When only considering TNBC patients, the percentage is increased to 11% (n = 82). The 4% of PIWIL4-positive patients is apparently lower than the 9% of 20 patients who we examined directly. This could be due to inherently lower sensitivity associated with surveying the expression of many genes in more than 5000 tumor samples from 20 cancer studies. Alternatively, it could also reflect that 20 patients is a small sample size. To investigate further correlation between PIWIL4 and breast cancer, we conducted a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis based on clinical data from a bioinformatics website, including 351–1616 patients for each analysis. Patients who have the upper tertile level of PIWIL4 expression have lower overall survival, distance metastasis-free survival, and post-progression survival than patients with the lower 67% of PIWIL4 express"
https://openalex.org/W2293956792,"Complement activation, an integral arm of innate immunity, may be the critical link to the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Whereas we have previously reported elevated anaphylatoxins-complement component 3a (C3a) and complement component 5a (C5a)-in IPF, which interact with TGF-β and augment epithelial injury in vitro, their role in IPF pathogenesis remains unclear. The objective of the current study is to determine the mechanistic role of the binding of C3a/C5a to their respective receptors (C3aR and C5aR) in the progression of lung fibrosis. In normal primary human fetal lung fibroblasts, C3a and C5a induces mesenchymal activation, matrix synthesis, and the expression of their respective receptors. We investigated the role of C3aR and C5aR in lung fibrosis by using bleomycin-injured mice with fibrotic lungs, elevated local C3a and C5a, and overexpression of their receptors via pharmacologic and RNA interference interventions. Histopathologic examination revealed an arrest in disease progression and attenuated lung collagen deposition (Masson's trichrome, hydroxyproline, collagen type I α 1 chain, and collagen type I α 2 chain). Pharmacologic or RNA interference-specific interventions suppressed complement activation (C3a and C5a) and soluble terminal complement complex formation (C5b-9) locally and active TGF-β1 systemically. C3aR/C5aR antagonists suppressed local mRNA expressions of tgfb2, tgfbr1/2, ltbp1/2, serpine1, tsp1, bmp1/4, pdgfbb, igf1, but restored the proteoglycan, dcn Clinically, compared with pathologically normal human subjects, patients with IPF presented local induction of C5aR, local and systemic induction of soluble C5b-9, and amplified expression of C3aR/C5aR in lesions. The blockade of C3aR and C5aR arrested the progression of fibrosis by attenuating local complement activation and TGF-β/bone morphologic protein signaling as well as restoring decorin, which suggests a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with IPF.-Gu, H., Fisher, A.

https://openalex.org/W2294330127,"Background State-level estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) underestimate the obesity epidemic because they use self-reported height and weight. We describe a novel bias-correction method and produce corrected state-level estimates of obesity and severe obesity. Methods Using non-parametric statistical matching, we adjusted self-reported data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2013 (n = 386,795) using measured data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (n = 16,924). We validated our national estimates against NHANES and estimated bias-corrected state-specific prevalence of obesity (BMI≥30) and severe obesity (BMI≥35). We compared these results with previous adjustment methods. Results Compared to NHANES, self-reported BRFSS data underestimated national prevalence of obesity by 16% (28.67% vs 34.01%), and severe obesity by 23% (11.03% vs 14.26%). Our method was not significantly different from NHANES for obesity or severe obesity, while previous methods underestimated both. Only four states had a corrected obesity prevalence below 30%, with four exceeding 40%–in contrast, most states were below 30% in CDC maps. Conclusions Twelve million adults with obesity (including 6.7 million with severe obesity) were misclassified by CDC state-level estimates. Previous bias-correction methods also resulted in underestimates. Accurate state-level estimates are necessary to plan for resources to address the obesity epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W2296711652,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have demonstrated alterations during task-induced brain activation in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients. The interruption to structural integrity of the spinal cord and the resultant disrupted flow of bidirectional communication between the brain and the spinal cord might contribute to the observed dynamic reorganization (neural plasticity). However, the effect of SCI on brain resting-state connectivity patterns remains unclear. We undertook a prospective resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) study to explore changes to cortical activation patterns following SCI. With institutional review board approval, rs-fMRI data was obtained in eleven patients with complete cervical SCI (>2 years post injury) and nine age-matched controls. The data was processed using the Analysis of Functional Neuroimages software. Region of interest (ROI) based analysis was performed to study changes in the sensorimotor network using pre- and post-central gyri as seed regions. Two-sampled t-test was carried out to check for significant differences between the two groups. SCI patients showed decreased functional connectivity in motor and sensory cortical regions when compared to controls. The decrease was noted in ipsilateral, contralateral, and interhemispheric regions for left and right precentral ROIs. Additionally, the left postcentral ROI demonstrated increased connectivity with the thalamus bilaterally in SCI patients. Our results suggest that cortical activation patterns in the sensorimotor network undergo dynamic reorganization following SCI. The presence of these changes in chronic spinal cord injury patients is suggestive of the inherent neural plasticity within the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2295722228,"SDF-1 and CXCR4 are a chemokine and chemokine receptor pair playing critical roles in tumorigenesis. Overexpression of CXCR4 is a hallmark of many hematological malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and generally correlates with a poor prognosis. In this study, we developed a humanized anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody, LY2624587 as a potent CXCR4 antagonist that was advanced into clinical study for cancer. LY2624587 blocked SDF-1 binding to CXCR4 with an IC50 of 0.26 nM, and inhibited SDF-1-induced GTP binding with a Kb of 0.66 nM. In human lymphoma U937 and leukemia CCRF-CEM cells expressing endogenous CXCR4, LY2624587 inhibited SDF-1-induced cell migration with IC50 values of 3.7 and 0.26 nM, respectively. This antibody also inhibited CXCR4 and SDF-1 mediated cell signaling including activation of MAPK and AKT in tumor cells expressing CXCR4. Bifocal microscopic and flow cytometry analyses revealed that LY2624587 mediated receptor internalization and caused CXCR4 down-regulation on the cell surface. In human hematologic cancer cells, LY2624587 caused dose dependent apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In mouse xenograft models developed with human leukemia and lymphoma cells expressing high levels of CXCR4, LY2624587 exhibited dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition and provided significant survival benefit in a disseminated lymphoma model. Collectively, we have demonstrated that CXCR4 inhibition by LY2624587 has the potential for the treatment of human hematological malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2295316676,"The partially de-N-acetylated poly-β-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (dPNAG) polymer serves as an intercellular biofilm adhesin that plays an essential role for the development and maintenance of integrity of biofilms of diverse bacterial species. Translocation of dPNAG across the bacterial outer membrane is mediated by a tetratricopeptide repeat-containing outer membrane protein, PgaA. To understand the molecular basis of dPNAG translocation, we determined the crystal structure of the C-terminal transmembrane domain of PgaA (residues 513–807). The structure reveals that PgaA forms a 16-strand transmembrane β-barrel, closed by four loops on the extracellular surface. Half of the interior surface of the barrel that lies parallel to the translocation pathway is electronegative, suggesting that the corresponding negatively charged residues may assist the secretion of the positively charged dPNAG polymer. In vivo complementation assays in a pgaA deletion bacterial strain showed that a cluster of negatively charged residues proximal to the periplasm is necessary for biofilm formation. Biochemical analyses further revealed that the tetratricopeptide repeat domain of PgaA binds directly to the N-deacetylase PgaB and is critical for biofilm formation. Our studies support a model in which the positively charged PgaB-bound dPNAG polymer is delivered to PgaA through the PgaA-PgaB interaction and is further targeted to the β-barrel lumen of PgaA potentially via a charge complementarity mechanism, thus priming the translocation of dPNAG across the bacterial outer membrane.

It is thought that the N-terminal TPR motifs of PgaA participate in protein-protein interactions in the periplasm, whereas the C terminus of PgaA forms a transmembrane β-barrel pore that is dedicated for the secretion of the partially dPNAG polymers across the outer membrane. De-N-acetylation of PNAG is achieved by the putative lipoprotein PgaB. The partially de-N-acetylated PNAG is the functional form of the exopolysaccharide (14.Itoh Y. Rice J.D. Goller C. Pannuri A.

The positively charged glucosamine residues help to retain the polymer on the bacterial surface by interaction with the negatively charged surface component lipopolysaccharides (22.Amini S.

PgaC, which is predicted to contain multiple transmembrane helices and a cytosolic domain homologous to family 2 glycosyltransferases, is necessary for the synthesis PNAG. Finally, PgaD, a small membrane protein with two predicted transmembrane helices, assists the glycosyltransferase in polymerizing PNAG and is involved in the regulation of PNAG synthesis. The two inner membrane proteins PgaC and PgaD form a complex that functions as a novel type of c-di-GMP receptor wherein ligand binding to the two proteins stabilizes their interaction and allosterically activates PNAG synthesis (25.Steiner S.

The expression of the E. coli pgaABCD operon is tightly regulated. For example, the RNA-binding protein CsrA (carbon storage regulator A) negatively regulates pgaA translation, pgaABCD transcription, and mRNA stability (16.Wang X. Dubey A.K. Suzuki K. Baker C.S.

Unlike various relatively well characterized bacterial protein secretion machineries, mechanisms of exopolysaccharide secretion by outer-membrane secretins remain largely elusive. Recently, structural studies have advanced our understanding of several types of exopolysaccharide secretion across the bacterial outer membrane. For instance, Keiski et al. 28.Keiski C.L. Harwich M.

Despite this progress, many questions regarding how dPNAG, an essential biofilm-supporting exopolysaccharide, is polymerized and translocated across the bacterial outer membrane remain to be answered. Here we present the crystal structure of the PgaA C-terminal transmembrane domain. Structure-based functional studies indicate that a characteristic electronegative patch that lies inside of the secretion pore, in proximity to the periplasm, is important for the translocation of the positively charged dPNAG. In addition, the N-terminal TPR domain of PgaA directly interacts with expolysaccharide N-deacetylase PgaB, which may play an important role in bringing the PgaB-bound dPNAG polymers proximal to the secretion pore. These findings offer an explanation of how the PgaA protein is structured specifically for secreting dPNAG and why fully acetylated PNAG cannot exit from the periplasm to serve as a biofilm-supporting expolysaccharide. DNA coding sequence of the full-length PgaA protein was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using E. coli strain K-12 gemonic DNA (E. coli strain MG1655, ATCC) as template, and the PCR fragments were subsequently cloned into pBAD22 vector under control of the arabinose promoter. The expressed PgaA protein contains a C-terminal six-histidine tag for affinity purification. Initially, we crystallized the full-length PgaA, but the crystals did not diffract beyond ∼10 Å. To obtain high quality crystals for structural determination, the purified full-length PgaA protein was subject to limited proteolysis with trypsin at a molar ratio of 100:1 (protein/enzyme) for 1 h at room temperature. Limited proteolysis produced a stable fragment that corresponds to the C-terminal transmembrane domain of PgaA with a molecular mass of 35 kDa (Fig. 1, A and B). N-terminal sequencing indicated that the N terminus of the fragment starts from residue Ala-511 of PgaA. Subsequently, the DNA coding sequence of this fragment in addition to an N-terminal signal peptide sequence of BamA from E. coli (signal peptide sequence of BamA: MAMKKLLIASLLFSSATVYG) was cloned into pBAD22 vector for overexpression. For purification, cells of E. coli strain sf100 were induced to express the PgaA C-terminal domain by adding 0.2% arabinose for 3 h at 37 °C and lysed on ice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer using a French press high pressure instrument (JN-02C, JNBio Ltd.) at 16,000 p.s.i. Membranes were collected by centrifugation for 40 min at 39,000 × g and solubilized in 1.0% (w/v) lauryldimethylamine oxide (Anatrace) in PBS buffer. After centrifugation for 30 min at 39,000 × g, the supernatant solution was loaded onto a 10-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (metal-chelating-Sepharose, Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 10 volumes of 0.5% lauryldimethylamine oxide in PBS buffer in the presence of 20 mm imidazole. Detergent exchange was performed by washing the column with 5 volumes of 1.0% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Anatrace) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl. The PgaA β barrel protein was eluted with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol, and 0.8% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. Further purification was carried out by gel filtration on Superdex-200 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.8% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. The PgaA β-barrel protein was concentrated to 10 mg ml−1 with a Centricon-30 concentrator (Amicon; molecular mass cutoff, 30 kDa). To improve the phasing power of selenomethionine (Se-Met)single-wavelength anomalous dispersion, two point mutations (L610M and I743M) were introduced into the PgaA β-barrel by overlapping PCR. Se-Met-substituted PgaA β-barrel protein was expressed in E. coli strain sf100 cells by inhibition of the methionine biosynthesis pathway. The cells were grown in M9 minimal medium with 1.5% (v/v) glycerol as carbon sources and induced with 1% arabinose. Purification procedures were as described for the native protein. Crystallization of the PgaA barrel was performed by hanging-drop vapor diffusion at 16 °C by mixing 1 μl each of protein (10 mg ml−1) and reservoir solutions. Initial crystallization conditions were found using a broad screen. After optimization, the best crystals were obtained in a condition that contains 0.1 m NaOAc, pH 4.5, 31% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 0.4 m NaCl, and 0.3 m NDSB-195 (Hampton Research, Additive screenTM 63). The crystals appeared overnight and grew to maximum dimensions of 70 × 70 × 90 μm within 2 weeks. Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen directly from the drop. Native datasets were collected at 100 K at a wavelength of 1.0000 Å at beamline BL17U of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF, China), and Se-Met datasets were collected at the selenium peak (λ = 0.9795 Å) at beamline BL1A of Japanese KEK synchrotron. The data were indexed and scaled with HKL2000 package (31.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to space group P6322 and diffract to 2.8 Å and 3.4 Å for native and Se-Met crystals, respectively. Five of six selenium sites were located using PHENIX (32.Adams P.D. Afonine P.V.

After solvent flattening, electron density maps were generated with useful phases to ∼3.5 Å. An initial model was manually built with the program COOT (33.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23224) Google Scholar) using selenium sites and large amino acid side chains to determine the registry. The model was improved by an iterative process using solvent flattening and model building. This model was used in the subsequent refinement of the native dataset, giving an R factor of 21.5% (Rfree of 26.8%). Residues 567–572 of PgaA in the best-refined structure of the PgaA were not included, presumably because of conformational flexibility.

Growth of planktonic cells after 24 h was determined by absorbance at 600 nm. To measure biofilm formation, planktonic cells were removed by discarding the medium, and the wells were rinsed with water three times. Bound cells were stained with 1.25 volumes (250 μl) of crystal violet solution (Fisher; catalog #255-960B) for 2 min, and the wells were rinsed again three times with water to remove unbound and excess dye.

https://openalex.org/W2293063118,"Our main objective was to analyse the different contributions of relational verbal reasoning (analogical and class inclusion) and executive functioning to metaphor comprehension across development. We postulated that both relational reasoning and executive functioning should predict individual and developmental differences. However, executive functioning would become increasingly involved when metaphor comprehension is highly demanding, either because of the metaphors’ high difficulty (relatively novel metaphors in the absence of a context) or because of the individual’s special processing difficulties, such as low levels of reading experience or low semantic knowledge. Three groups of participants, 11-year-olds, 15-year-olds and young adults, were assessed in different relational verbal reasoning tasks—analogical and class-inclusion—and in executive functioning tasks—updating information in working memory, inhibition, and shifting. The results revealed clear progress in metaphor comprehension between ages 11 and 15 and between ages 15 and 21. However, the importance of executive function in metaphor comprehension was evident by age 15 and was restricted to updating information in working memory and cognitive inhibition. Participants seemed to use two different strategies to interpret metaphors: relational verbal reasoning and executive functioning. This was clearly shown when comparing the performance of the ""more efficient"" participants in metaphor interpretation with that of the ""less efficient” ones. Whereas in the first case none of the executive variables or those associated with relational verbal reasoning were significantly related to metaphor comprehension, in the latter case, both groups of variables had a clear predictor effect."
https://openalex.org/W2295209004,"HIV evades eradication because transcriptionally dormant proviral genomes persist in long-lived reservoirs of resting CD4(+) T cells and myeloid cells, which are the source of viral rebound after cessation of antiretroviral therapy. Dormant HIV genomes readily produce infectious virus upon cellular activation because host transcription factors activated specifically by cell stress and heat shock mediate full-length HIV transcription. The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is overexpressed during heat shock and activates inducible cellular transcription factors. Here we show that heat shock accelerates HIV transcription through induction of Hsp90 activity, which activates essential HIV-specific cellular transcription factors (NF-κB, NFAT, and STAT5), and that inhibition of Hsp90 greatly reduces gene expression mediated by these factors. More importantly, we show that Hsp90 controls virus transcription in vivo by specific Hsp90 inhibitors in clinical development, tanespimycin (17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin) and AUY922, which durably prevented viral rebound in HIV-infected humanized NOD scid IL-2Rγ(-/-) bone marrow-liver-thymus mice up to 11 weeks after treatment cessation. Despite the absence of rebound viremia, we were able to recover infectious HIV from PBMC with heat shock. Replication-competent virus was detected in spleen cells from these nonviremic Hsp90 inhibitor-treated mice, indicating the presence of a tissue reservoir of persistent infection. Our novel findings provide in vivo evidence that inhibition of Hsp90 activity prevents HIV gene expression in replication-competent cellular reservoirs that would typically cause rebound in plasma viremia after antiretroviral therapy cessation. Alternating or supplementing Hsp90 inhibitors with current antiretroviral therapy regimens could conceivably suppress rebound viremia from persistent HIV reservoirs."

O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT/SXC) is essential for Pc repression suggesting that the O-GlcNAcylation of proteins plays a key role in regulating development. OGT transfers O-GlcNAc onto serine and threonine residues in intrinsically disordered domains of key transcriptional regulators; O-GlcNAcase (OGA) removes the modification. To pinpoint genomic regions that are regulated by O-GlcNAc levels, we performed ChIP-chip and microarray analysis after OGT or OGA RNAi knockdown in S2 cells. After OGA RNAi, we observed a genome-wide increase in the intensity of most O-GlcNAc-occupied regions including genes linked to cell cycle, ubiquitin, and steroid response. In contrast, O-GlcNAc levels were strikingly insensitive to OGA RNAi at sites of polycomb repression such as the Hox and NK homeobox gene clusters. Microarray analysis suggested that altered O-GlcNAc cycling perturbed the expression of genes associated with morphogenesis and cell cycle regulation. We then produced a viable null allele of oga (ogadel.1) in Drosophila allowing visualization of altered O-GlcNAc cycling on polytene chromosomes. We found that trithorax (TRX), absent small or homeotic discs 1 (ASH1), and Compass member SET1 histone methyltransferases were O-GlcNAc-modified in ogadel.1 mutants.

https://openalex.org/W2296651878,"Everyone has their own unique version of the visual world and there has been growing interest in understanding the way that personality shapes one's perception. Here, we investigated meaningful visual experiences in relation to the personality dimension of schizotypy. In a novel approach to this issue, a non-clinical sample of subjects (total n = 197) were presented with calibrated images of scenes, cartoons and faces of varying visibility embedded in noise; the spatial properties of the images were constructed to mimic the natural statistics of the environment. In two experiments, subjects were required to indicate what they saw in a large number of unique images, both with and without actual meaningful structure. The first experiment employed an open-ended response paradigm and used a variety of different images in noise; the second experiment only presented a series of faces embedded in noise, and required a forced-choice response from the subjects. The results in all conditions indicated that a high positive schizotypy score was associated with an increased tendency to perceive complex meaning in images comprised purely of random visual noise. Individuals high in positive schizotypy seemed to be employing a looser criterion (response bias) to determine what constituted a 'meaningful' image, while also being significantly less sensitive at the task than those low in positive schizotypy. Our results suggest that differences in perceptual performance for individuals high in positive schizotypy are not related to increased suggestibility or susceptibility to instruction, as had previously been suggested. Instead, the observed reductions in sensitivity along with increased response bias toward seeing something that is not there, indirectly implicated subtle neurophysiological differences associated with the personality dimension of schizotypy, that are theoretically pertinent to the continuum of schizophrenia and hallucination-proneness."

The anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive assays performed were: writhing test; nociception induced by intraplantar formalin injection; leukocyte recruitment to the peritoneal cavity; evaluation of vascular permeability (Evans blue test); and evaluation of mechanical hypernociception (von Frey test). Production of TNF-α, IL-10, myeloperoxidase and the expression of ICAM-1 were also evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post-test (n = 8), with P < 0.05. The EEMT showed antinociceptive activities in writhing test (100–200 mg/kg), in the second phase of the formalin test (50–200 mg/kg), and in mechanical hypernociception (100 mg/kg). EEMT showed an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing neutrophil migration to the peritoneal cavity and in the plantar tissue detected by the reduction of myeloperoxidase activity (100 mg/kg), reduction of IL-10 levels and expression of ICAM-1 in the peritoneal exudate and the mesentery (100 mg/kg), respectively. The four soluble EEMT fractions showed good results in tests for antinociceptive (H, D, E, B) and anti-inflammation (H, D, E). Only sakuranetin showed reduction of the writhing and neutrophil migration (200 mg/kg). Thus, the EEMT and soluble fractions of M. tenuiflora bark demonstrated great antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities, as also sakuranetin. More studies should be conducted to elucidate the mechanism of action of this compound. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the antinociceptive activity of the M. tenuiflora fractions and the bioactive isolated compound sakuranetin in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2295856613,"Deficits of postural control and perceptions of verticality are disabling problems observed in stroke patients that have been recently correlated to each other. However, there is no evidence in the literature confirming this relationship with quantitative posturography analysis. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to analyze the relationship between Subjective Postural Vertical (SPV) and Haptic Vertical (HV) with posturography and functionality in stroke patients. We included 45 stroke patients. The study protocol was composed by clinical interview, evaluation of SPV and HV in roll and pitch planes and posturography. Posturography was measured in the sitting and standing positions under the conditions: eyes open, stable surface (EOSS); eyes closed, stable surface (ECSS); eyes open, unstable surface (EOUS); and eyes closed, unstable surface (ECUS). The median PV in roll plane was 0.34° (-1.44° to 2.54°) and in pitch plane 0.36° (-2.72° to 2.45°). The median of HV in roll and pitch planes were -0.94° (-5.86° to 3.84°) and 3.56° (-0.68° to 8.36°), respectively. SPV in the roll plane was correlated with all posturagraphy parameters in sitting position in all conditions (r = 0.35 to 0.47; p < 0.006). There were moderate correlations with the verticality perceptions and all the functional scales. Linear regression model showed association between speed and SPV in the roll plane in the condition EOSS (R2 of 0.37; p = 0.005), in the condition ECSS (R2 of 0.13; p = 0.04) and in the condition EOUS (R2 of 0.22; p = 0.03). These results suggest that verticality perception is a relevant component of postural control and should be systematically evaluated, particularly in patients with abnormal postural control."
https://openalex.org/W2296150221,"The purpose of this study was to: (i) evaluate the antibacterial activities of three Egyptian honeys collected from different floral sources (namely, citrus, clover, and marjoram) against Escherichia coli; (ii) investigate the effects of these honeys on bacterial ultrastructure; and (iii) assess the anti-virulence potential of these honeys, by examining their impacts on the expression of eight selected genes (involved in biofilm formation, quorum sensing, and stress survival) in the test organism. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the honey samples against E. coli ATCC 8739 were assessed by the broth microdilution assay in the presence and absence of catalase enzyme. Impacts of the honeys on the cellular ultrastructure and the expression profiles of the selected genes of E. coli were examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis, respectively. The susceptibility tests showed promising antibacterial activities of all the tested honeys against E. coli. This was supported by the TEM observations, which revealed “ghost” cells lacking DNA, in addition to cells with increased vacuoles, and/or with irregular shrunken cytoplasm. Among the tested honeys, marjoram exhibited the highest total antibacterial activity and the highest levels of peroxide-dependent activity. The qPCR analysis showed that all honey-treated cells share a similar overall pattern of gene expression, with a trend toward reduced expression of the virulence genes of interest. Our results indicate that some varieties of the Egyptian honey have the potential to be effective inhibitor and virulence modulator of E. coli via multiple molecular targets."
https://openalex.org/W2294516488,"Formyl peptide receptor 3 (Fpr3, also known as Fpr-rs1) is a G protein-coupled receptor expressed in subsets of sensory neurons of the mouse vomeronasal organ, an olfactory substructure essential for social recognition. Fpr3 has been implicated in the sensing of infection-associated olfactory cues, but its expression pattern and function are incompletely understood. To facilitate visualization of Fpr3-expressing cells, we generated and validated two new anti-Fpr3 antibodies enabling us to analyze acute Fpr3 protein expression. Fpr3 is not only expressed in murine vomeronasal sensory neurons but also in bone marrow cells, the primary source for immune cell renewal, and in mature neutrophils. Consistent with the notion that Fpr3 functions as a pathogen sensor, Fpr3 expression in the immune system is up-regulated after stimulation with a bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide). These results strongly support a dual role for Fpr3 in both vomeronasal sensory neurons and immune cells. We also identify a large panel of mouse strains with severely altered expression and function of Fpr3, thus establishing the existence of natural Fpr3 knock-out strains. We attribute distinct Fpr3 expression in these strains to the presence or absence of a 12-nucleotide in-frame deletion (Fpr3Δ424–435). In vitro calcium imaging and immunofluorescence analyses demonstrate that the lack of four amino acids leads to an unstable, truncated, and non-functional receptor protein. The genome of at least 19 strains encodes a non-functional Fpr3 variant, whereas at least 13 other strains express an intact receptor.

In rodents, there is extensive evidence that the detection of chemosensory cues emitted by other individuals is a fundamental feature of social recognition and a prerequisite for a wide range of social behaviors (4Brennan P.A.

Martínez-Marcos A. Structure and function of the vomeronasal system: an update.Prog. Neurobiol. 2003; 70: 245-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The VNO houses vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs), specialized nerve cells that detect a wide range of volatile and non-volatile molecular cues, including pheromones and predator odors (13Tirindelli R.

More recently, clear evidence has emerged that the VNO plays an important role in mediating sick conspecific avoidance and thus seems to function as a sensor of infection (20Boillat M. Challet L.

VSNs are characterized by the expression of large families of G protein-coupled receptors, vomeronasal type 1 receptors (Vmn1r) expressed in the apical vomeronasal layer and vomeronasal type 2 receptor (Vmn2r) that function together with non-classical class I major histocompatibility complex receptors of the H2-Mv subtype in the basal layer (21Mombaerts P.

Fprs are primarily known from the innate immune system where they are involved in chemoattraction of phagocytic immune cells to sites of infection mediating host defense against invading microorganisms (25Fu H.

Hence, members of the Fpr family are currently prime candidates for mediating VNO pathogen sensing, although it cannot be ruled out that some Vmn1r or Vmn2r receptors or even receptors expressed in other olfactory subsystems such as the main olfactory epithelium (30Munger S.D.

Two of these, Fpr1 and Fpr2, are expressed in leukocytes, and like their human orthologues FPR1 and FPR2, they function in innate immune defense (27Migeotte I. Communi D. Parmentier M.

The remaining five Fprs are expressed in non-overlapping subsets of VSNs as follows: Fpr-rs3, Fpr-rs4, Fpr-rs6, and Fpr-rs7 all coexpress with the G protein α-subunit Gαi2, whereas Fpr-rs1 (recently renamed to Fpr3, see Mouse Genome Informatics Database gene ID 1194495) coexpresses with Gαo (23Rivière S.

We previously identified a set of formylated bacterial signal peptides as natural agonists for this receptor (32Bufe B. Schumann T. Kappl R. Bogeski I. Kummerow C. Podgórska M. Smola S. Hoth M.

However, the known expression patterns of both receptors seem to contrast with this idea. Human FPR3 is found in immune cells (34Devosse T. Guillabert A. D'Haene N. Berton A. De Nadai P. Noel S. Brait M. Franssen J.D. Sozzani S. Salmon I. Parmentier M.

Immunol. 2009; 182: 4974-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), but no evidence for its expression in sensory neurons has been reported, possibly due to the fact that a functional VNO is missing in humans (4Brennan P.A. Zufall F. Pheromonal communication in vertebrates.Nature. 2006; 444: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Conversely, careful quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization studies clearly showed that mouse Fpr3 mRNA is present in VSNs, but both studies found no evidence for an expression outside the olfactory system (23Rivière S. Challet L. Fluegge D. Spehr M. Rodriguez I.

So far, only a single report for the presence of low amounts of Fpr3 mRNA in Northern blots from murine leukocytes exists (31Gao J.L. Chen H. Filie J.D. Kozak C.A. Murphy P.M.

Immunol. 2008; 181: 1429-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), despite performing highly sensitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments. However, it is conceivable that Fpr3 protein is present in immune cells and that the failure to detect its expression can be attributed to low mRNA levels. To address these questions, we generated two specific Fpr3 antibodies that enabled the direct detection of Fpr3 protein. We report the expression of Fpr3 not only in murine VSNs but also in bone marrow cells, the primary source for immune cell renewal, and in mature neutrophils. Importantly, we find that Fpr3 expression in the immune system can be up-regulated by stimulation with a bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) that mimics bacterial infection. These findings strongly support a dual role for Fpr3 in both VSNs and immune cells. We also identify and characterize a natural Fpr3 gene variant that leads to a non-functional receptor. This variant is expressed in a wide range of mouse strains, thus identifying the existence of natural Fpr3 knock-out strains. Peptides (15 amino acid residues with an overlap of 10 residues) covering the whole length of Fpr3 were synthesized on acid-hardened cellulose membranes derivatized with a polyethylene glycol spacer. Membranes were equilibrated in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) for 30 min at room temperature. Each antibody was solved at 4 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 5% milk powder, then added to the membrane, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, the membrane was incubated with the corresponding peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter, the membrane was washed twice with PBS for 10 min, incubated with enhanced chemiluminescence solution, and analyzed using a Fusion SL (Peqlab) luminescence imaging system. The polyclonal rabbit antibody Fpr3-ECL1 was generated by an epitope that was determined by epitope mapping of a commercially available antibody (sc-18195; M-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) that weakly detected overexpressed Fpr3 in human embryonic kidney cells containing the simian vacuolating virus 40 T-antigen (HEK293T) at a concentration of 2 μg/ml. The mapping revealed two epitopes, AMKEKWPFGWFLCKL and MQFSGSYKIIGRLVN. Each peptide was synthesized and used to immunize a rabbit. Immunocytochemical tests on HEK293T cells expressing Fpr3 revealed that serum from the AMKEKWPFGWFLCKL-injected rabbit showed strong Fpr3 immunoreactivity, whereas serum from the MQFSGSYKIIGRLVN-injected rabbit did not. After 12 weeks, the animals were sacrificed; whole blood was collected, and Fpr3-ELC1 was purified by affinity chromatography with the sulfo-linked AMKEKWPFGWFLCKL peptide. Fpr3-ELC1 was adjusted to a stock concentration of 2 mg/ml. The monoclonal mouse antibody Fpr3-ECL2 was developed in cooperation with the Abmart Co. Epitope scoring of the Fpr3 sequence was used to determine four peptide sequences (WGNSVEERLNTA, LSEDSGHISDTR, HSLSSRLQRALS, and ITTKIHKKAFV) spanning intracellular, extracellular, and C-terminal epitopes on Fpr3. For immunogen production, these epitopes were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel-affinity chromatography. Each immunogen was then injected into three female 8–12-week-old BALB/C mice. For hybridoma cell generation spleen cells from the best responding mice were fused to SP2/0 myeloma cells. Single parent cell colonies were obtained and tested by ELISA for their ability to bind the antigen. The nine most productive and stable clones were injected into the peritoneal cavity of mice. After 10–14 days ascites fluid was obtained and tested by immunocytochemistry experiments with Fpr3-expressing HEK293T cells. Antibodies produced by a hybridoma cell line against WGNSVEERLNTA were the most sensitive ones. They were used for all Fpr3-ECL2 immunochemistry experiments. Fpr1, Fpr2, Fpr3 (previously known as Fpr-rs1), Fpr-rs3, Fpr-rs4, Fpr-rs6, and Fpr-rs7 were amplified from C57BL/6NJ mice by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Thermo Scientific) as described previously (33Bufe B.

Chem. 2012; 287: 33644-33655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Fpr3Δ424–435 is identical to Fpr3 except for a 12-nucleotide in-frame deletion occurring from base pair 424 to 435. Fpr3Δ424–435 was amplified and subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+)from genomic DNA of 129X1/Sv mice using the Phusion HF Master Mix (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol with the primer and reaction conditions as described (33Bufe B.

Chem. 2012; 287: 33644-33655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The Fpr3Δ424–435 fusion construct was obtained by in-frame subcloning of an Fpr3 PCR product from genomic DNA of 129X1/Sv into a modified pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector containing an N-terminal rhodopsin epitope (Rho tag) and a C-terminal herpes simplex virus epitope (HSV tag). Complete coding sequences of all receptor genes were validated by sequencing. HEK293T PEAKrapid cells (ATCC) were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS, Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin (Sigma), 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), 2 mm l-glutamine (Sigma) until 80–90% confluency. For transfection, cells were seeded at 20–30% confluence on poly-d-lysine-coated (10 μg/ml in PBS) black 96-well μCLEAR-Plates (Greiner Bio-One). Cells were transfected 24 h later using jetPEI® (Polyplus-transfection SA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol for 96-well transfections. For immunocytochemical analyses, 0.25 μg of plasmid DNA encoding a receptor were transfected. For calcium imaging experiments, 0.125 μg of DNA plasmid encoding a receptor were cotransfected with equal amounts of a plasmid encoding the G protein α-subunit Gα16. For strain names, we used the nomenclature employed by the Mouse Genome Informatics database. C57Bl/6NCrl (MGI:2683688), FVB/NCrl (MGI:2165215), and BALB/cJ (MGI:2159737) mice were acquired from Charles River; 129X1/Sv (MGI:2164536) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, and NZB/Ola (MGI:2160555) mice were provided by Reinhart Kluge (Max Rubner Laboratorium, German Institute of Human Nutrition, Potsdam Rehbrücke, Germany). Ear stamps of Mus musculus musculus (Kazakhstan, Czech Republic), Mus musculus domesticus (Germany, France),Mus musculus castaneus (Thailand), and Mus musculus spretus (Spain) were kindly provided by Diethard Tautz (Max-Planck-Institut für Evolutionsbiologie, Plön, Germany). Blood samples were obtained from 8- to 12-week-old mice that were euthanized by CO2. Blood (10 μl) was deposited on a microscope slide (Superfrost Plus; Menzel-Gläser) and smeared immediately. Isolation was performed as described (38Boxio R. Bossenmeyer-Pourié C. Steinckwich N. Dournon C. Nüsse O. Mouse bone marrow contains large numbers of functionally competent neutrophils.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2004; 75: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). 8–12- Week-old mice were euthanized with CO2 and decapitated. Femoral bones were isolated and stored in ice-cold calcium/magnesium-free Hanks’ balanced salt solution buffer (Gibco) containing 10 mm HEPES for 10 min. The epiphysis was removed from both ends, and 1–2 ml of Hanks’ balanced salt solution with HEPES was forced through the bone shaft with a syringe (20-gauge needle) to flush out the bone marrow. The resulting solution was counted with a MOXI Z cell counter (Orflo) using Type S Moxi Z Cassettes (Orflo) and centrifuged at 300 × g (brake on lowest level) for 8 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 5 mm l-glutamine, and 10% (v/v) FCS at a concentration of 4 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were seeded on Petri dishes (∼1 × 107 cells/dish) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Stimulation of bone marrow cells was achieved by adding 150 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide of Salmonella enteriditis (Sigma) into the culture medium of seeded cells. Stimulated and unstimulated samples were incubated for additional 8 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before their use in experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2296435100,"An orchestrated interplay of adaptor and signaling proteins at mechano-sensitive sites is essential to maintain cardiac contractility and when defective leads to heart failure. We recently showed that Integrin-linked Kinase (ILK), ß-Parvin and PINCH form the IPP-complex to grant tuned Protein Kinase B (PKB) signaling in the heart. Loss of one of the IPP-complex components results in destabilization of the whole complex, defective PKB signaling and finally heart failure. Two components of IPP, ILK and ß-Parvin directly bind to Paxillin; however, the impact of this direct interaction on the maintenance of heart function is not known yet. Here, we show that targeted gene inactivation of Paxillin results in progressive decrease of cardiac contractility and heart failure in zebrafish without affecting IPP-complex stability and PKB phosphorylation. However, we found that Paxillin deficiency leads to the destabilization of its known binding partner Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) and vice versa resulting in degradation of Vinculin and thereby heart failure. Our findings highlight an essential role of Paxillin and FAK in controlling cardiac contractility via the recruitment of Vinculin to mechano-sensitive sites in cardiomyocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2296560393,"Strains of serotype 2 Streptococcus suis are responsible for swine and human infections. Different serotype 2 genetic backgrounds have been defined using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). However, little is known about the genetic diversity within each MLST sequence type (ST). Here, we used whole-genome sequencing to test the hypothesis that S. suis serotype 2 strains of the ST25 lineage are genetically heterogeneous. We evaluated 51 serotype 2 ST25 S. suis strains isolated from diseased pigs and humans in Canada, the United States of America, and Thailand. Whole-genome sequencing revealed numerous large-scale rearrangements in the ST25 genome, compared to the genomes of ST1 and ST28 S. suis strains, which result, among other changes, in disruption of a pilus island locus. We report that recombination and lateral gene transfer contribute to ST25 genetic diversity. Phylogenetic analysis identified two main and distinct Thai and North American clades grouping most strains investigated. These clades also possessed distinct patterns of antimicrobial resistance genes, which correlated with acquisition of different integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). Some of these ICEs were found to be integrated at a recombination hot spot, previously identified as the site of integration of the 89K pathogenicity island in serotype 2 ST7 S. suis strains. Our results highlight the limitations of MLST for phylogenetic analysis of S. suis, and the importance of lateral gene transfer and recombination as drivers of diversity in this swine pathogen and zoonotic agent."
https://openalex.org/W2294614149,"Background The objective of our study was the development of a semi-quantitative real-time PCR to detect uropathogens. Two multiplex PCR reactions were designed to detect Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 16S based PCR was performed in parallel to detect Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Firstly to identify non-targeted agents of infection in the same urine specimen, and secondly to quantify background flora. The method was evaluated in comparison with standard bacterial culture, and a commercial PCR kit for detection of uropathogens. Findings Analysis with a known panel of 116 clinical isolates yielded a PCR specificity of 100%. Analysis of urine specimens from 211 patients revealed a high correlation of PCR Cq values with both culture positivity and quantity. Concordance between PCR and culture was 98% when both methods yielded results. PCR was found to be more sensitive than culture. With a cut-off Cq value of 33, the negative predictive value of PCR was 94%. The 16S PCR confirmed most results. One specimen was positive by 16S PCR suggesting another cause of infection not detected by the specific PCR assays. Conclusion We conclude that it is feasible to detect and identify uropathogens by multiplex real-time PCR assay."
https://openalex.org/W2295331254,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) has a poor prognosis due to widespread intrahepatic spread. Aspartate β-hydroxylase (ASPH) is a transmembrane protein and catalyzes the hydroxylation of aspartyl and asparaginyl residues in calcium binding epidermal growth factor (cbEGF)-like domains of various proteins, including Notch receptors and ligands. ASPH is highly overexpressed (>95%) in human CCA tumors. We explored the molecular mechanisms by which ASPH mediated the CCA malignant phenotype and evaluated the potential of ASPH as a therapeutic target for CCA. The importance of expression and enzymatic activity of ASPH for CCA growth and progression was examined using shRNA “knockdown” and a mutant construct that reduced its catalytic activity. Second generation small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) of β-hydroxylase activity were developed and used to target ASPH in vitro and in vivo. Subcutaneous and intrahepatic xenograft rodent models were employed to determine anti-tumor effects on CCA growth and development. It was found that the enzymatic activity of ASPH was critical for mediating CCA progression, as well as inhibiting apoptosis. Mechanistically, ASPH overexpression promoted Notch activation and modulated CCA progression through a Notch1-dependent cyclin D1 pathway. Targeting ASPH with shRNAs or a SMI significantly suppressed CCA growth in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2295612056,"Cowpea (V. unguiculata L. Walp.) is an important tropical grain legume. Asparagus bean (V. unguiculata ssp. sesquipedialis) is a distinctive subspecies of cowpea, which is considered one of the top ten Asian vegetables. It can be adapted to a wide range of environmental stimuli such as drought and heat. Nevertheless, it is an extremely cold-sensitive tropical species. Improvement of chilling tolerance in asparagus bean may significantly increase its production and prolong its supply. However, gene regulation and signaling pathways related to cold response in this crop remain unknown. Using Illumina sequencing technology, modification of global gene expression in response to chilling stress in two asparagus bean cultivars—“Dubai bean” and “Ningjiang-3”, which are tolerant and sensitive to chilling, respectively—were investigated. More than 1.8 million clean reads were obtained from each sample. After de novo assembly, 88,869 unigenes were finally generated with a mean length of 635 bp. Of these unigenes, 41,925 (47.18%) had functional annotations when aligned to public protein databases. Further, we identified 3,510 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Dubai bean, including 2,103 up-regulated genes and 1,407 down-regulated genes. While in Ningjiang-3, we found 2,868 DEGs, 1,786 of which were increasing and the others were decreasing. 1,744 DEGs were commonly regulated in two cultivars, suggesting that some genes play fundamental roles in asparagus bean during cold stress. Functional classification of the DEGs in two cultivars using Mercator pipeline indicated that RNA, protein, signaling, stress and hormone metabolism were five major groups. In RNA group, analysis of TFs in DREB subfamily showed that ICE1-CBF3-COR cold responsive cascade may also exist in asparagus bean. Our study is the first to provide the transcriptome sequence resource for asparagus bean, which will accelerate breeding cold resistant asparagus bean varieties through genetic engineering, and advance our knowledge of the genes involved in the complex regulatory networks of this plant under cold stress."
https://openalex.org/W2299927533,"The loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) is a major pathophysiological feature of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). As nigral DA neurons contain both neuromelanin (NM) and dopamine transporter (DAT), decreased intensities in both NM-sensitive MRI and DAT PET reflect decreased DA neuronal density. This study demonstrates that a more specific metric for the nigral DA neuronal density can be derived with multimodal MRI and PET. Participants were 11 clinically diagnosed PD patients and 10 age and gender matched healthy controls (HCs). Two quantities, the NM-related index (RNM) and the binding potential of the radiotracer [18F]FE-PE2I to DAT (BPND) in SN, were measured for each subject using MRI and PET, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the multimodal data set to estimate principal components. One of the components, PCP, corresponds to a basis vector oriented in a direction where both BPND and RNM increase. The ability of BPND, RNM and PCP to discriminate between HC and PD groups was compared. Correlation analyses between the motor score of the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale and each metric were also performed. PCP, BPND and RNM for PD patients were significantly lower than those for HCs (F = 16.26, P<0.001; F = 6.05, P = 0.008; F = 7.31, P = 0.034, respectively). The differential diagnostic performance between the HC and PD groups as assessed by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was best for PCP (0.94, 95% CI: 0.66-1.00). A significant negative correlation was found between the motor severity score and PCp (R = -0.70, P<0.001) and RNM (R = -0.52, P = 0.015), but not for BPND (R = -0.36, P = 0.110). PCA of multimodal NM-sensitive MRI and DAT PET data provides a metric for nigral DA neuronal density that will help illuminate the pathophysiology of PD in SN. Further studies are required to explore whether PCA is useful for other parkinsonian syndromes."
https://openalex.org/W2294109176,"The segmentation of visible electromagnetic radiation into chromatic categories by the human visual system has been extensively studied from a perceptual point of view, resulting in several colour appearance models. However, there is currently a void when it comes to relate these results to the physiological mechanisms that are known to shape the pre-cortical and cortical visual pathway. This work intends to begin to fill this void by proposing a new physiologically plausible model of colour categorization based on Neural Isoresponsive Colour Ellipsoids (NICE) in the cone-contrast space defined by the main directions of the visual signals entering the visual cortex. The model was adjusted to fit psychophysical measures that concentrate on the categorical boundaries and are consistent with the ellipsoidal isoresponse surfaces of visual cortical neurons. By revealing the shape of such categorical colour regions, our measures allow for a more precise and parsimonious description, connecting well-known early visual processing mechanisms to the less understood phenomenon of colour categorization. To test the feasibility of our method we applied it to exemplary images and a popular ground-truth chart obtaining labelling results that are better than those of current state-of-the-art algorithms."

To determine the importance of Leishmania-encoded MIF, both LmMIF genes were removed to produce an mif(-/-) strain of L. major This mutant strain replicated normally in vitro but had a 2-fold increased susceptibility to clearance by macrophages. Mice infected with mif(-/-) L. major, when compared to the wild-type strain, also showed a 3-fold reduction in parasite burden. Microarray and functional analyses revealed a reduced ability of mif(-/-) L. major to activate antigen-presenting cells, resulting in a 2-fold reduction in T-cell priming. In addition, there was a reduction in inflammation and effector CD4 T-cell formation in mif(-/-) L. major-infected mice when compared to mice infected with wild-type L. major Notably, effector CD4 T cells that developed during infection with mif(-/-) L. major demonstrated statistically significant differences in markers of functional exhaustion, including increased expression of IFN-γ and IL-7R, reduced expression of programmed death-1, and decreased apoptosis. These data support a role for LmMIF in promoting parasite persistence by manipulating the host response to increase the exhaustion and depletion of protective CD4 T cells.-Holowka, T., Castilho, T.

https://openalex.org/W2296537795,"Genetic variation is associated with diseases. As a type of genetic variation occurring with certain regularity and frequency, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is attracting more and more attention because of its great value for research and real-life application. Mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS) acts as a common adaptor molecule for retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), which can recognize foreign RNA, including viral RNA, leading to the induction of type I interferons (IFNs). Therefore, MAVS is thought to be a crucial molecule in antiviral innate immunity. We speculated that genetic variation of MAVS may result in susceptibility to infectious diseases. To assess the risk of viral infection based on MAVS variation, we tested the effects of twelve non-synonymous MAVS coding-region SNPs from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database that result in amino acid substitutions. We found that five of these SNPs exhibited functional alterations. Additionally, four resulted in an inhibitory immune response, and one had the opposite effect. In total, 1,032 human genomic samples obtained from a mass examination were genotyped at these five SNPs. However, no homozygous or heterozygous variation was detected. We hypothesized that these five SNPs are not present in the Japanese population and that such MAVS variations may result in serious immune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2294524569,"At least 50 indigenous groups spread across lowland South America remain isolated and have only intermittent and mostly hostile interactions with the outside world. Except in emergency situations, the current policy of governments in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru towards isolated tribes is a “leave them alone” strategy, in which isolated groups are left uncontacted. However, these no-contact policies are based on the assumption that isolated populations are healthy and capable of persisting in the face of mounting external threats, and that they can maintain population viability in the long-term. Here, we test this assumption by tracking the sizes and movements of cleared horticultural areas made by 8 isolated groups over the last 10–14 years. We used deforestation data derived from remote sensing Landsat satellite sensors to identify clearings, and those were then validated and assessed with high-resolution imagery. We found only a single example of a relatively large and growing population (c. 50 cleared ha and 400 people), whereas all of the other 7 groups exhibited much smaller villages and gardens with no sizable growth through time. These results indicated that the smaller groups are critically endangered, and it prompts an urgent re-thinking of policies toward isolated populations, including plans for well-organized contacts that may help save lives and rescue isolated indigenous populations from imminent extinction."
https://openalex.org/W2295995724,"Adult medusae of Carukia barnesi were collected near Double Island, North Queensland Australia. From 73 specimens, 8 males and 15 females spawned under laboratory conditions. These gametes were artificially mixed which resulted in fertilized eggs. Post fertilization, most eggs developed to an encapsulated planula stage and then paused for between six days and six months prior to hatching as ciliated planulae. The paused stage planulae were negatively buoyant and adhered to substrate. The first planula was produced six days post fertilization, lacked larval ocelli, remained stationary, or moved very slowly for two days prior to metamorphosis into primary polyps. Mature polyps reproduced through asexual reproduction via lateral budding producing ciliated swimming polyps, which in turn settled and developed into secondary polyps. Medusae production for this species was in the form of monodisc strobilation, which left behind polyps able to continue asexual reproduction."

Among them, 48 USgFNAs were performed on 40 patients following RT and 63 USgFNAs on 48 patients without previous RT. The results of USgFNA and the US characteristics were compared between these two groups.USgFNA had a sensitivity of 88.0%, specificity of 91.4%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 88.0%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 91.4% and accuracy of 90.0% in patients without previous RT, and a sensitivity of 97.1%, specificity of 83.3%, PPV of 94.3%, NPV of 90.9% and accuracy of 93.5% in those with previous neck RT. The ranges of the short-axis and long-axis length were 13.3 ± 8.0 mm (mean ± SD) versus 17.8 ± 9.1 mm, and 18.6 ± 9.0 mm versus 24.4 ± 10.9 mm for recurrent LNs from patients with, versus without, previous RT (both ps < 0.05), respectively. 76.5% (26/34) of the recurrent nodes after RT and 48% (12/25) of the recurrent nodes without previous RT exhibited an irregular margin (p < 0.05). Additionally, irradiated recurrent LNs had a significantly decreased percentage of discernable calcification compared with non-irradiated recurrent nodes (48% versus 20.6%, p < 0.05).RT had influence on sonographic characteristics but no influence on USgFNA in diagnosing recurrent LNs in treated OSCC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2296112223,"Plasmodium vivax is most wide spread and a neglected malaria parasite. There is a lack of information on parasite biology of this species. Genome of this parasite encodes for the largest number of tryptophan-rich proteins belonging to 'Pv-fam-a' family and some of them are potential drug/vaccine targets but their functional role(s) largely remains unexplored. Using bacterial and yeast two hybrid systems, we have identified the interacting partners for two of the P. vivax tryptophan-rich antigens called PvTRAg36.6 and PvTRAg56.2. The PvTRAg36.6 interacts with early transcribed membrane protein (ETRAMP) of P.vivax. It is apically localized in merozoites but in early stages it is seen in parasite periphery suggesting its likely involvement in parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) development or maintenance. On the other hand, PvTRAg56.2 interacts with P.vivax merozoite surface protein7 (PvMSP7) and is localized on merozoite surface. Co-localization of PvTRAg56.2 with PvMSP1 and its molecular interaction with PvMSP7 probably suggest that, PvTRAg56.2 is part of MSP-complex, and might assist or stabilize the protein complex at the merozoite surface. In conclusion, the PvTRAg proteins have different sub cellular localizations and specific associated functions during intra-erythrocytic developmental cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2295459033,"Globally, calls for the improvement of science education are frequent and fervent. In parallel, the phenomenon of having Science Faculty with Education Specialties (SFES) within science departments appears to have grown in recent decades. In the context of an interview study of a randomized, stratified sample of SFES from across the United States, we discovered that most SFES interviewed (82%) perceived having professional impacts in the realm of improving undergraduate science education, more so than in research in science education or K-12 science education. While SFES reported a rich variety of efforts towards improving undergraduate science education, the most prevalent reported impact by far was influencing the teaching practices of their departmental colleagues. Since college and university science faculty continue to be hired with little to no training in effective science teaching, the seeding of science departments with science education specialists holds promise for fostering change in science education from within biology, chemistry, geoscience, and physics departments."
https://openalex.org/W2296448751,"In breeding industries, a challenging problem is how to keep genetic diversity over generations. To investigate genetic variation and identify breeding signatures in mass selected lines of Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), three sixth-generation selected lines and four wild populations were assessed using 103 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The genetic diversity data indicated that the selected lines exhibited a significant reduction in the observed heterozygosity and observed number of alleles per locus compared with the wild populations (P≤0.05), indicating the selected lines tended to lose genetic diversity contrasted with the wild populations. The unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) analysis showed that the wild populations and selected lines were not separated into two groups. Using four outlier tests, a total of 17 loci were found under selection at two levels. The global outlier detection suggested that 4 common outlier loci were subject to selection using both the hierarchical island model and Bayesian likelihood approaches. At regional level, 3 SNPs were detected as outlier using at least two outlier tests and one outlier SNP (CgSNP309) was overlapped in the two wild-selected population comparisons. The candidate outlier SNPs provide valuable resources for future association studies in C. gigas."

It remains unknown whether this translates to increased risk of serious statin-associated adverse events amongst Chinese patients.We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of older adults (mean age, 74 years) newly prescribed a statin in Ontario, Canada between 2002 and 2013, where 19,033 Chinese (assessed through a validated surname algorithm) were matched (1:3) by propensity score to 57,099 non-Chinese. This study used linked healthcare databases.The follow-up observation period (mean 1.1, maximum 10.8 years) was similar between groups, as were the reasons for censoring the observation period (end of follow-up, death, or statin discontinuation). Forty-seven percent (47%) of Chinese were initiated on a higher than recommended statin dose. Compared to non-Chinese, Chinese ethnicity did not associate with any of the four serious statin-associated adverse events assessed in this study [rhabdomyolysis hazard ratio (HR) 0.61 (95% CI 0.28 to 1.34), incident diabetes HR 1.02 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.30), acute kidney injury HR 0.90 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.13), or all-cause mortality HR 0.88 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.05)]. Similar results were observed in subgroups defined by statin type and dose.We observed no higher risk of serious statin toxicity in Chinese than matched non-Chinese older adults with similar indicators of baseline health. Regulatory agencies should review available data, including findings from our study, to decide if a change in their statin dosing recommendations for people of Chinese ethnicity is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2301316655,"The mdx mouse is a good genetic and molecular murine model for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a progressive and devastating muscle disease. However, this model is inappropriate for testing new therapies due to its mild phenotype. Here, we transferred the mdx mutation to the 129/Sv strain with the aim to create a more severe model for DMD. Unexpectedly, functional analysis of the first three generations of mdx129 showed a progressive amelioration of the phenotype, associated to less connective tissue replacement, and more regeneration than the original mdxC57BL. Transcriptome comparative analysis was performed to identify what is protecting this new model from the dystrophic characteristics. The mdxC57BL presents three times more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than the mdx129 (371 and 137 DEGs respectively). However, both models present more overexpressed genes than underexpressed, indicating that the dystrophic and regenerative alterations are associated with the activation rather than repression of genes. As to functional categories, the DEGs of both mdx models showed a predominance of immune system genes. Excluding this category, the mdx129 model showed a decreased participation of the endo/exocytic pathway and homeostasis categories, and an increased participation of the extracellular matrix and enzymatic activity categories. Spp1 gene overexpression was the most significant DEG exclusively expressed in the mdx129 strain. This was confirmed through relative mRNA analysis and osteopontin protein quantification. The amount of the 66 kDa band of the protein, representing the post-translational product of the gene, was about 4,8 times higher on western blotting. Spp1 is a known DMD prognostic biomarker, and our data indicate that its upregulation can benefit phenotype. Modeling the expression of the DEGs involved in the mdx mutation with a benign course should be tested as a possible therapeutic target for the dystrophic process."
https://openalex.org/W2295380943,"Physiotherapy with exercises is generally recommended in the treatment of patients with subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS).We aimed to investigate the use of physiotherapy in patients with SIS in Danish hospital settings as part of initial non-surgical treatment and after SIS-related surgery and to evaluate to which extent sex, socio-demographic and clinical factors predict the use of physiotherapy.Using national health registers, we identified 57,311 patients who had a first hospital contact with a diagnosis of ICD-10, groups M75.1-75.9, 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2011. Records of physiotherapy were extracted within 52 weeks after first contact (or until surgery), and for surgically treated patients within 26 weeks after surgery. Predictors of the use of physiotherapy after first contact and after surgery were analysed as time-to-event.Within 52 weeks after first contact, 43% of the patients had physiotherapy and 30% underwent surgery. Within 26 weeks after surgery, 80% had a record of physiotherapy. After first contact and after surgery, exercise was part of physiotherapy in 65% and 84% of the patients, respectively. A public hospital contact, physiotherapy before hospital contact, administrative region, female sex, a diagnosis of other or unspecified disorders (M75.8-M75.9), and surgical procedure predicted higher use of physiotherapy. Low education level predicted slightly lower use of physiotherapy after first contact, but not after surgery.In patients with SIS in Danish hospital settings, physiotherapy was more often used after surgery than as part of initial non-surgical treatment. The use of physiotherapy was less common among men than women, whereas unequal use of physiotherapy in relation to education level was not noticeable. The use of physiotherapy with exercises in initial non-surgical treatment was relatively limited."
https://openalex.org/W2299181745,"Many results have been obtained when studying scientific papers citations databases in a network perspective. Articles can be ranked according to their current in-degree and their future popularity or citation counts can even be predicted. The dynamical properties of such networks and the observation of the time evolution of their nodes started more recently. This work adopts an evolutionary perspective and proposes an original algorithm for the construction of genealogical trees of scientific papers on the basis of their citation count evolution in time. The fitness of a paper now amounts to its in-degree growing trend and a “dying” paper will suddenly see this trend declining in time. It will give birth and be taken over by some of its most prevalent citing “offspring”. Practically, this might be used to trace the successive published milestones of a research field."
https://openalex.org/W2293647937,"A major focus for our laboratory is identifying the molecules and mechanisms that regulate polarized apical protein sorting in hepatocytes, the major epithelial cells of the liver. These trafficking pathways are regulated, in part, by small molecular weight rab GTPases. We chose to investigate rab17, whose expression is restricted to polarized epithelial cells, is enriched in liver, and has been implicated in regulating basolateral to apical transcytosis. To initiate our studies, we generated three recombinant adenoviruses expressing wild type, constitutively active (GTP bound), or dominant-negative (GDP bound) rab17. Immunoblotting revealed rab17 immunoreactive species at 25 kDa (the predicted rab17 molecular mass) and 40 kDa. We determined that mono-sumoylation of the 25-kDa rab17 is responsible for the shift in molecular mass, and that rab17 prenylation is required for sumoylation. We further determined that sumoylation selectively promotes interactions with syntaxin 2 (but not syntaxins 3 or 4) and that these interactions are nucleotide dependent. Furthermore, a K68R-mutated rab17 led to the redistribution of syntaxin 2 and 5′ nucleotidase from the apical membrane to subapical puncta, whereas multidrug resistance protein 2 distributions were not changed. Together these data are consistent with the proposed role of rab17 in vesicle fusion with the apical plasma membrane and further implicate sumoylation as an important mediator of protein-protein interactions. The selectivity in syntaxin binding and apical protein redistribution further suggests that rab17 and syntaxin 2 mediate fusion of transcytotic vesicles at the apical surface.

https://openalex.org/W2295969564,"Phialocephala subalpina belongs to the Phialocephala fortinii s.l.-Acepphala applanata species complex (PAC) forming one of the major groups belonging to the dark septate endophytes (DSE). Depending on the strain, PAC was shown to form neutral to pathogenic associations with its host plant Picea abies. To understand PACs lifestyle we investigated the effect of presence/absence of Picea abies on the transcriptome of strain 6_70_1.PAC strain 6_70_1 was grown in liquid Pachlewski media either induced by its host plant Picea abies or without host plant as a control. Mycelia were harvested in a time course (1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18 days) with and without induction by the host plant and the fungal transcriptome revealed by Illumina sequencing. Differential gene expression analysis over the time course comparing control and treatment at each time point using the 'edgeR glm approach' and a gene enrichment analysis using GO categories were performed.The three main functional groups within differentially expressed genes were 'metabolism', 'transport' and 'cell rescue, defense and virulence'. Additionally, genes especially involved in iron metabolism could be detected by gene set enrichment analysis.In conclusion, we found PAC strain 6_70_1 to be metabolically very active during colonization of its host plant Picea abies. A major shift in functional groups over the time course of this experiment could not be observed but GO categories which were found to be enriched showed different emphasis depending in the day post induction."
https://openalex.org/W2296604334,"Background Cancer patients are at increased risk of persistent depressive and anxiety symptoms and disorders compared to the general population. However, these issues are not always identified, which may worsen the prognosis and increase morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to identify predictor variables (demographic and clinical) for the development of mood and anxiety disorders in cancer outpatients and to propose a probabilistic screening protocol considering these variables and certain standardized screening instruments. Methods A total of 1,385 adults, of both genders, receiving outpatient cancer care were evaluated using a questionnaire and screening instruments. Thereafter, 400 of these subjects responded to the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (SCID-IV) by telephone to confirm or rule out the presence of a Current Major Depressive Episode (CMDE) or Anxiety Disorder (AD). Results Of the patients surveyed, 64% met the criteria for CMDE and 41% for AD. Female gender was found to be a risk factor for both disorders, and the presence of previous psychiatric history and marital status (divorced and widowed) were risk factors for anxiety disorders. When scoring above the recommended cutoff score, the screening instruments also indicated a risk of the studied disorders. Based on these findings, a screening protocol and nomograms were created for the quantification, combination and probabilistic estimate of risk, with accuracy indicators >0.68. Conclusion The prevalence rates for the disorders under study are extremely high in cancer patients. The use of the proposed protocol and nomogram can facilitate rapid and wide screening, thus refining triage and supporting the establishment of criteria for referral to mental health professionals, so that patients can be properly diagnosed and treated."
https://openalex.org/W2295053160,"For centuries, rocking has been used to promote sleep in babies or toddlers. Recent research suggested that relaxation could play a role in facilitating the transition from waking to sleep during rocking. Breathing techniques are often used to promote relaxation. However, studies investigating head motions and body rotations showed that vestibular stimulation might elicit a vestibulo-respiratory response, leading to an increase in respiration frequency. An increase in respiration frequency would not be considered to promote relaxation in the first place. On the other hand, a coordination of respiration to rhythmic vestibular stimulation has been observed. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of different movement frequencies and amplitudes on respiration frequency. Furthermore, we tested whether subjects adapt their respiration to movement frequencies below their spontaneous respiration frequency at rest, which could be beneficial for relaxation. Twenty-one healthy subjects (24-42 years, 12 males) were investigated using an actuated bed, moving along a lateral translation. Following movement frequencies were applied: +30%, +15%, -15%, and -30% of subjects' rest respiration frequency during baseline (no movement). Furthermore, two different movement amplitudes were tested (Amplitudes: 15 cm, 7.5 cm; movement frequency: 0.3 Hz). In addition, five subjects (25-28 years, 2 males) were stimulated with their individual rest respiration frequency. Rocking movements along a lateral translation caused a vestibulo-respiratory adaptation leading to an increase in respiration frequency. The increase was independent of the applied movement frequencies or amplitudes but did not occur when stimulating with subjects' rest respiration frequency. Furthermore, no synchronization of the respiration frequency to the movement frequency was observed. In particular, subjects did not lower their respiration frequency below their resting frequency. Hence, it was not feasible to influence respiration in a manner that might be considered beneficial for relaxation."
https://openalex.org/W2295536829,"High-throughput sequencing can produce hundreds of thousands of 16S rRNA sequence reads corresponding to different organisms present in the environmental samples. Typically, analysis of microbial diversity in bioinformatics starts from pre-processing followed by clustering 16S rRNA reads into relatively fewer operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The OTUs are reliable indicators of microbial diversity and greatly accelerate the downstream analysis time. However, existing hierarchical clustering algorithms that are generally more accurate than greedy heuristic algorithms struggle with large sequence datasets. To keep pace with the rapid rise in sequencing data, we present CLUSTOM-CLOUD, which is the first distributed sequence clustering program based on In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG) technology–a distributed data structure to store all data in the main memory of multiple computing nodes. The IMDG technology helps CLUSTOM-CLOUD to enhance both its capability of handling larger datasets and its computational scalability better than its ancestor, CLUSTOM, while maintaining high accuracy. Clustering speed of CLUSTOM-CLOUD was evaluated on published 16S rRNA human microbiome sequence datasets using the small laboratory cluster (10 nodes) and under the Amazon EC2 cloud-computing environments. Under the laboratory environment, it required only ~3 hours to process dataset of size 200 K reads regardless of the complexity of the human microbiome data. In turn, one million reads were processed in approximately 20, 14, and 11 hours when utilizing 20, 30, and 40 nodes on the Amazon EC2 cloud-computing environment. The running time evaluation indicates that CLUSTOM-CLOUD can handle much larger sequence datasets than CLUSTOM and is also a scalable distributed processing system. The comparative accuracy test using 16S rRNA pyrosequences of a mock community shows that CLUSTOM-CLOUD achieves higher accuracy than DOTUR, mothur, ESPRIT-Tree, UCLUST and Swarm. CLUSTOM-CLOUD is written in JAVA and is freely available at http://clustomcloud.kopri.re.kr."
https://openalex.org/W2300617296,"Previous reports indicated that various dysfunctions caused by stroke affect the level of independence in dressing. These dysfunctions can be hierarchical, and these effects on dressing performance can be complicated in stroke patients. However, there are no published reports focusing on the hierarchical structure of the relationships between the activities of daily living and balance function, motor and sensory functions of the affected lower limb, strength of the abdominal muscles and knee extension on the unaffected side, and visuospatial deficits. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the hierarchical and causal relationships between dressing performance and these dysfunctions in stroke patients. This retrospective study included 104 first-time stroke patients. The causal relationship between the dressing performance and age, time post stroke, balance function, motor and sensory functions of the affected lower limb, strength of the abdominal muscles and knee extension on the unaffected side, and visuospatial deficits were examined using path analysis. A hypothetical path model was created based on previous studies, and the goodness of fit between the data and model were verified. A modified path model was created that achieved an almost perfect fit to the data. Balance function and abdominal muscle strength have direct effects on dressing performance, with standardized direct effect estimates of 0.78 and 0.15, respectively. Age, motor and sensory functions of the affected lower limb, and strength of abdominal muscle and knee extension on the unaffected side have indirect effects on dressing by influencing balance function. Our results suggest that dressing performance depends strongly on balance function, and it is mainly influenced by the motor function of the affected lower limb."
https://openalex.org/W2332466577,"Transcriptomic studies help to further our understanding of gene function. Human transcriptomic studies tend to focus on a particular subset of tissue types or a particular disease state; however, it is possible to collate into a compendium multiple studies that have been profiled using the same expression analysis platform to provide an overview of gene expression levels in many different tissues or under different conditions. In order to increase the knowledge and understanding we gain from such studies, intuitive visualization of gene expression data in such a compendium can be useful. The Human eFP (""electronic Fluorescent Pictograph"") Browser presented here is a tool for intuitive visualization of large human gene expression data sets on pictographic representations of the human body as gene expression ""anatograms"". Pictographic representations for new data sets may be generated easily.

Hence, the aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of WHP programs intervention from 2003 to 2007. The intervention group consisted of 838 business entities which had ever undergone counseling of the three centers in northern, central, and southern Taiwan from 2003 to 2007. The control group was composed of 1000 business entities randomly selected from the business directories of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan. The questionnaire survey included general company profiles and the assessment of workplace health according to the five action areas of the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion. We have received 447 (53.3%) questionnaires from the intervention group and 97 questionnaires from the control group. The intervention group was more effective in using the external resources and medical consultation, and they had better follow-up rates of the abnormal results of annual health examinations. Compared to the control group, the intervention group had a significantly decreased smoking rate in 246 companies (61.2%) and a reduced second-hand smoke exposure in 323 companies (78.6%) (p<0.001). By means of the intervention of WHP programs, we can enhance the awareness of the enterprises and the employees to improve worksite health and to create a healthy work environment."
https://openalex.org/W2295741860,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been found to produce pro- but also anti-epileptic effects. Thus, its validity as a therapeutic target must be verified using advanced tools designed to block or to enhance its signal. The aim of this study was to develop tools to silence the BDNF signal. We generated Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) derived amplicon vectors, i.e. viral particles containing a genome of 152 kb constituted of concatameric repetitions of an expression cassette, enabling the expression of the gene of interest in multiple copies. HSV-1 based amplicon vectors are non-pathogenic and have been successfully employed in the past for gene delivery into the brain of living animals. Therefore, amplicon vectors should represent a logical choice for expressing a silencing cassette, which, in multiple copies, is expected to lead to an efficient knock-down of the target gene expression. Here, we employed two amplicon-based BDNF silencing strategies. The first, antisense, has been chosen to target and degrade the cytoplasmic mRNA pool of BDNF, whereas the second, based on the convergent transcription technology, has been chosen to repress transcription at the BDNF gene. Both these amplicon vectors proved to be effective in down-regulating BDNF expression in vitro, in BDNF-expressing mesoangioblast cells. However, only the antisense strategy was effective in vivo, after inoculation in the hippocampus in a model of status epilepticus in which BDNF mRNA levels are strongly increased. Interestingly, the knocking down of BDNF levels induced with BDNF-antisense was sufficient to produce significant behavioral effects, in spite of the fact that it was produced only in a part of a single hippocampus. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a reliable effect of amplicon vectors in knocking down gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, this approach may find broad applications in neurobiological studies."
https://openalex.org/W2299303203,"Low complexity protein sequences are often intrinsically unstructured and many have the potential to polymerize into amyloid aggregates including filaments and hydrogels. RNA-binding proteins are unusually enriched in such sequences raising the question as to what function these domains serve in RNA metabolism. One such yeast protein, Nab3, is an 802 amino acid termination factor that contains an RNA recognition motif and a glutamine/proline rich domain adjacent to a region with structural similarity to a human hnRNP. A portion of the C-terminal glutamine/proline-rich domain assembles into filaments that organize into a hydrogel. Here we analyze the determinants of filament formation of the isolated low complexity domain as well as examine the polymerization properties of full-length Nab3. We found that the C-terminal region with structural homology to hnRNP-C is not required for assembly, nor is an adjacent stretch of 16 glutamines. However, reducing the overall glutamine composition of this 134-amino acid segment from 32% to 14% destroys its polymerization ability. Importantly, full-length wildtype Nab3 also formed filaments with a characteristic cross-β structure which was dependent upon the glutamine/proline-rich region. When full length Nab3 with reduced glutamine content in its low complexity domain was exchanged for wildtype Nab3, cells were not viable. This suggests that polymerization of Nab3 is normally required for its function. In an extension of this idea, we show that the low complexity domain of another yeast termination factor, Pcf11, polymerizes into amyloid fibers and a hydrogel. These findings suggest that, like many other RNA binding proteins, termination factors share a common biophysical trait that may be important for their function."
https://openalex.org/W2307723076,"Eelgrass beds are an important source of primary production in coastal ecosystems. Understanding seasonal variation in the abundance and distribution of eelgrass is important for conservation, and the objectives of this study were to 1) monitor seasonal variation in eelgrass beds using an acoustic monitoring method (Quantitative echo sounder) and 2) broadly quantify the carbon circulation function. We obtained acoustic data of eelgrass beds in coastal areas north and east of Ikunojima Island. Surveys were conducted nine times over the 3-year period from 2011 to 2013 in order to monitor seasonal variation. Acoustic data were obtained and used to estimate the spatial distribution of eelgrass by geostatistical methods. To determine supporting services, we determined carbon sink and carbon fixation by eelgrass beds using data from the National Research Institute of Fisheries and Environment of Inland Sea (2011). The height and distribution of eelgrass beds were at a maximum in May and at a minimum in November of each year. Distribution trends were different between the north and east areas. Supporting services showed the same patterns throughout the year. The area of distribution was considered to be coincident with the life history of eelgrass. Distribution differed by area and changed yearly due to the effects of bottom characteristics and wind direction. Quantifying the supporting services of eelgrass beds was shown to be useful for managing the conservation of coastal ecosystems."

The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the presence of the understory and climatic season in the region (wet or dry) can increase the richness and abundance of Hymenoptera parasitoids in Eucalyptus plantations, in the municipality of Belo Oriente, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. In each eucalyptus cultivation (five areas of cultivation) ten Malaise traps were installed, five with the understory and five without it. A total of 9,639 individuals from 30 families of the Hymenoptera parasitoids were collected, with Mymaridae, Scelionidae, Encyrtidae and Braconidae being the most collected ones with 4,934, 1,212, 619 and 612 individuals, respectively. The eucalyptus stands with and without the understory showed percentage of individuals 45.65% and 54.35% collected, respectively. The understory did not represent a positive effect on the overall abundance of the individuals Hymenoptera in the E. grandis stands, but rather exerted a positive effect on the specific families of the parasitoids of this order."
https://openalex.org/W2309658429,"This paper proposes a new formulation for the multi-objective optimal power flow (MOOPF) problem for meshed power networks considering distributed generation. An efficacious multi-objective fuzzy linear programming optimization (MFLP) algorithm is proposed to solve the aforementioned problem with and without considering the distributed generation (DG) effect. A variant combination of objectives is considered for simultaneous optimization, including power loss, voltage stability, and shunt capacitors MVAR reserve. Fuzzy membership functions for these objectives are designed with extreme targets, whereas the inequality constraints are treated as hard constraints. The multi-objective fuzzy optimal power flow (OPF) formulation was converted into a crisp OPF in a successive linear programming (SLP) framework and solved using an efficient interior point method (IPM). To test the efficacy of the proposed approach, simulations are performed on the IEEE 30-busand IEEE 118-bus test systems. The MFLP optimization is solved for several optimization cases. The obtained results are compared with those presented in the literature. A unique solution with a high satisfaction for the assigned targets is gained. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MFLP technique in terms of solution optimality and rapid convergence. Moreover, the results indicate that using the optimal DG location with the MFLP algorithm provides the solution with the highest quality."
