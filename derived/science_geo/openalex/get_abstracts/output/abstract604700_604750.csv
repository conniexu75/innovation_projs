https://openalex.org/W2607669908,"We report the sequencing and assembly of a reference genome for the human GM12878 Utah/Ceph cell line using the MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) nanopore sequencer. 91.2 Gb of sequence data, representing ∼30× theoretical coverage, were produced. Reference-based alignment enabled detection of large structural variants and epigenetic modifications. De novo assembly of nanopore reads alone yielded a contiguous assembly (NG50 ∼3 Mb). We developed a protocol to generate ultra-long reads (N50 > 100 kb, read lengths up to 882 kb). Incorporating an additional 5× coverage of these ultra-long reads more than doubled the assembly contiguity (NG50 ∼6.4 Mb). The final assembled genome was 2,867 million bases in size, covering 85.8% of the reference. Assembly accuracy, after incorporating complementary short-read sequencing data, exceeded 99.8%. Ultra-long reads enabled assembly and phasing of the 4-Mb major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus in its entirety, measurement of telomere repeat length, and closure of gaps in the reference human genome assembly GRCh38."

Here, we show that cDC1 accumulation in mouse tumors often depends on natural killer (NK) cells that produce the cDC1 chemoattractants CCL5 and XCL1. Similarly, in human cancers, intratumoral CCL5, XCL1, and XCL2 transcripts closely correlate with gene signatures of both NK cells and cDC1 and are associated with increased overall patient survival. Notably, tumor production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) leads to evasion of the NK cell-cDC1 axis in part by impairing NK cell viability and chemokine production, as well as by causing downregulation of chemokine receptor expression in cDC1. Our findings reveal a cellular and molecular checkpoint for intratumoral cDC1 recruitment that is targeted by tumor-derived PGE2 for immune evasion and that could be exploited for cancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2787206763,"Despite the utility of CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases for genome editing, the potential for off-target activity limits their application, especially for therapeutic purposes. We developed a yeast-based assay to identify optimized Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) variants that enables simultaneous evaluation of on- and off-target activity. We screened a library of SpCas9 variants carrying random mutations in the REC3 domain and identified mutations that increased editing accuracy while maintaining editing efficiency. We combined four beneficial mutations to generate evoCas9, a variant that has fidelity exceeding both wild-type (79-fold improvement) and rationally designed Cas9 variants (fourfold average improvement), while maintaining near wild-type on-target editing efficiency (90% median residual activity). Evaluating evoCas9 on endogenous genomic loci, we demonstrated a substantially improved specificity and observed no off-target sites for four of the eight single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) tested. Finally, we showed that following long-term expression (40 d), evoCas9 strongly limited the nonspecific cleavage of a difficult-to-discriminate off-target site and fully abrogated the cleavage of two additional off-target sites."

These data implicate a unique role for TBK1 in mediating bidirectional crosstalk between energy sensing and inflammatory signaling pathways in both over- and undernutrition. Obesity results from a positive energy balance, when food intake exceeds energy expenditure. Although energy intake and expenditure are tightly coupled to ensure homeostasis (Hall et al., 2012Hall K.D. Heymsfield S.B. Kemnitz J.W. Klein S. Schoeller D.A. Speakman J.R. Energy balance and its components: implications for body weight regulation.Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2012; 95: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), even a slight mismatch over time can result in massive weight gain and glucose intolerance. While short-term nutritional overload is associated with increased energy expenditure in both rodents (Pazos et al., 2015Pazos P. Lima L. Tovar S. González-Touceda D. Diéguez C. García M.C. Divergent responses to thermogenic stimuli in BAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue from interleukin 18 and interleukin 18 receptor 1-deficient mice.Sci.

Caloric restriction also reduces energy expenditure, resulting in lower basal metabolic rate, in an attempt to defend body weight (Leibel et al., 1995Leibel R.L. Rosenbaum M. Hirsch J. Changes in energy expenditure resulting from altered body weight.N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). Thus, both over- and undernutrition are associated with reduced energy expenditure. A great deal of basal energy metabolism occurs in adipose tissue, due to both nonshivering thermogenesis and lipid oxidation (Guilherme et al., 2008Guilherme A. Virbasius J.V. Puri V. Czech M.P. Adipocyte dysfunctions linking obesity to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). Among the mechanisms that control energy expenditure are activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator that senses energy status and responds by increasing lipid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis, while reducing lipogenesis and glycogenesis (Daval et al., 2006Daval M. Foufelle F. Ferré P. Functions of AMP-activated protein kinase in adipose tissue.J. Physiol. 2006; 574: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, Hardie, 2011Hardie D.G. AMP-activated protein kinase: an energy sensor that regulates all aspects of cell function.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1895-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). AMPK is a heterotrimeric protein activated by liver kinase B1 (LKB1) via phosphorylation at Thr172 in the AMPKα subunit (Shaw et al., 2004Shaw R.J. Kosmatka M. Bardeesy N. Hurley R.L. Witters L.A. DePinho R.A. Cantley L.C. The tumor suppressor LKB1 kinase directly activates AMP-activated kinase and regulates apoptosis in response to energy stress.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 3329-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). The enzyme is also allosterically activated in response to energy stress by sensing an increased AMP/ATP ratio (Hardie et al., 2012Hardie D.G. Ross F.A. Hawley S.A.

Shaw R.J. The AMPK signalling pathway coordinates cell growth, autophagy and metabolism.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar). Activation of AMPK increases lipid oxidation, represses lipogenesis, and significantly increases mitochondrial biogenesis through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α (PGC1α) (Cantó and Auwerx, 2009Cantó C.

AMPK can also increase autophagy via phosphorylation and activation of Unc-51-like autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1) (Kim et al., 2011Kim J. Kundu M. Viollet B. Guan K.L. AMPK and mTOR regulate autophagy through direct phosphorylation of Ulk1.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (4513) Google Scholar). The AMPK/ULK1 axis is required for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and also increases the browning of inguinal white adipose tissues (Mottillo et al., 2016Mottillo E.P. Desjardins E.M. Crane J.D. Smith B.K. Green A.E. Ducommun S. Henriksen T.I. Rebalka I.A. Razi A.

Moreover, studies have demonstrated a correlation between decreased AMPK activity and increased inflammation (Gauthier et al., 2011Gauthier M.S. O’Brien E.L. Bigornia S. Mott M. Cacicedo J.M. Xu X.J. Gokce N. Apovian C. Ruderman N.

Res. Commun. 2011; 404: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), while activation of AMPK decreases expression of proinflammatory mediators and attenuates inflammation (Huang et al., 2015Huang B.P. Lin C.H. Chen H.M. Lin J.T. Cheng Y.F. Kao S.H.

(Berl.). 2011; 89: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Interestingly, AMPK activity is reduced in both obese rodents (Martin et al., 2006Martin T.L. Alquier T. Asakura K. Furukawa N.

Numerous studies in both rodent models and humans indicate that obesity generates a state of chronic inflammation in adipose tissue, which in turn leads to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (Reilly and Saltiel, 2017Reilly S.M.

This inflammation is generated by recruitment and activation of immune cells, especially proinflammatory macrophages (Lumeng and Saltiel, 2011Lumeng C.N. Saltiel A.R.

Monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1/Ccl2) is produced by adipocytes during obesity and is required for macrophage infiltration (Kamei et al., 2006Kamei N. Tobe K. Suzuki R. Ohsugi M. Watanabe T. Kubota N. Ohtsuka-Kowatari N. Kumagai K. Sakamoto K. Kobayashi M. et al.Overexpression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in adipose tissues causes macrophage recruitment and insulin resistance.J.

Invest. 2006; 116: 1494-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar). In turn, proinflammatory cytokines secreted by immune cells in adipose tissue disrupt insulin action in adipocytes (Hotamisligil et al., 1995Hotamisligil G.S. Arner P. Caro J.F. Atkinson R.L.

The nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway plays an important role in the development of inflammation and insulin resistance in adipose tissue (Arkan et al., 2005Arkan M.C. Hevener A.L. Greten F.R. Maeda S. Li Z.W. Long J.M. Wynshaw-Boris A. Poli G. Olefsky J. Karin M. IKK-beta links inflammation to obesity-induced insulin resistance.Nat.

Westcott D. et al.The protein kinase IKKepsilon regulates energy balance in obese mice.Cell. 2009; 138: 961-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). NF-κB is activated by the canonical IκB kinases (IKKs), IKKα and IKKβ, which phosphorylate IκB, leading to its degradation and release of NF-κB (Lawrence, 2009Lawrence T. The nuclear factor NF-kappaB pathway in inflammation.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2009; 1: a001651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2830) Google Scholar). Unlike IKKα and β, the noncanonical IKKs, IKKε, and TBK1 are induced downstream of NF-κB activation (Reilly et al., 2013Reilly S.M. Chiang S.H. Decker S.J. Chang L. Uhm M. Larsen M.J. Rubin J.R. Mowers J. White N.M. Hochberg I. et al.An inhibitor of the protein kinases TBK1 and IKK-ε improves obesity-related metabolic dysfunctions in mice.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) also can be activated by phosphorylation in response to proinflammatory cytokines or other substances that bind to Toll-like receptors 3 and 4 (Perry et al., 2004Perry A.K. Chow E.K. Goodnough J.B. Yeh W.C. Cheng G. Differential requirement for TANK-binding kinase-1 in type I interferon responses to toll-like receptor activation and viral infection.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), although the upstream kinase that phosphorylates TBK1 remains unknown. Previous studies from our group showed that the activities of IKKε and TBK1 are significantly increased in adipose tissue of HFD-fed mice (Reilly et al., 2013Reilly S.M. Chiang S.H. Decker S.J. Chang L. Uhm M. Larsen M.J. Rubin J.R. Mowers J. White N.M. Hochberg I. et al.An inhibitor of the protein kinases TBK1 and IKK-ε improves obesity-related metabolic dysfunctions in mice.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and further that IKKε deficiency partially protects mice from HFD-induced systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis (Chiang et al., 2009Chiang S.H. Bazuine M. Lumeng C.N. Geletka L.M. Mowers J. White N.M. Ma J.T. Zhou J. Qi N. Westcott D. et al.The protein kinase IKKepsilon regulates energy balance in obese mice.Cell. 2009; 138: 961-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). However, how TBK1 might influence glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis remains uncertain. Here, we report that Tbk1 expression and activity are significantly increased in mature adipocytes of HFD-fed mice. To investigate the roles of adipocyte TBK1, we generated adipocyte-specific TBK1 knockout (ATKO) mice, because whole-body KO of TBK1 is lethal (Delhase et al., 2012Delhase M. Kim S.Y. Lee H. Naiki-Ito A. Chen Y. Ahn E.R. Murata K. Kim S.J. Lautsch N. Kobayashi K.S. et al.TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) controls cell survival through PAI-2/serpinB2 and transglutaminase 2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E177-E186Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Adipose-specific TBK1 deficiency attenuates HFD-induced obesity, due to dramatically increased oxygen consumption and energy expenditure in white adipose tissue of obese, but not normal weight, mice. This was explained by increased activity of AMPK. In vitro studies revealed that AMPK is a direct substrate of TBK1 and further that TBK1 mediates the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-induced repression of AMPK activity. At the same time, AMPK activation reciprocally increased the activity of TBK1; this effect is indirect and mediated by the AMPK downstream kinase ULK1, which directly phosphorylates TBK1 at Ser172. This infers a negative feedback loop in which AMPK activity is limited when activated, perhaps explaining in part the repression of energy expenditure during caloric restriction. Surprisingly, TBK1 KO in adipocytes led to increased activation of NF-κB, with upregulation of MCP1 production from adipocytes and macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue, accompanied by exaggerated insulin resistance in HFD-fed mice. The anti-inflammatory effect of TBK1 is mediated by phosphorylation of NIK, which results in its degradation and reduced activity of the atypical NF-κB pathway. The loss of TBK1 thus substantially attenuates the AMPK-induced negative regulation of NF-κB, showing that TBK1 is essential for the inhibitory crosstalk between AMPK and proinflammatory signaling. Taken together, these data reveal an unexpected role for TBK1 in both feedback and bidirectional crosstalk between energy sensing and inflammatory pathways in adipocytes to ensure energy homeostasis. We previously demonstrated that TBK1 activity is induced by TNF-α and increased in adipose tissue of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice (Reilly et al., 2013Reilly S.M. Chiang S.H. Decker S.J. Chang L. Uhm M. Larsen M.J. Rubin J.R. Mowers J. White N.M. Hochberg I. et al.An inhibitor of the protein kinases TBK1 and IKK-ε improves obesity-related metabolic dysfunctions in mice.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Tbk1 expression is significantly upregulated in mature adipocytes derived from both inguinal (iWAT) and epididymal WAT (eWAT) in HFD-fed compared to normal diet (ND)-fed mice (Figure 1A). We generate adipocyte-specific TBK1 KO mice by crossing floxed TBK1 (Flox) mice with adiponectin-Cre mice. ATKO mice have greater than a 50% decrease of Tbk1 mRNA in both eWAT and iWAT, without any change of expression in the liver (Figure 1B), reflecting complete reduction of TBK1 in adipocytes, with residual protein present in other adipose tissue cells (Jeffery et al., 2014Jeffery E. Berry R. Church C.D. Yu S. Shook B.A. Horsley V. Rosen E.D. Rodeheffer M.S. Characterization of Cre recombinase models for the study of adipose tissue.Adipocyte. 2014; 3: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Adipocyte-specific TBK1 KO has no effect on body weight or composition in ND-fed mice (Figures S1A–S1E). However, TBK1-deficient mice tend to be leaner and have a lower body weight when fed a HFD, although this difference was not statistically significant (Figures 1C–1E). DEXA scanning revealed that ATKO mice have significantly less fat mass (Figures 1D, 1F, and 1G). In addition, weights of both eWAT and iWAT were significantly reduced in ATKO mice, with no difference in brown adipose tissue (BAT) or liver (Figures 1C and 1H). While TBK1 deficiency did not affect oxygen consumption rate (OCR) or energy expenditure (EE) in ND-fed mice (Figures 1I and 1J), ATKO mice exhibited dramatically increased OCR and EE after HFD (Figures 1K and 1L). Although a HFD inhibited OCR and EE in both Flox and ATKO mice, TBK1 deficiency significantly attenuated the reduction of OCR observed after a HFD. TBK1 KO did not affect respiratory exchange rate (RER) or activity in either ND- or HFD-fed mice (Figures S1F–S1I). Moreover, adipocyte-specific TBK1 KO had no effect on food intake (Figure S1J) or body temperature (Figure S1K) of ND- or HFD-fed mice. Adipocyte size was significantly decreased in HFD-fed ATKO mice (Figure 2A), suggesting that TBK1 deficiency attenuates HFD-induced adipocyte hypertrophy. Loss of TBK1 significantly increased ex vivo OCR in both WATs of HFD-fed mice (Figure 2B). This increase was accompanied by a significant upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis genes such as Ppargc1a, as well as the mitochondrial genes Ndufs7, Cox4i1, Cox5b, Cox8a, and Atp5d, all of which belong to different complexes in the respiratory chain (Figures 2C and 2D). Moreover, expression of the thermogenic gene Ucp1 did not change (Figure 2D), a finding consistent with no major change in body temperature in ATKO mice.

Hasenfuss S.C. et al.A creatine-driven substrate cycle enhances energy expenditure and thermogenesis in beige fat.Cell. 2015; 163: 643-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), and mice lacking this cycle have reduced EE and greater HFD-induced obesity (Kazak et al., 2017Kazak L. Chouchani E.T. Lu G.Z. Jedrychowski M.P. Bare C.J. Mina A.I. Kumari M. Zhang S. Vuckovic I.

There was significant upregulation of Ckmt1 expression in eWAT and Gamt expression in iWAT, suggesting increased activity of the creatine cycle in ATKO mice (Figures S2B and S2C). Staining of WATs with MitoTracker also confirmed a substantial increase of mitochondria in adipocytes of HFD-fed ATKO mice (Figure 2E). Likewise, NAD/NADH ratio was significantly increased in eWAT, and only slightly increased in iWAT from ATKO mice (Figure 2F). The significant upregulation of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL/Lipe) and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL/Pnpla2) in iWAT, but not eWAT (Figures S2D and S2E), could lead to elevation of lipolysis and lipid oxidation in iWAT, potentially attenuating the elevation of NAD/NADH ratio produced by increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Taken together, our data indicate a mitochondria-driven increase of catabolism in WATs of ATKO mice. Sympathetic activation of adipose tissue increases cAMP levels, and induces mitochondrial biogenesis (Wu et al., 1999Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G. Mootha V. Troy A. Cinti S.

Mechanisms controlling mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration through the thermogenic coactivator PGC-1.Cell. 1999; 98: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3176) Google Scholar). TBK1 KO did not affect cAMP levels in HFD-fed mice (Figure S2F), nor was there a change in response to β-adrenergic stimulation (Figures S2G and S2H), suggesting that TBK1 plays no role in controlling catecholamine sensitivity, unlike that proposed for IKKε (Mowers et al., 2013Mowers J. Uhm M. Reilly S.M. Simon J. Leto D. Chiang S.H. Chang L. Saltiel A.R. Inflammation produces catecholamine resistance in obesity via activation of PDE3B by the protein kinases IKKε and TBK1.eLife. 2013; 2: e01119Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). While a slight increase of basal lipolysis in iWAT was observed because of upregulated expression of Lipe and Pnpla2 (Figure S2H and S2E), TBK1 deficiency did not affect serum triglycerides and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations (Figures S2I and S2J). However, TBK1 deficiency substantially upregulated AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation in both eWAT and iWAT, but not BAT, of HFD-fed (Figures 2G, 2H, and S2K), but not ND-fed (Figures S2M and S2N), mice. The lack of effect on BAT is likely because TBK1 expression is not significantly induced in BAT that has lower inflammation (Figure S2L). There was no difference in AMP/ATP or ADP/ATP ratios between HFD-fed ATKO and Flox mice (Figures S2O and S2P). HFD feeding significantly decreased AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation in adipose tissue (Figure 2I). TNF-α decreased AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation within 30mi"
https://openalex.org/W2790187710,"Nuclear receptors regulate gene expression in response to environmental cues, but the molecular events governing the cell type specificity of nuclear receptors remain poorly understood. Here we outline a role for a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in modulating the cell type-specific actions of liver X receptors (LXRs), sterol-activated nuclear receptors that regulate the expression of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis and that have been causally linked to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We identify the lncRNA MeXis as an amplifier of LXR-dependent transcription of the gene Abca1, which is critical for regulation of cholesterol efflux. Mice lacking the MeXis gene show reduced Abca1 expression in a tissue-selective manner. Furthermore, loss of MeXis in mouse bone marrow cells alters chromosome architecture at the Abca1 locus, impairs cellular responses to cholesterol overload, and accelerates the development of atherosclerosis. Mechanistic studies reveal that MeXis interacts with and guides promoter binding of the transcriptional coactivator DDX17. The identification of MeXis as a lncRNA modulator of LXR-dependent gene expression expands understanding of the mechanisms underlying cell type-selective actions of nuclear receptors in physiology and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2785971314,"The generation of new blood vessels via angiogenesis is critical for meeting tissue oxygen demands. A role for adult stem cells in this process remains unclear. Here, we identified CD157 (bst1, bone marrow stromal antigen 1) as a marker of tissue-resident vascular endothelial stem cells (VESCs) in large arteries and veins of numerous mouse organs. Single CD157+ VESCs form colonies in vitro and generate donor-derived portal vein, sinusoids, and central vein endothelial cells upon transplantation in the liver. In response to injury, VESCs expand and regenerate entire vasculature structures, supporting the existence of an endothelial hierarchy within blood vessels. Genetic lineage tracing revealed that VESCs maintain large vessels and sinusoids in the normal liver for more than a year, and transplantation of VESCs rescued bleeding phenotypes in a mouse model of hemophilia. Our findings show that tissue-resident VESCs display self-renewal capacity and that vascular regeneration potential exists in peripheral blood vessels."
https://openalex.org/W2790120223,"Cell walls in crops and trees have been engineered for production of biofuels and commodity chemicals, but engineered varieties often fail multi-year field trials and are not commercialized. We engineered reduced expression of a pectin biosynthesis gene (Galacturonosyltransferase 4, GAUT4) in switchgrass and poplar, and find that this improves biomass yields and sugar release from biomass processing. Both traits were maintained in a 3-year field trial of GAUT4-knockdown switchgrass, with up to sevenfold increased saccharification and ethanol production and sixfold increased biomass yield compared with control plants. We show that GAUT4 is an α-1,4-galacturonosyltransferase that synthesizes homogalacturonan (HG). Downregulation of GAUT4 reduces HG and rhamnogalacturonan II (RGII), reduces wall calcium and boron, and increases extractability of cell wall sugars. Decreased recalcitrance in biomass processing and increased growth are likely due to reduced HG and RGII cross-linking in the cell wall."
https://openalex.org/W2786017571,"Fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) are a prominent class of forebrain GABAergic cells implicated in two seemingly independent network functions: gain control and network plasticity. Little is known, however, about how these roles interact. Here, we use a combination of cell-type-specific ablation, optogenetics, electrophysiology, imaging, and behavior to describe a unified mechanism by which striatal FSIs control burst firing, calcium influx, and synaptic plasticity in neighboring medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs). In vivo silencing of FSIs increased bursting, calcium transients, and AMPA/NMDA ratios in MSNs. In a motor sequence task, FSI silencing increased the frequency of calcium transients but reduced the specificity with which transients aligned to individual task events. Consistent with this, ablation of FSIs disrupted the acquisition of striatum-dependent egocentric learning strategies. Together, our data support a model in which feedforward inhibition from FSIs temporally restricts MSN bursting and calcium-dependent synaptic plasticity to facilitate striatum-dependent sequence learning."
https://openalex.org/W2786888986,"Human autoantibodies to contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) are often associated with neuropathic pain, and CASPR2 mutations have been linked to autism spectrum disorders, in which sensory dysfunction is increasingly recognized. Human CASPR2 autoantibodies, when injected into mice, were peripherally restricted and resulted in mechanical pain-related hypersensitivity in the absence of neural injury. We therefore investigated the mechanism by which CASPR2 modulates nociceptive function. Mice lacking CASPR2 (Cntnap2−/−) demonstrated enhanced pain-related hypersensitivity to noxious mechanical stimuli, heat, and algogens. Both primary afferent excitability and subsequent nociceptive transmission within the dorsal horn were increased in Cntnap2−/− mice. Either immune or genetic-mediated ablation of CASPR2 enhanced the excitability of DRG neurons in a cell-autonomous fashion through regulation of Kv1 channel expression at the soma membrane. This is the first example of passive transfer of an autoimmune peripheral neuropathic pain disorder and demonstrates that CASPR2 has a key role in regulating cell-intrinsic dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2791471171,"A negative regulator of the Wnt pathway secreted by tumor cells promotes immune evasion by suppressing lymphocyte cytotoxicity. Immunotherapy offers new options for cancer treatment, but efficacy varies across cancer types. Colorectal cancers (CRCs) are largely refractory to immune-checkpoint blockade, which suggests the presence of yet uncharacterized immune-suppressive mechanisms. Here we report that the loss of adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC) in intestinal tumor cells or of the tumor suppressor PTEN in melanoma cells upregulates the expression of Dickkopf-related protein 2 (DKK2), which, together with its receptor LRP5, provides an unconventional mechanism for tumor immune evasion. DKK2 secreted by tumor cells acts on cytotoxic lymphocytes, inhibiting STAT5 signaling by impeding STAT5 nuclear localization via LRP5, but independently of LRP6 and the Wnt–β-catenin pathway. Genetic or antibody-mediated ablation of DKK2 activates natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T cells in tumors, impedes tumor progression, and enhances the effects of PD-1 blockade. Thus, we have identified a previously unknown tumor immune-suppressive mechanism and immunotherapeutic targets particularly relevant for CRCs and a subset of melanomas."
https://openalex.org/W2785432401,"Human intelligence comprises comprehension of and reasoning about an infinitely variable external environment. A brain capable of large variability in neural configurations, or states, will more easily understand and predict variable external events. Entropy measures the variety of configurations possible within a system, and recently the concept of brain entropy has been defined as the number of neural states a given brain can access. This study investigates the relationship between human intelligence and brain entropy, to determine whether neural variability as reflected in neuroimaging signals carries information about intellectual ability. We hypothesize that intelligence will be positively associated with entropy in a sample of 892 healthy adults, using resting-state fMRI. Intelligence is measured with the Shipley Vocabulary and WASI Matrix Reasoning tests. Brain entropy was positively associated with intelligence. This relation was most strongly observed in the prefrontal cortex, inferior temporal lobes, and cerebellum. This relationship between high brain entropy and high intelligence indicates an essential role for entropy in brain functioning. It demonstrates that access to variable neural states predicts complex behavioral performance, and specifically shows that entropy derived from neuroimaging signals at rest carries information about intellectual capacity. Future work in this area may elucidate the links between brain entropy in both resting and active states and various forms of intelligence. This insight has the potential to provide predictive information about adaptive behavior and to delineate the subdivisions and nature of intelligence based on entropic patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2790576796,"High-risk human papillomavirus oncoproteins E6 and E7 are the major etiological factors of cervical cancer but are insufficient for malignant transformation of cervical cancer. Dysregulated alternative splicing, mainly ascribed to aberrant splicing factor levels and activities, contributes to most cancer hallmarks. However, do E6 and E7 regulate the expression of splicing factors? Does alternative splicing acts as an “accomplice” of E6E7 to promote cervical cancer progression? Here, we identified that the splicing factor SRSF10, which promotes tumorigenesis of cervix, was upregulated by E6E7 via E2F1 transcriptional activation. SRSF10 modulates the alternate terminator of interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein exon 13 to increase production of the membrane form of interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein. SRSF10-mediated mIL1RAP upregulates the expression of the “don’t eat me” signal CD47 to inhibit macrophage phagocytosis by promoting nuclear factor-κB activation, which is pivotal in inflammatory, immune, and tumorigenesis processes. Altogether, these data reveal a close relationship among HPV infection, alternative splicing and tumor immune evasion, and also suggests that the SRSF10-mIL1RAP-CD47 axis could be an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of cervical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2787025689,"Walking is the predominant locomotor behavior expressed by land-dwelling vertebrates, but it is unknown when the neural circuits that are essential for limb control first appeared. Certain fish species display walking-like behaviors, raising the possibility that the underlying circuitry originated in primitive marine vertebrates. We show that the neural substrates of bipedalism are present in the little skate Leucoraja erinacea, whose common ancestor with tetrapods existed ∼420 million years ago. Leucoraja exhibits core features of tetrapod locomotor gaits, including left-right alternation and reciprocal extension-flexion of the pelvic fins. Leucoraja also deploys a remarkably conserved Hox transcription factor-dependent program that is essential for selective innervation of fin/limb muscle. This network encodes peripheral connectivity modules that are distinct from those used in axial muscle-based swimming and has apparently been diminished in most modern fish. These findings indicate that the circuits that are essential for walking evolved through adaptation of a genetic regulatory network shared by all vertebrates with paired appendages.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIwMmExNmU4MTcwMGQ5YTk3YjQ1NjIzMzI4Y2QxZWY4ZiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc5MjUwNzk3fQ.mUskrAvfu7YUjZOXjLGhwNgIt9HYBgWQXIuP9zX-Rp-YIijAeqCrNKn7sfTBAgnEztIctMmjyZSdUwiClnN1jrzTfrZUAHL5MYLn1RluImifKhQ77tcOuAr8vojd63O-NIIH3LCWIiWv8b7vihl_CbMkrmXozdritOXPXmHHH3f2YrAn6jA5Qf2qwK6fp7Aj75j7RTLeyMsHb8zCt9ZGwCIBjd2zGGZzRft-fOVSmWc3wSNGOTKU_np8HZ54TNUwSjQ5qmmWqMy_8k9V-8MCsNyUKqN4nr2mNMwwTB6f1PEGiThwoLtCMwpnnlywNlqen4xNbpGr6pWO20KjSOoQXQ(mp4, (10.43 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2793412825,"Deficits in Schwann cell-mediated remyelination impair functional restoration after nerve damage, contributing to peripheral neuropathies. The mechanisms mediating block of remyelination remain elusive. Here, through small-molecule screening focusing on epigenetic modulators, we identified histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3; a histone-modifying enzyme) as a potent inhibitor of peripheral myelinogenesis. Inhibition of HDAC3 enhanced myelin growth and regeneration and improved functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury in mice. HDAC3 antagonizes the myelinogenic neuregulin-PI3K-AKT signaling axis. Moreover, genome-wide profiling analyses revealed that HDAC3 represses promyelinating programs through epigenetic silencing while coordinating with p300 histone acetyltransferase to activate myelination-inhibitory programs that include the HIPPO signaling effector TEAD4 to inhibit myelin growth. Schwann cell-specific deletion of either Hdac3 or Tead4 in mice resulted in an elevation of myelin thickness in sciatic nerves. Thus, our findings identify the HDAC3-TEAD4 network as a dual-function switch of cell-intrinsic inhibitory machinery that counters myelinogenic signals and maintains peripheral myelin homeostasis, highlighting the therapeutic potential of transient HDAC3 inhibition for improving peripheral myelin repair."

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: E869-E878Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We previously proposed that CaM acts as a Ca2+-dependent switch between a bidentate-bound Apo/CaM form, spanning the A and B helices, and a Ca2+/CaM form bound to the B helix (Xu et al., 2013Xu Q. Chang A. Tolia A. Minor Jr., D.L. Structure of a Ca(2+)/CaM:Kv7.4 (KCNQ4) B-helix complex provides insight into M current modulation.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425: 378-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recent structural studies of CaM complexes have found a range of bidentate CaM/AB domain complexes having varied divalent-bound configurations including CaM:Kv7.1 AB domain complexes having a Ca2+/N-lobe and Apo/C-lobe in 5 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM EGTA conditions (Sachyani et al., 2014Sachyani D. Dvir M. Strulovich R. Tria G. Tobelaim W. Peretz A. Pongs O. Svergun D. Attali B. Hirsch J.A.

Tobelaim W.S. Attali B. Hirsch J.A. Structural insights into the M-channel proximal C-terminus/calmodulin complex.Biochemistry. 2016; 55: 5353-5365Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and a CaM:Kv7.1 complex in which EF hands EF1, EF2, and EF4 are occupied by divalent ions (Sun and MacKinnon, 2017Sun J. MacKinnon R. Cryo-EM structure of a KCNQ1/CaM complex reveals insights into congenital long QT syndrome.Cell. 2017; 169: 1042-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These structural observations seemingly run counter to the proposed Apo/CaM-Ca2+/CaM switch (Xu et al., 2013Xu Q. Chang A. Tolia A. Minor Jr., D.L. Structure of a Ca(2+)/CaM:Kv7.4 (KCNQ4) B-helix complex provides insight into M current modulation.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425: 378-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the observation of a CaM-clamp conformation in isoforms having different CaM responses, Kv7.1 and Kv7.2/7.3, fails to account how a common structure could underlie the differences in the effects of CaM modulation on Kv7.1 versus the neuronal isoforms Kv7.2–Kv7.5 (Delmas and Brown, 2005Delmas P. Brown D.A. Pathways modulating neural KCNQ/M (Kv7) potassium channels.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 850-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, Jespersen et al., 2005Jespersen T. Grunnet M. Olesen S.P. The KCNQ1 potassium channel: From gene to physiological function.Physiology (Bethesda). 2005; 20: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Further, a structure of an authentic Apo/CaM-bound form has remained elusive. Hence, whether different types of CaM-Kv7 interactions govern the modulation of different Kv7 isoforms or whether there are different transduction mechanisms arising from a common CaM-channel interaction scaffold has been unresolved. Here, using structural studies of CaM:Kv7 AB domain complexes from Kv7.4 and Kv7.5, we provide multiple lines of evidence that support a unified mechanism for Kv7 modulation by CaM. The core of this regulatory mechanism uses a switch between a cross-bridged Apo/CaM state and release of this cross-bridge caused by Ca2+ binding to the CaM C-lobe. Two observations are central to this mechanism. The Apo/C-lobe is in a “semi-open” conformation that can be opened by Ca2+ binding, whereas the CaM N-lobe remains anchored in the same position on the B helix in both the Apo- and Ca2+-bound forms, adopting an “open” binding pose on the B helix in the Apo state that is essentially identical to the Ca2+-bound form, except for the lack of Ca2+ ions. Because the Apo/N-lobe is pre-organized into a conformation identical to Ca2+/N-lobe, Ca2+ binding is able to increase the N-lobe:B helix affinity and thereby allow the N-lobe to stay anchored on the B helix when C-lobe:A helix interactions are disrupted. Notably, we find that the C-lobe EF3, a site that has been observed to lack divalent ions even when the other three EF hands are occupied (Sun and MacKinnon, 2017Sun J. MacKinnon R. Cryo-EM structure of a KCNQ1/CaM complex reveals insights into congenital long QT syndrome.Cell. 2017; 169: 1042-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), has a particularly important role in driving the C-lobe switch. Further, the C-lobe switch controls the function of both Kv7.4 and Kv7.1 despite affecting channel opening in opposite ways. Hence, the C-lobe switch uses a common mechanism arising from a shared scaffold regardless of how changes in this modulatory unit are coupled to channel opening. We co-expressed, purified, and crystallized an Apo/CaM:Kv7.4 AB domain complex. Similar to prior Kv7 AB domain studies (Sachyani et al., 2014Sachyani D. Dvir M. Strulovich R. Tria G. Tobelaim W. Peretz A. Pongs O. Svergun D. Attali B. Hirsch J.A.

In agreement with prior deletion studies of Kv7.1 (Haitin et al., 2009Haitin Y. Wiener R. Shaham D. Peretz A. Cohen E.B. Shamgar L. Pongs O. Hirsch J.A. Attali B. Intracellular domains interactions and gated motions of I(KS) potassium channel subunits.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1994-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the AB linker truncation did not affect channel function and improved channel expression (Figures S1C and S1D). Following purification in 1 mM EGTA, crystals were grown that diffracted X-rays to 2.30 Å resolution (Table S1), and the structure was determined by single anomalous diffraction-molecular replacement (SAD-MR) using an isomorphous heavy atom derivative with Di-μ-iodobis(ethylenediamine)diplatinum(II) nitrate ([Pt2I2(H2NCH2CH2NH2)2](NO3)2). Structure determination revealed four 1:1 Apo/CaM:Kv7.4 AB domain complexes per asymmetric unit (Figure S1E). In each, one CaM embraces an antiparallel helical pair of Kv7.4 A and B helices from a single AB domain (Figure 1A). All asymmetric unit complexes adopt similar conformations having a root mean square deviation, Cα (RMSDCα) of <0.300 Å (Figure S2A). This conformation differs dramatically from the Ca2+/CaM:Kv7.4 B helix complex (Figure 1B) (Xu et al., 2013Xu Q. Chang A. Tolia A. Minor Jr., D.L.

The Kv7.4 AB domain comprises three helices. The A helix, residues His330-Met357, the B helix, residues Pro528-Arg554, and a short helix formed by the AB-linker Ala364-Met527 (Figures 1A and S1A). There is a small difference in the extent of helical structure of the N-terminal end of the A helix in the different copies of the asymmetric unit (Figures S1A and S1F). As with the CaM:Kv7.1 AB domain complex structures (Sachyani et al., 2014Sachyani D. Dvir M. Strulovich R. Tria G. Tobelaim W. Peretz A. Pongs O. Svergun D. Attali B. Hirsch J.A.

The conformational differences between the Apo/CaM N-lobe and Ca2+/CaM N-lobe reside in the EF1 X, Y, and Z ligands, Asp20, Asp22, and Asp24 as well as more distributed differences in EF2 (Figures 2B, S5A, and S5B). These differences result in an EF hand pair in which the calcium-coordinating ligands are not arranged to coordinate calcium agreeing with the observed Apo/N-lobe state.

Here we report that the activity-dependent transcription factor Npas4 selectively regulates the structure and strength of MF-CA3 synapses by restricting the number of their functional synaptic contacts without affecting the other synaptic inputs onto CA3 pyramidal neurons. Using an activity-dependent reporter, we identified CA3 pyramidal cells that were activated by contextual learning and found that MF inputs on these cells were selectively strengthened. Deletion of Npas4 prevented both contextual memory formation and this learning-induced synaptic modification. We further show that Npas4 regulates MF-CA3 synapses by controlling the expression of the polo-like kinase Plk2. Thus, Npas4 is a critical regulator of experience-dependent, structural, and functional plasticity at MF-CA3 synapses during contextual memory formation.

Thus, Npas4 is a critical regulator of experience-dependent, structural, and functional plasticity at MF-CA3 synapses during contextual memory formation. The hippocampus is critical for contextual memory formation, and specific synaptic connections within this region carry out the neuronal computations required for encoding, storing, and retrieving contextual memories (Kesner and Rolls, 2015Kesner R.P. Rolls E.T. A computational theory of hippocampal function, and tests of the theory: new developments.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2015; 48: 92-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Contextual information that flows from the entorhinal cortex (EC) into the hippocampus is processed through the trisynaptic loop formed by three interconnected but anatomically and functionally distinct sub-regions: the dentate gyrus (DG), cornu ammonis 3 (CA3), and CA1. At the center of the trisynaptic loop, pyramidal neurons in CA3 receive three major excitatory synaptic inputs: mossy fiber (MF) inputs from DG granule cells, perforant path inputs directly from the EC, and recurrent inputs from other CA3 pyramidal neurons. Computational models predict that the MF-CA3 connections are essential for encoding new contextual memory but are dispensable for contextual memory retrieval, which, instead, requires the perforant path (Treves and Rolls, 1992Treves A.

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate MF-CA3 synapses during memory formation and the exact nature of this regulation are currently unknown. MF-CA3 synapses have several unique structural and functional properties. They are located on proximal dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons, have large presynaptic MF terminals (MFTs) with multiple release sites (Amaral and Dent, 1981Amaral D.G. Dent J.A.

USA. 1996; 93: 13304-13309Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). MF-CA3 synapses can act as “detonator” synapses; that is, under certain circumstances, a single MF input can reliably cause action potential firing of CA3 pyramidal neurons (Henze et al., 2002Henze D.A.

In addition, MF-CA3 synapses exhibit dramatic structural plasticity at both presynaptic MFTs and postsynaptic TEs (Wiera and Mozrzymas, 2015Wiera G. Mozrzymas J.W.

Furthermore, these structural changes are correlated with functional changes, with larger morphology typically being associated with more numerous and stronger synaptic contacts between MFTs and TEs (Galimberti et al., 2006Galimberti I.

Long-term memory formation is believed to involve modifications in relevant neural circuits that likely occur as a result of enduring synaptic changes (Mayford et al., 2012Mayford M. Siegelbaum S.A.

Although it is well established that the contextual information entering CA3 through the MF pathway is critical for the encoding of contextual memory in CA3 (Lee and Kesner, 2004aLee I. Kesner R.P.

Rapid reversal of stress induced loss of synapses in CA3 of rat hippocampus following water maze training.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 2447-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), precisely how MF-CA3 synapses are modified to contribute to contextual memory formation remains an open question. While mechanistically diverse forms of synaptic plasticity have been identified at MF-CA3 synapses, most studies have focused on presynaptic plasticity, such as classical, NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-independent long-term potentiation (LTP) (Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005Nicoll R.A. Schmitz D. Synaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fibre synapses.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 863-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, MF-LTP appears to be dispensable for encoding contextual memory (Ruediger et al., 2011Ruediger S. Vittori C. Bednarek E. Genoud C. Strata P. Sacchetti B. Caroni P. Learning-related feedforward inhibitory connectivity growth required for memory precision.Nature. 2011; 473: 514-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and it remains unclear what types of experience-dependent MF-CA3 synapse plasticity are involved in contextual learning. Moreover, molecular pathways responsible for the activity-dependent modulation of MF-CA3 synapses and the precise role of such modulation in contextual learning are poorly understood. We have previously shown that the neuronal activity-dependent transcription factor Npas4 is required in CA3, but not in CA1, for hippocampus-dependent contextual memory formation (Ramamoorthi et al., 2011Ramamoorthi K. Fropf R. Belfort G.M. Fitzmaurice H.L. McKinney R.M. Neve R.L. Otto T. Lin Y. Npas4 regulates a transcriptional program in CA3 required for contextual memory formation.Science. 2011; 334: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), based on the following evidence. After contextual learning, Npas4 is specifically induced in CA3 but not in CA1. Either global knockout or selective deletion of Npas4 in CA3 results in impaired contextual memory, and restoration of Npas4 in CA3 is sufficient to rescue the learning deficit in global knockout mice. In contrast, similar manipulations of Npas4 in CA1 had no effect on contextual memory. Here we report that Npas4 selectively regulates the structure and strength of MF-CA3 synapses. We also found that contextual learning selectively strengthens MF inputs on learning-activated CA3 pyramidal neurons. Deletion of Npas4 prevents this learning-induced plasticity at MF-CA3 synapses, which likely contributes to the impaired contextual memory formation. We further show that Npas4 acts through its transcriptional target polo-like kinase 2 (Plk2) to modulate MF-CA3 synapses. Expression of Plk2 in CA3 is sufficient to restore the MF-CA3 synapses and contextual memory formation in Npas4 global knockout mice. Thus, Npas4 emerges as a critical regulator of experience-dependent plasticity at MF-CA3 synapses during contextual memory formation. To better understand the role of Npas4 in contextual memory, we first examined miniature excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs and mIPSCs, respectively) by performing whole-cell patch recordings in CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons of acute hippocampal slices from Npas4 knockout (KO) mice and their wild-type littermates. We used 8- to 10-week-old mice, the same age at which we found that Npas4 is required in CA3 for contextual memory formation (Ramamoorthi et al., 2011Ramamoorthi K. Fropf R. Belfort G.M. Fitzmaurice H.L. McKinney R.M. Neve R.L. Otto T. Lin Y. Npas4 regulates a transcriptional program in CA3 required for contextual memory formation.Science. 2011; 334: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We observed a robust increase in mEPSC frequency and amplitude in CA3 pyramidal neurons of Npas4 KO mice compared with their wild-type littermates (Figure 1A). In contrast, mEPSCs were unchanged in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Figure 1B). In addition, mIPSCs remained unchanged in Npas4 KO mice in both CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons (Figures 1C and 1D). Thus, Npas4 deletion is associated with a selective increase in excitatory miniature transmission on CA3 pyramidal neurons. To rule out the possibility that the increase in excitatory drive on CA3 was a result of developmental compensation for global germline loss of Npas4, we acutely removed Npas4 by stereotaxic injection of adeno-associated virus AAV-hSyn-Cre-GFP (AAV-Cre) into the CA3 or CA1 region of Npas4 conditional KO (cKO; Npas4flx/flx) mice, with AAV-hSyn-GFP (AAV-GFP) as a control. Miniature activity was measured from CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal slices prepared 3 days after viral injection, when we had confirmed that the Npas4 gene had been deleted (Figures 2A and 2B ). As in the germline KO, mEPSC frequency in CA3 pyramidal neurons was increased more than 50% by Npas4 deletion compared with the GFP control condition (Figure 2C). In contrast, mEPSC amplitude was not affected in cKO mice, suggesting that Npas4 does not directly regulate the mEPSC amplitude. mEPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Figure 2D) and mIPSCs in CA3 pyramidal neurons (Figure S1) were again unchanged by Npas4 deletion. Taken together, our findings indicate that Npas4 selectively modulates the excitatory synaptic drive onto CA3 pyramidal neurons. An abnormally elevated excitatory drive onto CA3 could be at least partly responsible for the impaired contextual memory we observed in Npas4-deficient animals (Ramamoorthi et al., 2011Ramamoorthi K. Fropf R. Belfort G.M. Fitzmaurice H.L. McKinney R.M. Neve R.L. Otto T. Lin Y. Npas4 regulates a transcriptional program in CA3 required for contextual memory formation.Science. 2011; 334: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). If so, then re-expression of Npas4 in CA3 of Npas4 KO mice, a manipulation that rescued the deficit in contextual memory formation (Ramamoorthi et al., 2011Ramamoorthi K. Fropf R. Belfort G.M. Fitzmaurice H.L. McKinney R.M. Neve R.L. Otto T. Lin Y. Npas4 regulates a transcriptional program in CA3 required for contextual memory formation.Science. 2011; 334: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), should also restore CA3 excitatory synaptic transmission to a normal level. Indeed, 3 days after a herpes simplex virus (HSV) encoding Npas4 was stereotaxically injected into CA3 of Npas4 KO mice, the mEPSC frequency in infected CA3 pyramidal neurons was reduced almost to the level seen in wild-type mice (Figures 2E–2G). Expression of GFP or a truncated, transcriptionally inactive form of Npas4 (ΔNpas4), neither of which rescued the learning and memory deficit (Ramamoorthi et al., 2011Ramamoorthi K. Fropf R. Belfort G.M. Fitzmaurice H.L. McKinney R.M. Neve R.L. Otto T. Lin Y. Npas4 regulates a transcriptional program in CA3 required for contextual memory formation.Science. 2011; 334: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), failed to restore mEPSC activity (Figure 2G). mEPSC amplitudes were similar in all experiments. These results suggest that the increase in excitatory inputs onto CA3 pyramidal neurons by Npas4 deletion interferes with contextual memory formation. We considered the possibility that Npas4 might selectively regulate a specific subset of the three types of synaptic inputs received by CA3 pyramidal neurons; i.e., MF, recurrent, or perforant path inputs. We have previously shown that deletion of Npas4 in CA3 does not affect short-term memory formation (Ramamoorthi et al., 2011Ramamoorthi K. Fropf R. Belfort G.M. Fitzmaurice H.L. McKinney R.M. Neve R.L. Otto T. Lin Y. Npas4 regulates a transcriptional program in CA3 required for contextual memory formation.Science. 2011; 334: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), a process likely depending on recurrent inputs from other CA3 neurons (Kesner, 2007Kesner R.P. Behavioral functions of the CA3 subregion of the hippocampus.Learn. Mem. 2007; 14: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Contextual memory encoding and retrieval depend on MF and perforant path inputs, respectively (Jerman et al., 2006Jerman T. Kesner R.P. Hunsaker M.R. Disconnection analysis of CA3 and DG in mediating encoding but not retrieval in a spatial maze learning task.Learn.

Differential contributions of dorsal hippocampal subregions to memory acquisition and retrieval in contextual fear-conditioning.Hippocampus. 2004; 14: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Because deletion of Npas4 in CA3 before contextual fear conditioning (CFC) training impairs formation of long-term contextual memory (Ramamoorthi et al., 2011Ramamoorthi K. Fropf R. Belfort G.M. Fitzmaurice H.L. McKinney R.M. Neve R.L. Otto T. Lin Y. Npas4 regulates a transcriptional program in CA3 required for contextual memory formation.Science. 2011; 334: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), it suggests that Npas4 could be involved in either encoding or retrieval of contextual memory or both. We next investigated whether Npas4 could be selectively involved in memory encoding or retrieval. Npas4 cKO mice were subjected to CFC training, and their contextual memory was examined the following day by re-exposing them to the same context (recall 1, Figure 3A). One day later, the animals were injected in CA3 with AAV-Cre to delete Npas4 or with AAV-GFP as a control. Three days after injection, their contextual memory was examined again (recall 2). We found that the levels of freezing behavior were similar at recall 1 and recall 2 for all mice, regardless of whether Npas4 was deleted (Figures 3A and 3B). This result, combined with our previous findings (Ramamoorthi et al., 2011Ramamoorthi K. Fropf R. Belfort G.M. Fitzmaurice H.L. McKinney R.M. Neve R.L. Otto T. Lin Y. Npas4 regulates a transcriptional program in CA3 required for contextual memory formation.Science. 2011; 334: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), indicates that Npas4 is required in CA3 for memory encoding but not retrieval, in agreement with the notion that Npas4 modulates MF-CA3 synapses and not the perforant path. Consistent with the idea that Npas4 selectively modulates MF-CA3 synapses, we found that a significantly large fraction of mEPSC events with short rise times (<2.5 ms) in the Npas4 KO CA3 neurons (Figure S2), as expected for events, originated close to the cell soma, like those generated by MF-CA3 synapses (Claiborne et al., 1993Claiborne B.J.

Major G. Sakmann B. Quantal components of unitary EPSCs at the mossy fibre synapse on CA3 pyramidal cells of rat hippocampus.J. Physiol. 1993; 472: 615-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Moreover, the elevated mEPSC activity observed in Npas4-deficient neurons (Figure 2C) was abolished in the presence of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 2/3 (mGluR2/3)-specific agonist DCG-IV (1 μM) (Figure 3C), a manipulation known to specifically suppress glutamate release from MFs but not recurrent or perforant path inputs (Kamiya and Ozawa, 1999Kamiya H.

Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 2/3 suppresses transmission at rat hippocampal mossy fibre synapses.J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Furthermore, using minimal stimulation of MF inputs (Figure S3; Hofmann et al., 2008Hofmann M.E. Nahir B. Frazier C.J. Excitatory afferents to CA3 pyramidal cells display differential sensitivity to CB1 dependent inhibition of synaptic transmission.Neuropharmacology. 2008; 55: 1140-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, Jonas et al., 1993Jonas P. Major G. Sakmann B. Quantal components of unitary EPSCs at the mossy fibre synapse on CA3 pyramidal cells of rat hippocampus.J. Physiol. 1993; 472: 615-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), we found that MF-CA3 synaptic efficacy was increased in Npas4 KO mice compared with their wild-type littermates and that this enhancement was associated with increased potency but no change in failure rate (Figures 3D and 3E). In addition, paired-pulse ratio (PPR) and burst-induced facilitation of evoked MF-CA3 synaptic responses, two forms of short-term synaptic plasticity that are inversely correlated with the probability of neurotransmitter release (Pr), were undistinguishable in Npas4 KO and wild-type littermates (Figure 3F). Classical presynaptic LTP at MF-CA3 synapses was also normal in Npas4 KO mice (Figure 3G). Taken together, our results therefore suggest that the selective increase in MF-CA3 transmission observed in Npas4-deficient neurons likely results from an increase in the number of functional synaptic contacts established by each MF. In contrast, Npas4 deletion does not affect MF-CA3 basal Pr or classical forms of presynaptic plasticity. The number of conventional glutamatergic synapses on pyramidal neurons is correlated with the density of dendritic spines (Alvarez and Sabatini, 2007Alvarez V.A. Sabatini B.L. Anatomical and physiological plasticity of dendritic spines.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 79-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2001Yuste R. Bonhoeffer T. Morphological changes in dendritic spines associated with long-term synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1071-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). To test whether changes in the number of MF-CA3 synaptic contacts is correlated with morphological changes, we designed a strategy to sparsely and brightly label MF terminals and TEs in different colors using DNA recombinase Flpo-dependent reporters expressing both cytosolic and membrane-bound farnesylated GFP (AAV-hSyn-fDIO-GFP-P2A-farnGFP) or tdTomato (AAV-hSyn-fDIO-tdTomato) (Figure 4A; see STAR Methods for details). We performed bilateral double injections on Npas4 cKO mice. One injection, targeting dorsal CA3, delivered AAV-hSyn-Cre-GFP (to delete Npas4) or AAV-hSyn-ΔCre-GFP (containing a truncated and inactive version of Cre as the control), low-titer AAV-EF1α-Flpo (for sparse labeling), and AAV-hSyn-fDIO-tdTomato. This resulted in nuclear GFP labeling of the majority of dorsal CA3 neurons by either Cre-GFP or ΔCre-GFP and a sparse population of CA3 neurons labeled red by tdTomato (Figures 4A and 4B). A second injection was targeted to the dorsal DG, delivering low-titer AAV-EF1α-Flpo and AAV-hSyn-fDIO-GFP-P2A-farnGFP to label MFTs in green (Figures 4A and 4B). To analyze the 3D structures of MFTs and TEs, we adopted the See Deep Brain 2 (SeeDB2) procedure to immuno-stain and clarify brain slices for confocal imaging (Ke et al., 2016Ke M.T. Nakai Y.

https://openalex.org/W2790664092,"Post-translational modification refers to the biological mechanism involved in the enzymatic modification of proteins after being translated in the ribosome. This mechanism comprises a wide range of structural modifications, which bring dramatic variations to the biological function of proteins. One of the recently discovered modifications is succinylation. Although succinylation can be detected through mass spectrometry, its current experimental detection turns out to be a timely process unable to meet the exponential growth of sequenced proteins. Therefore, the implementation of fast and accurate computational methods has emerged as a feasible solution. This paper proposes a novel classification approach, which effectively incorporates the secondary structure and evolutionary information of proteins through profile bigrams for succinylation prediction. The proposed predictor, abbreviated as SSEvol-Suc, made use of the above features for training an AdaBoost classifier and consequently predicting succinylated lysine residues. When SSEvol-Suc was compared with four benchmark predictors, it outperformed them in metrics such as sensitivity (0.909), accuracy (0.875) and Matthews correlation coefficient (0.75)."
https://openalex.org/W2786682545,"Despite the central role PSD-95 plays in anchoring postsynaptic AMPARs, how PSD-95 itself is tethered to postsynaptic sites is not well understood. Here we show that the F-actin binding protein α-actinin binds to the very N terminus of PSD-95. Knockdown (KD) of α-actinin phenocopies KD of PSD-95. Mutating lysine at position 10 or lysine at position 11 of PSD-95 to glutamate, or glutamate at position 53 or glutamate and aspartate at positions 213 and 217 of α-actinin, respectively, to lysine impairs, in parallel, PSD-95 binding to α-actinin and postsynaptic localization of PSD-95 and AMPARs. These experiments identify α-actinin as a critical PSD-95 anchor tethering the AMPAR-PSD-95 complex to postsynaptic sites."

Progerin accumulation leads to increased cellular stresses including unrepaired DNA damage, activation of the p53 signaling pathway and accelerated senescence. We previously established that the p53 isoforms ∆133p53 and p53β regulate senescence in normal human cells. However, their role in premature aging is unknown. Here we report that p53 isoforms are expressed in primary fibroblasts derived from HGPS patients, are associated with their accelerated senescence and that their manipulation can restore the replication capacity of HGPS fibroblasts. We found that in near-senescent HGPS fibroblasts, which exhibit low levels of ∆133p53 and high levels of p53β, restoration of Δ133p53 expression was sufficient to extend replicative lifespan and delay senescence, despite progerin levels and abnormal nuclear morphology remaining unchanged. Conversely, Δ133p53 depletion or p53β overexpression accelerated the onset of senescence in otherwise proliferative HGPS fibroblasts. Our data indicate that Δ133p53 exerts its role by modulating full-length p53 (FLp53) signaling to extend the replicative lifespan and promotes the repair of spontaneous progerin-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). We showed that Δ133p53 dominant-negative inhibition of FLp53 occurs directly at the p21/CDKN1A and miR-34a promoters, two p53 senescence-associated genes. In addition, Δ133p53 expression increased the expression of DNA repair RAD51, likely through upregulation of E2F1, a transcription factor that activates RAD51, to promote repair of DSBs. In summary, our data indicate that Δ133p53 modulates p53 signaling to repress progerin-induced early onset of senescence in HGPS cells. Therefore, restoration of ∆133p53 expression may be a novel therapeutic strategy to treat aging-associated phenotypes of HGPS in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2787541346,"The means by which the physicochemical properties of different cellular components together determine bacterial cell shape remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate a programmed cell-shape change during Bacillus subtilis sporulation, when a rod-shaped vegetative cell is transformed to an ovoid spore. Asymmetric cell division generates a bigger mother cell and a smaller, hemispherical forespore. The septum traps the forespore chromosome, which is translocated to the forespore by SpoIIIE. Simultaneously, forespore size increases as it is reshaped into an ovoid. Using genetics, timelapse microscopy, cryo-electron tomography, and mathematical modeling, we demonstrate that forespore growth relies on membrane synthesis and SpoIIIE-mediated chromosome translocation, but not on peptidoglycan or protein synthesis. Our data suggest that the hydrated nucleoid swells and inflates the forespore, displacing ribosomes to the cell periphery, stretching septal peptidoglycan, and reshaping the forespore. Our results illustrate how simple biophysical interactions between core cellular components contribute to cellular morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2789372996,"Human-computer interface systems whose input is based on eye movements can serve as a means of communication for patients with locked-in syndrome. Eye-writing is one such system; users can input characters by moving their eyes to follow the lines of the strokes corresponding to characters. Although this input method makes it easy for patients to get started because of their familiarity with handwriting, existing eye-writing systems suffer from slow input rates because they require a pause between input characters to simplify the automatic recognition process. In this paper, we propose a continuous eye-writing recognition system that achieves a rapid input rate because it accepts characters eye-written continuously, with no pauses. For recognition purposes, the proposed system first detects eye movements using electrooculography (EOG), and then a hidden Markov model (HMM) is applied to model the EOG signals and recognize the eye-written characters. Additionally, this paper investigates an EOG adaptation that uses a deep neural network (DNN)-based HMM. Experiments with six participants showed an average input speed of 27.9 character/min using Japanese Katakana as the input target characters. A Katakana character-recognition error rate of only 5.0% was achieved using 13.8 minutes of adaptation data."

Neurons communicate via synaptic microdomains, where an input current generates a voltage change in the post-synaptic neuron. This voltage change, induced by excitatory current, reflects the strength of the synaptic connection between two interacting neurons (Jack et al., 1975Jack J.J.B. Noble D. Tsien R.W.

However the relative contribution between these two factors is still unclear. For example, the post-synaptic structure is often a dendritic spine, the geometry of which is involved in modulating the timescale of diffusion (Svoboda et al., 1997Svoboda K. Denk W. Kleinfeld D.

In parallel, increasing the number of receptors on that terminal leads to a larger synaptic current (Huganir and Nicoll, 2013Huganir R.L. Nicoll R.A.

But diffusion alone is not sufficient to interpret the synaptic response because it is driven by electro-diffusion involving an electric field and diffusing ions. Electro-diffusion has been applied successfully for studying ionic fluxes and gating of voltage channels (McLaughlin and Poo, 1981McLaughlin S. Poo M.M.

Look at biological systems through an engineer’s eyes.Nature. 2007; 447 (376–376)Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Those studies were all based on the fact that at the nanometer scale, the cylindrical symmetry of a channel model reduces to a one-dimensional segment, allowing the study of the electric field and charge densities in the channel pore (Eisenberg, 1999Eisenberg R.S.

Moreover, recent studies have clearly shown that the current in the synaptic cleft reflects the coupling between moving ions and the local electrical field (Sylantyev et al., 2013Sylantyev S. Savtchenko L.P. Ermolyuk Y. Michaluk P. Rusakov D.A.

Electric fields of synaptic currents could influence diffusion of charged neurotransmitter molecules.Synapse. 2004; 51: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In a dendritic spine, voltage changes during the synaptic response are generated by the interactions between the ionic flow and the spine geometry. Dendritic spines are heterogenous microdomains at the limit of optical resolution and for that reason, voltage changes were estimated for many years using modeling and numerical simulations of passive cable equations, the basis for the Hodgkin-Huxley model (Koch and Segev, 1998Koch C. Segev I. Methods in Neuronal Modeling: From Ions to Networks. MIT Press, 1998Google Scholar). This approach is however not appropriate for spines because their micro-geometry composed of a bulby head connected to a thin neck is significantly different from that of a cable. In addition, cable theories break down when applied to small neuronal compartments, such as dendritic spines, because they assume spatial and ionic homogeneity. Linear approximations of electro-diffusion that couples the electric field with the ionic flow have been used to improve the estimation of the voltage changes in spines, approximated as cylinders of various sizes, but assuming local electroneutrality (Qian and Sejnowski, 1989Qian N.

The deconvolution procedure transforms the voltage dye Arclight response into voltage dynamics. To interpret the drop of voltage between the spine head and dendrite, we use the Poisson-Nernst-Planck theory for electro-diffusion. We further compute how a current flowing inside the spine head is converted into voltage and determine the electrical resistance. Numerical simulations of the voltage drop in the entire spine reveal how a change in the neck length and radius alters voltage. The manuscript is divided in two parts: first, we present the general method of time series deconvolution applied here to voltage dyes and we construct an electro-diffusion model to extract parameters from data. In the second part, we use our electro-diffusion model to generate three-dimensional simulations to investigate how the spine geometry modulates its electrical properties. We conclude here that while the numbers and the types of synaptic receptors determine the injected current, the geometry of a dendritic spine controls the conversion of current into voltage. Arclight dye indicators respond to voltage with an intrinsic delay (Kwon et al., 2017Kwon T. Sakamoto M. Peterka D.S. Yuste R. Attenuation of synaptic potentials in dendritic spines.Cell Rep. 2017; 20: 1100-1110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), such that a fast voltage response leads to a convolved fluorescence response. In that context, a synaptic input entering a dendritic spine generates a fluorescent response that needs to be deconvolved in order to recover the electrical genuine time course. As the voltage intensity has already been deconvolved in Kwon et al., 2017Kwon T. Sakamoto M. Peterka D.S. Yuste R. Attenuation of synaptic potentials in dendritic spines.Cell Rep. 2017; 20: 1100-1110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, we focus here on the temporal response. The basis of the method is to find the causal kernel K(t), which is computed empirically by comparing the electrophysiology and the fluorescence responses in the soma (see STAR Methods). Once the kernel is found, we will use it to recover the noisy voltage dynamics in much smaller structures such as dendritic spines and portions of dendrites. We apply the deconvolution procedure on the soma region (Figure 1A), which transforms the fluorescence dye signal (dashed green) into the voltage response (black) (Figure 1B; see STAR Methods and Figure S1). The deconvolved signal is shown by a line (green) that superimposes with the electrophysiological recordings (continuous black line). This result confirms the validity of the method. Indeed, by using the direct convolution of the electrophysiological recording by the kernel, we obtain the response (black curve) that exactly super-imposes with the fluorescence soma signal (Figure S1A). We note that the second bump in the fluorescence signal (dashed green) in Figure 1B is removed by the fitting procedure before the deconvolution kernel K(t), as expected because the electrophysiological recordings do not exhibit this second bump. We extended the deconvolution procedure for several spikes in Figure S2. Based on the deconvolution kernel K(t), we shall now deconvolve the fluorescent responses in the regions of interest (ROIs) R1 and R2 shown in Figure 1C and Figure S3. Indeed, after we found the deconvolution kernel K(t) from the soma data, we applied it to deconvolve the signal in spines because the distribution of dyes is the same in the entire neuron (Kwon et al., 2017Kwon T. Sakamoto M. Peterka D.S. Yuste R. Attenuation of synaptic potentials in dendritic spines.Cell Rep. 2017; 20: 1100-1110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The results are shown in Figures 1D and 1E for the voltage in the spine head and dendrite. We note that the original fluorescence (thin line) contains fluctuations (Figures 1D and 1E) and an additional step is needed to remove the fluctuations (see STAR Methods and Figures S1C–S1E). We found that the voltage timescale in the dendritic spines, recovered from the present deconvolution procedure, is slower than the expected direct synaptic response. Probably, this slow timescale compared to direct synaptic electrical stimulation is due to glutamate uncaging, that can last for hundreds of milliseconds. To conclude, we can now recover the voltage in region R1, which represents the head, and in R2, which refers to the adjacent portion of the dendritic shaft at the base of the spine (Figure 1F). This deconvolution step is crucial because it allows us a direct comparison with the electro-diffusion model that we shall describe in the next section. To interpret the voltage dynamics in a dendritic spine, we use the electro-diffusion model that couples positive cp(x,t) and negative cm(x,t) charge concentrations with the electrical potential V(x,t). The model is based on the phenomenological Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations, where the ionic flow is driven by diffusion and the electric field. The voltage is described by the classical Poisson equation (Jackson, 2007Jackson J.D. Classical Electrodynamics. John Wiley & Sons, 2007Google Scholar, Sect.1.7) (see STAR Methods). We use the PNP equations to model the flow of ions when a current Istim(t), composed exclusively of positive charges, is injected at the top of a dendritic spine. We recall that the electrical potential generated by a flow of ions is defined up to an additive constant. We start with the description of the voltage response produced by an input current I(t) inside the spine neck. The current I(t) that arrives at the neck entrance results from the stimulation current Istim(t) received by the head. We applied the electro-diffusion approach at the nano-micrometer scale, by reducing the neck geometry to a one-dimensional wire of length L (Figures 2A–2C). Due to its large size, compared to a dendritic spine, the dendrite constitutes an ionic reservoir (fixed concentrations). Furthermore, using for the internal resistivity the value 109Ω.cm (Koch, 2004Koch C. Biophysics of Computation: Information Processing in Single Neurons. Oxford University Press, 2004Google Scholar, Chapter 11), we find that the fluctuations of the voltage in the portion of the dendrite R2 (Figure 1C) are negligible, and in that case, the region R2 is expected to be isopotential. Consequently, we fix in the dendrite the value for the voltage V(0,t)=0mV. We thus interpret the potential V(t)=V(L,t) computed at the end of the neck (Figures 2A–2E) as the difference of potential between the entrance and the end of the spine neck. Consequently, we describe the electro-diffusion inside the neck by the ensemble of Equations 37, 39, and 40, where I(t) has yet to be estimated. From the classical theory of electricity (Jackson, 2007Jackson J.D. Classical Electrodynamics. John Wiley & Sons, 2007Google Scholar), it is not possible to extract the current passing through a passive device from the difference of potential when the resistance is unknown. However, using an electrical model for the axial current, escaping from the spine head to the neck, we shall reconstruct the voltage in the neck and recover the current in the entire spine. Because there is no direct measurement of the current I(t), we develop here a procedure (STAR Methods) to estimate this current from the measured membrane potential ϕ(t) in the spine head. We decompose the current as the sum of a resistive and a capacitive term:I(t)=Gϕ(t)+Cdϕ(t)dt.(Equation 1) The conductance G and the capacitance C reflect how the current Istim(t), injected in the spine, is processed by the head, depending on the intrinsic properties of the spine head (in the next section, we will simulate the entire voltage using PNP starting from the current entering through the channels). Consequently, we will refer to G and C as intrinsic conductance and intrinsic capacitance, respectively. We now estimate the two constants C and G and the voltage drop across a spine neck by solving numerically Equations 37, 39, and 40 and compare the results to the simulations with the deconvolved Arclight fluorescent voltage response. The response is generated following glutamate uncaging stimulations at the top of the spine head (Figure 1C, red dot). We solve numerically the PNP equations for the distribution of positive cp(x,t) and negative cm(x,t) charges, as well as the potential difference V(x,t) (Figures 2D and 2E). To estimate the voltage difference ΔV˜(t) across the neck, we grounded the potential to 0 mV at the dendritic shaft (before stimulations, the voltage is described by Equation 38). To assess whether the potential difference ΔV˜(t)=Vhead(t)−Vdend(t) can be predicted from the electro-diffusion model, we fix the input voltage ϕ(t)=Vhead(t). We then compare the voltage obtained by solving Equations 37, 39, and 40 (Figures 2D and 2E) to the measured voltage Vdend(t) in region R2 (blue) at the dendritic shaft (Figure 2C). Although region R1 includes the head and the neck, we neglected the fluorescence in the neck due to its small thinness ≤100nm. We found a good agreement between the experimental data and numerical simulations (Figure 2D) showing that the difference of voltages between the head and dendrite can be predicted from the input voltage Vhead(t). In addition, we estimated the injected current (Figure 2E, see STAR Methods and Equation 1) directly without any direct electrophysiological recordings. Note that the deconvolved voltage in the head (blue) and the computed current (red) are exactly proportional, because the capacitance C, reported in Table 1 and used to compute I(t) in Equation 1, is negligible. Thus, the current is simply proportional to the voltage. We conclude at this stage that the electro-diffusion theory allows estimating the electrical properties of the spine red neck and the injected current (of the order of tens of pA) in the spine neck, triggered by a synaptic current Istim(t).Table 1Extracted Parameters from ModelingSpineNeck Length L (μm)Head Radius rhead (μm)Intrinsic Capa.

We apply systematically the electro-diffusion approach, based on (1), to extract the capacitance C and the conductance G of several spines (Figures S3 and S4). Using an optimization procedure, we explore the parameter space for computing C and G (Figure S4). We minimize the error between the solution of the electro-diffusion equation and the voltage output of the dendrite during a small time interval at the beginning of the response (Figure S4). The resistance is computed by averaging the voltage changes in time. We use for the estimator the expression Rneck=〈V(0,t)−V(L,t)〉/〈I(t)〉 (where the average is performed over the time interval t∈[0,0.4]s). In all cases, we find a good agreement (Figure 4) between the measured and computed voltage drop across the spine neck, where we estimated the current injected in the neck from the head of several spines. In summary, we found that the average spine neck resistance (for a mean neck radius ro=100nm) is 〈R〉≈100±35MΩ (Table 1). We also reported here a large variability in the spine resistance, while the intrinsic capacitance is negligible. To conclude, the electro-diffusion model allows computing the current injected in the spine neck after a synaptic stimulation, thus recovering the neck resistance. We have shown in the previous section that electro-diffusion PNP-based model can be used to analyze Arclight fluorescence recording and this model allows estimating the current flowing in the spine neck. We shall now extend the PNP model to geometries that characterize the peculiar shape of the dendritic spines. To analyze how a dendritic spine influences the voltage response to a synaptic input, we simulate the three-dimensional PNP equations (see STAR Methods) for two geometries: a ball of radius rhead and a spine-like geometry (Figure 3). We computed the distribution of the electrical potential for short spine necks (Figure 3A), where the head contains two narrow openings: one of radius ro=100nm representing the junction with the neck, and the other of radius ri=10nm that receives the steady current Istim of positive charges (Figure 3B). Note that we have dropped the time t in the expression of the current Istim, since we consider now steady-state current. In addition we neglected the membrane capacitance because the current Istim represents already the ionic flow entering the head. We show (Figure S5) that the capacitance has almost no contribution to the voltage drop. We computed the distribution of positive cp(x) and negative cm(x) charge concentrations as well as the voltage V(x) when it is grounded to 0 V at the end of the spine neck, which represents the connection to the dendrite, considered as a large ionic reservoir with fixed concentration (see Table 2). Consequently, V(x) represents the voltage difference induced by the injected current Istim. We find the distribution of the voltage along the x axis (blue) Figure 3B when Istim=150pA is injected in the spherical geometry as shown in Figures 3A and 3B.Table 2Biophysical and Geometrical ParametersParameterDescriptionValuezValence of ions1DDiffusion coeffcient200μm2/s (Chen and Nicholson, 2000Chen K.C.

https://openalex.org/W2785649063,"Odor detection involves hundreds of olfactory receptors from diverse families, making modeling of hedonic valence of an odorant difficult, even in Drosophila melanogaster where most receptors have been deorphanised. We demonstrate that a broadly tuned heteromeric receptor that detects CO2 (Gr21a, Gr63a) and other odorants is a key determinant of valence along with a few members of the Odorant receptor family in a T-maze, but not in a trap assay. Gr21a and Gr63a have atypically high amino acid conservation in Dipteran insects, and they use both inhibition and activation to convey positive or negative valence for numerous odorants. Inhibitors elicit a robust Gr63a-dependent attraction, while activators, strong aversion. The attractiveness of inhibitory odorants increases with increasing background CO2 levels, providing a mechanism for behavior modulation in odor blends. In mosquitoes, valence is switched and activation of the orthologous receptor conveys attraction. Reverse chemical ecology enables the identification of inhibitory odorants to reduce attraction of mosquitoes to skin."
https://openalex.org/W2785711787,"A conserved organizational and functional principle of neural networks is the segregation of axon-dendritic synaptic connections into laminae. Here we report that targeting of synaptic laminae by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) arbors in the vertebrate visual system is regulated by a signaling system relying on target-derived Reelin and VLDLR/Dab1a on the projecting neurons. Furthermore, we find that Reelin is distributed as a gradient on the target tissue and stabilized by heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Through genetic manipulations, we show that this Reelin gradient is important for laminar targeting and that it is attractive for RGC axons. Finally, we suggest a comprehensive model of synaptic lamina formation in which attractive Reelin counter-balances repulsive Slit1, thereby guiding RGC axons toward single synaptic laminae. We establish a mechanism that may represent a general principle for neural network assembly in vertebrate species and across different brain areas."
https://openalex.org/W2788929751,"Background Streptococcus pneumoniae causes morbidity and mortality among all ages in The Netherlands. To reduce this burden, infants in The Netherlands receive the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV10), but older persons are not targeted. We assessed the impact and cost-effectiveness of vaccination with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) or 13-valent PCV (PCV13) among all those aged 60, 65 or 70 and/or in combination with replacing PCV10 with PCV13 in the infant vaccination programme. Methods A static cost-effectiveness model was parameterized including projected trends for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and hospitalised community acquired pneumonia (CAP). The different strategies were evaluated using vaccine list prices and a 10-year time horizon. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated with the current strategy (infant vaccination program with PCV10) as reference. Results Compared to the reference, the largest impact on pneumococcal disease burden was projected with a combined use of PCV13 among infants and PPV23 at 60, 65 and 70 years, preventing 1,635 cases of IPD and 914 cases of CAP. The most cost-effective strategy was vaccinating with PPV23 at 70 years only with similar low ICERs at age 60 and 65. The impact of the use of PCV13 among infants depends strongly on the projected herd-immunity effect on serotype 19A. Vaccinating elderly with either PCV13 or PPV23 was dominated by PPV23 in all investigated scenarios, mainly due to the lower price of PPV23. Conclusion Under the current assumptions, the best value for money is the use of PPV23 for elderly, with a single dose or at five year increment between age 60 to age 70."
https://openalex.org/W2793462451,"Hedgehog (Hh) is an oncogenic signaling pathway that regulates the activity of Gli transcription factors. Canonical Hh is a Smoothened- (Smo-) driven process that alters the post-translational processing of Gli2/Gli3 proteins. Though evidence supports a role for Gli action in prostate cancer (PCa) cell growth and progression, there is little indication that Smo is involved. Here we describe a non-canonical means for activation of Gli transcription in PCa cells mediated by the binding of transcriptionally-active androgen receptors (ARs) to Gli3. Androgens stimulated reporter expression from a Gli-dependent promoter in a variety of AR + PCa cells and this activity was suppressed by an anti-androgen, Enz, or by AR knockdown. Androgens also upregulated expression of endogenous Gli-dependent genes. This activity was associated with increased intranuclear binding of Gli3 to AR that was antagonized by Enz. Fine mapping of the AR binding domain on Gli2 showed that AR recognizes the Gli protein processing domain (PPD) in the C-terminus. Mutations in the arginine-/serine repeat elements of the Gli2 PPD involved in phosphorylation and ubiquitinylation blocked the binding to AR. β-TrCP, a ubiquitin ligase that recognizes the Gli PPD, competed with AR for binding to this site. AR binding to Gli3 suppressed its proteolytic processing to the Gli3 repressor form (Gli3R) whereas AR knockdown increased Gli3R. Both full-length and truncated ARs were able to activate Gli transcription. Finally, we found that an ARbinding decoy polypeptide derived from the Gli2 C-terminus can compete with Gli3 for binding to AR. Exogenous overexpression of this decoy suppressed Gli transcriptional activity in PCa cells. Collectively, this work identifies a novel pathway for non-canonical activation of Hh signaling in PCa cells and identifies a means for interference that may have clinical relevance for PCa patients."
https://openalex.org/W2790979194,"Ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15) is a widely expressed deubiquitylase that has been implicated in diverse cellular processes in cancer. Here we identify topoisomerase II (TOP2A) as a novel protein that is regulated by USP15. TOP2A accumulates during G2 and functions to decatenate intertwined sister chromatids at prophase, ensuring the replicated genome can be accurately divided into daughter cells at anaphase. We show that USP15 is required for TOP2A accumulation, and that USP15 depletion leads to the formation of anaphase chromosome bridges. These bridges fail to decatenate, and at mitotic exit form micronuclei that are indicative of genome instability. We also describe the cell cycle-dependent behaviour for two major isoforms of USP15, which differ by a short serine-rich insertion that is retained in isoform-1 but not in isoform-2. Although USP15 is predominantly cytoplasmic in interphase, we show that both isoforms move into the nucleus at prophase, but that isoform-1 is phosphorylated on its unique S229 residue at mitotic entry. The micronuclei phenotype we observe on USP15 depletion can be rescued by either USP15 isoform and requires USP15 catalytic activity. Importantly, however, an S229D phospho-mimetic mutant of USP15 isoform-1 cannot rescue either the micronuclei phenotype, or accumulation of TOP2A. Thus, S229 phosphorylation selectively abrogates this role of USP15 in maintaining genome integrity in an isoform-specific manner. Finally, we show that USP15 isoform-1 is preferentially upregulated in a panel of non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, and propose that isoform imbalance may contribute to genome instability in cancer. Our data provide the first example of isoform-specific deubiquitylase phospho-regulation and reveal a novel role for USP15 in guarding genome integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2787170215,"The transmembrane protein, ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10), has key physiologic functions-for example, during embryonic development and in the brain. During transit through the secretory pathway, immature ADAM10 (proADAM10) is converted into its proteolytically active, mature form (mADAM10). Increasing or decreasing the abundance and/or activity of mADAM10 is considered to be a therapeutic approach for the treatment of such diseases as Alzheimer's disease and cancer. Yet biochemical detection and characterization of mADAM10 has been difficult. In contrast, proADAM10 is readily detected-for example, in immunoblots-which suggests that mADAM10 is only a fraction of total cellular ADAM10. Here, we demonstrate that mADAM10, but not proADAM10, unexpectedly undergoes rapid, time-dependent degradation upon biochemical cell lysis in different cell lines and in primary neurons, which prevents the detection of the majority of mADAM10 in immunoblots. This degradation required the catalytic activity of ADAM10, was efficiently prevented by adding active site inhibitors to the lysis buffer, and did not affect proADAM10, which suggests that ADAM10 degradation occurred in an intramolecular and autoproteolytic manner. Inhibition of postlysis autoproteolysis demonstrated efficient cellular ADAM10 maturation with higher levels of mADAM10 than proADAM10. Moreover, a cycloheximide chase experiment revealed that mADAM10 is a long-lived protein with a half-life of approximately 12 h. In summary, our study demonstrates that mADAM10 autoproteolysis must be blocked to allow for the proper detection of mADAM10, which is essential for the correct interpretation of biochemical and cellular studies of ADAM10.-Brummer, T., Pigoni, M., Rossello, A., Wang, H., Noy, P.

https://openalex.org/W2788291017,"Glucocorticoid (GC) hormones are significant regulators of homeostasis. The physiological effects of GCs critically depend on the time of exposure (short vs. long) as well as on their circulating levels (baseline vs. stress-induced). Previous experiments, in which chronic and high elevation of GC levels was induced, indicate that GCs impair both the activity of the immune system and the oxidative balance. Nonetheless, our knowledge on how mildly elevated GC levels, a situation much more common in nature, might influence homeostasis is limited. Therefore, we studied whether an increase in GC level within the baseline range suppresses or enhances condition (body mass, hematocrit and coccidian infestation) and physiological state (humoral innate immune system activity and oxidative balance). We implanted captive house sparrows Passer domesticus with either 60 days release corticosterone (CORT) or control pellets. CORT-treated birds had elevated baseline CORT levels one week after the implantation, but following this CORT returned to its pre-treatment level and the experimental groups had similar CORT levels one and two months following the implantation. The mass of tail feathers grown during the initial phase of treatment was smaller in treated than in control birds. CORT implantation had a transient negative effect on body mass and hematocrit, but both of these traits resumed the pre-treatment values by one month post-treatment. CORT treatment lowered oxidative damage to lipids (malondialdehyde) and enhanced constitutive innate immunity at one week and one month post-implantation. Our findings suggest that a relatively short-term (i.e. few days) elevation of baseline CORT might have a positive and stimulatory effect on animal physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2790475366,"Transplantation of ovarian tissue for the preservation of fertility in oncological patients is becoming an accepted clinical practice. However, the risk of re-introducing tumour cells at transplantation has stirred an increased interest for complete in vitro folliculogenesis. This has not yet been achieved in humans possibly for the lack of knowledge on the environmental milieu that orchestrates folliculogenesis in vivo. The main aim of this study was to investigate the effect of oxygen availability on follicle health and growth during in vitro culture of ovarian tissue strips. To this end, a model was developed to predict the dissolved oxygen concentration in tissue under varying culture conditions. Ovarian cortical strips of bovine, adopted as an animal model, and human tissue were cultured in conventional (CD) and gas permeable (PD) dishes under different media column heights and gaseous oxygen tensions for 3, 6 and 9 days. Follicle quality, activation of primordial follicles to the primary stage, and progression to the secondary stage were analysed through histology. Follicle viability was assessed through a live-dead assay at the confocal scanning laser microscope. Findings showed a higher follicle quality and viability after culture of bovine ovarian strips in PD in adequate medium height and oxygen tensions. The best culture conditions found in the bovine were adopted for human ovarian strip culture and promoted a higher follicle quality, viability and progression. Overall, data demonstrated that modulation of oxygen availability in tissue plays a key role in maintaining follicles' health and their ability to survive and progress to the secondary stage during ovarian tissue in vitro culture. Such culture conditions could increase the yield of healthy secondary follicles for subsequent dissection and individual culture to obtain competent oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2793710329,"The Dutos e Terminais do Centro Sul (DTCS) is one of the largest petroleum terminals of the South America located in the São Sebastião Channel (SSC) on the southeastern Brazilian coast. The aims of this study were to compare the sediment quality near the DTCS with that of several sites in the SSC region including the Araçá (AR) domestic sewage outfall and to assess the efficiency of the DTCS wastewater treatment plant. To achieve these goals, textural, geochemical, and living benthic foraminifera results were analyzed for the DTCS, AR, and SSC regions. Sediments in the DTCS area were silty with high concentrations of total organic carbon (1.7–2.4%), total nitrogen (0.2–0.3%), total sulfur (0.4–0.6%), and total (0.12–0.18%) and inorganic phosphorous (0.07–0.11%). These values were higher than those in sediments collected in the SSC and Araçá regions. The sediments’ concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn in the SSC and AR regions were lower than their corresponding probable effect levels (PELs). However, sediments near the DTCS were enriched with As, Cu, and Ni, whose concentrations exceeded their corresponding threshold effect levels (TELs). Around the DTCS outfall diffusers, living foraminiferal densities and diversities were lower than those for the other areas studied. In the DTCS area, it was necessary to search 50 to 190 cm3 of sediment to find 100 live specimens. In the SSC and Araçá areas, a maximum of 40 cm3 of sediment was enough to locate 100 live specimens. The lower density and diversity of living foraminifera around the DTCS than around the other areas illustrates the impact of the environmental stress caused by the presence of pollutants. These results indicate that the wastewater treatment plant efficiency is low and its discharge of pollutants from petrochemical waste liquids affects the benthic fauna around the DTCS in a potentially harmful manner."
https://openalex.org/W2791240132,"We applied the peak-end paradigm that was first introduced in the pain literature to examine the experience of effort and discomfort during a cognitively demanding working memory task. A total of 401 participants were asked to rate their effort and discomfort during and after the administration of a working memory task, which systematically varied task difficulty within participants and task duration between participants. Over the course of the task, participants reported a decrease in reported effort and an increase in reported discomfort. Peak and end real-time ratings were significant predictors of retrospective ratings for effort and discomfort; average and initial ratings predicted a small amount of additional variance. The regression analyses with effort and discomfort were largely consistent, with some exceptions. End discomfort significantly predicted willingness to do the task again, but not end effort. These findings highlight the ways in which the experience of effort and discomfort are integrally related, yet importantly separate, during a cognitively demanding task."
https://openalex.org/W2793635274,"Accurately reconstructing gene co-expression network is of great importance for uncovering the genetic architecture underlying complex and various phenotypes. The recent availability of high-throughput RNA-seq sequencing has made genome-wide detecting and quantifying of the novel, rare and low-abundance transcripts practical. However, its potential merits in reconstructing gene co-expression network have still not been well explored. Using massive-scale RNA-seq samples, we have designed an ensemble pipeline, called NetMiner, for building genome-scale and high-quality Gene Co-expression Network (GCN) by integrating three frequently used inference algorithms. We constructed a RNA-seq-based GCN in one species of monocot rice. The quality of network obtained by our method was verified and evaluated by the curated gene functional association data sets, which obviously outperformed each single method. In addition, the powerful capability of network for associating genes with functions and agronomic traits was shown by enrichment analysis and case studies. In particular, we demonstrated the potential value of our proposed method to predict the biological roles of unknown protein-coding genes, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes and circular RNA (circRNA) genes. Our results provided a valuable and highly reliable data source to select key candidate genes for subsequent experimental validation. To facilitate identification of novel genes regulating important biological processes and phenotypes in other plants or animals, we have published the source code of NetMiner, making it freely available at https://github.com/czllab/NetMiner."

Sera from 117 preoperative/pretreatment breast cancer patients and 51 control subjects, including those with fibrocystic disease, were analyzed for the presence of PLAC1 protein as well as its expression by IHC in tumor biopsies in a subset of subjects. Serum PLAC1 levels exceeded the mean plus one standard deviation (mean+SD) of the level in control subjects in 67% of subjects with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), 67% with HER2+ tumors, 73% with triple-negative cancer and 73% with ER+/PR+ tumors. Greater sensitivity was achieved using the mean+2 SD of control PLAC1 serum values, where the false positive rate was 3% and was exceeded by 38%, 40%, 60% and 43% of subjects with DCIS, HER2+, TNBC and ER+/PR+/HER2- tumors. PLAC1 was detected in 97% of tumor biopsies, but did not correlate quantitatively with serum levels. There was no significant correlation of serum PLAC1 levels with race, age at diagnosis, body mass index (BMI) or the presence of metastatic disease.

https://openalex.org/W4242185087,"Rubisco (Ribulose-1, 5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) is the most important enzyme on earth, catalyzing the first step of photosynthetic CO2 fixation. So, without it, there would be no storing of the sun’s energy in plants. Molecular adaptation of Rubisco to C4 photosynthetic pathway has attracted a lot of attention. C4 plants, which comprise less than 5% of land plants, have evolved more efficient photosynthesis compared to C3 plants. Interestingly, a large number of independent transitions from C3 to C4 phenotype have occurred. Each time, the Rubisco enzyme has been subject to similar changes in selective pressure, thus providing an excellent model for convergent evolution at the molecular level. Molecular adaptation is often identified with positive selection and is typically characterized by an elevated ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rate (dN/dS). However, convergent adaptation is expected to leave a different molecular signature, taking the form of repeated transitions toward identical or similar amino acids. Here, we used a previously introduced codon-based differential-selection model to detect and quantify consistent patterns of convergent adaptation in Rubisco in eudicots. We further contrasted our results with those obtained by classical codon models based on the estimation of dN/dS. We found that the two classes of models tend to select distinct, although overlapping, sets of positions. This discrepancy in the results illustrates the conceptual difference between these models while emphasizing the need to better discriminate between qualitatively different selective regimes, by using a broader class of codon models than those currently considered in molecular evolutionary studies."
https://openalex.org/W2794137728,"Despite optimal control of hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia, the number of patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN) continues to grow. Strategies to target various signaling pathways to prevent DN have been intensively investigated in animal models and many have been proved to be promising. However, targeting these pathways once kidney disease is established, remain unsatisfactory. The clinical scenario is that patients with diabetes mellitus often present with established kidney damage and need effective treatments to repair and reverse the kidney damage. In this studies, eNOS-/- mice were administered with streptozotocin to induce diabetes. At 24 weeks, at which time we have previously demonstrated albuminuria and pathological changes of diabetic nephropathy, mice were randomised to receive TRAM34 subcutaneously, a highly selective inhibitor of potassium channel KCa3.1 or DMSO (vehicle) for a further 14 weeks. Albuminuria was assessed, inflammatory markers (CD68, F4/80) and extracellular matrix deposition (type I collagen and fibronectin) in the kidneys were examined. The results clearly demonstrate that TRAM34 reduced albuminuria, decreased inflammatory markers and reversed extracellular matrix deposition in kidneys via inhibition of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway. These results indicate that KCa3.1 blockade effectively reverses established diabetic nephropathy in this rodent model and provides a basis for progressing to human studies."
https://openalex.org/W2793088854,"Cell-based analytics for the detection of the beta1-adrenoceptor autoantibody (beta1-AAB) are functional, yet difficult to handle, and should be replaced by easily applicable, routine lab methods. Endeavors to develop solid-phase-based assays such as ELISA to exploit epitope moieties for trapping autoantibodies are ongoing. These solid-phase-based assays, however, are often unreliable when used with human patient material, in contrast to animal derived autoantibodies. We therefore tested an immunogen peptide-based ELISA for the detection of beta1-AAB, and compared commercially available goat antibodies against the 2nd extracellular loop of human beta1-adrenoceptor (ADRB1-AB) to autoantibodies enriched from patient material. The functionality of these autoantibodies was tested in a cell based assay for comparison and their structural appearance was investigated using 2D gel electrophoresis. The ELISA showed a limit of detection for ADRB1-AB of about 1.5 nmol antibody/L when spiked in human control serum and only about 25 nmol/L when spiked in species identical (goat) matrix material. When applied to samples of human origin, the ELISA failed to identify the specific beta1-AABs. A low concentration of beta1-AAB, together with structural inconsistency of the patient originated samples as seen from the 2D Gel appearance, might contribute to the failure of the peptide based ELISA technology to detect human beta1-AABs."
https://openalex.org/W2794154578,"The article describes the influence of a disease control scheme (the Norfolk-Suffolk Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Disease (BVD) Eradication scheme) on farmers' bio-security attitudes and behaviours. In 2010, a survey of 100 cattle farmers (53 scheme members vs. 47 out of scheme farmers) was undertaken among cattle farmers residing in Norfolk and Suffolk counties in the UK. A cross-sectional independent measures design was employed. The main analytical tool was content analysis. The following variables at the farmer-level were explored: the specific BVD control measures adopted, livestock disease priorities, motivation for scheme membership, wider knowledge acquisition, biosecurity behaviours employed and training course attendance. The findings suggest that participation in the BVD scheme improved farmers' perception of the scheme benefits and participation in training courses. However, no association was found between the taking part in the BVD scheme and livestock disease priorities or motivation for scheme participation, or knowledge about BVD bio-security measures employed. Equally importantly, scheme membership did appear to influence the importance accorded specific bio-security measures. Yet such ranking did not appear to reflect the actual behaviours undertaken. As such, disease control efforts alone while necessary, are insufficient. Rather, to enhance farmer bio-security behaviours significant effort must be made to address underlying attitudes to the specific disease threat involved."

The effect of the guidance strategy on the reduction of the rate of stops and total delay is explored by comparing the proposed model and the traditional FVD car-following model. The numerical results illustrate that potential conflicts between vehicles can be predicted and some stops can be avoided by decelerating in advance. The driving comfort and traffic efficiency can be improved accordingly. More benefits could be obtained under the long communication range, low to medium traffic density, and simple traffic pattern conditions."

Pantaneiro sheep are raised in Brazil under a tropical wetland ecosystem denominated Pantanal. Twenty-nine Pantaneiro sheep from different sex and physiological stages were sorted into three groups, simulating three of the most representative ovine meat products commercialized by South American industries: a) non castrated male lambs (n = 11); b) wethers (n = 9); c) cull ewes (n = 9). Animals from each physiological stage were submitted to different breeding systems, resembling farming strategies adopted in several developing countries of South America. The effect of physiological stages on the quality of meat was accessed using 16 variables measured in the longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LM) and the semimembranosus (SM) muscles. The variables were related to brightness, color, physical aspects, soluble and total collagen as well as chemical traits. The physiological stage was defined as a classification variable in order to proceed ANOVA tests and comparison of means (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis was used to identify patterns of similarity and differentiation between samples of different physiological stages (a, b, c). The results revealed that meat quality varies according to different physiological stages, especially between lambs (a) and cull ewes (c). As a consequence, the physiological stage at slaughter should be taken into consideration to cote the quality of meat from indigenous sheep raised in tropical regions.

The GOBP/PBP genes include six subgroups (GOBP1-2, PBP-A-D) previously reported to form a complex arrayed in a conserved order in representative moths (superfamily Bombycoidea) and butterflies (Nymphalidae). Although our knowledge of lepidopteran genomes has increased greatly recently, the structure of the GOBP/PBP complex has been studied only for species that represent limited lineages of the highly diverged Ditrysia. To understand the evolution of this functionally important gene complex, we determined 69-149 kb genomic sequences that include GOBP2 and five PBP genes in three Ostrinia moths (Pyraloidea), O. nubilalis, O. furnacalis, and O. latipennis, using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and fosmid clones. The structure of the GOBP2/PBP gene cluster was well conserved despite the different sex pheromone composition utilized by the three moths. Five expressed PBP genes in Ostrinia moths were the result of two duplications of PBP-A genes. Surprisingly, an allele containing a fusion gene between tandemly arrayed PBP-A genes was observed in O. nubilalis. We also revealed duplication and intra-chromosomal translocation of the GOBP1 gene in P. xylostella by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Additionally, we compared the structure of the GOBP/PBP gene complex of seventeen species covering six superfamilies and twelve families of the lepidopteran clade, Ditrysia, and found the gene order was basically conserved despite the frequent occurrence of lineage-specific gains, losses, inversions and translocations of these genes, compared with their neighboring genes. Our findings support the hypothesis that the structure of the GOBP/PBP gene complex was already established in the common ancestor of Ditrysia."

Previously, we and others have found that the regulation of SP for pigmentary function was mediated by neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R). Emerging evidence has accumulated that psychologic stress can induce dysfunction in the cutaneous serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-5-HT1A/1B receptor system, thereby resulting in skin hypopigmentation. Moreover, NK1R and 5-HTR (except 5-HT3) belong to GPCR. The present study aimed at assessing the possible existence of NK1R-5-HTR interactions and related melanogenic functions. Western blot and PCR detection revealed that SP reduced expression of 5-HT1A receptor via the NK1 receptor. Biochemical analyses showed that NK1R and 5-HT1AR could colocalize and interact in a cell and in the skin. When the N terminus of the NK1R protein was removed NK1R surface targeting was prevented, the interaction between NK1R-5-HT1AR decreased, and the depigmentation caused by SP and WAY100635 could be rescued. Importantly, pharmaceutical coadministration of NK1R agonist (SP) and 5-HT1A antagonist (WAY100635) enhanced the NK1-5-HT1A receptor coimmunoprecipitation along with the depigmentary response. SP and WAY100635 cooperation elicited activation of a signaling cascade (the extracellular, regulated protein kinase p-JNK signaling pathway) and inhibition of p70S6K1 phosphorylation and greatly reduced melanin production in vitro and in vivo in mice and zebrafish. Moreover, the SP-induced depigmentation response did not be occur in 5-htr1aa+/- zebrafish embryos. Taken together, the results of our systemic study increases our knowledge of the roles of NK1R and 5-HT1AR in melanogenesis and provides possible, novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of skin hypo/hyperpigmentation.-Wu, H., Zhao, Y., Huang, Q., Cai, M., Pan, Q., Fu, M., An, X., Xia, Z., Liu, M., Jin, Y., He, L., Shang, J. NK1R/5-HT1AR interaction is related to the regulation of melanogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2787270563,"Platelets (PLTs) are classically used in the clinical setting to maintain hemostasis. Recent evidence supports important roles for PLTs in host inflammatory and immune responses, and PLT-rich plasma has been demonstrated to inhibit the growth of bacteria in vitro and in vivo; however, few studies have examined whether PLTs can inhibit bacterial growth directly, and related mechanisms have not been elucidated further. Accordingly, in this study, we evaluated the effects of PLTs on bacterial growth. We washed and purified PLTs from peripheral blood, then confirmed that PLTs significantly inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus when cocultured in vitro. Moreover, PLTs damaged DNA and blocked cell division in S. aureus. During coculture, PLT-derived TGF-β1 was dramatically down-regulated compared with that in PLT culture alone, and the addition of TGF-β1tothe coculture system promoted the inhibition of PLTs on S. aureus. Analysis of a murine S. aureus infection model demonstrated that the depletion of PLTs exacerbated the severity of infection, whereas the transfusion of PLTs alleviated this infection. Our observations demonstrate that PLTs could directly inhibit the growth of S. aureus by damaging DNA and blockage cell division, and that PLT-derived TGF-β1 may play an important role in this machinery.—Xu, J., Yi, J., Zhang, H., Feng, F., Gu, S., Weng, L., Zhang, J., Chen, Y., An, N., Liu, Z., An, Q., Yin, W., Hu, X.

https://openalex.org/W2580833121,"We consider the problem of concurrent portfolio losses in two non-overlapping credit portfolios. In order to explore the full statistical dependence structure of such portfolio losses, we estimate their empirical pairwise copulas. Instead of a Gaussian dependence, we typically find a strong asymmetry in the copulas. Concurrent large portfolio losses are much more likely than small ones. Studying the dependences of these losses as a function of portfolio size, we moreover reveal that not only large portfolios of thousands of contracts, but also medium-sized and small ones with only a few dozens of contracts exhibit notable portfolio loss correlations. Anticipated idiosyncratic effects turn out to be negligible. These are troublesome insights not only for investors in structured fixed-income products, but particularly for the stability of the financial sector. JEL codes: C32, F34, G21, G32, H81."
https://openalex.org/W2791077615,"Hippocampal theta oscillations have been implicated in working memory and attentional process, which might be useful for the brain-machine interface (BMI). To further elucidate the properties of the hippocampal theta oscillations that can be used in BMI, we investigated hippocampal theta oscillations during a two-lever choice task. During the task body-restrained rats were trained with a food reward to move an e-puck robot towards them by pressing the correct lever, ipsilateral to the robot several times, using the ipsilateral forelimb. The robot carried food and moved along a semicircle track set in front of the rat. We demonstrated that the power of hippocampal theta oscillations gradually increased during a 6-s preparatory period before the start of multiple lever pressing, irrespective of whether the correct lever choice or forelimb side were used. In addition, there was a significant difference in the theta power after the first choice, between correct and incorrect trials. During the correct trials the theta power was highest during the first lever-releasing period, whereas in the incorrect trials it occurred during the second correct lever-pressing period. We also analyzed the hippocampal theta oscillations at the termination of multiple lever pressing during the correct trials. Irrespective of whether the correct forelimb side was used, the power of hippocampal theta oscillations gradually decreased with the termination of multiple lever pressing. The frequency of theta oscillation also demonstrated an increase and decrease, before and after multiple lever pressing, respectively. There was a transient increase in frequency after the first lever press during the incorrect trials, while no such increase was observed during the correct trials. These results suggested that hippocampal theta oscillations reflect some aspects of preparatory and cognitive neural activities during the robot controlling task, which could be used for BMI."
