https://openalex.org/W2163565167,"DNA clones of the wild-type p53 proto-oncogene inhibit the ability of E1A plus ras or mutant p53 plus ras-activated oncogenes to transform primary rat embryo fibroblasts. The rare clones of transformed foci that result from E1A plus ras plus wild-type p53 triple transfections all contain the p53 DNA in their genome, but the great majority fail to express the p53 protein. The three cell lines derived from such foci that express p53 all produce mutant p53 proteins with properties similar or identical to transformation-activated p53 proteins. The p53 mutants selected in this fashion (transformation in vitro) resemble the p53 mutants selected in tumors (in vivo). These results suggest that the p53 proto-oncogene can act negatively to block transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2087375731,"The role of a local angiotensin system in the vascular response to arterial injury was investigated by administering the angiotensin-converting enzyme (CE) inhibitor cilazapril to normotensive rats in which the left carotid artery was subjected to endothelial denudation and injury by balloon catheterization. In control animals, by 14 days after balloon injury, the processes of smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, migration of SMCs from the media to the intima, and synthesis of extracellular matrix produced marked thickening of the intima, with reduction of the cross-sectional area of the lumen. However, in animals that received continuous treatment with the CE inhibitor, neointima formation was decreased (by about 80 percent), and lumen integrity was preserved. Thus, the angiotensin-converting enzyme may participate in modulating the proliferative response of the vascular wall after arterial injury, and inhibition of this enzyme may have therapeutic applications to prevent the proliferative lesions that occur after coronary angioplasty and vascular surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2049478058,"The staphylococcal toxins are responsible for a number of diseases in man and other animals. Many of them have also long been known to be powerful T cell stimulants. They do not, however, stimulate all T cells. On the contrary, each toxin reacts with human T cells bearing particular V beta sequences as part of their receptors for major histocompatibility complex protein-associated antigen. The specificity of these toxins for V beta s puts them in the recently described class of superantigens and may account for the differential sensitivity of different individuals to the toxic effects of these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2123738381,"The genes for two new P-type ATPases, PMR1 and PMR2, have been identified in yeast. A comparison of the deduced sequences of the PMR proteins with other known ion pumps showed that both proteins are very similar to Ca2+ ATPases. PMR1 is identical to SSC1, a gene previously identified by its effect on secretion of some foreign proteins from yeast. Proteins secreted from pmr1 mutants lack the outer chain glycosylation that normally results from passage through the Golgi. Loss of PMR1 function suppresses the lethality of ypt1-1, a mutation that blocks the secretion pathway. These data suggest that PMR1 functions as a Ca2+ pump affecting transit through the secretory pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2050932117,"In addition to Rb and p53, a third cellular protein, p120 in monkey and p118 in human cells, forms a specific complex with SV40 large T antigen (T). is not a product of the Rb gene. As was shown with complex formation, the interaction between T and p120 is dependent on the intact nature of a ten residue, transformation-controlling domain in T (residues 105–114). In mouse cells, a readily detectable protein of 115 kd was detected, which, like murine Rb, also forms a stable complex with T. Like , p115 binding is also dependent on the intact nature of the 105–114 sequence. Given their similar size and T antigen binding sequence dependence, p115 and may be products of the same gene in different species. These results suggest that interactions between T and p115/118/120, as well as T and Rb, contribute to the SV40 transforming mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2159398732,"The amino acid sequence of the ecto-ATPase from rat liver was deduced from analysis of cDNA clones and a genomic clone. Immunoblots with antibodies raised against a peptide sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence indicated that the determined amino acid sequence is that of the ecto-ATPase. The deduced sequence predicts a 519-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 57,388 daltons. There are 16 potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites in the protein. Hydropathy analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence indicates that the protein has two hydrophobic stretches. One is located at the N-terminal and the other is near the C-terminal end. A full-length clone encoding the ecto-ATPase was expressed transiently in mouse L cells and human HeLa cells. The cell lysate from the transfected cells contained immunoreactive ecto-ATPase and Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activities. The expressed protein is glycosylated and has an apparent molecular weight (100,000) similar to that of the rat liver plasma membrane ecto-ATPase."

Immune BALB/c mice were shown to develop malaria-specific, CD8+ T cell-dependent inflammatory infiltrates in their livers after challenge with Plasmodium berghei sporozoites. Spleen cells from immune BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice eliminated hepatocytes infected with the liver stage of P. berghei in vitro. The activity against infected hepatocytes is not inhibited by antibodies to interferon-γ and is not present in culture supernatants. It is genetically restricted, an indication that malaria antigens on the hepatocyte surface are recognized by immune T effector cells. Subunit vaccine development will require identification of the antigens recognized by these T cells and a method of immunization that induces such immunity."
https://openalex.org/W1494639580,"Abstract Non-acetylated glucosamine is an unusual structural feature shared by all glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipids, including a variety of membrane anchors, the leishmanial lipophosphoglycan, and a mediator of insulin action. We proposed previously a pathway for biosynthesis of glycolipid A, the precursor of the GPI membrane anchor of the trypanosome variant surface glycoprotein (Masterson, W. J., Doering, T. L., Hart, G. W., and Englund, P. T. (1989) Cell 56, 793-800). In this paper we characterize in more detail the initial steps of GPI assembly. The first and committed step in the pathway is the transfer of GlcNAc, from UDP-GlcNAc, to endogenous phosphatidylinositol to form N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphatidylinositol (GlcNAc-PI). The GlcNAc-PI is then efficiently deacetylated to form glucosaminyl phosphatidylinositol (GlcN-PI), the substrate for subsequent reactions en route to glycolipid A."
https://openalex.org/W2138625446,"Abstract Synthetic peptides corresponding to the calmodulin-binding domain of the human erythrocyte Ca2+ pump were prepared representing residues 2-29 (C28W), 2-21 (C20W), 2-16 (C15W), and 16-29 (C14) of the sequence (James, P., Maeda, M., Fisher, R., Verma, A. K., Krebs, J., Penniston, J. T., and Carafoli, E. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2905-2910). Peptides C28W, C20W, and C15W bound to calmodulin with an apparent 1:1 stoichiometry in the presence of Ca2+ and inhibited the activation of the Ca2+ pump by calmodulin, while C14 was ineffective. Substituting tyrosine (C28Y) or alanine (C28A) for the tryptophan residue lowered the affinity for calmodulin. The estimated Kd values for the calmodulin-peptide complexes were 0.1 nM for C28W, 5-15 nM for C20W, C28Y, and C28A, and 700-1700 nM for C15W. The Ca2+ pump in inside-out erythrocyte membrane vesicles was activated by proteolytic removal of the endogenous calmodulin-binding domain. Addition of C20W or C28W then inhibited calmodulin-independent Ca2+ transport, while a calmodulin-binding peptide from another enzyme had no effect. The inhibition of the pump by C20W was purely competitive with Ca2+, while C28W decreased the Vmax and increased the K1/2 for Ca2+, restoring the pump activity nearly to its low basal level. The results suggest that a calmodulin-binding peptide from any enzyme has two kinds of specificity: it shares with peptides from other enzymes the ability to bind to calmodulin, but only it has the specificity to interact with its own (proteolytically activated) enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1596299677,"Abstract An azide- and vanadate-insensitive, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive ATPase has been partially purified from a fraction enriched with potassium transporting goblet cell apical membranes of Manduca sexta larval midgut. The properties of the membrane-bound ATPase activity were identical to those of the ATPase activity of highly purified goblet cell apical membranes (Wieczorek, H., Wolfersberger, M. G., Cioffi, M., and Harvey, W. R. (1986) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 857, 271-281). 90% of the azide- and vanadate-insensitive ATPase activity was solubilized by C12E10, leaving 90% of the contaminating azide-sensitive mitochondrial ATPase activity in the pellet after centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 1 h. After discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation of the supernatant at 220,000 x g for 1 h nearly all of the azide- and vanadate-insensitive ATPase activity was found in the 30% sucrose fraction without contaminating azide- or vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity. Two prominent bands with relative molecular masses (Mr) of about 600,000 and 900,000, both displaying azide-insensitive and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive ATPase activity, were found in native microgradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the 30% sucrose fraction. The two bands could not be separated by anion exchange chromatography. Denaturation of both bands resulted in the same polypeptide pattern (five major bands with Mr 70,000, 57,000, 46,000, 29,000 and 17,000) in sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating that they represented oligomers of the same protein unit. Substrate and inhibitor specificities of the partially purified ATPase were similar to those of the membrane-bound ATPase activity, whereas salt selectivity differed partly. Altogether, structural and functional properties of the ATPase strongly resemble those of vacuolar-type ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W1580780385,"Abstract We have purified three 35-kDa calcium- and phospholipid-binding proteins from rat liver. These three calcimedins bind to phosphatidylserine in a calcium-dependent manner and have been termed 35 alpha, 35 beta, and 35 gamma based on their relative charge as determined by isoelectric focusing. Purification of the three 35-kDa calcimedins is achieved by phenyl-Sepharose, ion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography. Antibody was produced against the annexin consensus peptide, Lys-Ala-Met-Lys-Gly-Leu-Gly-Thr-Asp-Glu, which was derived from the sequence of several Ca2+/phospholipid-binding proteins including calpactin, lipocortin, endonexin II, 67-kDa calelectrin, lymphocyte 68-kDa protein, and protein II. Recognition of each 35-kDa calcimedin by anticonsensus sequence antibody places them in this protein family. Antibodies against each 35-kDa calcimedin were raised and purified by antigen-affinity chromatography. Each antibody is monospecific for the respective 35-kDa calcimedin. Immunological cross-reactivity defines 35 alpha, 35 beta, and 35 gamma as lipocortins III, IV, and V, respectively. Surveys by immunoblot analysis using these monospecific antibodies demonstrate a markedly different tissue expression pattern for each 35-kDa calcimedin. Furthermore, the levels of 35 alpha, 35 beta, and 35 gamma are differentially regulated in maturing rat ovary and uterus. Each calcimedin has been localized by indirect immunofluorescence within specific cell types. These results support the concept that mediation of the intracellular calcium signal can occur via multiple pathways through several related yet independent mediator proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1559858723,"Abstract Replication of the chromosome of bacteriophage lambda depends on the cooperative action of two phage-coded proteins and seven replication and heat shock proteins from its Escherichia coli host. As previously described, the first stage in this process is the binding of multiple copies of the lambda O initiator to the lambda replication origin (ori lambda) to form the nucleosomelike O-some. The O-some serves to localize subsequent protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions involved in the initiation of lambda DNA replication to ori lambda. To study these interactions, we have developed a sensitive immunoblotting protocol that permits the protein constituents of complex nucleoprotein structures to be identified. Using this approach, we have defined a series of sequential protein assembly and protein disassembly events that occur at ori lambda during the initiation of lambda DNA replication. A second-stage ori lambda.O (lambda O protein).P (lambda P protein).DnaB nucleoprotein structure is formed when O, P, and E. coli DnaB helicase are incubated with ori lambda DNA. In a third-stage reaction the E. coli DnaJ heat shock protein specifically binds to the second-stage structure to form an ori lambda.O.P.DnaB.DnaJ complex. Each of the nucleoprotein structures formed in the first three stages was isolated and shown to be a physiological intermediate in the initiation of lambda DNA replication. The E. coli DnaK heat shock protein can bind to any of these early stage nucleoprotein structures, and in a fourth-stage reaction a complete ori lambda.O.P.DnaB.DnaJ.DnaK initiation complex is assembled. Addition of ATP to the reaction enables the DnaK and DnaJ heat shock proteins to mediate a partial disassembly of the fourth-stage complex. These protein disassembly reactions activate the intrinsic helicase activity of DnaB and result in localized unwinding of the ori lambda template. The protein disassembly reactions are described in the accompanying articles."
https://openalex.org/W1980476330,"We have used oligonucleotides made of 2′-OMe RNA to analyze the role of separate domains of U2 snRNA in the splicing process. We show that antisense 2′-OMe RNA oligonucleotides bind efficiently and specifically to U2 snRNP and demonstrate that masking of two separate regions of U2 snRNA can inhibit splicing by affecting different steps in the spliceosome assembly pathway. Masking the 5′ terminus of U2 snRNA does not prevent U2 snRNP binding to pre-mRNA but blocks subsequent assembly of a functional spliceosome. By contrast, masking of U2 sequences complementary to the pre-mRNA branch site completely inhibits binding of pre-mRNA. Hybrid formation at the branch site complementary region also triggers a specific change which affects the 5′ terminus of U2 snRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1593573243,"Abstract The sequence of 10 amino acids (ICSDKTGTLT357) at the site of phosphorylation of the rabbit fast twitch muscle Ca2+-ATPase is highly conserved in the family of cation-transporting ATPases. We changed each of the residues flanking Asp351, Lys352, and Thr353 to an amino acid differing in size or polarity and assayed the mutant for Ca2+ transport activity and autophosphorylation with ATP or P1. We found that conservative changes (Ile----Leu, Thr----Ser, Gly----Ala) or the alteration of Cys349 to alanine did not destroy Ca2+ transport activity or phosphoenzyme formation, whereas nonconservative changes (Ile----Thr, Leu----Ser) did disrupt function. These results indicate that very conservative changes in the amino acids flanking Asp351, Lys352, and Thr353 can be accommodated. A number of mutations were also introduced into amino acids predicted to be involved in nucleotide binding, in particular those in the conserved sequences KGAPE519, RDAGIRVIMITGDNK629, and KK713. Our results indicate that amino acids KGAPE519, Arg615, Gly618, Arg620, and Lys712-Lys713 are not essential for nucleotide binding, although changes to Lys515 diminished Ca2+ transport activity but not phosphoenzyme formation. Changes of Gly626 and Asp627 abolished phosphoenzyme formation with both ATP and Pi, indicating that these residues may contribute to the conformation of the catalytic center."
https://openalex.org/W1574522151,"Abstract Binding of the O protein of phage lambda to the replication origin (ori lambda) results in the formation of an organized nucleoprotein structure termed the O-some. The O-some serves to localize and initiate a six-protein sequential reaction that provides for localized unwinding of the origin region, the critical prepriming step for precise initiation of DNA replication. By the use of electron microscopy of gold-tagged antibody complexes, we have defined four stages of protein association and dissociation reactions that are involved in the prepriming pathway. First, as defined previously, O protein binds to multiple DNA sites and self-associates to form the O-some. Second, lambda P and host DnaB proteins add to the O-some to generate an O.P.DnaB.ori lambda complex. Addition of the DnaK and DnaJ proteins yields a third stage complex containing DnaK, DnaJ, O, P, and DnaB. With the addition of ATP and single-strand binding protein (SSB), the P protein is largely removed, and the DnaB acts as a helicase to generate locally unwound, SSB-coated single strand DNA. Thus, the initiation of lambda DNA replication requires ordered assembly and partial disassembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures. The disassembly activity of DnaK and DnaJ may be their general role in the heat shock response."
https://openalex.org/W1566405665,"In this paper we report a detailed enzymatic characterization of the interaction of the polymerase accessory protein complex of the T4 DNA replication system with the various nucleic acid cofactors that activate the ATPase of the complex. We show that the ATPase activity of the T4 coded gene 44/62 protein complex is stimulated synergistically by binding of DNA and T4 gene 45 protein and that the level of ATPase activation appears to be directly correlated with the binding of nucleic acid cofactor. Binding of any partially or completely single-stranded DNA to the complete accessory protein complex increases the catalytic activity (as measured by Vmax) while decreasing the binding affinity for the ATP substrate. While single-stranded DNA is a moderately effective cofactor, we find that the optimal nucleic acid-binding site for the complex is the primer-template junction, rather than single-stranded DNA ends as previously reported in the literature. Gene 45 protein plays an essential role in directing the specificity of binding to primer-template sites, lowering the Km for primer-template sites almost 1000-fold, and increasing Vmax 100-fold, compared with the analogous values for gene 44/62 protein alone. The most effective primer-template site for binding and enzymatic activation has the physiologically relevant recessed 3′-OH configuration and an optimal size in excess of 18 base pairs of duplex DNA. We find that the chemical nature of the primer terminus (i.e. 3′-OH or 3′-H) does not affect the extent of ATPase activation and that binding of the polymerase accessory protein complex to DNA cofactors is salt concentration dependent but appreciably less so when the activating DNA is a primer-template junction. Finally, we show that the gene 32 protein (T4 coded single-stranded DNA-binding protein) can compete with the polymerase accessory protein complex for single-stranded DNA but not for the primer-template junction activation sites. The implications of these results for the structure and function of the polymerase accessory protein complex within the T4 DNA replication system are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1608094563,"Temperature-sensitive folding mutations (tsf) of the thermostable P22 tailspike protein prevent the mutant polypeptide chain from reaching the native state at the higher end of the temperature range of bacterial growth (37–42 °C). At lower temperatures the mutant polypeptide chains fold and associate into native proteins. The melting temperatures of the purified native forms of seven different tsf mutant proteins have been determined by differential scanning calorimetry. Under conditions in which the wild type protein had a melting temperature of 88.4 °C, the melting temperatures of the mutant proteins were all above 82 °C, more than 40 °C higher than the temperature for expression of the folding defect. Because the folding defects were observed in vivo,the thermostability of the native protein was also examined with infected cells. Once matured at 28 °C, intracellular tsf mutant tailspikes remained native when the cells were transferred to 42 °C, a temperature that prevents newly synthesized tsf chains from folding correctly. These results confirm that the failure of tsf polypeptide chains to reach their native state is not due to a lowered stability of the native state. Such mutants differ from the class of ts mutations which render the native state thermolabile. The intracellular folding defects must reflect decreased stabilities of folding intermediates or alteration in the off-pathway steps leading to aggregation and inclusion body formation. These results indicate that the stability of a native protein within the cells is not sufficient to insure the successful folding of the newly synthesized chains into the native state."
https://openalex.org/W1577788712,"The surface distribution of the plasma membrane Ca2+ (Mg2+)-ATPase (ecto-ATPase) in rat hepatocytes was determined by several methods. 1) Two polyclonal antibodies specific for the ecto-ATPase were used to examine the distribution of the enzyme in frozen sections of rat liver by immunofluorescence. Fluorescent staining was observed at the bile canalicular region of hepatocytes. 2) Plasma membranes were isolated from the canalicular and sinusoidal regions of rat liver. The specific activity of ecto-ATPase in the canalicular membranes was 22 times higher than that of sinusoidal membranes. The enrichment of the ecto-ATPase activity in the canalicular membrane is closely parallel to that of two other canalicular membrane markers, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and leucine aminopeptidase. 3) By immunoblots with polyclonal antibodies against the ecto-ATPase and the Na+,K+-ATPase, it was found that the ecto-ATPase protein was only detected in canalicular membranes and not in sinusoidal membranes, while the Na+,K+-ATPase protein was only detected in sinusoidal membranes and not in canalicular membranes. These results indicate that the ecto-ATPase is enriched in the canalicular membranes of rat hepatocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1601570542,"Abstract The human multipotential hematopoietic cell line K562 expresses fibronectin receptor (FNR) subunits of 160 kDa (alpha chain) and 120 kDa (beta chain). Treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) led to reduced binding of K562 to immobilized fibronectin (FN), although treated cells expressed 10-fold more cell surface FNR than untreated cells. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis confirmed this and showed altered electrophoretic mobilities of FNR subunits from TPA-treated cells. TPA treatment affected N-linked glycosylation, as tunicamycin treatment of K562 cells abolished differences in FNR mobility. Sialidase treatment of FNR immunoprecipitates minimized and sialidase treatment of intact cells eliminated these mobility differences between subunits from control and TPA-treated cells. Reduced sialylation of FNR from TPA-treated cells was further demonstrated by chromatography with bead-coupled lectins and by the greater negative charge of untreated K562 FNR subunits in two-dimensional isoelectric focusing-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A relationship between reduced FNR sialylation and reduced FN binding was suggested by adhesion assays of sialidase-treated K562 which showed that desialylation of cell surface FNR was associated with decreased cell adhesion. Thus, TPA treatment reduces the function, increases the expression, and alters the structure of K562 FNR, and these changes appear to involve FNR sialylation."
https://openalex.org/W1536405101,"We have identified a protein(s) on the surface of hepatocytes that binds to the core protein of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan of basement membranes. These cells attached and spread on substrates prepared from the basement membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and its core protein (HSPG-core). Three proteins (Mr = 38,000, 36,000, and 26,000) were found to bind to a HSPG-core affinity column using extracts of iodinated hepatocytes, whereas proteins extracted from isolated membranes contained primarily the larger protein (Mr = 38,000). Similar results were obtained using a solid phase binding technique using labeled HSPG-core. Binding of HSPG-core to the protein (Mr = 38,000) was not altered by the presence of an excess of heparin, heparan sulfate, fibronectin, laminin, or collagen IV but was reduced by unlabeled HSPG-core. Similar studies showed that the binding protein (Mr = 3,0000) was present in extracts from the membranes of Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor cells, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, COS cells, melanoma cells, and rat kidney epithelial cells but not in fibroblasts. The protein was found in increased amounts in 3T3 cells treated with retinoic acid. These observations suggest that a variety of cells that contact basement membrane contain the proteoglycan-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1494222932,"Abstract The binding of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) to fibrin increases upon digestion of fibrin with plasmin. Optimal binding is observed following a limited plasmin digestion of fibrin, coinciding with the generation of fibrin fragment X polymers. We studied the involvement of the separate domains of the amino-terminal heavy (H) chain of rt-PA in this augmentation of fibrin binding. The fibrin-binding characteristics of a set of rt-PA deletion mutants, lacking either one or more of the structural domains of the H chain, were determined on intact fibrin matrices and on fibrin matrices that were subjected to limited digestion with plasmin. The augmented fibrin binding of rt-PA is partially abolished when the plasmin-degraded fibrin matrices are subsequently treated with carboxypeptidase B, demonstrating that this increased binding is dependent on the generation of carboxyl-terminal lysine residues in the fibrin matrix. Evidence is provided that this increase of fibrin binding is mediated by the kringle 2 (K2) domain that contains a lysine-binding site. Further increase of the fibrin binding of rt-PA is independent of the presence of carboxyl-terminal lysines. It is shown that the latter increase is not mediated by the K2 domain. Based on our data, we propose that the increase in fibrin binding, unrelated to the presence of carboxyl-terminal lysine residues, is mediated by the finger (F) domain, provided that this domain is correctly exposed in the remainder of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1570203195,"Abstract Intermediates in the intracellular chain folding and association pathway of the P22 tailspike endorhamnosidase have been identified previously by physiological and genetic methods. Conditions have now been found for the in vitro refolding of this large (Mr = 215,000) oligomeric protein. Purified Salmonella phage P22 tailspikes, while very stable to urea in neutral solution, were dissociated by moderate concentrations of urea at acidic pH. The tailspike protein was denatured to unfolded polypeptide chains in 6 M urea, pH 3, as disclosed by analytical ultracentrifugation, fluorescence, and circular dichroism. Upon dilution into neutral buffer at 10 degrees C, the polypeptides fold spontaneously and associate to form trimeric tailspikes with high yield. Like native phage P22 tailspikes, the reconstitution product is resistant to denaturation by dodecyl sulfate in the cold and displays endorhamnosidase activity. Sedimentation coefficients, electrophoretic mobility, and fluorescence emission maxima of native and reconstituted tailspikes are identical within experimental error. By characterization of intermediates, localization of temperature-sensitive steps, and analysis of the effect of previously identified folding mutations, the reconstitution system described should allow comparison of in vivo and in vitro folding pathways of this large protein oligomer."
https://openalex.org/W1575425448,"Hen oviduct membranes were shown to contain high activity of a novel enzyme, UDP-GlcNac:GlcNAc beta 1-6(GlcNAc beta 1-2) Man alpha-R (GlcNAc to Man) beta 4-GlcNAc-transferase VI. The enzyme was shown to transfer GlcNAc in beta 1-4 linkage to the D-mannose residue of GlcNAc beta 1-6 (GlcNAc beta 1-2) Man alpha-R where R is either 1-6Man beta-(CH2)8COOCH3 or methyl. Radioactive enzyme products were purified by several chromatographic steps, including high performance liquid chromatography, and structures were determined by proton nmr, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, and methylation analysis to be GlcNAc beta 1-6 ([14C]GlcNAc beta 1-4) (GlcNAc beta 1-2) Man alpha-R. The enzyme is stimulated by Triton X-100 and has optimum activity at a relatively high MnCl2 concentration of about 100 mM; Co2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ could partially substitute for Mn2+. A tissue survey demonstrated high GlcNAc-transferase VI activity in hen oviduct and lower activity in chicken liver and colon, duck colon, and turkey intestine. No activity was found in mammalian tissues. Hen oviduct membranes cannot act on GlcNAc beta 1-6Man alpha-R but have a beta 4-GlcNAc-transferase activity that converts GlcNAc beta 1-2Man alpha-R to GlcNAc beta 1-4(GlcNAc beta 1-2) Man alpha-R where R is either 1-6Man beta-(CH2)8COOCH3 or 1-6Man beta methyl. The latter activity is probably due to GlcNAc-transferase IV which preferentially adds GlcNAc in beta 1-4 linkage to the Man alpha 1-3 arm of the GlcNAc beta 1-2Man alpha 1-6(GlcNAc beta 1-2Man alpha 1-3)Man beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-4GlcNAc-Asn core structure of asparagine-linked glycans. The minimum structural requirement for a substrate of beta 4-GlcNAc-transferase VI is therefore the trisaccharide GlcNAc beta 1-6(GlcNAc beta 1-2) Man alpha-; this trisaccharide is found on the Man alpha 6 arm of many branched complex asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. The data suggest that GlcNAc-transferase VI acts after the synthesis of the GlcNAc beta 1-2Man alpha 1-3-, GlcNAc beta 1-2Man alpha 1-6-, and GlcNAc beta 1-6 Man alpha 1-6-branches by GlcNAc-transferases I, II, and V, respectively, and is responsible for the synthesis of branched oligosaccharides containing the GlcNAc beta 1-6(GlcNAc beta 1-4)(GlcNAc beta 1-2)Man alpha 1-6Man beta moiety."
https://openalex.org/W1592848557,"Abstract Mouse monoclonal antibody AA4 inhibits the binding of IgE to high affinity IgE receptors on the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3. As shown by immunostaining of thin layer chromatograms, antibody AA4 binds avidly to two disialogangliosides (antigen I and antigen II) that occur in this cell line. The two antigens were purified by anion exchange chromatography followed by short-bed continuous thin-layer chromatography. About 230 micrograms of antigen I and 60 micrograms of antigen II were obtained from 20 g (wet weight) of leukemia cells. The structures of both purified antigens were determined to be alpha-galactosyl derivatives of the ganglioside GD1b by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, by chemical ionization-mass spectrometry of permethylated samples, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of partially methylated alditol acetates, and by treatment with exoglycosidases and mild acid hydrolysis. The structure of antigen I is: (formula; see text) Antigen II has an additional alpha-galactosyl residue as follows: (formula; see text) The ceramide of antigen I contains approximately equal amounts of C24:0, C22:0, C20:0, C18:0, and C16:0 N-acyl fatty acids. The ceramide base is predominantly sphingosine along with a small amount of dihydrosphingosine. In contrast, the ceramide of antigen II contains mainly C24:0 N-acyl fatty acid with much lower amounts of C22:0, C20:0, and C18:0 fatty acids. Moreover, the ceramide base is approximately 55% sphingosine and 45% dihydrosphingosine. No unsaturated N-acyl fatty acids were detected in either antigen."
https://openalex.org/W1479663958,"Extraction of isolated axonemes from trout (Salmo gairdneri) sperm with 0.6 M NaCl removed 97% of the outer arms, approximately 12% of the protein, and approximately 50% of the MgATPase activity. Fractionation of this high salt extract by sucrose density gradient centrifugation yielded a single peak of ATPase activity with an apparent sedimentation coefficient of 19 S. Electrophoretic analysis showed that this 19 S particle was composed of two heavy chains (termed alpha and beta; Mr 430,000 and 415,000, respectively), five intermediate molecular weight chains (IC1-IC5; Mr 85,000, 73,000, 65,000, 63,000, and 57,000), and six light chains (LC1-LC6; Mr 22,000-6,000). A similar complex was obtained following further purification by DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography. Quantitative densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gels indicated that the heavy and intermediate chains were present in equimolar amounts. Electron microscopic examination of the 19 S particles revealed that it consisted of two globular heads joined together by a Y-shaped stem. The 19 S particle had a specific MgATPase activity of 1.1 +/- 0.3 mumol of phosphate released/min/mg and exhibited an apparent Km for MgATP2- of 40 +/- 16 microM. MnATP2- and CaATP2- were hydrolyzed at rates 100 and 80% that of MgATP2-, respectively. The Mg-ATPase activity was inhibited by vanadate, but not by ouabain or oligomycin, and exhibited a high activity between pH 7.0 and 10.0 with a maximum at pH 9.0-9.5. ATP was the preferred nucleotide, although GTP and CTP (but not ITP) did interact with the dynein to a minor extent. Based on its origin, sedimentation coefficient, polypeptide composition, and enzymatic properties, we conclude that this two-headed 19 S particle represents the entire trout sperm axonemal outer arm dynein. This dynein is probably exemplary of the outer arm dyneins of other vertebrates."

Parallel to histidine modification, NAD+ binding and the NAD-glycohydrolase and ADP-ribosyltransferase activities of DT-A are lost. Both NAD+ and adenosine are very effective in protecting DT-A from histidine modification and in preserving its biological properties, while adenine is ineffective. Reversal of histidine modification with hydroxylamine restores both NAD+ binding and enzymatic activities of the toxin. The possible role of His-21 in the activity of diphtheria toxin is discussed in relation to the available three-dimensional structure of the related toxin produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa."
https://openalex.org/W1517896150,"Abstract Three glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol glycolipids recognized by antibodies from patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis were extracted from Leishmania major promastigotes by hexane:isopropanol and then purified by thin layer chromatography and LH-20 gel chromatography. Structural analysis was carried out using chemical analyses, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, and 1H NMR. The major structures deduced can be summarized as follows: (formula: see text) where n = 0, 1, 2; R1 = (CH2)23-CH3; R2 = (CH2)14-CH3 or (CH2)16-CH3. Alkyl-acyl substitutions in the glycerol backbone showed considerable heterogeneity. These three glycolipids belong to a relatively new class of compounds and may represent sequential steps in the biosynthesis of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositols which anchor proteins or other glycoconjugates to Leishmania cell membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1659314735,"Biosynthesis of the human IFNγ receptor was studied using metabolic labeling techniques and immunoprecipitation with receptor-specific monoclonal antibodies. Colo-205 and HepG2 cells labeled with [35S]methionine gave rise to two components with molecular mass 75 and 90 kDa following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. No bands were detected when immunoprecipitation was performed using irrelevant monoclonal IgG or in the presence of excess ligand, a condition known to block antibody-receptor interaction. When Colo-205 were labeled for increasing periods of time, the 75-kDa form was detected after 5 min, whereas the 90-kDa form appeared only after 60 min. Pulse-chase analysis established that the 75-kDa form was the precursor of the 90-kDa component. Only the 90-kDa form was detected on extrinsically radioiodinated Colo-205 cell surfaces. This observation was confirmed by Western blot analysis of isolated Colo-205 membranes. Digestion of labeled precipitates with peptide:N-glycosidase F caused a 22% reduction in the apparent molecular weight of the IFNγ receptor. Receptor derived from tunicamycin-treated Colo-205 labeled for 5 min displayed a single molecular mass of 65 kDa and expressed ligand binding activity. Longer labeling periods in the presence of tunicamycin revealed the appearance of a second ligand-binding form of 70 kDa. Thus, Colo-205 IFNγ receptors carry asparagine (N)-linked oligosaccharides and possibly some other form of post-translational modification."
https://openalex.org/W1511038436,"Abstract We have applied the principle of complementary hydropathy to the prediction of the binding site for fibronectin (FN) and for the alpha-chain of fibrinogen in the platelet receptor complex glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa. Since both ligands bind to it through their respective RGDS (Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser) domains and since both have been cloned, we were able to deduce the amino acid sequence of the binding site from the nucleotide sequence coding for RGDS in both proteins. The deduced peptides were very similar. Antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide WTVPTA (Trp-Thr-Val-Pro-Thr-Ala) deduced from the cloned rat FN RGDS domain block ADP-mediated platelet aggregation; this block can be overcome by additional fibrinogen. In Western blots of whole cell platelet extracts run under reducing conditions, this antibody binds to a 108-kDa band. It also binds to affinity-purified GP IIIa. Furthermore, it reacts strongly with GP IIIa immunoprecipitated by a commercially available anti-GP IIb-IIIa monoclonal antibody. Binding of affinity-purified GP IIb-IIIa complex to fibronectin is inhibited by the 110-kDa FN fragment. Similar inhibitions can be effected by WTVPTA (Trp-Thr-Val-Pro-Thr-Ala) and GAVSTA (Gly-Ala-Val-Ser-Thr-Ala) predicted from the rat and human fibronectin nucleotide sequences, respectively. GAGSTA (Gly-Ala-Gly-Ser-Thr-Ala) and GARSTA (Gly-Ala-Arg-Ser-Thr-Ala) related to the human peptide but with discrepant hydropathies are noninhibitory."
https://openalex.org/W1562494281,"Abstract The Ca2+ dependence of the Ca2+-pumping ATPase of bovine cardiac sarcolemma was studied for four states of activation: (a) unactivated, (b) cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP protein kinase C-subunit)-activated, (c) calmodulin (CAM)-activated, and (d) CAM plus cAMP protein kinase C-subunit-activated. Analysis of the Ca2+ dependence of active transport gave the following Vmax (nanomoles Ca2+/(mg x min], Km (nM) for Ca2+, and Hill coefficient values for the four states at pH 7.4, 37 degrees C: (a) 1.7 +/- 0.3, 1800 +/- 100, 1.6 +/- 0.1; (b) 3.1 +/- 0.5, 1100 +/- 100, 1.7 +/- 0.1; (c) 15.0 +/- 2.5, 64 +/- 1.4, 3.7 +/- 0.2; and (d) 36.0 +/- 6.5, 63 +/- 1.7, 3.7 +/- 0.1. CAM has the most dramatic effect, increasing the apparent Ca2+ affinity by a factor of 28, increasing the Hill coefficient 2.0 units to a value approaching 4 and increasing the Vmax by a factor of 9 or 12. The effective Ca2+ concentration (EC50) for the Ca2+-induced activation of the enzyme in the presence of 5 microM calmodulin is close to the Km for Ca2+ for the CAM-activated state (64 nM). Activation by cAMP protein kinase C-subunit had only minor effects on the Km and Hill coefficient, but increased the Vmax of both the unactivated and the CAM-activated forms of the pump by factor of 1.8 and 2.4, respectively. Analysis suggests that CAM activation is the result of direct binding of Ca2-CAM or high complexes, conferring higher Ca2+ affinity to the enzyme. Analysis suggests that regulatory phosphorylation (cAMP protein kinase C-subunit) increases the rates of processes subsequent to or distinct from Ca2+ binding. The CAM-activated form of the pump was further characterized. Unexpectedly, this form of the enzyme is stimulated a factor of 1.9 by ADP, with half-maximal stimulation between 0.4 and 0.7 mM. Analysis of the progress curves for uptake show that the CAM-activated enzyme is highly resistant to inhibition by transported Ca2+, with an IC50 of 32 mM. The implications of these findings for the pump mechanism and for its role in the regulation of cardiac contractility are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1488156501,"Intestinal brush border enzyme glycoproteins are transported to the microvillar membrane at different rates in the differentiated intestinal cell line Caco-2. This asynchronism is due to at least two rate-limiting events, a pre- and an intra-Golgi step (Stieger B., Matter, K., Baur, B., Bucher, K., Hochli, M., and Hauri, H.P. (1988) J. Cell Biol. 106, 1853-1861). A possible cause for the asynchronous protein transport might be differential trimming of N-linked oligosaccharide side chains. The effects of two trimming inhibitors on the intracellular transport of sucrase-isomaltase, a slowly migrating hydrolase, and dipeptidylpeptidase IV, a rapidly migrating hydrolase, are described. 1-Deoxymannojirimycin, an inhibitor of Golgi alpha-mannosidase I, had no influence on the rate of appearance of these hydrolases in the brush border membrane as assessed by subcellular fractionation. In the presence of N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of glucosidase I, 30-40% of the newly synthesized molecules appeared at the cell surface, and half-time for appearance of this pool was identical to that found in control cells. The reduced maximal transport to the cell surface observed with N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin may suggest that proper glycosylation is necessary for an efficient transport from the Golgi apparatus to the microvillar membrane. Inhibition of glucosidase I does not prevent the acquisition of endoglycosidase H resistance. Furthermore, evidence is presented that the processing in the presence of N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin leads to glycosylated endoglycosidase H-resistant glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1600351903,"Abstract 35S-Labeled proteoglycans produced by chondrocytes from immature and mature rabbits were fractionated on associative CsCl gradients. In all cultures, greater than 85% of the incorporated radioactivity was present in the A1 fraction (rho 1.60) as chondroitin sulfate/keratin sulfate-substituted aggregating proteoglycan monomer; the remainder was present in small proteoglycans in the A2, A3, and A4 fractions of low buoyant densities (rho 1.53, 1.45, 1.37, respectively). Detailed glycosaminoglycan analysis of the A2, A3, and A4 fractions showed dermatan sulfate-rich species were present throughout. However, in both immature and mature cultures, 30-45% of the glycosaminoglycans in the A3/A4 combined fractions were present as keratan sulfate, as shown by insensitivity to digestion with chondroitinase ABC, specific digestion with endo-beta-galactosidase, and reactivity with antibody 5D4. Immature and mature chondrocytes synthesized very similar amounts of the low buoyant density keratan sulfate proteoglycan on a per cell basis. Moreover, 51 and 37% of the total keratan sulfate produced by immature and mature chondrocytes, respectively, were present in the low buoyant density proteoglycan. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that the low buoyant density keratan sulfate was not derived from the large aggregating proteoglycan by proteolysis in the extracellular space. The small keratan sulfate proteoglycans appear to be present as a species distinct from the small dermatan sulfate proteoglycans in these cultures in that they can be separated on Q-Sepharose chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The apparent size (40-60 kDa), composition, and heterogeneity of the keratan sulfate proteoglycans suggest that they may be related to the small keratan sulfate proteoglycans of cornea."
https://openalex.org/W1535090358,"Abstract The membrane-bound detergent-activated ATPase from Halobacterium saccharovorum was purified at a physiological salt concentration (4 M NaCl) in the presence of nonionic detergents. The preparation contains putative subunits of 110, 71, 31, 22, and 14 kDa. The enzyme activity required high salt concentration but was not dependent on any one specific monovalent cation or any anion. The hydrolysis of ATP was nonlinear with time; the data are consistent with a kinetic model where the enzyme is irreversibly converted from an initial into a final stable form during the first few minutes of the reaction. The model thus contains a rate constant (k) for the transition and hydrolytic rates, v1 and v2, for the two forms of the enzyme. We found that this hysteretic behavior was influenced differently by various conditions and inhibitors. The constant k was smaller with Mn2+ than with Mg2+ as the divalent cation, showed negative temperature dependence, and a distinct pH optimum between 7.5 and 8.5. Thiols decreased k, but nitrate, a specific inhibitor of archaebacterial ATPases, increased it. ADP showed competitive inhibition against both the initial and the final form of the enzyme. Nitrate reversibly inhibited only the latter and in a manner dependent on whether Mn2+ or Mg2+ was used. The kinetic data suggest that all agents tested, with effects on the hydrolytic activity, seem to act at or near the catalytic site of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1524757395,"Abstract The addition of 200 pM monoiodinated human atrial natriuretic factor-(99-126) (125I-hANF) to cultured bovine aortic smooth muscle cells at 37 degrees C resulted in a rapid clearance from the medium (t1/2 approximately 7.5 min). Within 5 min, [125I]iodotyrosine126 (125I-Y), Arg125-[125I]iodotyrosine126 (125I-RY) and Phe124-Arg-[125]iodotyrosine126 (125I-FRY) appeared in the medium. The identities of these degradation products were confirmed by 1) retention time on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) relative to standards, 2) products generated by digestion with aminopeptidase M, and 3) the absence of the Met110. Preincubation of the cells with ammonium chloride or chloroquine resulted in a significant increase in the intracellular accumulation of radiolabel, indicative of endocytosis and rapid delivery of 125I-hANF to an acidic intracellular compartment (endosome and/or lysosome). Neither ammonium chloride, chloroquine, nor excess unlabeled hANF blocked the rapid appearance in the medium of 125I-RY or 125I-FRY. Bestatin inhibited the generation of 125I-RY, with a concomitant increase in 125I-FRY, suggesting that the 125I-RY is produced by aminopeptidase action on 125I-FRY. The endopeptidase 24.11 (enkephalinase) inhibitor, SCH 39370, did not inhibit the formation of 125I-FRY. These results provide evidence of a peptidase capable of specifically removing the COOH-terminal tripeptide from 125I-hANF. The COOH-terminal tripeptide, Phe124-Arg-Tyr126, was also isolated from cell digests of hANF by HPLC and its identity confirmed by amino acid analysis. Since it is generally believed that the COOH-terminal tripeptide is critical to many of atrial natriuretic factor-(99-126)'s bioactivities, this enzyme may be involved in the inactivation of atrial natriuretic factor-(99-126) in target tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2165134071,"Expression of the bacteriophage Mu mom gene is subject to posttranscriptional regulation by the phage com gene product. We have used mom-lacZ translational fusion genes to define the sequence requirements for stimulation of mom expression by Com. We show that the mom translation initiation region (TIR) is inactive in the absence of Com. We suggest that this repressed state is due to mRNA secondary structure in the TIR, since a deletion that destabilizes a stem-loop structure in the TIR results in high levels of Com-independent translation. We identify sequences on the mRNA, adjacent to the stem and loop, that are required for stimulation by Com. We propose that Com acts to stimulate initiation of translation by relieving the structural repression of the mom TIR. Indirect evidence is presented suggesting that Com binds to a site in the TIR."
https://openalex.org/W1482352151,"Abstract Exposure of growing cultures of hepatoma cells in vitro to the lipid-soluble dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors metoprine (36 nM) or trimetrexate (2 nM) at subtoxic concentrations causes little change in cell growth rate, colony forming ability, cell cycle distribution, and de novo purine and thymidylate biosynthesis. The reductase inhibitors augment the cytotoxic activity of the thymidylate synthase inhibitor, 10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolate by nearly 10-fold under optimal conditions. Treatment of the hepatoma cells with the reductase inhibitors for 72 h during growth caused approximately a 75% reduction in total cellular folates and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (primarily as polyglutamates) the substrate for thymidylate synthase. The reductase inhibitors also cause a doubling in the accumulation of 10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolate polyglutamates. The combined antifolate treatment (metoprine or trimetrexate plus 10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolate) expands the dUMP pool by 30-fold, which is more than the sum of either of the antifolates alone. Consequently, it is postulated that the enhanced activity of 10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolate in combination with low concentrations of dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors is due to an increase in the ratio of inhibitor to substrate for thymidylate synthase of nearly 10-fold and an extensive enhancement of the dUMP pool. These conditions predispose the target enzyme and the cells to more effective metabolic blockade by 10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolate which is presumably caused by the formation of an inhibited 10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolate[polyglutamate]-thymidylate synthase-dUMP ternary complex."
https://openalex.org/W1511125241,"Abstract The purified (Na+ + Mg2+)-ATPase from Acholeplasma laidlawii B membranes was successfully reconstituted with a number of different phospho- and glycolipids, and the ability of these lipids to support the function of this enzyme was evaluated by their ability to increase the specific activity of the purified enzyme and by their ability to restore its lipid-phase state-dependent properties which were lost during purification. The incorporation of this ATPase into liposomes composed of the endogenous membrane lipids of the organism, or of zwitterionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine, results in a full reconstitution of its activity and its lipid-phase state-dependent properties. In contrast, anionic phospholipids alone, or in combination with zwitterionic phospholipids at concentrations higher than 10 mol % of the anionic phospholipid, cause an irreversible inhibition of this ATPase. However, when combined with neutral glycolipids, larger amounts of anionic phospholipid can be tolerated without enzyme inhibition. Phosphatidylcholines with acyl chains of 14-24 linear carbon atoms and varying degrees of branching and unsaturation successfully reconstitute the enzyme, in marked contrast to the shorter chain homologues, which were ineffective. Our results indicate that the full expression of the activity of the A. laidlawii B ATPase requires a host lipid bilayer membrane of low to moderate negative surface charge which is predominantly liquid-crystalline and of a minimal bilayer thickness. Once such requirements are met, the enzyme exhibits considerable flexibility regarding the nature of the lipids which can effectively support its function. In particular, the activity of the A. laidlawii B ATPase is not very sensitive to lipid fluidity in the liquid-crystalline state."
https://openalex.org/W1527178832,"Abstract Glycoproteins synthesized by the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum have been shown to contain asparagine-linked high-mannose oligosaccharides which have an N-acetylglucosamine group in a novel intersecting position (attached beta 1-4 to the mannose linked alpha 1-6 to the core mannose). We have used crude membrane preparations from vegetative D. discoideum (strain M4) to characterize the enzyme activity responsible for catalyzing the transfer of GlcNAc to the intersecting position of high-mannose oligosaccharides. UDP-GlcNAc:oligosaccharide beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity in these preparations attaches GlcNAc to the mannose residue-linked alpha 1-6 to the beta-linked core mannose of the following Man9GlcNAc oligosaccharide as shown by the arrow. (formula; see text) It will also attach GlcNAc to the same intersecting position and/or to the bisecting position (beta-linked core mannose) of the following Man5GlcNAc oligosaccharide. (formula; see text) An analysis of the pH profiles, effects of heat denaturation, and substrate inhibitions on the addition of GlcNAc to either the intersecting or bisecting position of this Man5GlcNAc oligosaccharide indicates that a single enzyme activity is responsible for transferring GlcNAc to both positions. Various oligosaccharides were assayed to determine the substrate specificity of the transferase activity. These data indicate that both the mannose-attached alpha 1-3 and the mannose-attached alpha 1-6 to the mannose receiving the GlcNAc play a critical role in substrate suitability; absence of the alpha 1-6 mannose results in at least a 90% decrease in activity, while absence of the alpha 1-3 mannose results in a completely inactive substrate. This suggests that the minimal substrate is the disaccharide Man alpha 1-3Man."
https://openalex.org/W1499210329,"Two binding sites for EivF, a factor involved in transcription from the adenovirus early promoter iv (Eiv), were mapped within the adenovirus inverted terminal repeats (ITR). Consistent with the observation that EivF was required to initiate transcription from the Eiv promoter and with the demonstration that two EivF binding sites were present in the ITR, we show that the inverted terminal repeat region was able to promote transcription from the CAP site of the Eiv promoter in vitro and in an Ela-dependent fashion in vivo. The minimum sequence within the ITR capable of directing Ela-dependent transcription consists of forty nine nucleotides comprising two EivF binding sites and at least one Sp1 binding site. This 49-base pair fragment possesses the characteristics of an ezhancer which is induced by Ela. The enhancer is active in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Transcription directed by the ITR required EivF and the general transcription factors. The addition of purified Sp1 factor specifically stimulated transcription which correlates with the presence of Sp1 binding sites between the two EivF recognition sites."
https://openalex.org/W1580690052,"Abstract Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) of rat liver are associated with the plasma membrane in a hydrophobic intrinsic and a hydrophilic extrinsic form. We were interested in determining whether or not these two forms could be detected in the Golgi apparatus, the subcellular site of addition of oligosaccharides and sulfate to HSPG. In vivo and in vitro radiolabeled HSPG from rat liver Golgi apparatus membranes could only be solubilized with detergents that disrupt the membrane lipid bilayer, suggesting that they are solely associated via hydrophobic interactions. Both forms of HSPG were detected in plasma membranes of rat liver and isolated rat hepatocytes. The detergent-solubilized HSPG bound to octyl-Sepharose columns, whereas the hydrophilic form did not; this latter form, however, was released from the membrane by heparin. The hydrophobic anchor of HSPG in the Golgi and plasma membranes was insensitive to treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C under conditions in which alkaline phosphatase was sensitive; this suggests that the hydrophobic anchor of HSPG is the core protein itself. Preliminary experiments suggest that the subcellular site of processing of the hydrophobic to the hydrophilic form of HSPG is the plasma membrane. A specific processing activity, probably a protease of the plasma membrane not present in serum or the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, converted hydrophobic HSPG of the Golgi membrane to the hydrophilic form. In addition, pulse-chase experiments with [35S]Na2SO4 in rats demonstrated that at short times, the bulk of the radiolabeled cellular HSPG was in the Golgi apparatus; later on, the bulk of the radioactivity was found in the plasma membrane, the only subcellular site where the hydrophilic form of HSPG was detected."

Four of these side chains are on the surface of the N-terminal domain and probably contact the antibody directly. These contact positions were then mutagenized individually, and the antibody binding phenotypes of a large number of singly mutant repressors were determined.
