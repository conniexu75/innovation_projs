https://openalex.org/W2171665531,The philosophy of the storage of high-grade radioactive wastes in salt seems to be based on the assumption that the salt glaciers of Iran are no longer moving. Monitoring the movements of markers painted onto one of the salt glaciers suggests that the glacier deforms elastically as a result of temperature changes most of the time but flows plastically when it is sufficiently wet during each annual rainy season.

https://openalex.org/W2046051183,Inversion of the measurements obtained by the infrared limb scanner on the Nimbus 6 satellite has demonstrated that the stratospheric and mesospheric temperatures and ozone concentrations may be obtained remotely from space with accuracy and precision comparable to in situ methods. Such global data have many applications in middle atmospheric research and operational temperature sounding.

The argon abundance is estimated at 67 parts per million and that of carbon monoxide at 20 parts per million. At this time, no estimates for the oxygen abundance can be made."

https://openalex.org/W1986972640,"Long range acoustic thermometry, temperature measurements of entire oceans using pulses of sound, has been a long time coming. This technique was expected to provide solid data on global warming, but the technique has raised concerns about threats to marine mammals from the powerful sound. However smaller tests in the Arctic and Pacific oceans have gone ahead and show early evidence that the measurable ocean warming is occuring. This article discusses both the technique and the early results from limited experiments."
