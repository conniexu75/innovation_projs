The craton has a root composed in large part of peridotites that are strongly depleted in basaltic components. The asthenosphere boundary shelves from depths of 170 to 190 kilometers beneath the craton to approximately 140 kilometers beneath the mobile belts bordering the craton on the south and west. The root formed earlier than 3 billion years ago, and at that time ambient temperatures in it were 900 degrees to 1200 degrees C; these temperatures are near those estimated from data for xenoliths erupted in the Late Cretaceous or from present-day heat-flow measurements. Many of the diamonds in southern Africa are believed to have crystallized in this root in Archean time and were xenocrysts in the kimberlites that brought them to the surface."

The women to men ratio of money income almost doubled, but women had less leisure while men had more, an increase in the proportion of adults not married made more women dependent on their own income, and women's share of financial responsibility for children rose. The net result for women's access to goods, services, and leisure in comparison with that of men ranged from a decrease of 15 percent to an increase of 4 percent, depending on assumptions about income sharing within households."

These epibranchial organs are lined by an epithelium rich in taste buds. Both the taste buds and the muscles of the epibranchial organs are innervated by components of the vagal nerve. Horseradish peroxidase neuronal tracing experiments show that these nerve fibers are connected centrally to an enormous epibranchial portion of the vagal lobes-a special visceral sensory and motor region of the medulla. The epibranchial portion of the vagal lobe is among the most remarkable structures found in the brains of vertebrates, for it is itself a spiral."

Subsequent outgassing over a wide temperature range results in the production of water vapor formed from the chemisorbed hydrogen and oxygen from the lunar sample; the proposed mechanism has been confirmed in terms of the chemisorption of deuterium and the release of heavy water. Since the conditions of the experiments are consistent with those on the lunar surface, it is postulated that water vapor will be produced on the moon through the interaction of the solar wind with lunar soil. It is also proposed that such a process could play an important role in the early history of many planets where an oxygen-rich soil is exposed to a reducing atmosphere."

Good contrast is most consistently obtained by viewing in azimuth directions toward or away from the sun. Contrast is enhanced by imaging selected polarization components and by taking the difference between orthogonal polarization components."

He says that punctuated equilibri- um is a slogan. Slogans arc tools of rhetoric; they generate polemic and propaganda, not real work. The test of a good scientific theory is its utility in fostering fruitful em- pirical research. I have the, perhaps naive, faith that my colleagues in paleontology know the diJfcr- encc between science and propaganda. They have tested the theory of punctuated equi- librium, obtaining volumnious and rigorous results both pro and con. The relative fre- quency of punctuated equilibrium ditfers across taxa and environments, a basic result with broad and unexplored consequences for evolutionary theory. Punctuated equilibrium has also been fruitful in focusing attention to C\vo vital domains in our quest for a more compre- hensive evolutionary theory: the meaning of stasis and the importance of selection upon units larger than conventional Darwinian organisms (1). But my pleasure in the utility of puncruated equilibrium centers firmly upon its role in fostering (for its test) a decade of direct and careful work on rates and patterns of evolution in fossil lineages Lcvinton, who began his career as a pale- ontologist, might care to have a look back. We arc a magnanimous lot, and gladly greet our prodigal sons. of accountability, were petrified. The people who conferred meaning on objects must have lived long ago, no one having come along since with any changes to make. Clas- sifications are clearly labeled and immobile. Then, and only then, might one allocate dangers according to those that are active and voluntary and, therefore, acceptable, or passive and involuntary and, therefore, properly subject to governmental regulation or prohibition. Once social change enters the picture, however, the active-passive dis- tinctions become movable boundaries, con- stantly redrawn by social interaction. We now see that people on the left con- sider the dangers stenuning from technolo- gy (nuclear power or chemical carcinogens) as passive, while they perceive the dangers stemming from casual contact with those suJfering from acquired inunune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) as active. At the same time, people on the right view the dangers of technology as actively chosen, a price worth paying for the benefits of progress, while they view the carriers of AIDS as bringing plague upon people who are made their passive victims. Which of these dangers is voluntary? To say a danger is voluntary is tantamount to saying it is acceptable; invol- untary dangers, imposed on passive people, by contrast, are unacceptable. Classification and decision are one and the same. ff only the anger against instin1tions were compre- hensive enough, suicides would be owed redress by the implacable instirutions that drove them to their undeserved and invol- untary end. Just as we-the-people are the ones who confer meaning on these distinc- tions, so we arc also the ones who change these meanings.

Overhead Costs on Research Grants Defining Risk In i1is letter of 21 February (p. 783), Charle~ Perrow seeks to distinguish between active and passive risks, active risk being more voluntary and controllable by the indi- vidual and passive risk less voluntary and perhaps uncontrollable. This distinction is important because it is often made in justify- ing why certain risks are more and other risks less acceptable. But the distinction is misleading. One might imagine a static so- cial system whose values, including its rules 25 APRIL 1986 As a scientist who depends on research grants, I welcome the news that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) plans to cut overhead (News & Conuncnt, 7 Mar., p. 1059) because tl1is long overdue action will make more money available for research. I have always found it difficult to accept the claim that overhead reimburses academic instirutions for costs associated with re- search. Universities require faculty members to carry out research and secure grants. In fact, promotions often depend not only on publication and teaching but also on the number of grants and their dollar value. To put it simply, faculty members obtain grants because they are required, or at least strong- ly encouraged, to do so by universities that also claim this influx of funds generates costs they seek to recover through overhead. In other words, universities charge the grant- ing agencies and their own faculty for bring- ing in money. An analogy would be an industry that requires its workers to provide their own ideas, products, tools, raw materi- als, capital, and all otl1er resources and then imposes a tax on these items. The fact that the overhead varies from 30 percent to 100 percent is an indication that some universities (i) are more inefficient than others or (ii) have employed more eJfective negotiators, or both. Further, a large proportion of the overhead collected by universities is wasted by inefficient bu- reaucracies that hinder rather than assist the very faculty that generate these funds. Therefore I think a reduction of tl1e over- head rate will benefit research by reducing university bureaucracies. Administrators whose inflated salaries depend on these bu- reaucracies and the overhead will, of course, fight the cuts and try to find other ways to collect as much or more money by other means. Possibilities that come to mind are new or increased charges for library use, interlibrary loan assistance, typing of manu- scripts, custodial services, bookkeeping, electricity, water, and even rental of bench space. To prevent this from happening OMB should not only reduce overhead to 20 percent or less, but also prohibit charges that would allow university administrators to collect overhead under other guises. OMB can increase savings and put even more money into direct costs by requiring that prices of university services and store- house items that may be charged to grants be equal to or lower than tl1ose charged by private contractors. As matters stand now, prices for services and supplies provided in- housc by universities are higher than on the outside. Last but not least, OMB and the granting agencies should require that the final approval of in-house costs be the sole prerogative of the principal investigator. Such a move would reduce costs and en- courage university administrations to be more responsive to faculty needs.

https://openalex.org/W4241720734,"A direct sense of alarm for the future of the National Institutes of Health is evident in the farewell speech of former director Robert Q. Marston. Associates of Marston, who was abruptly dismissed this January, say he was told by the White House that the decision was for neither personal nor institutional reasons. Others have suggested that Marston was dismissed simply because he was appointed by a Democratic Administration. However this may be, Marston's valedictory, delivered on 27 April, is concerned not about his own situation, but that of the NIH."
