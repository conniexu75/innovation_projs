https://openalex.org/W2964722401,"A global priority for the behavioural sciences is to develop cost-effective, scalable interventions that could improve the academic outcomes of adolescents at a population level, but no such interventions have so far been evaluated in a population-generalizable sample. Here we show that a short (less than one hour), online growth mindset intervention-which teaches that intellectual abilities can be developed-improved grades among lower-achieving students and increased overall enrolment to advanced mathematics courses in a nationally representative sample of students in secondary education in the United States. Notably, the study identified school contexts that sustained the effects of the growth mindset intervention: the intervention changed grades when peer norms aligned with the messages of the intervention. Confidence in the conclusions of this study comes from independent data collection and processing, pre-registration of analyses, and corroboration of results by a blinded Bayesian analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2966567728,"The synthesis of pre-mRNA by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) involves the formation of a transcription initiation complex, and a transition to an elongation complex1-4. The large subunit of Pol II contains an intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain that is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases during the transition from initiation to elongation, thus influencing the interaction of the C-terminal domain with different components of the initiation or the RNA-splicing apparatus5,6. Recent observations suggest that this model provides only a partial picture of the effects of phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain7-12. Both the transcription-initiation machinery and the splicing machinery can form phase-separated condensates that contain large numbers of component molecules: hundreds of molecules of Pol II and mediator are concentrated in condensates at super-enhancers7,8, and large numbers of splicing factors are concentrated in nuclear speckles, some of which occur at highly active transcription sites9-12. Here we investigate whether the phosphorylation of the Pol II C-terminal domain regulates the incorporation of Pol II into phase-separated condensates that are associated with transcription initiation and splicing. We find that the hypophosphorylated C-terminal domain of Pol II is incorporated into mediator condensates and that phosphorylation by regulatory cyclin-dependent kinases reduces this incorporation. We also find that the hyperphosphorylated C-terminal domain is preferentially incorporated into condensates that are formed by splicing factors. These results suggest that phosphorylation of the Pol II C-terminal domain drives an exchange from condensates that are involved in transcription initiation to those that are involved in RNA processing, and implicates phosphorylation as a mechanism that regulates condensate preference."
https://openalex.org/W2964834213,"Macrophages are considered to contribute to chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis1. However, both the exact origin and the role of macrophages in inflammatory joint disease remain unclear. Here we use fate-mapping approaches in conjunction with three-dimensional light-sheet fluorescence microscopy and single-cell RNA sequencing to perform a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of the composition, origin and differentiation of subsets of macrophages within healthy and inflamed joints, and study the roles of these macrophages during arthritis. We find that dynamic membrane-like structures, consisting of a distinct population of CX3CR1+ tissue-resident macrophages, form an internal immunological barrier at the synovial lining and physically seclude the joint. These barrier-forming macrophages display features that are otherwise typical of epithelial cells, and maintain their numbers through a pool of locally proliferating CX3CR1- mononuclear cells that are embedded into the synovial tissue. Unlike recruited monocyte-derived macrophages, which actively contribute to joint inflammation, these epithelial-like CX3CR1+ lining macrophages restrict the inflammatory reaction by providing a tight-junction-mediated shield for intra-articular structures. Our data reveal an unexpected functional diversification among synovial macrophages and have important implications for the general role of macrophages in health and disease."

https://openalex.org/W2966073096,"Groundwater in sub-Saharan Africa supports livelihoods and poverty alleviation1,2, maintains vital ecosystems, and strongly influences terrestrial water and energy budgets3. Yet the hydrological processes that govern groundwater recharge and sustainability—and their sensitivity to climatic variability—are poorly constrained4,5. Given the absence of firm observational constraints, it remains to be seen whether model-based projections of decreased water resources in dry parts of the region4 are justified. Here we show, through analysis of multidecadal groundwater hydrographs across sub-Saharan Africa, that levels of aridity dictate the predominant recharge processes, whereas local hydrogeology influences the type and sensitivity of precipitation–recharge relationships. Recharge in some humid locations varies by as little as five per cent (by coefficient of variation) across a wide range of annual precipitation values. Other regions, by contrast, show roughly linear precipitation–recharge relationships, with precipitation thresholds (of roughly ten millimetres or less per day) governing the initiation of recharge. These thresholds tend to rise as aridity increases, and recharge in drylands is more episodic and increasingly dominated by focused recharge through losses from ephemeral overland flows. Extreme annual recharge is commonly associated with intense rainfall and flooding events, themselves often driven by large-scale climate controls. Intense precipitation, even during years of lower overall precipitation, produces some of the largest years of recharge in some dry subtropical locations. Our results therefore challenge the ‘high certainty’ consensus regarding decreasing water resources4 in such regions of sub-Saharan Africa. The potential resilience of groundwater to climate variability in many areas that is revealed by these precipitation–recharge relationships is essential for informing reliable predictions of climate-change impacts and adaptation strategies. Analysis of multidecadal hydrograph and precipitation data for sub-Saharan Africa shows a complex relationship between groundwater recharge and precipitation, and that a drier climate does not necessarily mean less recharge."
https://openalex.org/W2964363227,"Our current knowledge of cosmic star-formation history during the first two billion years (corresponding to redshift z >3) is mainly based on galaxies identified in rest-frame ultraviolet light. However, this population of galaxies is known to under-represent the most massive galaxies, which have rich dust content and/or old stellar populations. This raises the questions of the true abundance of massive galaxies and the star-formation-rate density in the early universe. Although several massive galaxies that are invisible in the ultraviolet have recently been confirmed at early epochs, most of them are extreme starbursts with star-formation rates exceeding 1000 solar masses per year, suggesting that they are unlikely to represent the bulk population of massive galaxies. Here we report submillimeter (wavelength 870um) detections of 39 massive star-forming galaxies at z > 3, which are unseen in the spectral region from the deepest ultraviolet to the near-infrared. With a space density of about $2 \times 10^{-5}$ per cubic megaparsec (two orders of magnitudes higher than extreme starbursts) and star-formation rates of 200 solar masses per year, these galaxies represent the bulk population of massive galaxies that have been missed from previous surveys. They contribute a total star-formation-rate density ten times larger than that of equivalently massive ultraviolet-bright galaxies at z >3. Residing in the most massive dark matter halos at their redshifts, they are probably the progenitors of the largest present-day galaxies in massive groups and clusters. Such a high abundance of massive and dusty galaxies in the early universe challenges our understanding of massive-galaxy formation."

https://openalex.org/W2966549733,"Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is a model for multiple sclerosis. Here we show that induction generates successive waves of clonally expanded CD4+, CD8+ and γδ+ T cells in the blood and central nervous system, similar to gluten-challenge studies of patients with coeliac disease. We also find major expansions of CD8+ T cells in patients with multiple sclerosis. In autoimmune encephalomyelitis, we find that most expanded CD4+ T cells are specific for the inducing myelin peptide MOG35-55. By contrast, surrogate peptides derived from a yeast peptide major histocompatibility complex library of some of the clonally expanded CD8+ T cells inhibit disease by suppressing the proliferation of MOG-specific CD4+ T cells. These results suggest that the induction of autoreactive CD4+ T cells triggers an opposing mobilization of regulatory CD8+ T cells."

https://openalex.org/W2965076400,"The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), which anchors DNA loops that organize the genome into structural domains, has a central role in gene control by facilitating or constraining interactions between genes and their regulatory elements1,2. In cancer cells, the disruption of CTCF binding at specific loci by somatic mutation3,4 or DNA hypermethylation5 results in the loss of loop anchors and consequent activation of oncogenes. By contrast, the germ-cell-specific paralogue of CTCF, BORIS (brother of the regulator of imprinted sites, also known as CTCFL)6, is overexpressed in several cancers7–9, but its contributions to the malignant phenotype remain unclear. Here we show that aberrant upregulation of BORIS promotes chromatin interactions in ALK-mutated, MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma10 cells that develop resistance to ALK inhibition. These cells are reprogrammed to a distinct phenotypic state during the acquisition of resistance, a process defined by the initial loss of MYCN expression followed by subsequent overexpression of BORIS and a concomitant switch in cellular dependence from MYCN to BORIS. The resultant BORIS-regulated alterations in chromatin looping lead to the formation of super-enhancers that drive the ectopic expression of a subset of proneural transcription factors that ultimately define the resistance phenotype. These results identify a previously unrecognized role of BORIS—to promote regulatory chromatin interactions that support specific cancer phenotypes. The CTCF paralogue BORIS is upregulated in transcriptionally reprogrammed neuroblastoma cells rendered resistant to targeted therapy, in which it promotes regulatory chromatin interactions that maintain the resistance phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W2964845832,"Pancreatic cancer (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, PDAC) is aggressive and lethal. Although there is an urgent need for effective therapeutics in treating pancreatic cancer, none of the targeted therapies tested in clinical trials to date significantly improve its outcome. PORCN inhibitors show efficacy in preclinical models of Wnt-addicted cancers, including RNF43-mutant pancreatic cancers and have advanced to clinical trials. In this study, we aimed to develop drug combination strategies to further enhance the therapeutic efficacy of the PORCN inhibitor ETC-159. To identify additional druggable vulnerabilities in Wnt-driven pancreatic cancers, we performed an in vivo CRISPR loss-of-function screen. CTNNB1, KRAS, and MYC were reidentified as key oncogenic drivers. Notably, glucose metabolism pathway genes were important in vivo but less so in vitro. Knockout of multiple genes regulating PI3K/mTOR signaling impacted the growth of Wnt-driven pancreatic cancer cells in vivo. Importantly, multiple PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors in combination with ETC-159 synergistically suppressed the growth of multiple Wnt-addicted cancer cell lines in soft agar. Furthermore, the combination of the PORCN inhibitor ETC-159 and the pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 potently suppressed the in vivo growth of RNF43-mutant pancreatic cancer xenografts. This was largely due to enhanced suppressive effects on both cell proliferation and glucose metabolism. These findings demonstrate that dual PORCN and PI3K/mTOR inhibition is a potential strategy for treating Wnt-driven pancreatic cancers."

https://openalex.org/W2964938249,"Helicobacter pylori colonizes the human gastric mucosa, causing chronic inflammation, peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. A cascade of harmful processes results from the interaction of these bacteria with the gastric epithelium.To investigate these processes in terms of upregulation of oxidative stress and cell apoptosis and downregulation of the pro-regenerative activity of cells.We employed an in vivo guinea pig model at 7 or 28 days postinoculation with H. pylori, corresponding to an acute or chronic stage of infection, respectively, and an in vitro model of guinea pig primary gastric epithelial cells and fibroblasts treated with bacterial components: glycine acid extract (GE), urease subunit A (UreA), cytotoxin-associated gene A protein (CagA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cells were evaluated for metabolic activity (MTT reduction), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and metalloproteinase (MMP-9) secretion, lipid peroxidation (4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE)), migration (wound healing), proliferation (Ki-67 antigen) and cell apoptosis (TUNEL assay; Bcl-xL, Bax, Bcl-2 expression; caspase 3 cleavage).Significant infiltration of the gastric mucosa by inflammatory cells in vivo in response to H. pylori was accompanied by oxidative stress and cell apoptosis, which were more intense 7 than 28 days after inoculation. The increase in cell proliferation was more intense in chronic than acute infection. H. pylori components GE, CagA, UreA, and LPS upregulated oxidative stress and apoptosis. Only H. pylori LPS inhibited cell migration and proliferation, which was accompanied by the upregulation of MMP-9.H. pylori infection induces cell apoptosis in conjunction with increased oxidative stress. Elevated apoptosis protects against deleterious inflammation and neoplasia; however, it reduces cell integrity. Upregulation of cell migration and proliferation in response to injury in the milieu of GE, CagA or UreA facilitates tissue regeneration but increases the risk of neoplasia. By comparison, downregulation of cell regeneration by H. pylori LPS may promote chronic inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W2966877470,"Objectives This study investigates the protective role of ethnic-racial identity (ERI) affirmation on the longitudinal association between racism and Aboriginal Australian children’s social and emotional well-being (SEWB). Methods 408 children from the K-Cohort of the Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children were included in the analysis. Data were collected through questionnaire-guided interviews at 7–10 and 9–12 years of age. Children’s racism experience, SEWB (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), and confounding were reported by caregivers. ERI was reported by children and dichotomized into high versus low. Generalized linear models with log-Poisson links and robust errors were used to estimate adjusted Risk Ratios (RRa) for the effect of racism on SEWB domains. Effect-measure modification analysis was used to verify differences on effect sizes per strata of ERI affirmation. The presence of modification was indicated by the Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction (RERI). Results Slightly above half (51.4%) of the children presented high ERI affirmation. Children exposed to racism and with low ERI affirmation were at increased risk of hyperactive behavior (RRa 2.53, 95% CI 1.17, 5.48), conduct problems (RRa 2.35, 95% CI 1.07, 5.15), and total difficulties (RRa 1.73, 95% CI 0.84, 3.55). Positive RERIs indicated the joint effects of racism and low ERI affirmation surpassed the sum of their separate effects in these domains. Children with high ERI affirmation were at increased risk of peer problems (RRa 1.66, 95% CI 0.78, 3.52). Conclusions These findings suggest that ERI may mitigate the risk of poor SEWB due to racism. Fostering affirmative ERI can be an important strategy in promoting resilience in Aboriginal Australian children."
https://openalex.org/W2964770335,"We describe a new probainognathian cynodont, Pseudotherium argentinus, from the early Late Triassic Ischigualasto Formation of Argentina. Pseudotherium adds to a growing assemblage of small Triassic cynodonts that offers new insight into events leading up to the origin of crown Mammalia and the successively more inclusive Mammaliaformes and Mammaliamorpha. Using high-resolution X-ray computed tomography, we illustrate and describe the holotype and only known specimen, which consists of a well-preserved isolated skull. It preserves apomorphic features of the orbit and braincase. Prefrontal and vestigial postorbital bones are present, despite the absence of an ossified postorbital bar. As in Brasilitherium riograndensis, thin turbinal-like bones are present in the nasopharyngeal passage, and we discuss impediments to establishing their identity and function. Compared to more basal cynodonts, the cochlea is elongated but uncoiled and in this and other features it resembles basal mammaliamorphs. Our analysis found weak support for Pseudotherium as the sister taxon of Tritylodontidae. However, a broader assessment of its relationships in light of additional character data from the literature and unpublished computed tomography data suggest that it may be more realistic to view the relationships of Pseudotherium as an unresolved polytomy with tritylodontids, and the taxa referred to as tritheledontids and brasilodontids (groups of variable membership and questionable monophyly). Thus, Pseudotherium may lie just inside or just outside of Mammaliamorpha, and there is also weak character support for its sister taxon relationship with Brasilitherium. Our results amplify previous conclusions that phylogenetic relationships in this adaptive radiation of small cynodonts will remain somewhat uncertain until more complete specimens are recovered, and until high-resolution CT scans of existing specimens become available to the larger community. Toward that goal, we make the CT dataset for the holotype of Pseudotherium argentinus publically available under a Creative Commons license at www.DigiMorph.org."
https://openalex.org/W2966045533,"At the molecular level, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) necessitates extensive transcriptional reprogramming which is orchestrated by a small group of gene-regulatory factors that include the zinc-finger DNA-binding protein SNAIL1. Although SNAIL1 is a well-known master regulator of EMT, knowledge of its immediate target genes is incomplete. Here, we used ChIP-seq to identify genes directly regulated by SNAIL1 in colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. When comparing the genomic distribution of SNAIL1 to that of the intestinal stem cell (ISC) transcription factors ASCL2 and TCF7L2, we observed a significant overlap. Furthermore, SNAIL1 ChIP-seq peaks are associated with a substantial fraction of ISC signature genes. In two colorectal cancer cell lines, we verified that SNAIL1 decreases ISC marker expression. Likewise, SNAIL1 directly represses the proto-oncogene MYB, and the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) WiNTRLINC1, a recently described regulator of ASCL2. SNAIL1 targets multiple regulatory elements at the MYB and WiNTRLINC1 loci, and displaces ASCL2 and TCF7L2 from their binding regions at a MYB downstream regulatory element. Correlation analyses and expression profiling showed antiparallel expression of SNAIL1 and MYB in colorectal and breast cancer cell lines and tumor transcriptomes, suggesting that SNAIL1 controls MYB expression in different tissues. MYB loss-of-function attenuated proliferation and impaired clonogenicity in two- and three-dimensional cell cultures. Therefore, SNAIL1-mediated downregulation of MYB and ISC markers like WiNTRLINC1 likely contributes to the decrease in proliferation known to be associated with EMT, while simultaneously abrogating stemness features of colorectal cancer cells. Apparently, the relationship between EMT and stemness varies in different tumor entities."
https://openalex.org/W2964538150,"Biological materials such as chiton tooth, squid beak, and byssal threads of bivalves have inspired the development of new technologies. To this end, we have characterized the acellular components in the buccal mass of the terrestrial slug Ariolimax californicus (banana slug). These components are the radula, the jaw, and the odontophore. In the radula, calcium-rich denticles are tightly interlocked one to the other on top of a nanofibrous chitin membrane. The jaw has a nanostructured morphology made of chitin to achieve compression resistance and is directly linked to the foregut cuticle, which has a protective nanofibrous structure. Finally, in the odontophore, we observed a structurally elastic microstructure that interfaces soft tissues with a highly stressed radula membrane. Based on those observations, we discuss the interaction between these components and highlight how the materials in these task-specific components have evolved. This structure-properties-function study of the A. californicus’ buccal mass may aid in the design and fabrication of novel bioinspired materials."

Procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2 (PLOD2) encodes the only lysyl hydroxylase (LH) isoform that specifically hydroxylates lysine residues in collagen telopeptides, a post-translational modification required for the formation of stabilized cross-links. PLOD2 expression is induced by hypoxia and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), well-known stimuli for the formation of a fibrotic ECM, which can lead to pathological fibrosis underlying several diseases. Here, using human and murine fibroblasts, we studied the molecular determinants underlying hypoxia– and TGF-β1–induced PLOD2 expression and its impact on collagen biosynthesis. Deletion mapping and mutagenesis analysis identified specific binding sites for hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) and TGF-β1–activated SMAD proteins on the human PLOD2 gene promoter that were required for these stimuli to induce PLOD2 expression. Interestingly, our experiments also revealed that HIF signaling plays a preponderant role in the SMAD pathway, as intact HIF sites were absolutely required for TGF-β1 to exert its effect on SMAD-binding sites. We also found that silencing PLOD2 expression did not alter soluble collagen accumulation in the extracellular medium, but it effectively abolished the deposition into the insoluble collagen matrix. Taken together, our findings reveal the existence of a hierarchical relationship between the HIF and SMAD signaling pathways for hypoxia– and TGF-β1–mediated regulation of PLOD2 expression, a key event in the deposition of collagen into the ECM.

Fibrillar collagens form homotrimeric (three identical α-chains) or heterotrimeric (two or three distinct polypeptide chains) molecules, each α-chain consisting of a major uninterrupted triple-helical or collagenous domain characterized by repeating sequences (GXY), flanked by noncollagenous domains at N and C termini (2Fratzl P.

These reactions, which occur before the formation of the triple helix, are catalyzed by prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases, enzymes that reside in the endoplasmic reticulum and require Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, O2, and ascorbate for their activity. In contrast to proline hydroxylation, described to be invariable among several types of collagen in different tissues, the extent of lysyl hydroxylation can vary significantly, depending on the collagen form, the domain where it takes place, the tissue considered, and even the pathophysiological conditions (5Yamauchi M.

This variable behavior actually comes from the fact that different enzymatic systems contribute to this post-translational modification. Three isoforms of lysyl hydroxylases (LH; EC 1.14.11.4), also known as procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase (PLOD), have been described in vertebrates: LH1, LH2, and LH3, encoded by PLOD1, PLOD2, and PLOD3 genes, respectively (6Valtavaara M.

Lysine and hydroxylysines in collagen telopeptides are substrates for lysyl oxidase, and the resulting aldehydes react with helical lysine or hydroxylysine residues to form covalent cross-links (16Pornprasertsuk S.

In fact, the biological significance of telopeptide hydroxylation is fundamental, as it impacts the mechanical properties of the collagen network (18Chen Y. Terajima M. Yang Y. Sun L. Ahn Y.-H.

When the use of hydroxylysine over lysine is favored, instead of following the allysine pathway, cross-linking proceeds through the hydroxyallysine route, resulting in enhanced levels of pyridinoline cross-links and, thereby, in a stiffer collagen matrix (19van der Slot A.J.

Strong evidence indicates that LH2 (PLOD2) is the only form determining the formation of stabilized cross-links, as exemplified by Bruck syndrome type 2, a heritable disorder in the osteogenesis imperfecta spectrum caused by mutations in the PLOD2 gene and characterized by severe reduction or elimination of the telopeptide hydroxylysine-derived cross-links, resulting in bone fragility (9van der Slot A.J.

Therefore, it is important to delineate the signaling pathway(s) regulating the expression of PLOD2 as a way to understand the molecular mechanisms contributing to tissue stiffness. PLOD2 expression has been described to be strongly regulated by transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and hypoxia, known stimuli for the synthesis and deposition of a fibrotic ECM (20Gilkes D.M.

In this study, we analyzed the molecular determinants for the induction of PLOD2 by hypoxia and TGF-β1 in fibroblasts as well as its impact on their capacity to promote collagen synthesis and deposition. Our experiments identified specific binding sites for hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) and TGF-β–activated SMAD family members on the promoter sequence of the human PLOD2 gene. Mutation analyses and transcription factor overexpression assays further showed that HIF proteins play a preponderant role in the induction of PLOD2 expression, the action of these factors on their binding site being an essential requirement for TGF-β1 to exert its effect on the SMAD-dependent sites. Finally, we demonstrate that the expression of PLOD2 is fundamental for hypoxia and TGF-β1 to promote the deposition of collagen onto the insoluble collagen matrix, our findings providing novel knowledge to understand the mechanisms leading to pathological fibrosis. The effect of lowering oxygen levels (hypoxia) and the stimulation with TGF-β1 on PLOD2 expression was investigated in human lung fibroblast (CCD19-Lu) cells. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), hypoxia caused an up-regulation in PLOD2 mRNA and protein levels, and this action was further increased by incubation with TGF-β1. As these human fibroblasts are difficult to transfect, we analyzed the mechanism by which hypoxia and TGF-β1 induce PLOD2 expression in 3T3 mouse embryo fibroblasts. An upstream regulatory sequence (−1826/+174) of the human PLOD2 gene was cloned in front of a luciferase gene to study whether the effect of hypoxia and TGF-β1 occurs at the transcriptional level (Fig. S1). Transient transfection of fibroblasts showed that the activity of this promoter fragment recapitulated the behavior of the mRNA and protein (i.e. it was up-regulated by the individual stimuli and further increased when applied together) (Fig. 1C). These experiments indicate that their action occurs at the transcriptional level and that the promoter sequence contains the necessary information to mediate the activation of the gene. To identify hypoxia– and TGF-β1–responsive elements within the PLOD2 promoter fragment, we screened the −1826/+174 bp promoter region for putative binding sites for HIF and SMAD proteins, both of which have been described to be important for the effect of these stimuli on gene expression (23Dunn L.K.

We then generated luciferase constructs under the control of 5′-deletional fragments based on the location of these potential sites. Looking at the effect of hypoxia, Fig. 2 shows that the activity of the −1826/+174 promoter fragment was kept roughly intact until a putative HIF site at −230/−226 was eliminated. For the effect of TGF-β1, a much more complex behavior was observed. Whereas a potentiation on basal and hypoxia-induced conditions was observed for the parental −1826 promoter fragment, the effect on basal activity lost significance in constructs of −1260, −626, and −346, whereas it was still evident under hypoxic conditions. Deletions up to −296 and further downstream were irresponsive to TGF-β1. Taken together, these results suggest the existence of a well-defined HIF site in the PLOD2 promoter, whereas they reveal a high complexity in the effect of TGF-β1, likely reflecting the action on multiple sites. Careful inspection of the putative HIF site indicates a perfect match with the HIF-binding CGTG (complementary strand CACG in the PLOD2 gene) motif commonly found in a number of hypoxia-responsive genes (25Schödel J. Oikonomopoulos S. Ragoussis J. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Mole D.R. High-resolution genome-wide mapping of HIF-binding sites by ChIP-seq.Blood. 2011; 117 (21447827): e207-e21710.1182/blood-2010-10-314427Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, a HIF ancillary sequence (HAS) of the form CACGC (GCGTG in the PLOD2 gene) was also identified. HAS motifs are often found between positions +13 and +15 with respect to the HIF sites and shown to regulate their response to hypoxia (26Kimura H. Weisz A. Ogura T. Hitomi Y. Kurashima Y. Hashimoto K. D'Acquisto F. Makuuchi M. Esumi H. Identification of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 ancillary sequence and its function in vascular endothelial growth factor gene induction by hypoxia and nitric oxide.J. Biol.

Multiple-sequence alignment analysis of this region among several mammalian orthologs of PLOD2 revealed that both HAS and HIF sites were evolutionarily conserved, suggesting functionality in these genomes. In fact, mutation of these sites in the context of the full promoter construct (−1826/+174) abolished the effect of hypoxia and the potentiation by TGF-β1 (Fig. 3B). To demonstrate the absolute requirement of intact HAS and HIF sites for hypoxia to induce PLOD2 promoter activity, constitutively active forms of HIF1 and HIF2 were cotransfected with the promoter constructs, and luciferase activity was analyzed by luminometry. As shown in Fig. 4, HIF1 and HIF2 overexpression caused a strong potentiation of the effect of hypoxia in the WT form, but not in the mutant constructs that behaved similarly to the deletion −226/+174. Again, the effect of TGF-β1 was abolished in these mutant constructs. These results indicate that both HAS and HIF elements are essential for the hypoxia response and mediate the action of HIF factors. Additionally, intact HIF elements seem to be also required for TGF-β1 to induce PLOD2 transcription.Figure 4Involvement of HIF factors in the effect of hypoxia and TGF-β1 on PLOD2 expression.

HIF1- and HIF2-dependent responses can be mounted in vitro with reporter gene assays that are not observed on endogenous target genes (29Hu C.-J. Sataur A. Wang L. Chen H. Simon M.C. The N-terminal transactivation domain confers target gene specificity of hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18 (17804822): 4528-454210.1091/mbc.e06-05-0419Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). To investigate the contribution of HIF1 and HIF2 on PLOD2 expression, we have generated stable transfectants of human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells overexpressing constitutively active forms of HIF1 and HIF2 (N-terminally HA-tagged) in a tetracycline-inducible manner. As shown in Fig. 5A, incubation of these cell clones with the tetracycline analog, doxycycline, induced the expression of these HIF forms, as assessed by Western blotting using an anti-HA antibody. Cell transfection with PLOD2 promoter-luciferase reporter and subsequent induction of HIF expression gave rise to significant increases in the luciferase activity, which were of a magnitude similar to those induced by hypoxia in untransfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 5B). Therefore, as observed in fibroblasts, HIF1- and HIF2-driven responses on PLOD2 expression can be recapitulated using reporter gene assays in these cells. Interestingly, HIF1 and HIF2 also induced the endogenous expression of PLOD2 mRNA and protein (Fig. 5, C and D). Again, these actions, which were found to be higher with HIF2 than with HIF1, were in the same range of those observed upon hypoxic incubation of untransfected HEK293 cells. Additionally, we have performed knockdown experiments to determine the contribution of HIF1 and HIF2 forms to the effect of hypoxia on PLOD2 expression in fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 6A, cell transfection with human specific siRNA for HIF1 and HIF2 diminished the mRNA levels of its corresponding HIF form, without significantly affecting the other. Under these conditions, HIF1 or HIF2 siRNA did not modify hypoxic induction of PLOD2 (Fig. 6B, left). As functional redundancy may be operating for the effect of both isoforms, we set additional experiments with a combination of HIF1/HIF2 siRNA. Using this approach, we observed a clear reduction of the capacity of hypoxia to induce the expression of PLOD2 (Fig. 6B, right). Taken together, our results indicate that both HIF1 and HIF2 are fully competent in activating the endogenous expression of PLOD2 and that both HIF forms play redundant roles in the induction of this gene in response to hypoxia.Figure 6siRNA-mediated down-regulation of HIF1 and HIF2 reduces PLOD2 expression induced by hypoxia in lung fibroblasts.

Numbers above the blot represent the signal ratio PLOD2/β-actin upon densitometric analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have also investigated whether HIF factors bind to the PLOD2 promoter. For this purpose, we have taken advantage of the HEK293 clone overexpressing HA-tagged HIF1 in ChIP experiments. As shown in Fig. 7A, incubation of HIF1 cell clone with doxycycline promoted the accumulation in both cytosolic and nuclear compartments of HA-tagged HIF1 protein. Fig. 7B also shows that nuclear HIF1 can be efficiently immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody, a requisite for its performance in ChIP assays. Using a primer pair targeting a PLOD2 genomic sequence adjacent to the HIF-binding site, a significant enrichment for HA-HIF1 was detected in cells treated with doxycycline as compared with those under basal conditions (Fig. 7, C and D). These results support our findings that induction of PLOD2 expression is mediated by transcriptionally active HIF factor. The binding of HIF2 could not be investigated, as the anti-HA antibody failed to immunoprecipitate this HIF form (data not shown). Our experiments showed an absolute requirement of a functional HIF site for TGF-β1 to exert its action on PLOD2 expression. To analyze the molecular basis of this behavior, we cotransfected a vector for the overexpression of SMAD3 together with a series of deletion constructs of PLOD2 promoter based on the location of potential TGF-β1–responsive SMAD elements. As shown in Fig. 8, basal and TGF-β1–stimulated activities were strongly amplified by overexpression of SMAD3 in the parental −1826 promoter fragment. A similar effect, but much more attenuated, was observed for constructs −1260 and −346, whereas downstream fragments remained unmodified. Therefore, the use of this approach revealed the existence of two distinct TGF-β1–responsive elements within the PLOD2 promoter, a distal SMAD site of the form CAGAC at position −1405/−1401 and a proximal region with two closely located CAGAC motifs at −337/−333 and −313/−309 (Fig. 9A). Mutant constructs altering these SMAD sites were tested under overexpression of SMAD3 or mock. Fig. 9B shows that the potentiation observed in the WT promoter was strongly diminished in the vectors harboring these mutations either individually or combined, these results indicating the absolute requirement of both DNA regions for a full response to TGF-β1. Remarkably, multiple-sequence alignment showed that, except for one proximal CAGAC site present in the rabbit and bovine genomes, full conservation of these SMAD sites was only found in hominidae, an observation that predicts that the PLOD2 gene may not respond to TGF-β1 in mammalian species other than this family.Figure 9Characterization of TGF-β1–activated SMAD sites within the PLOD2 promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2965199191,"Many efforts have been made to understand the pathogenesis of bovine mastitis to reduce losses and promote animal welfare. Staphylococcus aureus may cause bovine clinical mastitis, but it is mainly associated with subclinical infection, which is usually persistent and can easily reoccur. Here, we conducted a comparative genomic analysis between strains of S. aureus causing subclinical infection (Sau170, 302, 1269, 1364), previously sequenced by our group, and two well-characterized strains causing clinical mastitis (N305 and RF122) to find differences that could be linked to mastitis outcome. A total of 146 virulence-associated genes were compared and no appreciable differences were found between the bacteria. However, several nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in genes present in the subclinical strains when compared to RF122 and N305, especially in genes encoding host immune evasion and surface proteins. The secreted and surface proteins predicted by in silico tools were compared through multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS), revealing a high degree of similarity among the strains. The comparison of orthologous genes by OrthoMCL identified a membrane transporter and a lipoprotein as exclusive of bacteria belonging to the subclinical and clinical groups, respectively. No hit was found in RF122 and N305 for the membrane transporter using BLAST algorithm. For the lipoprotein, sequences of Sau170, 302, 1269, and 1364 with identities between 68-73% were found in the MDS dataset. A conserved region found only in the lipoprotein genes of RF122 and N305 was used for primer design. Although the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on field isolates of S. aureus did not validate the findings for the transporter, the lipoprotein was able to separate the clinical from the subclinical isolates. These results show that sequence variation among bovine S. aureus, and not only the presence/absence of virulence factors, is an important aspect to consider when comparing isolates causing different mastitis outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2965324714,"Damage to the retina and optic nerve is found in some neurodegenerative disorders, but it is unclear whether the optic pathway and central nervous system (CNS) are affected by the same injurious agent, or whether optic pathway damage is due to retrograde degeneration following the CNS damage. Finding an environmental agent that could be responsible for the optic pathway damage would support the hypothesis that this environmental toxicant also triggers the CNS lesions. Toxic metals have been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, and mercury has been found in the retina and optic nerve of experimentally-exposed animals. Therefore, to see if mercury exposure in the prenatal period could be one link between optic pathway damage and human CNS disorders of later life, we examined the retina and optic nerve of neonatal mice that had been exposed prenatally to mercury vapor, using a technique, autometallography, that detects the presence of mercury within cells. Pregnant mice were exposed to a non-toxic dose of mercury vapor for four hours a day for five days in late gestation, when the mouse placenta most closely resembles the human placenta. The neonatal offspring were sacrificed one day after birth and gapless serial sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks containing the eyes were stained with silver nitrate autometallography to detect inorganic mercury. Mercury was seen in the nuclear membranes of retinal ganglion cells and endothelial cells. A smaller amount of mercury was present in the retinal inner plexiform and inner nuclear layers. Mercury was conspicuous in the peripapillary retinal pigment epithelium. In the optic nerve, mercury was seen in the nuclear membranes and processes of glia and in endothelial cells. Optic pathway and CNS endothelial cells contained mercury. In conclusion, mercury is taken up preferentially by fetal retinal ganglion cells, optic nerve glial cells, the retinal pigment epithelium, and endothelial cells. Mercury induces free radical formation, autoimmunity, and genetic and epigenetic changes, so these findings raise the possibility that mercury plays a part in the pathogenesis of degenerative CNS disorders that also affect the retina and optic nerve."
https://openalex.org/W2965382576,"In the eastern Pacific Ocean, the tropical tuna purse-seine fishery incidentally captures high numbers of five mobulid bycatch species; all of which are classified as mortalities by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission due to uncertainties in post-release mortality rates. To date, the factors (operational or environmental) leading to the capture of these species by the fishery have not been well studied. Here, we developed Generalized Additive Models for fisheries observer data to analyze the relationships between the presence/absence of Mobula mobular bycatch and oceanographic conditions, the spatial and temporal variability in fishing location, and the set type (associated with dolphins, free-swimming tuna schools or floating objects). Our results suggest that chlorophyll concentration and sea surface height are the most important variables to describe the presence of M. mobular in conjunction with geographic location (latitude and longitude) and set type. Presence of the species was predicted in waters with chlorophyll concentrations between 0.5-1 mg·m-3 and with sea surface height values close to 0; which indicates direct relationships with productive upwelling systems. Seasonally, M. mobular was observed more frequently during December-January and August-September. We also found the highest probability of presence observed in School sets, followed by Dolphin sets. Three areas were observed as important hotspots: the area close to the coastal upwelling of northern Peru, the area west to Islands Colon Archipelago (Galapagos) and the area close to the Costa Rica Dome. This information is crucial to identify the mobulids habitat and hotspots that could be managed and protected under dynamic spatial management measures to reduce the mortality of mobulid rays in the eastern Pacific purse-seine fishery and, hence, ensure the sustainability of the populations of these iconic species."
https://openalex.org/W2965802689,"This study was performed to investigate the effects of dietary inclusion of 20% rapeseed meal (RSM) as an alternative to soybean meal (SBM) in a three-month feeding experiment with growing finishing pigs. Dietary alteration affected growth performance, several carcass traits and transcriptional responses in the skeletal muscle, but did not affect measured meat quality traits. In general, pigs fed the RSM test diet exhibited reduced growth performance compared to pigs on SBM control diet. Significant transcriptional changes in the skeletal muscle of growing pigs fed RSM diet were likely the consequence of an increased amount of fiber and higher polyunsaturated fatty acids, and presence of bioactive phytochemicals, such as glucosinolates. RNAseq pipeline using Tophat2-Cuffdiff identified 57 upregulated and 63 downregulated genes in RSM compared to SBM pigs. Significantly enriched among downregulated pathways was p53–mediated signalling involved in cellular proliferation, while activation of negative growth regulators (IER5, KLF10, BTG2, KLF11, RETREG1, PRUNE2) in RSM fed pigs provided further evidence for reduced proliferation and increased cellular death, in accordance with the observed reduction in performance traits. Upregulation of well-known metabolic controllers (PDK4, UCP3, ESRRG and ESRRB), involved in energy homeostasis (glucose and lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial function), suggested less available energy and nutrients in RSM pigs. Furthermore, several genes supported more pronounced proteolysis (ABTB1, OTUD1, PADI2, SPP1) and reduced protein synthesis (THBS1, HSF4, AP1S2) in RSM muscle tissue. In parallel, higher levels of NR4A3, PDK4 and FGF21, and a drop in adropin, ELOVL6 and CIDEC/FSP27 indicated increased lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation, reflective of lower dressing percentage. Finally, pigs exposed to RSM showed greater expression level of genes responsive to oxidative stress, indicated by upregulation of GPX1, GPX2, and TXNIP."
https://openalex.org/W2966582780,"The global mid-ocean ridge system is the most extensive magmatic system on our planet and is the site of 75 per cent of Earth’s volcanism1. The vertical extent of mid-ocean-ridge magmatic systems has been considered to be restricted: even at the ultraslow-spreading Gakkel mid-ocean ridge under the Arctic Ocean, where the lithosphere is thickest, crystallization depths of magmas that feed eruptions are thought to be less than nine kilometres2. These depths were determined using the volatile-element contents of melt inclusions, which are small volumes of magma that become trapped within crystallizing minerals. In studies of basaltic magmatic systems, olivine is the mineral of choice for this approach2–6. However, pressures derived from olivine-hosted melt inclusions are at odds with pressures derived from basalt major-element barometers7 and geophysical measurements of lithospheric thickness8. Here we present a comparative study of olivine- and plagioclase-hosted melt inclusions from the Gakkel mid-ocean ridge. We show that the volatile contents of plagioclase-hosted melt inclusions correspond to much higher crystallization pressures (with a mean value of 270 megapascals) than olivine-hosted melt inclusions (with a mean value of 145 megapascals). The highest recorded pressure that we find equates to a depth 16.4 kilometres below the seafloor. Such higher depths are consistent with both the thickness of the Gakkel mid-ocean ridge lithosphere and with pressures reconstructed from glass compositions. In contrast to previous studies using olivine-hosted melt inclusions, our results demonstrate that mid-ocean-ridge volcanoes may have magmatic roots deep in the lithospheric mantle, at least at ultraslow-spreading ridges. Volatile contents of plagioclase-hosted melt inclusions from volcanoes at the Gakkel mid-ocean ridge suggest that magmatic crystallization extends to depths of 16 kilometres, much deeper than suggested by olivine-hosted melt inclusions."
https://openalex.org/W2964391949,"Transcription factor PAX8 expression is upregulated in several types of cancers. However, little is known about the function of PAX8 in the progression of hepatoma and its regulatory mechanisms. Here, we show that PAX8 silencing inhibits the proliferation and clonogenicity of hepatoma cells and its growth in vivo. The HBV X protein (HBx) does not directly interacts, but stabilizes PAX8 by inhibiting proteasome-dependent ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex component Skp2 through its LRR domain directly interacts with the Prd domain of PAX8 and targets PAX8 by recognizing its lysine 275 for ubiquitination and degradation in hepatoma cells. In addition, HBx directly interacts and is colocalized with Skp2 to inhibit its recognition and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of PAX8 in hepatoma cells. Moreover, HBx upregulates the expression and phosphorylation of Aurora A, a serine–threonine kinase, which interacts with and phosphorylates PAX8 at S209 and T277, compromising the Skp2-recognized PAX8 ubiquitination and destabilization. Thus, HBx stabilizes PAX8 protein by inhibiting the Skp2 targeted PAX8 ubiquitination and enhancing the Aurora A-mediated its phosphorylation, contributing to the progression of hepatoma. Our findings suggest that PAX8 may a new target for design of therapies and uncover new insights into the pathogenesis of hepatoma."
https://openalex.org/W2964834464,"The linguistic environment of the classroom is influential to young children’s language development. To date, however, literature on the linguistic environment of child-care centers has largely examined teacher practices or children’s aggregate environment, overlooking the child’s first-person experiences and differentiated experiences within the classroom. In this study we used a new method in the educational setting that captures the learner’s perspective: head-mounted cameras. Thirteen children in one preschool classroom wore a head-mounted camera to capture their first-person experiences in one morning session, including interactions with others and the features of the child-directed speech (CDS) addressed to them. Results revealed that, from children’s personal view, the linguistic environment of the classroom is more dynamic from what previous studies have reported. Children interacted for longer with their teachers than their peers and heard more CDS from them, but for some children peers served as an additional source of language. Further, our analysis highlighted within-classroom variability in language experiences in terms of the properties of the CDS addressed to target children and how they were exposed to this input over time. Results are discussed with respect to peer influence on children’s learning, heterogeneity in learning opportunities in classrooms, and the variability of the linguistic environment over time."
https://openalex.org/W2964673044,"Bacterial pathogens assemble adhesive surface structures termed pili or fimbriae to initiate and sustain infection of host tissues. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli, the primary causative agent of urinary tract infections, expresses type 1 and P pili required for colonization of the bladder and kidney, respectively. These pili are assembled by the conserved chaperone–usher (CU) pathway, in which a periplasmic chaperone works together with an outer membrane (OM) usher protein to build and secrete the pilus fiber. Previously, we found that the small molecule and antiparasitic drug nitazoxanide (NTZ) inhibits CU pathway–mediated pilus biogenesis in E. coli by specifically interfering with proper maturation of the usher protein in the OM. The usher is folded and inserted into the OM by the β-barrel assembly machine (BAM) complex, which in E. coli comprises five proteins, BamA–E. Here, we show that sensitivity of the usher to NTZ is modulated by BAM expression levels and requires the BamB and BamE lipoproteins. Furthermore, a genetic screen for NTZ-resistant bacterial mutants isolated a mutation in the essential BamD lipoprotein. These findings suggest that NTZ selectively interferes with an usher-specific arm of the BAM complex, revealing new details of the usher folding pathway and BAM complex function. Evaluation of a set of NTZ derivatives identified compounds with increased potency and disclosed that NTZ's nitrothiazole ring is critical for usher inhibition. In summary, our findings indicate highly specific effects of NTZ on the usher folding pathway and have uncovered NTZ analogs that specifically decrease usher levels in the OM.

https://openalex.org/W2966390440,"Vitamin C (ascorbic acid, AA) is a well-known regulator of bone and cartilage metabolism. However, the mechanisms of AA's action in these tissues are only partly understood. In this study, we confirmed that AA contributes to bone and cartilage metabolism by showing decreased articular cartilage and trabecular bone in AA-deficient spontaneous fracture (sfx) mutant mice. In vitro, we found that AA exerts differential effects on chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation. Since AA is known to increase levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) and induce DNA demethylation via the ten-eleven translocases (TETs), and since prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein 2 (PHD2), a known mediator of AA's effects in these tissues, is part of the same enzyme family as the TETs, we next investigated whether increases in 5-hmC might mediate some of these effects. All TETs and PHDs are expressed in chondrocytes and osteoblasts, and PHD2 is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of the cell, lending plausibility to the hypothesis of altered 5-hmC content in these cells. We found that AA treatment increased levels of 5-hmC in both cell types globally, notably including promoter regions of osteoblast differentiation genes. Furthermore, inhibition of PHD2 decreased 5-hmC levels in chondrocyte differentiation gene promoters, and knockdown of Phd2 in chondrocytes reduced global 5-hmC levels, suggesting for the first time that PHD2 may itself directly mediate increases in 5-hmC in chondrocyte and osteoblast genes. Further investigation of this mechanism could lead to novel therapeutic approaches to treat debilitating diseases such as osteoarthritis and osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2966148395,"Background Although the relationship between residential food environments and health outcomes have been extensively studied, the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and multiple food environments have not been fully explored. We examined the relationship between characteristics of three distinct food environments and BMI among elementary school employees in the metropolitan area of New Orleans, LA. We assessed the food environments around the residential and worksite neighborhoods and the commuting corridors. Research methodology/principal findings This study combined data from three different sources: individual and worksite data (ACTION), food retailer database (Dunn and Bradstreet), and the U.S. Census TIGER/Line Files. Spatial and hierarchical analyses were performed to explore the impact of predictors at the individual and environmental levels on BMI. When the three food environments were combined, the number of supermarkets and the number of grocery stores at residential food environment had a significant association with BMI (β = 0.56 and β = 0.24, p < 0.01), whereas the number of full-service restaurants showed an inverse relationship with BMI (β = -0.15, p < 0.001). For the commute corridor food environment, it was found that each additional fast-food restaurant in a vicinity of one kilometer traveled contributed to a higher BMI (β = 0.80, p <0.05), while adjusting for other factors. No statistical associations were found between BMI and worksite food environment. Conclusions The current study was the first to examine the relationship between BMI and food environments around residential neighborhoods, work neighborhoods, and the commuting corridor. Significant results were found between BMI and the availability of food stores around residential neighborhoods and the commuting corridor, adjusted for individual-level factors. This study expands the analysis beyond residential neighborhoods, illustrating the importance of multiple environmental factors in relation to BMI."
https://openalex.org/W2964954940,"Zipf's law of abbreviation, relating more frequent signals to shorter signal lengths, applies to sounds in a variety of communication systems, both human and non-human. It also applies to writing systems: more frequent words tend to be encoded by less complex graphemes, even when grapheme complexity is decoupled from word length. This study documents an exception to this law of abbreviation. Observing European heraldic motifs, whose frequency of use was documented for the whole continent and over two large corpora (total N = 25115), one medieval, one early modern, we found that they do not obey a robust law of abbreviation. In our early modern corpus, motif complexity and motif frequency are positively, not negatively, correlated, a result driven by iconic motifs. In both our corpora, iconic motifs tend to be more frequent when more complex. They grew in popularity after the invention of printing. Our results suggest that lacking iconicity may be a precondition for a graphic code to exhibit Zipf's Law of Abbreviation."
https://openalex.org/W2967293046,"The activation of key signaling pathways downstream of antigen receptor engagement is critically required for normal lymphocyte activation during the adaptive immune response. CARD11 is a multidomain signaling scaffold protein required for antigen receptor signaling to NF-κB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and mTOR. Germline mutations in the CARD11 gene result in at least four types of primary immunodeficiency, and somatic CARD11 gain-of-function mutations drive constitutive NF-κB activity in diffuse large B cell lymphoma and other lymphoid cancers. In response to antigen receptor triggering, CARD11 transitions from a closed, inactive state to an open, active scaffold that recruits multiple signaling partners into a complex to relay downstream signaling. However, how this signal-induced CARD11 conversion occurs remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the role of Inducible Element 1 (IE1), a short regulatory element in the CARD11 Inhibitory Domain, in the CARD11 signaling cycle. We find that IE1 controls the signal-dependent Opening Step that makes CARD11 accessible to the binding of cofactors, including Bcl10, MALT1, and the HOIP catalytic subunit of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex. Surprisingly, we find that IE1 is also required at an independent step for the maximal activation of HOIP and MALT1 enzymatic activity after cofactor recruitment to CARD11. This role of IE1 reveals that there is an Enzymatic Activation Step in the CARD11 signaling cycle that is distinct from the Cofactor Association Step. Our results indicate that CARD11 has evolved to actively coordinate scaffold opening and the induction of enzymatic activity among recruited cofactors during antigen receptor signaling.

Our results indicate that CARD11 has evolved to actively coordinate scaffold opening and the induction of enzymatic activity among recruited cofactors during antigen receptor signaling. The signaling pathways that control cellular behavior frequently rely on scaffold proteins to translate receptor triggering at the cell surface into the assembly of multiprotein complexes that execute changes in gene expression and cellular effector function. Signaling scaffolds provide important nodes of regulation, and their ability to influence other proteins in a signal-responsive manner can be modulated by a variety of mechanisms, including induced conformational change, regulated cellular localization, phosphorylation, and other post-translational modifications. Understanding how scaffold proteins signal and how they are regulated is key to appreciating how signaling pathways attain biological specificity and how the dysregulation of signaling pathways contributes to disease.

CARD11 is composed of a series of protein–protein interaction domains that nucleate the assembly of a multiprotein complex in response to T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR) triggering. Prior to signal initiation, CARD11 is kept in a closed, inactive state by an Inhibitory Domain (ID) that prevents the binding of cofactors in part through intramolecular interactions involving the CARD, LATCH, Coiled-coil, L3, and GUK domains (21Sommer K.

ID function is mediated by four Repressive Elements (REs) that work cooperatively and with redundancy to prevent spontaneous signaling. Upon receptor engagement, the autoinhibitory action of the REs is neutralized in a poorly understood process that converts CARD11 into an open, active state that is receptive to the binding of cofactors including Bcl10, MALT1, and HOIP, the catalytic subunit of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex, as well as several other proteins (1Bedsaul J.R.

This receptor-induced RE neutralization is thought to involve the signal-inducible phosphorylation of three serine residues within the ID, including Ser-564, Ser-567, and Ser-577 (21Sommer K. Guo B.

However, it has remained unclear how exactly the modification of these residues contributes to CARD11 signaling activity and whether these residues are required subsequent to RE neutralization and cofactor association. The signal-induced recruitment of HOIP, Bcl10, and MALT1 to CARD11 leads to the action of HOIP on Bcl10 to generate LinUbn-Bcl10, which then associates with the IKKγ subunit of the IKK complex in a step required for the induction of IKK kinase activity (27Yang Y.K.

It has remained unclear whether recruitment of HOIP (enzyme) and Bcl10 (substrate) to CARD11 is sufficient to elicit Bcl10 conjugation or whether other steps are also required. Similarly, MALT1 recruitment to CARD11 precedes MALT1-mediated cleavage events that modulate pathway output, including those involving HOIL1, CYLD, A20, RelB, and others (28Juilland M. Thome M. Holding all the CARDs: how MALT1 controls CARMA/CARD-dependent signaling.Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 (30214442): 192710.3389/fimmu.2018.01927Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether MALT1 recruitment to CARD11 is sufficient to activate its proteolytic activity. In this report we investigate the function of Inducible Element 1 (IE1) within the CARD11 ID and surprisingly find that IE1 is required both for CARD11 opening and, independently, for the maximal activation of HOIP and MALT1 enzymatic activity subsequent to their recruitment to CARD11. IE1 thus provides a small element in CARD11 that ensures coordination of at least two steps in the CARD11 signaling cycle. In a prior study (23Jattani R.P. Tritapoe J.M. Pomerantz J.L.

To further define how this region contributed to signal-induced CARD11 activity, we performed a deletion analysis in the context of Δ530–616, a CARD11 variant that is missing a portion of the ID but retains REs 1 and 4 (Fig. 1, A and B). CARD11 constructs were assayed in an RNAi-rescue transient transfection assay in which the activation of the Igκ2–IFN–LUC NF-κB luciferase reporter downstream is monitored following anti-CD3/anti-CD28 cross-linking of Jurkat T cells with stable lentiviral-mediated knockdown of CARD11 (KD-CARD11). This reporter assay has previously been shown to quantitatively reflect TCR-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity (29Chan W. Schaffer T.B. Pomerantz J.L. A quantitative signaling screen identifies CARD11 mutations in the CARD and LATCH domains that induce Bcl10 ubiquitination and human lymphoma cell survival.Mol.

A quantitative signaling screen identifies CARD11 mutations in the CARD and LATCH domains that induce Bcl10 ubiquitination and human lymphoma cell survival.Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 33 (23149938): 429-44310.1128/MCB.00850-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), KD-CARD11 cells failed to appreciably activate NF-κB upon TCR/CD28 triggering, as compared with the control Jurkat T cell line that expresses a nontarget (NT) shRNA, but signaling could be rescued upon expression of WT murine CARD11, which is resistant to the shRNA targeting human CARD11 (Fig. 1, C and D). We cloned six overlapping regions of CARD11 into the Δ530–616 construct and assayed them for anti-CD3/anti-CD28–induced NF-κB activation. Inducible signaling was observed with the 536–610 region, the 561–610 region, and the 536–586 region, but not with the 568–610 region or the 536–578 region (Fig. 1, C and D). This suggested that the interval between Ser-561 and Ala-586 would be necessary and sufficient to support inducible CARD11 signaling to NF-κB in the Δ530–616 context. This prediction was borne out by the Δ530–616 + 561–586 construct (Fig. 1, C and D). We refer to this region between Ser-561 and Ala-586 as Inducible Element 1 (IE1). We next individually mutated IE1 residues in the context of full-length CARD11 and used the same RNAi-rescue assay to compare each mutant's signaling to that of WT at comparable expression levels (Fig. 2, A–E). The most deleterious effects on TCR signaling to NF-κB were observed as a result of mutation of residues Ser-564, Ser-567, Pro-573, Ser-577, Ile-578, and Arg-581, all of which reduced signaling output to 20% or less than that of WT CARD11. The mutation of residues Ile-568, Ala-570, Glu-571, Pro-572, Gly-574, Val-579, and Arg-580 also reproducibly impaired CARD11 signaling in this context to levels ∼30–50% that of WT CARD11. These data indicated that multiple residues spanning the region between Ser-564 and Arg-581 are important for IE1 activity (Fig. 2F). The CARD11 signaling cycle downstream of antigen receptor triggering proceeds along a series of steps. In the first step, CARD11 is converted from a closed, inactive state to an open scaffold capable of binding cofactors. This step, which we refer to as the Opening Step, involves the neutralization of the autoinhibitory action of the four redundant REs in the ID, which prevent CARD11 from binding cofactors prior to receptor engagement. In the next step, signaling cofactors bind to opened CARD11 in what we refer to as the Cofactor Association Step. Following cofactor association, the kinase activity of the IKK complex is induced, leading to the phosphorylation of IκB proteins and their subsequent ubiquitinylation and degradation, which allows for stable NF-κB nuclear translocation. Ultimately, CARD11 returns to an inactive state in a step we refer to as the Complex Disassembly Step. In principle, IE1 residues could be important for the Opening Step, for the Cofactor Association Step via participation in protein–protein interfaces that form as cofactors bind CARD11, or for some other CARD11-dependent step in signaling. We initially suspected that the residues would be required for the Opening Step because previous studies have implicated the phosphorylation of Ser-564, Ser-567, and Ser-577 as required for the antigen receptor-induced neutralization of the autoinhibitory function of the ID and the subsequent binding of cofactors to CARD11, including Bcl10 and MALT1 (21Sommer K.

The study aimed to identify significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations for rachis length (RL), leaf area (LA) and total dry weight (TrDW) in oil palm among diverse African germplasm. The Illumina NextSeq platform has been used for SNP genotyping and retained 4031 fully informative SNPs after applying the filter criterion. These 4031 SNPs were used for genome wide association study for the above three traits. The LD decay rates of the African germplasm using GBS data of SNP is observed to be 25 Kb at 0.45 of average pair wise correlation coefficient (r2). Association mapping led to the identification of seven significant associations for three traits using MLM approach at a P value of ≤ 0.001. Three associations were identified for total dry weight, two each for leaf area index and rachis length. The qtlLA1 was found to be highly significant at a P value of 7.39E-05 (18.4% phenotypic variance) which is located on chromosome 4. Two QTLs (qtlLA2 and qtlRL1) were located on chromosome 1, which explained 11.9% and 12.4% of phenotypic variance respectively. Three QTLs for total dry weight were located on chromosome 2, 14 and 16, all-together explained 40% phenotypic variance. The results showed that the SNP-trait associations identified in the present study could be used in selection of elite oil palm germplasm for higher yields."
https://openalex.org/W2966722478,"The relationship between dive behavior and oceanographic conditions is not well understood for marine predators, especially sea turtles. We tagged loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) with satellite-linked depth loggers in the Gulf of Mexico, where there is a minimal amount of dive data for this species. We tested for associations between four measurements of dive behavior (total daily dive frequency, frequency of dives to the bottom, frequency of long dives and time-at-depth) and both oceanographic conditions (sea surface temperature [SST], net primary productivity [NPP]) and behavioral mode (inter-nesting, migration, or foraging). From 2011–2013 we obtained 26 tracks from 25 adult female loggerheads tagged after nesting in the Gulf of Mexico. All turtles remained in the Gulf of Mexico and spent about 10% of their time at the surface (10% during inter-nesting, 14% during migration, 9% during foraging). Mean total dive frequency was 41.9 times per day. Most dives were ≤ 25 m and between 30–40 min. During inter-nesting and foraging, turtles dived to the bottom 95% of days. SST was an important explanatory variable for all dive patterns; higher SST was associated with more dives per day, more long dives and more dives to the seafloor. Increases in NPP were associated with more long dives and more dives to the bottom, while lower NPP resulted in an increased frequency of overall diving. Longer dives occurred more frequently during migration and a higher proportion of dives reached the seafloor during foraging when SST and NPP were higher. Our study stresses the importance of the interplay between SST and foraging resources for influencing dive behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2966317884,"The range of c. 1012 ambient light levels to which we can be exposed massively exceeds the <103 response range of neurons in the visual system, but we can see well in dim starlight and bright sunlight. This remarkable ability is achieved largely by a speeding up of the visual response as light levels increase, causing characteristic changes in our sensitivity to different rates of flicker. Here, we account for over 65 years of flicker-sensitivity measurements with an elegantly-simple, physiologically-relevant model built from first-order low-pass filters and subtractive inhibition. There are only two intensity-dependent model parameters: one adjusts the speed of the visual response by shortening the time constants of some of the filters in the direct cascade as well as those in the inhibitory stages; the other parameter adjusts the overall gain at higher light levels. After reviewing the physiological literature, we associate the variable gain and three of the variable-speed filters with biochemical processes in cone photoreceptors, and a further variable-speed filter with processes in ganglion cells. The variable-speed but fixed-strength subtractive inhibition is most likely associated with lateral connections in the retina. Additional fixed-speed filters may be more central. The model can explain the important characteristics of human flicker-sensitivity including the approximate dependences of low-frequency sensitivity on contrast (Weber’s law) and of high-frequency sensitivity on amplitude (“high-frequency linearity”), the exponential loss of high-frequency sensitivity with increasing frequency, and the logarithmic increase in temporal acuity with light level (Ferry-Porter law). In the time-domain, the model can account for several characteristics of flash sensitivity including changes in contrast sensitivity with light level (de Vries-Rose and Weber’s laws) and changes in temporal summation (Bloch’s law). The new model provides fundamental insights into the workings of the visual system and gives a simple account of many visual phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W2953772310,"Floating catchment methods have recently been applied to identify priority regions for Automated External Defibrillator (AED) deployment, to aid in improving Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) survival. This approach models access as a supply-to-demand ratio for each area, targeting areas with high demand and low supply for AED placement. These methods incorporate spatial covariates on OHCA occurrence, but do not provide precise AED locations, which are critical to the initial intent of such location analysis research. Exact AED locations can be determined using optimisation methods, but they do not incorporate known spatial risk factors for OHCA, such as income and demographics. Combining these two approaches would evaluate AED placement impact, describe drivers of OHCA occurrence, and identify areas that may not be appropriately covered by AED placement strategies. There are two aims in this paper. First, to develop geospatial models of OHCA that account for and display uncertainty. Second, to evaluate the AED placement methods using geospatial models of accessibility. We first identify communities with the greatest gap between demand and supply for allocating AEDs. We then use this information to evaluate models for precise AED location deployment.Case study data set consisted of 2802 OHCA events and 719 AEDs. Spatial OHCA occurrence was described using a geospatial model, with possible spatial correlation accommodated by introducing a conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior on the municipality-level spatial random effect. This model was fit with Integrated Nested Laplacian Approximation (INLA), using covariates for population density, proportion male, proportion over 65 years, financial strength, and the proportion of land used for transport, commercial, buildings, recreation, and urban areas. Optimisation methods for AED locations were applied to find the top 100 AED placement locations. AED access was calculated for current access and 100 AED placements. Priority rankings were then given for each area based on their access score and predicted number of OHCA events.Of the 2802 OHCA events, 64.28% occurred in rural areas, and 35.72% in urban areas. Additionally, over 70% of individuals were aged over 65. Supply of AEDs was less than demand in most areas. Priority regions for AED placement were identified, and access scores were evaluated for AED placement methodology by ranking the access scores and the predicted OHCA count. AED placement methodology placed AEDs in areas with the highest priority, but placed more AEDs in areas with more predicted OHCA events in each grid cell.The methods in this paper incorporate OHCA spatial risk factors and OHCA coverage to identify spatial regions most in need of resources. These methods can be used to help understand how AED allocation methods affect OHCA accessibility, which is of significant practical value for communities when deciding AED placements."

In one experiment, Kunming mice were separated into four groups (n = 6 per group); the control (CON) group received 3.0% linoleic acid (LA) oil, the L-CLA group received a mixture of 2.0% LA and 1.0% CLA, the M-CLA group received a mixture of 1.0% LA and a 2.0% CLA, and the H-CLA group received 3.0% CLA. Feeding proceeded from day 4 to day 10 of lactation. In a second experiment, a CON group received 3.0% LA, and an H-CLA group received 3.0% CLA. Plasma parameters were analyzed for all groups, and insulin tolerance tests (ITTs) were conducted. CLA treatment did not affect dam weight but significantly decreased the food intake of dams during lactation. Furthermore, CLA decreased the weight of pups on day 10 of lactation; this effect was attributed to lower milk fat of dams in the CLA group than in those of the other groups. Relative to mice in the CON group, the mice in the H-CLA group displayed increased liver weight and liver triglyceride (TG) content as well as higher TG content and γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT) activity in the plasma. Moreover, high-dose CLA resulted in insulin resistance, possibly affecting the red blood cell (RBC) and hemoglobin (HCB) levels in the plasma. In conclusion, lactating mice receiving a high dose of CLA exhibited fatty liver, insulin resistance, and impaired lactation performance."

https://openalex.org/W2965826856,"RAS is the founding member of a superfamily of GTPases and regulates signaling pathways involved in cellular growth control. While recent studies have shown that the activation state of RAS can be controlled by lysine ubiquitylation and acetylation, the existence of lysine methylation of the RAS superfamily GTPases remains unexplored. In contrast to acetylation, methylation does not alter the side chain charge and it has been challenging to deduce its impact on protein structure by conventional amino acid substitutions. Herein, we investigate lysine methylation on RAS and RAS-related GTPases. We developed GoMADScan (Go language-based Modification Associated Database Scanner), a new user-friendly application that scans and extracts posttranslationally modified peptides from databases. The GoMADScan search on PhosphoSitePlus databases identified methylation of conserved lysine residues in the core GTPase domain of RAS superfamily GTPases, including residues corresponding to RAS Lys-5, Lys-16, and Lys-117. To follow up on these observations, we immunoprecipitated endogenous RAS from HEK293T cells, conducted mass spectrometric analysis and found that RAS residues, Lys-5 and Lys-147, undergo dimethylation and monomethylation, respectively. Since mutations of Lys-5 have been found in cancers and RASopathies, we set up molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to assess the putative impact of Lys-5 dimethylation on RAS structure. Results from our MD analyses predict that dimethylation of Lys-5 does not significantly alter RAS conformation, suggesting that Lys-5 methylation may alter existing protein interactions or create a docking site to foster new interactions. Taken together, our findings uncover the existence of lysine methylation as a novel posttranslational modification associated with RAS and the RAS superfamily GTPases, and putative impact of Lys-5 dimethylation on RAS structure."

DPP3 plasma activity increases in septic patients and correlates with mortality risk. However, the exact physiological role of DPP3 remains unclear and animal studies are necessary to reveal the function of DPP3 in vivo. To this demand, we developed a two-step purification procedure for isolation of native human DPP3 from blood cell lysate (BCL) that is suitable for in vivo applications. With the use of monoclonal antibodies coupled to beads in combination with an ion-exchange chromatography, we recovered 68% of human DPP3 activity from BCL with a purity of ≥ 95%. Purified human DPP3 was assayed for activity and protein concentration using recently published DPP3-activity- and immunoassays. Additionally, protein stability and storage in relevant buffers were tested. Our results provide a promising strategy for fast and efficient isolation of human DPP3.

https://openalex.org/W2966442678,"Cyanobacteria of the Prochlorococcus and marine Synechococcus genera are the most abundant photosynthetic microbes in the ocean. Intriguingly, the genomes of these bacteria are strongly divergent even within each genus, both in gene content and at the amino acid level of the encoded proteins. One striking exception to this is a 62-amino-acid protein, termed Prochlorococcus/Synechococcus hyper-conserved protein (PSHCP). PSHCP is not only found in all sequenced Prochlorococcus and marine Synechococcus genomes, but it is also nearly 100% identical in its amino acid sequence across all sampled genomes. Such universal distribution and sequence conservation suggest an essential cellular role of PSHCP in these bacteria. However, its function is unknown. Here, we used NMR spectroscopy to determine its structure, finding that 53 of the 62 amino acids in PSHCP form a Tudor domain, whereas the remainder of the protein is disordered. NMR titration experiments revealed that PSHCP has only a weak affinity for DNA, but an 18.5-fold higher affinity for tRNA, hinting at an involvement of PSHCP in translation. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments further revealed that PSHCP also binds single-stranded, double-stranded, and hairpin RNAs. These results provide the first insight into the structure and function of PSHCP, suggesting that PSHCP appears to be an RNA-binding protein that can recognize a broad array of RNA molecules."

This study evaluated the association between social context variables and hospitalization of 60 years old and older patients due to stroke in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. An ecological cross-sectional study was conducted, with secondary data from the Brazilian Hospital Information System from 2006 to 2014. Hospitalization rates were calculated and categorized by tertiles. For subsequent analyzes, the polar extremes method was used to select the groups with extremes values. After that, Student t or Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare the contextual variables and the hospitalization rates clusters. Then, a Binary Logistic Regression analysis was used to assess the association between hospitalization rates clusters and the contextual variables. The total number of hospitalizations was 82 796; the hospitalization rate varied in extremes groups from the lowest (3.49) to the highest (11.95) (p<0.001). The highest rates group was positively associated with the proportion of elderly (p<0.001), the illiteracy rate of the aged (p = 0.01), primary care coverage (p<0.001) and ambulatory care for hypertension and diabetes, while the income ratio showed negative association with the highest rates of hospitalization (p = 0.01). In the multivariate analysis, only the proportion of elderly (OR = 1.55; 95%CI 1.07-2.25), primary care coverage (OR = 1.05; 95%CI 1.01-1.11) and income ratio (OR = 0.82; 95%CI 0.67-0.99) maintained the association. In conclusion, contextual variables in the three dimensions studied were associated with the rate of hospitalization of aged due to stroke in the municipalities in Rio de Janeiro State. Transitional care and other improvements in both the health care and social services are demanded."

Firstly, the existence of at least one p-th mean almost periodic sequence solution of the semi-discrete stochastic models with almost periodic coefficients is investigated by using Minkowski inequality, Hölder inequality and Krasnoselskii's fixed point theorem. Secondly, the p-th moment global exponential stability of the semi-discrete stochastic models is also studied by using some analytical skills and the proof of contradiction. Finally, a problem of stochastic stabilization for discrete cellular neural networks is studied."
https://openalex.org/W2965933112,"The current study aimed to develop iWorkHealth, a valid and reliable self-administered instrument which identifies workplace psychosocial risk factors in Singapore.The survey was conducted among 2718 employees who were primarily salaried workers and working in five companies from the healthcare, banking and finance, and legal sectors in Singapore. Factor extraction and item reduction were conducted using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and Mokken scale analysis (MSA). Construct validity, internal consistency and convergent validity of the final scale were confirmed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), Cronbach's alpha and Pearson correlation coefficients, respectively. Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes model was used to detect Differential Item Functioning (DIF).EFA and MSA identified a five-factor solution (job demand, job control, employee and management engagement, supervisor support and colleague support) for the 27 items iWorkHealth instrument. CFA demonstrated that the five-factor model fitted the data with high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.79 to 0.92). The convergent validity was shown through significant association with existing scales-high job demand was significantly associated with high burnout and depression, while high job control, employee and management engagement, supervisor support and coworker support were significantly associated with low burnout and depression. Ten items were detected with significant DIF, but impact was minimal on the associations between socio-demographics factors and iWorkHealth subscales.The findings provided evidence that the iWorkHealth instrument which comprises 27 items in five domains of psychosocial risk at the workplace is a reliable and valid instrument that could be used to measure and compare the level of psychosocial risk factors across companies and industries in Singapore."

While developing novel α-GalCer analogs that were meant to be utilized as potential adjuvants because of their production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Th1 skewers), we generated α-galactosylsphingamides (αGSA). Surprisingly, αGSAs are not potent antigens in vivo despite their strong T-cell receptor (TCR)–binding affinities. Here, using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), antigen presentation assays, and X-ray crystallography (yielding crystal structures of 19 different binary (CD1d-glycolipid) or ternary (CD1d-glycolipid-TCR) complexes at resolutions between 1.67 and 2.85 Å), we characterized the biochemical and structural details of αGSA recognition by murine NKT cells. We identified a molecular switch within murine (m)CD1d that modulates NKT cell activation by αGSAs. We found that the molecular switch involves a hydrogen bond interaction between Tyr-73 of mCD1d and the amide group oxygen of αGSAs. We further established that the length of the acyl chain controls the positioning of the amide group with respect to the molecular switch and works synergistically with Tyr-73 to control NKT cell activity.

As such NKT cells are of therapeutic interest because they exert a central role in bridging the innate and adaptive immune system. The mechanism of Th1 cytokine skewing involves TCR ligation with CD1d-antigen complexes on DCs, which induces up-regulation of costimulatory molecules, such as CD40L on the NKT cell and CD40 on the DC, ultimately leading to DC maturation and IL-12 production. Several non–mutually exclusive mechanisms have been proposed for the Th1 skewing activity of various α-GalCer analogs. These involve the loading of glycolipids to CD1d located in lipid rafts or an increased in vivo half-life of CD1d-glycolipid complexes often via enhanced CD1d-glycolipid interactions (16Aspeslagh S.

We have discovered that the activity of αGSAs is regulated by an interplay of acyl chain length and a molecular switch within CD1d that forms a novel interaction with the amide group in the phytosphingosine of αGSAs. We have reported previously a novel class of α-GalCer derivatives termed α-galactosylsphingamides (αGSAs) or in short sphingamides (28Guillaume J. Wang J. Janssens J. Remesh S.G. Risseeuw M.D.P.

The sphingamides are similar to α-GalCer but feature an amide group within the sphingosine moiety at a fixed distance from the anomeric carbon (Fig. 1). This amide was used to introduce either a terminal or in-chain phenyl group in the sphingosine. The acyl chain length was varied from 8 to 26 carbons. We have synthesized various control compounds that mimic the overall structure of the sphingamides but lack the central amide group to assess the influence of this polar moiety in NKT cell activation. In analogy to our previous study (28Guillaume J. Wang J. Janssens J. Remesh S.G. Risseeuw M.D.P. Decruy T. Froeyen M. Elewaut D. Zajonc D.M. Calenbergh S.V. Galactosylsphingamides: New α-GalCer analogues to probe the F′-pocket of CD1d.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28655912): 427610.1038/s41598-017-04461-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), all sphingamides with a terminal phenyl group were bound by the Vα14Vβ8.2 TCR with similar high affinities in the range from 16 to 37 nm (Fig. 2). There were no significant differences between the TCR association and dissociation rates. However, the sphingamide αGSA[26,P5p], which has a C26 fatty acid and an in-chain para-substituted phenyl moiety was bound by the TCR with considerably weaker affinity, suggesting that the phenyl moiety impairs TCR binding to CD1d. We have not measured the TCR-binding affinities for all sphingamides or control compounds, because our selected lipids establish a similar TCR-binding recognition. However, we failed to detect any TCR binding to αGSA[8,2P] and αGSA[8,4P], suggesting that these relatively short sphingamides do not bind to CD1d. This is also corroborated by our inability to obtain crystal structures of these two lipids in complex with CD1d (see below). Previously, we reported that sphingamides are not potent agonists for murine iNKT cells in vivo (28Guillaume J. Wang J. Janssens J. Remesh S.G. Risseeuw M.D.P. Decruy T. Froeyen M. Elewaut D. Zajonc D.M. Calenbergh S.V. Galactosylsphingamides: New α-GalCer analogues to probe the F′-pocket of CD1d.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28655912): 427610.1038/s41598-017-04461-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have assessed in detail the antigenicity of sphingamides using a cell-free and cell-based antigen presentation assay. Surprisingly, despite their high TCR-binding affinity, none of the short acyl chain sphingamides were able to robustly activate the iNKT cell hybridoma 1.2 when presented by recombinant mouse CD1d, suggesting that solely varying the position of the phenyl anchor does not affect antigenicity (Fig. 3A). In contrast, short acyl chain α-GalCer (αGC[8,18]) strongly activated iNKT cells. We next investigated whether the sphingamide modification influenced loading in cellular compartments and presentation by CD1d. Therefore, we used a cell-based antigen-presentation assay in which A20 cells were transfected with either WT or tail-deleted mCD1d (Fig. 3, B and C). The tail-deleted mCD1d lacks the tyrosine containing trafficking motif within the cytoplasmic tail and prevents its recycling through lysosomal compartments after mCD1d has been expressed on the cell surface; the WT mCD1d can recycle through lysosomal compartments allowing for lipid loading and/or processing. Again, none of the short-chain sphingamides activated iNKT cells, regardless of whether mCD1d had access to lysosomes for potential sphingamide loading using lipid transfer proteins. To increase the binding affinity of the sphingamides to mCD1d, we then synthesized and analyzed the two full-length sphingamides αGSA[26,18P] and αGSA[26,2P5p]. Surprisingly, both lipids potently activated iNKT cells and the response was optimal already at the lowest lipid concentration (0.5 μg/ml), despite αGSA[26,2P5p] having a 10-fold reduced TCR-binding affinity (Figs. 2 and 3D). The antigen-presentation data led us to hypothesize that the acyl chain length influences iNKT cell activation by sphingamides and, therefore, we have also generated and included intermediate acyl chain αGSAs (C12, C16, and C20) in our subsequent studies. These αGSAs were based on the sphingamide 6P backbone. To rationalize why all sphingamides are bound by the iNKT TCR with high affinity, but only long acyl chain sphingamides potently activate iNKT cells, we examined the structural basis of sphingamide presentation by mCD1d. The individual crystal structures of mCD1d-sphingamide complexes were determined to resolutions between 1.67 and 2.45 Å (Table S1). The two short-chain sphingamides αGSA[8,6P] and αGSA[8,8P] had been crystallized previously (termed as 5d and 5e in Ref. 28Guillaume J. Wang J. Janssens J. Remesh S.G. Risseeuw M.D.P. Decruy T. Froeyen M. Elewaut D. Zajonc D.M. Calenbergh S.V. Galactosylsphingamides: New α-GalCer analogues to probe the F′-pocket of CD1d.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28655912): 427610.1038/s41598-017-04461-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Most sphingamides show well-defined electron density for the hydroxyls of both the sugar moiety and the lipid backbone, indicative of an ordered presentation by CD1d (Fig. 4). The exception was αGSA[12,6P], which showed well-defined electron density for the galactose but less-ordered electron density around the amide group, suggesting a more flexible binding of that portion. As expected for α-GalCer analogs, the acyl chain is always inserted into the A′ pocket, regardless of its length, whereas the sphingosine moiety containing the amide group is bound in the F′ pocket. Up to an acyl chain length of C12, all sphingamides also recruited a spacer lipid into the A′ pocket of CD1d. Interestingly the helical orientation of the acyl chain circling in the A′ pocket differs between the longer sphingamides αGSA[20,6P] and αGSA[26,6P]. Whereas αGSA[20,6P] circles clockwise when looking down at the pocket, αGSA[26,6P] circles in a counterclockwise fashion. Whether there is a functional consequence of the acyl chain–binding orientation is not known. The sphingamide αGSA[8,6P] was structure-based designed and predicted to form an additional hydrogen bond between its amide oxygen and the hydroxyl of mCD1d residue Tyr-73. Surprisingly, only the long-chain sphingamide αGSA[26,6P] exhibited this H-bond, whereas the amide group of the shorter homologues and other sphingamides exhibit an altered orientation (Fig. 5). It appears there is a high degree of rotational freedom for this group, with the amide oxygen either pointing toward or away from Tyr-73. However, because the electron density in that region is well-defined for most sphingamides, we propose that the acyl chain length influences the precise positioning of the amide group in the F′ pocket, which in turn influences iNKT cell activation. Except for the amide group, the sphingamides bound in a conserved orientation with the galactose being stabilized by a core hydrogen-bond network involving CD1d residues Asp-80, Asp-153, and Thr-156 and the 2″-OH, 3″-OH of the galactose as well as the 3′ and/or 4′ hydroxyls of the phytosphingosine chain. The only exception is αGSA[20,6P], which showed a slight rotation in the galactose positioning. This binding orientation resulted in the loss of the H-bond interaction between Asp-153 of CD1d and 2″-OH and 3″-OH of the galactose, whereas a new H-bond is formed with the 4″-OH. However, the electron density for the galactose of this ligand is less contoured compared with other sphingamides, suggesting some flexibility in the binding orientation, especially because there is no well-defined electron density for the galactose hydroxyls (Fig. 4). Because we had previously established that the TCR of iNKT cells can induce a structural change in both glycolipid as well as mCD1d upon binding (29Li Y. Girardi E. Wang J. Yu E.D. Painter G.F. Kronenberg M. Zajonc D.M. The Vα14 invariant natural killer T cell TCR forces microbial glycolipids and CD1d into a conserved binding mode.J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207 (20921281): 2383-239310.1084/jem.20101335Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we also determined the crystal structures of a panel of sphingamides presented by mCD1d and in complex with the Vα14Vβ8.2 TCR (clone 2C12) at resolutions between 2.0 and 2.85 Å (Table S1). The TCR binds above mCD1d in the canonical parallel-binding orientation, with the complementarity-determining region (CDR) 1α sitting above the galactose of the glycolipids and CDR3α binding centered above the F′ pocket of CD1d. CDR3α ]contacted both the glycolipid ligand as well as the F′ roof using the hydrophobic finger Leu-99α (Fig. 6). The electron density of each glycolipid is unambiguous, even in the lower-resolution structures and is a consequence of the TCR stabilizing and locking the binding orientation of the glycolipids inside the CD1d binding groove. A close examination of the CD1d-glycolipid, as well as TCR-glycolipid interactions reveals no differences between the different sphingamides, in contrast to the binary complexes, in which the sphingamides bind differently to mCD1d with respect to the positioning of the amide group in the phytosphingosine-like moiety. The TCR forms the canonical hydrogen-bond interactions, especially Gly-96α with the 2″-OH and Asn-31α with the 3″- and 4″-OH groups of the galactose, whereas Arg-95α contacts Asp-80 of CD1d (Fig. 7). In the ternary complexes, all sphingamides, regardless of whether they contain a central or terminal phenyl attached to the amide group within the phytosphingosine-like moiety, now form an additional H-bond between the hydroxyl of Tyr-73 of CD1d and the amide oxygen of the sphingamides. This suggests that upon TCR binding, the TCR forces each sphingamide into a conserved binding orientation, the hallmark of which is the formation of this novel H-bond interaction. Given the fact that the long-chain sphingamide agonist αGSA[26,6P] has the identical binding orientation in the ternary complex compared with the inactive short-chain sphingamide αGSA[8,6P], we compared the binding orientation before and after TCR binding for all crystallized sphingamides (Fig. 8, A and B). Surprisingly, only the active sphingamide αGSA[26,6P] shows the additional H-bond with Tyr-73 of CD1d in the absence of TCR binding (Fig. 8A), whereas all sphingamides form this H-bond upon TCR binding (Fig. 8B). This led us to speculate that the length of the acyl chain determines the binding orientation of the amide group in the F′ pocket of CD1d and whether or not it is further stabilized by the additional H-bond with Tyr-73. We hypothesize that this interaction forms a molecular switch that affects sphingamide activity. A preformed H-bond (in the absence of TCR) resembl"
