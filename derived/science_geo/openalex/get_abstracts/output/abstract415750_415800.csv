Our proof-of-concept devices are graphene heterostructures with atomically thin boron nitride acting as a tunnel barrier. They exhibit room temperature switching ratios ~50, a value that can be enhanced further by optimizing the device structure. These devices have potential for high frequency operation and large scale integration."

Generally, platinum-based catalysts have performed best in the hydrosilylation reactions that form these bonds, but the expense of the precious metal and, in some cases, by-product formation have motivated a search for alternatives. Tondreau et al. (p. 567 ) now show that a class of iron compounds readily catalyzes hydrosilylation of certain commercially important substrates with rates and selectivities comparable to, or even exceeding, those associated with platinum."

These kinds of surveys can supply a good idea of the dominant organisms in ecosystems, but, because the majority of environmental microbes are difficult to culture and the most abundant organisms swamp metagenomes, it is difficult to discern the functional significance of other contributors. Iverson et al. (p. 587 ) sampled the Puget Sound and developed methods to reconstruct individual genomes from metagenomes, which allowed closure of a genome from the enigmatic marine group II Euryarchaeota . This Archaean is evidently motile, shows signs of extensive gene-swapping with bacteria, and offers some hints to the origin of proteorhodopsin—a molecule that some marine bacteria use to harvest energy from sunlight."

https://openalex.org/W2085743492,"To combat the functional decline of the proteome, cells use the process of protein turnover to replace potentially impaired polypeptides with new functional copies. We found that extremely long-lived proteins (ELLPs) did not turn over in postmitotic cells of the rat central nervous system. These ELLPs were associated with chromatin and the nuclear pore complex, the central transport channels that mediate all molecular trafficking in and out of the nucleus. The longevity of these proteins would be expected to expose them to potentially harmful metabolites, putting them at risk of accumulating damage over extended periods of time. Thus, it is possible that failure to maintain proper levels and functional integrity of ELLPs in nonproliferative cells might contribute to age-related deterioration in cell and tissue function."
https://openalex.org/W2036370098,"The Constant Pollinator In ecology, reinforcement is the process by which species prevent hybridization and maintain species boundaries, but the underlying genetic mechanisms are unclear. Hopkins and Rausher (p. 1090 , published online 2 February) examined reinforcement between two species of a wild flowering plant called Phlox that show incomplete hybrid sterility. Down-regulation of a flavonoid gene produces red flowers and operates in concert with a color intensity locus to adjust flower color and tone. A distinct geography of flower color has emerged in which it appears that dark coloration causes less hybridization between the species because the butterfly pollinators tend to favor light-blue flower color variants. If pollinators visit flowers with similar phenotypes more frequently than flowers with dissimilar phenotypes, this will decrease gene flow between the unlike flowers."

But do quotas or preferential treatment of applicants alter the pool of candidates? Balafoutas and Sutter (p. 579 ; see the Perspective by Villeval ) used an existing laboratory-based task to assess the change in composition of winning candidates and the overall outcome as a function of three affirmative action policies. Policies designed to encourage more women to enter a competitive environment served to recruit enough high-performing individuals to ensure that the efficiency in performing the task was preserved. Beaman et al. (p. 582 , published online 12 January) examined the effects of a constitutionally mandated reservation of village-council and council-leader positions for women in West Bengal after two election cycles (1998 and 2003). The program appeared to narrow the gender gap in aspirations of parents for their children and of children for themselves; in addition, teenage girls spent more time in school and less on household chores. Beliefs and attitudes changed only after the second set of elections—that is, after a longer exposure to female role models—complementing the more rapid policy changes instituted by women council leaders after the first round of elections."
https://openalex.org/W2081977302,"Natural Resistance Avermectins are the most widely used class of anthelmintic drugs, both as pesticides and as treatments for nematode-borne diseases, with the evolution of resistance presenting a major global health and agricultural problem. Ghosh et al. (p. 574 ; see the Perspective by Wolstenholme ) observed resistance to avermectin in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that varies among isolates. This resistance is caused by a naturally occurring four–amino acid deletion in the ligand-binding domain of a glutamate-gated chloride channel. This variant also conferred resistance to the avermectin-producing ubiquitous soil bacterium, Streptomyces zitilis . Many nematodes spend at least part of their life cycle in soil, which may explain avermectin resistance among nematode species."

Kolbe et al. (p. 1086 , published online 2 February; see the cover) tested the relative contributions of selection and founder effects in Bahamian lizards. Founders were taken from an island covered in forest: These lizards had long hindlimbs for sprinting across the broad expanses of tree trunks. Long-limbed lizards were introduced to seven smaller islands covered in scrub that, before hurricane Frances in 2004 swept them away, had been populated by lizards with short hindlimbs better suited for navigating a twiggy habitat. After several generations, all the new lizard populations had adapted to their new habitats by evolving shorter hindlimbs but they also retained other morphological and genetic signatures from their founding ancestors. Thus, evolution occurs by a combination of arbitrary events, as well as those shaped by selection."

https://openalex.org/W2076618616,"The stresses encountered during islet isolation and culture may have deleterious effects on beta-cell physiology. However, the biological response of human islet cells to isolation remains poorly characterized. A better understanding of the network of signaling pathways induced by islet isolation and culturing may lead to strategies aimed at improving islet graft survival and function. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) was used to extract beta-cell RNA from 1) intact pancreatic islets, 2) freshly isolated islets, 3) islets cultured for 3 days, and changes in gene expression were examined by microarray analysis. We identified a strong inflammatory response induced by islet isolation that continues during in-vitro culture manifested by upregulation of several cytokines and cytokine-receptors. The most highly upregulated gene, interleukin-8 (IL-8), was induced by 3.6-fold following islet isolation and 56-fold after 3 days in culture. Immunofluorescence studies showed that the majority of IL-8 was produced by beta-cells themselves. We also observed that several pancreas-specific transcription factors were down-regulated in cultured islets. Concordantly, several pancreatic progenitor cell-specific transcription factors like SOX4, SOX9, and ID2 were upregulated in cultured islets, suggesting progressive transformation of mature beta-cell phenotype toward an immature endocrine cell phenotype. Our findings suggest islet isolation and culture induces an inflammatory response and loss of the mature endocrine cell phenotype. A better understanding of the signals required to maintain a mature beta-cell phenotype may help improve the efficacy of islet transplantation."

Despite a well documented health benefit of resveratrol in intervention of the development of obesity, the role of piceatannol in the development of adipose tissue and related diseases is unknown. Here, we sought to determine the function of piceatannol in adipogenesis and elucidate the underlying mechanism. We show that piceatannol inhibits adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in a dose-dependent manner at noncytotoxic concentrations. This anti-adipogenic property of piceatannol was largely limited to the early event of adipogenesis. In the early phase of adipogenesis, piceatannol-treated preadipocytes displayed a delayed cell cycle entry into G2/M phase at 24 h after initiation of adipogenesis. Furthermore, the piceatannol-suppressed mitotic clonal expansion was accompanied by reduced activation of the insulin-signaling pathway. Piceatannol dose-dependently inhibited differentiation mixture-induced phosphorylation of insulin receptor (IR)/insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)/Akt pathway in the early phase of adipogenesis. Moreover, we showed that piceatannol is an inhibitor of IR kinase activity and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Our kinetics study of IR further identified a Km value for ATP of 57.8 μm and a Ki value for piceatannol of 28.9 μm. We also showed that piceatannol directly binds to IR and inhibits IR kinase activity in a mixed noncompetitive manner to ATP, through which piceatannol appears to inhibit adipogenesis. Taken together, our study reveals an anti-adipogenic function of piceatannol and highlights IR and its downstream insulin signaling as novel targets for piceatannol in the early phase of adipogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2088505684,"Matrix metalloproteinases release intact syndecan-1 ectodomains from the cell surface giving rise to a soluble, shed form of the proteoglycan. Although it is known that shed syndecan-1 controls diverse pathophysiological responses in cancer, wound healing, inflammation, infection, and immunity, the mechanisms regulating shedding remain unclear. We have discovered that the heparan sulfate chains present on syndecan core proteins suppress shedding of the proteoglycan. Syndecan shedding is dramatically enhanced when the heparan sulfate chains are enzymatically degraded or absent from the core protein. Exogenous heparan sulfate or heparin does not inhibit shedding, indicating that heparan sulfate must be attached to the core protein to suppress shedding. Regulation of shedding by heparan sulfate occurs in multiple cell types, for both syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 and in murine and human syndecans. Mechanistically, the loss of heparan sulfate enhances the susceptibility of the core protein to proteolytic cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases. Enhanced shedding of syndecan-1 following loss of heparan sulfate is accompanied by a dramatic increase in core protein synthesis. This suggests that in response to an increase in the rate of shedding, cells attempt to maintain a significant level of syndecan-1 on the cell surface. Together these data indicate that the amount of heparan sulfate present on syndecan core proteins regulates both the rate of syndecan shedding and core protein synthesis. These findings assign new functions to heparan sulfate chains, thereby broadening our understanding of their physiological importance and implying that therapeutic inhibition of heparan sulfate degradation could impact the progression of some diseases.

Syndecan-1 is known predominantly as a cell surface proteoglycan that regulates complex cell behaviors, such as adhesion, motility, invasion, and intracellular signaling. Syndecan-1 performs these diverse functions by acting as a co-receptor for a variety of growth factor receptors or as a binding partner to integrins (1Couchman J.R.

However, syndecan-1 localization is not restricted to the cell surface. It is present in the nucleus where it regulates gene transcription (3Purushothaman A. Hurst D.R. Pisano C. Mizumoto S.

Shed syndecan-1 plays important roles in the pathophysiology of many disease states, including inflammation, microbial pathogenesis, and cancer (4Teng Y.H. Aquino R.S. Park P.W.

For example, in a murine model of acute lung injury, syndecan-1 mediates the inflammatory response by facilitating the formation of a CXC chemokine gradient to enhance transepithelial migration of neutrophils (8Li Q. Park P.W. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C.

In pulmonary fibrosis, reactive oxygen species enhance syndecan-1 shedding, which leads to induction of neutrophil chemotaxis, impaired epithelial wound healing, and increased fibrosis (9Kliment C.R.

The shed syndecan-1 inhibits host-derived antimicrobial peptides and thus is a component of a virulence mechanism that promotes infection (11Park P.W. Pier G.B. Hinkes M.T. Bernfield M.

Shed syndecan-1 can also be measured in the serum of patients with some cancers, including lung cancer and myeloma, where high levels of shed syndecan-1 correlate with poor outcome of the patient (16Joensuu H. Anttonen A. Eriksson M. Mäkitaro R. Alfthan H. Kinnula V. Leppä S.

Although the mechanisms mediating syndecan-1 shedding from the cell surface are not completely understood, shedding occurs via proteolytic cleavage of the core protein close to the cell membrane. Shedding of syndecan-1 occurs constitutively or can be accelerated in response to various agonists (e.g. growth factors, chemokines, microbial toxins, insulin, or cellular stress). These diverse stimuli set off a cascade of molecular events that include signal transduction, intracellular regulators, and, finally, protease activity at the cell surface that cleaves the core protein and releases syndecan-1 (4Teng Y.H. Aquino R.S. Park P.W. Molecular functions of syndecan-1 in disease.Matrix Biol. 2012; 31: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 5Manon-Jensen T. Itoh Y. Couchman J.R. Proteoglycans in health and disease. The multiple roles of syndecan shedding.FEBS J. 2010; 277: 3876-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Intracellularly, activation of protein tyrosine kinases leads to downstream phosphorylation of the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain, an event that may enhance syndecan-1 shedding (18Ott V.L.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In addition, shedding agonists cause dissociation of Rab5 from the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain, which triggers ectodomain shedding (20Hayashida K. Stahl P.D. Park P.W. Syndecan-1 ectodomain shedding is regulated by the small GTPase Rab5.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35435-35444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The actual cleavage of syndecan-1 from the cell surface is accomplished by various metalloproteinases, including MMPs, membrane type MMPs, and ADAMTS (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) (5Manon-Jensen T. Itoh Y. Couchman J.R. Proteoglycans in health and disease. The multiple roles of syndecan shedding.FEBS J. 2010; 277: 3876-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that the action of heparanase, an enzyme that cleaves heparan sulfate chains, stimulates increased syndecan-1 shedding (21Yang Y. Macleod V. Miao H.Q. Theus A. Zhan F. Shaughnessy Jr., J.D. Sawyer J. Li J.P. Zcharia E. Vlodavsky I. Sanderson R.D. Heparanase enhances syndecan-1 shedding. A novel mechanism for stimulation of tumor growth and metastasis.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13326-13333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We found that increased shedding is due at least in part to heparanase-mediated up-regulation of expression of MMP-9 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, two enzymes known to be sheddases of syndecan-1 (22Purushothaman A. Chen L. Yang Y. Sanderson R.D. Heparanase stimulation of protease expression implicates it as a master regulator of the aggressive tumor phenotype in myeloma.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32628-32636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition to up-regulating proteases, heparanase trims heparan sulfate chains of syndecan-1, resulting in a significantly smaller amount of heparan sulfate present on the proteoglycan. However, a role for such reduction in heparan sulfate content leading to shedding has never been tested. In the present study, we demonstrate that this reduction in heparan sulfate amount dramatically accelerates the rate of syndecan-1 shedding and that this can be blocked by inhibitors of MMPs. Thus, heparan sulfate present on syndecan-1 acts to suppress shedding of the ectodomain, possibly by interfering with MMP-mediated cleavage of the core protein. This suppression occurs in multiple cell types, in both human and murine species and for syndecan-4 as well as syndecan-1. We also find that in response to enhanced shedding there is a dramatic increase in synthesis of the core protein of syndecan-1. These data provide new insight into a previously unknown role for the heparan sulfate chains of syndecans.

Sequences were confirmed after each round of PCR by generating DNA with a miniplasmid kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). The plasmids encoding for human wild type SDC1 (syndecan-1) sequence and the sequence for SDC1 mutated at glycosylation sites are referred to as WT hSDC1 and ΔGAG hSDC1, respectively. The murine full-length syndecan-1 gene in pcDNA3.1(−) vector and the TDM clone have been described previously (24Langford J.K. Stanley M.J. Cao D. Sanderson R.D.

TDM refers to a triple deletion mutant (S43A/S45A/S47A) having all heparan sulfate attachment sites removed. The TDM clone was used as the template for additional alanine substitutions at amino acid residues 43, 207, and 217. A FLAG tag with a tobacco etch virus cleavage site was inserted toward the N terminus, after the signal sequence. Phosphorylated mutagenic oligonucleotides for substitution mutagenesis were synthesized by Invitrogen, and the FLAG tag insertion oligonucleotide was synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.

Sequences were confirmed after each round of PCR by generating DNA with a miniplasmid kit (Qiagen). DNA was confirmed by the University of Alabama, Birmingham, CFAR DNA Sequencing and Analysis Core Facility. The plasmids encoding murine wild type syndecan-1 sequence and the sequence for syndecan-1 mutated at glycosylation sites will be referred to as WT mSDC1 and ΔGAG mSDC1, respectively. Prior to transfection of constructs, ARH-77 (2 × 106) cells were plated in 5 ml of fresh complete medium and grown for 24 h. The cells were then transfected with human plasmid or murine WT or ΔGAG SDC1 plasmid using Amaxa NucleofectorTM (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The transfected cells were then selected with Geneticin (G418, Invitrogen), for 7 days. The selected cells were stained for cell surface syndecan-1 expression and sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (as described below) to sort isolate cells expressing similar levels of either the WT or ΔGAG SDC1 protein. The sorted cells were grown for 7 days, and the stable expression and levels of cell surface syndecan-1 were confirmed again by flow cytometry. For FACS or flow cytometry, cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cell pellets were then resuspended in anti-human syndecan-1 (clone BA-38, Cell Sciences, Canton, MA), or anti-mouse syndecan-1 monoclonal antibody (clone 281.2 (25Jalkanen M. Nguyen H. Rapraeger A. Kurn N. Bernfield M. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans from mouse mammary epithelial cells. Localization on the cell surface with a monoclonal antibody.J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar)) diluted in PBS and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells were then washed three times in PBS and incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen) at 4 °C for 1 h. Following incubation, the cells were washed three times in PBS and then resuspended in PBS. For flow cytometry, after staining, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde prior to analysis. Cells stained with appropriate isotype-matched IgG antibodies served as a gating control. Cells in culture were pelleted by centrifugation and washed with PBS twice. Cell pellets were then resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 1× HALT protease inhibitor mixture and incubated on ice for 30 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and the supernatants were removed from the pellets. Proteins isolated from cell lines in the supernatant were quantified by a BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Nytran SPC, Schleicher & Schuell), and probed with goat anti-human syndecan-1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody (GE Healthcare). The levels of actin (loading control) were probed using a β-actin primary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Immunoreactive bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). In all experiments, unless mentioned otherwise, cells were seeded and incubated in serum-free RPMI medium for 1 h prior to the addition of Hep III and/or Chase-ABC. At the end of incubation, cells and cellular debris were separated by centrifuging the conditioned media at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatants were analyzed either by dot blotting or ELISA. For adherent cells (MDA-MB-231, Panc-1, HeLa, and NMuMG), equal numbers were seeded in complete growth medium in a 12-well plate. After overnight incubation, the monolayers were washed with serum-free medium at least twice prior to enzyme treatments. Conditioned medium collected from (a) ARH-77 cells expressing either human or murine wild-type or mutated syndecan-1, (b) NMuMG cells after different treatments, and (c) HeLa cells after glycosidase treatments was processed prior to analyses by dot blotting. The conditioned media were treated with Hep III (1.25 milliunits/ml) and Chase-ABC (12.5 milliunits/ml) at 37 °C for 4 h. This enzymatic digestion ensures that all of the glycosaminoglycan chains from the shed syndecan-1 were removed prior to analyses, and therefore an increase in shedding was determined only by comparing the differences in the level of syndecan-1 core protein between different samples. After processing, the indicated amounts of the conditioned media were blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane using an immunodot apparatus (Milliblot D, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were then fixed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% glutaraldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. After washes in distilled water and TBS, the membranes were blocked in TBS containing 3% nonfat dry milk, 0.5% BSA, and 0.3% Tween 20 (blocking solution) for 1 h. The membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibodies against murine or human syndecan-1 in the blocking solution. After washes in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (washing solution), membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody (GE Healthcare), and immunoreactive bands were detected by chemiluminescence. 5 × 105 CAG cells were seeded in complete growth medium at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were then treated with Hep III (1.25 milliunits/ml) added every 2 h for the next 8 h. Cells treated with water served as a control. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed once with PBS, and RNA was extracted using RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using random hexamer primers and the Maxima® First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas, Hanover, MD) as per the manufacturer's protocol. 25 ng of diluted cDNA was mixed with 2× IQTM SYBR® green supermix (Bio-Rad) along with gene specific primers (200 nm final concentration). The primers used were 5′-TCTGACAACTTCTCCGGCTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCACTTCTGGCAGGACTACA-3′ (reverse) for syndecan-1 and 5′-CGGCGACGACCCATTCGAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAATCGAACCCTGATTCCCCGTC-3′ (reverse) for 18S rRNA. The cycle parameters included initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 55 °C for 60 s, followed by one cycle of 95 °C for 60 s and 55 °C for 60 s. To ensure specific amplification, a melt curve was generated at the end of PCR for each sample. The PCR cycle at which the fluorescence exceeded a set threshold (CT), for each sample was determined by the iCycler software. Data were analyzed according to the comparative CT method, as described previously (26Schmittgen T.D. Livak K.J. Analyzing real-time PCR data by the comparative CT method.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (17269) Google Scholar), using internal control (18S rRNA) transcript levels to normalize differences in sample loading and preparation. The levels of shed syndecan-1 accumulated in the conditioned media after different treatments were assessed by an ELISA using an Eli-pair kit specific for human syndecan-1 core protein (Cell Sciences). The standard curve was linear between 8 and 256 ng/ml, and all samples were diluted to concentrations within that range. All of the samples were run in duplicate. We have previously demonstrated that syndecan-1 shedding by myeloma cells can be enhanced by increasing endogenous heparanase expression or by treating cells with exogenous heparanase or bacterial Hep III (21Yang Y. Macleod V. Miao H.Q. Theus A. Zhan F. Shaughnessy Jr., J.D. Sawyer J. Li J.P. Zcharia E. Vlodavsky I. Sanderson R.D. Heparanase enhances syndecan-1 shedding. A novel mechanism for stimulation of tumor growth and metastasis.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13326-13333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These results suggest that reducing the amount of heparan sulfate present on syndecan-1 enhances shedding of the proteoglycan. To explore this further, equal numbers of CAG cells were treated with increasing amounts of Hep III enzyme to generate cells having syndecan-1 containing high, intermediate, or low levels of heparan sulfate. After treatment with enzyme for 4 h, the cells were harvested, and conditioned medium was collected. Western blots of the cell extracts revealed that with an increase in the amount of Hep III enzyme, there was a decrease in the amount of heparan sulfate present on syndecan-1. This decrease in amount of heparan sulfate is visualized on the Western blots as an increase in syndecan-1 polydispersity and a reduction in the mean molecular size of the proteoglycan (Fig. 1A; note the broadening of the syndecan-1 smear (polydispersity) following treatment with increasing amounts of Hep III and the clear emergence of a low molecular mass fraction of syndecan-1 around 80–95 kDa in cells treated with 2.5 milliunits/ml of Hep III). Although in the Western blot there appear to be much higher levels of syndecan-1 present following Hep III digestion (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1 and 5), quantification of syndecan-1 by ELISA reveals that similar levels of syndecan-1 are present in cell extracts before and after Hep III treatment. 3V. C. Ramani, unpublished observation. We speculate that on Western blots, the high molecular mass form of syndecan-1 either transfers poorly to the membrane or is not as accessible to the anti-syndecan-1 antibody as is the low molecular mass form, thus giving the false impression that the amount of syndecan-1 in the cell fraction increases following Hep III treatment.

https://openalex.org/W2056746270,"Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key process during embryonic development and disease development and progression. During EMT, epithelial cells lose epithelial features and express mesenchymal cell markers, which correlate with increased cell migration and invasion. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a multifunctional cytokine that induces EMT in multiple cell types. The TGF-β pathway is regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs), which are small non-coding RNAs regulating the translation of specific messenger RNAs. Herein, we identified mir-99a and mir-99b as two novel TGF-β target miRNA genes, the expression of which increased during TGF-β induced EMT of NMUMG cells. Mir-99a and mir-99b inhibition decreased TGF-β activity by inhibiting SMAD3 phosphorylation, resulting in decreased migration and increased proliferation in response to TGF-β. However, mir-99a and mir-99b inhibition was insufficient to block TGF-β induced EMT of NMUMG cells. Mir-99a and mir-99b over-expression in epithelial NMUMG cells resulted in increased proliferation, migration and fibronectin expression, while E-cadherin and ZO-1 expression were negatively regulated. In conclusion, we identified mir-99a and mir-99b as two novel modulators of TGF-β pathway that alter SMAD3 phosphorylation, in turn altering cell migration and adhesion of mesenchymal NMUMG cells. The effect of mir-99a and mir-99b over-expression on NMUMUG proliferation is dependent upon the epithelial or mesenchymal status of the cells. Our study suggests that mir-99a and mir-99b may function as modulators within a complex network of factors regulating TGF-β induced breast epithelial to mesenchymal transition, as well as proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells, providing a possible target for future translationally oriented studies in this area."

In the current study we have employed immunocytochemical staining in kidney slices and functional assessments (Ca2+ imaging) in isolated, split-opened, tubule segments to define TRPV4 sites of expression and flow-dependent function in the collecting duct system. Staining patterns revealed strong expression of TRPV4 along the entire collecting duct system with highest levels at the apical (luminal)/subapical region of the principal cells (PCs), the dominant cell type, with more diffuse staining in intercalated cells (ICs). Using fluorescence Ca2+ imaging and the selective TRPV4 agonist, GSK1016790A, we demonstrated functional TRPV4 channels in PCs and ICs of split-opened cortical collecting ducts and connecting tubules. The agonist was ineffective in inducing a rise in [Ca2+]i in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ or in tubules from TRPV4-deficient animals. Most importantly, a 10-fold elevation in luminal (apical) fluid flow induced a rapid and sustained influx of Ca2+ that was abolished by the TRPV channel inhibitor, ruthenium red, or in tubules isolated from TRPV4 deficient animals.

Although it has been anticipated that the channel likely functions to regulate some aspects of fluid and electrolyte balance, it remains perplexing that animals deficient in the TRPV4 gene do not display particularly noted changes in fluid and electrolyte excretion patterns (10.Mizuno A.

Recent studies, however, point to an apparent role of TRPV4 as a sensor of fluid shear stress or fluid flow in renal cells and tissues. Indeed, our laboratory recently demonstrated that endogenous TRPV4 in M-1 collecting duct cells is activated by increases in shear stress/fluid flow, a response that is abolished following siRNA knockdown of TRPV4 (3.Gao X. Wu L. O'Neil R.G. Temperature-modulated diversity of TRPV4 channel gating: activation by physical stresses and phorbol ester derivatives through protein kinase C-dependent and -independent pathways.J. Biol.

Furthermore, Suzuki and co-workers (14.Taniguchi J. Tsuruoka S. Mizuno A. Sato J. Fujimura A. Suzuki M. TRPV4 as a flow sensor in flow-dependent K+ secretion from the cortical collecting duct.Am. J.

These results are consistent with earlier studies demonstrating that elevated flows in both the isolated perfused connecting tubule (CNT) and the immediate downstream segment, the cortical collecting duct (CCD), display flow-induced activation of Ca2+ signaling and/or activation of luminal Ca2+-permeable channels (15.Taniguchi J. Takeda M. Yoshitomi K. Imai M. Pressure- and parathyroid-hormone-dependent Ca2+ transport in rabbit connecting tubule: role of the stretch-activated nonselective cation channel.J.

Hence, it may be that TRPV4 plays a central role in flow-dependent phenomena in the late distal tubule and collecting duct. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the sites of expression and potential function of TRPV4 as a flow sensor/transducer in the mouse collecting duct system. We show that TRPV4 is expressed along the entire length of the collecting duct system, from CNT to papillary collecting duct, with prominent expression near the luminal (apical) border of aquaporin-2-expressing principal cells (PCs) and less pronounced expression levels in intercalated cells (ICs). Further, Ca2+ imaging studies in isolated split-opened CNT and CCD preparations demonstrated specific activation of TRPV4 by the TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A in all cells. Most importantly, high flow rates over the luminal surface led to a rapid and sustained influx of Ca2+ into both PCs and ICs, a response that was abolished in tubules isolated from animals deficient in the TRPV4 gene. It is concluded that TRPV4 is expressed in the collecting duct system where this channel appears to function as a central component of a flow-sensor/transducer in these cells. Segments of CCD and CNT were isolated and prepared from mouse kidney tissue as described previously (17.Mamenko M. Zaika O. Jin M. O'Neil R.G. Pochynyuk O.

Briefly, mice were sacrificed by CO2 administration and immediately subjected to cervical dislocation (the protocol was approved by the Institute for Animal Care and Use Committee of The University of Texas Health Science Center). Kidneys were immediately removed, cut into transverse sections (∼1 mm thick), and placed in ice-cold PBS buffered with HEPES, pH 7.4. Medullary-cortical strips of tubules were first pulled free from the slices with watchmaker forceps and then individual CCD dissected free from surrounding tissue in the mid to upper cortical area under stereomicroscopic examination. Sites of bifurcation of the CCD were used to identify upstream CNT that merge into the CCD. Isolated tubules were moved onto 5 × 5-mm coverslip glass chips coated with poly-l-lysine for attachment. The glass coverslips with attached tubules were then placed on a perfusion chamber mounted on the stage of an inverted Nikon microscope (Eclipse Ti) and the tubule segments split-open with two sharpened micropipettes, each attached to micromanipulators. The split-opened tubules would roll out, flatten, and attach to the treated coverslip allowing direct access to the apical (luminal) border of the cells. The tubule fragments were then loaded with fura-2 and used within 1–2 h of isolation. Standard immunohistochemical procedures were utilized for evaluating TRPV4 expression sites in sections of mouse kidney. Briefly, animals were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation and kidneys prepared by intracardiac perfusion with a clearing solution (20 ml, 0.1 m cacodylate buffer and 4% hydroxyethyl starch in ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4) followed immediately by a fixation solution (20 ml, 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1 m cacodylate buffer in ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4). Kidneys were removed and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, then mounted in tissue freezing medium (Tissue Tek) and frozen at −30 °C. Either sagittal or transverse sections (typically 30 μm thick) were obtained, using an OTF 5000 cryostat (Bright Instrument). Sections were allowed to warm to room temperature and washed in PBS. Sections were then blocked with 1% donkey serum and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody: anti-TRPV4 (1:500; Alomone), anti-AQP2 tagged with ATTO 550 (1:200; Alomone), anti-NCX (Na+:Ca2+ exchanger, 1:500; Swant). Sections were subsequently washed and incubated at room temperature for 3 h with secondary antibody: Cy2 anti-rabbit (1:100–500 Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Cy5 anti-mouse (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch). The tissue was then mounted with VectaShield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and imaged with a Nikon A1 confocal microscope in a manner similar to that used before (3.Gao X. Wu L. O'Neil R.G.

Split-opened CCD tubules were isolated and prepared as described above. Tubules on coverslip chips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, blocked with 1% donkey serum, then incubated with primary antibodies anti-TRPV4 (1:500; Alomone) and anti-AQP2 tagged with ATTO 550 for 3 h at room temperature. Subsequently, tubules were treated with secondary antibody Cy2 anti-rabbit and fluorescein-labeled peanut agglutinin (PNA, 1:1000; Vector Laboratories), an IC marker, for 1–2 h at room temperature. Images were acquired using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope, and measurement of fluorescent intensity was performed with NIS Elements imaging software. Ratiometric fluorescence imaging of fura-2 was used to monitor intracellular calcium levels, [Ca2+rsqb]i, in split-opened tubule preparations using standard procedures as done extensively before (4.Wu L.

Briefly, tubule fragments on coverslip chips were loaded with fura-2/AM (2 μm) for 40 min, washed, placed on the coverslip bottom of an open perfusion chamber (0.5 ml), and imaged with a InCa Imaging Work station (Intracellular Imaging, Inc.) at 37 °C using a 20× Nikon Super Fluor objective. [Ca2+]i was estimated from the fura-2 fluorescence by excitation at 340 nm and 380 nm and calculating the ratio of the emission intensities at 511 nm in the usual manner every 5 s. Results are presented as the emission ratios and denoted F340/F380. In some studies cells were subjected to intracellular fura-2 calibration and the ratios converted to intracellular calcium activity as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (20.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M.

For each treatment group, from 3 to 6 split-opened tubule preparations were typically utilized from which 5–12 cells were assessed for [Ca2+]i levels. The data are typically presented as total number of cells analyzed for each treatment group. Split-opened tubules were typically studied in a control isotonic medium containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm glucose at pH 7.4. Medium with 0 Ca2+ was identical except CaCl2 was removed and replaced with 1 mm EGTA in the control solution. To test the effect of elevating fluid flow rate over the split-opened tubule, the normal perfusion rate through the chamber (volume ∼0.5 ml) was rapidly switched from the control flow rate of 1.5 ml/min (control flow rate) to 15 ml/min (high flow rate) with the gravity-feed perfusion system. Because this was done in an open chamber fluid shear stress could not be calculated because unstirred layers would be present and laminar flow may not be achieved. In some studies, the effect of fluid shear stress on [Ca2+]i was evaluated directly. Shear stress in the collecting duct system can range from <0.5 dyne/cm2 to >20 dynes/cm2 with typical values near 1–10 dynes/cm2 (see Refs. 4.Wu L. Gao X. Brown R.C. Heller S. O'Neil R.G.

To evaluate the response of our split-opened tubule to “physiological” shear stress (1 and 3 dynes/cm2), we performed a few experiments in fura-2-loaded split-opened CCDs studied in a parallel plate chamber (LFR-25 chamber; C & L Instruments). Split-opened tubules were attached to the bottom coverslip (poly-l-lysine-coated) of a parallel plate chamber and placed on an inverted microscope which allowed monitoring of [Ca2+]i as described previously (see Refs. 4.Wu L. Gao X. Brown R.C. Heller S. O'Neil R.G. Dual role of the TRPV4 channel as a sensor of flow and osmolality in renal epithelial cells.Am. J. Physiol.

Flow rates through the chamber were controlled by a peristaltic pump to set the shear stress level. The following drugs and chemicals were used in the study: GSK1016790A (GSK101; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, stock solution, 10 μm in dimethyl sulfoxide), ruthenium red (RuR; Sigma-Aldrich, in PBS), and EGTA (Sigma). Data are presented as mean values ± S.E. Student's t test or ANOVA was used to test for statistical significance, as appropriate, with p < 0.05 considered significant. To identify the sites of expression of TRPV4 in the collecting duct system, mouse kidney sections were immunostained for TRPV4, AQP2 (a marker of PCs), and NCX (Na+:Ca2+ exchanger, a marker of the immediate upstream segment of the CNT, the distal convoluted tubule (DCT)) (21.Loffing J. Loffing-Cueni D. Valderrabano V. Kläusli L. Hebert S.C. Rossier B.C. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Kaissling B.

Nephrol. 2004; 15: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). As shown in the thick sections (30 μm) in Fig. 1A, TRPV4 was strongly expressed in both the cortex and medulla. However, staining was restricted to the AQP2-positive segments throughout the medulla and cortex. No TRPV4 staining was observed in the earlier nephron segments from glomerulus to DCT. An expanded view of the outer cortex revealed strong staining in both the CNT and CCD as shown in Fig. 1B. The figure shows a bifurcated AQP2-positive segment reflecting two CNTs merging into one CCD. As is apparent, TRPV4 was expressed in both segments and displayed strong co-localization with AQP2, reflecting the PC, as demonstrated by the merged image (Fig. 1B, Merge). In addition, a few cells in the merged image stained lightly for TRPV4, but not AQP2, as evident by the green pattern of staining, reflecting localization of TRPV4 in ICs. Further, in an outer cortical view of an apparent CNT (weak NCX staining, AQP2-positive), an adjacent DCT was identified by the strong NCX-positive and AQP2-negative staining (Fig. 1C), but did not show any evidence of TRPV4 expression. To verify the TRPV4 specificity of our antibody for TRPV4, in separate studies we have demonstrated that our antibody (directed at the C terminus, Alomone Laboratory anti-TRPV4) recognized an appropriate double band (∼100 kDa) for TRPV4 in TRPV4-transfected HEK cells, but not in nontransfected HEK cells (19.Jin M. Wu Z. Chen L. Jaimes J. Collins D. Walters E.T. O'Neil R.G. Determinants of TRPV4 activity following selective activation by small molecule agonist GSK1016790A.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e16713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry and functional assays confirmed identification of TRPV4 only in the TRPV4-expressing cells. Further, in a separate study, a previously characterized second anti-TRPV4 antibody targeting the N terminus of TRPV4 was used to stain mouse kidney thin sections (5 μm) (4.Wu L. Gao X. Brown R.C. Heller S. O'Neil R.G. Dual role of the TRPV4 channel as a sensor of flow and osmolality in renal epithelial cells.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F1699-F1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Using a thin section, strong anti-TRPV4 binding of this second antibody was apparent along the luminal border of a CCD as shown in Fig. 1B (Inset). Finally, in kidney sections from TRPV4 knock-out animals no apparent anti-TRPV4 binding was detected (Fig. 1D). Hence, TRPV4 expression appears to be limited to all AQP2-positive segments of the collecting duct system. To provide a functional assessment of TRPV4 in the collecting duct system, CNT and CCD tubule segments were hand-dissected and split open to gain access to the luminal cell border as done before (17.Mamenko M.

To activate TRPV4 selectively, we took advantage of the TRPV4 agonist, GSK101, to demonstrate specific activation of TRPV4 (19.Jin M. Wu Z. Chen L. Jaimes J. Collins D. Walters E.T. O'Neil R.G.

As shown in Fig. 2A, addition of 50 nm GSK101 to the split-opened CCD induced a sustained rise in [Ca2+]i consistent with activation of TRPV4. The GSK101-induced time course of [Ca2+]i was relatively slow, typically reaching a peak value within 1–6 min. The results are consistent with our earlier characterization of GSK101 in TRPV4-transfected HeLa cells and in the M-1 collecting duct cells which endogenously express TRPV4 (19.Jin M. Wu Z. Chen L. Jaimes J. Collins D. Walters E.T. O'Neil R.G.

O'Neil R.G. Cell Calcium. 2012; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the responses of individual cells from a single split-opened CCD demonstrates variable responses from cell to cell that are likely reflective of the individual properties and TRPV4 expression levels of different cells from a single tubule (Fig. 2B). Regardless, the average response to GSK101 addition was very substantial with [Ca2+]i increasing from a control value of near 90 ± 5 nm to 476 ± 35 nm at the peak (Fig. 2E). Further, the response to GSK101 was poorly reversible upon GSK101 washout (Fig. 2C) and was typically only apparent upon exposure of cells to low concentrations of GSK101 and for short exposure times, although this concept remains to be fully tested. Finally, to provide further insight into the actions of GSK101, GSK101 was added when extracellular Ca2+ was removed, 0 [Ca2+]. Indeed, in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, GSK101 addition did not produce an increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2D) demonstrating that GSK101 addition led to activation of Ca2+ influx and not release from intracellular Ca2+ stores (Fig. 2D). These results are consistent with our earlier studies in TRPV4-HeLa cells showing that the response to GSK101 was dependent upon the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (19.Jin M. Wu Z. Chen L. Jaimes J.

Most importantly, in tubules isolated from animals lacking TRPV4, the response to GSK101 was completely abolished (Fig. 2, C, Trace 2, and E). Hence, the effect of GSK101 appears to reflect specific"

https://openalex.org/W1994077022,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging mosquito borne alphavirus that has caused large scale epidemics in the countries around the Indian Ocean, as well as leading to autochthonous transmission in some European countries. The transmission of the disease has been driven by the emergence of an African lineage of CHIKV with enhanced transmission and dissemination in Aedes mosquito hosts. Two main genotypes of this lineage have been circulating, characterized by the presence of a substitution of a valine for an alanine at position 226 of the E1 protein. The outbreak, numbering in millions of cases in the infected areas, has been associated with increasing numbers of cases with non-classical presentation including encephalitis and meningitis. This study sought to compare the original Ross strain with two isolates from the recent outbreak of chikungunya fever in respect of infectivity and the induction of apoptosis in eight mammalian cell lines and two insect cell lines, in addition to generating a comprehensive virus production profile for one of the newer isolates. Results showed that in mammalian cells there were few differences in either tropism or pathogenicity as assessed by induction of apoptosis with the exception of Hela cells were the recent valine isolate showed less infectivity. The Aedes albopictus C6/36 cell line was however significantly more permissive for both of the more recent isolates than the Ross strain. The results suggest that the increased infectivity seen in insect cells derives from an evolution of the CHIKV genome not solely associated with the E1:226 substitution."
https://openalex.org/W2049192443,"Restriction of behavioral opportunities and uneven use of space are considerable welfare concerns in modern broiler production, particularly when birds are kept at high densities. We hypothesized that increased environmental complexity by provision of barrier perches would help address these issues by encouraging perching and enhancing use of the pen space across a range of stocking densities. 2,088 day-old broiler chicks were randomly assigned to one of the following barrier and density treatment combinations over four replications: simple barrier, complex barrier, or control (no barrier) and low (8 birds/m2), moderate (13 birds/m2), or high (18 birds/m2) density. Data were collected on focal birds via instantaneous scan sampling from 2 to 6 weeks of age. Mean estimates per pen for percent of observations seen performing each behavior, as well as percent of observations in the pen periphery vs. center, were quantified and submitted to an analysis of variance with week as the repeated measure. Barrier perches, density and age affected the behavioral time budget of broilers. Both simple and complex barrier perches effectively stimulated high perching rates. Aggression and disturbances were lower in both barrier treatments compared to controls (P<0.05). Increasing density to 18 birds/m2 compared to the lower densities suppressed activity levels, with lower foraging (P<0.005), decreased perching (P<0.0001) and increased sitting (P = 0.001) earlier in the rearing period. Disturbances also increased at higher densities (P<0.05). Use of the central pen area was higher in simple barrier pens compared to controls (P<0.001), while increasing density above 8 birds/m2 suppressed use of the central space (P<0.05). This work confirms some negative effects of increasing density and suggests that barrier perches have the potential to improve broiler welfare by encouraging activity (notably by providing accessible opportunities to perch), decreasing aggression and disturbances, and promoting more even distribution of birds throughout the pen space."
https://openalex.org/W2158900287,"The Hypoxia-inducible transcription Factor (HIF) represents an important adaptive mechanism under hypoxia, whereas sustained activation may also have deleterious effects. HIF activity is determined by the oxygen regulated α-subunits HIF-1α or HIF-2α. Both are regulated by oxygen dependent degradation, which is controlled by the tumor suppressor “von Hippel-Lindau” (VHL), the gatekeeper of renal tubular growth control. HIF appears to play a particular role for the kidney, where renal EPO production, organ preservation from ischemia-reperfusion injury and renal tumorigenesis are prominent examples. Whereas HIF-1α is inducible in physiological renal mouse, rat and human tubular epithelia, HIF-2α is never detected in these cells, in any species. In contrast, distinct early lesions of biallelic VHL inactivation in kidneys of the hereditary VHL syndrome show strong HIF-2α expression. Furthermore, knockout of VHL in the mouse tubular apparatus enables HIF-2α expression. Continuous transgenic expression of HIF-2α by the Ksp-Cadherin promotor leads to renal fibrosis and insufficiency, next to multiple renal cysts. In conclusion, VHL appears to specifically repress HIF-2α in renal epithelia. Unphysiological expression of HIF-2α in tubular epithelia has deleterious effects. Our data are compatible with dedifferentiation of renal epithelial cells by sustained HIF-2α expression. However, HIF-2α overexpression alone is insufficient to induce tumors. Thus, our data bear implications for renal tumorigenesis, epithelial differentiation and renal repair mechanisms."

An important issue for understanding the physics of the early spin evolution of millisecond pulsars is the impact of the expanding magnetosphere during the terminal stages of the mass-transfer process. Here I report binary stellar evolution calculations that show that the braking torque acting on a neutron star, when the companion star decouples from its Roche-lobe, is able to dissipate >50% of the rotational energy of the pulsar. This effect may explain the apparent difference in observed spin distributions between x-ray and radio millisecond pulsars and help account for the noticeable age discrepancy with their young white dwarf companions."
https://openalex.org/W2035043745,"Limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2H (LGMD2H) is an inherited autosomal recessive disease of skeletal muscle caused by a mutation in the TRIM32 gene. Currently its pathogenesis is entirely unclear. Typically the regeneration process of adult skeletal muscle during growth or following injury is controlled by a tissue specific stem cell population termed satellite cells. Given that TRIM32 regulates the fate of mammalian neural progenitor cells through controlling their differentiation, we asked whether TRIM32 could also be essential for the regulation of myogenic stem cells. Here we demonstrate for the first time that TRIM32 is expressed in the skeletal muscle stem cell lineage of adult mice, and that in the absence of TRIM32, myogenic differentiation is disrupted. Moreover, we show that the ubiquitin ligase TRIM32 controls this process through the regulation of c-Myc, a similar mechanism to that previously observed in neural progenitors. Importantly we show that loss of TRIM32 function induces a LGMD2H-like phenotype and strongly affects muscle regeneration in vivo. Our studies implicate that the loss of TRIM32 results in dysfunctional muscle stem cells which could contribute to the development of LGMD2H."
https://openalex.org/W2065587766,"The Forkhead transcription factor FoxO1 inhibits through its expression in osteoblasts β-cell proliferation, insulin secretion, and sensitivity. At least part of the FoxO1 metabolic functions result from its ability to suppress the activity of osteocalcin, an osteoblast-derived hormone favoring glucose metabolism and energy expenditure. In searching for mechanisms mediating the metabolic actions of FoxO1, we focused on ATF4, because this transcription factor also affects glucose metabolism through its expression in osteoblasts. We show here that FoxO1 co-localizes with ATF4 in the osteoblast nucleus, and physically interacts with and promotes the transcriptional activity of ATF4. Genetic experiments demonstrate that FoxO1 and ATF4 cooperate to increase glucose levels and decrease glucose tolerance. These effects result from a synergistic effect of the two transcription factors to suppress the activity of osteocalcin through up-regulating expression of the phosphatase catalyzing osteocalcin inactivation. As a result, insulin production by β-cells and insulin signaling in the muscle, liver and white adipose tissue are compromised and fat weight increases by the FoxO1/ATF4 interaction. Taken together these observations demonstrate that FoxO1 and ATF4 cooperate in osteoblasts to regulate glucose homeostasis."

A huge amount of effort has been devoted to investigating the mechanism of TG2 secretion, but how it reaches the cell surface and is then translocated into the ECM is still unknown. Evidence suggests that TG2 is externalized via an unconventional secretion pathway, which may involve endosome binding (3Zemskov E.A. Mikhailenko I. Hsia R.C. Zaritskaya L. Belkin A.M. Unconventional secretion of tissue transglutaminase involves phospholipid-dependent delivery into recycling endosomes.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e19414Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and association with the cell surface receptors and/or the ECM protein fibronectin (FN) (4Gaudry C.A. Verderio E. Aeschlimann D. Cox A. Smith C. Griffin M. Cell surface localization of tissue transglutaminase is dependent on a fibronectin-binding site in its N-terminal β-sandwich domain.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30707-30714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Once externalized, the enzyme can be deposited into the ECM where it forms a hetero-complex with FN and facilitates cell adhesion via an RGD-independent pathway, which during wound healing and matrix turnover can rescue RGD peptide-induced anoikis and subsequent loss of FN deposition through a syndecan-4/2 and α5β1 integrin signaling pathway (5Wang Z.

However, in many pathological conditions, the continuous deposition of TG2 into the matrix results in increased protein cross-linking leading to the onset of and progression of tissue fibrosis and scarring, celiac disease, tumor metastases, and multiple sclerosis (1Iismaa S.E.

Interestingly, cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), for which TG2 has a high affinity binding, are also shed from the cell surface and can be deposited into the matrix where, like TG2, they are associated with a number of similar physiological and pathological conditions such as bone growth and development (8Mahtouk K.

Sci. 2010; 93: 179-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The HSPG family is composed of four major syndecans, syndecans 1–4, of which syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 are major resources for shedding into the ECM. By activation of cell surface matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), in particular MMP-9, the HS-loaded syndecan ectodomain can be cleaved and in turn deposited into ECM (12Brule S. Charnaux N. Sutton A. Ledoux D. Chaigneau T. Saffar L. Gattegno L. The shedding of syndecan-4 and syndecan-1 from HeLa cells and human primary macrophages is accelerated by SDF-1/CXCL12 and mediated by the matrix metalloproteinase-9.Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 488-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to identify the HS-binding site within the TG2 molecule, to demonstrate the importance of this binding site in the translocation of TG2 into the ECM, and to elucidate the mechanism(s) involved. Finally, using a mimicking peptide resembling the HS binding domain on TG2 demonstrate directly the importance of this binding site in triggering syndecan-4-mediated intracellular signaling pathways that rescue cells from the stress-related RGD peptide-induced loss of cell adhesion.

Transfected cells were grown for 48 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere to allow expression prior to analysis. The HP genome-wide siRNA sequence targeting human syndecan-4 (SI00046816) (5Wang Z. Telci D. Griffin M.

The target sequences are non-homologues for any other syndecan types or cell surface receptors. The transfection was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 3 × 105 cells/well HOB or tet-inducible Swiss 3T3 cells were seeded into 6-well plates for 24 h to reach 50–80% confluency. 150 ng of siRNAs were used for each transfection by using HiPerFect transfection reagents. Following 30–48 h siRNA transfection, cells were used in cell adhesion assays (5Wang Z. Telci D. Griffin M.

Lysates containing 50 μg of protein were dissolved in 2× Laemmli buffer (Sigma) and separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed using specific primary antibodies as described above. Primary antibodies were detected using the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Detection was performed by using ECL chemiluminescence (ECLTM Western blotting system, GE Healthcare), where applicable α-tubulin was used for normalization of protein loadings using densitometry. Cell surface proteins were labeled by biotinylation as described previously (6Wang Z. Collighan R.J. Gross S.R. Danen E.H. Orend G. Telci D. Griffin M.

Briefly, cell monolayers were rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS, pH 8.0, and labeled with 0.8 mm sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin dissolved in PBS, pH 8.0, at 4 °C for 20 min. Cells were then washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and lysed with 1% SDS at 4 °C in PBS, pH 8.0. Following denaturation at 95 °C, cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 20 °C, and 200 μg of protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C with NeutrAvidin-agarose resin. After washing three times with PBS, pH 8.0, the biotin-labeled proteins were dissolved in 2× Laemmli buffer separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting. Cell surface levels of TG2 shown were normalized, using densitometry, to the total cell lysate values after the latter had been corrected for protein loading using α-tubulin. The WT cells were used as the 100% control. Value shown represents the mean values from two separate experiments unless stated otherwise. Following transfection, cells were incubated for 24 h with 10% (v/v) serum, which was replaced with 1% (v/v) serum, and TG2 expression and matrix deposition allowed to proceed for a further 24 h were then detached with 2 mm EDTA in PBS, pH 7.4, and the ECM was extracted with 0.1% (w/v) deoxycholate in PBS, pH 7.4. The residual deoxycholate-insoluble ECM proteins were dissolved in 2× Laemmli buffer for further analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using Cub7402. To detect the presence of TG2 in the ECM of TG2 transfected tet-inducible Swiss 3T3 cells, the cells were seeded into 6-well plates at the density of 3 × 105 cell/well. TG2 expression was induced by withdrawing tetracycline from the culture system (tet− cells), whereas cells cultured in the presence of tetracycline (tet+ cells) were used as the control. After induction of TG2 expression in the presence of certain treatments for 48 h, the cells were lifted with 2 mm EDTA in PBS, pH 7.4, lysed in cell lysis buffer, and used as the cell lysate fractions. The ECM fractions were washed once and collected into 2× Laemmli buffer. Western blotting was performed to detect the target proteins by using specific antibodies. The treatments included the following: general MMP inhibitor GM6001, MMP-2/9 inhibitor, MMP-3 inhibitor, and MMP-8 inhibitor at the concentration of 10 μm, 10 μg/ml heparin, 15 milliunits/ml heparinase or chondroitinase, 0.5 μm PMA or 5 μm PKCα inhibitor Go6976. Matrix levels of TG2 shown were normalized to the total cell lysate values using densitometry after the latter was corrected for protein loading using α-tubulin. The WT cells or for the Swiss 3T3 cells the untreated cells were used as the 100% control with values shown represented as a percentage of this. Values shown represent the mean values from two separate experiments unless stated otherwise. To detect the presence of the shed syndecan-4 ectodomain in the ECM, modified dot blotting was applied. Briefly, tet-inducible 3T3 cells were seeded into 12-well plates at the density of 2 × 105 cells/well and induced for TG2 expression for 48 h with the treatments (including PMA, Go6976, and the MMP-2/9 inhibitor) as described for TG2. The matrix fractions were then collected as described for the matrix TG2 and then dissolved into 2× Laemmli buffer. The ECM fractions containing equal amounts of protein were then loaded onto nitrocellulose membranes under vacuum using a dot blotter, washed, and blocked with blocking buffer (5% (w/v) dried fat-free milk dissolved in TBS/Tween, pH 7.4), and the presence of syndecan-4 was detected by immunoprobing with a specific antibody recognizing the ectodomain of syndecan-4. Microtiter 96-well plates were coated with 50 μl of 5 μg/ml FN in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 4 °C overnight. The wells were blocked for 30 min with 3% BSA in PBS, pH 7.4, and washed twice with PBS/Tween, pH 7.4, and once with PBS, pH 7.4. Aliquots (100 μl) of cell lysate containing 60 μg of protein were added to the FN-coated wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing three times with PBS, pH 7.4, wells were blocked with 100 μl of 3% BSA in PBS, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with 100 μl of Cub7402 (1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer) for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing three times with PBS, pH 7.4, the wells were incubated with 100 μl of rabbit anti-mouse IgG-HRP-conjugated antibody (1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer) for 2 h at 37 °C. HRP was detected by the addition of 100 μl of o-phenylenediamine substrate solution (Fast OPD, Sigma). Color development was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 2.5 m H2SO4, and absorbance at 490 nm was measured. The amount of TG2/mutant TG2 binding to the FN was normalized between samples by using the densitometry values from Western blotting for the TG protein found in each of the cell lysates used. α-Tubulin was used to normalize for any differences in protein loading. 96-Well Microtiter plates were coated overnight with either full-length FN (5 μg/ml) or its N-terminal fragments of 45-kDa (54 μg/ml) or 70-kDa (45 μg/ml) that contain the TG2-binding site, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, as described previously (6Wang Z.

After three washes with PBS, pH 7.4, competitive peptides diluted in PBS, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, were added to the wells at concentrations from 10 μm to 1 mm and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Wells were washed three times with PBS, pH 7.4, and purified human recombinant TG2 was added at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml in the presence of the different concentrations of P2 or P2s peptides and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, pH 7.4, bound TG2 was measured via ELISA as introduced above. For the binding ability of TG2 when in either the fully closed or open conformation, gplTG (20 mg/ml) was reduced by preincubation with 1 mm DTT and then diluted (at least 20-fold) in PBS, pH 7.4. The reduced gplTG 20 μg/ml was preincubated with 1 mm GTP or GTPγS (closed conformation) or TG2 site-directed irreversible inhibitors R281 or R283 (extended conformation) at the concentration of 500 μm (in the presence of 10 mm Ca2+) at room temperature for 30 min. Treated enzymes were then incubated with the FN-coated wells at 37 °C for 1 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 20 μg/ml gplTG in 2 mm EDTA in PBS, pH 7.4, was used as the positive control, and 2 mm EDTA in PBS, pH 7.4, was used as the negative control. TG2 bound to FN was detected via ELISA as described. Values represent the mean ± S.D. absorbance at 450 nm from three experiments. HEK cells, transiently transfected with wild type and mutant TG2, were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, and lysed by the addition of 150 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4. After clarification by centrifugation (300 × g for 10 min), cell lysates were mixed with 450 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5, and applied to a 5-ml heparin-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5 (buffer), at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For the analysis of GTP-bound TG2 (closed conformation), lysates were preincubated for 1 h at room temperature with 0.5 mm GTP in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5. For the analysis of inhibitor-reacted TG2 (open conformation), lysates were incubated with 0.5 mm irreversible inhibitor R281 (20Griffin M. Mongeot A. Collighan R. Saint R.E. Jones R.A. Coutts I.G.

The column was washed with 25 ml of buffer, and protein was eluted with a linear gradient of increasing NaCl concentrations (0–1 m) in buffer. Fractions were assayed for TG2 activity and analyzed for the presence of TG2 antigen by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using Cub7402. TG activity in column fractions was measured by biotin X-cadaverine incorporation into N,N′-dimethylcasein as described previously (21Jones R.A. Nicholas B. Mian S. Davies P.J. Griffin M.

After coating the wells with 100 μl of 10 mg/ml N,N′-dimethylcasein in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, plates were washed with TBS/Tween, pH 7.6, and TBS, pH 7.6, and 50 μl of column flow-through as well as each eluted fraction were added into the coated wells. Additionally, 50 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 mm biotin X-cadaverine, 10 mm DTT, 20 mm CaCl2 (or 5 mm EDTA as control) was added into each well. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 °C. The plate was then washed once with TBS/Tween, pH 7.6, and TBS, pH 7.6, before being blocked with 100 μl of 3% (w/v) BSA in TBS, pH 7.6, for 30 min at 37 °C. After another wash, biotin X-cadaverine incorporation into N,N′-dimethylcasein was detected by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with 100 μl of Extravidin-peroxidase (Sigma) diluted 1:2000 in 3% (w/v) BSA in TBS, pH 7.6. After another set of washes, TG2 activity was measured using Sigma Fast OPD, and tablets were dissolved in 20 ml of distilled H2O. The color was developed by adding 2.5 m H2SO4, and the absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a microplate reader. For cell lysates the incorporation of biotin-X-cadaverine into FN as described previously was used (21Jones R.A. Nicholas B. Mian S. Davies P.J. Griffin M.

https://openalex.org/W1988263082,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans, present on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix, interact with growth factors and morphogens to influence growth and differentiation of cells. The sulfation pattern of the heparan sulfate chains formed during biosynthesis in the Golgi compartment will determine the interaction potential of the proteoglycan. The glucosaminyl N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST) enzymes have a key role during biosynthesis, greatly influencing total sulfation of the heparan sulfate chains. The differentiation potential of mouse embryonic stem cells lacking both NDST1 and NDST2 was studied using in vitro differentiation protocols, expression of differentiation markers, and assessment of the ability of the cells to respond to growth factors. The results show that NDST1 and NDST2 are dispensable for mesodermal differentiation into osteoblasts but necessary for induction of adipocytes and neural cells. Gene expression analysis suggested a differentiation block at the primitive ectoderm stage. Also, GATA4, a primitive endoderm marker, was expressed by these cells. The addition of FGF4 or FGF2 together with heparin rescued the differentiation potential to neural progenitors and further to mature neurons and glia. Our results suggest that the embryonic stem cells lacking both NDST1 and NDST2, expressing a very low sulfated heparan sulfate, can take the initial step toward differentiation into all three germ layers. Except for their potential for mesodermal differentiation into osteoblasts, the cells are then arrested in a primitive ectoderm and/or endoderm stage."
https://openalex.org/W2065273292,"Lineage Identity Segregation of endoderm and mesoderm lineages is a fundamental event in early embryogenesis. Using sea urchin embryos, Sethi et al. (p. 590 ) found that Notch and canonical Wnt pathways crosstalk progressively partitions the endomesoderm to discrete endoderm and mesoderm fates. This three-step signaling exchange demonstrates how the timing of signaling crosstalk is regulated in vivo through temporally and spatially staggered genetic circuits that intersect only at specific developmental stages."
https://openalex.org/W2027614330,"Human glucokinase (GK) is a principal regulating sensor of plasma glucose levels. Mutations that inactivate GK are linked to diabetes, and mutations that activate it are associated with hypoglycemia. Unique kinetic properties equip GK for its regulatory role: although it has weak basal affinity for glucose, positive cooperativity in its binding of glucose causes a rapid increase in catalytic activity when plasma glucose concentrations rise above euglycemic levels. In clinical trials, small molecule GK activators (GKAs) have been efficacious in lowering plasma glucose and enhancing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, but they carry a risk of overly activating GK and causing hypoglycemia. The theoretical models proposed to date attribute the positive cooperativity of GK to the existence of distinct protein conformations that interconvert slowly and exhibit different affinities for glucose. Here we report the respective crystal structures of the catalytic complex of GK and of a GK-glucose complex in a wide open conformation. To assess conformations of GK in solution, we also carried out small angle x-ray scattering experiments. The results showed that glucose dose-dependently converts GK from an apo conformation to an active open conformation. Compared with wild type GK, activating mutants required notably lower concentrations of glucose to be converted to the active open conformation. GKAs decreased the level of glucose required for GK activation, and different compounds demonstrated distinct activation profiles. These results lead us to propose a modified mnemonic model to explain cooperativity in GK. Our findings may offer new approaches for designing GKAs with reduced hypoglycemic risk."

https://openalex.org/W1980648331,"COPII proteins are essential for exporting most cargo molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum. The membrane-facing surface of the COPII proteins (especially SEC23-SEC24) interacts directly or indirectly with the cargo molecules destined for exit. As we characterized the SEC23A mutations at the SEC31 binding site identified from patients with cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia, we discovered that the SEC23-SEC31 interface can also influence cargo selection. Remarkably, M702V SEC23A does not compromise COPII assembly, vesicle size, and packaging of cargo molecules into COPII vesicles that we have tested but induces accumulation of procollagen in the endoplasmic reticulum when expressed in normal fibroblasts. We observed that M702V SEC23A activates SAR1B GTPase more than wild-type SEC23A when SEC13-SEC31 is present, indicating that M702V SEC23A causes premature dissociation of COPII from the membrane. Our results indicate that a longer stay of COPII proteins on the membrane is required to cargo procollagen than other molecules and suggest that the SEC23-SEC31 interface plays a critical role in capturing various cargo molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1964143497,"Background Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and their receptors, such as bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR) II, have been implicated in a wide variety of disorders including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Similarly, endothelin-1 (ET-1), a mitogen and vasoconstrictor, is upregulated in PAH and endothelin receptor antagonists are used in its treatment. We sought to determine whether there is crosstalk between BMP signalling and the ET-1 axis in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs), possible mechanisms involved in such crosstalk and functional consequences thereof. Methodology/Principal Finding Using western blot, real time RT-PCR, ELISA and small RNA interference methods we provide evidence that in HPAECs BMP-9, but not BMP-2, -4 and -6 significantly stimulated ET-1 release under physiological concentrations. This release is mediated by both Smad1 and p38 MAPK and is independent of the canonical Smad4 pathway. Moreover, knocking down the ALK1 receptor or BMPR II attenuates BMP-9 stimulated ET-1 release, whilst causing a significant increase in prepro ET-1 mRNA transcription and mature peptide release. Finally, BMP-9 induced ET-1 release is involved in both inhibition of endothelial cell migration and promotion of tubule formation. Conclusions/Significance Although our data does not support an important role for BMP-9 as a source of increased endothelial ET-1 production seen in human PAH, BMP-9 stimulated ET-1 production is likely to be important in angiogenesis and vascular stability. However, increased ET-1 production by endothelial cells as a consequence of BMPR II dysfunction may be clinically relevant in the pathogenesis of PAH."

The aim of the study was to determine factors associated with CTX-M- producing E. coli infections among patients hospitalised in the Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, the largest hospital system in France (23 000 beds), through a prospective case-control-control study. Methods/Principal Findings From November 2008 to June 2009, 152 inpatients with a clinical sample positive for CTX-M-producing E. coli (cases), 152 inpatients with a clinical sample positive for non ESBL-producing E. coli on the day or within the three days following case detection (controls C1), and 152 inpatients with culture-negative clinical samples since the beginning of hospitalisation and until three days after case detection (controls C2) were included in ten hospitals of the Paris area. Factors studied were related to patient's origin, lifestyle and medical history as well as care during hospitalisation. Those independently associated with CTX-M-producing E. coli were determined. Three independent factors were common to the two case-control comparisons: birth outside of Europe (cases vs C1: OR1 = 2.4; 95%CI = [1.3–4.5] and cases vs C2: OR2 = 3.1; 95%CI = [1.4–7.0]), chronic infections (OR1 = 2.9; 95%CI = [1.3–6.9] and OR2 = 8.7; 95%CI = [2.0–39.7]), and antibiotic treatment between hospital admission and inclusion (OR1 = 2.0; 95%CI = [1.0–3.8] and OR2 = 3.3; 95%CI = [1.5–7.2]). Cases were also more likely to be (i) functionally dependent before hospitalisation than C2 (OR2 = 7.0; 95%CI = [2.1–23.5]) and (ii) living in collective housing before hospitalisation than C2 (OR2 = 15.2; 95%CI = [1.8–130.7]) when CTX-M-producing E. coli was present at admission. Conclusion For the first time, patient's origin and lifestyle were demonstrated to be independently associated with isolation of CTX-M-producing E. coli, in addition to health care-related factors."
https://openalex.org/W2085637833,"DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) becomes activated in response to DNA double strand breaks, initiating repair by the non-homologous end joining pathway. DNA·PK complexes with the regulatory subunit SAPSR1 (R1) of protein phosphatase-6 (PP6). Knockdown of either R1 or PP6c prevents DNA-PK activation in response to ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage and radiosensitizes glioblastoma cells. Here, we demonstrate that R1 is necessary for and bridges the interaction between DNA-PK and PP6c. Using R1 deletion mutants, DNA-PK binding was mapped to two distinct regions of R1 spanning residues 1-326 and 522-700. Either region expressed alone was sufficient to bind DNA-PK, but only deletion of residues 1-326, not 522-700, eliminated interaction of R1 with DNA-PK. We assign 1-326 as the dominant domain and 522-700 as the supporting region. These results demonstrate that R1 acts as a bidentate anchor to DNA-PK and recruits PP6c. Targeting the dominant interface with small molecule or peptidomimetic inhibitors could specifically prevent activation of DNA-PK and thereby sensitize cells to ionizing radiation and other genotoxic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2054110614,"Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a rare bone marrow failure syndrome in which hematopoietic defects are the main cause of mortality. The most studied gene responsible for DC pathogenesis is DKC1 while mutations in several other genes encoding components of the H/ACA RNP telomerase complex, which is involved in ribosomal RNA(rRNA) processing and telomere maintenance, have also been implicated. GAR1/nola1 is one of the four core proteins of the H/ACA RNP complex. Through comparative analysis of morpholino oligonucleotide induced knockdown of dkc1 and a retrovirus insertion induced mutation of GAR1/nola1 in zebrafish, we demonstrate that hematopoietic defects are specifically recapitulated in these models and that these defects are significantly reduced in a p53 null mutant background. We further show that changes in telomerase activity are undetectable at the early stages of DC pathogenesis but rRNA processing is clearly defective. Our data therefore support a model that deficiency in dkc1 and nola1 in the H/ACA RNP complex likely contributes to the hematopoietic phenotype through p53 activation associated with rRNA processing defects rather than telomerase deficiency during the initial stage of DC pathogenesis."

When animals have a diverse array of available habitats, those selected could give insights into true habitat preferences. Since the construction of the Garrison Dam on the Missouri River in North Dakota, Lake Sakakawea (SAK) has become an important breeding area for federally threatened piping plovers (Charadrius melodus; hereafter plovers). We used conditional logistic regression to examine nest-site selection at fine scales (1, 3, and 10 m) during summers 2006-2009 by comparing characteristics at 351 nests to those of 668 random sites within nesting territories. Plovers selected sites (1 m(2)) that were lower than unused random sites, increasing the risk of nest inundation. Plovers selected nest sites that were flat, had little silt, and at least 1 cobble; they also selected for 3-m radius nest areas that were relatively flat and devoid of vegetation and litter. Ninety percent of nests had <38% coverage of silt and <10% slope at the site, and <15% coverage of vegetation or litter and <31% slope within the 3-m radius. Gravel was selected for at nest sites (11% median), but against in the area 10-m from the nest, suggesting plovers select for patches or strips of gravel. Although elevation is rarely evaluated in studies of ground-nesting birds, our results underscore its importance in habitat-selection studies. Relative to where plovers historically nested, habitat at SAK has more diverse topography, substrate composition, vegetation communities, and greater water-level fluctuations. Accordingly, our results provide an example of how habitat-selection results can be interpreted as habitat preferences because they are not influenced by desired habitats being scarce or absent. Further, our results will be useful for directing habitat conservation for plovers and interpreting other habitat-selection studies."

A total of 1,357 incident cases of invasive endometrial cancer and 7,609 controls were included in the analysis (MEC: 426 cases/3,854 controls; WHI: 931cases/3,755 controls). The majority of women in the WHI were European American, while the MEC included sizable numbers of African Americans, Japanese and Latinos. We estimated the odds ratios (ORs) per allele and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of each SNP using unconditional logistic regression adjusting for age, body mass index, and four principal components of ancestry informative markers. The combined ORs were estimated using fixed effect models. Rs4430796 and rs7501939 were associated with endometrial cancer risk in MEC and WHI with no heterogeneity observed across racial/ethnic groups (P≥0.21) or between studies (P≥0.70). The ORper allele was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.89; P = 5.63×10−6) for rs4430796 (G allele) and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.87; P = 3.77×10−7) for rs7501939 (A allele). The associations with the risk of Type I and Type II tumors were similar (P≥0.19). Adjustment for additional endometrial cancer risk factors such as parity, oral contraceptive use, menopausal hormone use, and smoking status had little effect on the results. In conclusion, HNF1B SNPs are associated with risk of endometrial cancer and that the associated relative risks are similar for Type I and Type II tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2049728480,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa type III secretion apparatus exports and translocates four exotoxins into the cytoplasm of the host cell. The translocation requires two hydrophobic bacterial proteins, PopB and PopD, that are found associated with host cell membranes following infection. In this work we examined the influence of host cell elements on exotoxin translocation efficiency. We developed a quantitative flow cytometry based assay of translocation that used protein fusions between either ExoS or ExoY and the ß-lactamase reporter enzyme. In parallel, association of translocon proteins with host plasma membranes was evaluated by immunodetection of PopB/D following sucrose gradient fractionation of membranes. A pro-myelocytic cell line (HL-60) and a pro-monocytic cell line (U937) were found resistant to toxin injection even though PopB/D associated with host cell plasma membranes. Differentiation of these cells to either macrophage- or neutrophil-like cell lines resulted in injection-sensitive phenotype without significantly changing the level of membrane-inserted translocon proteins. As previous in vitro studies have indicated that the lysis of liposomes by PopB and PopD requires both cholesterol and phosphatidyl-serine, we first examined the role of cholesterol in translocation efficiency. Treatment of sensitive HL-60 cells with methyl-ß-cyclodextrine, a cholesterol-depleting agent, resulted in a diminished injection of ExoS-Bla. Moreover, the PopB translocator was found in the membrane fraction, obtained from sucrose-gradient purifications, containing the lipid-raft marker flotillin. Examination of components of signalling pathways influencing the toxin injection was further assayed through a pharmacological approach. A systematic detection of translocon proteins within host membranes showed that, in addition to membrane composition, some general signalling pathways involved in actin polymerization may be critical for the formation of a functional pore. In conclusion, we provide new insights in regulation of translocation process and suggest possible cross-talks between eukaryotic cell and the pathogen at the level of exotoxin translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1975694136,"Citrus canker, caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc), is one of the most destructive diseases of citrus. Progress of breeding citrus canker-resistant varieties is modest due to limited resistant germplasm resources and lack of candidate genes for genetic manipulation. The objective of this study is to establish a novel heterologous pathosystem between Xcc and the well-established model plant Arabidopsis thaliana for defense mechanism dissection and resistance gene identification. Our results indicate that Xcc bacteria neither grow nor decline in Arabidopsis, but induce multiple defense responses including callose deposition, reactive oxygen species and salicylic aicd (SA) production, and defense gene expression, indicating that Xcc activates non-host resistance in Arabidopsis. Moreover, Xcc-induced defense gene expression is suppressed or attenuated in several well-characterized SA signaling mutants including eds1, pad4, eds5, sid2, and npr1. Interestingly, resistance to Xcc is compromised only in eds1, pad4, and eds5, but not in sid2 and npr1. However, combining sid2 and npr1 in the sid2npr1 double mutant compromises resistance to Xcc, suggesting genetic interactions likely exist between SID2 and NPR1 in the non-host resistance against Xcc in Arabidopsis. These results demonstrate that the SA signaling pathway plays a critical role in regulating non-host defense against Xcc in Arabidopsis and suggest that the SA signaling pathway genes may hold great potential for breeding citrus canker-resistant varieties through modern gene transfer technology."

We eluted and sequenced HLA-DR-bound self-peptides presented by CD4+ T cells in order to compare the T cell-derived peptide repertoire to sequences derived from genetically identical B cells. We identified several novel epitopes derived from the T cell-specific proteome, including fragments of CD4 and IL-2. While these data confirm that T cells can present peptides derived from the T-cell specific proteome, the vast majority of peptides sequenced after elution from MHC were derived from the common proteome. From this pool, we identified several identical peptide epitopes in the T and B cell repertoire derived from common endogenous proteins as well as novel endogenous epitopes with promiscuous binding. These findings indicate that the endogenous HLA-DR-bound peptide repertoire, regardless of APC type and across MHC isotype, is largely derived from the same pool of self-protein."

We assessed the above in relation to adaptive shell morphology of the rocky intertidal snail Nucella lapillus by reciprocal transplantation of snails between two shores differing in wave action and rearing snails of the same provenance in a common garden. Results were compared with those reported for similar experiments conducted elsewhere. Microsatellite variation indicated limited gene flow between the populations. Intrinsic growth rate was greater in exposed-site than sheltered-site snails, but the reverse was true of absolute growth rate, suggesting heritable compensation for reduced foraging opportunity at the exposed site. Shell morphology of reciprocal transplants partially converged through plasticity toward that of native snails. Shell morphology of F2s in the common garden partially retained characteristics of the P-generation, suggesting genetic control. A maternal effect was revealed by greater resemblance of F1s than F2s to the P-generation. The observed synergistic effects of plastic, maternal and genetic control of shell-shape may be expected to maximise fitness when environmental characteristics become unpredictable through dispersal."
https://openalex.org/W1996449188,"Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS) is a congenital defect characterized by underdevelopment of the left ventricle and pathological compensation of the right ventricle. If untreated, HLHS is invariably lethal due to the extensive increase in right ventricular workload and eventual failure. Despite the clinical significance, little is known about the molecular pathobiological state of HLHS. Splicing of mRNA transcripts is an important regulatory mechanism of gene expression. Tissue specific alterations of this process have been associated with several cardiac diseases, however, transcriptional signature profiles related to HLHS are unknown. In this study, we performed genome-wide exon array analysis to determine differentially expressed genes and alternatively spliced transcripts in the right ventricle (RV) of six neonates with HLHS, compared to the RV and left ventricle (LV) from non-diseased control subjects. In HLHS, over 180 genes were differentially expressed and 1800 were differentially spliced, leading to changes in a variety of biological processes involving cell metabolism, cytoskeleton, and cell adherence. Additional hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that differential gene expression and mRNA splicing patterns identified in HLHS are unique compared to non-diseased tissue. Our findings suggest that gene expression and mRNA splicing are broadly dysregulated in the RV myocardium of HLHS neonates. In addition, our analysis identified transcriptome profiles representative of molecular biomarkers of HLHS that could be used in the future for diagnostic and prognostic stratification to improve patient outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2047316464,"Background Development of tailored treatment based on immunohistochemical profiles (IPs) of tumors for cancers of unknown primary is needed. Methodology/Principal Findings We developed an algorithm based on primary known adenocarcinoma for testing sensitivity and specificity. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 71 patients of unfavorable subsets of unknown primary adenocarcinoma were obtained. We examined 15 molecular markers using the algorithm incorporating these IPs and classified the tumours into 9 subsets based on the primary tumour site. The sensitivity and specificity of this algorithm were 80.3% and 97.6%, respectively. Apparent primary sites were lung in 17 patients, digestive organs in 13, gynecological organs in 9, prostate in 7, liver or kidney in 6, breast in 4, urothelial organ in 2, biliary tract and pancreatic profile in none, and unclassified in 13. The response rate to chemotherapy was highest for the gynecological IPs. Patients with gynecological or lung cancer IPs had longer median progression-free survival than those with others: 11.2 months for gynecological IPs (p<0.001) and 6.8 months for lung IPs (p = 0.05). Lung, digestive, prostate, and gynecological profiles were associated with significantly longer median survival time than the other profiles. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the IPs were independent prognostic factors for survival. Conclusions/Significance The IPs identified in this study can be used to further stratify patient prognosis for unfavorable subsets of unknown primary adenocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2012027695,"Leishmania parasites alternate between extracellular promastigotes in sandflies and intracellular amastigotes in mammals. These protozoans acquire sphingolipids (SLs) through de novo synthesis (to produce inositol phosphorylceramide) and salvage (to obtain sphingomyelin from the host). A single ISCL (Inositol phosphoSphingolipid phospholipase C-Like) enzyme is responsible for the degradation of both inositol phosphorylceramide (the IPC hydrolase or IPCase activity) and sphingomyelin (the SMase activity). Recent studies of a L. major ISCL-null mutant (iscl(-)) indicate that SL degradation is required for promastigote survival in stationary phase, especially under acidic pH. ISCL is also essential for L. major proliferation in mammals. To further understand the role of ISCL in Leishmania growth and virulence, we introduced a sole IPCase or a sole SMase into the iscl(-) mutant. Results showed that restoration of IPCase only complemented the acid resistance defect in iscl(-) promastigotes and improved their survival in macrophages, but failed to recover virulence in mice. In contrast, a sole SMase fully restored parasite infectivity in mice but was unable to reverse the promastigote defects in iscl(-). These findings suggest that SL degradation in Leishmania possesses separate roles in different stages: while the IPCase activity is important for promastigote survival and acid tolerance, the SMase activity is required for amastigote proliferation in mammals. Consistent with these findings, ISCL was preferentially expressed in stationary phase promastigotes and amastigotes. Together, our results indicate that SL degradation by Leishmania is critical for parasites to establish and sustain infection in the mammalian host."

The P2Y2 nucleotide receptor (P2Y2R) agonist UTP stimulates a strong and sustained release of LTA from WT but not P2Y2R−/− SMC. Assessment of LTA gene transcription by LTA promoter-luciferase construct indicated that LTA levels are controlled at the level of transcription.

https://openalex.org/W1680976214,"Chondrocytes, a unique cell type in cartilage tissue, are responsible for the regulation of anabolic and catabolic homeostasis in cartilage-specific extracellular matrix synthesis. Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling induces dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes, resulting in suppression of type II collagen expression. We have shown previously that α-catenin inhibits β-catenin-Tcf/Lef (T-cell factor/lymphoid-enhancing factor) transcriptional activity in articular chondrocytes with a concomitant recovery of type II collagen expression. In the current study, we elucidated the mechanism underlying this inhibition of β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity by α-catenin, showing that it requires direct interaction between α-catenin and β-catenin. We further showed that it involves recruitment of Gli3R, the short transcription-repressing form of the transcription factor Gli3, to β-catenin by α-catenin. The resulting inhibition of β-catenin transcriptional activity leads to increased expression of type II collagen. Gli3R and α-catenin actions are co-dependent: both are necessary for the observed inhibitory effects on β-catenin transcriptional activity. Reducing Gli3R expression levels through activation of Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) signaling also is sufficient to activate β-catenin transcriptional activity, suggesting that the ternary complex, Gli3R·α-catenin·β-catenin, mediates Ihh-dependent activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in articular chondrocytes. Collectively, this study shows that α-catenin functions as a nuclear factor that recruits the transcriptional repressor Gli3R to β-catenin to inhibit β-catenin transcriptional activity and dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes. Finally, osteoarthritic cartilage showed elevated levels of β-catenin and decreased levels of α-catenin and Gli3R, suggesting that decreased levels of α-catenin and Gli3R levels contribute to increased β-catenin transcriptional activity during osteoarthritic cartilage destruction."

There, they complex with nascent human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules, which are subsequently recognized by the CD8+ lymphocyte cellular response. However, individuals with nonfunctional TAP complexes or tumor or infected cells with blocked TAP molecules are able to present HLA class I ligands generated by TAP-independent processing pathways. Herein, using a TAP-independent polyclonal vaccinia virus-polyspecific CD8+ T cell line, two conserved vaccinia-derived TAP-independent HLA-B*0702 epitopes were identified. The presentation of these epitopes in normal cells occurs via complex antigen-processing pathways involving the proteasome and/or different subsets of metalloproteinases (amino-, carboxy-, and endoproteases), which were blocked in infected cells with specific chemical inhibitors. These data support the hypothesis that the abundant cellular proteolytic systems contribute to the supply of peptides recognized by the antiviral cellular immune response, thereby facilitating immunosurveillance. These data may explain why TAP-deficient individuals live normal life spans without any increased susceptibility to viral infections.

TAP1 mutant mice are deficient in antigen presentation, surface class I molecules, and CD4-8+ T cells.Cell. 1992; 71: 1205-1214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). This HLA class I deficiency implies a reduced functional CD8+ population but does not correlate with any increased susceptibility to viral infections or neoplasms. Thus, TAP-deficient patients live normal life spans with only a limited susceptibility to chronic respiratory bacterial infections. Therefore, their immune systems must be reasonably efficient, and antibodies, NK cells, CD8+ γδ T cells, and the reduced cytolytic CD8+ αβ T subpopulation that is specific for TAP-independent antigens may all contribute to immune defenses that protect against severe viral infections in these individuals. Some viruses block TAP expression or function to prevent cellular immune responses from identifying infected cells (reviewed in Ref. 7Larsen M.V. Nielsen M. Weinzierl A.L.O. TAP-independent MHC class I presentation.Curr. Immunol. Rev. 2006; 2: 233-245Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, TAP-independent pathways must be important for killing cells infected with these viruses. TAP-independent pathways of antigen presentation of various pathogenic epitopes by MHC class I molecules have previously been reported (reviewed in Refs. 7Larsen M.V. Nielsen M. Weinzierl A.L.O.

Cross-protective vaccination with orthopoxviruses, first with an empirically developed vaccine against cowpox virus and later through the massive worldwide administration of vaccinia virus (VACV), achieved the eradication of smallpox, a pandemic disease caused by variola major virus (10Fenner F. Henderson D.A. Arita I. Jezek Z. Ladnyi I. Smallpox and Its Eradication. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland1988Google Scholar). The role of cellular responses in this cross-protection is well documented (11Freed E.R. Duma R.J. Escobar M.R. Vaccinia necrosum and its relationship to impaired immunologic responsiveness.Am. J.

Thus, the identification of TAP-independent epitopes conserved among orthopoxviruses could be relevant to the study of the mechanisms of early empirical vaccination against smallpox disease performed with cowpox virus. In this study, using a TAP-independent polyclonal vaccinia virus-polyspecific CD8+ T cell line, we identified two VACV-derived TAP-independent epitopes that are conserved among the Orthopoxviridae family, including cowpox virus.

The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the Institute of Health “Carlos III” (Permit Number: PI-283). All surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. The mouse cell lines RMA (TAP-positive) and RMA-S (TAP-negative) stably expressing HLA-B*0702 α1α2 domains plus the mouse H-2Db α3 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains have been previously described (14Rohrlich P.S.

All cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Peptides were synthesized in a peptide synthesizer (model 433A; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and purified by reverse-phase HPLC. The correct molecular mass of the peptides was established by MALDI-TOF MS, and their correct composition was verified by quadrupole ion trap micro-HPLC. Brefeldin A (BFA) and all protease inhibitors were purchased from Sigma, with the exception of leupeptin (Amersham Biosciences), pepstatin (Roche Applied Science), benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (Enzyme System Products, CA), and lactacystin (Dr. E. J. Corey, Harvard University). The specificity and activity of inhibitors used in this study are summarized in Table 1. As a control for the activity of protease inhibitors that do not block antigen presentation, RMA-HLA-A*0201 cells (1 × 108) were disrupted by sonication for 15 min at 4 °C and centrifuged as reported previously (15López D. Gil-Torregrosa B.C. Bergmann C. Del Val M. Sequential cleavage by metallopeptidases and proteasomes is involved in processing HIV-1 ENV epitope for endogenous MHC class I antigen presentation.J.

Equivalent aliquots were incubated in the presence of individual inhibitors at 200 μm, and digestion by cellular proteases was allowed for 5 days at 37 °C in PBS. Inhibitors were renewed daily. A sample incubated without inhibitors was taken as the degraded control. After SDS-PAGE separation and Coomassie Blue staining of these samples, the overall protein content of each lane was quantitated by densitometry with the TINA 2.09e program (Isopenmessgeräte, GmbH, Germany). Percent inhibition of protein degradation caused by each inhibitor was calculated as follows: 100 × (sample with inhibitor − degraded)/(nondegraded − degraded).TABLE 1Specificity and activity of the inhibitors used in this studyInhibitorAbbreviationSpecificityReferenceConcentration% inhibition of degradationaActivity of these inhibitors was measured as their ability to prevent proteolytic degradation in cellular extracts as in Ref. 15.

Spleen cells were obtained from HLA-B*0702 transgenic mice at 7 days (acute response) or up to 30 days (memory response) post-intraperitoneal (intraperitoneal) infection with 1 × 107 pfu of VACV-WR as described previously (18López D.

After harvest, cells were stimulated for 2 h with RMA HLA-B*0702 cells infected with VACV-WR and incubated for 3 h in the presence of 5 μg/ml BFA. Later, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-CD8 mAb (ProImmune, Oxford, UK) for 30 min at 4 °C, fixed with Intrastain kit reagent A (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark), and incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-IFN-γ mAb (Pharmingen) in the presence of Intrastain kit permeabilizing reagent B for 30 min at 4 °C. Results were acquired on a FACSCanto flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using CellQuest Pro 2.0 software (BD Biosciences). The TAP-independent polyclonal VACV-polyspecific CD8+ T cell line was generated by immunizing mice intraperitoneally with 1 × 107 pfu of VACV-WR. Splenocytes from immunized mice were re-stimulated weekly in vitro with mitomycin C-treated VACV-infected RMA or RMA-S HLA-B*0702 cells as antigen-presenting cells. Also, uninfected mitomycin C-treated spleen cells of allogeneic BALB/c (H-2d haplotype), C3H (H-2k haplotype), and SJL (H-2s haplotype) mice were alternately used as feeder cells. This allogeneic system prevents cross-presentation of TAP-dependent HLA-B*0702-restricted peptides in the cell culture. The CD8+ T cell line was re-stimulated with VACV-infected RMA-S HLA-B*0702 cells and was cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol and was used after five re-stimulations as effector cells in standard 4-h cytolytic assays (18López D.

Splenocytes from immunized mice were restimulated in vitro with mitomycin C-treated spleen cells pulsed with 10−6 m of the respective peptide and cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 × 10−7 m peptide, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol. Recombinant human interleukin-2 was generously provided by Hoffmann-La Roche for the long term propagation of all CD8+ T cell lines. ICS assays to detect the recognition of infected cells by polyclonal CD8+ T cell lines were performed as described previously (17Samino Y. Lopez D. Guil S. de León P. Del Val M.

CD8+ T cell lines were stimulated for 4 h with RMA HLA-B*0702 target cells that had been infected with VACV or VACV-OVA(257–264) overnight and in the presence of 5 μg/ml BFA. When protease inhibitors were used, all drugs were added 15 min before the virus and kept at a 5-fold higher concentration during the 1-h adsorption period than that used throughout the infection. After the virus inoculums were washed, the inhibitors were kept at the concentrations indicated for the individual experiments. The inhibitors were not toxic at the indicated concentrations because they did not affect antigen presentation of either the J6R(303–311) or D1RL((807–817)) epitopes (see below) or the VACV infection when the Omnitope antiserum with specificity for VACV proteins from purified virions was used (ViroStat Inc., Portland, ME) (supplemental Table 1). ICS with polyclonal CD8+ T cell lines was performed similarly to ex vivo ICS. The percentage of specific inhibition obtained by the addition of the inhibitors was calculated as shown in Equation 1,% specific inhibition=100−((ICS VACV + inhibitor) − (ICS without infection))(ICS VACV−ICS without infection)×100(Eq. 1) To analyze statistical significance, an unpaired Student t test was used. p values < 0.01 were considered to be significant. Spleen cells from HLA-B*0702 transgenic mice were primed with VACV and re-stimulated with the TAP-negative RMA-S cell line transfected with HLA-B*0702 to specifically recognize VACV-infected target cells. We observed 45% specific lysis versus 1% without virus in a standard 51Cr-release assay. By intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assays, we found that 32% of IFN-γ secreting cells had a specific response versus 1% without virus. Later, this CD8+ cell line was used to identify TAP-independent epitopes with target cells previously pulsed with the VACV synthetic peptides previously reported as HLA-B*0702 epitopes identified from either HLA-B*0702 transgenic mice (A34R(82–90), D1R(808–817), and J2R(116–124)) (20Pasquetto V.

In addition, 14 HLA-B7 potential ligands from a VACV proteome-based in silico prediction of high binding were also included in the study to identify new epitopes (supplemental Table 2). In a preliminary 51Cr-release assay, only two synthetic peptides, D1R(808–817) and J6R(303–311), were recognized by the TAP-independent CTL cell line (Fig. 1A, arrows). Additional ICS experiments with all synthetic peptides confirmed that only the D1R(808–817) and J6R(303–311) peptides specifically stimulated the production of IFN-γ in the CD8+ T cells specific for VACV ligands (Fig. 1B). Fig. 2 shows that D1R(808–817) peptide was recognized 10-fold less efficiently in TAP-deficient cells versus TAP-sufficient cells. Both viral ligands were conserved among the Orthopoxviridae family, including cowpox virus (NCBI data base (/blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). In summary, these results indicate that two conserved TAP-independent HLA-B7 epitopes were present in the TAP-deficient VACV-infected cells.FIGURE 2Recognition of TAP+ and TAP− cell lines by VACV-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2051983369,"Deciphering of the spatial and stereospecific constraints on synergistic transcription activation mediated between activators bound to cis-regulatory elements is important for understanding gene regulation and remains largely unknown. It has been commonly believed that two activators will activate transcription most effectively when they are bound on the same face of DNA double helix and within a boundary distance from the transcription initiation complex attached to the TATA box. In this work, we studied the spatial and stereospecific constraints on activation by multiple copies of bound model activators using a series of engineered relative distances and stereospecific orientations. We observed that multiple copies of the activators GAL4-VP16 and ZEBRA bound to engineered promoters activated transcription more effectively when bound on opposite faces of the DNA double helix. This phenomenon was not affected by the spatial relationship between the proximal activator and initiation complex. To explain these results, we proposed the novel concentration field model, which posits the effective concentration of bound activators, and therefore the transcription activation potential, is affected by their stereospecific positioning. These results could be used to understand synergistic transcription activation anew and to aid the development of predictive models for the identification of cis-regulatory elements."
https://openalex.org/W2009584033,"The TATA box binding protein (TBP) is a central component of the transcription preinitiation complex, and its occupancy at a promoter is correlated with transcription levels. The TBP-promoter DNA complex contains sharply bent DNA and its interaction lifetime is limited by the ATP-dependent TBP displacement activity of the Snf2/Swi2 ATPase Mot1. Several mechanisms for Mot1 action have been proposed, but how it catalyzes TBP removal from DNA is unknown. To better understand the Mot1 mechanism, native gel electrophoresis and FRET were used to determine how Mot1 affects the trajectory of DNA in the TBP-DNA complex. Strikingly, in the absence of ATP, Mot1 acts to unbend DNA, whereas TBP remains closely associated with the DNA in a stable Mot1-TBP-DNA ternary complex. Interestingly, and in contrast to full-length Mot1, the isolated Mot1 ATPase domain binds DNA, and its affinity for DNA is nucleotide-dependent, suggesting parallels between the Mot1 mechanism and DNA translocation-based mechanisms of chromatin remodeling enzymes. Based on these findings, a model is presented for Mot1 that links a DNA conformational change with ATP-induced DNA translocation.

https://openalex.org/W2024742441,"We have previously shown that TPA activates HTLV-1 LTR in Jurkat T-cells by inducing the binding of Sp1-p53 complex to the Sp1 site residing within the Ets responsive region 1 (ERR-1) of the LTR and that this activation is inhibited by PKCalpha and PKCepsilon. However, in H9 T-cells TPA has been noted to activate the LTR in two consecutive stages. The first stage is activation is mediated by PKCetta and requires the three 21 bp TRE repeats. The second activation mode resembles that of Jurkat cells, except that it is inhibited by PKCdelta. The present study revealed that the first LTR activation in H9 cells resulted from PKCetta-induced elevation of non-phosphorylated c-Jun which bound to the AP-1 site residing within each TRE. In contrast, this TRE-dependent activation did not occur in Jurkat cells, since there was no elevation of non-phosphorylated c-Jun in these cells. However, we found that PKCalpha and PKCepsilon, in Jurkat cells, and PKCetta and PKCdelta, in H9 cells, increased the level of phosphorylated c-Jun that interacted with the Sp1-p53 complex. This interaction prevented the Sp1-p53 binding to ERR-1 and blocked, thereby, the ERR-1-mediated LTR activation. Therefore, this PKC-inhibited LTR activation started in both cell types after depletion of the relevant PKCs by their downregulation. In view of these variable activating mechanisms we assume that there might be additional undiscovered yet modes of HTLV-1 LTR activation which vary in different cell types. Moreover, in line with this presumption we speculate that in HTLV-1 carriers the LTR of the latent provirus may also be reactivated by different mechanisms that vary between its different host T-lymphocyte subclones. Since this reactivation may initiate the ATL process, understanding of these mechanisms is essential for establishing strategies to block the possibility of reactivating the latent virus as preventive means for ATL development in carriers."
https://openalex.org/W2000407428,"Tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase 2 (TPST2) is one of the enzymes responsible for tyrosine O-sulfation and catalyzes the sulfation of the specific tyrosine residue of thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR). Since this modification is indispensable for the activation of TSH signaling, a non-functional TPST2 mutation (Tpst2(grt)) in DW/J-grt mice leads to congenital hypothyroidism (CH) characterized by severe thyroid hypoplasia and dwarfism related to TSH hyporesponsiveness. Previous studies indicated that the genetic background of the 129(+Ter)/SvJcl (129) mouse strain ameliorates Tpst2(grt)-induced CH. To identify loci responsible for CH resistance in 129 mice, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis using backcross progenies from susceptible DW/J and resistant 129 mice. We used the first principal component calculated from body weights at 5, 8 and 10 weeks as an indicator of CH, and QTL analysis mapped a major QTL showing a highly significant linkage to the distal portion of chromosome (Chr) 2; between D2Mit62 and D2Mit304, particularly close to D2Mit255. In addition, two male-specific QTLs showing statistically suggestive linkage were also detected on Chrs 4 and 18, respectively. All QTL alleles derived from the 129 strain increased resistance to growth retardation. There was also a positive correlation between recovery from thyroid hypoplasia and the presence of the 129 allele at D2Mit255 in male progenies. These results suggested that the major QTL on Chr 2 is involved in thyroid development. Moreover, since DW/J congenic strain mice carrying both a Tpst2(grt) mutation and 129 alleles in the major QTL show resistance to dwarfism and thyroid hypoplasia, we confirmed the presence of the resistant gene in this region, and that it is involved in thyroid development. Further genetical analysis should lead to identification of genes for CH tolerance and, from a better understanding of thyroid organogenesis and function, the subsequent development of new treatments for thyroid disorders."
