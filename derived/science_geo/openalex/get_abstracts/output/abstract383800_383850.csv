https://openalex.org/W2053140018,"The long-term prognosis for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is dramatically altered by the development of metastatic recurrence. However, there are very few indicators that can predict which patient will develop a recurrence. MicroRNAs regulate many cellular processes and have been shown to be associated with cancer development and recurrence. More recently it has been shown that microRNA genes can be epigenetically modified in cancer, resulting in aberrant silencing of microRNA genes with tumor suppressor functions. In this study, we show that two genes encoding for hsa-miR-9 are significantly hypermethylated in ccRCC tumors compared with adjacent normal tissues (P-value <0.001 for both miR-9-1 and miR-9-3) resulting in decreased expression, and that the methylation of these genes was more significant in DNA obtained from the primary tumor for patients who developed a recurrence (P-value: 0.012 and 0.009 for miR-9-1 and miR-9-3, respectively) than in tumors from nonrecurrent patients. Furthermore, methylation of miR-9-3 was significantly associated with an increased risk of recurrence (hazard ratio: 5.85, 95% confidence intervals: 1.30–26.35) and high methylation levels of either miR-9-1 or miR-9-3 resulted in a significant, nearly 30-month decrease in recurrence-free survival time (P-value: 0.034 and 0.007 for miR-9-1 and miR-9-3, respectively). Our results demonstrate that hsa-miR-9 is involved in the development of ccRCC while also having a role in the development of metastatic recurrence."

However, little is known about the genomic content of commensals or how related they are to their pathogenic counterparts. The genus Neisseria, containing both commensal and pathogenic species, provides an excellent opportunity to study these issues. We undertook a comprehensive sequencing and analysis of human commensal and pathogenic Neisseria genomes. Commensals have an extensive repertoire of virulence alleles, a large fraction of which has been exchanged among Neisseria species. Commensals also have the genetic capacity to donate DNA to, and take up DNA from, other Neisseria. Our findings strongly suggest that commensal Neisseria serve as reservoirs of virulence alleles, and that they engage extensively in genetic exchange."

Surprisingly, recent experiments in rats – by far the most frequently used animal model in this field – suggest that the value of cocaine is lower than previously thought. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we report a series of choice experiments that better define the relative position of cocaine on the value ladder of rats (i.e., preference rank-ordering of different rewards). Rats were allowed to choose either taking cocaine or drinking water sweetened with saccharin – a nondrug alternative that is not biologically essential. By systematically varying the cost and concentration of sweet water, we found that cocaine is low on the value ladder of the large majority of rats, near the lowest concentrations of sweet water. In addition, a retrospective analysis of all experiments over the past 5 years revealed that no matter how heavy was past cocaine use most rats readily give up cocaine use in favor of the nondrug alternative. Only a minority, fewer than 15% at the heaviest level of past cocaine use, continued to take cocaine, even when hungry and offered a natural sugar that could relieve their need of calories. Conclusions/Significance This pattern of results (cocaine abstinence in most rats; cocaine preference in few rats) maps well onto the epidemiology of human cocaine addiction and suggests that only a minority of rats would be vulnerable to cocaine addiction while the large majority would be resilient despite extensive drug use. Resilience to drug addiction has long been suspected in humans but could not be firmly established, mostly because it is difficult to control retrospectively for differences in drug self-exposure and/or availability in human drug users. This conclusion has important implications for preclinical research on the neurobiology of cocaine addiction and for future medication development."
https://openalex.org/W2151671981,"Different high-throughput nucleic acid sequencing platforms are currently available but a trade-off currently exists between the cost and number of reads that can be generated versus the read length that can be achieved.We describe an experimental and computational pipeline yielding millions of reads that can exceed 200 bp with quality scores approaching that of traditional Sanger sequencing. The method combines an automatable gel-less library construction step with paired-end sequencing on a short-read instrument. With appropriately sized library inserts, mate-pair sequences can overlap, and we describe the SHERA software package that joins them to form a longer composite read.This strategy is broadly applicable to sequencing applications that benefit from low-cost high-throughput sequencing, but require longer read lengths. We demonstrate that our approach enables metagenomic analyses using the Illumina Genome Analyzer, with low error rates, and at a fraction of the cost of pyrosequencing."

https://openalex.org/W1984890358,"The mechanisms that induce Alzheimer's disease (AD) are largely unknown thereby deterring the development of disease-modifying therapies. One working hypothesis of AD is that Abeta excess disrupts membranes causing pore formation leading to alterations in ionic homeostasis. However, it is largely unknown if this also occurs in native brain neuronal membranes. Here we show that similar to other pore forming toxins, Abeta induces perforation of neuronal membranes causing an increase in membrane conductance, intracellular calcium and ethidium bromide influx. These data reveal that the target of Abeta is not another membrane protein, but that Abeta itself is the cellular target thereby explaining the failure of current therapies to interfere with the course of AD. We propose that this novel effect of Abeta could be useful for the discovery of anti AD drugs capable of blocking these ""Abeta perforates"". In addition, we demonstrate that peptides that block Abeta neurotoxicity also slow or prevent the membrane-perforating action of Abeta."
https://openalex.org/W3125092501,"According to the body-specificity hypothesis, people with different bodily characteristics should form correspondingly different mental representations, even in highly abstract conceptual domains. In a previous test of this proposal, right- and left-handers were found to associate positive ideas like intelligence, attractiveness, and honesty with their dominant side and negative ideas with their non-dominant side. The goal of the present study was to determine whether 'body-specific' associations of space and valence can be observed beyond the laboratory in spontaneous behavior, and whether these implicit associations have visible consequences.We analyzed speech and gesture (3012 spoken clauses, 1747 gestures) from the final debates of the 2004 and 2008 US presidential elections, which involved two right-handers (Kerry, Bush) and two left-handers (Obama, McCain). Blind, independent coding of speech and gesture allowed objective hypothesis testing. Right- and left-handed candidates showed contrasting associations between gesture and speech. In both of the left-handed candidates, left-hand gestures were associated more strongly with positive-valence clauses and right-hand gestures with negative-valence clauses; the opposite pattern was found in both right-handed candidates.Speakers associate positive messages more strongly with dominant hand gestures and negative messages with non-dominant hand gestures, revealing a hidden link between action and emotion. This pattern cannot be explained by conventions in language or culture, which associate 'good' with 'right' but not with 'left'; rather, results support and extend the body-specificity hypothesis. Furthermore, results suggest that the hand speakers use to gesture may have unexpected (and probably unintended) communicative value, providing the listener with a subtle index of how the speaker feels about the content of the co-occurring speech."
https://openalex.org/W2057950283,"Background The transcription factor Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) and its target gene products, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), elicit an antioxidant response that may have therapeutic value for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, HO-1 protein levels are increased in dopaminergic neurons of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, suggesting its participation in free-iron deposition, oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. Before targeting Nrf2 for PD therapy it is imperative to determine if HO-1 is neurotoxic or neuroprotective in the basal ganglia. Methodology We addressed this question by comparing neuronal damage and gliosis in Nrf2- or HO-1-knockout mice submitted to intraperitoneal injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) for five consecutive days. Nrf2-knockout mice showed exacerbated gliosis and dopaminergic nigrostriatal degeneration, as determined by immunohistochemical staining of tyrosine hydroxylase in striatum (STR) and substantia nigra (SN) and by HPLC determination of striatal dopamine and 3,4- dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC). On the other hand, the severity of gliosis and dopaminergic degeneration in HO-1-null mice was neither increased nor reduced. Regarding free-iron deposition, both Nrf2- and HO-1-deficient mice exhibited similar number of deposits as determined by Perl's staining, therefore indicating that these proteins do not contribute significantly to iron accumulation or clearance in MPTP-induced Parkinsonism. Conclusions These results suggest that HO-1 does not protect or enhance the sensitivity to neuronal death in Parkinson's disease and that pharmacological or genetic intervention on Nrf2 may provide a neuroprotective benefit as add on therapy with current symptomatic protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2097305814,"Behavioral studies have provided evidence for an action-sentence compatibility effect (ACE) that suggests a coupling of motor mechanisms and action-sentence comprehension. When both processes are concurrent, the action sentence primes the actual movement, and simultaneously, the action affects comprehension. The aim of the present study was to investigate brain markers of bidirectional impact of language comprehension and motor processes.Participants listened to sentences describing an action that involved an open hand, a closed hand, or no manual action. Each participant was asked to press a button to indicate his/her understanding of the sentence. Each participant was assigned a hand-shape, either closed or open, which had to be used to activate the button. There were two groups (depending on the assigned hand-shape) and three categories (compatible, incompatible and neutral) defined according to the compatibility between the response and the sentence. ACEs were found in both groups. Brain markers of semantic processing exhibited an N400-like component around the Cz electrode position. This component distinguishes between compatible and incompatible, with a greater negative deflection for incompatible. Motor response elicited a motor potential (MP) and a re-afferent potential (RAP), which are both enhanced in the compatible condition.The present findings provide the first ACE cortical measurements of semantic processing and the motor response. N400-like effects suggest that incompatibility with motor processes interferes in sentence comprehension in a semantic fashion. Modulation of motor potentials (MP and RAP) revealed a multimodal semantic facilitation of the motor response. Both results provide neural evidence of an action-sentence bidirectional relationship. Our results suggest that ACE is not an epiphenomenal post-sentence comprehension process. In contrast, motor-language integration occurring during the verb onset supports a genuine and ongoing brain motor-language interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2055625865,"Chronic infection with cagA-positive Helicobacter pylori is the strongest risk factor for the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. The cagA gene product CagA is injected into gastric epithelial cells and disturbs cellular functions by physically interacting with and deregulating a variety of cellular signaling molecules. RUNX3 is a tumor suppressor in many tissues, and it is frequently inactivated in gastric cancer. In this study, we show that H. pylori infection inactivates the gastric tumor suppressor RUNX3 in a CagA-dependent manner. CagA directly associates with RUNX3 through a specific recognition of the PY motif of RUNX3 by a WW domain of CagA. Deletion of the WW domains of CagA or mutation of the PY motif in RUNX3 abolishes the ability of CagA to induce the ubiquitination and degradation of RUNX3, thereby extinguishing its ability to inhibit the transcriptional activation of RUNX3. Our studies identify RUNX3 as a novel cellular target of H. pylori CagA and also reveal a mechanism by which CagA functions as an oncoprotein by blocking the activity of gastric tumor suppressor RUNX3."
https://openalex.org/W1992270919,"Background XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) is one of the most important members of the apoptosis inhibitor family. XIAP is upregulated in various malignancies, including human glioblastoma. It promotes invasion, metastasis, growth and survival of malignant cells. We hypothesized that downregulation of XIAP by human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells (hUCBSC) in glioma cells would cause them to undergo apoptotic death. Methodology/Principal Findings We observed the effect of hUCBSC on two malignant glioma cell lines (SNB19 and U251) and two glioma xenograft cell lines (4910 and 5310). In co-cultures of glioma cells with hUCBSC, proliferation of glioma cells was significantly inhibited. This is associated with increased cytotoxicity of glioma cells, which led to glioma cell death. Stem cells induced apoptosis in glioma cells, which was evaluated by TUNEL assay, FACS analyses and immunoblotting. The induction of apoptosis is associated with inhibition of XIAP in co-cultures of hUCBSC. Similar results were obtained by the treatment of glioma cells with shRNA to downregulate XIAP (siXIAP). Downregulation of XIAP resulted in activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 to trigger apoptosis in glioma cells. Apoptosis is characterized by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and upregulation of mitochondrial apoptotic proteins Bax and Bad. Cell death of glioma cells was marked by downregulation of Akt and phospho-Akt molecules. We observed similar results under in vivo conditions in U251- and 5310-injected nude mice brains, which were treated with hUCBSC. Under in vivo conditions, Smac/DIABLO was found to be colocalized in the nucleus, showing that hUCBSC induced apoptosis is mediated by inhibition of XIAP and activation of Smac/DIABLO. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that downregulation of XIAP by hUCBSC treatment induces apoptosis, which led to the death of the glioma cells and xenograft cells. This study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of XIAP and hUCBSC to treat malignant gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2062926135,"Bacteria can elaborate complex patterns of development that are dictated by temporally ordered patterns of gene expression, typically under the control of a master regulatory pathway. For some processes, such as biofilm development, regulators that initiate the process have been identified but subsequent phenotypic changes such as stress tolerance do not seem to be under the control of these same regulators. A hallmark feature of biofilms is growth within a self-produced extracellular matrix. In this study we used metabolomics to compare Salmonella cells in rdar colony biofilms to isogenic csgD deletion mutants that do not produce an extracellular matrix. The two populations show distinct metabolite profiles. Even though CsgD controls only extracellular matrix production, metabolite signatures associated with cellular adaptations associated with stress tolerances were present in the wild type but not the mutant cells. To further explore these differences we examine the temporal gene expression of genes implicated in biofilm development and stress adaptations. In wild type cells, genes involved in a metabolic shift to gluconeogenesis and various stress-resistance pathways exhibited an ordered expression profile timed with multicellular development even though they are not CsgD regulated. In csgD mutant cells, the ordered expression was lost. We conclude that the induction of these pathways results from production of, and growth within, a self produced matrix rather than elaboration of a defined genetic program. These results predict that common physiological properties of biofilms are induced independently of regulatory pathways that initiate biofilm formation."
https://openalex.org/W1993830627,"Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) is one of the most common causes of human bacterial enteritis worldwide primarily due to contaminated poultry products. Previously, we found a significant difference in C. jejuni colonization in the ceca between two genetically distinct broiler lines (Line A (resistant) has less colony than line B (susceptible) on day 7 post inoculation). We hypothesize that different mechanisms between these two genetic lines may affect their ability to resist C. jejuni colonization in chickens. The molecular mechanisms of the local host response to C. jejuni colonization in chickens have not been well understood. In the present study, to profile the cecal gene expression in the response to C. jejuni colonization and to compare differences between two lines at the molecular level, RNA of ceca from two genetic lines of chickens (A and B) were applied to a chicken whole genome microarray for a pair-comparison between inoculated (I) and non-inoculated (N) chickens within each line and between lines. Our results demonstrated that metabolism process and insulin receptor signaling pathways are key contributors to the different response to C. jejuni colonization between lines A and B. With C. jejuni inoculation, lymphocyte activation and lymphoid organ development functions are important for line A host defenses, while cell differentiation, communication and signaling pathways are important for line B. Interestingly, circadian rhythm appears play a critical role in host response of the more resistant A line to C. jejuni colonization. A dramatic differential host response was observed between these two lines of chickens. The more susceptible line B chickens responded to C. jejuni inoculation with a dramatic up-regulation in lipid, glucose, and amino acid metabolism, which is undoubtedly for use in the response to the colonization with little or no change in immune host defenses. However, in more resistant line A birds the host defense responses were characterized by an up-regulation lymphocyte activation, probably by regulatory T cells and an increased expression of the NLR recognition receptor NALP1. To our knowledge, this is the first time each of these responses has been observed in the avian response to an intestinal bacterial pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2024933647,"In a clinical infection, multiplying and non-multiplying bacteria co-exist. Antibiotics kill multiplying bacteria, but they are very inefficient at killing non-multipliers which leads to slow or partial death of the total target population of microbes in an infected tissue. This prolongs the duration of therapy, increases the emergence of resistance and so contributes to the short life span of antibiotics after they reach the market. Targeting non-multiplying bacteria from the onset of an antibiotic development program is a new concept. This paper describes the proof of principle for this concept, which has resulted in the development of the first antibiotic using this approach. The antibiotic, called HT61, is a small quinolone-derived compound with a molecular mass of about 400 Daltons, and is active against non-multiplying bacteria, including methicillin sensitive and resistant, as well as Panton-Valentine leukocidin-carrying Staphylococcus aureus. It also kills mupirocin resistant MRSA. The mechanism of action of the drug is depolarisation of the cell membrane and destruction of the cell wall. The speed of kill is within two hours. In comparison to the conventional antibiotics, HT61 kills non-multiplying cells more effectively, 6 logs versus less than one log for major marketed antibiotics. HT61 kills methicillin sensitive and resistant S. aureus in the murine skin bacterial colonization and infection models. No resistant phenotype was produced during 50 serial cultures over a one year period. The antibiotic caused no adverse affects after application to the skin of minipigs. Targeting non-multiplying bacteria using this method should be able to yield many new classes of antibiotic. These antibiotics may be able to reduce the rate of emergence of resistance, shorten the duration of therapy, and reduce relapse rates."
https://openalex.org/W2029171740,"Tumor cells often subvert normal regulatory mechanisms of signal transduction. This study shows this principle by studying yet uncharacterized mutants of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) previously identified in glioblastoma multiforme, which is the most aggressive brain tumor in adults. Unlike the well-characterized EGFRvIII mutant form, which lacks a portion of the ligand-binding cleft within the extracellular domain, EGFRvIVa and EGFRvIVb lack internal segments distal to the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. By constructing the mutants and by ectopic expression in naive cells, we show that both mutants confer an oncogenic potential in vitro, as well as tumorigenic growth in animals. The underlying mechanisms entail constitutive receptor dimerization and basal activation of the kinase domain, likely through a mechanism that relieves a restraining molecular fold, along with stabilization due to association with HSP90. Phosphoproteomic analyses delineated the signaling pathways preferentially engaged by EGFRvIVb-identified unique substrates. This information, along with remarkable sensitivities to tyrosine kinase blockers and to a chaperone inhibitor, proposes strategies for pharmacological interception in brain tumors harboring EGFRvIV mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1994433492,"Normal tissue cells survive and proliferate only while anchored to solid substrate. Conversely, transformed cells both survive and proliferate following detachment, having lost attachment context through unclear mechanisms. p66(Shc) is a focal adhesion-associated protein that reports cell attachment through a RhoA-dependent mechanosensory test. We find that human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells and mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), which display aggressive metastatic behavior, lack both p66(Shc) and retinoblastoma (pRB) and bypass anoikis. Re-expression of p66(Shc) in these cells restores anoikis and provides striking protection from metastasis by LLC cells in vivo. Notably, knockdown of p66(Shc) in normal epithelial cells leads to unrestrained Ras activation, preventing anoikis through downstream suppression of RhoA but blocking proliferation in a pRB-dependent manner, thus mimicking oncogenic Ras. Conversely, LLC and SCLC cells display constitutive Ras activation necessary to bypass anoikis, which is reversed by re-expression of p66(Shc). p66(Shc) therefore coordinates Ras-dependent control of proliferation and anchorage sensation, which can be defeated in the evolution of highly metastatic tumors by combined loss of both p66(Shc) and pRB."
https://openalex.org/W2006835350,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) originate from avirulent precursors but differ from all other influenza viruses by the presence of a polybasic cleavage site in their hemagglutinins (HA) of subtype H5 or H7. In this study, we investigated the ability of a low-pathogenic avian H5N1 strain to transform into an HPAIV. Using reverse genetics, we replaced the monobasic HA cleavage site of the low-pathogenic strain A/Teal/Germany/Wv632/2005 (H5N1) (TG05) by a polybasic motif from an HPAIV (TG05poly). To elucidate the virulence potential of all viral genes of HPAIV, we generated two reassortants carrying the HA from the HPAIV A/Swan/Germany/R65/06 (H5N1) (R65) plus the remaining genes from TG05 (TG05-HAR65) or in reversed composition the mutated TG05 HA plus the R65 genes (R65-HATG05poly). In vitro, TG05poly and both reassortants were able to replicate without the addition of trypsin, which is characteristic for HPAIV. Moreover, in contrast to avirulent TG05, the variants TG05poly, TG05-HAR65, and R65-HATG05poly are pathogenic in chicken to an increasing degree. Whereas the HA cleavage site mutant TG05poly led to temporary non-lethal disease in all animals, the reassortant TG05-HAR65 caused death in 3 of 10 animals. Furthermore, the reassortant R65-HATG05poly displayed the highest lethality as 8 of 10 chickens died, resembling “natural” HPAIV strains. Taken together, acquisition of a polybasic HA cleavage site is only one necessary step for evolution of low-pathogenic H5N1 strains into HPAIV. However, these low-pathogenic strains may already have cryptic virulence potential. Moreover, besides the polybasic cleavage site, the additional virulence determinants of H5N1 HPAIV are located within the HA itself and in other viral proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2050098144,"Neuroblastomas are pediatric tumors that develop from sympathetic precursors and express neuronal proteins, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY). NPY is a sympathetic neurotransmitter acting via multiple receptors (Y1-Y5R). Both NPY and Y2Rs are commonly expressed in neuroblastoma cell lines and tissues. The peptide secreted from neuroblastomas stimulates tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis. As both processes are Y2R-mediated, the aim of this study was to assess Y2R as a potential therapeutic target for neuroblastoma. In vitro, Y2R antagonist (BIIE0246) prevented activation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) induced by endogenous NPY, which resulted in decreased proliferation and induction of Bim-mediated apoptosis. Similar growth-inhibitory effects were achieved with NPY small interfering RNA (siRNA) and Y2R siRNA. In vivo, Y2R antagonist significantly inhibited growth of SK-N-BE(2) and SK-N-AS xenografts, which was associated with decreased activation of p44/42 MAPK, as well as reduced proliferation (Ki67) and increased apoptosis (TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; TUNEL). The Y2R antagonist also exerted an antiangiogenic effect. In vitro, it reduced the proliferation of endothelial cells induced by neuroblastoma-conditioned media. Consequently, the Y2R antagonist-treated xenografts had decreased vascularization and a high degree of focal fibrosis. In human neuroblastoma tissues, the expression of Y2R was observed in both tumor and endothelial cells, while NPY was predominantly expressed in neuroblastoma cells. In summary, Y2R is a promising new target for neuroblastoma therapy affecting both cancer cells and tumor vasculature."
https://openalex.org/W1986039093,"Background Plant-pathogenic begomoviruses have a complex association with their insect vectors. The interactions of begomoviruses and reproduction of their vectors are poorly understood. Bemisia tabaci is known to transmit many begomoviruses, and the spread of B. tabaci, especially the B and Q ‘biotypes’, has been accompanied by the epidemics of begomoviruses. One of these identified disease-causing agents was Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV). Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we compared the egg production and realized fecundity of two ‘biotypes’ or putative species of the whitefly B. tabaci, including the alien invasive B and the indigenous ZHJ1 from Zhejiang, China, feeding on either healthy or TYLCCNV-infected tobacco plants. The ovary of the whitefly was composed of 12–22 telotrophic ovarioles. According to the morphology of the oocytes and level of yolk content, oocytes in ovarioles were divided into four developmental phases (I-IV). Significantly higher proportion of immature oocytes (phase II, III) and mature oocytes (phase IV) was observed in ovary of females that fed on TYLCCNV-infected tobacco compared to that on healthy plants. Moreover, there was significant increase of eggs laid of B whitefly that fed on TYLCCNV-infected tobacco plants during the early developmental stages. In contrast, the proportion of oocytes of different developmental phases and eggs laid had no significant differences between ZHJ1 whiteflies feeding on TYLCCNV-infected and non-infected host plants. Conclusions/Significance The invasive B whitefly benefits from feeding on a begomovirus-infected plant through increased egg production and realized fecundity."
https://openalex.org/W2076449317,"One of the characteristics of gliomas is a decrease in the expression of connexin43, a protein that forms gap junctions. Restoring connexin43 expression in glioma cells reduces their exacerbated rate of cell growth, although it is not yet known how connexin43 modifies the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation. Here, we show that restoring connexin43 to C6 glioma cells impedes their progression from G0/G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle by reducing retinoblastoma phosphorylation and cyclin E expression through the upregulation of p21 and p27. Interestingly, connexin43 diminishes the oncogenic activity of c-Src exhibited by glioma cells. By studying a Tyr247 and Tyr265 mutant connexin43, we show that these residues are required for connexin43 to inhibit c-Src activity and cell proliferation. In conclusion, by acting as a substrate of c-Src, connexin43 reduces its oncogenic activity and decreases the rate of glioma cell proliferation, potentially an early step in the antiproliferative effects of connexin43. Although c-Src is known to phosphorylate connexin43, this study provides the first evidence that connexin43 can also inhibit c-Src activity."
https://openalex.org/W2136584073,"It is well known that thyroid disease is more frequent in women than in men; however, the molecular basis for this gender-based difference is still poorly understood. The activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), through different mechanisms including loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor, is being increasingly recognized as a major player in the development of thyroid neoplastic lesions. Loss of Pten in the mouse thyroid results in a significant increase in the thyrocyte proliferative index, which is more prominent in the female mice. In this study, we show that 52% of the Pten−/− female mice, but only 12% of the males, develop follicular adenomas by 1 year of age. In addition, 50% of female mutants, but only 35% of males older than 1 year of age develop invasive, and often metastatic, follicular carcinomas. Mutant females have a significantly shorter overall survival compared with male mutants. Hormonal manipulation experiments established a direct role of estrogens in controlling the increased thyrocyte proliferation index in mutant females. Furthermore, while genetic ablation of one Cdkn1b allele accelerated the development of neoplastic lesions, it also abolished the gender differences in survival and reduced the difference in neoplastic lesion development rate, underlining a key role of p27 in mediating estrogen action in the thyroid follicular cells. These data, based on a clinically relevant model of thyroid follicular carcinoma, provide, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time in vivo evidence that circulating estrogens are directly responsible for the increased female susceptibility to thyroid disease, at least on activation of the PI3K pathway, and provide new insights into the gender-based differences characterizing thyroid neoplastic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2035431467,"The highly expressed Id1 (inhibitor of DNA binding/differentiation) protein promotes angiogenesis in HCC and is a well established target for anti-angiogenesis therapeutic strategies. Heparan sulfate (HS) mimetics such as PI-88 can abrogate HS-protein interactions to inhibit angiogenesis. Id1 is the direct downstream effector of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which are angiogenic and HS-binding proteins. Thus, targeting BMPs by HS mimetics may inhibit angiogenesis via attenuating Id1 expression. We report here that a HS mimetic WSS25 potently inhibited the tube formation of HMEC-1 cells on Matrigel and their migration. Meanwhile, WSS25 (25 μg/ml) nearly completely blocked Id1 expression in the HMEC-1 cells as demonstrated by oligo-angiogenesis microarray analysis and further confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. BMP/Smad/Id1 signaling also was blocked by WSS25 treatment in HMEC-1 cells. Importantly, Id1 knockdown in HMEC-1 cells caused the disruption of their tube formation on Matrigel. By employing quartz crystal microbalance analysis, we found that WSS25 strongly bound to BMP2. Moreover, WSS25 impaired BMP2-induced tube formation of HMEC-1 cells on Matrigel and angiogenesis in Matrigel transplanted into C57BL6 mice. Furthermore, WSS25 (100 mg/kg) abrogated the growth of HCC cells xenografted in male nude mice. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that both the expression of Id1 and the endothelial cell marker CD31 were lower in the WSS25-treated tumor tissue than in the control. Therefore, WSS25 is a potential drug candidate for HCC therapy as a tumor angiogenesis inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2043782868,"Adenoviral (Ad) vectors have been used for a variety of vaccine applications including cancer and infectious diseases. Traditionally, Ad-based vaccines are designed to express antigens through transgene expression of a given antigen. However, in some cases these conventional Ad-based vaccines have had sub-optimal clinical results. These sub-optimal results are attributed in part to pre-existing Ad serotype 5 (Ad5) immunity. In order to circumvent the need for antigen expression via transgene incorporation, the “antigen capsid-incorporation” strategy has been developed and used for Ad-based vaccine development in the context of a few diseases. This strategy embodies the incorporation of antigenic peptides within the capsid structure of viral vectors. The major capsid protein hexon has been utilized for these capsid incorporation strategies due to hexon's natural role in the generation of anti-Ad immune response and its numerical representation within the Ad virion. Using this strategy, we have developed the means to incorporate heterologous peptide epitopes specifically within the major surface-exposed domains of the Ad capsid protein hexon. Our study herein focuses on generation of multivalent vaccine vectors presenting HIV antigens within the Ad capsid protein hexon, as well as expressing an HIV antigen as a transgene. These novel vectors utilize HVR2 as an incorporation site for a twenty-four amino acid region of the HIV membrane proximal ectodomain region (MPER), derived from HIV glycoprotein gp41 (gp41). Our study herein illustrates that our multivalent anti-HIV vectors elicit a cellular anti-HIV response. Furthermore, vaccinations with these vectors, which present HIV antigens at HVR2, elicit a HIV epitope-specific humoral immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2087532465,"Dengue viruses (DENV) serotypes 1, 2, and 3 have been causing yearly outbreaks in Brazil. In this study, we report the re-introduction of DENV2 in the coast of São Paulo State. Partial envelope viral genes were sequenced from eighteen patients with dengue fever during the 2010 epidemic. Phylogenetic analysis showed this strain belongs to the American/Asian genotype and was closely related to the virus that circulated in Rio de Janeiro in 2007 and 2008. The phylogeny also showed no clustering by clinical presentation, suggesting that the disease severity could not be explained by distinct variants or genotypes. The time of the most recent common ancestor of American/Asian genotype and the São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro (SP/RJ) monophyletic cluster was estimated to be around 40 and 10 years, respectively. Since this virus was first identified in Brazil in 2007, we suggest that it was already circulating in the country before causing the first documented outbreak. This is the first description of the 2010 outbreak in the State of São Paulo, Brazil, and should contribute to efforts to control and monitor the spread of DENVs in endemic areas."
https://openalex.org/W2122722127,"In the course of modern daily life, individuals are exposed to numerous sources of electromagnetic radiation that are not present in the natural environment. The strength of the electromagnetic fields from sources such as hairdryers, computer display units and other electrical devices is modest. However, in many home and office environments, individuals can experience perpetual exposure to an “electromagnetic smog”, with occasional peaks of relatively high electromagnetic field intensity. This has led to concerns that such radiation can affect health. In particular, emissions from mobile phones or mobile phone masts have been invoked as a potential source of pathological electromagnetic radiation. Previous reports have suggested that cellular calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis is affected by the types of radiofrequency fields emitted by mobile phones. In the present study, we used a high-throughput imaging platform to monitor putative changes in cellular Ca2+ during exposure of cells to 900 MHz GSM fields of differing power (specific absorption rate 0.012–2 W/Kg), thus mimicking the type of radiation emitted by current mobile phone handsets. Data from cells experiencing the 900 Mhz GSM fields were compared with data obtained from paired experiments using continuous wave fields or no field. We employed three cell types (human endothelial cells, PC-12 neuroblastoma and primary hippocampal neurons) that have previously been suggested to be sensitive to radiofrequency fields. Experiments were designed to examine putative effects of radiofrequency fields on resting Ca2+, in addition to Ca2+ signals evoked by an InsP3-generating agonist. Furthermore, we examined putative effects of radiofrequency field exposure on Ca2+ store emptying and store-operated Ca2+ entry following application of the Ca2+ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin. Multiple parameters (e.g., peak amplitude, integrated Ca2+ signal, recovery rates) were analysed to explore potential impact of radiofrequency field exposure on Ca2+ signals. Our data indicate that 900 MHz GSM fields do not affect either basal Ca2+ homeostasis or provoked Ca2+ signals. Even at the highest field strengths applied, which exceed typical phone exposure levels, we did not observe any changes in cellular Ca2+ signals. We conclude that under the conditions employed in our experiments, and using a highly-sensitive assay, we could not detect any consequence of RF exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2091671275,"Deep-sea mussels harboring chemoautotrophic symbionts from hydrothermal vents and seeps are assumed to have evolved from shallow-water asymbiotic relatives by way of biogenic reducing environments such as sunken wood and whale falls. Such symbiotic associations have been well characterized in mussels collected from vents, seeps and sunken wood but in only a few from whale falls.Here we report symbioses in the gill tissues of two mussels, Adipicola crypta and Adipicola pacifica, collected from whale-falls on the continental shelf in the northwestern Pacific. The molecular, morphological and stable isotopic characteristics of bacterial symbionts were analyzed. A single phylotype of thioautotrophic bacteria was found in A. crypta gill tissue and two distinct phylotypes of bacteria (referred to as Symbiont A and Symbiont C) in A. pacifica. Symbiont A and the A. crypta symbiont were affiliated with thioautotrophic symbionts of bathymodiolin mussels from deep-sea reducing environments, while Symbiont C was closely related to free-living heterotrophic bacteria. The symbionts in A. crypta were intracellular within epithelial cells of the apical region of the gills and were extracellular in A. pacifica. No spatial partitioning was observed between the two phylotypes in A. pacifica in fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments. Stable isotopic analyses of carbon and sulfur indicated the chemoautotrophic nature of A. crypta and mixotrophic nature of A. pacifica. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of the host mussels showed that A. crypta constituted a monophyletic clade with other intracellular symbiotic (endosymbiotic) mussels and that A. pacifica was the sister group of all endosymbiotic mussels.These results strongly suggest that the symbiosis in A. pacifica is at an earlier stage in evolution than other endosymbiotic mussels. Whale falls and other modern biogenic reducing environments may act as refugia for primal chemoautotrophic symbioses between eukaryotes and prokaryotes since the extinction of ancient large marine vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W1979929174,"The African mole-rats (Bathyergidae, Rodentia) are strictly subterranean, congenitally microphthalmic rodents that are hardly ever exposed to environmental light. Because of the lack of an overt behavioural reaction to light, they have long been considered to be blind. However, recent anatomical studies have suggested retention of basic visual capabilities. In this study, we employed behavioural tests to find out if two mole-rat species are able to discriminate between light and dark, if they are able to discriminate colours and, finally, if the presence of light in burrows provokes plugging behaviour, which is assumed to have a primarily anti-predatory function.We used a binary choice test to show that the silvery mole-rat Heliophobius argenteocinereus and the giant mole-rat Fukomys mechowii exhibit a clear photoavoidance response to full-spectrum (""white""), blue and green-yellow light, but no significant reaction to ultraviolet or red light during nest building. The mole-rats thus retain dark/light discrimination capabilities and a capacity to perceive short to medium-wavelength light in the photopic range of intensities. These findings further suggest that the mole-rat S opsin has its absorption maximum in the violet/blue part of the spectrum. The assay did not yield conclusive evidence regarding colour discrimination. To test the putative role of vision in bathyergid anti-predatory behaviour, we examined the reaction of mole-rats to the incidence of light in an artificial burrow system. The presence of light in the burrow effectively induced plugging of the illuminated tunnel.Our findings suggest that the photopic vision is conserved and that low acuity residual vision plays an important role in predator avoidance and tunnel maintenance in the African mole-rats."
https://openalex.org/W1985718731,"Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) provide new possibilities for regenerative therapies. In order for this potential to be achieved, it is critical to efficiently monitor the differentiation of these hiPSCs into specific lineages. Here, we describe a lentiviral reporter vector sensitive to specific microRNAs (miRNA) to show that a single vector bearing multiple miRNA target sequences conjugated to different reporters can be used to monitor hiPSC formation and subsequent differentiation from human fetal fibroblasts (HFFs). The reporter vector encodes EGFP conjugated to the targets of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) specific miRNAs (miR-302a and miR-302d) and mCherry conjugated to the targets of differentiated cells specific miRNAs (miR-142-3p, miR-155, and miR-223). The vector was used to track reprogramming of HFF to iPSC. HFFs co-transduced with this reporter vector and vectors encoding 4 reprogramming factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and cMYC) were mostly positive for EGFP (67%) at an early stage of hiPSC formation. EGFP expression gradually disappeared and mCherry expression increased indicating less miRNAs specific to differentiated cells and expression of miRNAs specific to hESCs. Upon differentiation of the hiPSC into embryoid bodies, a large fraction of these hiPSCs regained EGFP expression and some of those cells became single positive for EGFP. Further differentiation into neural lineages showed distinct structures demarcated by either EGFP or mCherry expression. These findings demonstrate that a miRNA dependent reporter vector can be a useful tool to monitor living cells during reprogramming of hiPSC and subsequent differentiation to lineage specific cells."
https://openalex.org/W2092855932,"Cases of smear-negative TB have increased dramatically in high prevalence HIV settings and pose considerable diagnostic and management challenges.Between February 2006 and July 2007, a cohort study nested within a cluster-randomised trial of community-based case finding strategies for TB in Harare, Zimbabwe was undertaken. Participants who had negative sputum smears and remained symptomatic of TB were follow-up for one year with standardised investigations including HIV testing, repeat sputum smears, TB culture and chest radiography. Defaulters were actively traced to the community. The objectives were to investigate the incidence and risk factors for TB. TB was diagnosed in 218 (18.2%) participants, of which 39.4% was bacteriologically confirmed. Most cases (84.2%) were diagnosed within 3 months, but TB incidence remained high thereafter (111.3 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI: 86.6 to 146.3). HIV prevalence was 63.3%, and HIV-infected individuals had a 3.5-fold higher risk of tuberculosis than HIV-negative individuals.We found that diagnosis of TB was insensitive and slow, even with early radiography and culture. Until more sensitive and rapid diagnostic tests become widely available, a much more proactive and integrated approach towards prompt initiation of ART, ideally from within TB clinics and without waiting for TB to be excluded, is needed to minimise the risk and consequences of diagnostic delay."
https://openalex.org/W1985589749,"The nuclear p68 RNA helicase is a prototypical member of the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases. p68 RNA helicase has been implicated in cell proliferation and early organ development and maturation. However, the functional role of p68 RNA helicase in these biological processes at the molecular level is not well understood. We previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of p68 RNA helicase mediates the effects of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in induction of epithelial mesenchymal transition by promoting β-catenin nuclear translocation. Here, we report that phosphorylation of p68 RNA helicase at Y593 upregulates transcription of the Snail1 gene. The phosphorylated p68 activates transcription of the Snail1 gene by promoting histone deacetylase (HDAC)1 dissociation from the Snail1 promoter. Our results showed that p68 interacted with the nuclear remodeling and deacetylation complex MBD3:Mi-2/NuRD. Thus, our data suggested that a DEAD-box RNA unwindase could potentially regulate gene expression by functioning as a protein 'displacer' to modulate protein-protein interactions at the chromatin-remodeling complex."
https://openalex.org/W1965347603,"Background Insects have multiple hemocyte morphotypes with different functions as do vertebrates, however, their hematopoietic lineages are largely unexplored with the exception of Drosophila melanogaster. Methodology/Principal Findings To study the hematopoietic lineage of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, we investigated in vivo and in vitro differentiation of hemocyte precursors in the hematopoietic organ (HPO) into the four mature hemocyte subsets, namely, plasmatocytes, granulocytes, oenocytoids, and spherulocytes. Five days after implantation of enzymatically-dispersed HPO cells from a GFP-expressing transgenic line into the hemocoel of normal larvae, differentiation into plasmatocytes, granulocytes and oenocytoids, but not spherulocytes, was observed. When the HPO cells were cultured in vitro, plasmatocytes appeared rapidly, and oenocytoids possessing prophenol oxidase activity appeared several days later. HPO cells were also able to differentiate into a small number of granulocytes, but not into spherulocytes. When functionally mature plasmatocytes were cultured in vitro, oenocytoids were observed 10 days later. These results suggest that the hemocyte precursors in HPO first differentiate into plasmatocytes, which further change into oenocytoids. Conclusions/Significance From these results, we propose that B. mori hemocytes can be divided into two major lineages, a granulocyte lineage and a plasmatocyte-oenocytoid lineage. The origins of the spherulocytes could not be determined in this study. We construct a model for the hematopoietic lineages at the larval stage of B. mori."
https://openalex.org/W1993956106,"Trypanosoma spp, biologically transmitted by the tsetse fly in Africa, are a major cause of illness resulting in both high morbidity and mortality among humans, cattle, wild ungulates, and other species. However, tsetse fly distributions change rapidly due to environmental changes, and fine-scale distribution maps are few. Due to data scarcity, most presence/absence estimates in Kenya prior to 2000 are a combination of local reports, entomological knowledge, and topographic information. The availability of tsetse fly abundance data are limited, or at least have not been collected into aggregate, publicly available national datasets. Despite this limitation, other avenues exist for estimating tsetse distributions including remotely sensed data, climate information, and statistical tools.Here we present a logistic regression model of tsetse abundance. The goal of this model is to estimate the distribution of tsetse fly in Kenya in the year 2000, and to provide a method by which to anticipate their future distribution. Multiple predictor variables were tested for significance and for predictive power; ultimately, a parsimonious subset of variables was identified and used to construct the regression model with the 1973 tsetse map. These data were validated against year 2000 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates. Mapcurves Goodness-Of-Fit scores were used to evaluate the modeled fly distribution against FAO estimates and against 1973 presence/absence data, each driven by appropriate climate data.Logistic regression can be effectively used to produce a model that projects fly abundance under elevated greenhouse gas scenarios. This model identifies potential areas for tsetse abandonment and expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2110943681,"The mechanism by which enzymes recognize the “uniform” collagen triple helix is not well understood. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) cleave collagen after the Gly residue of the triplet sequence Gly∼[Ile/Leu]-[Ala/Leu] at a single, unique, position along the peptide chain. Sequence analysis of types I-III collagen has revealed a 5-triplet sequence pattern in which the natural cleavage triplets are always flanked by a specific distribution of imino acids. NMR and MMP kinetic studies of a series of homotrimer peptides that model type III collagen have been performed to correlate conformation and dynamics at, and near, the cleavage site to collagenolytic activity. A peptide that models the natural cleavage site is significantly more active than a peptide that models a potential but non-cleavable site just 2-triplets away and NMR studies show clearly that the Ile in the leading chain of the cleavage peptide is more exposed to solvent and less locally stable than the Ile in the middle and lagging chains. We propose that the unique local instability of Ile at the cleavage site in part arises from the placement of the conserved Pro at the P3 subsite. NMR studies of peptides with Pro substitutions indicate that the local dynamics of the three chains are directly modulated by their proximity to Pro. Correlation of peptide activity to NMR data shows that a single locally unstable chain at the cleavage site, rather than two or three labile chains, is more favorable for cleavage by MMP-1 and may be the determining factor for collagen recognition.

The triple helical structure allows collagen to be degraded by only a few proteinases including a group of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (5Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

These MMPs (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-13, MMP-14, MMP-18) can bind and cleave interstitial collagens at a unique locus approximately three-fourths away from the N terminus of the collagens (14Fields G.B. J Theor. Biol. 1991; 153: 585-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cleavage site is after the Gly residue in the sequence of Gly∼[Ile/Leu]-[Ala/Leu]. Interestingly, there are dozens of other sites in the collagens that contain Gly∼Ile/Leu bonds but they are not hydrolyzed (14Fields G.B. J Theor. Biol. 1991; 153: 585-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which MMPs recognize the single scissile bond in the repeating Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets and uniform triple helical conformation is still poorly understood. It has been shown that the amino acid sequence alone is not sufficient for the high specificity of collagen recognition by MMPs (15Fields G.B. Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. J. Biol.

The unique triple helical conformation of collagen must also play an important role, as indicated by significant differences in processing of native collagen and denatured collagen. Native collagen can mainly be degraded by some MMPs, while denatured collagen is susceptible to a variety of proteinases (15Fields G.B. Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. J. Biol.

Collagen is cleaved at a single site, but denatured collagen is cleaved at multiple sites containing the sequence Gly∼[Ile/Leu]-Yaa (17Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Stricklin G.P. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11534-11539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, native collagen is a much better substrate than denatured collagen for some MMPs (17Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Stricklin G.P. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11534-11539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus believed that the triple helical conformation of collagen is crucial for MMP recognition. It has been suggested that the variation in sequence around the cleavage site would lead to a change in the triple helical conformation and/or dynamics of collagen at the collagenase cleavage site, and this change would be identified by MMPs (14Fields G.B.

The weak helix hypothesis, which got the most attention, proposed that the cleavage site region is locally unstable because of deficiency in imino acids, and therefore the scissile bond could be exposed to the enzyme attack (21Miller E.J.

Types I and III collagens can be cleaved by trypsin and α-chymotrypsin around the collagenase cleavage site, suggesting relaxation of the helix in this region (24Ryhänen L. Zaragoza E.J. Uitto J.

The correct distribution of imino acids has been shown to be important for cleavage, as mutation of Ile776 or Gln774 and Ala777 to Pro residues in type I collagen eliminated MMP-1 and MMP-8 activity, suggesting that extra imino acids at the cleavage sites may make the sites more rigid and inaccessible for MMPs (26Hasty K.A.

The EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the triple helix needs to unwind locally so that a single chain can enter into the active site of MMPs or the active site of MMPs undergoes large conformational changes (32Chung L.

Biol. 2002; 319: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Computational simulations of type I collagen also indicated that the α2 chain is locally unfolded with disrupted hydrogen bonds N-terminal to the cleavage sites and simulations of peptide models of type III collagen show that the real cleavage site is more exposed to solvent and more flexible than the other four potential cleavage sites (33Stultz C.M.

Taken together, these studies suggest that the conformation and dynamics at the collagenase cleavage site is critical for collagen recognition by MMPs.

Here we use NMR to characterize the differences in conformation and dynamics at the natural Gly∼Ile-Ala cleavage site versus potential cleavage sites. It has been shown that peptide models of the collagenase cleavage sites can be hydrolyzed by MMPs in a similar fashion to native collagens, indicating that they can serve as good biological models for MMP recognition (40Ottl J.

A series of homotrimer peptides modeling the natural cleavage site and potential but noncleavable sites in type III collagen are designed and investigated by NMR. Correlation of NMR conformation and dynamics of the peptides to collagenolytic activity provides evidence that increased dynamics and decreased local stability of Ile in just a single chain is important for increased MMP-1 kinetics. We present evidence that the neighboring imino acids, particularly the conserved Pro at the P3 subsite, modulate the local conformation and dynamics of the unique Ile at the natural cleavage site and thus the specificity of the recognition by MMPs. The peptide sets were synthesized by the Tufts University Core Facility (Boston, MA) with 15N and/or 13C-labeled amino acids at selective positions for NMR characterization. Peptides T3–778, T3–778[IT-PO], and T3–778[P-A] were selectively 15N labeled at positions of Gly16, Ile17, Gly22, Ala23, and Gly31. Peptide T3–778[I-L] was selectively 15N labeled at positions Gly16, Leu17, Gly22, Ala23, and Gly31, while peptide T3–785 was selectively 15N/13C doubly labeled at positions Gly15, Leu16, Ala17, Gly18, and Gly24 (Table 1). The NMR samples for all peptides were prepared in 10% D2O/90% H2O at pH 3.1 with concentrations of 6 mm.TABLE 1Triple helical peptides modeling the collagenase cleavage sites and their activitiesPeptideSequencekcat/Kmm−1s−1T3–778(GPO)4-GPL-GIA-GIT-GAR-(GPO)5GY1253 ± 249T3–778[I-L](GPO)4-GPL-GLA-GIT-GAR-(GPO)5GY1562 ± 130T3–778[IT-PO](GPO)4-GPL-GIA-GPO-GAR-(GPO)5GY883 ± 134T3–778[P-A](GPO)4-GAL-GIA-GIT-GAR-(GPO)5GY125 ± 50T3–785PO(GPO)2-GIT-GAR-GLA-GPO-(GPO)3GY173 ± 81 Open table in a new tab Peptides and enzymes were dissolved in enzyme assay buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 0.05% brij-35). MMP-1 was mixed with varying concentrations of each substrate and incubated at 20 °C. At varying time points the reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 mm EDTA, and the reaction product was determined by RP-HPLC analysis using an Agilent HP1100 HPLC system equipped with a C8 column. Melting temperatures were determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The temperature used for hydrolysis and NMR studies is 5–30 °C below the melting temperature for each peptide (data not shown).

Hydrogen exchange experiments were performed at 10 °C and pD 2.3–2.8 for the peptide sets (2.74 for T3–778, 2.34 for T3–778[I-L], 2.53 for T3–778[IT-PO], 2.56 for T3–778[P-A] and 2.41 for T3–785), where the pD is corrected for the glass electrode solvent isotope artifact (55Glasoe P.K. Long F.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1960; 64: 188-189Crossref Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). All samples were equilibrated in H2O at 10 °C for a minimum of 48 h to ensure that the monomer:trimer equilibrium is reached. The samples were then lyophilized, re-dissolved in 100% D2O and quickly transferred to the spectrometer which was equilibrated at 10 °C. A series of HSQC spectra were acquired every 5 min (64 t1 increments and 2 scans per increment) (except every 10 min for T3–778) immediately after the sample was placed in the probe to allow the measurements of fast-exchanging amide protons, which are replaced by deuterons within several hours. Then the HSQC spectra were acquired every 40 min to monitor the slowly exchanging amide protons. The hydrogen exchange rates kex were determined by a non-linear least squares fit using the equation I(t) = (I0 − I∞)exp(−kext), where It, I0, and I∞ are the intensities at time t, at time 0 and at a final time point when the exchange is completed. The protection factor P is defined as p = kint/kex, where kint is the intrinsic exchange rate of amide protons in the monomer state at a specific pH and temperature (56Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). The error of kint was estimated by assuming an experimental uncertainty of ±0.1 °C and ±0.02 pH units. The error of the protection factor P is calculated as follows in Equation 1.Perror =(kint kex ) error =(kint kex )∗(kint, error kint )2+(kex, error kex )2(Eq. 1) The hydrogen exchange process under native conditions is proposed to follow a two step model (57Huyghues-Despointes B.M. Pace C.N. Englander S.W. Scholtz J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 168: 69-92PubMed Google Scholar, 58Englander S.W. Krishna M.M.G. Nat. Struct.

Protein Chem. 1966; 21: 287-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar) in Equation 2,N−H( closed )⟵kcl⟶kopN−H( open )⟶kintN−D(Eq. 2) where kcl and kop are the rate constants for structural closing and opening, respectively, and kint is the intrinsic rate constant at which the amide protons in the open form, or random coil state, exchange with deuterons. There is equilibrium between the open state and closed state for amide protons, while the exchange from the open form N-H to N-D is irreversible. Therefore, the measurable rate constant kex can be derived as follows in Equation 3.kex=kopkint/(kop+kcl+kint)(Eq. 3) When kcl ≫ kop and kcl ≫ kint (the EX2 exchange conditions), kex can be defined by a simpler Equation 4,kex=kopkint/kcl=(kop/kd)kint=Kopkint(Eq. 4) where Kop is the equilibrium constant for structural opening and can be related to the free energy for NH unfolding in Equation 5,ΔGHX=−RTln⁡Kop=−RTln⁡(kex/kint)=RTln⁡P(Eq. 5) where R is the gas constant and T is the temperature. Therefore, assuming the EX2 exchange, ΔGHX can represent the local conformational stabilities for each residue and can be calculated from the values of the protection factor P derived from hydrogen exchange measurements. The amino acid sequences around the collagenase cleavage sites in human types I-III collagen were examined to evaluate if they share any unique features (Fig. 1a). Sequences of types I α(1) and α(2), type II and type III collagens were compared and show three conserved residues in addition to the Gly at the cleavage sites: one 4-hydroxyproline (Hyp) and one Pro in the two triplets immediately preceding or N-terminal to the cleavage site and one Leu in the third triplet following or C-terminal to the cleavage sites (Fig. 1a). The α1 chain of type I and the α1 chain of type II collagens share the most sequence similarity for the 6 residues surrounding the collagenase cleavage sites (GPQGIAGQR for type I α(1) and GPQGLAGQR for type II). The α1 chains of type I and type III collagens contain the same cleavage triplet GIA and the two triplets immediately following the cleavage sites do not have any imino acids. However, the α2 chain of type I collagen contains the cleavage triplet Gly∼Leu-Leu, which has a large residue Leu (rather than a small Ala) following the scissile bond as well as a Hyp in the following triplet. The cleavage triplet Gly∼Ile-Ala in the α1 chains of type I and type III collagens is 100% conserved across different species spanning from rat to canis (supplemental Fig. S1). The cleavage triplet Gly∼Leu-Ala in type II collagen also has Leu 100% conserved. However, the cleavage triplet Gly∼Leu-Leu in the α2 chain of type I collagen has three occurrences of the scissile bond Gly∼Leu converted to Gly∼Ile or Gly∼Val and it has the conserved Hyp in the preceding two triplets substituted by Ala 4 out of 8 times (supplemental Fig. S1). The triplet Gly∼Leu-Leu occurs only once in human types I-III collagens, while Gly∼Ile-Ala and Gly∼Leu-Ala each occurs 9 times. Compared with the α1 chains, the α2 chain of type I collagen also has the least imino acid triplets (supplemental Fig. S2). The rarity and less conserved Gly∼Leu-Leu, the presence of Hyp following the cleavage triplet despite the poorer content of imino acids in the α2 chain, suggest that the cleavage triplet Gly∼Leu-Leu in the α2 chain of type I collagen may display a dissimilar pattern for collagenase recognition, compared with other cleavage triplets Gly∼Ile-Ala/Gly∼Leu-Ala in the α1 chains of type I and the chains of types II and III. A 5-triplet model of the collagenase cleavage sites could be built for the α1 chains of types I-III collagen (Fig. 1b). The cleavage triplet Gly∼Ile-Ala/Gly∼Leu-Ala requires the presence of two imino acid containing triplets N-terminal to the cleavage site as well as two non-imino acid containing triplets C-terminal to the cleavage site. Previous systematic sequence analysis led to a proposal that all the information necessary for efficient collagenolysis is contained in a 25-residue stretch, which is distinguished by a tight triple helix with high imino acid content prior to the cleavage site and a loose triple helix with low imino acid content following the cleavage site (14Fields G.B. J Theor. Biol. 1991; 153: 585-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lauer-Fields J.L. Juska D. Fields G.B. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Here we propose that 15 key residues may be enough to define collagen recognition by MMPs. To test the hypothesis that the 5-triplet model is sufficient for hydrolysis, the amino acid sequences across all of human types I-III collagens are analyzed. The 5-triplet model highlights the importance of the juxtaposition of imino acids to non-imino acids in recognition by MMPs. The model can be described as a region containing two imino acid containing triplets followed by three non-imino acid containing triplets. The distribution of imino acid triplets and non-imino acid triplets in interstitial collagens was analyzed, to see if any other regions besides the natural cleavage region display the unique features of the 5-triplet model. The cumulative frequency plot of the imino acid containing triplets was first done, and the almost linear shape indicated that the imino acid triplets are pretty evenly distributed across collagen and there is no obvious region extremely rich or poor in imino acids (supplemental Fig. S2). Further analysis of collagen sequences was done to identify whether there is any pattern in the distribution of imino acid triplets and non-imino acid triplets (Fig. 2). Collagen sequences were categorized into stretches of m imino acid triplets followed by n non-imino acid triplets (m+n triplet pattern). Type III collagen contains 87 such stretches (excluding 8 terminal triplets): 30 stretches contain only one imino acid triplet followed by one or two non-imino acid triplets while only 7 stretches contain at least 2 imino acid triplets followed by at least 3 non-imino acid triplets (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained for other collagens: the α1 chains of types I and type II collagen only have 9 and 5 stretches containing at least 2 imino acid triplets followed by at least 3 non-imino acid triplets, including one stretch containing the natural clea"

We engineered and heterologously expressed a soluble form of NUCB1 (sNUCB1) and characterized its biophysical and biochemical properties. We show that sNUCB1 exists as a dimer in solution and that each monomer binds two divalent calcium cations. Calcium binding causes conformational changes in sNUCB1 as judged by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy experiments. Earlier reports suggested that NUCB1 might interact with heterotrimeric G protein α subunits. We show that dimeric calcium-free sNUCB1 binds to expressed Gαi1 and that calcium binding inhibits the interaction. The binding of sNUCB1 to Gαi1 inhibits its basal rate of GDP release and slows its rate and extent of GTPγS uptake. Additionally, our tissue culture experiments show that sNUCB1 prevents receptor-mediated Gαi-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Thus, we conclude that sNUCB1 is a calcium-dependent guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) for Gαi1. To our knowledge, sNUCB1 is the first example of a calcium-dependent GDI for heterotrimeric G proteins. We also show that the mechanism of GDI activity of sNUCB1 is unique and does not arise from the consensus GoLoco motif found in RGS proteins. We propose that cytoplasmic NUCB1 might function to regulate heterotrimeric G protein trafficking and G protein-coupled receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways.

The G protein heterotrimer is composed of the Gα subunit and the Gβγ heterodimer. Upon ligand-mediated activation, GPCRs catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP on Gα leading to dissociation of the heterotrimer into Gα·GTP and Gβγ subunits (1Oldham W.M. Hamm H.E. Nat. Rev. Mol.

These individual subunits then regulate downstream signaling cascades involving effector systems like adenylyl cyclases, Ca2+ and K+ channels, phospholipase C isozymes, and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (4Pierce K.L.

This inhibits the interaction of G protein subunits with downstream effectors, which results in the turning-off of the signaling pathways. Hence, signaling by heterotrimeric G proteins is directly dependent on the lifetime of the GTP-bound state of Gα. This lifetime is regulated by GTPase-accelerating proteins (GAPs), which catalyze the rapid hydrolysis of the Gα-bound GTP to GDP and by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which inhibit the exchange of GDP for GTP in the catalytic pocket of Gα (6Siderovski D.P.

Together, GAPs and GDIs exert a regulatory control on G protein signaling. In recent years, novel interacting partners of heterotrimeric G proteins called the regulators of G protein signaling or RGS proteins have been discovered that possess GAP activity (7De Vries L.

Several members of this AGS family (AGS3-6) have been shown to function as GDIs of Gαi subunits (12Blumer J.B. Cismowski M.J. Sato M. Lanier S.M. Trends Pharmacol.

The observed GDI activity of both AGS and RGS proteins toward Gαi/o is attributed to a 19-amino acid consensus sequence called the GoLoco motif (9Kimple R.J. De Vries L. Tronchère H. Behe C.I.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) established the interaction of a novel Golgi-resident Ca2+-binding protein Nucleobindin 1 or NUCB1, specifically with the heterotrimeric G protein α subunit, Gαi2. Subsequently, Lin et al. (16Lin P. Le-Niculescu H. Hofmeister R. McCaffery J.M. Jin M. Hennemann H. McQuistan T. De Vries L. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1515-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) demonstrated that NUCB1 interacts exclusively with the adenylyl cyclase inhibitory (Gαi) and stimulatory (Gαs) classes of Gα subunits. In a recent study, it was shown that overexpression of NUCB1 causes redistribution of only the Gαi1 subunits and not the Gβγ subunits to the plasma membrane and regulated secretion granules (17Lin P. Fischer T. Lavoie C. Huang H. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Neurodegener. 2009; 4: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, a role for NUCB1 in modulating Gαi1 activation and the biochemistry of NUCB1-Gαi1 interaction has not been reported. NUCB1 is a 55-kDa multidomain Ca2+-binding protein that was first identified as a novel B cell growth and differentiation factor associated with lupus syndrome (18Kanai Y. Tanuma S. Immunol. Lett. 1992; 32: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). NUCB1 derives its trivial name, Calnuc, from its Ca2+-binding and DNA-binding ability (19Miura K. Titani K. Kurosawa Y. Kanai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain of basic residues (172–218) lies at the N terminus following the signal sequence. The Ca2+-binding domain is at the core of the protein sequence consisting of two EF hand motifs with an intervening acidic region (residues 253–316). The Ca2+-binding domain is followed by a leucine zipper domain (residues 347–389), which has been postulated to induce NUCB1 dimerization (Fig. 1A) (20Miura K. Kurosawa Y. Kanai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1388-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The C-terminal (CT) region following the leucine zipper domain is predicted to be intrinsically disordered and unstructured. Intriguingly, NUCB1 is strongly conserved from flies to humans (21Kanuru M. Samuel J.J. Balivada L.M. Aradhyam G.K.

Neurodegener. 2009; 4: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The N-terminal signal sequence of NUCB1 targets it to different membrane compartments and its deletion renders NUCB1 cytosolic. Recently, Brodeur et al. (26Brodeur J. Larkin H. Boucher R. Thériault C. St-Louis S.C. Gagnon H. Lavoie C. Traffic. 2009; 10: 1098-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) reported the role of NUCB1 in LDL receptor-related protein 9 (LRP9) trafficking where the cytosolic NUCB1 fraction helps in LRP9 endosomal sorting and prevents its delivery to lysosomes. The ubiquitous expression of NUCB1 in various cell and tissue types results in a diverse interactome, including interacting partners like G protein α subunits, cyclooxygenases, and amyloid precursor protein (16Lin P.

Yeast two-hybrid experiments performed with various deletion constructs of either Gαi3 or NUCB1 mapped the C-terminal α5 helix domain of the G protein and the acidic region of NUCB1 (residues 264–305) to be necessary for interaction (28Lin P. Fischer T. Weiss T. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence-based studies showed that NUCB1 and Gαi protein subunits co-localize on the Golgi lumen and regulated secretion granules (17Lin P. Fischer T. Lavoie C. Huang H. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Neurodegener. 2009; 4: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because Gα subunits are ubiquitously involved in numerous signal transduction pathways in different tissue types, their interaction with NUCB1 might regulate downstream signaling events. We are interested in understanding the role of the α5 helix of the G protein α subunit in regulating nucleotide exchange rates (29Kapoor N. Menon S.T. Chauhan R. Sachdev P. Sakmar T.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 393: 882-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Marin E.P. Krishna A.G. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6988-6994Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because the α5 helix of Gα is involved in interaction with NUCB1, we characterized and studied the interaction of NUCB1 with Gαi1 in detail. In this study, we present the detailed biophysical and biochemical characterization of the Ca2+-binding ability and the oligomeric state of a heterologously expressed N-terminally truncated soluble form of NUCB1, termed sNUCB1 (Fig. 1A). We show that sNUCB1 binds Ca2+ and exists as a dimer in solution. Ca2+-free sNUCB1 preferentially binds Gαi1 and inhibits its GDP release as demonstrated by several independent assays. We have shown that overexpression of sNUCB1 in HEK293 cells markedly decreases ligand-dependent receptor-mediated Gαi inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. We conclude that sNUCB1 serves as a novel Ca2+-regulated GDI of Gαi1. Our findings suggest that NUCB1 is involved in regulating cytoplasmic G protein signaling pathways. GDP sodium salt and GTPγS tetralithium salt were purchased from Sigma. The fluorescent GTPγS analogue, mant(2′,3′-O-(N-methyl-anthraniloyl)-GTPγS was purchased from Jena Biosciences (Jena, Germany), and BODIPY-FL-GTPγS was purchased from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). The His6-tagged mutants of WT Gαi1 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the high fidelity thermostable DNA polymerase Pfu (Stratagene). The cAMP dynamic 2 kit was purchased from CisBio (Bedford, MA) for cell-based studies. All reagents and chemicals used were of highest available purity. The cDNA clones for human NUCB1 and rat Gαi1 were obtained from the ATCC. The DNA fragment for the soluble form of NUCB1 or sNUCB1, corresponding to residues 31–461 of the human NUCB1 protein without the N-terminal signal sequence (residues 1–31), was cloned into the pET28a(+) expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). Similarly, the DNA fragment corresponding to full-length WT rat Gαi1 subunit (residues 1–354) was cloned into the pET28a(+) expression vector. The vector was used to transform BL21 (DE3) cells to express an N-terminal His6 tag protein containing a PreScission protease site directly after the His6 tag. The expressed construct for sNUCB1 served as a template for introducing site-specific mutations using the QuikChange system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate sNUCB1(W232A/W333A) or for introducing a missense mutation to generate the truncated version of the protein, namely sNUCB1(W333Ter). All proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells grown in the presence of 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Cells were grown at 37 °C to A600 nm of ∼0.7 and then induced with 500 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (United States Biological). Post-induction, the culture was grown overnight at 17 °C and subsequently harvested. The resulting pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, bovine lung aprotinin (20 mg/ml), 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). Thereafter, the cells were lysed, and the expressed His6 tag protein was purified from crude extract by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column pre-equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for sNUCB1 and its variants and buffer A′ (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 10 μm GDP, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for WT Gαi1. The bound His6 tag protein was eluted from the column by using buffer A or buffer A′ supplemented with 500 mm imidazole. The His6 tag was cleaved by PreScissionTM protease, which was subsequently removed. To remove Ca2+ from sNUCB1 or its variants, the proteins were extensively dialyzed against buffer A supplemented with 5 mm EGTA and 1 mm EDTA, which are also eventually removed through dialysis. Finally, SEC was done using a Superdex200 26/60 HR column equilibrated with buffer S (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) for sNUCB1 and its variants and equilibrated in buffer S′ (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 10 μm GDP, 1 mm DTT) for WT Gαi1 to obtain homogeneously pure protein. The typical yield for sNUCB1 and its variants was ∼5 mg/liter and for WT Gαi1 ∼12–15 mg/liter. The purity of the proteins was assessed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining after the proteins were separated through SDS-PAGE. The purity of all proteins was greater than 95%. ITC was performed at 25 °C (298 K) using a MicroCal VP-ITC (MicroCal, Northhampton, MA) calorimeter. To measure quantitatively the binding of Ca2+ or WT Gαi1·GDP to sNUCB1, 2 ml of 50 μm sNUCB1 (Ca2+-free) and 700 μl of either 500 μm CaCl2·6H2O (prepared in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) or 600 μm WT Gαi1·GDP (prepared in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 10 μm GDP, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) was used and thoroughly degassed. Contents of the sample cell were stirred continuously at 280 rpm during the experiment. A typical titration of sNUCB1 involved 50 injections each of 5 μl of CaCl2·6H2O (500 μm) or WT Gαi1·GDP (600 μm) into a sample cell containing 1.4 ml of sNUCB1 (50 μm). The heat of dilution of the titrant (CaCl2·6H2O or WT Gαi1·GDP) was subtracted from the titration data for base-line correction. The base line-corrected data were analyzed with MicroCal OriginTM 6.0 software to determine the change in enthalpy (ΔH) and association constant (Ka). Thermal titration data fit showed two sets of binding sites for Ca2+ to sNUBC1. The parameters were calculated based on three or more independent titration experiments. Each numerical value reported is the mean ± S.E. among the independent data sets. Complex formation between sNUCB1 and Gαi1 was monitored using SEC. 150 μm sNUCB1 (−Ca2+/+Ca2+) was incubated with 256 μm Gαi1·(GDP/GTPγS) in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GDP, and 1 mm DTT at 30 °C for 20 min with minimal shaking to enable saturation binding. WT Gαi1 in the GTPγS-bound state was generated by incubating WT Gαi1·GDP with 5 mm GTPγS for 30 min at 30 °C to ensure complete exchange of nucleotide. Furthermore, the complete exchange was confirmed by the AlF4− exchange assay. About 200 μl of the reaction mixture was injected onto Superdex200 10/30 GL column attached to AKTA FPLC (GE Healthcare) and run at 4 °C. Elution was done with the incubation buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with 0.35-ml fractions collected. Peak fractions were analyzed through SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-stained to analyze the complex formation. Purified sNUCB1 or the heavy molecular weight standards (GE Healthcare) were injected onto a Superdex200 10/30 GL column pre-equilibrated with buffer S, and the normalized absorbance of the eluting peak was plotted. A calibration curve of Kav (Ve − Vo/Vc − Vo) versus log10(molecular weight) was plotted, where Ve is the elution volume; Vo is the column void volume corresponding to the elution of blue dextran, and Vc is the geometric column volume. The data were fit to a straight line curve like Y = A + Bx, where A = 1.915 and B = 0.311 were obtained from the fit. Therefore, for a Y = Kav value, the corresponding value of log10 (molecular weight) was obtained to estimate the molecular mass of sNUCB1 and sNUCB1(W333Ter). The light scattering data were collected using a Superdex200 10/30, HR SEC column (GE Healthcare), connected to an HPLC system (Agilent 1200, Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE) equipped with an autosampler. The elution from SEC was monitored by a photodiode array UV-visible detector (Agilent Technologies), differential refractometer (OPT-Lab rEx, Wyatt Corp., Santa Barbara, CA), static and dynamic, multiangle laser light scattering detector (HELEOS II with QELS capability, Wyatt Corp.). The SEC-UV/LS/RI system was equilibrated in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) for sNUCB1 alone and in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GDP, 1 mm DTT) for WT and truncated sNUCB1/G protein complex at the flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Two software packages were used for data collection and analysis; the Chemstation software (Agilent Technologies) controlled the HPLC operation and data collection from the multiwavelength UV-visible detector, and the ASTRA software (Wyatt Corp., Santa Barbara, CA) collected data from the RI detector and the LS detectors and recorded the UV trace at 280 nm sent from the photodiode array detector. The weight average molecular masses, Mw, were determined across the entire elution profile in the intervals of 1 s from static LS measurement using ASTRA software as described previously (32Folta-Stogniew E. Williams K.R. J. Biomol. Tech. 1999; 10: 51-63PubMed Google Scholar). The approach uses a Rayleigh-Debye-Gans light scattering model (Equation 1), which relates the amount of scattered light to the concentration and weight average molecular weight of solute and second virial coefficient,K∗cR(θ)=1M¯w+2A2c(Eq. 1) where R(θ) is the intensity of excess scattered light at angle θ; c is the concentration of the solute, M̄w is the weight average molecular weight of the solute; A2 is the second virial coefficient; K* is an optical parameter equal to 4π2n2 (dn/dc)2/(λ04NA), where n is the refractive index; dn/dc is the refractive index increment for the solute; NA is Avogadro's number, and λ0 is the wavelength of the scattered light. DLS measurements were made “on line” at an angle of 100° with a 2-s collection time. Time-resolved scatter intensity fluctuations were analyzed using Astra software (Wyatt Corp.), which implements the cumulants method (33Koppel D.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1972; 574814Crossref Scopus (2730) Google Scholar) to determine the time dependence of diffusive motion also referred to as the intensity correlation function, G(T), as shown in Equation 2 (34Cummins P.G. Staples E.J. J. Physics E-Scientific Instruments. 1981; 14: 1171-1177Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar),G(T)=B{1+α(exp(−DTq2t))2}(Eq. 2) where B is the average base-line intensity; α is an instrument-specific correction factor; DT is the concentration-dependent translational diffusion constant of the solute; t is a delay time, and q is the scattering vector equal to (4πn)/λsinθ/2, where n is the refractive index of the solvent; λ is the wavelength of the scattered light, and θ is the scattering angle. Equation 2 describes the relationship between the time dependence of fluctuation in scatter intensity and the translational diffusion coefficient. The value of DT can be used to estimate the apparent hydrodynamic radius of an equivalent sphere using Stokes-Einstein relationship shown in Equation 3,Rh=kT6πηDT(Eq. 3) where k is the Boltzmann constant; T is the absolute temperature, and η is the temperature-corrected viscosity of the solution. The concentration-dependent changes in the weight average molecular mass determined for the apex of the eluting peak for sNUBC1 were used to determine the dimerization constant. The weight average molecular weights were plotted as a function of protein concentration for sNUCB1; error bars represent ±3% of M̄w for concentrations above 100 μg/ml, ±5% of M̄w for concentrations between 1 and 100 μg/ml, and ±10% of the M̄w for concentrations below 1 μg/ml. Lines represent the nonlinear least square fits to a monomer-dimer association model for sNUCB1 dimerization. The concentration-dependent changes in the M̄w determined for the apex of the eluting peak were used to determine the complexation of Gαi1 with sNUCB1/sNUCB1(W333Ter). The M̄w values were plotted as a function of total protein concentration for complexation; error bars represent ±3% of M̄w for concentrations above 100 μg/ml, ±5% of M̄w for concentrations between 1 and 100 μg/ml, and ±10% of M̄w for concentrations below 1 μg/ml. Lines represent the nonlinear least square fits to a stimulated complexation model using Origin 6.0. Steady-state fluorescence measurements for sNUCB1 were carried out in a SPEX τ3 spectrofluorimeter (Jobin-Yvon Instruments) at 25 °C. The excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm, although emission spectra were collected from 310 to 460 nm. The excitation and emission slit widths were 2.5 and 5.0 nm, respectively. 178 nm Ca2+-free sNUCB1 equilibrated in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl was incubated with increasing concentrations of Ca2+ with constant stirring for 5 min. Thereafter, Trp emission fluorescence spectra were collected for each concentration of Ca2+ added. The excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm, and the emission spectra were collected from 315 to 460 nm with the excitation slit and emission slit width being 2.5 and 5 nm, respectively. 333 nm of protein was equilibrated in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl. To study the interaction between the protein and the quenchers, small aliquots of the quenchers were added incrementally from a concentrated stock solution. In the case of potassium iodide, a small quantity of Na2S2O3 (0.1 mm) was added to prevent it from forming free triiodide (I3−). The accessibility of Trp was monitored by analyzing the quenching data using the Stern-Volmer Equation 4,Fo/F=1+KSV[Q](Eq. 4) where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of quenchers, respectively; [Q] is the concentration of the quenching molecules, and KSV is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant. In the case of purely collisional quenching mechanism, the Stern-Volmer plot of F0/F versus [Q] is linear with a slope equal to KSV. Steady-state fluorescence measurements experiments were carried out in a SPEX τ3 spectrofluorimeter (Jobin-Yvon Instruments) at 25 °C. 15 μm WT Gαi1 was incubated with 50 μm sNUCB1(W232A/W333A) in the reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT) for 5 min with constant stirring. Thereafter, mGTPγS (15 μm) was added to the reaction mixture. FRET was monitored by exciting the intrinsic Trp fluorescence at 295 nm and measuring the fluorescence emission from 310 to 540 nm. In all cases, blank spectra containing buffer with sNUCB1(W232A/W333A) alone were subtracted from the final spectra. Time-based fluorescence measurements were performed in a SPEX Fluorolog-2 spectrofluorometer (SPEX Industries, Edison, NJ) at 25 °C. The excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm specifically for Trp residues, although emission wavelength was set at 340 nm. The excitation and emission slit width were 5 nm each. WT Gαi1 was incubated at 25 °C in reaction buffer K (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT) with increasing amounts of sNUCB1(W232A/W333A) for 10 min with constant stirring. Thereafter, for AlF4−-dependent activation of Gαi1, a premixed solution of AlCl3− (20 mm) and NaF (1 m), respectively, was injected at 180 s. A time course of enhancement in Trp fluorescence coupled to activation was monitored in the presence of increasing concentrations of sNUCB1(W232A/W333A) in the reaction mixture. WT Gαi1 was incubated at 25 °C with increasing concentrations of sNUCB1(W232A/W333A) in reaction"
https://openalex.org/W2058270531,"Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are potent anti-cancer agents for variety of cancer types. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) has been approved as a drug to treat cutaneous T cell lymphoma, and the combination of HDACi and other agents have been actively tested in many clinical trials. Adenovirus 5 early region 1A (E1A) has been shown to exhibit high tumor suppressor activity, and gene therapy using E1A has been tested in clinical trials. Here, we showed that proapoptotic activity of HDACi was robustly enhanced by E1A in multiple cancer cells, but not in normal cells. Moreover, we showed that combination of E1A gene therapy and SAHA showed high therapeutic efficacy with low toxicity in vivo ovarian and breast xenograft models. SAHA downregulated Bcl-XL and upregulated proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bim, whose expression was further enhanced by E1A in cancer cells. These alterations of Bcl-2 family proteins were critical for apoptosis induced by the combination in cancer cells. SAHA enhanced acetylation of histone H3 in Bim promoter region, while E1A upregulated Egr-1, which was directly involved in Bim transactivation. Together, our results provide not only a novel insight into the mechanisms underlying anti-tumor activity of E1A, but also a rationale for the combined HDACi and E1A gene therapy in future clinical trials."

https://openalex.org/W2026264889,"p73 is a member of the p53 protein family. Although the tumor suppressor function of p53 is clearly defined, the role of p73 in tumorigenesis is still a matter of debate. A complex pattern of expression of p73 isoforms makes it difficult to unambiguously interpret the experimental results. Previously, we along with others have found that the N-terminally truncated isoform of p73, ΔNp73, has potent anti-apoptotic and oncogenic properties in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we analyzed, for the first time, the regulation of ΔNp73 in a large number of gastric, gastroesophageal junction and esophageal tumors. We found that expression of ΔNp73 mRNA and protein is increased in these neoplasms. Furthermore, the upregulation of the ΔNp73 protein is significantly associated with poor patient survival. Oncogenic properties of ΔNp73 were further confirmed by finding that ΔNp73 facilitates anchorage-independent growth of gastric epithelial cells in soft agar. As little is currently known about the regulation of ΔNp73 transcription, we investigated the alternative p73 gene promoter that mediates the ΔNp73 expression. Analyzing the ΔNp73 promoter in silico as well as by using chromatin immunoprecipitation, site-directed mutagenesis and deletion analyses, we identified the evolutionary conserved region within the ΔNp73 promoter that contains binding sites for HIC1 (hypermethylated in cancer) protein. We found that HIC1 negatively regulates ΔNp73 transcription in mucosal epithelial cells. This leads to a decrease in ΔNp73 protein levels and may normally control the oncogenic potential of the ΔNp73 isoform."
https://openalex.org/W2047030440,"During this pilot clinical study, patients scheduled for elective tourniquet-applied upper limb orthopaedic surgery were recruited to investigate the effects of surgery on various biological markers (n = 10 patients).Three venous blood samples were collected from the arm at the ante-cubital fossa, at baseline (pre-operatively), 5 and 15 minutes after reperfusion (post-operatively). Neutrophil and monocyte leukocyte sub-populations were isolated by density gradient centrifugation techniques. Leukocyte activation was investigated by measuring the cell surface expression of CD62L (L-selectin), CD11b (Mac-1) and the intracellular production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), via flow cytometry. C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured using a clinical chemistry analyser. Plasma concentrations of protein C and von Willebrand factor (vWF) were measured using enzyme-linked fluorescent assays (ELFA).Following tourniquet-applied upper limb orthopaedic surgery, there was a decrease in neutrophil CD62L expression (p = 0.001), an increase in CD11b expression and in the intracellular production of H2O2 by neutrophils and monocytes (p<0.05). An increase in CRP concentration (p<0.001), a decrease in protein C concentration (p = 0.004), with a trend towards elevated vWF levels (p = 0.232) were also observed during this time.Conventionally, patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery have been monitored in the peri-operative period by means of CRP, which is a non-specific marker of inflammation. This test cannot differentiate between inflammation due to current or pre-existing disease processes and the development of ischaemia-reperfusion injury surgery. The findings from this study suggest that markers such as CD11b, protein C and H2O2 may provide alternative ways of assessing leukocyte and coagulation activation peri-operatively. It is proposed that by allowing orthopaedic surgeons access to laboratory markers such as CD11b, protein C and H2O2, an accurate assessment of the extent of inflammation due to surgery per se could be made."
https://openalex.org/W1978036386,"Background The HIV-1 subtype B epidemic in Brazil is peculiar because of the high frequency of isolates having the GWGR tetramer at V3 loop region. It has been suggested that GWGR is a distinct variant and less pathogenic than other subtype B isolates. Methodology/Principal Findings Ninety-four percent of the HIV-1 subtype B worldwide sequences (7689/8131) obtained from the Los Alamos HIV database contain proline at the tetramer of the V3 loop of the env gene (GPGR) and only 0.74% (60/8131) have tryptophan (GWGR). By contrast, 48.4% (161/333) of subtype B isolates from Brazil have proline, 30.6% (102/333) contain tryptophan and 10.5% (35/333) have phenylalanine (F) at the second position of the V3 loop tip. The proportion of tryptophan and phenylalanine in Brazilian isolates is much higher than in worldwide subtype B sequences (chi-square test, p = 0.0001). The combined proportion of proline, tryptophan and phenylalanine (GPGR+GWGR+GFGR) of Brazilian isolates corresponds to 89% of all amino acids in the V3 loop. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that almost all subtype B isolates in Brazil have a common origin regardless of their motif (GWGR, GPGR, GGGR, etc.) at the V3 tetramer. This shared ancestral origin was also observed in CRF28_BF and CRF29_BF in a genome region (free of recombination) derived from parental subtype B. These results imply that tryptophan substitution (e.g., GWGR-to-GxGR), which was previously associated with the change in the coreceptor usage within the host, also occurs at the population level. Conclusions/Significance Based on the current findings and previous study showing that tryptophan and phenylalanine in the V3 loop are related with coreceptor usage, we propose that tryptophan and phenylalanine in subtype B isolates in Brazil are kept by selective mechanisms due to the distinct coreceptor preferences in target cells of GWGR, GFGR and GFGR viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2036663678,"The centrosome is important for microtubule organization and cell cycle progression in animal cells. Recently, mutations in the centrosomal protein, pericentrin, have been linked to human microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism (MOPD II), a rare genetic disease characterized by severe growth retardation and early onset of type 2 diabetes among other clinical manifestations. While the link between centrosomal and cell cycle defects may account for growth deficiencies, the mechanism linking pericentrin mutations with dysregulated glucose homeostasis and pre-pubertal onset of diabetes is unknown. In this report we observed abundant expression of pericentrin in quiescent pancreatic β-cells of normal animals which led us to hypothesize that pericentrin may have a critical function in β-cells distinct from its known role in regulating cell cycle progression. In addition to the typical centrosome localization, pericentrin was also enriched with secretory vesicles in the cytoplasm. Pericentrin overexpression in β-cells resulted in aggregation of insulin-containing secretory vesicles with cytoplasmic, but not centrosomal, pericentriolar material and an increase in total levels of intracellular insulin. RNAi- mediated silencing of pericentrin in secretory β-cells caused dysregulated secretory vesicle hypersecretion of insulin into the media. Together, these data suggest that pericentrin may regulate the intracellular distribution and secretion of insulin. Mice transplanted with pericentrin-depleted islets exhibited abnormal fasting hypoglycemia and inability to regulate blood glucose normally during a glucose challenge, which is consistent with our in vitro data. This previously unrecognized function for a centrosomal protein to mediate vesicle docking in secretory endocrine cells emphasizes the adaptability of these scaffolding proteins to regulate diverse cellular processes and identifies a novel target for modulating regulated protein secretion in disorders such as diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2018112954,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play central roles in mediating cellular responses to environmental signals leading to changes in cell physiology and behaviors, including cell migration. Numerous clinical pathologies including metastasis, an invasive form of cell migration, have been linked to abnormal GPCR signaling. While the structures of some GPCRs have been defined, the in vivo roles of conserved amino acid residues and their relationships to receptor function are not fully understood. Trapped in endoderm 1 (Tre1) is an orphan receptor of the rhodopsin class that is necessary for primordial germ cell migration in Drosophila melanogaster embryos. In this study, we employ molecular genetic approaches to identify residues in Tre1 that are critical to its functions in germ cell migration.First, we show that the previously reported scattershot mutation is an allele of tre1. The scattershot allele results in an in-frame deletion of 8 amino acids at the junction of the third transmembrane domain and the second intracellular loop of Tre1 that dramatically impairs the function of this GPCR in germ cell migration. To further refine the molecular basis for this phenotype, we assayed the effects of single amino acid substitutions in transgenic animals and determined that the arginine within the evolutionarily conserved E/N/DRY motif is critical for receptor function in mediating germ cell migration within an intact developing embryo.These structure-function studies of GPCR signaling in native contexts will inform future studies into the basic biology of this large and clinically important family of receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2077408222,"The canonical Wnt/β-catenin (Wnt) pathway is a master transcriptional regulatory signaling pathway that controls numerous biological processes including proliferation and differentiation. As such, transcriptional activity of the Wnt pathway is tightly regulated and/or modulated by numerous proteins at the level of the membrane, cytosol and/or nucleus. In the nucleus, transcription of Wnt target genes by TCF/LEF-1 is repressed by the long Groucho/TLE co-repressor family. However, a truncated member of the Groucho/TLE family, amino terminal enhancer of Split (AES) can positively modulate TCF/LEF-1 activity by antagonizing long Groucho/TLE members in a dominant negative manner. We have previously shown the soluble intracellular domain of the LRP6 receptor, a receptor required for activation of the Wnt pathway, can positively regulate transcriptional activity within the Wnt pathway. In the current study, we show the soluble LRP6 intracellular domain (LRP6-ICD) can also translocate to the nucleus in CHO and HEK 293T cells and in contrast to cytosolic LRP6-ICD; nuclear LRP6-ICD represses TCF/LEF-1 activity. In agreement with previous reports, we show AES enhances TCF/LEF-1 mediated reporter transcription and further we demonstrate that AES activity is spatially regulated in HEK 293T cells. LRP6-ICD interacts with AES exclusively in the nucleus and represses AES mediated TCF/LEF-1 reporter transcription. These results suggest that LRP6-ICD can differentially modulate Wnt pathway transcriptional activity depending upon its subcellular localization and differential protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2049809317,"During breast cancer metastasis to bone, tumor cells home to bone marrow, likely targeting the stem cell niche, and stimulate osteoclasts, which mediate osteolysis required for tumor expansion. Although osteoblasts contribute to the regulation of the hematopoietic stem cell niche and control osteoclastogenesis through production of proresorptive cytokine RANKL (receptor activator of NF-κB ligand), their role in cancer metastases to bone is not fully understood. C57BL/6J mouse bone marrow cells were treated for 3-12 days with ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of 10% medium conditioned by breast carcinoma cells MDA-MB-231, 4T1, or MCF7. Treatment with cancer-derived factors resulted in a sustained 40-60% decrease in osteoblast differentiation markers, compared with treatment with ascorbic acid alone, and induced an osteoclastogenic change in the RANKL/osteoprotegerin ratio. Importantly, exposure of bone cells to breast cancer-derived factors stimulated the subsequent attachment of cancer cells to immature osteoblasts. Inhibition of γ-secretase using pharmacological inhibitors DAPT and Compound E completely reversed cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis as well as cancer-induced enhancement of cancer cell attachment, identifying γ-secretase activity as a key mediator of these effects. Thus, we have uncovered osteoblasts as critical intermediary of premetastatic signaling by breast cancer cells and pinpointed γ-secretase as a robust target for developing therapeutics potentially capable of reducing both homing and progression of cancer metastases to bone."
https://openalex.org/W1991156935,"Prevention of genital herpes is a global health priority. B5, a recently identified ubiquitous human protein, was proposed as a candidate HSV entry receptor. The current studies explored its role in HSV infection. Viral plaque formation was reduced by ∼90% in human cells transfected with small interfering RNA targeting B5 or nectin-1, an established entry receptor. However, the mechanisms were distinct. Silencing of nectin-1 prevented intracellular delivery of viral capsids, nuclear transport of a viral tegument protein, and release of calcium stores required for entry. In contrast, B5 silencing had no effect on these markers of entry, but inhibited viral protein translation. Specifically, viral immediate early genes, ICP0 and ICP4, were transcribed, polyadenylated and transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, but the viral transcripts did not associate with ribosomes or polysomes in B5-silenced cells. In contrast, immediate early gene viral transcripts were detected in polysome fractions isolated from control cells. These findings are consistent with sequencing studies demonstrating that B5 is eukaryotic initiation factor 3 subunit m (eIF3m). Although B5 silencing altered the polysome profile of cells, silencing had little effect on cellular RNA or protein expression and was not cytotoxic, suggesting that this subunit is not essential for host cellular protein synthesis. Together these results demonstrate that B5 plays a major role in the initiation of HSV protein translation and could provide a novel target for strategies to prevent primary and recurrent herpetic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2051509901,"The spread of epidemics not only depends on the average number of parasites produced per host, but also on the existence of highly infectious individuals. It is widely accepted that infectiousness depends on genetic and environmental determinants. However, even in clonal populations of host and viruses growing in homogeneous conditions, high variability can exist. Here we show that Escherichia coli cells commonly display high differentials in viral burst size, and address the kinetics of emergence of such variability with the non-lytic filamentous virus M13. By single-cell imaging of a virally-encoded fluorescent reporter, we monitor the viral charge distribution in infected bacterial populations at different time following infection. A mathematical model assuming autocatalytic virus replication and inheritance of bacterial growth rates quantitatively reproduces the experimental distributions, demonstrating that deterministic amplification of small host inhomogeneities is a mechanism sufficient to explain large and highly skewed distributions. This mechanism of amplification is general and may occur whenever a parasite has an initial phase of exponential growth within its host. Moreover, it naturally reproduces the shift towards higher virulence when the host is experimenting poor conditions, as observed commonly in host-parasite systems."
https://openalex.org/W2013970455,"Background Frequent oulomotricity problems with orthoptic testing were reported in patients with tinnitus. This study examines with objective recordings vergence eye movements in patients with somatic tinnitus patients with ability to modify their subjective tinnitus percept by various movements, such as jaw, neck, eye movements or skin pressure. Methods Vergence eye movements were recorded with the Eyelink II video system in 15 (23–63 years) control adults and 19 (36–62 years) subjects with somatic tinnitus. Findings 1) Accuracy of divergence but not of convergence was lower in subjects with somatic tinnitus than in control subjects. 2) Vergence duration was longer and peak velocity was lower in subjects with somatic tinnitus than in control subjects. 3) The number of embedded saccades and the amplitude of saccades coinciding with the peak velocity of vergence were higher for tinnitus subjects. Yet, saccades did not increase peak velocity of vergence for tinnitus subjects, but they did so for controls. 4) In contrast, there was no significant difference of vergence latency between these two groups. Interpretation The results suggest dysfunction of vergence areas involving cortical-brainstem-cerebellar circuits. We hypothesize that central auditory dysfunction related to tinnitus percept could trigger mild cerebellar-brainstem dysfunction or that tinnitus and vergence dysfunction could both be manifestations of mild cortical-brainstem-cerebellar syndrome reflecting abnormal cross-modality interactions between vergence eye movements and auditory signals."
https://openalex.org/W2063632455,"The retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and the pRb-related proteins, p130 and p107, form the ‘pocket protein’ family of cell cycle regulatory factors. A well characterized function of these proteins is the cell cycle-dependent regulation of E2F-responsive genes. The biological activity of pocket proteins is regulated by phosphorylation and for the founding member pRb it has been shown that acetylation also has an important role in modulating its function during the cell cycle. Here, we show that hyperphosphorylated retinoblastoma 2 (Rb2)/p130 also exists in an acetylated form in NIH3T3 cells. Acetylated p130 is present in the nucleus but not in the cytoplasm. Acetylation is cell cycle dependent, starting in S-phase and persisting until late G2-period. Using recombinant p130 and truncated forms for in vitro acetylation by the acetyltransferase p300, we could identify K1079 in the C-terminal part as the major acetylation site by mass spectrometry. Minor acetylation sites were pinpointed to K1068 and K1111 in the C-terminus, and K128 and K130 in the N-terminus. The human papilloma virus 16 protein-E7 preferentially binds to acetylated p130 and significantly increases in vitro p130 acetylation by p300."
https://openalex.org/W1987678808,"Sertoli cells, the support cells of mammalian spermatogenesis, are regulated by a number of nuclear factors and express retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor protein. We hypothesized that RB is an important mediator of Sertoli cell tumorigenesis in inhibin alpha knockout (Inha KO) mice. In our previous mouse studies, we found that conditional knockout (cKO) of Rb in Sertoli cells caused progressive Sertoli cell dysfunction. Initially, loss of RB had no gross effect on Sertoli cell function as the mice were fertile with normal testis weights at 6 weeks of age, but by 10-14 weeks of age, mutant mice demonstrated severe Sertoli cell dysfunction and infertility. Although double knockout (dKO) of Rb and Inha did not result in exacerbation of the tumorigenic phenotype of Inha-null mice, we found that the dKO mice demonstrate an acceleration of Sertoli cell dysfunction compared to Rb cKO mice. Specifically, in contrast to Rb cKO mice, Inha/Rb dKO mice showed signs of Sertoli cell dysfunction as early as 4 weeks of age. These results demonstrate that RB is not essential for Sertoli cell tumorigenesis in Inha KO mice but that loss of Inha accelerates the infertility phenotype of Rb cKO mice."
