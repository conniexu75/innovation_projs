https://openalex.org/W1984643518,"Most agriculturally important traits are regulated by genes known as quantitative trait loci (QTLs) derived from natural allelic variations. We here show that a QTL that increases grain productivity in rice, Gn1a , is a gene for cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (OsCKX2), an enzyme that degrades the phytohormone cytokinin. Reduced expression of OsCKX2 causes cytokinin accumulation in inflorescence meristems and increases the number of reproductive organs, resulting in enhanced grain yield. QTL pyramiding to combine loci for grain number and plant height in the same genetic background generated lines exhibiting both beneficial traits. These results provide a strategy for tailormade crop improvement."

AMPK activity is absolutely dependent upon phosphorylation of AMPKαThr-172 in its activation loop by one or more AMPK kinases (AMPKKs). The tumor suppressor kinase, LKB1, is a major AMPKK present in a variety of tissues and cells, but several lines of evidence point to the existence of other AMPKKs. We have employed three cell lines deficient in LKB1 to study AMPK regulation and phosphorylation, HeLa, A549, and murine embryo fibroblasts derived from LKB-/- mice. In HeLa and A549 cells, mannitol, 2-deoxyglucose, and ionomycin, but not 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR), treatment activates AMPK by αThr-172 phosphorylation.

AMPKK activity in HeLa cell lysates measured in vitro is totally inhibited by STO-609 with an IC50 comparable with that of the known CaMKK isoforms, CaMKKα and CaMKKβ. Furthermore, 2-deoxyglucose- and ionomycin-stimulated AMPK activity, αThr-172 phosphorylation, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation are substantially reduced in HeLa cells transfected with small interfering RNAs specific for CaMKKα and CaMKKβ. Lastly, the activation of AMPK in response to ionomycin and 2-deoxyglucose is not impaired in LKB1-/- murine embryo fibroblasts. These data indicate that the CaMKKs function in intact cells as AMPKKs, predicting wider roles for these kinases in regulating AMPK activity in vivo.

Scott J.W. Pan D.A. Hudson E.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). AMPK is a serine/threonine protein kinase and a member of the Snf1/AMPK protein kinase family (1Hardie D.G. Scott J.W. Pan D.A. Hudson E.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). It is an αβγ heterotrimeric protein, consisting of an α catalytic subunit, a β subunit important both for enzyme activity and for targeting, and a γ regulatory subunit, which binds the allosteric activator, AMP. The activity of AMPK absolutely requires phosphorylation of the α subunit on Thr-172 in its activation loop by one or more upstream kinases (AMPKK) (1Hardie D.G. Scott J.W. Pan D.A. Hudson E.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar).The major breakthrough in identifying AMPK upstream kinases came from the study of the regulation of the AMPK ortholog, Snf1, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which Pak1 was shown to act as a Snf1p kinase kinase (2Nath N. McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3909-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that three closely related kinases, Pak1p, Tos3p, and Elm1p, needed to be deleted to generate the Snf1- phenotype (3Hong S.P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M.

Sequence comparison revealed that the human LKB1 tumor suppressor kinase was the most closely related mammalian kinase. LKB1 was subsequently identified by several groups as being an important upstream kinase active on AMPK (5Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L. Makela T.P. Alessi D.R. Hardie D.G. J.

Murine fibroblasts obtained from LKB1-/- embryos by two different groups still demonstrate residual AMPKT172α phosphorylation and AMPK activity, albeit not as responsive to the usual activators of AMPK, such as the nucleoside AICAR (5Hawley S.A.

Partially purified Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) from pig brain has been shown to be active in vitro on AMPK, but it was concluded that the kinetics of phosphorylation by CaMKK were weaker than those for a partially purified AMPKK and that CaMKKs were unlikely to function as AMPKKs in intact cells and tissues (10Hawley S.A.

Although this view has been widely accepted (28Carling D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 18-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar), Nath et al. (2Nath N. McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3909-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) suggested that CaMKKβ may be an AMPKK based on homology with yeast PAK1. Recently, CaMKKα has been shown directly to function as a Snf1-activating kinase in yeast cells lacking the three Snf-activating kinases, Pak1, Tos3, and Elm1 (29Hong S.-P. Momcilovic M. Carlson M.

In the present study, we have investigated the possibility that one or both CaMKKs might serve as AMPKKs to regulate AMPK in cell lines lacking expression of LKB1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Incubations—Panc-1, AsPC-1, and COS cells were purchased from ATCC. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) from LKB1+/+ and LKB1-/- mice and HeLa cells were kindly provided by Reuben Shaw (Harvard University). These cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. A549 cells (ATCC) were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were incubated in 6-well plates after various additions (see the figure legends) prior to extraction for immunoblotting and analysis of AMPK activity.Preparation of Cell Extracts—Cell extracts were prepared by three different methods. For analysis of AMPK activity, digitonin lysis followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation was employed, as in Ref. 11Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2864-2867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. For immunoblotting of total cellular protein, cells were lysed either in a Triton X-100-containing buffer, as in Ref. 12Hamilton S.R. O'Donnell Jr., J.B. Hammet A. Stapleton D. Habinowski S.A. Means A.R. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 892-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, or in an SDS-containing buffer. For the latter, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (2×) and lysed directly on the plate with boiling SDS buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). These extracts were then sheared with a 25-gauge needle and boiled for 5 min. Protein concentration in all extracts was determined with a BCA assay (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's protocol.Enzyme Activities and Immunoblotting—AMPK activity against the SAMS peptide was determined at a saturating concentration of AMP, as in Ref. 11Witters L.A.

AMPKK activity in Triton X-100 cell lysates was determined by phosphorylation of a recombinant AMPKα protein, as in Ref. 12Hamilton S.R. O'Donnell Jr., J.B. Hammet A. Stapleton D. Habinowski S.A.

These included anti-AMPK total α (reactive against α and α2), anti-AMPKαT172p, anti-ACCS79p, streptavidin-HRP (13Hamilton S.R. Stapleton D. O'Donnell Jr., J.B. Kung J.T. Dalal S.R. Kemp B.E.

(Santa Cruz, CA). HeLa cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were transfected with a non-targeting control siRNA pool (200 nm), CaMKKβ siRNA pool (100 nm), or CaMKKα siRNA (200 nm). Preliminary studies established that the latter two were employed at their maximally effective concentrations (data not shown). Transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. At 48 h after transfection, cells were either harvested or treated with AMPK activators and then harvested.Preparation of LKB1/STRAD/Mo25 Complex—COS cells were triply transfected with cDNAs expressing glutathione S-transferase-tagged LKB1 and FLAG-tagged STRAD and Mo25 (generous gifts from Reuben Shaw (Harvard University) and Dario Alessi (University of Dundee)) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, as described above, 48 h after transfection. Cleared supernatants were aliquoted into microcentrifuge tubes (1 ml/tube) and incubated with 100 μl of 50% glutathione bead slurry (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. Lysates were spun down briefly (20 s, 14,000 rpm) to gently pellet beads. The supernatant was carefully removed, and beads were washed once with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and then subsequently washed two times with 4× assay buffer (0.4 m HEPES, 0.6 m NaCl). Beads were then resuspended in 4× assay buffer containing 20 mm glutathione (Sigma) to elute the enzyme complex. Following a 20-min incubation on ice, samples are spun down for 1–2 min at 14,000 rpm to firmly pellet beads, and the supernatant, containing the purified LKB1/STRAD/Mo25 complex, was removed and used immediately in the in vitro kinase kinase assays.Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis of experimental data were performed by a factorial ANOVA with multiple comparisons, using the least significant difference by the STATISTICA software package.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn an effort to identify AMPKKs distinct from LKB1, two human cell lines that are deficient in LKB1 were selected for study, the cervical carcinoma-derived HeLa and the lung adenocarcinoma-derived A549 lines. LKB1 is not detectable in these two lines nor in LKB1-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts by immunoblotting (Fig. 1). We did detect expression of LKB1 in other human cancer lines including PANC-1 and AsPC-1, the latter previously thought to be LKB1-negative (14Qanungo S. Haldar S. Basu A. Neoplasia. 2003; 5: 367-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).HeLa and A549 cells were stimulated with a variety of agents known to activate AMPK by increasing phosphorylation of AMPKαT172 and with ionomycin, the latter to increase intracellular Ca2+. Mannitol, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), and ionomycin, but not AICAR, markedly stimulate both AMPK activity (Fig. 2A) and αT172 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B, top panel) in HeLa cells. In A549 cells, mannitol and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), but not AICAR (data not shown), also stimulated AMPK activity and phosphorylation (Supplemental Fig. 1). The inability of AICAR to stimulate AMPK in HeLa cells and in LKB1-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts has been observed previously (5Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L. Makela T.P.

HeLa cells were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with either STO-609 (1 μg/ml) or an equivalent volume of its diluent, Me2SO (1:2000), for 6 h followed by treatment with one of the following reagents: AICAR (2 mm, 2 h), mannitol (0.6 m, 15 min), 2-DG (50 mm, 15 min), and ionomycin (Iono) (1 μm, 5 min). In these and the other cell experiments in this study, cells were plated in 6-well plates. Cells extracts were then prepared by the digitonin lysis method, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each extract (n) represents a pooling of three wells incubated under identical conditions. A, extracts (n = 3 at each condition) were assayed for AMPK activity, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open bars represent treatment with Me2SO, and shaded bars represent treatment with STO-609. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. as pmol of 32P incorporation into the SAMS peptide per minute per mg of protein. As determined by ANOVA analysis, the stimulations by mannitol, 2-DG, and ionomycin and the inhibition of these effects by STO-609 are significant at p < 0.0001; there is no statistically significant difference between control (CON) and AICAR samples either in the presence or in the absence of STO-609. For the entire data set, F(4,20) = 26.4, p < 0.001 for the effects of STO-609. B, representative immunoblots of duplicate extracts from each incubation condition are shown developed with antibodies directed against either AMPKαT172p (top and middle) or total AMPKα (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The above experiments indicate the presence of AMPKK(s) in HeLa and A549 cells distinct from LKB1.

A CaMKK preparation from pig brain (isolated prior to the recognition that there were two isoforms of the enzyme) has previously been shown to phosphorylate and activate AMPK in vitro; this phosphorylation is enhanced by the binding of AMP to the AMPK heterotrimer (10Hawley S.A.

Since both CaMKKα and CaMKKβ are expressed in HeLa cells (but not in murine embryonic fibroblasts), 2R. L. Hurley, K. A. Anderson, J. M. Franzone, B. E. Kemp, A. R. Means, and L. A.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).To test the hypothesis that one or both CaMKKs in HeLa cells functions as an AMPKK, HeLa cells were incubated under basal conditions or were stimulated with mannitol, 2-DG, or ionomycin in the presence of the CaMKK inhibitor, STO-609 (22Tokumitsu H.

Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10908-10913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). At a concentration of 1 μg/ml, STO-609 significantly inhibits AMPK activation and αT172 phosphorylation in response to all three agents in HeLa cells (Fig. 2). The degree of inhibition of STO-609 was greatest in the ionomycin-stimulated cells (Fig. 2A). Since STO-609 did not, however, totally block the activation and phosphorylation of AMPK in response to mannitol and 2-DG, this might suggest that these cells possess residual LKB1 (although undetectable by immunoblot) or perhaps another AMPKK. STO-609 also inhibited AMPK activation in response to mannitol and 2-DG in A549 cells (Supplemental Fig. 1). Dose-dependent activation by 2-DG of AMPK αT172 phosphorylation and phosphorylation of a downstream target of activated AMPK, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), were significantly inhibited by STO-609 in HeLa cells at 2-DG concentrations of ≤10 mm (Fig. 3). The IC50 for STO-609 inhibition of 2-DG-stimulated αT172 phosphorylation in HeLa cells was ∼0.7 μg/ml (data not shown). In other experiments (data not shown), we have found that STO-609 can inhibit the in vitro activity of purified AMPK against the SAMS peptide, although the IC50 is 20-fold higher than that for the CaMKKs. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that some fraction of the STO-609 inhibition of ACC phosphorylation in intact cells is due to the direct inhibition of AMPK, although the concentrations we employed in these intact cells studies was 1 μg/ml. However, αT172 is not an AMPK auto-phosphorylation site, so any effects of STO-609 cannot be accounted for by inhibition of auto-regulation.Fig. 3STO-609 inhibits AMPK and ACC phosphorylation in response to 2-deoxyglucose in HeLa cells. HeLa cells, preincubated with either STO-609 (1 μg/ml) or an equivalent volume of Me2SO for 6 h, were treated with increasing concentrations of 2-DG (5, 10, 25, 50 mm) for 15 min. Cell extracts were prepared by the digitonin lysis method, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Duplicate samples, matched for protein, from each incubation condition were pooled and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using antibodies AMPKαT172p, total AMPKα (Total α), or ACCS79p.

In HeLa cells, the marked increase in AMPK activity and αT172 phosphorylation in response to ionomycin (Fig. 2) might thus be due to a Ca2+ stimulation of either of the CaMKKs. In support of this hypothesis, STO-609 completely blocks the ability of ionomycin to elicit these changes in AMPK (Fig. 2).AMPKK activity, measured in HeLa cell lysates against a recombinant AMPKα in vitro, was completely inhibited by STO-609 (Fig. 4A). The IC50 for this in vitro STO-609 inhibition was ∼0.02 μg/ml (data not shown). This IC50 value is comparable with that reported for the inhibition of recombinant CaMKKα (0.12 μg/ml) and CaMKKβ (0.04 μg/ml) phosphorylation of a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase I (CaMKI) fusion protein in vitro (22Tokumitsu H.

The IC5o of STO-609 against several other protein kinases (CaM kinases I, II, and IV, myosin light chain kinase, protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and p42 MAP kinase) exceeds 10 μg/ml, establishing (in part) its specificity and potency as a CaMKK inhibitor (22Tokumitsu H. Inuzuka H. Ishikawa Y. Ikeda M. Saji I. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15813-15818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Additionally we have demonstrated that at these concentrations, STO-609 does not inhibit the activity of a LKB1/STRAD/Mo25 heterotrimer against the recombinant AMPKα in vitro (Fig. 4B), suggesting the potential utility of this inhibitor in establishing the relative roles of the CaMKKs and LKB1 as AMPKKs in various tissues or cell preparations. STO-609, whereas specific for the CaMKKs, however cannot clearly distinguish between the two CaMKK isoforms, CaMKKα and CaMKKb.Fig. 4STO-609 inhibition of in vitro AMPKK activity.

Wind HFCVs should benefit climate most. An all-HFCV fleet would hardly affect tropospheric water vapor concentrations.

Using presentations of 15 species of live predators, we show that acoustic features of the mobbing calls of black-capped chickadees ( Poecile atricapilla ) vary with the size of the predator. Companion playback experiments revealed that chickadees detect this information and that the intensity of mobbing behavior is related to the size and threat of the potential predator. This study demonstrates an unsuspected level of complexity and sophistication in avian alarm calls."

Besides its use as a biological tool in cell cycle, neuronal functions, and apoptosis studies, it is currently evaluated as a potential drug to treat cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, viral infections, and glomerulonephritis. We have investigated the selectivity of (R)-roscovitine using three different methods: 1) testing on a wide panel of purified kinases that, along with previously published data, now reaches 151 kinases; 2) identifying roscovitine-binding proteins from various tissue and cell types following their affinity chromatography purification on immobilized roscovitine; 3) investigating the effects of roscovitine on cells deprived of one of its targets, CDK2. Altogether, the results show that (R)-roscovitine is rather selective for CDKs, in fact most kinases are not affected. However, it binds an unexpected, non-protein kinase target, pyridoxal kinase, the enzyme responsible for phosphorylation and activation of vitamin B6. These results could help in interpreting the cellular actions of (R)-roscovitine but also in guiding the synthesis of more selective roscovitine analogs."

Here, a synthetic mu-eta2:eta2-peroxodicopper(II) complex, with an absorption spectrum similar to that of the enzymatic active oxidant, is reported to rapidly hydroxylate phenolates at -80 degrees C. Upon phenolate addition at extreme temperature in solution (-120 degrees C), a reactive intermediate consistent with a bis-mu-oxodicopper(III)-phenolate complex, with the O-O bond fully cleaved, is observed experimentally. The subsequent hydroxylation step has the hallmarks of an electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism, similar to tyrosinase. Overall, the evidence for sequential O-O bond cleavage and C-O bond formation in this synthetic complex suggests an alternative intimate mechanism to the concerted or late stage O-O bond scission generally accepted for the phenol hydroxylation reaction performed by tyrosinase."

New interneurons are continually added to the OB from the subventricular zone (SVZ) via the rostral migratory stream (RMS). Here we show that secreted prokineticin 2 (PK2) functions as a chemoattractant for SVZ-derived neuronal progenitors. Within the OB, PK2 may also act as a detachment signal for chain-migrating progenitors arriving from the RMS. PK2 deficiency in mice leads to a marked reduction in OB size, loss of normal OB architecture, and the accumulation of neuronal progenitors in the RMS.

GDF11 does not affect proliferation of progenitors—a major mode of GDF11 action in other tissues—but instead controls duration of expression of Math5 , a gene that confers competence for RGC genesis, in progenitor cells.

https://openalex.org/W2060372695,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily of ligands, which regulate many mammalian physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. BMPs exert their effects through type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors and the Smad intracellular signaling pathway. Recently, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein DRAGON was identified as a co-receptor for BMP signaling.

We show that RGMa enhances BMP, but not TGF-β, signals in a ligand-dependent manner in cell culture.

Massague J. Cell 2003. 2003; 113: 685-700Google Scholar). These cytokines play a key role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, and patterning during development and in adult tissues (2Hogan B.L.

Biol. 2002; 250: 231-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like other members of the TGF-β superfamily, BMPs exert their effects through a common signal transduction pathway (1Shi Y. Massague J. Cell 2003. 2003; 113: 685-700Google Scholar). Signaling is initiated when ligand binds to combinations of two type I and two type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. Thus far, three type I receptors (BMPRIA/ALK3, BMPRIB/ALK6, and ALK2) and three type II receptors (BMP type II receptor (BMPRII), activin type IIA receptor (ActRIIA), and activin type IIB receptor (ActRIIB)) have been identified for BMP subfamily ligands. Ligand binding activates the receptor complex by inducing phosphorylation of the type I receptor by the type II receptor. Phosphorylated type I receptors then phosphorylate receptor-activated Smad1, 5, and 8 (Smad1/5/8). Phosphorylated Smad1, 5, and 8 (p-Smad1/5/8) then form heteromeric complexes with the common mediator Smad (Co-Smad), Smad4, and the activated Smad complexes move to the nucleus, where they act as transcriptional regulators to modulate gene expression. One important target of BMP signals includes the inhibitor of differentiation (Id) gene family, which serve as regulators of growth and differentiation in a variety of tissues (5Hollnagel A.

Using a reporter assay, we show that transfection of RGMa cDNA into cells enhances BMP, but not TGF-β, signals in a ligand-dependent fashion. Binding and cross-linking studies in a cell-free system demonstrate that soluble RGMa.Fc fusion protein interacts with the BMP type I receptor ALK6 and binds directly to 125I-BMP-2 and 125I-BMP-4, but not other members of the TGF-β superfamily. Co-transfection of RGMa cDNA with dominant negative BMP type I receptors or with dominant negative Smad1 inhibits RGMa-mediated BMP signaling, suggesting that RGMa generates BMP signals via the classical BMP pathway. Transfection of RGMa cDNA into cells induces phosphorylation of endogenous Smad1/5/8 and up-regulates endogenous Id1. Finally, immunofluorescence microscopy of adult rat spinal cord sections, reveals that RGMa is expressed in vivo in neurons, which also show nuclear accumulation of p-Smad1/5/8. Taken together, these data suggest that RGMa functions as a BMP co-receptor. cDNA Subcloning—cDNA encoding murine RGMa was subcloned into the expression vector pCDNA4/HisB (Promega). cDNA encoding the extracellular domain of murine RGMa was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pIgplus (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) into the restriction sites BamHI and HindIII in-frame with the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin (IgG) to generate soluble RGMa.Fc fusion protein. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293 cells and LLC-PK1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-1573 and CL-101, respectively) and cultured in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium (DMEM; Cellgro Mediatech, Herndon, VA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA). All plasmid transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stably transfected cells were selected and cultured in 2 mg/ml G418 (Cellgro Mediatech). Luciferase Assay—LLC-PK1 cells were transiently transfected with a TGF-β responsive firefly luciferase reporter, (CAGA)12MLP-Luc (CAGA-Luc, Ref. 25Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were serum-starved in DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS for 6 h and treated with varying amounts of TGF-β1, BMP-2, BMP-4, or BMP-7 ligands (R & D Systems) for 16 h, in the absence or presence of noggin (R & D Systems) or anti-BMP-2/4 antibody (R & D Systems). Cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined with the Dual Reporter Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate wells. Relative luciferase units (RLU) were calculated as the ratio of firefly (reporter) and Renilla (transfection control) luciferase values. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—LLC-PK1 cells were grown to confluence on 6-cm tissue culture plates. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) including DNase digestion with the RNase-Free DNase set (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transcripts of BMP-2 were amplified using the forward primer 5′-CGTGACCAGACTTTTGGACAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGCATGATTAGTGGAGTTCAG-3′. Transcripts of BMP-4 were amplified using the forward primer 5′-AGCAGCCAAACTATGGGCTA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGGTTGAGTTGAGGTGGTCA-3′. Purification and Characterization of RGMa.Fc—HEK 293 cells stably expressing RGMa.Fc were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS using 175-cm2 multifloor flasks (Denville Scientific, Southplainfield, NJ). RGMa.Fc was purified from the media of stably transfected cells via one-step Protein A affinity chromatography using Hi-Trap rProtein A FF columns (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (26del Re E.

Purified protein was eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 3.2 and neutralized with 0.3 m Tris-HCl, pH 9 as previously described (26del Re E. Babitt J.L. Pirani A. Schneyer A.L. Lin H.Y. J. Biol.

Purified human RGMa.Fc was subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE using pre-cast NuPAGE Novex 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen), and gels were stained with Bio-safe Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad) to determine the purity of RGMa.Fc and quantify protein concentration. For Western blot analysis, gels were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride filter membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline, 0.2% Tween 20) containing 6% milk powder for 1 h and washed three times with TBS-T for 10 min. Membranes were then probed with an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse RGMa antibody (α-RGMa) raised against the peptide RMDEEVVNAVEDRDSQGLYLC (amino acids 296-316 in the C terminus of mouse RGMa upstream of its hydrophobic tail) 2GenBank™ accession number NM_177740. (1:2,000) at 4 °C overnight, or with anti-Fc antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) (1:2000) at room temperature for 1 h in blocking solution. Membranes were washed with TBS-T and incubated with donkey anti-rabbit or anti-goat horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (1:10,000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody binding was detected with chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) and exposed to BioMax XAR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY). Ligand Iodination—2 μg of carrier-free human BMP-2 and BMP-4 ligand (R & D Systems) per reaction was iodinated with [125I] by the modified chloramine-T method as previously described (27Frolik C.A. Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10995-11000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding Assay—25 ng of purified RGMa.Fc in 1× Tris-buffered saline/casein-blocking buffer (BioFX, Owings Mills, MD) or buffer alone was incubated with 125I-BMP-2 or 125I-BMP-4 in a total volume of 200 μl overnight at 4 °C, either alone or in the presence of 80 ng of cold BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-7, or TGF-β1 for competition assays. For mixing studies, buffer alone, 10 ng of purified RGMa.Fc alone, 10 ng of ALK6.Fc alone (R & D Systems), or 10 ng each of RGMa.Fc and ALK6.Fc together were incubated in 1× Tris-buffered saline/casein-blocking buffer with 125I-BMP-2 in a total volume of 200 μl. The reaction mix was then incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C on protein A-coated plates (Pierce), plates were washed with wash solution (KPL, Gaithersberg, MD), and individual wells were counted with a standard γ counter. DSS Cross-linking in Solution—100 μl of 125I-BMP-2 or 125I-BMP-4 (400,000 cpm) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with an equal volume of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) alone, or containing 25 ng of RGMa.Fc or ALK5.Fc (R & D Systems), in the absence or presence of 80 ng of cold BMP-2 or BMP-4. This mixture was incubated in the absence or presence of 2.5 mm disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS, Sigma) in dimethyl sulfoxide for 2 h on ice, followed by quenching of DSS activity with 40 mm Tris (pH 7.5) for 15 min. The mixture was then centrifuged and the supernatant incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 2 h to precipitate hot BMP-2 or -4 bound to RGMa.Fc. Beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and protein eluted by non-reducing Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad). Eluted protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. For receptor cross-linking studies, 200 ng of RGMa.Fc, 200 ng of ALK6.Fc, and/or 100 ng of BMP-2 were incubated in 100 μl of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitors at 4 °C overnight. The mixtures were then cross-linked with DSS, incubated with protein A beads, and eluted with non-reducing Laemmli sample buffer as described above. The protein complex was then separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and analyzed by Western blot using RGMa antibody (1:2000) as described above for RGMa.Fc. Measurement of Smad1/5/8 Phosphorylation and Id1 Expression—LLC-PK1 cells plated to 70% confluence were transiently transfected with 5 μg of RGMa cDNA or empty vector. Twenty-four hours after transfection cells were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS in the absence or presence of 50 ng/ml BMP-2 for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were sonicated and lysed in 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics) for twenty minutes on ice. After centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was assayed for protein concentration by colorimetric assay (BCA kit, Pierce). 30 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were probed with α-RGMa (1:2000) as described above for RGMa.Fc. Membranes were stripped in 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.5, 0.5% Tween 20 for 1 h, and re-probed in succession with rabbit polyclonal anti-p-Smad1/5/8 antibody (α-p-Smad1/5/8, Cell Signaling, Beverly, Ma) (1:1000) at 4 °C overnight according to the manufacturer's instructions, rabbit polyclonal anti-Smad1 antibody (α-Smad1, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) (1:250) at 4 °C overnight, mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (α-β-actin, clone AC 15, Sigma) (1:5000) at room temperature for 1 h, and rabbit polyclonal anti-Id1 antibody (α-Id1, C 20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1:200) at 4 °C overnight followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and chemiluminescence detection after each as described above. Chemiluminescence was quantitated using IPLab Spectrum software (Scanalytics, Vienna, VA). Northern Blot—Adult rat total RNA was separated on a 1.5% formaldehyde agarose gel and blotted onto GeneScreen Plus membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as previously described (28Costigan M. Mannion R.J. Kendall G. Lewis S.E. Campagna J.A. Coggeshall R.E. Meridith-Middleton J. Tate S. Woolf C.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5891-5900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) Immunohistochemistry—Freshly dissected adult rat lumbar spinal cord was embedded in OCT (Sakura, Tokyo, Japan), frozen on dry ice, cut by cryostat in 16-μm sections, and stored at -80 °C. Spinal sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed three times in PBS, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Triton X in PBS). Fixed sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer with rabbit polyclonal α-RGMa (1:500) or rabbit polyclonal α-p-Smad1/5/8 (1:100), in combination with mouse monoclonal anti-neuron-specific nuclear protein antibody (α-NeuN, 1:1000) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) to visualize neuronal cell bodies. Sections were then washed three times in PBS and incubated with cyanin 3 (Cy3)-conjugated anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:200 each, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, sections were washed three times in PBS and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. RGMa Mediates BMP, but Not TGF-β, Signaling—Because RGM family member DRAGON functions as a BMP co-receptor in LLC-PK1 porcine kidney epithelial cells (14Samad T.A. Rebbapragada A. Bell E. Zhang Y.

LLC-PK1 cells were transfected with a BMP-responsive luciferase reporter (BRE-Luc, Ref. 6Korchynskyi O. ten Dijke P. J. Biol.

Transfected cells were then incubated with or without BMP-2 or TGF-β1 for 16 h followed by measurement of luciferase activity. In the absence of RGMa, stimulation with BMP-2 or TGF-β1 increased the relative luciferase activity for their respective reporters compared with unstimulated cells (Fig. 1, A and B, compare bars 2 to 1). Co-transfection with RGMa similarly increased BRE luciferase activity even in the absence of exogenous BMP ligand (Fig. 1A, bar 3). The RGMa-mediated BMP signaling was dose-dependent (Fig. 1C, white bars), reaching a peak at about 200 ng of cDNA per transfection. RGMa also augmented signaling produced by exogenous BMP-2 (Fig. 1C, black bars). In contrast, co-transfection with RGMa (up to 1 μg) did not increase the TGF-β responsive CAGA luciferase activity above baseline (Fig. 1B, bar 3). Similar results were seen in another cell line (HepG2 cells, data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that like DRAGON, RGMa mediates BMP, but not TGF-β, signaling. RGMa-mediated BMP Signaling Is Ligand-dependent—The ability of RGMa to generate BMP signals even in the absence of exogenous BMP ligand raises the question of whether RGMa acts in a ligand-independent manner, or whether it augments signaling by endogenous BMP ligands. To investigate this question, we examined whether RGMa-mediated signaling was inhibited by noggin, a soluble BMP inhibitor that binds and sequesters BMP ligands, barring access to membrane receptors (4Balemans W.

Here we show that mouse cryptochrome 2 (mCRY2) is phosphorylated at Ser-557 in the liver, a well characterized peripheral clock tissue. The Ser-557-phosphorylated form accumulates in the liver during the night in parallel with mCRY2 protein, and the phosphorylated form reaches its maximal level at late night, preceding the peak-time of the protein abundance by ∼4 h in both light-dark cycle and constant dark conditions. The Ser-557-phosphorylated form of mCRY2 is localized in the nucleus, whereas mCRY2 protein is located in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Importantly, phosphorylation of mCRY2 at Ser-557 allows subsequent phosphorylation at Ser-553 by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), resulting in efficient degradation of mCRY2 by a proteasome pathway. As assessed by phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9, which negatively regulates the kinase activity, GSK-3β exhibits a circadian rhythm in its activity with a peak from late night to early morning when Ser-557 of mCRY2 is highly phosphorylated. Altogether, the present study demonstrates an important role of sequential phosphorylation at Ser-557/Ser-553 for destabilization of mCRY2 and illustrates a model that the circadian regulation of mCRY2 phosphorylation contributes to rhythmic degradation of mCRY2 protein.

The physiology and behavior of living organisms from bacteria to humans show daily fluctuations, and those controlled by autonomous clocks are termed circadian rhythms (1Takahashi J.S. Annu. Rev.

These rhythms are synchronized with (entrained to) environmental time cues such as light, and the rhythms are sustained with a period of ∼24 h even in the absence of the time cues. In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the anterior hypothalamus serves as the central clock of the circadian timing system (3Rusak B. Zucker I. Physiol.

Cell. 2001; 105: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), and SGG phosphorylates TIM (25Martinek S. Inonog S. Manoukian A.S. Young M.W. Cell. 2001; 105: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), an essential clock component serving as a binding partner of PER (13Zeng H. Qian Z. Myers M.P. Rosbash M. Nature. 1996; 380: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mammalian GSK-3 has been related to circadian clockwork in mice (26Iwahana E. Akiyma M. Miyakawa K. Uchida A. Kasahara J. Fukunaga K. Hamada T. Shibata S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 19: 2281-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), but its target protein(s) yet remains to be elucidated. In every case no information is available about the in vivo phosphorylation site(s) in these clock proteins. We have recently found that mCRY2 is phosphorylated at Ser-265 and Ser-557 by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in vitro (27Sanada K. Harada Y. Sakai M. Todo T. Fukada Y. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Likewise, Ser-247 of mCRY1, which corresponds to Ser-265 of mCRY2, is phosphorylated by MAPK in vitro (27Sanada K. Harada Y. Sakai M. Todo T. Fukada Y. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas mCRY1 does not have the Ser or Thr residue which corresponds to Ser-557 of mCRY2. Ser-247/Ser-265 lie in the mCRY central region, which contains the FAD-binding site, and is highly conserved among photolyase/cryptochrome flavoprotein family. Ser-557 of mCRY2, in contrast, lies in the carboxyl-terminal tail, a region that is characterized by diverged structure among CRYs (28Cashmore A.R. Jarillo J.A. Wu Y.J. Liu D. Science. 1999; 284: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Functionally, phosphorylation of mCRYs at Ser-247/Ser-265 perturbs their activities to suppress CLOCK/BMAL1-mediated transactivation (27Sanada K. Harada Y. Sakai M. Todo T. Fukada Y. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but functional significance of Ser-557 phosphorylation was not identified. Interestingly, mCry1 knock-out and mCry2 knock-out mice display accelerated and delayed free-running periodicity, respectively (12van der Horst G.T.J. Muijtjens M. Kobayashi K. Takano R. Kanno S. Takao M. de Wit J. Verkerk A. Eker A.P.M. van Leenen D. Buijs R. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Yasui A. Nature. 1999; 398: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that mCRY1 and mCRY2 participate in the clockwork in different ways, and therefore, it is intriguing to elucidate the mechanism how each mCRY protein is regulated and how they contribute to the molecular oscillation. In the present study we demonstrate circadian fluctuation of in vivo phosphorylation of mCRY2 at Ser-557 peaking at late subjective night in the mouse liver. Interestingly, Ser-557 phosphorylation of mCRY2 allows subsequent phosphorylation by GSK-3β, leading to proteasome-dependent degradation of mCRY2. These results demonstrate an important role of Ser-557 phosphorylation as the primary step of clearance of mCRY2 and provide the first evidence for the molecular link between GSK-3β and the clock protein of vertebrates. Animals—The animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of University of Tokyo. Five-week-old male mice (C57BL/6) were housed individually at 23 ± 1 °C in cages with food and water available ad libitum, and they were entrained to 12-h light/12-h dark (LD) cycles. After the entrainment at least for 2 weeks, the animals were placed in constant dark (DD) condition. Plasmids—Mammalian expression vectors encoding Myc epitope-tagged mCRY proteins were generated as described (27Sanada K. Harada Y. Sakai M. Todo T. Fukada Y. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Ser-to-Ala mutations were introduced into mCRY2 using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mammalian expression vectors encoding Xenopus GSK-3β and its dominant-negative form (kind gifts of Dr. Yukiko Gotoh), human MAPK and its dominant-negative form (kind gifts of Dr. Masato Ogata), rat CKIϵ and its kinase-negative form (kind gifts of Dr. Katsuya Nagai), and Myc epitope-tagged mPER2 (a kind gift of Dr. Louis J. Ptacek) were used. Antibodies—To generate polyclonal antibody against the Ser-557-phosphorylated form of mCRY2, a synthetic phosphopeptide (CSGPA-(phospho-S)PKRKLE) corresponding to amino acids 553–563 of mCRY2 was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) using m-male-imidobenzoyl-N-hydoxysuccinimide ester (Sulfo-MBS; Pierce) according to a protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Two rabbits were injected subcutaneously with the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated phosphopeptides emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant (Difco). For the purification of the antibody, the phosphopeptide or its non-phosphorylated form was conjugated to EAH-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) using Sulfo-MBS. Sera obtained from the immunized rabbits were applied to the phosphopeptide-coupled column, and the antibodies bound to the column were eluted with 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.5) and neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). After being dialyzed against TBS, the eluted fraction was applied to the non-phosphopeptide-coupled column, and the flow-through fraction was collected (anti-pS557-mCRY2 antibody). In Vitro Phosphorylated mCRYs—Bacterially expressed GST-mCRYs and the phosphorylated (activated) form of Myc-MAPK were prepared as described (27Sanada K. Harada Y. Sakai M. Todo T. Fukada Y. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29Sanada K. Okano T. Fukada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 267-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For phosphorylation reactions, GST-mCRYs (1.8 μg) were incubated with 0.3 μg of phosphorylated Myc-MAPK in 40 μl of kinase buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm MgCl2,50 μm Na3VO4, 0.003% (w/v) Brij 35, 1 mm ATP (pH 7.8)) at 4 °C for 2 h. Immunoblotting—Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The blots were blocked by 1% (w/v) skim milk in TBS (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 37 °Cand then incubated at 4 °C overnight with a primary antibody in the blocking solution. The primary antibodies used were anti-pS557-mCRY2 antibody (1:200–1:2000), anti-CRY2 antibody (1:1000; kindly provided by Dr. Takeshi Todo), anti-Myc antibody (clone 9E10, 1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GST antibody (clone B-14, 1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GSK-3β antibody (1:2500; BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-phospho-Ser-9-GSK-3β antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling), anti-ATF2 antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-Raf-1 antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The primary antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:5000; Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc.) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:5000; Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories), and the positive signals were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). When reprobed, the blots were stripped according to the manufacturer's protocol. Preparation of Mouse Liver Lysate—Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and their eyes were enucleated. These manipulations during the dark period were performed in dim red light (>640 nm), and the subsequent procedures were performed under room light. The mouse livers were homogenized with 20 volumes of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 4 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 8.0, at 4 °C) followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 2400 × g, and the unsedimented materials were collected. For immunoprecipitation of mCRY2, the mouse liver lysate (200 μg of proteins) thus prepared was precleared by incubation with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated with anti-CRY2 antibody for 8 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The precipitated materials were washed 3 times with buffer B and mixed with SDS-PAGE sample solution followed by boiling for 8 min. Immunocytochemistry—Under deep ether anesthesia, DD-housed male mice (C57BL/6) were perfused with saline (20 ml) and subsequently with 20 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The livers were isolated from these animals, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 4 h at 4 °C, cryoprotected successively with 10, 20, and 30% sucrose in phosphate buffer, embedded in the OCT mounting medium (Sakura, Japan), and frozen by using liquid nitrogen. Then, 10-μm-thick sections were cut out from the embedded tissues, mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides, and air-dried. The sections on the glass slides were rinsed with TBS, incubated with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol, rinsed with TBS, pretreated with a blocking solution (3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.5% (v/v) goat normal serum, 0.01% (w/v) Triton X-100 in TBS (pH 7.4)) for 30 min at room temperature, and then incubated with anti-pS557-mCRY2 antibody (1:50) diluted in the blocking solution at 4 °C for 24 h. After rinsing with TBS, the sections were treated with a biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Vector Laboratories) for 24 h at 4 °C and then with avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories) in TBS for 30 min at room temperature followed by rinsing with TBS. The immunoreactive sites were developed by incubating with 0.4 mg/ml diaminobenzidine and 0.01% H2O2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) for 3 min at room temperature. Preparation of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extracts from Liver—Fractionation was performed as described by Gorski et al. (30Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The mouse liver was homogenized with 10 volumes of buffer C (10 mm HEPES-KOH, 15 mm KCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1 mm EDTA, 2.2 m sucrose, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 14 μg/ml aprotinin, and 14 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.6, at 4 °C) using a glass-glass homogenizer for 6 strokes. The homogenate was filtered through 2 layers of cheesecloth, and 4.5 ml of the filtrated homogenate was layered over a 7.5-ml cushion of buffer D (10 mm HEPES-KOH, 15 mm KCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1 mm EDTA, 2.0 m sucrose, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 14 μg/ml aprotinin, and 14 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.6, at 4 °C) and centrifuged for 50 min at 104,000 × g at 4 °C. Only a transparent portion was collected from the 4.5-ml upper layer (cytoplasmic extract), whereas the pelleted nuclei were resuspended with 600 μl of nuclear lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, 0.55 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 14 μg/ml aprotinin, and 14 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.6, at 4 °C) and gently shaken for 15 min at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged for 60 min at 190,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected (nuclear extract). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunoprecipitation—COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in wells of 6-well plates and were transiently transfected by using Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen) with a total of 1.0 μg of protein expression plasmids. The cells were then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 24–36 h, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized for 30 min on ice in 300 μl of buffer E (20 mm HEPES-KOH, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4; pH 7.5 at 4 °C). The cell extracts were then centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g. For immunoprecipitation, the supernatant (20 μg of proteins) was incubated with 1.0 μg of anti-Myc antibody (clone 9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 2 h followed by incubation with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed 4 times with buffer E. In Vitro Phosphorylation by GSK-3β—After immunoprecipitation of Myc-mCRYs from the COS7 lysates as described above, the beads were washed 4 times with kinase buffer F (20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm ATP (pH 7.5)), and the final suspension (50 μl) was incubated with 250 units of recombinant GSK-3β (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 30 °C. Phosphatase Treatment—Myc-mCRY expressed in the COS7 cells or endogenous mCRY2 in the mouse liver lysate was immunoprecipitated by anti-Myc or anti-CRY2 antibody, respectively, and the beads were washed 4 times with phosphatase buffer P (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.01% Brij 35 (pH 7.5)). The final suspension (50 μl) was incubated with 200 units of λ-protein phosphatase (Sigma) for 30 min at 30 °C. Degradation Assay—The mouse liver was homogenized with 20 volumes of buffer H (50 mm HEPES-KOH, 5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5), followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 2400 × g, and the unsedimented materials were collected. The lysate (50 μg of proteins) was mixed with or without 10 mm ATP and incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times in the presence or absence of MG132 (50 μm; Calbiochem) and/or GSK-3β (125 units or 500 units). After the incubation, the lysate was subjected to the immunoblot analysis with anti-CRY2 antibody. Rhythmic Phosphorylation of mCRY2 at Ser-557 in the Mouse Liver—To investigate in vivo phosphorylation of mCRY2 at Ser-557, we generated an antibody specific to the Ser-557-phosphorylated form of mCRY2. The specificity of the antibody (anti-pS557-mCRY2 antibody) was examined by immunoblotting of recombinant GST-mCRY2 and its Ser-265/Ser-557-phosphorylated form (P-GST-mCRY2), which was produced by incubation of GST-mCRY2 with activated MAPK in vitro (27Sanada K. Harada Y. Sakai M. Todo T. Fukada Y. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The anti-pS557-mCRY2 antibody detected the Ser-265/Ser-557-phosphorylated form of GST-mCRY2, and no detectable cross-reaction was observed against the unphosphorylated GST-mCRY2 nor Ser-247-phosphorylated GST-mCRY1 (Fig. 1A, upper panel). The latter observation eliminated any cross-reaction of this antibody to the central region of mCRY2 near phosphorylated Ser-265 because of the fully conserved primary structure of this region between mCRY1 and mCRY2. When Myc-mCRY2 was expressed in COS7 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc-antibody from the unstimulated cells, the anti-pS557-mCRY2 antibody recognized a band corresponding to Myc-mCRY2 (Fig. 1B, lane 1). The immuno-reaction to the band was abolished by treatment of the immunoprecipitate with λ-protein phosphatase (Fig. 1B, lane 2), whereas in the presence of a phosphatase inhibitor the same treatment had no effect on the immunoreactivity of the band (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Finally, we confirmed no detectable immuno-reaction to the Ser-to-Ala mutant at Ser-557 position of Myc-mCRY2 (Myc-mCRY2 S557A-mutant), verifying the sequence specificity of the immuno-reaction (Fig. 1B). These results together demonstrate high specificity of the antibody to the Ser-557-phosphorylated form of mCRY2 and concomitantly indicate the presence of intrinsic protein kinase capable of phosphorylating Ser-557 of Myc-mCRY2 expressed in unstimulated COS7 cells (Fig. 1B). By using the phospho-specific antibody, we examined the phosphorylation state of mCRY2 Ser-557 in the mouse liver, in which many clock proteins except mCRYs showed obvious shifts in electrophoretic mobility due to phosphorylation (22Lee C. Etchegaray J.-P. Cagampang F.R.A. Loudon A.S.I. Reppert S.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). The liver lysate was prepared at ZT 22 from mice entrained to LD cycles and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-CRY2 antibody followed by immunoblotting. Anti-pS557-mCRY2 antibody recognized a 68-kDa band corresponding to mCRY2 protein (Fig. 1C, lane 1), and the immuno-positive band became invisible after treatment of the immunoprecipitate with phosphatase (Fig. 1C, lane 2), indicating that mCRY2 is phosphorylated at Ser-557 in vivo. We then pursued any temporal change in phosphorylation of mCRY2 Ser-557 in the liver throughout the day. In LD cycles, the protein level of mCRY2 showed a robust daily variation with a peak at ZT 2 and a trough at ZT 14 (Fig. 1D, open circles) as reported (22Lee C. Etchegaray J.-P. Cagampang F.R.A. Loudon A.S.I. Reppert S.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). With a similar degree of amplitude, the Ser-557-phosphorylated form of mCRY2 exhibited a daily change with a peak at ZT 22 (Fig. 1D, closed circles), which preceded the zenith of the protein level by ∼4 h (Fig. 1D). We further examined circadian fluctuation of mCRY2 Ser-557 phosphorylation in DD conditions and then the levels of the Ser-557-phosphorylated form (Fig. 1E, closed circles) and mCRY2 protein (Fig. 1E, open circles) showed robust circadian rhythms with profiles of a 4-h difference in their peak times, as observed in LD cycles. MAPK in the mouse liver also showed robust daily variation in phosphorylation with a peak at ZT 10 and a nadir at the early night without any significant change in the protein level (Supplemental Fig. S1A). This temporal profile of MAPK phosphorylation was almost antiphase to that of the Ser-557 phosphorylation of mCRY2, raising the possibility that the other kinase(s) is responsible for the phosphorylation of mCRY2 at Ser-557 in vivo. In fact, MAPK was unlikely to contribute to the Ser-557 phosphorylation in COS7 cells because neither activation nor inhibition of the MAPK pathway altered the phosphorylation level of mCRY2 Ser-557 relative to the protein level (Supplemental Fig. S1, C and D). Nuclear Localization of Ser-557-phosphorylated mCRY2—To determine the subcellular localization of circadian-phosphorylated mCRY2 in the mouse liver, thin sections were prepared from the mice maintained in constant darkness at various time points and subjected to immunostaining with anti-pS557-mCRY2 antibody (Fig. 2, A–F) and nuclei staining by hematoxylin (Fig. 2G). At CT 2 and CT 20, the majority of the cell nuclei showed strong immunoreactivity to anti-pS557-mCRY2 antibody, whereas very weak signals were observed in the cell nuclei at CT 8 and CT 14 (Fig. 2, A–D), and this profile of the temporal variation was consistent with that observed in the immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1E). These positive signals detected in the nuclei of the hepatocytes (Fig. 2D) became undetectable when the antibody was preabsorbed with the phosphopeptide that was used as the antigen (Fig. 2E), whereas preincubation with the control (non-phosphorylated) peptide had no effect on the immunoreactivity in the nuclei (Fig. 2F). These observations verified that the positive signals in the nuclei indeed represent the presence of the Ser-557-phosphorylated form of mCRY2. To further confirm the nuclear localization of Ser-557-phosphorylated mCRY2, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared from the mouse liver dissected at CT 18. The immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2H) demonstrated that mCRY2 was present in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (top panel)as reported previously (22Lee C. Etchegaray J.-P. Cagampang F.R.A. Loudon A.S.I. Reppert S.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). In contrast, a significant amount of Ser-557-phosphorylated mCRY2 was detected in the nuclear fraction (second panel). Taken together, it is"

Deletion of the protein kinase gene UL97 from the viral genome showed that the activity of pUL97 plays an important role for viral capsid egress. Here, we report that p32, a novel cellular interactor of the viral kinase pUL97, promotes the accumulation of pUL97 at the nuclear membrane by recruiting the p32-pUL97 complex to the lamin B receptor. Transfection of active pUL97, but not a catalytically inactive mutant, induced a redistribution of lamina components as demonstrated for recombinant lamin B receptor-green fluorescent protein and endogenous lamins A and C. Consistent with this, p32 itself and lamins were phosphorylated by pUL97. Importantly, overexpression of p32 in human cytomegalovirus-infected cells resulted in increased efficiency of viral replication and release of viral particles. Thus, it is highly suggestive that the cellular protein p32 recruits pUL97 to induce a dissolution of the nuclear lamina thereby facilitating the nuclear export of viral capsids.

The transport of macromolecules in eukaryotic cells is subject to a strict compartmentalization into nucleus and cytoplasm. Exchange reactions between the two compartments are mediated through the nuclear pore complex, and thus the integrity of the nuclear envelope, composed of membrane and lamina constituents, is crucial for intracellular transport pathways. The nuclear lamina, underlining the inner nuclear membrane, contains a variable number of lamin isoforms (which are members of the intermediate filament family of cytoskeletal proteins) and forms a rigid, proteinaceous meshwork. During infection with herpesviruses, the nuclear lamina represents a barrier to the nucleocytoplasmic transport of viral capsids (1Scott E.S. O'Hare P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8818-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because of the large size of herpesviral capsids (∼120 nm), which does not allow their direct cytoplasmic release through nuclear pores, the structural destabilization of the nuclear lamina is an important prerequisite of virus budding. Lamina destabilization requires site-specific phosphorylation of lamins and lamin-binding membrane proteins. Phosphorylation leads to lamin depolymerization and may also permit their release from lamin-binding membrane proteins, including the lamin B receptor (LBR) 2The abbreviations used are: LBR, lamin B receptor; CoIP, coimmunoprecipitation; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; dpi, days postinfection; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; H2B, histone 2B; HA, hemagglutinin; HCMV, human cytomegalovirus; HFF, human foreskin fibroblast; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; HSV-1, herpes simplex virus type 1; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MCP, major capsid protein; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate.

The most frequently applied antiviral therapy, i.e. intravenous or oral administration of the nucleoside analog ganciclovir, is based on the specific ganciclovir-phosphorylating activity of the UL97-encoded viral kinase (pUL97) (8Coen D.M. Schaffer P.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Disc. 2003; 2: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 9Curran M. Noble S. Drugs. 2001; 61: 1145-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Interestingly, pUL97 does not phosphorylate naturally occurring nucleosides but is a protein kinase with specificity for serine/threonine residues (10Michel D. Pavic I. Zimmermann A. Haupt E. Wunderlich K. Heuschmid M. Mertens T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6340-6346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although having been studied intensively for more than a decade, the role of pUL97 within the HCMV replication cycle is still not known in detail. The functional importance of pUL97 was illustrated by experimental deletion of the UL97 coding region from the viral genome: although replication-competent UL97-deleted HCMV could be generated, replication of this virus is restricted to very low titers, indicating that pUL97 kinase activity is required for high efficiency of viral replication (11Prichard M.N. Gao N. Jairath S. Mulamba G. Krosky P. Coen D.M. Parker B.O. Pari G.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5663-5670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is also supported by the recent development of pUL97-specific protein kinase inhibitors with strong anti-cytomegaloviral effects, demonstrating that the kinase activity of pUL97 constitutes a novel attractive target for antiviral therapy (12Herget T. Freitag M. Morbitzer M. Stamminger T. Marschall M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4154-4162Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 13Marschall M. Freitag M. Suchy P. Romaker D. Kupfer R. Hanke M. Stamminger T. Virology. 2003; 311: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Several studies on UL97-deleted virus mutants revealed that their low level replication is the result of defects in DNA synthesis and, even more pronounced, in nuclear export of viral capsids (14Wolf D.G. Courcelle C.T. Prichard M.N. Mocarski E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1895-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 15Krosky P. Baek M.C. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar).To gain insight into the key role of pUL97 in nuclear capsid export, its interaction with cellular proteins was the focus of interest. Consequently, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using a human cDNA library and identified a novel cellular interactor of pUL97. Interestingly, this interactor, p32, is associated with a number of proteins, among them a component of the nuclear lamina, the LBR. Our data strongly suggest that p32 recruits the pUL97 kinase activity to this cellular compartment. Moreover, we could demonstrate a pUL97-mediated remodeling of the subnuclear structure of the lamina and a specific phosphorylation of lamins. This newly identified activity of pUL97 suggests a specific mechanism through which lamin destabilization and viral capsid export is promoted.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Viruses—Primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were cultivated in minimum Eagle's medium; 293, HeLa, and U373 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. HCMVs AD169 and AD169-GFP were propagated in HFFs, and virus replication was quantified by plaque assay or automated fluorometry (16Marschall M. Freitag M. Weiler S. Sorg G. Stamminger T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1588-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Transfection, Selection of Transfected Cells, and Generation of Cell Clones—Transient Lipofectamine Plus transfection (Invitrogen) of 293 and HeLa cells was performed at a cell confluence of 75%. HFFs were transfected by electroporation (Human Dermal Fibroblast Nucleofector™ Kit; Amaxa) and used for separation of positively transfected cells by magnetobeads (VarioMACS; Miltenyi Biotec). The generation of stably transfected U373 cell clones was performed by the Flp-in recombination system according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Invitrogen).Construction of Expression Plasmids—Expression plasmids were generated with vectors pcDNA3.1, pcDNA5/FRT (Invitrogen); pMACS Kk.II (Miltenyi Biotec); pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences); pACT, pAS1, and pGBT9 (Clontech). pcDNA-UL97-FLAG, pcDNA-UL97-HA, and pcDNA-UL97(K355M)-FLAG were described before (17Marschall M. Stein-Gerlach M. Freitag M. Kupfer R. van den Bogaard M. Stamminger T. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 1439-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). pUL97(K355M) is catalytically inactive because of point mutation of an invariant lysine residue in the ATP binding site. pAS-UL97, pACT-UL97, and pAS-UL97(K355M) were constructed by transfer of the UL97 coding sequences from pcDNA3.1 constructs to vectors pAS1 and pACT. Deletion mutants of pUL97 and p32 were generated by the production of PCR subfragments from templates pcDNA-UL97 and pACT-p32, respectively, and subsequent insertion into vectors pGBT9 and pcDNA3.1, pcDNA5/FRT, and pMACS Kk.II. PCR was performed using Vent DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs) in 35 cycles (denaturation 40 s at 95 °C, annealing 40 s at 50 °C, and polymerization 120 s at 72 °C). Point mutant p32(L243H) was isolated randomly after PCR cloning. The coding sequence of p32 was cloned into pGEX-6P-1, induced for production of GST-p32 in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (Stratagene) and used for GST purification according to standard procedures (ÄKTA prime; Amersham Biosciences).Construction of Recombinant Virus—UL97-deleted HCMV, expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter of virus replication, was generated by the use of the BACmid technology as described previously (18Messerle M. Crnkovic I. Hammerschmidt W. Ziegler H. Koszinowski U.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14759-14763Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 19Borst E. Hahn G. Koszinowski U.H.

Recombination plasmid pST-GFPneo was constructed by insertion of a 7.1-kb NheI/ClaI fragment containing GFPneo from pHM673 (16Marschall M. Freitag M. Weiler S. Sorg G. Stamminger T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1588-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) into the vector pST76K_SR by blunt end ligation (NheI/SmaI). After transformation of pST-GFPneo into E. coli carrying BAC pHB5 (19Borst E. Hahn G. Koszinowski U.H. Messerle M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8320-8329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the fragment was inserted into the US9/US10 region of the HCMV genome by homologous recombination (BAC451). Subsequently, a linear PCR fragment containing a kanamycin-resistance cassette was amplified from pKD4 (20Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10974) Google Scholar) using primers UL97-up-XhoI-P1 and UL97-down-NruI-P2 and transformed into E. coli for homologous recombination with BAC451 in the presence of pKD46 (λ Red recombinase; 20) leading to the replacement of the entire UL97 coding region (BAC821). The resistance marker was eliminated from BAC821 using pCP20 (FLP recombinase; 20) to generate BAC213. The integrity of construct BAC213 was confirmed by analyses of restriction digestion patterns and PCR. Reconstitution of infectious virus was achieved by nucleofection (Amaxa) of HFFs with BAC213. Virus-producing cultures could be monitored for GFP expression during the generation of virus stocks.Oligonucleotides—Oligonucleotide primers for PCR were purchased from Sigma-ARK (gene-specific/coding sequences underlined, restriction sites bold, and FLAG sequence in italics): 5-UL97-1-EcoRI, TAGTGAATTCATGTCCTCCGCACTTCGGTCTCGG; 5-UL97-49EcoRI, TAGTGAATTCATGGCGGTGCAGGCCGCGCAGGCC; 5-UL97-111-EcoRI, TAGTGAATTCATGCGTGACGGAGAAAAAGAGGACGCGGCT; 5-UL97-181-EcoRI, TAGTGAATTCATGGACCCCTCGGACAGCGTGAGCGGC; 5-UL97-366-EcoRI, TAGTGAATTCATGACGGTCTGGATGTCGGGCCTGATCCGCACG; 3-UL97-110-SalI-FLAG, CCGGTCGACTTACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCCACGTCACTTCGAACGCATGCG; 3-UL97-180-SalI-FLAG, CCGGTCGACTTACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCGCTGCCGCCGGTGAAGAGAGC; 3-UL97-365-SalI-FLAG, CCGGTCGACTTACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCGAGCACCGTCTCGCTGTGCTTACGC; 3-UL97-459-SalI-FLAG, CCGGTCGACTTACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCGGGTGTAATGTCAAAGTGGCATACACG; 3-UL97-523-SalI-FLAG, CCGGTCGACTTACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCGAAAGCAGGGTGGTAACATTCGCG; 3-UL97-595-SalI-FLAG, CCGGTCGACTTACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCCAACGCGCGGCAGGCCGCGC; 3-UL97-707-SalI-FLAG; CCGGTCGACTTACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCCTCGGGGAACAGTTGGCGGCA; 5-p32(1)-EcoRI BamHI, TGAGAATTCGGATCCGATGCTGCCTCTGCTGCGCTGCG; 5p32(50)-EcoRI BamHI, TGAGAATTCGGATCCGATGGCAGGTTCCGAGCGGCGGCCG; 5-p32(160)-EcoRI BamHI, TGAGAATTCGGATCCGATGCCTGAACTGACATCAACTCCC; 5-p32(214)-EcoRI BamHI, TGAGAATTCGGATCCGATGACTGGCGAGTCTGAATGGAAGG; 3-p32(213)-SalI XhoI, TGAGTCGACCTCGAGCTACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTGTCGGACTGAAAGCTAACTTCCCTGATAG; 3-p32(282)-SalI XhoI, TGAGTCGACCTCGAGCTACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTGTCCTGGCTCTTGACAAAACTCTTGAGG; 5-SF2-EcoRI, TGATGAATTCTGATGTCGGGAGGTGGTGTGATTCG; 3-SF2-XhoI, TGATCTCGAGTTATGTACGAGAGCGAGATCTGC; 5-p32-BamHI, TGATGGATCCGATGCTGCCTCTGCTGCGCTGC; 3-FLAG-KpnI, TGAGGTACCTTACTTCTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTGTC; UL97-up-XhoI-P1, TCGGTGTGGTAGCTAGTGCAGCCTTAGGAACAGGGAAGACTGTCGCCACTCTCGAGGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC; UL97-down-NruI-P2, ACCTTCTCTGTTGCCTTTCCCCTCAGCAACCGTCACGTTCCGCGTCCCGGTCGCGACATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG.Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Protein interactions were analyzed using GAL4 fusion proteins in the yeast two-hybrid system (21Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y153 expressing the UL97-GAL4BD fusion protein as a bait was used for interactor screening with a human lymphocyte cDNA library (22Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Selection for the presence of bait and interactor plasmids was achieved by cultivation on media restricting growth to combined tryptophan/leucine prototrophy. Primary transformants were selected for growth on histidine-deficient plates containing 30 mm 3-aminotriazole. His-selected colonies were analyzed for β-galactosidase activity by filter lift tests. Yeast DNA was isolated from positive clones, and interactor plasmids were rescued by transformation of E. coli strain KC8. Expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibodies mAb-GAL4BD and mAb-GAL4AD (Clontech). Plasmids were retransformed into yeast to confirm interaction before sequences of the cDNA inserts were determined by automated sequence analysis (Applied Biosystems).Coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP) Analysis—Infected HFFs or transfected 293 cells (∼5 × 106 cells) were lysed in 1 ml of CoIP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 nm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin and 2 μg/ml pepstatin) and used for CoIP with mAbs (2 μl) or polyclonal antisera (4 μl) for 2 h at 4 °C under rotation. For CoIP of LBR from HCMV-infected HFFs (see Fig. 4B), the nuclear lamina fraction was enriched by the isolation of nuclei in hypotonic buffer A (10 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by centrifugation through a 25% sucrose cushion and lysis in CoIP buffer. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added to the CoIP reactions (2.5 mg, 2 h at 4 °C, Amersham Biosciences) before complexes were pelleted, washed, and used for separation in 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis (mAb-FLAG M2, (Sigma), anti-HA.11 (Babco) mAb-UL97, anti-LBR, and anti-p32 antibodies; ECL staining, New England Biolabs).In Vitro Kinase Assay—The kinase activity of pUL97 was determined in vitro after immunoprecipitation from transfected 293 cells as described (17Marschall M. Stein-Gerlach M. Freitag M. Kupfer R. van den Bogaard M. Stamminger T. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 1439-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Putative phosphorylation substrates were either added exogenously as purified proteins (GST-p32; histone 2B, Roche Applied Science) or simultaneously immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using specific antibodies (polyclonal rabbit anti-p32, provided by W. C. Russel, U. K.; guinea pig polyclonal anti-LBR, provided by H. Herrmann, DKFZ Heidelberg; mouse mAb-lamin A/C (636) and polyclonal goat anti-lamin B (M-20), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).Indirect Immunofluorescence Double Staining—HeLa cells or HFFs were grown on coverslips for transfection or HCMV infection, respectively. 2 days post-transfection or at the indicated time points postinfection, cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 min. Primary antibodies were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. Secondary antibodies were used for double staining in green (anti-rabbit-FITC; Dianova) and red fluorescence (anti-mouse-Cy3; Dianova), by incubation for 45 min at 37 °C (nuclear counterstaining with DAPI Vectashield mounting medium; Vector Laboratories). Data for immunofluorescence were collected using an Axiovert-135 microscope at magnifications of 400 and 630 × (Zeiss). Images were recorded with a Cooled Spot Color Digital Camera (Diagnostic Instruments). Three-dimensional deconvolution microscopy was performed with an Axiovert-135 microscope equipped with Z-motor and motorized filter wheel (Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany). Metavue software was used to generate Z-series, and processing of the images was achieved with AutoDeblur (AutoQant Imaging; Watervliet, NY).Analysis of HCMV Production and Release—U373 cell clones or HFFs were used for infection with HCMV AD169 or AD169-GFP and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence staining (detection of major capsid protein-producing cells; mAb-MCP) or automated GFP fluorometry (performed with lysates of infected cells; 16). Supernatants from HCMV-infected cells were taken at consecutive times postinfection and purified from cell debris. Virus particles were pelleted by centrifugation for 2 h at 25,000 × g at 4 °C and analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and Western blot staining (mAb-pp65). For the determination of infectious virus, supernatant samples were used for plaque assay titration on HFFs using a 0.3% agar overlay. Staining of plaques was performed with 1% crystal violet at 8–12 dpi.RESULTSpUL97 Induces Alterations in the Subnuclear Localization Pattern of Lamina Components—pUL97 is required for an efficient nuclear export of viral particles (15Krosky P. Baek M.C. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Because the nuclear lamina is a natural barrier for nucleocytoplasmic transition independent of the nuclear pore complex, we investigated the morphology of the nuclear lamina in pUL97-expressing cells. First we asked for possible alterations in the typical staining pattern and subnuclear localization of the lamina components. For this, we used an expression construct for an N-terminal fragment including the first transmembrane domain of the LBR (amino acids 1–238) fused to GFP (23Ellenberg J. Siggia E.D. Moreira J.E. Smith C.L. Presley J.F. Worman H.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1193-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). This expression construct had been used previously for studies on HSV-infected cells showing that the LBR-GFP fusion protein is incorporated into the nuclear lamina and is redistributed in the context of viral infection (1Scott E.S. O'Hare P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8818-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In our experiments, LBR-GFP showed a distinct nuclear rim staining (Fig. 1A, b). Upon pUL97 coexpression, however, the membrane-associated appearance of LBR-GFP largely disappeared and was converted to a granular intranuclear structure (Fig. 1A, e). This process was dependent on the kinase activity of pUL97 because a catalytically inactive point mutant of pUL97 did not induce a comparable effect (Fig. 1A, h). Second, immunofluorescence staining of endogenous lamin A/C confirmed the morphological alteration of lamina components. In the presence of active pUL97 kinase (but not the inactive mutant) lamin A/C disappeared from the nuclear rim and was redistributed in a fashion similar to that observed for LBR-GFP (Fig. 1B, b). An examination of the fine structure of the lamina was performed by three-dimensional deconvolution microscopy (Fig. 1C, a–f). As investigated for serial levels of the cell body, intact lamin A/C rim staining was almost nondetectable in pUL97-expressing cells (Fig. 1C, a, left) but constantly detectable in pUL97-negative cells (Fig. 1C, a, right). No comparable difference was observed for a marker protein of the outer nuclear membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (calreticulin; Fig. 1C, d). It should be noted that in transiently UL97-transfected HeLa cells, alterations in the chromatin structure were observed by microscopic analysis in several cases (DAPI staining). This effect might either be associated with the rearrangement of the nuclear lamina or, alternatively, with an induction of apoptosis. Investigation of these cells using a standard assay for a typical early marker of apoptosis (annexin-V-fluos staining kit; Roche Applied Science) and a second assay detecting the activity of cellular proteases associated with apoptosis (PARP assay; Oncogene) did not provide evidence for the latter hypothesis (data not shown). In parallel, Western blot analysis revealed that no fast-migrating degradation forms of LBR and lamins appeared after UL97 transfection or HCMV infection, respectively (data not shown). This supports the conclusion that the observed changes in the subnuclear localization of lamina components are the result of depolymerization rather than proteolytic fragmentation. Interestingly, a link between pUL97 and alterations of the nuclear lamina could also be demonstrated with HCMV (AD169)-infected cells, whereas this effect was absent from cells infected with UL97-deleted HCMV (BAC213; Fig. 1D). Lack of production of pUL97 by BAC213 was controlled by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1D, g). Both viruses produced MCP, a true late marker of the replication cycle (Fig. 1D, b and h). Viral pUL84 was used as an early marker of replication for double stainings with lamin A/C in infected cells. Although AD169 replication was associated with a complete loss of signals for lamin A/C (Fig. 1D,c–f), the normal lamin A/C morphology was maintained in BAC213-infected, pUL84-positive cells (Fig. 1D, i–m). This indicates that lamin A/C relocalization may not occur in the absence of pUL97. Furthermore, in HCMV (AD169-GFP)-infected cells, a drastic reduction in the detectable amount of lamins A/C could be identified on Western blots (Fig. 1E, middle panels). This reduction was clearly dependent on virus replication as illustrated by increasing m.o.i. values (which were verified by GFP microscopy and the detection of pUL97 on Western blots; Fig. 1E, top panels). The loss of immunoreactivity of lamin A (which is not caused by proteolysis) is a late event during the course of HCMV replication as described previously by Radsak et al. (24Radsak K. Schneider D. Jost E. Brücher K.H. Arch. Virol. 1989; 105: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In our analysis, a general alteration in the amount of cellular protein in virus-infected cells could be excluded by the control staining of constant levels of β-actin Fig. 1E, bottom panels). Hyper-phosphorylation of lamins possibly leading to loss of recognition by the monoclonal antibody provides an obvious explanation. Most important seems the finding that this effect is not detectable in cells infected with UL97-deleted HCMV (BAC213). Thus, immunoreactivity of lamins A/C is not altered in BAC213-infected cells. This finding further underlines the importance of pUL97 for the lamin relocalization phenotype of HCMV replication.FIGURE 1Morphological alteration of the nuclear lamina in pUL97-expressing cells. A, HeLa cells were cotransfected with LBR-GFP in combination with vector (a–c), pUL97F (d–f), or pUL97(K355M)F (g–i). 2 days post-transfection, cells were fixed and immunostained with mAb-FLAG (Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse). Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. B, alterations of the endogenous lamins A/C were visualized using mAb-lamin A/C (FITC-conjugated anti-mouse) after transfection with vector (a), pUL97HA (b), or pUL97(K355M)HA (c) (counterstaining of pUL97 was performed by rabbit anti-HA and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit; data not shown). C, double stainings of transfected HeLa cells were analyzed by three-dimensional deconvolution microscopy. Merge of signals (a and d) and separate stainings are presented (b, lamin A/C; e, calreticulin; c, pUL97HA; f, pUL97F). D, HFFs were infected with HCMV AD169 (a–f) or BAC213 (g–m) and fixed 5 or 28 days postinfection, respectively, for immunostaining. BAC213-infected cells were monitored for virus replication during the long term infection by GFP microscopy. Before immunostaining, GFP signals were eliminated from the cell samples by repeated methanol fixation (microscopic control). Viral proteins were either immunostained separately (anti-UL97 antiserum in a and g; mAb-MCP in b and h) or in double stainings (anti-UL84 antiserum plus mAb-lamin A/C in c–f and i–m). E, HFFs were infected for 5 days with AD169-GFP (2Goldman R.D. Gruenbaum Y. Moir R.D. Shumaker D.K. Spann T.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 533-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar–6Reynolds A.E.

These interactors might either be phosphorylated targets (typically low affinity interaction) and/or might undergo protein-protein binding with pUL97 to influence its activity (possibly high affinity interaction). First, we performed a biochemical investigation of lamin proteins using lamin-specific antibodies to determine possible pUL97-specific effects. However, neither in vitro kinase assays with lamins immunoprecipitated from lysates of pUL97-expressing cells nor attempts to coimmunoprecipitate putative targets together with pUL97F (using mAb-FLAG) were successful. Thus, with these approaches we were unable to detect an in vitro phosphorylation of lamins or a direct interaction between pUL97 a"

The initially cytoprotective UPR will trigger an apoptotic cascade if the cellular insult is not corrected; however, the proteins required to initiate this cell death pathway are poorly understood.

We further demonstrate that ER stress-induced apoptosis is a caspase-dependent process that does not require the expression of caspase-12 or caspase-4 but can be inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-xL or a dominant negative caspase-9. Additionally, treatment of human and murine cells with ER stress agents led to the cleavage of the caspase-4 fluorogenic substrate, LEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin, in the presence or absence of caspase-12 or caspase-4 expression, whereas Bcl-xL or a dominant negative caspase-9 overexpression inhibited LEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin cleavage.

These proteins prevent the aggregation of misfolded proteins and facilitate proper protein folding within the ER lumen. The UPR also leads to the induction of components of the protein degradative machinery that remove misfolded proteins from the ER and a transient decrease in general protein synthesis in order to decrease the client protein load on the ER (8Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar, 9Lee K. Tirasophon W. Shen X. Michalak M. Prywes R. Okada T. Yoshida H. Mori K. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). This “physiological” UPR affords the cell time to survive a stressful insult or to develop into a mature secretory cell. However, excessive or prolonged ER stress leads to induction of the “terminal” UPR, which results in the initiation of a cell death cascade (10Shaffer A.L. Shapiro-Shelef M. Iwakoshi N.N. Lee A.H.

The ER is now being recognized as an organelle that can regulate programmed cell death, and ER stress-induced apoptosis is believed to be associated with several pathological processes, including diabetes (11Scheuner D.

Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Additionally, ER stress-induced cell death may be involved in sensitizing malignant cells to certain drugs (16Chatterjee S. Hirota H. Belfi C.A. Berger S.J. Berger N.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5112-5116PubMed Google Scholar, 17Fribley A. Zeng Q. Wang C.Y. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2003; 278: 9100-9106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). However, the signal-transducing events that connect ER stress to the cell death machinery are not clearly understood. Specifically, it is unclear how ER stress results in the activation of caspases. Caspases are a family of cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases that play a major role in apoptosis induction (19Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar, 20Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M.

Initiation of an apoptotic cascade involves the induced proximity and subsequent autoactivation of an initiator caspase (caspase-8, -9, or -10) (21Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar), which then processes and activates effector caspases (caspase-3, -6, or -7) that cleave specific targets, which ultimately results in the morphological features of apoptosis (19Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Extrinsic apoptotic stimuli activate caspase-8 and -10 through ligation of death receptors on the cell surface (22Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar), whereas intrinsic apoptotic stimuli cause the release of apoptogenic factors, such as cytochrome c, from mitochondria, leading to apoptosome formation and the activation of caspase-9 (23Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). However, initiator caspases have been shown to be involved upstream of caspase-9 in several cell death pathways. For example, the release of mitochondrial components is required for death receptor signaling in many cell types. Therefore, caspase-8 can activate the BH3-only protein Bid to induce mitochondrial permeabilization (24Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar, 30Hitomi J. Katayama T. Eguchi Y. Kudo T. Taniguchi M. Koyama Y. Manabe T.

Murine caspase-12 and human caspase-4 are members of the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme subfamily of caspases that are 48% identical at the amino acid level and have predicted structures that are consistent with initiator caspases (29Nakagawa T.

Although human caspase-12 expression has been shown to be limited to a subset of individuals of African descent and to play a role in inflammation and innate immunity (33Saleh M. Vaillancourt J.P. Graham R.K. Huyck M. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Steinberg M.H. Nolan V. Baldwin C.T. Hotchkiss R.S. Buchman T.G. Zehnbauer B.A. Hayden M.R. Farrer L.A. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Nature. 2004; 429: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), both murine caspase-12 and human caspase-4 have been reported to be localized to the ER and to be cleaved in cells treated with ER stress agents, but not in cells treated with death cytokines or various intrinsic apoptotic stimuli. Additionally, cells from caspase-12 knock-out mice and human cell lines treated with small interfering RNA to caspase-4 were shown to be resistant to ER stress-induced apoptosis triggered by known ER stress agents, and caspase-4 cleavage in treated cells was shown to be independent of Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 overexpression (29Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar, 30Hitomi J. Katayama T. Eguchi Y. Kudo T. Taniguchi M. Koyama Y. Manabe T.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). A recent study of caspase-12 protein expression in murine cell lines found that caspase-12 could not be detected in five different cell lines of hematopoietic origin (32Kalai M. Lamkanfi M. Denecker G. Boogmans M. Lippens S. Meeus A. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined one murine and one human cell line that lacks expression of murine caspase-12 or human caspase-4, respectively. We find that these cells are not protected from apoptosis induced by ER stress agents. Instead, these cells die in a caspase-dependent fashion, similar to caspase-12- or caspase-4-expressing cells. Additionally, we found that overexpression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bcl-xL, or a dominant negative caspase-9 were both capable of protecting cells from ER stress-induced cell death and inhibiting caspase-4-like activity within treated cells, indicating that ER stress-induced apoptosis proceeds through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in these cell lines. Cell Lines and Reagents—The IL-3-dependent murine pro-B cell line FL5.12 was cultured and stably transfected with Bcl-xL or dominant negative caspase-9 constructs as previously described (35Johnson B.W. Boise L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18552-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 36Cepero E. King A.M. Coffey L.M. Perez R.G. Boise L.H. Oncogene. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The MPC-11 murine myeloma cell line (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). The human multiple myeloma cell lines (8226/S, U266, MM.1S, KMS-11, and KMS-18) were cultured, and U266 cells were stably transfected with Bcl-xL as previously described (37Catlett-Falcone R. Landowski T.H. Oshiro M.M. Turkson J. Levitzki A. Savino R. Ciliberto G. Moscinski L. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Nunez G. Dalton W.S. Jove R.

To generate 8226/S pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) and Bcl-xL stable transfectants, 1 × 107 cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in 100 μl of Nucleofector Solution V (Amaxa Inc., Cologne, Germany). After adding 8 μg of plasmid DNA, the cells were then nucleofected using program G-15 on the Amaxa Nucleofector I machine. Stable transfectants were selected in 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). Tunicamycin and melphalan were purchased from Sigma. Brefeldin A and thapsigargin were purchased from EMD Biosciences (La Jolla, CA). The caspase inhibitor BocD-fmk was purchased from MP Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). Generation of Caspase-12 cDNA Constructs—A wild-type caspase-12 construct was generated by PCR using IMAGE clone number 5375109 purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) with the following primers: 5′-CCGAATTCTGCACAGCCATGGCGGCCAG-3′and 5′-CCGAATTCTGCCTGTGCTAATTCCCGGG-3′. The wild-type caspase-12 construct was sequenced and then cloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript® SK (+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A dominant negative caspase-12 (12DN) was then generated in pBluescript® SK (+) by mutating the catalytic cysteine into a serine using the Stratagene QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit and the following primers: 5′-CATCATGCAGGCCAGCAGAGGCAGATATAATGG-3′ and 5′-CCATTATATCTGCCTCTGCAGGCCTGCATGATG-3′. The sequenced 12DN and wild-type caspase-12 constructs were then cut out of pBluescript® SK (+) with EcoRI and subcloned into the pSFFV-Neo expression vector (35Johnson B.W. Boise L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18552-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Detection of Cell Death—For all cell death assays, cells (2.5 or 5.0 × 105/ml) were treated with the indicated concentrations of drug or withdrawn from IL-3 for 12 or 24 h. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and stained with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Biovision, Mountainview, CA) and propidium iodide (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and samples were acquired on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) to assess viability. Immunoblotting—Whole cell lysates (5.0 × 106 cells) were prepared in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors (170 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) (Sigma). Fifty micrograms of protein were resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell). The following primary antibodies were used: a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Bcl-xL (39Boise L.H. Minn A.J. Noel P.J. June C.H. Accavitti M.A. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Immunity. 1995; 3: 87-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar), monoclonal antibodies against caspase-4 and caspase-9 (Molecular and Biological Laboratories, Woburn, MA), a monoclonal antibody against GRP78/BiP (BD Biosciences), a rat monoclonal antibody against GRP94/gp96 (Stressgen Bioreagents, Victoria, Canada), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against caspase-12 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly MA), and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against GADD153/CHOP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and actin (Sigma). Sheep anti-mouse Ighorseradish peroxidase, goat anti-rat Ig-horseradish peroxidase, and donkey anti-rabbit Ig-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Blots were developed using chemiluminescence. Caspase Activity Assay—Cells were treated as described. Caspase activity was measured from whole cell lysates harvested after 12 or 24 h in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. Two hundred micrograms of protein were incubated in caspase-4 assay buffer (0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.5), 20% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA) and a 1 mm concentration of the caspase-4 substrate LEVD-AFC (M. P. Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) for 60 min at 37 °C. AFC release was detected with a fluorescent plate reader at an excitation value of 405 nm and an emission value of 535 nm. Identification of Cell Lines Lacking Caspase-12 or Caspase-4 Expression—Kalai et al. have reported that caspase-12 protein expression appears to be more restricted than expected and that they were unable to detect caspase-12 protein in five different murine hematopoietic cell lines (32Kalai M. Lamkanfi M. Denecker G. Boogmans M. Lippens S. Meeus A. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have determined that the FL5.12 murine pro-B cell line (Fig. 1A) and the human U266 multiple myeloma cell line (Fig. 1B) lack caspase-12 and caspase-4 expression, respectively, by Western blot analysis. Caspase-12 expression in the FL5.12 cell line was compared with that in the murine myeloma cell line, MPC-11. In order to examine the potential effects of inhibiting different points in the ER stress-induced apoptotic pathway, 12DN and dominant negative caspase-9 (9DN) constructs, in which the catalytic cysteine was mutated into a serine, and a Bcl-xL construct were stably transfected into FL5.12 cells (Fig. 1A). Caspase-4 expression in the U266 human multiple myeloma cell line was compared with four other human multiple myeloma cell lines: 8226/S, MM.1S, KMS-11, and KMS-18. U266 cells were also found to lack expression of caspase-4 mRNA by Northern blot and microarray analyses (data not shown). Similar to FL5.12 cells, U266 cells were also stably transfected with a Bcl-xL construct. ER Stress Agents Induce the UPR in Cell Lines Lacking Caspase-12 or Caspase-4 Expression—Conditions that alter ER homeostasis trigger a signaling pathway termed the UPR. The UPR can be induced by chemical agents such as tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, brefeldin A, an inhibitor of ER to Golgi transport, and thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (1Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 2Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). UPR induction is initially characterized by the up-regulation of ER-resident chaperones, such as GRP78/BiP and GRP94/gp96, which prevent the aggregation of misfolded proteins within the ER lumen (9Lee K. Tirasophon W. Shen X. Michalak M. Prywes R. Okada T. Yoshida H. Mori K. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 40Drummond I.A. Lee A.S. Resendez Jr., E.

Chem. 1983; 258: 597-603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the stress is persistent or excessive, the cell undergoes programmed cell death, and this has been associated with the induction of the transcription factor GADD153 (42Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar, 43McCullough K.D. Martindale J.L. Klotz L.O. Aw T.Y. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, a functional UPR can be induced in vector only or 12DN-, 9DN-, or Bcl-xL-overexpressing FL5.12 cells. Additionally, GRP94, GRP78, and GADD153 were up-regulated in an ER stress-specific fashion, since growth factor withdrawal, an intrinsic apoptotic stimulus, did not cause these changes in gene expression. Similarly, functional UPR induction by ER stress agents was detected in U266 cells regardless of Bcl-xL overexpression. Untreated U266 cells express high levels of the ER chaperones GRP94 and GRP78, and the levels of these proteins do not increase during any of the treatment regimens (Fig. 3). These ER chaperones are also constitutively expressed at high levels in the other human multiple myeloma cell lines (data not shown), and this expression pattern is consistent with published reports that certain survival or physiological components of the UPR must be constitutively active in secretory cells, such as plasma cells, in order for them to be able to produce and secrete large amounts of protein (3Iwakoshi N.N. Lee A.H. Glimcher L.H. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 194: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 4Iwakoshi N.N. Lee A.H. Vallabhajosyula P. Otipoby K.L. Rajewsky K. Glimcher L.H. Nat.

Chem. 2002; 277: 49047-49054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). However, GADD153 is specifically induced by ER stress agents in U266 and U266 Bcl-xL cells. Consistent with this, the DNA-damaging agent melphalan did not induce the expression of GADD153 in U266 cells (Fig. 3) or in any of the other multiple myeloma cell lines (data not shown). Together these studies demonstrate that the lack of ER-associated caspase expression or the overexpression of antiapoptotic effector proteins has no effect on ER stress signaling. Lack of Caspase-12 or Caspase-4 Expression Does Not Protect FL5.12 or U266 Cells from ER Stress-induced Apoptosis, whereas Bcl-xL and Dominant Negative Caspase-9 Overexpression Are Protective—Caspase-12 knock-out mice and human cell lines with decreased caspase-4 expression via small interfering RNAs have been shown to be resistant to ER stress agent-induced apoptosis (29Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar, 30Hitomi J. Katayama T. Eguchi Y. Kudo T. Taniguchi M. Koyama Y. Manabe T. Yamagishi S. Bando Y. Imaizumi K. Tsujimoto Y. Tohyama M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). In order to determine the effect of a lack of caspase-12 or caspase-4 expression on the sensitivity of FL5.12 and U266 cells to ER stress agents, these cells were treated with increasing concentrations of tunicamycin, brefeldin A, and thapsigargin for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 4A, Neo and 12DN cells died in a dose-dependent fashion in response to all three ER stress agents. However, Bcl-xL or 9DN overexpression completely protected cells from brefeldin A- and thapsigargin-induced apoptosis and was partially protective against tunicamycin-induced apoptosis. Similarly, U266 cells had levels of sensitivity to tunicamycin, brefeldin A, and thapsigargin that were comparable with other human multiple myeloma cell lines (Fig. 4B) and Bcl-xL overexpression protected cells against brefeldin A- and thapsigargin-induced apoptosis and made cells more resistant to tunicamycin. These results suggest that the lack of caspase-12 or caspase-4 expression in FL5.12 and U266 cells, respectively, does not make these cells resistant to ER stress-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the Bcl-xL and 9DN overexpression experiments indicate that the classic intrinsic pathway of caspase activation is required for ER stress-induced apoptosis in these cells, although other death signaling pathways may be involved in tunicamycin-treated cells. ER Stress-induced Apoptosis in FL5.12 and U266 Cells Is Caspase-dependent—One explanation for the sensitivity of cells lacking caspase-12 or caspase-4 to agents that are known to cause ER stress-induced cell death is that at the concentrations tested, these agents are inducing a caspase-independent necrosis. Therefore, in order to determine whether ER stressinduced cell death in caspase-12- and caspase-4-nonexpressing cells is a caspase-dependent process, FL5.12 (Fig. 5A) and U266 cells (Fig. 5B) were treated with low and high concentrations of tunicamycin, brefeldin A, and thapsigargin in the presence or absence of a 100 μm concentration of the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor BocD-fmk. BocD-fmk restored cell viability for Neo, 12DN, and U266 cells under all treatment conditions except for high concentrations of tunicamycin. Whereas Bcl-xL or 9DN overexpression was generally protective against ER stress agent treatment, the addition of BocD-fmk restored cell viability in U266 Bcl-xL cells treated with a high concentration of thapsigargin. Similar to parental or vector control cells, cell viability could not be restored in Bcl-xL- or 9DN-overexpressing cells treated with 100 μm tunicamycin in the presence of BocD-fmk, consistent with the possibility that tunicamycin may induce other death-signaling pathways and suggesting that this concentration may induce a caspase-independent necrotic cell death. Taken together, these data suggest that ER stress-induced cell death is a caspase-dependent process at most of the drug concentrations examined, even in cells that do not express caspase-12 or caspase-4. Expressing Wild-type Caspase-12 in FL5.12 Cells Does Not Alter Sensitivity to ER Stress Agents—Whereas comparing U266 cells to other myeloma cell lines that express caspase-4 suggests that cells lacking this caspase display similar sensitivities to ER stress signals, we were unable to perform similar experiments with FL5.12 and MPC-11 cells. MPC-11 cells are more sensitive to ER stress- and proteasome inhibitor-induced apoptosis (data not shown). However, this myeloma cell line may have enhanced sensitivity to these agents due to its plasma cell phenotype. We have found that human multiple myeloma cell lines are also more sensitive to such signals when compared with other human cell lines, regardless of caspase-4 expression. 2E. A. Obeng and L. H. Boise, unpublished observations. Thus, in order to determine whether restoring caspase-12 expression would affect the sensitivity of FL5.12 cells to ER stress agents, wild-type caspase-12 was stably transfected into FL5.12 cells (Fig. 6A). Neo, wild-type caspase-12, and 12DN cells were then treated with increasing concentrations of tunicamycin, brefeldin A, and thapsigargin for 24 h before cell viability was assessed (Fig. 6B). The sensitivity of FL5.12 cells to treatment with any of the three ER stress agents was not altered by wild-type caspase-12 overexpression, suggesting that activation of the ER stress-induced apoptotic pathway occurs in an efficient manner in the absence of caspase-12 in these cells.

https://openalex.org/W2099916172,"Previous predictions of sea-level change subsequent to the last glacial maximum show significant, systematic discrepancies between observations at Tahiti, Huon Peninsula, and Sunda Shelf during Lateglacial time (approximately 14,000 to 9000 calibrated years before the present). We demonstrate that a model of glacial isostatic adjustment characterized by both a high-viscosity lower mantle (4 x 10(22) Pa s) and a large contribution from the Antarctic ice sheet to meltwater pulse IA (approximately 15-meters eustatic equivalent) resolves these discrepancies. This result supports arguments that an early and rapid Antarctic deglaciation contributed to a sequence of climatic events that ended the most recent glacial period of the current ice age."
https://openalex.org/W2033206186,"Protein and lipid kinases are two important classes of biomedically relevant enzymes. The expression and activity of many kinases are known to be dysregulated in a variety of diseases, and proteomic tools that can assess the presence and activity of these enzymes are likely to be useful for their evaluation. Because many of the mechanisms by which protein kinases can become unregulated involve post-translational modifications or changes in protein localization, they can only be detected by examining protein activity, sometimes within the context of the living cell. Wortmannin is a steroid-derived fungal metabolite that covalently inhibits both protein and lipid kinases. Here we describe the synthesis of three wortmannin derivatives, biotin-wortmannin, BODIPY-wortmannin, and tetramethylrhodamine-wortmannin. We demonstrate that these reagents exhibit reactivity similarly as wortmannin and react with members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and PI3-kinase related kinase families in cellular lysates. Moreover, in some cases these reagents can differentiate between the active and inactive forms of the enzyme, indicating that they are activity-based probes. The reagents also exhibit complementary properties. The biotin-wortmannin reagent is effective in the isolation of labeled proteins; all three can be used for protein labeling, and BODIPY-wortmannin is cell-permeable and can be used to label proteins within cells.

This approach relies upon the development of bifunctional chemical probes that act in a covalent and site-directed manner with some subset of the proteome and contain a second functional group for either visualization and/or isolation of the probe-labeled proteins. Among the probes that have been developed for ABPP are molecules that target the serine hydrolyases (1Liu Y. Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein and lipid kinases are two important classes of biomedically relevant enzymes for which no cell-permeable ABPP probes exist. Because the expression and activity of many kinases are known to be dysregulated in a variety of diseases (14Wymann M.P. Marone R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 15Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Science. 2004; 303: 1800-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar), proteomic tools that can assess the presence and activity of these enzymes are likely to be useful for their evaluation. Moreover, many of the mechanisms by which protein kinases can become unregulated involve post-translational modifications or changes in protein localization. Thus, these mechanisms can only be detected by examining protein activity, sometimes within the context of a living cell. One important class of kinases involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes related to cancer, inflammation, immunology, and cardiovascular disease is the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) family (14Wymann M.P. Marone R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Members of the PI 3-kinase family phosphorylate the 3′-hydroxyl position of the inositol head group of member phosphoinositides. Eight mammalian PI 3-kinases have been identified and categorized into three main classes (16Anderson K.E. Jackson S.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Another related family of kinases is the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family. Though related in sequence to the lipid kinases, these enzymes act as protein kinases and have no apparent lipid kinase activity (reviewed in Refs. 17Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Cell. 2004; 118: 9-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar and 18Abraham R.T. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, members of this family include ATM, ATR, DNA-PKcs, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and SMG-1, and they function in many processes related to cellular stress responses including DNA damage checkpoints, double strand break repair, nutrient and growth factor sensing, and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Importantly, many of the PIKKs are also involved in physiological and pathological processes related to cancer, and the loss of at least one of these kinases, ATM, predisposes affected individuals to cancer (19Sherr C.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 20Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Nature. 2004; 432: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar). Wortmannin is a fungal metabolite (21Brian P. Curtis P. Hemming H. Norris G. Trans. Brit. Mycol. Soc. 1957; 40: 365-368Crossref Google Scholar) that was originally identified as a potent and selective inhibitor of PI 3-kinase family members (22Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 23Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A variety of recent studies have shown that wortmannin also inhibits members of the PIKK family, albeit with reduced potency (24Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). Wortmannin reacts in an irreversible manner with a critical lysine residue in the kinase domain of the PI 3-kinases, and this lysine is conserved in the different PI 3-kinase and PIKK family members (25Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). As an irreversible, covalent inhibitor with a number of targets, wortmannin is an ideal starting point for development of a new ABPP probe. Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of three derivatives of wortmannin, namely biotin-wortmannin, BODIPY-wortmannin, and TMR-wortmannin. All three wortmannin derivatives react with members of the PI 3-kinase and PIKK families in cellular lysates, and one, BODIPY-wortmannin, is also cell-permeable. Reagents and Cell Lines—Wortmannin derivatives were stored at -20 °C in Me2SO. Antibodies for ATM were a gift of Dr. Michael Kastan. Antibodies for DNA-PKcs (Serotec), FLAG (M5, Sigma), and N-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) are commercially available. ATR (26Schmidt D.R. Schreiber S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14711-14717Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP) (27Bomgarden R.D. Yean D. Yee M.C. Cimprich K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13346-13353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) antibodies have been described previously. Plasmids for expression of p110 and p85 were provided by Dr. Jonathan Backer (Albert Einstein College of Medicine). LY294002 and staurosporine were purchased from Sigma, and stock solutions were made in Me2SO. Human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells were transfected with FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's directions. HEK293T, NIH 3T3, MO59J, and MO59K cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum. pEBS7 and YZ5 cells lines were provided by Dr. Yosef Shiloh and maintained as described (28Ziv Y. Bar-Shira A. Pecker I. Russell P. Jorgensen T.J. Tsarfati I. Shiloh Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Chemistry—Detailed experimental procedures for the preparation of wortmannin derivatives are provided in supplemental material available in the on-line version of this article. Wortmannin was obtained from Fermentek (Jerusalem, Israel). Preparation and Labeling of Cell Lysates—Nuclear lysates were prepared as described using HeLa cell pellets from the National Cell Culture Center (27Bomgarden R.D. Yean D. Yee M.C. Cimprich K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13346-13353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When whole cell lysates were prepared, cells were washed with PBS and then scraped into 1 ml of PBS with 0.5 mm EDTA and transferred to a microfuge tube. Cells were washed again with PBS before flash freezing or lysis. Cells were lysed in TGN (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Tween, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40) or MIPP buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, and 5% glycerol) with phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4) and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin and 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) unless otherwise indicated. Cell lysates were adjusted to 2 mg/ml before the addition of wortmannin derivatives. After labeling, lysates were quenched by the addition of one-sixth volume of 6× sample buffer (made without bromphenol blue when used for fluorescent detection) and boiled. Kinase Assays—Kinase reactions were performed on FLAG-ATR precipitates prepared as described (29Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar). Kinase reactions contained GST-RAD17 (1.5 μg) in 27.5 μl of kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm MnCl2) with 1 μl (10 μCi) of [γ-32P]ATP and 50 μM cold ATP. Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and then stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 6× SDS sample buffer and heating for 8 min at 95 °C. GST-Rad17 SQ2 was prepared as described (30Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37538-37543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Incubation with wortmannin/wortmannin derivatives was carried out in kinase buffer without ATP for 15 min at 30 °C. For DNA-PK kinase reactions, purified DNA-PK (100 units/μl, 0.5 μl; Promega) was incubated in a total volume of 30 μl containing 2 μl of EcoR1-digested plasmid (100 ng/μl), 18.5 μl of buffer B (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm KCl), 7.5 μl of H2O, and wortmannin/wortmannin derivative for 10 min at 22 °C. To this mixture was then added 0.3 μl [γ-32P]ATP, 0.8 μl of 10 mm ATP, 4 μl of buffer A (13 mm spermidine and 4 mm MgCl2), 3 μl of buffer B, and 2 μg of GST-p53-(1-101) (2 μg/μl) prepared as described (29Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and then stopped by the addition of 10 μlof6× SDS sample buffer and heating for 8 min at 95 °C. In Vivo Labeling of Cells—For competition experiments, cells were first incubated with wortmannin (30 μm) for 15 min. BODIPY-wortmannin was then added to the medium to 10 μm, and cells were incubated for another 30 min. After labeling, the medium was removed and cells were washed 2 times with PBS, scraped into 1 ml of PBS with 0.5 mm EDTA, transferred to a microfuge tube, and washed twice more with PBS before lysis. Biotin-Wortmannin—Before labeling with biotin-wortmannin, samples were precleared by incubating with streptavidin-Sepharose beads (60 μl of 2 mg/ml lysate to 20 μl of streptavidin-Sepharose; Amersham Biosciences) to reduce nonspecific binding to biotin. After biotin-wortmannin labeling, samples were run on 6% acrylamide gels and blotted to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked by incubation in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature, and the membrane was then washed four times for 5 min each in TBST. Streptavidin-HRP (1 mg/ml stock in PBS; Molecular Probes) was added at 1:2000 in TBST, and the blot was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was washed 4 × 10 min in TBST and then developed with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). TMR-Wortmannin—After labeling and quenching, samples were run on an acrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel, still sandwiched between glass plates, was scanned on an Amersham Biosciences Typhoon PhosphorImager at an excitation of 532 nm, and emission was detected using a 580-nm BP30 filter. BODIPY-Wortmannin—Samples were run in the same manner as for TMR-wortmannin, except that the gel was scanned at an excitation of 488 nm and emission was detected using a 520-nm BP40 filter. Synthesis of Biotin-, BODIPY-, and TMR-Wortmannin Derivatives—Structure-activity studies of wortmannin derivatives have revealed that, although the acylation of the C11 hydroxyl group appears to be important for activity, there is considerable flexibility in the size of the ester substituent that can be accommodated at this position (31Creemer L.C. Kirst H.A. Vlahos C.J. Schultz R.M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 5021-5024Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, we treated wortmannin with diethylamine, which resulted in rapid opening of the furan ring followed by deacetylation of the C11 acetate functional group. Subsequent treatment with hydrochloric acid reformed the furan ring producing 11-O-deacetylwortmannin in high yield. This compound was acylated with a biotin derivative to produce biotin-wortmannin, in which the two compounds are linked by a short polyethylene glycol-derived linker (Fig. 1). As a control compound we prepared the methyl ester of the biotin derivative. Treatment of deacetylwortmannin with a BODIPY-derived carboxylic acid and a coupling reagent produced BODIPY-wortmannin with fluorescent properties similar to those of fluorescein. Finally, deacetylwortmannin was acylated with t-butoxycarbonyl-protected aminovaleric acid. Removal of the t-butoxycarbonyl group revealed a primary amine, which was directly acylated using an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester derivative of tetramethylrhodamine to produce TMR-wortmannin. Biotin-Wortmannin Inhibits ATR and DNA-PK Kinase Activity—Wortmannin is known to inhibit members of the PI 3-kinase and PIKK families. To determine whether our biotin-wortmannin reagent could inhibit these kinases, we performed in vitro kinase assays with two of these kinases. DNA-PK is a member of the PIKK family that is activated by double-stranded DNA ends and can phosphorylate a number of different proteins in vitro (17Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Cell. 2004; 118: 9-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 32Smith G.C.M. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of biotin-wortmannin to inhibit purified DNA-PK in vitro using GST-p53 as a substrate (Fig. 2A). The phosphorylation of p53, which led to a decrease in the mobility of this protein by SDS-PAGE, was monitored by incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP. Upon the addition of increasing concentrations of biotin-wortmannin, we observed decreased phosphorylation of p53 with significant inhibition at biotin-wortmannin concentrations of 1-2 μm. Detection of biotin-wortmannin-labeled DNA-PKcs using streptavidin-HRP was first observed at 1 μm and increased as the concentration of biotin-wortmannin increased. These results indicate that biotin-wortmannin inhibits DNA-PKcs kinase activity in vitro and further suggest that the interaction between biotin-wortmannin and DNA-PKcs is covalent. We also tested the ability of our biotin-wortmannin reagent to inhibit the kinase activity of ATR, another member of the PIKK family (Fig. 2B). In this case, HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged ATR, and FLAG proteins were precipitated with an antibody to the FLAG epitope. GST-Rad17 was then added to each sample as the substrate, and the incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP was monitored by autoradiography. The GST-Rad17 phosphorylation signal decreased significantly starting at biotin-wortmannin concentrations of 20-35 μm. Labeling of ATR was first observed at 10 μm and increased with increasing concentrations of biotin-wortmannin. The reactivity of biotin-wortmannin was compared with the reactivity of wortmannin by determining the inhibitory concentration (50%) (IC50) of each compound for DNA-PKcs and ATR with these assays (data not shown). Three to four experiments were carried out for each condition in which the substrate phosphorylation was quantified. For the ATR kinase assay, these values were corrected for equal ATR expression by taking the anti-FLAG Western signal as a reference. Analysis of the resulting data indicates that biotin-wortmannin is less potent than wortmannin for both ATR and DNA-PKcs. Under the conditions of these experiments, the IC50 of wortmannin for ATR was 1.8 μm, whereas the IC50 for biotin-wortmannin was 10.8 μm. For DNA-PKcs, an IC50 of 0.14 μm was observed for wortmannin and an IC50 of 1.15 μm was observed for biotin-wortmannin. This observation indicates that the conjugation of wortmannin to biotin resulted in a 6- to 8-fold decrease in its potency. Identification and Isolation of Wortmannin-sensitive Kinases with Biotin-Wortmannin—One application for use of the biotin-wortmannin reagent is in the isolation and identification of wortmannin-labeled proteins. To determine whether our biotin-wortmannin reagent could be used as an affinity reagent, we examined its ability to precipitate known wortmannin targets at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 50 μm after incubation with streptavidin-Sepharose. Because of our interest in members of the PIKK family and their predominant localization to the nucleus, we used nuclear extracts for these experiments and tested for the presence of these family members in pull-down experiments. We found that ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs, three members of the PIKK family, were present in the biotin-wortmannin precipitates but not in precipitates prepared using the biotin control compound (Fig. 3A). DNA-PKcs was observed in precipitates prepared from extracts treated with 0.5 μm biotin-wortmannin at 4 °C, whereas ATM was first observed in precipitates after treatment with 2 μm biotin-wortmannin reagent. ATR was only detected in precipitates obtained from extracts treated with 10 μm biotin-wortmannin, and, for efficient precipitation of ATR, incubation at 30 °C was necessary. This reactivity correlates with the known sensitivity of these kinases to wortmannin (24Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether this labeling occurred in a specific manner, we tested the ability of several agents to compete with biotin-wortmannin for the target proteins. To do so, a HeLa cell nuclear extract was incubated with either 150 μm wortmannin or 1 mm ATP prior to treatment with biotin-wortmannin (30 μm) and subsequent precipitation with streptavidin-Sepharose. The precipitated proteins were then analyzed by Western blot with antibodies to either DNA-PKcs or ATM. As shown in Fig. 3B, incubation of lysates with wortmannin before the addition of biotin-wortmannin significantly reduced the efficiency with which ATM and DNA-PKcs were precipitated. Prior denaturation by incubation at 95 °C also prevented the precipitation reaction, as no ATM or DNA-PKcs was detected in the precipitates. These results suggest that ATM and DNA-PKcs are specifically labeled by the biotin-wortmannin compound. As heat treatment also prevents biotin-wortmannin-mediated precipitation, we hypothesize that proper folding of the proteins is necessary for its specific reaction with the biotin-wortmannin compound. This hypothesis is consistent with data suggesting that biotin-wortmannin reacts with a specific lysine in the catalytic site of sensitive kinases (25Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). TMR-Wortmannin Targets DNA-PKcs and p110—Another potential use for our labeled wortmannin derivatives is the labeling of complex mixtures of proteins in cellular extracts. To determine whether this was feasible with the TMR-wortmannin derivative, we first tested the ability of TMR-wortmannin to label protein in two cell lines derived from the same tumor, one lacking DNA-PKcs (MO59J) and another containing this protein (MO59K) (33Lees-Miller S.P. Godbout R. Chan D.W. Weinfeld M. Day III, R.S. Barron G.M. Allalunis-Turner J. Science. 1995; 267: 1183-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, incubation of TMR-wortmannin with whole cell extracts prepared from MO59K cells for 5 min at 25 nm led to labeling of a high molecular mass protein as well as several lower molecular mass proteins ranging between 95 and 110 kDa. However, in lysates prepared from MO59J cells incubated under the same conditions, no labeling of the high molecular mass band was observed. This observation strongly suggests that the high molecular mass protein is the 450-kDa catalytic subunit of DNA-PK. The four lower molecular mass proteins observed upon the incubation of TMR-wortmannin with this whole cell lysate were of the size expected for members of the PI 3-kinase family of lipid kinases. Members of this family are potently inhibited by wortmannin, and labeling of these three/four bands could be blocked by prior incubation with low concentrations of wortmannin (data not shown; see also Fig. 5B), suggesting they might be members of this family. To directly determine whether the p110 protein could be labeled by wortmannin in cell lysates, we transfected cells with an expression vector for Myc-tagged p110α either alone or together with a vector for hemagglutinin-tagged p85, the regulatory subunit of p110 known to be necessary for stabilization of the p110 protein in cells (34Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that TMR-wortmannin labeling of a 110-kDa protein was dramatically increased upon the expression of both p110 and p85 and that this labeling correlated with the expression of Myc-tagged p110 (Fig. 4B). This finding indicates that the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase is labeled by TMR-wortmannin in cells and suggests that the bands observed at p110 in untransfected cells are members of this family of lipid kinases. Profiling Protein Kinases with Fluorescent Wortmannin Probes—To test the ability of BODIPY-wortmannin and TMR-wortmannin to resolve activity and expression patterns between different cell types, we compared the profiles of wortmannin-labeled proteins from extracts of several different cell lines using a low concentration (100 nm) of each probe (Fig. 5A). Although most of the proteins showed similar patterns of expression within this limited group of cell lines, some differences were noted. The 450-kDa protein identified as DNA-PKcs was expressed in all of the human cell lines studied with the exception of the MO59J cells, which are known to lack this protein. However, little labeling of DNA-PKcs was observed in the mouse 3T3 cell line, suggesting that mouse cells express low levels of this protein. Another protein of 60-65 kDa was found in all of the human cell lines examined, but no labeling of this protein was apparent in 3T3 cells. Labeling of the putative PI 3-kinase family members (see 90-120 kDa range in Fig. 5) varied widely, suggesting that either expression levels or reactivity of these kinases is different in the various lines examined. In this context, a high molecular mass band of ∼220 kDa was specifically labeled in 293T cells with TMR-wortmannin. Finally, an unknown protein with a mobility slightly faster than that of DNA-PKcs was also observed in all of the cell lines treated with TMR-wortmannin. Interestingly, however, this protein was not labeled by the BODIPY-wortmannin reagent, suggesting that the fluorescent label might impart some differences to the specificity of the reagent. To examine the specificity of labeling with these reagents, we preincubated lysates with wortmannin prior to incubation with the labeled wortmannin derivative. As shown in Fig. 5B, a subset of the proteins labeled by BODIPY-wortmannin and TMR-wortmannin at 1 μm was not labeled when extracts were pretreated with an excess of wortmannin. Notably, most of the bands that disappeared when wortmannin was used as a competitor were also found to be labeled when a lower concentration (100 nm) of the fluorescent wortmannin derivatives was used as shown in Fig. 5A. As additional controls, we also determined the effect of staurosporine and LY294002 on the labeling of the PI 3-kinase family members (Fig. 5C). Staurosporine is a nonspecific kinase inhibitor, and LY294002 is a non-covalent inhibitor of lipid kinases; both have been shown to bind in the same site as wortmannin (35Walker E.H. Pacold M.E. Perisic O. Stephens L. Hawkins P.T. Wymann M.P. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 909-919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Consistent with these structural studies, we found that LY294002 prevented labeling with TMR-wortmannin. Staurosporine also reduced labeling by TMR-wortmannin, albeit weakly, consistent with its lower affinity. These observations indicate that our wortmannin derivatives act in the active site of protein and lipid kinases. Taken together, they also indicate that the fluorescent probes will be useful for profiling the expression of a number of different lipid and protein kinases in cell extracts. BODIPY-Wortmannin Is Cell Permeable—Optimal use of these wortmannin probes would allow for labeling of proteins within cells. To test the possibility that either TMR-wortmannin or BODIPY-wortmannin could be used for such experiments, we incubated cells with either 10 μm TMR-wortmannin or 10 μm BODIPY-wortmannin for 30 min and prepared cell lysates from the cells after washing. In both cases, a parallel set of samples was preincubated with wortmannin prior to the addition of the labeled probe to determine the specificity of labeling. We found that a number of proteins were labeled in cells treated with the BODIPY-wortmannin, though little labeling was observed in cells treated with TMR-wortmannin (Fig. 6). Moreover, labeling of several proteins in cells treated with BODIPY-wortmannin was blocked by preincubation of the cells with wortmannin, indicating that the labeling was specific in these cases. Among the proteins specifically labeled in cells are DNA-PKcs, at least one of the PI 3-kinase family members, two proteins between 250 and 450 kDa, and a protein of 60-70 kDa. Phosphatase Treatment Affects DNA-PKcs Labeling—Protein phosphorylation is known to regulate the activity of many kinases, and we reasoned that changes in kinase phosphorylation status might affect the ability of some kinases to react with the wortmannin probes. To test this idea, we examined the reactivity of biotin-wortmannin in lysates prepared in the presence and absence of phosphatase inhibitors. Interestingly, we found that biotin-wortmannin reproducibly labeled DNA-PKcs to a more significant extent in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (Fig. 7). At least one other protein of ∼65 kDa was also differentially labeled in the presence or absence of phosphatase inhibitors. These observations suggest that the reactivity of these two proteins with wortmannin may be affected by their phosphorylation state. In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of three new wortmannin derivatives that are linked via a water-soluble polyethylene glycol linker to biotin or to the fluorescent probes BODIPY or TMR. With these compounds, it is now possible to specifically profile members of the PI 3-kinase and PIKK families as a whole or in groups by varying parameters such as inhibitor concentration. Members of these protein and lipid kinase families play roles in important cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair. These wortmannin derivatives allow isolation of the modified proteins, efficient detection, and labeling of wortmannin-sensitive proteins within the cell. Thus, these derivatives should be useful reagents for ABPP. In vitro, the biotin-wortmannin probe appears to have a similar reactivity profile to wortmannin as determined using an anti-wortmannin antibody (data not shown), and the other two probes, BODIPY-wortmannin and TMR-wortmannin, exhibit similar reactivity. Furthermore, because the kinase activity of at least two members of the PIKK family can be inhibited with biotin-wortmannin and the labeling of several proteins can be blocked by prior incubation with wortmannin, it seems likely that these new probes react like wortmannin, with the lysine corresponding to Lys-802 (p110α numbering) in the active site of each kinase. These observations also suggest that attachment of the linker and different reporters (i.e. biotin, BODIPY and TMR) has minimal effect on probe specificity, although some differences were noted. However, the potency of the biotin-wortmannin compound is slightly reduced relative to that of wortmannin. A comparison of the IC50s for wortmannin and biotin-wortmannin for ATR and DNA-PKcs showed a 6- and 8-fold reduction in reactivity, respectively. This decrease is not surprising, as previous groups have shown a 4-fold decrease in activity for 11-O-desacetylwortmannin (31Creemer L.C. Kirst H.A. Vlahos C.J. Schultz R.M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 5021-5024Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this context, it should be noted that some known wortmannin-sensitive kinases were not detectable under our conditions. For example, ATM and ATR were not readily detected under these conditions in whole cell lysates. This could be due to the low abundance of these proteins, their lower reactivity toward wortmannin, or both. In any case, it is likely that enrichment of certain fractions or use of a liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy system for ABPP would address this limitation (36Adam G.C. Burbaum J. Kozarich J.W. Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 1363-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). One important consideration involves the use of these compounds as profiling agents either in cells or in lysates. We have shown that BODIPY-wortmannin is cell-permeable, whereas TMR-wortmannin and biotin-wortmannin are only useful for lysates (Fig. 6 and data not shown). The cell-permeable nature of BODIPY-wortmannin makes analysis of wortmannin-sensitive proteins possible in cells. The activity of some proteins may vary under different conditions (e.g. stimulation, starvation and cell cycle stage) and in a manner that can only be detected in the context of a cell because of subcellular localization or association with other proteins. This, in turn, may influence the reactivity of these proteins with the wortmannin probes. Thus, the ability to label proteins with BODIPY-wortmannin within a cell provides a potentially powerful tool for examining the biological activity of wortmannin-sensitive kinases within their native environment. Our data suggest that these wortmannin probes can be used to monitor differences in the activation state of at least some of the proteins targeted. Although we saw no difference in the reactivity of P13-kinase family members with TMR-wortmannin in either starved or platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated cells (data not shown), we did see a modest but reproducible effect of phosphatase inhibitors on the labeling of DNA-PKcs with biotin-wortmannin. This suggests that the sensitivity of DNA-PKcs toward wortmannin is influenced by its phosphorylation state and is consistent with experiments that demonstrate the regulation of DNA-PKcs by phosphorylation (37Chan D.W. Chen B.P. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 38Douglas P. Sapkota G.P. Morrice N. Yu Y. Goodarzi A.A. Merkle D. Meek K. Alessi D.R. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Moreover, as our work was being written up, another group reported the synthesis of a related wortmannin-derived activity-based probe and showed that it inhibited Polo-like kinase (PLK) in an activity-dependent manner (39Liu Y. Shreder K.R. Gai W. Corral S. Ferris D.K. Rosenblum J.S. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 99-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It is likely that PLK is the 65-kDa protein observed in our samples that was labeled both in lysates and cells. Our probes are complementary to the TMR-derived probe described by Liu et al. (39Liu Y. Shreder K.R. Gai W. Corral S. Ferris D.K. Rosenblum J.S. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 99-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and we anticipate that the cell-permeable nature of our BODIPY probe will be particularly useful. Although the full scope of these probes' utility in profiling kinase activity is not yet clear, what is clear is that these probes will be useful for proteomic studies designed to profile protein levels and to identify new wortmannin-sensitive targets in mammalian cells and other species. The TMR-wortmannin probe was clearly superior to the biotinylated probe for the profiling studies. It was significantly more sensitive than both the BODIPY-wortmannin and biotin-wortmannin probes (data not shown) and, unlike the biotin-wortmannin probe, did not require pre-clearing of lysates to remove proteins that bind to streptavidin. However, the biotinylated derivative is useful for protein isolation. Although several of the proteins labeled in our lysates were readily identified, some were not, and the biotinylated derivative should be useful in isolation and characterization of these proteins. In summary, we have shown that three wortmannin-derived, activity-based probes can be useful for profiling kinases both in lysates and living cells. These probes have complementary properties that should allow exploration and identification of wortmannin-sensitive kinases and their biological activity both in cell lysates and in their native environment of the cell.

Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and are involved in humoral immunity and allergic reactions. The direction of Th cell differentiation depends on the types of cytokine in the environmental milieu (2Seder R.A. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev.

Naive CD4 T cells stimulated with antigens in the presence of IL-12 differentiate into Th1 cells, whereas the presence of IL-4 drives differentiation into Th2 cells (4Abbas A.K. Murphy K.M. Sher A.

IL-12-mediated activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 4 is crucial for Th1 cell differentiation, and IL-4-mediated STAT6 activation is important for Th2 cell development (7Gately M.K.

We reported that Th2 cell differentiation is highly dependent on the extent of TCR-mediated activation of the p56lck, calcineurin, and Ras-ERK MAPK signaling cascade (10Yamashita M. Hashimoto K.

In particular, inhibition of the activation of the Ras-ERK MAPK cascade caused a shift from Th2 to Th1 cell differentiation, suggesting that the direction of Th1/Th2 cell differentiation could be controlled by TCR-mediated activation of the Ras-ERK MAPK cascade (11Yamashita M.

On the other hand, Th1 cell development appeared to be regulated by another MAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (14Dong C. Yang D.D. Wysk M. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A.

GATA3 is selectively induced in developing Th2 cells after TCR stimulation in the presence of IL-4, and ectopic expression of GATA3 resulted in the induction of Th2 cell differentiation in the absence of STAT6 (17Zhang D.H.

Protein ubiquitination is involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, antigen presentation, and apoptosis (28Tanaka K. Chiba T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 29Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 30Laney J.D.

Emerging views suggest that various aspects of the immune system are controlled by ubiquitination (32Liu Y.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 81-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). A well known example of the ubiquitin-dependent regulation in the immune system is the proteasome-dependent processing of peptides in antigen-presenting cells (33Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 739-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). It is also well known that lipopolysaccharide or proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 can induce activation of NF-κB through ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the inhibitor of κB (34Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4045) Google Scholar). However, a role for the ubiquitin-mediated regulation of Th1/Th2 cell differentiation has not been reported.In the present study, we investigated the molecular targets of the Ras-ERK MAPK cascade that control chromatin remodeling of the Th2 cytokine gene loci and subsequent Th2 cell differentiation, and we found that the Ras-ERK MAPK cascade controls the stability of the GATA3 protein through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Moreover, we demonstrated that the ubiquitination of GATA3 by Mdm2 is dependent on a ring finger domain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMice—C57BL/6 mice were purchased from SLC (Shizuoka, Japan).

Kimura M. Kubo M. Shimizu C. Tada T. Perlmutter R.M. Nakayama T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1024-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 13Shibata Y. Kamata T. Kimura M.

Hyperacetylation of the Th2 cytokine gene loci was highly dependent on the expression of GATA3 (23Yamashita M. Ukai-Tadenuma M. Kimura M. Omori M. Inami M. Taniguchi M. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42399-42408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 26Inami M. Yamashita M. Tenda Y. Hasegawa A. Kimura M. Hashimoto K. Seki N. Taniguchi M. Nakayama T.

We present here further confirmation of the observations in chromatin remodeling of the Th2 gene loci. The generation of IL-4-producing cells was substantially inhibited in the presence of a specific inhibitor of MEK (an ERK MAPKK), PD98059 (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B shows that the acetylation levels of histones associated with the Th2 cytokine gene loci (IL-4 promoter, IL-13 promoter, IL-5 promoter, GATA3-response element, CNS1, and IL-4 VA enhancer) were significantly reduced in the presence of PD98059. In the case of RAD50, there was no significant effect with PD98059 treatment, and with the IFNγ promoter (IFNγp) there was some enhancement in the acetylation. Under Th1 culture conditions, PD98059 exhibited no detectable inhibition of acetylation at the IFNγ promoter region (data not shown).In addition, the effect of ectopic expression of an active form of Raf-1 (active-Raf) on the generation of Th1/Th2 cells was assessed. Significant numbers of IL-4-producing Th2 cells and a suppression of the generation of IFNγ-producing cells were observed in active Raf-infected cells stimulated under Th1–conditions (Fig. 1C). As a positive control, GATA3 infection was included, and in this case substantial levels of IL-4-producing cells with decreased numbers of IFNγ-producing cells were detected. Assessment of the acetylation status of histones in the active Raf-infected or GATA3-infected T cells defined by GFP expression on day 2 revealed significant increases in acetylation at the IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5 promoters and CNS1 and IL-4 VA enhancer regions; however, the effect on the RAD50 promoter region was marginal (Fig. 1D). A significant decrease in the acetylation of the IFNγ promoter region was observed in the presence of active Raf. The levels of acetylation induced by active Raf infection were lower than those induced by GATA3. A possible explanation for this could be the limited expression of GATA3 in T cells cultured under Th1–conditions. Nevertheless, it is clear that the ERK-MAPK cascade controls GATA3-dependent histone hyperacetylation of the Th2 cytokine gene loci in developing Th2 cells.Activation of the Ras-ERK MAPK Cascade Is Required for Stable Expression of GATA3 Protein in Developing Th2 Cells— GATA3 is a critical transcriptional factor for Th2 cell differentiation (17Zhang D.H.

Here we demonstrate this in freshly prepared splenic CD4 T cells stimulated under Th1 and Th2 conditions (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 3 and lanes 2 and 4). Treatment of Th2 condition cultures with PD98059 resulted in decreased protein expression of GATA3 (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6). Similarly, the induction of GATA3 protein in dominant-negative Ras (dnRas) Tg T cells was significantly lower than that seen in the control, and this is consistent with the observation of impaired Th2 cell differentiation in dnRas Tg mice (11Yamashita M. Kimura M. Kubo M. Shimizu C. Tada T. Perlmutter R.M. Nakayama T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1024-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A specific inhibitor for the p38 MAPK cascade (SB203580) did not affect the GATA3 expression in developing Th2 cells (data not shown). The activation of STAT6 is known to be critical for GATA3 transcription, and as expected, STAT6-deficient (STAT6 KO) CD4 T cells failed to induce GATA3 protein.Fig. 2Activation of the ERK-MAPK cascade controls GATA3 protein expression without inhibiting transcription in developing Th2 cells. A, ERK MAPK- and STAT6-dependent expression of GATA3 protein. Freshly prepared splenic CD4 T cells were stimulated under the indicated conditions for 2 days, and the expression of GATA3 protein in nuclei was assessed. CD4 T cells from T cell-specific dominant-negative H-Ras (dnRas) Tg mice and STAT6-deficient (STAT6 KO) mice were also used. The expression of α-tubulin was assessed as a control. A representative result from one of three independent experiments is shown. Arbitrary densitometric units normalized with α-tubulin bands are shown below each band. B, no effect of inhibition of the ERK-MAPK cascade on the transcriptional up-regulation of GATA3. Splenic CD4 T cells were stimulated under Th2–conditions for 12 and 24 h, and the expression levels of GATA3 mRNA were determined by Northern blot analysis. To examine the role for ERK-MAPK cascade activation, PD98059 (30 μm) and the CD4 T cells from dnRas Tg mice were used. Three independent experiments were performed with similar results. Arbitrary densitometric units are shown below each band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Concurrently, the transcriptional levels of GATA3 in T cells cultured under Th2 conditions (12 and 24 h) as in Fig. 2A were assessed (Fig. 2B). The inhibition of activation of the Ras-ERK MAPK cascade by PD98059 or overexpression of dnRas transgene in T cells had no blocking effect on GATA3 mRNA expression. Rather, significant enhancement of GATA3 levels was detected at the 12-h time point. In contrast, GATA3 mRNA"
https://openalex.org/W2157989648,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a recently identified human coronavirus. The extremely high homology of the viral genomic sequences between the viruses isolated from human (huSARS-CoV) and those of palm civet origin (pcSARS-CoV) suggested possible palm civet-to-human transmission. Genetic analysis revealed that the spike (S) protein of pcSARS-CoV and huSARS-CoV was subjected to the strongest positive selection pressure during transmission, and there were six amino acid residues within the receptor-binding domain of the S protein being potentially important for SARS progression and tropism. Using the single-round infection assay, we found that a two-amino acid substitution (N479K/T487S) of a huSARS-CoV for those of pcSARS-CoV almost abolished its infection of human cells expressing the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 but no effect upon the infection of mouse ACE2 cells. Although single substitution of these two residues had no effects on the infectivity of huSARS-CoV, these recombinant S proteins bound to human ACE2 with different levels of reduced affinity, and the two-amino acid-substituted S protein showed extremely low affinity. On the contrary, substitution of these two amino acid residues of pcSARS-CoV for those of huSRAS-CoV made pcSARS-CoV capable of infecting human ACE2-expressing cells. These results suggest that amino acid residues at position 479 and 487 of the S protein are important determinants for SARS-CoV tropism and animal-to-human transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2098189459,"Signaling by heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) drives numerous cellular processes. The number of G protein molecules activated by a single membrane receptor is a determinant of signal amplification, although in most cases this parameter remains unknown. In retinal rod photoreceptors, a long-lived photoisomerized rhodopsin molecule activates many G protein molecules (transducins), yielding substantial amplification and a large elementary (single-photon) response, before rhodopsin activity is terminated. Here we report that the elementary response in olfactory transduction is extremely small. A ligand-bound odorant receptor has a low probability of activating even one G protein molecule because the odorant dwell-time is very brief. Thus, signal amplification in olfactory transduction appears fundamentally different from that of phototransduction."
https://openalex.org/W1989880616,"Dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) consists of dentin sialoprotein (DSP) and dentin phosphoprotein (DPP). The spatial-temporal expression of DSPP is largely restricted during differentiational stages of dental cells. DSPP plays a vital role in tooth development. It is known that an osteoblast-specific transcription factor, Runx2, is essential for osteoblast differentiation. However, effects of Runx2 on DSPP transcription remain unknown. Here, we studied different roles of Runx2 in controlling DSPP expression in mouse preodontoblast (MD10-F2) and odontoblast (MO6-G3) cells. Two Runx2 isoforms were expressed in preodontoblast and odontoblast cells, and in situ hybridization assay showed that DSPP expression increased, whereas Runx2 was down-regulated during odontoblast differentiation and maturation. Three potential Runx2 sites are present in promoters of mouse and rat DSPP genes. Runx2 binds to these sites as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and supershift experiments. Mutations of Runx2 sites in mouse DSPP promoter resulted in a decline of promoter activity in MD10-F2 cells compared with an increase of its activity in MO6-G3 cells. Multiple Runx2 sites were more active than a single site in regulating the DSPP promoter. Furthermore, forced overexpression of Runx2 isoforms induced increases of endogenous DSPP protein levels in MD10-F2 cells but reduced its expression in MO6-G3 cells consistent with the DSPP promoter analysis. Thus, our results suggest that differential positive and negative regulation of DSPP by Runx2 is dependent on use of cytodifferentiation of dental ectomesenchymal-derived cells that may contribute to the spatial-temporal expression of DSPP during tooth development.

Further sequence analysis of the distal region of the mouse DSPP promoter reveals multiple potential Runx2 consensus motifs (19Chen S. Gu T.T. Sreenath T. Kulkarni A.B. Karsenty G. MacDougall M. Connect. Tissue Res. 2002; 43: 338-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the biological function of these Runx2 binding sites in regulating DSPP expression has not been investigated. Runx2 (also known as Cbfa1, Osf2, til-1, Pebp2aA, or AML-3) is a transcription factor belonging to the Drosophila runt family (20Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3037-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It is essential for osteoblast differentiation and determines the lineage of osteoblasts from mesenchymal cells as well as also regulates many bone- and tooth-related genes (21Kern B. Shen J.

Yoshida C. Liu Y. Himeno M. Narai S. Yamaguchi A. Komori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), suggesting different roles during osteoblast differentiation. For example, Runx2 up- or down-regulates bone sialoprotein (BSP) gene expression in various cell types (22Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar, 23Javed A. Barnes G.L. Jasanya B.O. Stein J.L. Gerstenfeld L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Mol. Cell.

Fedarko N.S. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 44: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Regulation of BSP by Runx2 suggests that Runx2 may be a regulator of DSPP expression. In this study, we demonstrate that Runx2 regulates the mouse DSPP gene expression through its binding sites and sequences of the Runx2 binding sites are conserved with that of rat DSPP promoter. Runx2 up-regulates DSPP gene expression in mouse preodontoblasts and down-regulates its activity in mouse odontoblasts as shown by serial analyses of deletion and point mutations of Runx2 binding sites in the mouse DSPP promoter. Forced overexpression of Runx2 isoforms showed similar results with an increase of endogenous DSPP protein expression in preodontoblast cells with a corresponding decrease of DSPP levels in odontoblast cells. This study shows for the first time that Runx2 has a differential function on DSPP expression during odontoblast cytodifferentiation. Cell Culture—Mouse odontoblast (MO6-G3) and preodontoblast (MD10-F2) cells were isolated from dental papilla mesenchymal cells of the first mandibular molars of Swiss Webster mice at embryonic day 18 (E-18) and established by immortalization using an SV-40 large T antigen vector and the neomycin gene for selection (35MacDougall M. Thiemann F. Ta H. Hsu P. Chen L.S. Snead M.L. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 33: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). MO6-G3 cells show characteristics of a differentiated odontoblast phenotype expressing tooth-related genes, whereas MD10-F2 cells have an undifferentiating dental pulp-like phenotype. These cells were grown at 33 °C under 5% CO2 in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate (Sigma). Plasmid DNA Constructs—All plasmid constructs containing 5′ deletions of the DSPP promoter were generated using standard cloning procedures (36Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moor D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley, New York1995: 15-40Google Scholar). The 2698-bp XbaI-Hind III fragment of the mouse DSPP gene from nucleotides (nt) -2644 to +54 was cloned into the XbaI/Hind III sites of pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and designated pDSPP2.6-luc. The 1501-bp EcoRI-HindIII fragment of the mouse DSPP gene between nt -1447 and +54 was cloned into the EcoRI/HindIII sites of the pGL3-basic vector and called pDSPP1.4-luc. The potential Runx2 binding sites in the mouse DSPP promoter were termed as site 1 (nt -2415 and -2410), site 2 (nt -2409 and -2404), and site 3 (nt -1796 and -1791) (Fig. 4A). For site-directed mutagenesis of the Runx2 sites, seven point mutation DNA constructs were generated by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations in single, double, and triple Runx2 motifs were termed pDSPP2.6mut1-2-3-luc, pDSPP2.6mut1-2wt3-luc, pDSPP2.6mut1wt2mut3-luc, pDSPP2.6wt1mut2-3-luc, pDSPP2.6mut1wt2-3-luc, pDSPP2.6wt1mut2wt3-luc, and pDSPP2.6wt1-2mut3-luc (Table I and Fig. 5C). By using the same method, the above eight different DNA constructs of the mouse DSPP gene promoter were released from pDSPP-luc vectors with appropriate enzymes and subcloned into upstream of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene (Promega) and termed pDSPP-CAT (Fig. 5D). Incorporation of the substitution mutations of the Runx2 sites in all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Table IOligonucleotides used in this study Substitution mutations are represented in lowercase letters.

B, p4OSE2-luc or a mock vector (pGL3-basic vector only) was transfected in MD10-F2 and MO6-G3 cells. C, constructs containing 2.6 kb of the DSPP promoter with or without Runx2 site mutations were cloned upstream of a luciferase gene and transfected into MD10-F2 and MO6-G3 cells. 48 h after the start of transfection, luciferase activity was measured with the Promega dual-Luciferase reporter assay system as indicated by the manufacturer. The value (ratio between firefly and Renilla luciferase) was obtained from the control group (pGL3-basic vector only) and taken as 1-fold. The -fold luciferase activity was calculated by dividing the individual value by the control group value. The data show the mean ± S.E. from at least five separate experiments performed in triplicate. D, representative CAT autoradiogram of the mouse DSPP gene promoter. The same DNA constructs from C containing 2.6 kb of the DSPP promoter with or without Runx2 site mutations were released from pDSPP-luc vectors and subcloned into CAT-basic vector. The pDSPP-CAT constructs were transiently transfected into MO6-G3 and MD10-F2 cells, respectively. After a 48-h transfection, CAT assay was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data were representative from one of three experiments each yielding similar results. The Runx2 sites are between nt -2415 and -2410 (1), nt -2409 and -2404 (2), and nt -1796 and -1791 (3). Mutant Runx2 sites are shown by an oval with cross lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Runx2/Osf2 (type II) isoform expression construct was a kind gift from Dr. Gerard Karsenty (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). The cDNA of the Runx2/Pebp2αA (type I) isoform subcloned into the bluescript vector was generously provided by Dr. Yoshiaki Ito (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). For the generation of the expression construct, cDNA of type I in the Bluescript vector was digested with XhoI and XbaI and then subcloned into the XhoI and XbaI sites of the pcDNA 3.1 vector (Invitrogen). Four tandem copies of the Runx2 binding site (OSE2) from the mouse osteocalcin gene promoter (22Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar) containing the KpnI and XhoI sites at their 5′-ends was synthesized and subcloned into the KpnI and XhoI sites of the pGL-3 basic vector and named p4OSE2-luc. This p4OSE2-luc construct was kindly provided by Dr. Narayanasamy Elango (Audie L. Murphy Memorial Veterans Hospital, San Antonio, TX). Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from MO6-G3 and MD10-F2 cells. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and PCR amplification were performed using standard protocols (36Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moor D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley, New York1995: 15-40Google Scholar). The PCR conditions for the detection of each Runx2 isoform were described previously (19Chen S. Gu T.T. Sreenath T. Kulkarni A.B. Karsenty G. MacDougall M. Connect. Tissue Res. 2002; 43: 338-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the detection of mouse DSPP expression, the following primer set was used (5MacDougall M. Simmons D. Luan X. Nydegger J. Feng J. Gu T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 835-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar): sense, 5′-CCAAAGAATCTGGGAAACTC-3′; antisense, 5′-AAGAAGCATCTCACGC-3′. The cycling parameters were: 94 °C for 4 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. As an internal control, a PCR analysis was performed with β-actin-specific primers for 20 cycles using two primers: sense, 5′-CATCACTATTGGCAACGAGC-3′; antisense, 5′-ACTCATCGTACTCCTGCTTG-3′ (37Harada H.

For quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), amplification reactions were analyzed in real-time on an ABI 7500 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using SYBR Green chemistry, and the threshold values were calculated using SDS2 software (Applied Biosystems) as described earlier (38Chen S. Santos L. Wu Y. Vuong R. Gay I. Schulze J. Chuang H.H. Macdougall M. Arch. Oral Biol. 2005; 50: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The primer sequences used for qRT-PCR were as follows: cyclophilin (sense, 5′-GGTGACTTCACACGCCATAA-3′; antisense, 5′-CATGGCCTCCACAATATTCA-3′); dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) (sense, 5′-GGGAGCCAGAGAGGGTAGAG-3′; antisense, 5′-CCTCTGGGCTAGCTTGACTTT-3′); matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) (sense, 5′-GATGCAGGCTGTGTCTGTTG-3′; antisense, 5′-GCAGGCTCCTGTCTTCAT-3′); DSPP (sense, 5′-AACTCTGTGGCTGTGCCTCT-3′; antisense, 5′-TATTGACTCGGAGCCATTCC-3′); BSP (sense, 5′-AGTTAGCGGCACTCCAACTG-3′; antisense, 5′-TCCTCTGCTTCGGCTTCTT-3′); osteopontin (sense, 5′-CCCGGTGAAAGTGACGATT-3′; antisense, 5′-ATGGCTTTCATTGGAATTGC-3′); alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (5′-CGGGACTGGTACTCGGATAA-3′; antisense, 5′-TGAGATCCAGGCCATGTAGC-3′); collagen type 1α1 (sense, 5′-CCCCGGTCAGAGAGGAGAAA-3′; antisense, 5′-TCCAGAAGGACCTTGTTTGC-3′); osteocalcin (5′-CTTGGTGCACACCTAGCAGA-3′; antisense, 5′-ACCTTCTTGCCCTCCTGCTT-3′); and osteonectin (sense, 5′-AAACATGGCAAGGTGTGTGA-3′; antisense, 5′-TTGCATGGTCCGATGTAGTC-3′). In Situ Hybridization—Preparation of probes and details of the in situ hybridization procedures were performed as described earlier (19Chen S. Gu T.T. Sreenath T. Kulkarni A.B. Karsenty G. MacDougall M. Connect. Tissue Res. 2002; 43: 338-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse Runx2 probe containing common coding region of the type I and II isoforms was a 234-bp fragment from nucleotide positions +17 to +251 (22Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—MO6-G3 cells were grown and harvested after confluency. Nuclear extracts were prepared using the methods of Dignam et al. (39Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). For EMSA, oligonucleotides representing the wild type and mutant Runx2 binding sites in the mouse DSPP promoter as well as the OSE2 site shown in Table I were synthesized. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. EMSA was performed as described before (22Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). For competition binding reactions, the unlabeled competitor in 100- and 200-fold molar excess of the labeled probe was used in the reaction. After incubation, the reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 5% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-boric acid-EDTA, electrophoresed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. For antibody supershift experiments, 1 μl of anti-Runx2 antiserum (kindly provided by Dr. Gerard Karsenty) was added to the reaction mixture for 20 min prior to the addition of radiolabeled probe. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed on whole cell lysates from MO6-G3 and MD10-F2 cells with or without transiently transfected Runx2 isoform expression plasmids. For each construct, cells in 35-mm-diameter dishes were transfected with 2 μg of either empty pcDNA 3.1 or a Runx2 isoform expression plasmid. After 48 h, cells were washed with 1× PBS and lysed with RIPA buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mg/ml phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μl/ml aprotinin, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Proteins (50 μg/well) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Trans-Blot membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratory, Inc., Hercules, CA). For the detection of mouse DSPP protein, Western blotting assay was performed as described earlier (41Chen S. Unterbrink A. Kadapakkam S. Dong J. Gu T.T. Dickson J. Chuang H.H. MacDougall M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42182-42191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As a control, goat anti-mouse actin antibody was used (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Immunohistochemistry—Mouse MO6-G3 cells were cultured on glass slides for 3 days, rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, and fixed for 10 min on ice with 4% formaldehyde. After washing once with 1× PBS, the cells were made permeable by incubation for 20 min on ice with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Slides were blocked with α-minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 10% normal goat serum for 45 min at 37 °C, and then washed 3× for 2 min with PBS-containing serum. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with the appropriate dilution (1:250) of primary anti-Runx2 antibody and washed 3× for 5 min with PBS containing 0.1% goat serum, followed by an incubation with a 1:500 dilution of the secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody) for 1 h at 37 °C. Excess secondary antibody was removed by washing the cells three times with PBS. The cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (0.1% 4′,6-diamidino-2-pheylindole, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 5 min on ice followed by a single rinse with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and mounted using Vectashied (Vector Laboratory, Inc., Burlingame, CA). The cells were viewed with a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Germany) equipped with a Sony video capturing system and photographed with a 35-mm camera using a TMS-F inverted microscope. For quantitative detection of expression of collagenous and non-collagenous proteins in both MO6-G3 and MD10-F2 cells, fluorescent immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies directed against mouse DSP and DMP1 (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX), MEPE (kindly provided by Dr. Peter Rowe, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, TX), BSP (a gift from Dr. Larry Fisher, NIDCR), osteopontin, ALP, osteonectin, and collagen type 1α1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Negative control of mouse IgG 1 was purchased from Dakocytomation (Carpinteria, CA). The samples were incubated for overnight at 4 °C with a 1:100 dilution of primary antibodies and then washed with 1× PBS, followed by the secondary antibodies with Alexa Fluo® 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Images of Alexa Fluo® 488 staining of the various proteins in cultures were obtained at the Core Optical Imaging Facility at University of Texas Health Science Center under the same parameters in an Olympus wide field microscope and quantitated by means of MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). For each experiment, all sides were simultaneously processed for a specific antibody, so that homogeneity in the staining procedure was ensured between the samples. After capture of the images at the same magnification, the threshold was set and maintained for each slide in the experiment. The optical density was calculated by use of the morphometric analysis within the software package. DNA Transfection and Promoter Activity—For each transfection experiment, MO6-G3 and MD10-F2 cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/35-mm diameter dishes and underwent transfection 18 h later with reporter plasmid DNA, the effector plasmid (pCMV-Runx2 isoform or pcDNA 3.1 (mock)) and pRL-TK (Promega) using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) as specified by the manufacturer. Three hours after the start of transfection, serum-free DNA containing medium was replaced by fresh growth medium with 20% serum. Measurement of luciferase activity was performed as described earlier (7Feng J.Q. Luan X. Wallace J. Jing D. Ohshima T. Kulkarni A.B. D'Souza R.N. Kozak C.A. MacDougall M. J. Biol.

The compressional-wave velocities (VP) and shear-wave velocities (VS) of hcp-Fe decreased significantly with increasing temperature under moderately high pressures. VP and VS under high pressures and temperatures thus cannot be fitted to a linear relation, Birch's law, which has been used to extrapolate measured sound velocities to densities of iron in Earth's interior. This result means that there are more light elements in Earth's core than have been inferred from linear extrapolation at room temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2032966916,"We showed recently that the human T-lymphotropic virus, type 1 (HTLV-1), spreads directly from cell to cell via a virological synapse. The HTLV-1 virological synapse resembles the immunological synapse; each is a specialized contact between a lymphocyte and another cell that contains organized protein microdomains, and each involves repolarization of the T-cell microtubule cytoskeleton. However, formation of the virological synapse is not triggered by T-cell receptor-mediated antigen recognition. On the basis of our previous data, we postulated that formation of the viral synapse was triggered by a conjunction of two signals, one from HTLV-1 infection of the T-cell and one from cell-cell contact. We have recently identified ICAM-1 engagement as a cell-contact signal that causes the microtubule polarization associated with the virological synapse. Here we used confocal microscopy of T-lymphocytes naturally infected with HTLV-1 or transfected with individual HTLV-1 genes to investigate the role of the viral transcriptional transactivator protein Tax. Polarization of the microtubules was induced by cell-cell contact or by cross-linking T-cell surface molecules with monoclonal antibodies adsorbed to latex beads. We show that Tax, which is mainly found in the nucleus, is also present at two specific extranuclear sites as follows: around the microtubule organizing center in association with the cis-Golgi and in the cell-cell contact region. We show that expression of Tax provides an intracellular signal that synergizes with ICAM-1 engagement to cause the T-cell microtubule polarization observed at the virological synapse.

Naturally infected lymphocytes produce virtually no cell-free infectious HTLV-1 in vivo, and cell contact is required for efficient transmission of HTLV-1 between cells and between individuals. It has been shown recently that when an HTLV-1-infected T-cell meets an uninfected T-cell, the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) of the infected cell becomes polarized toward the uninfected cell. Complexes of HTLV-1 core (Gag) and the RNA genome of the virus accumulate at the point of cell contact and are then transferred to the uninfected cell (1Igakura T. Stinchcombe J.C. Goon P.K. Taylor G.P. Weber J.N. Griffiths G.M. Tanaka Y. Osame M. Bangham C.R. Science. 2003; 299: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The establishment and maintenance of cell polarity is an essential feature of all eukaryotic cells, both during development and in the adult. In migrating adherent cells such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells, the MTOC reorients toward the leading edge of a wounded monolayer (2Gundersen G.G. Bulinski J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5946-5950Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 3Gotlieb A.I. Subrahmanyan L. Kalnins V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Migrating macrophages also localize their MTOC in a position between the nucleus and the leading edge of the cell. A similar reorientation of the MTOC occurs in CD4+ T-cells directed toward an antigen-presenting cell that carries the cognate antigen peptide (4Kupfer A. Swain S.L. Singer S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1565-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and in natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes when they interact with their respective target cells (5Kupfer A. Dennert G. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7224-7228Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 6Geiger B. Rosen D. Berke G. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The MTOC of the responding lymphocyte reorients toward the cell-cell contact region, where these interactions occur. This reorientation occurs rapidly, and the reorienting MTOC may be accompanied by other components or organelles, such as the Golgi apparatus (5Kupfer A. Dennert G. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7224-7228Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has revealed that the small GTPase Cdc42 is an essential regulator of cell polarity (7Johnson D.I. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Cdc42 has also been shown to regulate polarity in mammalian cells. For example, inhibition of Cdc42 prevents the following: (i) the reorientation of the MTOC in T-cells in response to an antigen-presenting cell (8Stowers L. Yelon D. Berg L.J. Chant J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5027-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar); (ii) the directional movement of macrophages toward a chemotactic signal (9Allen W.E. Zicha D. Ridley A.J. Jones G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar); (iii) the directional movement and the reorientation of the Golgi of fibroblasts in an in vitro wound assay (10Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar); and (iv) polarized basolateral secretion/endocytosis in the epithelial cell line (Madin-Darby canine kidney cells) (11Kroschewski R. Hall A. Mellman I. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). By having established the effect of cell contact on the orientation of the HTLV-1-infected MTOC of the T-cell and the distribution of the HTLV-1 Gag protein (1Igakura T. Stinchcombe J.C. Goon P.K. Taylor G.P. Weber J.N. Griffiths G.M. Tanaka Y. Osame M. Bangham C.R. Science. 2003; 299: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), we wished to study the intracellular distribution of the HTLV-1 transcriptional activator protein (Tax) and its possible role in the formation of the virological synapse. Tax is among the first HTLV-1 proteins to be translated in ex vivo cultured cells (12Hanon E. Hall S. Taylor G.P. Saito M. Davis R. Tanaka Y. Usuku K. Osame M. Weber J.N. Bangham C.R. Blood. 2000; 95: 1386-1392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been well established that the HTLV-1 Tax protein plays a critical role in cellular transformation (13Grassmann R. Berchtold S. Radant I. Alt M. Fleckenstein B. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Ramstedt U. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4570-4575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Jeang K.T. Giam C.Z. Majone F. Aboud M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31991-31994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Tax not only activates the expression of HTLV-1 genes through the viral long terminal repeat, but also stimulates the transcription of a number of cellular genes through cellular signaling pathways of NF-κB, CREB, serum-response factor, and AP-1. Tax does not bind to promoter or enhancer sequences by itself but by interacting with a number of transcription factor families, including NF-κB, cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein/activated transcription factor, and the CREB-binding protein CBP/p300 to stimulate the transcription from the respective promoters. Tax protein has been shown to be a major target of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vivo (15Jacobson S. Shida H. McFarlin D.E. Fauci A.S. Koenig S. Nature. 1990; 348: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 16Kannagi M. Harada S. Maruyama I. Inoko H. Igarashi H. Kuwashima G. Sato S. Morita M. Kidokoro M. Sugimoto M. Int.

Infect. Dis. 2004; 189: 2294-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Depletion of CD8+ T-lymphocytes from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HTLV-1-infected individuals in vitro promoted Tax expression in the CD4+ subpopulation, suggesting that CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes suppress Tax expression in vivo (12Hanon E. Hall S. Taylor G.P. Saito M. Davis R. Tanaka Y. Usuku K. Osame M. Weber J.N. Bangham C.R. Blood. 2000; 95: 1386-1392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of cell-cell contact on the intracellular distribution of Tax protein, and to test the hypothesis that Tax protein is sufficient to account for the strong polarization of the MTOC associated with the HTLV-1 virological synapse. We report that Tax protein is present not only in the nucleus of infected cells (18Bex F. McDowall A. Burny A. Gaynor R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3484-3497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6347-6357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but also in two extranuclear sites as follows: around the MTOC in close association with the cis-Golgi compartments and in the cell-cell contact region. Reorientation of the MTOC is always accompanied by Tax protein reorientation in the same direction. This MTOC/Tax polarization is dependent on the integrity of the cytoskeleton and on the function of the Rac family and Cdc42 small GTPases. Tax protein expression is sufficient to induce the polarization of the MTOC toward the target cell. The results suggest a previously unidentified role for Tax protein in promoting cell to cell spread of HTLV-1. Antibodies and Reagents—To detect HTLV-1 proteins in infected cells, we used the mouse IgG3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against HTLV-1 Tax protein (Lt-4) (20Tanaka Y. Masuda M. Yoshida A. Shida H. Nyunoya H. Shimotohno K. Tozawa H. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1992; 8: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and the mouse IgG2b mAb directed against HTLV-1 Gag p19 (Gin7) (21Tanaka Y. Lee B. Inoi T. Tozawa H. Yamamoto N. Hinuma Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1986; 37: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The microtubule network was stained with the anti-β-tubulin (CY 3-conjugated) mAb TUB2.1 obtained from Sigma. The Golgi apparatus was detected with the mouse IgG1 mAb anti-GM130 (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-giantin polyclonal antibody (CRP Inc.; Cambridge Bioscience Ltd., Cambridge, UK), or with anti-ERGIC53 mAb (22Schweizer A. Fransen J.A. Bachi T. Ginsel L. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) a gift from Hans-Peter Hauri (Basel, Switzerland). Alexa fluorophores (488, 564, and 645 nm) conjugated to isotype-specific antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. Antibodies used to coat the latex beads were as follows: anti-CD54 (ICAM-1), clone HA58 (Research Diagnostics Inc.) and anti-CD11a, clone 38 (mouse IgG2a). The nucleus was stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyindole, dilactate (DAPI; Sigma). To gain further insight into the biochemical pathways that control microtubule polarization, we used a number of agents to treat infected cells. Nocodazole, latrunculin B, brefeldin A, and lithium chloride (an inhibitor of GSK-3, which inhibits MTOC polarization) were purchased from Sigma and were used at a final concentration of 10, 5, and 15 μm and 20 mm, respectively. Toxin B (Clostridium difficile) is a high molecular weight glucosyltransferase that inhibits small GTPases such as Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 by glycosylation of a threonine residue; exoenzyme C3 (Clostridium botulinum) inhibits Rho GTPases by catalyzing the ribosylation of Asn-14; and GF109203X, a cell-permeable inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), shows high selectivity for PKCα,-βI, -βII, -γ,-δ, and -ϵ isozymes. These drugs were purchased from Calbiochem and were used at a final concentration of 0.4 pm, 0.2 μm, and 20 μm, respectively (23Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2003; 421: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Naturally Infected T Cells and Cell Lines—PBMCs were obtained from HTLV-1-seropositive and -associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis patients with a high proviral load attending the National Centre for Human Retrovirology at St. Mary's Hospital, London, UK. All patients gave informed consent. The HTLV-1-immortalized cell line MS-9 was a kind gift from Dr. David Derse, NCI, National Institutes of Health. MS-9 cells were derived by co-culture of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-activated human PBMCs with DBS-FRhL (clone B5) cells that were infected with the HTLV-1 molecular clone, pHTLV-X1MT (24Shuh M. Hill S.A. Derse D. Virology. 1999; 262: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). MS-9 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 IU/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), 100 IU/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories Ltd., Somerset, UK), and 100 units/ml recombinant interleukin 2 (Sigma). Jurkat cells (clone E6.1) were obtained from ATCC, Middlesex, UK. Jurkat E6.1 is a clone of the Jurkat-FHCRC cell line, a derivative of the Jurkat cell line (25Weiss A. Wiskocil R.L. Stobo J.D. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 123-128PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation of CD4+ T Cells—PBMCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation on Histopaque-1077 (Sigma), washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and washed once in PBS, 10% fetal calf serum. CD4+ cells were negatively selected from the PBMCs by using the CD4+ T-cell isolation kit from Miltenyi Biotech, Surrey, UK, following the manufacturer's instructions. This procedure yielded CD4+ cells at a purity of greater than 95%, ascertained by flow cytometry (data not shown). Before use, the isolated CD4+ T-cells were cultured overnight in 10-cm diameter tissue culture dishes (106 cells/ml) to allow spontaneous expression of HTLV-1 proteins (12Hanon E. Hall S. Taylor G.P. Saito M. Davis R. Tanaka Y. Usuku K. Osame M. Weber J.N. Bangham C.R. Blood. 2000; 95: 1386-1392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During this incubation, the cells were widely dispersed to minimize cell-cell contact. T-cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 IU/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), 100 IU/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories Ltd., Somerset, UK). Immobilization of Antibodies on Latex Beads—For each antibody, 80 × 106 surfactant-free sulfate white latex 5-μm beads (Interfacial Dynamics Corp., Portland, OR) were washed twice in 10 ml of 0.025 m MES buffer, pH 6.1 (Sigma). The beads were centrifuged for 20 min at 3000 × g and resuspended in 1 ml of the MES buffer. One hundred μg of the respective antibody was added in a 15-ml centrifuge tube and incubated overnight at room temperature on a roller, with constant mixing. The beads were then washed twice in 10 ml of PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin. The antibody-coated beads were stored at 4 °C. Flow cytometric analysis was used to verify that the beads were labeled with antibody (results not shown). Conjugate Formation and Analysis of MTOC Polarization—To form cell-cell conjugates (or cell-bead conjugates), 5 × 104 cells were placed in each well (6 mm diameter) of a 10-well glass slide (VWR Scientific, Magma Park, Lutterworth, UK). The slides were treated for 5 min at room temperature with 50 μl/well of 100 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and then left to dry before use. The cells were left to adhere for 30 min at 37 °C, and then 105 cells or 105 antibody-coated beads were added to the adherent cells at a ratio of 2:1 (2 cells or beads added to 1 adherent cell). The conjugate formation was left to occur for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature, and immunofluorescence staining was performed as described below. Cell-bead conjugates were first identified by differential interference contrast using a Laborlux 12 Leitz fluorescent microscope equipped with a water-based objective (×50/1.0). Between 50 and 100 events were counted per condition per experiment. T-cells were scored as conjugates where the infected cell was not in contact with another cell and where there was only one point of contact between the cell and a bead. We considered that the MTOC and Tax protein were polarized when their orientation to the beads was located within a quarter of the cell circumference. Plasmids and Transfection—For transient transfections, Jurkat cells (clone E6.1) were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA using a Nucleofector™ device (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's optimized protocol for Jurkat cells (program S-18). Jurkat cells were transfected with the full-length tax gene in the pJFE-tax plasmid (26Lomas M. Hanon E. Tanaka Y. Bangham C.R. Gould K.G. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), in which the gene was under the control of the SRα promoter, or with the Tax mutant M47. This mutant was obtained by the substitution of two amino acids near the COOH-terminal end (L319R, L320S). Tax (M47) is a nonfunctional mutant, it has been demonstrated previously to abrogate selectively the ability of Tax to activate transcription through CREB/activated transcription factor pathway (27Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) (28Robek M.D. Ratner L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4856-4865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acids substitution was introduced into Tax-GFP template using the QuickChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, California), according to the manufacturer instructions, and was verified by DNA sequencing (data not shown). ICAM-1 Blocking Peptide cLAB.L—Jurkat cells transfected with Tax protein (2.5 × 106/ml) were washed in serum-free RPMI and were incubated with 200 μm of cLAB.L peptide at 37 °C for 30 min (29Yusuf-Makagiansar H. Makagiansar I.T. Hu Y. Siahaan T.J. Peptides (Elmsford). 2001; 22: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice in RPMI serum-free medium to eliminate the excess peptide; then unblocked Jurkat cells were added, and conjugates were allowed to form for 30 min at 37 °C. Indirect Immunofluorescence Staining for Confocal Microscopy— HTLV-1-infected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. For intracellular immunofluorescene staining, cells were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and then were incubated with 5 μg/ml of the primary antibodies (anti-Tax, anti-Gag p19, or anti-GM130) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by incubation with 1 μg of the respective secondary antibody Alexa-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG3, IgG2a, or IgG1) for 30 min at 37 °C. The antibodies were applied sequentially, and the cells were washed three times between each step with PBS containing 50 mm NH4Cl. The nucleus of the cell was stained with 5 μg/ml DAPI for 5 min at room temperature and then washed twice with PBS containing 50 mm NH4Cl. After the last wash, cells were mounted with Glycergel (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA). Confocal microscopy analysis was carried out using the Zeiss Pascal LSM confocal imaging system (Zeiss, Heidelberg, Germany), equipped with a 63×/1.4 oil objective. A krypton-argon mixed gas laser was used to generate three bands: 488 nm for Alexa-488 (fluorescein isothiocyanate), 568 nm for Alexa-568 (TRITC or CY3), or 645 nm for Alexa-645 (CY5); and a UV laser was used to detect DAPI staining. Multichannel acquisition was used to avoid cross-talk between the respective channels. The signal was treated with line averaging to integrate the signal collected over four lines in order to reduce noise. The pinhole was adjusted to allow a field depth of about 0.5 μm, corresponding to the increment between two adjacent sections. Image processing was performed with the on-line LSM 5 image browser (Zeiss, Heidelberg, Germany). Numeric images were transferred to a computer equipped with an image analysis station (Scion image and Photoshop 7.0). Statistical Analysis—The frequency of MTOC polarization in HTLV-1-infected and uninfected cells was compared by using the odds ratio (OR). To test whether a given OR differed significantly from 1.0, and to compare two different odds ratios, we applied normal theory to the distribution of ln(OR), the natural logarithm of the OR (30Armitage P. Berry G. Matthews J.N.S. Statistical Methods in Medical Research, 4th Ed. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, UK2002: 215-218Google Scholar). To calculate the summary odds ratio for a given effect over a number of experiments, we used the inverse variance method of weighting individual values of ln(OR) (30Armitage P. Berry G. Matthews J.N.S. Statistical Methods in Medical Research, 4th Ed. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, UK2002: 215-218Google Scholar). To calculate the statistical significance of a given effect over different experiments, we used Fisher's χ2 method of combining probabilities as shown in Equation 1,χ2=−2∑i=1kln(pi)(eq.1) where pi is the significance level obtained from the ith experiment, and k is the number of experiments. -2Σln(pi) is distributed as a χ2 variant with 2k degrees of freedom (31Sokal R.R. Rohlf F.J. Biometry. 3rd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York2004: 794-797Google Scholar). In Naturally Infected T Cells, a Substantial Fraction of HTLV-1 Tax Protein Was Extranuclear and Colocalized with the MTOC—In isolated T-cells from HTLV-1-infected subjects, Tax protein was mostly expressed in the nucleus of CD4+-infected T-cells (Fig. 1A). However, a significant fraction of Tax protein was present outside the nucleus (Fig. 1). A rotatable three-dimensional view of Fig. 1, A-C, showed the extranuclear fraction of Tax protein (supplemental data Fig. S1). The superposition (in yellow) of Tax protein staining in green (Fig. 1A) and microtubule network staining in red (Fig. 1B) showed that the extranuclear fraction of Tax protein lay adjacent to the MTOC in infected T-cells (Fig. 1C). Digital zooming on single cells confirmed the juxtaposition of extranuclear HTLV-1 Tax protein and the MTOC (Fig. 1D). This result was confirmed by staining the nucleus of HTLV-1-infected MS9 cells (continuous cell line) with DAPI (supplemental data Fig. S2). Fig. S2 demonstrated the presence of Tax protein outside the nucleus and around the MTOC. We then investigated the distribution of HTLV-1 Tax protein in comparison to Gag p19 complexes in CD4+ T-cell conjugates. The conjugates were formed spontaneously between autologous PBMCs from HTLV-1-positive individuals, as described previously (1Igakura T. Stinchcombe J.C. Goon P.K. Taylor G.P. Weber J.N. Griffiths G.M. Tanaka Y. Osame M. Bangham C.R. Science. 2003; 299: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). During the cell-cell contact both Gag p19 complexes and Tax protein were found at the cell-cell junction and around the MTOC (Fig. 2). In both cases the MTOC was oriented toward the uninfected T-cell (Fig. 2, B-D). We have never seen Tax protein be transmitted to the uninfected target cell, in contrast to the regular transmission of Gag p19 complexes (1Igakura T. Stinchcombe J.C. Goon P.K. Taylor G.P. Weber J.N. Griffiths G.M. Tanaka Y. Osame M. Bangham C.R. Science. 2003; 299: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). 2M. Nejmeddine, A. L. Barnard, and C. R. M. Bangham, unpublished data. To test whether the distribution of Tax protein in infected cells is modified in the absence of virus replication, Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with pJFE-Tax DNA plasmid. The expression of Tax protein was found to be maximal 24 h after the transfection; at this time Jurkat cells were fixed and permeabilized and then submitted to immunofluorescence staining with the anti-Tax protein monoclonal antibody (Lt-4) and with anti-β-tubulin. Tax protein was expressed in 20-30% of the transfected cell population as detected by the specific monoclonal antibody (Lt-4). The results (Fig. 3) showed that in both transfected Jurkat cells (Fig. 3C) and the HTLV-1-infected cell line (MS9) (Fig. 3A), Tax protein followed a pattern similar to that observed in CD4+ T-cells naturally infected with HTLV-1 (Figs. 1 and 2). Indeed, Tax protein within the cytoplasm was distributed around the MTOC and in the cell-cell contact region of spontaneous cell-cell conjugates. Tax Protein Subcellular Localization Coincided with Golgi Stacks—We showed above that there is a strong spatial association between the MTOC and Tax protein within the cytoplasm in both infected and transfected cells. Furthermore, the Tax protein pattern and localization revealed by immunofluorescence staining suggested that Tax protein is associated with large vesicular structures similar to the Golgi compartments present in the proximity of the MTOC. To test whether Tax indeed colocalizes with a Golgi compartment, we performed a triple immunofluorescence staining of the Tax protein, the microtubules, and the Golgi compartments in naturally infected CD4+ T-cells, using the anti-Tax mAb (Lt-4), the anti-β-tubulin mAb, and several Golgi markers, respectively (Fig. 4). The Golgi was stained with antibodies directed against the Golgi matrix protein 130 (GM130), or the Giantin protein, or the ERGIC53 protein, which is an endoplasmic reticulum intermediate Golgi marker. To analyze the colocalization between Tax protein and the Golgi stacks, we compared the images corresponding to the superposition of Tax and Golgi staining obtained in the same confocal sections. The results are shown in Fig. 4. We found a partial colocalization between HTLV-1 Tax protein and the Golgi complex (Fig. 4, top panel). The anti-Giantin and the anti-ERGIC53 staining were also found to coincide with Tax protein staining (data not shown). These antibodies have the common feature of recognizing the cis-Golgi compartments. The juxtaposition between HTLV-1 Tax protein and the Golgi was observed both in naturally infected cells (Fig. 4, top panel) and in the HTLV-1-infected cell line MS9 (data not shown). The treatment of naturally infected cells with nocodazole (Fig. 4, middle row) or brefeldin A (Fig. 4, bottom row) resulted in fragmentation of the Golgi complex to multivesicular structures dispersed within the cytoplasm. Despite the dispersal of the Golgi complex, Tax protein remained adjacent to the fragmented Golgi stacks. The same observation was made in the presence of brefeldin A. These results confirmed that Tax protein was strongly associated with the Golgi complex. MTOC and Tax Protein Were Both Polarized toward the Cell-Cell Contact Region—As described previously (1Igakura T. Stinchcombe J.C. Goon P.K. Taylor G.P. Weber J.N. Griffiths G.M. Tanaka Y. Osame M. Bangham C.R. Science. 2003; 299: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), we observed that the MTOC in HTLV-1-infected cells was oriented preferentially toward the uninfected cell. This MTOC polarization was always accompanied by Tax protein polarization in the same direction. MTOC polarization can be artificially induced by cross-linking specific T-cell surf"

SNAREs are the core constituents of the protein machinery responsible for synaptic membrane fusion. The mechanism by which SNAREs drive membrane fusion is thought to involve a hemifusion intermediate, a condition in which the outer leaflets of two bilayers are combined and the inner leaflets remain intact; however, hemifusion has been observed only as an end point rather than as an intermediate. Here, we examined the kinetics of membrane fusion of liposomes mediated by recombinant neuronal SNAREs using fluorescence assays that monitor both total lipid mixing and inner leaflet mixing. Our results demonstrate that hemifusion is dominant at the early stage of the fusion reaction. Over time, hemifusion transitioned to complete fusion, showing that hemifusion is a true intermediate. We also show that hemifusion intermediates can be trapped, likely as unproductive outcomes, by modulating the surface concentration of the SNARE proteins.

It has been proposed that SNAREs involved in neurotransmitter release at synapses may promote membrane fusion by the formation of two juxtaposed transmembrane pores preassembled by the transmembrane domains of SNAREs in respective membranes (10Han X. Wang C.T. Bai J. Chapman E.R. Jackson M.B. Science. 2004; 304: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, recent evidence for SNAREs involved in trafficking in yeast has indicated that hemifusion might be involved in the SNARE fusion pathway (11Chernomordik L.V. Vogel S.S. Sokoloff A.

However, hemifusion has been observed only as an outcome rather than as an intermediate, raising some concerns as to whether hemifusion is an off-pathway product in SNARE-mediated membrane fusion (16Chernomordik L.V. Kozlov M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 175-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the mechanism by which neuronal SNAREs induce membrane fusion might be entirely different from those for other systems including yeast SNAREs. In this work, we examined the kinetics of membrane fusion of liposomes mediated by neuronal SNAREs syntaxin 1A, SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin using fluorescence assays (18McNew J.A. Parlati F. Fukuda R. Johnston R.J. Paz K. Paumet F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 2000; 407: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) that monitored both total lipid mixing and inner leaflet mixing. Our results demonstrate that hemifusion is the main event at the early stage of the fusion reaction. Over time, hemifusion converts to the complete fusion, supporting strongly the theory that hemifusion is a true fusion intermediate. Protein Sample Preparation—Plasmid construction, protein expression, and purification for neuronal SNAREs were described elsewhere (19Kweon D.H. Kim C.S. Shin Y.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, vesicle-associated (v-) SNARE synaptobrevin (amino acids 1-116) and a truncated version of target membrane (t-) SNARE syntaxin (amino acids 168-288), for which the N-terminal α-helical Habc domain was deleted, were expressed as N-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. Another t-SNARE, SNAP-25, was also expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in which the four cysteines were replaced with alanines. Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS (Novagene). Glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). The protein was cleaved by thrombin in cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). We added 1% OG for syntaxin and synaptobrevin). Purified proteins were examined with 15% SDS-PAGE, and the purity was at least 90% for all of the proteins (data not shown). Membrane Reconstitution—The mixture of POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine) and DOPS (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserine) (molar ratio of 65:35) in chloroform was dried in a vacuum and was resuspended in a buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) to make the total lipid concentration about 50 mm. Protein-free large unilamellar liposomes (∼100 nm in diameter) were prepared by extrusion through polycarbonate filters (Avanti Polar Lipids). Syntaxin (480 μl, 21 μm) and SNAP-25 (630 μl, 16 μm) were mixed at room temperature for about 60 min to allow the formation of t-SNAREs. The preformed t-SNAREs were concentrated down to 90 μl using a 5-kDa cutoff centrifugal filter (Millipore) and were mixed with 10 μl of liposomes for about 15 min at room temperature, resulting in a 50:1 lipid/protein molar ratio. The fluorescent liposomes containing POPC, DOPS, NBD-PS (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine-N-(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)), and rhodamine-PE (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)) in the molar ratio of 62:35:1.5:1.5 were prepared following the procedure described above, and the final lipid concentration was ∼10 mm. Synaptobrevin (80 μl, 50 μm) was mixed with 20 μl of fluorescent liposomes for about 15 min at room temperature. The liposome/protein mixture was diluted two times, which makes the concentration of OG below the critical micelle concentration. After dialyzing against 2 liters of dialysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 5% (w/v) glycerin, pH 7.4) at 4 °C overnight to remove detergent, the sample was treated with Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad) to get rid of any remaining trace amount of detergent. The solution was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g to remove protein and lipid aggregates. The final t-SNAREs liposome solution contained ∼2.5 mm lipids and 1.9 mg/ml protein, and the v-SNARE liposome solution contained ∼1 mm lipids and 0.25 mg/ml protein. The integrity and size of SNARE-reconstituted liposomes were examined with negative staining electron microscopy. The sample was stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid, pH 6.7, after the liposome sample was spread on the 200-mesh Formvar with the carbon-coated grids. The micrograph was taken on a JEOL 1200 EX electron microscope. The reconstitution efficiency was determined using SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The amount of protein in liposomes was estimated by comparing the band in the gel with that of the same protein of known concentration. The reconstitution efficiency was more than 90% for both t- and v-SNAREs (Fig. 1B). The orientation of the SNAREs in the liposomes was examined with the trypsin digestion experiments (19Kweon D.H. Kim C.S. Shin Y.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The SNAREs-reconstituted vesicles were treated with trypsin (0.5 mg/ml) under room temperature for 1 h. Nearly all SNARE proteins were digested by trypsin, indicating that SNARE molecules are oriented inside out, exposing the soluble domain to the solution phase (Fig. 1B). Total Lipid Mixing Fluorescence Assay—To measure the lipid mixing, v-SNARE liposomes were mixed with t-SNARE liposomes in the ratio of 1:9. The final solution contained ∼1 mm lipids with a total volume of 100 μl. Fluorescence was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 465 and 530 nm, respectively. Fluorescence changes were recorded with a Varian Cary Eclipse model fluorescence spectrophotometer using a quartz cell of 100 μl with a 2-mm path length. The maximum fluorescence intensity (MFI) was obtained by adding 0.2% n-dodecylmaltoside. All of the lipid mixing experiments were carried out at 35 °C. For each lipid/protein (L/P) ratio, the experiments were performed at least three times with newly prepared samples. To make sure that the percentage of MFI was independent of the probe concentrations, we measured the total lipid mixing at 1.5 and 0.7 mol % NBD-PS while keeping the rhodamine-PE concentration at 1.5 mol %. We found that the percentages of MFI were identical for both NBD-PS concentrations (supplemental information). Inner Leaflet Mixing Assay—The inner leaflet mixing assay was modified from the method developed by Meers et al. (20Meers P. Ali S. Erukulla R. Janoff A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 227-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The method is based on the fact that sodium dithionite reacts more rapidly with NBDs in the outer leaflet than those in the inner leaflet. By controlling the time and amount of dithionite, the reaction can be limited to the outer leaflet. Small aliquots (∼0.7 μl) of 100 mm sodium dithionite in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 10, were added to the v-SNARE liposomes (100 μl, 0.2 mm lipid) until a desired reduction of NBD was achieved. The reaction was monitored at room temperature by scanning the fluorescence signal for 15 min from 500 to 700 nm with the excitation at 460 nm. Typically, in 10 min the reduction was complete, and no more change of the spectrum was observed. The liposomes without NBDs in the outer leaflets were subjected to the lipid mixing assay described above. To make sure that the percentage of MFI was independent of the extent of the NBD reduction, the inner leaflet mixing assay was performed at the 55 and 65% reduced conditions. We found that the percentages of MFI were identical for both conditions (supplemental information). We investigated the fusion of liposomes induced by neuronal SNAREs with a well characterized fluorescence lipid mixing assay. Recombinant t-SNARE complexes containing the H3 “core” domain of syntaxin 1A as the t-SNARE heavy chain and SNAP-25 as the t-SNARE light chain were reconstituted into the liposomes containing POPC (65 mol)/DOPS (35 mol) (Fig. 1A). Additionally, the v-SNARE synaptobrevin was also reconstituted into a separate population of the same POPC/DOPS liposomes containing fluorescent lipids, NBD-PS, and rhodamine-PE (1.5 mol % each). For both t- and v-SNAREs, the initial lipid/protein ratio was set at 50:1 (Fig. 1B). When the t-SNARE liposomes were mixed with the v-SNARE liposomes at 35 °C, an increase of the fluorescence intensity was observed, indicating that the fusion occurred (Fig. 2A, red trace). Although both v- and t-SNAREs have roughly equal surface density, the absolute amount of t-SNARE liposomes in the cuvette was about 10 times greater than the v-SNARE liposomes. These amounts of protein and lipid were used to better ensure first order kinetics. Following an initial rapid rise, the fluorescence signal approached a plateau of roughly 40% of maximum (Fig. 2A). The half-time of the fusion reaction was ∼9 ± 1 min (mean ± S.D.) (∼540 ± 60 s), consistent with the previous reported half-time of 10 min with a similarly truncated syntaxin 1A (21Parlati F. Weber T. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Because the fluorescent lipids were distributed equally in the inner leaflet and the outer leaflet, the observed total lipid mixing should be the sum of outer leaflet mixing and inner leaflet mixing. To selectively measure inner leaflet mixing separately, we treated the v-SNARE liposomes with sodium dithionite. Under controlled conditions, sodium dithionite reduces NBD attached to the lipid head group in the outer leaflet to a nonfluorescent derivative while leaving NBD in the inner leaflet largely unaffected. When we mixed the dithionite-treated v-SNARE liposomes with the t-SNARE liposomes, inner leaflet mixing was observed (Fig. 2A, blue trace). The extent of the NBD reduction did not affect the kinetics of inner leaflet mixing (supplemental information). Interestingly, the half-time of inner leaflet mixing was ∼20 ± 2 min (∼1,200 ± 120 s), which was about twice the half-time of total lipid mixing. The kinetic difference in the half-times of the two processes suggests that outer leaflet mixing and inner leaflet mixing were not simultaneous but sequential in time. These results suggest that outer leaflet mixing likely occurred faster than inner leaflet mixing. Because we collected the time traces of total lipid mixing and inner leaflet mixing separately, it was straightforward to calculate the percentage of hemifusion (defined as 2(PT - PI)/[2(PT - PI) + PI] × 100, where PT is the percentage of maximum for total lipid mixing and PI is the percentage of maximum for inner leaflet mixing (Fig. 2A)) as a function of time. As expected, at the beginning of the fusion reaction, the fluorescence change was mainly due to outer leaflet mixing (Fig. 2B), indicating that hemifusion was the dominant event. As time progressed, however, the percentage of hemifusion decreased dramatically. Hemifusion was about 90% at 1 min and was extrapolated to be nearly 100% at the start of the reaction. The percentage steadily declined to roughly 20% at 40 min (Fig. 2B) and asymptotically approached 12% at 150 min. It should be noted that these estimates are from the ensemble of ∼7 × 1011 liposomes in the reaction and that each individual event is likely to be very fast (18McNew J.A. Parlati F. Fukuda R. Johnston R.J. Paz K. Paumet F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 2000; 407: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 21Parlati F. Weber T. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These results provide strong kinetic evidence for the conversion of hemifusion to complete fusion over time and therefore for the sequential mechanism in which hemifusion is an on-pathway intermediate (Fig. 2C). We analyzed outer and inner leaflet mixing separately on the basis of the sequential mechanism (Fig. 2C). For this purpose, net outer leaflet mixing was obtained by subtracting the kinetics of inner leaflet mixing from that of total lipid mixing (Fig. 2E). The time trace of outer leaflet mixing fitted well to a simple exponential function representing the first order kinetics with the first order rate constant k1 = 1.5 × 10-3 s-1 (Fig. 2E). The kinetics of inner leaflet mixing was analyzed with the first order kinetics theory for the sequential mechanism depicted in Fig. 2C (22Kuzmiè P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). The theory fitted the data very well with first order rate constant k2 = 3.7 × 10-3 s-1 and the backward rate constant k-1 = 6.3 × 10-3 s-1. It is quite interesting to find that k-1 is almost twice as big as k2. Thus, once hemifusion is formed it is twice as likely to go back to the two separate liposomes than to advance toward the complete fusion. One might argue that these results are equally consistent with a parallel mechanism as well (Fig. 2D). In this alternative mechanism, hemifusion is an off-pathway product in equilibrium with the unfused liposomes. However, the data argue against the parallel mechanism. At the beginning of the reaction, the fusion events were almost exclusively hemifusion (Fig. 2B), which is a clear indicator for a sequential mechanism. Thus, the results favor the sequential mechanism and establish that SNARE-mediated membrane fusion transitions through hemifusion. Work with viral fusion proteins as well as SNARE proteins has suggested that the surface protein density of the fusion proteins may be an important parameter that determines the outcome of the fusion events (12Xu Y. Zhang F. Su Z. McNew J.A. Shin Y.-K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 23Chernomordik L.V. Frolov V.A. Leikina E. Bronk P. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1369-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the role of the protein surface density, we reduced the input L/P ratios to 100:1 and 200:1, from the original 50:1. Liposomes generated with a 100:1 L/P ratio yielded results that were qualitatively similar to those for the previous 50:1 L/P ratio (Fig. 3, A and B), although the overall fusion efficiency was lower and the conversion from hemifusion to complete fusion was slower. With this surface density, ∼45% of full fusion occurred during the 75-min reaction. However, at the L/P ratio of 200:1 we did not observe the time-dependent shift from hemifusion to complete fusion (Fig. 3, C and D). This result suggests that the majority (>60%) of hemifusion intermediate remained without transitioning to complete fusion. Thus, the surface density of SNARE proteins is indeed a determining factor for the outcome of SNARE-induced membrane fusion. In summary, we have shown that membrane fusion induced by neuronal SNAREs transitions from hemifusion to complete fusion in a kinetically resolvable manner, establishing that hemifusion is a true intermediate along the SNARE-induced membrane fusion pathway. We also have shown that, under low surface protein density, hemifusion can be trapped as an outcome of SNARE-induced membrane fusion. Download .pdf (.29 MB) Help with pdf files"

Neuregulin (NRG) and Agrin from motor nerve terminals are both implicated. Here, we demonstrate that NMJs can form in the absence of the NRG receptors ErbB2 and ErbB4 in mouse muscle. Postsynaptic differentiation is, however, induced by Agrin. We therefore conclude that NRG signaling to muscle is not required for NMJ formation. The effects of NRG signaling to muscle may be mediated indirectly through Schwann cells."

Previous studies showed that ADAMTS13 truncated after spacer domain remains proteolytically active or hyperactive. However, the relative contribution of each domain within the proximal carboxyl terminus of ADAMTS13 in substrate recognition and specificity is not known. We showed that a metalloprotease domain alone was unable to cleave the Tyr–Met bond of glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase (GST)-VWF73-H substrate in 3 h, but it did cleave the substrate at a site other than the Tyr–Met bond after 16–24 h of incubation. Remarkably, the addition of even one or several proximal carboxyl-terminal domains of ADAMTS13 restored substrate specificity. Full proteolytic activity, however, was not achieved until all of the proximal carboxyl-terminal domains were added. The addition of TSP1 2–8 repeats and two CUB domains did not further increase proteolytic activity. Furthermore, ADAMTS13 truncated after the spacer domain with or without metalloprotease domain bound GST-VWF73-H with a <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> of ≈7.0 or 13 nm, comparable with full-length ADAMTS13 (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> = 4.6 nm). Metalloprotease domain did not bind GST-VWF73-H detectably, but the disintegrin domain, first TSP1 repeat, Cys-rich domain, and spacer domain bound GST-VWF73-H with <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> values of 489, 136, 121, and 108 nm, respectively. These proximal carboxyl-terminal domains dose-dependently inhibited cleavage of fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRETS)-VWF73 by full-length ADAMTS13 and ADAMTS13 truncated after the spacer domain. These data demonstrated that the proximal carboxyl-terminal domains of ADAMTS13 determine substrate specificity and are all required for recognition and cleavage of von Willebrand factor between amino acid residues Asp<sup>1595</sup> and Arg<sup>1668</sup>."

They morphologically comprise an elastin core and an outer mantle of fibrillin-rich microfibrils. During elastic fiber formation, tropoelastin is deposited on preformed microfibrillar templates. Deposits of elastin first appear within microfibril bundles and gradually coalesce, whereas microfibrils are gradually displaced to the periphery or subsumed into the elastin core. Elastin is synthesized as the soluble precursor tropoelastin (2Mecham R.P. Davis E.C. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure.

In affinity chromatography studies, heparin has been shown to bind fibrillin-1 at the furin-processed C terminus (13Ritty T.M. Broekelmann T.J. Werneck C.C. Mecham R.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Heparin and heparan sulfate interacted in a calcium-independent manner to a large fibrillin-1 N-terminal fragment (Arg45-Thr450) and to the C-terminal half of fibrillin-1 (Asp1528-Arg2731), and in a calcium-dependent manner to a large central (Asp1028-Thr1486) fragment of fibrillin-1 (9Tiedemann K. Batge B. Muller P.K. Reinhardt D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36035-36042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These heparan sulfate-binding sites had a selective specificity for sulfated l-iduronate-rich heparan sulfate. Addition of heparin or heparan sulfate to skin fibroblast cultures and treatment with β-d-xylosides, which inhibit the attachment of glycosaminoglycans to core proteins, inhibited fibrillin-1 microfibril deposition (9Tiedemann K. Batge B. Muller P.K. Reinhardt D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36035-36042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Sulfated heparan sulfate is also necessary for tropoelastin incorporation into the extracellular matrix (14Buczek-Thomas J.A. Chu C.L. Rich C.B. Stone P.J. Foster J.A. Nugent M.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Kozel B.A. Ciliberto C.H. Mecham R.P. Matrix Biol. 2004; 23: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate is an anionic linear polymer composed of 50-200 disaccharide units covalently attached to specific proteins, forming proteoglycans at the cell surface (syndecans and glypicans) and in the extracellular matrix (e.g. perlecan, agrin, and collagen XVIII) (16Kramer K.L. Yost H.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 461-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate chains are synthesized by enzymes that initially polymerize a chain of repeating GlcA and GlcNAc units, which are then variously modified by N- and O-sulfation and uronate epimerization (17Gallagher J. Lyon M. Iozzo R. Proteoglycans: Structure, Biology and Molecular Interactions. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2000: 27-60Google Scholar, 18Murphy K.J. Merry C.L. Lyon M. Thompson J.E. Roberts I.S. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27239-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These modifications occur in clusters, creating sulfation domains (S-domains) that form the principal recognition site for heparan sulfate-binding proteins (17Gallagher J. Lyon M. Iozzo R. Proteoglycans: Structure, Biology and Molecular Interactions. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2000: 27-60Google Scholar, 18Murphy K.J. Merry C.L. Lyon M. Thompson J.E. Roberts I.S. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27239-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Flanking the S-domains are regions of alternating N-sulfated and N-acetylated disaccharides, termed “transition zones,” the presence of which distinguishes HS from heparin that is highly modified along its entire length. Interactions between proteins and S-domains can be dependent on a critical sequence of sulfate-modified sugars, e.g. fibroblast growth factor-2 (19Jemth P. Kreuger J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Sturiale L. Gimenez-Gallego G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30567-30573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In other cases, saccharide requirements for ligand binding reflect the length and preference for C-6 sulfation over C-2 or N-sulfation. The C-terminal endostatin fragment of collagen XVIII has been proposed to bind to S-domains interrupted by one GlcNAc residue (20Kreuger J. Matsumoto T. Vanwildemeersch M. Sasaki T. Timpl R.

Jayson G.C. Folkman J. Javaherian K. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 131-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For other heparan sulfate-binding proteins, especially multimeric cytokines such as interleukin-8, the region of heparan sulfate that interacts with the ligand is more extended, encompassing typically two S-domains, including the intervening regions of lower sulfation (23Spillmann D.

Tropoelastin binds two internal fibrillin-1 sites and can be transglutaminase cross-linked to fibrillin-1 (29Rock M.J. Cain S.A. Freeman L.J. Morgan A. Mellody K. Marson A. Shuttleworth C.A.

In this study, we have used BIAcore technology to investigate fibrillin-1 interactions with glycosaminoglycans. We have mapped four high affinity heparan sulfate-binding sites on fibrillin-1 and defined their kinetics, established the binding efficacies of heparin fragments of defined lengths, and showed how heparin binding to fibrillin-1 affects interactions with tropoelastin and MAGP-1 but not the homotypic fibrillin-1 interactions. We have also demonstrated that hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate do not interact significantly with fibrillin-1. These data contribute significantly to our understanding of how heparin, and by analogy its chemical analogue heparan sulfate, regulates microfibril and elastic fiber assembly.

PF1 fragments incorporating three separate Marfan syndrome-causing point mutations, R62C, T101A, and V449I, 2Marfan syndrome mutation data base (www.umd.be). were also generated.

Heparin and Heparin Saccharides—The heparin used was the sodium salt from porcine intestinal mucosa, with a molecular mass of ∼3000 Da (Sigma, catalog number H3400). The heparin saccharides were not obtained from a commercial source and were prepared by digestion of heparin with bacterial heparinase, as reported previously (35Linhardt R.J. Turnbull J.E. Wang H.M. Loganathan D. Gallagher J.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Three defined sized heparin saccharides were used, dp12, dp16, and dp24, which contain 12, 16, and 24 monosaccharides, respectively. These fragments are chemical analogues of the sulfated domains (S-domains) of heparan sulfate; the domain structure of heparan sulfate is shown in Fig. 2. The chondroitin 6-sulfate sodium salt used was from shark cartilage (Fluka, UK, catalog number 27045). The biotinylated hyaluronan was purchased from Sigma (catalog number B1557). Biotinylation of Heparin—Two methods of biotinylation were used in order to confirm the heparin saccharide interactions with fibrillin. The first approach was via oxidized cis-diol groups (Fig. 2) (36Osmond R.I. Kett W.C. Skett S.E. Coombe D.R. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 310: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Chondroitin sulfate, heparin, and heparin species dp12, dp16, and dp24, in 0.1 mm solutions, were made up in 0.1 m NaOAc, pH 5.5 (coupling buffer). To a volume of 100 μl was added the same volume of 20 mm sodium meta-periodate in coupling buffer. After 30 min on ice in the dark, 20 μl of 150 mm glycerol was added to stop the oxidation, for 5 min on ice in the dark. The samples were dialyzed into coupling buffer before the addition of biotin-LC-hydrazide (Pierce) at a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, the nonreacted biotin was removed by extensive dialysis into coupling buffer. The second biotinylation approach involved coupling via the heparin reducing end in two stages (36Osmond R.I. Kett W.C. Skett S.E. Coombe D.R. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 310: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 37Nardella C. Steinkuhler C. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 332: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). First, reductive amination with ammonia and then biotin was coupled to the free amines (Fig. 2). Heparin species dp12, dp16, and dp24, (0.1 mg) were dissolved in 2 m NH4Cl, in a volume of 100 μl. 2 mg of NaCNBH3 was added, and the mixture was heated at 70 °C for 2 days. After cooling, the mixture was dialyzed extensively into Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Cambrex, UK). 10 μl of 3 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The nonreacted biotin was then removed by further dialysis into 0.1 m NaOAc, pH 5.5. BIAcore 3000 Binding Analysis—For kinetic binding studies of heparin, heparin oligosaccharides, chondroitin sulfate, and hyaluronan with fibrillin-1 by surface plasmon resonance, a BIAcore biosensor was used (BIAcore 3000, BIAcore AB, Sweden). Biotinylated heparin, heparin fragments, chondroitin sulfate, and hyaluronan oligosaccharides were immobilized onto commercially prepared SA sensor chips, which have preimmobilized streptavidin, to allow biotin capture. By using heparin concentrations of 1 μm, typically 150-200 RU of biotinylated heparin samples were immobilized, which was at a saturation level. Samples were applied to the sensor chip surface in 0.1 m NaOAc, pH 5.5. All subsequent binding experiments were performed in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.005% surfactant P20 (designated HBS-Ca). Heparin, heparin saccharides, hyaluronan, and chondroitin sulfate binding analyses were performed using a panel of fibrillin-1 protein fragments encompassing full-length fibrillin-1, as analytes, at 100 nm and a flow rate of 30 μl/min for 3 min. A high flow rate of 30 μl/min was used to minimize mass transport effects. After 2.5 min dissociation, the chip was regenerated using 50 mm NaOH and 1 m NaCl for 1 min. The chip was then stabilized for 20 min using HBS-Ca, before the next injection was carried out. The analyte was simultaneously passed over a blank flow cell, and this base line was subtracted from the experimental flow cell. None of the analytes was found to interact with the blank flow cell; however, this control allowed bulk shifts caused by subtle differences in solvents to be eliminated. The maximum relative response value for each injection was calculated using the binding assay result wizard (BIAcore control software 3.2). BIAcore 3000 Kinetic Analysis of Molecular Interactions—Kinetic analysis was performed using heparin and the heparin saccharides dp12, dp16, and dp24 immobilized to SA sensor chips and fibrillin-1 fragments PF1, PF7, PF11, and PF13 that were shown in analyte screening to bind heparin and HS. Protein fragments were injected at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 5 μg/ml at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Samples were injected for 3 min, dissociated for 10 min, regenerated for 1 min using 50 mm NaOH, 1 m NaCl, followed by 1 min using HBS-Ca containing 800 mm NaCl, and then stabilized for 10 min before the next injection. After subtraction of each response value from the blank cell, association and dissociation rate constants were determined by global data analysis. All curves were fitted using 1:1 Langmuir association/dissociation model (BIAevaluation 4.1, BIAcore AB). This model was found to fit the data for three fragments (PF7, PF11, and PF13) very well, with low χ2 values. χ2 values are a standard statistical measure of the closeness of fit (mean square of the signal noise). Two alternative methods were used for PF1 binding to heparin. PF1 binding to heparin was calculated independently by using equilibrium analysis. The injection time was increased to 15 min and the dissociation time to 30 min. The equilibrium response was plotted against concentration, and nonlinear regression using the equation for one site binding was used to calculate KD values. To calculate association and dissociation constants for PF1, the observed rate constant kobs was calculated from the association phase using the 1:1 Langmuir association (kobs) model (BIAevaluation 4.1, BIAcore AB). A secondary plot of kobs against concentration (C) allows ka and kd to be calculated using linear regression, using the equation kobs = kaC + kd. The binding of PF1 mutants R62C, T101A, and V449I was also analyzed against immobilized dp24, using the same methods. To investigate the kinetics of interactions between the PF1 mutants and MAGP-1, MAGP-1 was immobilized on the surface of a CM5 sensor chip via amine coupling, as described previously (29Rock M.J. Cain S.A. Freeman L.J. Morgan A. Mellody K. Marson A. Shuttleworth C.A. Weiss A.S. Kielty C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23748-23758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). PF1 and PF1 mutants R62C, T101A, and V449I were then injected at concentration ranges of 0.25-5 μg/ml at a flow rate 30 μl/min. Kinetic analysis was also performed on immobilized hyaluronan using the versican G1 domain (kindly provided by Dr. A. Day, MRC Immunochemistry Unit, Oxford, UK). Versican was injected at concentrations ranging from 1 to 5 μg/ml at a flow rate 30 μl/min. For a potential positive control for chondroitin 6-sulfate, binding of fibroblast growth factor-1 and -2 was tested, but no significant binding was detected. However, chondroitin ABC lyase lowered the response level of the chondroitin sulfate immobilized flow cell, indicating cleavage may have taken place. Inhibition Assays Using BIAcore—To investigate the effects of MAGP-1 on binding of PF1 to dp24, kinetic analysis was performed using 1 μg/ml PF1 preincubated with 0.4-1200 nm MAGP-1 in HBS-Ca. For MAGP-1 only, 0.4-1200 nm was separately passed over the sensor chip, as a control. These responses were then subtracted from the corresponding PF1/MAGP-1 data. Analytes were injected over the sensor chip in the same manner as described for the kinetic studies. An inhibition curve was then plotted using the response value of each normalized curve, at the end of the association period. To investigate the effects of dp24 on the interaction of PF1 to MAGP-1, MAGP-1 was immobilized, using amine coupling, as described previously (29Rock M.J. Cain S.A. Freeman L.J. Morgan A. Mellody K.

Kinetic analysis was carried out using 1 and 5 μg/ml of PF1 preincubated with increasing concentrations of un-biotinylated dp24 0.4-4000 nm; dp24 0.4-4000 nm was separately passed over the sensor chip and then subtracted from the PF1/dp24 plots. An inhibition curve was plotted, as described above. To investigate the effects of dp24 on the interaction of PF7 to tropoelastin, tropoelastin was immobilized, using amine coupling as described previously (29Rock M.J. Cain S.A. Freeman L.J. Morgan A.

Kinetic analysis was carried out using 1 and 5 μg/ml of PF7 preincubated with increasing concentrations of un-biotinylated dp24 0.4-4000 nm or with dp24 only (0.4-4000 nm). An inhibition curve was plotted, as described above. Calcium dependence for fibrillin-1/heparin interactions was determined by kinetic analysis, monitoring immobilized biotinylated dp24 binding to 5 μg/ml PF1, PF7, or PF11, in the presence of increasing concentrations of EDTA (0.01-10 mm). EDTA only sensorgrams were also plotted and subtracted from the FBN-1/EDTA sensorgrams. An inhibition curve was plotted, as described above. Inhibition Using Solid Phase Binding Assays—Competition binding assays were also conducted using both nonbiotinylated and biotinylated soluble proteins; biotinylation was carried out as described previously (29Rock M.J. Cain S.A. Freeman L.J. Morgan A. Mellody K. Marson A. Shuttleworth C.A. Weiss A.S. Kielty C.M. J. Biol.

Flat-bottomed microtiter plates were coated with PF1 and PF13, at 100 nm in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2 (TBSa/CaCl2), overnight at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding sites were then blocked with TBSa/CaCl2 containing 4% BSA at room temperature for at least 2 h. The plates were washed three times with TBSa, CaCl2, 0.1% BSA and incubated with either 100 nm of biotinylated PF1 or PF13, which had been preincubated with heparin oligosaccharide dp24 (4-12000 nm) in TBSa/CaCl2, overnight at 4 °C.

https://openalex.org/W1967932754,"The polymannan O-antigenic polysaccharides (O-PSs) of Escherichia coli O8 and O9a are synthesized via an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-dependent pathway. The group 2 capsular polysaccharides of E. coli serve as prototypes for polysaccharide synthesis and export via this pathway. Here, we show that there are some fundamental differences between the ABC transporter-dependent pathway for O-PS biosynthesis and the capsular polysaccharide paradigm. In the capsule system, mutants lacking the ABC transporter are viable, and membranes isolated from these strains are no longer able to synthesize polymer using an endogenous acceptor. In contrast, E. coli strains carrying mutations in the membrane component (Wzm) and/or the nucleotide-binding component (Wzt) of the O8 and O9a polymannan transporters are nonviable under conditions permissive to O-PS biosynthesis and take on an aberrant elongated cell morphology. Whereas the ABC transporters for capsular polysaccharides with different structures are functionally interchangeable, the O8 and O9a exporters are specific for their cognate polymannan substrates. The E. coli O8 and O9a Wzt proteins contain a C-terminal domain not present in the corresponding nucleotide-binding protein (KpsT) from the capsule exporter. Whereas the Wzm components are functionally interchangeable, albeit with reduced efficiency, the Wzt components are not, indicating a specific role for Wzt in substrate specificity. Chimeric Wzt proteins were constructed in order to localize the region involved in substrate specificity to the C-terminal domain. The polymannan O-antigenic polysaccharides (O-PSs) of Escherichia coli O8 and O9a are synthesized via an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-dependent pathway. The group 2 capsular polysaccharides of E. coli serve as prototypes for polysaccharide synthesis and export via this pathway.

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; O-PS, O-polysaccharide; TMD, transmembrane domain; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; IF, immunofluorescence. transporters, or traffic ATPases, are responsible for the import and export of a variety of molecules across membranes. In the Escherichia coli K-12 genome, 79 known or putative ABC transporters have been identified indicating the importance of this protein superfamily in cellular physiology (1Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The prototypical transporter consists of four domains (two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs)), which may be organized in a variety of ways (2Altenberg G.A. News Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 191-195PubMed Google Scholar). The TMD components between different systems share low sequence similarity and contain a variable number of transmembrane segments, whereas the NBD proteins of different systems share a higher overall sequence similarity as a result of the conserved sequence motifs required for ATP hydrolysis (3Locher K.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). X-ray structures are available for a number of NBD proteins as well as four complete transporters (reviewed in Refs. 4Davidson A.L. Chen J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 241-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 5Scheffel F. Demmer U. Warkentin E. Hulsmann A. Schneider E. Ermler U. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2953-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 6Reyes C.L. Chang G. Science. 2005; 308: 1028-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 7Zaitseva J. Jenewein S. Jumpertz T. Holland I.B. Schmitt L. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The structures reveal a common organization of the NBD monomers into two subdomains: a RecA-like domain and a helical domain not found in other ATP-hydrolyzing proteins (4Davidson A.L. Chen J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 241-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The ATP-binding site is found along the NBD dimer interface and is made up of conserved residues from each monomer, namely the Walker A motif from one monomer and the ABC signature motif from the other monomer (8Jones P.M. George A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 179: 187-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the ABC transporter TMD components differ greatly between systems, whereas the NBD components remain highly similar, ABC transporters have been said to consist of a substrate-specific membrane channel powered by a common ATP-hydrolyzing engine (3Locher K.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 9Holland I.B. Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). ABC transporter substrate specificity in periplasmic solute-binding protein-dependent systems involves the solute-binding protein. This protein acts as a receptor and is required for high affinity substrate import (10Quiocho F.A. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1990; 326: 341-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mutant ABC systems, which no longer require the solute-binding protein for substrate import, substrate specificity is maintained due to binding sites located in the TMD component of the transporter (11Shuman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5455-5461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Speiser D.M. Ames G.F. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1444-1451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Treptow N.A. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 654-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The solute-binding proteins are believed to play an additional role in transport by transmitting a signal across the membrane, thus stimulating ATP hydrolysis by the NBD subunits (14Petronilli V. Ames G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16293-16296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Substrate-binding sites in many ABC efflux systems are also located in the TMD component of the transporter, with the eukaryotic multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein and its wide range of hydrophobic substrates, serving as a well studied example (16Sharom F.J. Liu R. Romsicki Y. Lu P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 327-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Safa A.R. Curr. Med. Chem. Anti-cancer Agents. 2004; 4: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, in the secretion of the soluble protein hemolysin in E. coli, there is evidence for an interaction between the substrate and the NBD portion of the transporter (18Benabdelhak H. Kiontke S. Horn C. Ernst R. Blight M.A. Holland I.B. Schmitt L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), as might be anticipated by the direction of transport. The group 2 capsular polysaccharides of E. coli serve as the prototype system for polysaccharide export via an ABC transporter. In this system, the TMD component is designated KpsM, and the NBD component is designated KpsT. Initial evidence for the involvement of this ABC transporter in the export of capsule came from the observation that mutants in either kpsM or kpsT accumulated cytoplasmic polysaccharide (19Krönke K.-D. Golecki J.R. Jann K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3469-3472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pavelka M.S.J. Hayes S.F. Silver R.P. J. Biol.

In the capsule system, all available evidence suggests that the proteins involved in capsule export operate independent of the repeat unit structure of the polymeric substrate (22Bacon D.J. Szymanski C.M. Burr D.H. Silver R.P. Alm R.A. Guerry P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 23Ward C.K. Inzana T.J. Infect.

The export apparatus is functionally interchangeable between different capsule serotypes, even between different bacterial species, indicating that a conserved motif is recognized. Group 2 capsules are modified at the reducing terminus with a lipid moiety prior to export from the cytoplasm (28Gotschlich E.C. Fraser B.A. Nishimura O. Robbins J.B. Liu T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8915-8921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the specific gene products responsible for this modification are as yet unidentified and remain an area of controversy (29Tzeng Y.L. Datta A.K. Strole C.A. Lobritz M.A. Carlson R.W. Stephens D.S. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 1491-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Bronner D. Sieberth V. Pazzani C. Roberts I.S. Boulnois G.J. Jann B. Jann K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5984-5992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Cieslewicz M. Vimr E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3212-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the current model for export of group 2 capsules, the reducing terminal lipid modifications are believed to provide the conserved moiety recognized by the export apparatus (32Whitfield C. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The O-antigenic polysaccharide (O-PS) portions of the lipopolysaccharide molecules in E. coli serotypes O8 and O9a (and its minor variant O9) serve as the prototypes for O-PS synthesis via an ABC transporter-dependent pathway (reviewed in Ref. 33Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar). Both antigens are homopolymers of mannose and are distinguished by the number of mannose residues and linkages in the repeat units (Fig. 1A). The genetic loci responsible for O-PS synthesis in these serotypes encode proteins required for GDP-mannose synthesis, polymer synthesis, termination, and export (Fig. 1B). The current working model for this system is outlined in Fig. 2. The product of the wecA gene primes synthesis through the transfer of a GlcNAc-1-phosphate to the undecaprenol phosphate carrier lipid. The wecA gene is located outside of the O-PS biosynthesis locus and is involved in synthesis of other polysaccharides (34Alexander D.C. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7079-7084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The products of the wbdA, wbdB, and wbdC genes, located in the O-PS biosynthesis cluster, are mannosyltransferases responsible for O-PS polymerization (35Kido N. Torgov V.I. Sugiyama T. Uchiya K. Sugihara H. Komatsu T. Kato N. Jann K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2178-2187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The WbdD enzymes of the E. coli O8 and O9a biosynthesis systems are required for the addition of the nonreducing terminal modifications to the nascent polymer (36Clarke B.R. Cuthbertson L. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35709-35718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the O8 serotype, this modification is a 3-O-methyl group, whereas in O9a, WbdD acts as both a kinase and a methyltransferase. The addition of these terminal residues is required not only for polymerization termination and chain-length regulation but also for the export of O-PS from the cytoplasm (36Clarke B.R. Cuthbertson L. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35709-35718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The ABC transporter required in this system consists of Wzm (TMD; similar to KpsM) and Wzt (NBD; similar to KpsT), consistent with the domain architecture of other ABC transporters (35Kido N. Torgov V.I. Sugiyama T. Uchiya K. Sugihara H. Komatsu T. Kato N. Jann K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2178-2187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that, unlike the capsule exporter prototype, O-PS exporters are not functionally interchangeable, and we demonstrate that Wzt, the NBD portion of the ABC transporter, imparts substrate specificity.Fig. 2Working model for O8 and O9a biosynthesis. Synthesis begins on the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane on the carrier lipid undecaprenol phosphate and is initiated by the transfer of a GlcNAc-1-phosphate by WecA. The WbdABC mannosyltransferases then synthesize the polymannan O-PS through the sequential addition of mannose residues, from the GDP-mannose donor to the nonreducing terminus (step 1). WbdD action causes termination of polymannan growth through the addition of a methyl group in the E. coli O8 or a phosphate and a methyl group in the O9a serotype (step 2). The completed undecaprenol pyrophosphate-linked polymer is transported to the periplasmic face of the inner membrane by an ABC transporter consisting of Wzm and Wzt (step 3). The O-PS is then transferred to a preformed molecule of lipid A core in a reaction involving WaaL (step 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table I. Strains and plasmids used only in cloning and mutagenesis are described in supplementary materials. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in either LB medium (37Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) or M9 minimal medium (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Media were supplemented with glucose (0.4% w/v), mannose (0.2% w/v), sucrose (5% w/v), glycerol (0.2% v/v), arabinose (0.4%), histidine (22 μg/ml), tryptophan (20 μg/ml), or thiamine (1 μg/ml), as required. The antibiotics ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml), gentamycin (15 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and tetracycline (15 μg/ml) were added where appropriate. All mutant strains carried a defect in d-mannose-6-phosphate aldose-ketose-isomerase (EC 5.3.1.8), making GDP-mannose (and polymannan) synthesis dependent on the addition of mannose to the growth medium (36Clarke B.R. Cuthbertson L. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35709-35718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Strains containing wzm and/or wzt mutations were maintained on medium lacking mannose, because secondary mutations were selected at high frequency when polymannan synthesis occurred in the absence of transport.Table IBacterial strains and plasmidsStrain/PlasmidDescription or genotypeReference or sourceStrainsE69E. coli O9a:K30F.

Template DNA for use in PCR was purified using the DNAzol reagent (Invitrogen) and a modified protocol for purification of bacterial DNA (39Frirdich E. Vinogradov E. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27928-27940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Pwo polymerase (Roche Applied Science) was used in PCR amplification when the desired product was to be cloned. Purification of DNA fragments from agarose gels was carried out using the Ultraclean15 DNA purification kit (MOBIO Laboratories). Alternatively, the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) was used to purify DNA fragments directly from PCR reactions or restriction digestions. Plasmid DNA was purified using the GeneElute plasmid purification kit (Sigma). Restriction digestions and DNA ligation reactions were performed as per the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequencing was performed by the Guelph Molecular Supercenter (University of Guelph, Guelph, Canada). Cloning of wzm and wzt from E. coli O8 and O9a—The genes encoding the Wzm and Wzt proteins from both E. coli O8 and O9a were cloned separately and in tandem for use in complementation experiments. The relevant PCR products were amplified from the chromosomes of E. coli 2775 (O8), E69 (O9a). E. coli Bi8337-41 (K5) was the source of kpsM and kpsT. Restriction sites were designed into the PCR primers to facilitate cloning behind the arabinose-inducible promoter of either pBAD24 or pBADHisA (40Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar) (Invitrogen). Primer sequences and features are described in supplementary material. Construction of Plasmids Encoding Chimeric Wzt Proteins—Chimeric Wzt proteins were generated using an overlapping PCR protocol (41Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar, 42Lefebvre B. Formstecher P. Lefebvre P. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 186-188PubMed Google Scholar). In the creation of pWQ337, primers LC33 and LC37 were used to amplify the 5′ region of wztO8 (encoding amino acids 1-61). LC33, used in initial amplification, was designed to anneal upstream of wzt in order to increase the size of the amplified fragment to make the product manageable for purification. LC37 was designed to include a 25-bp overhang containing sequence corresponding to wztO9a. Primers LC17 and LC35 were then used to amplify DNA encoding amino acids 61-431 of WztO9a. Primer LC35 was designed to include 25 bp of sequence corresponding to wztO8. The resulting PCR fragments were annealed and used as template in a third PCR. The full-length chimeric open reading frame was then further amplified with primers LC40 and LC17, designed to contain EcoRI and SphI sites, respectively, to facilitate cloning in pBAD24. Additional chimeras (Table I) were made using a similar strategy. The primers used are described in supplementary material. Plasmid pWQ342 was created using a different approach. Primer LC62 (encoding amino acids 394-404 of WztO8) was used in conjunction with LC42 to amplify the mutated WztO9a for ligation into pBAD24. Construction of Chromosomal Insertion Mutations—Chromosomal insertion mutants E. coli CWG713 (wzm-wztO8), CWG710 (wztO8), CWG711 (wzmO8), CWG709 (wzmO9a), and CWG708 (wztO9a) were created through allelic replacement using the suicide delivery vector pRE112 (43Edwards R.A. Keller L.H. Schifferli D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 207: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Insertion mutants were selected on M9 (glucose, sucrose, kanamycin, tetracycline) agar at room temperature and confirmed by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Plasmid pWQ330 was used in allelic replacement of wzm-wztO8 to create CWG713. Primer pairs LC30/LC32 (MluI) and LC6 (XhoI)/LC4 were used to amplify the first 295 bp of wzmO8 and the last 430 bp of wztO8, respectively. DNA encoding the aphA-3 kanamycin resistance cassette from pYA3265 was amplified with primers AP47 and AP48, which contained the restriction sites MluI and XhoI, respectively. The fragments generated from the three PCRs were digested with the appropriate enzymes and ligated. The ligation reaction was then used as template for amplification with primers LC30 (SmaI) and LC4 (SphI). The resulting product (the aphA-3 cassette flanked by the 5′ 295 bp of wzmO8 and the 3′ 430 bp of wztO8) was digested with SmaI and SphI and ligated into the same sites of pRE112. Additional pRE112 constructs are listed in Table I, and primers used in cloning are described in supplementary material. CWG672 (wbdAO9a) was created through allelic exchange using pWQ9, a pWQ173-based plasmid (44Rahn A. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1045-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Primers wbdAF (NdeI) and wbdAR2 (SacI) were used in the amplification of wbdAO9a. The resulting DNA fragment was digested with NdeI and SacI and ligated into pET30a(+) cut with the same enzymes to create pWQ8. An internal fragment of wbdAO9a was then removed through BamHI digestion, and a BamHI-digested aacC1 cassette was inserted to create pWQ9. The mutated wbdAO9a::aacC1 was then removed by NotI/XbaI digestion and ligated into pWQ173 cut with the same enzymes to create pWQ9. In Vitro Incorporation of Radioactivity from [14C]Mannose into Membrane Fractions—Membranes were isolated from 200-ml cultures grown to an OD600 of 0.4 in M9-0.2% glycerol. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min, washed twice in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and resuspended in 10 ml of the same buffer. Cells were lysed through ultrasonication, and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min. Membranes were then collected by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 39,000 × g. The resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in 0.6 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and stored at -75 °C. Mannosyltransferase assays were carried out at 30 °C in 0.5-ml reactions containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 606 nm GDP-[14C]mannose (330 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the membrane equivalent of 0.5 mg of total protein (determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit). At each time interval, 0.1 ml was removed and added to 0.3 ml of cold 10% acetic acid to stop the reaction. Samples were filtered onto MicroSep 0.45-μm cellulose filters (Osmonics) and washed twice with 10% acetic acid to remove residual radioactive GDP-[14C]mannose. Filters were dried and placed in 5 ml of Ecolite scintillation fluid (ICN Biomedicals), and radioactivity incorporated into polymer was measured using a scintillation counter. Analytical Methods—To examine LPS, proteinase K-digested whole cell lysates were prepared for SDS-PAGE by the method of Hitchcock and Brown (45Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and visualized by silver staining (46Tsai G.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar). For antibody detection, LPS was transferred by immunoblotting to PROTRAN nitrocellulose membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and detected using O9a-specific polyclonal antiserum (36Clarke B.R.

Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were subcultured 1:25 from a 5-ml overnight culture grown in LB 0.4% glucose into 5 ml of LB supplemented with ampicillin and 0.4% arabinose where required. Cultures were grown for ∼3 h. Immunofluorescence labeling of intact and permeabilized cells was performed as described previously using O9a-specific polyclonal antiserum as the primary antibody and rhodamine red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (Jackson Immunoresearch) as the secondary antibody (36Clarke B.R.

WztO8 and WztO9a Contain a C-terminal Region Not Present in either KpsTK1 or KpsTK5—The wzm genes from E. coli O8 and O9a are predicted to encode protein homologues of 264 and 261 amino acids, respectively, and share 63% identity (83% similarity). An alignment of the E. coli O8 and O9a Wzm proteins with KpsM from E. coli K1 (Fig. 3) shows that the O-PS exporter homologues share only very limited primary sequence similarity with the capsule exporter. However, hydropathy plots for the three ABC transporter TMDs are very similar, with all three proteins predicted to contain six membrane-spanning segments at similar positions (data not shown). The wzt homologues from the O8 and O9a serotypes are predicted to encode proteins of 404 and 431 amino acids, respectively. Over their entire length, the two proteins share 43% identity (62% similarity). Examination of an alignment (Fig. 4) shows higher similarity in the N-terminal region of the proteins (80% similarity) than in the C-terminal region (40% similarity). The N-terminal region contains sequence motifs, including the Walker A and B motifs and the ABC signature sequence found in all ABC transporters (4Davidson A.L. Chen J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 241-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). As expected, these sequence motifs are also conserved in KpsTK1. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of WztO8, WztO9a, and KpsTK1 reveals that the variable C-terminal domain present in the O8 and O9a Wzt homologues is absent from KpsTK1.

Lu/B-CAM gps have been recognized as laminin α5 receptors on red blood cells and epithelial cells in multiple tissues. It has been shown that sickle red cells exhibit enhanced adhesion to laminin α5 when intracellular cAMP is up-regulated by physiological stimuli such as epinephrine and that this signaling pathway is protein kinase A- and Lu/B-CAM-dependent. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between the phosphorylation status of Lu/B-CAM gps and their adhesion function to laminin α5. We showed that Lu isoform was phosphorylated in sickle red cells as well as in erythroleukemic K562 and epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and that this phosphorylation is enhanced by different stimuli of the PKA pathway. Lu gp is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 β, casein kinase II, and PKA at serines 596, 598, and 621, respectively. Alanine substitutions of serines 596 and 598 abolished phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 β and casein kinase II, respectively, but had no effect on adhesion of K562 cells to laminin under flow conditions. Conversely, mutation of serine 621 prevented phosphorylation by PKA and dramatically reduced cell adhesion. Furthermore, stimulation of K562 cells by epinephrine increased Lu gp phosphorylation by PKA and enhanced adhesion to laminin. It is postulated that modulation of the phosphorylation state of Lu gp might be a critical factor for the sickle red cells adhesiveness to laminin α5 in sickle cell disease.

Laminins are heterotrimeric proteins composed of α, β, and γ chains that associate to form at least 15 heterotrimer proteins that are found in all basement membranes (7Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D.

Cell adhesion to laminin plays a critical role in proliferation, differentiation, and motility and in the progression of malignant tumors through interaction and activation of specific cell surface receptors (10Pouliot N.

Laminins α5 (α5β1γ1 and α5β2γ1), which contain the α5 chain, are strong adhesive components for epithelial cells. The major integrin receptors of the laminin α5 are integrins α3β1 (13Kikkawa Y.

Although these integrins are the coreceptors of several laminins, Lu gps bind only to laminin α5 isoform. Lu/B-CAM gps also act as functional laminin α5 coreceptors with integrin α3β1 in renal epithelial and in smooth muscle cells (11Moulson C.L. Li C. Miner J.H. Dev.

In bone marrow, laminin α5 chain is an adhesive substrate to stem cells and progenitor cells and influences progenitor cell migration in vitro (22Gu Y. Sorokin L. Durbeej M. Hjalt T. Jonsson J.I. Ekblom M. Blood. 1999; 93: 2533-2542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In sickle red blood cells, adhesion to thrombospondin, fibronectin, and laminin in the vasculature may dramatically impact vaso-occlusion events (for review, see Ref. 23Telen M.J. Semin. Hematol. 2000; 37: 130-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Lu/B-CAM antigens on sickle red cells correlates with an increased adhesion to laminin α5 (5El Nemer W.

Jefferson S. Daymont C. Zen Q. Telen M.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 6aGoogle Scholar) and therefore might participate in the reinforced adhesion of sickle red cells to vascular endothelium. It was recently shown that the physiologic stress mediator epinephrine, acting through the β2-adrenergic receptor, increased the adhesion of sickle red blood cells to laminin α5 via a cAMP and PKA-dependent signaling pathway (25Hines P.C. Zen Q. Burney S.N. Shea D.A. Ataga K.I. Orringer E.P. Telen M.J. Parise L.V. Blood. 2003; 101: 3281-3287Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The authors proposed a classical cascade in which the β2-adrenergic receptor stimulates Gαs proteins that in turn activate adenylyl cyclase, thus elevating the cAMP levels and leading to PKA activation. Lu/B-CAM gps were identified as receptors that mediate the stimulated adhesion of sickle red cells to laminin α5 under continuous flow conditions (26Zen Q. Batchvarova M. Twyman C.A. Eyler C.E. Qiu H. De Castro L.M. Telen M.J. Am. J. Hematol. 2004; 75: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This signaling pathway may also participate in vaso-occlusion events. However, the authors failed to reveal any target for phosphorylation by PKA that could explain the Lu/B-CAM-mediated cell adhesion to laminin α5.In this study, we investigated the phosphorylation status of Lu gps in normal and sickle red cells and in transfected erythroid K562 and epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) cells. We demonstrated that Lu gp but not Lu(v13) isoform is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK-3β), casein kinase II (CKII), and PKA, at serines 596, 598, and 621, respectively. The Lu gp phosphorylation is enhanced by forskolin, a major activator of the PKA signaling pathway, in sickle red blood cells and by different stimuli of the PKA-pathway in K562 and MDCK cells. We examined the role of phosphorylation of the Lu gp in regulating the adhesion function to laminin α5 in K562 cells. We demonstrated that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the Lu gp at Ser-621 positively regulates the adhesion function of Lu gp under flow conditions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Primers used in PCR and mutagenesis experiments were from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium).

For the SSS596–598-621AAA mutant, Lub SS596–598AA-pcDNA3 mutant was used as template using the same primers as those for mutation S621A. The inserts were sequenced using the ABI-PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems).Cell Culture, Transfection, and Flow Cytometry—Human erythroleukemic K562 cells and MDCK cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. K562 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Dutscher, Brumath, France). MDCK cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 2 mm GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, and 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.

Transfected cells were selected in the presence of 0.8 g/liter Geneticin for K562 cells and 0.6 g/liter Geneticin for MDCK cells. Lub-positive cells were detected by flow cytometry using the anti-Lub mAb LM342. Cells expressing the recombinant proteins were then selected using anti-Lub LM342 followed by anti-mouse IgG-coated beads (Dynabeads-M-450, Dynal A.S., Oslo, Norway).

For in vitro phosphorylation assay, 5 μg of GST-Lu fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were mixed with purified kinases (GSK-3β, CKII) in the reaction buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μm okadaic acid and incubated with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (200 μm) 30 min at 30 °C. Reaction products were washed six times with the reaction buffer and then resuspended and boiled 5 min in 1× Laemmli buffer. Samples were subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Bands corresponding to phosphorylated GST-Lu were visualized by autoradiography and were quantified by KODAK ID Image analysis software.Phosphorylation Assays in Transfected Cells—MDCK or K562 cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with 200 μCi of orthophosphate 32P (17 mm) for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of phosphatase inhibitor (1 μm okadaic acid) and Complete protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were treated or not with 5 mm br-cAMP for 30 min, 200 μm forskolin for 20 min, or 200 μm epinephrine for 1 min at 37 °C.Erythrocyte Phosphorylation Assays—Phospholabeling of red blood cells was performed on normal and sickle red blood cells, as described by Brunati et al.

The cells were then centrifuged 750 × g for 3 min and resuspended in 2.1 ml of buffer A′ containing 300 μCi of orthophosphate 32P (25 mm) for 14 h at 35 °C. Cells were then incubated with 200 μm forskolin 20 min at 35 °C and in the presence of 1 μm okadaic acid (phosphatase inhibitor).Anti-Lu/B-CAM Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed for 1 h at 4 °C in Triton lysis buffer A for MDCK and K562 cells (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA) and Triton lysis buffer A′ for red blood cells (150 mm NaCl; 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 10 mm KCl; 1 mm MgCl2), both containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of lysates were mixed with 1× Laemmli buffer and boiled 5 min before loading on 8% SDS-PAGE gels. For Lu gp immunoprecipitation, lysates were submitted to preclearing by incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL4B beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated with F241 anti-Lu mAb and protein A-Sepharose CL4B beads overnight at 4 °C. For MDCK and K562 cells, the beads were then washed three times with Triton lysis buffer A, two times with Triton buffer B (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5% Triton, 0.2% bovine serum albumin), and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and for red blood cells, with buffer A′ containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Immunocomplexes were resuspended and boiled in 1× Laemmli buffer. Samples were loaded on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Radioactive proteins were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by KODAK ID Image analysis software.Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—The SDS-PAGE was performed using 8 and 12.5% polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (53Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and/or Western blots were performed on nitrocellulose membranes. For immunoblots, membranes were incubated with the rabbit 602 and/or 603 antibodies and detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences).Flow Adhesion Assays—K562 cell adhesion to laminin α5 was measured under physiologic flow conditions using a plate flow chamber as described (30Rainger G.E. Fisher A. Shearman C. Nash G.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H1398-H1406PubMed Google Scholar, 31Cook A.D. Sagers R.D. Pitt W.G. J. Biomater. Appl. 1993; 8: 72-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 3.5 μg of the purified human α5 laminin mixture (or purified human merosine) were immobilized on clean glass microslides (Camlab, Cambridge, UK) of 3.5 cm2 by incubating overnight at 4 °C. Then, microslides were mounted on a microscope stage and viewed by phase-contrast videomicroscopy. One end of the microslide was attached to Harvard syringe pump, allowing the control of the flow rate through the microslide. The other end of the microslide was attached to a microelectronic valve (Lee Products Ltd., Gerrards Cross, UK), permitting smooth switching between K562 cells suspension and cell-free 0.5% human albumin Hanks' buffer. Following insertion of the microslide into the flow system, 1 ml of K562 cells (3.106/ml) expressing various Lu/B-CAM gps in albumin/Hanks' buffer were flowed across the immobilized laminin for 10 min at shear stress of 0.2 dyne/cm2. Then, adherent cells were washed for 5 min using a flow rate of 0.054, 0.081, 0.108, 0.27, 0.54, 0.81, and 1.08 ml/min, producing shear stresses of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 1, 2, 3, and 4 dyne/cm2, successively. After each wash, adherent cells were quantified in six representative areas along the centerline of the microslide by microscopy (×10) using a computerized image analysis system (Optimas 6.1). The counted cells were then averaged and presented as adherent cells per mm2. For cell activation or inhibition experiments, 1 ml of K562 cells (3.106/ml) were preincubated with 20 nm epinephrine for 1 min at 37 °C or 160 μm butoxamine for 20 min at 37 °C, centrifuged, and then flowed across the immobilized laminin α5.Statistical Analysis—A Student's t test was used to assess the statistical significance between adhesion of each cell line or adhesion of treated versus untreated cells.RESULTSPhosphorylation of the Lu gp Is Stimulated by Forskolin in Sickle Red Blood Cells—The amino acid sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of Lu gp isoform but not of Lu(v13) contains three consensus serine phosphorylation sites for protein kinases GSK-3β, CKII, and PKA at positions 596, 598, and 621, respectively (Fig. 1A). Consensus sequences for these kinases are (S/T)XXX(S/T), SXX(E/D), RX1–2(S/T)X, respectively (Phosphobase, NetPhos). To determine whether Lu/B-CAM gps are phosphorylated in normal and sickle red blood cells, cells were labeled with orthophosphate 32P, and Lu/B-CAM gps were immunoprecipitated with the F241 monoclonal anti-Lu antibody, which recognizes both Lu and Lu(v13) isoforms. Lu gp isoform (85 kDa), but not Lu(v13), exhibited a weak level of phosphorylation in both normal and sickle red blood cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 5). These results suggested that Lu gp is phosphorylated in vivo, presumably by either PKA and/or CKII and/or GSK-3β kinases. To define whether the cytoplasmic domain of Lu gp undergoes PKA-dependent phosphorylation in response to stimulation, Lu gp phosphorylation was tested in the presence of 200 μm forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase known to stimulate Lu gp adhesion to laminin α5 on sickle red blood cells through a cAMP-dependent PKA pathway (25Hines P.C. Zen Q. Burney S.N. Shea D.A. Ataga K.I. Orringer E.P. Telen M.J. Parise L.V. Blood. 2003; 101: 3281-3287Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Stimulation of sickle red blood cells with forskolin resulted in a 2.8-fold increase of Lu phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 6), whereas no significant increase in phosphorylation was observed in normal red cells. The different levels of phosphorylation observed in sickle red blood cells before and after treatment with forskolin were significant as similar amounts of Lu gp were immunoprecipitated when tested by Western blot with anti-Lu antibody (Fig. 1B, bottom). These results demonstrated that Lu gp on sickle red blood cells undergoes forskolin-stimulated phosphorylation, presumably by a PKA-dependent pathway.PKA Phosphorylates Lu gp at Serine 621—To determine whether Lu gp isoform is a substrate of PKA and which serines are involved, phosphorylation experiments were performed in both erythroid K562 and epithelial kidney MDCK cells stably transfected by the pcDNA3-Lu or pcDNA3-Lu(v13) vectors. K562 and MDCK cells were labeled with orthophosphate 32P with or without treatment by br-cAMP, a stable, membrane-permeable cAMP analog that activates PKA. Lu/B-CAM gps were then immunoprecipitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The Lu gp isoform (85 kDa) (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 7) but not Lu(v13) (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 11) was phosphorylated in K562 and MDCK transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 2A (lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 7 and 8), phosphorylation of Lu gp was increased following treatment with br-cAMP (2- and 2.1-fold), indicating that Lu gp might be phosphorylated by PKA in these cells. As expected, Lu(v13) was not phosphorylated after stimulation by br-cAMP in both cell lines (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 11 and 12). Treatment with epinephrine or forskolin, two major activators of adenylyl cyclase, also increased phosphorylation of Lu gp in both cell lines (Fig. 2A, lanes 1, 3, and 4 and lanes 7, 9, and 10). To gain more insights into the role of PKA in Lu gp phosphorylation, we generated Lu mutants S621A and SS596–598AA impaired for the PKA and the clustered CKII/GSK-3β consensus phosphorylation sites, respectively (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 2B (lanes 5 and 6), SS596–598AA mutant maintains enhanced phosphorylation after treatment of K562 and MDCK cells with br-cAMP (1.4- and 1.85-fold, respectively), whereas no significant stimulation was observed for the S621A mutant in both cell types (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). Differences observed in the level of phosphorylation before and after treatment with br-cAMP were significant as similar quantities of Lu gp were immunoprecipitated in each cell line when tested by Western blot with an anti-Lu antibody (Fig. 2, A and B, bottom). These results indicated that PKA phosphorylates Lu gp at Ser-621 in cellular models.Fig. 2The Lu gp isoform is phosphorylated by PKA in recombinant erythroid K562 and epithelial renal MDCK cells. 32P-radiolabeled MDCK and K562 cells expressing Lu gp (A, lanes 1–4 and lanes 7–10 and B, lanes 1 and 2), Lu(v13) gp (A, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 11 and 12), or LuS621A, LuSS596–598AA, and LuSSS596–598-621AAA mutants (B, lanes 3 and 4, lanes 5 and 6, and lanes 7 and 8) were incubated at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 200 μm forskolin for 20 min (A, lanes 3 and 9), 200 μm epinephrine for 1 min (A, lanes 4 and 10), and 5 mm br-cAMP (a specific PKA activator) for 20 min (A, lanes 2 and 8; B, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). Lu gp phosphorylation was analyzed by autoradiography after immunoprecipitation and was quantified by KODAK ID Image analysis software. The phosphorylation stimulation factor represents the level of activation of Lu gp phosphorylation in the presence of br-cAMP, forskolin, or epinephrine. Western blots performed with 603 anti-Lu/B-CAM (A) or 602 anti-Lu (B) rabbit polyclonal antibodies showed equal amounts of Lu gp immunoprecipitated from each cell line in the presence or absence of br-cAMP, forskolin, or epinephrine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GSK-3β and CKII Phosphorylate Lu gp at Serines 596 and 598 —We also examined the phosphorylation of Lu gp by CKII and GSK-3β in K562 and MDCK cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, S621A (lane 3) as well as SS596–598AA (lane 5) mutants remained phosphorylated in the absence of additional stimuli, in both cell types. In addition, phosphorylation was abolished for the triple mutant SSS596–598-621AAA (lanes 7 and 8), indicating that CKII and/or GSK-3β and PKA sites were functional and that no additional phosphorylation sites are involved. Altogether, these results indicated that Ser-596 and/or Ser-598 may be used by GSK-3β and/or CKII.Since GSK-3β and CKII sites are overlapping and neither specific activators nor inhibitors of these enzymes could be used in our cellular models, we also performed phosphorylation reactions using recombinant fusion proteins GST-Lu, GST-Lu(v13), GST-Lu mutants, [γ-32P]ATP, and purified kinases. As shown in Fig. 3A, the cytoplasmic domain of Lu gp (GST-Lu) is clearly a substrate of CKII in contrast to GST-Lu(v13) or GST alone as only GST-Lu is phosphorylated by this enzyme. It is known that GSK-3β requires a primed phosphopeptide for optimal activity with some substrates, i.e. a sequence that carries a phosphate group in the vicinity of the consensus motif (32Lickert H. Bauer A. Kemler R. Stappert J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5090-5095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, phosphorylation of Lu gp by GSK-3β requires the prephosphorylation of Lu gp by CKII since it can"
https://openalex.org/W2010454617,"RalA and RalB constitute a family of highly similar Ras-related GTPases widely distributed in different tissues. Recently, active forms of Ral proteins have been shown to bind to the exocyst complex, implicating them in the regulation of cellular secretion. Since RalA is present on the plasma membrane in neuroendocrine chromaffin and PC12 cells, we investigated the potential role of RalA in calcium-regulated exocytotic secretion. We show here that endogenous RalA is activated during exocytosis. Expression of the constitutively active RalA (G23V) mutant enhances secretagogue-evoked secretion from PC12 cells. Conversely, expression of the constitutively inactive GDP-bound RalA (G26A) or silencing of the RalA gene by RNA interference led to a strong impairment of the exocytotic response. RalA was found to co-localize with phospholipase D1 (PLD1) at the plasma membrane in PC12 cells. We demonstrate that cell stimulation triggers a direct interaction between RalA and ARF6-activated PLD1. Moreover, reduction of endogenous RalA expression level interfered with the activation of PLD1 observed in secretagogue-stimulated cells. Finally, using various RalA mutants selectively impaired in their ability to activate downstream effectors, we show that PLD1 activation is essential for the activation of secretion by GTP-loaded RalA. Together, these results provide evidence that RalA is a positive regulator of calcium-evoked exocytosis of large dense core secretory granules and suggest that stimulation of PLD1 and consequent changes in plasma membrane phospholipid composition is the major function RalA undertakes in calcium-regulated exocytosis.

RalA and RalB constitute a family of proteins within the Ras branch of monomeric GTPases (1Chardin P. Tavitian A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). They are highly similar, sharing over 85% amino acid sequence identity, and display a widespread overlapping tissue distribution (2Bhullar R.P. Yang S. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 179: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Like most Ras family GTPases, Ral proteins have been implicated in the regulation of various cell biological processes, including oncogenic transformation, endocytosis, and actin-cytoskeleton dynamics (3Feig L.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 419-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Ral proteins have the potential to be activated by many different extracellular signals. One of the best known Ral-activating pathways is via Ral-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors that become activated by binding GTP-bound Ras in response to many types of upstream signals, including almost all tyrosine kinase receptors and several G-protein-linked receptors (3Feig L.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 419-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 4Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 5Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). However, Ras-independent mechanisms of Ral activation occur as well. For instance, in platelets and in fibroblasts, elevation of intracellular calcium levels directly induces Ral activation without a contribution of Ras (6Hofer F. Berdeaux R. Martin G.S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The small GTPase Rap has been also identified as a Ral activator under some conditions (7Wolthuis R.M. Franke B. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Ral interacts with several protein effectors through two protein-protein interaction sites. The first binds phospholipase D1 (PLD1) 1The abbreviations used are: PLD, phospholipase D; siRNA, small interference RNA; shRNA, small hairpin RNA; GH, growth hormone. via an N-terminal 11-amino acid sequence. Ral weakly stimulates PLD1 activity but operates synergistically with small GTPases of the ARF family (8Luo J.Q. Liu X. Frankel P. Rotunda T. Ramos M. Flom J. Jiang H. Feig L.A. Morris A.J. Kahn R.A.

The second is an effector-binding loop, which mediates interaction with Ral-binding protein 1 (RalBP1, also known as RLIP76) and filamin. RalBP1 was the first Ral effector to be identified and was originally distinguished by its GTPase-activating protein domain, which has the potential to regulate Rac and Cdc42 GTPases negatively (10Cantor S.B. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4578-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 11Park S.H. Weiberg R.A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2349-2355PubMed Google Scholar, 12Jullien-Flores V.

Filamin is an actin cross-linking protein that mediates filopodia formation (13Ohta Y. Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). More recently, Ral was found associated in a GTP-dependent manner with the mammalian exocyst (14Brymora A. Valova V.A. Larsen M.R.

Several evidence support the idea that Ral proteins are intimately linked to vesicular trafficking events at the plasma membrane. First, RalBP1 regulates recycling of epidermal growth factor and insulin receptors by interacting with epsin homology domain proteins involved in endocytosis (20Yamaguchi A. Urano T. Goi T. Feig L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31230-31234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Ikeda M. Ishida O. Hinoi T. Kishida S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 1999; 253: 186-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). RalBP1 also binds to the AP2 adaptor complex (23Jullien-Flores V. Mahe Y. Mirey G. Leprince C. Meunier-Bisceuil B. Sorkin A. Camonis J.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2837-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which plays a key role in clathin-mediated endocytosis. Second, Ral has been shown to participate in receptor-mediated endocytosis through a process that involves PLD (24Shen Y. Xu L. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Third, activated Ral proteins have been implicated in the targeting of Golgi-derived vesicles to the basolateral membrane in epithelial cells (15Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 25Shipitsin M. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5746-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This possibility arose from the discovery that two subunits of the exocyst complex are downstream binding partners of active RalA and RalB (14Brymora A. Valova V.A. Larsen M.R. Roufogalis B.D. Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29792-29797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 15Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat.

Chem. 2003; 278: 51743-51748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, the exocyst directs targeting of secretory vesicles to sites of rapid membrane growth (17Terbush D.R. Maurice T. Roth D. Novick P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6483-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Consistent with a function in membrane addition, the analogous mammalian complex has been found at the tight junctions of epithelial cells, where it has been implicated in basolateral secretion (15Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 27Grindstaff K.K. Yeaman C. Anandasabapathy N. Hsu S.C. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Scheller R.H. Nelson W.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 731-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) and in axonal growth cones of developing neurons (28Hazuka C.D. Foletti D.L. Hsu S.C. Kee Y. Hopf F.W. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1324-1334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, by promoting assembly of the exocyst complex (26Moskalenko S. Tong C. Rosse C. Camonis J. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51743-51748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), Ral proteins have been proposed to regulate exocyst-mediated vesicle delivery to appropriate fusion sites at the plasma membrane. Release of hormones and neurotransmitters occurs through a specialized form of exocytosis that is tightly regulated in time and space by extracellular signals and cytosolic calcium levels. The presence of Ral proteins at high levels on synaptic vesicles (29Ngsee J.K. Elferink L.A. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2675-2680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Bielinski D.F. Pyun H.Y. Linko-Stentz K. Macara I.G. Fine R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 246-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and secretory granules in platelets (31Mark B.L. Jilkina O. Bhullar R.P. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) has led to the speculation that Ral may play a role in calcium-regulated exocytosis. Hence, a role for Ral in a regulatory aspect of neurotransmitter release has been identified through the analysis of neuronal tissue from transgenic mice expressing a dominant inhibitory form of RalA (32Polzin A. Shipitsin M. Goi T. Feig L.A. Turner T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1714-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Release of glutamate from isolated synaptic endings after depolarization was found normal in the transgenic mice, but protein kinase C-mediated enhancement of glutamate secretion was suppressed. This suggested the participation of Ral in some forms of synaptic plasticity linked to the recruitment of synaptic vesicles but not in neuronal exocytosis per se. In neuroendocrine PC12 cells, Ral proteins have been implicated in exocytosis by regulating the assembly of exocyst complexes (15Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). However, a recent report by Wang et al. (33Wang L. Li G. Sugita S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19875-19881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) indicates that RalA plays its exocyst-mediated function in GTP-dependent but not in calcium-dependent exocytosis. Thus, the participation and precise function of Ral proteins in calcium-regulated secretion remains unclear. In chromaffin cells, we previously reported the presence of RalA on the plasma membrane, whereas RalB resided on some intracellular vesicles that were distinct from catecholamine-containing secretory granules (34Gasman S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Popoff M.R. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4763-4771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation led us to further explore the role of RalA in the calcium-regulated exocytotic process. In the present paper, we show that RalA is a positive regulator of dense core granule exocytosis. Moreover, we obtained a series of results indicating that ARF6-regulated PLD1, present on the plasma membrane and implicated in the late stages of exocytosis (35Vitale N. Caumont A.S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Du G. Wu S. Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Bader M.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 36Vitale N. Chasserot-Golaz S. Bailly Y. Morinaga N. Frohman M.A. Bader M.F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), participates in the downstream pathway by which RalA promotes calcium-regulated exocytosis. Plasmids and Small Interference RNA (siRNA)—RalA wild type and variants were as previously described (15Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and were expressed in PC12 cells using pRK5. The sequence encoding the Ral-binding domain of RalBP1/RLIP76 (amino acids 403-499) was inserted as a BamHI-EcoRI fragment into pRK5-Myc. Recombinant HA-ARF6 proteins were expressed in PC12 cells as described (36Vitale N. Chasserot-Golaz S. Bailly Y. Morinaga N. Frohman M.A. Bader M.F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The PLD1-nonresponsive HA-ARF6(N48I) mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Its nucleotide exchange activity, activation by ARNO, and inactivation by an ARF6-GAP; intracellular distribution when expressed in PC12 cells; and in vitro effect on PLD1 activity were characterized and previously described (36Vitale N. Chasserot-Golaz S. Bailly Y. Morinaga N. Frohman M.A. Bader M.F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Rat RalA cDNA fragments encoding the 19-nucleotide siRNA sequence (AAGGCAGGTTTCTGTAGAA) derived from the target transcript and separated from its reverse 19-nucleotide complement by a short spacer were annealed and cloned in front of the H1-RNA promoter from the pSuper vector (37Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). The specificity of the sequence was verified by BLAST search against the gene data bank. For mammalian expression vectors encoding both small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) and growth hormone (GH), a cassette containing the H1-RNA promoter and the silencing sequence was amplified by PCR as described previously (38Waselle L. Coppola T. Fukuda M. Iezzi M. El-Amraoui A. Petit C. Regazzi R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 10: 4103-4113Crossref Google Scholar) and subcloned within the HindIII and XbaI sites of pXGH5 (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA). The empty vector with no siRNA sequence was named pGHsuper. To estimate the silencing effect, the RalA-shRNA plasmid was electroporated (260 V, 1050 microfarads, for 17 ms) in 107 PC12 cells, and 72 h post-transfection, cells were used for Western blot and immunofluorescence experiments. The transfection efficiency under these conditions was measured by counting GH-positive cells and was found to be 53% (432 of 815) for pGHsuper and 55% (541 of 983) for RalA-shRNA. Chromaffin Cell Culture and Subcellular Fractionation—Chromaffin cells were isolated from fresh bovine adrenal glands by retrograde perfusion with collagenase, purified on self-generating Percoll gradients, and maintained in culture as previously described (39Bader M.F. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Ahnert-Hilger G. Gratzl M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5777-5783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunocytochemistry, cells were cultured on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/12-mm plate. In some experiments, cells were homogenized in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors and then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 45 min (40Chasserot-Golaz S. Vitale N. Sagot I.

The supernatant was saved (cytosol), and the pellet was resuspended in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 75 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaN3, and 0.5% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors. After centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 45 min, the supernatant (Triton X-100-soluble fraction) and the pellet (Triton X-100-insoluble fraction) were saved and solubilized in sample buffer for gel electrophoresis (40Chasserot-Golaz S.

Culture, Transfection, and Growth Hormone (GH) Release from PC12 Cells—PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glucose (4500 mg/liter) and containing 30 mm NaHCO3, 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Mammalian expression vectors were introduced into PC12 cells together with the GH plasmid pXGH5 (6-well dishes, 80% confluent, 4 μg/well of each plasmid) using GenePorter (Gene Therapy Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 5 h of incubation at 37 °C, 2 ml of culture medium containing fetal bovine serum, horse serum, and antibiotics was added. GH release experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. PC12 cells were washed twice with Locke's solution and then incubated for 10 min with calcium-free Locke's solution (basal release) or stimulated with an elevated K+ solution (Locke's containing 59 mm KCl and 85 mm NaCl). The supernatant was collected, and the cells were harvested by scraping in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline. The amounts of GH secreted into the medium and retained in the cells were measured using a radioimmunoassay kit (Nichols Institute). The amount of GH secretion is expressed as a percentage of total GH present in the cells before stimulation. GH release experiments were performed on at least three different cell cultures. In the figures that are representative of a typical experiment, data are given as the mean of triplicate determinations performed on the same cell preparation ± S.E. Assay for PLD Activity—Transfected PC12 cells were washed twice with Locke's solution and then incubated for 10 min with calcium-free Locke's solution (basal release) or stimulated with an elevated K+ solution (Locke's containing 59 mm KCl and 85 mm NaCl). Medium was replaced with 100 μl of ice-cold Tris (50 mm, pH 8.0), and cells were broken by three freeze and thaw cycles. Samples were collected, mixed with an equal amount of the Amplex Red reaction buffer (Amplex Red Phospholipase D assay kit, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and the PLD activity was estimated after a 1-h incubation at 37 °C with a Mithras (Berthold) fluorimeter. A standard curve was performed with purified PLD from Streptomyces chromofuscus (Sigma). In Fig. 4D, data are given as the mean of six determinations performed on the same cell preparation ± S.E. Similar results were obtained on four different cell preparations. Antibodies and Immunofluorescence—The following antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-RalA and rabbit polyclonal anti-RalB (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); polyclonal anti-PLD1 raised in rabbits against the N-terminal domain of PLD1 (QCB, BIOSOURCE International, France); monoclonal anti-SNAP-25 antibodies (Sternberger Monoclonals Inc., Lutherville, MD); monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (Babco, Richmond, CA); monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies (Novocostra Laboratories); polyclonal anti-GH (Dr. A. F. Parlow, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD); Alexa-488-anti-mouse and Alexa-555-anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes). Rabbit polyclonal anti-chromogranin A antibodies were prepared in our laboratory (41Ehrhart M. Grube D. Bader M.F. Aunis D. Gratzl M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1986; 34: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For immunocytochemistry, chromaffin or PC12 cells on coated glass coverslips were fixed and immunostained as described previously (35Vitale N. Caumont A.S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Du G. Wu S. Sciorra V.A.

Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1217-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Stained cells were visualized with a Zeiss confocal microscope LSM 510. Using the Zeiss CLSM instrument software 3.2, the amount of RalA labeling was measured and expressed as the average fluorescence intensity multiplied by the corresponding surface area and divided by the total surface of each cell. This allows a quantitative cell-to-cell comparison of the RalA immunoreactivity detected in cells. Immunoprecipitation—PC12 cells transfected with pXS-HA-ARF6 or pXS-HA-ARF6(N48I) were maintained in Locke's solution or stimulated with 59 mm K+. Cells were then lysed, and ARF6 proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies and protein A-Sepharose beads as described (36Vitale N. Chasserot-Golaz S. Bailly Y. Morinaga N. Frohman M.A. Bader M.F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). GTP-bound RalA was specifically pulled down using the Myc-RBD (Ral-binding domain) of Ral-binding protein 1 (RalBP1). Therefore, PC12 cells expressing Myc-RBD were maintained under resting conditions or stimulated for various periods of time with 59 mm K+. Cells were then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and mammalian protease inhibitors) (Sigma). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and Myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant of each sample using agarose-coupled mouse anti-Myc IgG. Precipitated proteins were resolved on 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and immunoblotted with anti-Myc (1:500) and anti-RalA (1:1000) antibodies. Blots were processed using the “Western-Light Plus” chemiluminescent detection system (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Intracellular Distribution of RalA in Resting and Stimulated Chromaffin and PC12 Cells—We investigated the intracellular distribution of native RalA in cultured chromaffin cells by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. As illustrated in Fig. 1, RalA was restricted to the cell periphery. Double labeling with antibodies against the plasma membrane marker SNAP25 or against the chromaffin granule protein chromogranin A (CGA) indicated its association with the plasma membrane but not with the membrane of secretory granules (Fig. 1A). Endogenous RalA was similarly present at the plasma membrane in the chromaffin cell tumor derivatives, PC12 cells (see Fig. 6A). Next, we compared the distribution of RalA in resting and secretagogue-stimulated cells. Stimulation of chromaffin cells with nicotine (Fig. 1B) or stimulation of PC12 cells with a depolarizing concentration of potassium (59 mm K+) (Fig. 6A) reduced the level of peripheral RalA immunoreactivity by ∼85% without apparently increasing it in the cytosol or in other intracellular compartments. One possible explanation for this observation is that the monoclonal antibody recognized an epitope that was masked in stimulated cells due to the formation of a RalA-protein complex.Fig. 6RalA interacts with ARF6-activated PLD1 in stimulated PC12 cells. A, PC12 cells were transfected with the GFP-PLD1 expression plasmid alone or in combination with wild-type RalA. 48 h after transfection, cells were incubated for 10 min in Locke's solution (R) or stimulated with Locke containing 59 mm K+ (S). Cells were then fixed, and endogenous or overexpressed RalA was visualized by immunocytochemistry using anti-RalA antibodies and Alexa-555-conjugated secondary antibodies. In the merge images, the yellow-orange staining reveals areas where GFP-PLD1 and RalA co-localize. Masks represent the region of co-localization obtained by selecting the double-labeled pixels. Bars, 5 μm. B, PC12 cells expressing ARF6-HA or ARF6(N48I)-HA were incubated for 10 min in either Locke's solution (R) or in 59 mm K+ (S). Cells were scraped, and HA-tagged ARF6 proteins were immunoprecipitated. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis and Western blotting using anti-ARF6, anti-PLD1, and anti-RalA antibodies. Similar observations were obtained from two different cell preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Subcellular fractionation experiments were performed on chromaffin cell homogenates to separate the cytosol, the Triton X-100-soluble fraction representing the membrane-bound compartment, and the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction representing the cytoskeleton and some detergent-resistant lipid microdomains. RalA was primarily detected in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction (Fig. 1C), suggesting that its presence in the cell periphery was most likely due to a binding to the plasma membrane rather than to an association with the actin filaments concentrated in the subplasmalemmal region. The distribution of RalA in the fractions prepared from nicotine-stimulated cells remained largely unchanged except for a slight increase detected in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results suggest that RalA resides at the plasma membrane in resting cells. Since the protein was hardly detectable in stimulated cells, we concluded that RalA might be engaged in a putative complex with a regulator/effector protein formed in response to secretagogue-evoked stimulation. Secretagogue-evoked Stimulation Activates RalA in PC12 Cells—To probe the role of RalA in the control of dense core granule exocytosis, we first investigated whether RalA might be activated in response to a secretagogue that triggers exocytosis. Therefore, PC12 cells were maintained under resting conditions or stimulated for various periods of time with 59 mmK+, and RalA activation was assessed using the Ral-binding domain of RalBP1 (Myc-RBD) as a bait to trap the endogenous GTPase in its GTP-bound form (Fig. 2). We found that the amount of GTP-bound RalA is relatively low in resting cells. However, 2-10 min of stimulation with 59 mm K+ increased the level of cellular RalA-GTP by 3-10-fold, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). Importantly, RalA-GTP rapidly decreased to basal levels as cells returned to the resting condition, revealing a tight coupling between membrane depolarization and RalA activation. Since the immediate consequence of membrane depolarization is calcium influx and secretion, these findings indicate that RalA activation is triggered by a rise in cytosolic calcium and thereby accompanies the exocytotic process. RalA Regulates Exocytosis of Large Dense Core Secretory Granules in PC12 Cells—To establish that RalA plays a role in exocytosis, we first examined the effect of expressing the Ral-binding domain of RalBP1 (Myc-RBD) in PC12 cells using growth hormone as a reporter for exocytosis (35Vitale N. Caumont A.S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Du G. Wu S. Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Bader M.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This protein fragment specifically binds to activated Ral-GTP and thereby interferes through competitive association with the ability of endogenous Ral proteins to interact with and stimulate effector molecules. As shown in Fig. 3, expression of Myc-RBD did not affect cell viability or GH"
https://openalex.org/W2050342642,"The hepatitis C virus NS2/3 protease is responsible for cleavage of the viral polyprotein between nonstructural proteins NS2 and NS3. We show here that mutation of three highly conserved residues in NS2 (His952, Glu972, and Cys993) abrogates NS2/3 protease activity and that introduction of any of these mutations into subgenomic NS2-5B replicons results in complete inactivation of NS2/3 processing and RNA replication in both stable and transient replication assays. The effect of uncleaved NS2 on the various activities of NS3 was therefore explored. Unprocessed NS2 had no significant effect on the in vitro ATPase and helicase activities of NS3, whereas immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated a decreased affinity of NS4A for uncleaved NS2/3 as compared with NS3. This subsequently resulted in reduced kinetics in an in vitro NS3 protease assay with the unprocessed NS2/3 protein. Interestingly, NS3 was still capable of efficient processing of the polyprotein expressed from a subgenomic replicon in Huh-7 cells in the presence of uncleaved NS2. Notably, we show that fusion with NS2 leads to the rapid degradation of NS3, whose activity is essential for RNA replication. Finally, we demonstrate that uncleaved NS2/3 degradation can be prevented by the addition of a proteasome inhibitor. We therefore propose that NS2/3 processing is a critical step in the viral life cycle and is required to permit the accumulation of sufficient NS3 for RNA replication to occur. The regulation of NS2/3 cleavage could constitute a novel mechanism of switching between viral RNA replication and other processes of the hepatitis C virus life cycle.

It is estimated that nearly 200 million individuals worldwide are currently infected with HCV. Of particular concern is that the virus establishes a chronic infection in ∼85% of cases and that there are no specific and broadly effective anti-HCV compounds to date (3Hoofnagle J.H.

It encodes a single polypeptide of ∼3000 amino acids that is cleaved co- and post-translationally into both structural (core, E1, E2, and p7) and nonstructural (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) proteins (reviewed in Ref. 6Reed K.E.

Host signal peptidases are responsible for cleaving the structural proteins, whereas two virally encoded proteases (NS2/3 and NS3) process the nonstructural proteins required for viral replication. NS3 is a serine protease that mediates the cis-cleavage at the NS3/4A site as well as the trans-cleavage of NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B (7Bartenschlager R. Ahlborn-Laake L. Mous J. Jacobsen H. J.

Although much work has focused on the elucidation of the function of both the protease and helicase domains of NS3, the role of the NS2/3 protease remains to be extensively characterized. NS2/3 is an autocatalytic protease that is responsible for the intramolecular cleavage of NS2 and NS3 at amino acids 1026-1027 (15Grakoui A. McCourt D.W. Wychowski C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. Proc.

Virol. 1993; 67: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Encoded by NS2 and the N-terminal third of NS3, NS2/3 extends from amino acids 810 to 1206, with a minimal region required for activity beginning at amino acid 907 (17Pallaoro M. Lahm A. Biasiol G. Brunetti M. Nardella C. Orsatti L. Bonelli F. Orru S. Narjes F. Steinkuhler C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9939-9946Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although NS2/3 cleavage does not require NS3 protease activity, the protease domain of NS3 cannot be substituted for another protein, suggesting that it plays a structural role in the folding of the NS2/3 enzyme (15Grakoui A.

No homology between NS2/3 and other proteases has been identified, and the catalytic mechanism of action remains unclear. Although the observation that NS2/3 activity is stimulated by zinc and inhibited by EDTA has led some groups to suggest that NS2/3 is a novel metalloprotease, others have proposed that it may function as a cysteine protease, and studies performed with classical protease inhibitors have not yielded a definite classification (17Pallaoro M.

Mutagenesis studies have identified His952 and Cys993 within NS2 as being essential for NS2/3 protease activity (15Grakoui A. McCourt D.W. Wychowski C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4127-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, molecular chaperones have been proposed to be required for efficient cleavage at the NS2/3 site (22Waxman L.

Although NS3 3′-untranslated region (UTR) replicons have been shown to replicate efficiently in Huh-7 cells in the absence of NS2 (26Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar), NS2/3 activity has been shown to be essential for productive replication in vivo, as demonstrated by an HCV clone devoid of NS2/3 protease activity that failed to establish productive infection in a chimpanzee (27Kolykhalov A.A. Mihalik K. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2046-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In this study, we further investigated the role of NS2/3 cleavage in viral replication using the replicon system. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of NS2/3 autoprocessing for RNA replication. The ability of uncleaved NS2/3 to perform the various NS3 catalytic functions was therefore examined to determine the mechanism by which unprocessed NS2/3 could interfere with viral RNA replication. We show that the protease, ATPase, and helicase functions of NS3 are not significantly affected by uncleaved NS2, but that the presence of NS2 leads to rapid degradation of the NS3 protein, possibly constituting for the virus a novel mechanism of regulating viral RNA replication. Strains and Constructs—To generate an adapted NS2 3′-UTR genotype 1b replicon (pNeo/2-5B), a PmeI-BsrGI fragment from I389neo/NS2-3′/wt (26Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar) was inserted into adapted replicon pFK-Neo/3-3′/5.1 (28Krieger N. Lohmann V. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4614-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). To construct NS2/3 mutants, DNA fragments representing amino acids 806-1106 were generated from this template by overlapping PCRs using synthetic oligonucleotide primers for insertion of the mutations. The resulting DNA was digested with SnaBI and BsrGI and then ligated back into the corresponding site of pNeo/2-5B to create pNeo/2-5B/WT (where WT is wild-type), pNeo/2-5B/H952A, pNeo/2-5B/E972A, and pNeo/2-5B/C993A. For in vitro translated constructs, a 2-FLAG tag (referred to as 2xF) was generated with overlapping oligonucleotide annealing, digested, and ligated into the HindIII-BamHI fragment of pcDNA3. DNA containing NS2/3 (amino acids 810-1657) and NS3 (amino acids 1027-1657) was amplified from the replicon constructs and ligated into the EcoRI-XhoI fragment of pcDNA3-2xF to generate 2xF-NS2/3 and 2xF-NS3. A DNA fragment containing NS4A was amplified by PCR from pNeo/2-5B, digested, and ligated into the BsrGI-XhoI sites of 2xF-NS2/3 and 2xF-NS3 to form 2xF-NS2/3/4A and 2xF-NS3/4A, respectively. NS2/3 protease mutants were generated by inserting a BsiWI-BsrGI fragment (amino acids 947-1100) from pNeo/2-5B replicon constructs containing the NS2/3 mutations into the BsiWI-BsrGI site of the 2xF-NS2/3/4A construct to form 2xF-NS2/3/4A H952A, E972A, and C993A. For bacterial expression constructs, NS2/3-(904-1206) and NS3-(1027-1206) were amplified from pNeo/2-5B. An N-terminal His6 tag was included in the synthetic oligonucleotide primer to facilitate downstream purification. The DNA was then inserted into a pET11d vector via XhoI-BamHI sites that were included in the oligonucleotide primers used in the amplification.

The replicon harbors adaptive mutations E1202G, T1280I, and K1846T (numbers refer to the amino acid positions of the polyprotein from the Con1 isolate (GenBank™ accession number AJ242654). Plasmid pFK-repPI-luc/NS2-3′/GND, which is replication-deficient due to an Asp-to-Asn substitution in the active center of the NS5B polymerase at position 2737 of the polyprotein, was generated by replacing the NS5B region in pFK-repPI-luc/NS2-3′/ET with a corresponding fragment from plasmid pFK-I341-spPI-luc-EI3420-9605/GND (30Friebe P. Lohmann V. Krieger N. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12047-12057Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) using an XhoI restriction site within NS5A and an SpeI restriction site directly adjacent to the 3′-UTR. Mutation H952A was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis in a PCR; the PCR fragment containing the mutation was introduced into pFK-repPI-luc/NS2-3′/ET using BsiWI and BsrGI restriction sites to obtain pFK-repPI-luc/NS2-3′/H952A. E972A, C993A, and S977A as well as double mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis of an NS2/3 fragment into pNEB193 using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and then ligated into pFK-repPI-luc/NS2-3′/ET using BsiWI and BsrGI restriction sites. In all cases, correct insertion of mutations and fidelity of DNA sequence were verified by sequencing. In Vitro Transcription and Purification of RNA—Circular DNA plasmids were linearized with XbaI for the 2xF expression constructs, with ScaI for the pNeo/2-5B replicon constructs, and with AseI-ScaI for the pFK-repPI-luc/NS2-3′ replicon constructs and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction. DNA was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase using a Megascript kit (Ambion Inc.) following the manufacturer's suggested protocol; template DNA was removed by digestion with DNase I; and the RNA was purified by passing through a column using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc.) and dissolved in RNase-free water. The RNA concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm, and RNA integrity was checked by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. Cell Culture—Huh-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin, 100 μg of streptomycin, and 100 μm nonessential amino acids. A Huh-7 clone cured with selective inhibitor cells was used for transient replication assays (31Friebe P. Boudet J. Simorre J.P. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 380-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Electroporation of Replicons and G418 Selection—Subconfluent Huh-7 cells were electroporated with RNA (10 μg) and selected with G418 as described previously (32Lohmann V. Korner F. Dobierzewska A. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1437-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Four weeks after transfection, colonies were stained with Coomassie Blue. Transient Replication Assays with Luciferase Replicons—Transient replication assays were performed as described previously (29Lohmann V. Hoffmann S. Herian U. Penin F. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3007-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) with several modifications. In brief, 1 μg of RNA was mixed with 400 μl of cured Huh-7 cells (107 cells/ml in Cytomix (33van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) containing 2 mm ATP and 5 mm glutathione), electroporated as described, immediately transferred to 12 ml of complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and seeded into 6-well plates. Cells were harvested 4, 24, 48, and 72 h after electroporation. For luciferase activity assays, cells were scraped from the plate with 350 μl of luciferase lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm glycylglycine (pH 7.8), 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)). Cleared lysate (100 μl) was mixed with 360 μl of luciferase assay buffer (25 mm glycylglycine, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, and 15 mm K2PO4 (pH 7.8)) and measured for 20 s in a Lumat LB9507 luminometer (Berthold Technologies) after the addition of 200 μlof200 μm luciferin solution. Values obtained with cells harvested after 4 h were used to correct for transfection efficiency. Immunoblotting—For Western blot analysis, 20 μg of RNA was electroporated as described above for transient replication assays, and cells were seeded into 10-cm plates. Cells were harvested by scraping the cells of the plate in phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged, and lysis was performed by resuspension of the pellet in 5% SDS and multiple passages of the cells through the tip of a 21-gauge needle. Following quantitation using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), total cellular proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membrane blocking and antibody dilutions were performed in 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 for NS3 or luciferase (Chemicon International, Inc.) detection and in 2% milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20 for NS5B analysis. For antibody detection, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences) and anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) secondary antibodies and Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used. To ensure equal loading of lanes, a nonspecific band present on all membranes was used as an internal control. Proteasome Inhibitor Treatment—Cells were electroporated as described above for Western blot assays. Four hours after plating, cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 (Sigma) or vehicle control (dimethyl sulfoxide) for an additional 4 or 20 h. Cells were then processed for Western blot analysis as described above. Immunoprecipitation of in Vitro Translated NS2/3/4A Mutants and NS3/4A—Purified RNA was translated for 90 min at 30 °C in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Redivue Pro-mix, Amersham Biosciences) using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) following the manufacturers' suggested protocols. Lysates were then incubated with Ezview Red ANTI-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.7), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Following centrifugation at 8200 × g for 30 s, beads were washed three times with 1 ml of cold immunoprecipitation buffer. Immunoprecipitated protein was eluted from the beads with 3X Flag peptide (final concentration of 150 ng/μl; Sigma). Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Relative band intensity was measured using a Fuji BAS-2000 PhosphorImager. ATPase and Helicase Assays—NS3 ATPase assays were performed based on the colorimetric method described by Chan et al. (34Chan K.M. Delfert D. Junger K.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) and Kyono et al. (35Kyono K. Miyashiro M. Taguchi I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Equimolar concentrations of in vitro translated and immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged proteins were mixed with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.04 μg/μl poly(U), and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 mm ATP. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 30 min, and the quantity of released phosphate was determined by the addition of 4 volumes of a malachite green/molybdate/polyvinyl alcohol reagent prepared as described by Chan et al. (34Chan K.M. Delfert D. Junger K.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). The absorbance of the colored complex was measured at 630 nm on a SPECTROmax Plus 384 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Inc.), and the amount of phosphate present was determined using a standard curve obtained using potassium dihydrogen phosphate solutions of known concentration. NS3 helicase activity was measured based on methods followed by Gallinari et al. (14Gallinari P. Brennan D. Nardi C. Brunetti M. Tomei L. Steinkuhler C. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6758-6769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a DNA probe developed by Pang et al. (36Pang P.S. Jankowsky E. Planet P.J. Pyle A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1168-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Briefly, an 18-bp release strand oligonucleotide was labeled at the 5′-end using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and purified by passing through a Sephadex G-25 column. Annealing to a partially complementary 36-bp strand was performed by heating the labeled and unlabeled strands in a 1:3 ratio to 95 °C for 2 min, followed by slow equilibration to room temperature in 10 mm Tris (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl. Unwinding was measured by preincubating immunoprecipitated proteins in 25 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7), 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin for 10 min with 1.25 fmol/μl labeled probe. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 4 mm ATP and allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2× stop buffer (50 mm EDTA (pH 8), 0.8% SDS, 0.04% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, and 0.4 mg/ml bromphenol blue) and excess unlabeled release strand. The reaction products were run on a 20% polyacrylamide gel, visualized by autoradiography, and quantified by phosphorimaging. Enzyme Expression and Purification—NS3-(1027-1206) and NS2/3-(904-1206) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells. Cells were grown at 37 °C to A600 = 0.4-0.5 and, following induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, grown at 37 °C for an additional 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g, and the pellet was stored at -80 °C. Protein was purified and folded as described by Thibeault et al. (19Thibeault D. Maurice R. Pilote L. Lamarre D. Pause A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46678-46684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In brief, cell pellets were thawed at room temperature (21 °C) and sonicated at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT. Following centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the insoluble pellet was homogenized in extraction buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 6 m guanidine HCl, and 0.5 m NaCl) using a glass tissue homogenizer. The supernatant was clarified at 30,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. To purify the protein, the supernatant was mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed twice with extraction buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. Protein was then eluted with 200 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the purified protein were pooled and quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay. NS2/3 and NS3 proteins were folded on a Superose 12 (10/300) column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5 m arginine HCl, 1% N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide, and 5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine as described by Thibeault et al.

NS3 Protease Kinetics—Enzymatic assays and kinetics were performed using a fluorogenic substrate and purified enzyme. Briefly, enzyme activity was determined by monitoring the fluorescence change associated with cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate Ac-Asp-Glu-Asp-(N-iodoacetylaminoethyl-5-naphthylamine-1-sulfonic acid)-Glu-Glu-l-aminobutyryl-l-lactoyl-Ser-Lys-(4-(4-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoyl)-NH2 (Bachem Bioscience Inc., King of Prussia, PA) on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Victor 3 fluorometer (λex = 355 nm and λem = 485 nm). Reactions were performed in black OptiPlate 96-well plates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at room temperature for up to 1 h in assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 0.1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 2 nm enzyme and 10 μm cofactor peptide 4A (KKKGSVVIV-GRIILSGR-NH2; AnaSpec, Inc., San Jose, CA). For kinetic studies, kinetic parameters were calculated from a nonlinear least-squares fit of initial rates as a function of substrate concentration (0.5-16 μm) using GraphPad Prism Version 4.00 assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics. NS2/3 Cleavage Mutants—The catalytic activity of the NS2/3 protease has been demonstrated previously to require His952 and Cys993 (15Grakoui A. McCourt D.W. Wychowski C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M.

Virol. 1993; 67: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One study has also suggested the importance of Glu972 for NS2/3 autoprocessing based on the observation that an E972Q point mutation reduces the catalytic activity of the enzyme (16Hijikata M. Mizushima H. Akagi T. Mori S. Kakiuchi N. Kato N. Tanaka T. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was therefore used to generate point mutations in an NS2/3/4A expression construct to create H952A, E972A, and C993A single mutants (Fig. 1A). As expected, no cleavage with the H952A and C993A mutants was observed upon comparison of the processing of both the wild-type and mutant proteins after in vitro translation in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 2). In addition, the complete absence of NS2 and NS3 cleavage products clearly indicates that Glu972 is also a critical residue necessary for NS2/3 protease activity.Fig. 2Effect of NS2/3 mutations on autoprocessing. Wild-type (WT; lane 1) and mutant (lanes 2-4) 2xF-NS2/3 proteins were translated in vitro in the presence of 35S, and the labeled bands were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 15% gel. The NS2/3, NS3, and NS2 proteins are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cleavage at the NS2/3 Site Is Required for Replication of Subgenomic Replicons—To further investigate the role of NS2/3 protease activity in the replicative capacity of HCV RNA, a series of NS2/3 mutants were generated in the context of an adapted NS2 3′-UTR genotype 1b neomyc"
https://openalex.org/W2050777200,"In this study we showed that the transcriptional regulation of Down syndrome critical region isoform 4 (DSCR1.4) is mediated by the calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway in neural cells. Stimuli that elicit an increase in the intracellular concentrations of calcium, such as membrane depolarization, induced de novo transcription of DSCR1.4, with mRNA expression peaking after 4 h and then declining. Action via the physiologically relevant L-type calcium channel was confirmed by blockade with nifedipine and verapamil. This calcium-dependent transcription of DSCR1.4 was inhibited by the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A and FK506. Deletional analysis showed that the calcium- and calcineurin-dependent activation is mediated by the promoter region between nucleotides –350 and –166, a region that contains putative NFAT-binding motifs. Exogenous NFATc2 potently augmented the DSCR1.4 promoter transcriptional activity, and the involvement of endogenous NFAT signaling pathway in DSCR1.4 transcription was confirmed by the suppression of depolarization-inducible promoter activity with the NFAT inhibitor peptide VIVIT. Exogenous overexpression of DSCR1 protein (calcipressin 1) resulted in the inhibition of the transcription of DSCR1.4 and NFAT-dependent signaling. These findings suggest that calcineurin-dependent induction of DSCR1.4 product may represent an important auto-regulatory mechanism for the homeostatic control of NFAT signaling in neural cells.

Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar). A key element of the cellular response to Ca2+ signals is the action of the phosphatase calcineurin (CN). CN is a Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase that was first discovered in neuronal tissue, where it has its greatest abundance (5Klee C.B. Crouch T.H. Krinks M.H. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 722-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and has since been found in many other tissues (reviewed in Refs. 6Mansuy I.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 1195-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar and 7Martinez-Martinez S. Redondo J.M. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). CN controls a wide variety of physiological processes, such as hippocampal long term potentiation and long term depression, lymphocyte activation and apoptosis, development of the heart, differentiation of skeletal muscle fiber type, and cardiac functions (6Mansuy I.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 1195-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 8Shibasaki F. Hallin U. Uchino H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Signaling pathways controlled by CN have been the most studied in lymphocytes, where the main pathway of action for this phosphatase so far characterized has been the regulation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors (9Crabtree G.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 109 (and references therein): S67-S79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation promotes translocation of NFAT proteins to the nucleus, where they bind specific elements within the target gene promoters, in association with other transcription factors (10Chen L.

The pharmacological action of immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 is based on inhibition of CN in immune effectors cells (14Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3589) Google Scholar). The CN/NFAT pathway can be activated by increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in the central nervous system that regulates the expression of the inositol 3-phosphate receptor and brain-derived neuronal factor genes in neurons (15Genazzani A.A. Carafoli E. Guerini D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5797-5801Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 16Graef I.A. Mermelstein P.G. Stankunas K. Neilson J.R. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W.

Furthermore, CN/NFAT signaling has been shown to be necessary for axonal outgrowth during mouse development (18Graef I.A. Wang F. Charron F. Chen L. Neilson J. Tessier-Lavigne M. Crabtree G.R.

Despite the wide importance of CN/NFAT signaling and its roles in the central nervous system, little is known about the specific genes regulated by this pathway in neural cells. CN signaling is tightly regulated within the cell. Several endogenous cellular CN modulators have been identified, among them AKAP79 (19Kashishian A. Howard M. Loh C. Gallatin W.M. Hoekstra M.F.

The human DSCR1 gene consists of 7 exons, of which exons 1–4 can be alternatively spliced, resulting in a number of different mRNA isoforms. Exons 1 and 4 containing transcripts encode for distinct protein products that differ at their N terminus, giving rise to a 252-amino acid protein, calcipressin 1-L, and a 197-amino acid protein, calcipressin 1-S, respectively (41Genesca L. Aubareda A. Fuentes J.J. Estivill X. De La Luna S. Perez-Riba M. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For the mouse orthologous gene, only isoforms containing equivalent exons 1 and 4 have been detected. These isoforms have different expression patterns and different regulation mechanisms that control their expression. For example, the transcriptional regulation through a calcineurin-dependent pathway is exclusive of an internal promoter placed between exons 3 and 4 that regulates the expression of the DSCR1.4 variant (36Yang J. Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: E61-E68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Very recently it has been described as a down-regulation of the DSCR1 exon 1 promoter via a Notch-dependent pathway (42Mammucari C. di Vignano A.T. Sharov A.A. Neilson J. Havrda M.C. Roop D.R. Botchkarev V.A. Crabtree G.R. Dotto G.P. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 665-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The analysis of the internal promoter, located upstream exon 4, shows a dense cluster of consensus NFAT-binding motifs (36Yang J. Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: E61-E68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, stimulation of the cells with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thrombin, and Ca2+ ionophore induces an up-regulation of the DSCR1.4 mRNA due to an activation of the promoter, through a CN/NFAT-dependent pathway (43Minami T. Horiuchi K. Miura M. Abid M.R. Takabe W. Noguchi N. Kohro T. Ge X. Aburatani H. Hamakubo T. Kodama T. Aird W.C. J. Biol.

However, very little is known about the mechanisms that control the expression of DSCR1 and their role in neural cells. In this work, we have identified the induction of DSCR1.4 mRNA in a screen of candidate genes activated by the CN/NFAT pathway in neural cells in response to stimuli that increase concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ such as membrane depolarization. By using the PC12 cells as a model neural system, we show that de novo DSCR1.4 transcription is induced by these stimuli in a CN/NFAT-dependent manner. We show the existence of a regulation loop that controls NFAT-dependent transcription, suggesting a role in the homeostasis of this signaling pathway in neural cells. Cell Culture and Reagents—Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were maintained under the conditions defined by the ATCC. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 were from Calbiochem. Actinomycin D (ActD), cycloheximide, nifedipine, verapamil, and KCl were all purchased from Sigma. CsA and FK-506 were purchased from Sandoz (East Hannover, NJ) and LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Cell Fractionation and Immunoblot Analysis—Confluent PC12 cells in 100-mm culture dishes were exposed to vehicle or to a specific inhibitor for 1 h and then treated with pharmacological stimuli for different times as indicated under “Results.” After stimulation, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 150 μl of hypotonic buffer A (10 mgm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 2 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin) supplemented with 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.75 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, and 10 mm Na2MO4. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g, and the supernatants, containing the cytosolic extracts, were each mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol. The nuclei-containing pellets were washed twice in hypotonic sample buffer without detergent and lysed for 30 min on ice with occasional mild agitation in 50 μl of hypertonic buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm Na2MO4, 2 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The resulting nuclear protein extract was then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant, containing most of the nuclear proteins, was mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer. For whole-cell extracts, cells grown and stimulated in 35-mm dishes were lysed with 150 μl of hypertonic buffer C and resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer as described above. Extracts were boiled for 5 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (8% polyacrylamide for NFATc2). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes that were then blocked overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) containing 5% (w/v) skimmed milk. The membranes were washed twice with TBS-T and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a 1:3000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antiserum 672, raised against the NH2-53SPPSGPAYPDDVLDYGLK70 peptide (residues 53–70 of human NFATc2), as described previously (48Lara-Pezzi E. Armesilla A.L. Majano P.L. Redondo J.M. Lopez-Cabrera M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7066-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The membranes were then washed four times with TBS-T and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary antibody (peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG, Pierce) and washed four times with TBS-T. Bound antibodies were detected with ECL Western blotting analysis kit (Amersham Biosciences). Nuclear Extracts and EMSA—Nuclear protein extracts were obtained as described above (without dilution in Laemmli buffer); the protein concentration was quantified by the Bradford procedure (BioRad), and the extracts were snap-frozen and stored at –70 °C. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed as follows. Three to five μg of nuclear protein were incubated in a ratio 4:1 with poly(dIdC) on ice for 10 min in a final volume of 18 μl containing 4 μl of 5× DNA binding buffer (10% polyvinylethanol, 12.5% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.00, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT). 2 μl (1 ng/μl) of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (5 × 107–1 × 108 cpm/μg) was then added to this reaction mixture, and the reaction was continued at 4 °C for a further 30 min. The sequence of the oligonucleotide probe used was 5′-gatcGGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATACAGAAGGCGT-3′ (the distal NFAT site from the human IL-2 promoter). The transcription factor binding site is underlined. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (49Armesilla A.L. Lorenzo E. Gomez del Arco P. Martinez-Martinez S. Alfranca A. Redondo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2032-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—PC12 cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. After stimulation, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS and fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v) in PBS. Cells were washed three times with PBS and permeabilized for 10 min with PBS-containing 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100. After three washes with PBS, the fixed cells were blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS (PBS/bovine serum albumin) for 20 min. Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:1500 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antiserum 672. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with the secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in the presence of the nucleic acid dye To-Pro 3 (Molecular Probes). Cells were mounted and analyzed on a LSM510 meta confocal laser microscope (Zeiss, Germany). RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription, and Real Time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from PC12 cells with TriPure isolation reagent (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two μg of the isolated total RNA were reverse-transcribed at 37 °C for 50 min in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 100 ng of random primers, and 40 units of RNase Inhibitor (Invitrogen). The reaction was terminated by denaturing the reverse transcriptase at 95 °C for 5 min, and the samples were stored at –70 °C. Differential gene expression in PC12 cells was assessed by real time quantitative RT-PCR of target genes on a micro-fluidic card assay system developed by Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The card included TaqMan probes and primer sets for the amplification of 24 target genes, thus acting as a low density custom array. RT-PCR was conducted with the TaqMan Universal PCR master mix kit (Applied Biosystems) and the ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Transcripts encoding rat DSCR1 were further quantified by TaqMan real time quantitative RT-PCR. PCR primers and TaqMan probes were obtained from Applied Biosystems and optimized according to the manufacturer's protocol. The probe designed for rat DSCR1.4 (MCIP1.4 mRNA, GenBank™ accession number NM_153724.2) specifically recognizes the cDNA sequence encoding the short form (197 amino acids, splice variant 4 or calcipressin 1-S) of DSCR1 (32Fuentes J.J.

J. 2003; 374: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated in the presence of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) for 2 min at 50 °C followed by 10 min at 95 °C. Reactions were then run over 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The 18 S rRNA transcript was used as an internal control gene and was amplified in the same tube to normalize for variation in input RNA. The amounts of target mRNA in various samples was estimated by the 2–ΔΔCT relative quantification method (50Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (Duluth). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (121148) Google Scholar). Ratios were calculated between the amounts of mRNA from stimulated and nonstimulated control PC12 cells. Values are expressed as the means ± S.D. of a triplicate determination from a representative experiment. A minimum of three independent experiments was conducted.

The GFP CALP1L and GFP CALP1S are calcipressin 1L and calcipressin 1S fused to the N-terminal of the GFP protein; these were gifts from S. de la Luna. The GFP-VIVIT construct encodes an N-terminal fusion of the high affinity calcineurin-binding peptide (VIVIT) to GFP protein as described previously (52Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C.

Plasmid expressing the active calcineurin A, pEF-FLAG-hCnAα-(2–389), was described previously (53Rodriguez A. Martinez-Martinez S. Lopez-Maderuelo M.D. Ortega-Perez I. Redondo J.M. J. Biol.

Null Renilla was from Promega. PC12 cells were plated on 35-mm dishes at 50–60% confluence the day before transfection. For transient transfection the culture medium was replaced with 1 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) without serum, and cells were transfected for 4 h by the Lipofectamine-PLUS method (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 1 μg of plasmid DNA was used per well, comprising plasmids specified in each figure (see figure legends). Individual transfections were made up to 1 μg with empty vector. At the end of the transfection period, media were removed and replaced with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus serum. Twenty four hours later, the cells were exposed to vehicle or inhibitor (CsA, FK506, ActD, verapamil, or nifedipine as specified) for 1 h and then treated with pharmacological stimuli. At the end of treatments, cells were lysed according to the instructions of the luciferase assay kit (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured in a Berthold luminometer. All samples were tested in triplicate, and the results were normalized to a Renilla luciferase internal control by using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega), as specified by the manufacturer. Depolarization Induces NFAT Transcriptional Activity in PC12 Cells—Exposure to high concentrations of KCl, which induces membrane depolarization in PC12 cells, triggers a rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (data not shown). Because NFATc2 is expressed in this cell line (55Ho A.M. Jain J. Rao A. Hogan P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28181-28186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we decided to explore whether depolarization with KCl induced NFAT activity. We first examined NFATc2 protein expression, phosphorylation status, and translocation in KCl-stimulated PC12 cells. Cytosolic and nuclear extracts were first immunoblotted with a polyclonal anti-NFAT"
https://openalex.org/W2080966061,"Type XVIII collagen is important in the early phase of retinal vascular development and for the regression of the primary vasculature in the vitreous body after birth. We show here that the retina in Col18a1-/- mice becomes densely vascularized by anomalous anastomoses from the persistent hyaloid vasculature by day 10 after birth. In situ hybridizations revealed normal VEGF mRNA expression, but the phenotype of collagen XVIII deficient mice closely resembled that of mice expressing VEGF120 and VEGF188 isoforms only, suggesting that type XVIII collagen may be involved in VEGF function. Type XVIII collagen was found to be indispensable for angiogenesis in the eye, as also oxygen-induced neovascularization was less intense than normal in the Col18a1-/- mice. We observed a marked increase in the amount of retinal astrocytes in the Col18a1-/- mice. Whereas the retinal vessels of wild-type mice are covered by astrocytes and the regressing, thin hyaloid vessels are devoid of astrocytes, the retinal vessels in the Col18a1-/- mice were similarly covered by astrocytes but not the persistent hyaloid vessels in the vitreous body. Interestingly, double null mice lacking type XVIII collagen and its homologue type XV collagen had the persistent hyaloid vessels covered by astrocytes, including the parts located in the vitreous body. We thus hypothesize that type XV collagen is a regulator of glial cell recruitment around vessels and that type XVIII collagen regulates their proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2074214160,"In a previous study we have identified Fmc1p, a mitochondrial protein involved in the assembly/stability of the yeast F0F1-ATP synthase at elevated temperatures. The Δfmc1 mutant was shown to exhibit a severe phenotype of very slow growth on respiratory substrates at 37 °C. We have isolated ODC1 as a multicopy suppressor of the fmc1 deletion restoring a good respiratory growth. Odc1p expression level was estimated to be at least 10 times higher in mitochondria isolated from the Δfmc1/ODC1 transformant as compared with wild type mitochondria. Interestingly, ODC1 encodes an oxodicarboxylate carrier, which transports α-ketoglutarate and α-ketoadipate or any other transported tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate in a counter-exchange through the inner mitochondrial membrane. We show that the suppression of the respiratory-growth-deficient fmc1 by the overexpressed Odc1p was not due to a restored stable ATP synthase. Instead, the rescuing mechanism involves an increase in the flux of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate from the cytosol into the mitochondria, leading to an increase in the α-ketoglutarate oxidative decarboxylation, resulting in an increase in mitochondrial substrate-level-dependent ATP synthesis. This mechanism of metabolic bypass of a defective ATP synthase unravels the physiological importance of intramitochondrial substrate-level phosphorylations.

This unexpected result might be of interest for the development of therapeutic solutions in pathologies associated with defects in the oxidative phosphorylation system. In the inner mitochondrial membrane, the F0F1-ATP synthase performs the late step of the oxidative phosphorylations. This hetero-oligomer uses the electrochemical transmembrane proton gradient generated by the respiratory chain to catalyze ATP synthesis from ADP and inorganic phosphate (for reviews, see Refs. 1Pedersen P.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 339-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar and 2Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). It is composed of two distinct domains, a membrane-integrated F0 domain containing a proton channel and a hydrophilic peripheral F1 domain bearing the catalytic sites for ATP synthesis. This enzyme comprises about 20 different subunits for an overall molecular mass approaching 600 kDa. The genes encoding these proteins are located part in the nucleus and part in the mitochondrion itself. The subunits of nuclear origin are synthesized in the cytoplasm and then imported into the mitochondrion (for review, see Ref. 3Truscott K.N. Brandner K. Pfanner N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 326-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), whereas the mitochondrial DNA-encoded subunits are synthesized within the mitochondrion. This genetic compartmentalization makes the assembly of the ATP synthase complex a particularly intricate process. Studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have shown that specific proteins, usually called assembly factors, not belonging to the final complex, are required in the different steps of the enzyme biogenesis. Three such proteins, Atp11p, Atp12p, and Fmc1p, were shown to facilitate the assembly of the ATP synthase F1 component (4Wang Z.G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol.

Similar defects in the assembly of the F1 domain were described in yeast lacking Fmc1p (6Lefebvre-Legendre L. Vaillier J. Benabdelhak H. Velours J. Slonimski P.P. di Rago J.-P. J. Biol.

However, α and β subunits aggregation occurs only when the fmc1 mutant is grown at 37 °C, indicating that Fmc1p is involved in some assembly heat-sensitive step. The precise function of Fmc1p is still unknown. However, interestingly, Δfmc1 mutant is very efficiently rescued by an increase in the expression of Atp12p (6Lefebvre-Legendre L. Vaillier J.

Furthermore, Atp12p was found to accumulate very poorly in Δfmc1 cells grown at 37 °C, indicating that the aggregation of α and β subunits in the Δfmc1 mutant is caused by some failure in Atp12p. The defects in the assembly of the ATP synthase caused by a lack in Atp11p, Atp12p, or Fmc1p severely impair yeast growth on non-fermentable carbon sources (4Wang Z.G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the F1 assembly mutants were also shown to grow very poorly in anaerobic conditions (11Lefebvre-Legendre L. Balguerie A. Duvezin-Caubet S. Giraud M.-F. Slonimski P.P. Di Rago J.-P. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the absence of respiration the F1 ATPase activity is required for a proper energization of the inner mitochondrial membrane and, hence, for a number of essential reactions to take place in the mitochondrion. It is well known that yeast cells exhibiting mitochondrial dysfunctions, such as loss of the mitochondrial genome, loss of tricarboxylic acid cycle activities, or respiration inhibition, undergo through the so-called retrograde regulation profound changes in nuclear genes expression resulting in key metabolic readjustments (for review, see Ref. 12Butow R.A. Avadhani N.G. Moll. Cell. 2004; 14: 1-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). This interorganelle signaling pathway aims at re-supplying mitochondria with intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which cannot operate properly in respiratory-deficient cells. Indeed, succinate cannot be oxidized to fumarate, which limits the production of oxaloacetate, and in turn of α-ketoglutarate, the direct precursor to glutamate. To compensate, the expression of many genes whose products function in anaplerotic pathways that would re-supply mitochondria with oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA, is induced. In addition, the expression of the genes encoding the first three steps of the tricarboxylic acid cycle leading to the production of α-ketoglutarate comes under the control of retrograde-specific regulatory genes, RTG1, RTG2, and RTG3 (13Liu Z. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These nuclear gene expression modifications result in a higher α-ketoglutarate production and, hence, a sufficient glutamate supply in cells harboring dysfunctional mitochondria. However, none of these responses has been reported to rescue the respiratory growth defect caused by mitochondrial dysfunction. In this study we report that the overexpression of Odc1p, the main form of the yeast oxodicarboxylate carrier (14Palmieri L. Agrimi G. Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1916-1922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), can efficiently rescue the respiratory growth defect of the fmc1 mutant. We show that overexpression of Odc1p acts as a metabolic bypass suppressor for the loss of a functional ATP synthase through an increased intra mitochondrial ATP production via substrate-level phosphorylation. We will discuss this unexpected observation in relation to the retrograde metabolic response, which might contribute to the rescuing of the ATP synthase deficiency by Odc1p overexpression.

Gatti D.L. Ackerman S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were a kind gift of S. Ackerman (Detroit). Yeast strains were grown either in complete media, YPGA, YPGALA, and N3 as described in Lefebvre-Legendre et al. (6Lefebvre-Legendre L. Vaillier J. Benabdelhak H. Velours J.

Minimal media were supplemented with 40 μg·ml–1 tryptophan and 20 μg·ml–1 methionine. In all media, adenine was supplemented 60 μg·ml–1. Plasmids—pEMBLye23 was a gift from D. Thomas (Gif-Sur-Yvette). pLL1 is a centromeric plasmid harboring a HindIII-HincII fragment containing FMC1 and its regulatory flanking sequences (6Lefebvre-Legendre L. Vaillier J. Benabdelhak H. Velours J. Slonimski P.P. di Rago J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6789-6796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Plasmids pLL9 and pLL11 were isolated in the Δfmc1 multicopy suppressor screen (see below) and contained two open reading frames, YPL134c and YPL135w. YPL135w was subcloned from pLL11 as a 1612-bp HindIII fragment into pEMBLye23[HindIII]. The resulting plasmid was named pLL14. A StyI-XmaI fragment from pLL11 containing YPL134c was cloned into pFL38L[XbaI-XmaI] to form pLL15 (CEN6). YPL134c was cut out of pLL15 as a KpnI-SphI fragment and inserted into pFL44L to give pLL16 (2 μm). Screen for Multicopy Suppressors of the Null Allele Δfmc1—The Δfmc1 strain, MC6, was transformed with a partial Sau3A digest of yeast chromosomal DNA cloned into the multicopy vector pEMBLye23 (gift from D. Thomas, Gif-Sur-Yvette). About 100,000 transformants were selected on appropriate selective medium and screened for growth on respiratory medium (N3) at 37 °C. After a 5-day incubation, clones exhibiting a good growth were cured of the URA3 plasmids they harbored on glucose-rich medium supplemented with 0.1% 5-fluoroorotic acid and further tested for growth on respiratory medium N3 at 37 °C. When growth in these conditions was found to be plasmid-dependent, the corresponding plasmid was recovered from Escherichia coli and re-tested for suppression of the Δfmc1 phenotype. Confirmed suppressor plasmids pLL9 and pLL11 were further analyzed, and the insert they contained was sequenced. Biochemical Assays—Cells were pre-grown at 28 °C overnight in glucose medium, diluted into CasEG, and further grown for 2 days to enrich the preculture in rho+ cells. They were then used to set up cultures in CasGal, switched to 37 °C, and grown to log phase. Cells were harvested for mitochondrial purification according to the enzymatic procedure described in Guerin et al. (15Guerin B. Labbe P. Somlo M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Frequency of petite colonies was checked for every purification and did not exceed 11%. Protein concentration was measured according to Lowry et al. (16Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome content was estimated as described in Dejean et al. (17Dejean L. Beauvoit B. Guérin B. Rigoulet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1457: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption rates were measured at 28 °C in respiration buffer containing 0.65 m mannitol, 0.36 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-malate, pH 6.8, 3 mm Tris-Pi, pH 6.8, as described in Rigoulet and Guerin (18Rigoulet M. Guerin B. FEBS lett. 1979; 102: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with either 100 mm ethanol or 10 mm α-ketoglutarate as substrate. Transmembrane potential variations (ΔΨ) 1The abbreviations used are: ΔΨ, transmembrane electrical potential; AP5A, P1,P5-di(adenosine 5′)-pentaphosphate; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; WT, wild type. in isolated mitochondria were assayed by monitoring the fluorescence quenching of rhodamine 123 with a Kontron fluorescence spectrophotometer (19Emaus R.K. Grunwald R. Lemasters J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). For ATP synthesis rates mitochondria (0.3 mg·ml–1) were placed in a 1.5-ml thermostatically controlled chamber at 28 °C in respiration buffer. The reaction was started by the addition of respiratory substrate and 2 mm ADP and stopped by 7% perchloric acid, 25 mm EDTA. Samples were then neutralized to pH 6.5 by addition of 2 n KOH, 0.3 m MOPS. ATP was quantified by luciferin/luciferase assay (ThermoLabsystems) on a LKB bioluminometer. Participation of the F0F1-ATP synthase to ATP production was assessed by oligomycin (50 μg·mg of protein–1) addition. Adenylate kinase activity was estimated by comparison of ATP synthesis rates in the presence of oligomycin (50 μg·mg of protein–1), antimycin A (0.5 μg·mg of protein–1), and arsenite (10 mm) with or without addition of adenylate kinase-specific inhibitor AP5A (5 mm). Oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity was measured as described by Somlo (20Somlo M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 5: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were prepared as described in Avéret et al. (21Avéret N. Fitton V. Bunoust O. Rigoulet M. Guerin B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 67-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots were performed as described in Arselin et al. (22Arselin G. Vaillier J. Graves P.V. Velours J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20284-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against Odc1p, a kind gift of L. Palmieri (Bari), were used 1:10,000 (14Palmieri L. Agrimi G. Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1916-1922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), Atp6p, a kind gift of J. Velours (Bordeaux), were used 1:4,000. Mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against porin were used 1:5000 (Molecular Probes). Isolation of ODC1 as a Multicopy Suppressor of the Null Allele Δfmc1—To get insights on Fmc1p function, we looked for proteins whose overexpression would compensate the loss of Fmc1p. To this aim, the Δfmc1 strain MC6 was transformed with a yeast chromosomal DNA library (see “Materials and Methods”). Transformants were screened for suppression of the growth defect characterizing the Δfmc1 mutant at elevated temperature, 37 °C, on respiratory medium. Among the three different inserts confirmed to be responsible for the rescuing of Δfmc1, the insert of plasmid pLL11 was isolated twice. It proved to contain a Sau3A 2354-bp fragment harboring two open reading frames, YPL135w encoding Isu1p, a protein performing a scaffolding function during assembly of iron-sulfur clusters (23Schilke B. Voisine C. Beinert H. Craig E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10206-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 24Garland S.A. Hoff K. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and YPL134c encoding the main isoform of the oxodicarboxylate carrier Odc1p (14Palmieri L. Agrimi G. Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1916-1922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Subsequent sub-cloning allowed us to confirm that ODC1 (YPL134c) was the sole open reading frame responsible for the compensation of Δfmc1 growth defect. Indeed, pLL14 containing ISU1 (YPL135w) alone was not able to suppress Δfmc1 growth defect (Fig. 1). To the contrary, a multicopy plasmid harboring ODC1 alone (pLL16) was able to restore growth of Δfmc1 on respiratory medium at 37 °C (Fig. 1), to a level that was similar to the one shown by the wild type control (not shown). This compensation was not seen when Δfmc1 was transformed with a centromeric plasmid harboring ODC1 alone (pLL15), indicating that this suppression was dose-dependent (data not shown). As a consequence, to decipher the mechanism of suppression by ODC1, we used the multicopy vector throughout the study. Furthermore, to ease the reading, the Δfmc1 strains transformed with plasmids harboring either FMC1 or ODC1 and the empty vector are referred to as WT, Δfmc1/ODC1 and Δfmc1, respectively. Odc1p Is Overexpressed in the Δfmc1/ODC1 Strain—To make sure that the oxodicarboxylate carrier (Odc1p) was indeed overexpressed in the Δfmc1/ODC1 strain, we performed Western blot analysis on mitochondria purified from each strain grown at 37 °C. As previously shown by Palmieri et al. (14Palmieri L. Agrimi G. Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1916-1922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the polyclonal antibody raised against Odc1p revealed a doublet in which the upper band corresponds to Odc1p as assessed by its absence in the mitochondria purified from the Δodc1 strain (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 clearly shows that whereas a thin band appeared in both WT and Δfmc1 strains, Odc1p expression level was drastically increased in the Δfmc1/ODC1 strain. Indeed, it was at least 10 times higher in mitochondria purified from ODC1-transformed cells than in wild type cells. This confirmed that the suppression observed in the Δfmc1/ODC1 strain was related to Odc1p expression level. The F0F1-ATP Synthase Activity Is Very Low in the Δfmc1/ODC1 Strain—Since the overexpression of Odc1p was able to restore growth at 37 °C on respiratory substrate in the Δfmc1 strain, we investigated whether this was due to the restoration of a functional F0F1-ATP synthase. Mitochondria purified from WT, Δfmc1, and Δfmc1/ODC1 strains grown at 37 °C were assayed for mitochondrial electrical transmembrane potential (ΔΨ) establishment via fluorescence quenching of the dye rhodamine 123. Fig. 3A, left panel, shows that when mitochondria were isolated from wild type cells grown at 37 °C, as expected, ethanol addition induced an important fluorescence quenching due to the establishment of an electrical transmembrane potential. ADP addition induced a decrease of this quenching due to proton reentry through the F0F1-ATP synthase and ΔΨ consumption by the ATP/ADP carrier. The transmembrane potential increased when most of the ADP had been transformed into ATP. As expected, further additions of KCN and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) to these mitochondria led to a collapse of the membrane potential. As previously shown (6Lefebvre-Legendre L. Vaillier J. Benabdelhak H. Velours J. Slonimski P.P. di Rago J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6789-6796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), in the mitochondria isolated from the Δfmc1 strain, even though ethanol was able to establish a small electrical transmembrane potential, ADP failed to induce any decrease in ΔΨ (Fig. 3A, center). Mitochondria isolated from the Δfmc1/ODC1 strain exhibited a behavior comparable to the one observed for the Δfmc1 mitochondria, even though the ΔΨ established by ethanol addition was higher (Fig. 3A, right panel). These experiments indicated that in the Δfmc1/ODC1 strain, the F0F1-ATP synthase had either no or a very low proton-pumping activity. To further investigate the functionality of the F0F1-ATP synthase in the Δfmc1/ODC1 strain, we measured the ability of this enzyme to establish a membrane electrical potential when hydrolyzing ATP (Fig. 3B). Mitochondria were first energized with ethanol. This ΔΨ establishment is required to remove IF1p, the natural inhibitor of the mitochondrial ATPase (25Schouppe C. Vaillier J. Venard R. Rigoulet M. Velours J. Haraux F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). As expected in the wild type strain, KCN addition induced a collapse in the ΔΨ by inhibition of the respiratory chain (Fig. 3B, left). ATP hydrolysis via the F0F1-ATPase induced a ΔΨ establishment, which was fully reversed after oligomycin addition, reflecting the specific F0F1-ATPase activity. Further addition of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone did not have any effect, indicating that the established ΔΨ was F0F1-ATPase-dependent. In the Δfmc1 strain, we previously showed that ATP addition promoted a much decreased ΔΨ establishment almost insensitive to F0F1-ATPase inhibition (6Lefebvre-Legendre L. Vaillier J. Benabdelhak H. Velours J. Slonimski P.P. di Rago J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6789-6796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because Δfmc1/ODC1 and Δfmc1 exhibited a similar profile, Δfmc1/ODC1 alone is represented here. In these strains we observed a very slight oligomycin-sensitive ΔΨ establishment due to ATP hydrolysis, indicating that there probably was a very low proton-pumping activity. These results were further confirmed by assessing the ATPase activity in the three considered strains. Oligomycin-sensitive ATP hydrolysis rates were 264 ± 29 nmol·min–1·mg of protein–1, 8 ± 3 nmol·min–1·mg of protein–1, 27 ± 3 nmol·min–1·mg of protein–1 in WT, Δfmc1, and Δfmc1/ODC1, respectively. This assay revealed in the Δfmc1 and Δfmc1/ODC1 strains the presence of a small amount of functional ATPase, accounting for around 3 and 10% of the total ATPase activity measured in the WT mitochondria. This result further confirmed what was observed in Fig. 3, A and B, which implied that the Δfmc1/ODC1 strain was able to grow on non-fermentable substrate without a significant amount of functional F0F1-ATP synthase. As described in Lefebvre-Legendre et al. (6Lefebvre-Legendre L. Vaillier J. Benabdelhak H. Velours J. Slonimski P.P. di Rago J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6789-6796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), severe perturbations of the F0 domain were seen in the Δfmc1 strain, including the near-to-complete absence of Atp6p. Western blot analysis of mitochondria purified from all three strains revealed that Atp6p accumulation was strongly reduced and hardly detectable in Δfmc1/ODC1 strain as it was in Δfmc1 strain as compared to WT strain (Fig. 3C). Moreover, a Blue Native gel electrophoresis was performed and failed to show a significant band for the mature F0F1-ATP synthase complex in the Δfmc1 and Δfmc1/ODC1 mutants (not shown). This further confirmed that the growth restoration observed in the Δfmc1/ODC1 strain was not due to the restoration of the F0F1-ATP synthase assembly/stability. Respiratory Chain Function and Content Are Partially Restored in the Δfmc1/ODC1 Strain—To characterize oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria isolated from each strain, we investigated both phosphorylating respiratory rate and ATP synthesis rate with ethanol as substrate in the presence of a saturating amount of ADP (Fig. 4A). As previously shown, in the wild type strain both respiratory and ATP synthesis rates were high, and the ratio between them (ATP/O), representing the oxidative phosphorylation yield, was around 1.2 (Ref. 26Rigoulet M. Velours J. Guerin B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar; see Fig. 4A). In the Δfmc1 strain, the phosphorylating respiratory rate is very low, only 12% of the wild type rate, and there was no detectable oligomycin-sensitive ATP synthesis, consistent with previous published results (6Lefebvre-Legendre L. Vaillier J. Benabdelhak H. Velours J. Slonimski P.P. di Rago J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6789-6796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and the above-mentioned results of an absence of functional ATP synthase and a very low content in cytochromes (Fig. 4B). The latter is the sign of a down-regulation of the respiratory complexes expression in dysfunctioning mitochondria, consistent with earlier reports (27Epstein C.B. Waddle J.A. Hale W. Davé V. Thornton J. Macatee T.L. Garner H.R. Butow R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 28Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the Δfmc1/ODC1 strain, the phosphorylating respiratory rate was significantly increased as compared with the Δfmc1 strain, up to 42% of the wild type versus 12% for the Δfmc1. These data are consistent with an increase in the cytochrome content in the mitochondria isolated from this strain (Fig. 4B). The oligomycin-sensitive ATP synthesis rate in Δfmc1/ODC1 represented 20% of the one in the wild type. This was due to a small fraction (10%, see ATPase activities above) of the F0F1-ATP synthase able to properly assemble. Moreover, one might be puzzled by the important increase in cytochrome content in the Δfmc1/ODC1 strain. However, proper assembly of respiratory complexes and ATP synthase complexes requires intramitochondrial ATP (for reviews, see Refs. 29Van Dick L. Langer T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 825-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30Arnold I. Langer T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, and 31Voos W.

https://openalex.org/W2017350971,"N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs), which play a key role in synaptic plasticity, are dynamically regulated by many signaling molecules and scaffolding proteins. Although actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in regulating NMDAR stability in synaptic membrane, the role of microtubules in regulating NMDAR trafficking and function is largely unclear. Here we show that microtubule-depolymerizing agents inhibited NMDA receptor-mediated ionic and synaptic currents in cortical pyramidal neurons. This effect was Ca2+-independent, required GTP, and was more prominent in the presence of high NMDA concentrations. The NR2B subunit-containing NMDA receptor was the primary target of microtubules. The effect of microtubule depolymerizers on NMDAR currents was blocked by cellular knockdown of the kinesin motor protein KIF17, which transports NR2B-containing vesicles along microtubule in neuronal dendrites. Neuromodulators that can stabilize microtubules, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, significantly attenuated the microtubule depolymerizer-induced reduction of NMDAR currents. Moreover, immunocytochemical studies show that microtubule depolymerizers decreased the number of surface NR2B subunits on dendrites, which was prevented by the microtubule stabilizer. Taken together, these results suggest that interfering with microtubule assembly suppresses NMDAR function through a mechanism dependent on kinesin-based dendritic transport of NMDA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2058137515,"We have grown polarized epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney II (MDCK II) cells on filters in the presence of [35S]sulfate, [3H]glucosamine, or [35S]cysteine/[35S]methionine to study proteoglycan (PG) synthesis, sorting, and secretion to the apical and basolateral media. Whereas most of the [35S]sulfate label was recovered in basolateral PGs, the [3H]glucosamine label was predominantly incorporated into the glycosaminoglycan chains of apical PGs, indicating that basolateral PGs are more intensely sulfated than their apical counterparts. Expression of the PG serglycin with a green fluorescent protein tag (SG-GFP) in MDCK II cells produced a protein core secreted 85% apically, which was largely modified by chondroitin sulfate chains. Surprisingly, the 15% of secreted SG-GFP molecules recovered basolaterally were more heavily sulfated and displayed a different sulfation pattern than the apical counterpart. More detailed studies of the differential modification of apically and basolaterally secreted SG-GFP indicate that the protein cores have been designated to apical and basolateral transport platforms before pathway-specific, post-translational modifications have been completed.

Whereas most of the [35S]sulfate label was recovered in basolateral PGs, the [3H]glucosamine label was predominantly incorporated into the glycosaminoglycan chains of apical PGs, indicating that basolateral PGs are more intensely sulfated than their apical counterparts. Expression of the PG serglycin with a green fluorescent protein tag (SG-GFP) in MDCK II cells produced a protein core secreted 85% apically, which was largely modified by chondroitin sulfate chains. Surprisingly, the 15% of secreted SG-GFP molecules recovered basolaterally were more heavily sulfated and displayed a different sulfation pattern than the apical counterpart. More detailed studies of the differential modification of apically and basolaterally secreted SG-GFP indicate that the protein cores have been designated to apical and basolateral transport platforms before pathway-specific, post-translational modifications have been completed. The sorting and transport of newly synthesized proteins to specialized membrane domains in polarized cell types are important requirements for the maintenance of cell-specific architecture.

II cell line is an excellent model system for studies of apical and basolateral sorting of glycoproteins and proteoglycans (PGs). In these cells, apical sorting may be mediated directly or indirectly (1Rodriguez-Boulan E. Gonzalez A.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 193-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the basolateral sorting signals identified to date are localized to the cytoplasmic tails of transmembrane proteins (6Mostov K. Verges M. Altschuler Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), although heparan sulfate (HS) chains also might direct basolateral transport (7Mertens G. Van der Schueren B. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).PGs are proteins that are modified by long, usually unbranched polysaccharides (GAGs) that polymerize in the Golgi apparatus, a process catalyzed by enzymes specific for synthesis of either CS/dermatan sulfate (DS) or heparin/HS chains (5Prydz K. Dalen K.T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 193-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HS chains are polymers of alternating N-acetyl glucosamine and glucuronic acid (GlcNAc-GlcUA) units (8Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahld U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 9Yamada S. Busse M. Ueno M. Kelly O.G. Skarnes W.C. Sugahara K. Kusche-Gullberg M. J. Biol.

Kjellén L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 11Sugahara K. Mikami T. Uyama T. Mizuguchi S. Nomura K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar).Both HS/heparin and CS/DS synthesis start by the sequential addition of four sugars, namely xylose, galactose, galactose, and glucuronic acid, onto a serine next to a glycine in the protein core (Ser-Xyl-Gal-Gal-GlcUA-). This linker tetrasaccharide is coupled by the same enzymes for the two GAG types, whereas the addition of the fifth sugar determines whether a GAG chain becomes HS/heparin or CS/DS (5Prydz K. Dalen K.T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 193-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).What actually determines whether the GAG chain becomes CS/DS or HS is not fully understood. Both the protein core and the linker tetrasaccharide could be of importance. Repeated serine-glycine motifs (Ser-Gly) (12Zhang L. David G. Esko J.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7507-7517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have been shown to promote HS substitution on PG protein cores. Phosphorylation of the linker tetrasaccharide has been observed for both HS and CS chains, whereas sulfation has only been shown for CS chains (15Ueno M. Yamada S. Zako M. Bernfield M. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29134-29140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Both GAG types may be extensively modified by sulfation, HS by deacetylation, and HS and DS by epimerization (8Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahld U.

Biol. 2003; 13: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).Generally, polymerization of CS chains is thought to take place in the TGN, whereas HS synthesis is completed in the cisternae preceding the TGN (16Spiro R.C. Freeze H.H. Sampath D. Garcia J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Sugumaran G. Katsman M. Silbert J.E. J. Biol.

Synthesis and sulfation of the linker tetrasaccharide is an event that occurs naturally before HS and CS polymerization (20Gulberti S. Lattard V. Fondeur M. Jacquinet J.C. Mulliert G. Netter P. Magdalou J. Ouzzine M. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1417-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and, therefore, earlier in the secretory pathway. Linker tetrasaccharide synthesis has been proposed to start at endoplasmic reticulum exit sites or early in the Golgi apparatus and is presumably completed in the cis and/or medial cisternae (5Prydz K. Dalen K.T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 193-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We could show that PGs secreted into the basolateral medium carried GAG chains that were more intensely sulfated and had a different sulfation pattern than their apical counterparts. By following one particular PG, namely serglycin with a green fluorescent protein tag (SG-GFP), we demonstrated the CS linker region and both polymerized HS and CS chains were modified differently on apically and basolaterally secreted SG-GFP, indicating that apical and basolateral routes are segregated early in the Golgi apparatus before the TGN, which has been regarded as the major site of sorting of apical and basolateral components in epithelial MDCK cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Plasmid—cDNA of serglycin was a gift from S. O. Kolset (Department of Nutrition Research, University of Oslo). The Expand long template PCR system (Roche Applied Science) with a 5′-primer (5′-ATCGGAATTCATGATGCAGAAGCTACTCAAA-3′) and a 3′-primer (5′-TTGCAACGTACGATGGATCCTAACATAAAATCCTCTT-3′) was used to amplify and clone by standard molecular biology techniques into EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites in pEGFP-N3 (Clontech), making Ser-Gly-pEGFP.Cell Culture and Transfections—MDCK II cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories, Brisbane, Australia), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and l-glutamine (BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to 50-70% confluency in 100 × 20-mm culture dishes (Sarstedt) and transfected with 4 μg of plasmid (Ser-Gly-pEGFP) and 12 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). After 72 h the cells were passed, and 1 mg/ml G-418 (Duchefa Biochemie, Haarlem, Netherlands) was added for the selection of transfected MDCK II cells (MDCK II#). Resistant colonies were screened by IP with polyclonal anti-GFP (Abcam) and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) before SDS-PAGE. Several colonies were propagated, and one was used for the experiments presented.Metabolic Labeling—MDCK II and MDCK II# (106) were seeded on 4.7-cm2 filters (Costar 3412) and grown for four days before labeling with 0.3 μCi/ml [35S]Cys/[35S]Met (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without Cys and Met (Sigma), 0.3 μCi/ml [35S]SO4 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using RPMI 1640 without sulfate (Invitrogen), or 0.2 μCi/ml [3H]GlcN (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without glucose (Invitrogen) for 22-24 h. Apical (1 ml) and basolateral (2 ml) media were collected, and cell fractions were lysed in 1 ml of IP-lysis solution (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 35 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with protease inhibitor tablets (Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets, Roche Applied Science) added. Macromolecules were visualized by electrophoresis with 4-12 or 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) after Sephadex G-50 fine chromatography (16Spiro R.C. Freeze H.H. Sampath D. Garcia J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Immune Precipitation—After preclearing with 60 μl (50:50 slurry) of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C, IP of apical and basolateral media was carried out with 1 μl/ml anti-GFP at 4 °C overnight before the addition of 60 μl (50:50 slurry) of protein A-Sepharose for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed six times with IP wash solution (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Triton X-100) plus 1% bovine serum albumin and four times without bovine serum albumin. Beads were treated or not treated for GAG degradation with added SDS sample buffer (XT; Bio-Rad) and run on 4-12% XT SDS-polyacrylamide gels with MOPS buffer (Bio-Rad).GAG Degradation Treatments—Samples were divided into three equal volumes, namely control, chondroitinase ABC (cABC) (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) treated for CS degradation at 37 °C overnight, and HNO2 treated for HS degradation (10 min at room temperature) as described (17Sugumaran G. Katsman M. Silbert J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8802-8806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain protein cores with CS tetrasaccharides only, 175 milliunits of chondroitinase AC II Arthro (Seikagaku) were added to each sample together with cABC buffer (pH 6) for 3 h at 37 °C.Gel Filtration Chromatography—GAGs were treated for degradation with cABC or HNO2. Treated and untreated samples were applied to a column (1 cm × 40 cm) of Sepharose Cl-6B (Amersham Biosciences) along with blue dextran and K2CrO4 as internal standards. Elution was performed with 0.15 m NaCl in 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, and 0.1% Triton X-100 at a rate of 6 ml/h. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed for radioactivity in a scintillation counter.Quantification of SG-GFP—Gels were fixed, treated with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), dried, exposed to PhosphorImager screens, scanned (Typhoon 9410 PhosphorImager; Amersham Biosciences), and quantified by ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences) or subjected to autoradiography with Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences).Ion Exchange Chromatography—Radioactively labeled macromolecules from media (purified on Sephadex G-50 fine columns) or precipitated SG-GFP secreted from MDCK II# cells were subjected to DEAE-ion exchange chromatography (Econo system, Bio-Rad). Samples were diluted in 1 ml of buffer A (8 m urea, 0.02 m bis-Tris, and 0.1 M NaCl) and applied to a 3-ml DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences) column. After a 10-ml wash (buffer A), a linear gradient from buffer A to 60% of buffer B (8 m urea, 0.02 m bis-Tris, and 1.15 M NaCl) was applied. Collected fractions (1-ml) and aliquots were counted in a scintillation counter.Extraction of CS Chains from Immune Precipitated SG-GFP and Digestion to Disaccharides—The isolation of GAG chains was performed according to Ledin et al. (21Ledin J. Staatz W. Li J.P. Gotte M. Selleck S. Kjellen L. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42732-42741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). After IP of SG-GFP from both apical and basolateral media, the samples were treated with Pronase (0.8 mg/ml) in 0.5 ml of Pronase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1% Triton X-100) at 55 °C overnight with end-over-end mixing. Subsequently, 0.4 mg of Pronase E from Sigma-Aldrich were added, and the samples were incubated for 3 more hours. After inactivation by boiling and adjustment of the samples to 2 mm MgCl2, 12 milliunits of endonuclease (benzonase) from Sigma-Aldrich were added. The samples were then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and, after heat inactivation of the enzyme, adjusted to a final concentration of 0.1 m NaCl. Subsequently, the samples were centrifuged at 14.000 × g for 10 min. The GAG chains were desalted and purified by ion exchange chromatography on 0.3-ml DEAE-Sephacel columns. The gels were primed by washing with 2 m NH4HCO3 and a loading buffer of pH 8 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The supernatants from the digestions were applied, and the columns were washed successively with a loading buffer of pH 8, a washing buffer of pH 4 (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100), and 0.2 m NH4HCO3. The GAG chains were eluted with 3 × 0.3 ml of 2 m NH4HCO3. The eluates were collected in microcentrifuge tubes and repeatedly freeze dried using the Maxi-Dry Lyo system (Heto) until the pH values of the samples were close to 7.The GAG pools were then digested with 150 milliunits of cABC in a final volume of 50 μl of 40 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8, with 0.01% bovine serum albumin. The CS digestions were allowed to proceed overnight at 37 °C. Each sample was then added to 50 μl of MilliQ water (Waters, Milford, MA) and centrifuged, and the enzyme was heat-inactivated by boiling. After a second centrifugation, the samples were diluted to 250 μl and were ready for analysis by reversed phase, ion pair HPLC.Analysis of CS Disaccharides—Quantitative analysis of GAG chains and their sulfation patterns were performed by reversed phase, ion pair HPLC (5Prydz K. Dalen K.T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 193-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on a Luna 5 μ C18 (2Scheiffele P. Peränen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) reversed phase column (4.6 × 150 mm) from Phenomenex in acetonitrile (8.5%) and tetra-n-butylammonium hydrogen sulfate (1.2 mm; Fluka) by applying a stepwise gradient of 0.2 m NaCl from 1 to 53%. The flow rate was 1.1 ml/min, and the fluorescent labeling reaction was performed by the addition of 2-cyanoacetamide (0.25%; Sigma) in NaOH (0.5%) at a flow rate of 0.35 ml/min. Signals were quantified against known amounts of standard disaccharides analyzed in parallel runs. The ΔCS disaccharide standards were from Sigma and Grampian Enzymes (Orkney, Scotland, UK). The HPLC equipment (pump, autosampler, and fluorescence detector) was purchased from Dionex, including the apparatus for online post-column delivery of solutions (PC10 post-column pneumatic delivery package). The chromatography software used was Chromeleon from Dionex.RESULTSPGs may be labeled in their protein cores by [35S]Cys/[35S]Met, in the backbone of their GAG chains by [3H]GlcN or by [35S]sulfate when GAGs are modified by Golgi sulfotransferases. [35S]Sulfate is the most specific metabolic label for PGs, because it is incorporated into other classes of glycoproteins to a lesser extent than the [3H]GlcN and [35S]amino acid labels. However, regardless of the metabolic label chosen, PGs may be separated from other labeled molecules by ion exchange chromatography because of their high negative charge density.We have previously demonstrated that MDCK cells synthesize several PG species (22Svennevig K. Prydz K. Kolset S.O. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with either HS or CS chains and that endogenous CSPG and hexyl-β-d-thioxyloside-based CS chains are preferentially secreted apically (23Kolset S.O. Vuong T.T. Prydz K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1797-1801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a thorough comparison of the GAG chains on apical and basolateral PGs has not yet been undertaken.We therefore labeled filter-grown MDCK II cells metabolically with each of the three labeling agents before total secreted macromolecules in the apical and basolateral media were isolated by gel filtration (Fig. 1, A-C) and [3H]GlcN and [35S]sulfate-labeled macromolecules were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Sulfated macromolecules were preferentially detected basolaterally in the PG region of the gels also (Fig. 2, upper region, lanes 7 and 10), in accordance with previous investigations.Fig. 2Secreted macromolecules from MDCK II cells. MDCK II cells grown on filters were metabolically labeled with [3H]GlcN (3H-Glcn) and [35S]sulfate (35S-SO42−) for 24 h. Labeled macromolecules from apical (Api) and basolateral (Baso) media were purified on Sephadex G-50 fine columns. HNO2-treated (H) and cABC-treated (C) and untreated controls (Cnt) (one-thirtieth of each sample) were run on 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Macromolecules labeled with [3H]GlcN were, on the other hand, mostly detected apically (Fig. 1A) in the PG region of the SDS-polyacrylamide gels also (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 4). The PG region of the gel split into two bands (Fig. 2, lane 1), where the upper band was sensitive to HNO2 treatment (Fig. 2, lane 2) and the lower band was sensitive to cABC (Fig. 2, lane 3). To investigate further the reason for the discrepancy between the two labeling methods, [3H]GlcN-labeled macromolecules from both media were subjected to DEAE-ion exchange chromatography. The apical medium contained a major PG peak eluting at 0.35-0.40 M NaCl and a minor peak eluting at 0.55-0.6 m NaCl. For the basolateral medium the situation was the opposite, where the peak eluting at the higher salt concentration dominated (Fig. 3). This finding indicates that PGs secreted basolaterally are more charged than PGs secreted apically and may explain some of the differences observed when comparing the incorporation of [35S]sulfate and [3H]GlcN.Fig. 3Secreted negatively charged macromolecules from MDCK II. Purified [3H]GlcN (3H-Glcn)-labeled samples from apical (Api) (A) and basolateral (Baso) (B) media were loaded on DEAE-ion exchange columns. After washing, a linear salt gradient was applied. Radioactivity in collected fractions (1-ml) was measured in a scintillation counter. More negatively charged macromolecules eluted in the later fractions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)These differences could be a result of alternative phenomena. Either one or more PGs that are preferentially secreted at the basolateral membrane are more heavily sulfated than apical PGs, or there are general differences in apical and basolateral sulfation patterns of GAGs. To investigate these questions further we next wanted to study the post-translational modification, sorting, and secretion of a single PG species. We therefore stably expressed serglycin with a C-terminal GFP tag (SG-GFP; Fig. 4A) in MDCK II cells. The MDCK II clone selected for further experiments (MDCK II#) was metabolically labeled with [3H]GlcN before the labeled macromolecules were harvested and subjected to preparative ion exchange chromatography (Fig. 4, B and C) as performed for wild-type cells (Fig. 3). The transfected clone showed a pattern similar to that of the parental cell line, with a peak specific for the basolateral medium eluting in the higher salt region of the chromatogram (Fig. 4C). The indicated peaks (Fig. 4, B and C, peaks 1-4) were subjected to c-ABC and nitrous acid treatment prior to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4D). Peak 1 showed little sensitivity to the treatments and, therefore, contains neither HS nor CS. The peaks labeled 2 in both chromatograms (Fig. 4, B and C) were sensitive to cABC, whereas peaks 3 and 4 could be completely degraded by nitrous acid. This result shows that peak 2 mainly contains CS and that peaks 3 and 4 mainly contain HS.Fig. 4MDCK II cells expressing SG-GFP (MDCK II#). A, the domains of SG-GFP DNA. Amino acids (aa) 1-27 comprise the signal sequence, and amino acid range 94-111 contains eight serine-glycine motifs and one phenylalanine-glycine motif. PCR-amplified serglycin cDNA without a stop codon (amino acids 1-148) was subcloned into the pEGFP expression vector, introducing five extra amino acids (159-163) in front of the GFP. B and C, filter-grown MDCK II# cells were radiolabeled with [3H]GlcN (3H-Glcn). Apical (Api) and basolateral (Baso) media were purified on Sephadex G-50 fine columns and analyzed by DEAE-ion exchange chromatography as described for Fig. 3. D, from each peak marked by an asterisk (*) in panels B and C three fractions were collected and pooled, desalted on Sephadex G-50 fine column, and dried. The samples were solubilized and divided into three aliquots, namely untreated controls (Cnt), HNO2 treated for HS degradation (H), and cABC treated for CS degradation (C), and loaded onto 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next immune precipitated the secreted PG (SG-GFP) from apical and basolateral media. The SG-GFP did not seem to contribute significantly to the CS peak (Fig. 4, B-D, peak 2), because the latter has a higher molecular weight than that of SG-GFP (Figs. 5 and 7). After metabolic labeling with [35S]Cys/[35S]Met, we found 85% of the SG-GFP in the apical medium (Figs. 5A and 6A). Also, [3H]GlcN-labeled SG-GFP was preferentially recovered from the apical medium (67%; Figs. 5B and 6B), whereas after labeling with [35S]sulfate followed by IP most of the label was recovered basolaterally (Figs. 5C and 6C). Our results indicate that basolaterally secreted SG-GFP is significantly more sulfated than SG-GFP secreted into the apical medium (Fig. 6D).Fig. 5Secreted SG-GFP. Filter-grown MDCK II# cells were radiolabeled with [35S]Cys/[35S]Met (35S-Cys/met), [3H]GlcN (3H-Glcn), or [35S]sulfate (35S-SO42−). Media were harvested before IP with an anti-GFP antibody and loaded on to 4-12% XT SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and visualized by phosphorimaging or exposed to film.

After IP of SG-GFP, the samples were divided in three equal parts. One part remained untreated (Cnt), one part was treated with HNO2 for HS degradation (H), and one part was cABC-treated for CS degradation (C).

Digestion with cABC revealed a band the size of the SG-GFP protein core for samples from both media (Fig. 7A, lanes 4 and 7). The hexasaccharides remaining after cABC treatment of [35S]sulfate-labeled SG-GFP were clearly more sulfated (1.9 times) for basolateral samples. Further digestion with chondroitinase AC II Arthro demonstrated that the linker tetrasaccharide was also sulfated as described perviously (24Sugahara K. Masuda M. Harada T. Yamashina I. de Waard P.

Human serglycin has eight potential GAG attachments. Human serglycin has eight potential GAG attachment sites, and serglycin has been shown previously to exist as hybrids between CS and heparin/HS (26Seldin D.C. Austen K.F. Stevens S.L. J. Biol.

HNO2 treatment (which digests HS chains) of [35S]Cys/[35S]Met-labeled samples did not produce any naked protein cores but reduced the label in the PG region of the gels to some extent. After CS or HS depolymerization it therefore seemed that HS chains are only found on SG-GFP CS/HS hybrids where CS chains dominate and that these hybrids coexist with SG-GFP modified exclusively with CS (Fig. 7).To our knowledge, this is the first report of a protein for which a basolateral pool has acquired different post-translational modifications from that secreted apically. This difference could result from a sorting event in the TGN, where more negatively charged GAG chains would have a greater affinity for basolateral transport carriers.

Depletion of zinc from the growth medium of wild type cells results in changes in phospholipid metabolism, including an increase in phosphatidylinositol content (Iwanyshyn, W. M., Han, G.-S., and Carman, G. M. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 21976–21983). We examined the effects of zinc depletion on the regulation of the PIS1-encoded phosphatidylinositol synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of phosphatidylinositol from CDP-diacylglycerol and inositol. Phosphatidylinositol synthase activity increased when zinc was depleted from the growth medium. Analysis of a zrt1Δ zrt2Δ mutant defective in plasma membrane zinc transport indicated that the cytoplasmic levels of zinc were responsible for the regulation of phosphatidylinositol synthase. PIS1 mRNA, its encoded protein Pis1p, and the β-galactosidase activity driven by the PPIS1-lacZ reporter gene were elevated in zinc-depleted cells. This indicated that the increase in phosphatidylinositol synthase activity was the result of a transcriptional mechanism. The zinc-mediated induction of the PPIS1-lacZ reporter gene, Pis1p, and phosphatidylinositol synthase activity was lost in zap1Δ mutant cells. These data indicated that the regulation of PIS1 gene expression by zinc depletion was mediated by the zinc-regulated transcription factor Zap1p. Direct interaction between glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Zap1p687–880 and a putative upstream activating sequence (UAS) zinc-responsive element in the PIS1 promoter was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Mutations in the UAS zinc-responsive element in the PIS1 promoter abolished the GST-Zap1p687–880-DNA interaction in vitro and abolished the zinc-mediated regulation of the PIS1 gene in vivo.

It is a cofactor for hundreds of enzymes (e.g. alcohol dehydrogenase, carbonic anhydrase, proteases, RNA polymerases, superoxide dismutase) (35Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a structural constituent of many proteins (e.g. transcription factors, chaperones, lipid-binding proteins) (36Schwabe J.W. Klug A. Nat.

Despite its essential nature, zinc is toxic to cells when accumulated in excess amounts (35Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol.

Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21976-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In particular, PI synthase activity is elevated in zinc-depleted cells, whereas several enzyme activities (e.g. PS synthase, PS decarboxylase, PE methyltransferase, and phospholipid methyltransferase) in the CDP-diacylglycerol pathway for PC synthesis are reduced in response to zinc depletion (40Iwanyshyn W.M.

The regulation of these activities by zinc availability contributes to alterations in the cellular levels of the major membrane phospholipids PI (elevated) and PE (reduced) (40Iwanyshyn W.M. Han G.S.

For the PS synthase enzyme, the reduction in activity in response to zinc depletion is controlled at the level of transcription through the UASINO element in the CHO1 promoter and by the transcription factors Ino2p, Ino4p, and Opi1p (40Iwanyshyn W.M.

The Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was utilized according to the manufacturer's instructions to generate plasmids pPZM1–pPZM3. These plasmids were derivatives of pMA109 (PPIS1-lacZ) and contained mutations in UASZRE1, UASZRE2 and UASZRE3 of the PIS1 promoter. Plasmids pPZM1 (mutagenic primers 5′-TTTTTCTTCCTTTTCCCTAACAATTCCAATTGCTTCTCTTCTCTTCTCCTT-3′ and 5′-AAGGAGAAGAGAAGAGAAGCAATTGGAATTGTTAGGGAAAAGGAAGAAAAA-3′), pPZM2 (mutagenic primers 5′-TTTTAGCCATGGACACTTCTCAATTCCAATTTGTTGATGTCCATGGCTAAAA-3′ and 5′-TCAATGGCAGTTTTATCAACCAATTGGAATTGGAATTGAGAAGTGTCCATGGCTAAAA-3′), and pPZM3 (mutagenic primers 5′-ATATAAGTAAAACATAAAAACAATTCCAATTGGTATGGTTTATTTG CCGTC-3′ and 5′-GACGGCAAATAAACCATACCAATTGGAATTGTTTTTATGTTTTACTTATAT-3′) were constructed by amplification of plasmid pMA109 by PCR. Plasmid pMA109 was eliminated from the mutant plasmid reactions by digestion with DpnI. The mutant plasmids were amplified in E. coli, and the purified plasmids were sequenced to confirm the mutations in the PIS1 promoter.RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cells (46Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar, 47Herrick D. Parker R. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell.

Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993Google Scholar), and then transferred to Zeta Probe membranes by vacuum blotting. The PIS1 and CMD1 probes were labeled with [α-32P]dTTP using the NEBlot random primer labeling kit, and unincorporated nucleotides were removed using ProbeQuant G-50 columns. Prehybridization, hybridization with the probes, and washes to remove nonspecific binding were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Images of the radiolabeled mRNAs were acquired by phosphorimaging analysis.Anti-PI Synthase Antibodies and Immunoblotting—The peptide sequence AALILADNDAKNANE (residues 201–215 at the C-terminal end of the deduced amino acid sequence of PIS1) was synthesized and used to raise antibodies in New Zealand White rabbits by standard procedures at Bio-Synthesis, Inc. The IgG fraction was isolated from the antiserum using protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (49Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE (50Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) using 10% slab gels and the transfer of proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (51Haid A. Suissa M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) were performed as described previously. The membrane was probed with 12.5 μg/ml purified anti-PI synthase IgG fraction. Mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1,000. Goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugates were used as secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:5,000. The PI synthase protein (Pis1p) was detected using the enhanced chemifluorescence Western blotting detection kit, and the signals were acquired by FluorImaging. The relative density of the signal was analyzed using ImageQuant software. Immunoblot signals were in the linear range of detectability.Preparation of Cell Extracts and Protein Determination—Cell extracts were prepared as described previously (52Klig L.S. Homann M.J. Carman G.M. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in 50 mm Tris-maleate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin. Cells were disrupted by homogenization with chilled glass beads (0.5-mm diameter) using a Biospec Products Mini-Bead-Beater-8. Samples were homogenized for 10 1-min bursts followed by a 2-min cooling between bursts at 4 °C. The cell extract (supernatant) was obtained by centrifugation of the homogenate at 1,500 × g for 10 min. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (53Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard.Enzyme Assays—All assays were conducted in triplicate at 30 °C in a total volume of 0.1 ml. PI synthase activity was measured by following the incorporation of [2-3H]inositol (10,000 cpm/nmol) into PI as described previously (54Carman G.M. Fischl A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm inositol, 0.2 mm CDP-diacylglycerol, 2.4 mm Triton X-100, and enzyme protein. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by following the formation of o-nitrophenyl from o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 410 nm (55Craven G.R. Steers Jr., E. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2468-2477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 3 mm o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and enzyme protein. All assays were linear with time and protein concentration. The average standard deviation of all assays was ± 5%. A unit of PI synthase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 nmol of product/min, whereas a unit of β-galactosidase activity was defined in μmol/min. Specific activity was defined as units/mg of protein.Expression and Purification of GST-Zap1p687–880 from E. coli—The GST-Zap1p687–880 fusion protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS bearing plasmid pGEX-687. A 500-ml culture was grown to A600 ∼ 0.8 at 28 °C, and the expression of GST-Zap1p687–880 was induced for 1 h with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The culture was harvested, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.3). Cells were disrupted with a French press at 20,000 pounds/square inch, and unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cell lysate) was mixed for 1 h with 1 ml of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose with gentle shaking. The glutathione-Sepharose resin was then packed in a 10-ml Poly-Prep disposable column and was washed with 25 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Proteins bound to the column were eluted (0.5-ml fractions) with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the 48-kDa GST-Zap1p687–880 fusion protein was purified to ∼90% of homogeneity. The"

Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of p27Kip1 is an important mechanism for activation of Cyclin E-Cdk2 and facilitates G1/S transition. Ubiquitination of p27 is primarily catalyzed by a multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase, SCFSkp2, and requires an adapter protein Cks1. In addition, phosphorylation of p27 at Thr187 by Cyclin E and Cdk2 is also essential for triggering substrate ubiquitination. Here we investigate the molecular mechanism of p27 ubiquitination. We show that Cyclin E-Cdk2 is essential for targeting the p27 substrate to SCFSkp2. Direct physical contact between Cyclin E but not Cdk2 and p27 is required for p27 recruitment to SCFSkp2. In a search for positively charged amino acid residues that may be involved in recognition of the Thr187 phosphate group, we found that Arg306 of Skp2 is required for association and ubiquitination of phosphorylated p27 but dispensable for ubiquitination of unphosphorylated p21. Thus, our data unravel the molecular organization of the ubiquitination complex that catalyzes p27 ubiquitination and provide unique insights into the specificity of substrate recognition by SCFSkp2. p27Kip1 is an essential cell cycle inhibitor of Cyclin-dependent kinases.

Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 plays essential roles in controlling cell proliferation (1Toyoshima H. Hunter T.

In growth-arrested cells, p27 accumulates and inhibits the activity of Cyclin E-Cdk2 and Cyclin A-Cdk2 resulting in halting cell cycle progression. In proliferating cells, p27 is degraded during the G0/G1 and G1/S transitions and thus releases inhibition of the Cdk2 kinase to drive cell cycle progression. The tight control of p27 degradation is abrogated in human cancer cells. Excessive proteolysis of p27 is a hallmark of many types of aggressive tumor cells (5Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M.

Physiol. 2000; 183: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Proteolysis of p27 occurs mainly through the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation pathway (7Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar, 8Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of p27 is carried out by a multienzyme complex consisting of ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin ligase; LRR, leucine-rich repeats; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin. ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3). The E3 often controls the specificity and timing of substrate ubiquitination (9Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat.

Cell. 2001; 7: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitination of p27 during the G1/S transition is mediated by a multisubunit E3 enzyme complex, SCFSkp2 (9Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar, 10Sutterluty H. Chatelain E. Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Senften M. Muller U. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). SCF is a RING-finger type E3 enzyme with four subunits including invariable components Rbx1, Cul-1, Skp1, and a variable F-box-containing substrate acceptor protein (13Kipreos E.T. Pagano M. Genome Biol. 2000; 1 (Reviews 3002)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Winston J.T. Koepp D.M. Zhu C. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr.

Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 236-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Whereas Rbx1 contains a RING H2 domain that provides a docking site for conjugating enzymes (E2), Cul-1 is the scaffold protein that bridges Rbx1 and Skp1 (16Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). The latter recognizes the F-box motif existing in many F-box proteins. The F-box proteins typically contain a variety of protein-protein interaction domains that are involved in recruitment of various substrates for ubiquitination (15Patton E.E. Willems A.R. Tyers M. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 236-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Skp2 is the F-box protein that is responsible for p27 recognition (9Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar, 10Sutterluty H. Chatelain E. Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Senften M. Muller U. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). There are 10 leucine-rich repeats (LRR) in Skp2 forming a “sickle” shaped structure when crystallized (17Schulman B.A. Carrano A.C. Jeffrey P.D. Bowen Z. Kinnucan E.R. Finnin M.S. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Pagano M. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 18Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M.

It has been assumed that these LRRs bind p27 and facilitate its ubiquitination. Ubiquitination of p27 requires its phosphorylation at Thr187 by Cyclin E-Cdk2 or Cyclin A-Cdk2 (19Montagnoli A. Fiore F. Eytan E. Carrano A.C. Draetta G.F. Hershko A. Pagano M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 20Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation makes p27 competent to be a substrate for SCFSkp2. The exact role of phosphorylation is still not very clear but existing evidence suggests that acquisition of the phosphate group may increase binding of the substrate to the F-box protein, thus serving as a degradation signal (22Seeliger M.A. Breward S.E. Friedler A. Schon O. Itzhaki L.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 718-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, ubiquitination of p21 by SCFSkp2 can be phosphorylation-independent (23Bornstein G. Bloom J. Sitry-Shevah D. Nakayama K. Pagano M. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25752-25757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Therefore, substrate phosphorylation is not absolutely required for all SCFSkp2 targets. In addition to the requirement of substrate phosphorylation, ubiquitination of p27 also requires the presence of Cks1 and Cyclin E-Cdk2 (9Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar, 10Sutterluty H. Chatelain E. Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Senften M. Muller U. Krek W. Nat.

Mendenhall M.D. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2034-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Three independent binding sites exist in Cks1 to mediate its interaction with Cdk2, Skp2, and anion groups (26Sitry D. Seeliger M.A. Ko T.K. Ganoth D. Breward S.E. Itzhaki L.S. Pagano M. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42233-42240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Two models have been proposed for the role of Cks1 in p27 ubiquitination. The allosteric model suggests that Cks1 binds Skp2, causes a conformational change in Skp2, and allows phosphorylated p27 to dock onto Skp2 (12Spruck C. Strohmaier H. Watson M. Smith A.P. Ryan A. Krek T.W. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 27Xu K. Belunis C. Chu W. Weber D. Podlaski F. Huang K.S. Reed S.I. Vassilev L.T. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The adapter model favors the idea that Cks1 binds the Cyclin E-Cdk2-p27 complex and brings the substrate in proximity of Skp2 (11Ganoth D. Bornstein G. Ko T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M. Hershko A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 26Sitry D. Seeliger M.A. Ko T.K. Ganoth D. Breward S.E. Itzhaki L.S. Pagano M. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42233-42240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The anion binding site of Cks1 may recognize the phosphate group at Thr187 of p27 (22Seeliger M.A. Breward S.E. Friedler A. Schon O. Itzhaki L.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 718-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Sitry D. Seeliger M.A. Ko T.K. Ganoth D. Breward S.E. Itzhaki L.S. Pagano M. Hershko A. J. Biol.

These two models present contrasting views of p27 substrate recruitment to SCFSkp2 and lie at the heart of the question regarding how E3 enzymes recruit substrates in general. In this report, we first set out to determine the role of Cyclin E-Cdk2 in p27 ubiquitination. We showed that Cyclin E-Cdk2 is absolutely required for ubiquitination of p27. Phosphorylated p27 cannot be ubiquitinated without direct physical contact with Cyclin E. The physical contact between p27 and Cdk2 is dispensable for p27 ubiquitination. In addition, we have identified a positively charged amino acid residue on the surface of the LRR in Skp2 that is required for ubiquitination of phosphorylated p27 but dispensable for ubiquitination of unphosphorylated p21. Our data suggest that p27 recruitment to SCFSkp2 is through the Cyclin E-Cdk2 complex via the adapter protein Cks1. The phosphate group at Thr187 is probably recognized directly by Skp2 to allow the substrate to adopt a conformation competent for ubiquitination. Expression Vectors and Recombinant Proteins—Mouse p27 and human p21 were subcloned into pCS2. pEXL-Skp2 was previously described (24Wang W. Ungermannova D. Chen L. Liu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32390-32396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Skp2 R306A/K307A, R306A, K307A, and R319A/R320A point mutations as well as p27-Cyclin E-Cdk2 contact mutants, p27T187A and p27 T187D, were generated by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Strategene). These constructs were used as templates for in vitro translations using the TnT kit from Promega. Human Cks1, purchased from ATCC, was cloned into pGEX4T-1 and purified as a GST-tagged protein as described previously (24Wang W. Ungermannova D. Chen L. Liu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32390-32396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recombinant E1 was produced in insect cells or purchased from BostonBiochem. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing GST-Skp1, HA-CUL1, Rbx, GST-Cyclin E, and Cdk2 were gifts of Dr. Wade Harper (Harvard Medical School), and catalytically inactive Cdk2m was a gift of Dr. David Morgan (University of California, San Francisco). To construct the SCF complex with mutant Skp2, wild type and mutant Skp2 were subcloned into pFAST-BacHTb (Invitrogen) and transformed into DH10Bac. Genomic DNA for each construct derived from DH10Bac cells that had undergone successful recombination was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and subsequently transfected into Sf9 cells using Cellfectin (Invitrogen). All baculoviruses were amplified in Sf9 cells, and the different SCFSkp2 (Skp2 mutants) protein complexes and Cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes were generated by co-infection of Hi5 cells (Invitrogen) with the appropriate baculoviruses. GST affinity chromatography was used to purify the recombinant protein complexes (GE Healthcare). His6-CDC34 (Ub-E2) was expressed in bacteria and purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). To produce recombinant p27, the coding region of p27 was cloned into the pGEX4T-1 vector using the SalI and NotI sites, transformed into BL21 cells (Novagene), and purified as a GST fusion protein. Native and untagged p27 were obtained by cleaving the purified protein with recombinant thrombin (Sigma). Purification of Phosphorylated p27—Untagged p27 obtained by cleaving the GST-tagged p27 purified from Escherichia coli was incubated with GST-Cyclin E-Cdk2 purified from insect cells at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. p27 free from the kinase complex was isolated as described previously (28Skowyra D. Craig K.L. Tyers M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). In Vitro Binding Assays—Protein binding assays were performed using [35S]Met-labeled proteins (Promega) as described previously (24Wang W. Ungermannova D. Chen L. Liu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32390-32396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of radioactively labeled proteins were incubated with 3 μg of GST-tagged protein in NETN buffer. The binding reactions were then coupled to 20 μl of glutathione beads. Beads were washed 3 times with NETN buffer. The bound proteins were boiled with SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE before phosphorimaging analysis. To examine the interactions between [35S]Skp2 or [35S]Skp2-R306A and p27, two synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminal region of human p27 were purchased from Sigma: NAGSVEQTPKKPGLLRRRQT (unphosphorylated p27 peptide) and NAGSVEQ(pT)PKKPGLLRRRQT (p27 phosphopeptide), which was generated by attaching a phosphate group to the Thr residue at position 8 (equivalent to human p27 Thr187, which is normally phosphorylated by Cyclin E-Cdk2). The peptides were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B as recommended by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare). In vitro binding reactions were performed in the presence or absence of the recombinant Cks1 as described (26Sitry D. Seeliger M.A. Ko T.K. Ganoth D. Breward S.E. Itzhaki L.S. Pagano M. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42233-42240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). ImageQuant 5.2 was utilized to quantify the protein-protein interactions. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation Assays—Samples from the purified SCF complexes were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. The expression levels of Skp2 and HA-Cul-1 were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Skp2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-HA (Covance) antibodies. Equal amounts of the wild type and mutant SCF complexes were incubated with 5 μlof in vitro translated Cks1 labeled with [35S]Met for 30 min at 4 °C. 2 μl of anti-HA antibody was added to each sample and incubated for 1 h. 20 μl of Protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz) were subsequently added to each sample and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein complexes on the beads were collected by brief centrifugation and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. In Vitro p27 and p21 Ubiquitination Assays—Wild type p27 or p27C-, p27K-, or p27CK- were labeled with [35S]methionine using a TnT lysate system and phosphorylated by incubation with 100 ng of GST-Cyclin E-Cdk2 in a 20× energy regeneration system (10 mm ATP, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgOAc, 300 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The ubiquitin ligation was performed in a 25-μl reaction containing pre-phosphorylated p27, 250 ng of E1, 1 μg of CDC34, 5 μg of SCFSkp2 complex, or 7 μl of in vitro translated non-radioactively labeled Skp2 and Skp2 mutants, 0.1 μg of Cks1, 15 μg of methylated ubiquitin (Calbiochem), 1 μm ubiquitin aldehyde (BostonBiochem), 0.2 mm MG 132 (Calbiochem), and 2.5 μl of a 20× energy regeneration system. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h, terminated by adding 2× SDS loading buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorimaging was used to analyze the results. Ubiquitination of p21 was performed in the same manner as p27 ubiquitination, except in vitro translated p21 was not preincubated with Cyclin E-Cdk2 and a 20× energy regeneration system. In Vitro Kinase Assay—A 10-μl reaction system was used to phosphorylate recombinant p27. The mixture contained 1 μm Cyclin E-Cdk2, 2 μm p27, 100 μm unlabeled ATP, 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Heat treatment was applied to kinase reactions for 20 min using the indicated temperatures. Where necessary, the protein aggregates that resulted from the heat treatment were removed by centrifugation. Samples were quenched by addition of SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Phosphorimaging (GE healthcare). Roles of Cyclin E-Cdk2 in p27 Ubiquitination—Previous studies indicate that phosphorylation of p27 by Cyclin E-Cdk2 is pivotal for p27 ubiquitination (19Montagnoli A. Fiore F. Eytan E. Carrano A.C. Draetta G.F. Hershko A. Pagano M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 20Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5334-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 21Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). In addition, a trimeric complex containing Cyclin E-Cdk2 or Cyclin A-Cdk2 and p27 are also required (19Montagnoli A. Fiore F. Eytan E. Carrano A.C. Draetta G.F. Hershko A. Pagano M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Because p27 forms a stable complex with Cyclin E-Cdk2, it is still not clear whether ubiquitination of phosphorylated p27 can occur in the absence of the Cyclin E-Cdk2 complex after p27 is phosphorylated. Previous studies indicated that p27 is heat stable (29Polyak K. Kato J.Y. Solomon M.J. Sherr C.J. Massague J. Roberts J.M. Koff A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar). Heat-treated p27 (100 °C 3 min) retains its ability to bind Cyclin E-Cdk2 and inhibit the kinase activity (29Polyak K. Kato J.Y. Solomon M.J. Sherr C.J. Massague J. Roberts J.M. Koff A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar). Our experimental strategy was to produce p27 phosphorylated at Thr187 and subsequently remove Cyclin E-Cdk2 by heat treatment. In this way, we could separate the phosphorylation function of Cyclin E-Cdk2 from the adapter function in p27 ubiquitation. As shown in Fig. 1, we carried out an in vitro kinase assay in which we used [32P]ATP to phosphorylate bacterially purified p27. 30 °C is a standard temperature we use to perform kinase reactions. To assess stability of phosphorylated p27, we first carried out the kinase assay at the standard temperature followed by heat treatment that varied from 30 to 100 °C. Each reaction was treated at the given temperature for 20 min, and insoluble materials were separated by centrifugation following heat treatment. Phosphorylated p27 remains soluble in the range of temperatures indicated (Fig. 1A). Next we determined the temperature at which Cyclin E-Cdk2 activity and stability can be destroyed. Using the same temperature range to heat treat the recombinant Cyclin E-Cdk2 complex and subsequently adding it to the in vitro kinase reaction, we found that the Cyclin E-Cdk2 complex denatures and loses its ability to phosphorylate p27 once the temperature was raised above 50 °C (Fig. 1B). Thus, we can remove Cyclin E-Cdk2 from phosphorylated p27 after the phosphorylation reaction by incubating the reaction mixture at 75 °C. This treatment will yield phosphorylated p27 without native Cyclin E-Cdk2. Whereas p27 ubiquitination occurs efficiently in a mixture containing Cyclin E-Cdk2, Cks1 and SCFSkp2 (Fig. 1C, lane 2), no ubiquitin was found to be transferred to p27 if the p27 phosphorylation reaction mixture was treated at 75 °C for 20 min (Fig. 1C, lane 4). Conjugation of ubiquitin was rescued when we added the recombinant Cyclin E-Cdk2 back to the heat-treated reaction mixture, suggesting that the presence of active Cyclin E-Cdk2 complex restored the defects (Fig. 1C, lane 5). If the Cyclin E-Cdk2 complex is also required to present phosphorylated p27 substrate, we would expect that kinase defective Cyclin E-Cdk2 would also be able to restore the ubiquitination of phosphorylated p27. This is indeed the case as adding catalytically inactive Cyclin E-Cdk2 to the heat-treated phosphorylation reaction restored the p27 ubiquitination (Fig. 1C, lane 7), whereas incubating Cyclin E-Cdk2m with p27 alone did not result in p27 ubiquitination. Therefore, these data suggest Thr187-phosphorylated p27 cannot be ubiquitinated by the SCFSkp2 complex without the presence of Cyclin E-Cdk2. Because the enzymatic activity of Cyclin E-Cdk2 is not required to promote the ubiquitination of Thr187-phosphorylated p27, Cyclin E-Cdk2 must be involved in presenting the substrate to the SCFSkp2 complex. Finally, ubiquitination of p27 is phosphorylation-dependent as the p27 T187A mutant failed to undergo ubiquitination (Fig. 1C, lane 9). However, when Thr187 was changed to Asp, which could partially mimic the phosphorylation, ubiquitination occurred in the absence of phosphorylation but still depended on the presence of Cyclin E-Cdk2 (Fig. 1C, lane 11). Heat treatment is considered to be a harsh procedure and may cause a structural change in Thr187-phosphorylated p27, even though heat-treated p27 retains a majority of its biological activity in vitro (29Polyak K. Kato J.Y. Solomon M.J. Sherr C.J. Massague J. Roberts J.M. Koff A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar). To definitively assess the role of Cyclin E-Cdk2 in p27 ubiquitination, we sought to prepare Thr187-phosphorylated p27 under native conditions. Untagged purified recombinant p27 from E. coli was phosphorylated by GST-Cyclin E-Cdk2. 32P-Labeled p27 free from the kinase complex was prepared as described previously (28Skowyra D. Craig K.L. Tyers M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). A ubiquitination reaction with this labeled substrate was performed in the presence or absence of Cyclin E-Cdk2 or catalytically inactive Cyclin E-Cdk2m. As shown in Fig. 1D, 32P-labeled p27 is unable to undergo ubiquitination without either Cyclin E-Cdk2 complex (Fig. 1D, lane 2). Upon addition of either complex, ubiquitination of p27 was restored. The different ubiquitination patterns observed in Fig. 1, C versus D, are likely because of the relative amount of methylated ubiquitin in the system. The substrate p27 used in Fig. 1D is purified from E. coli, whereas 35S-labeled p27 in Fig. 1C was prepared from rabbit reticulocyte lysate that is known to contain fair amounts of endogenous ubiquitin. The same amount of methylated ubiquitin was included in both reactions to suppress polyubiquitination. In the pure reconstituted system in Fig. 1D, a higher methylated ubiquitin/ubiquitin ratio suppresses polyubiquitination more effectively resulting in predominantly monoubiquitinated p27. To determine whether Cyclin E, Cdk2, and p27 function as a trimeric complex to interact with SCFSkp2, we attempted to reconstitute the p27 ubiquitination reaction in vitro with purified Cyclin E or Cdk2 alone. Phosphorylation of p27 was accomplished by incubation with the Cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase, which was subsequently removed by heat treatment. Ubiquitination of phosphorylated p27 in the presence E1, E2, and E3 (SCFSkp2) was performed by adding either the catalytically inactive Cyclin E-Cdk2m complex or purified Cyclin E alone or catalytically inactive kinase Cdk2m alone. As shown in Fig. 1E, whereas the catalytically inactive Cyclin E-Cdk2m complex promotes p27 ubiquitination, neither Cyclin E alone nor Cdk2m alone are sufficient to reconstitute ubiquitination of phosphorylated p27. Therefore, the SCFSkp2 complex likely recognizes a trimeric complex consisting of p27-Cyclin E-Cdk2. The Cyclin E-Cdk2 complex has a dual function in p27 ubiquitination: substrate phosphorylation and substrate presentation. Requirement of Cyclin E but Not Cdk2 Contact for p27 Ubiquitination in Vitro—The crystal structure of p27 complexed with Cyclin A-Cdk2 revealed that p27 has dual contact with Cdk2 and Cyclin A (30Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Patten A.K. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated previously that the FNF motif in Cdk2 and the RXL motif in Cyclin E are required for interaction between p27, Cdk2, and Cyclin E, respectively (20Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5334-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). We next sought to understand the role of specific interactions between p27 and Cyclin E-Cdk2 in p27 ubiquitination in vitro. Targeted residues that interact with Cyclin E-Cdk2 are conserved among all cyclin kinase inhibitors, including p27, p21, and p57 (20Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5334-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 30Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Patten A.K. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). When p27 lost a contact with Cdk2 or Cyclin E or both, in each case, the function of p27 as an inhibitor of Cdk2 was abolished (20Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5334-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that p27 mutants deficient in their binding to Cyclin E or Cyclin E-Cdk2 remained stable in Rat1 cells, compared with rapid degradation of p27 that was devoid of the Cdk2 contact (20Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5334-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Whether impairment of p27 contacts with Cdk2 or Cyclin E affects p27 ubiquitination by SCFSkp2 in vitro has not been systematically explored. We generated point mutants of p27 by replacing Arg30 and Arg32 with alanines to prevent binding to Cyclin E (p27C-), Phe62 and Phe64 with alanines to eliminate Cdk2 contact (p27K-), as well as a double mutant to disable the interaction with both the Cdk2 and Cyclin E subunits. First, we analyzed whether the mutants we constructed indeed affect association between p27 and the Cyclin E-Cdk2 complex. A binding assay was performed by incubating Cyclin E-GST-Cdk2 purified from insect cells with in vitro translated 35S-labeled p27 variants. As predicted, we observed the strongest association between Cyclin E-Cdk2 with the wild type p27 (Fig. 2A, lane 2). p27K- and p27C- showed decreased binding to Cyclin E-Cdk2 (lanes 4 and 6), whereas p27CK- was incapable of forming the ternary complex (lane 8). The consequence of mutations on p27 ubiquitination was tested in the reconstituted in vitro ubiquitination assay (24Wang W. Ungermannova D. Chen L. Liu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32390-32396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In vitro translated p27 proteins were added to the reaction containing Cyclin E-Cdk2 along with the energy regeneration system. The ubiquitin ligation was a"

This stimulatory effect is thought to involve a mechanism similar to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which activates all known inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels. However, the effect of LC-CoA on other Kir channels has not been well characterized. In this study, we show that in contrast to their stimulatory effect on KATP channels, LC-CoA (e.g. oleoyl-CoA) potently and reversibly inhibits all other Kir channels tested (Kir1.1, Kir2.1, Kir3.4, Kir7.1). We also demonstrate that the inhibitory potency of the LC-CoA increases with the chain length of the fatty acid chain, while both its activatory and inhibitory effects critically depend on the presence of the 3′-ribose phosphate on the CoA group. Biochemical studies also demonstrate that PIP2 and LC-CoA bind with similar affinity to the C-terminal domains of Kir2.1 and Kir6.2 and that PIP2 binding can be competitively antagonized by LC-CoA, suggesting that the mechanism of LC-CoA inhibition involves displacement of PIP2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in contrast to its stimulatory effect on KATP channels, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate has an inhibitory effect on Kir1.1 and Kir2.1. These results demonstrate a bi-directional modulation of Kir channel activity by LC-CoA and phosphoinositides and suggest that changes in fatty acid metabolism (e.g. LC-CoA production) could have profound and widespread effects on cellular electrical activity."

Recently we showed that the purified YefM antitoxin is a natively unfolded protein, as we previously reported for the Phd antitoxin in the P1 phage Doc-Phd toxin-antitoxin system. Here we report the purification and structural properties of the YoeB toxin and present physical evidence for the existence of a tight YoeB·YefM polypeptide complex in solution. YoeB and YefM proteins co-eluted as single peaks in sequential Ni-affinity FPLC and Q-Sepharose ion-exchange chromatography implying the formation of a YoeB·YefM complex. The unstable antitoxin was removed from the mixture by natural proteolysis, and the residual YoeB protein was purified using ion exchange chromatography. Fluorescence anisotropy studies of the purified YoeB and YefM proteins showed a 2:1 stoichiometry of the complex, providing direct evidence for a physical complex between the proteins. Near- and far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy of the purified toxin revealed that, similar to the Doc toxin, YoeB is a well-folded protein. Thermal denaturation experiments confirmed the conformational stability of the YoeB toxin, which underwent reversible thermal unfolding at temperatures up to 56 °C.

Glaser G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 43-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 2Gerdes K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 561-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 3Hayes F. Science. 2003; 301: 1496-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The toxin, typically a protein that can inhibit important cellular functions like translation or replication, is inactive when combined with the antitoxin. When carried on plasmids, TA systems constitute a maintenance mechanism or “plasmid addiction” system ensuring a remarkably stable vertical plasmid inheritance to bacterial daughter cells upon division. Such an efficient inheritance pattern is achieved through toxin-mediated post-segregation killing (PSK) of bacteria that accidentally lose the plasmid (“cured” cells) after the segregation event (1Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 43-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The PSK mechanism is based on the differential physiological stability of the protein components; namely, a stable toxin with a long half-life and an unstable antitoxin with a short half-life. Consequently, as neither de novo toxin or antitoxin expression occurs in cured cells, rapid proteolytic degradation of the antitoxin enables the retained stable toxin to execute its lethal function. The cellular targets of most plasmid-borne toxins are unknown. Cellular targets have been described in the TA systems of the ccd of plasmid F, parDE of RK2 plasmid and kis-kid/pemI-pemK of plasmid R1/R100 (4Bernard P. Couturier M. J. Mol.

Maguin E. Jafri S. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 414-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Despite their low sequence homology, the Phd and YefM proteins show comparable thermodynamic and structural properties. As both proteins appear to be predominantly unfolded under physiologically relevant conditions (12Cherny I. Gazit E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8252-8261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 30Gazit E. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2652-2657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), they can be considered members of a growing class of natively unfolded proteins (31Uversky V.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Natively unfolded proteins, which thermodynamically favor the unfolded state over the folded one, have been identified in various systems and have different physiological roles. Natively unfolded proteins are implicated in several diseases linked to protein misfolding (32Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). Although various natively unfolded proteins share comparable amino acid compositions and similar biophysical characteristics (31Uversky V.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 33Dunker K.A. Brown C.J. Lawson J.D. Iakoucheva L.M. Obradović Z.

Proteins. 2003; 53: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the actual physiological relevance of the unfolded state is not fully understood. The Phd-YefM protein family represents a case in which the natively unfolded state is physiologically relevant. The Phd antitoxin has a low intrinsic thermal stability (Tm ∼25 °C), expressed in the predominant random coil conformation found at physiological temperatures (30Gazit E. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2652-2657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As the Phd antitoxin is recognized and degraded by the ClpXP quality control machinery of the bacterial cell (35Lehnherr H. Yarmolinsky M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3274-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), the antitoxin is identified as a damaged protein. Accordingly, the unfolded state subjects the protein to constant degradation, thus ensuring the short half-life that is critical for physiological activity. The YefM protein exhibits even higher structural instability, with the random coil conformation predominating even at 4 °C (12Cherny I. Gazit E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8252-8261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Structural and thermodynamic studies have shown that other antitoxins are partially unstructured at physiologic temperatures as well. The CcdA antitoxin, for example, has a flexible and relatively unstructured region in its C-terminal portion (36Van Melderen L. Thi M.H. Lecchi P. Gottesman S. Couturier M. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27730-27738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The investigators suggested that under physiological conditions, CcdA can adopt a partially unfolded conformation (37Dao-Thi M.H. Messens J. Wyns L. Backmann J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1373-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the preferred substrate for the activity of the Lon protease, which is involved in the selective recognition and proteolytic removal of damaged proteins and protein turnover. The ParD antitoxin, encoded by the parDE operon of plasmid RK2, comprises a well structured N-terminal domain and a very flexible C-terminal domain (38Oberer M. Zangger K. Prytulla S. Keller W. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the MazE-MazF TA complex (39Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and the MazE antitoxin, stabilized with a specific camel antibody fragment (40Loris R. Marianovsky I.

Chem. 2003; 278: 28252-28257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), clearly showed the presence of a large unstructured C-terminal region in MazE. The absence of an ordered structure for the C-terminal region in the MazE can be explained by the crystal structure of the complex; the C-terminal domain of MazE achieves stability by wrapping itself around the MazF dimer, creating an extended polypeptide loop. Recently, the crystal structure of the archaeal TA RelB-RelE complex was determined (41Takagi H. Kakuta Y. Okada T. Yao M. Tanaka I. Kimura M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). According to the results of that study, the aRelB antitoxin lacks a clear hydrophobic core and, similar to MazE, wraps around the aRelE toxin to acquire stability. According to one hypothesis, the low physiological stability and low structural or thermodynamic stability of antitoxins are related because of the increased susceptibility of antitoxins to proteolysis (42Gazit E. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16813-16818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Despite the rapidly increasing number of identified TA systems and the accumulating number of solved crystal structures of TA systems (39Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Burley S.K. Mol.

Comparative studies in the phd-doc and ccd TA systems (30Gazit E. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2652-2657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 42Gazit E.

Additional comparative data can be indirectly obtained by examining the solved crystal structures of TA complexes, albeit performed in non-physiological conditions. Both the MazE-MazF (39Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and aRelB-aRelE (41Takagi H. Kakuta Y. Okada T. Yao M. Tanaka I. Kimura M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) complexes display a well ordered overall structure of the toxin in contrast to the significantly less ordered structure of the antitoxin, strongly suggesting that this structure occurs in vivo as well. An exceptional case is the ϵζ TA system of plasmid pSM19035 (45Meinhart A. Alonso J.C. Sträter N. Saenger W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1661-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 46Camacho A.G. Misselwitz R. Behlke J. Ayora S. Welfle K. Meinhart A. Lara B. Seanger W. Welfle H. Alonso J.C. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1701-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Unlike other systems studied, the thermodynamic stability of the ζ toxin is significantly lower than that of the ϵ antitoxin. Yet, the observation that the ϵ antitoxin maintains a short half-life compared with the toxin suggests that, at least in this system, factors other than a partially unfolded structure might be responsible (46Camacho A.G. Misselwitz R. Behlke J. Ayora S. Welfle K. Meinhart A. Lara B. Seanger W. Welfle H. Alonso J.C. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1701-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the results of the above studies, together with the data accumulating from single protein experiments (12Cherny I. Gazit E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8252-8261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 36Van Melderen L. Thi M.H. Lecchi P. Gottesman S. Couturier M. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 380: 1413-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), support the idea that across different TA systems the structural and thermodynamic instability of antitoxins compared with that of toxins is well preserved. In the present work, we investigated the secondary structure and thermodynamic stability of the purified YoeB toxin. We show that the purified toxin, unlike the natively unfolded YefM antitoxin, is a well folded protein at physiologic temperatures. We provide evidence that the YoeB toxin protein forms a tight complex with the YefM antitoxin and describe the thermodynamic stability of the complex. As in the Phd-Doc TA system, we found a marked difference in the thermodynamic stability of the YefM antitoxin and YoeB toxin proteins and discuss its relevance for the proper functioning of toxin-antitoxin systems. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of YefM·YoeB-His—A DNA fragment containing the coding sequence of the yefM-yoeB genes was produced by PCR using the chromosomal DNA of E. coli K-12 MC1061 as template and the primers ATGYEFM (5′-ATGAACTGTACAAAAGAGG-3′) and YOEB-NOSTOP (5′-ATAATGATAACGACACGCTG-3′). The PCR fragment was cloned into the pTrcHis2 vector (Invitrogen), fused to a c-Myc epitope and His-tagged to generate a pTMB plasmid, which was then transformed into E. coli TOP10 strain bacteria (Invitrogen). The transformed bacteria were grown in 2YT broth at 37 °C/200 rpm to an A600 of ∼0.4. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubation of 1 h. The cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4-NaOH, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl) and lysed by three passages through a French press cell (1400 psi). The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 × g, and the supernatant applied onto an XK 16/20 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences), packed with Ni-CAM HC affinity resin (Sigma) and pre-equilibrated with buffer A. Following extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted from the column in a single broad peak, using buffer A + 250 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the co-eluting YoeB-His and YefM proteins, identified by SDS-PAGE analyses, were combined and dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The protein solution was applied onto a HiPrep 16/10 Q-Sepharose XL ion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with buffer B. The fraction eluting from the column at 635 mm NaCl, using a gradient of 0.02 to 1 m NaCl in buffer B, contained both YoeB-His and YefM. Following dialysis against PBS (10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.3), the fraction was subjected to analytical reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) (Vydac), using a gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Purification of YoeB-His Protein—Incubation of the Ni-affinity fraction, containing YefM·YoeB-His, for 2–6 weeks at 4 °C or at room temperature removed the YefM portion. The incubation time varied from one production to another. The preparation was dialyzed against buffer B and loaded onto a HiTrap Q XL ion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). The YoeB-His protein was eluted in a single peak at 730 mm NaCl using a 0–1 m NaCl gradient in buffer B. At this point, the YoeB-His protein was at least 95% pure, as estimated by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels. YoeB-His was dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.3 before analysis. Purification of YefM—The YefM antitoxin was expressed and partially purified as previously described (12Cherny I. Gazit E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8252-8261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with a few changes. Briefly, a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-(His)6-YefM conjugate protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS (Novagen). Following cell lysis, GST-(His)6-YefM was purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). YefM proteins were separated from the GST-His tags using 16 units of factor Xa protease (Novagen)/1 mg of YefM fusion. To further purify YefM, the GST-His and YefM protein mixture was dialyzed against buffer B and applied onto a 1-ml HisTrap nickel affinity column (Amersham Biosciences). Pure YefM proteins were washed out with buffer B, and 1-ml fractions were collected. YefM was dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.3 for characterization analyses. Protein Identification and Characterization—The identity of YefM and YoeB-His was verified by the mass spectrometry analysis of protein spots isolated from Coomassie Blue-stained gels, according to established protocols (49Bandow J.E. Becher D. Büttner K. Hochgrafe F. Freiberg C. Brotz H. Hecker M. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein spots were excised from stained gels and treated with trypsin solution (Promega) for 16 h at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted from the gel onto a sample plate for MALDI-MS. Peptide mass was determined in the positive ion reflector mode in a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Peptide mass fingerprints were compared with databases using the MS-Fit program (prospector.ucsf.edu). To determine YoeB-His and YefM concentrations, we measured tyrosine and tryptophan absorbance in alkaline (0.1 m KOH) conditions. The YefM concentration was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 2381 m–1 cm–1 at 293.2 nm for single tyrosine (4 Tyr). For YoeB-His, we used an extinction coefficient of 1507 m–1 cm–1 for single tyrosine (6 Tyr) and 5377 m–1 cm–1 for single tryptophan (4 Trp) at 280 nm. As the exact proteinaceous content of the complex was unknown, we estimated the protein concentration using the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were obtained using an AVIV 202 spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature-controlled sample holder. Delta epsilon (Δϵ) was calculated as in Equation 1, Δε=θ/[c×L×3298](Eq. 1) where θ is the observed ellipticity, c is the concentration in mol/liter, and L is the path length in cm. For thermal denaturation experiments, the sample temperature was equilibrated for 30 s at each temperature interval, and the ellipticity at each wavelength was averaged for at least 1 min. Following the thermal denaturation cycle, samples were examined for turbidity (protein aggregation) by centrifuging for 10 min at 10,000 × g. If turbidity was found, then fresh protein samples were used to avoid faulty experiments and misrepresentation of results. To examine the induction of conformational transitions upon YefM and YoeB-His interactions, we analyzed their far-UV CD spectra using a tandem CD cuvette (Hellma). YefM and YoeB-His were added to separated tandem cells and the sum of ellipticity measured. Subsequently, the individual samples were mixed, and ellipticity was measured again. Fluorescence Labeling and Spectroscopy—Purified YefM or YoeB-His proteins were reacted for 2 h with 10 equivalents of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) fluorescein (Pierce) on ice in the dark. Unreacted dyes were separated from labeled protein solutions by overnight dialysis in the dark against PBS, pH 7.3, with four buffer exchanges. Fluorescein anisotropy measurements were made using a PerkinElmer LS-50B luminescence spectrometer. Anisotropy of the labeled solution of YefM or YoeB-His proteins (0.5 μm) was excited at 490 nm and monitored at 520 nm. Tryptophan anisotropy measurements were carried out using an ISS K2 fluorometer. YoeB-His protein (0.35 μm) was excited at 280 nm, and emission was monitored at 360 nm. For each single point, at least five measurements were collected, and their average"

Human electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF) 1The abbreviations used are: ETF, electron-transferring flavoprotein; MCAD, medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; DCIP, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol; DMGDH, dimethylglycine dehydrogenase. is a ubiquitous electron carrier that interacts with at least 10 different dehydrogenases, some of which are structurally distinct (1Thorpe C. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 471-486Google Scholar). Electrons are shuttled to the respiratory chain via ETF and subsequently transferred to the membrane-bound ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (1Thorpe C. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 471-486Google Scholar). ETF is a 63-kDa heterodimer containing one FAD and one AMP per dimer (2Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14355-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and folds into three distinct domains; the FAD is bound non-covalently to domain II that sits in a shallow bowl created by domains I and III (2Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14355-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Partners of ETF include the fatty-acyl-CoA dehydrogenases involved in β-oxidation of fatty acids, such as medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD). MCAD is a homotetrameric enzyme containing one FAD per 48-kDa monomer (3Lee H.J. Wang M. Paschke R. Nandy A. Ghisla S. Kim J.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12412-12420Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Other ETF partners include dehydrogenases involved in amino acid catabolism and 1-carbon metabolism (e.g. isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase, dimethylglycine dehydrogenase) (1Thorpe C. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 471-486Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the trimethylamine dehydrogenase·2ETF complex from Methylophilus methylotrophus and the human MCAD·ETF complex (4Leys D. Basran J. Talfournier F. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 5Toogood H.S. van Thiel A. Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Leys D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32904-32912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) reveal a dual interaction mode at the protein-protein interface. One interaction is centered on the conserved residue Leu-195β (human numbering) that serves as an anchor and docks onto a hydrophobic patch on the dehydrogenase partner surface. The second interaction is highly dynamic, with the ETF FAD domain-sampling conformations compatible with the protein-protein interface. Notwithstanding obvious differences in the structure of trimethylamine dehydrogenase and MCAD, the structure of the protein-protein interfaces of the trimethylamine dehydrogenase·2ETF and MCAD·ETF complexes are remarkably similar. Both ETF partners present a shallow concave surface with the redox cofactor buried beneath. A residue located near the center of this surface is proposed to interact transiently with the conserved residue Arg-249α (human numbering) found in the ETF FAD domain. This stabilizes productive conformations for electron transfer from the primary dehydrogenase to ETF. The combination of a simple and relatively robust mode of interaction centered on the leucine anchor, and of the ensuing conformational sampling of the FAD domain, explains how ETF can interact with several structurally distinct partner proteins. This provides a structural explanation that reconciles the inherently opposing properties of promiscuity and specificity in the interaction of ETF with partner proteins. Fast biological intraprotein electron transfer is governed by diffusional encounter and correct assembly of electron transfer complexes (6Page C.C. Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 7Leys D. Scrutton N.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 642-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Physiological redox complexes are characterized by their transient nature and extremely high rates of complex dissociation which supports high turnover and rapid electron transfer along a metabolic redox pathway. Several features of the redox complex protein-protein interface are believed to favor fast dissociation, in particular the small size and low geometric complementarity (8Crowley P.B. Carrondo M.A. Proteins. 2004; 15: 603-612Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Here we report solution data that provides evidence that a single conserved glutamate residue in ETF is essential for rapid electron transfer, despite being located far from the protein-protein interface. Surprisingly, and in sharp contrast to the observed disorder in wild-type ETF complexes, the crystal structure of the E165βA ETF·MCAD complex reveals the FAD domain restricted to a single, productive conformation. We propose Glu-165β plays an essential role in ensuring high complex dissociation rates by stabilizing distinct and non-productive conformations of the FAD domain and postulate conformational sampling involves random interaction of the FAD domain residue Arg-249α with key residues on the protein-protein interface. Crystallogenesis and Data Collection—Crystals of the free human ETF E165βA mutant were grown using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. The reservoir solution contained 0.1 m cacodylate, pH 6.5, containing 0.1 m MgSO4 and 20% polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethylether. Crystals were flash-cooled in mother liquor with 10% polyethylene glycol 200, and a full 2.1-Å data set was collected on a single crystal at station X11, DESY (Hamburg, Germany). A solution of a 1:1 mixture of recombinant human E165βA ETF and MCAD tetramer was prepared and used for subsequent crystallization trials. Crystals of the E165βA ETF·MCAD complex were grown as described previously (5Toogood H.S. van Thiel A. Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Leys D. J. Biol.

Protein Production and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The plasmids encoding MCAD (pTrc99c) and hETF (pK18) were kindly supplied by S. Ghisla and J. Vockley. The plasmid encoding rat DMGDH (pH6EX3-mMe2GlyDH) was kindly supplied by R. Brandsch and M. Barile. Mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and verified by automated DNA sequencing. The plasmids were transformed into JM109 cells (Stratagene). Cells containing wild-type and mutant plasmids were grown in 2YT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (MCAD) or 34 μg/ml kanamycin (hETF) at 35 °C to an optical density of 1 at 600 nm followed by a 16 h induction at 25 °C with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. ETF and MCAD were purified as described previously (5Toogood H.S. van Thiel A. Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Leys D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32904-32912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cells containing the DMGDH plasmid were grown in LB medium containing 100 μm ampicillin at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.7 at 595 nm. Induction was carried out with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 12 h at 30 °C. The enzyme was purified using anionic chromatography (DEAE) and a High Trap chelating column charged with nickel ions. Dimethylglycine dehydrogenase was dialyzed and stored in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.05% sodium azide at 4 °C. Steady-state Kinetic Assays—Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity was determined at 15 °C using a modification of the 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP)-reduction method of Okamura-Ikeda et al. (9Okumara-Ikeda K. Ikeda Y. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1338-1345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 50 μm octanoyl-CoA, 100 μm DCIP with either 200 μm ferricenium hexafluorophosphate or 0.5-230 μm hETF as intermediate electron acceptors. Reduction of DCIP was monitored continuously at 600 nm. DMGDH enzyme activity was determined at 25 °C using a modification of the DCIP reduction assay of Okamura-Ikeda et al. (9Okumara-Ikeda K. Ikeda Y. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1338-1345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.5 containing 10 mm dimethylglycine, 10 mm potassium cyanide, 200 μm DCIP, and 25-100 μm hETF. Steady-state Kinetic Analysis of Electron Transfer with E165βA ETF—A steady-state kinetic analysis of electron transfer between MCAD and ETF was performed using ETF and DCIP as the terminal electron acceptor. 2DCIP accepts electrons only from ETF, and direct reduction by MCAD is not possible (9Okumara-Ikeda K. Ikeda Y. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1338-1345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The coupled assay is therefore suitable for studies of interprotein electron transfer in the MCAD·ETF complex. Studies with the wild-type complex using DCIP produced an apparent kcat value of 2.00 ± 0.05 s-1 and Km value for the variable substrate (ETF) of 7.7 ± 0.4 μm. Under identical conditions, reactions with wild-type MCAD and the E165βA ETF showed a 100-fold increase in specificity (kcat/Km) compared with the wild-type complex (Table I). These results suggest that the mutation has altered the population of conformations of the flavin domain within the complex in favor of the electron transfer competent state. A similar increase in the efficiency of electron transfer to DCIP was observed when comparing the wild-type ETF parameters with the E165βA mutant for the reaction with the liver enzyme DMGDH. DMGDH is a physiological redox partner of ETF and is structurally distinct and unrelated to the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family (10Binzak B.A. Vockley J.G. Jenkins R.B. Vockley J. Mol. Genet.

This demonstrates that the effect of the E165βA mutation on the kinetic behavior of ETF protein complexes is independent of the nature of the ETF partner.Table ISteady-state kinetic values obtained for the reduction of DCIP by ETF partners with hETF as an intermediate electron acceptor All MCAD mutants had similar activities to the wild-type (WT) when using ferricenium hexafluorophosphate as intermediate electron acceptor (data not shown).ETF partnerETFkcatKmkcat/Kms-1μms-1 μm-1MCAD WTWT2.00 ± 0.057.7 ± 0.40.324MCAD W166AWT<0.001MCAD W166FWT0.051MCAD E212AWT0.002MCAD E359AWT1.78 ± 0.1617.9 ± 2.70.099MCAD E359QWT0.27 ± 0.021.55 ± 0.470.174MCAD Q163AWT2.35 ± 0.115.27 ± 0.980.445MCAD Y360FWT2.57 ± 0.154.4 ± 0.80.584MCAD Y360AWT0.139MCAD WTE165βA3.35 ± 0.120.1 ± 0.0233.5MCAD WTE165βQ2.01 ± 0.042.59 ± 0.200.776MCAD WTR249αA0.001DMGDH WTWT3.8 ± 0.439.9 ± 6.80.095DMGDH WTE165βA1.38 ± 0.058.85 ± 0.900.156 Open table in a new tab Crystal Structure of E165βA ETF—The crystal structure of the free human E165βA ETF shows no significant differences compared with wild-type human ETF, with the obvious exception of the mutation itself (Fig. 1). A minor deviation in the position of the FAD domain is likely due to different crystal packing contacts. It is of interest to note that the corresponding residue, Glu-163β, in the structure of M. methylotrophus ETF is in close contact with Arg-237α (corresponding to Arg-249α in human ETF) and the FAD isoalloxazine ring (4Leys D. Basran J. Talfournier F. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Small angle x-ray scattering studies performed on both ETF proteins have indicated that the solvent envelope is broadened in the region of the FAD domain (12Jones M. Talfournier F. Bobrov A.

A superimposition of the free human and M. methylotrophus ETF structures generates a hybrid ETF with a very similar shape and volume to the observed solvent envelopes. Based on these results, it is proposed that human wild-type ETF exists in solution as an ensemble of two interconverting states viz state I, where Arg-249α is positioned close to Leu-185β (as seen in the human crystal structures), and state II, where Arg-249α interacts with Glu-165β (as seen in the M. methylotrophus crystal structure) (Fig. 2). The relative population of each state is likely to be species-dependent, consistent with the selection of different conformational states during the crystallization of human and M. methylotrophus ETF.Fig. 2Comparison of the human and M. methylotrophus ETF crystal structures. The human ETF crystal structure (PDB code 1EFV) is displayed to the left in ribbons (colored green for the β-subunit and blue for the α-subunit) with the FAD represented by atom-colored sticks with yellow carbon atoms.

However, in sharp contrast to the lack of significant electron density for the FAD domain in either wild-type ETF·MCAD or ETF·trimethylamine dehydrogenase complexes, the FAD domain of ETF is clearly visible in the electron density for the mutant complex, where it occupies a position close to the MCAD surface. Close examination of the electron density maps of the wild-type ETF·MCAD complex reveals features that are consistent with very low occupancy of the FAD domain in a similar orientation to that observed in the mutant complex (Fig. 3). Real space search programs such as FFFEAR (14Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr Sect. D. 1998; 54: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) indeed place the FAD domain in a similar position to the conformation observed in the E165βA ETF·MCAD complex, although refinement of the resulting model does not lead to significant improvement in either electron density or refinement statistics. We conclude that the occupancy of the FAD domain for this conformation is significantly lower in the wild-type complex and at the threshold of detection limits. No features could be observed in the electron density map for either wild-type or mutant complexes that would indicate the presence of conformations distinct from the position of the FAD domain described below. A comparison of electron density quality and B factors with other regions in the protein·protein complex indicates the FAD domain retains considerable flexibility and/or does not fully occupy the observed conformation. With the exception of a few key residues discussed below, there are no significant differences between the overall structure of the FAD domain in the E165βA ETF·MCAD complex and that of the free ETF structures (2Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14355-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Similarly, no significant differences are observed for the MCAD dimer that contacts the FAD domain when compared with either the wild-type ETF·MCAD complex or free MCAD crystal structures (5Toogood H.S. van Thiel A. Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Leys D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32904-32912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 3Lee H.J. Wang M. Paschke R. Nandy A. Ghisla S. Kim J.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12412-12420Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The contact surface between MCAD and the FAD domain is ∼330 Å2 with a shape complementarity value of 0.56 (15Lawrence M.C. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). The small size of the surface, low shape complementarity, and relatively poor electron density indicate that this interaction is weak and therefore is of a transient nature. In comparison, the contact surface between the FAD domain and the other ETF domains in the free human ETF crystal structures amounts to 850 Å2 with a shape complementarity value of 0.74. In the E165βA ETF·MCAD complex, the FAD domain·MCAD contact is centered on a salt bridge between Arg-249α of the FAD domain and MCAD Glu-212 (Fig. 4). In addition, a bridging water molecule connects Arg-249α and MCAD Glu-359. Direct hydrogen bonds are formed between ETF Gln-285α and MCAD Asn-354, Gln-265α and the carboxyl group of MCAD Glu-359, and a phosphate of ETF-bound FAD and MCAD Gln-163. Additional ionic interactions can be made between several residues, but are not directly observed because of the lack of significant electron density for either or both side chains. This network of contacts positions the ETF FAD in close proximity to the MCAD FAD, with a smallest distance between the isoalloxazine planes of 9.7 Å. The indole group of MCAD Trp-166 is wedged between both isoalloxazine ring systems and is in van der Waals contact with both the C7 and C8 methyl groups of the ETF-bound FAD, as well as being stacked with the MCAD FAD isoalloxazine group. The short interflavin distance and intervening aromatic residue are optimal for fast interprotein electron transfer (16Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). Steady-state Kinetic Analysis of Electron Transfer in Mutant MCAD·ETF Complexes Altered at the FAD Domain-MCAD Interface—Mutation of residues located at the ETF FAD domain-MCAD contact surface leads to severely compromised interprotein electron transfer rates (Table II). A mutation of Glu-212 to Ala decreases the kcat/Km value from 0.324 s-1 μm-1 (wild-type) to 0.002 s-1 μm-1, consistent with disruption of the key salt bridge network centered on Arg-249α. In turn, mutation of Arg-249α to Ala leads to a similar decrease in the value of kcat/Km (0.001 s-1 μm-1). A mutation of Glu-359 to either Gln or Ala leads to a less pronounced decrease in the value of kcat/Km to 0.174 and 0.099 s-1 μm-1, respectively, consistent with the fact this residue is only indirectly involved in binding Arg-249α. The mutation of Trp-166 to Phe and Ala substantially decreases the rate of electron transfer (as measured by the value of kcat/Km); second order rate constants are 0.051 and <0.001 s-1μm-1, respectively. In contrast, mutation of Gln-163 to Ala has little effect on overall rates of electron transfer indicating this residue is not essential for transient formation of the electron transfer reactive conformation. This is further supported by the lack of sequence conservation of this residue when aligning the human acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Notwithstanding the small size and relatively weak surface complementarity between the FAD domain and the MCAD surface, several residues are involved in hydrophobic packing. The mutation of MCAD Tyr-360 that forms a hydrophobic stacking interaction with ETF Gln-265α to Phe has little effect on the determined kinetic parameters. In contrast, the Y360A removes this stacking interaction and drastically affects electron transfer rates. Surprisingly, alignment of human ETF partners that belong to acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family reveals that Glu-359 is strictly conserved as either Glu or Asp, whereas Glu-212 can be replaced by Leu or Gln. It seems that the exact nature of the interactions made with the FAD domain can differ significantly even for closely related ETF partners. A Dynamic Model for Conformational Sampling—The E165βA mutation is located on the surface of the cavity occupied by the FAD domain within the wild-type ETF·MCAD complex and is not in direct contact with the FAD domain in the complex structure. How then can a mutation distant from the FAD domain-MCAD interface lead to a significant increase in the occupancy of the FAD domain at that interface? We suggest that, within the complex, Glu-165β forms transient interactions between the FAD domain and the surface of ETF contributed by domains I and III as observed for the free ETF crystal structures (4Leys D. Basran J. Talfournier F. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 13Chohan K.K. Jones M. Grossmann J.G. Frerman F.E. Scrutton N.S. Sutcliffe M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34142-34147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A single mutation leading to an increase in occupancy at the MCAD-ETF interface can be rationalized if other distinct conformations exist with lifetimes similar to the electron transfer competent state (state III). The stabilization of these alternate conformations would involve specific interactions with Glu-165β, which are lost in the mutant ETF·MCAD complex. We suggest that one such conformation is that observed for the FAD domain in the free human ETF crystal structures (state I). There are no adverse clashes between ETF and MCAD on docking this conformation of the FAD domain into the ETF·MCAD complex. Following mutation of Glu-165β to Ala, a single hydrogen bond with Asn-259α is removed at the interface of the FAD domain and other ETF domains in state I. This leads to destabilization of state I, shifting a state I ⇄ III equilibrium toward that of state III. In a two-state dynamic model, one might expect to see evidence for states I and III in the crystal structures for the ETF·MCAD complexes, but there is no evidence for an alternative conformation to state III in the crystal structures of both the wild-type and mutant complexes. Therefore, it is proposed that there are at least two additional conformations that compete with state III; these are state I discussed above and state II where the FAD domain occupies a position similar to that observed in the crystal structure of M. methylotrophus ETF (4Leys D. Basran J. Talfournier F. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). If the conformation observed in the crystal structure of M. methylotrophus ETF (state II) is adopted in the ETF·MCAD complex, Arg-249α can interact directly with Glu-165β. Removal of the Glu-165β side chain by mutagenesis would destabilize state II and lead to a shift in the equilibrium position toward alternate conformational states. Unlike state I, stabilization of state II requires the presence of a negatively charged residue at position 165β of ETF. The mutation of Glu-165β to Gln-165β also leads to an increase in the electron transfer rate from MCAD to ETF, which is consistent with Glu-165β playing a key role in stabilizing state II. It is proposed that a multistate dynamic model is operational during conformational sampling of the FAD domain in the ETF·MCAD complex and, by analogy, in other ETF·partner protein complexes. On complex formation with a redox partner, we propose that the ETF FAD domain samples a minimum of three conformational states, two of which resemble conformations occupied in solution (states I and II). The third conformation (state III) represents the electron transfer competent state (Fig. 5). The mutation of Glu-165β, which is conserved throughout the ETF family, leads to destabilization of states I and II and a consequent increase in the occupancy of state III. The effect is to enhance the rate of DCIP reduction and the increased occupancy of state III enables visualization of the FAD domain in the crystal structure of the mutant ETF·MCAD complex. For highly dynamic protein·protein complexes, these studies demonstrate that targeted mutagenesis of interface residues can lead to a perturbation in the equilibrium distribution of conformational states. This allows further insight to be gained into the structures of multiple conformational states that are present at only low occupancy in wild-type protein complexes, and our approach should therefore find general use in structural studies of dynamic protein·protein complexes. Unlike other (small) electron carriers, ETF docks initially onto the surface of partner proteins via a “recognition” peptide element located within an anchor domain. This domain is spatially distinct from the redox-active domain that binds FAD (4Leys D. Basran J. Talfournier F. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 5Toogood H.S. van Thiel A. Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Leys D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32904-32912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The atom packing of the static interaction mediated by the anchor domain and centered on residue Leu-195β is similar to that found typically within a protein interior and not the poorly packed interfaces of other electron transfer complexes (8Crowley P.B. Carrondo M.A. Proteins. 2004; 15: 603-612Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The “looser” interfacial packing of the FAD domain with MCAD in the electron transfer competent conformation (state III) has a more characteristic architecture for a physiological redox complex. The formation of an equilibrium distribution of conformations of the FAD domain ensures that the electron transfer competent conformation (state III) is relatively short-lived in the wild-type complex. The lifetime of state III is increased following selective destabilization of non-productive conformations by mutagenesis of Glu-165β, thereby hindering complex dissociation. This is not optimal for reactions of ETF with natural partner proteins where dissociation of the ETF·MCAD complex is required prior to formation of a second complex with membrane bound ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase. With artificial electron acceptors (e.g. DCIP) that can accept electrons from the ETF·MCAD complex, the rate of complex dissociation is irrelevant. Electron transfer to DCIP is enhanced in those mutant complexes where complex dissociation is hindered because of a relative stabilization of the electron transfer competent conformation (state III). Thus, although a single glutamate residue in MCAD (Glu-212) is required to stabilize the electron transfer competent state (state III), a single glutamate residue in ETF (Glu-165β) is also required to stabilize non-productive conformations, thereby optimizing the rate of complex dissociation."

A second UFA auxotroph was isolated which corresponds to the fabB gene, which encodes β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I (6Clark D.P. de Mendoza D. Polacco M.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5897-5902Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In fabA and fabB mutants, saturated fatty acid synthesis persists because of the presence of another dehydratase, FabZ (7Mohan S. Kelly T.M. Eveland S.S. Raetz C.R.H. Anderson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32896-32903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and another elongation-condensing enzyme, FabF (8D'Agnolo G. Rosenfeld I.S. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5289-5294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11949-11956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The FabZ isozyme (β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase) is expressed ubiquitously in type II systems, cannot carry out the isomerase reaction, and is the only type of dehydratase that exists in most bacteria. Although FabA and FabZ have many primary sequence characteristics in common, bioinformatic analysis clearly divide the two subtypes. Specifically, there are distinct differences in the active site residues, an Asp in FabA and a Glu in FabZ, and FabA is a dimer (10Leesong M. Henderson B.S. Gillig J.R. Schwab J.M. Smith J.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 253-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) whereas FabZ is a hexamer (11Kimber M.S. Martin F. Lu Y. Houston S. Vedadi M. Dharamsi A. Feibig K.M. Schmid M. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52593-52602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). FabZ does play a role in UFA synthesis by functioning in the elongation of both saturated and unsaturated long chain acyl-ACP, whereas FabA most efficiently processes saturated chain lengths 10 carbons and shorter (12Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27795-27801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Likewise, the FabF condensing readily elongates 16:1 to 18:1 UFA (9Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11949-11956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the inability to support UFA synthesis in fabB mutants leads to the conclusion that FabF cannot elongate a key intermediate in UFA biosynthesis in vivo, most likely cis-3-decenoyl-ACP (1Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis R. Gross C.A. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E.

Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The availability of numerous bacterial genome sequences allows the reconstruction of type II fatty acid synthesis in these organisms using bioinformatics analysis tools. It is notable that fabA and fabB genes occur together in Gram-negative bacteria that produce UFA (13Campbell J.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5982-5990Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, many anaerobes that synthesize UFA do not have a recognizable fabA homolog in their genomes and also have a FabF rather than a FabB subtype of elongation-condensing enzyme. In these organisms UFA is synthesized by a different mechanism. Streptococcus pneumoniae produces straight chain saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids predominantly of 16- and 18-carbon chain lengths (14Trombe M.C. Laneelle M.A. Laneelle G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 574: 290-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This organism does not utilize a FabA-like mechanism for introducing a double bond into the growing acyl chain, but rather accomplishes this task using FabM, a trans-2, cis-3-decenoyl-ACP isomerase (15Marrakchi H. Choi K.-H. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44809-44816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Enterococcus faecalis also has a fatty acid composition similar to E. coli, but also lacks a FabA, FabB, and FabM. However, E. faecalis has two FabZ homologs, and Wang and Cronan (16Wang H. Cronan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34489-34495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) show that one of these genes, now called FabN, functions as a dehydratase/isomerase analogous to FabA, whereas the other possessed only dehydratase activity (Fig. 1). Thus, one cannot predict the biochemical activity of this class of proteins based on bioinformatics. The comparison of the x-ray structures of FabA (10Leesong M. Henderson B.S. Gillig J.R. Schwab J.M. Smith J.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 253-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and FabZ (11Kimber M.S. Martin F. Lu Y. Houston S. Vedadi M. Dharamsi A. Feibig K.M. Schmid M. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52593-52602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), coupled with the analysis of site-directed mutants shows that the differences in the catalytic activities of the enzymes are not the result of distinct catalytic residues in the active site or the side chains of the residues that compose the substrate binding pocket (11Kimber M.S. Martin F. Lu Y. Houston S. Vedadi M. Dharamsi A. Feibig K.M. Schmid M. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52593-52602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Both proteins adopt a “hot dog” fold with a long central α-helix (the hot dog) surrounded by several β-sheets (the bun). A detailed comparison of these closely related structures led to the hypothesis that the different biochemistry of these enzymes is caused by differences in the β-sheet structures that alter the orientation of the central α-helix and thus the shape of the active site tunnel preventing the substrate from adopting a cis conformation in FabZ. The existence of two even more closely related enzymes, EfFabN and EfFabZ, with different catalytic properties but identical active site residues, allows us the opportunity to test the working hypothesis using domain swapping experiments to determine whether the isomerase activity is caused by the structure of the β-strands that control the shape of the active site tunnel.

Cloning and Construction of Chimeric Enzymes—The EffabN and EffabZ genes were amplified from genomic DNA of E. faecalis by primer sets EfFabNstart/EfFabNend and EfFabZstart/EfFabZend. The PCR products were ligated into plasmid pCR2.1 and sequenced. The plasmids were isolated and digested with NdeI and BamHI, and the gene fragments were isolated and ligated into plasmid pET15b digested with the same enzymes to generate the EfFabN and EfFabZ expression vectors pYL3 and pYL4. Chimeras were generated by overlapping PCR method. Sequences of internal primers are listed in Table I. T7 promoter primer with reverse primers and T7 terminator primer with forward primers were used to generate PCR fragments corresponding to the specific region of the two enzymes. After purification from agarose gels, these fragments were mixed with the right combination to serve as template, and T7 promoter and T7 terminator primers were used to amplify the recombinant molecule. PCR products from this step were ligated to PCR 2.1 vector and sequenced to ensure the chimeric constructs were correct. The chimeric genes were cut out with NdeI and BamHI and transferred into pET15b to generate the expression vectors.Table IPrimers used in this study All primers are listed in the 5′ → 3′ direction.

The selected transformants were cultured in LB medium with antibiotic (50 μg/ml carbenicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol) at 37 °C until A600 reached 0.6. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and incubation continued overnight at 20 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation (6,000 rpm, 4 °C, 15 min), and cell pellets were lysed using a French press. Soluble proteins were applied to a Ni2+-agarose column and washed with 40 mm imidazole-containing metal chelation affinity chromatography buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl). His-tagged proteins were eluted with 500 mm imidazole in the same buffer. Proteins were quantitated by the Bradford method (17Bradford M.M. Anal.

The molecular masses of EfFabN and EfFabZ were estimated using globular protein standards and a calibration curve. Enzymatic Assays—The ability of the individual His6-tagged EfFabN and EfFabZ to carry out the dehydratase and/or isomerase activities was measured using a reconstituted system essentially as described previously (12Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27795-27801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 15Marrakchi H. Choi K.-H. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

The reaction mixtures contained 100 μm ACP, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 100 μm NADPH, 50 μm octanoyl-CoA, 100 μm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity, 52 mCi/mmol), 1.0 μg of MtFabH, 1.0 μg of EcFabD, 1.0 μg of EcFabG, 3 μg of SpFabF with 1.0 μg of EfFabN or 1.0 μg of EfFabZ or 1.0 μg of chimeric proteins in a final volume of 40 μl. The assay mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and analyzed by conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis in 13% polyacrylamide gels containing 2.5 m urea. Electrophoresis was performed at 25 °C and 32 mA/gel. The gels were dried, and the bands were quantitated using a PhosphorImager screen. In the experiments determining FabN isomerase activity, EcFabZ was added to the reaction mixture, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before the addition of EfFabN. Specific activities were calculated from the slopes of the plot of product formation versus protein concentration in the assay. Characteristics of E. faecalis fab Genes—An analysis of the type II fatty acid biosynthetic genes in E. faecalis shows that they are located in two clusters in the genome (Fig. 2A). S. pneumoniae, a closely related bacteria that also synthesizes UFAs, has only one fab gene cluster in its genome corresponding to the large gene cluster in E. faecalis. A comparison of the predicted protein sequences of E. faecalis fab genes with that of S. pneumoniae showed that the 12-gene cluster contains all of the gene homologs of the S. pneumoniae fab gene cluster except fabM, which is an essential isomerase to make UFAs in S. pneumoniae (15Marrakchi H. Choi K.-H. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44809-44816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Fozo E.M. Quivey R.G. J Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4152-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A separate 3-gene cluster contains homologs of E. coli fabI and fabF1, in addition to fabN, a fabZ homolog that possess the ability to introduce double bonds into growing acyl chains in vivo (16Wang H. Cronan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34489-34495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). FabT, the predicted transcriptional regulator in several Gram-positive bacterial fatty acid biosynthetic pathways (24Lu Y.-J. Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), is located at the beginning of the 12-gene cluster. FabT belongs to the MarR superfamily, which are typically dimers that utilize a winged helix motif to bind a DNA palindrome (25Alekshun M.N. Kim Y.S. Levy S.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1394-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 26Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Mealy T.R. Seaton B.A. Head J.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Often bacterial transcription factors are autoregulated, and their DNA binding motifs are located within their own promoter regions. One DNA palindrome was found in the promoter region of FabT (Fig. 2A). Significantly, this same palindrome is found in the promoters of the fabI, fabF1, and fabK genes (Fig. 2A). Unraveling the transcriptional regulation in this large cluster is beyond the scope of this study. The significance of the bioinformatics analysis is that it ties the 3- and 12-gene clusters for fatty acid biosynthesis and suggests that the fabI, fabF1-fabN, and fabK genes may be coordinately regulated. Purification of EfFabN and EfFabZ—EfFabN and EfFabZ were cloned into pET15b vector and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Purified His-tagged EfFabZ and EfFabN had monomer molecular masses of ≈18 kDa based on SDS-gel electrophoresis, consistent with their primary sequence (Fig. 3). Recently, the crystal structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa FabZ was solved, and it forms a classic “trimer of dimers” structure (11Kimber M.S. Martin F. Lu Y. Houston S. Vedadi M. Dharamsi A. Feibig K.M. Schmid M. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52593-52602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Accordingly, PaFabZ behaves as a hexamer exhibiting a Stokes radius on gel filtration chromatography corresponding to a 112-kDa protein (11Kimber M.S. Martin F. Lu Y. Houston S. Vedadi M. Dharamsi A. Feibig K.M. Schmid M. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52593-52602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), whereas EcFabA is a dimer both in its x-ray structure (10Leesong M. Henderson B.S. Gillig J.R. Schwab J.M. Smith J.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 253-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and in solution. Both EfFabN and EfFabZ are hexamers in solution as determined by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 3), which illustrates that they have structures similar to that of PaFabZ. Enzyme Activity of EfFabN and EfFabZ—We used a complex, multicomponent reconstituted fatty acid biosynthetic system described under “Experimental Procedures” to detect the dehydratase and isomerase activities of purified EfFabN and EfFabZ in vitro (Fig. 4). This assay used enzymes from different sources to synthesize substrate for the dehydratases and followed the same principals as used previously in the characterization of the FabA and FabM isomerases (12Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27795-27801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 15Marrakchi H. Choi K.-H. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44809-44816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The identify of the band indicated as β-hydroxy-cis-5-dodecenoyl-ACP was established by mass spectrometry (15Marrakchi H. Choi K.-H. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44809-44816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The assay employed the MtFabH enzyme (from M. tuberculosis) to generate β-keto-[14C]decanoyl-ACP from octanoyl-CoA and [2-14C]malonyl-ACP (via EcFadD). The NADPH-dependent Ec-FabG reduced the intermediate to the substrate for the assays, β-hydroxy[14C]decanoyl-ACP (Fig. 4, lane 1). Addition of Sp-FabF, the elongation-condensing enzyme of S. pneumoniae, to the reaction did not, and should not, yield any new products (Fig. 4, lane 2). The addition of EcFabA (Fig. 4, lane 3) resulted in the conversion of the β-hydroxy intermediate to a mixture of trans-2- and cis-3-decenoyl-ACPs. The enoyl-ACP cannot be elongated by the SpFabF-condensing enzyme, but the cis-3 intermediate is a substrate. Accordingly, in the presence of SpFabF the cis-3-decenoyl-ACP is condensed with malonyl-ACP, and after reduction by EcFabG, a new band appeared on the gel corresponding to β-hydroxy-cis-5-dodecenoyl-ACP (Fig. 4, lane 4). Because this reaction mixture did not contain an enoyl-ACP reductase, additional rounds of elongation did not occur unless this product was isomerized again by FabA. FabA is selective for 10-carbon substrates and characteristically less active with unsaturated β-hydroxy intermediates (12Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27795-27801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), therefore there is only a trace conversion to β-hydroxy-14:2(Δ5,7)-ACP (the faint band below the β-hydroxy-12:1(Δ5)-ACP. The addition of EcFabZ converted the β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP to the enoyl-ACP (Fig. 4, lane 5); however, the addition of SpFabF to this reaction did not lead to the appearance of the elongated 12-carbon unsaturated intermediate (Fig. 4, lane 6). The addition of EfFabN to the base reaction yielded enoyl-ACP (Fig. 4, lane 7), and β-hydroxy-cis-5-dodecanoyl-ACP appeared when SpFabF was added (Fig. 4, lane 8). Thus, EfFabN is capable of not only dehydrating β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP but also isomerizing trans-2-decenoyl-ACP to cis-3-decenoyl-ACP in vitro. On the other hand, EfFabZ dehydrated β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP (Fig. 4, lane 9) but lacked isomerase activity. These data establish that purified EfFabN is capable of isomerizing the trans-2-enoyl-ACP to the cis-3 intermediate, whereas EfFabZ cannot. This in vitro gel assay system was used to evaluate the relative activities of these two enzymes. The EcFabD/MtFabH/EcFabG system was used to present EfFabN and EfFabZ with β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP as a dehydratase substrate. The formation of enoyl-ACP was measured as a function of EfFabN or EfFabZ concentration, and a specific activity calculated by linear regression curves (Fig. 5A). The EcFabD/MtFabH/Ec-FabG/EcFabZ system was used to provide the trans-2-enoyl-ACP substrate for measuring isomerase activity. The formation of an elongation product with an excess concentration of Sp-FabF arising from EfFabN isomerase activity as a function of EfFabN in the assay was used to determine the isomerase-specific activity of EfFabN (Fig. 5B). The dehydratase activity of EfFabN, 0.07 ± 0.002 pmol/min/ng, was much less than that of EfFabZ, which was 2.2 ± 0.07 pmol/min/ng, whereas the dehydratase activities of the two controls, EcFabA and EcFabZ, were 0.34 ± 0.03 and 0.36 ± 0.003 pmol/min/ng, respectively. Thus, EfFabN had the lowest dehydratase activity of the four enzymes in the coupled assay. The isomerase activity of Ef-FabN for the 10-carbon substrate was 0.6 ± 0.03 pmol/min/μg, whereas the specific activity of EcFabA under these same assay conditions was 52 ± 1 pmol/min/μg (Fig. 5B). Thus, FabN was 86-fold less efficient than EcFabA in the formation of cis-double bonds in the in vitro fatty acid synthase assay reconstituted with the indicated constellation of E. coli enzymes and ACP cofactor. Also, FabN was about 2-fold less active than the FabM isomerase required for unsaturated fatty acid synthesis in S. pneumoniae (15Marrakchi H. Choi K.-H. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44809-44816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although this assay is capable of clearly distinguishing dehydratases from isomerases, the activities of the FabM and FabN isomerases are low compared with FabA. The reasons for the low activities of the Gram-positive isomerases in this reconstituted assay are attributed in part to the use of heterologous ACP and elongation-condensing enzymes in the experiment. These data are consistent with the inability of fabN expression to complement the growth defect in fabA(Ts) mutants (16Wang H. Cronan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34489-34495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Chimera Construction and Enzyme Activity—The working hypothesis developed from our structural analysis of EcFabA and PaFabZ (11Kimber M.S. Martin F. Lu Y. Houston S. Vedadi M. Dharamsi A. Feibig K.M. Schmid M. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52593-52602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) was that the isomerase activity depends on the shape of the substrate binding tunnel, which is controlled by the positioning of the β-strands (the bun) surrounding the long central helix (the hot dog). The existence of these two closely related FabZ enzymes with different catalytic properties provided an opportunity to test this hypothesis concerning the basis for their distinct catalytic properties. The goal was to determine the minimal structural features required to convert a dehydratase (EfFabZ) into a dehydratase/isomerase (Ef-FabN). Structural models of EfFabN and EfFabZ were generated using the PaFabZ x-ray structure (11Kimber M.S. Martin F. Lu Y. Houston S. Vedadi M. Dharamsi A. Feibig K.M. Schmid M. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52593-52602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) as the template. There are several amino acid differences between EfFabN and EfFabZ which were predicted to reside in the substrate binding tunnel and which might be responsible for the isomerase activity of EfFabN. These include Asn-16, Ile-20, Thr-57, Ile-88, and Asn-92. We introduced each of these point mutations into EcFabZ and measured their activities. All of the mutants retained dehydratase activity, and none acquired the isomerase function (data not shown). The next approach was to construct a series of chimeric EfFabZ/N proteins to determine the minimum structural elements required to transform EfFabZ into an isomerase. The transition points for chimera construction were selected by based upon the structure of PaFabZ (11Kimber M.S. Martin F. Lu Y. Houston S. Vedadi M. Dharamsi A. Feibig K.M. Schmid M. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52593-52602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and are mapped onto the primary sequences in Fig. 2B. EfFabN and EfFabZ both have high similarity to each other and PaFabZ (EfFabN has 55% similarity and 41.6% identity to PaFabZ; EfFabZ has 56.5% similarity and 43.5% identity to PaFabZ), and their structural folding patterns are clearly predicted to be similar to those determined for PaFabZ. The divisions between chimeras were made at the boundary of loops between the β-sheet structures with at least one identical residue in both proteins occurring after the joint (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2C depicts schematically the chimeras made from introducing different EfFabN domains into EfFabZ. All chimeras were hexamers as judged by gel filtration chromatography and retained catalytic activity. First, EfFabN and Ef-FabZ were divided to two parts, and a swap of the corresponding regions of EfFabN and EfFabZ was made to generate Chimera1 and Chimera2. The analysis of these two proteins showed that both of them retained the ability to dehydrate β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP to enoyl ACP (Fig. 6, lanes 7 and 8). On the other hand, only Chimera2 containing the C-terminal part of EfFabN possessed 43% of the isomerase activity of EfFabN as indicated by the formation of the β-hydroxy-cis-5-dodecenoyl-ACP (Fig. 6, lane 8). We then divided the C-terminal part of EfFabN into three pieces to narrow down the region. Chimera3 and Chimera4 had only dehydratase activity (Fig. 6, lanes 9 and 10), leading to the conclusion that β3 and the following loop region of EfFabN were essential requirements for isomerase activity. However, the fact that Chimera5 lacked isomerase activity (Fig. 6, lane 11) illustrated that β3 and following loop were not sufficient to support isomerase activity. The combination of β3 and β4 (Chimera6) possessed isomerase activity at 38% of the Ef-FabN level (Fig. 6, lane 12), whereas the combination of β3 with β5 and β6 (Chimera7) did not (Fig. 6, lane 13). These data show that the β3–β4 region of EfFabN was necessary and sufficient to transform EfFabZ from a dehydratase to a dehydratase/isomerase. The isomerase activity of Chimera6 showed the important role of the combination of the β3/β4 strands in specifying isomerase activity. Two residues, Phe-86 from β3 and Val-108 from β4 in EfFabZ, were candidates for mediating this effect based on the modeling of EfFabN and EfFabZ using the structure of PaFabZ as a template. The corresponding residues in EfFabN are Ile-88 and Phe-110. In both structures, these two residues sit face to face on the outside of the α3-helix in a position to modulate the orientation of the helix, therefore, we prepared single and double mutants to replace these residues and assessed the isomerase activity of the constructs. EfFabZ(F86I), EfFabZ(V108F), and EfFabZ(F86I, V108F) were all found to retain dehydratase activity, but all three mutants lacked the ability to isomerize the substrate (not shown). These data suggest that the conversion of EfFabZ to EfFabN requires the sum of the differences between the two β3/β4 strands, rather than a simple single amino acid substitution. Conclusions—These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the shape of the substrate binding tunnel is the major determinant of the isomerase activity of the FabZ class of β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratases. The replacement of the β3/β4 strands in EfFabZ with the corresponding strands from EfFabN were the minimal requirements to convert EfFabZ from a dehydratase to a dehydratase/isomerase. Molecular modeling of the EfFabZ and EfFabN clearly indicate that their structures are both very similar to the PaFabZ crystal structure. The β3/β4 strands that control the catalytic activity of the enzymes interact with both ends of the central helix α3, and the conformation of these strands along this interaction interface determines the orientation of helix α3, and hence the shape of the active site tunnel (Fig. 7). Single and double mutants within these strands failed to transform EfFabZ into an isomerase, only when the β3/β4 strands were inserted as a unit was isomerase activity reconstituted. The structural analysis of FabA and FabZ (11Kimber M.S. Martin F. Lu Y. Houston S. Vedadi M. Dharamsi A. Feibig K.M. Schmid M. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52593-52602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) led to the hypothesis that differences in the shapes of the active site tunnels caused by the structures of these β strands, rather than active site chemistry, explain why the two enzymes differ in their ability to carry out the isomerization reaction.

Martin F. Lu Y. Houston S. Vedadi M. Dharamsi A. Feibig K.M. Schmid M. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52593-52602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) possess long, narrow, hydrophobic tunnels that span both monomers. The substrate tunnels both begin at the surface with narrow openings that can be completely occluded by a tyrosine, snake under the N terminus of the long, central α3-helix of the first monomer, and extend along the side of the corresponding helix α3 from the second monomer on its way back to the surface (Fig. 7). The tunnels are roughly 20 Å long, and the catalytic residues are located about halfway down their length. Both proteins have an active site histidine that acts as a general base with the Nδ atom hydrogen-bonded to a backbone carbonyl oxygen. Both proteins also have catalytic water molecules that are held in place by hydrogen bonds to a backbone amide at the N-terminal end of the central helix and to an acidic residue, Asp-84 in EcFabA and Glu-68 in EcFabZ. Although the acidic residues are different, they hold the water molecules in essentially the same spatial position within the tunnels. Site-directed mutagenesis swapping the aspartate in FabA for the glutamate in FabZ, and vice versa, do not change the catalytic properties of the proteins, making it clear that the catalytic machinery is equivalent and capable of carrying out both the dehydratase and isomerase activities (11Kimber M.S. Martin F. Lu Y. Houston S. Vedadi M. Dharamsi A. Feibig K.M. Schmid M. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52593-52602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Rather, the ability of FabA, but not FabZ, to place the trans-2 substrate in an appropriate conformation to allow isomerization was proposed to arise from the differences in the protein backbones in the distal part of the substrate binding tunnels, encompassing helix α3 and strands β3/β4. Differences in the orientation of helix α3 are the primary structural differences leading to differently shaped active site tunnels (Fig. 7), which in turn position on the substrate in a conformation that in FabA/N, but not FabZ, is appropriate for the isomerization reaction. Strand β4 pushes the α3-helix upward, and strand β3 moves in the same direction to allow this movement and form one side of the active site tunnel (Fig. 7). Thus, the catalytic properties of the FabA/Z class of dehydratases is specified by the β3/β4 strands, not the catalytic residues, which alter the shapes of the active site tunnels."

We previously reported that Bcl-2 regulates chondrocyte matrix gene expression, independent of its anti-apoptotic function. Here, we further investigate this novel function of Bcl-2 and examine three intracellular signaling pathways likely to be associated with this function. The present study demonstrates that the activity of Sox9, a master transcription factor that regulates the gene expression of chondrocyte matrix proteins, is suppressed by Bcl-2 small interference RNA in the presence of caspase inhibitors. This effect was attenuated by prior exposure of chondrocytes to an adenoviral vector expressing sense Bcl-2. In addition, the down-regulation of Bcl-2, Sox9, and chondrocyte-specific gene expression by serum withdrawal in primary chondrocytes was reversed by expressing Bcl-2. Inhibition of the protein kinase Cα and NFκB pathways had no effect on the maintenance of Sox9-dependent gene expression by Bcl-2. In contrast, whereas the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway negatively regulated the differentiated phenotype in wild type chondrocytes, inhibition of this pathway reversed the loss of differentiation markers and fibroblastic phenotype in Bcl-2-deficient chondrocytes. In conclusion, the present study identifies a specific signaling pathway, namely, MEK-ERK1/2, that is downstream of Bcl-2 in the regulation of Sox9-dependent chondrocyte gene expression and phenotype.

Finally, the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway by interleukin-1-β is inhibited by Bcl-2 in an apoptosis-independent manner in fibroblasts (8Lee L. Irani K. Finkel T. Mol. Genet.

Although there is a growing consensus that the above functions of Bcl-2 are not entirely a consequence of the anti-apoptotic process, the specific signaling pathways underlying these processes have not been fully identified. Chondrocytes, the only resident cells in cartilage, synthesize matrix proteins, including aggrecan, collagen type II, and link protein that are important for tissue function (12Yamada Y. Horton W. Miyashita T. Savagner P. Hassell J. Doege K. J. Craniofac. Genet. Dev. Biol. 1991; 11: 350-356PubMed Google Scholar). The transcription factor Sox9 binds to regulatory regions of genes coding for these matrix proteins as well as collagen type XI and cartilage derived retinoic acid-sensitive protein (13Bridgewater L.C.

During development, chondrocytes differentiate from mesenchymal cells and are responsible for longitudinal growth of long bones (19Yoon B.S. Lyons K.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Chondrocytes in the prehypertrophic zone of the growth plate express Bcl-2 along with cartilage matrix proteins and Sox9 (19Yoon B.S. Lyons K.M. J. Cell.

However, in the hypertrophic zone where chondrocytes undergo terminal differentiation and start to express collagen type X and bone related matrix proteins, there is decreased expression of Bcl-2 and cartilage matrix proteins as well as loss of Sox9 expression (20Amling M.

In vivo, suppression of Bcl-2 expression leads to accelerated terminal differentiation of chondrocytes and shortened long bones and Bcl-2 is downstream of parathyroid hormone related peptide (20Amling M. Neff L. Tanaka S. Inoue D. Kuida K. Weir E. Philbrick W.M. Broadus A.E. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Previously we reported that Bcl-2 functions as a regulator of cartilage matrix protein expression in chondrocytes (29Feng L. Precht P. Balakir R. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Feng L. Balakir R. Precht P. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell.

The suppression of Bcl-2 in chondrocytes results in decreased aggrecan expression even when the apoptotic pathway is blocked by inhibition of caspase activity (30Feng L. Balakir R. Precht P. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 576-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Additionally, aggrecan, collagen type II, link protein, and Sox9 mRNA expression is significantly decreased in chondrocytes expressing a low level of Bcl-2 (30Feng L. Balakir R. Precht P. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 576-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Kinkel M.D. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, collagen type I mRNA expression is increased suggesting that Bcl-2 may be involved in regulating the phenotype of chondrocytes (31Kinkel M.D. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, chondrocytes constitutively expressing Bcl-2 are protected from down-regulation of aggrecan, collagen type II, and Sox9 following serum withdrawal (30Feng L. Balakir R. Precht P. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 576-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Kinkel M.D. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). From these studies we hypothesize that Bcl-2 may function to regulate cartilage matrix expression in addition to or independent of its role in regulating apoptosis. However, the precise mechanism by which this occurs is still unknown. Here we tested three possible pathways that might be involved in the regulation of matrix gene expression by Bcl-2: PKCα, NFκB, and ERK1/2. PKCα positively regulates expression of collagen type II during chondrocyte differentiation and is down-regulated during dedifferentiation (32Chang S.H. Oh C.D. Yang M.S. Kang S.S. Lee Y.S. Sonn J.K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12353-12359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). NFκB inhibits Sox9 activity, destabilizes Sox9 mRNA, and decreases collagen type II expression with tumor necrosis factor-α treatment (35Murakami S. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3687-3692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 36Sitcheran R. Cogswell P.C. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2368-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The ERK1/2 signaling pathway is known to negatively regulate collagen type II, aggrecan, and Sox9 mRNA in mesenchymal cells prior to chondrocyte differentiation (37Bobick B.E. Kulyk W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4588-4595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 38Seghatoleslami M.R. Roman-Blas J.A. Rainville A.M. Modaressi R. Danielson K.G. Tuan R.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 1129-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Conversely, the ERK pathway has been shown to positively regulate Sox9 mRNA and activity during chondrogenesis induced by fibroblast growth factor (39Murakami S. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In general, the pattern of expression of active PKCα is directly correlated with differentiation and collagen type II expression, whereas ERK1/2 expression is inversely correlated, even though PKCα and ERK appear to regulate chondrogenesis independently (40Yoon Y.M. Kim S.J. Oh C.D. Ju J.W. Song W.K. Yoo Y.J. Huh T.L. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8412-8420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The findings presented here support a role for Bcl-2 in regulating the differentiated phenotype of chondrocytes. In addition, the data support a model whereby Bcl-2 suppresses an inhibitory action of the MEK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway on Sox9-dependent regulation of chondrocyte gene expression downstream of Bcl-2. Cell Culture—Primary chondrocytes were isolated from femoral condyles of 6-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River). Cartilage was digested with 0.4% (w/v) collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Corp.) in a shaking incubator at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were recovered by centrifugation at 4 °C. The cell pellet was washed with phosphate-buffered saline two times, and cells were seeded on dishes in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS. Immortalized rat chondrocytes (IRC) were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium with 10% FBS. The IRC cells are known to have a differentiated phenotype similar to articular chondrocytes (41Horton Jr., W.E.

Cells were transfected with plasmids containing sense or antisense Bcl-2 coding sequences and selected in G418 as described previously (29Feng L. Precht P. Balakir R. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Feng L. Balakir R. Precht P. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 576-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 in T-25 flasks for protein isolation or 3.85 × 105 in 6-well pates for RNA extraction and were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Ham's F-12 medium. Adenoviral Vectors and Infection in Chondrocytes—The adenovirus vectors were generated with the Adeno-X expression system (BD Clontech). The recombinant adenovirus vector expressing rat Bcl-2 cDNA was constructed using the identical sequence coding for Bcl-2 as previously described (29Feng L. Precht P. Balakir R. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Adenoviral vectors containing the luciferase cDNA (Adeno-x-LacZ, BD Clontech) was used as control vector. The purified recombinant adenoviral DNA containing the coding region in the sense orientation for Bcl-2 or LacZ was transfected into HEK293 cells, and a recombinant adenovirus was produced. The viral stocks were concentrated, and the purified stock was titered using the Adeno-X Rapid Titer Kit (BD Clontech). The infection efficiency of adenovirus, as determined by β-galactosidase staining (Invitrogen), was 100% with 30 m.o.i. in IRC cells and 45 m.o.i. in primary chondrocytes. Primary chondrocytes or IRC cells were plated at a density of 6 × 105 in 6-well plates. 45 m.o.i. or 30 m.o.i. recombinant virus diluted with 500 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) was added to cells, and the mixture was incubated for 90 min. Next, 1 ml of complete medium was added to each well, and, following incubation for an additional 6 h, the virus-containing medium was replaced by complete culture medium. Antibodies and Other Reagents—Antibodies recognizing total ERK1/2 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 were purchased from Cell Signaling. Antibodies to phosphorylated PKCα and β-actin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Anti-Bcl-2 was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. For immunofluorescence staining, the primary Bcl-2 antibody and anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. The MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126 (Cell Signaling), was used at concentrations of 20 or 25 μm depending on experiments. The PKCα inhibitors, Go6983 (42Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H.

Western Blotting—Cells were lysed and scraped in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I (Sigma). The cell lysate was incubated on ice and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). 15-40 μg of total protein was mixed with Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer and sample reducing agent (Invitrogen) and loaded on a 7.5% or 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen). The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween and 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody. After washing with TBS-T, membranes were incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were developed with chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). The expression level of positive bands of proteins were quantified using Image Station 440CF (Kodak) and normalized to the level of expression of β-actin. Transient Transfection, β-Galactosidase, and Luciferase Assay—Cells were plated at 3 × 105 in 12-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. A construct containing four repeats of a Sox9 binding site with the collagen type II promoter driving the luciferase reporter gene (14Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R.

Lefebvre, Cleveland Clinic Foundation) or an NFκB reporter construct (Stratagene) was co-transfected with a β-galactosidase reporter vector as an internal control of transfection efficiency. The dominant negative IκB expression vector (Stratagene), or Bcl-2 or control siRNA vector (IMGENEX) were also co-transfected with the Sox9 construct and β-galactosidase reporter vector. All transfections were performed with Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) mixed with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Cells were exposed to DNA-Lipofectamine complex in 10% FBS Ham's F-12 without antibiotics for 4 h and then cultured overnight in normal growth media containing 10% FBS. After recovery, the cells were exposed to inhibitors or serum withdrawal as indicated. The cells were then lysed with Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). β-Galactosidase activities were determined by measuring absorbance at 420 nm, and Luciferase activities were determined by the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) using Lumat LB 9501/16 luminometer (Berthold). Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were seeded at 1.4 × 105/well in 4 well chamber slides and transfected with Bcl-2 or control siRNA expression vectors (IMGNEX). 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 5% formalin for 30 min, incubated with 0.2% Triton X, and then blocked with 2% goat serum. Next, cells were incubated overnight with the Bcl-2 primary antibody at 4 °C and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibody. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole mounting medium (Vector) was applied, the slides were covered with coverslips, and fluorescence was observed with an immunofluorescence microscope (BX60, Olympus). The Analysis of Sulfated Cartilage Matrix Proteoglycan—After treatments as indicated, cells were fixed and stained with 0.5% Alcian blue 8GX, pH 1.0, as described previously (46Hassell J.R. Horigan E.A. Teratog. Carcinog. Mutagen. 1982; 2: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The Alcian blue bound to matrix proteoglycan was extracted with 4 m guanidine hydrochloride and measured at 600 nm (32Chang S.H. Oh C.D. Yang M.S. Kang S.S. Lee Y.S. Sonn J.K. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19213-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase (Invitrogen) to remove genomic DNA. Next, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's protocol. The aggrecan, collagen type II, Sox9, and 18 S primers were designed and examined for primer efficiency as described previously (31Kinkel M.D. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, primers were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems), and primer efficiency was performed with a standard curve of 60, 6, and 0.6 ng of cDNA with each primer compared with 18 S. The specificity of amplified products was confirmed by dissociation curve analysis (Applied Biosystems). The quantitation of mRNA expression was performed using the Applied Biosystems ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The PCR reactions were performed using 50 ng of cDNA and SYBR Green PCR core reagents (Applied Biosystems) in 96-well plates following the manufacturer's protocol. The data were analyzed using Sequence Detector version 1.7 software (Applied Biosystems). Relative expression was calculated using the Comparative CT Method (User Bulletin no. 2, Applied Biosystems, and Ref. 31Kinkel M.D. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). According to accepted standards, relative differences of 2-fold or greater are considered as biologically significant (Applied Biosystems). The Level of Bcl-2 Protein Modulates Sox9-dependent Chondrocyte Matrix Gene Expression—We previously demonstrated that suppression of Bcl-2 protein level with integrated antisense constructs resulted in down-regulation of expression of mRNA coding for cartilage matrix proteins even in the presence of caspase inhibitors that blocked full apoptosis (29Feng L. Precht P. Balakir R. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Feng L. Balakir R. Precht P. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 576-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Kinkel M.D. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here we examine the effects of direct down-regulation of Bcl-2 using siRNA on Sox9-dependent collagen type II promoter activity. IRC cells were transfected with a plasmid vector expressing siRNA for Bcl-2 along with the Sox9 reporter construct. Immunocytochemistry was used to demonstrate no change in the Bcl-2 level in IRC chondrocytes transfected with control siRNA containing random DNA sequences (Fig. 1A), whereas there was an obvious decrease in the percentage of chondrocytes expressing Bcl-2 following transfection with the Bcl-2 siRNA (Fig. 1B). The Sox9-dependent reporter construct contains four copies of the Sox9 binding site upstream from a minimal collagen II promoter (14Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C.N. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Zhou X. Sinha S. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This reporter construct is dependent on transcriptional activation by Sox9 in IRC chondrocytes, because mutations in the Sox9 binding sites eliminate promoter activity (data not shown). The Sox9-dependent reporter activity was decreased by 70% in chondrocytes with suppressed Bcl-2 expression compared with cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 2A). This suppression of Sox9 activity was observed even in the presence of 50 μm Z-VAD, a general caspase inhibitor that blocks full apoptosis in IRC cells (30Feng L. Balakir R. Precht P. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 576-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) compared with control siRNA-transfected cells treated with 50 μm Z-VAD (Fig. 2B). These results confirm that Sox9-dependent promoter activity is dependent on Bcl-2 in chondrocytes. A specific role for Bcl-2 was further established by increasing basal expression of Bcl-2 using an adenoviral construct prior to exposure of the chondrocytes to Bcl-2 siRNA. Cells were first infected with either sense Bcl-2 or LacZ adenovirus, and then co-transfected with either Bcl-2 or control siRNA along with the Sox9 activity reporter construct in the presence of 10% FBS. Cells infected with LacZ virus and transfected with Bcl-2 siRNA showed a 50% down-regulation of Sox9-dependent promoter activity compared with control siRNA (Fig. 3). However, if the cells were first treated with Bcl-2 adenovirus to increase the basal level of Bcl-2, there was no decrease in Sox9-dependent promoter activity following transfection with Bcl-2 siRNA (Fig. 3). Previously we demonstrated that constitutive expression of Bcl-2 protected IRC chondrocytes against serum withdrawal-induced down-regulation of mRNA transcripts coding for several cartilage matrix proteins and Sox9 (31Kinkel M.D. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here we extend these studies to look directly at Sox9-dependent promo"

In U937/PR3, stably transfected with PRCRSV/PR3 to overexpress PR3, PMA-induced p21 expression was significantly decreased as compared with control U937, and this phenomenon was reversed in the presence of the serine proteinase inhibitor, pefabloc. Conversely, when PR3 was inactivated by small interfering RNA, p21 protein was increased, and PMA-induced monocytic differentiation was potentiated. Mass spectrometry analysis identified Ala45 as the primary cleavage site on p21, and the recombinant mutated p21A45R, generated by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in Escherichia coli, was resistant to in vitro PR3 cleavage. The U937 cells were then stably transfected with either PRCRSV/p21 or PRCRSV/p21A45R, to ectopically express wild type p21 or PR3-resistant p21, respectively. In U937/p21A45R treated with PS-341, a selective proteasome inhibitor, a significant decrease in the S phase and a blockade in the G0-G1 phase of cell cycle were observed when compared with U937/p21 or control U937. This suggested that both PR3 and the proteasome are efficiently involved in the proteolytic regulation of p21 expression in myeloid cells. Moreover, PMA-induced p21 expression was more pronounced in U937/p21A45R compared with U937/p21 and was concomitant with the morphological features of early differentiation. Our data demonstrated that p21 is one specific target of PR3 and that PR3-mediated p21 cleavage prevents monocytic differentiation.

A. 1992; 89: 8215-8219Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Despite the strong homology between PR3 and elastase, PR3 appears to display some functional and structural features of its own (4Witko-Sarsat V. Rieu P. Descamps-Latscha B. Lesavre P. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 617-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 5van der Geld Y.M. Limburg P.C. Kallenberg C.G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 177-190PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, PR3 was cloned in HL-60 myeloid cells and was called myeloblastin, because its mRNA was down-regulated during myeloid differentiation (6Bories D. Raynal M.C. Solomon D.H. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cayre Y.E. Cell. 1989; 59: 959-968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). PR3 has been involved in the control of proliferation in normal hematopoietic progenitors and in early steps in their transformation. PR3 is overexpressed in myeloid leukemia (7Dengler R.

Raptis A. Hensel N. Agarwala V. Barrett A.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 2529-2534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies have shown that PR3 is a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-responsive gene, which can confer serum independence to precursor cells (9Lutz P.G. Moog-Lutz C. Coumau-Gatbois E. Kobari L. Di Gioia Y. Cayre Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although several molecular targets have been postulated, such as the transcription factor Sp1 (10Rao J. Zhang F. Donnelly R.J. Spector N.L. Studzinski G.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or the 28-kDa heat shock protein (11Spector N.L. Hardy L. Ryan C. Miller Jr., W.H. Humes J.L. Nadler L.M. Luedke E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1003-1006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), no clear demonstration has identified a specific PR3 target involved in the regulation of proliferation. In a model of mast cell lines (RBL and HMC1) stably transfected with either PR3 or elastase or an inactive PR3 mutant PR3S203A, we have provided evidence that PR3, but not elastase or its inactive mutant PR3S203A, had a proliferative activity and that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/WAF1/CIP1 was a molecular target of PR3 (12Witko-Sarsat V. Canteloup S. Durant S. Desdouets C. Chabernaud R. Lemarchand P. Descamps-Latscha B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47338-47347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). p21 belongs to the family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (13Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). It inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase-1, -2, -4, and -6 (14Gu Y. Turck C.W. Morgan D.O. Nature. 1993; 366: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), and its induction by a number of stimuli including p53 (15el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7936) Google Scholar) induces cell cycle arrest at the G1/S boundary, allowing the cell to exit the cell cycle and differentiate (16Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5239) Google Scholar). In several hematopoietic cell lines, including U937, the p21 gene is a primary response gene tightly related to early markers of the differentiation program (17Steinman R.A. Hoffman B. Iro A. Guillouf C. Liebermann D.A. el-Houseini M.E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3389-3396PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, myeloid maturation of CD34+ precursor cells is associated with a marked increase in p21 expression (18Steinman R.A. Huang J. Yaroslavskiy B. Goff J.P. Ball E.D. Nguyen A. Blood. 1998; 91: 4531-4542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concomitant expression of both PR3 and p21 during the early phase of myeloid cell differentiation raised the possibility that these key proteins may regulate each other, leading to a coordinated process of differentiation. In the present study, we first performed a molecular analysis of the cleavage site on p21 by PR3 in order to generate p21A45R, a PR3-resistant p21. We next addressed the question of the physiological relevance of the p21 cleavage by PR3 in myeloid cells expressing endogenous PR3. The construction of genetically modified U937 cells, which expressed endogenous PR3 (19Rao N.V. Rao G.V. Marshall B.C. Hoidal J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2972-2978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), made it possible to study (i) the effect of an overexpression of PR3 in U937/PR3 and (ii) the effect of the inactivation of PR3 using siRNA or (iii) the effect of the expression of PR3-resistant p21, thereby enabling us to address the role of PR3 in monocytic differentiation. We herein provide evidence that overexpression of PR3 in the promonocytic cell line U937 enhanced p21 cleavage and that inhibition of PR3 activity either by small interfering RNA or by ectopic expression of the p21A45R potentiated the early steps of monocytic differentiation. PR3 cDNA from pCDNA3/PR3 was subcloned into the expression vector PRC/RSV/PR3 (Invitrogen) between HindIII and NotI restriction sites (12Witko-Sarsat V. Canteloup S. Durant S. Desdouets C. Chabernaud R. Lemarchand P. Descamps-Latscha B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47338-47347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The plasmid pETp21/His containing the human p21 cDNA with an N-terminal His tag was a gift from Dr. Bruce Stillman (Cold Spring Harbor, NY) (20Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). The plasmid PRC/RSV/p21 was obtained by subcloning p21 cDNA from pETp21/His into the XbaI restriction site. The plasmid PRC/RSV/p21A52R was prepared to express the PR3-resistant p21 by mutating the alanine residue (Ala45) into arginine (Arg45) using the following primers: forward, GCT GCA TCC AGG AGC GCC GTG AGC GAT GG; reverse, CCA TCG CTC ACG GCG CTC CTG GAT GCA GC. Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). All cDNA sequences were confirmed by direct sequencing (data not shown). Recombinant human p21 was purified from Escherichia coli transformed with the expression plasmid pETp21/His expressing a His tag at the N terminus (20Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). Recombinant p21 protein was purified under denaturing conditions. Briefly, growing bacteria were induced by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 15 h at 30 °C, centrifuged, and lysed in a denaturing buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, 8 m urea, pH 8.0). The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column, and the p21 was eluted by a pH gradient (100 mm NaH2PO4,10 mm Tris, 8 m urea, pH 5.9 to 4.5). The presence of p21 was tested by Western blot, and the p21-positive fractions were pooled and dialyzed in 10 mm Tris, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4. Likewise, p21A45R, the PR3-resistant p21, was produced as a recombinant His-p21A45R in E. coli using the same purification protocol. Because of the presence of the His tag on recombinant p21, the Ala45 residue is in position 52. However, we decided to maintain the numbering of wild type p21; therefore, the recombinant PR3-resistant p21 will be called p21A45R in reference to the wild type p21. PR3 was purified from granules of human neutrophils as previously described (21Witko-Sarsat V. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Schuster A. Nusbaum P. Ueki I. Canteloup S. Lenoir G. Descamps-Latscha B. Nadel J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Silver staining of SDS-PAGE was used to ascertain the purity of p21 and PR3 and to quantify them (data not shown). To perform in vitro cleavage, purified recombinant p21 (100 μl) and PR3 (10 μl) (at the indicated concentrations) were incubated in PBS (pH 7.4) at 30 °C for 15 min. After incubation, 5 μl of 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to stop the reaction, and an aliquot of the reaction mixture was run on 15% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot or by mass spectrometry to visualize the p21 cleavage products. Laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometric analysis was performed with a Perseptive Biosystems (Framingham, MA) Voyager Elite XL time-of-flight mass spectrometer with delayed extraction, operating with a pulsed nitrogen laser at 337 nm (22Dublet B. Vernet T. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18909-18915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Positive ion mass spectra were acquired using a linear, delayed extraction mode with an accelerating potential of 25 kV, a 90% grid potential, a 0.2% guide wire voltage, and a delay time of 200 ns for the recombinant p21 and with an accelerating potential of 20 kV, a 94% grid potential, a 0.15% guide wire voltage, and a delay time of 100 ns for the synthetic p21 peptides (Eurogentec). Each spectrum represents the results from 100 averaged laser pulses. Aliquots (50 μl) of the recombinant p21, treated with PR3 or PBS, were mixed with an equal volume of 1% trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma) and concentrated on a ZipTip™C18 (Millipore Corp.) as specified by the manufacturer. The material eluted was partially evaporated and mixed with an equal volume of a saturated solution of sinapinic acid (Fluka) prepared in a 50% (v/v) solution of acetonitrile/aqueous 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid. Aliquots of 2 μl of this mixture were spotted on the stainless steel sample plate and air-dried prior to analysis. External calibration was performed with myoglobin from horse heart (Sigma) using the m/z value of 16,952. Synthetic peptides at a concentration of 12 μm were treated with 10 nm PR3 or PBS as explained in the legends to Figs. 2 and 3. Aliquots of 0.5 μl were mixed with 0.5 μl of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) prepared in a 50% (v/v) solution of acetonitrile/aqueous 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid directly on the stainless steel sample plate and air-dried prior to analysis. External calibration was performed with the calibration mixture 2 of the Sequazyme™ peptide mass standards kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) containing angiotensin I (m/z 1297.51), fragments of the adrenocorticotropic hormone 1–17 (m/z 2,094.46), 18–39 (m/z 2,466.72), 7–38 (m/z 3,660.19), and bovine insulin (m/z 5734.59). The values expressed are average mass and correspond to the [M + H]+ ion.Fig. 3Effects of the substitution on the P′1 or P2 sites on the cleavage of p21 peptides by PR3, analyzed by MALDI-TOF.

Only the 221 residues from chain A of the tetramer were used. Since no structure of the proteinase 3 complexed with a peptide exists, we based our docking strategy on the human neutrophil elastase, its close homologue. We used the x-ray structure (Protein Data Bank code 1PPF) of the complex between human neutrophil elastase and OMTKY3 and the structural similarities between human neutrophil elastase and PR3 to position the peptides in PR3. The geometry of each system was optimized using Charmm (version 30b1) (24Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput.

Long range electrostatic forces were taken into account using a fast implementation of the particle-mesh Ewald algorithm (29Darden T.A. Pedersen L.G. Environ.

The systems were initially heated up to 300 K and then stabilized for 100 ps using periodical velocity reassignment and finally simulated for 2000 ps. Trajectory Analysis—Root mean square deviations of the structures along the simulations were calculated versus the initial conformations, in order to check the root mean square stability. We performed an analysis of the last 1.3 ns of the trajectories (sampling time). Average structures of the complexes were calculated over the sampling times, using the Charmm program and subsequently minimized with 2000 steps of steepest descent algorithm and 200 steps of conjugate gradient, solvent molecules being fixed. U937 cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS and then transfected using the AMAXA system® as indicated by the manufacturer. Briefly, cells (2 × 106) were resuspended in 100 μl of cell line solution in the presence of 1 μg of plasmid (control PRCRSV, PRCRSV/PR3, PRCRSV/p21, or PRCRSV/p21A45R). Cells were electroporated and transferred into culture plates. Transfected cells were selected on the basis on their resistance to neomycin (1 mg/ml) and cloned by limiting dilution. Monocytic differentiation of U937 was performed by adding PMA (Calbiochem) at 62.5 ng/ml. Morphologic analysis was performed using an inverted microscope coupled with a camera. For some experiments, U937 cells were treated with the serine proteinase inhibitor, pefabloc, at 100 μm (Calbiochem) or with the proteasome inhibitor PS-341 (Velcade®, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA) at 0.1 μm. PR3 intracellular expression was assessed by flow cytometry analysis using the mouse monoclonal anti-PR3 (clone CLB-12-8) as the primary antibody followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Immunocytometry Systems) as previously described (33Durant S. Pederzoli M. Lepelletier Y. Canteloup S. Nusbaum P. Lesavre P. Witko-Sarsat V. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2004; 75: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The membrane expression of CD11b was measured by flow cytometry after labeling with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-CD11b and compared with isotype-specific control IgG (Immunotech, Marseille, France). For PR3 siRNA experiments, 50 μl of a mix of two PR3-siRNA sequences (Qiagen) (50 nm each) in the presence of Lipofectamine™ at 6.7 μg/ml (Invitrogen) in serum-free Opti-MEM were incubated at room temperature for 30 min to allow the formation of siRNA-liposome complexes. This mix was added to U937 cells previously plated at 3 × 105 in 400 μl of Opti-MEM plus 2% FCS. After 5 h of incubation at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2, FCS-containing RPMI was added in order to obtain a 10% FCS final concentration in 1 ml. Cells were cultured at 37 °C during the indicated period in the presence of siRNA. PR3 target sequences were as follows: TCA GGT GTT TCT GAA CAA CTA and ATC TGT GAT GGC ATC ATC CAA. The silencer negative control 1 siRNA (Ambion) was used to ascertain the specificity of the effect of PR3 siRNA. The Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated negative control siRNA (Qiagen) was used to detect intracellular siRNA by flow cytometry (FL1), thus monitoring the efficiency of transfection after a 2-, 5-, and 18-h incubation period (data not shown). To carry out a flow cytometry analysis of the DNA content, U937 cells were plated into a 6-well plate (1.5 × 106 cells/ml) in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS with or without PS-341 at 0.1 μm and allowed to seed overnight in culture. The halogenated thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine (Pharmingen) at 1 mm was incorporated over 1 h at 37 °C. After resuspension in PBS plus 1% bovine serum albumin, the cells were fixed with frozen 70% ethanol for 18 h at 4 °C. The fixed cells were denatured with 2 n HCl plus 0.5% Triton X-100 during 24 h at 4 °C and then neutralized with 0.1 m Na2B4O7 for 30 min. Cells were treated with free RNase-DNase at 300 μg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C, labeled with a monoclonal fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-bromodeoxyuridine (Pharmingen) and propidium iodide (Sigma) (2.5 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation (FL1) and propidium iodide (FL2) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Data from 15,000 cells were collected, and the percentages of cells within the G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle were determined by Cell Quest (BD Immunocytometry Systems) (34Pederzoli M. Kantari C. Gausson V. Moriceau S. Witko-Sarsat V. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 6381-6390Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). U937 (100 × 106 cells/ml) were lysed into a lysis buffer (0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8) containing proteinase inhibitors (400 μm aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 400 μm leupeptin, 400 μm pepstatin, 2 mm EDTA). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA method (Pierce). Proteins were analyzed by the standard immunoblot procedure as previously described. Rabbit polyclonal anti-p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or rabbit polyclonal anti-β-actin (Sigma) were the primary antibodies used. The secondary antibody was conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, and the blot was developed using a chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of PR3 and p21 mRNA were analyzed by RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from U937 cells using SV total RNA isolation System (Promega). After denaturation at 70 °C for 3 min, reverse transcription was performed on 50 ng of total RNA extract at 37 °C for 60 min using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Sensiscript; Qiagen). The mRNA of either PR3 or p21 or β2-microglobulin, which was used as internal control for gene amplification, was amplified by PCR using a GeneAmp PCR System 9600 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with the following primers (for PR3, sense (5′-CAC TGC CTG CGG GAC ATA-3′) and antisense (5′-GTC AGG GAA AAG GCG GGT-3′) (35Just J.

Dumont J. Mathiot C. Kolb J.P. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). After denaturation, PCR cycles were conducted as follows: (i) for PR3 and p21, denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, reannealing for 25 s at 60 °C, and extension for 30 s at 72 °C; for β2-microglobulin, denaturation for 60 s at 94 °C, reannealing for 60 s at 57 °C, and extension for 120 s at 72 °C; (ii) the number of PCR cycles was determined for PR3 (30 cycles), for p21 (40 cycles), and for β2-microglobulin (35 cycles) to ensure that quantification of the PCR products was conducted in a linear range of amplification. The PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel containing 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The β2-microglobulin gene was used to normalize the PCR products as previously described (36Bauvois B. Dumont J. Mathiot C. Kolb J.P. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using the Statview™ software package. Comparisons were made by analysis of variance. Differences were considered significant when the p value was less than 0.05 (p < 0.05). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Identification of the Specific Cleavage Site by PR3 on p21 by Mass Spectrometry—We previously demonstrated that neutrophil-derived PR3 cleaved recombinant p21 expressed in E. coli (12Witko-Sarsat V.

As shown in Fig. 1A, p21 cleavage was dependent on PR3 concentration. Using a rabbit polyclonal anti-p21 antibody directed against a C-terminal epitope, only the carboxyl-terminal fragment could be observed. At low concentration (2.4 nm), the initial p21 fragment had a molecular mass of around 13 kDa. This fragment was further cleaved to a 10-kDa fragment, which we observed at a PR3 concentration of 4.8 nm. The initial cleavage site was identified by mass spectrometry. Mass spectra analysis was performed on purified recombinant p21 with or without PR3. In the absence of PR3, recombinant p21 appeared with a molecular mass of 18,990 Da. In the presence of 2.4 nm PR3, two cleavage fragments at 5714 and at 13,332 Da were observed. These fragments were more apparent at a PR3 concentration of 4.8 nm (Fig. 1B). Peptide fragment analysis suggested that the cleavage occurred around Ala45 in p21. In order to confirm the cleavage site, a 20-aa p21 peptide (residues Asp35–Val54), DALMAGCIQEA45RERWNFDFV, centered on the P1 residue, Ala45, was analyzed by mass spectrometry with or without the presence of 10 nm PR3. The 20-aa p21 peptide (Asp35–Val54), detected at a molecular mass of 2370 Da, was cleaved and generated a fragment of 1268.63 corresponding to the C-terminal fragment of the peptide after the Ala45 position (Fig. 2A). Because the N-terminal fragment could not be detected, we hypothesized that the peptide was further cleaved at Ala36 or Ala39 by PR3. In order to see if Ala36 and Ala39 could constitute secondary cleavage sites, we performed a trypsin digestion. We were able to observe the presence of the expected N- and C-terminal fragments. We next tested a longer peptide of 30 aa extended at the N terminus. This 30-aa p21 peptide (residues Val25–Val54) was cleaved at Ala45 in the presence of PR3. Both the N-terminal and the C-terminal fragments were detected at 2254.54 and 1268.25 Da, respectively, even after 1 h of digestion at 37 °C with 10 nm PR3 (Fig. 2B). No cleavage fragment resulting from a cleavage at Ala36 or Ala39 was observed. Since this synthetic peptide contains two cysteines, which can create a disulfite bond and stabilize it, we also tested a synthetic peptide with a serine in place of the first cysteine. The result was exactly the same (data not shown). Consequently, these results demonstrated that the unique cleavage site, either within the 20-aa or the 30-aa p21 peptide, was on Ala45. In order to determine the mutation on p21, which will render p21 resistant to PR3 cle"
https://openalex.org/W2075323026,"Annexins are soluble proteins that are best known for their ability to undergo reversible Ca2+-dependent binding to the surface of phospholipid bilayers. Recent studies, however, have shown that annexins also reversibly bind to membranes in a Ca2+-independent manner at mildly acidic pH. We investigated the structural changes that occur upon pH-dependent membrane binding by performing a nitroxide scan on the helical hairpin encompassing helices A and B in the fourth repeat of annexin B12. Residues 251-273 of annexin B12 were replaced, one at a time, with cysteine and then labeled with a nitroxide spin label. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) mobility and accessibility analyses of soluble annexin B12 derivatives were in excellent agreement with the known crystal structure of annexin B12. However, EPR studies of annexin B12 derivatives bound to membranes at pH 4.0 indicated major structural changes in the scanned region. The helix-loop-helix structure present in the soluble protein was converted into a continuous transmembrane α-helix that was exposed to the hydrophobic core of the bilayer on one side and exposed to an aqueous pore on the other side. Asp-264 was on the hydrophobic membrane-exposed face of the amphipathic transmembrane helix, thereby suggesting that protonation of its carboxylate group stabilized the transmembrane form. Inspection of the amino acid sequence of annexin B12 revealed several other helical hairpin regions that might refold and form continuous amphipathic transmembrane helices in response to protonation of Asp or Glu switch residues on or near the hydrophobic face of the helix.

Annexins are a family of structurally conserved proteins that are abundantly expressed in eukaryotes (1Moss S. Morgan R. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Annexins have been extensively studied as intracellular proteins that localize to the cytosol and undergo reversible binding to intracellular membranes in response to rising Ca2+ concentrations (for reviews see Refs. 2Gerke V.

Changes in the expression and localization pattern of different annexins have been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and cardiovascular disease (12Rand J.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1035-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Hayes M.J. Moss S.E. Biochem. Bioph. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although the precise physiological functions of annexins are not yet fully understood, it is thought that annexins are likely to be involved in membrane-related events such as vesicle trafficking, membrane domain organization, membrane fusion, and cell signaling (2Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar, 14Rescher U. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2631-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Because annexins are likely to exert their biological functions while associated with membranes, a molecular understanding of these membrane interactions is important. Structural information on membrane-bound annexins is limited, but high-resolution x-ray crystal structures are available for the soluble forms of numerous annexins. Annexins have a non-conserved N-terminal domain and a structurally conserved core domain that contains the Ca2+-binding sites (1Moss S. Morgan R. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The core domain usually consists of four repeats that share moderate sequence identity and are ∼70 amino acids in length. The crystal structures of the core domains of different annexin gene products are nearly superimposable and show that each of the four repeats contains five α-helices, labeled A-E, in the annexin B12 structure depicted in Fig. 1 (15Luecke H. Chang B.T. Mailliard W.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Haigler H.T. Nature. 1995; 378: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Four of these helices form a bundle with the C-helix sitting on top. The core of each bundle contains mainly hydrophobic residues, whereas the surface of the protein and the interfaces between the repeats are mainly hydrophilic. The loop regions between the A-B and D-E helices contain Ca2+-binding sites that mediate protein binding to phospholipid bilayers (1Moss S. Morgan R. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Site-directed spin labeling studies of soluble and Ca2+-dependent membrane-bound annexin B12 showed that both forms had structures that were very similar to the x-ray crystal structure (16Isas J.M.

The exact pH required for membrane interaction varies among the different annexins and is strongly modulated by phospholipid composition (6Isas J.M. Patel D.R. Jao C. Jayasinghe S. Cartailler J.P.

Biochemical studies on annexins A5 and B12 demonstrated that acidic pH increases the overall hydrophobicity of these proteins and promotes membrane insertion (7Kohler G. Hering U. Zschoring O.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3015-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These conclusions are further supported by the observation that acidic conditions can increase the hydrophobicity of matrix vesicle annexins, which were found to selectively partition into lipophilic organic solvents at acidic, but not at neutral, pH (22Genge B.R. Wu L.N. Adkisson IV, H.D. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10678-10685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Single-channel conductance showed that annexins A5 and B12 mediated ion flux across phospholipid bilayers at mildly acidic pH (8Isas J.M. Cartailler J.P. Sokolov Y. Patel D.R. Langen R. Luecke H.

Although the physiological significance of the channel-like activity is not yet known, structural models of Ca2+-independent binding of annexins to membranes at mildly acidic pH should accommodate this in vitro observation. Site-directed spin labeling studies of annexin B12 showed that it underwent global refolding upon Ca2+-independent association with membranes at mildly acidic pH (6Isas J.M. Patel D.R. Jao C. Jayasinghe S. Cartailler J.P. Haigler H.T. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30227-30234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A nitroxide scan of the region encompassing the D helix-loop-E helix region of repeat II of annexin B12 (see Fig. 1) provided insights into the mechanism of refolding (11Langen R. Isas J.M. Hubbell W.L. Haigler H.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14060-14065Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Acid-induced membrane binding caused this helical hairpin to refold and form a single continuous transmembrane helix. This transmembrane helix was found to be asymmetrically solvated, with one side exposed to the lipid bilayer and the other side exposed to an aqueous cavity, a structure that would be expected to have channel-like activity (11Langen R. Isas J.M. Hubbell W.L. Haigler H.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14060-14065Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This structural reorganization was mediated by an inside-out refolding that brings hydrophobic residues buried in the core of the crystal structure into contact with the hydrophobic lipid bilayer. Protonation of two Glu residues near the hydrophobic face of the transmembrane helix was speculated to be the pH-sensitive event that induced refolding and membrane insertion (11Langen R. Isas J.M. Hubbell W.L. Haigler H.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14060-14065Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The transmembrane nature of the amphipathic helix identified by the nitroxide scan of the D-E helix region in the second repeat of annexin B12 was confirmed by a separate experimental approach that used fluorescence spectroscopy (23Ladokhin A.S. Isas J.M. Haigler H.T. White S.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13617-13626Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The structural model proposed to explain the asymmetric solvation of the transmembrane helix described above requires additional amphipathic transmembrane helices to form the aqueous pore. Because the membrane-inserted form of annexin B12 at mildly acidic pH is monomeric (24Ladokhin A.S. Haigler H.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3402-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), multiple transmembrane regions are likely to be present in the same protein molecule. An inspection of the amino acid sequence of annexin B12 reveals that seven of the eight helical hairpin regions on the convex face of the protein are well suited to form transmembrane amphipathic helices with Glu or Asp residues on or near the hydrophobic face (see “Discussion” for additional comments). These helical hairpins all encompass either the A-B helices or the D-E helices. To determine whether an A-B helical hairpin could form a transmembrane structure, we selected the A-B helix region in the fourth repeat (residues 251-273, see Fig. 1) for analysis by a nitroxide scan. Site-directed spin labeling in combination with EPR spectroscopy has become a powerful approach for determining structural and dynamic features of membrane proteins, soluble proteins, and amyloid fibrils (25Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 26Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Chem. 2002; 277: 40810-40815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Site-directed spin labeling involves the labeling of specifically introduced cysteine residues to produce a paramagnetic side chain, R1 (see Fig. 2). The EPR spectrum provides information on the mobility and immediate environment of R1 in the protein. The mobility of R1 is a reliable indicator of the local structure of the protein (16Isas J.M. Langen R. Haigler H.T. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1464-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 26Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 28Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) and can be used to monitor conformational changes. A nitroxide scan through a continuous sequence is particularly informative because periodic changes in EPR parameters reveal a secondary structure. Additional structural information can be obtained from analysis of the R1 accessibility to collision with paramagnetic molecules, such as O2 or Ni(II) ethylenediaminediacetic acid (NiEDDA). 4The abbreviation used is: NiEDDA, Ni(II) ethylenediaminediacetic acid. NiEDDA and O2 accessibility parameters are in-phase for soluble proteins, but NiEDDA is preferentially excluded from the hydrophobic core of bilayers whereas O2 is preferentially included. Thus, the ratio of O2 and NiEDDA accessibilities can be used to determine the interaction between proteins and membranes and, with proper calibration, the depth of insertion of the R1-labeled side chain (29Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Using site-directed spin labeling, we found that residues 251-273 in soluble annexin B12 form a helix-loop-helix structure in aqueous solution, in agreement with their location in the crystal structure. Upon pH-dependent membrane interaction, this helical hairpin region refolded to form a continuous transmembrane helix that lined an aqueous pore. These data provide further evidence for the mechanism of transmembrane insertion of annexin B12 at acidic pH. Protein Expression and Purification—A series of 23 single cysteine mutations was introduced into the appropriate sites in the annexin 12 pSE420-mrp33H plasmid (30Mailliard W.S. Leucke H. Haigler H.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9045-9050Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene). All mutants were verified by sequencing. The annexin B12 mutants were expressed in DH5α Escherichia coli and purified by reversible Ca2+-dependent binding to phospholipid vesicles followed by size-exclusion chromatography, as previously described (30Mailliard W.S. Leucke H. Haigler H.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9045-9050Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Langen R. Isas J.M. Luecke H. Haigler H.T. Hubbell W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22453-22457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The proteins were stored in 20 mm Hepes containing 100 mm NaCl at pH 7.4 (Hepes-NaCl), supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol. Final protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm and use of the extinction coefficient ϵ = 12,288 m-1 cm-1. Spin Labeling and EPR Spectroscopy—Immediately prior to spin labeling, dithiothreitol was removed from the buffer by size exclusion chromatography with PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). The proteins were eluted with Hepes-NaCl buffer and were concentrated with centrifugal filter devices (Amicon Ultra-4 10,000 MWCO). The introduced cysteines were reacted (∼1 h, 22 °C) with a 3-fold molar excess of 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl methanethiosulfonate. Unreacted spin label was removed with a PD-10 column. R1 labeling did not appear to structurally or functionally alter 22 of the 23 annexin B12 mutants, as evidenced by the fact that they underwent reversible Ca2+-dependent binding to phospholipid vesicles similar to native annexin B12 (data not shown). However, R1-labeled position 257 was unstable and was excluded from EPR analysis. Large phospholipid vesicles composed of a 2:1 molar ratio of palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylserine to palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids) were prepared according to the Reeves Dowben protocol (32Reeves J.P. Dowben R.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1969; 73: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). A total of 30 μg of protein was mixed with 600 μg of phospholipid vesicles in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer at pH 4.0 and incubated (30 min, ∼22 °C) to induce binding. The mixture was centrifuged for 10 min in a tabletop centrifuge (15,000 × g, 4 °C). The lipid pellets containing bound annexin B12 were loaded into either glass (VitroCom Inc.) or TPX capillaries for EPR analysis. EPR spectra of lipid-free annexin B12 were recorded in Hepes-NaCl buffer (pH 7.4) or in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4). EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker EMX spectrophotometer fitted with an ER 4119HS resonator at 12 milliwatt incident microwave power. The scan width for EPR spectra was 100 gauss. The accessibility parameters Π(O2) and Π(NiEDDA) were measured by the power saturation method using a dielectric resonator (∼22 °C). The oxygen concentration used to equilibrate the protein solutions was equal to that of oxygen in air. The concentration of NiEDDA was 3 mm for annexin B12 in aqueous solution and 50 mm for membrane-bound protein. The membrane immersion depth for lipid-exposed residues was calculated from the parameter Φ (26Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 29Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The calibration of Φ in terms of depth was obtained with the use of 1-palmitoyl-2-doxyl-stearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids) spin-labeled at positions 5, 7, 10, and 12 on the acyl chains (29Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used in the experiments reported herein, depth [Å] = 3.8 (Φ) + 10.2. Structural Analysis of Annexin B12 in Solution—To study the conformational changes that occur in annexin B12 upon Ca2+-independent membrane binding at mildly acidic pH, we performed a nitroxide scanning experiment. Single Cys residues were engineered into sites 251-273 and used to attach the side chain R1 (Fig. 2). All sites except 257 tolerated R1 labeling (see “Experimental Procedures”). The mobility and accessibility of R1 in each of these derivatives were then determined by EPR spectroscopy to obtain structural information for soluble and membrane-bound forms of the protein. The EPR spectra of all sites analyzed in aqueous solution at pH 7.4 (Fig. 3A, red traces) were consistent with the crystal structure of annexin B12. For example, the EPR line shapes for residues 258R1-263R1 were very sharp and narrowly spaced, indicative of a high degree of mobility. Such elevated mobility is a characteristic feature of loop or unfolded regions (16Isas J.M. Langen R. Haigler H.T. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1464-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 28Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) and agrees well with the location of these residues in the loop between the A and B helices in the crystal structure (Fig. 1). The inverse central line width, ΔHo-1, is a measure of R1 mobility with higher values indicating higher mobility (28Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). A plot of ΔHo-1 as a function of amino acid sequence number clearly illustrates the high mobility associated with the 258-263 loop region (Fig. 3B, red circles). In contrast, spectra for residues 264R1-273R1, which correspond to the B-helix that is largely buried in the core of the protein, exhibited broad lines and increased spectral breadth characteristic of buried and immobilized sites (16Isas J.M. Langen R. Haigler H.T. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1464-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 28Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, A, red traces and B, red circles). Note that strongly immobilized spectral components are highlighted by red arrows. Residues 264R1 and 265R1, which correspond to the beginning of the B-helix and face the outer surface of the protein, were more mobile than residues at the center of helix B, which were buried in the center of the protein (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition to its mobile component, residue 264 exhibited a more immobilized component that could be caused by tertiary contacts with the side chains of residues 302 and 74 (15Luecke H. Chang B.T. Mailliard W.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Haigler H.T. Nature. 1995; 378: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure, helix A is mostly buried but is partially exposed to the solvent (Fig. 1). The EPR spectra of residues 251R1-256R1 are consistent with this structure. Strong immobilization was observed at residues that are buried in the crystal structure (Fig. 3, A, red traces, arrows, and B), whereas less immobilization was observed at the surface-exposed residues, especially residue 255R1. All of the experiments performed on annexin B12 in solution at pH 7.4, as reported above, were also performed at pH 4.0 in the absence of membranes. In solution, the EPR mobility parameters at pH 4.0 (data not shown) were nearly identical to the results obtained at pH 7.4. The overall structure of the scanned region was essentially the same in solution at neutral and mildly acidic pH. Previous studies of other regions of annexin B12 also indicated that the backbone fold of the protein did not change as a function of pH in the 4.0-7.4 range when the protein was in solution in the absence of phospholipid (6Isas J.M. Patel D.R. Jao C. Jayasinghe S. Cartailler J.P. Haigler H.T. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30227-30234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11Langen R. Isas J.M. Hubbell W.L. Haigler H.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14060-14065Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To further characterize the structure of annexin B12 in solution, we determined the local accessibilities of the R1-labeled proteins to collision with the paramagnetic reagents O2 and NiEDDA. The accessibility parameters Π(O2) and Π(NiEDDA) were in-phase throughout the scanned 251-273 region (Fig. 4), as is expected for a soluble protein based on previous studies showing that both reagents collide with residues on the surface of the protein and are excluded from the interior (26Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Residues in the loop region of annexin B12 (258R1-263R1) had high accessibility values, whereas buried residues in both helices (251R1-253R1, 266R1-273R1) were inaccessible to both colliders. Sites in the A (254R1, 255R1) and B helices (264R1, 265R1), which are exposed to the surface of the protein in the crystal structure, had intermediate Π(O2) and Π(NiEDDA) values (Fig. 4). Overall, there was a high correlation between mobility and accessibility to both O2 and NiEDDA (Figs. 3, A and B, and 4) in the scanned region of annexin B12 in solution. Both mobility and accessibility data were entirely consistent with the x-ray crystal structure of the soluble form of annexin B12. Structural Analysis of Annexin B12 Bound to Membranes at Mildly Acidic pH—To investigate structural and dynamic changes that occur upon Ca2+-independent binding to bilayers at mildly acidic pH, we recorded the EPR spectra for R1-labeled annexin B12 derivatives in the presence of large vesicles composed of phosphatidylserine-phosphatidylcholine (2:1 w/w) at pH 4.0. As shown in Fig. 3A, most of the spectra for the membrane-bound form (black traces) were notably different from those of the soluble form (red traces). These changes also were apparent when the mobility parameter, ΔHo-1, was plotted as a function of amino acid sequence position (Fig. 3B, black circles). The most pronounced changes were observed for sites in the highly dynamic loop region (residues 258R1-263R1). In the membrane-bound form, the EPR spectra of all loop sites became much broader and lower in amplitude, indicating a significant reduction in motion. In the membrane-bound form, the spectra of 258R1-263R1 are not consistent with a loop structure and indicate the formation of a folded structure in this region (Fig. 3). The EPR spectra (Fig. 3A) for sites in the regions corresponding to helix A and helix B were consistent with an ordered structure in the membrane-bound form. Nonetheless, a comparison of the spectra for the soluble and the membrane-bound forms revealed conformational changes at most R1-labeled sites. Sites with low mobility in solution that were buried in the crystal structure showed significant increases in mobility in the membrane-bound form (Fig. 3, A and B). These changes indicated that binding to membranes induced structural changes that disrupted the specific tight packing interactions in the core of the helical bundle in the fourth repeat of the protein. Also note that 255R1, which had intermediate mobility and was exposed to the surface of the protein in solution, became less mobile upon membrane binding (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, an analysis of all the R1-labeled sites in this nitroxide scan indicated that both the helical and loop regions underwent significant conformational changes in response to binding to membranes at mildly acidic pH. The plot of ΔHo-1 as a function of sequence revealed intermediate mobility parameters that did not show any obvious periodic changes through this region (Fig. 3B, black circles). The individual spectra of the membrane-bound derivatives do not contain well resolved outer hyperfine extrema (Fig. 3A, black traces), indicating the lack of strong packing interactions. To obtain additional structural information and to determine whether sites in the scanned region were exposed to the hydrophobic core of membranes following binding at mildly acidic pH, we determined the accessibility of R1-labeled derivatives to O2 and NiEDDA Π(O2) and Π(NiEDDA), respectively. As shown in Fig. 5A, the O2 and NiEDDA accessibility data for the membrane-bound annexin B12 derivatives were quite different from those obtained for the soluble form. Although the accessibility data of the soluble protein clearly revealed three separate regions (helix A, the loop, and helix B), the O2 and NiEDDA accessibilities of membrane-bound annexin exhibited a continuous periodic oscillation throughout the entire scanned region. The underlying periodicity of the latter was remarkably regular, with local maxima and local minima spaced ∼3-4 amino acids apart. Such periodicities are highly characteristic of α-helical structures, which contain an average of 3.6 amino acids/turn. Another striking difference between the soluble and membrane-bound forms was that the O2 and NiEDDA accessibilities were out of phase in the membrane-bound form, while they were in-phase in the soluble protein. Extensive previous studies have shown that out of phase periodicity is caused by a differential effect of membranes on O2 and NiEDDA accessibilities (26Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). O2 is hydrophobic and preferentially partitions into the hydrophobic core of lipid bilayer, whereas NiEDDA preferentially partitions into the aqueous environment and is relatively excluded from the core of bilayers (26Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). As a consequence, membrane-exposed residues exhibit high O2 and low NiEDDA accessibilities. In contrast, the solvent-exposed sites of a membrane protein are highly accessible to NiEDDA and relatively less accessible to O2. A convenient measure of the membrane or solvent exposure of a given site can therefore be obtained through use of the parameter Φ = ln (Π(O2)/Π(NiEDDA)) (26Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 29Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The absolute value of Φ increases with increasing membrane exposure and, for residues located in the hydrocarbon area of the bilayer, Φ increases linearly with the immersion depth of a given site (see “Experimental Procedures”). As illustrated in Fig. 5B, Φ exhibited a periodic oscillation with a periodicity corresponding to that of an α-helix. This data provided additional support for the notion that residues 251-273 formed a continuous helical structure. Plotting the accessibility data for the scanned sequence on a helical wheel (Fig. 5C) showed that the helical structure must be asymmetrically solvated because it contained a face with membrane-exposed residues (yellow circles) and another face with solvent-exposed residues (red circles). The solvent-exposed face contained predominantly hydrophilic residues, including several positively charged amino acids (Fig. 5C). Except for Asp-264 (see “Discussion”), the face that was exposed to lipids primarily contained hydrophobic amino acids (Fig. 5C). The nitroxide side chain at position 254 was exposed to lipid but was located toward the interface between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces of the amphipathic helix (Fig. 5C). If position 254 were occupied by the native His residue, the charged imidazole side chain might assume side chain rotamers that could take up more hydrophilic orientations. Two structural models are consistent with an asymmetrically solvated α-helix of the type identified above. The helix could be parallel to the membrane in the interfacial region of the membrane or it could be transmembrane, lining a water-filled pore (see “Discussion”). Both types of structures have been reported for other proteins (26Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 29Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10324-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). One can distinguish between these two models by determining the immersion depth of the lipid-exposed residues (26Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Although membrane-exposed residues in a peripherally bound helix will be at comparable immersion depth, the immersion depth of lipid-exposed residues in a transmembrane helix will increase linearly toward the center. The immersion depth of the residues with maximal lipid exposure in the scanned region of annexin B12 was determined from the parameter Φ and a calibration curve as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 6, the immersion depths increased linearly on either side of 264R1, which, at an immersion depth of ∼20 Å, represented the deepest residue. These data were inconsistent with a peripherally bound α-helix but were in excellent agreement with the formation of a transmembrane helix. Previous studies (30Mailliard W.S. Leucke H. Haigler H.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9045-9050Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Langen R. Isas J.M. Luecke H. Haigler H.T. Hubbell W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22453-22457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) showed that annexin B12 exists in three forms: a soluble monomer, a Ca2+-dependent peripheral membrane-bound trimer (31Langen R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22453-22457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and a novel Ca2+-independent transmembrane monomer (8Isas J.M. Cartailler J.P. Sokolov Y. Patel D.R.

These three forms undergo reversible interconversion, with the equilibrium modulated by phospholipid, Ca2+, and H+. The primary goal of the current study was to use a site-directed spin labeling approach to compare the structure of the A helix-loop-B helix region of the fourth repeat of annexin B12 in the soluble and Ca2+-independent membrane-inserted forms. In solution, the EPR mobility (Fig. 3, A and B) and accessibility (Fig. 4) parameters for the scanned region were consistent with the crystal structure of the protein. Other studies showed that this region had a structure similar to the crystal form of annexin B12 in the Ca2+-dependent membrane-bound form. 5J. M. Isas, Y. E. Kim, H. T. Haigler, and R. Langen, unpublished observations. However, significant changes in both mobility (Fig. 3, A and B) and accessibility (Fig. 5) were observed at most sites in this region when these EPR parameters were measured following pH-induced association with membranes. The helix-loop-helix structure observed in solution was converted into a continuous α-helix in the membrane-bound state. Accessibility data clearly showed that the membrane-associated helical structure was asymmetrically solvated with one side exposed to the lipid and the other side exposed to an aqueous environment (Fig. 5). The depth profile of the lipid-exposed residues showed that the helix was transmembrane (Fig. 6). Arg-274 is located one residue beyond this transmembrane helix, and this positively charged residue may stabilize the proposed structure by interacting with the negatively charged head groups of the phospholipid bilayer. A structural model that is consistent with these data is presented in Fig. 1B. In this model, the hydrophilic face of the scanned α-helix faces an aqueous pore formed by several other amphipathic transmembrane helices (further discussed below). This pore structure may mediate the in vitro ion channel-like activity of annexin B12 (8Isas J.M. Cartailler J.P. Sokolov Y. Patel D.R. Langen R. Luecke H. Hall J.E. Haigler H.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3015-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic face of the transmembrane helix faces the core of the bilayer. Most of the residues on the lipid-facing side of the transmembrane α-helix are hydrophobic amino acids that were buried in the core of the crystal structure of soluble annexin B12 (Figs. 1A and 5C). However, Asp-264 is also located on the center of the hydrophobic face of the helix (Fig. 5C) at the site that is most deeply buried in the bilayer (Fig. 6). The interaction of charged carboxylate Asp side chains with the hydrophobic core of bilayers is very energetically unfavorable, but uncharged protonated side chains (as expected at pH 4) can be embedded in bilayers without penalty (35Wimley W.C.

It is interesting to note that Asp-264 is likely to be a Ca2+-coordination site that participates in Ca2+-dependent binding of annexin B12 to the surface of bilayers. Thus, a switch between the interaction of Asp-264 with Ca2+ and H+ may be a trigger for refolding and membrane insertion of this region of annexin B12. There are a number of structural similarities and a few differences between the pH-induced membrane insertions of the D-E hairpin that was previously reported (11Langen R. Isas J.M. Hubbell W.L. Haigler H.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14060-14065Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and the A-B hairpin described herein. The common elements are that both helical hairpins undergo membrane and H+-induced refolding to form continuous transmembrane amphipathic helices with Glu or Asp residues on or near the hydrophobic faces. Both transmembrane helices are ∼20 amino acids long and are flanked by positively charged amino acids that may interact favorably with the negatively charged head groups of the bilayer phospholipids. Both transmembrane helices are amphipathic and are formed by inside-out refolding of helices in the soluble protein. In the soluble form of annexin B12, the hydrophilic face of the A, D, and E helices largely face the solvent-exposed external surface of the protein. In contrast, the hydrophilic face of the B-helix is buried in the center of the protein. It is unusual for soluble proteins to pack hydrophilic side chains in their core. In annexin B12, this feature is accomplished by a mechanism in which the buried hydrophilic face of the B-helix interacts with hydrophilic residues across the interface of different repeat domains in the center of the protein. A major difference between the helical hairpins that have been scanned in annexin B12 is that the loop between the D and E helices contains three residues, whereas the loop between the A and B helices contains six residues. These loops refold and contribute approximately one or two turns, respectively, to the transmembrane helix. In both cases, the length of the loop is such that the hydrophobic faces of the original helix-loop-helix regions line up on the same side of the transmembrane helix. The model shown in Fig. 1B depicts an aqueous pore formed by several amphipathic helices. Because the Ca2+-independent membrane-inserted form of annexin B12 is a monomer (24Ladokhin A.S. Haigler H.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3402-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), several other regions capable of forming transmembrane helices are thought to be present within the amino acid sequence of this protein. An inspection of the amino acid sequence of annexin B12 reveals five additional helical hairpins with structural similarities to the transmembrane helices formed by the A-B helical hairpins in this study and the D-E region in the previous study (11Langen R. Isas J.M. Hubbell W.L. Haigler H.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14060-14065Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These transmembrane helices (five putative plus the two subjected to nitroxide scans) correspond to seven of the eight A-B and D-E helical hairpins on the convex face of annexin B12. The A-B helical hairpin of repeat III was not included as a putative transmembrane helix because it did not contain a region that could form a continuous α-helix, perhaps because it contains one more amino acid in its loop than are present in the other three A-B loops. The seven putative transmembrane helices are reasonably amphipathic and also harbor Glu and Asp residues on or near the hydrophobic face. Each of these helices also contains ∼20 amino acids and is therefore of sufficient length to span the bilayers. In addition, each helix is flanked by either positively charged residues or good turn-forming residues, a feature commonly observed in transmembrane helices. Thus, these regions also might be able to refold and form continuous transmembrane helices as indicated by the gray cylinders shown in Fig. 1B. Future studies are needed to evaluate the validity of those additional transmembrane regions of annexin B12, and to determine the physiological significance of Ca2+-independent membrane insertion of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W2078098094,"The structure of crystalline porcine mitochondrial NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) has been determined in complex with Mn2+-isocitrate. Based on structural alignment between this porcine enzyme and seven determined crystal structures of complexes of NADP with bacterial IDHs, Arg83, Thr311, and Asn328 were chosen as targets for site-directed mutagenesis of porcine IDH. The circular dichroism spectra of purified wild-type and mutant enzymes are similar. The mutant enzymes exhibit little change in Km for isocitrate or Mn2+, showing that these residues are not involved in substrate binding. In contrast, the Arg83 mutants, Asn328 mutants, and T311A exhibit 3-20-fold increase in the KmNADP. We propose that Arg83 enhances NADP affinity by hydrogen bonding with the 3′-OH of the nicotinamide ribose, whereas Asn328 hydrogen bonds with N1 of adenine. The pH dependence of Vmax for Arg83 and Asn328 mutants is similar to that of wild-type enzyme, but for all the Thr311 mutants, pKes is increased from 5.2 in the wild type to ∼6.0. We have previously attributed the pH dependence of Vmax to the deprotonation of the metal-bound hydroxyl of isocitrate in the enzyme-substrate complex, prior to the transfer of a hydride from isocitrate to NADP's nicotinamide moiety. Thr311 interacts with the nicotinamide ribose and is the closest of the target amino acids to the nicotinamide ring. Distortion of the nicotinamide by Thr311 mutation will likely be transmitted to Mn2+-isocitrate resulting in an altered pKes.

The porcine mitochondrial NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.42) (NADP-IDH) 1The abbreviation used is: NADP-IDH, NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. is a divalent metal-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate using NADP as a cofactor.

Previous studies from our laboratory suggest that Arg314, His315, and Tyr316 interact with the 2′-phosphate of NADP and are determinants of the coenzyme specificity of isocitrate dehydrogenase (13Huang Y.C.

Although the porcine mitochondrial NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase has not been crystallized in complex with coenzyme, NADP has been modeled within the crystal structure of this mammalian enzyme using a structural alignment between the porcine enzyme-Mn2+-isocitrate complex and seven determined crystal structures of bacterial IDH-NADP complexes (7Ceccarelli C.

Fig. 1 shows a view of the model of the NADP-Mn2+-isocitrate complex of pig mitochondrial NADP-IDH. To evaluate the location of NADP in this model, we have selected as targets for site-directed mutagenesis three amino acids distributed throughout the predicted coenzyme site: Arg83, Thr311, and Asn328. Arg83 and Thr311 are positioned close to the nicotinamide ribose and 5′-phosphate, whereas Asn328 is near the adenine ring (Fig. 1). A structure-based alignment of two regions of the amino acid sequences of NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenases from six species is shown in Fig. 2. Arg83 is conserved among mammals but not in lower organisms, while Thr311 and Asn328 are conserved in all species. The results of this report demonstrate that all three of these amino acids contribute to and delineate the extent of the coenzyme binding site of the mitochondrial porcine NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase.Fig. 2Structure-based sequence alignment of two selected regions of NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase of porcine heart mitochondria (PmIDH), human heart mitochondria (HmIDH), human cytosol (HcIDH), E. coli (EcIDH), Bacillus subtilis (BsIDH), and A. pernix (ApIDH).

Circular Dichroism Spectra of the Wild-type and Mutant Enzymes—CD spectra were measured at room temperature using a Jasco model J-710 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Inc., Easton, MD).

The concentrations of wild-type and mutant enzymes were determined using the A280 nm and the Bio-Rad dye-binding assay based on the method of Bradford (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). Kinetics of Wild-type and Mutant NADP-Dependent Isocitrate Dehydrogenases—The activity of NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase was monitored continuously by the reduction of NADP to NADPH (ϵ340 nm = 6.22 × 103 m-1 cm-1) at 25 °C. The standard assay solution (1 ml) contained 30 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride buffer (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm NADP, 4 mm dl-isocitrate, and 2 mm MnSO4, unless otherwise noted. For Km determinations, the concentration of NADP, isocitrate, or Mn2+ was varied, whereas the other substrates were maintained at saturating concentrations. The Km values for NADP were determined by varying the concentrations of NADP while maintaining the isocitrate and Mn2+ at the saturating concentrations of 4 mm and 2 mm, respectively. The assay solution for measuring Km at pH 7.4 contained 30 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, and the assay solution for measuring Km at pH 5.5 contained 30 mm sodium acetate buffer. The Km values (with standard errors) were determined from direct plots of velocity versus substrate concentration using Sigma Plot software. The pH dependence of Vmax for the reaction catalyzed by wild-type and mutant isocitrate dehydrogenases were determined over the range pH 5-8, using the buffers previously described (9Huang Y.C. Grodsky N.B. Kim T.K. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2821-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The reaction rates were determined using 4 mm isocitrate, 0.1-10 mm NADP, and 2-6 mm Mn2+, as indicated for each enzyme. Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant Enzymes—The pig heart NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase mutant enzymes were generated using expression vector pMALcIDP1, and the QuikChange-XL kit method with oligonucleotides encoding substituted amino acids. At position 83, the positively charged arginine was substituted with glutamine (to eliminate the charge but maintain the hydrogen bonding potential) or lysine (to maintain the positive charge, but change the shape). At position 311, threonine was replaced by alanine (which is only slightly smaller, but lacks the hydrogen bonding potential), by serine (which is also slightly smaller, but retains the possibility of hydrogen bonding) or by asparagine (which is much larger, yet maintains the hydrogen bonding capability). At position 328, asparagine was changed to the negatively charged aspartate or to the neutral, but smaller, serine. The wild-type and all mutant enzymes expressed in E. coli as maltose fusion proteins, were cleaved by thrombin and purified, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The wild-type and mutant enzymes each exhibit a single protein band on polyacrylamide gels containing SDS and each one has the same subunit molecular mass (about 46.6 kDa); representative samples are shown in Fig. 3. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of these purified porcine isocitrate dehydrogenases also demonstrate that these recombinant porcine enzymes are not contaminated with the E. coli isocitrate dehydrogenase, since the N-terminal sequences of the E. coli and porcine enzymes differ in 9 of the first 10 amino acids. Circular Dichroism Spectra of Wild-type and Mutant Enzymes—CD spectra of wild-type and mutant isocitrate dehydrogenases were measured to evaluate whether there are changes in secondary structure in these mutant enzymes. The CD spectra of R83Q, R83K, T311A, T311S, T311N, N328S, and N328D mutant enzymes are very similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (data not shown). These results suggest that the mutations do not cause any appreciable conformational changes. Kinetic Characteristics of Wild-type and Mutant Enzymes— The kinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant porcine NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases are summarized in Table II. The Km values for NADP were measured at pH 7.4, containing 4 mm isocitrate and 2 mm Mn2+. Except for T311S and T311N mutant enzymes, all the mutant enzymes exhibit significantly higher Km values for NADP as compared with that of wild-type enzyme (5.59 μm). The Km values for NADP of glutamine and lysine mutant enzymes at position 83 are increased 3-15-fold compared with wild type. The Km value for NADP of the alanine mutant at position 311 is increased about 12 times that of wild type. In contrast, for the serine and asparagine mutant enzymes at the same position (311), the Km values for NADP are very similar to that of wild type. Replacement of asparagine by aspartate and serine at position 328 results, respectively, in about 4 and 20 times increase in Km for NADP. These results indicate that Arg 83, Thr311, and Asn328 are involved in coenzyme binding.Table IIKinetic parameters at pH 7.4 for wild-type and mutant porcine NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases for NADP, isocitrate, and Mn2+EnzymeKmNADPaThe kinetic parameters were determined at 30 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride (pH 7.4).

These results indicate that Arg83, Thr311, and Asn328 are not directly involved in the binding of isocitrate or Mn2+ by the enzyme. The specific activity of wild-type enzyme, measured under the standard assay conditions at pH 7.4, containing 4 mm isocitrate, 2 mm Mn2+, and 0.1 mm NADP, is 37.8 μmol min-1 mg-1. Table II also shows the Vmax values of wild-type and the mutant isocitrate dehydrogenases extrapolated to saturating concentrations of NADP. The Vmax value of wild-type enzyme is 42.9 μmol min-1 mg-1 and the corresponding values of R83Q, R83K, T311A, and N328S mutant enzymes are only a little lower, whereas the Vmax of N328D enzyme is reduced to 36% of that of wild-type enzyme. Notably, the T311N mutant enzyme has a markedly decreased Vmax value (less than 1% of the wild-type value); the relatively large size of the asparagine which replaces the threonine may so distort the binding of the coenzyme that the maximum catalytic rate is affected. In contrast, substitution of threonine at position 311 by serine not only does not decrease activity but actually gives a large increase in Vmax (82.4 μmol min-1 mg-1). However, it is notable that kcat/KmNADP for the T311S mutant is similar to that of wild type (Table II). pH Dependence of Vmax—The pH-Vmax profiles of wild-type and mutant isocitrate dehydrogenases were measured using saturating concentrations of substrate and coenzyme (4 mm isocitrate, 2-6 mm Mn2+, and 1-10 mm NADP). The Vmax of the recombinant wild-type enzyme depends on the basic form of an ionizable group of the enzyme-substrate complex (9Huang Y.C. Grodsky N.B. Kim T.K. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2821-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The dependence of Vmax on pH was analyzed by Equation 1, Vmax,obs=Vmax,int1+[H+]Kes(Eq. 1) where Vmax,obs is the maximum velocity measured at each pH, Vmax,int is the intrinsic maximum velocity, which is independent of pH, and Kes is the dissociation constant of an ionizable group of the enzyme-substrate complex. Over the pH range 5-8, the pH-Vmax profiles for all Arg83 and Asn328 mutant enzymes are similar to that of wild type, whereas those for Thr311 mutant enzymes are shifted toward higher pH, yielding higher pKes values. Table III summarizes the pKes values for wild type, as well as the Arg83, Thr311, and Asn328 mutant enzymes. For all the enzymes, substrates saturated the active site under the conditions used. Increasing the already high concentrations of NADP to 10 mm and Mn2+ to 6 mm did not change the pH-Vmax profiles. The pKes values of the Arg83 mutant enzymes and N328D are similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (about 5.2 to 5.4). The Vmax values of these mutant enzymes probably depend on the ionizable form of the same group as in the wild-type enzyme. The pKes of the N328S mutant enzyme is slightly higher, 5.63, which may reflect a relatively small perturbation of the pKes of the same ionizable group seen in wild type. In contrast, the pKes values of all Thr311 mutant enzymes are significantly higher than that of the wild-type enzyme. Although the Vmax,int of the Thr311 mutant enzymes ranges from 0.33 to 82 μmol min-1 mg-1, all three Thr311 mutant enzymes have similar pK values, 6.0-6.2.Table IIIKinetic parameters for the pH-Vmax profiles for wild-type and mutant enzymes The pKes values were measured in different pH buffers containing various concentrations of NADP, Mn2+, and isocitrate. The pH-Vmax curves were superimposable when 0.5 or 1 mm NADP, 2 or 4 mm Mn2+ and 4 or 8 mm isocitrate were used for wild type; when 1, 7, or 10 mm NADP, 2, 4, 5, or 6 mm Mn2+ and 4 mm isocitrate were used for R83Q; when 1, 5, 7, or 10 mm NADP, 2 or 6 mm Mn2+ and 4 mm isocitrate were used for R83K; when 1, 2, 5, 7, or 10 mm NADP, 2, 4, 5, or 6 mm Mn2+ and 4 mm isocitrate were used for T311A; and when 1 or 2 mm NADP, 2 mm Mn2+ and 4 mm isocitrate were used for N328S. For T311N and T311S, 0.1 mm NADP, 2 mm Mn2+ and 4 mm isocitrate were used; and for N328D, 1 mm NADP, 2 mm Mn2+ and 4 mm isocitrate were used. These results indicate that these enzymes were saturated with substrates over the full pH range and that the measured values were actually Vmax values as a function of pH. The substrate concentrations are all high relative to the Km values. For example, for wild-type, R83Q, R83K, and T311A, at pH 5.5 the Km values for NADP were 17-261 μm, and for Mn2+ 1-6 μm.EnzymepKesVmax,intμmol/min/mgWild type5.24 ± 0.0342.9 ± 1.0R83Q5.38 ± 0.0432.4 ± 0.5R83K5.25 ± 0.0635.5 ± 0.7T311A6.01 ± 0.0231.1 ± 0.6T311S6.19 ± 0.0282.2 ± 0.9T311N5.97 ± 0.030.33 ± 0.01N328S5.63 ± 0.0429.7 ± 0.5N328D5.19 ± 0.0215.1 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab In this study, the characterization of mutant enzymes with replacements at Arg83, Thr311, and Asn328 have implicated these three amino acids in the coenzyme site of the porcine mitochondrial NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. The Arg83 and Asn328 mutant enzymes, as well as the T311A enzyme have strikingly elevated Km values for NADP, while the Km values for the other substrates are similar to those of wild-type enzyme. In the structure shown in Fig. 1, the guanidino group of Arg83 is close to the 3′-OH of the nicotinamide ribose, and to the 5′-O of that ribose, which is linked to a phosphorus of the pyrophosphate moiety. The distance between the 3′-OH and the closest nitrogen of Arg83 is 4.6Å; however, there is an enzyme-bound water only 2.83Å from that N of Arg83, which may mediate a hydrogen bond between the 3′-OH of the ribose and Arg83. The closest distance is 5.7 Å between Arg83 and the 5′-O of the pyrophosphate. It is apparent that the positive charge of the amino acid at position 83 contributes to the affinity between the enzyme and NADP because the KmNADP for R83K is one-fourth that of R83Q. The structure of the NADP complex of the human cytosolic NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase has recently been reported as the second mammalian IDH to be crystallized (18Xu X. Zhao J. Xu Z. Peng B. Huang Q. Arnold E. Ding J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33946-33957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar); however, the functions of the amino acids near the coenzyme have not been evaluated by mutagenesis. The porcine mitochondrial NADP-IDH is 77% identical plus similar in amino acid sequence to human cytosolic IDH and an overlay of the structures of the porcine mitochondrial IDH (PDB 1LWD) and the human cytosolic IDH (PDB 1T09) shows the strong structural resemblance of the two enzymes. In the structure of the human cytosolic enzyme, the corresponding Arg82 is also considered to form a hydrogen bond with the 3′-OH of the nicotinamide ribose of NADP (18Xu X. Zhao J. Xu Z. Peng B. Huang Q. Arnold E. Ding J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33946-33957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In the porcine mitochondrial IDH (Fig. 1), Thr311 is close to the oxygen in the ring of the furanose form of the nicotinamide ribose of NADP, as well as to the 5′-O of the ribose. The ability to form a hydrogen bond and the size of the amino acid at position 311 are important in NADP binding and in the catalytic reaction. Replacement of Thr311 by alanine, which cannot form hydrogen bonds, results in more than a 10-fold increase in KmNADP. In contrast, when Thr311 is replaced by serine, which can form hydrogen bonds, the KmNADP is only 1.7× that of wild-type enzyme. Substitution of the larger asparagine for Thr311 allows hydrogen bonding, but the enzyme-NADP complex must be distorted in accommodating the larger side chain. Thus, for the T311N enzyme, the KmNADP is similar to that of the wild-type enzyme, but Vmax is less than 1% that of wild type. Thr311 is the closest, of the three amino acids we have here mutated, to the enzyme-bound Mn2+-isocitrate. In the catalytic dehydrogenation of isocitrate, a hydride is transferred from isocitrate to the N-4 position of the nicotinamide of NADP. It is reasonable that any perturbation of the enzyme-bound nicotinamide of NADP, which likely occurs when a larger amino acid is substituted at position 311, results in a decreased Vmax. Indeed substitution of any amino acid at position 311 causes a change in the pH dependence of Vmax, as indicated by the elevated pKes for all the Thr311 mutant enzymes (from 5.2 in wild type to about 6.0 in all the Thr311 mutant enzymes). We have previously attributed the pH dependence of Vmax to the deprotonation of the metal-bound hydroxyl of isocitrate in the enzyme-substrate complex (9Huang Y.C. Grodsky N.B. Kim T.K. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2821-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although Thr311 is about 12Å from the enzyme-bound Mn2+ (Fig. 1), any distortion of the nicotinamide could readily be transmitted to the nearby Mn2+-isocitrate with a concomitant change in the pKes. It is notable that the corresponding Thr311 in the human cytosolic IDH (18Xu X. Zhao J. Xu Z. Peng B. Huang Q. Arnold E. Ding J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33946-33957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) occupies a similar location to that of Thr311 in the mitochondrial enzyme, and it may have the same role in interacting with NADP. Asn328 of the porcine mitochondrial IDH is located at the other end of the coenzyme binding site near the adenine ring (Fig. 1). The nitrogen of the carbamido side chain of the asparagine is within hydrogen bonding distance (2.70Å) of the N1 of the adenine, and thus can facilitate the binding of NADP. Replacement of Asn328 by the much smaller Ser results in a 20-fold increase in the KmNADP, likely reflecting the increased distance between Ser328 and the N1 of the purine ring. Substitution of the similarly sized but negatively charged Asp for Asn328 is also detrimental to the affinity between enzyme and NADP ( KmNADP is 4.4× that of wild-type enzyme), but less so than in the case of N328S. In the human cytosolic NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase, Asn328 is also positioned to hydrogen bond to the N1 of the NADP adenine (18Xu X. Zhao J. Xu Z. Peng B. Huang Q. Arnold E. Ding J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33946-33957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Indeed, most of the amino acid side chains close to the NADP bound to the porcine mitochondrial IDH occupy similar locations in the crystal structure of the human cytoplasmic IDH (18Xu X. Zhao J. Xu Z. Peng B. Huang Q. Arnold E. Ding J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33946-33957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In previous studies from our laboratory, mutagenesis experiments indicated that Arg314 and Tyr316 (14Lee P. Colman R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 401: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), as well as His315 (13Huang Y.C. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5637-5643Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) of the porcine mitochondrial NADP-specific IDH dehydrogenase interact with the 2′-phosphate of NADP and contribute to the coenzyme specificity of the enzyme. His309 not only can affect coenzyme binding, but also influences the enzyme interaction with metal ion in the presence of isocitrate (13Huang Y.C. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5637-5643Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although sequence alignment indicates there is only 16% identity between the porcine and E. coli IDHs (7Ceccarelli C. Grodsky N.B. Ariyaratne N. Colman R.F. Bahnson B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43454-43462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), amino acids corresponding to His309, Arg314, and Tyr316 have been observed in the NADP site of the crystalline isocitrate dehydrogenase of E. coli (19Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8671-8688Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 20Stoddard B.L. Dean A.M. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9310-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the hyperthermophile Aeropyrum pernix, the adenine ring of NADP lies between the main chain of Asn356 and the side chain of His343 (21Karlstrőm M. Stokke R. Steen I.H. Birkeland N-K. Ladenstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 559-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The Asn356 and His343 of A. pernix IDH are equivalent to Asn328 and His309, respectively, of porcine mitochondrial NADP-IDH (Fig. 2). It has been pointed out that the use of NADP by prokaryotic IDHs is an ancient adaptation to growth on acetate (22Zhu G. Golding G.B. Dean A.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1279-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), so it is not surprising that most of the amino acids which interact with the coenzyme are conserved. However, only in the other crystalline mammalian enzyme, human cytosolic NADP-IDH (18Xu X. Zhao J. Xu Z. Peng B. Huang Q. Arnold E. Ding J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33946-33957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), are all of the amino acids identified in the coenzyme site of the porcine mitochondrial NADP-IDH found in approximately the same location. The present study of site-directed mutagenesis in the coenzyme site of porcine mitochondrial NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase is consistent with the crystal structure of the Mn2+-isocitrate complex of the same enzyme with NADP positioned in silico (7Ceccarelli C. Grodsky N.B. Ariyaratne N. Colman R.F. Bahnson B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43454-43462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and with the recently reported crystal structure of the human cytosolic IDH complexed with NADP (18Xu X. Zhao J. Xu Z. Peng B. Huang Q. Arnold E. Ding J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33946-33957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Arg83, Thr311, and Asn328 are all located close to enzyme-bound NADP where they are determinants of the enzyme affinity for coenzyme. In addition, Thr311 is in the vicinity of the nicotinamide ring of NADP, which must be close to the enzyme-bound metal-isocitrate, and therefore the amino acid at position 311 can indirectly influence the ionization of the metal-liganded hydroxyl of isocitrate in the active site. The porcine mitochondrial NADP-IDH has 95% amino acid sequence identity with human mitochondrial NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. Therefore it is likely that the results of this study will be applicable to the human enzyme.

Toxoplasma gondii produces a protein, cyclophilin-18 (C-18), which binds to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-receptor CCR5 and inhibits fusion and infection of T cells and macrophages by R5 viruses but not by X4 viruses. We recently identified structural determinants of C-18 required for anti-HIV activity (Yarovinsky, F., Andersen, J. F., King, L. R., Caspar, P., Aliberti, J., Golding, H., and Sher, A. (2004) J.

To delineate the regions of CCR5 involved in C-18 binding, we analyzed C-18 inhibition of cells expressing CXCR4/CCR5 chimeric receptors and CCR5 with a truncated N terminus (Δ2–19). These experiments identified a critical role for the N terminus of CCR5 in C-18 binding and anti-HIV activity. Studies with a large panel of CCR5 N-terminal peptides, including Tyr-sulfated analogues, truncated peptides, and alanine-scanning mutants, suggested that each of the 12–17 amino acids in the N terminus of CCR5 are essential for C-18 binding and inhibitory activity. Tyr sulfation did not improve C-18 reactivity. This finding is of interest because the same CCR5 N-terminal region was shown previously to play a key role in binding of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins. The elucidation of the functional C-18-binding mechanism may help in the rational design of novel antiviral agents against HIV.

In addition, T. gondii cyclophilin C-18, but not a closely related cyclophilin from the apicomplexan protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum, bound specifically to human CCR5 and blocked fusion and infection with multiple R5 HIV-1 isolates (16Golding H.

In a recent study, we established that the peptidyl prolyl cis-trans-isomerase enzymatic activity of T. gondii cyclophilin is not required for its HIV-1 blocking activity in human cells. Furthermore, we identified several amino acids in C-18 critically required for interactions with CCR5 (17Yarovinsky F. Andersen J.F. King L.R. Caspar P. Aliberti J. Golding H. Sher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53635-53642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The current study was aimed at identifying regions in CCR5 that are involved in C-18 binding. This work has identified a critical sequence in the N terminus of CCR5 that is required for C-18 interaction and anti-HIV activity. Expression and Purification of Recombinant C-18 Protein—Recombinant C-18 expression and purification steps were described elsewhere (15Aliberti J. Valenzuela J.G. Carruthers V.B. Hieny S. Andersen J.

In brief, a plasmid encoding C-18 was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLys (Invitrogen). Purified inclusion bodies obtained from bacteria induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Invitrogen) for 4 h were solubilized in 6 m guanidine HCl. The protein was refolded in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl buffer, dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer and purified on HiPrep 16/10 Q FF column (Amersham Biosciences), using 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl for elution. Peptides—Table I lists the sequences of the key peptides used in the study. All peptides were synthesized at the Facility for Biotechnology Resources, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, on an Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer model 433 (Foster City, CA) by standard Fmoc (9-fluorenyl methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. After cleavage followed by precipitation and washing with methyl tert-butyl ether, peptides were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography using Walters DeltaPak C-18 column and a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile. Fractions containing the desired peptide products were evaporated to remove acetonitrile prior to lyophilization for long term storage. For peptides with sulfotyrosine, sulfotyrosine was incorporated into the growing peptide chain, on the instrument during synthesis, by using N-a-Fmoc-O-sulfo-l-tyrosine sodium salt hydrate as the building block. The sulfotyrosine amino acid, as well as all unmodified amino acids used for this project, was purchased from Anaspec Inc. (San Jose, CA). The purified peptides were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Table ICCR5-derived peptides used in the current studyCCR5 regionPeptide sequenceECL-2QKEGLHYTCSSHFPYSQYQFWKNFQTLKIN-(1-31)MDYQVSSPIYDINYYTSEPCQKINVKQIAARN-(1-18)MDYQVSSPIYDINYYTSEN-(1-18)sulMDYQVSSPIYSDINYSYTSEaSuperscript S indicates sulfated.N-(16-31)TSEPCQKINVKQIAARN-(1-9)MDYQVSSPIN-(10-18)YDINYYTSECXCR4-(1-38)MEGISIYTSDNYTEEMGSGDYDSMKEPCFREENANFNKR5-(1-18)-SCRYSDTMYPNQIEYSDSIVYGGGCa Superscript S indicates sulfated. Open table in a new tab Peptide ELISA—Peptides/proteins were biotinylated using maleimide PEO2-biotin reagent as per the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). The purified C-18 protein (200 ng/well) was coated onto polystyrene wells. After blocking with Eagle's modified minimal essential medium containing 5% FBS, serial dilutions (100 μl/well) of biotinylated R5-(1–18)-peptide (starting concentration of 100 nm) diluted in blocking solution were added to each well, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, followed by addition of peroxidase conjugated streptavidin. The reaction was quantified using 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonic acid) substrate. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Competition ELISA Using Synthetic Peptides—Competition of peptides with biotinylated R5-(1–18)-peptide for binding to C-18 was performed by peptide ELISA. Fifty microliters (10 μm or 10-fold serial dilutions) of synthetic R5-(1–18)-peptide (or its mutant/shorter derivatives) or a control peptide (CXCR4, N terminus) were added to C-18-coated wells for 30 min at room temperature. Next, the biotinylated R5-(1–18)-peptide (100 nm/50 μl/well) was added for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was developed as described for peptide ELISA. CCR5 Binding Assay—Recombinant C-18 was trace-labeled with 125I from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals (San Carlos, CA). CEM cells (catalogue number CCL-119, CCR5–, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and CEM.NKR.CCR5 cells (a human CCR5 transfectant of the same parental line, kindly provided by John Moore) were incubated in triplicate in 96-well plates (Wallac, Turku, Finland) at 105/well with 125I-labeled C-18 alone or in the presence of N-terminal peptides for 90 min at 21 °C (indirect binding assay). Cells were then washed, and the bound fraction measured radioactively as described earlier (17Yarovinsky F. Andersen J.F. King L.R. Caspar P. Aliberti J. Golding H. Sher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53635-53642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After subtraction of the nonspecific binding to CCR5– cells, the molar amount of CCR5-bound C-18 per well was calculated. In a second binding assay, recombinant FITC-labeled C-18 was incubated with CEM and CEM.NKR.CCR5 cells for 30 min at 4 °C either alone or in the presence of the N-terminal 31-amino acid peptide. Cells were then washed, and the bound C-18 was analyzed by flow cytometry. Recombinant Vaccinia Viruses and Fusion Inhibition Assay—Recombinant vaccinia viruses vCB28 (JR-FL envelope) and vCB43 (Ba-L envelope) were kindly provided by Christopher Broder (Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda) (18Broder C.C. Berger E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9004-9008Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Syncytium formation was measured after co-culture (1:1 ratio, 1 × 105 cells each, in triplicate) of target cells (expressing CD4 and co-receptors) and effectors (12E1 cells, which are CD4 negative (19Hillman K. Shapira-Nahor O. Gruber M.F. Hooley J. Manischewitz J. Seeman R. Vujcic L. Geyer S.J. Golding H. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2131-2139PubMed Google Scholar)) infected overnight with 10 plaque-forming units/cell of recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing HIV-1 envelopes. Serially diluted C-18 was added to the target cells for 60 min at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator (three wells per group). Effector cells were added, and syncytium formation was followed for 3–4 h. Linear regression curves were generated and used to calculate the 50% inhibitory dose (ID50). To test the ability of short peptides derived from CCR5 to bind to C-18 and reverse its fusion-inhibiting activity, serially diluted peptides were preincubated with C-18 in microcentrifuge tubes (1:1 ratio) at 37 °C for 60 min. The peptide/C-18 mixtures were then added to PM1 cells (20Lusso P. Cocchi F. Balotta C. Markham P.D. Louie A. Farci P. Pal R. Gallo R.C. Reitz Jr., M.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3712-3720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in 96-well plates for an additional 60 min at 37 °C, after which the effector cells were added as described above. The C-18-mediated fusion inhibition (in the absence of peptides) was considered as 100% and ranged between 55 and 75% inhibition using effector cells expressing JR-FL or Ba-L envelopes. Stably Transfected U87.CD4 Cells Expressing Chimeric CXCR4/CCR5 Receptors—The construction of plasmids expressing either wild-type CCR5 or CXCR4/CCR5 chimeric molecules (designated FC-1, FC-2, and FC-4b) and the generation of stably transfected U87.CD4 cells expressing these chimeric molecules were described previously (21Antonsson L. Boketoft A. Garzino-Demo A. Olde B. Owman C. AIDS. 2003; 17: 2571-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here we used U87.CD4 expressing either WT CCR5 or FC-1 (CXCR4 Pro-42/Pro-35 CCR5), FC-2 (CXCR4 Asp-74/Ile-67 CCR5), and FC-4b (CXCR4 Ile-185/Cys-178 CCR5) cells. Surface expression of the WT or chimeric CXCR4/CCR5 receptors in the U87.CD4 transfectants was monitored by flow cytometry using either mAb 2D7 (Pharmingen), which recognizes an epitope in the ECL-2 of CCR5, or mAb 5/5B5, which recognizes the CXCR4 N-terminal peptide (amino acids 2–16), as described previously (2Wu L. LaRosa G. Kassam N. Gordon C.J. Heath H. Ruffing N. Chen H. Humblias J. Samson M. Parmentier M. Moore J.P. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1373-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 21Antonsson L. Boketoft A. Garzino-Demo A. Olde B. Owman C. AIDS. 2003; 17: 2571-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The four cell lines expressed comparable levels of WT CCR5 or CXCR4/CCR5 chimeric receptors (Fig. 1). Viral Infectivity Assay—JC.6 (HeLa-CD4 cells expressing wild-type CCR5), R5d18.2 (HeLa-CD4 cells expressing CCR5 that lacks the N-terminal amino acids 2–19), and HIV-1 variant JR-CSF18.2ad D2 (adapted to grow on CCR5 (Δ18))-HeLa-CD4 cells were described previously (22Platt E.J. Wehrly K. Kuhmann S.E. Chesebro B. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Platt E.J. Shea D. Rose P.P. Kabat D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4357-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The HeLa-CD4 derivatives were grown in low glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (DMEM/FBS medium). No selection drug was added. Twenty four hours before infection, cells were plated in flat bottom 96-well plates (2 × 103 cells per well) in 200 μl of DMEM/FBS medium. Prior to infection, the medium was removed, and cells were treated for 20 min with serum-free DMEM (low glucose) containing DEAE-dextran (8 μg/ml), followed by washing with serum-free DMEM. C-18 was added to wells containing cells for 2 h at 37 °C, after which JR-CSF (18.2ad) virus was added at 0.75 × 103 focus-forming units/well. After 24 h of incubation of cells, C-18, and virus at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator, the cells were washed extensively (to remove unbound virus and inhibitor), and fresh DMEM/FBS medium was added to all wells. The plates were cultured for 2 weeks. Supernatants were removed daily, and the cultures were supplemented with fresh medium. Viral production was determined by measuring p24 in culture supernatants using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). C-18-mediated Fusion Inhibition Requires the N Terminus of CCR5—In order to delineate the regions within CCR5 that contribute to C-18 binding, we made use of a panel of U87.CD4 cells expressing chimeric CXCR4/CCR5 (or WT CCR5) receptors. All four stably transfected cell lines expressed similar levels of co-receptor (Fig. 1) and were shown previously to support infection of Ba-L (21Antonsson L. Boketoft A. Garzino-Demo A. Olde B. Owman C. AIDS. 2003; 17: 2571-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and several primary isolates (23Karlsson I. Antonsson L. Shi Y. Karlsson A. Albert J. Leitner T. Olde B. Owman C. Fenyo E.M. AIDS. 2003; 17: 2561-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In a fusion assay, all four cell lines fused with 12E1 effector cells expressing the Ba-L envelope at similar levels (Fig. 2, see legend). Fusion of cells expressing WT CCR5 was effectively blocked by C-18, by the CCR5-agonist MIP1-β, and by mAb 2D7, which targets a conformationally sensitive epitope in CCR5 ECL-2 (Fig. 2). In contrast, cells expressing the FC-1, FC-2, and FC-4b chimeric CXCR4/CCR5 receptors, which have the entire N terminus plus increasing amounts of sequences from CXCR4, fused with JR-FL envelope-expressing cells but were not blocked by either C-18 or MIP1-β. mAb 2D7 blocked fusion of cells expressing wild-type CCR5, FC-1, and FC-2 chimeric co-receptors. In contrast, fusion with FC-4b-expressing cells was not inhibited by mAb 2D7, most likely because the key residues 171-KE-172 at the base of CCR5 ECL-2, which are required for 2D7 binding, were replaced by CXCR4 amino acids in this chimeric receptor (21Antonsson L. Boketoft A. Garzino-Demo A. Olde B. Owman C. AIDS. 2003; 17: 2571-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 24Lee B. Sharron M. Blanpain C. Doranz B.J. Vakili J. Setoh P. Berg E. Liu G.

Virol. 1999; 73: 4145-4155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). These results suggested that the CCR5 N terminus is required for C-18 binding. Peptides Derived from the CCR5 N Terminus Can Reverse C-18-mediated Fusion Inhibition—We next used a panel of synthetic peptides derived from the N terminus and the extracellular loop-2 (ECL-2) of CCR5 (Table I) to investigate further the C-18 contact sites. All the peptides used in the current study had no inhibitory or enhancing effects on the fusion assay when added alone at the highest concentration used (100 μg/ml) (data not shown). Serially diluted peptides were preincubated with C-18 (at 20 μg/ml; 1.1 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C. The solutions, containing C-18 mixed with CCR5-derived peptides, were then added to 96-well plates containing PM1 cells for an additional 1 h at 37 °C. 12E1 cells expressing the JR-FL envelope were added to the same wells (at a 1:1 ratio), and syncytia were scored after 3 h. Based on the maximal inhibition seen by C-18 alone, it was possible to calculate the peptide concentrations required for 50% reduction of C-18-mediated fusion inhibition. As can be seen in Fig. 3A, a peptide containing the complete N-terminal sequence (31 amino acids) could reverse the inhibitory activity of C-18 at ID50 of 23.1 μg/ml (85.2 μm). Control peptide derived from the CXCR4 N terminus did not reverse the inhibitory activity of C-18 (Fig. 3E). The CCR5 N-(1–31) was also able to block the binding of 125C-18 or FITC-C-18 to CEM.NKR.CCR5 cells as demonstrated in Fig. 4, left and right panels, respectively.Fig. 4CCR5 N-terminal peptide can block binding of C-18 to CCR5-expressing CEM cells. Left panel, 125I-labeled C-18 at 1 nm concentration was incubated with CCR5+ and CCR5– cells alone or in the presence of a 1:1, 10:1, or 100:1 excess of CCR5 N-(1–31)-peptide (or control peptides, not shown) for 90 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed, and the bound fraction was measured radioactively. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific background observed with CCR5– cells. Right panel, recombinant FITC-labeled C-18 was incubated with CEM (gray histogram) and CEM.NKR.CCR5 cells (open histogram) for 30 min at 4 °C, either alone or in the presence of CCR5 N-(1–31)-peptide. Cells were then washed, and the bound C-18 was analyzed by flow cytometry. The data shown are representative of two experiments with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the N-terminal 31 amino acids may acquire secondary structure in solution, and this region of CCR5 was shown to contain multiple distinct binding sites for different agonists, we next tested shorter sequences from the CCR5 N terminus. The last 16 amino acids gave very minimal C-18 blocking (data not shown). On the other hand, a peptide containing only the first 18 amino acids from the N terminus of CCR5 (CCR5 N-(1–18)) was 150-fold more active than the 31-amino acid peptide in reversing the fusion inhibition of C-18 (Fig. 3B). A scrambled peptide, CCR5 N-(1–18)-SCR, had no activity and did not reverse the inhibitory activity of C-18 (Fig. 3F). The observed increased activity of N-(1–18)-peptide compared with N-(1–31)-peptide suggests that the shorter peptide has a better fit for C-18, whereas in the context of the 31-amino acid CCR5 N-terminal peptide, a significant amount of folding may occur in solution resulting in masking or steric hindrance for C-18 binding. The EC-II-derived peptide did not significantly block the fusion inhibitory activity of C-18 (data not shown). To map further the critical amino acids within the CCR5 N-(1–18) required for C-18 activity, we examined the ability of two shorter peptides from this region to compete out C-18 fusion inhibition. Most surprisingly, the first 9 residues of the CCR5 N terminus (CCR5 N-(1–9)) had no competitive activity (not shown), whereas the peptide containing residues 10–18 was very active with ID50 of 0.14 μm, identical to CCR5 N-(1–18) (Fig. 3, B and C). It was reported previously that the CCR5 N terminus contains several tyrosine residues that are sulfated, and this post-translational modification is required for interaction with both chemokines and GP120-CD4 complexes (9Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 26Farzan M. Choe H. Vaca L. Martin K. Sun Y. Desjardins E. Ruffing N. Wu L. Wyatt R. Gerard N. Gerard C. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1160-1164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we tested peptide CCR5 N-(1–18) containing two sulfated tyrosines (Tyr-10(S) and Tyr-14(S)). Our data revealed that the sulfated peptide was able to reduce the activity of C-18 with almost identical ID50 values to that of the unsulfated CCR5 N-(1–18)-peptide (Fig. 3D). The N-(1–18)- and N-(10–18)-peptides were also tested for their ability to block the binding of 125I-C-18 to CCR5-expressing CEM cells (Fig. 5). As was demonstrated in the fusion assay, peptides encompassing N-terminal amino acids 1–18 or 10–18 were significantly more effective than the 31-amino acid peptide in competing C-18 binding to CCR5+ CEM cells. Even at 1:1 molar ratios, significant displacement of 125I-C-18 was observed with the shorter N-terminal peptides (Fig. 5). As expected, no inhibition of C-18 binding was seen with a control (1–18, scrambled) peptide (SCR). C-18 Does Not Block HIV-1 Infection of Cells Expressing N-terminal Truncated CCR5 Co-receptors—To address further the contribution of the N terminus of CCR5 to C-18 binding and fusion inhibitory activity, we tested two recently generated HeLa.CD4 cell derivatives expressing either wild-type CCR5 (JC.6) or a CCR5 with N-terminal truncation of amino acids 2–19 (R5d18.2). In a fusion assay with effector cells expressing the JR-FL envelope, both target cells could fuse well. This assay is very sensitive because the effector cells are infected overnight with vaccinia expressing HIV envelopes, resulting in high envelope-expression levels. It was clear that although mAb 2D7 could block fusion of cells expressing either wild-type or truncated CCR5, C-18 completely lost its inhibitory activity against cells expressing the N-terminal truncated CCR5 molecules (Fig. 6). The same cells were also used in an infection assay by using a variant of JR-CSF that was adapted to grow on R5d18.2 cells. It was reported that this viral variant does interact with the N terminus of CCR5, even though it no longer requires this interaction for fusion and infection (most likely due to increased binding avidity to other CCR5 domains) (40Platt E.J. Shea D. Rose P.P. Kabat D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4357-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In our study, the JR-CSF18.2adD2 variant replicated 2-fold better on the JC.6 cells expressing wild-type CCR5 compared with cells expressing truncated CCR5. C-18 reduced infection of JC.6 cells by 75%. In contrast, the same viral variant was resistant to C-18 inhibition when grown on the R5d18.2 cells (Table II). These data further suggested that the first 19 N-terminal amino acid sequence of CCR5 contains crucial residues required for C-18 binding and antiviral activity.Table IIC-18 does not inhibit infection of R5d18.2 HeLa cells expressing CCR5 with truncated N-terminal (Δ2-19)CellVirusInhibitorp24Inhibitionpg/ml%HeLa-CD4 JC.6(CCR5wt)JR-CSF(18.2ad)None17,281C-18 (50 μg/ml)481272HeLa-CD4 R5d18.2JR-CSF(18.2ad)None6145C-18 (50 μg/ml)57916 Open table in a new tab Alanine Scanning to Determine Key CCR5 Contact Residues—To map further the amino acids within CCR5 N-(1–18) critical for C-18 activity, we next conducted alanine-scanning mutagenesis, replacing each of the amino acids in the shorter peptide with alanine (Table III). Peptides with alanine replacement of either Tyr-10, Asp-11, or Glu-18 were fully active. On the other hand, alanine substitutions in each of the remaining amino acids (12Shaheen F. Collman R.G. Curr.
