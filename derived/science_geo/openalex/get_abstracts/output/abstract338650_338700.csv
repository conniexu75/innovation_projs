https://openalex.org/W2037832843,"Endolithic unicellular blue-green algae occur under the surface of orthoquartzite rocks in the dry valleys of southern Victoria Land, Antarctica. This report of primary producers in the Antarctic desert ecosystem suggests that, in future efforts to detect life in extraterrestrial (for example, martian) environments, scientists should consider the possible existence of endolithic life forms."
https://openalex.org/W2073291123,"The existence of a hexagonal (wurtzite) form of silicon, similar to that form of diamond (carbon) observed in meteorites and in the laboratory, has been identified by x-ray diffraction in reaction-bonded silicon nitride containing unreacted silicon. The presence of this phase is due to stresses created in the silicon by the nitridation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2071915087,"The availability of suitable heavy-ion accelerators should make it possible to synthesize and identify additional heavy transuranium elements. Criteria for adequate proof that a new element has been synthesized or found in nature and identified are suggested. The basic criterion must be the proof that the atomic number of the new element is different from the atomic numbers of all previously known elements. Chemical identification constitutes an ideal proof; the procedure must be valid for application to individual atoms in an unequivocal manner. Also satisfactory is the identification of characteristic x rays in connection with the decay of the isotope of the new element. This is likely to involve measurement of the half-life and precise, unique energies of the alpha particles of the new element in coincidence with the characteristic x rays of the daughter nuclide. The proof of a genetic decay relationship through an alpha particle decay chain in which the isotope of the new element is identified by the observation of previously known decay products should be acceptable. Detection of a spontaneous fission activity and measurement of its half-life cannot per se establish that an element with a new atomic number has been produced, even with such informationmore » as fragment mass and kinetic energy distributions, for the systematics cannot be extrapolated reliably into new regions. Similarly, the use of the predicted half-lives for spontaneous fission and alpha decay and of predicted alpha decay energies cannot yet be considered sufficiently reliable. The present understanding of production yields, excitation functions, angular distributions, etc., is not sufficient to establish with certainity the discovery of a new element. Some anticipated features of the identification of ''superheavy'' elements are also mentioned. (RWR)« less"

https://openalex.org/W2003180743,"Third law entropies for silicates of Be, Mg, Ca, Zn, Na, and K containing the same anion group, for example, SiO(4) or SiO(3) or AlSi(3)O(8), are found to be linearly related to their molar volumes. The relationship between the molar volume and the entropy of silicates of Fe and Mn, atoms with unfilled d electron subshells, is different from that of other silicates. The linear correlations yield a useful method of estimating the entropies of ortho-, meta-, and framework silicates (feldspars and feld-spathoids). The estimated entropies of pyrope and almandine at 298 degrees K are 47.47 and 68.13 gibbs per mole, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2041470320,"Arrivals of P waves from a recent event at the Nevada Test Site, recorded at a distance of 15.3 degrees , passed beneath the Yellowstone caldera at depths of 200 and 400 kilometers. The travel time anomalies are modeled by a vertical cylindrical structure with a high-velocity core and a low-velocity collar as compared with the more normal mantle. The velocity structure and vertical extent of this feature are consistent with a chemical mantle plume beneath the Yellowstone caldera."
https://openalex.org/W2005995468,"During the winter of 1975-1976, snowfall from the plumes of large natural-draft cooling towers of power plants has been observed. Snow accumulations up to 2.5 centimeters have been found on the ground at extended distances from the cooling towers, and visibility has been restricted to less than 1600 meters in the tower plume near ground level."
