https://openalex.org/W2835889514,"Tick-borne pathogens are increasing their range and incidence in North America as a consequence of numerous factors including improvements in diagnostics and diagnosis, range expansion of primary vectors, changes in human behavior, and an increasing understanding of the diversity of species of pathogens that cause human disease. Public health agencies have access to human incidence data on notifiable diseases e.g., Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, and often local pathogen prevalence in vector populations. However, data on exposure to vectors and pathogens can be difficult to determine e.g., if disease does not occur. We report on an investigation of exposure to ticks and tick-borne bacteria, conducted at a national scale, using citizen science participation. 16,080 ticks were submitted between January 2016 and August 2017, and screened for B. burgdorferi, B. miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia microti. These data corroborate entomologic investigations of tick distributions in North America, but also identify patterns of local disease risk and tick contact with humans throughout the year in numerous species of ticks and associated pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2842378511,"The current paper reports long-term treatment impact estimates for a randomized evaluation of an early childhood intervention designed to promote children's developmental outcomes and improve the quality of Head Start centers serving high-violence and high-crime areas in inner-city Chicago. Initial evaluations of end-of-preschool data reported that the program led to reductions in child behavioral problems and gains in measures of executive function and academic achievement. For this report, we analyzed adolescent follow-up data taken 10 to 11 years after program completion. We found evidence that the program had positive long-term effects on students' executive function and grades, though effects were somewhat imprecise and dependent on the inclusion of baseline covariates. Results also indicated that treated children had heightened sensitivity to emotional stimuli, and we found no evidence of long-run effects on measures of behavioral problems. These findings raise the possibility that developing programs that improve on the Head Start model could carry long-run benefits for affected children."
https://openalex.org/W2865334598,"Liver regeneration is a complicated pathophysiologic process that is regulated by a myriad of signaling pathways and transcription factors. The interaction among these pathways and factors, either cooperatively or antagonistically, may ultimately lead to recovery and restoration of liver function or permanent loss of liver function and liver failure. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism whereby the chromatin remodeling protein brahma related gene 1 (Brg1) regulates liver regeneration in mice. The Smarca4-Flox strain of mice was crossbred with the Alb-Cre strain to generate hepatocyte-specific Brg1 knockout mice. Liver injury was induced by partial hepatectomy (PHx). We report that Brg1 deletion in hepatocyte compromised liver regeneration and dampened survival after PHx in mice. Brg1 interacted with β-catenin to potentiate Wnt signaling and promote hepatocyte proliferation. Mechanistically, Brg1 recruited lysine demethylase 4 (KDM4) to activate β-catenin target genes. Our data suggest that Brg1 might play an essential role maintaining hepatic homeostasis and contributing to liver repair.—Li, N., Kong, M., Zeng, S., Hao, C., Li, M., Li, L., Xu, Z., Zhu, M., Xu, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2826846093,"A large and growing body of ""big data"" is generated by internet search engines, such as Google. Because people often search for information about public health and medical issues, researchers may be able to use search engine data to monitor and predict public health problems, such as HIV. We sought to assess the feasibility of using Google search data to analyze and predict new HIV diagnoses cases in the United States.From 2007 to 2014, we collected search volume data on HIV-related Google search keywords across the United States. State-level new HIV diagnoses data were collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and AIDSVu.org. We developed a negative binomial model to predict HIV cases using a subset of significant predictor keywords identified by LASSO. The Google search data were combined with state-level HIV case reports provided by the CDC. We use historical data to train the model and predict new HIV diagnoses from 2011 to 2014, with an average R2 value of 0.99 between predicted versus actual cases, and average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 108.75.Results indicate that Google Trends is a feasible tool to predict new cases of HIV at the state level. We discuss the implications of integrating visualization maps and tools based on these models into public health and HIV monitoring and surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2825613144,"Background Cognitive frailty (CF) featured as frailty plus cognitive impairment was deemed to be a novel target for dementia and disable prevention. The study was intended to investigate the epidemiology of CF and the association between CF and all-cause mortality. Methods The national representative cohort study was comprised of 1,103 community-living middle-aged and older adults. CF was defined as the co-existence of dynapenia (weakness and/or slowness) and cognitive impairment (1.5 standard deviations below the age-, sex- and education-matched norms in cognitive tests) without known neurodegenerative diseases. Dynapenia was defined by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia and cognitive function was assessed by the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire. Results The prevalence of CF was 8.6% in this study. Subjects with CF were older, more likely to be women, having less regular exercise, fewer educational years, more depressive symptoms and greater multimorbidity. Compared to robust individuals, CF was significantly associated with all-cause mortality (HR: 3.1, 95% CI:1.3–7.7, p = 0.012). Conclusion Dynapenia and cognitive impairment synergistically contribute to the mortality risk for the participants in this study. Further study is needed to explore the underlying pathophysiology and the reversibility of CF."
https://openalex.org/W2834725273,"The Southern green stinkbug (N. viridula) feeds on developing soybean seeds in spite of their strong defenses against herbivory, making this pest one of the most harmful to soybean crops. To test the hypothesis that midgut bacterial community allows stinkbugs to tolerate chemical defenses of soybean developing seeds, we identified and characterized midgut microbiota of stinkbugs collected from soybean crops, different secondary plant hosts or insects at diapause on Eucalyptus trees. Our study demonstrated that while more than 54% of N. viridula adults collected in the field had no detectable bacteria in the V1-V3 midgut ventricles, the guts of the rest of stinkbugs were colonized by non-transient microbiota (NTM) and transient microbiota not present in stinkbugs at diapause. While transient microbiota Bacillus sp., Micrococcus sp., Streptomyces sp., Staphylococcus sp. and others had low abundance, NTM microbiota was represented by Yokenella sp., Pantoea sp. and Enterococcus sp. isolates. We found some isolates that showed in vitro β-glucosidase and raffinase activities plus the ability to degrade isoflavonoids and deactivate soybean protease inhibitors. Our results suggest that the stinkbugs´ NTM microbiota may impact on nutrition, detoxification and deactivation of chemical defenses, and Enterococcus sp., Yokenella sp. and Pantoea sp. strains might help stinkbugs to feed on soybean developing seeds in spite of its chemical defenses."
https://openalex.org/W2843800587,"Diffuse gliomas often carry point mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1mut), resulting in metabolic stress. Although IDHmut gliomas are difficult to culture in vitro, they thrive in the brain via diffuse infiltration, suggesting brain-specific tumor–stroma interactions that can compensate for IDH-1 deficits. To elucidate the metabolic adjustments in clinical IDHmut gliomas that contribute to their malignancy, we applied a recently developed method of targeted quantitative RNA next-generation sequencing to 66 clinical gliomas and relevant orthotopic glioma xenografts, with and without the endogenous IDH-1R132H mutation. Datasets were analyzed in R using Manhattan plots to calculate distance between expression profiles, Ward's method to perform unsupervised agglomerative clustering, and the Mann Whitney U test and Fisher's exact tests for supervised group analyses. The significance of transcriptome data was investigated by protein analysis, in situ enzymatic activity mapping, and in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy of orthotopic IDH1mut- and IDHwt-glioma xenografts. Gene set enrichment analyses of clinical IDH1mut gliomas strongly suggest a role for catabolism of lactate and the neurotransmitter glutamate, whereas, in IDHwt gliomas, processing of glucose and glutamine are the predominant metabolic pathways. Further evidence of the differential metabolic activity in these cancers comes from in situ enzymatic mapping studies and preclinical in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging. Our data support an evolutionary model in which IDHmut glioma cells exist in symbiosis with supportive neuronal cells and astrocytes as suppliers of glutamate and lactate, possibly explaining the diffuse nature of these cancers. The dependency on glutamate and lactate opens the way for novel approaches in the treatment of IDHmut gliomas.—Lenting, K., Khurshed, M., Peeters, T. H., van den Heuvel, C. N. A. M., van Lith, S. A.

https://openalex.org/W2851744821,"Previous research on adolescent cigarette adoption has focused on peer influence and the perceived status gain from smoking but has ignored the status effects on peer influence. We analyze adolescent peer effects on cigarette consumption while considering the popularity of peers. The analysis is based on a four wave panel survey representative of American high school students. We measure peers' popularity by their eigenvector centrality in high school social networks. Using lagged peers' behavior, school fixed effects, and instrumental variables to control for homophily and contextual confounds, we find that the probability of smoking the following year increases with the mean popularity of smokers, while the popularity of non-smokers has the opposite effect. These effects persist seven and fourteen years later (wave 3 and 4 of the data). In addition, the probability of smoking increases with the smoking propensity of the 20% most popular teens and decreases with the smoking propensity of the bottom 80%. The results indicate the importance of knowing not only the smoking propensity within a school but also the location of smokers within the social hierarchy."
https://openalex.org/W2814170932,"Many baleen whales undertake annual fasting and feeding cycles, resulting in substantial changes in their body condition, an important factor affecting fitness. As a measure of lipid-store body condition, tissue density of a few deep diving marine mammals has been estimated using a hydrodynamic glide model of drag and buoyancy forces. Here, we applied the method to shallow-diving humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in North Atlantic and Antarctic feeding aggregations. High-resolution 3-axis acceleration, depth and speed data were collected from 24 whales. Measured values of acceleration during 5 s glides were fitted to a hydrodynamic glide model to estimate unknown parameters (tissue density, drag term and diving gas volume) in a Bayesian framework. Estimated species-average tissue density (1031.6 ± 2.1 kg m-3, ±95% credible interval) indicates that humpback whale tissue is typically negatively buoyant although there was a large inter-individual variation ranging from 1025.2 to 1043.1 kg m-3. The precision of the individual estimates was substantially finer than the variation across different individual whales, demonstrating a progressive decrease in tissue density throughout the feeding season and comparably high lipid-store in pregnant females. The drag term (CDAm-1) was estimated to be relatively high, indicating a large effect of lift-related induced drag for humpback whales. Our results show that tissue density of shallow diving baleen whales can be estimated using the hydrodynamic gliding model, although cross-validation with other techniques is an essential next step. This method for estimating body condition is likely to be broadly applicable across a range of aquatic animals and environments."
https://openalex.org/W2846301953,"Objectives Bone material properties are a major determinant of bone health in older age, both in terms of fracture risk and implant fixation, in orthopaedics and dentistry. Bone is an anisotropic and hierarchical material so its measured material properties depend upon the scale of metric used. The scale used should reflect the clinical problem, whether it is fracture risk, a whole bone problem, or implant stability, at the millimetre-scale. Indentation, an engineering technique involving pressing a hard-tipped material into another material with a known force, may be able to assess bone stiffness at the millimetre-scale (the apparent elastic modulus). We aimed to investigate whether spherical-tip indentation could reliably measure the apparent elastic modulus of human cortical bone. Materials and methods Cortical bone samples were retrieved from the femoral necks of nineteen patients undergoing total hip replacement surgery (10 females, 9 males, mean age: 69 years). The samples underwent indentation using a 1.5 mm diameter, ruby, spherical indenter tip, with sixty indentations per patient sample, across six locations on the bone surfaces, with ten repeated indentations at each of the six locations. The samples then underwent mechanical compression testing. The repeatability of indentation measurements of elastic modulus was assessed using the co-efficient of repeatability and the correlation between the bone elastic modulus measured by indentation and compression testing was analysed by least-squares regression. Results In total, 1140 indentations in total were performed. Indentation was found to be repeatable for indentations performed at the same locations on the bone samples with a mean co-efficient of repeatability of 0.4 GigaPascals (GPa), confidence interval (C.I): 0.33–0.42 GPa. There was variation in the indentation modulus results between different locations on the bone samples (mean co-efficient of repeatability: 3.1 GPa, C.I: 2.2–3.90 GPa). No clear correlation was observed between indentation and compression values of bone elastic modulus (r = 0.33, p = 0.17). The mean apparent elastic modulus obtained by spherical indentation was 9.9 GPa, the standard deviation for each indent cycle was 0.11 GPa, and the standard deviation between locations on the same sample was 1.01 GPa. The mean compression apparent elastic modulus was 4.42 GPa, standard deviation 1.02 GPa. Discussion Spherical-tip indentation was found to be a repeatable test for measuring the elastic modulus of human cortical bone, demonstrated by a low co-efficient of repeatability in this study. It could not, however, reliably predict cortical bone elastic modulus determined by platens compression testing in this study. This may be due to indentation only probing mechanical properties at the micro-scale while platens compression testing assesses millimetre length-scale properties. Improvements to the testing technique, including the use of a larger diameter spherical indenter tip, may improve the measurement of bone stiffness at the millimetre scale and should be investigated further."
https://openalex.org/W2850167186,"Kelp species are ecologically-important habitat-formers in coastal marine ecosystems, where they alter environmental conditions and promote local biodiversity by providing complex biogenic habitat for an array of associated organisms. While it is widely accepted that kelps harbour significant biodiversity, our current understanding of spatiotemporal variability in kelp-associated assemblages and the key environmental drivers of variability patterns remains limited. Here we examined the influence of ocean temperature and wave exposure on the structure of faunal assemblages associated with the holdfasts of Laminaria hyperborea, the dominant habitat-forming kelp in the northeast Atlantic. We sampled holdfasts from 12 kelp-dominated open-coast sites nested within four regions across the UK, spanning ~9° in latitude and ~2.7° C in mean sea surface temperature. Overall, holdfast assemblages were highly diverse, with 261 taxa representing 11 phyla recorded across the study. We examined patterns of spatial variability for sessile and mobile taxa separately, and documented high variability between regions, between sites within regions, and between replicate holdfasts for both assemblage types. Mobile assemblage structure was more strongly linked to temperature variability than sessile assemblage structure, which was principally structured by site-level variability in factors such as wave exposure. Patterns in the structure of both biogenic habitat and associated assemblages did not vary predictably along a latitudinal gradient in temperature, indicating that other processes acting across multiple spatial and temporal scales are important drivers of assemblage structure. Overall, kelp holdfasts in the UK supported high levels of diversity, that were similar to other kelp-dominated systems globally and comparable to those recorded for other vegetated marine habitats (i.e. seagrass beds), which are perhaps more widely recognised for their high biodiversity value."
https://openalex.org/W2848317965,"Background and purpose Moyamoya angiopathy is a progressive cerebral vasculopathy. The p.R4810K substitution in RNF213 has previously been linked to moyamoya disease in Asian populations. When associated with other medical conditions, such as neurofibromatosis type 1, this vasculopathy is frequently reported as moyamoya syndrome. Intriguingly, most cases of moyamoya-complicated neurofibromatosis type 1 have been described in Caucasians, inverting the population ratio observed in Asians, although prevalence of neurofibromatosis type 1 is constant worldwide. Our aim was to investigate whether, among Caucasians, additive genetic factors may contribute to the occurrence of moyamoya in neurofibromatosis type 1. Methods Whole exome sequencing was carried out on an Italian family with moyamoya-complicated neurofibromatosis type 1 to identify putative genetic modifiers independent of the NF1 locus and potentially involved in moyamoya pathogenesis. Results were validated in an unrelated family of German ancestry. Results We identified the p.P186S substitution (rs35857561) in MRVI1 that segregated with moyamoya syndrome in both the Italian and German family. Conclusions The rs35857561 polymorphism in MRVI1 may be a genetic susceptibility factor for moyamoya in European patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. MRVI1 is a functional partner of ITPR1, PRKG1 and GUCY1A3, which are involved in response to nitric oxide. Mutations in GUCY1A3 have been recently linked to a recessive syndromic form of moyamoya with esophageal achalasia."
https://openalex.org/W2821482323,"Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is an important porcine bacterial pathogen and zoonotic agent responsible for sudden death, septic shock, and meningitis. However, serotype 2 strains are heterogeneous, composed of a multitude of sequence types (STs) whose distribution greatly varies worldwide. Of the virulence factors presently described for S. suis, the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is a critical factor implicated in a multitude of functions, including in impairment of phagocytosis and innate immune cell activation by masking underlying bacterial components. However, these roles have been described using Eurasian ST1 and ST7 strains, which greatly differ from North American ST25 strains. Consequently, the capacity of the CPS to mask surface antigens and putative virulence factors in non-Eurasian strains remains unknown. Herein, the role of the S. suis serotype 2 CPS of a prototype intermediate virulent North American ST25 strain, in comparison with that of a virulent European ST1 strain, with regards to interactions with dendritic cells, as well as virulence during the systemic phase of infection, was evaluated. Results demonstrated that the CPS remains critical for virulence and development of clinical disease regardless of strain background, due to its requirement for survival in blood. However, its role in the interactions with dendritic cells is strain-dependent. Consequently, certain key characteristics associated with the CPS are not necessarily applicable to all S. suis serotype 2 strains. This indicates that though certain factors may be important for S. suis serotype 2 virulence, strain background could be as determining, reiterating the need in using strains from varying backgrounds in order to better characterize the S. suis pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2871951898,"Over the past few decades, the rise of multiple chronic conditions has become a major concern for clinicians. However, it is still not known precisely how multiple chronic conditions emerge among patients. We propose an unsupervised multi-level temporal Bayesian network to provide a compact representation of the relationship among emergence of multiple chronic conditions and patient level risk factors over time. To improve the efficiency of the learning process, we use an extension of maximum weight spanning tree algorithm and greedy search algorithm to study the structure of the proposed network in three stages, starting with learning the inter-relationship of comorbidities within each year, followed by learning the intra-relationship of comorbidity emergence between consecutive years, and finally learning the hierarchical relationship of comorbidities and patient level risk factors. We also use a longest path algorithm to identify the most likely sequence of comorbidities emerging from and/or leading to specific chronic conditions. Using a de-identified dataset of more than 250,000 patients receiving care from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for a period of five years, we compare the performance of the proposed unsupervised Bayesian network in comparison with those of Bayesian networks developed based on supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches, as well as multivariate probit regression, multinomial logistic regression, and latent regression Markov mixture clustering focusing on traumatic brain injury (TBI), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression (Depr), substance abuse (SuAb), and back pain (BaPa). Our findings show that the unsupervised approach has noticeably accurate predictive performance that is comparable to the best performing semi-supervised and the second-best performing supervised approaches. These findings also revealed that the unsupervised approach has improved performance over multivariate probit regression, multinomial logistic regression, and latent regression Markov mixture clustering."
https://openalex.org/W2824875856,"Self-reported scales and objective measurement tools are used to evaluate self-perceived and objective knowledge of evidence-based practice (EBP). Agreement between self-perceived and objective knowledge of EBP terminology has not been widely investigated among healthcare students.The aim of this study was to examine agreement between self-reported and objectively assessed knowledge of EBP terminology among healthcare students. A secondary objective was to explore this agreement between students with different levels of EBP exposure.Students in various healthcare disciplines and at different academic levels from Norway (n = 336) and Canada (n = 154) were invited to answer the Terminology domain items of the Evidence-Based Practice Profile (EBP2) questionnaire (self-reported), an additional item of 'evidence based practice' and six random open-ended questions (objective). The open-ended questions were scored on a five-level scoring rubric. Interrater agreement between self-reported and objective items was investigated with weighted kappa (Kw). Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to estimate overall agreement.Mean self-reported scores varied across items from 1.99 ('forest plot') to 4.33 ('evidence-based practice'). Mean assessed open-ended answers varied from 1.23 ('publication bias') to 2.74 ('evidence-based practice'). For all items, mean self-reported knowledge was higher than that assessed from open-ended answers (p<0.001). Interrater agreement between self-reported and assessed open-ended items varied (Kw = 0.04-0.69). The overall agreement for the EBP2 Terminology domain was poor (ICC = 0.29). The self-reported EBP2 Terminology domain discriminated between levels of EBP exposure.An overall low agreement was found between healthcare students' self-reported and objectively assessed knowledge of EBP terminology. As a measurement tool, the EBP2 Terminology scale may be useful to differentiate between levels of EBP exposure. When using the scale as a discriminatory tool, for the purpose of academic promotion or clinical certification, users should be aware that self-ratings would be higher than objectively assessed knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W2837006178,"Oral tumors, including highly invasive and metastatic oral melanoma (OM), non-tonsillar oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and benign tumors (BN), are common neoplasms in dogs. Although these tumors behave differently, limited data of their protein expression profiles have been exhibited, particularly at the proteome level. The present study aimed to i.) characterize peptide-mass fingerprints (PMFs) and identify potential protein candidates of OM, OSCC, BN and normal control subjects, using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), ii.) identify potential protein candidates associated with the diseases, using in-gel digestion coupled with mass spectrometric analysis (GeLC-MS/MS) and iii.) search for relationships between chemotherapy drugs and disease-perturbed proteins. A distinct cluster of each sample group and unique PMFs with identified protein candidates were revealed. The unique peptide fragment at 2,274 Da of sacsin molecular chaperone (SACS) was observed in early-stage OM whereas the fragment at 1,958 Da of sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 10 (SCN10A) was presented in early- and late-stage OM. The peptide mass at 2,316 Da of Notch1 appeared in early-stage OM and benign oral tumors while the peptide mass at 2,505 Da of glutamate ionotropic receptor N-methyl-D-aspartate type subunit 3A (GRIN3A) was identified in all groups. Markedly expressed proteins from GeLC-MS/MS included Jumonji domain containing 1C (JMJD1C) in benign tumors, inversin (INVS) and rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 28 (ARHGEF28) in OM, BTB domain-containing 16 (BTBD16) in OSCC, and protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 1 (PTPN1), BRCA2, DNA repair associated (BRCA2), WW domain binding protein 2 (WBP2), purinergic receptor P2Y1 and proteasome activator subunit 4 (PSME4) in all cancerous groups. The network connections between these proteins and chemotherapy drugs, cisplatin and doxorubicin, were also demonstrated. In conclusion, this study unveiled the unique PMFs and novel candidate protein markers of canine oral tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2819173637,"Introduction The discrepancy regarding maternal mortality continues to be a health concern between developing and developed countries. The majority of global maternal deaths occur in developing countries, specifically, in the sub-Sahara African region which alone accounts for more than half of these deaths. It has been indicated that utilization of the partograph was significantly associated with improved maternal and neonatal outcomes of labour and that is why the World Health Organization recommends the universal use of the tool during labour. Therefore, this study has assessed the level of partograph use and its associated factors among obstetric caregivers in East Gojam Zone, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A health facility based cross-sectional study was conducted among randomly selected obstetric caregivers in Northwest Ethiopia. The data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire and a clinical observation checklist. The data were entered into Epidata version 3.1, and cleaned and analyzed using SPSS version 24.0 statistical software. Result About three quarters, or 198 (72.53%), of the obstetric caregivers, had attained diploma level of education. However, 153 (56.04%) of the obstetric caregivers had what was considered to be good knowledge about the partograph, but utilization of the tool was slightly lower than their level of knowledge, 147 (53.85%). Utilization of the partograph was significantly higher among obstetric caregivers holding a Bachelor of Science degree and above, than Diploma holders (AOR (95% C.I) 2.07 (1.15–3.75)) and the use was higher among those who were regularly working in the delivery ward compared to those regularly working in the Adult Outpatient Department (AOR (95% C.I): 2.25 (1.07–4.72)). Moreover, caregivers who had a good knowledge about the partograph and who had received on the job training in obstetric care were also more likely to use the partograph during labour and delivery (AOR (95% C.I): 1.79 (1.05–3.06) and 4.85 (2.63–8.96)) respectively. Conclusion The results of this study revealed that although more than half of obstetric caregivers had a good knowledge of the partograph, the actual utilization of the tool was slightly lower than the knowledge they had. Therefore, in this study, we suggest that providing on the job obstetric care training for obstetric caregivers, about the partograph in particular, would improve partograph utilization."
https://openalex.org/W2852898378,"Purpose To assess the potential of histogram metrics of diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI)-derived indices in revealing neurodegeneration and its progression in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). Materials and methods Nine SCA2 patients and 16 age-matched healthy controls, were examined twice (SCA2 patients 3.6±0.7 years and controls 3.3±1.0 years apart) on the same 1.5T scanner by acquiring T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted (b-value = 1000 s/mm2) images. Cerebrum and brainstem-cerebellum regions were segmented using FreeSurfer suite. Histogram analysis of DTI-derived indices, including mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), axial (AD) / radial (RD) diffusivity and mode of anisotropy (MO), was performed. Results At baseline, significant differences between SCA2 patients and controls were confined to brainstem-cerebellum. Median values of MD/AD/RD and FA/MO were significantly (p<0.001) higher and lower, respectively, in SCA2 patients (1.11/1.30/1.03×10−3 mm2/s and 0.14/0.19) than in controls (0.80/1.00/0.70×10−3 mm2/s and 0.20/0.41). Also, peak location values of MD/AD/RD and FA were significantly (p<0.001) higher and lower, respectively, in SCA2 patients (0.91/1.11/0.81×10−3 mm2/s and 0.12) than in controls (0.71/0.91/0.63×10−3 mm2/s and 0.18). Peak height values of FA and MD/AD/RD/MO were significantly (p<0.001) higher and lower, respectively, in SCA2 patients (0.20 and 0.07/0.06/0.07×10−3 mm2/s/year /0.07) than in controls (0.15 and 0.14/0.11/0.12/×10−3 mm2/s/year /0.09). The rate of change of MD median values was significantly (p<0.001) higher (i.e., increased) in SCA2 patients (0.010×10−3 mm2/s/year) than in controls (-0.003×10−3 mm2/s/year) in the brainstem-cerebellum, whereas no significant difference was found for other indices and in the cerebrum. Conclusion Histogram analysis of DTI-derived indices is a relatively straightforward approach which reveals microstructural changes associated with pontocerebellar degeneration in SCA2 and the median value of MD is capable to track its progression."
https://openalex.org/W2846395140,"Introduction: Institute of Medicine gestational weight gain recommendations are based on body mass index (BMI) status using adult cut-off points for women of all ages, even though adolescents have specific criteria, like WHO and CDC, so adolescents can receive inadequate weight gain recommendations. Objectives: To estimate the proportion of classification disparity between the three criteria (WHO, CDC and IOM) of pre-pregnancy BMI status; and to analyze neonatal outcomes according to weight gain recommendation based on pre-pregnancy BMI using the three criteria. Methods: Follow-up study in pregnant adolescents 12–19 years. Sociodemographic, anthropometric and pregnancy data were obtained. Percentage of pre-pregnancy BMI classification disparity was calculated between three criteria. Gestational weight gain was categorized in adequate, low and high according to IOM. Regression models were used to analyze negative neonatal outcomes. Results: 601 pregnant adolescents were included, mean age was 16±1.4 years. For pre-pregnancy BMI classification, 28.5% had classification disparity using IOM vs WHO, and 14% when comparing IOM vs CDC. Greater classification disparity was observed as BMI increased. When using WHO categories, a high weight gain was associated with increased risk of having a low birth weight baby (OR: 1.91, CI95%: 1.03–3.53). For CDC criteria, a low weight gain was associated with increased risk of having a preterm baby (OR: 2.65; CI95%: 1.16–6.08) and a high weight gain was associated with low birth weight (OR: 2.10; CI95%: 1.10–4.01). For IOM criteria, a weight gain either low or high were associated with increased risk of low birth weight and preterm birth. Conclusion: There is pre-pregnancy BMI classification disparity using criteria for adolescents compared to adult criteria. Nevertheless, with WHO and CDC only a high gestational weight gain was a risk for negative neonatal outcome. It is important to have a BMI classification system for adolescents that better predicts neonatal outcomes."

It represents a valuable process simplification in the microbial carbon uptake that could be of potential industrial interest. Biochemical assays revealed a progressive increase in the hydrolysis rates from mannobiose to mannohexaose, which distinguishes XacMan2A from the known GH2 β-mannosidases. Crystallographic analysis indicates that the active-site topology of XacMan2A underwent profound structural changes at the positive-subsite region, by the removal of the physical barrier canonically observed in GH2 β-mannosidases, generating a more open and accessible active site with additional productive positive subsites. Besides that, XacMan2A contains two residue substitutions in relation to typical GH2 β-mannosidases, Gly439 and Gly556, which alter the active site volume and are essential to its mode of action. Interestingly, the only other mechanistically characterized mannose-releasing exo-β-mannanase so far is from the GH5 family, and its mode of action was attributed to the emergence of a blocking loop at the negative-subsite region of a cleft-like active site, whereas in XacMan2A, the same activity can be explained by the removal of steric barriers at the positive-subsite region in an originally pocket-like active site. Therefore, the GH2 exo-β-mannanase represents a distinct molecular route to this rare activity, expanding our knowledge about functional convergence mechanisms in carbohydrate-active enzymes. The classical microbial strategy for depolymerization of β-mannan polysaccharides involves the synergistic action of at least two enzymes, endo-1,4-β-mannanases and β-mannosidases.

https://openalex.org/W2852824123,"The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis is fundamental for mammalian growth and development. However, no comprehensive reference data on gene expression across tissues and pre- and postnatal developmental stages are available for any given species. Here we provide systematic promoter- and splice variant specific information on expression of IGF system components in embryonic (Day 48), fetal (Day 153), term (Day 277, placenta) and juvenile (Day 365–396) tissues of domestic cow, a major agricultural species and biomedical model. Analysis of spatiotemporal changes in expression of IGF1, IGF2, IGF1R, IGF2R, IGFBP1-8 and IR genes, as well as lncRNAs H19 and AIRN, by qPCR, indicated an overall increase in expression from embryo to fetal stage, and decrease in expression from fetal to juvenile stage. The stronger decrease in expression of lncRNAs (average ―16-fold) and ligands (average ―12.1-fold) compared to receptors (average ―5.7-fold) and binding proteins (average ―4.3-fold) is consistent with known functions of IGF peptides and supports important roles of lncRNAs in prenatal development. Pronounced overall reduction in postnatal expression of IGF system components in lung (―12.9-fold) and kidney (―13.2-fold) are signatures of major changes in organ function while more similar hepatic expression levels (―2.2-fold) are evidence of the endocrine rather than autocrine/paracrine role of IGFs in postnatal growth regulation. Despite its rapid growth, placenta displayed a more stable expression pattern than other organs during prenatal development. Quantitative analyses of contributions of promoters P0-P4 to global IGF2 transcript in fetal tissues revealed that P4 accounted for the bulk of transcript in all tissues but skeletal muscle. Demonstration of IGF2 expression in fetal muscle and postnatal liver from a promoter orthologous to mouse and human promoter P0 provides further evidence for an evolutionary and developmental shift from placenta-specific P0-expression in rodents and suggests that some aspects of bovine IGF expression may be closer to human than mouse."

The study was conducted to investigate the association of CRP rs1130864 (1444C/T), IL-6 rs1800795 (-174G/C) and LEPR rs1137101 (Q223R) genes with OSA and NAFLD in Asian Indians residing in North India. Methods 240 overweight/ obese subjects [body mass index (BMI>23kg/m2)], 124 with OSA and with NAFLD (group 1), 47 with OSA without NAFLD (group 2), 44 without OSA and with NAFLD (group 3) and 25 without OSA and without NAFLD (group 4) were recruited in this study. The severity of NAFLD was based on abdomen liver ultrasound and of OSA on overnight polysomnography. Clinical details, anthropometry profile, body composition, biochemical parameters and inflammatory markers were measured. Polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism of CRP, IL-6 and LEPR gene was performed. The associations of these polymorphisms with clinical, anthropometric and biochemical profiles were investigated. The genotypes were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. Results The C, T and R alleles of IL-6, CRP and LEPR genes was more frequent in OSA and NAFLD subjects and significantly correlated with higher protein levels. The prevalence of variant genotypes C/T of CRP, G/C of IL-6 and Q/R of LEPR genes was significantly higher in OSA subjects as compared to non OSA subjects. Further, C/C genotype of IL-6 (G/C), T/T of CRP (C/T) and RR genotype of LEPR (Q/R) was associated with significantly higher BMI, fat mass (kg), % body fat, waist circumference, serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, alkaline phosphate, aspartate transaminase and fasting insulin levels in OSA and NAFLD subjects. Using a multivariate analysis, the combined effect of three polymorphisms of CRP, IL-6 and LEPR gene variants on OSA and NAFLD risk was evaluated. Odds ratio for OSA and NAFLD with the combination of the three gene polymorphisms increased to 2.84 (95% CI: 1.08–6.54; p = 0.04) even when adjusted for sex, age and BMI. Conclusion Polymorphisms of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes were associated with increased risk of OSA and NAFLD in Asian Indians."
https://openalex.org/W2831801564,"Background The Philippine government has an extensive network of 513 Animal Bite Treatment Centers (ABTCs) to supply rabies post exposure prophylaxis (PEP), reaching over 1 million bite victims in 2016. The network was evaluated using a review of existing national and provincial data, key informant interviews and surveys in sample ABTCs to determine the cost-effectiveness of this network in preventing human rabies deaths. Methodology and principal findings One urban and one rural ABTC in each of three selected provinces were studied in more detail. PEP delivery generally followed national guidance based on best practices, but there was evidence of operational challenges in supplying all ABTCs with adequate biologics and recently trained staff. Funding was contributed by different levels of government and in some clinics, patients paid for a significant fraction of the total cost. From a health provider perspective including both fixed and variable costs, the average PEP course delivered cost USD 32.91 /patient across urban ABTCs (with higher patient throughput) and USD 57.21 /patient across rural ABTCs. These costs suggests that PEP provision in the Philippines cost USD 37.6 million in 2016, with a cost per life saved of USD 8,290. An analysis of the 2,239 suspected rabies deaths from 2008 to 2016 showed no significant decline, and from 2014–16 an average of 8,534 years of life were lost annually. The incidence of rabies deaths from 2014–16 was not clearly related to the provision of ABTCs (per 100,000 population) or human population density, but deaths were more common in higher income provinces. Conclusions/Significance In the context of comprehensive rabies control (including dog vaccination and public awareness) ways to reduce this high expenditure on PEP should be explored, to most cost-effectively reach the elimination of human rabies deaths. This paper is accompanied by another containing data on the operation of ABTCs network from a patient perspective."
https://openalex.org/W2838266641,"External acidity induces catecholamine secretion by inhibiting TASK1-like channels in rat adrenal medullary (AM) cells. TASK channels can function as a heteromer or homomer in the TASK subfamily. In this study, we elucidate the molecular identity of TASK1-like channels in mouse AM cells using gene knockout. Genetic deletion of TASK1, but not TASK3, abolished the depolarizing inward current and catecholamine secretion in response to acidity, whereas it did not affect the resting current level. Immunocytochemistry revealed that AM cells exhibited predominantly TASK1-like and little TASK3-like immunoreactivity. A proximity ligation assay showed that TASK1/3 heteromeric channels were not formed in AM cells or PC12 cells. However, the exogenous expression of p11 in PC12 cells resulted in the heteromeric formation of TASK isoforms, which were mainly located in the cytoplasm, and p11 was not expressed in rat adrenal medullae or PC12 cells. In AM cells, genetic deletion of TASK1 resulted in enhancement of the immunoreactivity of the TALK2 channel, but not TASK3. The results indicate that TASK1 homomeric channels function as acidity sensors in AM cells, and that function is facilitated by the lack of p11 expression.—Inoue, M., Matsuoka, H., Lesage, F., Harada, K.

This elementary function is directly based on an elaborated cytoskeletal apparatus establishing a complex network of primary and secondary processes. Here, we identify the actin-bundling protein allograft-inflammatory-inhibitor 1 like (AIF1L) as a selectively expressed podocyte protein in vivo. We describe the distinct subcellular localization of AIF1L to actin stress fibers, focal adhesion complexes and the nuclear compartment of podocytes in vitro. Genetic deletion of AIF1L in immortalized human podocytes resulted in an increased formation of filopodial extensions and decreased actomyosin contractility. By the use of SILAC based quantitative proteomics analysis we describe the podocyte specific AIF1L interactome and identify several components of the actomyosin machinery such as MYL9 and UNC45A as potential AIF1L interaction partners. Together, these findings indicate an involvement of AIF1L in the stabilization of podocyte morphology by titrating actomyosin contractility and membrane dynamics."

Firstly, the close correlation of vehicle gap changes and the host car's behaviors was explored with the measured car-following data. Secondly, the correlation between the host car's velocity and vehicle gap changes with different memory steps was also explored to develop the nth car’s optimal velocity function. Thirdly, a microscopic traffic simulation program was created for analyzing the traffic flow evolution process and approximately estimating the fuel consumptions and exhaust emissions. As a result, it was seen that vehicle gap changes with memory significantly affect fuel economy and emission performance of the simulated traffic flow in the ACC strategy, which can result in low fuel consumptions and exhaust emissions. This study is an incremental step forward for designing the control strategy of the ACC system."
https://openalex.org/W2856241409,"Modern authorship attribution methods are often comprised of powerful yet opaque machine learning algorithms. While much of this work lends itself to concrete outcomes in the form of probability scores, advanced approaches typically preclude deeper insights in the form of psychological interpretation. Additionally, few attribution methods exist for single-candidate authorship problems, most of which require large amounts of supplemental data to perform and none of which rely upon explicitly psychological measures. The current study introduces Mental Profile Mapping, a new authorship attribution technique for single-candidate authorship questions that is founded on previous scientific research pertaining to the nature of language and psychology. In the current study, baseline expectations for results and performance are set using an advanced technique known as ""unmasking"" on the test case of Aphra Behn, a 17th century English playwright. Following this, Mental Profile Mapping is introduced and tested for its psychometric properties, tested using a ""bogus insertion"" method, and then applied to canonical Aphra Behn plays. Results from both attribution methods suggest that 2 of 5 questioned plays are likely to have been authored by Behn, with the remaining 3 plays exhibiting a poor fit for Behn's psychological fingerprint. Mental Profile Mapping results are then decomposed into deeper psychological interpretation, a quality unique to this new method."

In this work, we have described the LMDIPred web server, an online resource for generalized prediction of linear peptide sequences that may bind to three most prevalent and well-studied peptide recognition modules (PRMs)—SH3, WW and PDZ. We have developed support vector machine (SVM)-based prediction models that achieved maximum Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.85 with an accuracy of 94.55% for SH3, MCC of 0.90 with an accuracy of 95.82% for WW, and MCC of 0.83 with an accuracy of 92.29% for PDZ binding peptides. LMDIPred output combines predictions from these SVM models with predictions using Position-Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSMs) and string-matching methods using known domain-binding motif instances and regular expressions. All of these methods were evaluated using a five-fold cross-validation technique on both balanced and unbalanced datasets, and also validated on independent datasets. LMDIPred aims to provide a preliminary bioinformatics platform for sequence-based prediction of probable binding sites for SH3, WW or PDZ domains."

We used multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analyses to assess the association of gout with incident AMD, adjusted for demographics, comorbidity, and use of medications for cardiovascular disease and gout. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results In this observational cohort study, of the 1,684,314 eligible people, 116,097 developed incident AMD (6.9%). Incidence rates of AMD per 1,000 person-years were 20.1 for people with gout and 11.7 for people without gout. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, a diagnosis of gout was significantly associated with a higher risk of incident AMD with a hazard ratio of 1.39 (95% CI, 1.35, 1.43). This association was confirmed in sensitivity analyses that substituted Charlson-Romano comorbidity index continuous score with either a categorical Charlson-Romano comorbidity index score or individual Charlson-Romano index comorbidities plus hypertension, hyperlipidemia and coronary artery disease. Other covariates significantly associated with higher hazards of incident AMD were older age, female gender, White race/ethnicity, and higher Charlson-Romano comorbidity index score. Conclusions We noted a novel association of gout with AMD in the elderly. Future studies should investigate the pathways that mediate this association."

The presence of collagen and the ability to undergo physicochemical modifications render these materials a suitable alternative in bone regenerative therapies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the osteogenic capacity of collagen-based matrices (native and anionic after alkaline hydrolysis) made from bovine intestinal serosa (MBIS). Twenty-five animals underwent surgery to create a cranial defect to be filled with native and anionic collagen matrixes, mmineralized and non mineralized. The animals were killed painlessly 6 weeks after surgery and samples of the wound area were submitted to routine histology and morphometric analysis. In the surgical area there was new bone formation projecting from the margins to the center of the defect. More marked bone neoformation occurred in the anionic matrices groups in such a way that permitted union of the opposite margins of the bone defect. The newly formed bone matrix exhibited good optical density of type I collagen fibers. Immunoexpression of osteocalcin by osteocytes was observed in the newly formed bone. Morphometric analysis showed a greater bone volume in the groups receiving the anionic matrices compared to the native membranes. Mineralization of the biomaterial did not increase its osteoregenerative capacity. In conclusion, the anionic matrix exhibits osteoregenerative capacity and is suitable for bone reconstruction therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2845508803,"Objectives Data obtained mostly from animal models and ex vivo samples show that a small portion of ultraviolet light (UV, 300–400 nm) penetrates the cornea and crystalline lens and impinges on the human retina. UV transmission to the retina appears to be unique to the young and some older pseudophakes. In this study, we determine the variation in UV transmission in a relatively homogenous sample of young adults. Methods 42 subjects were tested (M = 19 ± 1.3 years). Absolute thresholds to UV radiation were collected (λmax = 315 nm, 305–325). Macular pigment optical density (MPOD, measured using heterochromatic flicker photometry) and iris color (using a standardized color scale) were also assessed as potential covariates. Results All of the subjects could detect UV radiation at 315 nm but individual variation was large (over a factor of 30). Higher MPOD and darker iridies were not related to UV sensitivity in this young sample. Males, however, were more sensitive to UV than the females (p<0.05). Conclusions The large individual differences in UV reaching the retina of younger individuals suggests equally significant vulnerability to the actinic effects of this highly energetic light."

Dual energy CT (DECT) can support assessment of pulmonary emboli (PE) by providing vessel reconstructions (DECT-VR) and highlighting thrombi. Purpose was to determine prevalence and risk factors of PE in staging examinations of stage IV-melanoma patients and to evaluate the potential of DECT-VR to improve PE diagnosis. Material and methods This retrospective study was approved by IRB. Contrast-enhanced, conventional grey scale CT (cCT) and DECT-VR of 200 stage IV-melanoma patients were reviewed by three radiologists in consensus. Overall prevalence was determined. One-sided Wilcoxon-test was performed to compare the number of detected emboli between cCT and cCT with supplementary DECT-VR. Frequencies of risk factors were compared with χ2 test. Results On cCT, 9 PE were detected (6 patients, correlating to 3% of the study population with 0.05 emboli per patient). With the supplementary DECT-VR, number of diagnosed emboli increased from 9 to 17 (p < 0.05) (in total 9 patients, correlating to 0.09 emboli per patient). Emboli on DECT-VR were mainly subsegmentally (7 of 8). There was no significant difference in the frequency of risk factors. Conclusions The prevalence of pulmonary emboli in our cohort of 200 stage IV melanoma patients was 5%. DECT-VR improved significantly diagnosis of PE, especially when located subsegmentally."
https://openalex.org/W2765948598,"Longevity has long been recognised as a key facilitator of reciprocal altruism because repeated cooperation of partners hinges on mutual survival. Although demographic tools can be used to quantify mutual survival and expected overlapping lifespans, studies on the evolutionary theory of cooperation take only limited advantage of demography. Overlap of lifespans depends on variation in survival across ages and can be high or low independently of high or low life expectancies. Here we develop formal demographic measures to study the complex relationships between shared life expectancy of two birth cohort peers, the proportion of their lives that they can expect to overlap, and longevity. We simulate age-specific mortality schedules using a Siler model to reveal how infant and senescent mortality, along with age-independent mortality, affect the relationship between the proportion of life shared and life expectancy. We find that while the proportion of life shared can vary vastly for similar life expectancies, almost all changes to mortality schedules that result in higher life expectancies also result in higher proportions of life shared. A distinct exception occurs if life expectancy increases due to lowering the rate of senescence. In this case the proportion of life shared decreases. Our work shows that almost all selective pressures that result in higher life expectancies also result in a larger proportion of life shared. Therefore, selective forces that extend life also improve the chances that a cooperative system would be stable in terms of reciprocal interactions. Since reciprocal interactions may also reduce mortality and result in a feedback loop with the evolution of longevity, our measures and findings can be used for future cross-species comparisons that aim to disentangle predecessor and successor in the evolution of longevity and cooperation."

Inhibition of the ATR/Chk1 pathway has been shown to be synthetically lethal in cells with high levels of oncogene-induced replication stress and in p53- or ATM- deficient cells. In the presented study, we aimed to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying radiosensitization of T-lymphocyte leukemic MOLT-4 cells by VE-821, a higly potent and specific inhibitor of ATR. We combined multiple approaches: cell biology techniques to reveal the inhibitor-induced phenotypes, and quantitative proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and metabolomics to comprehensively describe drug-induced changes in irradiated cells. VE-821 radiosensitized MOLT-4 cells, and furthermore 10 μM VE-821 significantly affected proliferation of sham-irradiated MOLT-4 cells. We detected 623 differentially regulated phosphorylation sites. We revealed changes not only in DDR-related pathways and kinases, but also in pathways and kinases involved in maintaining cellular metabolism. Notably, we found downregulation of mTOR, the main regulator of cellular metabolism, which was most likely caused by an off-target effect of the inhibitor, and we propose that mTOR inhibition could be one of the factors contributing to the phenotype observed after treating MOLT-4 cells with 10 μM VE-821. In the metabolomic analysis, 206 intermediary metabolites were detected. The data indicated that VE-821 potentiated metabolic disruption induced by irradiation and affected the response to irradiation-induced oxidative stress. Upon irradiation, recovery of damaged deoxynucleotides might be affected by VE-821, hampering DNA repair by their deficiency. Taken together, this is the first study describing a complex scenario of cellular events that might be ATR-dependent or triggered by ATR inhibition in irradiated MOLT-4 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2830393709,"The enzyme endo-inulinase hydrolyzes inulin to short chain fructooligosaccharides (FOS) that are potential prebiotics with many health promoting benefits. Although the raw materials for inulin production are inexpensive and readily available, commercial production of FOS from inulin is limited due to inadequate availability of the enzyme source. This study aimed to identify the fungi capable of producing endo-inulinase based on the in silico analysis of proteins retrieved from non-redundant protein sequence database. The endo-inulinase of Aspergillus ficuum was used as reference sequence. The amino acid sequences with >90% sequence coverage, belonging to different fungi were retrieved from the database and used for constructing three-dimensional (3D) protein models using SWISS-MODEL and Bagheerath H. The 3D models of comparable quality as that of the reference endo-inulinase were selected based on QMEAN Z score. The selected models were evaluated and validated for different structural and functional qualities using Pro-Q, ProSA, PSN-QA, VERIFY-3D, PROCHECK, PROTSAV metaserver, STRAP, molecular docking, and molecular dynamic simulation analyses. A total of 230 proteins belonging to 53 fungal species exhibited sequence coverage >90%. Sixty one protein sequences with >60% sequence identity were modeled as endo-inulinase with higher QMEAN Z Score. The evaluations and validations of these 61 selected models for different structural and functional qualities revealed that 60 models belonging to 22 fungal species exhibited native like structure and unique motifs and residues as that of the reference endo-inulinase. Further, these models also exhibited similar kind of interaction between the active site around the conserved glutamate residue and substrate as that of the reference endo-inulinase. In conclusion, based on the current study, 22 fungal species could be identified as endo-inulinase producer. Nevertheless, further biological assessment of their capability for producing endo-inulinase is imminent if they are to be used for commercial endo-inulinase production for application in FOS industry."

Identifying illegal behaviour, specifically fishing and at-sea transhipment, continues to be a fundamental hurdle in combating IUU fishing. Here, we explore the use of spatial statistical methods to identify vessels behaving anomalously, in particular with regard to loitering, using the Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and surrounding waters as a case-study. Using Automatic Identification System (AIS) for vessel tracking, we applied Generalized Additive Models to capture both the temporal and spatial nature of loitering behaviour. We identified three statistically anomalous loitering behaviours (based on time, speed and distance) and applied the models to 2700 vessels in the region. We were able to rank vessels for individual and joint probability of atypical behaviour, providing a hierarchical list of vessels engaging in anomalous behaviour. While identification of irregular behaviour does not mean vessels are definitely engaging in illegal activities, this statistical modelling approach can be used to prioritise the allocation of enforcement resources and assist authorities under the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization Port State Measures Agreement for management and enforcement of IUU fishing associated activities."

https://openalex.org/W2853262946,"Precision cancer therapy requires on the one hand detailed knowledge about a tumor's driver oncogenes and on the other hand an effective targeted therapy that specifically inhibits these oncogenes. While the determination of genomic landscape of a tumor has reached a very precise level, the respective therapy options are scarce. The application of small inhibitory (si) RNAs is a promising field of investigation. Here, we present the effective in vivo-treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) xenograft tumors with antibody-complexed, endoribonuclease-prepared small inhibitory (esi)RNAs. We chose heterogeneous endoribonuclease-prepared siRNA pools (esiRNAs) against the frequently mutated genes PIK3CA and KRAS and coupled them to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab, which was internalized specifically into the tumor cells. esiRNA pools have been shown to exhibit superior specificity in target gene knockdown compared to classic siRNAs. We identified a significant decrease in tumor growth upon this treatment due to decreased tumor cell proliferation. The ex vivo-analysis of the xenograft CRC tumors revealed the expected downregulation of the intended direct targets PIK3CA and KRAS on protein level. Moreover, known downstream targets for EGFR signaling such as p-ERK, p-AKT, and c-MYC were decreased as well. We therefore propose the use of antibody-esiRNA complexes as a novel experimental treatment option against key components of the EGFR signaling cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2950847761,"Toxoplasma, a protozoan parasite of cats, infects many species of intermediate and paratenic hosts, including about one-third of humans worldwide. After a short phase of acute infection, the tissue cysts containing slowly dividing bradyzoites are formed in various organs and toxoplasmosis proceeds spontaneously in its latent form. In immunocompetent subjects, latent toxoplasmosis was considered asymptomatic. However, dozens of studies performed on animals and humans in the past twenty years have shown that it is accompanied by a broad spectrum of specific behavioural, physiological and even morphological changes. In human hosts, the changes often go in the opposite direction in men and women, and are mostly weaker or non-existent in Rh-positive subjects.Here, we searched for the indices of lower endurance of the infected subjects by examining the performance of nearly five hundred university students tested for toxoplasmosis and Rh phenotype in two tests, a weight holding test and a grip test.The results confirmed the existence of a negative association of latent toxoplasmosis with the performance of students, especially Rh-negative men, in these tests. Surprisingly, but in an accordance with some already published data, Toxoplasma-infected, Rh-positive subjects expressed a higher, rather than lower, performance in our endurance tests.Therefore, the results only partly support the hypothesis for the lower endurance of Toxoplasma infected subjects as the performance of Rh-positive subjects (representing majority of population) correlated positively with the Toxoplasma infection."
https://openalex.org/W2833981815,"The current psychology literature defines flourishing as leading an authentic life that directs one towards the highest levels of both feeling good and functioning well. Numerous studies show that flourishing relates to a wide array of advantageous personal outcomes. However, the same literature says very little about the social outcomes of flourishing, even though an individual’s pursuit of well-being does not happen in isolation of others. With the present research, we seek to address this void. Specifically, we argue that flourishing, in its psychological conceptualization, does not provide strong moral guidance. As such, flourishing is amoral when it comes to social outcomes such as prosocial behaviors. Drawing on social learning theory, we argue that flourishers’ prosociality is at least somewhat contingent on the moral guidance of their society. To assess this, we tested society’s corruption level as a moderator in the relation between flourishing and prosocial behavior. To that end, we conducted two studies using data from the European Social Survey (ESS), which were collected in 2006 (N1 = 50,504) from 23 countries and in 2012 (N2 = 56,835) from 29 countries. We generally find that corruption at the national level moderates the relation between flourishing and prosocial behaviors (i.e., helping close/distant others, charitable activities). Overall, our study suggests that moral guidance should factor into discussions about flourishing."

In tissue samples, cell type-specific responses can be masked in expression data due to mixed cell populations which can preclude biomarker discovery. In this study, we deconvolved microarray data from thyroid tissue in order to assess possible bias from mixed cell type data. Transcript expression data [GSE66303] from mouse thyroid that received 5.9 Gy from 131I over 24 h (or 0 Gy from mock treatment) were deconvolved by cell frequency of follicular cells and C-cells using csSAM and R and processed with Nexus Expression. Literature-based signature genes were used to assess the relative impact from ionizing radiation (IR) or thyroid hormones (TH). Regulation of cellular functions was inferred by enriched biological processes according to Gene Ontology terms. We found that deconvolution increased the detection rate of significantly regulated transcripts including the biomarker candidate family of kallikrein transcripts. Detection of IR-associated and TH-responding signature genes was also increased in deconvolved data, while the dominating trend of TH-responding genes was reproduced. Importantly, responses in biological processes for DNA integrity, gene expression integrity, and cellular stress were not detected in convoluted data-which was in disagreement with expected dose-response relationships-but upon deconvolution in follicular cells and C-cells. In conclusion, previously reported trends of 131I-induced transcriptional responses in thyroid were reproduced with deconvolved data and usually with a higher detection rate. Deconvolution also resolved an issue with detecting damage and stress responses in enriched data, and may reduce false negatives in other contexts as well. These findings indicate that deconvolution can optimize microarray data analysis of heterogeneous sample material for biomarker screening or other clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2873646461,"Macrodactyly is a congenital malformation characterized by aggressive overgrowth of multiple tissues, including subcutaneous fat, nerves, and bones in digits or limbs. In type II macrodactyly, the peripheral nerve is enlarged; however, the morphological and functional characteristics of the affected peripheral nerves have rarely been evaluated.In this research, six macrodactyly patients and three polydactyly patients (control) were studied. Pre-operative sensory nerve action potential and intra-operative nerve action potential tests were performed. The microstructure and ultrastructure of the enlarged nerves were observed and neurofilament (NF) expression was evaluated using immunofluorescent staining.Axon impairment of the digital nerves originating from the median nerve (MN) was observed. A compensatory reinnervation from the ulnar nerve (UN) was found in two of the six patients, and significant morphological changes were observed in the enlarged nerve. The myelinated nerve fibers decreased, the lamellar structure of the myelin sheath changed, and the density of the NFs of the unmyelinated fibers decreased. There was aberrant distribution of NFs in the macrodactylous nerve tissues. In patients with compensatory UN reinnervation, the number of myelinated and unmyelinated fibers increased to normal levels; however, the diameter of the myelinated fibers apparently decreased.The morphology and function of the macrodactylous enlarged nerve was impaired in type II macrodactyly patients; however, the unaffected UN partially compensated for the lost function of the affected MN under specific situations. Electrophysiological tests should be performed to determine the function of the affected nerve and surgical treatment for type II macrodactyly could be refined."
https://openalex.org/W2876164497,"Screening in the average risk population for colorectal cancer (CRC) is expected to reduce the incidence of distant (i.e., metastatic) CRCs at least as much as less advanced CRCs. Indeed, since 2000, during which time colonoscopy became widely used as a screening tool, the overall incidence of CRC has been reduced by 29%.The purpose of the current study was to determine whether the reduction of incidence rates is the same for all stages of disease.We evaluated incidence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program from 2000-2014 for Localized, Regional, and Distant disease. Joinpoint models were compared to assess parallelism of trends. Data were stratified by race, age, tumor location, and sex to determine whether these subgroupings could explain overall trends.Inconsistent with the expectations of a successful screening program, the reduction in incidence rates of distant CRCs from 2000-2014 has been slower than the reductions in incidence rates of both regional and localized CRCs. This trend is evident even when the data are stratified by age at diagnosis, sex, race, or tumor location.The slower decrease in the incidence rate of distant disease is not consistent with a screening effect, that is, CRC screening may not be effective in preventing many distant CRCs. As a consequence, distant CRCs represent an increasing fraction of all CRCs, accounting for 21% of all CRCs in 2014. The analysis indicates that inadequate screening does not explain the slower decrease in incidence of distant CRCs. Consequently, we suggest that a subtype of CRC exists that advances rapidly, evading detection because screening intervals are too long to prevent it. Microsatellite unstable tumors represent a known subtype that advances more rapidly, and we suggest that another rapidly advancing subtype very likely exists that is microsatellite stable."
https://openalex.org/W2815121714,"The objective of the current study was to determine the test-retest reliability of heel-to-toe progression measures in the stance phase of gait using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analysis. It has been proposed that heel-to-toe progression could be used as a functional measure of ankle muscle contracture/weakness in clinical populations. This was the first study to investigate the test-retest reliability of this measure. Eighteen healthy subjects walked over the GAITRite® mat three times at a comfortable speed on two sessions (≥ 48 hours apart). The reliability of the heel-to-toe progression measures; heel-contact time, mid-stance time and propulsive time were assessed. Also assessed were basic temporal-spatial parameters; velocity, cadence, stride length, step length, stride width, single and double leg support time. Reliability was determined using the ICC(3,1) model and, fixed and proportional biases, and measures of variability were assessed. Basic gait temporal-spatial parameters were not different between sessions (p > 0.05) and had excellent reliability (ICC(3,1) range: 0.871-0.953) indicating that subjects walked similarly between sessions. Measurement of heel-to-toe progression variables were not different between sessions (p > 0.05) and had excellent reliability (ICC(3,1) range: 0.845-0.926). However, these were less precise and more variable than the measurement of standard temporal-spatial gait variables. As the current study was performed on healthy populations, it represents the 'best case' scenario. The increased variability and reduced precision of heel-to-toe progression measurements should be considered if being used in clinical populations."
https://openalex.org/W2821473221,"Young and old adults estimated the results of multidigit multiplication problems relative to a reference number. Old adults were slower but slightly more accurate than young adults. They were less affected by the distance between the reference number and the exact answer than the young adults. The same strategies reported by past research-the approximated calculation strategy and the sense of magnitude strategy-were found here. The old adults showed a stronger preference toward the approximated calculation strategy than the young ones, and this probably led to the reduced effect of distance. These patterns are interpreted as reflecting two factors. The first is the extensive experience of the old adults with mental calculation, and the second is the decline in processing speed and in working memory resources with adulthood. The former is responsible for the more frequent use of the approximated calculation strategy and for the higher accuracy of the old adults, while the latter is responsible for their slower responses."
https://openalex.org/W2866595097,"Jatropha (Jatropha curcas) has become one of the most important species for producing biofuels. Currently, Genotype x Environment (GxE) interaction is the biggest challenge that breeders should solve to increase the section accuracy in the plant breeding. Therefore, the objectives in this study were to estimate the parameters in the 180 half-sib families in Jatropha evaluated for five production years, to verify the significance of the GxE interaction variance, to evaluate the adaptability and stability for each family based on three prediction methods, to select superior half-sib families based on the adaptability and stability analyses, and to predict the accuracy for the sixth production year. Jatropha half-sib families were classified and selected using the follow adaptability and stability methods: linear regression, bi-segmented linear regression and mixed models concepts called harmonic mean of the relative performance of genetic values (HMRPGV). The prediction accuracy was estimated by the Pearson correlation between the predicted genetic values by adaptability and stability methods and the phenotypic value in the sixth production year. In result, most half-sib families were classified as general adaptability and general stability for the evaluated traits. The selection gain obtained via HMRPGV was higher than other methods. The prediction accuracy for the sixth production year was 0.45. Therefore, HMRPGV is efficient to maximize the genetic gain, and it can be a useful strategy to select genotype with high adaptability and stability in Jatropha breeding as well as other species that should be evaluated for many years to take a suitable selection accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2842931346,"Background In adults, arterial stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV) is regarded as a predictor of cardiovascular disease. Infant vascular development depends on factors related to pregnancy, including maternal blood pressure (BP). This study assessed the association between maternal BP in pregnancy and infant brachio-femoral PWV at age 2–6 weeks. Methods The Baby Vascular health and Iron in Pregnancy (Baby VIP) study is a birth cohort which measured PWV and heart rate (HR) in 284 babies in Leeds, UK, at 2–6 weeks after birth. Maternal BP measurements at 12 and 36 weeks gestation was collected from antenatal clinical records. Multivariable linear regression models assessed associations between maternal systolic and diastolic BPs, and BP change from booking to 36 weeks, with infant PWV adjusting for covariables at both mother and baby level. Results There was no evidence of an association between infant PWV and maternal systolic BP at booking (adjusted regression coefficient -0.01 m/s per 10mmHg, 95% CI -0.11, 0.14, p = 0.84) or at 36 weeks (adjusted regression coefficient 0.00 m/s per 10mmHg, 95% CI -0.12, 0.11, p = 0.95). Change between 12 and 36 weeks gestation of more than 30 mmHg in systolic BP or 15 mmHg in diastolic BP was also not associated with infant PWV. There was an inverse relationship between infant HR and infant PWV (regression coefficient -0.14 m/s per 10 bpm, 95% CI -0.22, -0.05, p<0.01). Conclusions This study has shown no evidence of association between infant PWV at 2–6 weeks of age and maternal BP in early or late pregnancy. Infant HR was inversely associated with infant PWV. Further studies are required to determine the predictors of infant PWV as well as the importance and long term implications of PWV measurements in infants."
https://openalex.org/W2767618708,"Often derived from partial correlations or many pairwise analyses, covariance networks represent the inter-relationships among regions and can reveal important topological structures in brain measures from healthy and pathological subjects. However both approaches are not consistent network estimators and are sensitive to the value of the tuning parameters. Here, we propose a consistent covariance network estimator by maximising the network likelihood (MNL) which is robust to the tuning parameter. We validate the consistency of our algorithm theoretically and via a simulation study, and contrast these results against two well-known approaches: the graphical LASSO (gLASSO) and Pearson pairwise correlations (PPC) over a range of tuning parameters. The MNL algorithm had a specificity equal to and greater than 0.94 for all sample sizes in the simulation study, and the sensitivity was shown to increase as the sample size increased. The gLASSO and PPC demonstrated a specificity-sensitivity trade-off over a range of values of tuning parameters highlighting the discrepancy in the results for misspecified values. Application of the MNL algorithm to the case study data showed a loss of connections between healthy and impaired groups, and improved ability to identify between lobe connectivity in contrast to gLASSO networks. In this work, we propose the MNL algorithm as an effective approach to find covariance brain networks, which can inform the organisational features in brain-wide analyses, particularly for large sample sizes."
https://openalex.org/W2821960699,In this paper we calculate the global phase diagrams with the closed-loop behavior for the phase transition of physical systems by means of the transverse field Ising model with nearest neighbor interaction. The 3D graph plotted by the various physical parameters gives a clear appreciation and qualitative understanding of the reentrant phase behavior of the system. Meanwhile the results show the close correlation between experimental phenomena and our theoretical calculation for the closed-loop behavior for the phase transition of the systems.
https://openalex.org/W2868192478,"Knowledge or rule-based approaches are needed for quality assessment and assurance in professional or crowdsourced geographic data. Nevertheless, many types of geographic knowledge are statistical in nature and are therefore difficult to derive rules that are meaningful for this purpose. The rules of continuity and symmetry considered in this paper can be thought of as two concrete forms of the first law of geography, which may be used to formulate quality measures at the individual level without referring to ground truth. It is not clear, however, how much the rules can be faithful. Hence, the main objective is to test if the rules are consistent with street network data over the world. Specifically, for the rule of continuity we identify natural streets that connect smoothly in a network, and measure the spatial order of information (e.g. names, highway level, speed, etc.) along the streets. The measure is based on spatial auto-correlation indicators adapted for one dimension. For the rule of symmetry, we device an algorithm that recognize parallel road pairs (e.g. dual carriageways), and examine to what extent attributes in the pairs are identical. The two rules are tested against 28 cities selected from OpenStreetMap data worldwide; two professional data sets are used to show more insights. We found that the rules are consistent with street networks from a wide range of cities of different characteristics, and also noted cases with varying degrees of agreement. As a side-effect, we discussed possible limitations of the autocorrelation indicators used, where cautions are needed when interpreting the results. In addition, we present techniques that performed the tests automatically, which can be applied to new data to further verify (or falsify) our findings, or extended as quality assurance tools to detect data items that do not satisfy the rules and to suggest possible corrections according to the rules."
