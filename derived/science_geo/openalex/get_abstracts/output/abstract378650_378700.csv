https://openalex.org/W1997668534,"THE Faraday Society held a two-day meeting in Oxford during September 23–25 to discuss “The Labile Molecule”, or the quantitative aspects of free radical chemistry. The nature of the discussion seemed commonplace enough, and the tremendous activity in this field of chemistry is almost taken for granted. If we neglect the war years—and that is not quite justified—the subject seems to have grown up in about five scientific years, from a rather tentative qualitative notion to a subject of considerable precision requiring for its practice a wide variety of advanced techniques."

https://openalex.org/W2026954376,"OSMOTIC and volume regulation have been studied in the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris by many investigators, but no very convincing evidence has been presented regarding the part played by the nephridia. Overton1 observed an initial loss of weight on handling the worm, and attributed this to the expulsion of fluid through the nephridiopores; but Adolf2 failed to confirm this and concluded that there was “no evidence that the nephridia are at all concerned in the water exchange of earthworms”. Since then, Maluf3 has confirmed Overton's observation and has brought indirect evidence to suggest that the urine is hypotonic to the body fluids. Still more recently, Bahl4, working on Pheretima, collected urine by draining from forty to fifty worms in a glass vessel, and showed that the fluid obtained in this way was hypotonic to the lomic fluid."

https://openalex.org/W2986673659,"O'Day has pointed out1 that his histological preparations provide definite evidence for the presence of cones in the retina of the guinea pig. I welcome this statement, although I have myself, as he indicated, relied on authors who have denied it. Occasionally one finds evidence for red modulators in the eye of the guinea pig (see, for example, Fig. 140, p. 281, of my recent summary2). Such modulators, I maintain, should be ascribed to cones if the histological differentiation of the cells into rods and cones is going to mean anything at all to retinal physiology. There are more of them in the eye of the rat. Since, however, some histologists deny the presence of cones in the eye of the rat (see ref. 2), and others refuse to accept them in the guinea pig, the physiologist must try to stand on his own feet."

https://openalex.org/W2983650739,"The meaning of the word ‘dialysate’ as defined in the Oxford Dictionary is indeed apt to induce mental confusion. It did so recently in my own mind, when I had to struggle through an American patent specification, in which the term was actually used in its Oxford Dictionary sense. In my opinion, as well as in that of my collaborators, Dr. Pirie is quite right, and his discussion1 supports our decision to use the term ‘dialysate’ for the part which dialyses through the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2985841345,"PROF. WOOD JONES' theory of human evolution based on the premaxillary bone is, of course, well known1. It depends on his assumption that it is legitimate to infer the phylogenetic antiquity of a morphological character by noting the time of its ontogenetic appearance. However, attention is invited to Ashley-Montagu's comprehensive study on the premaxilla of the primates2, in which the author reports that the apical portion of the premaxilla may in some cases be observed on the facial aspect of the late fÅ""tal and infant human skull, quite clearly separated from the maxilla by a distinct suture. I have recently had the opportunity of studying the original fossil Australopithecine material in South Africa, and gave particular consideration to the architecture of the upper jaw. There appeared to be no feature here which contradicts the conclusions put forward by Prof. R. A. Dart and Dr. R. Broom that the Australopithecinæ do indeed give very important information regarding the primate forms which were ancestral to Homo."
