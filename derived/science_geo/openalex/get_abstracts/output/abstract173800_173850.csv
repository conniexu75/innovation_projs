We have shown that a major mechanism for storage of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in bone ECM is via its association with latent TGF-β-binding protein-1 (LTBP1). Although proteolytic cleavage of LTBP1 has been reported, it remains unclear whether this represents a physiological mechanism for release of matrix-bound TGF-β. Here we examined the role of LTBP1 in cell-mediated release of TGF-β from bone ECM. We first characterized the soluble and ECM-bound forms of latent TGF-β produced by primary osteoblasts. Next, we examined release of ECM-bound TGF-β by bone resorbing cells. Isolated avian osteoclasts and rabbit bone marrow-derived osteoclasts released bone matrix-bound TGF-β via LTBP1 cleavage. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 enhanced LTBP1 cleavage, resulting in release of 90% of the ECM-bound LTBP1. In contrast, osteoblasts failed to cleave LTBP1 or release TGF-β from bone ECM. Cleavage of LTBP1 by avian osteoclasts was inhibited by serine protease and metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors. Studies using purified proteases showed that plasmin, elastase, MMP2, and MMP9 were able to cleave LTBP1 to produce 125–165-kDa fragments. These studies identify LTBP1 as a novel substrate for MMPs and provide the first demonstration that LTBP1 proteolysis may be a physiological mechanism for release of TGF-β from ECM-bound stores, potentially the first step in the pathway by which matrix-bound TGF-β is rendered active.

It has long been thought that growth factors released from bone matrix play important roles in the coupling of bone resorption to bone formation and in repair processes such as fracture healing. However, at present little is known about the mechanisms by which growth factors are stored in the ECM, the ECM proteins with which they interact, or the molecular mechanisms by which they are released. Bone ECM is the major storage site in the body for TGF-β (2Hauschka P.V. Mavrakos A.E. Lafrati S.E. Doleman S.E. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12665-12674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Seyedin S.M. Thomas T.C. Thompson A.Y. Rosen D.M. Piez K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). This ECM-bound TGF-β, which is predominantly the TGF-β1 isoform, is stored in a latent form and can be released and activated by resorbing osteoclasts (4Pfeilschifter J. Mundy G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2024-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Once released from the matrix and activated, TGF-β can influence many of the steps in the remodeling pathway, including inhibition of osteoclast formation and activity, stimulation of recruitment and proliferation of osteoblast precursors, and stimulation of mature osteoblasts to produce bone matrix proteins (reviewed in Ref.5Bonewald L.F. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1999; 9: 33-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β has therefore been implicated as a coupling factor that coordinates the processes of bone resorption and subsequent bone formation. Although it is known that bone matrix-bound TGF-β can be released by osteoclasts (4Pfeilschifter J. Mundy G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2024-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) and that osteoclasts are capable of activating both matrix-derived and exogenously added latent TGF-β (6Oreffo R.O.C. Mundy G.R.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism(s) by which TGF-β is released from ECM-bound stores remain unclear. We have shown previously (9Dallas S.L. Miyazono K. Skerry T.M. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 10Dallas S.L. Keene D.R. Bruder S.P. Saharinen J. Sakai L.Y. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 68-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) that a major mechanism for storage of latent TGF-β in bone matrix is via its association with the latent transforming growth factor-β-binding protein-1 (LTBP1). LTBP1 is a member of an emerging superfamily of ECM proteins, which includes fibrillins 1 and 2 and LTBPs 1–4 (reviewed in Refs. 11Sinha S. Nevett C. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 529-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar and 12Saharinen J. Hyytiainen M. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). LTBP1 was originally identified as a component of the large latent TGF-β1 complex (13Kanzaki T. Olofsson A. Morén A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Miyazono K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Cell. 1990; 61: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 14Tsuji T. Okada F. Yamaguchi K. Nakamura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8835-8839Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This complex consists of the 25-kDa mature TGF-β homodimer, which is cleaved from but remains non-covalently associated with a 75-kDa portion of the propeptide homodimer (also known as latency-associated peptide or LAP). The propeptide is then disulfide-linked to the 190-kDa LTBP1 (13Kanzaki T. Olofsson A. Morén A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Miyazono K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Cell. 1990; 61: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 15Saharinen J. Keski-Oja J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2691-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Although most cells produce latent TGF-β in the large latent complex, a small latent complex that lacks LTBP1 and consists of TGF-β non-covalently associated with its propeptide has also been reported as a naturally occurring form in bone and kidney (5Bonewald L.F. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1999; 9: 33-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bonewald L.F. Wakefield L. Oreffo R.O.C. Escobedo A. Twardzik D.R. Mundy G.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). LTBP1 facilitates secretion of latent TGF-β (17Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and may also modulate activation of latent TGF-β (18Flaumenhaft R. Abe M. Sato Y. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 995-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). More recently it has been described as a stable component of the extracellular matrix that is important in storage of latent TGF-β in the matrix and may be a structural component of connective tissue microfibrils (9Dallas S.L. Miyazono K. Skerry T.M. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 10Dallas S.L. Keene D.R. Bruder S.P. Saharinen J. Sakai L.Y. Mundy G.R.

Cytochem. 1996; 44: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested that in addition to its role in storage of latent TGF-β in the ECM, LTBP1 may function as a vehicle for release of latent TGF-β from matrix-bound stores. Thus, purified proteases, such as plasmin and elastase, have been shown to release TGF-β from the matrix of fibroblasts and osteoblasts via cleavage of LTBP1 (9Dallas S.L. Miyazono K. Skerry T.M. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 21Taipale J. Lohi J. Saharinen J. Kovanen P.T. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4689-4696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether this is a phenomenon associated with pathologically high concentrations of proteases or whether proteolytic cleavage of LTBP1 represents a true physiologic mechanism for release of ECM-bound TGF-β. In the present study, we characterized the forms of latent TGF-β produced by primary bone cells and stored in the ECM. Next, by using osteoclast cell culture systems we investigated the molecular mechanism(s) by which TGF-β is released from bone ECM-bound stores during bone resorption. In particular, we examined whether proteolytic cleavage of LTBP1 may be a potential cellular mechanism for the release of TGF-β bound to bone ECM, and we determined whether proteases known to be important in osteoclast function may be involved in this process. Plasmin, elastase, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and E64 were purchased from Sigma. Matrix metalloproteinases (active MMP2 and MMP9) and the tissue inhibitor of the matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP1) were purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25-D3) was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) was purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Two different rabbit polyclonal antibodies against LTBP1 were used: Ab39 that recognizes mouse, rat, and human LTBP1 (kindly supplied by K. Miyazono, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan), and a second antibody, termed the “LTBP1 hinge antibody,” raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 721–744 of the rat LTBP1 sequence (GenBankTMaccession number M55431) that recognizes mouse and rat LTBP1. The specificity of these antibodies has been described elsewhere (10Dallas S.L. Keene D.R. Bruder S.P. Saharinen J. Sakai L.Y. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner.

Cytochem. 1996; 44: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A mouse monoclonal antibody against human LTBP1, as well as neutralizing antibodies to TGF-β1 and -β2, a pan-specific TGF-β-neutralizing antibody, and a goat polyclonal antibody against latent TGF-β1 propeptide were purchased from R & D systems (Minneapolis, MN). The detection antibody for Western blotting was a peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences). Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen or JRH Biosciences (Lenexa, KS). Fetal rat calvarial osteoblasts (FRC) were isolated as described previously (9Dallas S.L. Miyazono K. Skerry T.M. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 10Dallas S.L. Keene D.R. Bruder S.P. Saharinen J. Sakai L.Y. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 68-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The cells were stored for up to 1 year using standard cryopreservation procedures and used for experiments after one further passage. UMR-106 cells were a gift from T. J. Martin (St. Vincent Institute of Medical Research, Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia). TMLC-C32 cells were a gift from D. B. Rifkin (New York University, New York). Rabbit marrow cells were isolated using a modification of the method of Tezuka et al. (22Tezuka K. Sato T. Kamioka H. Nijweide P.J. Tanaka K. Matsuo T. Ohta M. Kurihara N. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Femora, humeri, ulnae, and radii of 11-day-old New Zealand White rabbits were removed. Connective tissues were dissected away, and the bones were minced in α-modified minimal essential medium (αMEM). The bone pieces were vortexed to dissociate the cells, and bone particles were removed by sedimentation under gravity. The supernatant was centrifuged, and the cells were resuspended in αMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mml-glutamine (LG), and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). The cells were then seeded into 12-well plates coated with 35S-labeled bone ECM (see below). Avian osteoclast precursors were isolated as described elsewhere from the medullary bone of egg-laying White Leghorn hens fed on a low calcium diet (23Alvarez I. Teitelbaum S.L. Blair H.C. Greenfield E.M. Athanasou N.A. Ross F.P. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2324-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The cells were plated in 150-mm Petri dishes as described elsewhere (23Alvarez I. Teitelbaum S.L. Blair H.C. Greenfield E.M. Athanasou N.A. Ross F.P. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2324-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and after overnight incubation, adherent cells were harvested by treatment with 2 mm EDTA in PBS for 5 min at 37 °C. The cells were then replated into 12-well plates coated with 35S-labeled bone ECM (see below) in αMEM containing 2.5% FBS, 2.5% chicken serum, 2 mm LG, 100 units/ml P/S, and 6 μg/ml arabinose-β-d-cytosine furanoside. These cells have been shown to fuse and become multinucleated in the presence of 1,25-D3 (23Alvarez I. Teitelbaum S.L. Blair H.C. Greenfield E.M. Athanasou N.A. Ross F.P. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2324-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 5, e and f). The cells were cultured for up to 6 days, with or without 1,25-D3 and/or protease inhibitors as described below. Culture media were changed every 2 days. FPLC fractionation was performed as described previously (24Dallas S.L. Park-Snyder S. Miyazono K. Twardzik D. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6815-6822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FRC cells were grown in 150-cm2 flasks in αMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm LG, 100 units/ml P/S, and 30 μg/ml gentamycin. At confluence the media were changed to αMEM, supplemented as above but with the addition of 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 3 mm β-glycerophosphate (β-GP) and the reduction of the serum to 5%. Thereafter the media were changed every 3 days. Conditioned medium was harvested from four time points representing sequential stages in the in vitro differentiation of FRC cells to form mineralized bone-like nodules. The “pre-confluent” stage was from proliferating cultures at 90% confluence; the “early post-confluent” stage was from 2-day post-confluent cultures; the “nodule-forming” stage was from 6-day post-confluent cultures in which multilayered cellular nodules had formed, but were not yet mineralized; and the “mineralization” stage was from 14-day post-confluent cultures in which mineralized bone nodules were present (see Fig. 1, inset micrographs). For collection of conditioned media, phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was used containing 2 mm LG, 100 units/ml P/S, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid. 25 ml of conditioned medium was collected per flask over a 48-h culture period. A total of 150 ml of conditioned medium per time point was concentrated 10-fold over a 50-kDa cut-off membrane using a minisette concentrator (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the samples were lyophilized and reconstituted with 1–2 ml of distilled water, pH 7.2. They were then dialyzed against 20 mm tris buffer, pH 7.2, and applied to an analytical Mono-Q anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl/20 mmtris buffer. Fractions were tested for TGF-β activity using the alkaline phosphatase microassay as described below. TGF-β was measured as described previously by using either the ROS 17/2.8 microassay (24Dallas S.L. Park-Snyder S. Miyazono K. Twardzik D. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6815-6822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which measures stimulation of alkaline phosphatase activity by TGF-β in ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells, or by using the mink lung epithelial cell luciferase bioassay (25Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), which measures stimulation of activity of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter by TGF-β. To determine the total (active + latent) TGF-β levels, the samples were acidified to pH 2 using 1 m HCl and then reneutralized using 1m NaOH immediately before addition to the assay plate. Latent TGF-β values were determined by subtracting active TGF-β measurements from total TGF-β. To examine further the secreted and matrix-bound forms of latent TGF-β produced by FRC cells, pulse-chase metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation were performed. Cells were plated into 12-well multiwell plates at 10,000 cells/cm2 growth area. At 90% confluence, the cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated for 1 h in cysteine-free αMEM supplemented with 5% dialyzed FBS, 2 mm LG, 100 units/ml P/S, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid. The cells were then labeled for 30 min using 100 μCi/well [35S]cysteine (Amersham Biosciences) in cysteine-free αMEM supplemented with 5% dialyzed FBS and additives as above. This was followed by a “cold chase” in complete αMEM (containing 0.1 mg/ml l-cysteine), supplemented with 5% FBS and additives as above for a time course of 15 and 30 min, and 2, 6, 24, and 48 h. Conditioned media were harvested and protease inhibitors added (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin). The cells + matrix were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and then lysed in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (RIPA) (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). The deoxycholate-insoluble material (essentially matrix) was washed two more times in ice-cold PBS, transferred to a 1.5-ml tube, and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm. The pellet was then digested for 2 h at 37 °C on an end-over rotator in 500 μl of a solution consisting of 0.2 units/ml plasmin in plasmin digestion buffer (see under “Protease Digestions”). This digestion releases any LTBP1 that may still be bound to the ECM (9Dallas S.L. Miyazono K. Skerry T.M. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 21Taipale J. Lohi J. Saharinen J. Kovanen P.T. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4689-4696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). LTBP1 and TGF-β in the supernatant and in the plasmin digest of the matrix were determined by immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described previously (9Dallas S.L. Miyazono K. Skerry T.M. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 24Dallas S.L. Park-Snyder S. Miyazono K. Twardzik D. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6815-6822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for LTBP1 or using a goat polyclonal antibody specific for LAP. To prepare bone ECM for culturing with osteoclasts, FRC cells were plated into 12-well plates as described above. At confluence, the medium was changed to αMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, 2 mm LG, 100 units/ml P/S, 30 μg/ml gentamycin, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and 3 mmβ-GP. Thereafter, the culture media were changed every 3 days. Cultures were maintained for 10–14 days, by which time mineralized bone nodules could be seen, and a thick ECM layer had formed. For preparation of ECM-coated plates, a modification of the method of Joneset al. (26Jones J.I. Gockerman A. Busby W.H. Camacho-Hubner C. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) was used. The cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4 °C. This leaves a membrane-like layer of bone ECM adhered to the bottom of the culture well. The matrix layer was then washed twice in ice-cold PBS and treated with ice-cold 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.5, for 10 min at 4 °C (the pH was reduced from 9.0, as described in Jones et al. (26Jones J.I. Gockerman A. Busby W.H. Camacho-Hubner C. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), to prevent activation of TGF-β by the alkaline pH). The matrix layers were then washed 4 times in PBS, air-dried, and stored at −70 °C. An immunoprecipitation-based assay was developed for examining release of bone matrix-bound LTBP1 and latent TGF-β by cells cultured on bone ECM (27Dallas S.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 139: 231-243PubMed Google Scholar). FRC cells were cultured in 12-well plates as described above until 10–14 days of culture. The cells were then labeled for 48 h using 100 μCi/well [35S]cysteine in αMEM containing one-fifth the normal cysteine content and supplemented with 5% dialyzed FBS, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 3 mm β-GP, 100 units/ml P/S, 2 mm LG. The labeled bone ECM was prepared as described above. To examine release of LTBP1/TGF-β by osteoclasts, two sources of osteoclast precursors were used, rabbit marrow cells and avian osteoclasts. The cells were plated onto the radiolabeled ECM at 2.5 × 106 cells/well (rabbit marrow cells) or 5 × 106 cells/well (avian osteoclast precursors) in 2 ml of αMEM supplemented as described above. The cells were incubated with or without addition of 1,25-D3, PTHrP, or protease inhibitors as specified under “Results.” Release of LTBP1 and latent TGF-β was monitored by immunoprecipitating the labeled protein fragments released into the culture media using anti-LTBP1 antibodies (the LTBP1 antibodies will precipitate both free LTBP1 and LTBP1 complexed to latent TGF-β). Because the osteoclasts themselves were never exposed to [35S]cysteine, any radiolabeled proteins present in the culture supernatants were assumed to have been released from the pre-labeled matrix. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and protease inhibitors added as described above. The deoxycholate-insoluble pellet was digested in 0.2 units/ml plasmin as described above. LTBP1 in the supernatant and in the plasmin digest of the matrix was then determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-LTBP1 antibodies, as described above. Plasmin and elastase digestions of ECM preparations were performed in a digestion buffer consisting of 0.1% 1-O-n-octyl-β-glucopyranoside, 3 mmMgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8. MMP2 and MMP9 digestions were performed in MMP digestion buffer (50 mmTris, 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% Brij 35, pH 7.6). Activity of the MMPs was confirmed in all experiments by gelatin zymography. Samples were separated on SDS-PAGE using 4–20% gradient gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted as described previously (9Dallas S.L. Miyazono K. Skerry T.M. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F.

Res. 2000; 15: 68-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The immunostained bands were visualized using the ECL detection system according to manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The immunostained Western blots were then exposed to X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak). For immunofluorescent staining, FRC cells were cultured on lab-tek 8-chamber slides at 10,000 cells/cm2 growth area and maintained for 10–14 days as described above. ECM was prepared as described above and incubated with or without proteases as described above. After incubation in proteases, the ECM layers were fixed in 95% ethanol and stained by immunofluorescence as described previously (10Dallas S.L. Keene D.R. Bruder S.P. Saharinen J. Sakai L.Y. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 68-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As matrix laid down by primary osteoblast cultures was to be used to examine release of bone matrix-bound TGF-β by osteoclasts, it was first necessary to characterize the latent TGF-β complexes produced by the osteoblast cultures and determine what proportion of the latent TGF-β was complexed to LTBP1. Fig. 1 shows results from Mono-Q FPLC analysis of conditioned media samples from FRC cultures at the pre-confluent, early post-confluent, nodule-forming, and mineralizing stages (see “Materials and Methods”). The insets in Fig. 1 show the appearance of the cultures at each of these stages. Two major peaks of latent TGF-β activity were observed, one eluting at 0.22 m NaCl (peak II), which is the expected elution position for the 100-kDa small latent TGF-β complex (16Bonewald L.F.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6815-6822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the other eluting at 0.3m NaCl (peak III), which corresponds to the 290-kDa large latent TGF-β complex, containing LTBP1 (16Bonewald L.F.

The pre-confluent and early post-confluent cultures produced predominantly the small latent TGF-β complex (peak II). However, with maturation in culture, the cells switched to producing larger amounts of the 290-kDa (LTBP1-containing) complex (peak III), which made up ∼40% of the total latent TGF-β secreted. In addition, a minor peak eluting at 0.05 m NaCl (peak I) was also observed in nodule-forming and mineralizing cultures. At present the nature of this peak is unknown. Antibody neutralization studies indicated that the latent TGF-β activity was predominantly TGF-β1 in all three peaks with smaller amounts of TGF-β2 (data not shown). In the pre-confluent and early post-confluent cultures, peak III showed ∼20–30% TGF-β2 activity, in contrast to the nodule-forming and mineralizing cultures, which showed no detectable TGF-β2 activity in this peak (data not shown). LTBP1 has been shown to be cross-linked in the ECM via the action of transglutaminase (28Nunes I. Gleizes P. Metz C.N. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1151-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and is highly insoluble. Previous studies have shown that proteases such as plasmin and elastase can release proteolytic fragments of LTBP1 from the ECM (9Dallas S.L. Miyazono K. Skerry T.M. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J.

Several approaches were utilized to elucidate the metabolic pathways. 1) Platelet phospholipids were labeled using [32P]orthophosphate, and the production of [32P]Sph1P and LPA was examined. Thrombin stimulation of platelets resulted in rapid secretion of Sph1P stored within the platelet. In contrast, LPA was neither stored within nor secreted from platelets. Nonetheless, extracellular levels of LPA gradually increased following stimulation. 2) Stable-isotope dilution mass spectrometry was used to quantify the molecular species of LPA generated from plateletsin vitro. Only 10% of the LPA generated following thrombin stimulation was associated with platelets, the remaining 90% was contained within the extracellular medium. The acyl composition of LPA produced by platelets differed depending on the presence or absence of plasma in the incubation. 3) The fate of exogenously added fluorescent phospholipid analogs was determined. Incubation of [(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]dodecanoyl-(NBD)-labeled phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine with the supernatant fractions from thrombin-stimulated platelets yielded no LPA production. However, these lipids were converted to the corresponding lysolipids by released PLA1 and PLA2 activities. When incubated with plasma or serum the NBD-labeled lysophospholipids were readily converted to LPA. Inhibitors of lysophospholipase D and the biological activity of LPA were detected in plasma. These results suggest that the bulk of LPA produced through platelet activation results from the sequential cleavage of phospholipids to lysophospholipids by released phospholipases A1 and A2 and then to LPA by plasma lysophospholipase D.

Prostaglandins Lipid Mediators. 2001; 64: 47-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Several investigators have identified platelets as the source of Sph1P and LPA. However, contradictions exist in the literature concerning the mechanisms by which these mediators are generated. Although some investigators found no Sph1P generation in thrombin-activated platelets (3Eicholtz T. Jalink K. Fahrenfort I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), others reported as much as 0.5 μm Sph1P in human serum (4Yatomi Y. Igarashi Y. Yang L. Hisano N., Qi, R. Asazuma N. Satoh K. Ozaki Y. Kume S. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Although it is generally agreed that LPA is generated in thrombin-activated platelets (3Eicholtz T. Jalink K. Fahrenfort I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 5Lapetina E. Billah M. Cuatrecasas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11984-11987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gerrard J.M. Robinson P. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the rate of production found at 0.02 nmol/min/109 platelet cannot account for the 5–10 μm concentration detected in human serum (7Baker D.L. Desiderio M.D. Miller D.D. Tolley B. Tigyi G. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). During the first hour of blood clotting the concentration of LPA increases ∼300 nm; however, its production continues and an additional 5 μm is added to serum during the first 24 h, a time course that is hard to reconcile with that of platelet activation and consequently of platelet only origin. Gerrard and Robinson (6Gerrard J.M. Robinson P. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) quantified the molecular species of acyl-LPA in resting and thrombin-stimulated platelets, with a rank order of 16:0 > 18:0 > 20:4 > 18:1 > 18:2. In contrast, in plasma, the rank order is 18:2 > 18:1 ≥ 18:0 > 16:0 > 20:4, whereas in serum the order is 20:4 > 18:2 > 16:0 ≥ 18:1 > 18:0 (7Baker D.L. Desiderio M.D. Miller D.D. Tolley B. Tigyi G. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Hence, the bulk of LPA present in serum is likely generated from a precursor distinct from that of LPA present in plasma. Tokumura et al. (8Tokumura A. Harada K. Fukuzawa K. Tsukatani H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 875: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), described the presence of a lysophospholipase D (LPLD) activity in plasma that was capable of generating LPA with a substrate preference for unsaturated lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and required metal ions for its activity (9Tokumura A. Miyake M. Yoshimito O. Shimizu M. Fukuzawa K. Lipids. 1998; 33: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to clarify the mechanisms that contribute to the production of Sph1P and LPA in plasma and serum. [32P]Orthophosphate labeling of platelets was utilized to determine the generation, storage, and release of Sph1P and LPA in isolated platelets. Stable-isotope dilution mass spectrometry was used to quantify individual LPA species inside and outside thrombin-stimulated platelets. Finally, the ability to produce LPA from exogenous, fluorescently labeled phospholipids was determined upon incubation with supernatant fractions from stimulated platelets, plasma, and serum. Our results indicate that, in platelets, Sph1P is stored and rapidly released after thrombin stimulation, whereas LPA is generated through two different mechanisms. A minor portion of serum LPA originates within platelets, whereas the majority of LPA is the product of released PLA1 and PLA2 and of plasma lysophospholipase(s) D through sequential cleavage of serum and membrane phospholipids first to lysophospholipids and then to LPA. The following materials were obtained from the indicated suppliers: apyrase, PLA2 from Crotalus adamanteus venom PLD Type VII from Streptomyces species PLA1 type XI from Rhizopus arrhizus, human thrombin, prostaglandin E1, staurosporine, LPA,l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC),l-α-lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE),l-α-lysophosphatidylserine (LPS), bovine serum albumin (BSA, Fraction V, fatty-acid-free), and octyl-glucoside were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO); d-erythro-Sph1P and dioleoyl phosphatidic acid (PA) were from Matreya, Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA); 1-oleoyl-2-NBD-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (2-NBD-PA), 1-oleoyl-2-NDB-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-oleoyl-2-NBD-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, and 1-oleoyl-2-NBD-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL); Silica Gel 60 high performance TLC and Silica Gel 60 TLC plates were purchased from the Merck Chemical Co. (Darmstadt, Germany); [32P]orthophosphoric acid with a specific activity of 314–337 TBq/mmol was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA); TLC solvents were all of high performance liquid chromatography grade. Platelets were isolated from cubital venous blood of healthy adult volunteers of both genders as described previously (10Yatomi Y. Ohmori T. Rile G. Kazama F. Okamoto H. Sano T. Satoh K. Kume S. Tigyi G. Igarashi Y. Ozaki Y. Blood. 2000; 96: 3431-3438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Washed platelets were suspended in buffer A consisting of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 138 mm NaCl, 3.3 mm NaH2PO4, 2.9 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml glucose, and 0.1% (w/v) BSA unless stated otherwise. Platelet numbers were determined using a Coulter counter (Hialeah, FL). Platelets suspended in buffer A without added NaH2PO4 at a cell density of 109/ml were incubated with 2.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 2 h at 37 °C. Labeled platelets were diluted, washed twice in buffer A containing prostaglandin E1 (1 μm) and 3 units/ml apyrase, and finally adjusted to a density of ∼3 × 108/ml. [32P]Orthophosphate-labeled platelets were treated with 1 unit/ml thrombin in 0.5-ml aliquots for various times in the presence or absence of 2 mm Ca2+. The incubation was terminated by 1-min centrifugation at 10,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge to separate a supernatant fraction from the platelet pellet. Lipids from the supernatant and the cell pellet were extracted by either the protocol described by Yatomi et al. (10Yatomi Y. Ohmori T. Rile G. Kazama F. Okamoto H. Sano T. Satoh K. Kume S. Tigyi G. Igarashi Y. Ozaki Y. Blood. 2000; 96: 3431-3438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or that of Eicholtzet al. (3Eicholtz T. Jalink K. Fahrenfort I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). One of the duplicate samples was extracted with a stepwise addition of 3 ml of ice-cold chloroform:methanol (1:2), followed by 2 ml of chloroform, 2 ml of 1 m KCl, and 40 μl of 7 n NH4OH, with vigorous shaking after each step (10Yatomi Y. Ohmori T. Rile G. Kazama F. Okamoto H. Sano T. Satoh K. Kume S. Tigyi G. Igarashi Y. Ozaki Y. Blood. 2000; 96: 3431-3438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation for 5 min at 3000 ×g, the upper phase was supplemented with 3 ml of chloroform and 160 μl of concentrated HCl, and the phases were separated by centrifugation. The lower phase was transferred to a new tube, and the solvent was evaporated in vacuo. The second of each duplicate sample was extracted by the method of Eicholtz et al. (3Eicholtz T. Jalink K. Fahrenfort I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) using acidic butanol. The extracted phospholipids were analyzed by either one-dimensional TLC (1DTLC) or 2DTLC, using a variety of solvent mixtures described under “Results.” Autoradiography was performed using X-Omat AR-5 (Kodak, Rochester, NY) or BAS-MS2025 (FUJI Corp.) X-ray films after overnight exposure or by a Model FLA2000 phosphorimaging system (FUJI Corp.) Platelets suspended in buffer A were incubated in the presence or absence of 2 mm CaCl2 and 1 unit/ml thrombin for 1 h at 37 °C. A low speed supernatant (Sup1) was separated from the platelets by centrifugation at 104 ×g for 2 min, and the platelet pellet was designated P1. In several experiments, Sup1, which contains microvesicles shed by activated platelets (11Heijnen H.F.G. Schiel A.E. Fijnheer R. Geuze H.J. Sixma J.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 3791-3799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was centrifuged at 105 ×g for 45 min to obtain a particle-free supernatant (Sup2) and the microvesicle pellet (P2). The four fractions served as the source of the enzymes used to examine the metabolism of NBD-labeled phospholipids. Micelles containing 5 nmol ofsn2-NBD-labeled PC, PE, PS, or PA in buffer (500 μm octyl-glucoside, 400 μm NaCl, 67 mm HEPES; pH 7.4) were mixed with 20 μl of supernatant or pellet fraction in a 500-μl final volume for up to 6 h at 37 °C, essentially as described by Ella et al. (12Ella K.M. Meier G.P. Bradshaw C.D. Huffman K.M. Spivey E.C. Meier K.E. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The incubation mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 104 ×g, and lipids were extracted from the supernatant after acidification with 50 μl of 0.2 n HCl, using 275 μl of water-saturated butanol. The butanol phase was obtained after brief centrifugation and evaporated in vacuo before TLC analysis of the metabolic products. One milligram of sn2-NBD-labeled PC, PE, or PS was hydrolyzed with 8000 units of Rhizopus PLA1 in 0.1m borate buffer (pH 6.5) in the presence of 3 mg/ml sodium deoxycholate, 4 mg/ml BSA, and 5 mm CaCl2. The reaction mixture was shaken for 6 h, and lipids were extracted according to the method of Kates (13Kates M. Burdon R.H. van Knippenberg P.H. Techniques in Lipidology. 2nd Ed. Elsevier, Amsterdam, New York, Oxford1986: 404-411Google Scholar). To promote acyl migration, lipids were incubated at pH 8.5 in 0.1 m sodium tetraborate for at least 2 h. The sn2- and sn1-NBD-labeled lysolipids were separated using 1DTLC. Fluorescent spots corresponding to sn1-NBD-lysolipid were scraped, eluted with methanol, dried under nitrogen, and stored at −20 °C. Acyl-chain position was confirmed by resistance to PLA2 cleavage (data not shown). In some experiments, sn1-NBD-labeled LPC, LPE, and LPS were used to monitor their metabolism in the supernatant and pellet fractions as described forsn2-labeled phospholipids above. Cubital venous blood was mixed with a 0.01 volume of heparin solution to a final concentration of 10 IU/ml. Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 112 × g for 15 min and immediately mixed with 1 mm prostaglandin E1. Platelets were removed by centrifugation at 104 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. Blood taken without anticoagulant from the same donors was either centrifuged immediately at 10,000 × g for 2 min to yield a supernatant designated as activated plasma or allowed to clot at 37 °C for 1 h. Serum was collected by centrifugation at 1100 ×g for 10 min, followed by recentrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 2 min. Serum and plasma were filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane filter, aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C. For time-course studies, serum or plasma (100 μl) was incubated with 20 nmol of substrate containing a 1:99 ratio of 1-NBD-labeled to unlabeled lysophospholipid. The reaction was terminated by adding a 0.3 volume of 0.1 m citric acid and 5.4 volumes of chloroform:methanol (2:1). After vigorous shaking for 5 min, samples were centrifuged at 1400 × g for 5 min. The upper phase was re-extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v), and the lower phases were pooled, dried, and assayed for the generation of NBD-labeled LPA by TLC. For experiments to determine the effects of dilution of plasma, activated plasma, and serum on the conversion ofsn1-NBD-LPC or LPS to LPA, the amount and composition of lipids present in the reaction mixture had to be kept constant while the amount of serum protein was varied. To achieve this in, for example, a 100-μl reaction volume in the case of a 1:1 dilution, lipids were extracted twice from 50 μl of plasma (or serum) and the extract was dried under N2 gas. The extracted lipids were resuspended in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.2 nmol of sn1-NBD-lysophospholipid was added. For the final reaction mixture, 50 μl plasma or serum was mixed with 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing the lipids extracted from plasma (serum) with the NBD-lysophospholipid tracer and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, essentially yielding a 1:1 dilution for plasma protein, whereas the total amount of lipid remained equivalent to that present in 100 μl of undiluted plasma. For a 1:2 dilution, the amount of plasma extracted was adjusted to 67 μl, for a 1:4 dilution to 80 μl, etc., whereas the volume of plasma used in the 100-μl reaction mixture was decreased to 33 and 20 μl, respectively. At the end of the incubation, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 35 μl of 0.1 m citrate and 540 μl of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v:v), and lipids were extracted twice. The lipid extract was taken up in 20 μl of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v:v) and applied in toto to a single lane of a TLC plate. The developed TLC plate was scanned using a Model FLA2000 scanner (FUJI Corp.), and the fluorescence intensity at the position of the authentic LPA standard was quantified. The extraction of lipids and the quantification of the molecular species of 16:0, 18:0, 18:1, 18:2, and 20:4 LPA, which constitute over 90% of the total LPA detectable in plasma, were done as previously described (7Baker D.L. Desiderio M.D. Miller D.D. Tolley B. Tigyi G. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Purified platelets (1.7–1.9 × 109/ml) were taken up in 500 μl of human plasma or in buffer A containing 1% fatty acid-free BSA. Platelets used for negative control received an additional 5 mm EGTA and 1 μm staurosporine to block activation and spontaneous release. Another set of platelets was stimulated to secrete by using 1 unit/ml thrombin in the presence of 5 mm EGTA. The third set of samples was treated with 1 unit/ml thrombin in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2. The treatments were allowed to proceed for 15 min at 37 °C. To separate platelets from the supernatant, centrifugation at 104 × g was performed for 5 min, and the specimens were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until lipid extraction. Electrospray ionization LC-MS was performed on a Bruker Esquire ion trap fitted with an Econosphere 3-μm 50- × 4.6-mm silica column (Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL). Compounds were eluted using a mobile phase of chloroform:methanol:water:28% ammonium hydroxide (250:100:15:0.3, v/v) at 0.5 ml/min. The source was maintained at 250 °C with a drying gas flow of 10 liters/h; data were collected in the negative ion mode from 100 to 1000 m/z at 13,000 atomic mass units/s. Masses corresponding to the molecular anions [M-H]− for each of the LPA species were plotted versus time, and the peak areas were integrated. The procedures for the collection of and voltage clamp recording from oocytes have been described elsewhere (14Tigyi G.J. Liliom K. Fischer D.J. Guo Z. Laychock S.G. Rubin R.P. Phospholipid Growth Factors: Identification and Mechanism of Action. Lipid Second Messengers. CRC Press, Boca Raton1999: 51-81Google Scholar). The biological fluids collected from three healthy donors were directly diluted 100-fold with Ringer's solution, and peak current amplitudes were measured. Student's t test and repeated analysis of variance were used to test the null hypotheses, and data were considered statistically significantly different atp < 0.05. The first objective of this study was to clarify whether LPA and Sph1P are biosynthetically labeled, i.e. constitutively generated in nonstimulated platelets. For this, we extracted phospholipids from platelets following incubation for 2 h with [32P]orthophosphate. This protocol is essentially the same as that originally used by Eicholtz et al. (3Eicholtz T. Jalink K. Fahrenfort I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). We compared the acidic butanol extraction protocol used by these authors with that of Yatomi et al. (10Yatomi Y. Ohmori T. Rile G. Kazama F. Okamoto H. Sano T. Satoh K. Kume S. Tigyi G. Igarashi Y. Ozaki Y. Blood. 2000; 96: 3431-3438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to determine if a difference between the extraction procedures could have caused the lack of Sph1P detection by Eicholtz et al. The extracts were analyzed by 2DTLC using chloroform:methanol:28% ammonium hydroxide (12:12:1) in the first dimension, taken from the report by Eicholtzet al., and butanol:glacial acetic acid:water (3:1:1) in the second dimension (Fig. 1). The latter solvent has been shown to resolve LPA and Sph1P (10Yatomi Y. Ohmori T. Rile G. Kazama F. Okamoto H. Sano T. Satoh K. Kume S. Tigyi G. Igarashi Y. Ozaki Y. Blood. 2000; 96: 3431-3438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the position of the LPA standard, autoradiographs of lipid extracts derived from supernatants and pellets of nonstimulated platelets prepared by both extraction protocols showed trace amounts of radiolabeled LPA, detectable only by phosphorimaging. In contrast, a clearly labeled spot, comigrating with the Sph1P standard, was detectable in these samples, suggesting that a platelet Sph1P pool is biosynthetically active in nonstimulated platelets and that under these conditions a small fraction of this pool was released into the supernatant in the absence of stimulation with exogenous thrombin. When thrombin was added in the presence of 2 mm extracellular Ca2+, a robust release of Sph1P was detected in the supernatant (Fig.1D). Under these conditions, labeled LPA became detectable in the platelet pellet and supernatant (Fig. 1, C and D). With regard to the production of Sph1P and LPA, identical findings were obtained with both methods of extraction (data not shown). These results confirmed that Sph1P and LPA are both present in the medium of thrombin-stimulated platelets when a physiological concentration of Ca2+ is present. To determine the time course of Sph1P and LPA production from isolated platelets stimulated to secrete and/or to aggregate, we utilized the 1DTLC system of Yatomi et al. (10Yatomi Y. Ohmori T. Rile G. Kazama F. Okamoto H. Sano T. Satoh K. Kume S. Tigyi G. Igarashi Y. Ozaki Y. Blood. 2000; 96: 3431-3438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and quantified the radioactivity incorporated into these lipids in the supernatant and platelet pellets (Fig. 2). Measurements of LPA and Sph1P present in the supernatant are a reliable measure of these lipids, because 2DTLC analysis (see Fig. 1, B and D) revealed no other 32P-labeled lipids with similar mobility. However, this 1DTLC system could not be applied to the quantification of LPA and Sph1P present in the platelet pellet, because other unidentified lipids were also detected by 2DTLC with identical mobilities (Fig. 1, A and C). Stimulation with thrombin in the absence of Ca2+ and in the presence of 5 mm EGTA activates secretion from platelets, but not platelet aggregation, and prevents the action of Ca2+-dependent enzymes released into the medium. We performed lipid extractions under these conditions and found a substantial increase in the amount of Sph1P in the supernatant (Fig.2, A and B). In contrast, only a trace of labeled LPA was detectable in the supernatant and the platelet pellets. The findings were again identical for both methods of extraction (Fig. 2, compare A and B). In contrast, when thrombin stimulation was performed in the presence of physiological concentrations of Ca2+, the amount of released Sph1P did not increase substantially over that for platelets stimulated to secrete, whereas LPA became extensively labeled in the platelet pellet and supernatant. Quantitative analysis of the phosphorimaging signals did not detect any increase over unstimulated levels in biosynthetic labeling of LPA in response to a secretory stimulus (Fig.2C). In contrast, thrombin-stimulated secretion increased Sph1P release ∼4-fold (Fig. 2D). When thrombin stimulation was elicited in the presence of Ca2+, a rapid and intense labeling of PA and LPA was detected in the platelets (Fig. 2, A and B). This was accompanied by the release of LPA into the supernatant, where ∼27% of the total label was recovered after a 10-min stimulation. Under these conditions, Sph1P release did not significantly exceed that observed after a secretory stimulus (Fig. 2D). Approximately 25% of the total Sph1P label was recovered from the supernatant. The time course of labeled Sph1P and LPA accumulation in the medium was followed for up to 3 h under conditions that permitted aggregation (Fig. 3). Sph1P reached its maximal release within 15 min and slowly decreased to a steady-state level between 90 and 180 min. LPA production in the supernatant showed a steady increase up to 60 min; thereafter it decreased slightly to reach a steady-state level up to 180 min. Several investigators have shown a rapid increase in the labeling of PA in thrombin-stimulated platelets that reached a maximum at 5 min (15Lloyd J.V. Nishizawa E.E. Hladar J. Mustard J.F. Br. J.

Nature. 1981; 292: 367-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) reported that this early rise in PA is followed by a rise in labeled LPA and hence proposed that the labeled PA pool was converted to LPA via Ca2+-activated intracellular PLA2 enzymes. Our results confirm a peak of PA labeling at around 5 min; beyond this point, however, we could not detect a correlation between PA and LPA labeling. Labeled LPA continued to increase in the supernatant, reaching a peak at 60 min, whereas no labeled PA was detectable after 15 min. Biosynthetic labeling of platelet phospholipids yields no quantitative information about the individual molecular species of LPA generated. To circumvent this deficiency we applied SID-LC-MS to determine the concentration of five molecular species of LPA present in platelet pellets and supernatant fractions from nonstimulated and thrombin-stimulated platelets obtained from five healthy donors (Table I). The isolated platelets were divided into two groups, the first of which was incubated in buffer A containing 0.5% BSA to capture released LPA. A second sample set was incubated in human plasma to mimic in vivo conditions. LPA was not found in the supernatant of nonstimulated platelets, whereas its concentration was 190 ± 40 nm in the presence of plasma after 15 min incubation at 37 °C. This latter concentration corresponds to the basal LPA level in plasma (7Baker D.L. Desiderio M.D. Miller D.D. Tolley B. Tigyi G. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The corresponding platelet pellets had LPA concentrations of 130 ± 20 and 100 ± 40 nm in the presence of buffer and plasma, respectively. When platelets were stimulated with thrombin in the presence of 5 mm EGTA, no significant change in LPA content was detected in either the platelet pellet or supernatant as compared with nonstimulated controls. This reaffirms our findings obtained from the biosynthetic labeling experiments (Fig. 2). When platelets were stimulated with thrombin in the presence of 2 mmCa2+, there was a substantial increase in LPA concentration in the supernatant. In the presence of buffer A, the combined concentration of the five LPA species increased to 670 ± 140 nm, whereas in the presence of plasma it increased to 560 ± 300 nm. The increase of LPA in the supernatant fraction was accompanied by a slight decrease in LPA concentration in the platelet pellet that amounted to 50 ± 20 nm in buffer A and with no change (30 ± 40 nm) in plasma (Table I). This observation indicates that platelet activation resulted in a marginal change in the labeling of the intracellular pool of LPA. The distribution of acyl species of LPA determined in platelet pellets and supernatants showed striking differences depending on the presence or absence of plasma in the platelet preparation. The rank order of molecular species of LPA detected in the supernatants from platelets stimulated with thrombin and Ca2+ in buffer A was 18:0 ≫ 20:4 > 18:1 > 16:0 ≥ 18:2. In contrast, when platelets were incubated with plasma and stimulated with thrombin and Ca2+, the rank order of the LPA species in the supernatant was 20:4 > 18:2 = 18:0 > 16:0 = 18:1. The acyl species distribution found in the platelet pellet was 18:0 > 20:4 > 16:0 = 18:2 ≥ 18:1 in the absence of plasma, whereas it was 20:4 > 16:0 >"

Aromatase is expressed in breast adipose tissue through the use of a distal, cytokine-responsive promoter (promoter I.4). Breast tumors, however, secrete soluble factors that stimulate aromatase expression through an alternative proximal promoter, promoter II. In other estrogenic tissues such as ovaries, transcription from promoter II requires the presence of the Ftz-F1 homologue steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1); adipose tissue, however, does not express SF-1. We have explored the hypothesis that in adipose tissue, an alternative Ftz-F1 family member, liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1), substitutes for SF-1 in driving transcription from promoter II. In transient transfection assays using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, promoter II reporter constructs were modestly (2–3-fold) stimulated by either treatment with activators of protein kinases A or C (PKA/C) or by cotransfection with LRH-1. In combination, these treatments synergistically activated promoter II (>30-fold). Induction by LRH-1 (but not by PKA/C) required an AGGTCA motif at −130 base pairs, to which LRH-1 bound in gel shift assays. Activity of GAL4-LRH-1 fusion proteins was not altered by activators of PKA or PKC. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that LRH-1 (but not SF-1) is expressed in the preadipocyte fraction of human adipose tissue at levels comparable with that of liver. Differentiation of cultured human preadipocytes into mature adipocytes was associated with a time-dependent induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), and rapid loss of LRH-1 and aromatase expression. We conclude that LRH-1 is a preadipocyte-specific nuclear receptor that regulates expression of aromatase in adipose tissue. Alterations in LRH-1 expression and/or activity in adipose tissue could therefore have considerable effects on local estrogen production and breast cancer development.

In humans, aromatase is expressed in both the granulosa and luteal cells of the ovary and also in various extra-glandular sites, including the placenta, brain, bone, testis, and adipose tissue (2Bulun S.E. Simpson E.R. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1994; 30: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Aromatase is encoded by the CYP19 gene, which maps to chromosome 15q21.2 in humans (3Chen S.A.

These are spliced to a common site in the 5′-untranslated region. Tissue-specific regulation of CYP19 expression is achieved through the use of these distinct promoters, each of which is regulated by distinct hormonal factors. Thus in the ovary, CYP19 expression is regulated by FSH, which acts (through cAMP) via promoter II (11Steinkampf M.P. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. Mol.

In bone and adipose tissue, by contrast, a distal promoter (promoter I.4) drives CYP19 expression under the control of glucocorticoids, class 1 cytokines, or TNFα (14Shozu M. Simpson E.R. Mol. Cell.

In postmenopausal women, aromatase activity in adipose tissue is the major source of circulating estrogens (18Siiteri P.K. Macdonald P.C. Green R.O. Astwoon E.B. Handbook of Physiology.

Mendelson C.R. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 185-213PubMed Google Scholar). In normal breast adipose tissue aromatase activity and CYP19 expression are low. However, in adipose tissue of breast cancer patients, estrogen levels, aromatase activity, and CYP19 expression are elevated (20Thorsen T. Tangen M. Stoa K.F. Eur. J. Cancer Clin.

This occurs in response to tumor-derived factors (such as prostaglandin E2) produced by breast tumor fibroblasts and epithelium as well as infiltrating macrophages (24Zhao Y. Agarwal V.R. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 61: 203-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is this local source of estrogen that provides the drive for growth of estrogen receptor-positive tumors and which is the target of anti-estrogen adjuvant therapies in postmenopausal women. However, current strategies of anti-estrogen therapy such as pure estrogen receptor antagonists or aromatase enzyme inhibitors act in a global fashion and inhibit estrogen action or synthesis in all sites of production. This has the potential to result in bone loss and other sequelae of estrogen insufficiency such as cognitive dysfunction and hepatic steatosis with prolonged treatment (25Paganini-Hill A. Clark L.J.

The increased CYP19 expression in response to breast tumor-derived factors is associated with a switch in promoter usage from the normal adipose-specific promoter I.4 to the cAMP-responsive promoter II (28Agarwal V.R.

Since these two promoters are regulated by different cohorts of transcription factors and coactivators, it follows that the differential regulation of CYP19 expression via alternative promoters in disease-free and cancerous breast adipose tissue may permit the development of selective aromatase modulators, which target the aberrant overexpression in cancerous breast, while sparing estrogen action in other sites of synthesis such as normal adipose tissue, bone, and brain (31Simpson E.R. Davis S.R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4589-4594Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). A more complete understanding of the mechanisms regulating CYP19 transcription from promoter II in breast adipose tissue is a prerequisite for the development of such selective aromatase modulators. In classic steroidogenic tissue such as ovary and testis, promoter II is regulated by steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1 1The abbreviations used are: SF-1steroidogenic factor-1LRH-1liver receptor homologue-1ERestrogen receptorERRαestrogen receptor-related receptor-αPPARγperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γNREnuclear receptor half-siteDBDDNA binding domainPKAprotein kinase APKCprotein kinase CFSKforskolinPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateFtz-F1fushi tarazu F1 /Ad4BP/NR5A1) (32(1999) Cell 97, 161–163Google Scholar), which binds to a nuclear receptor half-site (NRE) within the promoter to mediate basal transcription and, in part, cAMP-induced transcription (12Michael M.D. Kilgore M.W.

In the current study we show that LRH-1 can bind to and strongly activate promoter II of the CYP19 gene. Importantly, LRH-1 is expressed at high levels in the undifferentiated stromal compartment of human adipose tissue (the site of CYP19 expression), but not in differentiated adipocytes, and therefore represents a physiologically relevant regulator of estrogen biosynthesis in breast. PII-516 is a CYP19 promoter II/luciferase construct containing −516/−17 nucleotides of human CYP19 promoter II and has been described previously (12Michael M.D. Kilgore M.W. Morohashi K. Simpson E.R.

The nuclear receptor half-site at position −130 within this construct was mutated by PCR-directed mutagenesis (AGGTCA → AaaTCA) to produce pII-516mNRE. An expression construct encoding mouse LRH-1 (pCMX-LRH-1) was a generous gift from David Mangelsdorf (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The cDNA insert of pCMX-LRH-1 was subcloned into pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen) for use in in vitro transcription/translation reactions. pBIND (Promega) encodes amino acids 1–147 of yeast GAL4. To produce a GAL4/LRH-1 fusion construct in which the DBD and Ftz-F1 box of LRH-1 was replaced by the GAL4 DBD (pBIND-LRHΔ), the appropriate LRH-1 cDNA sequence was amplified by PCR from pCMX-LRH-1 and cloned into pBIND. PCR fidelity and correct reading frame of the resultant plasmid were confirmed by sequencing. The pSV-β vector (Promega) encodes full-length β-galactosidase and was used to correct for transfection efficiency. An expression construct encoding SF-1 was generously provided by Ken-ichirou Morohashi, (Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan). Human adipose stromal cells were isolated and cultured as described previously (46Ackerman G.E. Smith M.E. Mendelson C.R. MacDonald P.C. Simpson E.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Cells were serum-starved for 24 h prior to experimental treatment, after which luciferase and β-galactosidase activities of soluble cell extracts were measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and Galacto-light system (Tropix), respectively. Differentiation of cultured human preadipocytes was induced by a 3-day incubation in adipogenic medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (3%), Troglitazone (1 μm), insulin (10 nm), dexamethasone (1 μm), triiodothyronine (200 pm), and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (0.5 mm)). Cells were then incubated in adipogenic medium lacking 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine and Troglitazone for a further 9 days. Medium was changed every 3 days. Nuclear extracts were prepared from confluent adipose stromal cells by the method of Schreiber et al. (47Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were transcribed/translated in vitro using the TnT Quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). 5 μg of nuclear extract or 0.5 μl of translation product were incubated with 20,000 cpm of 32P-labeled probe for 15 min at room temperature in 20 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 50 μg/ml poly(dI·dC/dI·dC), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm dithiothreitol) before electrophoresis using a 5.4% polyacrylamide gel and 0.5 × TBE (final concentrations 44.5 mm Tris, 44.5 mm boric acid, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8.0) as running buffer for 3 h at 200 V. Gels were dried and radioactive complexes visualized by phosphorimaging. Where antibodies were included in the reaction (directed against LRH-1 or p65, SantaCruz), protein extract and antibody were preincubated on ice for 10 min before addition of probe. In some experiments protein extracts were heated to 37 °C for 3 min either before or after addition of probe. Protein lysates of human mammary fat and adipose stromal cells were generated using a lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and a Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (15 μg/lane), and transferred to nitrocellulose filter. Filters were probed with a CYP7A promoter binding factor (LRH-1) antibody (Santa Cruz), then stripped and re-probed with a β-tubulin antibody to confirm equal protein loading. Detection was by a ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA was prepared from freshly isolated mouse tissues or various cell lines using the QiaAMP RNA Blood Mini kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA synthesis from 250 ng of total RNA was performed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche) primed by random hexamers. PCR reactions were carried out using the following primer sets (all 5′ → 3′): LRH-1 (sense, CTG ATA CTG GAA CTT TTG AA; antisense, CTT CAT TTG GTC ATC AAC CTT); SF-1 (sense, TGC AGA ATG GCC GAC CAG; antisense, TGG CGG TAG ATG TGG TC); PPARγ (sense, ATT CTG GCC CAC CAA CTT TGG G; antisense, ATT GCC ATG AGC GAG TTG GAA GGC); CYP19 (sense, TTG GAA ATG GTC AAC CCG AT; antisense, CAG GAA TCT GCC GTG GGA GA); 18S (sense, CGG CTA CCA CAT CCA AGG AA; antisense, GCT GGA ATT ACC GCG GCT). Real-time PCR amplification of LRH-1 and 18S was performed on the LightCycler (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using SYBR Green reaction mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the primers described above. cDNA samples were diluted 1:20 in water immediately before use. Experimental samples were quantified by comparison with standards of known concentration (0.01–100 fg/μl). To identify receptors that could bind and activate promoter II through the NRE, 3T3L1 mouse preadipocytes were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter construct harboring 516 nucleotides of CYP19 promoter II (12Michael M.D. Kilgore M.W. Morohashi K. Simpson E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13561-13566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 45Michael M.D. Michael L.F. Simpson E.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 134: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and expression vectors encoding various nuclear receptors (Fig 1). Luciferase activity was not significantly altered by cotransfection with ERRα, NGFIB, Nurr1, Nor1 (Fig 1), or either ERα or ERβ in the presence or absence of ligand (not shown). In contrast, both SF-1 and LRH-1 stimulated promoter II activity 9- and 6-fold, respectively. Although the stimulatory effect of SF-1 on CYP19 promoter II in gonadal cells has been well characterized (38Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), the role of LRH-1 in CYP19 transcription has not previously been investigated. SF-1 and LRH-1 are expressed at high levels in steroidogenic tissues and liver, respectively. To address the possible roles of these receptors in the regulation of CYP19 in adipose tissue, we determined the expression profiles of each receptor in various cell lines and adipose tissue specimens (Fig. 2A). LRH-1 mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR in mouse adrenal and liver, human adrenal and liver cell lines (H295R and HepG2), the 3T3L1 mouse preadipocyte cell line, and the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. LRH-1 was also expressed in four out of four human adipose tissue specimens, and in four of four primary cultures of adipose stromal cells derived from different individuals. In contrast, expression of SF-1 mRNA was restricted to mouse adrenal and human adrenocortical H295R cells. We also investigated SF-1 and LRH-1 expression in human primary breast cancer tissue (Fig. 2B). All seven breast cancer specimens examined expressed LRH-1, whereas SF-1 was undetectable. Thus LRH-1, but not SF-1, is expressed in breast adipose and cancer tissues. To quantify LRH-1 mRNA expression in these tissues, we performed real-time PCR (Fig. 3A). Expressed as the ratio of LRH-1 molecules:18S molecules per μg of total RNA; LRH-1 expression in adipose tissue was ∼20% that of liver. However, the relative expression in primary cultured adipose stromal cells was much higher, ∼11-fold higher than in whole adipose tissue and 2.5-fold higher than in liver. LRH-1 protein was also readily detectable by Western blotting in isolated preadipocytes, but not in whole adipose tissue (Fig. 3B). Thus although LRH-1 mRNA levels in adipose tissue are relatively low compared with liver, LRH-1 expression is enriched in the adipose stromal cell compartment. This suggests that LRH-1, like CYP19, may be a marker of the undifferentiated preadipocyte phenotype. To test this hypothesis, primary cultured human preadipocytes were induced to differentiate into adipocytes by a 12-day incubation in adipogenic medium (Fig. 3C). Under such conditions lipid droplets became visible after 6 days, and by day 12 ∼50% of the cells exhibited abundant lipid accumulation (Fig. 3C, lower panel). The mature adipocyte phenotype was confirmed by a rapid and sustained expression of PPARγ (Fig. 3D, upper panel). LRH-1 mRNA was readily detectable in untreated preadipocytes but was dramatically reduced following 3 days of culture in adipogenic medium and undetectable at days 9 and 12.CYP19 mRNA expression also displayed a time-dependent decrease with progression of differentiation. Therefore, LRH-1 is expressed at high levels in human preadipocytes, but not mature adipocytes. Since this expression profile mirrors that of CYP19, LRH-1 is a potential physiological regulator of CYP19 expression in breast adipose stromal cells. Aromatase activity and CYP19 mRNA expression are strongly induced by prostaglandin E2 derived from breast cancer cells and/or macrophages infiltrating the tumor site (24Zhao Y. Agarwal V.R. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 61: 203-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PGE2 binds to EP1 and EP2 receptors linked to PKC and PKA signaling pathways, activation of which together maximally stimulates CYP19 expression via promoter II (24Zhao Y. Agarwal V.R. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 61: 203-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the effect of these pathways on LRH-1-induced CYP19 transcription, 3T3L1 cells were cotransfected with the CYP19 promoter II reporter construct and increasing concentrations of LRH-1 expression construct. Cells were then incubated in the presence or absence of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin and the PKC activator PMA for 8 h (Fig. 4). In the absence of stimulation, LRH-1 dose-dependently increased promoter II activity reaching a maximum of 3-fold over basal at 1.0 μg of LRH-1 plasmid. Treatment with forskolin and PMA increased basal promoter II activity 4-fold; however, in the presence of these agents LRH-1 strongly induced promoter II activity reaching a maximum of 30-fold at 1.0 μg of LRH-1. The synergistic effects of LRH-1 and FSK + PMA raised the possibility that LRH-1 contributes to PKA and/or PKC induction of promoter II. The primary amino acid sequence of LRH-1 contains several potential consensus PKA and PKC phosphorylation sites (PKA: Ser-32, Thr-142, Ser-382; PKC: Ser-32, Ser-126, Thr-154, Ser-350, Thr-512). To determine whether transactivation by LRH-1 can be directly modified by phosphorylation, we constructed a fusion construct in which the DNA binding domain of LRH-1 is replaced by the DBD of the yeast transcription factor GAL4. This fusion construct was transfected into 3T3-L1 cells along with a GAL4-responsive luciferase reporter gene, and cells treated with FSK and PMA, alone or in combination, for 16 h. As a control, we also treated 3T3-L1 cells transfected with pII-516 with these agents (Fig. 5A). Treatment with FSK increased activity of pII-516 ∼5-fold. PMA, while ineffective on its own, increased FSK-induced activity to 8.5-fold. These changes in activity of pII-516 mirror the effects of FSK and PMA on endogenous aromatase activity in adipose stromal cells (24Zhao Y. Agarwal V.R. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 61: 203-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 cells transfected with the GAL4 DBD and a GAL4-responsive luciferase reporter had low levels of luciferase activity that were not altered following treatment with FSK or PMA (Fig. 5B, upper panel). Luciferase activity in cells transfected with the GAL4 DBD/LRH-1 fusion construct were ∼15-fold higher; however, treatment with FSK or PMA, alone or in combination, did not further affect luciferase activity. Therefore, activity of LRH-1 is not regulated by PKA or PKC signaling pathways. Induction of expression from promoter II by PKA and PKC likely occurs through use of other hormone-sensitive cis-elements, for example the CRE-like element upstream from the NRE (45Michael M.D. Michael L.F. Simpson E.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 134: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) in the case of PKA, with LRH-1 functioning as a basal transcription or competence factor. This would be consistent with, and analogous to, the role of SF-1 in cAMP stimulation of promoter II"

Germline mutations can be attributed to tumorigenesis in 45% of families with a history of breast cancer and 90% of families with both breast and ovarian cancer. The penetrance is such that female carriers have an estimated 80% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer (1Venkitaraman A.R. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: R41-R47PubMed Google Scholar). As a tumor suppressor, BRCA1 exerts a pleiotropic effect, playing a role in the maintenance of genomic integrity. To this end, several functions have been ascribed to BRCA1 including double strand DNA break repair, transcription-coupled DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, and ubiquitin ligation (2Scully R. Livingston D.M. Nature. 2000; 408: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Despite implications in a diverse array of cellular pathways, the exact mechanism by which BRCA1 executes its function remains largely unknown. Within the first one hundred residues of BRCA1, which contains 20% of the biologically relevant mutations (3Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.C. Klevit R.E. Nature Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), lies a RING domain. RING fingers are “cross-brace” structures formed by conserved cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate two zinc ions (4Borden K.L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The RING finger motif has been well established to be able to mediate ubiquitin ligation, an activity intrinsic to a significant subset of the RING protein family. It does so by interacting with E21 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (5Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 6Chen A., Wu, K. Fuchs S.Y. Tan P. Gomez C. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) and thus constitutes one of the two classes of E3 ubiquitin ligases, the other being the HECT domain containing E3 ligases (8Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2896) Google Scholar). Traditionally, a RING E3 ubiquitin ligase interacts with both an E2, which has previously been charged with ubiquitin activated by an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, and a substrate to catalyze the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to the substrate. However, some RING fingers have been operationally defined as having ubiquitin ligase activity without substrates. It is common to test RING fingers by simply assaying for the E1- and E2-dependent formation of ubiquitin polymers. In these assays, there is the potential for heterogeneous reaction products. For example, it has been shown that RING fingers can mediate autoubiquitination (9Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar), E2 ubiquitination (10Skowyra D. Koepp D.M. Kamura T. Conrad M.N. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Science. 1999; 284: 662-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), and unanchored polyubiquitin chains free from any substrate (11Wu K. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Tan P. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1382-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)in vitro. When using ubiquitin as the only means by which to visualize the reaction products, it is difficult to discern among these possibilities. Furthermore, their biological significance is not well understood. There are some examples where the autoubiquitination of a RING finger protein, such as Mdm2, is involved in its turnover (9Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Whereas it is plausible that E2 ubiquitination might also be a means of regulating the abundance of the E2, this has not been rigorously investigated. Similarly, although significant amounts of free polyubiquitin chains have been detected in cells (12Van Nocker S. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24766-24773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), their role is unknown. Thus, some RING finger proteins, such as BRCA1, have been described as having ubiquitin ligase activity, although the nature and function of their reaction products remain unclear (5Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 13Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I.

Hunter T. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5134-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The ability of the RING in BRCA1 to confer ubiquitin ligase activity was first demonstrated using a RING-containing truncation of BRCA1. Furthermore, this activity was Zn2+-dependent (5Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), consistent with the requirement for a properly structured RING finger. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that this activity could be markedly enhanced when complexed with another RING finger protein, BARD1 (13Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The association between BRCA1 and BARD1 is the first example of a heterodimeric RING complex, interacting through residues adjacent to the RING structure (3Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.C. Klevit R.E. Nature Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 15Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A., Xu, X.L. Yang M.C. Hwang L.Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mutation of BARD1 is believed to be involved with similar tissue-specific tumors as is the mutation of BRCA1, namely of the breast and ovaries (16Thai T.H., Du, F. Tsan J.T. Jin Y. Phung A. Spillman M.A. Massa H.F. Muller C.Y. Ashfaq R. Mathias J.M. Miller D.S. Trask B.J. Baer R. Bowcock A.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Tumor-derived RING mutations in BRCA1 abolish the ubiquitin ligase activity of the BRCA1·BARD1 heterodimer without significantly affecting the interaction between the two proteins (3Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.C. Klevit R.E. Nature Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 13Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Moreover, the RING mutations in BRCA1 were found to be incompetent to protect cells containing inactive BRCA1 alleles from ionizing radiation as well as inadequate to restore a G2/M checkpoint, thus correlating the tumor suppression function of BRCA1 with its ubiquitin ligase activity (14Ruffner H. Joazeiro C.A.P. Hemmati D. Hunter T. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5134-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Additional evidence implicating BRCA1 function within the ubiquitin pathway is its interaction with a deubiquitinating enzyme, BAP1, through its RING domain (17Jensen D.E. Proctor M. Marquis S.T. Gardner H.P., Ha, S.I. Chodosh L.A. Ishov A.M. Tommerup N. Vissing H. Sekido Y. Minna J. Borodovsky A. Schultz D.C. Wilkinson K.D. Maul G.G. Barlev N. Berger S.L. Prendergast G.C. Rauscher III, F.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1097-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Also, the monoubiquitination of the Fanconi anemia protein subtype D2, FANCD2, has been connected with BRCA1. FANCD2 co-localizes with BRCA1 after ionizing radiation, and levels of its monoubiquitination are up-regulated in cells containing inactive BRCA1 alleles in the presence of exogenous BRCA1 and ionizing radiation (18Garcia-Higuera I. Taniguchi T. Ganesan S. Meyn M.S. Timmers C. Hejna J. Grompe M. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 249-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Fanconi anemia, a human autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cancer susceptibility, bears some resemblance to the phenotypes observed with BRCA1 mutations, displaying an increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (19Duckworth-Rysiecki G. Taylor A.M.R. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 416-420PubMed Google Scholar). However, important questions remain regarding the activity of the putative BRCA1·BARD1 E3 ligase. The most obvious issue is to identify substrates, because this may help better understand the mechanism by which BRCA1 elicits its function. Once the substrates have been defined, the type of ubiquitination that the substrate undergoes needs to be determined so as to understand the consequence of the modification. For example, the substrate may be polyubiquitinated for purposes of degradation or to serve as a signal, or it may be monoubiquitinated as in the case of FANCD2 and histones. Additionally, other alternatives need to be addressed, such as the actual E2 enzyme that BRCA1·BARD1 coordinates with in vivo as well as other potential small ubiquitin-like modifying molecules that may be employed by it. Here, we characterize the ubiquitin ligase activity of the BRCA1·BARD1 heterodimer. The monoubiquitination of histone H2A/H2AX can be mediated by BRCA1-(1–639)·BARD1 in vitro. The complex displays a robust autoubiquitination activity in vitro where non-lysine 48-linked chains can be polymerized, implying that these chains rather than target for degradation may serve an alternative role. FLAG-BRCA1 was subcloned into the pBose vector by engineering NotI sites flanking BRCA1. This then served as a template for the amplification of a fragment of BRCA1 encoding for amino acids 1–300 that was engineered to contain a 5′-BamHI site and a 3′-NotI site. The PCR product was then cloned in-frame into a modified pBose vector that contained sequences encoding for a GST tag. A detailed description and map can be given upon request. A fragment of BRCA1 encoding for residues 1–639 was amplified from the FLAG-BRCA1 construct using the primers 5′-AGCGGCCGCATGGATTTATCTGCTCTTCGCGTT-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCCAATTCAGTACAATTAGGTGGGCT-3′ where the 5′-primer contained a NotI site. The PCR product was then cloned into the pcDNA3.1 TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen). BRCA1-(1–639) was released with NotI digestion and subcloned into the pGEX4T3 vector (Amersham Biosciences), creating pGEX4T3·GST·BRCA1-(1–639). BARD1 was amplified from a BARD1-m1/pSP6 (15Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A., Xu, X.L. Yang M.C. Hwang L.Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat.

The PCR product was then cloned into the pCR3.1 UNI vector (Invitrogen). BARD1-FLAG was then released by XhoI digestion and subcloned into the pET29b vector (Novagen), creating pET29b-S-BARD1-FLAG. BARD1 was also amplified with the above 5′ primer and 5′-TCCTTTGAGTTGCTTCCTCTTGACAGCTGAGCGGCCGCAAAAGGAAAA-3′ followed by cloning of the PCR product into the pCR3.1 UNI vector, creating pCR3.1-BARD1. H2A was amplified from a human mammary epithelial cell line cDNA expression library (20Chan A.M. McGovern E.S. Catalano G. Fleming T.P. Miki T. Oncogene. 1994; 4: 1057-1063Google Scholar) using the primers 5′-CCATGGGCCATCATCATCATCATCACGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGATGTCTGGGCGTGGTAAGCAGG-3′ and 5′-CCAGGCCGTGCTGCTGCCAAAGAAAACTGAGAGCCACCACAAGGCGAAGGGCAAGTGAGGATCCCG-3′, where the 5′ primer contained a NcoI site as well as sequences encoding for six histidines and a FLAG epitope and the 3′ primer contained a BamHI site. The PCR product was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 TOPO TA vector. The His-FLAG-H2A was then released with NcoI/BamHI digestion and subcloned into pET15b (Novagen), creating pET15b-His-FLAG-H2A. His-FLAG-H2AX was created using the pcDNA3.1-His-FLAG-H2A as a template using the primers 5′-CATCCCATGGGCCATCATCATCATCATCACGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGATGTCTGGGCGTGGTAAGACTG-3′ and 5′-GAATTGCCCTTCGGGATCCTTAGTACTCCTGGGAGGCCTGGGTGGCCTTCTTGCCGCCCGAGGGCGCCTTCGGCCCCACGGTGGCGCTGGTCTTCTTGGGCAGCAGCAC-3′ where the 5′ primer contained a NcoI site and sequences encoding for six histidines and a FLAG epitope and the 3′ primer contained a BamHI site and sequences encoding for the C-terminal extension present in human histone H2AX. The PCR product was then cloned into the pcDNA3.1 TOPO TA vector. The His-FLAG-H2AX was then released with NcoI/BamHI digestion and subcloned into pET15b, creating pET15b-His-FLAG-H2AX. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Escherichia coliwere grown in LB with 0.4% glucose at 37 °C. When an optical density of 600 nm was reached, the cultures were induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were pelleted at 5000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 0.04 culture volume of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 μg/ml antipain, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). The suspension was then sonicated and centrifuged at 17,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. GST·BRCA1-(1–639)·S-BARD1-FLAG was expressed by transforming BL21(DE3) with the pGEX4T3·GST·BRCA1-(1–639) and the pET29b-S-BARD1-FLAG, which contain selectable markers for ampicillin and kanamycin, respectively. 293T cells in 100-mm plates were transfected using the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method (up to 20 μg). Where noted, cells were metabolically labeled 40–48 h post-transfection as described previously (6Chen A., Wu, K. Fuchs S.Y. Tan P. Gomez C. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15432-15439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and harvested. The pellets were resuspended in 0.2 ml/plate buffer B (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 μg/ml antipain, and 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin). The suspension was sonicated, and 0.3 ml/plate buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 μg/ml antipain, and 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin) was then added. The mixture was rotated for 1 h at 4 °C and cleared by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. Human E1, Cdc34, PK-His-HA-ubiquitin wild type, and a lysine to arginine substitution at residue 48, K48R, were prepared as previously described (21Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A., Wu, K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). For His-Ubc5c, E. coli transformed with pET3E-His-Ubc5c were grown, induced, and harvested as described above for GST-BARD1. The harvested cells were resuspended in 0.04 culture volume of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 μg/ml antipain, and 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin). The suspension was then sonicated and centrifuged at 17,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. The extracts (20 ml) were bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (1 ml) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads then were washed with 10 ml of lysis buffer and eluted with 10 ml of lysis buffer plus 20 mm imidazole followed by 10 ml of lysis buffer plus 60 mm imidazole. The eluants were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in buffer A (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 μg/ml antipain, and 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin) plus 100 mm NaCl followed by a concentration using a Mr 5000 cut-off filter (Millipore). Proteins were immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose or S-agarose beads as specified. The beads then were washed three times with an equal volume mixture of buffers B and C followed by two washes with buffer A plus 50 mm NaCl. For the [32P]ubiquitin reactions, a ubiquitination reaction mixture (30 μl) was added that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 10 nm okadaic acid, 2 mm ATP, 0.6 mmdithiothreitol, 3 μg of [32P]ubiquitin, 0.6 pmol of E1, and Ubc5c (0.15 μg for H2A/H2AX monoubiquitination unless otherwise indicated and 0.5 μg for BRCA1·BARD1 autoubiquitination) or Cdc34 (10 pmol). Ubiquitination reactions monitored by Western blot analysis contained reaction mixtures with unlabeled PK-ubiquitin (or PK-ubiquitin K48R) and without the NaF and okadaic acid. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h unless otherwise indicated. The reactions were stopped with 20 μl of 4-fold concentrated Laemmli loading buffer and boiled for 3 min prior to SDS-PAGE analysis followed by autoradiography or Western blot analysis. In an effort to efficiently generate complexes of BRCA1·BARD1, a truncated form of BRCA1, GST·BRCA1-(1–639), and S-BARD1-FLAG were co-expressed in E. coli. An approximately stoichiometric complex as judged by Coomassie Blue staining, was isolated (Fig. 1A, lane 1), in agreement with the recent solution structure of the BRCA1·BARD1 RING domain complex, which shows that the two proteins form a heterodimeric complex (3Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.C. Klevit R.E. Nature Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). A titration experiment showed that this complex was capable of catalyzing ubiquitin polymerization (Fig.1B, lanes 1–5) in an E2-dependent manner (lane 6). Note that at the highest level tested (lane 5), there was virtually a complete conversion of the free monomeric ubiquitin substrate to high molecular weight polyubiquitin species. Comparable levels of GST·BRCA1-(1–639) and GST-BARD1 alone did not exhibit any ubiquitin ligase activity (lanes 7 and 8), demonstrating the requirement of both proteins to achieve any notable levels of ubiquitin polymerization, consistent with previous studies (13Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Knowing that BRCA1 is recruited to sites of DNA damage (2Scully R. Livingston D.M. Nature. 2000; 408: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) and that it co-localizes with γ-H2AX (histone H2AX phosphorylated at serine 139) after DNA damage (22Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar), we tested histone H2A or H2AX, which is known to be monoubiquitinated, as potential substrate for the BRCA1·BARD1 ubiquitin ligase. Recombinant FLAG-H2A and FLAG-H2AX were used as substrates, and the reaction products were analyzed by Western blot analysis. In the presence of bacterially assembled BRCA1-(1–639)·BARD1, both FLAG-H2A and FLAG-H2AX were monoubiquitinated (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 4, denoted with anasterisk and a circle, respectively). Ubiquitination was completely dependent on the presence of BRCA1-(1–639)·BARD1 (lanes 2 and 5) as well as Ubc5c (lanes 3 and 6) and H2A/H2AX substrate proteins (lane 7). Additionally, neither BRCA1-(1–639) nor BARD1 alone activated the monoubiquitination of FLAG-H2A or FLAG-H2AX (lanes 8–11). These results demonstrate that BRCA1-(1–639)·BARD1 stimulated the Ubc5c-mediated monoubiquitination of histone H2A/H2AX in vitro. Importantly, this activity required the presence of both the truncated BRCA1 and BARD1. We next explored the possibility of autoubiquitination of BRCA1·BARD1. To address this, the bacterially assembled BRCA1-(1–639)·BARD1 was immobilized on an S-agarose matrix and incubated with E1, Ubc5c, and ubiquitin. The reaction products then were analyzed by Western blot. An α-GST immunoblot of the reaction showed high molecular weight GST-BRCA1-(1–639) species being formed that required Ubc5c and BRCA1-(1–639)·BARD1 (Fig.3A, lanes 1–3). This same blot when probed with α-FLAG demonstrated that BARD1 was also converted into high molecular weight species that were also dependent on the presence of Ubc5c and BRCA1-(1–639)·BARD1 (Fig.3B, lanes 1–3). To further verify that polyubiquitin chains were being assembled on to the BRCA1-(1–639)·BARD1 heterodimer, the same ubiquitination reaction was carried out, but the BRCA1·BARD1-immobilized matrix was washed prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. Thus, any ubiquitin remaining would presumably be covalently linked to BRCA1-(1–639)·BARD1. As the α-ubiquitin blot demonstrated, this was in fact the case (Fig.3C). These results demonstrated that both the truncated BRCA1 and BARD1 were ubiquitinated extensively. A kinetic analysis then was carried out to measure the rate with which the autoubiquitination reaction occurred. The BRCA1-(1–639)·BARD1-mediated ubiquitination reaction was terminated at various time points and analyzed by Western blot (Fig.4). A substantial reduction in unmodified GST·BRCA1-(1–639) was observed by 9 min, concomitant with an accumulation of high molecular weight species (Fig. 4A, lane 3). By 60 min, almost all of BRCA1-(1–639) was polyubiquitinated (lane 5). BARD1 reflected similar kinetics. Within 9 min, a significant amount of BARD1 was reduced, being converted into high molecular weight species (Fig. 4B, lane 3). Thus, the BRCA1-(1–639)·BARD1 heterodimer was capable of rapid and efficient autoubiquitination. The observation that the BRCA1-(1–639)·BARD1 heterodimer can autoubiquitinate seems counter-intuitive given that Joukov et al. (23Joukov V. Chen J. Fox E.A. Green J.B.A. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12078-12083Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) recently reported that the two proteins mutually stabilize each other. We considered the possibility that these chains assembled onto BRCA1-(1–639)·BARD1 may serve alternative functions other than targeting the heterodimer for proteasomal-mediated degradation. Because lysine 48-linked polyubiquitin chains are the principle signal that targets proteins for proteasomal degradation (24Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar), we tested whether BRCA1-(1–639)·BARD1 could assemble non-lysine 48-linked ubiquitin polymers. For this purpose, a ubiquitin mutant containing K48R was used in the autoubiquitination assay. The BRCA1-(1–639)·BARD1 heterodimer indeed formed polyubiquitin chains linked through lysine residues other than lysine 48 in a Ubc5c-dependent manner (Fig.5A, lanes 3 and 4). In addition, the efficiency with which chains were formed with ubiquitin K48R was comparable to that with the wild-type ubiquitin (compare lane 1 with lane 3). As shown in Fig. 5B, this ubiquitin K48R preparation when used in place of the wild-type ubiquitin was able to inhibit K48-linked polyubiquitin chain formation catalyzed by ROC1/CUL1, Cdc34, and E1 (compare lanes 3–5 with lanes 8–10). This is in keeping with our previous observations that ubiquitin K48R blocks the SCFHOS-ROC1-dependent Lys-48-mediated ubiquitination of IκBα (11Wu K. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Tan P. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1382-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) as well as substrate-free ubiquitin polymerization (21Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A., Wu, K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), thus establishing the feasibility of using this mutant ubiquitin to probe for non-Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chain formation. It has been reported that Ubc5c uses either lysine 48 or lysine 29 chains to synthesize ubiquitin polymers (25Mastrandrea L.D. You J. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 26You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Presumably, when the ubiquitin K48R was used, the majority of the non-lysine 48 chains were linked through lysine 29. These results suggest that the polyubiquitin chains assembled onto the BRCA1-(1–639)·BARD1 complex have the potential to serve as signals other than for degradation. We then sought to determine whether BRCA1·BARD1 assembled in mammalian cells could also exhibit this autoubiquitination activity. For this purpose, a truncated form of BRCA1, GST·BRCA1-(1–300), and BARD1 were co-expressed in 293T cells followed by metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine and cysteine. Glutathione beads were then used to isolate GST·BRCA1-(1–300) and its associated proteins, and the resulting matrix was incubated with E1, Ubc5c, and HA-ubiquitin. Following the reaction, the beads were washed, and the reaction products were analyzed by Western blot (Fig.6A) and autoradiography (Fig.6B). An α-HA immunoblot, recognizing the HA epitope on the recombinant ubiquitin, of the reaction showed that GST·BRCA1-(1–300) precipitates assembled polyubiquitin chains that required Ubc5c and GST·BRCA1-(1–300)·BARD1 (Fig. 6A, lanes 1–3). The same reaction products then were analyzed by autoradiography. An accumulation of 35S-high molecular weight species was evident in the complete reaction (Fig.6B, lane 1). Concomitantly, the amounts of both the unmodified GST·BRCA1-(1–300) and BARD1 were substantially reduced (compare lane 1 with lane 2). This conversion of both GST·BRCA1-(1–300) and BARD1 to high molecular weight species was dependent on the presence of Ubc5c and GST·BRCA1-(1–300)·BARD1 (lanes 2 and 3). These results confirmed that the BRCA1-(1–300)·BARD1 complex assembled in mammalian cells can autoubiquitinate, excluding the possibility that this activity was specific only to the bacterially assembled complex. To determine whether or not the observed autoubiquitination is abona fide activity, GST·BRCA1-(1–300), BARD1, and HA-ubiquitin were co-transfected in 293T cells. A GST pull-down assay of metabolically labeled extracts was performed, and the bound proteins were probed with a α-HA antibody. High molecular weight species, indicative of polyubiquitin chains, were only detected when both GST·BRCA1-(1–300)·BARD1 and HA-ubiquitin were transfected (Fig.7A). The same reaction products when analyzed by autoradiography demonstrated that similar amounts of GST·BRCA1-(1–300)·BARD1 were being expressed when transfected with HA-ubiquitin and when transfected alone (Fig.7B, lanes 1 and 2). Furthermore, the co-expression of GST and HA-ubiquitin did not yield any polyubiquitin chains that were associated with GST (data not shown). These resu"

MMP-2 is thought to be involved in cancer cell invasiveness. It has been proposed that the activity of MMP-2 can be modulated by intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS)/reactive nitrogen species. We hypothesized that manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) could mediate MMP-2 activity by changing the intracellular ROS level and that nitric oxide (⋅NO) may be involved in this process. Human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were stably transfected with plasmids containing MnSOD cDNA. A 2–30-fold increase of MnSOD protein and activity was observed in four clones. Our data demonstrated that overexpression of MnSOD stimulated the activation of MMP-2 with a corresponding elevation of ROS. A decrease in ROS by ebselen, a glutathione peroxidase mimetic, or by transduction of adenovirus containing human catalase or glutathione peroxidase cDNA abolished the effect of MnSOD on MMP-2 activation. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with antimycin A or rotenone increased intracellular ROS production and MMP-2 activation simultaneously. Our data also showed a suppression of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase expression that was accompanied by decreased ⋅NO production in MnSOD-overexpressing cells. However, the changes in endothelial nitric-oxide synthase and⋅NO did not correlate with the MnSOD activity. Corresponding changes of MMP-2 activity after the addition of a NOS inhibitor (N G-amino-l-arginine) or a⋅NO donor ((Z)-1-[(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate) to the cells suggested the possibility that ⋅NO may be involved in the MnSOD-mediated MMP-2 activation pathway. These results indicate that MnSOD induces MMP-2 activity by regulation of intracellular ROS and imply that signaling pathways involving ⋅NO may also be involved in the MnSOD mediation of MMP-2 activity.

Cancer metastasis is a multistep process that includes invasion of cancer cells into blood vessels, traveling of these cells in the circulation system, and proliferation and eventual formation of a metastatic tumor at distal tissues. Among these steps, the first step of cancer cell invasion is a critical point for cancer metastasis. A current hypothesis proposes that remodeling of the extracellular matrix is a required process for cancer cell invasion (1Lotta L.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1984; 117: 339-348PubMed Google Scholar, 2Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 541-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). The process of extracellular matrix remodeling happens in both normal physiological conditions and pathological diseases such as cancer invasion. Cancer invasion is a disordered and uncontrolled behavior that usually involves the interaction of tumor cells and their surrounding stromal cells, leading to the loss of matrix function and a compromised matrix boundary. Although several classes of proteases have been suggested in extracellular matrix remodeling, previous studies have demonstrated that the activation of zinc-dependent matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: MMPmatrix metalloproteinaseROSreactive oxygen speciesSODsuperoxide dismutaseDETA NONOate(Z)-1-[(2-aminoethyl]-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolateCATcatalaseGPxglutathione peroxidase(s)TEMEDN, N, N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamineNBTnitro blue tetrazoliumNOSnitric-oxide synthaseeNOSendothelial NOSDFHdihydrofluoresceinDAdiacetateWTwild typeMOImultiplicity of infection1The abbreviations used are: MMPmatrix metalloproteinaseROSreactive oxygen speciesSODsuperoxide dismutaseDETA NONOate(Z)-1-[(2-aminoethyl]-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolateCATcatalaseGPxglutathione peroxidase(s)TEMEDN, N, N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamineNBTnitro blue tetrazoliumNOSnitric-oxide synthaseeNOSendothelial NOSDFHdihydrofluoresceinDAdiacetateWTwild typeMOImultiplicity of infection was the primary response for the degradation of components of the extracellular matrix (3Birkedal-Hansen H.

MMP-2 (also called gelatinase A-type IV collagenase) and MMP-9 (geletinase B-type IV collagenase), two members of the MMP family, were postulated to play a critical role in tumor invasion. Lotta et al. have shown that the activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were higher in human breast cancer than the premalignant or normal breast tissue (1Lotta L.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1984; 117: 339-348PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in an experimental metastatic model, Stetler-Stevenson (5Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1990; 9: 289-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) has concluded that the protein level and activity of both enzymes were correlated with the metastatic potential of tumor cells. MMPs share similar mechanisms of activation and protease function. The regulation of MMP activation occurs at both mRNA and/or protein levels. For example, transforming growth factor-β1 increases progelatinase mRNA levels in human fibroblasts (6Overall C.M. Wrana J.L. Sodek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14064-14071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, most MMPs are secreted as zymogens upon translation. Post-translational modification is required for MMP activation to acquire the proteolytic function. Previously, oxidation and oxidative stress have been implicated in the regulation of MMP activation. Increases in MMP-2 mRNA level and enzymatic activity were seen following xanthine/xanthine oxidase (X/XO) treatment (7Siwik D.A. Pagano P.J. Colucci W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C53-C60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ionizing radiation (8Zhao W. O'Malley Y.Q. Wei S. Robbins M.E.C. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 2000; 76: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is well known that both the X/XO system and radiation produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide. In fact, hydrogen peroxide has also been shown to increase the steady-state mRNA levels of collegenase/MMP-1 in human dermal fibroblasts (9Brenneisen P. Briviba K. Wlaschek M. Wenk J. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). ROS are molecules that have higher reactivity than ground state dioxygen. ROS are constantly produced in vivo and cleared by cellular antioxidant systems. During normal physiological conditions, limited amounts of ROS may serve as signaling molecules in cell regulation pathways. However, an imbalance between production and removal of ROS can lead to oxidative stress due to the accumulation of these molecules. The consequences of intracellular oxidative stress include structural alterations of macromolecules, such as proteins causing enzymatic activation or inactivation, and disturbance in cellular signal transduction pathways that may stimulate or suppress gene expression. The intrinsic antioxidant enzymes are essential for the protection of cells from oxidative stress. There are at least three families of primary antioxidant enzymes in mammalian cells. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) catalyze the conversion of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide, which is removed by catalase (CAT) or one of the glutathione peroxidases (GPx). Previously, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a mitochondrial form of SOD, has been suggested as a tumor suppressor (10Bravard A. Sabatier L. Hoffschir F. Ricoul M. Luccioni C. Dutrillaux B. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 51: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and it is generally found at lower levels in tumors than in their normal cell counterparts (11Oberley L.W. Buettner G.R.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, recent studies using immunohistochemistry have advanced our knowledge of the relationship of MnSOD and tumors. Several reports have shown that despite generally low levels of MnSOD in the center of solid tumor nests, there appeared to be very intense MnSOD staining in a few tumor cells located at the leading edge or outside layers of tumors adjacent to benign epithelium in breast and prostate tumors (17Thomas P.A.

In addition, MnSOD expression is increased in metastatic gastric cancer (19Malafa M. Margenthaler J. Webb B. Neitzel L. Christophersen M. J. Surg. Res. 2000; 88: 130-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In a recent study, Lam et al. (20Lam E.W. Zwacka R. Seftor E.A. Nieva D.R. Davidson B.L. Engelhardt J.E. Hendrix M.J. Oberley L.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) found that overexpression of MnSOD by adenovirus gene transfer in hamster squamous carcinoma cells stimulated tumor cell invasive capacity as measured by the invasion chamber analysis. The fact that this elevation was abolished by adenovirus catalase suggested the involvement of ROS and particularly by hydrogen peroxide in the process of tumor invasion. Therefore, we speculated that elevation of MnSOD without change of CAT and/or GPx would lead to the accumulation of peroxides and oxidative stress. The generated ROS and oxidative stress, in turn, could stimulate tumor invasiveness by an increase of MMP activation. The aim of this research was to the study of the effects of MnSOD on MMP-2 activation in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. We hypothesized that MnSOD mediates MMP-2 activation by changing intracellular ROS levels. Furthermore, because nitric oxide (⋅NO) is closely related to the ROS level by its direct reaction with superoxide, we further hypothesized that ⋅NO may be involved in the regulation of MMP-2 activity by MnSOD. Our results using MnSOD-overexpressing human breast cancer MCF-7 cells clearly demonstrated that MnSOD stimulated the activation of MMP-2. In addition, our data strongly suggested that ROS might be mediators for MMP-2 activation by MnSOD. Moreover, these data implied the possibility that ⋅NO might also be involved in this pathway. Nonessential amino acids and trypsin/EDTA were from the University of Iowa Cancer Center. Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone Laboratories Inc. Eagle's minimum essential medium and Geneticin (G418) were from Life Technologies, Inc. Sodium pyruvate, rotenone, antimycin A, xanthine, xanthine oxidase, goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, β-mercaptoethanol, bovine serum albumin, and TEMED were from Sigma. Nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) was from Pierce. Riboflavin and the protein assay solution were from Bio-Rad. Nitrocellulose membranes were acquired from Schleicher & Schuell Co. Mouse antibodies against human nitric-oxide synthases (eNOS, inducible NOS, and neuronal NOS) were from Transduction Laboratories. The chemiluminescent ECL kit was fromAmersham Biosciences. TiterMax Gold was from CytRX Co. Dihydrofluorescein diacetate (DFH-DA) was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Ebselen was from Cayman Chemical Co. DETA NONOate and N G-amino-l-arginine were from Alexis Co. Human breast MCF-7 cancer cells were stably transfected with control (Neo) vector or MnSOD cDNA. Two different forms of MnSOD cDNA were used to generate clones with different MnSOD activities as described in detail previously (15Zhang H.J. Yan T. Oberley T.D. Oberley L.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6276-6283PubMed Google Scholar). Two different amino acids (either Ile or Thr) at position 58 of MnSOD resulted in two MnSOD proteins with different activities. The Ile form of MnSOD had 3 times the activity of the Thr form of MnSOD. The parental MCF-7 cells (WT), vector control cells (Neo), and four clones (SOD15, Mn52, Mn11, and Mn40) of MnSOD transfectants were routinely cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Media were changed every 3–4 days, and cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. G418 was constantly present in the media for Neo- and MnSOD-overexpressing cells at a concentration of 400 μg/ml. Five days before an analysis, cells were then placed in culture medium without G418 supplement. Replication-defective recombinant adenovirus type 5 with the E1 region substituted with human CAT (AdCAT) or GPx (AdGPx) cDNA were provided by the Vector Core Facility of the University of Iowa. The infectious units of the adenovirus were typically at 1 × 1010 plaque-forming units/ml. Twenty-four h before adenovirus transduction, 5 × 106or 5 × 103 cells were subcultured into a 60-mm dish or an eight-well chamber slide. At the time of infection, old media were replaced by fresh full media containing adenovirus at the designated multiplicity of infection (MOI). The cells were incubated with adenovirus for 24 h and then replaced by fresh media for an additional 24 h before being processed for assays. Control cells were treated by adenovirus containing empty vector (cytomegalovirus promoter only) (AdCMV) simultaneously with treatment groups. Twenty-four h before a treatment, 5 × 106 or 5 × 103 cells were subcultured into a 60-mm dish or an eight-well chamber slide. At the time of treatment, old media were replaced by fresh full media containing chemicals at the designated concentration. Twenty-four h after a treatment, media were either changed again to full media without chemical supplements or processed for an assay immediately. For treatments with antimycin A and rotenone, control cells were incubated with media containing a similar concentration of vehicle solution (0.01% Me2SO). In the situation where a ⋅NO donor was used, a decomposed chemical solution was made by incubating the ⋅NO donor solution at 37 °C for a period of at least 10 half-lives. Then it was added to the media in the same manner as the treatment group and served as control. The procedures for protein sample preparation were performed on ice. Cells were washed three times in cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping and centrifugation. The cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) and sonicated with four bursts of 30 s each using a Vibra Cell sonicator with a cup horn at full power. Total protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay using bovine γ–globulin as a standard. Pure human recombinant MnSOD protein was the kind gift from Dr. Joe McCord (University of Colorado). Rabbit anti–human MnSOD antibody was made in our laboratory. TiterMax Gold was used as adjuvant. One hundred fifty μg of MnSOD protein in 100 μl saline was mixed with 100 μl of the adjuvant and injected into the thigh of a female rabbit. After three boost injections, serum was collected and examined for MnSOD titer by Western blotting analysis. When a desired titer was reached, the rabbit was sacrificed, and serum was collected. Equal amounts of total protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel according to the method of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 5% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS). The nitrocellulose membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with an antibody (1:1000) specific for the proteins of interest. After three washings with TTBS, the membranes were incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000) in TTBS for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were stained by the chemiluminescent ECL method, and immunoreactive signals were visualized by exposure to a x-ray film. SOD activity was measured by the modified NBT method described by Spitz and Oberley (22Spitz D.R. Oberley L.W. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). This is an indirect assay based on a competition reaction between SOD and the superoxide indicator molecule, NBT. The rate of increase in the absorption at 560 nm over a 5-min time period indicates the reduction of NBT by superoxide. The competitive inhibition of this reaction is an indicator of total SOD activity. In the assay, the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system was used to generate superoxide. Varying amounts of total protein were added to the reaction until maximal inhibition was obtained as determined by spectrophotometry. Total SOD activity was determined by the amount of protein necessary for half-maximal inhibition of the NBT reaction. MnSOD activity was quantified in the presence of 5 mm NaCN, which only inhibits copper- and zinc-containing (CuZnSOD) activity. One unit of activity was defined as the concentration of SOD that reduced the NBT reaction to one-half of the maximum. The native activity gel assay was used to measure the activity of SOD, CAT, and GPx. Total protein of each sample was separated in a native 8% polyacrylamide gel. For the SOD activity staining, as described by Beauchamp and Fridovich (23Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (9842) Google Scholar), the gel was incubated with 2.43 mm NBT, 28 μm riboflavin, and 28 mm TEMED for 20 min in the dark. After exposing the gel to a fluorescent light, the achromatic bands corresponding to SOD activity appeared on a dark blue background. For the CAT activity staining (24Sun Y. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1988; 5: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the gel was first rinsed in distilled water three times and then incubated in 0.003% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. The gel was then stained with 2% ferric chloride and 2% potassium ferricyanide. When achromatic bands demonstrating CAT activity appeared, the staining solution was replaced, and the gel was washed extensively with distilled water. The procedure for GPx activity staining was essentially the same as the CAT staining except that distilled water was replaced by 1 mm glutathione, and 0.008% cumene hydroperoxide was used as the substrate (24Sun Y. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1988; 5: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Intracellular ROS level was determined by measuring the oxidation of DFH-DA. DFH-DA is a nonpolar and nonfluorescent compound that can permeate cells freely. Once it is inside cells, the diacetate bond is cleaved by cellular esterases to form the polar and nonfluorescent DFH. Upon oxidation by ROS, this compound gives rise to DF that yields fluorescence. Five thousand cells were seeded 48 h prior the measurement and processed for treatments. At the time of the analysis, cells were washed three times with Hanks' buffer and then incubated with 500 μl of 5 μm DFH-DA solution for 15 min. After the incubation, cells were washed three times with Hanks' buffer and mounted with cover slides. Finally, the intensity of the fluorescence at 485/530 was recorded under a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser-scanning confocal microscope. MMP-2 activity was measured by zymography. Zymography is a powerful electrophoretic technique for identifying proteolytic activity of enzymes separated in polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions (25Seftor R.E.B. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To estimate the proteolytic activity of MMP-2, 1 mg/ml gelatin A was prepolymerized in a polyacrylamide gel as substrate. Proteins in 10 μl of conditioned serum-free medium were first separated electrophoretically at a constant voltage of 80 V for 2 h in the gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed in a buffer containing 2.5% Triton X-100 and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 2 × 30 min. The gel was then incubated overnight with a developing buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 10 mmCaCl2·2H2O, 50 mm NaCl, and NaN3 at 37 °C before it was stained with 0.25% Coomassie Blue in 25% isopropyl alcohol, 10% acetic acid for 30 min. The gel was destained in a destaining buffer with 10% methanol and 10% acetic acid until the wash remained clean and the achromatic bands appeared on the blue background. The gel was dried, scanned, and documented with an Epson Perfection 1200U scanner. A Sievers 280 nitric oxide analyzer was used to measure the amount of ⋅NO produced by the cells.⋅NO once produced by cells in culture is quickly oxidized to nitrite. To measure this nitrite, the purge vessel contained a reducing agent (1% potassium iodine in glacial acetic acid) to convert nitrite to ⋅NO. The ⋅NO produced was swept into the nitric oxide analyzer, where it reacts with ozone, forming electronically excited nitrogen dioxide. The associated emission is proportional to the amount of ⋅NO present in the sample. The amount of ⋅NO made by the cells was determined by integrating the emission signal over time and was calibrated using known amounts of nitrite as a source of⋅NO. The cells were rinsed with 5 ml of Hanks' buffer (37 °C). Then 3 ml of Hanks' buffer was added to the cells, and base-line nitric oxide production was determined. The cells were incubated for 3 h. After each hour, the amount of nitric oxide produced was measured. The levels of nitric oxide after 1, 2, and 3 h were used to determine the amount of ⋅NO produced per hour. After all ⋅NO measurements, the cells were scraped from the flasks and centrifuged. The cell pellets were resuspended in a phosphate buffer and stored at −80 °C for protein concentration estimation. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Analysis of variance-Tukey's multiple comparison was used to determine the statistical significance of the data at a level of p ≤ 0.05. All of the data were from the average of at least three independent experiments. In the case of Western blotting, activity gels, and DFH staining, representative results that were repeated at least three times with similar results are shown. In this study, four MnSOD-overexpressing cell lines were used. These cell lines are SOD15, Mn52, Mn11, and Mn40. Their MnSOD expression along with those of WT and Neo vector control cells was verified previously (15Zhang H.J. Yan T. Oberley T.D. Oberley L.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6276-6283PubMed Google Scholar). During this study, the levels of MnSOD in these cell lines were confirmed to ensure that there were no changes during cell culture (Fig. 1). Western analysis demonstrated increases in MnSOD protein levels in MnSOD overexpression cells when compared with WT and Neo cells (Fig. 1 A). No changes were noted in β-actin expression, and it served as protein loading control. SOD15 was transfected with the Thr58 form of MnSOD cDNA, which yielded a large increase in MnSOD protein but only a small elevation in activity level (Fig. 1, B and C). This observation was consistent with our previous report (15Zhang H.J. Yan T. Oberley T.D. Oberley L.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6276-6283PubMed Google Scholar). Mn52, Mn11, and Mn40 were transfected with the Ile58form of MnSOD and showed 6-, 19-, and 30-fold increases in MnSOD activity, respectively. The activities of CuZnSOD, CAT, and GPx were also measured. No significant changes were noted among all cell lines (data not shown). To study the effects of MnSOD on MMP-2 activation, MCF-7 cells overexpressing MnSOD were assayed for MMP-2 activation by zymography. Fig. 2 A shows that MMP-2 activity was elevated as the MnSOD levels increased. The brightest band, representing the highest MMP-2 activity, was seen in Mn40 cells that had the highest MnSOD activity. Correspondingly, the levels of intracellular ROS in these cells were also elevated, with the Mn40 cell line being the highest as measured by DFH fluorescent staining (Fig. 2 B). To test the causal effect of ROS on the activation of MMP-2 by MnSOD, different concentrations of ebselen, a GPx mimic, were used to treat Mn40 cells. ROS levels and MMP-2 activity were measured after the treatment. A decrease in DFH fluorescence was observed in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 A, i). At an ebselen concentration of 50 μm, a marked reduction of DFH fluorescence was detected. Moreover, at a concentration of 100 μm, complete inhibition was seen. Zymographic analysis of the conditioned media from the same cells demonstrated dramatic reduction in MMP-2 activity after 50 and 100 μm ebselen treatment (Fig. 3 A, ii), which is directly related to the suppression of ROS in these cells. Cell viability was measured after ebselen treatment by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and cell death was not observed (data not shown). Because ebselen has also been shown to scavenge other oxidants, specifically peroxynitrite, more specific approaches were used. Recombinant adenovirus containing human CAT or GPx cDNA were applied to Mn40 cells at 0, 5, 10, 25, and 50 MOI. The activities of CAT and GPx along with ROS levels and the activation of MMP-2 were examined after the transduction. As shown in Fig. 3 B, Mn40 cells, which have a low level of endogenous CAT activity, exhibit increased levels of CAT activity after AdCAT transduction (Fig. 3 B, i). Accompanying the increases in CAT activity, a moderate decrease of DFH staining (Fig 3 B, ii) and a clear suppression of MMP-2 activity (Fig. 3 B, iii) were observed. AdGPx was also transduced into Mn40 cells to study the role of ROS in MMP-2 activation. Fig. 3 C demonstrates the results from the AdGPx transduction. Mn40 cells, which had undetectable endogenous GPx activity, clearly had dose-dependent increases in GPx activity, with the highest activity after 50 MOI AdGPx transduction (Fig. 3 C, i). Conversely, the DFH fluorescence was decreased in a dose-dependent manner and to a very low level after 50 MOI AdGPx transduction (Fig. 3 C, ii). More dramatically, the suppression of MMP-2 activation was evidenced after application of as little as 10 MOI AdGPx and was dose-dependent in correlation with the DFH fluorescence (Fig. 3 C, iii). To further demonstrate that ROS stimulate the activation of MMP-2, MCF-7 WT and Neo cells were incubated with either antimycin A or rotenone. Both antimycin A and rotenone are cellular electron transport chain inhibitors that increase electron leakage from the electron transport chain,"

NTE has homologues in Drosophila and yeast and is detected in vitro by assays with a non-physiological ester substrate, phenyl valerate. We report that NEST, the recombinant esterase domain of NTE (residues 727–1216) purified from bacterial lysates, can catalyze hydrolysis of several naturally occurring membrane-associated lipids. The active site regions of NEST and calcium-independent phospholipase A2(iPLA2) share sequence similarity, and the phenyl valerate hydrolase activity of NEST is inhibited by low concentrations of iPLA2 inhibitors. However, on incubation with NEST, fatty acid was liberated only extremely slowly from the sn-2 position of phospholipids (Vmax ∼0.01 μmol/min/mg and Km ∼0.4 mm for 1-palmitoyl, 2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine). Comparison of the NEST-mediated generation of 14C-labeled products from two differentially labeled 14C-phospholipid substrates suggested that a rate-limiting sn-2 cleavage was followed very rapidly by hydrolysis of the resulting lysophospholipid. Among the various naturally occurring lipids tested with NEST, lysophospholipids were by far the most avidly hydrolyzed substrates (Vmax ∼20 μmol/min/mg and Km ∼0.05 mm for 1-palmitoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine). NEST also catalyzed the hydrolysis of monoacylglycerols, preferring the 1-acyl to the 2-acyl isomer (Vmax ∼1 μmol/min/mg and Km ∼0.4 mm for 1-palmitoylglycerol).

Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 61-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The NTE homologue in Drosophila, the swiss cheese protein, is essential for fly brain development (2Kretzschmar D. Hasan G. Sharma S. Heisenberg M. Benzer S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7425-7432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the mouse, NTE is present in neurons from their earliest appearance in the nervous system and so is well placed to play a similar role in mammalian neural development (3Moser M. Stempfl T., Li, Y. Glynn P. Buettner R. Kretzschmar D. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). NTE also has a homologue in yeast (4Lush M.J., Li, Y. Read D.J. Willis A.C. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), suggesting that it has functions beyond the nervous system and mediates a biochemical reaction highly conserved through evolution. neuropathy target esterase dioleoylphosphatidic acid dioleoylphosphatidylcholine dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol calcium-independent phospholipase A2 lysophosphatidylcholine methyl arachidonoyl fluorophosphonate NTE esterase domain phosphatidylcholine trifluoromethyl ketone 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid In keeping with its reactivity with organophosphates, NTE belongs to the serine hydrolase class of enzymes. Since its discovery more than 30 years ago (5Johnson M.K. Biochem. J. 1969; 114: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), NTE has been detected in vitro by assays with non-physiological ester substrates, most commonly with phenyl valerate (6Johnson M.K. Arch. Toxicol. 1977; 37: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Clues to the cellular functions of NTE might be provided by identifying its natural substrate. Data on this point are sparse, but using artificial substrates, NTE activity in brain homogenates has been shown to catalyze hydrolysis of ester rather than peptide or amide bonds (7Johnson M.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 24: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 8Johnson M.K. Rev. Biochem. Toxicol. 1982; 4: 141-212Google Scholar). In addition, inhibition of the phenyl valerate hydrolase activity of NTE by a homologous series of alkyl saligenin cyclic phosphonates (9Wu S.-Y. Casida J.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and alkyl-thiotrifluoromethyl ketones (10Thomas T.C. Szekas A. Rojas S. Hammock B.D. Wilson B.W. MacNamee M.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 2587-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) suggests that the active site of the enzyme has a preference for esters of carboxylic acids with an alkyl chain length of at least 9–10 carbon atoms (1Glynn P. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 61-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This hints that the natural substrate of NTE may be an ester of a fatty acid, such as a phospholipid or an acylglycerol. Human NTE is a polypeptide of 1327 residues and has two major domains (4Lush M.J., Li, Y. Read D.J. Willis A.C. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) as follows: a C-terminal catalytic domain containing the active site serine residue (Ser-966) that reacts with organophosphates and phenyl valerate; and an N-terminal putative regulatory domain that contains sequences similar to cyclic AMP-binding proteins. We have expressed in Escherichia coli a recombinant protein (corresponding to NTE residues 727–1216) called NEST which composes the esterase domain of NTE (11Atkins J. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24477-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). NEST is very hydrophobic, and the purified protein must be incorporated into phospholipid liposomes to acquire a conformation with full phenyl valerate hydrolase activity (12Atkins J. Luthjens L.H. Hom M.L. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 119-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this respect, NEST appears similar to enzymes such as cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (13Dessen A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and triacylglycerol lipase (14Derewenda Z.S. Sharp A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 20-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) which show the phenomenon of interfacial activation,i.e. they exhibit full catalytic activity only when at a lipid-water interface. Here, we use NEST to investigate the possibility that NTE has lipase- or phospholipase-A-like activity with membrane-associated lipids as its potential substrates. 1-Palmitoyl, 2-oleoyl-[oleoyl-1-14C]phosphatidylcholine (52 mCi/mmol) and dioleoyl-[dioloeoyl-1-14C]phosphatidylcholine (104 mCi/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP), 2-arachidonoylglycerol, anandamide, and N-oleoylethanolamine were from CN Biosciences; bromoenol lactone and arachidonoyl trifluoromethyl ketone (−TFMK) were from Affiniti. All other lipid substrates, putative lipase inhibitors, and bee venom secretory phospholipase A2 were purchased from Sigma. Lipid substrates were prepared by evaporating chloroform solutions under a stream of nitrogen gas and then resuspending the residue in PEN buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.8) by sonication (MSE Sanyo Soniprep 150 probe sonicator) at maximum power for 10 min to give stock suspensions at a concentration of 5 mm. Free fatty acid assay kit (half-micro test) was from Roche Diagnostics. The sources of all other materials have been described previously (11Atkins J. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24477-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). NEST (human NTE residues 727–1216 with N-terminal T7 and C-terminal His6 tags) was expressed in E. coli BL21 pLysS, extracted, and isolated by nickel chelate and gel filtration chromatography in solutions containing CHAPS as described previously (11Atkins J. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24477-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). NEST, with its catalytic serine residue mutated to alanine (11Atkins J. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24477-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), was expressed and isolated in identical fashion. Before assaying its phenyl valerate hydrolase activity, purified NEST was diluted with 0.3% CHAPS to a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, mixed with dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC; 10 mg/ml in 10% (w/v) CHAPS) in a ratio of 1:4 (w/w), and then dialyzed overnight at room temperature against PEN buffer. Phenyl valerate hydrolase activity was determined by the method of Johnson (6Johnson M.K. Arch. Toxicol. 1977; 37: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) as described previously (11Atkins J. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24477-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Purified NEST-DOPC complexes were diluted in 50 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA to a protein concentration of 20–80 ng/ml and then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with inhibitors before addition of phenyl valerate in Triton X-100 (final concentrations of 1.4 and 0.24 mm, respectively) and incubation for a further 20 min. NEST lipase activity was assayed by determining the liberation of free fatty acid from various lipid substrates. For lysophospholipids and monoacylglycerols, incubations contained 2.5 mm substrate, NEST (0.1–3.0 μg of protein), and 2.4 mm CHAPS in a final volume of 0.05 or 0.1 ml of PEN buffer. For diacylphospholipids and all other putative lipid substrates 2.0 mm substrate was incubated with 25 μg of NEST, 3.2 mm CHAPS in a final volume of 0.5 ml of PEN buffer. Incubations were at 37 °C and were terminated at the times indicated in the figures (including zero time) by addition of MAFP to a final concentration of 20 μm. Free fatty acid was determined using a kit from Roche Diagnostics based on the coupled enzyme assay of Shimizu et al. (15Shimizu S. Tani Y. Yamada H. Tabata M. Murachi T. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Zero time values (i.e. MAFP added before NEST) were subtracted from values determined at all subsequent time points. Data shown are the means of at least two separate experiments. For more detailed evaluation of phospholipase A2 activity,14C-labeled phospholipids (∼0.4 × 106dpm) were incubated at 37 °C with NEST (8–20 μg) in 0.05 ml of PEN buffer containing 2–4 mm CHAPS. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.1 ml of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (2:1:0.02), and after vortexing and centrifugation, the organic phase solvent was evaporated, and the residue was redissolved in ethanol containing oleic acid (20 mg/ml). Aliquots were subjected to thin layer chromatography on Silica G plates run in hexane/ether/acetic acid (80:20:1). In this system, fatty acids are well resolved from phosphatidylcholine (PC) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) which remain very close to the origin. Spots containing either phospholipid or fatty acid were scraped into scintillation vials, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting (16Reynolds L.J. Washburn W.N. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 3-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To resolve [14C]LPC, samples (mixed with unlabeled 1-oleoyl-LPC) were run on Silica G plates in chloroform/methanol/formic acid/water (60:30:8:2) (17Yokoyama K. Fuzuki S. Setaka M. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 142-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, LPC has an RF∼0.5, whereas PC and fatty acids co-migrate near the solvent front. A BLAST search identified significant sequence similarity (28% identity) between an ∼160-residue region of NEST and calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2; Fig. 1). Among key conserved residues in both proteins were those corresponding to the active site serine (Ser-966) and two aspartates (Asp-960 and Asp-1086) shown previously to be essential for the phenyl valerate hydrolase activity of NEST (11Atkins J. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24477-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Outside this region there was no homology between NTE and iPLA2 (Fig. 1). We investigated whether compounds reported to be potent inhibitors of iPLA2 would also inhibit phenyl valerate hydrolase activity of NEST-DOPC preparations. Bromoenol lactone inhibits iPLA2with an IC50 value (after a 5-min preincubation) of 60 nm (18Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Under standard conditions for assay of NEST-DOPC phenyl valerate hydrolase activity (see “Experimental Procedures”), we determined an IC50 value of 94 ± 20 nm (n = 5) for bromoenol lactone. MAFP inhibits iPLA2 with an IC50 in the submicromolar range (19Lio Y.-C. Reynolds L.J. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and NEST-DOPC phenyl valerate hydrolase activity with an IC50 of 2.0 ± 0.9 nm (n = 3). Finally, micromolar concentrations of two trifluoromethyl ketones (TFMK) inhibit iPLA2 activity, with palmitoyl-TFMK 4 times more potent than arachidonoyl-TFMK (18Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). These two compounds also inhibited NEST-DOPC phenyl valerate hydrolase activity but, in contrast to iPLA2, arachidonoyl-TFMK (IC50 = 2.5 μm; n = 2) was 10 times more potent than palmitoyl-TFMK (IC50 = 28 μm;n = 2). Inhibition of the phenyl valerate hydrolase activity of NEST-DOPC preparations by fatty acid TFMKs led us to ask whether fatty acids themselves would be inhibitory. Preincubating NEST-DOPC with 50 μm oleic acid abolished phenyl valerate hydrolase activity, whereas palmitic and arachidonic acids at this concentration had marginal (25% inhibition) or no effect, respectively (Fig. 2a). Similarly, palmitate and arachidonate at concentrations of 30 μm did not inhibit iPLA2, although this study did not report the effect of oleic acid (18Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). As free fatty acid and lysophospholipid are the products of PLA2 activity, we examined possible effects of lysophospholipids on NEST-DOPC phenyl valerate hydrolase activity by preincubating with the enzyme before addition of substrate: 1-palmitoyl-LPC was inhibitory with an IC50 value of ∼15 μm, and an alkyl ether analogue, 1-O-hexadecyl-LPC, was even more potent with an IC50 < 7.5 μm (Fig. 2b). By contrast, 1-O-hexadecyl, 2-arachidonoyl-PC had only a marginal effect (Fig. 2b). To investigate the nature of the inhibition of phenyl valerate hydrolase activity of NEST-DOPC by oleic acid and lysophospholipids, we directly added these inhibitors to assays in the presence of varying concentrations of phenyl valerate substrate (Fig. 3). Oleic acid was much less potent as an inhibitor when added direct to the assay (Fig. 3a) than when preincubated with the enzyme before addition of substrate (cf. Fig. 2a). For example, in the presence of the standard concentration of phenyl valerate (1.4 mm), 50 μm oleic acid caused only ∼15% inhibition, increasing to ∼45% inhibition in the presence of 0.35 mm phenyl valerate (Fig. 3a). By contrast, LPC was almost as potent when added direct to the assay as when preincubated and at 25 μm caused 50% inhibition in the presence of 1.4 mm phenyl valerate (Fig. 3b). Lineweaver-Burk (1/v versus 1/s) transformations (not shown) of the data of the type in Fig. 3 were readily fit to straight lines allowing determination of kinetic values for phenyl valerate substrate (Vmax = 4.82 ± 0.52 mmol/min/mg;Km = 0.76 ± 0.09 mm;n = 5). However, in the presence of either oleic acid or LPC, Lineweaver-Burk plots intersected the y axis at a lower value than in the absence of these inhibitors, suggesting an increase in Vmax. It is notable that preincubation of NEST-DOPC with 10 μm fatty acid caused a small (20%) increase in phenyl valerate hydrolase activity (Fig. 2a). Thus, the interactions between NEST-DOPC, CHAPS, phenyl valerate, and either oleic acid or LPC are complex and cannot be described kinetically in terms of pure competitive or non-competitive inhibition. NEST is extracted and isolated from bacterial lysates in solutions containing CHAPS, and under these conditions, its phenyl valerate hydrolase activity is lost, partly because this activity requires association with phospholipid and partly because concentrations of CHAPS greater than its critical micellar concentration (4–8 mm) are inhibitory (12Atkins J. Luthjens L.H. Hom M.L. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 119-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Restoration of esterase activity to purified NEST requires its incorporation into phospholipid (DOPC) liposomes concomitant with removal of CHAPS by overnight dialysis at room temperature. Determination of free oleic acid concentration in the dialyzed samples yielded a value of 0.12 ± 0.02 mm(n = 7), compared with an original DOPC concentration of ∼0.5 mm. Free oleic acid was not detected in dialyzed mixtures of DOPC and detergent with S966A mutant NEST, indicating that generation of the fatty acid required catalytic activity. We established conditions (2.5 mm phospholipid, 3.2 mm CHAPS) for assaying the lipase activity of NEST as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 1 h at 37 °C, ∼0.8 μmol of oleic acid was liberated from DOPC per mg of NEST (Fig. 4a). This slow rate of hydrolysis was not substantially altered by several changes to the incubation conditions as follows: varying CHAPS concentration between 1.6 and 8 mm; incorporating DOPC into mixed lipid vesicles (various ratios of DOPC/dioleoylethanolamine/sphingomyelin/cholesterol); by adding calcium or magnesium ions; or by adding ATP, which has been reported to enhance iPLA2 activity (20Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). By comparing NEST-catalyzed hydrolysis of dioleoyl phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) was hydrolyzed more slowly than phosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) but faster than phosphatidic acid (DOPA) or phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) (Fig. 4a). Reaction rates, particularly for DOPG and DOPA, decreased with increasing incubation time even though less than 3% of the substrate was hydrolyzed after 1 h. Phosphatidylcholines (PC) with different acyl chains were compared as substrates for the putative PLA activity of NEST. The fastest initial rate (∼0.12 μmol/min/mg) was observed with 1-palmitoyl, 2-arachidonoyl-PC and was 4–5 times faster than rates with DOPC, 1-palmitoyl, 2-oleoyl-PC, and dipalmitoyl-PC (Fig. 4b). Whereas 1-O- hexadecadyl, 2-arachidonoyl-PC is a substrate for iPLA2 (20Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was not detectably hydrolyzed by NEST (Fig. 4b). This raised the possibility that NEST mediates selective cleavage of the sn-1 bond of phospholipids; to examine this issue we incubated NEST with differentially labeled [14C]phosphatidylcholines (Table I). Approximately twice as much14C-labeled oleic acid was liberated from substrate labeled in both the sn-1 and sn-2 positions (1.75 ± 0.05 nmol) as from substrate labeled exclusively at the sn-2 position (0.83 ± 0.01 nmol). Furthermore, no14C-labeled LPC was detected after reaction with the [(sn-1 + -2)-14C]PC substrate. By contrast, incubation of bee venom secretory PLA2 with the sn-2-labeled substrate resulted in essentially quantitative conversion to [14C]oleic acid and, with the (sn-1 + -2)-labeled substrate, quantitative conversion to [14C]oleic acid and [14C]LPC (Table I). These results strongly suggest that NEST mediates a very slow cleavage of the sn-2 bond of phospholipid followed by a rapid hydrolysis of the resulting lysophospholipid product, possibly before this product is released from the enzyme. Cleavage of the sn-2 bond of 1-O-hexadecyl, 2-arachidonoyl-PC by NEST would yield a non-hydrolyzable lysophospholipid product; the latter may dissociate only very slowly from the enzyme and hence inhibit binding of further phospholipid substrate, giving rise to the result observed in Fig. 4b.Table IConversion of 14C-labeled phosphatidylcholines to labeled oleic acid and lysophosphatidylcholine by NEST and sPLA2Enzyme[sn-2-14C]PC[(sn-1 + -2)-14C]PC14C as oleic acid14C as oleic acid14C as LPC%%%NEST1.11 ± 0.022.70 ± 0.080sPLA297.8 ± 0.0547.6 ± 0.248.6 ± 0.3NEST (10 μg) or bee venom secretory PLA2; 1 μg) was incubated (37 °C; 1 h) in PEN buffer with 3.7 mmCHAPS and either 1.5 mm 1-palmitoyl, 2-oleoyl-[oleoyl-1-14C]PC ([sn-1 + 2-14C]PC) or 1.3 mmdioleoyl-[dioleoyl-1-14C]PC ([sn-1 + 2)-14C]PC). Reactions were stopped, and labeled oleic acid, and LPC were resolved and quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab NEST (10 μg) or bee venom secretory PLA2; 1 μg) was incubated (37 °C; 1 h) in PEN buffer with 3.7 mmCHAPS and either 1.5 mm 1-palmitoyl, 2-oleoyl-[oleoyl-1-14C]PC ([sn-1 + 2-14C]PC) or 1.3 mmdioleoyl-[dioleoyl-1-14C]PC ([sn-1 + 2)-14C]PC). Reactions were stopped, and labeled oleic acid, and LPC were resolved and quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” NEST liberated [14C]oleic acid from sn-2-labeled PC at rates that were approximately linear over a period of 15 min (Fig. 5a). Thereafter, 15-min assays were used to determine the dependence of reaction rate on substrate concentration. Lineweaver-Burk transformations of these data (Fig. 5b) allowed determination of values for 1-palmitoyl, 2-oleoyl-PC of Vmax = 11.6 ± 1.1 nmol/min/mg and Km = 0.37 ± 0.12 mm (from three experiments). Fatty acid was generated rapidly when NEST was incubated with LPC. With 1-palmitoyl-LPC, initial rates of ∼20 μmol/min/mg were about twice those observed with 1-oleoyl-LPC (Fig. 6a) and were ∼200 times faster than those with 1-palmitoyl, 2-arachidonoyl-PC (cf. Fig. 4b). As with the diacylphospholipid substrates, rates declined after 2–5 min, and this was not due to substrate depletion. Among the lipid substrates tested with NEST, lysophospholipids gave by far the fastest initial rates. The affinity of the active site of NEST for lysophospholipids may underlie the potent inhibition by these compounds and their ether analogues of phenyl valerate hydrolase activity (cf. Figs. 2b and 3b). However, unlike phenyl valerate hydrolase activity, NEST lipase activity toward lysophospholipid (Fig. 6b) and other lipid substrates did not require incorporation into DOPC vesicles to achieve interfacial activation, suggesting that in these cases the substrate itself fulfills this requirement. We established conditions under which linear rates of hydrolysis of 1-palmitoyl-LPC could be observed (Fig. 7a). Lineweaver-Burk transformation of data obtained under these conditions (Fig. 7b) allowed the determination of values for Vmax = 20.8 ± 2.5 μmol/min/mg and Km = 0.054 ± 0.006 mm (from four experiments). NEST hydrolyzed monoacylglycerols, with a marked preference for the sn-1 isomer. After a 5-min incubation, 8–10 times more fatty acid was liberated from 1-palmitoylglycerol than from the 2-isomer (Fig. 8a). Although the first 2–5 min of NEST-catalyzed hydrolysis of 1- and 2-oleoylglycerol and 2-arachidonylglycerol were at least as rapid as for 2-palmitoylglycerol, the rate diminished dramatically after this time (Fig. 8b). Thus, with certain members of each class of lipid substrate (phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and acylglycerols), NEST-catalyzed release of fatty acid shows an initial burst of variable duration and then slows markedly. A similar, poorly understood stalling in reaction rate has been reported for several phospholipases (21Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11366-11371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Pete M.J. Exton J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9335-9344Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we were able to establish conditions under which approximately linear rates of hydrolysis of 1-palmitoylglycerol could be measured (Fig. 9a). Lineweaver-Burk transformations of these rates (Fig. 9b) allowed determination of values for Vmax = 1.37 ± 0.47 μmol/min/mg and Km = 0.37 ± 0.09 (from three experiments).Figure 9NEST-catalyzed hydrolysis of 1-palmitoylglycerol: linear rate conditions (a) and dependence on substrate concentration (b). NEST (4 μg) was incubated (37 °C) in 0.5 ml of PEN buffer with 2.4 mm CHAPS and 1-palmitoylglycerol at the concentrations (mm) indicated in the figure. At the times shown the reaction was stopped and free fatty acid determined as under “Experimental Procedures.” Portions of the time course (a) with linear reaction rates were used to derive data for the 1/v versus 1/s plot (b).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast to the relatively brisk hydrolysis of monoacylglycerols, NEST did not catalyze detectable fatty acid release from di- or triacylglycerols nor from a variety of acyl amides including sphingomyelin, anandamide, and N-oleoylethanolamine (data not shown). Free fatty acid was slowly liberated when a suspension of cholesteryl oleate was incubated with NEST, at rates similar to those with DOPC (data not shown). We have shown here that NEST, the recombinant esterase domain of NTE, liberates fatty acid from phospholipids, monoacylglycerols, and lysophospholipids. Thus, more than 30 years after the discovery of NTE, we have identified naturally occurring, membrane-associated lipids as its potential endogenous substrates. This demonstration that NTE is a putative lipase provides new clues to its possible cellular functions. Although the active site of NEST has primary sequence similarity to iPLA2, it hydrolyzes diacylphospholipids much more slowly. Using sn-2-labeled [14C]PC we found a Vmax ∼0.01 μmol/min/mg NEST, whereas initial rates of 1–5 μmol/min/mg have been reported for iPLA2itself (20Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). When assayed with relatively low detergent concentrations, both iPLA2 and calcium-dependent cytosolic PLA2 can display lysophospholipase activity of about the same magnitude (a few μmol/min/mg) as their maximal PLA2 activity (21Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11366-11371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lio Y.-C. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19214-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). NEST shows no significant sequence similarity to the cytosolic 25-kDa lysophospholipid-specific lysophospholipases (25Sugimoto H. Hayashi H. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7705-7711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Wang A. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12723-12729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and yet it catalyzes hydrolysis of 1-palmitoyl-LPC (Vmax∼20 μmol/min/mg) much faster than initial rates (1–2 μmol/min/mg) reported for recombinant lysophospholipase (27Wang A. Yang H.-C. Friedman P. Johnson C.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Under the experimental conditions in this report, lysophospholipids were by far the most avidly hydrolyzed substrate for NEST. It has been stressed repeatedly that the rates and selectivities of bond cleavage observed in lipase assays in vitro are profoundly affected by the physicochemical nature of the substrate (14Derewenda Z.S. Sharp A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 20-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 16Reynolds L.J. Washburn W.N. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A.

Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to consider the possibility that lysophospholipids may be a physiological substrate for NTE. The presence of a homologue of NTE in yeast (4Lush M.J., Li, Y. Read D.J. Willis A.C. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) suggests that this enzyme mediates a cellular process conserved throughout much of eukaryotic evolution. NTE itself is firmly associated with intracellular membranes, and from a combination of esterase assays on brain subcellular fractions (30Richardson R.J. Davis C.S. Johnson M.K. J. Neurochem. 1979; 32: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), immunohistochemistry on brain sections (31Glynn P. Holton J.L. Nolan C.C. Read D.J. Brown L. Hubbard A. Cavanagh J.B.

Glynn, unpublished data.we have tentatively concluded that NTE may be localized predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. What might be the biological significance of NTE-mediated lysophospholipase activity in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi of various cells from yeast to neurons? There is a growing recognition that, along with other factors, the relative concentrations of diacyl- and lysophospholipids contribute to the degree of curvature of biological membranes and that this is an important determinant in the process of membrane fission, tubulation, and fusion (32Chemomordik L. Kozlov M.M. Zimmerberg J. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 1-14PubMed Google Scholar, 33Weigert R. Silletta M.G. Spano S. Turacchio G. Cericola G. Colanzi A. Senatore S. Mancini R. Polishchuk E.V.

Addition to cultured mammalian cells of various PLA2 inhibitors, including bromoenol lactone and arachidonoyl-TFMK, causes reversible fragmentation of the Golgi complex (35de Figueiredo P. Drecktrah D. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Strang M. Brown W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8642-8647Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 36Kuroiwa N. Nakamura M. Tagaya M. Takatsuki A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that a PLA2 activity may be required for maintenance of Golgi complex architecture (35de Figueiredo P. Drecktrah D. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Strang M. Brown W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8642-8647Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); this would result in continuous production of lysophospholipid within the Golgi. Indeed, in Golgi membranes (of rat kidney and liver), lysophospholipids compose 3–4% of the total phospholipid (37Zambrano F. Fleischer S. Fleischer B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 380: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that CtBP/BARS-catalyzed acylation of lysophosphatidic acid to form phosphatidic acid induces fission of Golgi membranes (33Weigert R. Silletta M.G. Spano S. Turacchio G. Cericola G. Colanzi A. Senatore S. Mancini R. Polishchuk E.V. Salmona M. Facchiano F. Burger K.N.J. Mironov A. Luini A. Corda D. Nature. 1999; 402: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Another mechanism for acutely reducing the steady-state lysophospholipid level might involve regulated lysophospholipase activity. If ligand binding to the N-terminal domain of the NTE, which has sequence similarity to cyclic AMP-binding proteins (4Lush M.J., Li, Y. Read D.J. Willis A.C. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), modulates the lipase activity of NTE toward its natural substrate, then this might allow inducible alteration of Golgi architecture and contribute to processes such as regulated protein secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1978131501,"The eukaryotic 20 S proteasome contains the following 6 active sites: 2 chymotrypsin-like, 2 trypsin-like, and 2 caspase-like. We previously showed that hydrophobic peptide substrates of the chymotrypsin-like sites allosterically stimulate peptide hydrolysis by the caspase-like sites and their own cleavage. More thorough analysis revealed that these peptides also stimulate peptide hydrolysis by the trypsin-like site. This general activation by hydrophobic peptides occurred even if the chymotrypsin-like sites were occupied by a covalent inhibitor and was highly cooperative, with an average Hill coefficient of 7. Therefore, this stimulation of peptide hydrolysis at all active sites occurs upon binding of hydrophobic peptides to several non-catalytic sites. The stimulation by hydrophobic peptides was not observed in the yeast ΔNα3 mutant 20 S proteasomes, in 20 S-PA26 complexes, or SDS-activated proteasomes and was significantly lower in 26 S proteasomes, all of which appear to have the gated channel in the α-rings in an open conformation and hydrolyze peptides at much faster rates than 20 S proteasomes. Also the hydrophobic peptides alteredK m , V max of active sites in a similar fashion as PA26 and the ΔNα3 mutation. The activation by hydrophobic peptides was decreased in K+-containing buffer, which favors the closed state of the channels. Therefore, hydrophobic peptides stimulate peptide hydrolysis most likely by promoting the opening of the channels in the α-rings. During protein breakdown, this peptide-induced channel opening may function to facilitate the release of products from the proteasome."
https://openalex.org/W2029932852,"In plants, subcellular triacylglycerol granules in seeds (oil bodies) and floral tapetum (tapetosomes) are stabilized by amphipathic structural protein called oleosin. We hereby report a novel group of oleosins that is present inside the pollen of Arabidopsis thaliana. We have used the conserved sequence of oleosins to locate, via the DNA database, all 16 oleosin genes in the Arabidopsis genome. The oleosin genes can be divided into three groups according to their sequences and tissue-specific expressions, as probed by RNA blot hybridization and reverse transcriptase-PCR. The first group includes eight genes specifically expressed in the floret tapetum. The second group includes five genes specifically expressed in maturing seeds. The third, novel group includes three genes expressed in both maturing seeds and floral microspores, which will become pollen. Transgenic study using the promoter of one of these genes attached to a reporter gene has provided corroborative evidence for the specific expression of the gene in the microspores in the florets. One of the pollen oleosins can be identified by microsequencing and specific immunoblotting. Pollen oleosins synthesized by recombinant bacteria can collaborate with phospholipids in stabilizing reconstituted oil bodies. Thus, pollen has oleosins to stabilize the abundant subcellular oil bodies. Seed oil bodies and floret tapetosomes have been isolated from the miniature Arabidopsis plants, and the success indicates that the organelles can be subjected to future biochemical and genetic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2045077330,"BCL6 is a member of the POZ/zinc finger (POK) family involved in survival and/or differentiation of a number of cell types and in B cell lymphoma upon chromosomal alteration. Transcriptional repression by BCL6 is thought to be achieved in part by recruiting a repressor complex containing two class I histone deacetylases (HDACs). In this study we investigated whether BCL6 could also target members of class II HDACs. Our results indicate that three related class II deacetylases, HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7 can associate with BCL6 in vivo and in vitro. Using electron microscopy, we found that endogenous BCL6 and class II HDACs partially co-localize in the nucleus. Overexpression experiments showed that BCL6 and HDAC4, -5, or –7 are intermingled onto common nuclear substructures and form stable complexes. A highly conserved domain in the N-terminal region of HDAC5 and HDAC7 as well as the zinc finger region of BCL6 were found necessary for the complex formationin vivo and in vitro. Moreover, our data point to the zinc finger region of BCL6 as a multifunctional domain which, beside its known capacity to bind DNA, is involved in the nuclear targeting of the protein and in the recruitment of the class II HDACs, and hence constitutes an autonomous repressor domain. Since PLZF, a BCL6 relative, could also interact with HDAC4, -5, and 7, we suggest that class II HDACs are largely involved in the control of the POK transcription factors activity. BCL6 is a member of the POZ/zinc finger (POK) family involved in survival and/or differentiation of a number of cell types and in B cell lymphoma upon chromosomal alteration. Transcriptional repression by BCL6 is thought to be achieved in part by recruiting a repressor complex containing two class I histone deacetylases (HDACs). In this study we investigated whether BCL6 could also target members of class II HDACs. Our results indicate that three related class II deacetylases, HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7 can associate with BCL6 in vivo and in vitro. Using electron microscopy, we found that endogenous BCL6 and class II HDACs partially co-localize in the nucleus. Overexpression experiments showed that BCL6 and HDAC4, -5, or –7 are intermingled onto common nuclear substructures and form stable complexes.

POK proteins are sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors, some of them being involved in human oncogenesis. For instance, non-Hodgkin lymphomas are often associated with the structural alteration, and presumably mis-regulation, of the BCL6 (also named LAZ3) gene encoding a six-zinc finger POK protein (1Kerckaert J.-P.

Moreover, a few cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia are associated with the t(11;17) reciprocal translocation that fuses the retinoic acid receptor α to PLZF, a nine-zinc finger POK protein.

Recently, a set of BCL6 potential target genes has been identified by DNA microarray screening in lymphocytes. BCL6 was found to repress a number of genes involved in B cell activation and terminal differentiation, inflammation, and cell cycle regulation (12Shaeffer A.L., Yu, X., He, Y. Boldrick J. Chan E.P. Staudt L.M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 199-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shaded light on the molecular mechanisms by which BCL6 negatively regulates gene transcription. BCL6 recruits, through multiple contacts, a repressor complex containing both silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors or its close relative nuclear receptor co-repressor, two vertebrate homologues of the yeast repressor SIN3 (mSINA/B), and two related class I histone deacetylases, HDAC11 and HDAC2 (13Dhordain P.

In fact, it appears that POK transcriptional repressors are capable of recruiting other co-repressors. Indeed, C-terminal binding protein might interact withDrosophila TTK (21Wen Y. Nguyen D., Li, Y. Lai Z.C. Genetics. 2000; 156: 195-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas another unrelated co-repressor, termed B-CoR, specifically binds to BCL6 in a silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors/nuclear receptor co-repressor mutually exclusive manner (22Huynh K.D. Fischle W. Verdin E. Bardwell V.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1810-1823PubMed Google Scholar).Whereas class I deacetylases (HDAC1,-2, -3, and -8) are closely related to the yeast rpd3 gene product, other HDACs (HDAC4, -5, -6, -7, -9, and -10) have been characterized in vertebrates, and collectively referred to as class II HDACs. HDAC4, -5, -7, and -9 share two regions, each encompassing half of the protein: a C-terminal catalytic domain resembling that of the yeast HDA1 deacetylase and a N-terminal “regulatory” domain (23Verdel A.

Indeed, both HDAC6 and HDAC10 harbor two regions of homology with the class II catalytic domain (23Verdel A. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2440-2445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 24Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 3350-3356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, whereas HDAC6 contains two active catalytic domains (24Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), the second catalytic domain-like region of HDAC10 does not appear to be active (29Guardiola A.R. Yao T.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3350-3356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Another feature of all of the class II members is their ability to shuttle in a regulated fashion between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (see Ref. 30Khochbin S. Verdel A. Lemercier C. Seigneurin-Berny D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar for review).The role of class II HDACs in the control of transcription is believed to be important but is only beginning to be analyzed. In particular, although class I and class II HDACs represent two structurally distinguishable families, their functional relationship, beyond their common ability to deacetylate histone in vitro, remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated whether POK proteins, such as BCL6, could also associate with class II histone deacetylases. Our data showed that indeed HDAC4, -5, and -7 are recruited by BCL6in vivo and in vitro. Together with previously published data, these findings indicate that BCL6, as well as other POK proteins, directly and indirectly recruit both class I and class II HDACs.DISCUSSIONThe data presented in this report show that BCL6 and PLZF harbor the capacity to recruit three related members of the class II HDACs, HDAC4, -5, and –7, and indicate that this recruitment relies, at least in part, on a direct interaction. A detailed investigation of these interactions revealed interesting properties of BCL6 and the studied HDACs.BCL6-Zinc Finger Region Is a Multifunctional DomainTwo domains of BCL6 are involved in the interactions with the class II HDACs: the N-terminal BTB/POZ domain and the C-terminal ZF region. A BCL6 derivative lacking the four C-terminal zinc fingers is severely impaired in its ability to bind HDAC5 and –7 in vitro and to co-localize with HDAC5 in vivo. Moreover, the deletion of both the entire ZF region and the BTB/POZ domain totally abrogates the interaction in vitro. Finally, the isolated ZF region of BCL6 is sufficient to directly interact with HDAC5 and -7 in vitro, and exhibits an autonomous repressive activity when targeted to a promoter in vivo. In addition to its already characterized DNA binding capacity, all these results suggest a role for the ZF region as an important heteromerization interface with class II HDACs. The ZF region of POK proteins therefore appears as a multifunctional domain, mediating specific interaction with DNA as well as with various protein partners, including class II HDACs. Indeed, the recruitment of a co-repressor by the C2-H2 zinc finger DNA-binding region of the CTCF transcription factor has been recently reported (40Lutz M. Burke L.J. Barreto G. Goeman F. Greb H. Arnold R. Schultheiss H. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. Lobanenkov V. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1707-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, a deletion of the ZF region of the ZF5 POK protein has been shown to eliminate its ability to self-interact (41Numoto M. Yokoro K. Koshi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), whereas the ZF region of both BCL6 and PLZF were found to be involved in their heteromerization (33Dhordain P. Albagli O. Honoré N. Guidez F. Lantoine D. Schmid M. de Thé H. Zelent A. Koken M.H.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6240-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Likewise, the ZF region of PLZF mediates its association with PML, the major translocation partner of RARα in acute promyelocytic leukemia (42Koken M.H. Reid A. Quignon F. Chelbi-Alix M.K. Davies J.M. Kabarowski J.H. Zhu J. Dong S. Chen S. Chen Z. Tan C.C. Licht J. Waxman S. de The H. Zelent A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blood. 1999; 93: 3167-3215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).A Limited Region of HDAC4, -5, and –7 Targets Transcription FactorsRegarding the BCL6-interacting region of class II HDACs, we identified their conserved non-catalytic N-terminal domain to be necessary and sufficient for the interaction with BCL6 in vitro and for co-localization in cells. This region is present in HDAC4, -5, and –7, as well as in the recently cloned HDAC9 (26Zhou X. Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10572-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and in MITR (44Sparrow D.B. Miska E.A. Langley E. Reynaud-Deonauth S. Kotecha S. Towers N. Spoh G. Kouzarides T. Mohun T.

A. 2000; 97: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), suggesting that these last two proteins probably also interact with BCL6. These data emphasize the importance of this domain in protein/protein interactions. Indeed, this domain has already been shown to bind MEF2 transcription factors as well as, at least for MITR, HDACs from both class I and class II and the CtBP co-repressor, indicating how the isolated HDAC5 N-terminal domain, or MITR, which lacks a catalytic deacetylase region, are capable of transcriptional repression (31Lemercier C.

Moreover, this domain contains three conserved serines, two of them being possibly phosphorylated by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK). A regulated phosphorylation of these serines seems to control the interaction of these HDACs with partners as well as their intracellular localization (37McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L., Lu, J. Olson E.N.

Our data suggest that BCL6 may interfere with the nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of class II HDACs. For instance, HDAC4 appeared cytoplasmic in most cells when overexpressed “alone,” but it became almost systematically detectable in the BCL6 nuclear bodies when overexpressed in induced UTA-L cells. Moreover, mapping experiments with either HDAC5 and -7 derivatives further indicated that the first half of their N-terminal domain is necessary and sufficient to bind BCL6. This highly conserved subregion also encompasses the binding site for the MEF2 transcription factors (31Lemercier C. Verdel A. Galloo B. Curtet S. Brocard M.P. Khochbin S. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a cross-talk between BCL6 and the CaMK/HDACs/MEF2 pathway. Interestingly, like MEF2 transcription factors and presumably class II HDACs (39Zhao X. Ito A. Kane C.D. Liao T-S. Bolger T.A. Lemrow S.M. Means A.R. Yao T-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35042-35048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), BCL6 positively controls myogenesis as BCL6-deficient myocytes are more prone to undergo apoptosis upon serum withdrawal, possibly because they are impaired in their capacity to correctly arrest proliferation and/or to terminally differentiate (9Kumagai T.

All these co-repressors were previously found to also bind BCL6 (13Dhordain P. Albagli O. Lin R.J. Ansieau S. Quief S. Leutz A. Kerckaert J.-P. Evans R.M. Leprince D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moreover, B-CoR, a novel co-repressor interacting with the BCL6 BTB/POZ domain has been shown to associate with class II HDACs in vivo (22Huynh K.D. Fischle W. Verdin E. Bardwell V.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1810-1823PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, BCL6 appears capable of interacting with class II HDACs both directly through its C-terminal ZF region (and to a lesser extent, its BTB/POZ domain) and indirectly by recruiting several co-repressors through its N-terminal half (16Dhordain P. Lin R. Quief S. Kerckaert J.-P. Evans R.M. Albagli O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4645-4651Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar,22Huynh K.D. Fischle W. Verdin E. Bardwell V.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1810-1823PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility of multiple, direct, and indirect, contacts between BCL6 and class II HDACs parallels the situation of BCL6-class I HDACs interaction (16Dhordain P. Lin R. Quief S. Kerckaert J.-P. Evans R.M. Albagli O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4645-4651Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 20Wong C.W. Privalsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27695-27702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It could both confer more stability to the DNA-bound repressor complex(es) and increase the regulatory potential of the complex by broadening its linkage to distinct signaling pathways.What Could Be the Role of the BCL6-HDACs Interaction?An obvious possibility for the role of BCL6-HDACs interaction is that BCL6 uses HDACs to exert transcriptional repression by local chromatin remodeling when targeted to specific promoters. It is also interesting to consider another hypothesis based on the ability of BCL6 and associated molecules to form specific “molecular reservoirs” allowing the assembly and reversible storage of class I and class II HDAC-containing regulatory complexes. In this respect, it is noteworthy that DNA replication has been found to progress on the periphery BCL6 nuclear core (35Albagli O. Lindon C. Lantoine S. Quief S. Puvion E. Pinset C. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8560-8570Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). BCL6-associated proteins could therefore be, at least in part, either deposited at specific promoters during DNA replication to maintain or alter the local chromatin structure, or involved in a broader function in chromatin maturation, especially the histone deacetylation that follows their association to the newly replicated DNA (56Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 57Tyler J.K. Bulger D.M. Kamakaka R.T. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6149-6159Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Finally, beyond the repression, another possibility would be that BCL6 could itself be a substrate of (at least some) its associated HDACs, which could thereby modulate its function. The report that the acetyltransferase p300 may both acetylate BCL6 and regulate its repressive activity (58Bereshchenko O.R., Gu, W. Dalla-Favera R. Blood. 2000; 96 (Abst. 3028): 702aGoogle Scholar) provides support to this hypothesis. The presence of an N-terminal BTB/POZ (bric à brac, tramtrack, broad complex/pox virus, and zinc finger) domain and C-terminal C2-H2 zinc finger(s) defines the family of POK ((BTB/)POZ and krüppel-like zinc finger) proteins found in both vertebrates and Drosophila. POK proteins are sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors, some of them being involved in human oncogenesis. For instance, non-Hodgkin lymphomas are often associated with the structural alteration, and presumably mis-regulation, of the BCL6 (also named LAZ3) gene encoding a six-zinc finger POK protein (1Kerckaert J.-P.

Moreover, a few cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia are associated with the t(11;17) reciprocal translocation that fuses the retinoic acid receptor α to PLZF, a nine-zinc finger POK protein. Finally, other POK proteins, such as HIC-1 (3Wales M.M. Biel M.A. el Deiry W. Nelkin B.D. Issa J.P. Cavenee W.K. Kuerbitz S.J. Baylin S.B. Nat.

Recently, a set of BCL6 potential target genes has been identified by DNA microarray screening in lymphocytes. BCL6 was found to repress a number of genes involved in B cell activation and terminal differentiation, inflammation, and cell cycle regulation (12Shaeffer A.L., Yu, X., He, Y. Boldrick J. Chan E.P. Staudt L.M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 199-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shaded light on the molecular mechanisms by which BCL6 negatively regulates gene transcription. BCL6 recruits, through multiple contacts, a repressor complex containing both silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors or its close relative nuclear receptor co-repressor, two vertebrate homologues of the yeast repressor SIN3 (mSINA/B), and two related class I histone deacetylases, HDAC11 and HDAC2 (13Dhordain P.

In fact, it appears that POK transcriptional repressors are capable of recruiting other co-repressors. Indeed, C-terminal binding protein might interact withDrosophila TTK (21Wen Y. Nguyen D., Li, Y. Lai Z.C. Genetics. 2000; 156: 195-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas another unrelated co-repressor, termed B-CoR, specifically binds to BCL6 in a silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors/nuclear receptor co-repressor mutually exclusive manner (22Huynh K.D.

Whereas class I deacetylases (HDAC1,-2, -3, and -8) are closely related to the yeast rpd3 gene product, other HDACs (HDAC4, -5, -6, -7, -9, and -10) have been characterized in vertebrates, and collectively referred to as class II HDACs. HDAC4, -5, -7, and -9 share two regions, each encompassing half of the protein: a C-terminal catalytic domain resembling that of the yeast HDA1 deacetylase and a N-terminal “regulatory"

In a screen for possible regulators of Bid, we defined Bfl-1/A1 as a potent Bid interacting protein. Bfl-1 is an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, whose preferential expression in hematopoietic cells and endothelium is controlled by inflammatory stimuli. Its mechanism of action is unknown.

Confocal microscopy supports that Bfl-1, which at least in part constitutively localizes to mitochondria, does not impede tBid translocation. However, Bfl-1 remains tightly and selectively bound to tBid and blocks collaboration between tBid and Bax or Bak in the plane of the mitochondrial membrane, thereby preventing mitochondrial apoptotic activation. Lack of demonstrable interaction between Bfl-1 and Bak or Bax in the mitochondrial membrane suggests that Bfl-1 generally prevents the formation of a pro-apoptotic complex by sequestering BH3 domain-only proteins.

In the cytosol, Cyt c acts as cofactor in formation of a multimeric complex between the Apaf–1 scaffold protein and the initiator caspase-9. The ensuing proteolytic activation of caspase-9 allows for effector caspase processing and apoptotic execution (1Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X.

Death receptors, which are apoptosis-inducing members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, recruit and activate caspase-8 or –10. These enzymes process effector caspases, as well as the Bcl-2 family member Bid.

The Bcl-2 family of apoptotic regulators is characterized by the presence of Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains and can be subdivided into three groups: anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 type proteins, pro-apoptotic Bax type proteins, and pro-apoptotic BH3 domain-only family members (18Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar,19Huang D.C.S. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). The BH3 domain is a motif of about 16 residues, which forms an amphipathic helix that is necessary for death induction and dimerization among Bcl-2 family members. The BH3 helix of one partner can bind to a groove formed by BH1, BH2, and BH3 domain helices of the other (18Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Bfl-1 has conserved BH1 and BH2 domains and is functionally defined as an inhibitory Bcl-2-type protein. Well documented is the protection it provides to TNF-α-induced apoptosis in primary endothelial cells and HeLa carcinoma cells (13Zong W.-X. Edelstein L.C. Chen C. Bash J. Gelinas C.

Furthermore, Bfl-1 conferred protection to p53-induced apoptosis in baby rat kidney cells (22D'Sa-Eipper C. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G.

Immunol. 1993; 151: 1979-1988PubMed Google Scholar). Systematic examination of Bfl-1 function in primary cells has not been documented. Germ-line gene inactivation is complicated by the presence of at least four a1 genes in the murine genome. Disruption of the a1-a gene accelerated spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis, but did not affect TNF-induced apoptosis of these cells (24Hamasaki A. Sendo F. Nakayama K. Ishida N. Negishi I. Nakayama K. Hatakeyama S. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1985-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Human and mouse Bfl-1 share a BH1, BH2, and somewhat less conserved BH3 domain, but the limited homology to a BH4 domain found in human Bfl-1 is not present in the mouse. Protection by Bfl-1 impinges on intact BH1 and BH2 domains (23D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnandurai G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3105-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Zhang H. Cowan-Jacob S.W.

Whereas it is undisputed that Bfl-1 is a protective Bcl-2 type protein, its mechanism of action is unknown. The prototype members of this subgroup localize constitutively to membranes of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and nucleus, but Bfl-1 does not have a well defined hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal region, implicated in membrane anchoring. Whereas certain authors find Bfl-1 in mitochondria (21Duriez P.J. Wong F. Dorovini-Zis K. Shahidi R. Karsan A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18099-18107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), others find it in the cytoplasm of resting cells and the nucleus of apoptotic cells (26Orlowsky A. Somogyi R.D. Weiss L.M. Prystowsky M.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 412-419PubMed Google Scholar). A model for the mechanism of action of Bcl-2 family members, prominent until recently, predicts that Bcl-2 type proteins autonomously inhibit apoptosis. Heterodimerization with pro-apoptotic family members would abrogate their protective function and thereby provoke apoptosis (19Huang D.C.S. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar,27Kelekar A. Thompson C.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). However, new findings indicate that death induction is independent of Bcl-2-type proteins, but involves collaboration between Bax-type proteins and BH3 domain-only family members. The BH3 domain-only group has many members, which differ strikingly in their responsiveness to stimuli and thereby in the pathways they regulate (19Huang D.C.S. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). For instance, Noxa and Puma are regulated by p53 and implicated in DNA damage pathways (28Yu J. Zhang L.

The availability of Bax and Bak knockout mice has recently allowed work that illuminates how pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members induce cell death. Cells lacking both Bax and Bak did not die upon expression of BH3 domain-only proteins, in contrast to cells expressing either one of these molecules. This provided the insight that BH3 domain-only proteins require at least one Bax-type partner to induce cell death (31Zong W.-X. Lindsten T. Ross A.J. MacGregor G. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 32Wei M.C. Zong W.-X. Cheng E.H.-Y. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B.

The novel model emerging from these findings is that Cyt c release depends on interaction between a BH3 domain-only protein and a Bax-type partner, which allows formation of a Bax-type transmembrane pore. We show here that Bfl-1 acts by inhibiting the collaboration between the BH3 domain-only protein Bid and its pro-apoptotic partners Bax or Bak in the induction of Cyt c release. Bfl-1 does so by binding to full-length Bid via the Bid BH3 domain. It does not interfere with proteolytic activation of Bid, nor with its mitochondrial insertion, but remains selectively complexed to tBid in the mitochondrial membrane where it prevents the activity of a pro-apoptotic complex.

J16 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, HeLa, COS-7, and Phoenix-Ampho cells in Dulbecco's modified medium, both supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. Prior to stimulation, J16 cells were suspended in serum-free Yssel's medium (49Yssel H. de Vries J.E. Koken M. van Blitterswijk W. Spits H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and seeded at 1 × 106 per ml, 200 μl/well in round-bottom 96-well plates for apoptosis assays, and at 5–10 × 106 per ml in 24-well culture plates for Cyt crelease assays. After addition of stimulus, cells were incubated for the indicated time periods at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Irradiation was performed using a 137Cs source (415 Ci; Von Gahlen Nederland, B.V.). HeLa cells, plated on coverslips, were preincubated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 2 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and subsequently stimulated with 10 ng/ml human recombinant TNFα (Sigma) in the continued presence of cycloheximide. Human Bcl-2 cDNA was cloned into the retroviral vector LZRS-MS-IRES-Zeo/pBR, a derivative of LZRS-pBMN-lacZ, which was provided by Dr. G. Nolan (Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA). The retroviral vector pEYZ-FmA1 and the empty equivalent pEYZ-MCS were kindly provided by Dr. I. Berberich (Institut für Virologie und Immunbiologie, Universität Würzburg, Germany). pET15b/Bid containing human full-length Bid cDNA was a gift from Dr. X. Wang (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Dallas, TX). pMT2SM-Myc-Bid, pMD4-Bid, pEGFP-N1-Bid, and pET15b-tBid (nucleotides 181–588) vectors were made by introducing suitable restriction sites by PCR into this Bid cDNA. Modified pMT2 vectors with multiple cloning site and upstream Myc or HA tag sequence were constructed in our laboratory by Dr. M. Gebbink. pEGFP-N1 is a commercial vector (CLONTECH), which allows fusion of eGFP at the carboxyl terminus of the cDNA product of interest. Point mutations in the BH3 domain of tBid (pET15b/tBidM97A/D98A) as described (50Wang K. Yin X.-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

Human Bfl-1 cDNA was cloned from the yeast expression vector pACT into pET15b (for in vitrotranscription/translation) and pMT2SM-HA (for confocal microscopy) by PCR. All sequences were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. For yeast two-hybrid protein interaction screens (51Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar), pMD4-Bid was used as bait to screen a cDNA library of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B lymphocytes, according to earlier described procedures (52Smit L. van der Horst G. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8564-8569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected with combinations of pMT2SM-Myc-Bid, pMT2SM-HA-Bfl-1, and/or empty vector by the standard DEAE-dextran transfection method, using 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA per 106 cells. HeLa cells (1 × 105) were grown overnight on a coverslip and transfected with 0.4 μg of DNA using Effectene according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). To produce retrovirus, LZRS-Bcl-2-IRES-Zeo/pBR, pEYZ-FmA1/Bfl-1, or empty LZRS or pEYZ-MCS vectors were transfected into the 293T human embryonic kidney cell-derived packaging cell line Phoenix-Ampho (Ref. 53Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar; provided by Dr. G. P. Nolan), using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfected cells were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin (CLONTECH). Virus-containing supernatant was harvested after 48 h and stored at −80 °C until further use. J16 cells were coated with RetroNectin (Takara) and transduced at a density of 0.5 × 106/ml of virus-containing supernatant. Supernatants were removed after overnight incubation, and cells were cultured in fresh medium. Selection of transduced cells was initiated after 48 h by the addition of 200 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). The selection process was completed within 2 weeks. Transduced cells were further cultured in the presence of 200 μg/ml Zeocin. To measure nuclear fragmentation, cells were lysed in 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (54Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity of propidium iodide-stained DNA was determined on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and data were analyzed using CellQuest software. Full-length Bid, tBid, Bfl-1, Bax, and Bak were in vitro transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine from the appropriate cDNA vectors with the TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation for genes cloned downstream from the T7 RNA polymerase promoter, according to instructions supplied by the manufacturer (Promega). COS-7 cells were lysed with 1% Brij-96 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmiodoacetamide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2.5 μg/ml aprotonin at 48 h after transfection. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Lysates were incubated for at least 2 h at 4 °C with either 12CA5 mAb or polyclonal anti-Bid serum. Immune complexes were incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads for an additional 2 h. Precipitated proteins were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% non-fat dry milk (Nutricia) and subsequently incubated with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. Immunostained proteins were visualized by ECL. After incubation with the appropriate stimuli, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 100 μl of extraction buffer (50 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors) and allowed to swell on ice for 30 min (55Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Cells were homogenized by passing the suspension through a 25-gauge needle (10 strokes). Homogenates were centrifuged in a Beckman Airfuge at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and supernatants were harvested and stored at −70 °C until analysis by gel electrophoresis. Ten μg of cytosolic protein, as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, München) were loaded per lane onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets, which were blocked for 1 h in PBS, 0.05% Tween with 5% non-fat dry milk, and probed in PBS, 0.05% Tween with anti-Cyt c mAb (1:1000) and anti-actin mAb (1:10,000), to confirm equal loading. After incubation with a 1:7500 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig, immunostained proteins were visualized by ECL. Mouse liver cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization in mitochondrion incubation buffer (MIB): 250 mm mannitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mmHepes pH 7.2, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as described (56Petit P.X. O'Connor J.E. Grunwald D. Brown S.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei and debris were removed by a 5-min centrifugation at 600 × g at 4 °C, and a pellet containing mitochondria was obtained by a spin at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in MIB and layered on a gradient consisting of four layers of 10, 18, 30, and 70% Percoll in 225 mm mannitol, 25 mm Hepes pH 7.2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Purified mitochondria were collected at the 30/70% Percoll interface after centrifugation in a SW-41 rotor for 35 min at 13,500 ×g at 4 °C. The harvested fraction was diluted in MIB, at least 5-fold, and centrifuged for 10 min at 6,300 × gat 4 °C. After two more washes in MIB, mitochondria were resuspended in Wang-buffer B (20 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 220 mmmannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 100 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm Na2EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (3Luo X.

For monitoring Cytc release, mitochondria (25 μg/sample) were incubated in the presence or absence of the in vitrotranscription/translation mixture containing the indicated recombinant proteins (0.5–2 μl of tBid, 1 μl of Bid, Bax, Bak, or Bfl-1) in a final volume 30 μl of Wang-buffer B for 1 h at 30 °C, and then centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. Mitochondrial pellets, solubilized in SDS sample buffer at 12.5 μg/sample, and a corresponding volume of the supernatant fractions, were separated by 13% SDS-PAGE. Cyt c immunoblotting was performed as described above. Protein interaction studies were performed with 250 μg of mitochondria and 10 μl of the in vitro transcription/translation mixture in a final volume of 300 μl of Wang-buffer B. Proteins were targeted to the mitochondria by incubation for 30 min at 30 °C and then centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. Mitochondrial pellets were solubilized in 100 μl of RIPA buffer (10 mmtriethanolamine, pH 8.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors) followed by sonification. The solubilized proteins present in the supernatant (diluted in Wang-buffer B with 2% CHAPS) were precipitated with appropriate antibodies and Protein G-Sepharose beads and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Where indicated, transfected HeLa cells on coverslips were incubated in 150 nm Mitotracker Red (Molecular Probes) for 30 min prior to fixation. Cells were washed once in PBS and then fixed for 5 min with methanol kept at −20 °C. All subsequent incubations were at ro"

The metabolic cycle could be closed by cleavage of malyl-CoA affording glyoxylate (the primary CO2 fixation product) with regeneration of acetyl-CoA serving as the starter unit of the cycle. The pathway of glyoxylate assimilation to form gluconeogenic precursors has not been elucidated to date. We could now show that the incubation of cell extract with a mixture of glyoxylate and [1,2,3-13C3]propionyl-CoA afforded erythro-β-[1,2,2′-13C3]methylmalate and [1,2,2′-13C3]citramalate. Similar experiments using a partially purified protein fraction afforded erythro-β-[1,2,2′-13C3]methylmalyl-CoA and [1,2,2′-13C3]mesaconyl-CoA. Cell extracts of C. aurantiacus were also shown to catalyze the conversion of citramalate into pyruvate and acetyl-CoA in a succinyl-CoA-dependent reaction. The data suggest that glyoxylate obtained by the cleavage of malyl-CoA can be utilized by condensation with propionyl-CoA affording erythro-β-methylmalyl-CoA, which is converted to acetyl-CoA and pyruvate. This reaction sequence regenerates acetyl-CoA, which serves as the precursor of propionyl-CoA in the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle. Autotrophic CO2 fixation proceeds by combination of the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle with the methylmalyl-CoA cycle. The net product of that bicyclic autotrophic CO2 fixation pathway is pyruvate serving as an universal building block for anabolic reactions.

Briefly, acetyl-CoA (1) serves as starting unit, and biotin-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA (4) are the main CO2 fixation reactions. One turn of the proposed cycle results in conversion of acetyl-CoA into malyl-CoA (8) with consumption of 2 HCO3− and 3 NADPH. Malyl-CoA is cleaved by malyl-CoA lyase with regeneration of the starting molecule acetyl-CoA. Glyoxylate (9) is believed to be the initial CO2 fixation product (7Herter S. Farfsing J. Gad'on N.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) and ranged from 15 to 50 mg protein ml−1. Buffers contained 10% glycerol (v/v). Cell extract prepared from 2 g of autotrophically grown cells was incubated at 65 °C for 10 min and was then centrifuged (20,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min). The supernatant (3.7 ml) was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (10 ml, Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany, flow rate 4 ml min−1), which had been equilibrated with 20 mmMOPS/K+ buffer, pH 7.2 (buffer A). The column was washed with 30 ml of buffer A followed by 50 ml of buffer A plus 100 mm KCl, 100 ml of buffer A plus 160 mm KCl, 100 ml of buffer A plus 220 mm of KCl, and 100 ml of buffer A plus 500 mm KCl. Most of activity eluted with 100–180 mm KCl in buffer A; these fractions were pooled (25 ml), diluted 4-fold with 20 mm MOPS/K+ buffer, pH 7.6 (buffer B), and applied in two runs each to a Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences; 1 ml, flow rate 5 ml min−1), which had been equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 4 ml of buffer B and developed with a gradient from buffer B alone to buffer B plus 300 mm KCl over 20 ml. Active fractions (130–250 mm KCl) were pooled (8 ml) and stored at −20 °C. The formation of free CoA from propionyl-CoA after addition of glyoxylate was followed spectrophotometrically (412 nm) with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB; ε412 = 13,600m −1 cm−1). The assay mixture (0.5 ml) contained 200 mm MOPS/K+ buffer, pH 7.5, 0.25 mm DTNB, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm propionyl-CoA, 5 mm glyoxylate, and 5–50 μl of cell extract (0.1–1.0 mg of protein) or 100 μl of partially purified protein fraction (0.1 mg of protein). A reaction mixture (40 ml) containing 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 1 mm[1,2,3-13C3]propionyl-CoA, 1 mmglyoxylate, 2 mm MgCl2, 36.6 kBq of [2-14C]propionyl-CoA, and 2 ml of cell extract (48 mg of protein) was incubated at 55 °C. After 50 min, 200 ml of ethanol were added, and protein was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was concentrated by flash evaporation at 30 °C (20 mbar), and the pH was adjusted to pH 10 by addition of NaOH. The solution was extracted with diethyl ether (100 ml), and the aqueous phase was applied onto a column of Dowex WX8 50 (H+-form, 10 g) (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). The column was developed with 50 ml of water. The eluate was adjusted to pH 4.0 by addition of a 10% NH3solution (v/v) and concentrated to 2 ml by flash evaporation at 30 °C (20 mbar). Aliquots (50 μl) were applied onto a Polyspher OA HY column (300 × 6.5 mm; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), which was developed with 1 mm H2SO4, flow rate 0.8 ml min−1. The effluent was monitored by a radiomonitor (Ramona, Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) and photometrically (210 nm). A radioactive fraction eluting at a retention volumn of 6.4 ml was adjusted to pH 6 by addition of 2 mNaOH, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C. Retention volumes of reference samples: glyoxylate, 5.7 ml; citramalate, 6.2 ml;erythro-β-methylmalate, 6.7 ml; propionate, 9.0 ml; mesaconate, 12.7 ml. A reaction mixture (20 ml) containing 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 2 mm glyoxylate, 2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm [1,2,3-13C3]propionyl-CoA, 54.7 kBq of [2-14C]propionyl-CoA, and 5 ml of partially purified protein fraction (8 mg of protein) was incubated at 55 °C. After 10 min, the mixture was adjusted to pH 2 by the addition of 6m HCl. Protein was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was lyophilized, dissolved in 5 ml of water, and applied onto a reversed phase column (Grom-Sil 120 ODS-4 HE, 250 × 20 mm, 10 μm), which was developed by a step gradient (64 ml each) of 1, 2.9, 4.8, 5.7, 6.7, and 20% acetonitrile (v/v) in 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7, flow rate 8 ml min−1. The effluent was monitored by a radiomonitor and photometrically (210 nm). Radioactive fractions eluted at retention volumes of 288 and 320 ml, respectively, were adjusted to pH 2 by addition of 6 mHCl and lyophilized. Assay mixtures (0.5 ml) containing 200 mm MOPS/K+ buffer, pH 7.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 3.5 mm phenylhydrazine hydrochloride, 1 mm succinyl-CoA, 5 mm l- ord-citramalate, and 5–25 μl of cell extract (0.1–0.5 mg of protein) were monitored photometrically (324 nm) at 55 °C. Pyruvate phenylhydrazone formation was followed (ε324 = 11,520 m −1 cm−1, experimentally determined). In control experiments, succinyl-CoA was omitted or replaced by 1 mm acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, or malonyl-CoA. Alternatively, reaction mixtures (0.5 ml) containing 200 mmammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm succinyl-CoA, 10 mm l-citramalate, and 60 μl of cell extract (1.0 mg of protein) were incubated at 55 °C. Aliquots (0.1 ml) were retrieved at intervals and were mixed with 10 μl of concentrated HCl. Protein was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was analyzed by reversed phase HPLC (LiChrospher 100, endcapped, 125 × 4 mm, 5 μm, Merck). The column was developed by a gradient of 1–8% acetonitrile over 30 min in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7, flow rate 1 ml min−1. The effluent was monitored photometrically (260 nm) and acetyl-CoA eluted at a retention volume of 16 ml. Samples were dissolved in D2O at pH 6 (uncorrected glass electrode reading). 1H and13C NMR spectra were measured at 20 °C using a four-channel Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). One-dimensional experiments and two-dimensional HMQC, HMQC-TOCSY, and HMBC experiments were performed according to standard Bruker software (XWINNMR). The duration of the 1H spin-lock was 60 ms in the HMQC-TOCSY experiment. The condensation of glyoxylate with propionyl-CoA with formation of methylmalate has been reported in Rhodospirillum rubrum and Bacillus sp. (24Korkes S. Annu. Rev.

Our preliminary experiments showed that cell extracts of C. aurantiacus could form free CoA in reaction mixtures containing propionyl-CoA and glyoxylate. The glyoxylate-dependent release of CoA from propionyl-CoA was catalyzed by cell extracts of autotrophically grown cells at a specific rate of 36 nmol min−1 mg−1 cell protein, by cell extracts of heterotrophically grown cells at 4 nmol min−1 mg−1 protein. The release of CoA set in after a lag phase of 1–2 min (cell extract) and after up to 5 min (partially purified protein fraction). To study that reaction in more detail, we incubated cell extract of C. aurantiacus with a mixture of 1 mm glyoxylate, 1 mm[1,2,3-13C3]propionyl-CoA and traces of [2-14C]propionyl-CoA. Radioactive reaction products were isolated by HPLC and were analyzed by one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The 13C NMR spectrum displayed nine multiplets due to13C13C coupling, which could be assigned to three multiply 13C-labeled compounds (Fig. 2). A set of three signals (205.7, 37.3, 9.4 ppm, Fig. 2 A, Table I: experiment A) was attributed to [1,2,3-13C3]propionyl-CoA (4) by comparison with the NMR signals of authentic material. The remaining six multiplets were assigned to erythro-β-[1,2,2′-13C3]methylmalate (11) and [1,2,2′-13C3]citramalate (10) as described below. Both metabolites were characterized by doublets at chemical shift ranges typical for carboxylic atoms (181.4 and 179.4 ppm). The signal at 181.4 showed 13C coupling with the double-doublet at 73.6 ppm (coupling constant, 57 Hz), whereas the signal at 179.4 ppm was 13C-coupled with the double-doublet at 44.4 ppm (coupling constant, 54 Hz). Both double-doublets showed additional couplings to doublets resonating at chemical shifts typical for methyl atoms (25.9 and 12.9 ppm, Table I).Table INMR data of products from [1,2,3-13 C3 ]propionyl CoA in reaction mixtures with cell extracts (experiment A) and with a partially purified protein fraction of C. aurantiacus (experiment B)PositionChemical shifts, ppmCoupling constants,JccCorrelation pattern13C1HHMQCHMQC-TOCSYHMBCHzExperiment A [1,2,3-13C3]Propionyl-CoA (4) 1205.67 (dd)44.8 (2), 2.5 (3)3, e1 237.28 (dd)2.4444.9 (1), 33.7 (3)22, 3 39.42 (dd)0.9333.8 (2), 2.5 (1)33 e12.82 erythro-β-[1,2,2′-13C3]Methylmalate (11) 1179.37 (d)53.7 (2)2*, 3 244.36 (dd)2.7353.7 (1), 34.6 (2′)2, 32′ 2′12.91 (d)1.0134.7 (2)2*, 2, 3 34.08 4 [1,2,2′-13C3]Citramalate (10) 1181.37 (d)57.1 (2)2*, 3, 3′ 273.62 (dd)56.9 (1), 37.5 (2′)22*, 3, 3′ 2′25.88 (d)1.2337.5 (2)2*2*3′ 32.77, 2.50 4Experiment B β-[1,2,2′-13C3]Methylmalyl-CoA (12) 1204.50 (d)45.1 (2) 251.56 (dd)3.00 (m)34.4 (2*), 44.7 (1)22, 2*, 3 2′13.83 (d)1.02 (d)34.5 (2)2*2*, 2 3ND4.12 4ND [1,2,2′-13C3]Mesaconyl-CoA (13) 1197.7 (d)54.8 (2) 2149.6 (dd)42.5 (2*), 54.8 (1)22, 2* 2′14.5 (d)42.5 (2)2*2*, 2 3ND 4NDND, not determined. * Indicates downfield-shifted 1H NMR signals for diastereotopic protons, and 2′ indicates the methyl group attached to carbon 2 of the index compounds.

Information about the respective 1H and 13C spin networks was gleaned form two-dimensional1H13C correlation experiments. Specifically, HMQC experiments revealed information about hydrogen atoms directly connected to 13C atoms, HMQC-TOCSY experiments showed couplings between H atoms when at least one observed1H atom was directly connected to a 13C atom, and HMBC experiments highlighted 1H13C long range couplings via two or three bonds. In conjunction with the chemical shifts, the correlation patterns summarized in Table Iestablish the structural fragments boxed in Fig. 2. Since the HPLC retention times of 11 and 10 and authentic samples of erythro-β-methylmalate and citramalate, respectively, were almost identical (see “Experimental Procedures”), it appears safe to conclude that the elusive residues in 11 and 10 are carboxylic atoms. Further confirmation was achieved by addition of authentic erythro-β-methylmalate to the NMR sample. Signals assigned to erythro-β-[1,2,2′-13C3]methylmalate were selectively enhanced in HMQC and HMQC-TOCSY experiments. Since cell extracts of C. aurantiacus were expected to contain substantial amounts of thioesterases, we supposed that the immediate products of glyoxylate assimilation were CoA-thioesters, which were subsequently cleaved into the free acids detected in the experiments described above. We therefore incubated a partially purified protein fraction of C. aurantiacus, putatively containing less thioesterases, with a mixture of 2 mmglyoxylate and 1.2 mm[1,2,3-13C3]propionyl-CoA containing trace amounts of [2-14C]propionyl-CoA. HPLC analysis showed two fractions containing 40% of the proffered radioactivity. The elution conditions were typical for CoA derivatives. The fraction eluted at a retention time of 36 min (12) showed three 13C multiplets (Table I: experiment B). A doublet centered at 204.5 ppm was suggestive of a thioester carbonyl atom. The 1H NMR spectrum confirmed the presence of a CoA residue (data not shown). Two-dimensional 1H13C experiments (HMQC and HMQC-TOCSY, Fig. 3) identified a β-methylmalyl spin system carrying 13C in position 2 and 2′ but not 3. The HMQC spectrum (Fig. 3 A) showed correlations of 13C-2 and 13C-2′ with their directly attached protons. In the HMQC-TOCSY spectrum (Fig. 3 B) of the same sample, extended 1H spin systems connected by 1H TOCSY transfer are correlated to individual carbon atoms. Thus, C-2 (13C NMR signal at 51.6 ppm) showed correlation to the directly attached H-2 proton (1H NMR signal at 3.0 ppm) as well as to H-2′ (1H NMR signal at 1.0 ppm) and to H-3 (1H NMR signal at 4.1 ppm). Confirmation of the 1H spin system comprising H-2, H-2′, and H-3 was obtained from HMQC-TOCSY correlations of C-2′ to the directly attached H-2′ protons as well as to H-2 and H-3 protons (Fig. 3 B). Due to sensitivity reasons additional correlations of carbon atoms belonging to the CoA moiety were observed in the HMQC-TOCSY spectrum (Fig. 3 B). On this basis, 12 was assigned as β-[1,2,2′-13C3]methylmalyl-CoA. In the experiment with cell extracts of C. aurantiacus erythro-β-[1,2,2′-13C3]methylmalate (11) was identified as a reaction product (see above), and therefore, it appears plausible that 12 is the erythro form of β-[1,2,2′-13C3]methylmalyl-CoA. The fraction eluted at 40 min (13) displayed three13C multiplets (Table I: experiment B, Fig. 4) at chemical shifts, suggesting a thioester carbonyl atom (197.7 ppm), an olefinic carbon (149.6 ppm), and a methyl atom (14.5 ppm). Correlations observed in HMQC and HMQC-TOCSY experiments (Table I) identified the molecular fragment boxed in Fig. 4. The 1H NMR spectrum indicated the presence of a CoA residue. On this basis, 13 was assigned as [1,2,2′-13C3]mesaconyl-CoA.Figure 413 C NMR signals of compound 13 (mesaconyl-CoA) formed in a mixture containing [1,2,3-13C3]propionyl-CoA, glyoxylate, and a partially purified protein fraction of C. aurantiacus.

We found that cell extracts of C. aurantiacus could cleave l-citramalate in the presence of succinyl-CoA with formation of acetyl-CoA and pyruvate. The rate of pyruvate formation was 63 nmol min−1mg−1 with cell extracts of autotrophically grown cells and 3 nmol min−1 mg−1 with cell extracts of heterotrophically grown cells. d-Citramalate was transformed at a rate of 24 nmol min−1 mg−1by extracts of autotrophically grown cells. Acetyl-CoA formation was followed by HPLC analysis (not shown). Succinyl-CoA could not be replaced by acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, or malonyl-CoA as CoA donor. The results suggest that succinyl-CoA functions as CoA donor giving rise to citramalyl-CoA. This is in line with a short lag phase when the assay was performed with cell extract. This suggests that the reaction catalyzed is due to two enzymes, a CoA transferase and a citramalyl-CoA lyase, catalyzing Reactions 1 and 2, respectively.Succinyl­CoA+citramalate⇌succinate+citramalyl­CoAREACTION 1Citramalyl­CoA⇌acetyl­CoA+pyruvateREACTION 2 The present study aimed at elucidating the fate of glyoxylate in autotrophic CO2 fixation in C. aurantiacus. We obtained evidence for glyoxylate condensation with propionyl-CoA. The following experiments were designed to detect and identify enzyme products formed from glyoxylate and propionyl-CoA under in situ conditions without prior isolation to minimize the risk of decomposition or structural modification. For this purpose, we used [1,2,3-13C3]propionyl-CoA as the substrate to enhance the sensitivity and selectivity of 13C NMR analysis in crude reaction mixtures. Any products formed from the uniformly13C-labeled propionate without breakage of13C13C-bonds must contain a group of three contiguous 13C atoms, which form a spin system that is easily assigned via 13C13C coupling. Moreover, the 13C spin system can be extended to identify1H atoms bound directly to one of the respective13C atoms. Using two-dimensional1H13C correlation techniques, the spin system can be extended still further to include 1H atoms bound to one of the 13C-labeled positions via two or three bonds. This approach enabled us to assign the structures of enzyme products resulting from condensation of the 13C-labeled propionate moiety with glyoxylate (Fig. 5). We could show that [1,2,3-13C3]propionyl-CoA (4) can be condensed with glyoxylate (9) to form erythro-β-[1,2,2′-13C3]methylmalyl-CoA (12), which can be transformed further to [1,2,2′-13C3]mesaconyl-CoA (13) (Fig. 5) and [1,2,2-13C3]citramalate (10) or citramalyl-CoA (14). We could also show that l-citramalate (10) can be cleaved to acetyl-CoA (1) and pyruvate (15) when succinyl-CoA is present as a CoA donor. This suggests thatl-citramalyl-CoA (14) is an intermediate. The enzyme activities are substantially higher in autotrophically grown cells as compared with heterotrophially grown cells. This regulatory pattern suggests that these reactions are part of the autotrophic carbon metabolism of C. aurantiacus. The formation of erythro-β-methylmalate (11) by cell extract is believed to be due to the action of ubiquitous thioesterases. In summary, this sequence of reactions results in the conversion of glyoxylate (9) and propionyl-CoA (4) into acetyl-CoA (1) and pyruvate (15) via mesaconyl-CoA (13) (Fig. 5). Propionyl-CoA and glyoxylate are both believed to be formed in the CO2 fixation cycle of C. aurantiacus (4Strauss G. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 853-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 5Strauss G. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 6Eisenreich W. Strauss G.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4305-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 and6 A). The cyclic reactions described in the present study enable the net formation of pyruvate from three carbon dioxide molecules with regeneration of acetyl-CoA serving as starter molecule (Fig. 6 A). Hence, a bicyclic autotrophic pathway is operating. More specifically, passage of an acetate moiety through the inner cycle in Fig. 6 A in the counterclockwise direction affords glyoxylate with regeneration of acetyl-CoA, which had served as starter unit; in other words, the inner cycle is closed. The passage of acetyl-CoA through the initial part of the inner cycle in Fig. 6 A affords propionyl-CoA, which can be converted to erythro-β-methylmalyl-CoA by condensation with glyoxylate by passage through the outer cycle in Fig. 6 A in clockwise direction. Cleavage of citramalyl-CoA in the outer cycle affords pyruvate, again with regeneration of acetyl-CoA, which had served as starter unit; hence, the outer cycle is also closed. A similar but reverse reaction sequence (citramalate cycle) was proposed for the generation of glyoxylate from acetate in acetate-grown R. rubrum (29Ivanovsky R.N. Krasilnikova E.N. Berg I. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 153: 399-404Crossref Google Scholar). The inner cycle in Fig. 6 A (3-hydroxypropionate cycle) requires acetyl-CoA carboxylase (4Strauss G. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 853-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 5Strauss G. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 7Herter S.

Schägger H. Fuchs G. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2404-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and propionyl-CoA synthase (31Alber B.E. Fuchs G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12137-12143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which have all been shown to be present in C. aurantiacus. Some enzymes of the outer cycle (methylmalyl-CoA cycle) have been demonstrated in the present study but need to be studied in the future. One of the propionyl-CoA molecules (4) is carboxylated to methylmalonyl-CoA (5) by propionyl-CoA carboxylase and further converted to malyl-CoA (8) (Figs. 1 and 6, A and B). Malyl-CoA in turn is cleaved by malyl-CoA lyase, regenerating acetyl-CoA (1) and releasing glyoxylate (9). Glyoxylate condenses with the second molecule of propionyl-CoA (4) and finally yields back the second molecule of acetyl-CoA (1) and forms pyruvate (15) as net CO2 assimilation product. The pyruvate extruded by the joint operation of the two reaction cycles in Fig. 6 A can serve as precursor for PEP, which can be carboxylated to form C4 compounds in an anaplerotic reaction. PEP also serves as precursor for other C3 compounds and derived hexoses (16) and pentoses. This proposed glyoxylate assimilation pathway also explains the unique labeling patterns of building blocks observed in previous labeling studies (Fig. 6 B) (2Holo H. Grace D. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 148: 292-297Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 6Eisenreich W. Strauss G. Werz U. Fuchs G. Bacher A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When autotrophically growing cells were fed with [1-13C1]acetate or [2-13C1]acetate, the cellular building blocks showed a unique 13C labeling pattern that could not be explained by any known pathway of carbon metabolism (6Eisenreich W. Strauss G. Werz U. Fuchs G. Bacher A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Specifically, carbon from C1 of acetate was preferentially incorporated into C3 of pyruvate (15) (alanine) and into C1 and C6 of hexoses (16), whereas C2 of acetate was preferentially incorporated into C2 of pyruvate and into C2 and C5 of glucose. C1 of pyruvate was predominantly derived from CO2. These findings are all easily explained by the proposed bicyclic pathway. Fig. 6 B shows one turn of this cycle. Further cycles result in some randomization of label, which was also observed in the labeling experiment (6Eisenreich W. Strauss G. Werz U. Fuchs G. Bacher A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The proposed pathway of glyoxylate assimilation represents a new mechanism for incorporation of C2 units into central precursors and like the well known glyoxylate cycle (32Kornberg H.L. Krebs H.A. Nature. 1957; 179: 988-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) explains how acetate could be assimilated. In principle, the proposed conversion of glyoxylate plus propionyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and pyruvate should be reversible. The role of CoA-thioester intermediates is intriguing. If all intermediates were CoA-thioesters, the problem arises that for cleavage of citramalate or citramalyl-CoA, the CoA has to move from one carboxyl group in mesaconyl-CoA to the other in citramalyl-CoA (Fig. 5). Alternatively, mesaconyl-CoA is hydrolyzed and then transformed to citramalate, followed by succinyl-CoA-dependent activation to citramalyl-CoA. A third possibility is that succinate acts as CoA shuttle between mesaconyl-CoA and citramalate. Interestingly, the C. aurantiacus genome contains at least three genes, which are assumed to code for succinyl-CoA-dependent CoA transferases. One gene adjacent to a putative malyl-CoA lyase gene is likely coding for the postulated succinyl-CoA:l-malate CoA transferase (7Herter S. Farfsing J. Gad'on N. Rieder C. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Fuchs G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4305-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The other two putative CoA transferase genes are located nearby and may be involved in such a CoA transfer shuttle. There might be another, fourth CoA transferase gene on another contig. A related problem of acceptor molecule regeneration exists in Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 (33Korotkova N. Chistoserdova L. Kuksa V. Lidstrom M.E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and Streptomyces species (34Han L. Reynolds K.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5157-5164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these bacteria the regeneration of glyoxylate from acetyl-CoA was unknown. A complete reaction sequence was proposed by which two molecules of acetyl-CoA are condensed and reduced to butyryl-CoA followed by conversion to succinyl-CoA and malyl-CoA. Malyl-CoA is cleaved by malyl-CoA lyase to glyoxylate and acetyl-CoA. In summary, one molecule of acetyl-CoA is oxidized to glyoxylate (33Korotkova N. Chistoserdova L. Kuksa V. Lidstrom M.E. J.

The assembly of these proteins into a four-helix bundle may be part of the driving force for bilayer fusion. Regulated exocytosis in neurons and related cell types is specialized to be fast and Ca2+-dependent suggesting the involvement of other regulatory proteins specific for regulated exocytosis. Among these are the complexins, two closely related proteins that bind only to the assembled SNARE complex. We have investigated the function of complexin by analysis of single vesicle release events in adrenal chromaffin cells using carbon fiber amperometry. These cells express complexin II, and overexpression of this protein modified the kinetics of vesicle release events so that their time course was shortened. This effect depended on complexin interaction with the SNARE complex as introduction of a mutation of Arg-59, a residue that interacts with synaptobrevin in the SNARE complex, abolished its effects. The data are consistent with a function for complexin in stabilizing an intermediate of the SNARE complex to allow kiss-and-run recycling of the exocytosed vesicle.

Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The SNARE proteins syntaxin, SNAP-25, and vesicle-associated membrane protein (synaptobrevin), involved in regulated exocytosis in neurons and neuroendocrine cells, have been studied in most detail (3Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar,4Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). From in vitro studies, the neuronal SNAREs are sufficient for membrane fusion when reconstituted in liposomes (5Weber T.

A prime candidate for a protein that influences membrane fusion during regulated exocytosis is complexin (6McMahon H.T. Missler M., Li, C. Sudhof T.C.

First, it is dependent upon an intracellular signal such as an elevated Ca2+ concentration for its initiation (10Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 191-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Second, in synapses it is specialized to be able to occur within tens of microseconds of Ca2+ elevation (11Sabatini B.L. Regehr W.G. Nature. 1996; 384: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) through the rapid formation of a transient fusion pore (12Lindau M. Almers W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Third, rapid retrieval of the fused membrane is essential to maintain the releasable vesicle pool (13Harata N. Pyle J.L. Aravanis A.M. Mozhayeva M. Kavali E.T. Tsien R.W. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 637-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It is likely that proteins in addition to SNAREs are crucially important for the control and kinetics of fast, regulated exocytosis. Numerous proteins have been discovered that interact with the neuronal SNARE proteins, and some of these are not expressed in organisms such as yeast that lack regulated exocytosis. It is likely that these proteins either impose Ca2+ sensitivity on the fusion machinery (e.g. synaptotagmin) or contribute to the fast kinetics of membrane fusion or retrieval during synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Complexin binds to the assembled SNARE complex competitively with α-SNAP (6McMahon H.T. Missler M., Li, C. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Knockout of either one of the two complexin isoforms, I and II, produces a mild (II) or moderate (I) phenotype (14Takahashi S.-i. Ujihara H. Huang G.-Z. Yagyu K.-i. Sanbo M. Kaba H. Yagi T. Eur. J.

Cell. 2001; 104: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In contrast, the double complexin I/II knockout mouse dies shortly after birth and shows a marked impairment of Ca2+-evoked neurotransmission (15Reim K. Mansour M. Varoqueaux F. McMahon H.T. Sudhof T.C. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Cell. 2001; 104: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The exact contribution of complexin to SNARE complex assembly is controversial (9Pabst S. Margittai M. Vainus D. Langen R. Jahn R. Fasshauer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7838-7848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Tokumaru H. Umayahara K. Pellegrini L.L. Ishizuka T. Saisu H. Betz H. Augustine G.J. Abe T. Cell. 2001; 104: 421-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), but recent structural data suggest binding of a single complexin to each independent SNARE complex via association of the complexin C-terminal domain with residues from syntaxin and synaptobrevin (9Pabst S.

Here we have investigated the function of complexin by analysis of single vesicle release events in adrenal chromaffin cells using amperometry and demonstrated a novel effect of complexin II on release kinetics that depends on its interaction with the SNARE complex. The data are consistent with a function for complexin in controlling the closure of the fusion pore to elicit rapid kiss-and-run recycling of the exocytosed vesicle. A plasmid encoding complexin II (6McMahon H.T. Missler M., Li, C. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) was provided by Harvey McMahon (Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK). The coding region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and ligated into pcDNA3.1. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate the R59H mutation using the QuikChange system (Stratagene). The primers were: sense, 5′-CATGGAAGCGGAACATGAGAAGGTCCGG-3′; and antisense, 5′-CCGGACCTTCTCATGTTCCGCTTCCATG-3′. Isolated bovine adrenal chromaffin cells (18Burgoyne R.D. Boulton A. Baker G. Taylor C. Neuromethods: Intracellular Messengers. 20. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1992: 433-470Google Scholar) were plated on non-tissue culture-treated 10-cm Petri dishes and left overnight at 37 °C. Non-attached cells were resuspended in growth medium at a density of 1 × 107/ml. Plasmids (encoding EGFP and complexins) were mixed and added at 2 μg/1 × 106cells, and cells were electroporated using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). The cells were then rapidly diluted to 1 × 106/ml with fresh growth medium and added to 35-mm Petri dishes, made up to a volume of 3 ml with fresh growth medium, and maintained in culture for 3–5 days. Transfections were performed as described above, and cells were plated onto round glass coverslips (13-mm diameter). After washing twice with PBS, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for a minimum of 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice in PBS, incubated for 30 min in blocking buffer (0.3% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS), and incubated overnight at 4 °C with L668 rabbit polyclonal antibody against complexin II (provided by Dr. Harvey McMahon) at a 1:500 dilution. Cells were then washed three times, incubated for 1 h in biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) at a 1:100 dilution, washed three times, and finally incubated in streptavidin-Texas Red (Amersham Biosciences) at a 1:50 dilution for 30 min. After being mounted onto slides, cells were viewed with appropriate filters to visualize EGFP and immunofluorescence. HeLa cells were trypsinized, plated at a density of 1 × 107 on 35-mm plates, and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum. After 5 h, the cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid (pcDNA3 or the plasmids encoding complexin II or complexin II(R59H)) using 3 μl of FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After an additional 72 h, the cells were lysed in 200 μl of SDS dissociation buffer. Chromaffin cells were plated onto 35-mm plates and lysed in 200 μl of SDS dissociation buffer after 3 days. Synaptosomes were provided by Gareth Evans (The Physiology Laboratory, University of Liverpool, UK). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with L668 rabbit polyclonal antibody against complexin II (1:1000), and bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were washed twice with PBS, incubated in bath buffer (139 mm potassium glutamate, 0.2 mm EGTA, 20 mm PIPES, 2 mm ATP, and 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.5) and viewed using a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope. Transfected cells were identified as those expressing EGFP. A 5-μm-diameter carbon fiber electrode was positioned in contact with a cell. For stimulation, a glass micropipette filled with cell permeabilization/stimulation buffer (139 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm PIPES, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, 2 mmMgCl2, 20 μm digitonin, and 10 μm free Ca2+, pH 6.5) was positioned on the opposite side of the cell from the carbon fiber. An Eppendorf Transjector was used to pressure eject the buffer onto the cell for a 20-s pulse. Amperometric responses were monitored with a VA-10 amplifier (NPI Electronic), collected at 4 kHz, and digitized with a Digidata 1322A acquisition system. Data were subsequently analyzed using an automated peak detection and analysis protocol with the technical graphics program Origin (Microcal) (19Graham M.E. Fisher R.J. Burgoyne R.D. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All the data are shown as mean ± S.E., and statistical differences were assessed using the non-parametric Mann Whitney test. Complexin I is expressed mainly in neurons, but complexin II is expressed more widely. We, therefore, examined whether complexin II is expressed in adrenal chromaffin cells by immunoblotting with anti-complexin II. A single band was detected in chromaffin cells, whereas an additional smaller polypeptide due to cross-reaction with complexin I (6McMahon H.T. Missler M., Li, C. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) was also detected in rat brain synaptosomes (Fig. 1A) suggesting that chromaffin cells express mainly complexin II. Complexin II was detected in both membrane and soluble pools from chromaffin cells. For examination of complexin II function in chromaffin cells, we aimed to overexpress wild-type protein and a form with the R59H mutation. Arg-59 in complexin makes crucial contacts with synaptobrevin in the SNARE complex and is likely to be crucial for complexin binding to the complex (17Chen X. Tomchick D.R. Kovrigin E. Arac D. Machius M. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 2002; 33: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In chromaffin cells, co-transfected to express EGFP, expression of both complexin proteins above endogenous levels could be demonstrated (Fig. 1B). The transfection efficiency for chromaffin cells is too low to demonstrate expression by immunoblotting. Analysis of expression levels was carried out using HeLa cells, therefore, where similar expression levels of both wild-type and mutant proteins could be demonstrated following transfection (Fig. 1C). The effect of overexpression of complexin II on the extent of exocytosis and the characteristics and kinetics of single vesicle release events was examined using carbon fiber amperometry (20Schroeder T.J. Borges R. Finnegan J.M. Pihel J. Amatore C. Wightman R.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1061-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In each case data from transfected cells were directly compared with data from control, untransfected cells in the same dishes and using the same carbon fibers (28–38 cells for each condition). Complexin II overexpression partially inhibited exocytosis and also reduced the average charge released in each spike (Fig. 2) showing that less catecholamine was released during each exocytotic event (a reduction in quantal size). To determine whether these effects were due to interaction of complexin II with the SNARE complex or some nonspecific effect we examined the consequence of expressing the specific R59H mutant of complexin II. The specificity of the complexin II effect on exocytosis was demonstrated by the finding that complexin II(R59H) had no effect on the extent of exocytosis or on quantal size in transfected cells (Fig. 3).Figure 3Amperometric recording of evoked exocytosis and the effect of expression of complexin II(R59H).A, example traces from a control (untransfected) cell and a cell transfected to express complexin II(R59H). B and C, values for the mean number of spikes per cell (n = 33 for controls, n = 30 for complexin II(R59H)-expressing cells) and mean values of charge per spike (n = 681 spikes for controls, n = 533 spikes for complexin(R59H)-expressing cells). Cont, control; CPXII, complexin II; n.s., not significant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The characteristics of the amperometric spikes in chromaffin cells overexpressing complexin II or the R59H mutant were examined in more detail. Overexpression of complexin II modified the shape of the amperometric spikes resulting in significant decreases in height, half-width, rise time to peak, and fall time (Fig. 4A). The effect of complexin II on the frequency distribution of events is shown for half-width, which reveals a shift to a population with narrower half-widths (Fig. 4B). In contrast, expression of complexin II(R59H) had no effect on any of the spike parameters examined. Similar reductions in half-width and rise time to those seen in complexin II-overexpressing cells have been seen in chromaffin cells expressing the Munc18(R39C) mutant that has reduced affinity for syntaxin (21Fisher R.J. Pevsner J. Burgoyne R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 875-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and also following phorbol ester treatment (19Graham M.E. Fisher R.J. Burgoyne R.D. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In both cases these modifications were not accompanied by changes in spike height. As a consequence, spikes in cells expressing Munc18(R39C) or treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate showed a significant increase in the rate of rise of the spikes due to the decreased rise time (Fig. 4C). In contrast, this parameter was unaffected by overexpression of complexin II or the complexin II(R59H) mutant. These data suggest that complexin II does not modulate the initial rate of the release events, but the reduced half-width and charge suggest that it leads instead to premature termination of the release event. The shape of the resulting amperometric spikes demonstrates this point. The changes in amperometric spikes (Fig. 4D) were distinct from those in cells in which catecholamine was depleted as these showed both a reduction in height and in the initial rate of rise of the spikes (21Fisher R.J. Pevsner J. Burgoyne R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 875-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Our data show that overexpression of complexin II in chromaffin cells has two effects, an inhibition of the number of exocytotic events and also changes in the kinetics of single vesicle release events consistent with kiss-and-run exocytosis (22Fesce R. Grohovaz F. Valtorta F. Meldolesi J. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of the complexin-SNARE complex, Arg-59 of complexin makes a crucial interaction between complexin and the SNAREs (17Chen X. Tomchick D.R. Kovrigin E. Arac D. Machius M. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 2002; 33: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The reduced length of the histidine side chain compared with arginine in the R59H mutant we tested would prevent the formation of the salt bridge observed between this residue and Asp-57 of synaptobrevin. Mutation of this residue prevented the effects of complexin overexpression on both the extent and the characteristics of the release events showing that these effects were dependent on interaction of complexin II with the SNARE complex. The interaction of complexin with Asp-57 is close to the conserved zero layer residues of the SNARE complex. Mutation of the zero layer residues does not, however, have any effect on the kinetics of exocytosis (23Graham M.E. Washbourne P. Wilson M.C. Burgoyne R.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4397-4405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Finley M.F.A. Patel S.M. Madison D.V. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of complexin II on spike number is consistent with previous data showing reduced exocytosis in transfected PC12 cells overexpressing complexin I or II (25Itakura M. Misawa H. Sekiguchi M. Takahashi S. Takahashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or following acute microinjection of complexin II into Aplysia neurons (26Ono S. Baux G. Sekiguchi M. Fossier P. Morel N.F. Nihonmatsu I. Hirata K. Awaji T. Takahashi S. Takahashi M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2143-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect was ascribed to competitive inhibition by complexin of α-SNAP association with cis-SNARE complexes as it was antagonized by co-injection of α-SNAP. The effect we observed here on the kinetics of release events cannot be explained by competition with α-SNAP as we have shown that expression of a dominant negative α-SNAP mutant inhibited exocytosis in chromaffin cells but did not modify spike kinetics (27Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1281-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly spike kinetics were not modified by a reduction in SNARE availability in cells transfected to express clostridial neurotoxins (19Graham M.E. Fisher R.J. Burgoyne R.D. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We and others have previously demonstrated that the kinetics of catecholamine release and extent of release can be modified at the level of a single vesicle (21Fisher R.J. Pevsner J. Burgoyne R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 875-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 27Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1281-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Elhamdani A. Martin T.F.J.

Earles C.A. Chang P.Y. Martin T.F.J. Chapman E.R. Jackson M.B. Science. 2001; 294: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We have interpreted these data as reflecting changes in the kinetics of fusion pore expansion and fusion pore open time (32Burgoyne R.D. Barclay J.W. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 26: 176-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In support of the latter aspect we have found that spike half-width and quantal size are increased by disruption of dynamin function (33Graham, M. E., O'Callaghan, D. W., McMahon, H. T., and Burgoyne, R. D. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in pressGoogle Scholar) indicating that the release time course is sensitive to disruption of dynamin-dependent vesicle retrieval. The effect of complexin II overexpression on spike parameters was to some extent similar to that seen in cells expressing the Munc18(R39C) mutant or after treatment with phorbol ester (19Graham M.E. Fisher R.J. Burgoyne R.D. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Fisher R.J. Pevsner J. Burgoyne R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 875-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) as in all cases spike half-width and quantal size were reduced. In contrast, however, the initial rate of spike rise was increased by Munc18(R39C) and phorbol ester but not by complexin II overexpression. These data suggest that complexin II was unusual in that it did not modify the rate of fusion pore expansion, but instead its major effect was to limit the time over which release occurred. This is consistent with complexin inducing earlier fusion pore closure to give rise to kiss-and-run exocytosis. Such a specific effect on vesicle release events has not previously been described under any other conditions. Biochemical analysis of complexin has been limited to examination of its interaction with assembled cis-SNARE complexes (as would occur within the same membrane) (6McMahon H.T. Missler M., Li, C. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 8Pabst S. Hazzard J.W. Antonin W. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. Rizo J. Fasshauer D. J. Biol.

Neuron. 2002; 33: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Membrane fusion is mediated by trans-SNARE complexes that bridge two membranes. Various studies, for example using clostridial neurotoxins, have indicated the existence in cells of multiple trans-SNARE complexes assembled to differing extents prior to exocytosis (34Xu T. Rammner B. Margittai M. Artalejo A.R. Neher E. Jahn R. Cell. 1999; 99: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 35Hua S.-H. Charlton M.P. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). One possible role for complexins would be to stabilize a trans-SNARE complex intermediate that would be able to allow rapid fusion pore closure after exocytosis. The rapid binding kinetics of complexins to assembled SNAREs suggests that this interaction could occur during or following membrane fusion. This suggested role for complexins in favoring kiss-and-run exocytosis could be consistent with the phenotype of complexin I/II knockout mice that show a loss of fast synchronous neurotransmission (15Reim K. Mansour M. Varoqueaux F. McMahon H.T. Sudhof T.C. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Cell. 2001; 104: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). This is maintained by rapid recycling of a small preferentially released pool of synaptic vesicles that is reused over a time course of 1–3 s (36Pyle J.L. Kavalali E.T. Piedras-Renteria E.S. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 2000; 28: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). It is possible, therefore, that kiss-and-run exocytosis induced by complexins could be essential for the rapid internalization of vesicles into the ready releasable pool. The deficit in complexin I/II knockout mice can be overcome by elevating Ca2+ concentration (15Reim K. Mansour M. Varoqueaux F. McMahon H.T. Sudhof T.C. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Cell. 2001; 104: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) that could activate other pathways for rapid vesicle retrieval. Other functional aspects of complexin interaction with the SNARE complex cannot be ruled out, however. The ability of complexins to regulate both the extent of exocytosis and nature of vesicle recycling would make it a likely target for mechanisms regulating synaptic plasticity.

https://openalex.org/W2027331207,"Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins play central roles in chromosome organization and dynamics. They have been classified into six subtypes, termed SMC1 to SMC6, and function as heterodimer components of large protein complexes that also include several non-SMC proteins. The SMC2-SMC4 and SMC1-SMC3 complexes are also known as condensin and cohesin, respectively, but the recently identified SMC5 and SMC6 complex is less well characterized. Here, we report that NSE1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiaeencodes a novel non-SMC component of the SMC5(Yol034wp)-SMC6(Rhc18p) complex corresponding to the 2–3-MDa molecular mass. Nse1p is essential for cell proliferation and localizes primarily in the nucleus. nse1 mutants are highly sensitive to DNA-damaging treatments and exhibit abnormal cellular morphologies, suggesting aberrant mitosis as a terminal morphological phenotype. These results are consistent with the reported features of theSchizosaccharomyces pombe SMC6 gene, rad18,which is thought to be involved in recombinational DNA repair. We conclude that Nse1p and the SMC5-SMC6 heterodimer together form a high molecular mass complex that is conserved in eukaryotes and required for both DNA repair and proliferation.

SMC proteins share structural features and have been evolutionarily conserved from most prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes (1Hirano T.

They have globular N- and C-terminal domains and two extended α-helical coiled-coil domains that are involved in protein-protein interactions, separated by a hinge region. The N- and C-terminal domains, which contain a Walker A motif and a conserved sequence termed the DA-box (putative Walker B motif), respectively, are responsible for the ATPase activity of SMC proteins. In eukaryotes, six classes of SMC proteins, generally termed SMC1 to SMC6, have been identified (1Hirano T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 9Fousteri M.I. Lehmann A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). They form specific heterodimer combinations: SMC1-SMC3, SMC2-SMC4, and SMC5-SMC6. The SMC heterodimers associate with some additional non-SMC proteins to form high molecular mass complexes. The best documented high molecular mass complexes containing SMC proteins are cohesin and condensin, which contain SMC1-SMC3 and SMC2-SMC4 heterodimers, respectively. Cohesin is involved in mitotic sister chromatid cohesion, whereas condensin mediates mitotic chromosome condensation. Several important features of these SMC complexes have been revealed by the identification and characterization of their non-SMC components. For example, the cohesin complex from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two non-SMC proteins, Scc1p (10Guacci V. Koshland D. Strunnikov A.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 320-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). At the metaphase-anaphase transition, cohesin is inactivated through the cleavage of Scc1 by the separin protease Esp1p, which is activated by the anaphase-promoting complex (13Uhlmann F.

The Xenopus condensin is activated by phosphorylation of two non-SMC components, XCAP-D2 and XCAP-H, resulting in chromatin condensation in cell-free oocyte lysates (15Kimura K. Hirano M. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. Science. 1998; 282: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Recently SMC5 and SMC6 have been identified and characterized inSchizosaccharomyces pombe, Arabidopsis thaliana, and mammalian cells (9Fousteri M.I. Lehmann A.R.

(9Fousteri M.I. Lehmann A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) reported the existence of a high molecular mass complex containing Spr18p, Rad18p, and five other unidentified proteins. From the molecular size of the unidentified polypeptides (∼100, 45, 43, 37, and 35 kDa), all of them appear to be non-SMC components. Studies in S. pombeindicate that the SMC5-SMC6 heterodimer is involved in DNA repair (16Lehmann A.R. Walicka M. Griffiths D.J. Murray J.M. Watts F.Z. McCready S. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7067-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar,19Verkade H.M. Bugg S.J. Lindsay H.D. Carr A.M. O'Connell M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2905-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). rad18 mutants show increased sensitivity to UV and γ-ray irradiation, and both UV-photoproduct and double-strand break repair are delayed in these cells. In addition, Rad18p is reported to be required for the maintenance of cell cycle arrest in the presence of DNA damage (19Verkade H.M. Bugg S.J. Lindsay H.D. Carr A.M. O'Connell M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2905-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both of the genes encoding SMC5 and SMC6 are essential even in the absence of extrinsic DNA damage (9Fousteri M.I. Lehmann A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Lehmann A.R. Walicka M. Griffiths D.J. Murray J.M. Watts F.Z. McCready S. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7067-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Mutations in rad18 are synthetically lethal when combined with a DNA topoisomerase II mutation (top2–191) (19Verkade H.M. Bugg S.J. Lindsay H.D. Carr A.M. O'Connell M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2905-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), suggesting that Rad18p plays a role in chromatin organization. Moreover, cells with a deletion of rad18 or overexpressing dominant-negative rad18 exhibit a wide variety of abnormal morphologies characterized by aberrant nuclear segregation. A similar phenotype is observed in cells with a deletion of the spr18gene (9Fousteri M.I. Lehmann A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Lehmann A.R.

Despite the observations described above, the function and regulation of the SMC5-SMC6 heterodimer are poorly understood compared with the SMC1-SMC3 and SMC2-SMC4 heterodimer. This is partly because the non-SMC proteins associating with the SMC5-SMC6 heterodimer have not been identified. In the present paper, we examine the function ofYLR007w, a previously uncharacterized S. cerevisiae gene that was obtained from one of a collection of yeast mutants exhibiting abnormal nuclear morphology (20Kimata Y. Lim C.R. Kiriyama T. Nara A. Hirata A. Kohno K. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 29Watanabe K. Isolation and characterization of a novel gene SNO1, genetically interacted with NUP133 encoding a nucleoporin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Master's degree thesis. Nara Institute of Science & Technology, Ikoma, Japan1997Google Scholar). Our results strongly suggest that the product of YLR007wassociates with Yol034wp and Rhc18p, which are predicted to be theS. cerevisiae orthologues SMC5 and SMC6, respectively, to form a high molecular mass complex. Furthermore, we found thatylr007w mutant strains exhibit phenotypes resembling those of S. pombe rad18 mutants, including enhanced sensitivity to DNA-damaging treatments. We conclude that YLR007w encodes a non-SMC component of the SMC5-SMC6 high molecular mass complex, and propose that this gene be called NSE1(non-SMC element1).

Open table in a new tab Unless otherwise described, yeast strains were cultured in rich (YPD) or synthetic (SD) glucose media (for composition, see Ref. 21Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). ForGAL1 promoter induction, we used YPG or SG, which contain 2% galactose instead of glucose. SD and SG were supplemented with the appropriate amino acids. For solid media, 2% agar was added. Genetic manipulation of yeast cells was performed as described previously (21Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Yeast genomic DNA containing the NSE1gene (nucleotides –554 to 1519) was amplified by PCR, and the resulting product inserted into the yeast centromeric vectors pRS316 and pRS313 to obtain, respectively, pRS316/NSE1 and pRS313/NSE1. A fusion of S65T and S147P green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA (22Kimata Y. Iwaki M. Lim C.R. Kohno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and the NSE1 gene (open reading frame minus start codon) was inserted into the GAL1promoter-driven expression vector pGMH10 (23Iha H. Tsurugi K. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 936-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) to obtain pGFP-NSE1. Double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding three tandem repeats of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope were fused with the NSE1 gene (open reading frame minus start codon) and inserted into the ADH1-promoter-driven expression vector pAML10 (23Iha H. Tsurugi K. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 936-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) to obtain pAML10/HA-NSE1. An oligonucleotide encoding three tandem repeats of the FLAG epitope was inserted into the RHC18 gene (nucleotides −534 to 3564) and the YOL034w gene (nucleotides –893 to 3540) at positions 1 and 3279, respectively. The modified RHC18 and YOL034w genes were inserted into the centromeric vector pRS314 to generate pRS314/FLAG-RHC18 and pRS314/YOL034w-FLAG, respectively. The NSE1 gene was inserted into pGMT10 (23Iha H. Tsurugi K. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 936-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) to generate pGAL1/NSE1. By introduction of the nse1–20 mutation (see Fig.1A) into pGAL1/NSE1, pGAL1/nse1–20was obtained. A library of randomly mutagenized NSE1 genes carried on theHIS3 centromeric vector pRS313 was generated by the same procedure used to construct pRS313/NSE1, except that PCR amplification of the NSE1 gene was performed in the presence of 0.5 mm MnCl2 (error-prone PCR) (24Ewaskow S.P. Sidorova J.M. Hendle J. Emery J.C. Lycan D.E. Zhang K.Y. Breeden L.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4437-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). YKW3 cells, already containing the URA3 vector pRS316/NSE1, were transformed with this plasmid library, and 2000 independent transformants were obtained. The wild-type pRS316/NSE1plasmid was segregated by 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) selection, so that remaining NSE1 function was provided by pRS313/NSE1. pRS313/NSE1plasmids that conferred slightly slower growth than the wild-type pRS316/NSE1 were taken asNSE1 mutants. Large scale immunoprecipitation was performed for mass spectrometric analysis of the immunoprecipitates. Yeast cells (2600 optical density equivalents) were suspended in 100 ml of L1 buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mmNaCl, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin) and lysed using glass beads. After clarification by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min in an SW40Ti rotor (Beckman), the lysates were precipitated with 70% (w/v) ammonium sulfate. The pellets were dissolved with L2 buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Nonidet P-40), and incubated with 12CA5 anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and protein A-Sepharose 4F beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 120 min. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and identified by in-gel digestion using lysyl endopeptidase (Wako, EC 3.4.21.50) followed by peptide mass fingerprinting on a JMS-ELITE mass spectrometer (JEOL) (refer to Refs. 25Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7784) Google Scholar and 26Jensen O.N. Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 513-530PubMed Google Scholar). The measured masses of peptides were used to search for protein candidates in the nonredundant protein sequence data base with program ProFound (prowl.rockefeller.edu/). Small scale immunoprecipitation was performed for Western blot detection. Preparation of cell lysates, immunoprecipitation, and Western analysis were performed described previously (27Okamura K. Kimata Y. Higashio H. Tsuru A. Kohno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 28Higashio H. Kimata Y. Kiriyama T. Hirata A. Kohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17900-17908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), except that, in addition to 12CA5 antibody, M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and mouse IgG (Cappel) were used. With the same procedure as the large scale immunoprecipitation described above, cells were lysed by glass beads, and the cell lysates were clarified by ultracentrifugation. The clarified cell lysates were loaded on a Superose 6 FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with fast protein liquid chromatography buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 0.02% Nonidet P-40). The column was calibrated with a gel filtration calibration kit (Amersham Biosciences). The predicted NSE1 (YOL034w) encodes a 336-amino acid protein with 38,320 Da, which well coincides with 41 kDa of HA-tagged Nse1p as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis described later (Figs. 1A and2A). The Nse1p protein sequence was used as a query sequence to search several expressed sequence tag data bases. We could find no similarity between its sequence and previously characterized proteins, although putative human and murine orthologues (GenBank™ accession nos. AF161451 andAK009715, respectively) were found. As shown in Fig. 1A, these putative mammalian orthologues are related to Nse1p over their entire sequence (22% identity). Cysteine- and histidine-rich regions, including a conserved CXXCH motif, are located near the C terminus, suggesting that it might function as a zinc finger. These putative mammalian orthologues have so far not been characterized. As shown in Fig. 1B, ura3 nse1Δ cells carrying the URA3 NSE1 plasmid pRS316/NSE1 were sensitive to 5-FOA even in the presence of uracil. This shows that thense1Δ cells do not grow when pRS316/NSE1 is lost, indicating that NSE1 is an essential gene for vegetative cell growth. Tetrad analysis of the heterozygous yeast strain disrupted for one copy of the NSE1 gene also showed that the NSE1 gene is essential for cell viability (data not shown). To visualize the intracellular localization of Nse1p, we expressed a GFP-tagged Nse1p (GFP-Nse1p). GFP-NSE1 was able to complement the growth defect of the nse1 deletion mutant, indicating that GFP-Nse1p was functional. As shown in Fig.1C, this fusion protein was primarily localized in compartments strongly stained by 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), indicating that Nse1p is a nuclear protein. To identify proteins associating with Nse1p in budding yeast cells, we attempted to immunopurify complexes containing Nse1p. For this purpose, we generated the yeast strain SKO2 having a nse1Δbackground and expressing N-terminal HA-tagged Nse1p under the control of the ADH1 promoter. SKO2 cells grew normally, indicating that the HA-tagged version of Nse1p is functional in budding yeast cells. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” lysates of SKO2 cells and control cells producing untagged Nse1p were prepared and subjected to 70% (w/v) ammonium sulfate fractionation. The pellet fractions were resuspended and subjected to anti-HA-mediated immunoprecipitation. SDS-PAGE analysis followed by silver staining of the gel showed that only immunoprecipitates from the SKO2 cell lysate contained HA-tagged Nse1p (41 kDa) along with two other proteins (both are ∼130 kDa) (Fig. 2A). The bands corresponding to the unidentified proteins were cut out from the gel and identified through lysyl endopeptidase cleavage and mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF). As shown in Fig. 2 (B and C), these proteins were identified as the products of the YOL034w and RHC18 genes, which are predicted to encode SMC5 and SMC6 ofS. cerevisiae, respectively. To confirm the intracellular association between Nse1p and Rhc18p, we produced the yeast strain RKO2, having an nse1Δ rhc18Δbackground and expressing both N-terminal FLAG-tagged Rhc18p and HA-tagged Nse1p. As shown in Fig. 2D, RKO2 cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting. FLAG-tagged Rhc18p, as well as HA-tagged Nse1p, was detected in the anti-HA immunoprecipitate. Similarly, in the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitate, both HA-tagged Nse1p and FLAG-tagged Rhc18p were detected. In contrast, immunoprecipitation using nonspecific mouse IgG did not pull down either HA-tagged Nse1p or FLAG-tagged Rhc18p. A similar result indicating an intracellular association between Nse1p and Yol034wp was obtained using the strain YKO2, an nse1Δ yol034wΔ strain carrying HA-tagged Nse1p and FLAG-tagged Yol034wp (Fig. 2E). When the RKO2 cell lysate was subjected to gel filtration chromatography, both HA-tagged Nse1p and FLAG-tagged Rhc18p were detected in fractions corresponding to a molecular mass of 2–3 MDa (Fig. 2F). Similarly, gel filtration of theYKO2 cell lysate showed that both HA-tagged Nse1p and FLAG-tagged Yol034wp were present in fractions corresponding to a molecular mass of 2–3 MDa (Fig.2G). These observations strongly suggest that Nse1p, together with Rhc18p and Yol034wp, forms a large complex with a molecular mass of 2–3 MDa. To investigate the physiological role of Nse1p, we attempted to isolate and characterize budding yeast cells carrying mutations in the NSE1 gene. As NSE1 is an essential gene, we attempted to isolate conditional lethalnse1 mutants. For this purpose, the NSE1 gene was amplified by error-prone PCR, inserted into the centromeric HIS3 vector pRS313, and introduced into YKW3, a ura3 nse1Δ strain bearing the URA3 plasmid pRS316/NSE1 expressing wild-type NSE1. We obtained 2,000 independent transformants. After 5-FOA selection against pRS316/NSE1, transformants were screened for growth deficiency. We isolated two mutant alleles ofNSE1, nse1–14 and nse1–16, which caused slower growth of cells at both 23 and 30 °C compared with wild type. However, we failed to isolate conditional lethal mutants that are sensitive to either high or low temperatures. As the fission yeast Rad18p, which is the orthologue of budding yeast Rhc18p, is reported to be involved in DNA repair, we expected thatnse1 mutants would show defects in DNA repair. We tested whether nse1–14 and nse1–16 cells are hypersensitive to treatments which induce DNA damage. As shown in Fig.3A, growth ofnse1–14 cells on solid media was significantly retarded by irradiation with UVC light or γ-ray or exposure to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). To a lesser extent, growth retardation by these treatments was also observed innse1–16 cells treated with UVC light and MMS. As shown in Fig. 3B, the higher sensitivities of nse1–14 and nse1–16 cells to UVC light were confirmed by the quantitative UVC sensitivity assay. In contrast to the survival rate of wild-type cells (14%), nse1–16 and nse1–14showed survival rates of 1.7 and 1%, respectively, at 100 J/m2. As described above, we failed to select conditional lethal nse1 mutants from a stock of strains carrying randomly mutagenized NSE1 genes. However, we were able to obtain a conditional mutant as follows. We constructed the nse1Δ strain SKG1, containing wild-type Nse1p under the control of the GAL1 promoter. Unexpectedly, the growth of this strain did not cease in glucose media, probably because leaky expression of Nse1p was occurring even under the transcriptional repression of the GAL1 promoter by glucose. We then used site-directed mutagenesis on the Gal1-driven Nse1p gene to create mutants of NSE1 that might have weaker NSE1 function that would be manifest when expressed at low protein levels (glucose) but not at higher levels (galactose). One change introduced were amino acid replacements of two conserved Cys residues in NSE1 to Ser (nse1–20 mutation; see Fig. 1A). This construct was used to generate SKG2, a nse1Δ strain expressingnse1–20 under control of the GAL1 promoter. SKG2 cells grew normally in galactose media, but growth ceased within 24 h of being shifted to glucose media (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4 (A and B), SKG2 cells that stopped growing in glucose media showed aberrant morphology (see also Table I). When incubated in YPD medium for 24 h, 18% of the cells were multibudded, and the ratio of small budded and unbudded cells was reduced. Moreover, the ratio of cells having elongated buds was significantly increased. The nuclei of the SKG2 cells cultured in glucose media also showed various abnormal morphologies. Some nuclei were apparently fragmented or aggregated, and others were weakly stained with DAPI (Fig. 4A, a–c). In this paper, we have addressed the physiological role of the previously uncharacterised gene NSE1. As shown in Fig. 2(A–E), the product of the NSE1 gene was coimmunoprecipitated with Rhc18p and Yol034wp from cell lysates. Nse1p was detected in the same fractions as Rhc18p and Yol034wp, corresponding to a size of 2–3 MDa (Fig. 2, F and G), by size exclusion chromatography. These observations indicate that Nse1p is a component of a large molecular complex containing Yol034wp and Rhc18p, which are predicted to be the S. cerevisiae counterparts of the S. pombe Spr18p (SMC5) and Rad18p (SMC6) proteins, respectively (Table II). This idea is supported by the similarity of the phenotypes between the nse1 mutants and S. pombe cells having a rad18 deletion or mutations as described below. In S. pombe, Fousteri et al. (9Fousteri M.I. Lehmann A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) have previously reported the existence of a high molecular mass complex containing at least five unidentified non-SMC proteins in addition to Rad18p and Spr18p. The complex that we observed in this study is probably the S. cerevisiae version of this complex. This complex is conserved in eukaryotes, because, in addition to the previously reported human SMC5-SMC6 heterodimer, our data base search found several mammalian Nse1p orthologues (Fig. 1A). To avoid confusion in the nomenclature and to make their physiological functions more clear, we propose here that the genes encodingYOL034w and RHC18 be designated SMC5and SMC6, respectively, as described in Table II. Unfortunately we could not find the S. pombe Nse1p orthologue with high homology to Nse1p. However, when we used mammalian NSE1 protein sequence as a probe of data base search, spcc550.05 gene of S. pombe was captured as the candidate of Nse1p orthologue, if this sequence would contain the undetermined intron. To identify these candidates as real functional orthologues, further study is required.Table IIYeast genes encoding SMC5 and SMC6S. pombeS. cerevisiaeSMC5spr18SMC5/YOL034wSMC6rad18SMC6/RHC18 Open table in a new tab We were not able to deduce anything obvious concerning the functions of Nse1p based on its amino acid sequence alone, although a conserved CXXCH motif in the C-terminal Cys- and His-rich region was identified (see Fig. 1A). The importance of this CXXCH motif is supported by the observation that substitution of these Cys residues with serine in thense1–20 mutation leads to a growth defect. We could find no obvious nuclear localization signal in Nse1p, although Nse1p was primarily localized to the nucleus when visualized as a GFP fusion (Fig. 1C). The localization of Nse1p in the nucleus may be promoted by an association with other nuclear proteins having nuclear localization signal or DNA binding activity. In S. pombe, Rad18p has a bipartite nuclear localization signal, and is localized to the nucleus (16Lehmann A.R. Walicka M. Griffiths D.J. Murray J.M. Watts F.Z. McCready S. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7067-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 19Verkade H.M. Bugg S.J. Lindsay H.D. Carr A.M. O'Connell M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2905-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, human SMC5 and SMC6 have been reported to be nuclear proteins (18Taylor E.M. Moghraby J.S. Lees J.H. Smit B. Moens P.B. Lehmann A.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Considering the physiological role of SMC complexes in modulating chromosome structure and organization, it is reasonable that their components would be localized to the nucleus. It is apparent that Nse1p functions in the DNA repair system together with Smc5p and Smc6p. Both nse1 mutants tested so far, nse1–14 and nse1–16, have exhibited increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging treatments (Fig. 3). The involvement of SMC6 in DNA repair has been demonstrated mainly by studies on S. pombe rad18 mutants. These rad18 mutants are hypersensitive to UVC and γ-ray irradiation, and exhibit delayed repair of UV-induced double-strand DNA breaks. rad18 belongs to the same epistasis group as rhp51, which is the S. pombe orthologue of the S. cerevisiae RAD51, thought to be involved in homologous recombination (16Lehmann A.R. Walicka M. Griffiths D.J. Murray J.M. Watts F.Z. McCready S. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7067-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Moreover a defect in intrachromosomal recombination, as well as in DNA repair, is observed in a Rad18 mutant of A. thaliana (17Mengiste T. Revenkova E. Bechtold N. Paszkowski J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4505-4512Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Hence, it is likely that the Smc5p-Smc6p high molecular mass complex that contains Nse1p is involved in recombinational repair. This complex may bring together and/or hold two broken chromosome ends produced by double-strand breaks. On the other hand, Nse1p was also shown to be essential for proliferation in the absence of genotoxic treatments. As shown in Fig. 1B, deletion of the NSE1 gene is lethal. Consistent with this result, deletion of either SMC5 or SMC6 is lethal in S. pombe and S. cerevisiae. In this report, we examined the terminal phenotype of SKG2, a conditional-lethal nse1 mutant. This mutant exhibited various abnormal cellular morphologies that suggest aberrant mitosis (Fig. 4, A and B). Similar observations have been reported in rad18 and spr18 mutations, or in strains overexpressing dominant-negative rad18 mutants inS. pombe. Furthermore, mutations in S. pombe rad18 are synthetically lethal when combined with a topoisomerase II mutant (top2–191) (19Verkade H.M. Bugg S.J. Lindsay H.D. Carr A.M. O'Connell M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2905-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Hence, it is likely that the Smc5p-Smc6p complex containing Nse1p plays a role in the structural maintenance of chromosomes, a function important for mitotic events. Our results, taken together with previously reported observations, indicate that the high molecular mass complex containing Smc5p-Smc6p and Nse1p is involved in the structural maintenance of chromosomes during both DNA repair and cell proliferation. However, little is known concerning the details of the molecular mechanism of how this complex operates during these cellular events. As several important features of condensin and cohesin were revealed by studying their non-SMC components, we expect the function of the SMC5-SMC6 complex will also be uncovered through further investigation of Nse1p, the first identified non-SMC component of this complex.

To determine the mechanism by which COX2 activity promotes RMIC viability, we examined the capacity of COX2-derived prostanoids to promote RMIC survival. Although RMICs synthesize prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) ≫ PGI2 > PGF2a > TxA2, only PGI2 enhanced RMIC viability following hypertonic stress. RMICs do not express the prostacyclin receptor, but they do express the prostacyclin responsive nuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ). Hypertonic stress increased PGI2 synthesis 330% above base line and also activated a PPARδ specific reporter (delta response element (DRE)) by 90% above base line. Conversely DRE activity was only inhibited by the COX2-selective inhibitor SC236 but not by a COX1-selective NSAID (SC560). Overexpression of PPARδ using an adenovirus not only drove DRE activity but also prevented RMIC death due to COX2 inhibition. These studies are consistent with a model whereby hypertonicity activates COX2-derived prostaglandin production, which promotes RMIC viability through PPARδ. Inhibition of PPARδ activity may contribute to the renal papillary necrosis associated with analgesic and/or NSAID use.

Renal medullary interstitial cells (RMICs)1 are a distinct cell type, physically spanning the gap between the vasa recta and medullary tubules. These cells are distinguished by the presence of abundant lipid droplets comprised of long chain unsaturated fatty acids including arachidonate (1Nissen H.M. Bojesen I. Z. Zellforsch. Mikrosk. Anat. 1969; 97: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and have also recently been found to be the major site of renal COX2 expression (2Guan Y. Chang M. Cho W. Zhang Y. Redha R. Davis L. Chang S. Dubois R.N. Hao C. Breyer M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F18-F26PubMed Google Scholar). COX2 is an important factor promoting survival of RMICs following hypertonic stress (3Hao C. Kömhoff M. Guan Y. Redha Y. Breyer D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F352-F359PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hao C.M. Yull F. Blackwell T. Komhoff M. Davis L.S. Breyer M.D. J. Clin.

Blackwell T. Komhoff M. Davis L.S. Breyer M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These results may account for the finding that RMICs are an early site of injury caused by COX-inhibiting analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (5Bach P.H. Nguyen T.K. Toxicol. Pathol. 1998; 26: 73-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,6Molland E.A. Kidney Int. 1978; 13: 5-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The downstream mechanisms through which COX2 activity promotes RMIC survival remain uncharacterized. COX2 mediates the conversion of arachidonate to five major bioactive prostanoids: PGE2, PGD2, PGF2α, PGI2, and TxA2. These compounds exert a variety of cellular effects via a family of G-protein-coupled receptors that not only exhibit ligand selectivity but also differential signaling (7Narumiya S. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 8Breyer M.D. Breyer R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F12-F23PubMed Google Scholar). For example, PGI2 selectively activates a Gs-coupled cAMP-stimulating IP receptor, whereas TxA2 activates a Gq-coupled thromboxane receptor (TP receptor) (7Narumiya S. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). PGE2 interacts with at least four receptor subtypes designated EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 that couple through Gq, Gs, Gi, and Gs, respectively (7Narumiya S. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 8Breyer M.D. Breyer R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F12-F23PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have suggested that biological effects of prostanoids could be mediated via nuclear receptors including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α, δ(β), or γ. The goal of the present studies was to identify the COX2-derived products and their downstream targets promoting cell survival following hypertonic stress. Rabbit medullary interstitial cells were cultured as described previously. Briefly, female New Zealand White rabbits were anesthetized (44 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine, intramuscularly). The left kidney was removed, and the medulla was dissected and minced with a razor blade under sterile conditions in 5 ml of sterile RPMI 1640 plus 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). This homogenate was injected subcutaneously in the abdominal wall using a 14-gauge needle. Twenty days postsurgery, subcutaneous nodules appeared. The rabbits were re-anesthetized and sacrificed by decapitation, and the nodules were removed under sterile conditions. Nodules were minced into 1-mm fragments and explanted in 75-cm2 tissue culture plates. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and streptomycin and penicillin. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in 95% O2/5% CO2. Tissue culture medium was changed every 48–72 h. Cells were studied in their third to fourth passages. These cells exhibit characteristic abundant oil red O positive lipid droplets, which typifies type I RMICs (9Zusman R.M. Keiser H.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 60: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). PG production by cultured RMICs was quantitated utilizing gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometric assays as described previously (10DuBois R.N. Awad J. Morrow J. Roberts L.J., II Bishop P.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Cultured RMICs were treated with phorbol ester (10 nm) for 6 h, culture medium was replaced with fresh medium, and 2 h later culture medium was collected for prostanoid determination. PPARδ immunoblots were performed on whole cell lysates from cultured RMICs. Protein concentration was determined using bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Sigma). Twenty micrograms of protein extract was loaded in each lane of a 10% SDS-PAGE mini-gel and run at 120 V. Protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 22 V overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed three times with TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated in blocking buffer (150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% Carnation nonfat dry milk, pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with an anti-human PPARδ antibody (1:300, sc7197, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Following washing (×3), the membrane was incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:20,000, Jackson Immuno-Research Lab) for 1 h at room temperature followed by three 15-min washings. Antibody labeling was visualized by the addition of chemiluminescence reagent (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the membrane was exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film. Total RNA was extracted from cultured RMICs or rabbit aorta using Tri-zol reagent (Invitrogen). RT was performed on 1 μg of total RNA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A pair of degenerate primers was designed according to human and rat IP receptor sequences: CTGGTGCTTCMTCCGCAT (forward) and GGAAGACAGCCTTKCGGAAA (reverse). A 398-bp PCR product was amplified from rabbit aorta RNA under the following conditions: 95 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s; 72 °C for 7 min; 4 °C. A 700-bp rabbit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase PCR product was obtained from the same sample used as RNA loading control. Adenoviral vectors encoding a human PPARδ (Ad-PPARδ) were a gift of Dr. Kenneth Kinzler (11He T. Chan T. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K. Cell. 1999; 99: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). GFP adenovirus was made as previously described (4Hao C.M. Yull F. Blackwell T. Komhoff M. Davis L.S. Breyer M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A full-length green fluorescent protein cDNA (Green Lantern or GL, Invitrogen) was subcloned into pACCMV. The pACCMV shuttle plasmid contains the cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer and promoter and the SV40 polyadenylation sequence. The resulting shuttle plasmids were co-transfected into HEK 293 cells along with the pJM17 vector by SuperFect (Qiagen). Ad-GFP was generated by a homologous recombination event, resulting in plaque formation in the HEK 293 cells. The resulting infectious adenovirus was plaque-purified. For infection of RMICs, 200 μl of virus (multiplicity of infection, 100) was added to each culture dish. After a 2-h incubation, the virus was removed and fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum was added. Experiments were carried out 48–72 h after infection. A PPARδ reporter (delta response element, DRE) was generously provided by Dr. Kenneth Kinzler (11He T. Chan T. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K. Cell. 1999; 99: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). The reporter contains PPARδ and retinoid X receptor recognition motifs that were identified by an in vitro site selection approach (11He T. Chan T. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K. Cell. 1999; 99: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase PPARδ reporter plasmid and a plasmid containing Renilla luciferase driven by TK promoter were transfected into cells with using SuperFect (Qiagen). Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection for luciferase activity measurement using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Cell viability was assessed using crystal violet (12Mehlen P. Kretz-Remy C. Preville X. Arrigo A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2695-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Following treatment with NSAIDs or hypertonicity for predetermined time periods, culture medium was removed and plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The remaining viable attached cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 50% methanol for 15 min. The plates were then gently rinsed with water and dried. A solution containing 0.1 m citrate sodium, pH 5.4, and 20% methanol was added, and 30 min later, the absorbance at 570 nm was read using a spectrophotometer. The percentage of cell survival was defined as the relative absorbance of treated versus untreated cells. The unattached cells in the medium were confirmed to be dead by trypan blue exclusion assay. To identify potential prostanoid(s) responsible for the survival-promoting effect of COX2 in RMICs, the profile of prostanoids synthesized by these cells was examined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig.1, PGE2 constitutes a major component of prostanoids produced by cultured RMICs (43.4 ng/ml/h), followed by 6-keto F1α, a metabolite of PGI2 (3.1 ng/ml/h), TXB2 (1.4 ng/ml/h), PGF2α (1.3 ng/ml/h), and PGD2 (0.04 ng/ml/h). NaCl was added to abruptly increase tonicity from 300 to 500, 550, or 600 mosmol. RMICs tolerated a shift of 250 mosmol or less, but when osmolality was increased to 600 mosmol, 80 ± 12% of RMICs died (Fig.2A). The ability of exogenous PGs to promote RMIC survival following exposure to lethal hypertonic stress was examined. Pretreatment of RMICs with PGE2 or the thromboxane A2 agonist U46619 did not affect cell viability following exposure to 600 mosmol. In contrast, PGD2 and PGA2 decreased cell viability following hypertonic stress compared with vehicle-treated cells. Importantly the prostacyclin analog cPGI2 (20 μm) significantly increased RMIC survival almost 3-fold following hypertonic stress (20.0 ± 3.4% versus 55.3 ± 7.8%; n = 3; p < 0.01) (Fig.3).FIG. 3Effects of prostaglandins on viability of cultured RMIC exposed to hypertonic stress. Cultured RMICs were treated with PGE2 (10 and 20 μm), cPGI2 (10 and 20 μm), U46619 (20 μm), PGD2 (20 μm), and PGA2 (20 μm) for 12 h, followed by hypertonic stress (600 mosmol/kg) for 48 h. Cell viability was assessed using crystal violet assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 versus vehicle-treated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Potential targets of prostacyclin action on RMIC were identified by RT-PCR using primers specific for the cell surface G-protein-coupled IP receptor and nuclear transcription factor PPARδ, and by immunoblot using antibody specific for the PPARδ (13Lim H. Gupta R.A., Ma, W.G. Paria B.C. Moller D.E. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 14Hertz R. Berman I. Keppler D. Bar-Tana J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although RT-PCR demonstrated abundant expression of IP receptor in aorta, IP receptor mRNA was absent from cultured RMICs (Fig. 4). In contrast, PPARδ mRNA and protein were detected in RMIC by RT-PCR and immunoblot. Immunoreactive protein migrated at the same speed on SDS gel as recombinant PPARδ protein transduced into RMICs via adenoviral vector (Ad-PPARδ) (Fig. 4). To examine whether PPARδ is involved in RMIC survival-promoting action of COX2/PGI2 following hypertonic stress, the effect of tonicity on endogenous PPARδ activity was examined using a PPARδ reporter, i.e. a DRE luciferase reporter construct. Fig. 5 shows hypertonicity nearly doubled PPARδ transcriptional activity when RMICs were switched to a non-lethal hypertonicity of 550 mosmol (1.9 ± 0.09-versus 1.0 ± 0.02-fold; n = 3;p < 0.01). Hypertonicity also increased PGI2 production (Fig. 2B), and the exogenous PGI2 analog cPGI2 activated PPARδ reporter activity by 2.7-fold at a concentration of 20 μm (Fig. 5), suggesting a link between increased PGI2 production and PPARδ activation during hypertonic stress. Interestingly, the concentration at which PGI2 significantly activated PPARδ is identical to the concentration at which cPGI2 prevented RMIC death in otherwise lethal hypertonic culture conditions (Fig. 3). Because COX2 is a key enzyme responsible for prostanoid production in RMICs, the effect of COX2 inhibitors on PPARδ activity was examined. The COX2-selective inhibitor SC236 dose dependently inhibited the PPARδ reporter activity (from 1.0 ± 0.16- to 0.128 ± 0.12-fold in the presence of 20 μm SC236; n = 4;p < 0.01). In contrast, the structurally similar COX1 inhibitor SC560 significantly increased PPARδ activity by 1.3 ± 0.13-fold (n = 4, p < 0.05). The ability of COX inhibitors to inhibit PPARδ activity also correlated with their ability to induce RMIC death (Fig.6). Importantly, RMIC death caused by the COX2 inhibitor was prevented in cells transduced with an adenovirus-driving PPARδ expression. PPARδ activity in these cells was increased ∼5-fold from 0.128 ± 0.12- to 0.62 ± 0.11-fold (p < 0.01), with cell viability increased from 9.6 ± 0.5 to 76.6 ± 3.8% (n = 4, p < 0.01) in the presence of 20 μm SC236 (Fig. 6). When subjected to osmotic stress, RMICs are markedly sensitized to the lethal effects of COX2 inhibition. To further characterize the role of PPARδ in promoting RMIC survival, an adenoviral vector was used to overexpress PPARδ. Following hypertonic stress, low concentrations of SC236 killed RMICs. This lethal effect of COX2 inhibitor was blocked by overexpression of PPARδ (Fig.7). Medullary interstitial cells are a major source of renal prostaglandin synthesis and play an important role in modulating renal medullary blood flow and salt absorption (9Zusman R.M. Keiser H.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 60: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). COX is a key enzyme converting arachidonic acid to PGH2, which is then converted to different bioactive prostaglandins through different synthases (7Narumiya S. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 15Funk C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (3068) Google Scholar). Although COX1 is constitutively expressed in many tissues including the collecting duct, COX2 expression is generally induced by growth factors, cytokines, or osmotic stress (4Hao C.M. Yull F. Blackwell T. Komhoff M. Davis L.S. Breyer M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev.

Accumulating evidence suggests COX2 is selectively expressed in renal medullary interstitial cells where it may play a role in promoting cell survival (2Guan Y. Chang M. Cho W. Zhang Y. Redha R.

The present studies demonstrate that COX2-derived prostacyclin may be a key component allowing RMIC to survive hypertonic conditions present in the renal medulla. Cultured RMICs produce several prostaglandins including PGE2 ≫ PGI2 > PGF2α > TxA2. However, only carbaprostacyclin, an analog of PGI2, has the ability to increase the tolerance of RIMC to hypertonic stress that also increases prostacyclin synthesis. This result is consistent with early reports that show the protective effect of prostacyclin in other organ injury including the heart (18Dowd N.P. Scully M. Adderley S.R. Cunningham A.J. Fitzgerald D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and brain (19Satoh T. Ishikawa Y. Kataoka Y. Cui Y. Yanase H. Kato K. Watanabe Y. Nakadate K.

The bio-activity of PGI2 is generally via activation of a cell surface G-protein-coupled IP receptor that activates Gs and increases cAMP levels or via activation of a nuclear transcription factor PPARδ and downstream PPARδ-responsive gene transcription (13Lim H. Gupta R.A., Ma, W.G. Paria B.C. Moller D.E. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 21Forman B. Chen J. Evans R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar). The present study examined the involvement of these mechanisms in PGI2's protective effect against hypertonic stress. Only PPARδ but not the IP receptor was detected in cultured RMICs. When RMICs were switched from isotonic conditions to a hypertonic medium, PPARδ transcriptional activity was markedly increased. Activation of PPARδ by hypertonicity appears to be mediated through increased PGI2 production following hypertonic stress, based on the observations that hypertonicity also increased prostacyclin synthesis and exogenous cPGI2 directly activated PPARδ specific reporter in cultured RMICs. PPARδ is a nuclear receptor, functioning as ligand-dependent sequence-specific activator of transcription (22Lim H. Dey S.K. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 137-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the presence of ligand, PPARδ heterodimerizes with a retinoid X receptor. This heterodimer then modulates transcription by binding to a PPARδ response element or DRE in target genes. The array of specific target genes that are transcriptionally regulated by PPARδ have not yet been identified. There are several reports suggesting roles for PPARδ in adipocyte differentiation, brain function, epidermal differentiation, embryo implantation, colon cancer, etc. (11He T. Chan T. Vogelstein B.

The present studies suggest that PPARδ activation is also involved in the physiological response of RMICs to environmental osmotic stress. That COX2-mediated prostacyclin synthesis activates PPARδ in RMICs is further supported by studies showing COX-inhibiting NSAIDs blocked PPARδ reporter activity. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on PPARδ activity in RMICs is limited to the COX2-selective inhibitor, while a structurally similar COX1-selective inhibitor increased PPARδ activity rather than inhibiting its activity. This is consistent with the fact that COX2 is the predominant isoform in RMICs (3Hao C. Kömhoff M. Guan Y. Redha Y. Breyer D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F352-F359PubMed Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis that the effect of NSAIDs on PPARδ is mediated through COX inhibition. Additionally, because some NSAIDs can bind to PPARs (11He T. Chan T. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K. Cell. 1999; 99: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar), it is also conceivable that the COX2 inhibitors directly prevent PPARδ activation by competing with PGI2 activation of PPARδ. Importantly, the ability of COX inhibitor to block PPARδ activity correlated with its ability to kill RMICs; the COX2 selective inhibitor, which blocked PPARδ activity, killed RMICs, whereas the COX1 inhibitor, which did not inhibit PPARδ, did not kill RMICs. PPARδ overexpression prevented RMIC from COX2 inhibitor-induced cell death and was accompanied by restoration of PPARδ activity. These studies suggest that COX2-mediated PPARδ activity is a survival factor in RMICs. During hypertonic stress, the importance of COX2-derived products in maintaining RMIC survival is supported by studies that show RMICs treated with a sublethal dose of COX2 inhibitor will die following a mild hypertonic stress that will not otherwise kill RMICs with intact COX2 activity (4Hao C.M. Yull F. Blackwell T. Komhoff M. Davis L.S. Breyer M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Importantly, this reduced tolerance of hypertonic stress in RMICs treated with a COX2 inhibitor can be restored by activating PPARδ via PPARδ adenovirus. These studies further support the hypothesis that the survival-promoting action of COX2 activity during hypertonic stress relies on PPARδ activity. The present studies are consistent with an earlier report using colon cancer epithelial cells (11He T. Chan T. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K. Cell. 1999; 99: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar) and suggest that the survival-promoting ability of PPARδ is not only involved in the pathogenesis of tumor formation but also contributes to the physiological adaptation of RMICs to the hyperosmotic environment. In summary, hypertonicity can induce COX2 expression in renal medullary interstitial cells. Increased COX2 expression is associated with increased PGI2 production and subsequent PPARδ activation, transcriptional activity, and increased cell survival. NSAIDs, which inhibit COX2-mediated prostacyclin release, may damage renal interstitial cells by inhibiting PPARδ activity. This could contribute to the papillotoxic effect of these drugs.

By immunofluorescence microscopy, Cx43-HKKSL transiently transfected into HeLa cells showed a predominantly ER localization, although Cx43-AKKFF was localized to the perinuclear region of the cell. Sucrose gradient analysis of Triton X-100-solubilized connexins showed that either Cx43-HKKSL or Cx43-AKKFF expressed alone by HeLa cells was maintained as an apparent monomer. In contrast to Cx43-HKKSL, Cx32-HKKSL was maintained in the ER as stable hexamers, consistent with the notion that Cx32 and Cx43 oligomerization occur in distinct intracellular compartments. Furthermore, Cx43-HKKSL and Cx43-AKKFF inhibited trafficking of Cx43 and Cx46 to the plasma membrane. The inhibitory effect was because of the formation of mixed oligomers between Cx43-HKKSL or Cx43-AKKF and wild type Cx43 or Cx46. Taken together, these results suggest that Cx43-HKKSL and Cx43-AKKFF recirculate through compartments where oligomerization occurs and may be maintained as apparent monomers by a putative Cx43-specific quality control mechanism.

Prior to delivery to the plasma membrane and assembly into gap junction channels, connexins are first assembled into hexameric hemichannels (1Simon A.M. Goodenough D.A.

However, connexin hemichannel assembly appears to be more complex, because a number of intracellular compartments have been implicated in hemichannel assembly, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (7George C.H.

Defining the intracellular compartments involved in connexin hemichannel assembly is further complicated by the potential for multiple connexin trafficking pathways (10Koval M. Harley J.E. Hick E.

Because reticulocyte lysates have the capacity to oligomerize connexins translated in vitro, including Cx32 and Cx43 (9Falk M.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Zhang J.T. Chen M. Foote C.I. Nicholson B.J. Mol. Biol.

Buehler L.K. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2703-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that connexin hemichannel assembly occurs in the ER (9Falk M.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In vitro translation has provided some insights into amino acid determinants that might control connexin oligomerization and the ability of different connexins to form mixed (heteromeric) hemichannels. However, as is the case with many in vitro systems, reticulocyte lysates lack many of the structural elements and compartments present in the intact cell. Thus, oligomerization by microsomes in vitro is not strong evidence that a given process occurs in the ER. For instance, augmentation of microsomes with a liver Golgi fraction stimulates Cx32 oligomerization (18Ahmad S. Diez J.A. George C.H. Evans W.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Also, whereas Cx43 and Cx46 have the capacity to intermix when translated in vitro, the ability of these two connexins to intermix is dependent on cell phenotype and is controlled at the level of Cx46 assembly (11Das Sarma J. Meyer R.A. Wang F. Abraham V., Lo, C. Koval M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4013-4024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, Kumar et al. (8Kumar N.M. Friend D.S. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3725-3734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found by EM that baby hamster kidney cells transfected to overexpress Cx32 had structures resembling gap junction plaques localized to the ER, suggesting that Cx32 assembly can occur there. In further support of the ER as a site for Cx32 hemichannel assembly, mutant forms of Cx32 that are not assembled and that escape the ER are degraded by a putative quality control mechanism (19VanSlyke J.K. Deschenes S.M. Musil L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1933-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Previous biochemical analysis of Triton X-100-solubilized extracts from cells suggests that Cx43 hemichannel assembly occurs at the TGN (10Koval M. Harley J.E. Hick E. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Das Sarma J. Meyer R.A. Wang F. Abraham V., Lo, C. Koval M. J.

Musil and Goodenough (12Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 1065-1077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) used an extensive panel of inhibitors, including BFA, carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone, 15 °C temperature block, and Chinese hamster ovary cells with a temperature-sensitive block in secretory transport to show that assembly of Cx43 into hexamers required export from the ER. Monensin treatment also caused a 3–4-fold reduction in Cx43 oligomerization in rat osteoblastic cells, consistent with the TGN as the site for Cx43 hemichannel assembly (10Koval M. Harley J.E. Hick E. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We have also found that a Cx43-β-galactosidase fusion protein, Cx43/β-gal, which inhibits native Cx43 trafficking to the TGN, also inhibits Cx43 hemichannel assembly, again consistent with Cx43 hemichannel assembly at the TGN (11Das Sarma J. Meyer R.A. Wang F. Abraham V., Lo, C. Koval M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4013-4024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we also found that Cx43/β-gal formed sub-hexameric, heteromeric complexes with native Cx43 and Cx46 in an aspect of the Golgi apparatus, prior to the TGN (11Das Sarma J. Meyer R.A. Wang F. Abraham V., Lo, C. Koval M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4013-4024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). George et al. (7George C.H. Kendall J.M. Evans W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8678-8685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), using cells transfected with connexin-aequorin chimeras, also found subhexameric assembly intermediates enriched in purified ER, ERGIC, and Golgi apparatus fractions. By fluorescence microscopy, most of the Cx-aequorins appear to be concentrated in the perinuclear region of the cell, with some cell surface expression (20Martin P.E. George C.H. Castro C. Kendall J.M. Capel J. Campbell A.K. Revilla A. Barrio L.C. Evans W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1719-1726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cx26-, Cx32-, and Cx43-aequorin all showed similar assembly profiles, with the Golgi apparatus fraction containing the most connexin-aequorin hexamers in each case (7George C.H. Kendall J.M. Evans W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8678-8685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This, combined with our results using Cx43/β-gal, raised the possibility that native connexin assembly intermediates, such as dimers, might form in an aspect of the secretory pathway prior to the TGN. However, whether these studies reflect intermediates involved in the assembly of native connexins is not definitive, because the constructs used were connexin fusion proteins containing either an ∼23-kDa aequorin or 180-kDa β-galactosidase moiety at the extreme C terminus. The potential pitfalls of adding a large protein motif to a connexin on oligomerization was illustrated by Lauf et al.(21Lauf U. Lopez P. Falk M.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) who showed that a red fluorescent protein (DsRed)-Cx43 fusion protein was retained in an intracellular compartment which showed partial co-localization with calnexin, due to oligomerization between DsRed domains to form SDS-resistant tetramers. However, when DsRed-Cx43 was co-expressed with native Cx43 or Cx43-EGFP, it was transported to the plasma membrane where it formed heteromeric gap junction channels. This suggests that DsRed-Cx43 and wt Cx43 might have the potential to interact in the ER or another early secretory compartment. In order to investigate further connexin assembly in early secretory compartments, we produced a series of connexin-based constructs containing di-lysine targeting motifs to potentially localize them to early intracellular compartments (22Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 23Pelham H.R. Curr. Opin.

Short di-lysine motifs, oriented toward the cytosol at the extreme C terminus of a transmembrane protein, enable ER retention by inhibiting clustering into COP II-coated secretory vesicles (26Andersson H.

Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar), which disrupt cell compartmentation, this approach offers the ability to examine connexins in relatively unperturbed early secretory compartments. We found that connexin fusion proteins, Cx32-HKKSL and Cx43-HKKSL, were retained in the ER consistent with their retention signals. When expressed alone in cells, the targeted Cx43 constructs were retained as monomers. In contrast, Cx32-HKKSL, which was also retained in the ER, was assembled into hexamers suggesting that Cx32 and Cx43 hemichannel assembly occur in distinct subcompartments. Furthermore, despite the retention of Cx43-HKKSL and Cx43-AKKFF as monomers when expressed alone, these constructs had the capacity to interact with compatible native connexins. Thus, despite the trafficking of Cx43-HKKSL and Cx43-AKKFF through intracellular compartments where oligomerization is initiated, they are maintained as apparent monomers.

Rabbit anti-Cx32, mouse anti-calnexin, and anti-β-COP were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Monoclonal anti-Cx43 was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Fluorescent and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Biomag particles coated with goat anti-mouse IgG were from Polysciences (Warrington, PA). Triton X-100 was from Roche Diagnostics. Tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Unless otherwise specified, all other reagents were from Sigma. Tagged constructs were produced by PCR amplification in a Stratagene Robocycler (La Jolla, CA) using High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics), starting with rat Cx43 or Cx32 cDNA as a template. For the Cx43-based constructs, the sense primer was 5′-CGGGGTACCG AATTCCCCAG ACATGGGTGA CTGGA-3′, and the antisense primers were either 5′-CCGCTCGAGT TAGAGTGACT TCTTGTGAAT CTCCAGGTCA TCAGGCC-3′ (HKKSL) or 5′-GGCCTGATGA CCTGGAGATT GCTAAGAAGT TCTTCTAACT CGAGCGG-3′ (AKKFF). Cx32-HKKSL was produced using 5′-CGGGGTACCG AATTCGAATG AGGCAGGATG AACTG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGT TAGAGTGACT TCTTGTGGCA GGCTGAGCA TCGGTCGC-3′ as the sense and antisense primers, respectively. The resulting PCR products were cut with KpnI and XhoI, ligated into a pcDNA3 expression vector, and transformed into bacterial stocks. DNA for transfection was purified from bacteria using the Qiagen Maxiprep kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prior to transfection, cDNA was purified by EtOH precipitation. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with either wild type or modified connexin cDNA constructs using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) at 2 μg/ml DNA using LipofectAMINE/DNA ratios of either 3:1 (μl/μg) for 100-mm dishes or 4:1 (μl/μg) for 35-mm dishes and analyzed 48 h after transfection. Transfection efficiencies using this approach were typically greater than 70%. In some experiments, previously generated, stably transfected HeLa/Cx43myc and HeLa/Cx46 cells were transiently transfected in a manner comparable with wild type HeLa cells. For immunofluorescence, cells plated on glass cover slips were fixed and permeabilized with MeOH/acetone (1:1), then washed 3× with PBS, followed by PBS + 0.5% Triton X-100 and PBS + 0.5% Triton X-100 + 2% heat-inactivated goat serum (PBS/GS). The cells were incubated with primary antisera diluted into PBS/GS for 1 h, washed, and then labeled with secondary antisera diluted into PBS/GS. The cells were then washed with PBS, mounted into Mowiol, and visualized by fluorescence microscopy using an Olympus X-70 microscope system with a 40× UPlanApo oil immersion objective (1.0 numerical aperture) with the iris diaphragm partially closed to limit the contribution of out of plane fluorescence and filter packs suitable for green (U-MWIBA BP460-490 DM505 BA515-550) and red (U-MNG BP530-550 DM570 BA590-800+) fluorescence.

Cells were washed with PBS, harvested into PBS containing protease inhibitors (10 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl chloride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaVO4 and 10 mmNaF), and then passed through a ball bearing homogenizer 100 times (10Koval M.

The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min using a IEC CL3R centrifuge and then the resulting post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min using a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge to obtain a membrane-enriched pellet. To analyze total cell connexin expression, this pellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and then detected by immunoblot. Densitometric analysis of non-saturated films was performed using the Kodak IDAS system (Eastman Kodak). For detergent solubilization studies, the membrane-enriched pellet was resuspended in PBS + inhibitors containing 1% Triton X-100 and then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The sample was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g from 30 min and separated into Triton X-100-soluble supernatant and -insoluble pellet fractions. The soluble and insoluble fractions were then resuspended into SDS-PAGE sample buffer and assayed by immunoblot. Co-immunopurification was done starting with the Triton X-100-soluble fraction prepared as described above. Magnetic goat anti-mouse IgG-coated particles were incubated with the Triton X-100-soluble fraction for 2 h with mouse anti-Cx43 antisera in PBS containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% gelatin. The magnetic particles were then added to the Triton X-100-soluble fraction, incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, and isolated using a ceramic magnet (Stratagene). The particles were washed with cold PBS, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and then analyzed by immunoblot. Sucrose gradient fractionation was done using post-nuclear supernatants solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting Triton X-100-soluble fraction was overlaid onto a 5–20% sucrose gradient. The gradient was centrifuged at 148,000 × g for 16 h in a Sorvall Ultra Pro 80 centrifuge using an AH-650 swinging bucket rotor. Following centrifugation, 0.5-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the centrifuge tube at 4 °C and then analyzed by immunoblot. The preloading dye transfer assay for gap junction formation was done as described previously (32Koval M. Geist S.T. Westphale E.M. Kemendy A.E. Civitelli R. Beyer E.C. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) with modifications. Donor and acceptor HeLa cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE with 2 μg/ml either wt Cx43 or Cx43-HKKSL or Cx43-AKKFF or simultaneously with 1 μg/ml wt Cx43 plus 1 μg/ml Cx43-HKKSL or 1 μg/ml wt Cx43 plus 1 μg/ml Cx43-AKKFF and allowed to recover for 36 h. Donor cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in tissue culture medium containing 1 mg/ml Texas Red dextran (Mr 10,000) as a non-transferable, endocytosed marker. The cells were then washed and incubated in minimum Eagle's medium containing 10 μm calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C to load the cytoplasm of donor cells with calcein. The donor cells were then washed, trypsinized, and then mixed at a 1:10 ratio with unlabeled, trypsinized acceptor cells. The cells were co-cultured for 5 h, and the specific transfer of calcein from donor to acceptor cells was scored by fluorescence microscopy using a blinded coding system. Data were expressed as the fraction of calcein-positive acceptor cells as calculated from at least 150 donor cell-acceptor cell interfaces from 2 to 4 independent experiments. Cx43-based cDNA constructs containing two different di-lysine-based retention motifs, Cx43-HKKSL and Cx43-AKKFF, were produced as described under “Materials and Methods.” To define the intracellular trafficking of these constructs, Cx43-HKKSL and Cx43-AKKFF were transiently transfected into HeLa cells and then examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. In contrast to wild type Cx43, which showed high levels of transport to the cell surface (Fig. 1), both Cx43-HKKSL and Cx43-AKKFF were preferentially retained in intracellular compartments. We used immunofluorescence co-localization to identify compartments containing the targeted Cx43 constructs (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2, Cx43-HKKSL showed significant co-localization with the ER marker, calnexin. In contrast, Cx43-AKKFF did not show significant overlap with the ER, consistent with the “weaker” AKKFF ERGIC retention signal. However, both Cx43-HKKSL and Cx43-AKKFF had significant overlap with β-COP (Fig. 2). Because di-lysine-based motifs interact with coatamer proteins (28Cosson P. Letourneur F. Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar,29Dogic D. Dubois A. de Chassey B. Lefkir Y. Letourneur F. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), this was not unexpected. However, because there are multiple aspects of the Golgi apparatus that co-localize with β-COP in the perinuclear region of the cell at the level of fluorescence microscopy (33Marsh B.J. Mastronarde D.N. Buttle K.F. Howell K.E. McIntosh J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2399-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), we cannot precisely define the post-ER compartments containing Cx43-HKKSL and Cx43-AKKFF. Note also that the morphology of the β-COP-labeled perinuclear compartment was variable for wild type HeLa cells, as well as transfected HeLa cells expressing di-lysine connexin fusion proteins. Cx43-AKKFF also occasionally assembled into gap junction plaques localized to the plasma membrane, suggesting that there was some Cx43-AKKFF transport through late elements of the secretory pathway. In contrast, cells transfected with Cx43 HKKSL did not show detectable Cx43-HKKSL at the cell surface by immunofluorescence. To assess further the extent of Cx43 incorporation into plaques, we examined the solubility of Cx43-HKKSL and Cx43-AKKFF in Triton X-100, because Cx43 assembled into gap junction plaques is not soluble in 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. As shown in Fig. 1d, wild type Cx43 showed both Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions, where the Triton-soluble fraction contained only the NP form of Cx43, and the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction contained both non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of Cx43 (10Koval M. Harley J.E. Hick E. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Das Sarma J. Meyer R.A. Wang F. Abraham V., Lo, C. Koval M. J.

Consistent with the relative strength of these retention signals, there was some Cx43-AKKFF in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, whereas nearly all of the Cx43-HKKSL was in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction. This was consistent with functional studies that showed that HeLa cells expressing Cx43-AKKFF were fairly well coupled as opposed to cells expressing Cx43-HKKSL (see below). Neither Cx43-HKKSL nor Cx43-AKKFF showed phosphorylation to the P1 and P2 forms observed for wild type Cx43. However, Cx43-HKKSL routinely resolved as a doublet by gel electrophoresis (see also Fig. 6), with the majority of the protein showing an apparent mass of 42 kDa along with a minor 40-kDa band. Because Cx43-AKKFF showed predominantly the 42-kDa band, this was suggestive of potential intracellular phosphorylation (35Laird D.W. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 36Puranam K.L. Laird D.W. Revel J.P. Exp.

Paul D.L. Kobe S.S. Lau A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1754-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). However, samples from Cx43-HKKSL-transfected HeLa cells treated with 2 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase for 4 h at 37 °C (39Laird D.W. Puranam K.L. Revel J.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) showed little change in the doublet migration pattern (data not shown) suggesting that this was not the case. The nature of the 40-kDa band is not clear at present. One possibility is that this may represent a Cx43 cleavage product (19VanSlyke J.K. Deschenes S.M. Musil L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1933-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar,40VanSlyke J.K. Musil L.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We then examined the oligomerization of ER-retained Cx43 constructs by sucrose gradient fractionation. As shown in Fig. 3a, the Triton X-100-soluble fraction of wild type Cx43 showed the characteristic pattern of two peaks, centered at 8–10% sucrose and 15–17% sucrose, which correspond to monomeric and oligomerized Cx43, respectively. In contrast, the same fraction isolated from HeLa cells expressing either Cx43-HKKSL or Cx43-AKKFF alone showed only the monomer peak. There was little, if any, oligomerized connexin present in these Triton X-100-soluble fractions. Thus, there were no apparent intracellular Cx43-HKKSL or Cx43-AKKFF oligomers, when they were the only connexin expressed by HeLa cells. Because it has been suggested that Cx32 hemichannels may be oligomerized in the ER (8Kumar N.M. Friend D.S. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3725-3734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether a Cx32-HKKSL construct might be oligomerized. As shown in Fig. 4a, Cx32-HKKSL is retained in the ER, showing a similar intracellular distribution to Cx43-HKKSL. However, in contrast to Cx43-HKKSL, virtually all of the Cx32-HKKSL expressed by HeLa cells resolved to a peak at 15% sucrose in the gradient. This was due to oligomerization, because pretreatment with SDS caused the Cx32-HHKSL peak to shift to a lighter sucrose density fraction (Fig. 4b). Thus, Cx32-HKKSL and Cx43-HKKSL were maintained in the ER in different states of oligomerization, suggesting that Cx32 and Cx43 may oligomerize in distinct intracellular compartment"

The mechanism by which CAPS functions in exocytosis and the means by which it associates with target membranes are unknown. We identified two domains in CAPS with distinct membrane-binding properties that were each essential for CAPS activity in regulated exocytosis. The first of these, a centrally located pleckstrin homology domain, exhibited three properties: charge-based binding to acidic phospholipids, binding to plasma membrane but not DCV membrane, and stereoselective binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Mutagenesis studies revealed that the former two properties but not the latter were essential for CAPS function. The central pleckstrin homology domain may mediate transient CAPS interactions with the plasma membrane during Ca2+-triggered exocytosis. The second membrane association domain comprising distal C-terminal sequences mediated CAPS targeting to and association with neuroendocrine DCVs. The CAPS C-terminal domain was also essential for optimal activity in regulated exocytosis.

Biol. 1998; 14: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The cytosolic proteins required for MgATP-dependent priming consist of phosphatidylinositol transfer protein and PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase (4Hay J.C. Martin T.F.

A single cytosolic factor, Ca2+-dependent activator protein for secretion (CAPS), is necessary and sufficient for Ca2+-triggered vesicle fusion after MgATP-dependent priming has been completed (1Hay J.C.

Moreover, studies in permeable synaptosomes indicated that CAPS was selectively required for Ca2+-dependent DCV but not synaptic vesicle exocytosis (13Tandon A. Bannykh S. Kowalchyk J.A. Banerjee A. Martin T.F. Balch W.E. Neuron. 1998; 21: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, membrane-bound CAPS in brain homogenates was found to reside on DCVs but not synaptic vesicles (14Berwin B. Floor E. Martin T.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The basis for the association of CAPS with membranes and its mechanism in DCV exocytosis remain to be clarified. CAPS and its invertebrate orthologs form a unique family of novel proteins that exhibit limited sequence homology to members of the Munc13 protein family that function in synaptic vesicle fusion (15Koch H. Hofmann K. Brose N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The only functional domain annotated in CAPS with high confidence by sequence analysis tools such as SMART (24Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar) is a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain located in a central region of the protein. In the current work, we studied the properties of the PH domain and its role in CAPS function. PH domains found in numerous proteins consist of ∼100-amino acid, structurally related modules that bind phospholipids and serve as membrane association or regulatory domains (16Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 17Hyvonen M. Macias M.J. Nilges M. Oschkinat H. Saraste M. Wilmanns M.

Our studies demonstrate through mutagenesis that the PH domain is required for CAPS function in regulated exocytosis. The properties of the CAPS PH domain that were essential for function were its charge-based interactions with acidic phospholipids and its ability to associate with specific cellular membranes (plasma membrane but not DCV membrane). A distinct membrane association domain was found to mediate the targeting of CAPS to DCVs. This domain comprising the C-terminal 177 amino acid residues was also essential for CAPS function in regulated exocytosis. The presence of two membrane association domains with distinct membrane binding specificities may enable CAPS to bind both target membranes to facilitate DCV-plasma membrane fusion. PC12 cells were cultured as described in Ref. 20Klenchin V.A. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F. Methods. 1998; 16: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar. COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were transfected by electroporation using conditions described by Van den Hoff et al. (21Van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) with 50 μg of plasmid DNA/107 cells. Electroporation was performed using an Invitrogen Electroporator II at 1000 microfarads/330 V for PC12 cells or 300 V for COS-1 cells. Electroporated cells were plated in 10-cm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% bovine serum, 5% horse serum, and 10% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were grown for 48 h before use in studies. The cDNA encoding CAPS was fused with a triple HA tag at the 3′ end of coding sequences and subcloned into a pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) to create pCMVCAPS(HA)3. To fuse CAPS with triple HA at the stop codon in CAPS cDNA, an EcoRI site was introduced in place of a stop codon. A 4146-bp fragment of cDNA containing stop codon was amplified by PCR using GCTGCGCGTAACCACCACA and GGACCCAGAGAATGAATTCGT primers. Full-length CAPS cDNA was reconstituted by the ligation of a PCR product digested withSacI and EcoRI with the upperKpnI-SacI fragment of CAPS cDNA and cloned into KpnI-EcoRI sites of pBluescriptII SK+ (Stratagene). This construct was called pBCAPSEcoRI. DNA encoding the 12CA5 triple HA epitope tag cloned in pBluescriptII SK− was obtained from M. D. Rose (22Roof D.M. Meluh P.B. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The triple HA tag was amplified with CGGCGAATTCTTTTACCCATACG and GGACTGTCAAGCGTAATCTGGAA primers. The forward primer was designed to introduce an EcoRI site in frame with the EcoRI site at the end of CAPS coding sequence, and the reverse primer was designed to introduce a stop codon at the end of triple HA tag sequence. PCR amplified HA tag was cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) and excised by EcoRI and NotI. HA tag was cloned intoEcoRI-NotI sites of pBCAPSEcoRI. Finally the CAPS(HA)3 coding cassette was excised using KpnI and NotI and cloned into the KpnI-NotI sites of the pcDNA3 vector. To tag CAPS with Myc tag and His6 tag at the C terminus, the cDNA of CAPS was excised from pCMVCAPS(HA)3 with XhoI and EcoRI and cloned into XhoI-EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.1/myc-His(−)B vector (Invitrogen). This construct was called pCMVCAPSmyc6xHis. Recombinant C-terminally tagged CAPS proteins expressed in COS-1 cells and purified to homogeneity were as active in the secretion assay (see below) as native CAPS from rat brain cytosol (data not shown). Plasmid pGEX4T-PHD-myc6xHis was constructed to provide a convenient way to purify the PH domain from Escherichia coli lysates with GST at the N terminus and His6 at the C terminus. To construct the plasmid, a CAPS cDNA fragment encompassing nucleotides 1548–1880 of coding sequence was amplified by PCR using the primers CCTCAAAGGATCCCTCGCTGTCCGAATGGATAAG (containing aBamHI site) and GCTTGGGTACCTGCACCTGGGTAGGGGGCACAG (containing a KpnI site). The PCR product was digested withBamHI and KpnI and cloned into theBamHI-KpnI sites of pcDNA3.1/myc-His(−)B, which provided the PH domain with Myc-His6 tag at the C terminus. This cassette containing the His-tagged PH domain was excised using BamHI and PmeI and cloned intoBamHI-SmaI sites of the pGEX4T1 vector (AmershamBiosciences). The plasmid pCAPSPH-GFP was constructed to express the CAPS PH domain fused at its C terminus with EGFP in mammalian cells. A CAPS cDNA fragment consisting of nucleotides 1548–1880 of the reading frame was produced by PCR using the primers CCTCGAGAACATGCTCGCTGTCCGAATGGATAAG (containing a XhoI site and a Kozak sequence) and GCTTGGGTACCTGCACCTGGGTAGGGGGCACAG. The PCR product was cloned into theEcoRV site of the pZero2.1 vector. The PH domain-encoding fragment was excised with XhoI and KpnI and cloned into the XhoI-KpnI sites of the pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH). The plasmid pCAPS-CT177-GFP was constructed to express the 177-residue CAPS C-terminal fragment fused at its C terminus with EGFP in mammalian cells. A CAPS cDNA fragment was produced by PCR using the primers AAAAAAGCTTAAAATGATCACACTCTTGGTGGCAAAGT (containing a HindIII site and a Kozak sequence) and agggcggactgggtgctca with the plasmid pCMVCAPS-GFP as a template. The fragment encoding last 177 residues of CAPS was digested with HindIII and EcoRI and cloned into the HindIII-EcoRI sites of the pCMVCAPS-GFP plasmid in place of excised full-length CAPS. The plasmid pCMVCAPSΔC135-TEV6xHis was constructed to express CAPS with a deletion of C-terminal 135 residues fused with His6tag with an intervening tobacco mosaic TEV protease cleavage site. Oligonucleotides AATTCGAAAACCTGTATTTTCAGGGCCATCACCATCACCATCACTGAGTTTAAACC and TTAAGGTTTAAACTCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGCCCTGAAAATACAGGTTTTCG were annealed into duplexes that were flanked with EcoRI- and AflII-compatible overhangs and this was ligated into EcoRI-AflII sites of the pcDNA3.1mycHis(−)B vector to obtain pcDNA3.1TEV6xHis. CAPS cDNA was excised from pCMVCAPSmyc6xHis usingXhoI-EcoRI and cloned intoXhoI-EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.1TEV6xHis in frame with C-terminal TEV-His6 tag to obtain pcDNA3.1CAPS-TEV6xHis. A fragment of CAPS cDNA was amplified using the primers TCACAAACACCTGCAGGATCTGTTCGC and CAATAAGAATTCATACTTAGATGCCGCCTTCAC, and the PCR product was digested with SdaI and EcoRI for ligation intoSdaI-EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.1CAPS-TEV6xHis in place of an excised fragment to yield the construct pCMVCAPSΔC1154-TEV6xHis. To introduce mutations into the full-length CAPS cDNA, a fragment consisting of nucleotides 1170–2458 of the coding sequence was amplified by PCR and the product was cloned into the SmaI site of the pBluescript II KS− vector. The construct was used as a template in site-directed mutagenesis performed using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). The CAPS fragments were checked by sequencing and then digested with AflII and Eco47III for insertion into the AflII and Eco47III sites of pCMVCAPS(HA)3 in place of the corresponding wild type fragment. To mutagenize CAPS PH domain, the pGEX4T-PHD-myc6xHis and pCAPSPH-GFP plasmids were used as templates. Purification of the recombinant CAPS PH domain containing two purification tags expressed in E. coli was conducted by a two-step affinity protocol. Expression of proteins in the E. coli strain DH5α was carried out, and cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm ATP, and 10 mmMgCl2, and homogenized by sonication followed by addition of 1% Triton X-100. The homogenate was incubated 10 min at room temperature to shift heat shock proteins from the recombinant protein, 10 mm DTT was added, and the clarified homogenate was passed through a column of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (AmershamBiosciences). Following a wash with 100 column volumes of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol, the column was equilibrated with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and eluted with 20 mmreduced glutathione in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Protein eluted from glutathione-Sepharose column was applied to a column of Ni-NTA-Sepharose (Qiagen), and the column was washed with 10 column volumes of 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.6, 250 mmNaCl, 10% v/v ethylene glycol and eluted with 150 mmimidazole, pH 7.6, 20% ethylene glycol. To purify the recombinant CAPS expressed in COS-1 fibroblasts, COS-1 cells were transfected with pCMVCAPSmyc6xHis encoding wild type or mutant CAPS proteins. 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested using phosphate-buffered saline with 5 mm EDTA, washed into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, and lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 1%(v/v) Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5. Lysates centrifuged at 80,000 × g were applied to a column of Ni-NTA-Sepharose (Qiagen), and the column was washed with 50 column volumes of lysis buffer, with 50 column volumes with buffer of the same composition as lysis buffer excluding detergent, and with 20 column volumes of 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.6, 250 mmNaCl, 10% v/v ethylene glycol, and eluted with 150 mmimidazole, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl. Liposome binding assays with 0.178 mm immobilized recombinant glutathioneS-transferase-CAPS PH domain fusion protein were performed essentially as described (23Loyet K.M. Kowalchyk J.A. Chaudhary A. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8337-8843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Liposomes consisted of either PtdChol/PtdSer/phosphoinositide (0.39 mm, 0.183 mm, 0.137 mm), PtdChol/PtdSer/PtdIns(4,5)P2 (0.275 mm, 0.137 mm, 0.137 mm) or PtdChol/PtdSer (0.366 mm, 0.183 mm). All liposomes also contained [3H]PtdChol (0.5 mCi/reaction). Incubations of liposomes with glutathione-Sepharose beads were terminated by sedimentation for 5 min at 500 × g, and the beads were washed with a 10-fold volume of buffer and extracted with 10% SDS (10-fold volume). The first supernatant (A), wash supernatant (B), and bead SDS extract (C) were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting, and liposome binding was calculated as (dpm in C)/(dpm A + B + C) × 100%. A nonlinear least squares fit to the data (Microcal Origin) was determined using the equation [bound] = Bmax× [free]/(KD + [free]), where [bound] is the concentration of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in liposomes bound, [free] is the concentration of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in free liposomes, Bmax is the saturation binding, and KD is the dissociation constant. Lipid binding was also assessed using a lipid-protein overlay assay. Nitrocellulose membranes with 100 pmol of 12 different lipids spotted and dried on them (PIP-Strips) were purchased from Echelon Inc. (Salt Lake City, UT). The assay was conducted using the manufacturer's protocol with minor modifications. COS-1 cells were transfected with pCMVCAPS(HA)3 encoding wild type or PH mutant CAPS proteins. 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested using phosphate-buffered saline with 5 mm EDTA and washed three times with KGlu buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 120 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm EGTA). Cell pellets were resuspended in KGlu buffer containing 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and cells were homogenized by multiple passes through a 10-μm clearance ball homogenizer. Cytosols were prepared by centrifugation at 80,000 ×g and concentrated to 2–5 mg/ml by ultrafiltration using Centricon 50 (Amicon) devices. The relative content of wild type and mutant CAPS was estimated by Western blot and adjusted with cytosol from nontransfected COS-1 cells to equalize the amount of CAPS per milligram of cytosol protein. Analysis of the activity of COS-1 cytosols and purified CAPS in the secretion assay was performed as described (20Klenchin V.A. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F. Methods. 1998; 16: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were labeled with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]norepinephrine (Amersham Biosciences) plus 0.5 mm sodium ascorbate for 16 h at 37 °C, and the Ca2+-triggered release of [3H]norepinephrine was determined in 3-min incubations at 30 °C. Results are plotted as percentage of [3H]norepinephrine release by normalization to the total content of [3H]norepinephrine per incubation. To determine the membrane localization of CAPS and CAPS fragments, PC12 cells were transfected with pCMVCAPS(HA)3, pCAPS-PH-GFP, pCMVCAPS-GFP, or pCMVCAPS-CT177-GFP plasmids, plated on tissue culture dishes, and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were resuspended and plated onto poly-l-lysine-treated coverslips for 24 h prior to processing for microscopy. To visualize membrane structures to which CAPS or CAPS PH domains bound, cells were permeabilized with 0.05% saponin or 0.025% digitonin, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and either further fixed in cold (−20 °C) methanol/acetone (2:1 v/v) or extracted with 0.3% Triton X-100. Standard immunocytochemical methods were used with the following antibodies: CAPS polyclonal antibody generated to full-length protein and affinity-purified, GFP polyclonal or monoclonal antibody (Panvera) at 1:1000, TGN-38 monoclonal antibody (clone 2F7, generously provided by Dr. K. Howell) at 1:50, SNAP-25 monoclonal antibody (Sternberger) at 1:1000, mannosidase II polyclonal antibody (generously provided by K. Moremen) at 1:400, and synaptotagmin I luminal domain peptide antibody (Sigma) that we affinity-purified or synaptotagmin I monoclonal antibody (Synaptic Systems GmbH) at1:200. Secondary reagents used were fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-rabbit and Texas Red goat anti-mouse antibodies. Fluorescence was imaged with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal imaging system. Analysis of the full-length CAPS sequence using the SMART algorithm (24Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar) revealed two putative functional domains, a C2 domain and a PH domain (Fig. 1A), in a central region of the protein. The presence of the PH domain was confirmed by Pfam and Blast programs. The CAPS PH domain is highly conserved among rat, Drosophila melanogaster (69.1% similarity), and C. elegans (59.1% similarity) proteins (Fig. 1C), suggesting a possible functional role. PH domains in other proteins mediate interactions with phosphoinositides, with other acidic phospholipids, or with proteins (16Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 17Hyvonen M. Macias M.J. Nilges M. Oschkinat H. Saraste M. Wilmanns M.

Because CAPS functions in membrane fusion and is associated with DCVs and plasma membranes as a peripherally bound protein (14Berwin B. Floor E. Martin T.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we determined the properties of the PH domain and whether it is essential for CAPS function in exocytosis. To assess the phospholipid- and membrane-binding properties of the CAPS PH domain, a purified recombinant GST-CAPS PH protein was immobilized for binding studies with liposomes of defined phospholipid composition. Whereas the CAPS-PH fusion protein did not bind PtdChol liposomes (data not shown), it did bind PtdChol/PtdSer liposomes (Fig.2A) and PtdChol/PtdIns liposomes (data not shown). Structural modeling studies indicated that the CAPS PH domain, similar to other PH domains (36Blomberg N. Baraldi E. Nilges M. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), exhibits a strongly polarized charge distribution with numerous positively charged residues at the face of the PH domain (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the electrostatically polarized CAPS PH domain interacts with the negatively charged surface of liposomes via nonspecific electrostatic interactions, binding studies with PtdChol/PtdSer liposomes were conducted at various ionic strengths (Fig. 2B). The electrostatic nature of the binding was confirmed by the finding that liposome interactions were significantly reduced at 400 mm KCl. Full-length CAPS has been shown to interact with PtdIns(4,5)P2 (23Loyet K.M. Kowalchyk J.A. Chaudhary A. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8337-8843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To determine whether the CAPS PH domain exhibited phosphoinositide binding, liposomes consisting of PtdChol/PtdSer (2:1 molar ratio) or of PtdChol/PtdSer with phosphoinositides PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2, or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (3:1:0.6 molar ratio) were incubated with the immobilized GST-CAPS-PH protein. Control liposomes containing relatively higher concentrations of PtdSer were used to approximate the electrostatic charge of phosphoinositide-containing liposomes. CAPS-PH domain binding to liposomes was significantly enhanced by inclusion of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the PtdSer-containing liposomes (Fig.2A). In contrast, binding was not enhanced by the inclusion of PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, or PtdIns(3,4)P2 (Fig. 2A). To further characterize CAPS PH domain binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2, liposomes comprising PtdChol/PtdSer (3:1 molar ratio) with graded concentrations of PtdIns(4,5)P2 were used. The CAPS PH domain exhibited an apparent KD of 14 μm for PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding (Fig. 2C). The specificity of phosphoinositide binding to the CAPS PH domain was further examined in a protein overlay assay in which binding to phospholipids immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane was assessed (Fig. 2D). The synthetic phospholipids used share a common dioctonoyl glycerol composition, which eliminates the contribution of fatty acyl chains to the specificity of binding. The results confirmed that the CAPS PH domain preferentially binds PtdIns(4,5)P2(Fig. 2D). Lesser binding to PtdIns(5)P, PtdIns(3,5)P2, and PtdIns(3)P was also detected in the overlay assay, but binding to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was negligible. Binding of the CAPS PH domain to acidic phospholipids such as PtdSer was not detected, but this can be attributed to the non-bilayer configuration of phospholipids in the overlay assay. Compared with most other PH domains tested in the overlay assay (27Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), the CAPS PH domain exhibits a strong preference for binding PtdIns(4,5)P2 over PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Overall, these results indicate that, in addition to nonspecific electrostatic interactions with negatively charged phospholipids, the CAPS-PH domain exhibits stereoselective interactions with phosphoinositides with a strong selectivity for PtdIns(4,5)P2 over PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Studies were conducted to determine the cellular membrane-binding properties of the CAPS PH domain. We first determined the cellular membrane-binding properties of the full-length CAPS protein overexpressed in PC12 cells. Native CAPS is a predominantly soluble protein in neural and neuroendocrine cells but is also present as a peripheral membrane protein on DCVs (14Berwin B. Floor E. Martin T.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We confirmed that overexpressed CAPS was localized diffusely throughout the cytoplasm as a soluble protein (data not shown). However, when cells were detergent-permeabilized prior to fixation to extract soluble protein, CAPS retained on membranes was localized exclusively to DCVs (Fig.3, A–C). Similar results were obtained expressing full-length CAPS in C-terminal fusion with GFP (data not shown). In cells expressing CAPS-GFP, localization to DCVs was evident above the diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence, which indicates that detergent permeabilization does not artificially alter the membrane binding and cellular localization of CAPS. To assess interactions of the CAPS PH domain with cellular membranes, a C-terminal GFP fusion protein was expressed in PC12 cells. The CAPS PH-GFP fusion protein also distributed as a soluble protein throughout the cytoplasm (data not shown) and exhibited a stable association with membranes following detergent permeabilization. However, unlike full-length CAPS, the CAPS PH-GFP fusion protein associated with the plasma membrane, indicated by co-localization with SNAP-25 (Fig.4, D–F), and with Golgi membranes"

We constructed a Mer chimera using the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) extracellular and transmembrane domains and the Mer cytoplasmic domain. Stable transfection of the Mer chimera into interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent murine 32D cells resulted in ligand-activable surface receptor that tyrosine autophosphorylated, stimulated intracellular signaling, and dramatically reduced apoptosis initiated by IL-3 withdrawal. However, unlike multiple other ectopically expressed receptor tyrosine kinases including full-length EGFR or an EGFR/Axl chimera, the Mer chimera did not stimulate proliferation. Moreover, and in contrast to EGFR,Mer chimera activation induced adherence and cell flattening in the normally suspension-growing 32D cells. TheMer chimera signal also blocked IL-3-dependent proliferation leading to G1/S arrest, dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, and elongation of cellular processes. Unlike other agonists that lead to a slow (4–8 days) ligand-dependent differentiation of 32D cells, the combinedMer and IL-3 signal resulted in differentiated morphology and growth cessation in the first 24 h. Thus the Merchimera blocks apoptosis without stimulating growth and produces cytoskeletal alterations; this outcome is clearly separable from the proliferative signal produced by most receptor tyrosine kinases.

Mer mRNA is most highly expressed in testis, ovary, prostate, lung, and kidney and is detected in peripheral blood monocytes but not in granulocytes (1Graham D.K. Dawson T.L. Mullaney D.L. Snodgrass H.R. Earp H.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 647-657PubMed Google Scholar). It is expressed early during mouse embryonic development, being present in the blastocyst (15Graham D.K.

To date, evidence gathered by multiple groups hints at physiologic roles for the individual family members, but a coherent view of Mer (or Axl or Tyro3) signaling as it relates to function has yet to emerge. A large scale biochemical purification approach, using conditioned media from cell lines, identified Gas6, a transcript whose expression increases in senescent cells as a ligand for Axl (17Manfioletti G. Brancolini C. Avanzi G. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Gas6 also binds to Tyro3 as does protein S (18Stitt T.N. Conn G. Gore M. Lai C.

The subtle nature of the individual gene knockout phenotypes, monocyte hyper-reactivity to stimuli, and splenic enlargement in part due to apoptotic debris (Mer (30Camenisch T.D. Koller B.H.

Nature. 1999; 398: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar)) led to a collaboration in which animals lacking all three members of the family were produced. These “triple knockout” animals were infertile, a phenotype due to a Sertoli cell defect (30Camenisch T.D. Koller B.H. Earp H.S. Matsushima G.K. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3498-3503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown recently (32Scott R.S. McMahon E.J. Pop S.M. Reap E.A. Caricchio R. Cohen P.L. Earp H.S. Matsushima G.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar) that the apoptotic debris inMer−/− animals and immune dysregulation characterized by high levels of autoantibodies may be the result of a demonstrable defect in triggering the ingestion of apoptotic cellular material. This defect, particularly the immune dysregulation, is even greater in the triple knockout animals (33Lu Q. Lemke G. Science. 2001; 293: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). A mer-specific, selective phagocytic defect toward apoptotic material is also exhibited in the pigmented retinal epithelial cells of the eye (34D'Cruz P.M. Yasumura D. Weir J. Matthes M.T. Abderrahim H. LaVail M.M. Vollrath D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 35Gal A., Li, Y. Thompson D.A. Weir J. Orth U. Jacobson S.G. Apfelstedt-Sylla E. Vollrath D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 270-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), leading to retinal degeneration. Investigation of a rat model of adult blindness, in which pigmented retinal epithelial cells fail to ingest the apoptotic tips of rods and cones on an ongoing basis, first identified an inherited mutation in the rat Mer tyrosine kinase gene that truncates the gene product (34D'Cruz P.M. Yasumura D. Weir J. Matthes M.T. Abderrahim H. LaVail M.M. Vollrath D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, theMer−/− mice show retinal degeneration as they age.1 Finally, at least three human families with inherited retinitis pigmentosa have different mutations in the MerTK gene, all of which abolish Mer tyrosine kinase activity (35Gal A., Li, Y. Thompson D.A. Weir J. Orth U. Jacobson S.G. Apfelstedt-Sylla E. Vollrath D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 270-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). To study the signal emanating from the Mer tyrosine kinase, we constructed a chimeric receptor molecule, hoping to achieve stable expression of a ligand-dependent Mer tyrosine kinase. This was accomplished by replacing the extracellular domain of Mer with a ligand binding and transmembrane domain of the rat EGF receptor (EMC). Several groups (36Di Fiore P.P. Segatto O. Taylor W.G.

Biol. 1994; 14: 663-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) had previously transfected chimera receptor tyrosine kinases into the IL-3-dependent murine leukemic cell line 32D c13 (32D) and had shown that these receptors could replace the ability of IL-3 to suppress apoptosis. All tyrosine kinase transmembrane receptors, except one, resulted in both survival and rapid proliferation of 32D cells even after IL-3 withdrawal. The exception, the IGF1 receptor, resulted in apoptosis suppression and slow growth in 32D cells (40Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M. Soddu S. Cristofanelli B. Sacchi A. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12423-12430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The IGF1receptor signal resulted in a differentiated granulocyte-type phenotype over 6–8 days, mimicking the effect of a cytokine, G-CSF (41Kato J. Sherr C.J. Blood. 1990; 75: 1780-1787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J. Caracciolo D. Johnson K. Mavilio F. Altmann S. Santoli D. Rovera G. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3829-3835PubMed Google Scholar). Separate populations of 32D cells, which express neither Mer nor EGF receptor, were transfected with either EMC or full-length EGFR, and stable cell populations were selected. Interestingly and in contrast to multiple tyrosine kinases tested in the 32D cell including the EGFR/Axl chimera, ligand-dependent EMC activation prevented apoptosis upon IL-3 withdrawal without stimulating proliferation and caused cell shape changes. More surprisingly, in some 32D cell clones the Mer signal produced a dramatic morphologic change that was coincident with a blockade of IL-3-dependent growth. Thus Mer, at least as a chimeric receptor, is capable of producing an unusual signal in comparison to other receptor tyrosine kinases; blocking apoptosis in the absence of increased cell proliferation although altering the cytoskeleton. This latter capability may explain the failure of monocytes (32Scott R.S. McMahon E.J. Pop S.M. Reap E.A. Caricchio R. Cohen P.L. Earp H.S. Matsushima G.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar) and pigmented retinal epithelial cells (34D'Cruz P.M. Yasumura D. Weir J. Matthes M.T. Abderrahim H. LaVail M.M. Vollrath D.

Murine EGF (receptor grade) was purchased from BD PharMingen. Interleukin-3 (IL-3) was obtained by culturing WEHI cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The monoclonal antibodies specific for phosphotyrosine (PT66 and RC20) were obtained from Sigma and Transduction Laboratories. The anti-rat EGFR antibody used for immunoprecipitation (1382) was made as described using purified rat liver EGFR as an immunogen (43McCune B.K. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15501-15507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EGFR immunoblotting was performed using an antibody (number 22) raised against a fusion protein glutathione S-transferase/EGFR C terminus (44Luetteke N.C. Phillips H.K. Qiu T.H. Copeland N.G. Earp H.S. Jenkins N.A. Lee D.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Anti-Mer antibodies were obtained by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with a bacterially expressed glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein containing the C-terminal-most 100 amino acids of human Mer. Anti-AKT, anti-phospho-AKT, anti-p38, anti-phospho-p38, anti-p44/42, and anti-phospho-p44/42 were obtained from Cell Signaling. Anti-Rb antibody was obtained from BD PharMingen. PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294 was purchased from Sigma, the MEK inhibitor, U0126, was purchased from Promega. The EGFR/Mer chimera (EMC) was constructed by combining the extracellular and transmembrane regions of the EGFR with the intracellular domain of Mer. This was accomplished by PCR-directed insertion of a SalI restriction site into a basic stretch of amino acids (RRR or RKR) that are conserved just inside of the transmembrane domain in many tyrosine kinase receptors, including the EGFR and Mer. The EGFR extracellular domain was amplified with oligonucleotide EMC-2R (5′-gagagagagtcgacgcatg aagaggccgagccc-3′) in conjunction with an extended T7 vector primer (attgtaatacgactcactata), generating the EGFR extracellular domain with a silent mutation in the juxtamembrane Arg-Arg-Arg sequence. The PCR product was then cut with EcoRI andSalI and cloned into pBSII SK+ (Stratagene). The Mer intracellular domain was amplified with the oligonucleotide EMC-1F (5′-gagagagagagacgtcgacgagtccaggagacaaagtttggg-3′) in conjunction with the extended T7 primer, and the PCR product was TA-cloned (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer's instructions. An NsiI toHindIII fragment from the original full-length cDNA was used to replace all of the PCR-generated sequence except for the 28 bp immediately downstream of the SalI site. The mammalian expression plasmid was generated by introduction of the full-length chimera EcoRI fragment into the EcoRI site of the expression vector pLXSN (45Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7 (, 984–986, 989–990): 980-982PubMed Google Scholar). 32D parental cells (25Palaszynski E.W. Ihle J.N. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 1872-1878PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 15% heat-inactivated FBS, 5% WEHI 3B conditioned media (to provide IL-3), and 1× penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were washed twice in serum-free RPMI 1640, and then DNA was added, either vector, full-length EGFR, or EMC. The cells were electroporated using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser Apparatus and immediately transferred to complete media. After 48 h 650 ng/ml geneticin (G418, Invitrogen) was added to the media. The growth and apoptosis analysis experiments shown in this report were replicated using two separate transfection populations and four distinct clones, two from each of the independent populations. Kinase-inactive EMC was made by site-directed mutation of lysine 619 to methionine. The mutated EMC was packaged in a murine retrovirus; 32D cells were infected, and a stable population was selected in G418. Approximately 5 × 106 cells from each cell line were resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis solution (4m guanidinium isothiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.5% sarcosyl, and 0.1 m2-mercaptoethanol), and total RNA was isolated by the acid phenol procedure (46Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). The first strand cDNA was prepared using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. Five microliters of the first strand cDNA was amplified in a 50-μl PCR usingTaq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). To test for the integrity of the RNA samples and for template standardization, amplification by PCR using actin primers (HACA-1F and HACA-1R) was performed. The expression of Mer, EGFR, and EMC in the samples was analyzed using primers specific for each cDNA. Amplifications were performed for 35 cycles with an annealing temperature of 60 °C. The sequence of the primers is as follows: actin-HACA–1F, 5′-CCTTCCTGGGCATGGAGTCCT-3′; HACA-1R, 5′-GGAGCAATGATCTTGATCTTC-3′; Mer-3F, 5′-CACCTCTGCCTTACCACATCT-3′; and 2R, 5′-ATCCACAAAAGCAGCAAAGA-3′ (specific to the mer extracellular region absent from the chimeric cDNA); EGFR-1F, 5′-AAAGACTGCAAGGCCGTGAA-3′; 2R, 5′-GCCCAGATGGCCACACTTC-3′; EMC–1F, 5′-TAACGTGTGCCACCTCTGC-3′; and 2R, 5′-TCCTCACTGACTCCCAAGC-3′. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis of 10 μl of each reaction on a 1.0 or 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. 32D vector alone (control), EGFR, and EMC were seeded at 20 × 104 cells per ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated FBS with or without 5% WEHI conditioned medium (source of IL-3) or 100 ng/ml EGF. At the indicated times flasks were scraped, and cells were counted using a hemocytometer. The EMC-expressing cell populations were resuspended at 5 × 105 cells/ml in serum/WEHI-free media and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h prior to each experiment. The cells were then treated with 100 ng/ml EGF, pelleted, and lysed with ice-cold new lysis buffer (NLB, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 50 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmNa3VO4, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μl of leupeptin per ml, 4 KIU of aprotinin per ml). Lysates were clarified, divided, and either boiled in SDS Laemmli sample for lysate Westerns or used for immunoprecipitations. Polyacrylamide gels were loaded and immunoblotted. Cells were washed twice with 1× PBS, resuspended in anti-EGFR 1382 polyclonal antibody, and incubated on ice for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times in 1× PBS, resuspended in anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with FITC antibody, and incubated 30 min on ice, followed by 3 washes in 1× PBS and then analyzed by flow cytometry with FACSTAR plus (BD PharMingen). An annexin V-FITC-labeled apoptosis detection kit was used as instructed by the manufacturer (Genzyme). The procedure evaluates an early event in apoptosis, in which phosphatidylserine (PS) is translocated from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, thereby exposing PS to the external environment. Annexin V has a high affinity for PS and therefore binds to cells with exposed PS. Briefly, 32D vector alone or 32D EMC cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 plus 15% heat-inactivated FBS supplemented with no addition, 5% WEHI-conditioned medium (source for IL-3), or 50 ng/ml murine natural EGF (receptor grade) for 24, 48, or 72 h. Both adherent and non-adherent cells were harvested and washed twice in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). To analyze apoptosis, cells were then resuspended in annexin binding buffer at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml and incubated in the presence of optimized amounts of FITC-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodine (PI) for 15 min. The percentage of apoptotic cells was evaluated by flow cytometry with a FACStar plus (BD PharMingen). To analyze the cell cycle, cells at the indicated times were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol overnight. The next day the cells were washed twice in calcium- and magnesium-free PBS, followed by a 1-h incubation with 50 μg/ml PI and 50 μg of DNase-free RNase, and analyzed by flow cytometry. 32D cells were grown on coverslips in regular media with 100 ng/ml EGF, 10 μm LY294, or 10 μm U0126. At the appropriate time, cells were washed with 1× PBS and then fixed with methanol. Cells were then stained with Wright Giemsa Stain (Sigma), washed with 1× PBS and then briefly with water. Cells were viewed through a ×20 objective, and images were captured through a CCD camera and analyzed by Scion/Photoshop imaging software. To investigate the consequences of ligand-dependent Mer activation, we constructed a chimeric receptor placing the Mer tyrosine kinase domain under the control of the EGF receptor ligand-binding domain (Fig.1 A). The full-length receptor chimera is predicted to be a protein 1143 amino acids in length, with a molecular mass of 127 kDa. However, since the extracellular domain of the EGFR is heavily glycosylated and contributes ∼110 kDa to the mature chimera, the estimated molecular mass of the mature EMC is ∼170 kDa. Transient transfection of the full-length EGFR and EMC in CHO-K1 cells revealed tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors of the appropriate size on phosphotyrosine immunoblots. In addition, immunoprecipitation with anti-extracellular domain EGFR antibody 1382 precipitated active tyrosine kinases from EGF receptor or EMC-transfected CHO-K1 cells as assessed with in vitroautokinase activity assays with added [32P]ATP (data not shown). Following transfection of the vector alone (pLXSN), full-length EGFR, or EMC and selection in G418, expression of EGFR and EMC mRNA was assessed by reverse transcriptase-PCR. MermRNA expression from murine spleen is shown for comparison. Murine Mer was not expressed in any 32D cell populations, and the EGF receptor was not detected except in the EGF receptor-transfected line. EMC was expressed only in the lines transfected with EMC cDNA (Fig.1 B). Oligonucleotides utilized to detect EMC expression were specifically designed to span the junction between chimeric partners. Likewise, EGFR and Mer expression were verified by utilizing oligonucleotides designed to regions of mRNA not expressed in the chimera (see “Materials and Methods”). To detect surface receptor protein expression, flow cytometry was performed using an antibody that recognized the extracellular domain of the EGFR, the extracellular portion of both EGFR and EMC. Control 32D cells did not express either receptor, whereas the amount of EGFR and EMC on the respective transfected clones was similar (Fig. 1 C). Neither EGFR nor EMC were expressed at levels that produced constitutive, ligand-independent receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. Fig. 2 A shows the absence of EMC tyrosine phosphorylation in untreated cells and the rapid accumulation of tyrosine phosphate in EMC immunoprecipitated from EGF-treated cells. Other experiments showed EMC tyrosine phosphorylation within 60 s of EGF addition. The results indicate that EMC-expressing 32D cells are an excellent model in which to assess ligand-dependent Mer signaling. To study whether the EGF receptor or the Mer chimera activated downstream events differentially, we examined phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) containing substrates after a 5-min EGF stimulation of full-length EGFR or EMC-expressing 32D cell lines. EGF stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple substrates in both cell lines; the pattern of Tyr(P) substrates clearly differed between the two receptors. As expected, EGF did not stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation in parental or vector-transfected 32D cells. The similarity of ligand-dependent receptor autophosphorylation in the EGF and EMC-expressing 32D cell lines substantiates the comparable expression of receptor as indicated by flow cytometry (Fig. 2). The pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates in EMC-bearing cells was both more substantial and complex than that of the EGFR-bearing cells. Thus, d"

Large-diameter conducting airways are supported by cartilaginous rings and smooth muscle tissue and are lined by ciliated and secretory epithelial cells that are involved in mucociliary clearance. Smaller peripheral airways formed during branching morphogenesis are lined by cuboidal and squamous cells that facilitate gas exchange to a network of fine capillaries. The factors that mediate formation of these changing cell types and structures along the length of the airways are unknown. We report here that conditional expression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-18 in epithelial cells of the developing lung caused the airway to adopt structural features of proximal airways. Peripheral lung tubules were markedly diminished in numbers, whereas the size and extent of conducting airways were increased. Abnormal smooth muscle and cartilage were found in the walls of expanded distal airways, which were accompanied by atypically large pulmonary blood vessels. Expression of proteins normally expressed in peripheral lung tubules, including SP-B and pro-SP-C, was inhibited. FGF-18 mRNA was detected in normal mouse lung in stromal cells surrounding proximal airway cartilage and in peripheral lung mesenchyme. Effects were unique to FGF-18 because expression of other members of the FGF family had different consequences. These data show that FGF-18 is capable of enhancing proximal and inhibiting peripheral programs during lung morphogenesis.

With advancing development, the proximal conducting airways are distinguished from the lung periphery, which contains highly vascularized alveoli that mediate gas exchange. In the proximal lung, conducting airways are supported by cartilage and smooth muscle and lined by a stratified, pseudostratifed, or simple columnar epithelium. In the normal lung periphery, alveolar ducts and alveoli are devoid of cartilage and lined by cuboidal and squamous cells. The mechanisms by which these proximal and distal regions of the respiratory tract are formed from endodermal precursors remain poorly understood. Stereotypic branching of the endodermally derived lung buds requires inductive signals provided by the mesenchyme that are mediated, in part, by the binding of members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF)1 family of polypeptides to fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) on target cells (1Klint P.

Haffner-Krausz R. Gorivodsky M. Lonai P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11895-11899Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), likely binding FGF family members that are secreted locally to regulate cellular activities in a paracrine manner. Because the sites and levels of expression in FGF family members and receptors vary during lung development, the precise temporal-spatial expression of various FGF polypeptides might influence the differentiation, proliferation, and migration of target cells, which in turn might influence the formation of the distinct proximal and peripheral regions of the lung. The importance of FGF signaling in lung morphogenesis has been demonstrated in a number of animal models in vivo. Expression of a dominant-negative FGFR with the SP-C promoter in vivo blocked branching morphogenesis of the lung and was associated with complete loss of the distal subset of respiratory epithelial cells, demonstrating a critical requirement for FGFR signaling in lung formation (17Peters K. Werner S. Liao X. Wert S. Whitsett J. Williams L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3296-3301Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Likewise, selected targeting of the FGFR2-IIIb isoform blocked limb and lung development in vivo, findings identical to those in the FGF-10-null mice, supporting the primary role of FGFR signaling in lung morphogenesis (18De Moerlooze L. Spencer-Dene B. Revest J. Hajhosseini M. Rosewell I. Dickson C. Development. 2000; 127: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas FGFR3- and FGFR4-null mice did not have abnormalities in lung formation, double-null FGFR3/FGFR4 mice developed emphysema in the postnatal period, demonstrating a more subtle effect of FGFR3 and FGFR4 on postnatal lung architecture (19Weinstein M., Xu, X. Ohyama K. Deng C.X. Development. 1998; 125: 3615-3623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise ligands mediating FGF signaling by these receptors have not been clarified, and it remains unclear how the precise temporal, spatial, and stoichiometric expression of various FGF polypeptides might influence cell proliferation, migration, or differentiation of various lung cell types during normal branching morphogenesis. A model in which interactions between FGF-10 and BMP-4 signaling pathways may regulate the sites and extent of proximal-distal lung maturation and branching has been proposed (20Hogan B.L.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 225-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar).

Physiol. 1996; 271: L987-L994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), neither FGF-7 nor FGF-10 altered the spatial patterning of respiratory epithelial cell markers or the proximal-distal patterning of lung structures in analogous mouse models. Postnatally, intratracheal administration of FGF-7 caused diffuse alveolar and bronchiolar cell hyperplasia and markedly increased the expression of surfactant proteins in type II epithelial cells, demonstrating the sensitivity of the postnatal lung to increased FGF signaling (23Ulich T.R., Yi, E.S.

Despite the marked proliferative effects of FGF-7in vivo, morphogenesis of the fetal lung was not perturbed in FGF-7 gene-inactivated mice, suggesting redundant activity of FGF polypeptides or lack of a requirement for FGF-7 in lung formation (24Guo L. Degentein L. Fuchs E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion of FGF-10 blocked formation of the lung, with residual tissue consisting of only an upper trachea (25Min H. Danilenko D.M. Scully S.A. Bolon B. Ring B.D. Tarpley J.E. DeRose M. Simonet W.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3156-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 26Sekine K. Ohuchi H. Fujiwara M. Yamasaki M. Yoshizawa T. Sato T. Yagishita N. Matsui D. Koga Y. Itoh N. Kato S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Effects of increased expression of FGF-10 on lung morphogenesis were similar to but also distinct from those of FGF-7; the former caused organized pulmonary adenomas in the postnatal period (27Clark J.C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11858-11864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Conditional expression of both FGF-7 and FGF-10 caused proliferation of cuboidal type II epithelial cells and increased the expression of type II epithelial cell markers including pro-SP-C and SP-B in the fetal lung and did not perturb proximal to distal patterning of the conducting airways (27Clark J.C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11858-11864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Recent evidence also supports a distinct role for FGF-9 in lung morphogenesis. FGF-9 is expressed most highly in the epithelium and visceral pleura of the lung, and its targeted deletion causes lung hypoplasia in vivo (6Colvin J.S. White A.C. Pratt S.J. Ornitz D.M. Development. 2001; 128: 2095-2106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because many FGF family members are expressed in the developing lung, the precise roles of each of these polypeptides and whether they serve distinct or overlapping functions in the formation of the lung remain unclear. FGF-18 is a member of the FGF polypeptides expressed in various tissues including the lung. In the fetal lung, FGF-18 was detected in subsets of mesenchymal cells; the timing and pattern of expression of FGF-18 were distinct from those of FGF-10 or FGF-9 (8Hu M.C. Qiu W.R. Wang Y. Hill D. Ring B.D. Scully S. Bolon B. DeRose M. Luethy R. Simonet W.S. Arakawa T. Danilenko D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6063-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). FGF-18 binds to various FGFRs with high affinity but does not bind to FGFR1 isoforms, properties that overlap with those of FGF-7 (which binds and activates FGFR2-IIIb) and FGF-10 (which binds to both FGFR2-IIIb and FGFR1-IIIb receptor isoforms) (29Luo Y., Lu, W. Mohamedali K.A. Jang J.H. Jones R.B. Gabriel J.L. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16506-16515Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Xu J. Lin Z. Ornitz D.M. Development. 2000; 127: 1833-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the role of FGF-18 during lung morphogenesis, conditional expression of FGF-18 was achieved in transgenic mice utilizing the reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) in respiratory epithelial cells under control of the SP-C promoter. In contrast to findings in similar models expressing FGF-7 or FGF-10, FGF-18 altered the length, caliber, and epithelial cell differentiation of conducting airways, increasing the size of peripheral pulmonary blood vessels. In addition, FGF-18 induced ectopic cartilage formation in the lung, supporting the concept that FGF-18 selectively influenced the programming of a number of proximal elements of the lung at the expense of peripheral lung development. A permanent transgenic mouse line bearing the SP-C-rtTA transgene was established in FVB/N background after oocyte injection of a plasmid construct consisting of 3.7 kb of the human SP-C promoter placed 5′ to the rtTA gene construct (27Clark J.C.

Physiol. 1991; 261: L349-L356PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse FGF-18 cDNA was inserted between the (teto)7CMV promoter and the 3′-untranslated region of the bovine growth hormone gene as described previously (Ref. 27Clark J.C. Tichelaar J.W. Wert S.E. Itoh N. Perl A.-K.T. Stahlman M.T. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L705-L715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Fig.1). The rtTA and (teto)7constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Herman Bujard, Heidelberg (32Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar). Offspring of all founders were screened by Southern blot or PCR analysis. Mice transmitting the (teto)7CMV-FGF-18 transgene were bred to SP-C-rtTA mice. The transgenic SP-C-rtTA “activator” line used has been stable for more than 3 years in the vivarium. Heterozygous and homozygous (teto)7CMV-FGF-18 mice were viable and without observable abnormalities. Two separate target lines bearing the (teto)7CMV-FGF-18 transgene (lines A and B) were chosen for breeding to SP-C-rtTA activator mice. Transmission of both transgenes followed typical Mendelian inheritance patterns. All mice were maintained in a pathogen-free vivarium. Doxycycline (0.5 mg/ml) was administered in drinking water or in food pellets (25 mg/g; Harlen Teklar, Madison, WI) for the described time periods. Drinking solution containing doxycycline was changed 3 times/week, whereas activity of the doxycycline was stable in the food pellet (33Perl A.-K.T. Tichelaar J.W. Whitsett J.A. Transgenic Res. 2002; 11: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Tissues were homogenized in Trizol (Invitrogen), and RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's specifications. RNA was treated with DNase before cDNA synthesis. Five μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed and then analyzed by PCR for murine FGF-18 and the transgene-specific FGF-18 and β-actin mRNAs. Transgene-specific primers for mouse FGF-18 were designed to the (teto)7CMV-FGF-18 transcript and used for amplification. Primer A was located in the CMV minimal promoter (5′ to 3′) AGACGCCATCCACGCTGTTTTG; primer B was located within the FGF-18 cDNA (5′ to 3′) CAGGACTTGAATGTGCTTCCCACTG. FGF-18 mRNA was compared with that amplified for β-actin. FGF-18 mRNAs were also estimated using primers designed to amplify within the FGF-18 coding sequence using standard gel analysis of PCR products. FGF-18, FGF-10, sonic hedgehog, BMP-4, and Sprouty-2 mRNAs were also determined by real-time PCR of lung cDNA, after optimization of primers and conditions. Dams were placed on doxycycline throughout pregnancy and sacrificed on embryonic day (E) 15, and RNA was extracted from the lungs of each pup. cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription and analyzed on the Smart Cycler® using primers to identify β-actin, FGF-18, BMP-4, Sprouty-2, and FGF-10. All results were normalized to β-actin. To obtain fetal lung tissue, the fetuses were removed by hysterotomy after lethal injection of pentobarbital to the dam. The chest of fetal animals was opened, and the tissue was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. Lungs from postnatal animals were inflation-fixed at 25 cm water pressure via a tracheal cannula with the same fixative. Tissue was fixed overnight, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, dehydrated through a series of alcohols, and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections were stained for SP-B, pro-SP-B, TTF-1, pro-SP-C, Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP), peripheral endothelial cell adhesion molecules (PECAMs), α-smooth muscle actin, Foxj1, and pro-collagen II using methods described previously (27Clark J.C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11858-11864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Cartilage was stained with Alcian blue, and residual tissue was dissolved in KOH before photography. For electron microscopy, tissue was fixed, prepared, and evaluated as described previously (27Clark J.C. Tichelaar J.W. Wert S.E. Itoh N. Perl A.-K.T. Stahlman M.T. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L705-L715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of mouse FGF-18 mRNA was assessed by in situ hybridization using35S-labeled riboprobes as described previously for fetal and adult lungs (27Clark J.C. Tichelaar J.W. Wert S.E. Itoh N. Perl A.-K.T. Stahlman M.T. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L705-L715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the latter were assessed after inflation fixation at 25 cm of water pressure. Sense and antisense FGF-18 RNA probes were generated in PGEM32. Tissue was hybridized overnight at 50 °C. Slides were coated with Kodak NTB2 emulsion, exposed for 7–14 days, and developed with Kodak D19. Whole mount in situhybridization for mouse FGF-18, FGF-10, sonic hedgehog, BMP-4, and Sprouty-2 was performed by digoxigenin-labeled cDNA antisense and sense probes. Whole mount in situ hybridization was carried out on the lungs of fetal day 12 embryos, whose dams had been on doxycycline throughout pregnancy. Antisense and sense probes were made from transcription vectors, using digoxigenin-UTP as label. After hybridization and washing, anti-digoxigenin antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase was adsorbed. The product was developed using BM purple alkaline phosphatase substrate. In the absence of doxycycline, double transgenic SP-C-rtTA and (teto)7CMV-FGF-18 mice (heterozygous for each transgene) were viable. Fetal and postnatal single transgenic mice were produced in ratios predicted by Mendelian inheritance. Lung morphology was normal in both single transgenic mice and double transgenic mice in the absence of doxycycline. Previous in situ hybridization and reporter gene analyses of the lungs from SP-C-CAT and SP-C-rtTA mice demonstrated that transgenic mRNA was selectively expressed in peripheral respiratory epithelial cells in the lungs of fetal and adult mice. Expression of firefly luciferase with the SP-C-rtTA system was observed as early as E10 in vivo (33Perl A.-K.T. Tichelaar J.W. Whitsett J.A. Transgenic Res. 2002; 11: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In adult SP-C-rtTA mice, rtTA mRNA was selectively expressed in peripheral conducting airways and type II epithelial cells (28Tichelaar J.W., Lu, W. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11858-11864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 33Perl A.-K.T. Tichelaar J.W. Whitsett J.A. Transgenic Res. 2002; 11: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Two independent lines of (teto)7CMV-FGF-18 target mice (lines A and B) were generated and mated to SP-C-rtTA mice. A similar morphologic phenotype was observed in the lungs of the independent (teto)7CMV-FGF-18 lines after exposure to doxycycline. Subsequent studies utilized (teto)7CMV-FGF-18 line A. Transgene-specific FGF-18 mRNA was assessed by reverse transcription-PCR in the lungs of young adult mice with and without the addition of 0.5 mg/ml doxycycline in the drinking water. In adult double transgenic SP-C-rtTA × (teto)7CMV-FGF-18 mice, FGF-18 mRNA was detectable at low levels in the absence of doxycycline, representing some “leak” in the absence of doxycycline, but was induced after oral doxycycline as described previously with the SP-C-rtTA mice (27Clark J.C. Tichelaar J.W. Wert S.E. Itoh N. Perl A.-K.T. Stahlman M.T. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L705-L715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tichelaar J.W., Lu, W. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11858-11864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Exposure of adult double transgenic mice to doxycycline did not alter lung morphology (data not shown). In pups obtained from dams treated with doxycycline, FGF-18 mRNA was detected in fetal SP-C-rtTA × (teto)7CMV-FGF-18 double transgenic mice but was not readily detected in single transgenic animals (Fig.2). Transgenic FGF-18 mRNA was not detected in other major organs of double transgenic mice, including liver, spleen, kidney, and brain, typical of the specificity of the SP-C promoter element (31Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Wert S.E. Bruno M.D. McWilliams K.M. Vorbroker D.K. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L349-L356PubMed Google Scholar), which is generally active only in respiratory epithelial cells in the lung (data not shown). Exogenous FGF-18 mRNA was detected in the testes of a double transgenic mouse on doxycycline, albeit at extremely low levels compared with that seen in the lung. When dams were exposed to doxycycline on E6 and maintained on doxycycline during pregnancy, the percentage survival of the offspring decreased to 50% of the expected Mendelian numbers in double transgenic mice, consistent with the lethality of the transgene. The structure of lungs from double transgenic SP-C-rtTA × (teto)7CMV-FGF-18 offspring was assessed at E16−E19 (Fig. 3). Without doxycycline, lung histology of double transgenic mice was generally indistinguishable from normal. In the presence of doxycycline, dramatic histological abnormalities were observed in the lungs from double transgenic mice on E16−E19. Branching morphogenesis was disrupted. A marked increase in the length and caliber of conducting airways was observed. Decreased branching of peripheral airways with a marked reduction in peripheral saccules was consistently noted. The abnormal histology was not observed on E12.5 but was readily apparent at E16 and thereafter. Abnormally large airways and cysts were readily apparent in the FGF-18-expressing mice by direct visualization of the lung periphery (Fig. 4).Figure 4Photomicrograph of the edge of fetal lung from FGF-18 and control littermates. Lungs were dissected on E17 from double transgenic and control pups after exposure to doxycycline from E6 and photographed under a dissecting microscope. Abnormal airways and marked dilation of peripheral lung saccules were observed in FGF-18-expressing mice. Arrows indicate dilated saccules.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Later in gestation, on E18 and E19, stage-specific sacculation of peripheral acinar buds and alveoli were lacking in the FGF-18-expressing mice (Fig. 3). Elongated conducting airways of disordered caliber extended to the lung periphery. Atypical branching of bronchioles and distal bronchiolar-acinar tubules was observed, and normal acinar ducts and alveoli were markedly decreased or absent. The lung mesenchyme was thickened, containing few acinar tubules. Pulmonary blood vessels were prominent, with abnormally large lumens, and alveolar capillaries were lacking. The residual peripheral airway saccules were not dilated, and the normal alveolar structures of the newborn lung were lacking. Large, abnormal bronchial-like tubules were observed throughout the lungs, and many extended to the pleural surfaces. Whereas similar abnormalities were observed in FGF-18-expressing fetal mice, variability in the extent of the histological abnormalities was observed even in double transgenic mice from the same litter, suggesting that the timing, extent, or levels of transgene expression may influence the severity of the phenotype. Similar lung abnormalities were observed from litters capable of producing offspring with one copy or two copies of the CMV-FGF-18 transgene and in both A and B (teto)7FGF-18 lines. The peripheral conducting tubules in FGF-18-expressing mice at E16−E19 were lined by a relatively homogenous population of columnar and cuboidal epithelial cell cilia. These abnormal airway epithelial cells stained intensely and homogeneously for TTF-1, reflecting a lack of terminal differentiation and failure to form squamous cells (type I) in the periphery at E16−E19 and in newborns (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Pro-SP-C and SP-B were detected at relatively low levels throughout the abnormal epithelium, consistent with the lack of both type II and squamous type I cell differentiation at E16 and E19. Atypical staining of surfactant proteins was observed in both basal and apical regions of the cells, whereas staining was detected in the apical regions of type II cells in the normal lung. Abnormal clumps of cells staining for CCSP were observed in the elongated dilated respiratory bronchioles. However, CCSP was excluded from the most peripheral regions of lung tubules at E16 and E19 (Fig. 5 and data not shown), as it is in the alveolar regions of the normal lung. The atypical cells lining lung tubules did not express Foxj1, a marker of ciliated cells in normal conducting airways (data not shown). Pulmonary vascular development was perturbed as indicated by the abnormalities of PECAM staining in the pulmonary mesenchyme of the FGF-18-expressing mice (Fig.6). Extensive blood vessel development was noted in the abnormal mesenchyme surrounding the sparse, relatively small acinar tubules. Atypical pulmonary blood vessels in the periphery often had a markedly enlarged lumenal diameter (Fig. 6). α-Smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) staining, which is normally abundant in proximal conducting airways and excluded from the alveolar region, was observed surrounding the aberrant airways in the lung periphery and detected at sites that normally lack α-SMA staining in control littermates (Fig.6). Ultrastructural analysis of lung tissue from FGF-18-expressing mice at E16 and E18 (the latter is not shown) was consistent with observations at the light microscopic level. Abnormally large peripheral airways were lined by an atypical columnar epithelium. A relatively homogenous population of immature epithelial cells was observed in the peripheral tubules. Most of the terminal airspaces were lined by cuboidal or columnar cells, and few squamous (type I) cells were observed. Epithelial cells were rich in glycogen, often lacked microvilli, and contained few lipid inclusions (Fig.7). Tubular myelin was not observed in the airways. Some of the atypical cells contained basal bodies, which are typical of developing tracheal-bronchial ciliated cells. In lungs from control littermates, developing pre-type II cells were cuboidal and contained putative lamellar bodies. Tubular myelin was observed occasionally. At E18, squamous type I cells lined the most peripheral saccules in control pups. In FGF-18-expressing mice, the abnormal lung mesenchyme was poorly organized and contained abnormal blood vessels surrounded by pr"

Both increase the affinity for ATP due to a shift in the enzyme's E1 ↔ E2 conformational equilibrium toward E1. In addition, both increase K+ antagonism of cytoplasmic Na+ activation. To gain insight into the structural basis for these distinct effects, extramembranous N-terminal and C-terminal mutants of γ were expressed in rat α1-transfected HeLa cells. At the N terminus, the variant-distinct region was deleted (γNΔ7) or replaced by alanine residues (γN7A). At the C terminus, four (γaCΔ4) or ten (γaCΔ10) residues were deleted. None of these mutations abrogates the K+/Na+ antagonism as evidenced in a similar increase in K′Na seen at high (100 mm) K+ concentration. In contrast, the C-terminal as well as N-terminal deletions (γNΔ7, γaCΔ4, and γaCΔ10) abolished the decrease in K′ATP seen with wild-type γa or γb. It is concluded that different regions of the γ chain mediate the distinct functional effects of γ, and the effects can be long-range. In the transmembrane region, the impact of G41R replacement was analyzed since this mutation is associated with autosomal dominant renal Mg2+-wasting in man (Meij, I. C., Koenderink, J. B., van Bokhoven, H., Assink, K. F. H., Groenestege, W. T., de Pont, J. J. H. H. M., Bindels, R. J. M., Monnens, L. A. H., Van den Heuvel, L. P. W. J., and Knoers, N. V. A. M. (2000) Nat. Genet. 26, 265–266). The results show that Gly-41 → Arg prevents trafficking of γ but not αβ pumps to the cell surface and abrogates functional effects of γ on αβ pumps. These findings underscore a potentially important role of γ in affecting solute transport, in this instance Mg2+ reabsorption, consequent to its primary effect on the sodium pump.

These findings underscore a potentially important role of γ in affecting solute transport, in this instance Mg2+ reabsorption, consequent to its primary effect on the sodium pump. The Na,K-ATPase, or sodium pump, maintains the high Na+ and K+ gradients across the plasma membrane of animal cells. Accordingly, this pump plays a major role in determining the cytoplasmic Na+ concentration and hence the cytoplasmic concentration of protons and Ca2+, as well as other solutes whose accumulation is driven by secondary countertransport systems. The kinetic properties of the sodium pump are, in turn, subject to complex mechanisms of short- and long-term regulation. While the nature of the catalytic α subunit isoform may be a primary determinant of tissue-specific behavior of the pump, there are also diverse mechanisms underlying pump regulation.

Bioenerg. Biomemb. 2001; 33: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). One function of γ is to increase cytoplasmic K+antagonism of Na+ activation, which is apparent as an increase in K′Na, particularly at elevated K+ concentrations. The other function is a γ-mediated increase in the apparent affinity for ATP, concordant with our earlier finding that antibodies raised against the C terminus of γ decreased the affinity for ATP (5Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. R. B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32628-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We ascribed the latter decrease in K′ATP to a γ-mediated shift in the poise of the steady-state E1 ↔ E2 equilibrium toward E1. Consistent with this finding is the behavior of both γ subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes (13Beguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, in the presence but not absence of Na+, both subunits alter the apparent affinity for extracellular K+ in a membrane potential-dependent manner, indicative of a γ-mediated shift in conformational equilibrium toward E1. Although no notable difference between γa and γbfunction could be detected (12Pu H.X. Cluzeaud F. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Farman N. Blostein R. J. Biol.

To this end, we examined the consequences of altering both N- and C-terminal extramembranous regions of γ by deletion and alanine replacement of the variant-specific N terminus and deletion of up to ten residues from the C terminus. The other aim was to analyze the functional basis for the transmembrane Gly-41 → Arg mutation associated with familial magnesium-wasting in man (24Meij I.C. Koenderink J.B. van Bokhoven H. Assink K.F.H. Groenestege W.T. de Pont J.J.H.H. M. Bindels R.J.M. Monnens L.A.H. Van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. Knoers N.V.A.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 265-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This analysis underscores an important role of γ in affecting secondary transport as a result of primary effects on Na,K-ATPase function.DISCUSSIONThe γ subunit of the sodium pump is a member of the FXYD family of small single-span transmembrane proteins. There are at least seven members of this gene family in mammals (3Sweadner K. Rael E. Genomics. 2001; 68: 41-56Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In the kidney, two members, CHIF and γ, are regulators of the pump with opposite effects on apparent affinity for Na+ (13Beguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 30Garty, H., Lindzen, M., Scanzano, R., Aizen, R., Füzesi, M., Carradus, M., Goldshleger, R., Farman, N., Blostein, R., and Karlish, S. J. D. (2002) Amer. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Immunolocalization studies indicate that their expression along the nephron is mutually exclusive. For example, CHIF is present exclusively in cortical and medullary collecting ducts and γ primarily in the medullary thick ascending limb (14Garty H. Cluzeaud F. Farman N. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 501AGoogle Scholar). The two major γ variants have similar, if not identical, functional effects on the sodium pump complex. On the other hand, there are differences in their localization along the nephron. Although both co-localize to certain segments of the nephron and are abundant in the medullary thick ascending limb where rates of Na+ reabsorption are particularly high, they also exhibit distinct segment localizations. Thus, Pu et al. (12Pu H.X. Cluzeaud F. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Farman N. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20370-20378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) found that γb but not γa was visualized in cortical thick ascending limb, whereas γa is present in the region of the macular densa in which γb is absent. More recent studies by Wetzel and Sweadner (23Wetzel R.K. Sweadner K.J. Amer. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2001; 281: F531-F545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that γb is present in the distal convoluted tubule and connecting tubule; γa, if present, is less abundant.The functional effects of γ described earlier include the following: (i) an increase in apparent affinity for ATP reflecting a shift in the steady-state E1/E2 distribution toward the E1 conformation and (ii) an increase in K+/Na+ competition at cytoplasmic Na+ activation sites. Considering these effects in terms of the Albers-Post reaction mechanism, in particular E2(K+) ↔ E1 + K+ and E1 + ATP + Na+ ↔ Na·E1P + ADP, it is intriguing that the two effects of γ are paradoxically opposing. A higher affinity for K+ at cytoplasmic Na+ activation sites should shift the E1/E2 poise away from E1 and, conversely, a higher affinity for ATP should shift the poise away from E2, toward E1. The implications of these dichotomies are considered below.From our earlier observation that anti-γC treatment of the renal enzyme abrogated the effect of γ on K′ATP but had no effect on K+/Na+ antagonism, we suggested that the two effects of γ are relevant to different regions of the γ chain. The present mutagenesis study provides definitive evidence in support of this theory. Thus, deletion of ten and as few as four residues from the C terminus, as well as deletion of the variant-specific N terminus, completely abrogates the γ-mediated decrease in K′ATP seen with both WT variants but not the increase in K+/Na+ antagonism. An intriguing possibility is that there is interplay between the two opposing modifying effects of γ whereby the γ-mediated increase in K′ATP affinity may counteract and hence minimize the true K+/Na+ antagonism and vice versa. This may come about if γ effects on Na,K-ATPase behavior are, in turn, modulated by cell-specific interactions of α/β/γ complexes with other cell elements such as those of the cytoskeleton.The observation that none of the extramembranous mutants abrogated both effects of γ indicates that all of these mutant γ subunits associate with Na,K-ATPase α/β dimers. This finding is consistent with the recent report of Beguin et al. (13Beguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), which showed that the FXYD motif that is present in these mutants is critical for stable association.The finding that deletion of the N terminus, like removal of the C terminus (or addition of anti-γC-terminal antibodies), abrogates the effect of γ on the E1 ↔ E2 conformational equilibrium points to long-range effects of γ/αβ interactions on K′ATP. Because the N-terminal deletion but not N7A replacement abrogates the K′ATP effect, the γ effect to stabilize E1 does not involve TELSANH or MDRWYL interactions with αβ but rather the remainder of the γ chain.A physiological basis for the dual effects of γ is that it provides a fine-tuned, self-regulatory mechanism for balancing energy utilization and maintaining appropriate salt gradients across renal epithelial cells. Both γ variants are particularly abundant in the medullary thick ascending limb. As reasoned elsewhere (22Therien A.G. Pu H.X. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 2001; 33: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it is in the anoxic regions of the medulla that the increased affinity for ATP effected by γ would serve to maintain pump activity, and the moderate decrease in Na+ affinity would serve to balance ATP depletion and maintain an appropriately low intracellular Na+concentration. Accordingly, its dual effect enables γ to imbue the pump with the ability to handle ATP under energy-compromised conditions and yet be self-regulated by having an appropriately modest increase in the Na+ concentration set point. Recent studies by Garty et al. (14Garty H. Cluzeaud F. Farman N. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 501AGoogle Scholar) have shown that in certain regions with little if any γ in which the apparent affinity for Na+ is higher (29Barlet-Bas C. Cheval L. Marsy S. Khadouri C. Doucet A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 1990; 259: F246-F250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in particular cortical and medullary collecting ducts, the renal pump is associated with CHIF. CHIF has the opposite effect of γ on K′Na (13Beguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar); it increases the apparent affinity for Na+ at least 2-fold, which these authors suggest may be critical for aldosterone-responsive tissues, which have an important role in maintaining Na+ and K+ homeostasis. It is not known yet whether, in mirror image to the γ effect, the increase in apparent Na+ affinity effected by CHIF reflects a decrease in the apparent affinity for K+ acting as a competitive inhibitor of cytoplasmic Na+ activation.An important role of γ in renal cation homeostasis secondary to its association with, and modulation of, Na,K-ATPase is demonstrated by our results showing the functional consequences of mutating Gly-41 to Arg. This study provides evidence that the G41R substitution alters γ interaction with the αβ pump, resulting in the failure of γ both to traffic to the cell surface and to modulate pump kinetics. The former finding confirms the γ routing defect reported by Meij et al. (24Meij I.C. Koenderink J.B. van Bokhoven H. Assink K.F.H. Groenestege W.T. de Pont J.J.H.H. M. Bindels R.J.M. Monnens L.A.H. Van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. Knoers N.V.A.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 265-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In addition, our experiments indicate that αβ pump trafficking per se is not notably affected.The significance of the association of renal Mg2+-wasting with abrogation of γ modulation of Na,K-ATPase is uncertain. It is evident that the consequences of changes in Na+, K+, and Cl− transport along the different regions of the nephron are varied and complex. Reduced apparent ATP affinity of αβ pumps by abrogation of their modulation by γ may decrease pump activity and lead to secondary changes (reduction) in Mg2+ reabsorption. Accordingly, renal Mg2+-wasting seen in the dominant hypomagnesemia described by Meij et al. (24Meij I.C. Koenderink J.B. van Bokhoven H. Assink K.F.H. Groenestege W.T. de Pont J.J.H.H. M. Bindels R.J.M. Monnens L.A.H. Van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. Knoers N.V.A.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 265-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) appears to be secondary to the loss of γ modulation of Na,K-ATPase function. The primary cellular mechanism remains to be determined. Also unexplained is the increase in renal calcium absorption and hypocalciuria that is consistently observed in these patients (24Meij I.C. Koenderink J.B. van Bokhoven H. Assink K.F.H. Groenestege W.T. de Pont J.J.H.H. M. Bindels R.J.M. Monnens L.A.H. Van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. Knoers N.V.A.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 265-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).The experiments described in this study were carried out with cultured apolar cells. The extent to which γ trafficking and abrogation of the γ effects by G41R replacement are different in polar cells remains to be addressed. Current efforts are underway to address this aspect of γ function in polarized renal epithelial cells. The Na,K-ATPase, or sodium pump, maintains the high Na+ and K+ gradients across the plasma membrane of animal cells. Accordingly, this pump plays a major role in determining the cytoplasmic Na+ concentration and hence the cytoplasmic concentration of protons and Ca2+, as well as other solutes whose accumulation is driven by secondary countertransport systems. The kinetic properties of the sodium pump are, in turn, subject to complex mechanisms of short- and long-term regulation. While the nature of the catalytic α subunit isoform may be a primary determinant of tissue-specific behavior of the pump, there are also diverse mechanisms underlying pump regulation.

There is an increasing body of evidence that a family of small, single transmembrane proteins characterized by the motif FXYD are expressed in a tissue-specific manner.

Thus, Pu et al. (12Pu H.X. Cluzeaud F. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Farman N. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20370-20378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) found that γb but not γa was visualized in cortical thick ascending limb, whereas γa is present in the region of the macular densa in which γb is absent. More recent studies by Wetzel and Sweadner (23Wetzel R.K. Sweadner K.J. Amer. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2001; 281: F531-F545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that γb is present in the distal convoluted tubule and connecting tubule; γa, if present, is less abundant.The functional effects of γ described earlier include the following: (i) an increase in apparent affinity for ATP reflecting a shift in the steady-state E1/E2 distribution toward the E1 conformation and (ii) an increase in K+/Na+ competition at cytoplasmic Na+ activation sites. Considering these effects in terms of the Albers-Post reaction mechanism, in particular E2(K+) ↔ E1 + K+ and E1 + ATP + Na+ ↔ Na·E1P + ADP, it is intriguing that the two effects of γ are paradoxically opposing. A higher affinity for K+ at cytoplasmic Na+ activation sites should shift the E1/E2 poise away from E1 and, conversely, a higher affinity for ATP should shift the poise away from E2, toward E1. The implications of these dichotomies are considered below.From our earlier observation that anti-γC treatment of the renal enzyme abrogated the effect of γ on K′ATP but had no effect on K+/Na+ antagonism, we suggested that the two effects of γ are relevant to different regions of the γ chain. The present mutagenesis study provides definitive evidence in support of this theory. Thus, deletion of ten and as few as four residues from the C terminus, as well as deletion of the variant-specific N terminus, completely abrogates the γ-mediated decrease in K′ATP seen with both WT variants but not the increase in K+/Na+ antagonism. An intriguing possibility is that there is interplay between the two opposing modifying effects of γ whereby the γ-mediated increase in K′ATP affinity may counteract and hence minimize the true K+/Na+ antagonism and vice versa. This may come about if γ effects on Na,K-ATPase behavior are, in turn, modulated by cell-specific interactions of α/β/γ complexes with other cell elements such as those of the cytoskeleton.The observation that none of the extramembranous mutants abrogated both effects of γ indicates that all of these mutant γ subunits associate with Na,K-ATPase α/β dimers. This finding is consistent with the recent report of Beguin et al. (13Beguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), which showed that the FXYD motif that is present in these mutants is critical for stable association.The finding that deletion of the N terminus, like removal of the C terminus (or addition of anti-γC-terminal antibodies), abrogates the effect of γ on the E1 ↔ E2 conformational equilibrium points to long-range effects of γ/αβ interactions on K′ATP. Because the N-terminal deletion but not N7A replacement abrogates the K′ATP effect, the γ effect to stabilize E1 does not involve TELSANH or MDRWYL interactions with αβ but rather the remainder of the γ chain.A physiological basis for the dual effects of γ is that it provides a fine-tuned, self-regulatory mechanism for balancing energy utilization and maintaining appropriate salt gradients across renal epithelial cells. Both γ variants are particularly abundant in the medullary thick ascending limb. As reasoned elsewhere (22Therien A.G. Pu H.X. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 2001; 33: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it is in the anoxic regions of the medulla that the increased affinity for ATP effected by γ would serve to maintain pump activity, and the moderate decrease in Na+ affinity would serve to balance ATP depletion and maintain an appropriately low intracellular Na+concentration. Accordingly, its dual effect enables γ to imbue the pump with the ability to handle ATP under energy-compromised conditions and yet be self-regulated by having an appropriately modest increase in the Na+ concentration set point. Recent studies by Garty et al. (14Garty H. Cluzeaud F. Farman N. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 501AGoogle Scholar) have shown that in certain regions with little if any γ in which the apparent affinity for Na+ is higher (29Barlet-Bas C. Cheval L. Marsy S. Khadouri C. Doucet A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 1990; 259: F246-F250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in particular cortical and medullary collecting ducts, the renal pump is associated with CHIF. CHIF has the opposite effect of γ on K′Na (13Beguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar); it increases the apparent affinity for Na+ at least 2-fold, which these authors suggest may be critical for aldosterone-responsive tissues, which have an important role in maintaining Na+ and K+ homeostasis. It is not known yet whether, in mirror image to the γ effect, the increase in apparent Na+ affinity effected by CHIF reflects a decrease in the apparent affinity for K+ acting as a competitive inhibitor of cytoplasmic Na+ activation.An important role of γ in renal cation homeostasis secondary to its association with, and modulation of, Na,K-ATPase is demonstrated by our results showing the functional consequences of mutating Gly-41 to Arg. This study provides evidence that the G41R substitution alters γ interaction with the αβ pump, resulting in the failure of γ both to traffic to the cell surface and to modulate pump kinetics. The former finding confirms the γ routing defect reported by Meij et al. (24Meij I.C. Koenderink J.B. van Bokhoven H. Assink K.F.H. Groenestege W.T. de Pont J.J.H.H. M. Bindels R.J.M. Monnens L.A.H. Van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. Knoers N.V.A.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 265-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In addition, our experiments indicate that αβ pump trafficking per se is not notably affected.The significance of the association of renal Mg2+-wasting with abrogation of γ modulation of Na,K-ATPase is uncertain. It is evident that the consequences of changes in Na+, K+, and Cl− transport along the different regions of the nephron are varied and complex. Reduced apparent ATP affinity of αβ pumps by abrogation of their modulation by γ may decrease pump activity and lead to secondary changes (reduction) in Mg2+ reabsorption. Accordingly, renal Mg2+-wasting seen in the dominant hypomagnesemia described by Meij et al. (24Meij I.C. Koenderink J.B. van Bokhoven H. Assink K.F.H. Groenestege W.T. de Pont J.J.H.H. M. Bindels R.J.M. Monnens L.A.H. Van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. Knoers N.V.A.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 265-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) appears to be secondary to the loss of γ modulation of Na,K-ATPase function. The primary cellular mechanism remains to be determined. Also unexplained is the increase in renal calcium absorption and hypocalciuria that is consistently observed in these patients (24Meij I.C. Koenderink J.B. van Bokhoven H. Assink K.F.H. Groenestege W.T. de Pont J.J.H.H. M. Bindels R.J.M. Monnens L.A.H. Van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. Knoers N.V.A.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 265-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).The experiments described in this study were carried out with cultured apolar cells. The extent to which γ trafficking and abrogation of the γ effects by G41R replacement are different in polar cells remains to be addressed. Current efforts are underway to address this aspect of γ function in polarized renal epithelial cells. The γ subunit of the sodium pump is a member of the FXYD family of small single-span transmembrane proteins. There are at least seven members of this gene family in mammals (3Sweadner K. Rael E. Genomics. 2001; 68: 41-56Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In the kidney, two members, CHIF and γ, are regulators of the pump with opposite effects on apparent affinity for Na+ (13Beguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 30Garty, H., Lindzen, M., Scanzano, R., Aizen, R., Füzesi, M., Carradus, M., Goldshleger, R., Farman, N., Blostein, R., and Karlish, S. J. D. (2002) Amer. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Immunolocalization studies indicate that their expression along the nephron is mutually exclusive. For example, CHIF is present exclusively in cortical and medullary collecting ducts and γ primarily in the medullary thick ascending limb (14Garty H. Cluzeaud F. Farman N. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 501AGoogle Scholar). The two major γ variants have similar, if not identical, functional effects on the sodium pump complex.

Although both co-localize to certain segments of the nephron and are abundant in the medullary thick ascending limb where rates of Na+ reabsorption are particularly high, they also exhibit distinct segment localizations.

On the bases of crystal structures of the wild type enzyme and the D244E mutated enzyme complexed with 3′-keto-adenosine (D244E·Ado*), we have identified the important amino acid residues, Asp-130, Lys-185, Asp-189, and Asn-190, for the catalytic reaction and have proposed a catalytic mechanism (Komoto, J., Huang, Y., Gomi, T., Ogawa, H., Takata, Y., Fujioka, M., and Takusagawa, F. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 32147–32156). To confirm the proposed catalytic mechanism, we have made the D130N, K185N, D189N, and N190S mutated enzymes and measured the catalytic activities. The catalytic rates (k cat) of D130N, K185N, D189N, and N190S mutated enzymes are reduced to 0.7%, 0.5%, 0.1%, and 0.5%, respectively, in comparison with the wild type enzyme, indicating that Asp-130, Lys-185, Asp-189, and Asn-190 are involved in the catalytic reaction. K m values of the mutated enzymes are increased significantly, except for the N190S mutation, suggesting that Asp-130, Lys-185, and Asp-189 participate in the substrate binding. To interpret the kinetic data, the oxidation states of the bound NAD molecules of the wild type and mutated enzymes were measured during the catalytic reaction by monitoring the absorbance at 340 nm. The crystal structures of the WT and D244E·Ado*, containing four subunits in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, were re-refined to have the same subunit structures. A detailed catalytic mechanism of AdoHcyase has been revealed based on the oxidation states of the bound NAD and the re-refined crystal structures of WT and D244E·Ado*. Lys-185 and Asp-130 abstract hydrogen atoms from 3′-OH and 4′-CH, respectively. Asp-189 removes a proton from Lys-185 and produces the neutral Nζ (–NH2), and Asn-190 facilitates formation of the neutral Lys-185.

Scarano E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 4744Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The AdoHcyases from all sources are oligomeric proteins with subunits ofM r 45,000–50,000. Each subunit contains 1 mol of tightly bound NAD+ (2Palmer J.L. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Fujioka M. Takata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1631-1635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction is reversible, and the equilibrium lies far in the direction of AdoHcy synthesis. Under physiological conditions, however, the removal of both Ado and Hcy is sufficiently rapid that the net reaction proceeds in the direction of hydrolysis (4Richards H.H. Chiang P.K. Cantoni G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4476-4480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ado is removed by Ado deaminase and Ado kinase, and Hcy is used for the synthesis of cysteine and the regeneration of methionine. In mammals, Hcy is produced solely from AdoHcy, and it was reported that an elevated plasma Hcy level is one of the risk factors for coronary heart disease (5Nygard O. Nordrehaug J.E. Refsum H. Ueland P.M. Farstad M. Vollset S.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). The mechanism of reversible hydrolysis of AdoHcy catalyzed by AdoHcyase has been studied by Palmer and Abeles (2Palmer J.L. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Palmer J.L. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5817-5819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that AdoHcy and Ado are first oxidized to 3′-keto derivatives by the enzyme-bound NAD+. This facilitates abstraction of the 4′-proton by an enzyme base, and the resulting carbanion eliminates the 5′-substituent, Hcy or water, to yield 3′-keto-4′,5′-dehydroadenosine. Michael-type addition of water or Hcy to this central intermediate and reduction of the 3′-keto by NADH form the final product, Ado or AdoHcy. The catalytic mechanism described above is illustrated below. On the basis of crystal structures of the WT and the D244E·Ado* determined in our laboratory (7Hu Y. Komoto J. Huang Y. Gomi T. Ogawa H.

Takusagawa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32147-32156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Lys-185 and Asp-130 abstract hydrogen atoms from 3′-OH and 4′-CH, respectively. Asp-189 removes a proton from Lys-185 and produces the neutral Nζ (–NH2), and Asn-190 increases the basicity of Lys-185. Replacement of these amino acid residues with other amino acid residues is expected to substantially reduce the catalytic activities of the mutated enzymes. To confirm the catalytic mechanism, we have carried out D130N, K185N, D189N, and N190S site-directed mutagenesis and measured the catalytic activities of the mutated enzymes. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to prepare cDNAs encoding mutated forms of AdoHcyase. Mutagenic oligonucleotides (listed in TableI) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Mutagenesis was performed by the method of Kunkel et al. (9Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar), with a Mutan-K site-directed mutagenesis kit (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan). A clone containing the desired mutation was identified by nucleotide sequence analysis across the mutation site by the dideoxy chain termination method (10Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc.

The mutated forms of AdoHcyase were produced in Escherichia coli JM109 cells transformed with a pUC118 plasmid containing the respective mutated sequences. The cells were grown in LB medium containing 50 mg/liter ampicillin at 37 °C. When the A 600reached 0.3, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm and culturing was continued for an additional 12 h to induce the enzymes. All mutated enzymes were purified from the soluble fractions of E. coli extracts and were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by a procedure similar to that used for the purification of the WT (11Gomi T.

Removal of the enzyme-bound NAD+ and other compounds from the WT and the mutated enzymes was achieved by acid ammonium sulfate treatment as described for the preparation of rat liver apo-AdoHcyase (12Gomi T.

The apoenzymes were reconstituted by incubation with NAD+, and the reconstituted enzymes (holoenzymes) were used for the following experiments. CD spectra of the WT and mutated enzymes at a concentration of 0.14 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, were measured using a JASCO 710 spectrophotometer. The spectra were recorded from 250 to 190 nm at 25 °C. The AdoHcy hydrolysis activities of the WT and mutated enzymes were determined in the presence of excess Ado deaminase, by spectrophotometrically measuring the rate of appearance of inosine. A 50-μl aliquot of the protein solution (∼20 mg/ml concentration) was added to 950 μl of the assay mixture containing 10 μm AdoHcy, and 1.4 units of calf intestine Ado deaminase (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) in 50 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.2), and the decrease of absorbance at 265 nm due to the conversion of the product Ado to inosine was followed continuously at 25 °C (2Palmer J.L. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same experiment was repeated five times with different AdoHcy concentrations (10–75 μm). The product concentrations were calculated from the slope of ΔA and Δε = 8.1 × 103m−1·cm−1. The exact protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. TheV max and K m values were determined by Lineweaver-Burk plots. NADH accumulation in the mutated AdoHcyase was measured by monitoring the absorbance at 340 nm. A 100-μl aliquot of the protein solution (20 mg/ml concentration) was added to 900 μl of the assay mixture containing 60 μmAdoHcy and 1.4 units of calf intestine Ado deaminase in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2), and the increase of absorbance at 340 nm due to the accumulation of NADH was followed at 35 °C for 1 h. The crystal structures of WT and D244E·Ado* contain a tetrameric enzyme (i.e. four subunits) in the crystallographic asymmetric units. The active site geometry of each subunit is slightly different from the others. Although the surface section of each subunit might be slightly different from the others due to the crystal packing, the core section, including the active site of each subunit, is assumed to be the same. Therefore, the crystal structures of both enzymes were re-refined with a tight non-crystallographic restraint, to have the same active site geometry in each subunit. The structures were refined using 2.8-Å resolution data by the program X-PLOR (13Brünger A.T. X-PLOR 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven and London1993Google Scholar). The new coordinates have been deposited to the Protein Data Bank (code numbers 1KY4 and 1KY5). All mutated proteins expressed well, and about 20 mg of pure proteins were obtained from 1 liter of culture. SDS-PAGE analyses showed that the subunits of the mutated proteins have the same molecular weight as that of the WT. The retention times in gel filtrations indicated that all mutated proteins are the same size as the WT, i.e. they are tetramers with molecular weight 190,000. The CD spectra of the mutated enzymes are identical to that of the WT, indicating that the site-directed mutagenesis did not alter the secondary structures. On the basis of the results described above, we assume that the site-directed mutagenesis did not change the tertiary and quaternary structure of AdoHcyase. Fig. 1 shows time scans of the absorbance at 265 nm during the production of inosine from AdoHcy. The time scan of the WT shows a significant hyperbolic attenuation of the UV absorption, indicating that AdoHcy is rapidly hydrolyzed to Ado and Hcy. On the other hand, the time scans of the mutated enzymes show relatively small linear attenuation of the UV absorption, indicating that the site-directed mutagenesis inactivates the mutated enzymes. Comprehensive kinetic data of AdoHcy hydrolysis are given in TableII. The catalytic rates (k cat) of D130N, K185N, D189N, and N190S are reduced to 0.7, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.5%, respectively, in comparison with the WT. The K m values of the mutated enzymes are increased significantly, except for the N190S mutation.Table IIHydrolysis kinetic parameters of WT and mutated enzymesMutant K M k cat k cat/K M μm min −1 μm −1 ·min −1WT10.35.47 × 10−25.31 × 10−3D130N303.3.95 × 10−41.30 × 10−6K185N35.12.60 × 10−47.41 × 10−6D189N57.85.47 × 10−59.46 × 10−7N190S19.12.86 × 10−41.50 × 10−5 Open table in a new tab Because NADH, but not NAD+, has a characteristic absorption band around 340 nm, measuring the absorbance at 340 nm can monitor the oxidation state of the bound NAD. Fig. 2 shows that D189N, N190S, and D130N exhibit significant NADH accumulations during catalysis. On the other hand, the accumulations of NADH in the K185N and the WT are negligible. Both WT and D244E·Ado* structures were successfully refined to have the same subunit structures. For the WT structure, the r.m.s.d. among the four subunits is less than 0.066 Å and that for the D244E·Ado* structure is 0.093 Å. The four subunits in each structure have the same active site geometry. Amino acid residues of 92.4% of the WT and 91.1% of the D244E·Ado* enzyme are in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plots defined by the PROCHECK program (14Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The crystallographic R and freeR values of the WT are 0.228 and 0.278 for 49,537 and 4,950 reflections, respectively. The corresponding values of the D244E·Ado* structure are 0.217 and 0.287 for 40,173 and 4,017 reflections, respectively. The active site geometries of the WT and D244E·Ado* structures are shown in Fig. 3. Three crystal structures of rat liver AdoHcyase have been determined (7Hu Y. Komoto J. Huang Y. Gomi T. Ogawa H.

The structure of the substrate-free WT, which has a largely open cleft between the NAD-binding domain and the catalytic domain, represents an open-conformation structure of the enzyme (7Hu Y.

The bound NAD is in an oxidized state (i.e. NAD+). The D244E·Ado* structure contains a trapped Ado intermediate (Ado*, i.e.3-keto-adenosine) in the active site and a reduced NAD (i.e.NADH) (8Komoto J. Huang Y. Gomi T. Ogawa H. Takata Y. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32147-32156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cleft between the NAD-binding domain and the catalytic domain is closed. The WT complexed with a potential inhibitor DEA (WT·DEA) has a closed conformation but contains unmodified DEA and NAD+. The catalytic domains (residues: 1–185 and 357–390) of closed structures of WT·DEA and D244E·Ado* complexes are superimposed on that of the substrate-free open structure of WT by the least-squares method. The r.m.s.d. values between the WT and WT·DEA structures and the WT and D244E·Ado* structures are 0.53 Å and 0.52 Å, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, the open and closed structures have very similar substrate binding cavity, suggesting that the open structure has an intact substrate binding site. Although the molecular shapes of DEA and Ado* are quite different, the active site geometries of the WT·DEA complex and the D244E·Ado* complex are nearly identical (the r.m.s.d. is 0.33 Å), indicating that the active site of AdoHcyase is relatively rigid in nature. Therefore, the structure of D244E·Ado* can represent the structure of the WT:Ado* structure. On the basis of the three crystal structures of AdoHcyase, the kinetic data, and the NADH accumulation data, we propose a detailed catalytic mechanism of AdoHcy hydrolysis by AdoHcyase. Distances and angles of the possible hydrogen bonds that participate in the proposed catalytic mechanism are listed in TableIII. In the substrate-free open structure, the Oε1 of Glu-155 and Oδ2 of Asp-130 have an abnormally short contact (2.64 Å), suggesting that the two oxygen atoms are connected by a hydrogen bond (i.e. Oε1 is protonated). The Nζ (–NH3+) of Lys-185 is involved in trigonal-fashion hydrogen bonding with three oxygens (O (Glu-155), Oδ1 (Asn-180), and Oδ1 (Asp-189)) (Fig. 3 A). When an AdoHcy/Ado (substrate) binds to the substrate binding site of the open structure, the 2′-OH and 3′-OH are positioned so as to be able to form hydrogen bonds with the Oδ2 of Asp-189 and the Nζ of Lys-185, respectively (Fig. 3 A). The proximity of the 3′-OH would lower the pK a value of Nζ and one of hydrogens of the Nζ readily dissociates from it. However, at this stage, the 3′-OH of the substrate cannot participate in hydrogen bonding with the Nζ of Lys-185, because the Nζ is involved in stable trigonal-fashion hydrogen bonding.Table IIIDistances (Å) and angles (°) of possible hydrogen bondsPossible hydrogen bond [Residue]A–X(H) · · · Y–B[Residue]A–X(H) · · · Y angleX(H) · · · Y distanceX(H) · · · Y–B angleSubstrate-free open structure in the WT [Lys-185]Cε–Nζ(H) · · · O–C[Glu-155]80 (1)2.86 (4)166 (2) [Lys-185]Cε–Nζ(H) · · · Oδ1–Cγ[Asn-180]108 (1)2.72 (5)145 (2) [Lys-185]Cε–Nζ(H) · · · Oδ2–Cγ[Asp-189]124 (2)2.74 (3)123 (1) [Glu-155]Cδ–Oε1(H) · · · Oδ2–Cγ[Asp-130]128 (1)2.64 (3)126 (1)Substrate bound closed structure in the D244E:Ado* [His-54]Cδ2–Nε2(H) · · · O5′–C5′[Ado]133 (1)2.82 (5)134 (3) [His-54]Cε1–Nε2(H) · · · O5′–C5′[Ado]117 (1)2.82 (5)134 (3) [Lys-185]Cε–Nζ(H) · · · O3′–C3′[Ado]119 (2)2.93 (6)134 (2) [Lys-185]Cε–Nζ(H) · · · Oδ1–Cγ[Asn-180]121 (1)2.86 (4)134 (2) [Lys-185]Cε–Nζ(H) · · · Oδ1–Cγ[Asn-190]113 (3)2.82 (9)141 (2) [Asp-189]Cγ–Oδ1(H) · · · Nε2–Cδ2[His-352]121 (2)2.92 (4)79 (1) [Asp-189]Cγ–Oδ1(H) · · · Nε2–Cε1[His-352]121 (2)2.92 (4)171 (1) [Asn-190]Cγ–Nδ2(H) · · · Oδ1–Cγ[Asn-180]108 (1)3.31 (3)115 (2) [Ser-360]Cε–Oγ(H) · · · Oδ2–Oγ[Asp-189]117 (1)2.68 (6)109 (2) [Ado]C2′–O2′(H) · · · Oε1–Cδ[Glu-155]130 (1)2.61 (4)142 (1) [Ado]C2′–O2′(H) · · · Oδ2–Cγ[Asp-189]133 (2)2.56 (1)102 (1) [Ado]C3′–C4′(H) · · · Oδ2–Cγ[Asp-130]116 (2)3.22 (6)104 (1) [Ado]C5′–C4′(H) · · · Oδ2–Cγ[Asp-130]101 (1)3.22 (6)104 (1) [Ado]O4′–C4′(H) · · · Oδ2–Cγ[Asp-130]92 (1)3.22 (6)104 (1) [Ado]C5′–O5′(H) · · · Nδ1–Cε1[His-300]102 (2)2.80 (6)91 (1) [Ado]C5′–O5′(H) · · · Nδ1–Cγ[His-300]102 (2)2.80 (6)159 (1)The mean values of the four subunits are listed along with the r.m.s.d. values in parentheses.

Open table in a new tab The mean values of the four subunits are listed along with the r.m.s.d. values in parentheses.

Thus, the Nζ(H) · · · O–C is a charge-charge interaction rather than a hydrogen bond. The catalytic domain closes the gap between it and the NAD-binding domain by rotating about 17° around the molecular hinge section. This movement brings the substrate closer to the bound NAD+, and the Oδ1 of Asn-190 approaches the Nζ from the opposite side of the O of Glu-155. The Oδ2 of Asp-189 forms hydrogen bonds with the 2′-OH of substrate and the Oγ of Ser-360, and consequently, the carboxylate group of Asp-189 is polarized. At this stage, the hydrogen bonding rearrangement around Nζ of Lys-185 occurs, i.e.(Nζ–H1 · · · O[Glu-155], Nζ–H2 · · · Oδ1[Asn-180], Nζ–H3 · · · Oδ1[Asp-189]) seen in the WT structure (Fig. 3 A) changes to (Nζ–H1 · · · Oδ1[Asn-190], Nζ–H2 · · · Oδ1[Asn-180], Nζ · · · H–O3′[Ado/AdoHcy]) as seen in the D244E·Ado* structure (Fig. 3 B). In the hydrogen bonding rearrangement, the Oδ1 of Asp-189 receives a proton from the Nζ and moves away from it and forms a weak hydrogen bond with the Nε2 of His-352. The neutral Nζ (–NH2) forms a new trigonal-fashion hydrogen bond with the newly approached Oδ1 of Asn-190, the 3′-OH of the substrate, and the Oδ1 of Asn-180. As a result, the O of Glu-155 is expelled from hydrogen bonding with the Nζ of Lys-185, but the presence of the O of Glu-155 near the Nζ increases the basicity of the Nζ. Subsequently, the following events occur: 1) The neutral Nζ (–NH2) of Lys-185 serves as a base to accept the proton from 3′-OH. 2) The 3′-CH hydrogen is directly transferred to NAD+, and the 3′-keto-AdoHcy/Ado intermediate and NADH are produced. 3) The Oε1 of Glu-155 breaks the hydrogen bond with the Oδ2 of Asp-130 and forms a new hydrogen bond with the 2′-OH of the substrate. Consequently, the basicity of Asp-130 is increased. Asp-130, which is near the 4′-CH hydrogen of the substrate, acts as a base to directly abstract the proton from the C4′, and the 3′-keto-AdoHcy/Ado carbanion intermediate is produced. 4) His-54 donates a proton to Sδ/O5′ of the resulting carbanion. Then the carbanion releases Hcy/H2O to form 3′-keto-4′,5′-dehydroadenosine. 5) The reverse process described above occurs by adding H2O/Hcy to 3′-keto-4′,5′-dehydroadenosine. In the proposed mechanism, Lys-185 and Asp-130 play key roles in the oxidation of the C3′ and C4′ of the substrate, respectively. Asp-189 acts as the activator of Lys-185, and Asn-190 facilitates the hydrogen bond rearrangement. Replacement of these amino acid residues with other amino acid residues is expected to substantially reduce the catalytic activities of the mutated enzymes. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1 and TableII, the catalytic activities (k cat/K m ) of the mutated enzymes are reduced to 2.45 × 10−4 for D130N, 1.40 × 10−3 for K185N, 1.78 × 10−4 for D189N, and 2.82 × 10−3 for N190S, in comparison with the WT. Crystal structures of the mutated enzymes and their complexes with AdoHcy are necessary to qualitatively analyze the kinetic data and the NADH accumulation in the active sites of the mutated enzymes. However, as discussed above, the active site of AdoHcyase is relatively rigid in nature, and the mutated amino acid residues are either the same or smaller than the original amino acid residues in size. Therefore it is reasonable to assume that the individual mutation has an effect on a small local area of the active site surface. On the basis of this assumption, the kinetic data (Table II) and the NADH accumulations (Fig. 2) are interpreted. All the mutated amino acid residues except for Asn-190 are located on the active site surface (Fig. 4). From Fig.3 A, Asp-130 is closest to the substrate, followed by Asp-189, Lys-185, and Asn-190 in that order. Therefore, the mutation of Asp-130 would reduce the substrate binding maximally, and the mutation of Asn-190 reduces it minimally. Although K m is not equal to K d (i.e. K m =K d +k 2/k 1) (16Voet D. Voet J.G. Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 353Google Scholar), theK m values of the mutated enzymes might have a correlation with the distance between the substrate and the mutated amino acid residue if the individual mutation effects only the area around the mutation site of the active site surface. Indeed, theK m of D130N is the largest, followed by those of D189N, K185N, and N190S in that order. The AdoHcy hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by AdoHcyase is divided into two stages, namely, the oxidation step (AdoHcy → 3′-keto-4′,5′-dehydroadenosine) (steps 1 and 2) and the reduction step (3′-keto-4′,5′-dehydroadenosine → Ado) (steps 3 and 4) (see Scheme FS1in the Introduction). Because the reduction step is very similar to the reverse reaction of the oxidation step, the oxidation step and its reverse step are considered here. When the oxidation rate is faster than the reduction rate, the bound NAD+ is reduced to NADH and thus a significant NADH accumulation should be observed. On the other hand, when the oxidation and reduction rates are equal, then NADH accumulation should not be observed. Specifically, if the protons involved in the oxidation reactions follow back the same pathway in the reduction reactions, the oxidation and reduction rates are equal. On the other hand, the protons take a different pathway in the oxidation and reduction reactions, and then the oxidation and reduction rates may not be equal. The D189N, N190S, and D130N mutants show a hyperbolic accumulation of NADH when they are incubated with AdoHcy, indicating that the oxidation rate is faster than the reduction rate and thus the bound NAD+ is reduced to NADH. The NADH accumulation suggests that protons involved in the oxidation reactions are released into the solvent rather than being retained by the specific amino acid residues (Asp-189 and Asp-130). On the other hand, the K185N has a detectable hydrolysis activity, but there is little accumulation of NADH, indicating that the proton involved in the oxidation reaction comes back through the same pathway in the reduction reaction. Because carboxyl and carbamoyl groups are of similar size, the carbamoyl group of Asn-189 can occupy the same site as the carboxyl group of Asp-189. The carbamoyl group receives a proton from Nζ of Lys-185 (–CONH2 → –CONH3+) but quickly releases the proton into the solvent and becomes neutral –CONH2. In the reverse reaction, formation of –CONH3+does not occur, and thus the Nζ of Lys-185 must receive a proton from the solvent. Apparently the reduction step is slowed down. Consequently, a significant NADH accumulation is observed and most of the enzymes become inactive. Thus, the enzyme catalysis rate is very low. The difference between the WT and D189N cases is illustrated below. Schemes 2 and 3View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ser-190 cannot make a hydrogen bond with the Nζ of Lys-185, because the side chain is too short. When the 3′-OH of ribose moves close to the Nζ of Lys-185, the Nζ slowly releases a proton into the solvent and forms another set of trigonal-fashion hydrogen bonds with Oδ1(Asp-189), Oδ1(Asn-180), and O3′(ribose). The trigonal-fashion hydrogen bonding is stabilized by a charge-charge interaction. Consequently, the reverse step is further slow and a significant accumulation of NADH is observed. The difference between the WT and N190S cases is illustrated below. Schemes 4 and 5View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The side chain of Asn-185 is too short to make trigonal-fashion hydrogen bonds as Lys-185 does. Therefore, Asn-185 cannot participate in the catalytic reaction. The space occupied by the Nζ of Lys-185 is filled with Oδ1 of Asp-189, which makes a pair of hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of ribose. The rate of oxidation is slow, because Asp-189 is less basic than Lys-185. However, the proton of 3′-OH moves between O3′ of ribose and Oδ1 of Asp-189 without breaking the hydrogen bond. Therefore the oxidation step is irreversible and thus the NADH accumulation is negligible. The difference between the WT and K185N cases is illustrated below. Schemes 6 and 7View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The carbamoyl group of Asn-130 is in the same position as the carboxyl group of Asp-130, and the Oδ1 can make an interaction with H4′. However it cannot abstract the H4′ from C4′, because it is impossible for the carbamoyl to become –C(O+H)NH2. Therefore, the C4′ oxidation does not occur except for a natural oxidation (i.e. H4′ is slowly released into solvent). The NADH accumulation is not large, because the C3′ oxidation step is intact and, thus, reversible. The difference between the WT and D130N cases is illustrated below. Schemes 8 and 9View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) His-54 and His-300 form hydrogen bonds with O5′ of Ado in the D244E·Ado* structure (Fig.3 B). As illustrated below, it is very clear that these two histidine residues hold and polarize a water molecule that nucleophilically attacks the C5′ of 3′-keto-4′,5′-dehydroadenosine to produce 3′-keto-Ado as shown below. However, it is not clear whether an Hcy molecule attacks/leaves the C5′ from the same direction as the water molecule. In conclusion, the site-directed mutagenesis study and the NADH accumulation measurements are consistent with the proposed catalytic mechanism of AdoHcyase based on the crystal structures of the substrate-free WT, D244E·Ado*, WT·DEA.

The prospect of being able to crack some sort of recognition code relies on the assumption that the solutions to the problem of binding a specific domain are concentrated in a small cluster in the sequence/structure space. Alternatively, the problem of finding the consensus ligand for any receptor domain would change into the more difficult problem of finding “all” theconsensus sequences that share the potential of binding to that receptor. Another intriguing issue is why relatively few scaffolds have been selected during evolution for the purpose of maintaining a rather complex protein interaction network. Apparently, once a solution for binding to a specific surface feature is found, that solution is explored extensively to find new binding specificities. An advantageous characteristic of a protein recognition domain would be the ability to modify recognition specificity by a limited number of changes of its primary sequence without extensive structural rearrangements and without the need to explore long evolutionary pathways encompassing non-functional states. This would permit, by accumulation of a small number of mutations, the growth of a functionally large natural repertoire, wherefrom the selection of new binding specificity could be possible. To obtain evidence of this postulated malleability of protein recognition modules and of the elusive recognition code, we chose to focus on SH3 domains, because they represent the most numerous family of protein interaction modules in eukaryotic genomes (11Ponting C.P. Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and because the structures of several SH3 domains, both isolated and in complex with their targets, have been determined (reviewed in Refs. 12Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 13Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Musacchio A. Janin J. Wodak S. How SH3 Domains Recognize Proline. Advances in Protein Chemistry. Academic Press, New York2002: 61Google Scholar). SH3 domains bind to their targets by accommodating a peptide segment, which is folded into a poly-proline II helix, into a binding cleft formed by three molecular pockets of their surface. Two of the pockets are hydrophobic and host the PXXP motif, which is considered the signature of SH3 ligands, whereas the third is negatively charged and determines the specificity and the orientation of the ligand by hosting a positively charged residue that either precedes or follows the PXXP motif (15Lim W.A. Richards F.M. Fox R.O. Nature. 1994; 372: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 16Musacchio A. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 17Feng S. Chen J.K., Yu, H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Peptides characterized by the RXXPXXP motif bind in an orientation called “class I” orientation, whereas peptides displaying the PXXPXR motif bind in the opposite orientation and are termed “class II.” A third class of ligands, exemplified by peptide ligands of the Abl SH3 domain, do not contain a positively charged residue, are characterized by the consensus PX@XXPXXP (@ = aromatic residue), and bind in the class I orientation (2Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 16Musacchio A. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. Nat. Struct.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5598-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Although SH3 domains share ∼30% amino acid similarity, and a common fold, the ability to predict the peptide recognition specificity of any given SH3 domain has been challenging. Over the past few years, several groups have used combinatorial peptide libraries to characterize the recognition specificity of protein interaction modules (reviewed in Ref. 19Kay B.K. Kasanov J. Knight S. Kurakin A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have generated an SH3 repertoire by modulating the chemical characteristics of the ligand binding surface of a specific SH3 scaffold. We have then used this repertoire to characterize potential evolutionary pathways that would change the domain recognition specificity. Finally, we have exploited the information obtained from the characterization of SH3 domains that bind to two specific peptides to produce a position specific scoring matrix and to develop an algorithm that permits to infer the molecular recognition properties of SH3 domains. The Lambda vector, used for the display of the SH3 repertoire, was derived from λpRH825 (20Santi E. Capone S. Mennuni C. Lahm A. Tramontano A. Luzzago A. Nicosia A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) by deletion of an XbaI fragment. This deletion removes one of the two LoxP sites and the entire plasmid DNA. Like the original vector, this derivative has a second copy of theD gene, but includes at its 3′-end two sites, SpeI and NotI, that can be used for the insertion of DNA fragments (21Castagnoli L. Zucconi A. Quondam M. Rossi M. Vaccaro P. Panni S. Paoluzi S. Santonico E. Dente L. Cesareni G. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2001; 4: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and is more stable (i.e. the secondD gene is not deleted after several growth cycles). The constructions of the GST-SH31fusion plasmids expressing yeast SH3 domains have been described elsewhere (22Tong A.H. Drees B. Nardelli G. Bader G.D. Brannetti B. Castagnoli L. Evangelista M. Ferracuti S. Nelson B. Paoluzi S. Quondam M. Zucconi A. Hogue C.W. Fields S. Boone C. Cesareni G. Science. 2002; 295: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). To assemble a hybrid sequence encoding an Abl SH3 domain with a discrete, degenerate codons, we designed a set of partially overlapping oligonucleotides, whose sequences are reported here: R287, CCACCCACGAATTCAACCTGTTCGTT; R286, GCTCTGYWCGACTWCGTTGCTVNSRNSVVSRVSRMSCTGTCCATCACCAAAGGT; R288, GAAAAACTGCGTGTTCTGGGTTACRVCCACAACGGTRRSTGGTGCGAAGCTCAG; R277, GTTCCGTCCAMCTWCATCACCCCGGTGGATCCTCTCCGCC; R278, AGCAACGWAGTCGWRCAGAGCAACGAACAGGTTGAATTCGTGGGTGG; R279, GTAACCCAGAACACGCAGTTTTTCACCTTTGGTGATGGACAG; R280, TGATGWAGKTGGACGGAACSHMACCCTGACCGTTTTTGGTCTGAGCTTCGCACCA; and R289, GGCGGAGAGGATCCACCGGGG. Sequence symbols are according to IUPAC format: W = A, T; R = A, G; M = A, C; Y = C, T; N = G, A, T, C; S = C, G; H = A, C, T; K = G, T; V = A, C, G. The oligonucleotides were phosphorylated at their 5′ termini with T4 polynucleotide kinase and the hybrid gene assembled by raising the temperature to 94 °C and then slowly cooling down to 37 °C. The partially assembled gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers R314 (CCACCGACACTAGTAATGACCCCAACCTTTTCG) and R344 (GCGCATGCGCGGCCGCGACTGTTCACCGGGGTGATGWA), which contain SpeI and a NotI sites, respectively. After amplification, the DNA was digested with SpeI and NotI restriction enzymes and purified using the QIAquick-spin PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Two micrograms of SpeI/NotI-digested L14 DNA were ligated to 10–30 ng of purified insert. The ligation mixture was packaged using a Lambda packaging kit (AmershamBiosciences, Inc.) and plated with Escherichia coli BB4 on Luria broth (LB) plates, containing 10 mm MgCl2and 0.2% maltose. After 8 h at 37 °C, phage particles were recovered by adding 10 ml/plate of SM (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) and eluted for 3 h at 4 °C. The complexity of the library (number of independent clones) was 107 plaque forming units (pfu), and the titer of the eluted phages was about 1010 pfu/ml. Affinity selections with poly-proline peptides were performed in microtiter plates (Nunc) coated overnight a 4 °C with 5 μg/ml streptavidin (Sigma) in 100 μl of PBS (10 mmNa2HPO4/KH2PO4 (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl). In these conditions ∼0.4 μg of streptavidin remain bound to the plastic well. The coated plates were washed ten times with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C with biotinylated peptides (10 μm in PBS). Plates were washed again and blocked for 1 h at 25 °C with 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. About 109 phage particles from the library (i.e. ∼100 library equivalents) were added to each well and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After five washes with PBS-0.05% Tween 20, the selected phages were recovered by adding 100 μl of BB4 cells in 10 mm MgSO4 and incubating for 30 min at 37 °C. The infected cells were then plated with additional indicator bacteria and top agar and grown overnight at 37 °C, and phage were eluted as described above. After titrating the number of phage particles in the phage suspension, the selection cycle was carried out for two more times. Phage plaques from each selection round were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by overlaying the membrane onto the top agar of the Petri plate and by incubating for 4 h at 37 °C. Filters were blocked for 2 h at room temperature in PBS containing 4% BSA. Biotinylated peptides were bound to streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Sigma Chemical Co.) for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with filters at 4 °C overnight. After five washes with PBS-0.05% Tween, positive plaques were revealed by a colorimetric reaction using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrates (Sigma). ELISA assays were performed in microtiter plates (Nunc), coated with biotinylated peptides as described above. Positive plaques were collected and used to prepare plate lysates. Phages were eluted from a 6-cm plate with 2 ml of SM buffer and precipitated with 1 volume of 20% polyethylene glycol-2.5 m NaCl for 1 h on ice. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of SM buffer and 10 μl of suspension, containing about 107phages in 100 μl of PBS-4% BSA, was added to each microtiter well. After 10 washes with PBS-0.05% Tween 20, plates were incubated with an anti-lambda polyclonal antibody for 1 h at room temperature and then with an anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Sigma). Retention of the phage particles in the microtiter plate wells was revealed by adding 100 μl/well of a 1 μg/ml solution ofp-nitrophenyl phosphate in 50 mmNaHCO3, pH 9.6, 20 mm MgCl2. To compare the binding strength of different GST-SH3 proteins, microtiter wells, which had been coated with biotinylated peptides as described above, were incubated with serial dilutions of fusion proteins in PBS-4% BSA for 2 h at 4 °C. After 10 washes, a goat polyclonal anti-GST serum (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was added in PBS-4% BSA for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with anti-goat Ig antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma). The reaction was revealed as described above. Data were fitted using a single class of an equivalent binding site equation. Mutant Abl-SH3 coding sequences were assembled from two overlapping DNA fragments obtained by PCR amplification with pairs of complementary primers, each carrying the mutated sequence, and two primers that prime from the 5′- and 3′-ends of the wild type SH3 domain sequence. This latter pair of primers, which were common to all the mutagenesis experiments, containBamHI and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively, for directional cloning into the pGEX2T vector; their sequences are: R596,GGCAGCTAGGATCCAATGACCCCAACC, and R597, GGACGAGTGAATTCCACTGTTGACTGG. The mutagenic primers used in the first PCR amplification step were: R599, AGTTATGCTTAGGTCGTTATCTCCACTGGC and R598, AGTGGAGATAACGACCTAAGCATAACTAAAG for T79D; R618, GTCTTAGGCTATTGTCACAATGGGGAATG and R619, ACACCATTCCCCATTGTGACAATAGCCTAAGAC for N94C; R620, CAAAAATGGCCAAGGCTATGTCCCAAGCAAC and R621, GTAGTTGCTTGGGACATAGCCTTGGCCATT for W110Y; R764, CAAAAATGGCCAAGGCTTGGTCCCAAGCAAC and R765, GTAGTTGCTTGGGACCAAGCCTTGGCCT for W110V; R766, CAAAAATGGCCAAGGCGTGGTCCCAAGCAAC and R767, GTAGTTGCTTGGGACCACGCCTTGGCCT for W110L. As a scaffold for our general repertoire, we chose a well-characterized SH3 domain, the one of the human protein kinase Abl, whose structure in complex with the peptide ligand APTMPPPLPP (1Abo) has been determined at high resolution by x-ray crystallography (23Pisabarro M.T. Serrano L. Wilmanns M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Inspection of the three-dimensional structure of the complex permitted the identification of the residues within the SH3 domain that make contact with the ligand and were, therefore, likely to be involved in determining its recognition specificity. To identify the positions to diversify within this scaffold, we aligned 560 different eukaryotic SH3 domains, whose sequence was available in the PFAM data base (24Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Howe K.L. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar) when we started the project, and determined the frequency of occurrence of each amino acid residue at each position that potentially contact its ligand. Finally we designed a hybrid gene that encodes the Abl SH3 domain but has a degenerate sequence in the codons for the contact residues. The extent of the degeneracy at each position is a compromise between the desirability of obtaining a repertoire that includes all the residues that are found at those positions in natural SH3 domains and the necessity of maintaining the size of the repertoire within the limits set by the transformation efficiency of E. coli. Although the theoretical complexity of the repertoire is ∼2 × 109, complete coverage was not possible because of the design limitations imposed by the genetic code; however, the repertoire includes at least 90% of the natural variability at each contact position. The library of variant Abl SH3 domains was generated in bacteriophage lambda (25Smith G.P. Science. 1985; 228: 1315-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3151) Google Scholar). The coding region for the domain was fused to the carboxyl terminus of the D capsid protein, which tolerates inserts and exists at ∼400 copies on each virus particle. Ten million recombinants were created, representing ∼1% of the theoretical size of the repertoire. By sequencing random isolates, we confirmed that 60% of the clones contain in-frame fusions of the D and SH3 domain coding regions and that the SH3 domains display random combinations of the allowed residues at the degenerate positions. Because the SH3 domains in the repertoire are expressed on the surface of bacteriophage lambda, ligands for any kind of poly-proline peptide can be screened by a plaque lift assay or selected by panning with a target peptide (26Zucconi A. Dente L. Santonico E. Castagnoli L. Cesareni G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We first asked whether, by these techniques, we could recover from the library SH3 domains that would bind to the peptide APTYPPPLPP (Abl-pep), which is a high affinity ligand of the Abl-SH3 domain (27Pisabarro M.T. Serrano L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10634-10640Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although the percentage of clones in the library that binds to Abl-pep is less than 0.1%, after one or two panning cycles, ∼1 and 25% of the clones display an SH3 domain that binds with apparent affinity that is comparable to the one of the wild type SH3 domain (data not shown). Binding is specific, because the vast majority of the selected clones do not bind to a peptide ligand (LSSRPLPTLPSP; Src-pep) for the human Src SH3 domain (Fig.1A) (18Rickles R.J. Botfield M.C. Weng Z. Taylor J.A. Green O.M. Brugge J.S. Zoller M.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5598-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 28Sparks A.B. Adey N.B. Quilliam L.A. Thorn J.M. Kay B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 498-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Comparison of the residues that are present or missing at specific degenerate positions of the domains selected after two panning cycles (Fig. 1A) permits one to identify the requirements for binding of an SH3 domain to the Abl-pep probe. Some of the degenerate positions did not show any residue preference within the limits of the variability engineered in the repertoire; for instance, at positions 70 and 115, tyrosine and phenylalanine are equally acceptable. By contrast, at position 110, of the 9 residues tested at this position, only tryptophan is found in the SH3 domains selected with the Abl-pep. Interestingly, the threonine present at position 79, which flanks the P-3 peptide binding site and was previously identified as a key residue in determining the preference for a tyrosine instead of a positively charged residue at P-3 (16Musacchio A. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), can be replaced by a glutamate (but not aspartate) in the SH3 domain scaffold without destroying binding. Next, we asked whether the SH3 repertoire contained domains that would bind to an unrelated peptide that is normally recognized by a different class of SH3 domains. For this purpose we selected the peptide sequence, LSSRPLPTLPSP (Src-pep), which efficiently binds to SH3 domains of the Src family (i.e. Src, Yes, Fyn). The SH3 domains of these protein-tyrosine kinases are only 30% similar in primary sequence to the SH3 domain of Abl and contain an n-Src loop that is one residue shorter than in Abl. After three rounds of affinity selection, we could identify SH3 domains that bind to Src-pep, although at a much lower frequency than observed with the Abl-pep. Sequence analysis of the isolates revealed that all, but one, had a Cys residue at position 94. Interestingly, this residue was not included in the original repertoire design, because it is not present in any natural SH3 domain, and thus this codon likely resulted from errors in oligonucleotide synthesis. The residues that are enriched with respect to the unselected repertoire in the two panning experiments can be compared in Fig.2 where the font size is proportional to the enrichment factor for each residue in each degenerate position. Residues that, although included in the original repertoire design, are never found in the selected domains are in reverse color. This comparison reveals more or less subtle differences whose rationalization is not always straightforward. The residues forming the two hydrophobic pockets that host the PXXP motif do not display a high selectivity when tested with the two peptides used in this experiment. At positions 70 and 115 both Src-pep and Abl-pep ligands preferentially display a Tyr. However, also the other residues (His and Phe) allowed by the repertoire design are accepted, irrespective of the ligand considered, albeit at a lower frequency. At position 98 both peptides prefer negative residues and do not tolerate positive ones. Finally, a certain degree of selectivity is determined by the identity of the amino acids at position 114 in the 3/10 helix preceding the β5 strand and in residue 72, which participates in the formation of the central pocket. At position 114, Thr favors the interaction with the Abl-pep whereas an Asn determines the preference for the Src-pep. Note that the wild type Abl-SH3 domain has an Asn at this position. By contrast, at position 72, the Abl and Src peptides favor Phe and Tyr, respectively. However, the most striking differences, emerging from the comparison of the amino acid sequences of the two families of the selected domains, involve residues that flank the third hydrophilic pocket, which hosts the amino side of class I peptides; namely, residue 110 that is only Trp in Abl-pep ligands and residue 94 that is a Cys in the vast majority of the SH3 domains selected for binding to the Src-pep. Finally, as already pointed out, position 79 is a major determinant for the selection of the residue at position P-3 in the poly proline peptide with Thr favoring hydrophobic and aromatic residues and Asp determining the preference for a positively charged residue. From the two selection experiments described above, we have identified positions 79, 94, and 110 within the scaffold of the Abl SH3 domain to be the major determinants that discriminate between binding to the Abl and Src peptide ligands. However, this approach cannot exclude that other residues or combination of residues may play an important, albeit less prominent, role. To ascertain how few of these residues should one change to reverse the Abl SH3 ligand specificity, we constructed a series of site-directed mutations by changing residues 79, 94, and 110 in the wild type Abl SH3 domain. (For simplicity, these mutant domains will be referred to by three-letter code such that the three letters correspond to the residues at position 79, 94, and 110, respectively.) The mutant domains were expressed as fusions to the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) protein, and their ability to bind different peptides was evaluated by ELISA. As seen in Fig.3A, as few as two amino acid replacements, either at positions 79 and 94 or 94 and 110, are sufficient to switch the peptide ligand preference of the Abl SH3 domain. By changing the three residues into TCL or TCV the binding propensity is completely reversed and the apparent affinity of the two mutant peptides becomes comparable to that of an SH3 domain of Src (Fig. 3B). The characterization of the domains selected from the SH3 repertoire for their ability to bind to Abl-pep or Src-pep was not sufficient to establish a correlation between specific residues in the SH3 binding surface and the preference for specific residues at a given position within the ligand peptide. To this possibility, we have performed a complementary set of experiments by selecting peptide ligands from a phage-displayed combinatorial 9-mer peptide library using as baits GST fusions to the wild type Abl-SH3 domain and five variants carrying one two or three mutations at positions 79, 94, and 110. The six GST fusions all select peptides containing the PXXP consensus, thereby confirming that the changes that we have introduced do not affect the preference for the typical SH3 recognition motif (Fig.4). The wild type SH3 domain of Abl, which has residues TNW at these three positions, prefers peptide ligands that have an aromatic side chain at P-3 and a Pro or a Phe at P-5. Although, the DNW mutant did not discriminate between the Abl-pep and a peptide derivative in which the Tyr was changed into an Arg (Fig. 3A) from the peptide selection experiment, it is clear that replacement of the Thr residue with an Asp at position 79 in the Abl SH3 domain scaffold favors the selection of peptide ligands with an Arg at P-3. This preference is a characteristic of all the domains that have Asp at 79. The TCW mutant (i.e. Cys in place of Asn at position 94) has a dramatically altered ligand specificity and selects peptides with Arg at P-5 and a Leu at P-1. In the double mutant, DCW, the selected peptides match the specificity of the Src SH3 domain, with Arg at P-3 and Leu at P-1 in the consensus. Finally, by substituting W110 with a smaller residue in the triple mutants DCY and DCV, the selected peptides also prefer Pro at P-2. In conclusion, this set of experiments has permitted to identify a strong correlation between the Cys at position 94 in the SH3 domain and the Leu at position P-1 in the ligand peptide. Furthermore, the substitution of the Thr at 79 with an Asp shifts the preference for peptides that have a hydrophobic side chain at P-3 to peptides that have an Arg at the same position. Collectively, these results contribute to characterize a number of potential evolutionary pathways leading, via three single point mutations, from an SH3 domain that binds to APTYPPPLPP and not to LSSRPLPTLPSP, to a second SH3 domain with opposite specificity (Fig.5).FIG. 5Schematic representation of potential evolutionary pathways.A, each mutant Abl SH3 domain is represented as a rectangle.

The DNA-nuclear matrix interaction seems to be mediated by chromatin-associated proteins such as topoisomerase II (3Mirkovitch J. Mirault M.E. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1984; 39: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), matrix-associated region-binding proteins such as hnRNPU (16Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G.

It was reported that the hSWI/SNF protein complex involved in the remodeling of chromatin during gene activation could be associated with the nuclear matrix attachment region (18Reyes J.C. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The nuclear matrix may act as an active structure on which gene expression takes place (for review, see Ref. 9Cook P.R. Science. 1999; 284: 1790-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). On the basis of experimental observations, it has been suggested that actively transcribing nucleotide-protein complex is associated with the nuclear matrix (7Wansink D. Schul W. van der Kraan I. van Steensel B. van Driel R. de Jong L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar,19Jackson D.A. Cook P.R.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and that posttranscriptional processing of nascent transcripts takes place in association with the nuclear matrix (23Zeitlin S. Parent A. Silverstein S. Efstratiadis A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 24Spector D.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recently, protein mass spectrometry of the interchromatin granule, a subfraction of the nuclear matrix, identified many RNA-binding proteins involved in RNA processing (25Mintz P.J. Patterson S.D. Neuwald A.F. Spahr C.S. Spector D.L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4308-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the nuclear matrix constitutes various dynamic nuclear substructures involved in diverse nuclear functions. To clarify the functional roles of the nuclear matrix, more protein components of nuclear matrix substructures should be identified and characterized. We carried out the immunoscreening of a human placenta cDNA library with antibodies to total nuclei or nuclear matrix proteins, and we isolated two clones coding for nuclear matrix proteins NXP-1 and NXP-2, which were composed of 631 and 939 amino acids, respectively. A data base analysis indicated that NXP-1 was identical to cohesin (26Sadano H. Sugimoto H. Sakai F. Nomura N. Osumi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) but that NXP-2 was an unknown protein. In this article, we report that NXP-2 is a nuclear matrix-associated protein with RNA binding activity. The RNA binding activity and nuclear matrix binding of NXP-2 suggest a role in RNA processing. The sequence similarity with other nuclear RNA-binding proteins is low, indicating that NXP-2 might have a novel function in nuclear RNA metabolism. A nuclear scaffold was prepared from rat liver as described by Paulson and Laemmli (27Paulson J.R. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1977; 12: 817-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). The nuclear scaffold fraction (10 mg) was mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant and injected into BALB/c mice six times at 2-week intervals. After the immunization, the spleen was excised, and hybridomas were prepared using conventional methods. One of the monoclonal antibodies, 4D11, recognized the nuclear matrix upon the immunocytochemistry of rat 3Y1 and HeLa cells. A cDNA clone, H4, was cloned by conventional immunoscreening with 4D11 of 6 × 105 independent clones of a λgt11 human placenta cDNA library. Immunoscreening was performed as described previously (26Sadano H. Sugimoto H. Sakai F. Nomura N. Osumi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). cDNA inserts released by EcoRI digestion were subcloned into pBluescript II KS(+) vector (Stratagene) and further analyzed by sequencing. A homology search was performed using BLAST programs against the GenBankTM and European Molecular Biology Laboratory data bases. Although no homologous gene had been reported previously, H4 was identical with a part of a cDNA clone registered under the name KIAA0136. KIAA0136 (GenBankTM accession no. D50926) was one of the new genes obtained by analysis of randomly sampled full-length cDNA clones from a human immature myeloid cell line, KG1. For further study, we used KIAA0136 obtained from Dr. Nobuo Nomura (Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Kisarazu, Japan). This clone consists of 4197 nucleotides and contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 939 amino acid residues, starting at nucleotide position 36. We named the protein encoded by KIAA0136 NXP-2. The deduced amino acid sequence was subjected to a Sequence Motif Search on the GenomeNet Data Base Service and the prediction program of coiled-coil developed by Lupas et al. (28Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3466) Google Scholar). HeLa and transfected cells were maintained in F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. For immunostaining, HeLa cells were grown on coverslips and cultivated for 2 days. The coverslips were washed twice with PBS. 1The abbreviations used are: PBSphosphate-buffered salineGSTglutathione S-transferaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidCSKcytoskeletalNLSnuclear localization signal Subsequently, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in PBS for 30 min, and blocked in PBS containing 1.5% fetal calf serum. Immunostaining was carried out with 4D11, followed by incubation with secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cappel Research, Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC). For immunostaining the nucleolus, mouse anti-human nucleoli monoclonal antibody (Chemicon International Inc.) and rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse IgM (Cappel Research, Organon Teknika Corp.) were used. phosphate-buffered saline glutathione S-transferase green fluorescent protein 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid cytoskeletal nuclear localization signal High salt isolation of nuclear matrix was carried out essentially as described by He et al. (29He D.C. Nickerson J.A. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). For in situ extraction, cells grown on coverslips were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. After a wash with PBS, cells were extracted with cytoskeletal (CSK) buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA supplemented with leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin (1 μg/ml each), 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm vanadyl ribonucleoside complex, and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100). After 3 min at 4 °C, the cytosolic soluble proteins were removed. Extraction buffer (CSK buffer containing 250 mm ammonium sulfate) was added next, and the mixture was incubated for 5 min at 4 °C to remove nuclear soluble proteins. Chromatin was solubilized with DNA digestion buffer (CSK buffer containing 0.2–0.5 unit/μl RNase-free DNase I) for 40 min at 37 °C. This treatment removed DNA and histone from the nuclei. The samples were washed with the digestion buffer and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. To digest the nuclear RNA, RNase A (1 unit/μl) was added as a substitute for 20 mm vanadyl ribonucleoside complex in the CSK, extraction, and digestion buffers. For Northern analysis, an MTN blot filter (CLONTECH) containing 2 μg/lane poly(A)+ RNA from human heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas was prehybridized at 65 °C for 30 min in ExpressHyb hybridization buffer (supplied by CLONTECH), hybridized for 1 h at 65 °C with radiolabeled H4 (2 × 106 cpm/ml) in the same buffer, and washed with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS twice for 30 min each, followed by two washes with 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 40 min each at 50 °C, as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridized sequences were identified by autoradiography for 16 h. The GFP-tagged expression vector used in this study was the phGFP(105) series, encoding a GFP mutant that has increased brightness (30Yamasaki M. Hashiguchi N. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Bioimages. 1997; 6: 1-7Google Scholar). phGFP-NXP-2-(25–939) was obtained by introducing a fragment excised from KIAA0136 with SpeI and DraI into the blunted EcoRI site of the phGFP(105)-C1 vector. NXP-2-(25–939) was a cDNA fragment coding for the amino acid sequence between positions 25 and 939 of NXP-2. Other truncated mutants were generated as follows and introduced into the phGFP(105) series of vectors to adjust the frame of amino acid sequences. NXP-2-(25–307) and NXP-2-(307–591) were excised from phGFP-NXP-2-(25–939) with PstI. NXP-2-(589–689) was generated by PCR using phGFP(105)-NXP-2-(25–939) as a template. NXP-2-(307–326) and NXP-2-(326–500) were excised from phGFP-NXP-2-(307–591) with Hin dIII. GFP-NXP-2-(500–591) was excised from phGFP-NXP-2-(307–591) with SmaI and Hin dIII. NXP-2-(326–353) was excised from phGFP-NXP-2-(307–591) with Hin dIII and AflII. NXP-2-(352–500) was excised from phGFP-NXP-2-(307–591) with EcoR I and SalI. For the production of GFP nuclear localization signal (NLS)-tagged proteins, phGFP(105)-NLS-C1 was created, in which the NLS coding sequence from the T antigen of SV40 was inserted between the GFP coding sequence and the C1-type multilinker sequence. phGFP(105)-NLS-C1 was used for the production of truncated mutants phGFP-NLS-NXP-2-(589–689), phGFP-NLS-NXP-2-(688–939), phGFP-NLS-NXP-2-(307–326), phGFP-NLS-NXP-2-(326–500), phGFP-NLS-NXP-2-(500–591), phGFP-NLS-NXP-2-(326–353), and phGFP-NLS-NXP-2-(352–500). Truncated mutants of NXP-2 fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST) were generated using the vector pGEX-4T2 (Amersham Biosciences). To prepare the expression vector for NXP-2-(25–939) fusion protein (denoted pGST-NXP-2-(25–939)), a DNA fragment excised from phGFP-NLS-NXP-2-(25–939) with BglII and SalI was inserted into the BamHI and SalI sites of the pGEX-4T2 vector. Other truncated mutants were generated as follows and introduced into the pGEX-4T series of vectors to adjust the frame of the amino acid sequence. NXP-2-(25–307) was excised from phGFP-NXP-2-(25–307) with BglII and SalI. NXP-2-(307–591) was excised from phGFP-NXP-2-(307–591) with SalI and XhoI. NXP-2-(589–689) was excised from phGFP-NXP-2-(589–689) with SalI and XhoI. NXP-2-(688–939) was excised from phGFP-NXP-2-(688–939) with BglII and SalI. NXP-2-(307–326) was excised from phGFP-NXP-2-(307–326) with Hind III. NXP-2-(326–500) was excised from NXP-2-(326–500) with BamHI and EcoRI. pGST-NXP-2-(500–591) was obtained by self-ligation of pGST-NXP-2-(307–591), which removes the 5′ fragment by Hin dIII digestion. HeLa cells were harvested and suspended at a concentration of 3 × 106 cells/ml in PBS. Electroporation was performed in 1-cm cuvettes for 5 s at 400 V and 250 millifarads (pulse time, 10 ms) using an Electro Cell Manipulator (BTX Electroporation System, San Diego, CA) at room temperature. Cells were then incubated in a complete medium for 16 h at 37 °C and washed three times with PBS. They were subjected to in situ nuclear matrix treatment or fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature for microscopy. After the nuclear matrix treatment, the cell nuclei containing fluorescence were counted for the calculation of expression and retention efficiencies. GST fusion proteins were prepared as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The Northwestern blot RNA binding assay was performed as described by Schenkel et al. (31Schenkel J. Sekeris C.E. Alonso A. Bautz E.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). When the expressed proteins were soluble, they were purified with a glutathione-Sepharose column. When the proteins were insoluble, whole insoluble fractions were dissolved in the sample loading buffer. GST-NXP-2 constructs from Escherichia coli were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blot analysis with anti-GST antibody was carried out as described previously (26Sadano H. Sugimoto H. Sakai F. Nomura N. Osumi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For Northwestern analysis, the membranes were blocked overnight at room temperature in Northwestern buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 25 mm NaCl, 0.05% Ficoll 400, and 0.05% polyvinyl pyrrolidone-40). RNA probes were synthesized using homopolymers (poly(A), poly(U), poly(G), and poly(C)) or mixed polymers (poly(A,U), poly(C,U), and poly(A,G,U)), all purchased from Sigma. The RNA polymers were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The RNA probe was precipitated with ethanol and purified on ultrafree C3HK columns (Millipore, Inc). The blocked membrane was incubated for 30 min in Northwestern buffer containing 0.5% nonfat dry milk and 10 μg/ml tRNA. The labeled RNA probe (105 cpm) was added to the same buffer, and the blot was incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed three times (30 min/wash) with Northwestern buffer to remove unbound or nonspecifically bound RNA. After air-drying for 15 min, autoradiography was performed to detect RNA binding. To clarify the structural components of the cell nucleus, the nuclear matrix was prepared and used as an immunogen to generate monoclonal antibodies. One of the monoclonal antibodies, 4D11, was used to screen a human placenta λgt11 cDNA expression library. A positive clone, H4 (1.9 kb), was isolated from 6 × 104 clones. Upon sequence analysis, H4 was found to correspond to a part of a cDNA clone called KIAA0136. KIAA0136 contained 4197 bp of a cDNA sequence derived from the human immature myeloid cell line KG1. An open reading frame encoding a protein of 939 amino acid residues was found, starting at nucleotide position 36. We searched for homologous cDNA species by performing a BLAST homology search against the GenBankTM data base, and we found a mouse partial cDNA 55% homologous to human KIAA0136 in the protein coding region. No other eukaryotic homolog has been identified yet. Northern blot analysis with the KIAA0136 cDNA probe identified a mRNA band of 4.4 kb that was particularly abundant in the heart, placenta, and skeletal muscle and was also expressed in several other tissues, but not in kidney tissue (Fig. 1). The size was consistent with that of KIAA0136. To analyze the 5′ sequence of the NXP-2 transcript, we carried out a 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends assay with mRNA prepared from HeLa cells. There was no clone containing more of the upstream sequence than KIAA0136. We analyzed the genomic sequence obtained from the data base to identify the 5′-untranslated region of the NXP-2 gene. There was no methionine codon in-frame with the NXP-2 coding sequence within 400 bp upstream of the first methionine codon of KIAA0136. On the other hand, we found a predicted CCAAT box and GC box, but no TATA box, within 150 bp upstream of the first methionine codon of KIAA0136. These results suggest that KIAA0136 encodes the whole NXP-2 protein sequence. NXP-2 was found to be distributed throughout the nucleus, with the exception of the nucleolus, upon indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with a monoclonal antibody, 4D11 (Fig. 2A). The subnuclear distribution of endogenous NXP-2 was further characterized in 3Y1 and HeLa cells. NXP-2 was retained in the nuclear matrix and distributed throughout the nuclear regions (Fig. 2B). Thus, NXP-2 is a nuclear matrix protein. Release of NXP-2 from the nuclear matrix into the supernatant was apparently detected when 1 unit/μl RNase A was added as a substitute for 20 mm vanadyl ribonucleoside complex to the CSK, extraction, and DNase I digestion buffers (Fig. 2D). RNA probably supports the binding of NXP-2 to nuclear matrix. To narrow down the nuclear matrix-associated region, several truncated mutants of NXP-2 (GFP-NXP-2-(25–939), GFP-NXP-2-(307–591), GFP-NXP-2-(589–689), and GFP-NXP-2-(688–939)) were constructed. Two truncated mutants, GFP-NLS-NXP-2-(589–689) and GFP-NLS-NXP-2-(688–939), were also generated using GFP-NLS, which has a nuclear localization signal after the GFP sequence (Fig. 3). When expressed in HeLa cells, GFP-NXP-2-(25–939), GFP-NXP-2-(25–307), GFP-NXP-2-(307–591), GFP-NLS-NXP-2-(589–689), and GFP-NLS-NXP-2-(688–939) were localized in the nucleus, excluding the nucleoli (Fig. 4). These distributions were consistent with that detected by the immunostaining of endogenous NXP-2 with 4D11. GFP-NXP-2-(589–689) and GFP-NXP-2-(688–939) distributed throughout the whole cell and did not accumulate in the nucleus. An intense speckle-like staining was found in some of the transfectants (Fig. 4B), which was confirmed to be distinct from the nucleolar pattern by phase-contrast microscopy and immunostaining. These results indicate that the nuclear localization signals are present in both regions 25–307 and 307–591 of NXP-2.Figure 4Localization of GFP-NXP-2 truncated proteins in transfected cells after in situ nuclear matrix treatment. HeLa cells were transfected with expression vectors of GFP-NXP-2 deletion mutants (listed in Fig. 3) by electroporation. After 16 h, cells were subjected to in situ nuclear matrix treatment with or without RNase inhibitor, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The distribution of GFP fluorescence in untreated cells, nuclear matrix treated with RNase inhibitor, and nuclear matrix treated with RNase A in the absence of RNase inhibitor is shown for GFP-NXP-2-(25–939) (B, D, and F), GFP-NXP-2-(25–307) (G−I), GFP-NXP-2-(307–591) (J−L), GFP-NLS-NXP-2-(589–689) (M−O), GFP-NLS-NXP-2-(688–939) (P−R), and GFP-NLS-NXP-2-(326–353) (T, V, and X), respectively.

Bar, 40 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The transfected cells expressing GFP chimeras were subsequently subjected to nuclear matrix treatment to examine the nuclear matrix association of the NXP-2 mutants (Fig. 4). A considerable number of cells retained fluorescence in the nucleus after nuclear matrix treatment in the case of GFP-NXP-2-(25–939), GFP-NLS-NXP-2-(25–307), GFP-NLS-NXP-2-(307–591), and GFP-NLS-NXP-2-(688–939) (Fig. 4,D, H, K, and Q). Fig. 4H shows intense GFP foci, in contrast to the nucleolar pattern obtained by phase-contrast microscopy. The distribution to the nuclear matrix was abolished by extraction in the presence of RNase (Fig. 4, F, I, L, and R). GFP-NLS-NXP-2-(589–689) was not detected in the nuclear matrix under either set of conditions (Fig. 4, N and O). To determine the region contributing to localization to the nuclear matrix, the distribution was quantified by comparing the number of cells retaining GFP in the nucleus and nuclear matrix. GFP-NXP-2-(307–591) was localized to the nuclear matrix at a higher frequency than other mutants (Fig. 5A). To further narrow down the region of nuclear matrix binding, even smaller truncated mutants were generated from pGFP-NXP-2-(307–591). GFP-NXP-2-(500–591) was translocated to the nucleus, but GFP-NXP-2-(326–500), GFP-NXP-2-(326–353), and GFP-NXP-2-(352–500) were not. When these truncated sequences were attached with NLS, GFP-NLS-NXP-2-(326–500) and GFP-NLS-NXP-2-(326–353) were associated with the nuclear matrix (Fig. 5B). GFP-NLS-NXP-2-(326–353) remained in the matrix even in the presence of RNase, indicating that this region of NXP-2 associates with the nuclear matrix via protein-protein, but not protein-RNA, interaction. On the other hand, GFP-NLS-NXP-2-(326–500) was released from the nuclear matrix by RNase treatment, suggesting that the region for binding was masked in the large segment of NXP-2-(326–500). These results indicate that the domains of NXP-2 for nuclear localization and for nuclear matrix attachment are functionally distinct. The above-mentioned results showed that NXP-2 is associated with the nuclear matrix, depending on RNA. Hence, we were prompted to assess the RNA binding activity of human NXP-2. For this purpose, GST fusion proteins of nearly full-length and various truncated NXP-2 proteins were expressed in E. coli and used for in vitroRNA binding assays (Fig. 6). When the expressed proteins were soluble (GST-NXP-2-(25–939) and GST-NXP-2-(307–591)), they were purified with a glutathione-Sepharose column. When the proteins were insoluble, whole insoluble fractions from crude bacterial extracts were dissolved in SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 7A). The GST fusion proteins represented a major protein product of the bacterial extract, with the exception of the nearly full-length GST-NXP-2-(25–939) protein, which was found to be unstable and was usually degraded severely.Figure 7Northwestern blot analysis of NXP-2 deletion mutants.

The positions of the arrow, white open circle, and open square in F are identical to those of hnRNPA1, NXP-2-(307–591), and NXP-2-(500–591), respectively, as revealed by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) GST-NXP-2-(307–591) specifically bound to poly(A), poly(A,U), and poly(A,G,U) (Fig. 7, B−D). The construct also bound to poly(U) and poly(G), but not to poly(C) or poly(C,U) RNA polymers (data not shown). The other four constructs, as well as GST itself, did not show a significant association with RNA polymers. Thus, NXP-2 indeed binds to RNA, and the process is mediated by the central domain. Preferences for RNA sequences were also apparent. To further narrow down the RNA binding region in the NXP-2 central domain, three more truncated mutants, NXP-2-(307–326), NXP-2-(326–500), and NXP-2-(500–591), were subjected to the binding assay. Only NXP-2-(500–591) bound to poly(A,G,U) RNA polymers (Fig. 7F). In an attempt to identify nuclear matrix components of the cell nucleus, nuclear matrix fractions were prepared from rat liver nuclei and used as immunogens to generate monoclonal antibodies (26Sadano H. Sugimoto H. Sakai F. Nomura N. Osumi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). One such antibody (4D11) was used to screen a human placenta λgt11 cDNA expression library. The obtained clone, KIAA0136, was deduced to encode a protein of 939 amino acids designated NXP-2 in this study. Based on Northern blot analysis, NXP-2 is expressed in several tissues, skeletal muscle, placenta, and heart but is undetectable in kidney. It is unlikely to be a constitutive factor for the maintenance of general RNA metabolism. The biological function of NXP-2 is presently unknown. The nuclear staining of NXP-2 detected by the anti-NXP-2 antibody 4D11 was diffuse and remained after nuclear matrix treatment. We also found that exogenously expressed NXP-2 was tightly associated with the nuclear matrix because detergent, DNase, and high salt treatment of the nucleus did not release it from the matrix. Binding of NXP-2 to the nuclear matrix was diminished after RNase treatment, indicating that attachment to the matrix was dependent on RNA. We showed in this study that the nuclear matrix targeting of NXP-2 is mediated by its central domain (amino acid residues 307–591), which is dependent on the presence of nuclear RNA. This region was further analyzed with truncated mutants. A region for nuclear matrix binding independent of RNA was found at amino acid residues 326–353. This region contains a cluster of highly hydrophobic amino acids, MGVGVVGII (Fig. 8). A hydrophobic sequence responsible for nuclear matrix binding was also reported in the nuclear matrix targeting signal of acute myeloleukemia protein (32Zeng C.M. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Meyers S. Sun W.H. Shopland L. Lawrence J.B. Penman S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Hiebert S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6746-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 33Tang L. Guo B. Javed A. Choi J.Y. Hiebert S. Lian J.B. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Zhou G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33580-33586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The central region of the nuclear matrix targeting signal of acute myeloleukemia protein is V(T/S)SGIGIGMS, which is conserved among several vertebrate species. Such hydrophobic motifs were not reported for other nuclear matrix targeting signals, although a number of nuclear matrix targeting signals have been identified in diverse proteins (34McNeil S. Guo B. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Bushmeyer S. Seto E. Atchison M.L. Penman S. van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 500-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35DeFranco D.B. Guerrero J. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 2000; 10: 39-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We reported in this study that NXP-2 is an RNA-binding protein. hnRNPA1, a typical RNA-binding protein, binds to poly(A), poly(U), poly(G), poly(C), poly(A,U), and poly(A,U,G). On the other hand, NXP-2 binds to ribonucleotide homopolymers, with a preference for poly(U), but not to poly(C), in contrast to hnRNPA1. Nuclear hnRNPC binds to poly(U), but not to poly(A) or poly(C) (36Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2237-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, NXP-2 is a unique mammalian nuclear protein that is expressed in specific tissues and has specific RNA binding. hnRNPA1 is known to be a nuclear matrix protein responsible for stabilization of mRNA, suggesting that the binding to the nuclear matrix plays a part in the stabilization process (37Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3519-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The finding that NXP-2 is also able to bind the nuclear matrix supports the hypothesis that this type of RNA-binding protein may have roles in the control of posttranscriptional processes through RNA binding as reported for most of the hnRNPs. Binding to a mixed polymer containing A, G, and U was mediated by region 500–591, but not by region 307–326 or 326–500. The binding of region 307–591 to poly(A,G,U) was more intense than that of region 500–591. These results suggest that the peptide is too small to fold the entire active structure on the blotting membrane or that region 307–500 facilitates the RNA binding activity of region 500–591. The RNA binding and nuclear matrix binding functions appear to be distinct because different regions were responsible for the activities. It is unclear at present how nuclear RNA regulates nuclear matrix binding of NXP-2 in vivo. To follow up the biological function of NXP-2, it will now be essential to identify its in vivo RNA targets. Furthermore, it is also required to determine with what types of nuclear matrix proteins and RNA-binding proteins NXP-2 interacts in vivo to form a functional RNA-protein complex. Various structural studies on a number of known RNA-binding proteins and splicing factors have identified several functional domains responsible for the interaction with RNA or proteins. One highly conserved domain (RBD, RRM, or RNP-CS) has been intensively studied as an independent functional motif for specific RNA binding (38Zuo P. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4727-4737Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 39Caceres J.F. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4715-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 40Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 41Tacke R. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Another conserved domain, the RGG box, has initially been identified as a RNA-binding domain of hnRNP-U. KH domains, first identified in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K, have several repeats of G XXG consensus sequences (42Gibson T.J. Rice P.M. Thompson J.D. Heringa J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 331-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 43Siomi H. Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1193-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The central region 500–591 of NXP-2, which we have demonstrated to be required for RNA binding (Fig. 8), has no such domains and motifs. Region 500–591 contains three sets of serine dipeptide and arginine dipeptide sequences, two RRLS sequences, and one RRHLS sequence. An acidic amino acid-rich sequence is located at positions 571–582. Computer analysis with an algorithm developed by Lupas et al. (28Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3466) Google Scholar) showed the existence of a coiled-coil domain between amino acid residues 682 and 876 (Fig. 8D). Coiled-coil structures are found in some structural proteins, e.g. myosin, and in some leucine zipper DNA-binding proteins. Several nuclear matrix proteins, including lamin and nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA), contain coiled-coil structures that consist of a central rod domain flanked by globular terminal domains. The RNA-dependent attachment to the nuclear matrix suggests the possibility that the association of NXP-2 with the core filaments of the nuclear matrix is mediated by RNA. Nuclear matrix core filaments have been visualized by electron microscopy. It was assumed that the filaments were associated with various RNA-binding proteins, but their actual protein compositions are unknown (8Nickerson, J. (2001) J. Cell Sci. 463–474Google Scholar, 44Tan J.H. Wooley J.C. LeStourgeon W.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1547-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Further study will be required to determine if other members of the large family of RNA-binding proteins are constituents of nuclear matrix.

Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 206-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Animal proteoglycans contain glycosaminoglycan chains that fall into a number of categories as follows: chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, heparin, heparan sulfate, and keratan sulfate which consist of sulfated disaccharide repeats linked to a core protein via a glycan (2Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). The first four categories have a glycan core of GlcAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xyl O-linked to the protein, whereas keratan sulfates are attached through typical N- orO-glycans. In plants, arabinogalactans are the functional equivalent (3Majewska-Sawka A. Nothnagel E.A. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The significance of proteoglycans is shown, for instance, by the correlation of mutations in genes encoding proteoglycan biosynthesizing enzymes with a disease of bone formation (hereditary multiple exostoses) in man (4Duncan G. McCormick C. Tufaro F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) or with defects in vulval formation in nematodes (5Bulik D.A. Wei G. Toyoda H.

As a genetic model animal, Drosophila is an obvious target for exploring the roles of proteoglycans in various aspects of development (7Selleck S.B. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and from recent studies it appears that, in the fly, proteoglycans are involved in the diffusion and recognition of growth factors such as Wingless (a Wnt homologue), Decapentaplegic (Dpp), Hedgehog (Hh), and fibroblast growth factor. Specifically, mutants of the dally, sugarless, tout-velu, and sulfateless genes are defective in signaling of one or more of these four growth factors. By homology to mammalian proteins, it has been postulated that dally encodes a proteoglycan core protein (8Lin X. Perrimon N.

In addition to Sulfateless, a number of fly homologues of mammalian proteoglycan-modifying sulfotransferases have been shown to have roles during development. Whereas heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase is necessary for primary branching of the tracheal system (14Kamimura K. Fujise M. Villa F. Izumi S. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Nakato H. J. Biol.

Ganetzky B. Genetics. 1991; 129: 133-144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the growing body of genetic information related to proteoglycans in the fly, there remain large gaps in the biochemical knowledge. It is, therefore, appropriate to verify the activity of relevant Drosophila enzymes and not just rely on homologies to determine function. In particular, the enzyme in fly that initiates the formation of those glycosaminoglycan chains with anO-linked xylose core has not yet been the target of any investigation, other than a single report (19Cambiazo V. Inestrosa N.C. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Comp. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 97: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) on the effect on fly larvae locomotory behavior of a competitive inhibitor of xylosylation. In vertebrates, this reaction is catalyzed by peptideO-xylosyltransferase, which utilizes UDP-xylose as the donor for a reaction in which the hydroxyl groups of serine residues of proteoglycan core proteins become modified. Despite reports around 30 years ago on the purification of the chicken cartilage enzyme (20Schwartz N.B. Rodén L. Carbohydr. Res. 1974; 37: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the first peptide sequences derived from a purified form of a xylosyltransferase were only recently published (21Kuhn J. Götting C. Schnölzer M. Kempf T. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4940-4947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This information allowed the cloning of two human cDNAs, one of which was demonstrated to encode an active xylosyltransferase (22Götting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In the present report, I describe the identification of the apparently single fly peptide O-xylosyltransferase (OXT)1 and its successful functional expression in Pichia pastoris. The GenBankTM data base was searched using the tBLASTn program using the sequences of mammalian proteoglycan xylosyltransferases I and II (22Götting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In Drosophila melanogaster, a gene (CG17771) was identified and the predicted sequence used to search the dbEST data base. Portions of the predicted reading frame of 876 residues showed identity with a number of Drosophila ESTs or partial cDNAs from embyro, head, larvae/early pupae, imaginal discs, testes, and Schneider L2 cells. One of these EST sequences (Drosophila gene collection clone LD43716) was identical to the 5′-end of the oxt gene, and because it was considered to be potentially part of a full-length cDNA, this cDNA was obtained from Research Genetics. Sequencing of the clone was completed using the BigDye system (PE Biosystems) using both fly- and vector-specific primers. Comparison of protein sequences was performed using either BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) or Multalin (prodes.toulouse.inra.fr) software. A fragment encoding the putative soluble form of the proteoglycanO-xylosyltransferase (i.e. lacking the putative transmembrane domain) was amplified from the clone using Expand DNA polymerase mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), the primers DMXT3/EcoRI 5′-ccggaattccctggacatcgtagg-3′ and DMXT2/KpnI/Stop 5′-cggggtacctcatttgagcagggcatc-3′, and an Eppendorf MasterCycler PCR machine (3 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 1 min at 60 °C, 3 min at 72 °C, and 1 min at 95 °C, followed by a final extension step of 8 min at 72 °C). PCR products were purified after gel electrophoresis using the Qiagen PCR purification kit and digested with EcoRI and KpnI, gel-purified, and ligated into the pICZαC vector (Invitrogen) cut with the same enzymes. Expression vector DNA (∼10 μg) from PCR-positive Escherichia coli clones was cut withMssI prior to electroporation into P. pastorisGS115 cells. Positive yeast clones were identified after PCR of genomic DNA using gene-specific primers. For the screening of oxt clones, expression of recombinant xylosyltransferase was induced by methanol basically as described previously for Drosophilafucosyltransferases (23Fabini G. Freilinger A. Altmann F. Wilson I.B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28058-28067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Yeast clones were grown in 1 ml of MGYC (medium with glycerol, yeast nitrogen base, and casamino acids) overnight at 30 °C, washed with yeast nitrogen base, and resuspended in 10 ml of MMYC (medium with methanol, yeast nitrogen base, and casamino acids). Methanol (final volume 1%) was added every 24 h thereafter, and the medium was collected after 3 days of induction. The culture medium was concentrated 10-fold using Vivaspin concentrators (Mr 10,000 cut-off). UDP-xylose was synthesized enzymatically using the Cryptococcus neoformansUDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase. In brief, a pET-28a plasmid carrying the decarboxylase (UXS1) cDNA (a kind gift of Dr. Tamara Doering) was used to transform E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. After induction using isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the cells were harvested and lysed as described (24Bar-Peled M. Griffith C.L. Doering T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12003-12008Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To generate UDP-xylose, 10 μl of soluble bacterial protein extract was incubated overnight with 250 nmol of UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA) and 125 nmol of NAD+in Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, buffer in a total volume of 50 μl at 37 °C. HPLC analyses indicated that UDP-GlcA was quantitatively converted to UDP-Xyl under these conditions. For the acceptor, a peptide based on part of the sequence ofDrosophila syndecan, a proteoglycan core protein homologous to a family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (25Spring J. Paine-Saunders S.E. Hynes R.O. Bernfield M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3334-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), was designed. The standard assay for xylosyltransferase activities was performed at 37 °C with this synthetic peptide, DDDSIEGSGGR (Thermo Hybaid, Ulm, Germany); 1 μl of enzyme solution was added to 5 μl of 1 mm acceptor, 1 μl of 0.4 m MES, pH 7, 0.5 μl of 0.2 m MnCl2, and 2.5 μl of the aforementoned decarboxylase reaction. After various time points, 0.5 μl of the reaction mixture was withdrawn and diluted 10-fold with water. 0.8 μl of diluted sample was then mixed with 0.8 μl of 1% (w/v) α-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid in 70% (v/v) acetonitrile and allowed to dry on a sample plate prior to MALDI-TOF MS analysis on a ThermoBioanalysis Dynamo spectrometer in delayed extraction mode. Percentage conversion was calculated on the basis of the ratio of relative peak areas. For the determinations of the donorKm value, UDP-Xyl was purchased from a newly available supplier (CarboSource Services). Kinetic data were analyzed using Hanes plots. Xylosyltransferase incubation mixtures were fractionated by RP-HPLC (Hypersil). The program used is as follows: 0–2 min, 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water; 2–6 min, linear gradient to 11.2% (v/v) acetonitrile; 6–16 min, linear gradient to 14% (v/v) acetonitrile followed by washing of the column with up to 42% acetonitrile before returning to the original solvent. Peaks were collected which had either the same elution time as the original syndecan peptide or corresponded to a peak of slightly shorter elution time that was found only in incubations to which UDP-GlcA (the UDP-Xyl precursor) had been added. The collected fractions were dried and redissolved in 10 μl of water prior to amino acid analysis (for quantitation) and MALDI-TOF MS. In addition, aliquots of the purified xylosylated peptide were treated for 1 h with methylamine in the vapor phase as described recently (26Mirgorodskaya E. Hassan H. Clausen H. Roepstorff P. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) for peptides substituted with O-linked GalNAc or digested with endoproteinase Glu-C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8 (1 nmol of peptide with 0.5 μg of protease in a 10-μl final volume with 0.2-μl aliquots removed after 0.5, 2.5, 6, and 24 h at 37 °C). Searching of the Drosophila genome indicated the presence of one gene (CG17771) encoding a protein xylosyltransferase, in contrast to mammals (human, mouse, and rat) which appear to have two such genes (22Götting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The deduced protein sequence (see Fig. 1) of the fly xylosyltransferase displays, if one excludes the first 77 residues (i.e. the probable cytosolic, transmembrane, and stem regions), 36 and 37% identity with the corresponding parts of human xylosyltransferases I and II, respectively. The predicted unprocessed molecular weight (Mr 99,097) of fly OXT is similar to that of the human proteins, whereas of the five possibleN-glycosylation sites, only the third and the fourth are conserved as compared with the human, mouse, and rat sequences. By identity of portions of the oxt cDNA with various ESTs, it can be deduced that the gene is widely expressed in the fly with EST clones having been isolated from adult head (4 ESTs), adult testes (1 EST), embryo (15 ESTs), and larvae/early pupae (1 EST). The complete cDNA sequence also indicated that the annotation of the Drosophila genome sequence (EBI accession no.AE003474) was correct with three exons following the usual :GU … AG: rule. In contrast the human xylosyltransferase II gene (AC004707) has 11 exons, whereas the incompletely sequenced human xylosyltransferase I gene (AC021115 and AC106769) has at least 11; furthermore, all identified splice sites are conserved within these two human genes. In addition, as judged from analysis of sequences from the relevant genomes, the same genomic structure appears to be present and also valid for the rat xylosyltransferase I and II genes (AC103474 andAC103440), the murine xylosyltransferase II gene (AL645764), and an estimated two pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis) xylosyltransferase genes. On the other hand, only the second flyoxt exon/intron junction (nucleotides 852–853) corresponds to splice sites within vertebrate xylosyltransferase genes. O-Xylosylation of peptides is apparently animal-specific, and probable proteoglycan xylosyltransferases are present, as judged by analysis of the genomic and EST databases, in fish (T. nigroviridis and Oryzias latipes), amphibians (Xenopus laevis and Silurana tropicalis), birds (Gallus gallus), mammals (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Bos taurus, and Sus scrofa), ascidians (Halocynthia roretzi and Ciona intestinalis), insects (D. melanogaster and Apis mellifera), and Caenorhabditis elegans. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly from the functional viewpoint, however, is the homology of proteoglycan O-xylosyltransferases to mammalian core 2 and I β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases, which transfer GlcNAc to either the GalNAc of Galβ1,3GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr or internal Gal residues of Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc sequences, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, an ∼300 amino acid stretch corresponding to residues 250–552 (of 876) of the fly OXT and 123–428 (of 428) of the human core 2 GnT1 sequence shows ∼30% identity. It is interesting to note, however, that the cysteine residues conserved in the human core 2/I enzymes (27Schwientek T. Yeh J.C. Levery S.B. Keck B. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Fukuda M. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11106-11113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) are generally absent from the xylosyltransferases suggesting differences in the folding of these domains between the subfamilies. There are also differences in the genomic structure of OXT and core 2/I genes; as mentioned above, the human xylosyltransferase II reading frame is encoded by 11 exons, with the human core 2 genes each contain one coding exon (27Schwientek T. Yeh J.C. Levery S.B. Keck B. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Fukuda M. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11106-11113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The reading frame of the human I enzyme, however, stretches across three exons (28Bierhuizen M.F. Maemura K. Kudo S. Fukuda M. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), with one of these splice sites corresponding to a splice site in the human xylosyltransferase genes. This region of homology is also shared with the 6 C. elegansGLY-1 subfamily, a further 12 Caenorhabditissequences, many plant sequences, and 1 sequence from Caulobacter crescentus. Apart from GLY-1 itself, which has been shown to be a β1,6-glucosyltransferase capable of modifyingO-linked Galβ1,3GalNAc (29Warren C.E. Krizus A. Partridge E.A. Dennis J.W. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: G8-G9Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), no known function is as yet assigned to any of the nematode, plant, or bacterial sequences (30Warren C.E. Krizus A. Dennis J.W. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). GLY-1-type sequences are indeed more closely related to the core 2 O-glycan elongating enzymes, as shown by the presence of all but one of the conserved core 2/I cysteine residues, but in contrast to the one or three coding exons of the mammalian core 2/I genes, five of the gly-1-type genes are encoded by eight exons. Reflecting the similarities, the phylogenetic tree presented in Fig. 3 would suggest that the core 2/I/OXT glycosyltransferase family consists of two major halves as follows: one containing the plant, bacterial, and OXT members, and the other with the core 2/I/GLY-1 members. The C-terminal 300 residues of xylosyltransferases, however, are novel and contain the only DXD-type motif that is conserved between the fly and mammalian OXTs. To be exact, the fly sequence has a DFD sequence where the corresponding mammalian sequences are DWD in xylosyltransferases I and (D/E)WD in xylosyltransferases II. The presence of this motif, noted in many glycosyltransferases, in the region absent from other members of the core 2/I/OXT glycosyltransferase family may be compatible with the fact that OXTs are cation-sensitive (see below), whereas Warren et al. (30Warren C.E. Krizus A. Dennis J.W. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) noted that core 2/I enzymes are cation-independent and have no DXD motif. A soluble form of fly OXT was expressed under control of the AOX1 alcohol oxidase promoter in P. pastoris as a fusion protein with the α-mating factor secretion signal. By using a novel mass spectrometric coupled assay method, a number of yeast clones were screened for secreted xylosyltransferase activity. As acceptor, a peptide (DDDSIEGSGGR) corresponding to residues 55–65 of Drosophila syndecan (25Spring J. Paine-Saunders S.E. Hynes R.O. Bernfield M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3334-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was used, which contains the features of an acidic region and a Ser-Gly sequence found around chondroitin and heparan sulfate attachment sites (31Esko J.D. Zhang L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 32Brinkmann T. Weilke C. Kleesiek K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11171-11175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), as well as an arginine residue which apparently aids detection by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (33Krause E. Wenschuh H. Jungblut P.R. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 4160-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). For most experiments, the UDP-Xyl donor was synthesized, without subsequent purification, using recombinant Cryptococcus UDP-GlcA decarboxylase (24Bar-Peled M. Griffith C.L. Doering T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12003-12008Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A number of clones of Pichia transformed withoxt-containing constructs secreted active xylosyltransferase as judged by conversion of the syndecan peptide substrate to a form with an m/z ratio of 1239.9, the difference of 132.8 compared with the original peptide (m/z1107.1) approximating to the mass of a xylose residue (see Fig.4B). The percentage incorporation as determined by MALDI-TOF MS was time-dependent and comparable with, although consistently slightly lower than, that calculated from chromatogram peak areas of the same samples analyzed by RP-HPLC (Fig 4C). Despite the presence of two serine residues in the peptide, only a maximum of one xylose residue was transferred. No xylosylated peak was seen if UDP-GlcA (as UDP-xylose precursor; data not shown) was absent from the added UDP-GlcA decarboxylase incubation mixture nor when supernatants of Pichia expressing other glycosyltransferases were tested (e.g. tomato α1,4-fucosyltransferase; Fig.4A) in the presence of the E. coli extract. These data indicate a lack of endogenous OXT activity in bothPichia and E. coli. The activity of the enzyme was also verified using UDP-Xyl from a commercial source (data not shown), whereas no activity was detectable with other UDP-sugars tested. Respective Km values of ∼100 and 500 μm were determined for the donor and acceptor (Fig. 4, D and E); these values can be compared with those found (180 for UDP-Xyl and 60–790 μm for various peptide substrates) for partially purified rat chondrosarcoma xylosyltransferase (34Kearns A.E. Campbell S.C. Westley J. Schwartz N.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7477-7483Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As judged by MALDI-TOF assays using unpurified enzyme, fly OXT is more active in the presence of 10 or 20 mm Ca(II), Mg(II), and Mn(II) ions than in the presence of 10 or 20 mm EDTA or of no added cations, whereas it is completely inhibited by 10 mm Ni(II) and Zn(II) (for an HPLC comparison of incubations with Mn(II) and Ni(II), see Fig. 5). These results can be compared with those for the rat ear cartilage xylosyltransferase, which indicated activation in the presence of Mn(II), Mg(II), and Ca(II), but inhibition by Zn(II) (35Pfeil U. Wenzel K.-W. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Similar to the rat enzyme was also the pH optimum of the fly OXT (in the range pH 7–8). In addition, whereas fly OXT was initially most active (i.e. over a few hours) at 37 °C, the highest activities overnight were determined after incubation at 30 °C or at room temperature (possibly due to stability of the enzyme in the crude supernatant). In contrast, virtually no activity was detectable at 16 °C. Reaction mixtures were subject to RP-HPLC to purify the putatively xylosylated peptide. Comparison of the chromatograms showed that only in samples to which both UDP-GlcA and “activating” cations (e.g. Mn(II)) had been added was there a new peak with a retention time 1 min earlier than the peak with the same retention time as the original syndecan peptide (Fig. 5). The relevant fractions were collected, and this new peak was verified to also contain a species ofm/z 1239.9 (Fig.6A). To analyze the HPLC-purified product further, vapor-phase β-elimination using methylamine, a method previously only used for the removal of O-linked GalNAc from peptides and involving replacement of the sugar on the serine by a methylamine group (26Mirgorodskaya E. Hassan H. Clausen H. Roepstorff P. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), was employed. As expected, treatment of the xylosylated peptide resulted in the expected mass increment of +13 as compared with the original non-xylosylated peptide and of −119 as compared with the xylosylated form (Fig. 6B). This is indicative of a single glycosylation event and suggests that this method should be applicable to the analysis of glycosaminoglycan attachment sites in general. Subsequent analysis of the peptide was directed at determining which of the two serine residues is xylosylated. Initially, MALDI-TOF analysis after mild acid hydrolysis of the methylamine-treated peptide was performed, but this method did not yield unambiguous data. It was then decided to exploit the presence of a single glutamate residue in the DDDSIEGSGGR substrate peptide by use of endoproteinase Glu-C to digest the xylosylated and unxylosylated forms. The samples were thereafter analyzed by MALDI-TOF in both positive and negative modes for the time-dependent appearance of species absent from incubations containing only the protease. A species ofm/z 565, compatible with being a xylosylated form of GSGGR and whose intensity increased with time as the amount of the original m/z 1240 species decreased, was found only with the xylosylated sample in positive mode. In addition, a species of m/z 433, possibly corresponding to the unmodified form of GSGGR, was consistently found to a more significant extent in the digest of the unxylosylated peptide than in that of the xylosylated peptide. The other theoretical product of the proteolysis incubations, DDDSIE, was not detected in positive or negative modes in either a xylosylated or an unxylosylated form. Although not absolutely ruling out some degree of xylosylation of the first serine in the substrate peptide in a manner mutually exclusive of xylosylation of the second serine, the presence of the m/z 565 ion suggests that the enzyme xylosylates the second serine; such a result was expected due to the data cited above showing that xylosylation tends to occur at Ser-Gly sequences (31Esko J.D. Zhang L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 32Brinkmann T. Weilke C. Kleesiek K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11171-11175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Kearns A.E. Campbell S.C. Westley J. Schwartz N.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7477-7483Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This conclusion is also supported by MS/MS experiments (performed on a ThermoFinnigan LCQ Deca XP Quadrupole Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer; data not shown) in which a y fragment ion (m/z 694.3) compatible with xylosylation of the second serine was detected; no ion corresponding to a theoretical fragment of a peptide xylosylated on the first serine was found. The proteoglycan xylosyltransferase from D. melanogaster is the first such enzyme from invertebrates to be functionally characterized in either recombinant or native form. It is also the first enzyme relevant to the biosynthesis of the GlcAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xyl-β-O-Ser core common to both chondroitin and heparan sulfates to be characterized from the fly. Although examples of the other core-synthesizing enzymes, i.e. galactosyltransferase I (β4GalTVII) (5Bulik D.A. Wei G. Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Waldrip W.R. Esko J.D. Robbins P.W. Selleck S.B.

For example, it is not known which of the three β1,4-galactosyltransferase homologues from fly acts as galactosyltransferase I and which may have roles in elongation of Fringe-modified O-fucosyl glycans, for example (40Chen J. Moloney D.J. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13716-13721Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Of enzymes required later in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycan chains in the fly, the activities of only the heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (14Kamimura K. Fujise M. Villa F. Izumi S. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Nakato H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17014-17021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the Sugarless UDP-Glc dehydrogenase (required for the biosynthesis of UDP-GlcA, the donor for glucuronyltransferases) (41Benevolenskaya E.V. Frolov M.V. Birchler J.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 260: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and DEXT3, a heparan sulfate-initiatingN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase encoded by thebotv gene (42Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J.-I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13659-13665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), have been determined in vitro. In two other cases, structural analysis of the glycosaminoglycans of relevant fly mutants (specifically tout-velu and sulfateless) allows the activity in vivo of homologues of mammalian enzymes to be inferred (43Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Seleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2269-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 44Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Fox B. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21856-21861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The key to the verification of the fly OXT as an active enzyme was the development of a coupled enzymatic assay. Due to a temporary lack of commercially available non-radioactive UDP-xylose, it was decided to exploit a fungal enzyme (UDP-GlcA decarboxylase) to generate the donor substrate. Also the use of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry allowed simultaneous product quantification and identification. By using this method it was possible to estimate a yield of secretedPichia-expressed fly xylosyltransferase of ∼1 unit/liter (assuming that 1 μl of 10-fold concentrated supernatant xylosylates around 1 nmol of peptide in 2 h). This is around 2000 times that determined, using a peptide substrate and only 1 μmUDP-[14C]Xyl, for the activity of the human xylosyltransferase I expressed in CHO-K1 cells (22Götting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Considering also that the expression in Pichia of fly OXT was not even optimized, it is to be expected that improvements on the relatively good yield can be achieved. The fly xylosyltransferase is therefore a realistic tool for generating sufficient xylosylated peptide for studying the effect of the growing glycosaminoglycan chain on the conformation of the core peptide and for the preparation of biological substrates suitable in assays of other enzymes involved in proteoglycan biosynthesis. Analysis of the sequences of peptide O-xylosyltransferases indicates that they belong to the same group of enzymes as the core 2 and I-synthesizing β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases. Although this homology was apparently not noted previously, an examination of the CAZy data base does show that the proteoglycan xylosyltransferases and core 2/I enzymes share a common membership of glycosyltransferase family 14. 2P. M. Coutinho and B. Henrissat, Carbohydrate-active enzymes server, afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/∼cazy/CAZY/index.html. The homology of these enzymes of rather contrasting specificities (both for acceptor and donor) indicates a rather flexible process of evolution within this protein family. Interestingly, OXT (whose gene, CG17771, is presently listed in Flybase as encoding a core 2/I-branching enzyme) is the only member of glycosyltransferase family 14 to be identifiable from searching of the Drosophila genome. This is in distinct contrast to mammals (at least two xylosyltransferases and at least 4 functional core 2/I genes) and Caenorhabditis (1 xylosyltransferase, 6 GLY-1 homologues, and 12 other core 2/I-like sequences). It obviously remains to be seen whether other insects and other non-nematode invertebrates also have only one xylosyltransferase and no core 2/I-like sequences. One would also assume from the apparent importance of proteoglycans thatoxt is an essential gene and that it would be of interest to perform experiments on this locus at a genetic level to explore the biological repercussions of the abolition of both heparan and chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis.

This dominant negative αs construct will be useful for determining interrelationships among distinct receptor-G protein interactions in a wide variety of cells and tissues. Stimulation of heterotrimeric G proteins by cell surface receptors activates signaling pathways that mediate specific responses to hormones and neurotransmitters. Cells express a wide variety of G protein-coupled receptors as well as numerous G protein α, β, and γ subunits. Many receptors can activate more than one type of G protein, and the G protein subunits can interact with many different types of receptors. The manner in which signaling specificity is maintained in the midst of this vast range of potential interactions is not well understood. This report investigates the interdependence of distinct signaling pathways activated by receptors with broad G protein specificities using a receptor-sequestering dominant negative G protein α subunit. Many potential mechanisms could establish that distinct receptor-G protein interactions will be independent of each other. Among these, one possibility is that specific receptor-G protein complexes localize to separate membrane compartments (1Neubig R.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 2Neubig R.R. Semin. Neurosci. 1998; 9: 189-197Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar).

J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2191-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) or covalent modifications such as phosphorylation (5Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar) may result in subpopulations of receptors and G proteins that have restricted access to each other. Although G proteins are often expressed at much higher levels than their receptors are (6Ostrom R.S. Post S.R. Insel P.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 407-412PubMed Google Scholar), there is evidence that different receptors utilize separate pools of G proteins (7Graeser D. Neubig R.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 434-443PubMed Google Scholar, 8Simmons M.A. Mather R.J. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2130-2134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative potential mechanism for isolating distinct receptor-G protein interactions is that receptors utilize separate regions for binding different G proteins. If this is the case, then multiple types of receptor-G protein interaction can occur simultaneously without affecting each other. Localization of G protein-binding sites have indicated that separate receptor regions may specify interactions with distinct G proteins (9Shyu J.F. Inoue D. Baron R. Horne W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31127-31134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 10Wade S.M. Lim W.K. Lan K.L. Chung D.A. Nanamori M. Neubig R.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1005-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Dominant negative G protein α subunits can test potential mechanisms for separating the distinct G protein interactions of broad specificity receptors. For instance, if interactions with different G proteins are localized to separate subcellular compartments and/or receptor regions, signaling from a receptor to one type of G protein α subunit will be blocked by a dominant negative version of that α subunit, whereas the other signaling pathways will be unperturbed. Alternatively, if each receptor has access to multiple types of G protein and these different G proteins can compete with each other for receptor binding, then a dominant negative α subunit will block all of the G protein signaling pathways activated by the receptor. Several dominant negative G protein α subunits have been developed previously, but they inhibit G protein signaling incompletely and therefore are not optimal for investigating receptor-G protein signaling pathways. One dominant negative αs mutant contains three substitutions that disrupt different α subunit functions, but it is extremely unstable (11Iiri T. Bell S.M. Baranski T.J. Fujita T. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which contributes to its inability to inhibit signaling completely (12Skoglund G. Hussain M.A. Holz G.G.

Xanthine-binding mutants of αo, α11, and α16 can inhibit signaling of specific G protein-coupled receptor families, but inhibition of receptor-mediated phospholipase C stimulation is incomplete (14Yu B.

Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1506-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This report describes the development of a highly effective dominant negative αs mutant that contains substitutions that alter distinct α subunit functions, each of which should stabilize the receptor-bound, nucleotide-free state of Gs. One set of mutations, located in the α3β5 loop region, specifically increases receptor affinity and decreases receptor-mediated activation without affecting nucleotide handling (17Grishina G. Berlot C.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1081-1092PubMed Google Scholar) and also disrupts activation of adenylyl cyclase (18Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). G226A increases affinity for βγ (19Miller R.T. Masters S.B. Sullivan K.A. Beiderman B. Bourne H.R.

Nature. 1994; 371: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Although A366S alone causes αs to be thermolabile, αs(α3β5/G226A/A366S), containing all three sets of mutations, is expressed at close to wild-type levels and blocks signaling from the luteinizing hormone receptor to Gs by up to 97%. The effects of αs(α3β5/G226A/A366S) on signaling by the calcitonin receptor to Gs and Gq are tested in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells. The results demonstrate that this dominant negative αs mutant can block multiple G protein signaling pathways, which indicates that each receptor has access to multiple types of G protein and that these G proteins can compete with each other for receptor binding. αs mutant constructs in the expression vector pcDNAI/Amp (Invitrogen) were generated from the rat αs cDNA (22Jones D.T. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14241-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing the EE epitope (23Grussenmeyer T. Scheidtmann K.H. Hutchinson M.A. Eckhart W. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7952-7954Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), which was generated by mutating αs residuesDYVPSD (residues 189–194) to EYMPTE. Mutations were generated by oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis using the Bio-Rad Muta-Gene kit except for those in the α3β5 region, which were produced by subcloning mutagenic oligodeoxynucleotide cassettes. Subcloning and mutagenesis procedures were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. HEK-293 cells (ATCC, CRL-1573) (106 per 60-mm dish) were transfected with plasmids as described in the figure legends using 10 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, the cells were replated in 24-well plates and labeled with either [3H]adenine or [3H]inositol. After an additional 24 h, intracellular cAMP levels in cells labeled with [3H]adenine and inositol phosphate levels in cells labeled with [3H]inositol were determined as described previously (24Medina R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24720-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). cAMP accumulation was measured in the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and in the presence or absence of agonist as indicated in the figure legends. Inositol phosphate formation was measured in the presence of 5 mm LiCl and in the presence or absence of agonist as indicated in the figure legends. The cells were cultured and assayed at 37 °C. To determine EC50 values for stimulation of cAMP or inositol phosphate formation, the observed activity was fitted to Equation 1,Y=b+(a−b)/(1+(X/c )d)Equation 1 where X is the concentration of agonist; Y is the observed cAMP or inositol phosphate formation; a is the cAMP or inositol phosphate formation observed in the absence of agonist; b is the maximum observed cAMP or inositol phosphate formation; c is the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of the agonist; and d is the slope factor. HEK-293 cells (6.25 × 106 per 150-mm dish) were transfected with 0.2 μg/106 cells of plasmid encoding the rat luteinizing hormone receptor in pCIS (25McFarland K.C. Sprengel R. Phillips H.S.

In each case, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with binding medium (20 mmHEPES-buffered minimal essential medium with Earle's salts without bicarbonate containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The medium was then removed and replaced with binding medium containing 0.062–15 nm125I-labeled hCG in the presence or absence of 0.44 μm unlabeled hCG or 0.030–15 nm125I-labeled sCT in the presence or absence of 1 μm unlabeled sCT. The cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized with 0.5 nNaOH. The samples were collected and counted in a gamma counter. human chorionic gonadotropin salmon calcitonin HEK-293 cells (6.25 × 106 per 150-mm dish) were transfected with 37.5 μg of plasmid using DEAE-dextran (28Ausubel, F.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24720-24727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 25 μg of membrane proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%), transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with a monoclonal antibody to the EE epitope (23Grussenmeyer T.

The antigen-antibody complexes were detected using an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody according to the ECL Western blotting protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Replacing five αs residues in the α3 helix and the α3β5 loop (29Sunahara R.K. Tesmer J.J.G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) with the homologous αi2 residues (N271K, K274D, R280K, T284D, and I285T) results in an αs construct, αs(α3β5), that exhibits increased affinity for and a decreased ability to be activated by the β2-adrenergic receptor (17Grishina G. Berlot C.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1081-1092PubMed Google Scholar). Independently, the mutations also disrupt activation of adenylyl cyclase by αs (18Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These properties suggested that αs(α3β5) might be able to sequester Gs-coupled receptors and exhibit dominant negative activity. Indeed, when αs(α3β5) was transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells that were co-transfected with plasmid encoding the luteinizing hormone receptor, cAMP accumulation in response to 20 ng/ml hCG was inhibited by 42% (S.E. = 3%,n = 3) (Fig. 1). With the goal of producing more effective dominant negative activity, additional mutations predicted to stabilize the receptor-G protein complex were introduced into αs in combination with the α3β5 substitutions. The effects of adding each of three mutations, G226A, E268A, and A366S, to αs(α3β5) were tested. When combined, these three mutations produce partial dominant negative activity in αs (11Iiri T. Bell S.M. Baranski T.J. Fujita T. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). G226A impairs activating conformational changes in switch II required for dissociation of αs from βγ (19Miller R.T. Masters S.B. Sullivan K.A. Beiderman B. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 712-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 20Lee E. Taussig R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1212-1218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E268A disrupts a salt bridge with Arg-231 that may stabilize the activated conformation of αs (30Iiri T. Farfel Z. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5656-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A366S elevates basal GDP release, causing αs to be constitutively activated and to spend more time in the empty state (21Iiri T. Herzmark P. Nakamoto J.M. Van Dop C. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). αs(G226A/E268A/A366S) inhibited cAMP accumulation in response to 20 ng/ml hCG by 69% (S.E. = 1%,n = 3) (Fig. 1). When introduced into αs(α3β5), both G226A and A366S produced increased dominant negative activity (Fig. 1). αs(α3β5/G226A) inhibited the cAMP response to 20 ng/ml hCG by 74% (S.E. = 2%, n = 3), whereas αs(α3β5/A366S) inhibited the response by 61% (S.E. = 2%, n = 3). In addition, αs(α3β5/A366S) increased basal cAMP stimulation, consistent with the elevating effect of A366S on GDP release (21Iiri T. Herzmark P. Nakamoto J.M. Van Dop C. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In contrast, αs(α3β5/E268A) exhibited the same dominant negative activity as αs(α3β5) did (Fig. 1). Combining the two mutations that increased the dominant negative activity of αs(α3β5), G226A and A366S, with the α3β5 substitutions resulted in a highly effective dominant negative αs construct that inhibited the cAMP accumulation response to 20 ng/ml hCG by 97% (S.E. = 0.2%, n = 3) (Fig. 1). No further increase in dominant negative activity resulted when the E268A substitution was added to αs(α3β5/G226A/A366S) (Fig. 1). The dominant negative αs mutants, αs(α3β5), αs(G226A/E268A/A366S), and αs(α3β5/G226A/A366S), decreased the effectiveness of signaling from the luteinizing hormone receptor to Gs both by increasing the EC50 value of the cAMP response to hCG and by decreasing the magnitude of cAMP responses to hCG (Fig. 2 and Table I). Compared with αs(α3β5) and αs(G226A/E268A/A366S), the effects of αs(α3β5/G226A/A366S) on both of these parameters were greater. These incremental effects of combining the α3β5, G226A, and A366S mutations are consistent with their independent sites and mechanisms of action.Table IEC50 values and percent inhibition of cAMP responses to hCG in HEK-293 cells expressing the luteinizing hormone receptor in the absence or presence of αs mutantsEC50Maximum % inhibition of response% inhibition of response to saturating stimulusng/mlVector17.4 ± 1.600αs(G226A/E268A/A366S)64.0 ± 0.677.7 ± 1.917.0 ± 6.6αs(α3β5)31.3 ± 5.257.7 ± 2.635.7 ± 3.5αs(α3β5/G226A/A366S)119.8 ± 6.497.0 ± 0.677.3 ± 0.3Values were determined in three experiments.

To investigate how altering the α3β5 loop region of αs produces dominant negative activity, the effects of smaller numbers of substitutions in this region were tested. Of the five αi2 homolog substitutions, two are located in the α3 helix (N271K and K274D) and three (R280K, T284D, and I285T) are in the α3β5 loop. Based on their location, only the loop residues are likely to interact directly with receptors (17Grishina G. Berlot C.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1081-1092PubMed Google Scholar). Separately testing the effects of substitutions in these two regions showed that the dominant negative effect is due predominantly to the substitutions in the α3β5 loop, rather than those in the α3 helix (Fig. 3). αs(R280K/T284D/I285T) was only slightly less effective as a dominant negative than αs(α3β5) was, whereas αs(N271K/K274D) exhibited the same basal and receptor-stimulated cAMP accumulation as αs did. Therefore, the dominant negative phenotype of αs(α3β5) appears to result from the alteration of a receptor contact site on αs. Individual substitutions of each of the α3β5 loop residues decreased receptor-mediated activation of αs but did not produce dominant negative activity (Fig. 3). αs(R280K) exhibited very little basal or receptor-stimulated activity, whereas the activities of αs(T284D) and αs(I285T) were decreased relative to that of αs. The dominant negative activity produced by simultaneously substituting the three residues may result from additive defects in receptor interaction or may involve conformational changes in the loop due to interactions among the mutated residues. A previously reported limitation of αs(G226A/E268A/A366S) is its instability (11Iiri T. Bell S.M. Baranski T.J. Fujita T. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), due to the A366S mutation, which increases the amount of time αsspends in the thermolabile nucleotide-free state (21Iiri T. Herzmark P. Nakamoto J.M. Van Dop C. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To determine whether the greater dominant negative activity of αs(α3β5/G226A/A366S) compared with αs(G226A/E268A/A366S) is due in part to a stabilizing effect of the α3β5 substitutions, the expression levels of these αs constructs in membranes of transfected HEK-293 cells were compared (Fig. 4). The expression level of αs(α3β5) was similar to that of αs, whereas that of αs(G226A/E268A/A366S) was much lower. The expression level of αs(α3β5/G226A/A366S) was reduced somewhat relative to that of αs(α3β5) and of αs but was much higher than that of αs(G226A/E268A/A366S). Thus, the α3β5 substitutions appear to counteract the destabilizing effect of A366S. To investigate how dominant negative αs activity affects the signaling pathways of Gs-coupled receptors that also interact with other G protein heterotrimers, signaling of the calcitonin receptor to Gs and Gq was monitored in the presence and absence of αs(α3β5/G226A/A366S). αs(α3β5/G226A/A366S) completely blocked αs-mediated cAMP accumulation in response to up to 0.48 nm sCT (Fig. 5A). Even at saturating amounts of sCT, this response was inhibited by 82.3% (S.E. = 0.3%, n = 3). αs(α3β5/G226A/A366S) increased the EC50for stimulation of cAMP accumulation by sCT by a factor of 10 (Table II). As shown previously (9Shyu J.F. Inoue D. Baron R. Horne W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31127-31134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 31Chabre O. Conklin B.R. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Wilson E. Ives H.E. Catanzariti L. Hemmings B.A. Bourne H.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 551-556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the calcitonin receptor coupled less efficiently to Gq than to Gs (Fig. 5 and Table II). In the presence of αs(α3β5/G226A/A366S), αq-dependent inositol phosphate formation in response to all doses of sCT was blocked entirely (Fig. 5B).Table IIEC50 values of responses to sCT in HEK-293 cells expressing the calcitonin receptor in the absence or presence of αs(α3β5/G226A/A366S)EC50(nM)cAMP accumulationIP formationVector0.49 ± 0.158.76 ± 0.90αs(α3β5/G226A/A366S)4.86 ± 0.97NA2-aNA, not applicable.EC50 values were determined in three experiments.

IP, inositol phosphate. The ability of a dominant negative αs mutant to block signaling from the calcitonin receptor to both Gs and Gq leads to two conclusions regarding calcitonin receptor-G protein signaling. First, each calcitonin receptor has access to both αs and αq in transfected HEK-293 cells, suggesting that these α subunits share a common pool of receptors. Second, αs can compete with αq for binding to the calcitonin receptor. Combining substitutions in three different regions of αs results in dominant negative αs activity that can inhibit signaling from Gs-coupled receptors by close to 100%. The substitutions affect distinct αsinteractions as follows: increasing receptor affinity, decreasing receptor-mediated activation, and decreasing activation of adenylyl cyclase (α3β5 substitutions), increasing affinity for βγ (G226A), or decreasing affinity for GDP (A366S). Together, these mutations appear to stabilize the nucleotide-free αβγ-receptor complex. The incremental increases in dominant negative activity that result from combining these mutations are consistent with their independent sites and mechanisms of action. Although the nucleotide-free state, which is increased by the A366S mutation, is inherently unstable, αs(α3β5/G226A/A366S) is expressed at a level close to that of wild-type αs. This is most likely because the increased receptor affinity caused by the α3β5 substitutions stabilizes the empty state, which has the highest receptor affinity (32De Lean A. Stadel M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α3β5 substitutions, on their own, do not affect the nucleotide handling properties of purified αs (17Grishina G. Berlot C.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1081-1092PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of dominant negative αs activity to block signaling of the calcitonin receptor to multiple G protein pathways suggests that, at least in HEK-293 cells, distinct receptor-G protein complexes are not strictly compartmentalized into separate membrane domains. However, some mechanisms for compartmentalizing distinct receptor-G protein signaling pathways might not be detected using a dominant negative αs mutant. For instance, association of receptor subpopulations with distinct βγ combinations could restrict potential α subunit interactions. Inactivation of specific G protein subunits using antisense (33Kleuss C. Hescheler J. Ewel C. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. Wittig B.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17365-17371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) strategies has demonstrated a remarkable specificity of interaction between receptors, αβγ combinations, and effectors. In particular, in HEK-293 cells, ribozyme-mediated suppression of γ7 specifically reduced expression of β1 and disrupted activation of Gs by β-adrenergic but not prostaglandin E1 receptors (38Wang Q. Mullah B. Hansen C. Asundi J. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26040-26048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Such βγ specificity requirements might be overcome by a dominant negative αs mutant with increased affinity for both receptors and βγ. In addition, although the ratio of Gsto its receptors in cells is generally ∼100:1 (6Ostrom R.S. Post S.R. Insel P.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 407-412PubMed Google Scholar), factors important for compartmentalization might become limiting when a dominant negative αs mutant is overexpressed. If this is so, then coexpressing potential compartmentalization factors with this αs mutant would be predicted to narrow the range of its inhibitory capacities. The effect of dominant negative αs activity on other G protein pathways may depend on the cell and/or receptor type. For instance, cell-specific factors such as the caveolins, which have been reported to interact preferentially with particular G protein subunits (3Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), may restrict the accessibility of G proteins to receptors. HEK-293 cells do not have caveoli, although β-adrenergic receptors and adenylyl cyclase V/VI localize to low buoyant density membrane domains in these cells (40Rybin V.O., Xu, X. Lisanti M.P. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41447-41457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In addition, membrane fractionation studies have provided evidence for microdomains in the plasma membranes of neuroblastoma cells (41Ott S. Costa T. Herz A. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and neutrophils (42Jesaitis A.J. Tolley J.O. Bokoch G.M. Allen R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2783-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that have differences in their G protein content, and polarized epithelial cells differentially sort G protein α subunits (43Stow J.L. Sabolic I. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F831-F840PubMed Google Scholar) and G protein-coupled receptors (44Saunders C. Keefer J.R. Kennedy A.P. Wells J.N. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 995-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to use the dominant negative αsmutant described here to sort out the potential role of intracellular compartmentalization in regulating G protein signaling pathways in a wide range of cells and tissues. The ability of a dominant negative αs mutant to inhibit signaling to Gq provides a molecular insight into receptor-G protein interactions in that it demonstrates that different types of G proteins can compete for binding to the calcitonin receptor. Previous studies of calcitonin receptor isoforms containing insertions or deletions identified distinct regions important for specific interactions but did not rule out mutually exclusive binding of different α subunits. The first intracellular loop (45Moore E.E. Kuestner R.E. Stroop S.D. Grant F.J. Matthewes S.L. Brady C.L. Sexton P.M. Findlay D.M. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31127-31134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) appear to be important for coupling of this receptor to αq but not αs. The ability of different G proteins to compete for receptor binding despite these differences in specificity requirements indicates that either there is overlap in the receptor binding sites for different α subunits or that binding of one type of α subunit to a receptor sterically or allosterically blocks the association of a different one. Competition between different G proteins for receptor binding raises the possibility that changes in the expression level of a particular G protein may affect other G protein signaling pathways as well. Alterations in G protein α subunit expression levels can take place on several time scales. Short term changes in the expression level of αs due to decreased stability of the activated state have been observed (48Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). More long term changes in the expression levels of αs (49Wang H.-Y. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and αi2 (50Watkins D.C. Johnson G.L. Malbon C.C. Science. 1992; 258: 1373-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) can occur during and play a role in development. In addition, pseudohypoparathyroidism is associated with decreased levels of functional αs(51Levine M.A. Downs R.W., Jr. Moses A.M. Breslau N.A. Marx S.J. Lasker R.D. Rizzoli R.E. Aurbach G.D. Spiegel A.M. Am. J. Med. 1983; 74: 545-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The dominant negative αs mutant described here will have many applications to the investigation of how receptor-G protein signaling is regulated. In cell types for which there is strong evidence of subcellular compartmentalization, such as neurons and polarized epithelia, it may inhibit receptor subpopulations and be useful for determining which proteins coexist in the same membrane microdomains. In addition, it can be used to investigate the role of receptor-G protein interactions in the targeting of these proteins. For instance, if receptors are involved in the targeting of G protein subunits, receptor sequestration by a dominant negative α subunit may alter the localization patterns of wild-type subunits. The localization patterns of dominant negative α subunits as well as those of wild-type G protein subunits and receptors can be studied using fusions of these proteins to green fluorescent protein (52Kallal L.

https://openalex.org/W1528713110,"hTid-1, a human DnaJ protein, is a novel cellular target for HTLV-1 Tax. Here, we show that hTid-1 represses NF-κB activity induced by Tax as well as other activators such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and Bcl10. hTid-1 specifically suppresses serine phosphorylation of IκBα by activated IκB kinase β (IKKβ), but the activities of other serine kinases including p38, ERK2, and JNK1 are not affected. The suppressive activity of hTid-1 on IKKβ requires a functional J domain that mediates association with heat shock proteins and results in prolonging the half-life of the NF-κB inhibitors IκBα and IκBβ. Collectively, our data suggest that hTid-1, in association with heat shock proteins, exerts a negative regulatory effect on the NF-κB activity induced by various extracellular and intracellular activators including HTLV-1 Tax. hTid-1, a human DnaJ protein, is a novel cellular target for HTLV-1 Tax.

In quiescent cells, the predominant form, a p50/p65 of the NF-κB heterodimer, is retained in the cytoplasm by interaction with its major cellular inhibitors IκBs (3Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K.

Activation of NF-κB, as induced by numerous extracellular stimuli, is initiated by phosphorylation of IκBs by IκB kinases and degradation of the phosphorylated inhibitors in proteasomes (5Chen Z.J.

NF-κB heterodimer freed from the NF-κB-IκB complex then enters the nucleus for binding to the κB cis-element to induce expression of the target genes. In addition to extracellular stimulation by proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and interlukin-1 (6Kopp E.B. Ghosh S. Adv.

Recent discoveries indicate that the downstream events of multiple stimuli of the NF-κB signaling pathway converge at a 700-kDa IκB kinase complex that is composed of at least three subunits: IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ (5Chen Z.J.

IKKβ exhibits a high intrinsic kinase activity and is the major kinase that mediates specific serine phosphorylation of IκBs at their N termini.

Through modulation of IKKγ, the kinase activity of IκB kinases, particularly IKKβ, is significantly enhanced, leading to subsequent phosphorylation and degradation of IκBs and release of NF-κB for translocation into the nucleus. We previously reported on the identification of a novel Tax-interacting cellular partner hTid-1, a human DnaJ chaperone protein (32Cheng H. Cenciarelli C. Shao Z. Vidal M. Parks W.P. Pagano M. Cheng-Mayer C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1771-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The 52-kDa protein shares strong homology with the Drosophila tumor suppressor protein Tid56 (33Schilling B., De- Medina T. Syken J. Vidal M. Munger K.

Parks W.P. Pagano M. Cheng-Mayer C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1771-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In HEK cells, Tax associates with a molecular chaperone complex containing hTid-1 and Hsp70 and sequesters the complex in a cytoplasmic “hot spot” structure (32Cheng H. Cenciarelli C. Shao Z. Vidal M. Parks W.P. Pagano M. Cheng-Mayer C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1771-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As a first step toward understanding the functional significance of Tax/hTid-1 interaction, the effect of hTid-1 on the NF-κB signaling pathway was examined. Here, we report that hTid-1 antagonizes the activities of various NF-κB activators including Tax, TNFα, and Bcl10 by repressing IKKβ activity and enhancing the stability of the IκB molecules. HEK and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI medium with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Full-length DNA fragments coding for IKKα, IKKβ, Bcl10, p65 subunit of NF-κB, JNK1, p38, and ERK2 (GenBankTM accession numbers AF009225, AF029684, AF082283,M62399, L26318, L35253 and M84489, respectively) were obtained from a cDNA library derived from human lymph node (Edge BioSystems) using PCR with high fidelity pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and subsequently cloned into the pCEF vector with an N-terminal FLAG tag or a C-terminal HA tag. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to generate the dominant-negative mutants IKKαKM and IKKβKM (Lys was replaced by Met at amino acid 44) using the PCR method. Full-length IκBα and IκBβ genes (GenBankTM accession numbers U36277 and U19799, respectively) were amplified from a murine spleen mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR and were cloned in the pBEFneo vector with an HA tag at their C termini. The pCEF/hTid-1-FLAG, pCEF/hTid-1Δ HPD-FLAG, pCEF/hTid-1Δ Cys-FLAG, and pBEF/Tax-HA constructs had been described previously (32Cheng H. Cenciarelli C. Shao Z. Vidal M. Parks W.P. Pagano M. Cheng-Mayer C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1771-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the hTid-1 isoform used in this study is hTid-1L. The FLAG epitope tag from hTid-1 and its mutant constructs were also replaced with an AG tag that provided an alternative detection of the expressed protein. The AG tag, which can be recognized by the monoclonal antibody AG11 (kindly provided by James Hoxie), was generated to correspond to the nucleotide sequence encoding a C-terminal 10 amino acids (ELHPEYFKNC) of HIV-1 Nef. pNF-κB/SEAP was purchased from CLONTECH, and pNF-κBβ-gal was generated by replacing the SEAP fragment with a β-galactosidase fragment derived from pCIβ-gal. An N-terminal fragment of IκBα consisting of 54 amino acids was amplified by PCR and inserted into pGEX-2T to generate a pGST-IκBα (aa 1–54) construct for expression of the recombinant protein in Escherichia coli. Purification of GST-IκBα was performed according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Pharmacia). DNA transfection for HEK and COS-7 cells was performed with SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) and for Jurkat T cells with DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommended protocols. The transfected cells were harvested and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 plus phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm β-glycerol-phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mmNaF), and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Equal amounts of the cellular protein extracts were incubated with anti-IKKα/β (Santa Cruz, sc-7607) or with anti-FLAG for FLAG-tagged IKKβ for 4 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Invitrogen) and incubation at 4 °C for an additional 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed extensively (two times with the lysis buffer and two times with the kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2and 1 mm EDTA)) and resuspended in 15 μl of kinase buffer. 0.5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (AmershamBiosciences, no. PB-10218, 6000 Ci/mmol) and 5 μg of GST-IκBα (aa 1–54) were added to the beads and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. HEK cells were transiently transfected with p38-HA, ERK2-HA, or JNK1-HA with or without hTid-1-FLAG. 20 h posttransfection the cells were stimulated with anisomycin (5 μg/ml for activating p38), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 ng/ml, for activating ERK2), and TNFα (20 ng/ml for JNK1) for 30 min. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and rapidly lysed in buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS). Equal amounts of total cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using phospho-specific antibodies for pATF2, pERK, and pc-JUN (Santa Cruz, numbers sc-8398, sc-7383, and sc-822, respectively). β-galactosidase activity was measured using a standard color reaction with chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate. SEAP activity was analyzed using a chemiluminescence substrate (Tropix) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. To determine whether hTid-1 has an effect on Tax activation of NF-κB, transient co-transfection of Tax and hTid-1 together with the NF-κB β-galactosidase reporter construct was performed in both HEK and Jurkat T cells. Expression of Tax-HA promoted NF-κB β-galactosidase activity by at least 10-fold (data not shown). Consistent with a previous report that Tax-induced activation was mediated predominantly through IKKβ (28Yin M.J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.T., Xu, S. Mercurio F. Barbosa M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), activation of NF-κB-dependent β-galactosidase activity by Tax was inhibited potently by a dominant-negative mutant of IKKβ (IKKβKM) (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, neither IKKαKM, a dominant-negative mutant of IKKα, nor JNK1APF, a dominant-negative mutant of JNK1, had any suppressive effect on NF-κB activation by Tax. Co-expression of hTid-1 suppressed the NF-κB activation induced by Tax in both HEK and Jurkat T cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). The level of hTid-1 suppression paralleled that exhibited by IκBα, a cellular inhibitor of NF-κB (Fig. 1 B). As this suppressive activity was comparably seen in HEK and Jurkat T cells, the inhibitory effect of hTId-1 does not appear to be cell type-dependent. Furthermore, hTid-1 did not repress β-galactosidase or SEAP activities driven by housekeeping gene promoters such as the human elongation factor promoter (data not shown), suggesting that hTid-1 is not a general inhibitor of cellular gene transcription. NF-κB is also activated in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα. In HEK cells, hTid-1 repressed NF-κB activation induced by TNFα by 4-fold (Fig. 1 C). As controls, FLAG-IKKβKM and IκBα-HA potently suppressed the NF-κB-driven β-galactosidase activity, whereas JNK1APF had no effect (Fig. 1 C). Bcl10, a caspase recruitment domain-containing protein associated with TRAF2 (35Willis T.G. Jadayel D.M. Du M.Q. Peng H. Perry A.R. Abdul-Rauf M. Price H. Karran L. Majekodunmi O. Wlodarska I. Pan L.

Du M.Q. Peng H. Perry A.R. Abdul-Rauf M. Price H. Karran L. Majekodunmi O. Wlodarska I. Pan L. Crook T. Hamoudi R. Isaacson P.G. Dyer M.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The mechanism of Bcl10 activation of NF-κB remains unknown. However, because Bc10 is associated with the cytoplasmic membrane, it is likely to act relatively upstream in the NF-κB signaling pathway. We found that hTid-1-FLAG also suppressed Bcl10-induced NF-κB-dependent β-galactosidase activity by at least 5-fold (Fig. 1 D). The activation of NF-κB by Bcl10 was repressed by IκBα and FLAG-IKKβKM but not by FLAG-IKKαKM (Fig. 1 D), indicating an involvement of IKKβ activity. Taken together, the observation that hTid-1 suppressed NF-κB activation by both extracellular and intracellular activators suggests that hTid-1, a human DnaJ protein and a novel Tax-binding protein, is a general cellular inhibitor of the NF-κB signaling cascade. Although upstream stimuli of the NF-κB signaling cascade can differ, the transduction pathways all converge at the 700-kDa protein complex of IκB kinases (5Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Because Tax was reported to activate NF-κB by stimulating the IκB kinase activity (29Li X.H. Murphy K.M.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15891-15894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), an in vitro kinase assay was performed to determine whether hTid-1 has an inhibitory activity on the activation of IκB kinases by Tax. HEK cells were transiently transfected with Tax-HA alone or with various amounts of the hTid-1-FLAG construct. In vitro kinase assay was performed on IKKβ immunoprecipitates obtained from transfected cells using GST-IκBα (aa 1–54) as substrate. In the absence of hTid-1, specific phosphorylation of GST-IκBα (aa 1–54) was observed, indicative of an activation of IκB kinase activity by Tax (Fig. 2 A). Significantly, in the presence of hTid-1-FLAG, phosphorylation of GST-IκBα was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A). Because Tax was previously shown to activate the IκB kinase complex activity predominantly through IKKβ (28Yin M.J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.T., Xu, S. Mercurio F. Barbosa M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), a potential inhibitory effect of hTid-1 on the IKKβ subunit was further evaluated. Transient transfection of FLAG-IKKβ stimulated NF-κB-dependent β-galactosidase activity at least 10-fold. In the presence of hTid-1-FLAG, an inhibitory effect on the NF-κB-driven β-galactosidase activity induced by FLAG-IKKβ was observed (Fig. 2 B). Accordingly, in vitro kinase assay showed that hTid-1 suppressed the phosphorylation of GST-IκBα induced by the kinase-active FLAG-IKKβ in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2 C). Potential effects of hTid-1 on other serine kinases and signaling cascades were also examined. HEK cells were transiently transfected with p38-HA, ERK2-HA or JNK1-HA in the absence or presence of hTid-1-FLAG. Following transfection, the cells were stimulated with anisomycin (for p38), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (for ERK2), and TNFα (for JNK1) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Activation of the kinases or their downstream signaling events was assessed using phospho-specific antibodies that detect the activated kinases and their phosphorylated substrates. As shown in Fig. 2 D, phosphorylation of ATF2, a substrate for activated p38, was seen following stimulation by anisomycin and was not altered in the presence of hTid-1-FLAG (top panel). Similarly, phosphorylation of the ERK2 kinase or c-JUN, the substrate for the activated JNK1 kinase, was detected following stimulation by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and TNFα, respectively, and the extent of phosphorylation was not changed by co-expression of hTid-1-FLAG (middle and bottom panels). These results indicate that hTid-1 has no significant effects on the activities of p38, ERK2, and JNK1 kinases. Although hTid-1 also exhibited some degree of repression of IKKα kinase activity (data not shown), given the principal role of IKKβ in NF-κB signaling and its significant suppression by hTid-1, we conclude that hTid-1 is a novel cellular inhibitor of the NF-κB signaling cascade by targeting predominantly the IKKβ subunit. We previous showed that Tax associates with a molecular chaperone protein complex containing both hTid-1 and Hsp70, with Tax binding to a Cys-rich region of hTid-1 and the J domain of hTid-1 interacting with Hsp70 (32Cheng H.

To determine whether formation of the molecular chaperone complex is necessary for the inhibitory effect of hTid-1 on the IκB kinases, the activity of two hTid-1 mutants, hTid-1Δ HPD and hTid-1Δ Cys, were assessed. We found that a low level expression of hTid-1Δ HPD marginally inhibited NF-κB activation mediated by either Tax or IKKβ, whereas at a higher dose (1.2 μg of DNA) it regained some inhibitory activity but still at a significantly reduced level compared with the inhibition mediated by wild type hTid-1-FLAG (Fig. 3 A). Although the hTid-1Δ Cys mutant displayed an inhibitory activity on NF-κB activation induced by FLAG-IKKβ, it was less effective than the activity of wild type hTid-1. Consistent with findings in the NF-κB-dependent reporter assay system,in vitro kinase assay showed that compared with wild type hTid-1, hTid-1Δ Cys inhibited less potently the IKKβ kinase activity and that hTid-1Δ HPD was the least efficient of the three (Fig. 3 B). While hTid-1Δ Cysmaintained a full capacity for binding to Hsp70 (32Cheng H. Cenciarelli C. Shao Z. Vidal M. Parks W.P. Pagano M. Cheng-Mayer C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1771-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), hTid-1Δ HPD exhibited a reduced but not complete absence of binding activity. It is likely that overexpression of hTid-1Δ HPD could recruit a small amount of Hsp70 for formation of the molecular chaperone complex, which may explain the partial recovery of the suppressive activity of hTid-1Δ HPD at high doses. Indeed, we find that the hTid-1 mutant with complete deletion of the J domain disabled the repression of hTid-1 on NF-κB activity even at high doses (data not shown). Thus, it appears that the molecular chaperone complex formation is necessary for the inhibitory effect of hTid-1 on IKKβ. The observation that hTid-1 suppresses IκB phosphorylation by IKKβ implies that hTid-1 may have an indirect role in protecting the IκB molecules from degradation in proteasomes. We therefore determined whether hTid-1 has any effect on the stability of IκBα and IκBβ. IκBα-HA and IκBβ-HA were transfected into HEK cells. The transfected cells were treated with cycloheximide for 30 min followed by samplings at the indicated time points. As shown in Fig. 4, both IκBα and IκBβ decayed over time; the half-life of IκBα was about 1 h (top first panel), while that of IκBβ was less than 30 min (middle first panel). In the presence of hTid-1-FLAG however, the half-life of both IκBα and IκBβ appeared to be prolonged (top second and middle second panels). hTid-1-FLAG itself was stable over the 5-h period of observation. Thus, it appears that hTid-1, by inhibiting the kinase activity of IKKβ, provides a protective effect on IκBs degradation, enhancing the stability of both IκBα and IκBβ. hTid-1 is a novel human DnaJ protein whose functions in mammalian cells have not been fully characterized. Several reports indicate that hTid-1 regulates apoptotic and anti-apoptotic processes in response to TNFα stimulation (37Syken J., De- Medina T. Munger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8499-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and inhibits IFNγ-induced signaling by complexing with Jak2 kinase and repressing its activity (38Sarkar S. Pollack B.P. Lin K.T. Kotenko S.V. Cook J.R. Lewis A. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49034-49042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). An interaction of a murine homolog mTid-1 with RasGAP protein has also been observed, suggesting that mTid-1 may regulate the Ras signaling pathway (39Trentin G.A. Yin X. Tahir S. Lhoták S.

We show here that hTid-1 antagonizes NF-κB activity induced by various activators including HTLV-1 Tax, TNFα, and Bcl10 by repressing IKKβ kinase activity. The molecular mechanism(s) underlying the suppressive activity of hTid-1 on IKKβ remain undefined. Direct binding of hTid-1 to the NF-κB heterodimer is unlikely because hTid-1 does not contain ankyrin repeats that are found in IκBs. It is conceivable that hTid-1 forms a protein complex with the IκBs to prevent their specific phosphorylation by activated IκB kinases and subsequent degradation. Alternatively, the suppressive activity could be mediated through its association with Hsp70 and Hsc70 (32Cheng H. Cenciarelli C. Shao Z. Vidal M. Parks W.P. Pagano M. Cheng-Mayer C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1771-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 38Sarkar S. Pollack B.P. Lin K.T. Kotenko S.V. Cook J.R. Lewis A. Pestka S. J. Biol.

The finding that the functional J domain of hTid-1 is required for the suppressive activity on IKKβ supports this view. Hsp70 is an inducible protein whose expression is low under physiological conditions but can be induced under stress conditions such as heat shock, oxidation, and heavy metals. In contrast, Hsc70 is expressed constitutively even under non-stressful situation. Induction or activation of heat shock proteins has been reported to be associated with an inhibitory effect on NF-κB (40Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Indeed, we find that overexpression of an inducible Hsp70 inhibited NF-κB-dependent reporter activity and suppressed in vitro IKKβ kinase activity (data not shown). Activation of Hsp70 and Hsc70 as a result of complexing with hTid-1 under stressful and non-stressful conditions, respectively, therefore could lead to repression of the IκB kinase complex and inhibition of NF-κB activity. Tax, by forming a supercomplex with hTid-1 and Hsp70, may abrogate the inhibitory activity of hTid-1 as a part of its multimechanisms in induction of NF-κB activation. Regardless, the discovery of hTid-1 as a novel negative modulator of the IκB kinase complex provides additional insight into the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Further investigation of the suppressive mechanism of NF-κB by hTid-1 is warranted. We thank James P. Hoxie (University of Pennsylvania) for AG11 antibody."

To gain a better understanding of the mechanism of helicase assembly, the architecture and stoichiometry of the gp41-gp59 complex were investigated.

As the helicase is loaded onto DNA, a conformational change in the gp41-gp59 complex occurs, which may serve to displace gp32 from the lagging strand and load the hexameric helicase in its place. DNA replication is a multistaged reaction that requires the recruitment of proteins, assembly of replication forks at an origin, and template-directed replication of DNA. The replication machinery in the T4 bacteriophage is composed of three units, the primosome (a complex of the primase (gp61) bound to the helicase (gp41)), the holoenzyme (composed of a DNA polymerase (gp43), a sliding clamp (gp45), and a clamp loader (gp44/62)), and the single-stranded binding protein gp32. An initial event in the replication process is the recruitment and assembly of the primosome at the DNA replication fork. Formation of the primosome on the lagging strand most likely begins with assembly of the helicase. The bacteriophage T4 helicase plays an essential role in DNA replication and recombination during phage infection of Escherichia coli. The helicase is needed to unwind duplex DNA ahead of the holoenzyme to allow nucleotide incorporation during replication and is required to unwind duplex DNA for pairing of single-strand DNA with new partners in recombination (1Benkovic S.J. Valentine A.M. Salinas F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 181-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). gp41 forms a hexameric ring that encircles the lagging strand of the replication fork and unwinds the duplex in a 5′–3′ direction by hydrolyzing ATP (1Benkovic S.J. Valentine A.M. Salinas F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 181-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). During DNA replication, the gp41 helicase is intimately associated with the gp61 primase, which synthesizes the RNA primers used in discontinuous lagging strand synthesis. The formation of this primosome is needed for efficient unwinding of duplex DNA during replication as well as productive primer synthesis (2Dong F. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19625-19631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 3Hinton D.M. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10873-10878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Loading of the gp41 replicative helicase at the bacteriophage T4 DNA replication fork requires the displacement of single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (gp32) coating the lagging strand. The helicase assembly protein, gp59, is required to load the helicase under these conditions, thus assuming a critical role in bacteriophage T4 DNA replication as well as recombination (4Cunningham R.P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20198-20207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have suggested that the C-terminal, acidic domain (A-domain) of gp32 mediates the interaction between the two proteins. More recent studies have demonstrated that the DNA binding core domain of gp32 also interacts with gp59 (14Ishmael F.T. Alley S.C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25236-25242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and the combination of the two sites of interaction may be necessary for gp32 displacement. Furthermore, gp59 contains distinct sites for gp32 and gp41 binding (11Morrical S.W. Hempstead K. Morrical M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33069-33081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As such, the gp59-mediated assembly of gp41 onto gp32-coated DNA most likely involves a ternary complex between the three proteins. Although gp59 exists as a monomer in solution, it can oligomerize in the presence of gp32 or DNA. Cross-linking experiments demonstrated that gp59 could form at least pentamers in the presence of either of these molecules (14Ishmael F.T. Alley S.C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25236-25242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Raney et al. (15Raney K.D. Carver T.E. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14074-14081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) showed that the enhancement of the ATP-dependent DNA unwinding activity of gp41 was maximal when gp59 was present in a 1:1 molar ratio with gp41 (hexamer of gp59 to hexamer of gp41). As such, gp59 is expected to form higher multimeric states when bound to the helicase. In E. coli, the DnaB helicase is loaded onto DNA by a protein analogous to gp59, DnaC. Cryoelectron microscopy studies indicated that DnaC forms a hexameric ring associated with the hexameric DnaB ring (16San Martin C. Radermacher M. Wolpensinger B. Engel A. Miles C.S. Dixon N.E. Carazo J.M. Structure. 1998; 6: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy, we predict a similar oligomeric state and arrangement of gp59 and gp41. To gain a better understanding of the mechanism of helicase assembly, the architecture and stoichiometry of the gp41-gp59 complex was investigated. We have demonstrated that 1) both the N and C terminus of gp41 lie in the gp41-gp41 subunit interface and interact with gp59; 2) the site of interaction of gp41 on gp59 is close to Cys-215 of gp59; 3) conformational changes in the gp41-gp59 complex occur upon gp41 loading on DNA; and 4) gp59 forms a hexamer upon binding gp41, and the gp59 subunits are arranged in a head to head orientation. The importance of these findings is discussed herein. The 41 gene was isolated from bacteriophage T4 genomic DNA (Sigma) by PCR amplification using the primers 5′-GCGGAACATATGGTAGAAATTATTCTTTCT and 5′-GCGGAATTCGCTCTTCCGCAAAATTTTAATTC. The product was digested with NdeI and SapI and ligated into a custom IMPACT vector placed under the control of a T7 promoter. This vector places a self-cleaving intein and chitin binding domain at the C terminus of gp41 and allows purification of the protein on a chitin affinity column followed by cleavage of the intein with dithiothreitol (DTT; Sigma) to yield the unmodified gp41. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were electrotransformed with the plasmid, and transformants were selected with 50 μg/ml kanamycin on NCZYM (Invitrogen) agar plates. A single colony was grown in NCZYM medium to an A600 of 0.5 and induced for 18 h at 20 °C with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in chitin column buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA). The cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g, and the supernatant was applied to a 10-ml chitin column. The column was washed with 1 liter of chitin column buffer, and gp41 was cleaved from the column by the addition of 100 mm DTT dissolved in chitin column buffer for 24 h. The protein was eluted from the chitin column and subsequently diluted so that the NaCl concentration was 200 mm. It was then loaded at 0.5 ml/min onto a 15-ml P11 column (Whatman) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. gp41 does not bind to the column under these conditions and was collected in the flow-through fraction. The protein was concentrated to ∼10 μm with an Amicon stirred cell concentrator equipped with a YM30 membrane. For purification of gp41 with a C-terminal cysteine added (Cys-476, denoted as gp41c), the protein was cleaved from the chitin column with 100 mm cysteine dissolved in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA. The rest of the purification was as described above. The gp41 and gp41c proteins were dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol and stored at −70 °C. The gp41c, containing a C-terminal cysteine (Cys-476) was applied to a Sephadex G-25 column to remove reducing agents. The protein (100 μl of a 6 μm solution) was then mixed with 10 μl of thiol-reactive trifunctional cross-linker (Fig. 1A) dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF; 60 μmfinal concentration) for 14 h at 4 °C in the dark. Excess label was removed by applying the solution to a Sephadex G-25 column. gp41c and gp59 (in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) were mixed at a final concentration of 1 μm each, in the presence or absence of 3 mmATP and/or 5 nm M13mp18 single-stranded DNA. Cross-linking was initiated by exposure to ultraviolet light as described previously (17Alley S.C. Ishmael F.T. Jones A.D. Benkovic S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 6126-6127Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the samples where reduction of the cross-linker was desired, DTT was added to a final concentration of 100 mm. The products of the cross-linking experiment was separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to a Western blot using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (SA-HRP; Invitrogen) as a probe, as described previously (17Alley S.C. Ishmael F.T. Jones A.D. Benkovic S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 6126-6127Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Prestained broad range molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) were used to assess molecular weights of the species observed. gp41 was dialyzed into 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol. In the presence of 5 mmADP, pH 7.0, only the N terminus of gp41 is labeled upon the addition of an amine-reactive probe. gp41 (100 μl of a 6 μm solution) was mixed with 10 μl of sulfosuccinimide-2-[6-(biotinamido)-2-(p-azidobenzamido)hexanoamido]ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate (Sulfo-SBED; Fig. 1B) dissolved in DMF (10 μm final concentration) for 16 h at 4 °C in the dark. Excess label was removed with a Sephadex G-25 column. gp41 and gp59 were mixed to a final concentration of 1 μm each in the presence or absence of ATP and/or DNA as described above. The samples that required reduction of cross-linker were reduced with 100 mm DTT. The samples were analyzed by a Western blot using SA-HRP as a probe. To verify that only the N terminus of gp41 was labeled, helicase labeled with Sulfo-SBED was digested with trypsin and applied to a 100-μl streptavidin-agarose (Sigma) column. The column was washed with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl to remove unlabeled peptides. The labeled peptide bound to the column by virtue of the Sulfo-SBED label was then treated with 1 m2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min to cleave the disulfide bond in the cross-linker, thus eluting the peptide. The eluted peptide was dried in a speed vacuum, and the sample was desalted with a zip-tip pipette tip containing C-18 resin (Millipore Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The peptide was eluted from the zip-tip C-18 resin using 60% acetonitrile, 40% H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The isolated peptide (500 μl) was then mixed with 500 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (15 mg/ml dissolved in 50% acetonitrile, 50% water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), and the mixture was spotted and air-dried on a MALDI target plate. The sample was analyzed by a Voyager MALDI mass spectrometer (Perseptive) in linear mode to confirm that only the N terminus was labeled. Positive ions were detected using a delayed extraction time of 300 ns and 250 laser scans. gp41c was labeled at the N terminus with biotin succinimide (to allow visualization by Western blot using SA-HRP) and mixed with gp59 (to a final concentration of 1 μm) in the presence of 10 μm 1,6-bis- maleimidohexane (BMH; Pierce) with or without 3 mm ATP and/or 5 nm M13mp18 DNA. After 7 min, the reaction was quenched with 5 μl of gel loading buffer containing 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 14.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue. The products were separated with a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and a Western blot with SA-HRP as a probe was used to detect the biotinylated protein. In the experiments in which gp41 was cross-linked to gp59 in the presence of gp32, gp32 (2 μm) and gp59 (1 μm) were preincubated for 10 min (in the presence or absence of 2 nm M13 DNA) before the addition of 1 μm gp41c (labeled at the N terminus with biotin). Cross-linking conditions and analyses were performed as described above. Molecular weight markers (precision unstained broad range and/or prestained broad range; Bio-Rad) were used to assess the size of the cross-linked species. gp59 was cross-linked to investigate higher oligomer formation by mixing gp59 and gp41 (without a C-terminal cysteine added) to a final concentration of 5 μm each in a 30-μl reaction volume (with or without 5 mm ATP and/or 20 nm M13 DNA) containing BMH at a concentration of 50 μm. After 7 min, the reaction was quenched with gel loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Gel Code Blue (Pierce). Thiol-thiol cross-linking between gp41c and gp59 could occur between the C-terminal cysteine on gp41c and one of the two cysteine residues on gp59 (Cys-42 or Cys-215). It was predicted that the site of cross-link on gp59 is Cys-215. To determine whether cross-linking occurred between the C terminus of gp41 and Cys-215 of gp59, Cys-42 was selectively modified covalently, and gp41c was mixed with gp59 in the presence of BMH. Cys-42 of gp59 was blocked by the addition of 100 μl of a 30 μm solution of gp32 labeled with N-[6-(7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide (AMCA-HPDP; Pierce) to 50 μl of a 20 μm gp59 solution for 30 min. It was previously shown that under these conditions, complete transfer of the fluorophore occurred via a disulfide exchange between Cys-42 of gp59 and the mixed disulfide between Cys-166 of gp32 and the fluorophore (14Ishmael F.T. Alley S.C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25236-25242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). gp32 and excess label were removed from labeled gp59 by subjecting the mixture to a Mono-Q fast protein liquid chromatography column. Proteins were eluted from the Mono-Q column using a linear gradient between 0 and 1 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The amount of labeled gp59 was determined by quantifying the amount of fluorophore based on its absorbance at 345 nm and determination of gp59 amount by Bradford assay. The concentration of fluorophore relative to protein was found to be 1.10:1. The site of label was confirmed by digesting labeled protein with trypsin, separating the fragments by HPLC (14Ishmael F.T. Alley S.C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25236-25242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and identifying the labeled peptide by MALDI mass spectrometry, as described above. Binding of gp41 to gp59 was assessed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) on a MicroCal VP-ITC system (according to the protocol published previously) (18Valentine A.M. Ishmael F.T. Shier V.K. Benkovic S.J. Biocehmistry. 2001; 40: 15074-15085Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Proteins of interest were dialyzed into complex buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm KOAc, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2) for at least 8 h to reach dialysis equilibrium. Protein solutions were centrifuged to remove particles before beginning the experiment and quantitated by UV-visible absorbance. All solutions were degassed prior to use. This degassing step was determined in control experiments not to affect protein activity. gp59 (21 μm) was in the syringe and injected in 7-μl volumes into a 2.2 μm solution of gp41 containing 1 mm ATPγS. Data were analyzed by Origin 5.0 (MicroCal). Heats of dilution were subtracted from all data before fitting. Heats of dilution were determined in a separate control experiment by injecting the protein into buffer. Data analysis requires a binding model, and fitting returns values for the binding constant K, ΔH of binding, ΔS of binding, and the binding stoichiometry N. To determine whether gp59 induced higher oligomer formation of gp41, the two proteins were cross-linked in the absence or presence of ATP. A 100-μl solution of gp59 (10 μm) was labeled with biotin by the following procedure. Biotin-maleimide (Sigma) was dissolved in DMF to make a 100 μm solution, and 10 μl of this solution was added to the gp59 solution for 4 h at 4 °C. gp41 (8 μm) was labeled with rhodamine-maleimide (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) by following the same procedure. The two labeled proteins were mixed to a final concentration of 4 μm each in the presence or absence of 1 mmATP. A solution of 0.25% (final concentration) 3,3′-dithio-bis(propionic acid N- hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma) was added to each sample for 10 min. The products were separated by SDS-PAGE, and gp41 cross-link bands were detected with a Fluor-S multiimager, whereas the gp59 cross-link bands were detected with a Western blot procedure using SA-HRP as a probe. gp41 cross-linked in the presence of ATP was used as a control to assess the size of the cross-linked species. The fluorescently labeled thiol-thiol cross-linker shown in Fig. 1C was synthesized from the trifunctional maleimide cross-linker tris(2-maleimidoethyl)amine (TMEA; Pierce) and the fluorescent probe AMCA-HPDP. AMCA-HPDP dissolved in DMF was reduced with 3 equivalents of tris(2-carboxylethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP; Molecular Probes) and mixed with 10 equivalents of TMEA (dissolved in DMF) for 30 min at 25 °C. The mixture was separated by HPLC as described previously (14Ishmael F.T. Alley S.C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25236-25242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The product was collected by monitoring at 345 nm the absorbance maximum for AMCA and dried in a speed vacuum. MALDI mass spectrometry was used to confirm the identity of the product. gp59 (500 μg) was cross-linked with 10 equivalents of the cross-linker for 7 min in the presence of gp41 (45 μg). The proteins were digested with trypsin as described above, and the peptides were separated by HPLC. Fractions (0.25 ml) were collected, dried in a speed vacuum, and redissolved in 10 μl of 60% acetonitrile, 40% H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The fractions were then placed on the stage of a Fluor-S multiimager, and illuminated in transilluminator mode to identify the fraction that contained the fluorescently labeled cross-linked peptide. This fraction was analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry to determine the mass of the cross-linked peptide. gp41 contains 4 cysteine residues (amino acids 208, 233, 316, and 319). A DTNB assay determined that one of these cysteines was solvent-accessible, but labeling at this site with a cross-linker yielded no cross-links to gp59, suggesting that it is not close to the interface of interaction between the two proteins. 2F. T. Ishmael, S. C. Alley, and S. J. Benkovic, unpublished data. To determine whether the C terminus of gp41c interacted with gp59, cross-linking between the C terminus of gp41c and gp59 was conducted. A cysteine residue was added to the C terminus of gp41 (Cys-476, with the modified protein denoted as gp41c) by cleavage of a gp41-intein fusion protein with cysteine. The protein was then labeled with the thiol-reactive trifunctional cross-linker shown in Fig. 1A. The labeled gp41c was subsequently mixed with gp59 in the presence or absence of DNA and/or ATP and subjected to ultraviolet light to initiate cross-linking. When the products of the cross-linking reaction were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to a Western blot using SA-HRP as a probe, cross-link bands corresponding to gp41c dimers were seen in the absence of gp59, signifying that the C terminus of gp41c is close to or in the homodimeric interface (Fig. 2A, lane 2). When gp41c was mixed with gp59 and exposed to light, in the presence or absence of ATP and/or DNA, high molecular weight species were seen, consistent with gp41c-gp59 cross-links (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–6). Upon the addition of DTT, the cross-link was reduced and the biotin label was transferred to gp59, confirming that a gp41c-gp59 cross-link had occurred (Fig. 2A, lanes 9–12). In order to elucidate a second point of contact between gp41 and gp59, the N terminus of gp41 was labeled as described under “Experimental Procedures” with the amine-reactive trifunctional cross-linker Sulfo-SBED (Fig. 1B). The proteins were mixed in the absence or presence of DNA and/or ATP and then separated by SDS-PAGE followed by a Western blot using SA-HRP as a probe to identify the biotinylated cross-links. When gp41 was cross-linked by itself, a band corresponding to a gp41-gp41 homodimer was observed (Fig. 2B, lane 2). When gp41 and gp59 were mixed, cross-links were visualized in both the absence and presence of ATP and/or DNA (Fig. 2B, lanes 3–6). Reduction of the cross-linker with DTT caused transfer of the biotin to gp59, validating that the cross-link occurred between gp41 and gp59 (Fig. 2B, lanes 7 and 8). Morrical et al. (13Morrical S.W. Beernink H.T.H. Dash A. Hempstead K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20198-20207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) suggested that gp59 has distinct binding sites for gp41c and gp32. Experiments described previously demonstrated that Cys-42 of gp59 is in close proximity to gp32 (14Ishmael F.T. Alley S.C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25236-25242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). gp59 contains a second cysteine residue, Cys-215, that lies on the opposite side of the protein relative to Cys-42. Since it is likely that gp41 interacts on this side of the protein, away from the gp32 binding site, thiol-thiol cross-linking was attempted to cross-link the C terminus of gp41c to gp59. gp41c was N-terminally labeled with biotin to allow easier detection of cross-links by Western blot using SA-HRP as a probe. When mixed with the thiol-thiol cross-linker BMH, gp41c cross-linked to form a homodimer linked at the C-terminal cysteine residues (Fig. 3A). In the presence of gp59, with or without ATP added, bands were seen that correspond to gp41c-gp59 cross-links (Fig. 3A). Typically, two cross-link bands were observed, one that migrated with the expected mobility of a gp41c-gp59 cross-link (molecular mass of about 75 kDa) and a band that migrated with a faster mobility (∼65 kDa). The intensity of the higher mobility band varies from experiment to experiment, whereas the lower mobility band does not vary. In experiments using a cleavable thiol-thiol cross-linker, this pattern of cross-linking between gp41c and gp59 is also seen. Excision of these bands followed by cleavage of the cross-linker and separation of the products on a second gel indicate that both bands are composed of gp41c-gp59 cross-links.2 Most likely, the faster migrating band is due to an intramolecular cross-link of gp41c as well as an intermolecular cross-link to gp59, resulting in higher mobility of the more compact structure than the gp41c-gp59 intermolecular cross-link alone. When DNA was added, no cross-links between gp41c and gp59 were visualized, indicating that some conformational change occurs upon loading of gp41 on DNA (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). To confirm that gp41c cross-linked to Cys-215 of gp59, a cross-linking experiment was conducted in which the Cys-42 of gp59 was blocked by covalent modification. Previously, we showed that incubation of gp32 labeled with a probe via a mixed disulfide with gp59 resulted in complete transfer of the probe from gp32 to gp59 by a disulfide exchange (Fig. 4A) (14Ishmael F.T. Alley S.C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25236-25242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” a label (AMCA) was placed selectively on Cys-42 of gp59 using this method. The modified gp59 protein contained only one free cysteine residue, Cys-215, as determined by MALDI mass spectrometry. Thiol-thiol cross-linking using BMH showed that gp41c cross-linked to both the modified (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 3) gp59 as well as the unmodified gp59 (Fig. 4B, lanes 6 and 7), demonstrating that Cys-42 was not involved in the cross-linking. The interaction between gp41c and gp59 was also analyzed in the presence of gp32. Preincubation o"

In this study, we employed pre-steady state kinetic assays to elucidate the mechanistic role of residue Gln151 in highly error prone DNA synthesis by HIV-1 RT. Using our Q151N high fidelity mutant, which is structurally altered in its ability to interact with the 3′-OH on the sugar moiety of the incoming deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), we examined how this change in RT-dNTP interaction affects HIV-1 RT fidelity. First, we found the binding affinity (K D ) of wild type and Q151N RT proteins to different template/primers to be similar. These results indicate that the Gln151 residue is not involved in the formation of the binary complex (RT·template/primer) during DNA polymerization. We also found that by changing residue 151 from a Gln→Asn, the maximum rate of dNTP incorporation (k pol) for both correct and incorrect dNTPs was not affected. In contrast, the ability of the Q151N mutant to bind both correct and incorrect dNTPs (K d ) was diminished. The Q151N mutant was 120-fold less efficient at binding correct dNTP than wild type RT, and its decrease in binding was such that we were unable to measure the actual binding affinity of Q151N for incorrect dNTPs. Presumably, the fidelity increase observed during the steady state is explained by this defect in Q151N binding to incorrect dNTP. In wild type RT, residue Gln151 is important for tight binding of incorrect dNTPs and may contribute to the low fidelity nature of HIV-1 RT. Since the Q151N mutation also alters RT binding to correct dNTPs, the wild type Gln151 residue may play an important role in efficient binding of RT to correct dNTPs.

Some of these DNA polymerases are specifically involved in error prone DNA synthesis required for either spontaneous mutagenesis or bypassing DNA damage (1Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Yamada A. Dohmae N.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2317-2320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) show that these are actually very low fidelity polymerases. It is possible that these organisms have evolved functionally diverse DNA polymerases for the different activities of genomic replication and mutagenesis. As demonstrated in a series of kinetic experiments with various DNA polymerases, it is clear that the ability to incorporate incorrect dNTPs1 affects the efficiency of DNA synthesis (7Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). In other words, low fidelity and poor ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect dNTPs are detrimental to efficient DNA polymerization, which is likely essential for chromosomal DNA replication. The fact that efficient DNA synthesis and error prone DNA synthesis are kinetically at odds with one another may explain why possession of separate DNA polymerases specific for either replication or mutagenesis is beneficial. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has a single DNA polymerase called reverse transcriptase (RT). HIV-1 RT is one of the most error prone DNA polymerases involved in DNA replication (8Coffin J.M. Chanock R.M. Melnick J.L. Monath T.P. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Virology. Raven, New York1990: 1437-1500Google Scholar, 9Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 10Williams K.J. Loeb L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 176: 165-180PubMed Google Scholar). This low replication fidelity of HIV-1 RT and the resultant error prone DNA synthesis are a presumptive source of HIV-1 genomic hypervariation (9Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar,10Williams K.J. Loeb L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 176: 165-180PubMed Google Scholar). Although HIV-1 RT must efficiently synthesize DNA during viral genomic replication, it concomitantly produces genomic mutations in order to evolve and escape host immune selection. In contrast to organisms that employ multiple polymerases for the activities of genomic replication and mutagenesis, HIV-1 RT has been adapted to execute both of these functions. The fact that HIV-1 RT is able to resolve the kinetic issues associated with efficient but error prone DNA synthesis makes it a unique model to study in understanding the mechanistic and structural elements involved in replication fidelity. DNA polymerization is an ordered reaction that consists of a series of sequential steps. First the polymerase must bind T/P to form a binary polymerase·T/P complex. Binding of the dNTP follows and the ternary polymerase·T/P·dNTP complex then undergoes conformational change and catalysis (7Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 11Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Pre-steady state kinetics examines the ability of the polymerase to bind and then incorporate dNTP. Using a rapid quench instrument, one can measure 1) the binding of dNTPs to the DNA polymerase (K d ) and 2) the maximum rate of dNTP incorporation (k pol) (7Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 11Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Incorporation of incorrect dNTPs under pre-steady state conditions has been studied in order to understand the nature of mutation synthesis by DNA polymerases (12Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9440-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 13Wong I. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 526-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 14Carroll S.S. Cowart M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 804-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These types of studies examining wild type HIV-1 RT fidelity demonstrate that HIV-1 RT differentiates between correct and incorrect dNTPs in both the binding (K d ) and incorporation (k pol) steps by 250-fold and 9–80-fold, respectively (15Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that events that occur during both dNTP binding and dNTP incorporation affect the accuracy of DNA synthesis by HIV-1 RT. Studies involving mutants with altered fidelity have been invaluable in delineating the structural and biochemical determinants of replication accuracy. Examples are the pre-steady state kinetic studies performed with the Klenow fragment from Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (14Carroll S.S. Cowart M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 804-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16Kuchta R.D. Mizrahi V. Benkovic P.A. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8410-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Structural analyses of Klenow fragment and results from random mutagenesis of Taq polymerase illustrate that interactions between the incoming dNTP and the dNTP binding domain, called the O helix, are important molecular determinants in overall polymerase fidelity (17Suzuki M.

Like these studies, our analysis of high fidelity HIV-1 RT mutants will elucidate the mechanistic and structural role of wild type residues during DNA polymerization and mutation synthesis. Recently, we reported that the Q151N mutant has 12.5 times higher fidelity than wild type HIV-1 RT based on the M13 lacZα forward mutation assay (21Weiss K.K. Isaacs S.J. Tran N.H. Adman E.T. Kim B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10684-10694Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Data from single nucleotide steady state kinetic assays using the Q151N mutant also substantiated our findings (22Kaushik N. Talele T.T. Pandey P.K. Harris D. Yadav P.N. Pandey V.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2912-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Structural examination showed that the wild type Gln151residue interacts with the 3′-OH on the sugar moiety of the incoming dNTP (21Weiss K.K. Isaacs S.J. Tran N.H. Adman E.T. Kim B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10684-10694Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this interaction between the Gln151 residue and the 3′-OH of the incorrect dNTP stabilizes RT binding to the incorrect dNTP. This would allow for chemical DNA polymerization to occur even in the absence of base-pairing between the incoming incorrect dNTP and the template nucleotide. When residue 151 is altered from a Gln→Asn, there is a loss in the interaction of Gln151 with the incoming incorrect dNTP as well as in the base-pairing between the template nucleotide and the incorrect dNTP. Failure of stable binding precludes incorporation of the incorrect dNTP and results in an increase in RT fidelity. Interestingly, the Q151N mutation, like the Q151M viral mutation, has increased resistance to nucleoside RT inhibitors such as azidothymidine (23Varatnian J.P. Meyerhans A. Asjo B. Wainhobson S. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1779-1789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Fitzgibbon J.E. Mazar S. Dubin D.T. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1993; 9: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the wild type Gln151 residue may interact with the azido group of the incoming AZTTP, assisting in the AZTTP incorporation reaction. Presumably, the Q151N and Q151M mutations might prevent binding of AZTTP to the active site of HIV-1 RT, conferring AZTTP resistance (21Weiss K.K. Isaacs S.J. Tran N.H. Adman E.T. Kim B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10684-10694Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Kaushik N. Talele T.T. Pandey P.K. Harris D. Yadav P.N. Pandey V.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2912-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, unlike the Q151N mutant, the fidelity of Q151M is the same as that of wild type HIV-1 RT (22Kaushik N. Talele T.T. Pandey P.K. Harris D. Yadav P.N. Pandey V.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2912-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Even though Q151M has evolved a mechanism to discriminate against AZTTP, it is still able to bind incorrect dNTPs like wild type RT. In this study, we investigated the mechanistic steps of DNA polymerization specifically affected by the Q151N HIV-1 RT high fidelity mutation. Specifically, we decided to examine the kinetics of DNA polymerization from an RNA template, which is an activity unique to reverse transcriptases. To do this we employed pre-steady state kinetic assays to identify alterations in dNTP binding or dNTP incorporation. We also used a double filter dot blot assay to assess changes in RT binding to the T/P. Our study reveals that residue Gln151is a molecular element in HIV-1 RT infidelity. The role of residue Gln151 is to promote mutation synthesis by increasing RT binding to incorrect dNTPs. N-terminal end His tagged wild type and Q151N HIV-1 RT proteins were purified as previously described (21Weiss K.K. Isaacs S.J. Tran N.H. Adman E.T. Kim B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10684-10694Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Kim B. Methods. 1997; 12: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). With our protocol, we were able to purify 2 mg of RT proteins with >95% purity from a 1-liter culture. All dNTPs were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen, and RNA template was synthesized by Dharmacon. Primers were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 nucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs). Pre-steady state burst and single turnover experiments were employed to examine the transient kinetics associated with a single nucleotide incorporating onto the 3′ end of a 32P-labeled 17-mer A primer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGCT-3′) annealed to a 40-mer RNA template (5′-AAGCUUGGCUGCAGAAUAUUGCUAGCGGGAAUUCGGCGCG-3′) (11Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 15Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For both sets of reactions, we used 20 μl of T/P preincubated with purified HIV-1 RT protein and reaction buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm KCl, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). This mixture was injected into one sample tube of the rapid quench machine (Kintek). An equal volume of dNTP preincubated with Mg2+ (10 mm) was injected into the other sample tube. The polymerization reaction was initiated by rapidly mixing the two reactants and terminated by adding 0.25m EDTA at different time points. In the pre-steady state burst experiments, T/P (150 nm) was present in excess of RT (∼50 nm) and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 400 μm dNTP. These experiments were used to determine the active site concentrations of the RT proteins (see data analysis; Refs. 7Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar and 11Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The pre-steady state single turnover experiments were used to determine the dNTP concentration dependence of the purified HIV-1 RT proteins. In the presence of varying dNTP concentrations (in the range of 600 nm to 2.5 mm), RT (100 nm) was used in slight excess of T/P (90 nm). In reactions involving incorrect dNTPs, the experiments were performed manually at longer periods of time and used a higher concentration of RT (700 nm) (15Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14056-14063Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The reactions were analyzed by 14% denaturing sequencing gel electrophoresis. The extended product in each reaction was quantified with the Cyclone phosphorimager (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Pre-steady state kinetic data were analyzed using nonlinear regression. Equations were generated with the KaleidaGraph program, version 3.51 (Synergy Software). Data points obtained during the burst experiment were fitted to the burst equation shown below (7Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 11Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). [product]=A[1−exp(−kobst)+ksst]Equation 1 The value A is the amplitude of the burst, which reflects the actual concentration of enzyme that is in active form.k obs is the observed first-order rate constant for dNTP incorporation, whereas k ss is the observed steady state rate constant (11Johnson K.A.

Data from single-turnover experiments were fit to a single exponential equation that measures the rate of dNTP incorporation (k obs) per given dNTP concentration ([dNTP]). These results can then be used to determine K d , the dissociation constant for dNTP binding to the RT·T/P binary complex. This was done by fitting the data to the following hyperbolic equation.kobs=kpol[dNTP]/(Kd+[dNTP])Equation 2 From this equation, we could then identify the kinetic constants for each RT during pre-steady state kinetics:k pol is the maximum rate of dNTP incorporation, and K d is equilibrium dissociation constant for the interaction of dNTP with the E·DNA complex (11Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 12Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9440-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We employed a standard assay protocol previously established to determine theK D of wild type and mutant RTs on three different T/Ps: 17-mer/40-mer RNA template, 17-mer/18-mer DNA template, and 18-mer/18-mer blunt end T/P. A protein binding filter (top filter, nitrocellulose; Schleicher & Schuell), nucleic acid binding filter (bottom filter, DEAE; Schleicher & Schuell), and dot blot system (Schleicher & Schuell) were prepared as described (27Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 28Suo Z. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12459-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). RT proteins (50 nm active site concentration) were incubated with different concentrations (10–800 nm, 20 μl) of 5′32P-labeled T/Ps at 37 °C for 3 min. The RT and T/P mixtures were applied to each well of the dot blot system and washed twice with 100 μl of reaction buffer. After drying both filters, the filters were analyzed using a phosphorimager, and the percentage binding at each T/P concentration was quantitated. The data were then fitted to the binding curve equation previously described (see Eq. 3below; Ref. 28Suo Z. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12459-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). RT­T/P=0.5(KD+RTt+T/P)Equation 3 −0.5(KD+RTt+T/P)2−4RTtT/PThe variables RT-T/P, K D , RTt, and T/P reflect productive RT-template concentration, equilibrium dissociation constant for RT binding to T/P, active RT concentration (see Fig. 1), and total T/P concentration, respectively. From Eq. 3, the K D values of wild type and mutant RTs to these three T/Ps were determined (28Suo Z. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12459-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We determined the active site concentrations of the wild type and Q151N HIV-1 RT proteins (Fig.1). For this, the single nucleotide (dATP) incorporation reaction was performed using a T/P concentration in molar excess over the enzyme concentration. We observed both single turnover events associated with the pre-steady state burst and multiple rounds of DNA polymerization occurring during steady state kinetics. Reactions ranging from 5 ms to 2 s were performed using the rapid quench machine. From Eq. 1, we can determine the active site concentration, the rate of dNTP incorporation under pre-steady state conditions (k obs), and the rate of dNTP incorporation during the steady state (k ss) for both the wild type and Q151N RT proteins at 400 μm dATP. In these initial burst experiments, we used 100 nm wild type and 200 nm Q151N protein. Our results indicate that only 63 nm (63%) wild type RT and 46 nm (23%) Q151N were actually active (Fig. 1). For the wild type RT,k obs was 17.3 × 10−3ms−1, and k ss was 0.09 × 10−3 ms−1. For the Q151N protein, the values for k obs and k ss were 9.0 × 10−3 and 0.6 × 10−3ms−1, respectively (Fig. 1). These differences ink obs and k ss suggest that reaction rates for both proteins are faster under pre-steady state kinetic conditions (k obs) than steady state kinetic conditions (k ss), which has been previously demonstrated (7Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 15Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, the lower rate in the steady state is due to the fact that in this time scale, reactions include multiple rounds of dNTP incorporation and involve various complex steps that may be rate determining (i.e. T/P binding and product release). Surprisingly, the steady state rate of catalysis (k ss) for the Q151N protein is 6-fold higher than that of wild type RT. It is possible that the Q151N mutation may overcome kinetic barriers that restrict wild type DNA polymerization during the steady state. Next, we determined the binding affinity (K d ) of both the wild type and Q151N mutant HIV-1 RT proteins for correct dATP on our T/P (TableI). Concurrently, we measured the maximum rate at which wild type and mutant RTs incorporated correct dATP (k pol). By analyzing the dependence of reaction rate (k obs) on dNTP concentration (Fig.2), we are able to calculateK d and k pol (Eq. 2). Our wild type HIV-1 RT pre-steady state kinetic values when wild type is using dATP are similar to those previously published with dCTP as the correct dNTP (12Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9440-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When we examined the Q151N protein, we observed a 120-fold decrease in binding affinity (increase inK d ) compared to wild type HIV-1 RT, whereas we found only a slight increase (1.6-fold) in the maximum rate of correct dNTP incorporation (k pol; Table I). This suggests that the Q151N mutation specifically reduces the initial binding affinity of RT for the incoming correct dATP. A consequence of this reduction in initial binding affinity (increase inK d ) for dATP is a 75-fold reduction in the pre-steady state incorporation efficiency (k pol/K d ) of Q151N relative to wild type RT (Table I). It is apparent that the rate of correct dATP incorporation for the Q151N mutant differs with dNTP concentration. Compared to wild type RT, which maximally incorporates correct dATP (k pol) at 25 μm, the rate of dATP incorporation (k pol) for the Q151N mutant at 25 μm is much less that that of wild type (Fig. 2). It is possible that at low dNTP concentrations, the step of DNA polymerization involving the Gln151 residue, likely initial dNTP binding, becomes rate limiting. At high correct dATP concentration, initial dNTP binding is not the rate-limiting step. Q151N actually has a faster rate of dNTP incorporation than wild type RT (k obs in Fig. 1 andk pol in Fig. 2).Table IPre-steady state kinetic parameters of HIV-1 RT wild type and Q151N proteinsdNTPHIV-1 RTs k pol K d k pol/K d s −1 μm μm −1 s −1dATP (correct)Wild type29.0 ± 12.4 ± 0.312.0Q151N46.4 ± 0.7 (×1.6)1-aRatios corresponding to the kinetic values of wild type HIV-1 RT.293.4 ± 18.1 (×122)1-aRatios corresponding to the kinetic values of wild type HIV-1 RT.0.16 ( ×75)1-bFold reduction ink pol/K d compared to wild type.dGTP (incorrect)Wild type7.8 × 10−3 ± 0.3 × 10−3177.9 ± 28.74.4 × 10−5Q151N18.1 × 10−3 ± 1.1 × 10−31-cThese k polvalues are K obs at 2.5 mm dNTP.>25001-dMinimum K d , the highest dNTP concentration used in this study.

Open table in a new tab Next, we measured the kinetic parameters associated with the incorporation of the three incorrect dNTPs (dGTP, dCTP, and TTP) (Table I). Since incorporation of incorrect dNTPs is very slow and inefficient, we performed the reactions manually and at high concentrations of RT protein and incorrect dNTP (see “Materials and Methods” and Ref. 12Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9440-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Analysis of the Q151N mutant is complicated because the Q151N reaction rate (k obs) increases in a linear fashion with up to 2.5 mm incorrect dNTPs. Although saturating concentrations of dNTP are >2.5 mm, higher dNTP concentrations (>2.5 mm) cannot be used because they inhibit RT activity (reducingk obs; Ref. 13Wong I. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 526-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Because of this technical difficulty, we could only estimate minimum k polvalues for Q151N (i.e. k obs at 2.5 mm incorrect dNTP). Additionally, we can conclude that theK d for Q151N with all incorrect dNTPs is apparently higher than 2.5 mm. In the scenario with incorrect dGTP, the binding affinity of wild type HIV-1 RT is at least 75-fold lower than its binding affinity for correct dATP (increase in K d ; Table I). The maximum rate at which wild type RT incorporates incorrect dGTP is 4 × 105 times slower than when it incorporates correct dATP (k pol). Similar changes in K d and k pol for wild type HIV-1 RT have also been observed in previous experiments using correct dCTP and incorrect dNTPs (12Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9440-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The efficiency of incorrect dGTP incorporation (k pol/K d ) by wild type RT on our T/P, also termed misincorporation efficiency, was 4.4 × 10−5 μm−1 s−1(Table I). In contrast, the Q151N mutant is diminished in its ability to bind incorrect dGTP a minimum of 14-fold (increase inK d ), with only a slight increase in its rate of dGTP incorporation (k pol) when compared with wild type RT. Similar to the case with correct dNTP, the Gln151residue appears to be involved mainly in the initial binding of RT to incorrect dNTP, and not in the incorporation (k pol) of incorrect dNTPs. Experimentally, we cannot obtain a true value for Q151N misincorporation efficiency (k p"

Here, we have studied the mechanism of condensation both in vitro and in vivo. We found that DNA fragmentation per seof isolated nuclei from non-apoptotic cells induced chromatin condensation that closely resembles the morphology seen in apoptotic cells, independent of ATP utilization, at physiological ionic strengths. Interestingly, chromatin condensation was accompanied by release of nuclear actin, and both condensation and actin release could be blocked by reversibly pretreating nuclei with Ca2+, Cu2+, diamide, or low pH, procedures shown to stabilize internal nuclear components. Moreover, specific inhibition of nuclear F-actin depolymerization or promotion of its formation also reduced chromatin condensation. Chromatin condensation could also be inhibited by exposing nuclei to reagents that bind to the DNA minor groove, disrupting native nucleosomal DNA wrapping. In addition, in cultured cells undergoing apoptosis, drugs that inhibit depolymerization of actin or bind to the minor groove also reduced chromatin condensation, but not DNA fragmentation. Therefore, the ability of chromatin fragments with intact nucleosomes to form large clumps of condensed chromatin during apoptosis requires the apparent disassembly of internal nuclear structures that may normally constrain chromosome subdomains in non-apoptotic cells.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1992; 11: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Although internucleosomal DNA breakdown is often temporally correlated with such chromatin condensation, it is not absolutely required to trigger this event (2Sun D.Y. Jiang S. Zheng L.M. Ojcious D.M. Young J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 3Woo M. Hakem R. Soengas M.S. Duncan G.S. Shahinian A. Kagi D. Hakem A. McCurrach M. Khoo W.

Biol. 1999; 9: 543-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Three pathways have been identified that mediate apoptotic chromatin condensation: (i) a caspase-3-independent pathway triggered by mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor, which leads to an accompanying large-scale DNA fragmentation without internucleosomal DNA cleavage (5Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3417) Google Scholar); (ii) a caspase-3-dependent pathway triggered by the protein acinus, which occurs without inducing any DNA fragmentation (6Sahara S. Aoto M. Eguchi Y. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 401: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar); and (iii) a caspase-3-dependent pathway that leads to internucleosomal DNA cleavage mediated by activated DFF,1 also termed caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease or caspase-activated nuclease (7Liu X.

Although little is known regarding the mechanisms that lead to chromatin condensation in apoptotic cells, considerable information has appeared in the literature on the components that are linked to chromatin condensation in non-apoptotic cells. In interphase nuclei, heterochromatic regions are often associated with specific chromosomal proteins, post-translational modifications, and methylated DNA (reviewed in Refs. 12Lamond A.I. Earnshaw W.C. Science. 1998; 280: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 13Khochbin S. Verdel A. Lemercier C. Seigneurin-Berny D. Curr. Opin. Genet.

In mitotic cells, chromosome condensation requires post-translational modifications and the action of an ATP-dependent complex called “condensin” to introduce positive DNA supercoils into DNA substrates in the presence of topoisomerases (Ref. 15Kimura K. Rybenkov V.V. Crisona N.J. Hirano T. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 16Uhlmann F. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R384-R387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In summary, many parameters and protein factors have been associated with the formation of heterochromatin and condensation of mitotic chromosomes, but which, if any, of these apply to chromatin condensation during apoptosis remains to be determined. Here, we have investigated the mechanism of chromatin condensation mediated by the internucleosomal DNA cleavage pathway in apoptosis. Previously, we demonstrated that purified activated recombinant DFF triggers chromatin condensation when added to nuclei isolated from non-apoptotic cells (8Liu X., Li, P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In the present study we have exploited this observation to dissect the mechanism of condensation triggered by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation using the well established model of isolated HeLa cell nuclei for in vitro reconstitution experiments of apoptotic events (7Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar, 17Hughes F.M., Jr. Cidlowski J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 47-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where possible, we have complemented our in vitro findings by utilizing cultured human leukemic HL-60 cells triggered to undergo apoptosis with etoposide or cisplatin (18Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5870-5878PubMed Google Scholar). Our results reveal that chromatin condensation at physiological ionic strength requires intranuclear mobility, which is allowed by the apparent disruption of components that may compartmentalize chromosome subdomains in normal cells. In addition, such condensation requires intact nucleosomes. Human lymphoblastoid HL-60 cells, cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, were exposed to etoposide (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.) or cisplatin (Ebewe) at final concentrations of 34 and 27 μmfor 6 and 12 h, respectively. In some experiments, DNA minor groove- or actin-binding drugs (at concentrations indicated in below) were added to the medium 30 min prior to etoposide. Cells were then washed with PBS, fixed with 10% formaldehyde for 1 h at 4 °C, washed with PBS, transferred onto microscope slides, dried, and stained with 10 μm 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. DNA from portions of PBS-washed cells was purified and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as described below. For labeling replicating DNA, 200 μm each BrdUrd and deoxycytidine were added to the above medium; and after 10 h, cells were pelleted, resuspended in fresh medium, and treated with drugs as described above for 6 h. Samples that were fixed with 10% formaldehyde for 10 min were used for detection of BrdUrd-labeled DNA as described (19Wright W.E. Tesmer V.M. Liao M.L. Shay J.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, after washing fixed cells with PBS, treatment with methanol/acetic acid (3:1), and transfer onto slides, DNA was denatured, reacted with mouse anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (Sigma), and visualized with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). For nuclease treatment in situ, HL-60 cells were permeabilized with lysolecithin as described (20Pfeifer G.P. Riggs A.D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1102-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 PBS-washed cells were incubated for 1 min at 37 °C with 0.05% lysolecithin in incubation buffer (0.1m KCl, 0.15 m sucrose, 4 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5). Cells were then washed once with incubation buffer by gentle centrifugation and suspended in 0.2 ml of isolation buffer (10 mm KCl, 0.25 m sucrose, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) supplemented with 20 units of MNase (Worthington). After 20 min of incubation at 34 °C, cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde. Nuclei were purified from HeLa S3 or HL-60 cells. Cells were washed by centrifugation with PBS at 4 °C and suspended in cold isolation buffer. Nonidet P-40 was added to 0.5%, and cells were incubated for 10 min on ice. After washing twice with isolation buffer by centrifugation, nuclei were suspended in isolation buffer with 50% glycerol and stored at –80 °C or used fresh. The purified nuclei (∼30 μg of protein) were incubated with activated DFF (100 units/ml), MNase (50 units/ml), or DNase I (10 units/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at 34 °C in 50 μl of buffer consisting of 100 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. Human recombinant DFF was purified from an Escherichia coli expression system and activated by incubation with caspase-3 as described previously (21Widlak P., Li, P. Wang X. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8226-8232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and then caspase was inhibited by 10 μmacetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (Ac-DEVD-Cho). In some experiments, nuclei were incubated with AluI enzyme (1000 units/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or bleomycin (1 mg/ml; Nippon Kayaku). When indicated, nuclei were pretreated with apyrase (10 units/ml) for 15 min at 34 °C; or ATP was replaced with ATPγS or AMP-PNP; or nuclei were treated with nucleases in the presence of 1 mm ZnCl2 or 10 mm KCl. In some experiments, immediately before treatment with nucleases, nuclei were incubated for 30 min at 34 °C with the following compounds (at concentrations indicated in the figure legends): distamycin A, chromomycin A3, bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258), methyl green, ethidium bromide, etoposide, and phalloidin (all from Sigma) and latrunculin A and jasplakinolide (Molecular Probes, Inc.). HeLa nuclei were extracted with 0.2 or 0.35m NaCl in a buffer consisting of 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. Nuclei were incubated for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged for 15 min at 400 × g (control nuclei were incubated in the same buffer, but containing 50 mm NaCl). HeLa nuclei were treated with acidic buffer according to the procedure of Lawson and Cole (22Lawson G.M. Cole R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6576-6580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclei were suspended in 68 mm citric acid/sodium phosphate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 25 mm KCl, 0.25 msucrose, and 5 mm MgCl2 and then incubated on ice for 30 min. Nuclei were centrifuged for 15 min at 400 ×g and then washed twice with neutralization buffer (25 mm KCl, 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mmMgCl2, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5). HeLa nuclei were incubated on ice with 5 mm CuCl2(pretreatment of nuclei with Cu2+ diluted to 1 mm was equally effective in blocking condensation), or 10 mm diamide in neutralization buffer, or 25 mmCaCl2 in neutralization buffer at 37 °C for 15 min and then washed twice with cold neutralization buffer. After incubation of nuclei with nucleases, one-fourth of the reaction mixture was subjected to DNA analyses by agarose gel electrophoresis as described previously (21Widlak P., Li, P. Wang X. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8226-8232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The rest of the reaction mixture was fixed with 10% formaldehyde for 1 h on ice. Nuclei were than centrifuged and suspended in 10 μm4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dissolved in the reaction mixture buffer. Samples were visualized by epifluorescence microscopy, and images were acquired with a color CCD camera. Numbers below panels on the figures show the percentage of nuclei exhibiting chromatin condensation (average of two to three independent experiments, with 200–300 purified nuclei or 500–1000 cells being scored per experiment). Proteins from nuclei or nuclear extracts were separated on SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels and then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Protran, Schleicher & Schüll). Membrane-immobilized proteins were probed with mouse anti-human actin monoclonal antibody and visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig antibody (Oncogene Research Products). We first directly compared the morphology of chromatin condensed in cultured cells undergoing apoptosis with that triggered by DNA fragmentation in vitro in nuclei isolated from the corresponding non-apoptotic cells. For this purpose, we treated cultured human HL-60 cells with either etoposide or cisplatin to induce apoptosis and compared pairwise the extent of nucleosomal DNA laddering with chromatin condensation in these samples and likewise in nuclei isolated from untreated HL-60 cells (Fig.1). In agreement with our previous results (8Liu X., Li, P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), the morphology of nuclei in cells undergoing apoptosis was similar to that induced in nuclei isolated from normal cells after DFF treatment, as visualized by fluorescent microscopy after DNA staining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Fig. 1B). In the context of the work reported here, we will refer to this morphology as that representing “chromatin condensation,” which we define as the coalescence of chromatin into distinct clumps localized mostly at the nuclear periphery. However, such condensation was not DFF-specific because DNA fragmentation by MNase, DNase I, AluI, or even the radiomimetic antibiotic bleomycin (reviewed in Ref. 23Povirk L.F. Mutat. Res. 1996; 355: 71-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) also led to chromatin condensation (Fig. 1B). We have also found in thisin vitro system that the extent of condensation correlated with the degree of DNA fragmentation and that condensation could be observed within 5 min if high levels of nuclease were used; endonuclease G, another protein involved in apoptotic DNA breakdown (24Widlak P., Li, L.Y. Wang X. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48404-48409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), was also effective in inducing chromatin condensation (data not shown). Chromatin condensation could also be induced in nuclei of cells treated with nuclease in situ after cytoplasmic membrane perforation (Fig. 1C). Differences in the morphology of condensation between apoptotic cells (Fig. 1B, panels 2 and 3) and nuclease-treated nuclei or cells (Fig. 1, B, panels 5–9; and C, panel 2) were evident, including a lower background of DNA staining between condensed chromatin clusters and more irregularly shaped nuclear envelopes in the apoptotic cells. Nevertheless, in response to DNA breakdown per se in thisin vitro system, it is significant that the morphology of chromatin condensation closely resembles peripheral chromatin condensation visible in apoptotic cells (late stage I or early stage II as defined in Refs. 25Susin S.A.

Hirano T. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and an ATP requirement has been found for certain apoptotic cell extracts to trigger chromatin condensation (27Kass G.E.N. Eriksson J.E. Weis M. Orrenius S. Chow S.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the energy requirements for condensation in nuclei isolated from non-apoptotic HeLa cells. Nucleosomal DNA laddering mediated by either DFF or MNase was independent of the presence of ATP, ATPγS, or apyrase (Fig.2A, lanes 3–6 and 8–11), but was blocked by 1 mmZnCl2 (lanes 2 and 7), a known potent inhibitor of nucleases (11Halenbeck R. MacDonald H. Roulston A. Chen T.T. Conroy L. Williams L.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 537-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Widlak P., Li, P. Wang X. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8226-8232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition, varied KCl concentrations slightly modulated such laddering (low [KCl] stimulated MNase, but decreased DFF activity) (Fig. 2C). Chromatin condensation in these same samples was manifested only when DNA laddering had occurred and was not inhibited by ATPγS or apyrase (Fig. 2, A and B) or AMP-PNP (data not shown). Furthermore, condensation mediated either by DFF or MNase was less evident at lower KCl concentrations (Fig. 2D, compare panels 1 and 2 and panels 3 and 4) and could be largely reversed by addition of 10 mm EDTA to digested nuclei (Fig. 2D, lower panels). Condensation could also be induced upon shifting MNase-digested nuclei from 10 to 100 mm KCl (data not shown). The observed reversibility of condensation to changes in the concentrations of mono- and divalent ions is not unexpected because previous studies have shown that even isolated mononucleosomes bearing histone H1 can be quantitatively precipitated by exposure to either 100 mm KCl or 5 mm MgCl2 and subsequently reversibly quantitatively solubilized by exposure to low ionic strengths and EDTA (28Olins A.L. Carlson R.D. Wright E.B. Olins D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 3271-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 29Simpson R.T. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5524-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we conclude that coalescing of fragmented chromatin into condensed clumps is energy-independent and optimal at physiological ionic strengths. In considering the mechanism of chromatin condensation in our in vitro system, it seems clear that digested chromatin fragments need to be able to diffuse within isolated nuclei to coalesce into clumps of condensed chromatin. However, nuclei within living cells are known to be organized into subcompartments, which have established territories for individual chromosomes and limit chromatin segment movement to nuclear subregions (Ref. 30Marshall W.F.

Possibly, this internal nuclear organization becomes altered during the processes of cell lysis and nuclei isolation such that intranuclear diffusion of chromatin fragments becomes possible. Indeed, during apoptosis in cultured cells, the accompanying proteolysis of nuclear lamins and other nuclear proteins leads to disorganization of nuclear subcompartments (25Susin S.A. Daugas E. Ravagnan L. Samejima K. Zamzami N. Loeffler M. Costantini P. Ferri K.F. Irinopoulou T. Prevost M.-C. Brothers G. Mak T.W. Penninger J.M. Earnshaw W.C. Kroemer G. J. Exp.

To test the idea that dissolution of internal nuclear structure is required for chromatin condensation in our in vitro system, we took advantage of the observations made by Laemmli and co-workers (36Lewis C.D. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1982; 29: 171-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 37Lebkowski J.S. Laemmli U.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 38Mirkovitch J. Mirault M.-E. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1984; 39: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar) that reversible treatment with Ca2+ or Cu2+ stabilizes DNA attachment sites both in HeLa cell mitotic chromosomes and interphase nuclei (reviewed in Refs. 39Kaufmann S.H. Fields A.P. Shaper J.H. Methods Achiev. Exp. Pathol. 1986; 12: 141-171PubMed Google Scholar, 40Pederson T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 41Hancock R. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2000; 109: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has recently been demonstrated that cellular chromatinin vivo possesses unexpectedly high concentrations of Ca2+ (4–9 mm for interphase nuclei and 20–32 mm for mitotic chromosomes), which are at 3-fold higher levels than those of Mg2+ ions; furthermore, such Ca2+ is enriched in the chromosomal axis and co-localizes with the scaffolding proteins topoisomerase II and ScII (42Strick R. Strissel P.L. Gavrilov K. Levi-Setti R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We also used two other techniques to stabilize internal nuclear components: exposure of nuclei to mild oxidation to generate disulfide bonds within and between protein species (reviewed in Refs. 39Kaufmann S.H. Fields A.P. Shaper J.H. Methods Achiev. Exp. Pathol. 1986; 12: 141-171PubMed Google Scholar, 40Pederson T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 41Hancock R. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2000; 109: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and exposure of nuclei to pH 4.0 followed by neutralization to pH 7.5 (our empirical observation). As shown in Fig.3A, these pretreatments did not significantly disrupt chromatin structure as revealed by the patterns of DNA laddering generated by subsequent digestion with MNase (Fig. 3A, lanes 2–5) or DNase I (data not shown). However, such pretreatments severely inhibited subsequent chromatin condensation (Fig. 3B, panels 2–5). (For these and additional experiments, for convenience, we primarily employed MNase as the nuclease used to trigger condensation.) In addition, chromatin condensation in control nuclei could not be reversed if any of these treatments occurred after nuclease digestion (data not shown). Significantly, all pretreatments that blocked chromatin condensation in isolated nuclei affected the extractability of nuclear proteins by 0.2 and 0.35 m NaCl. Reversible treatment with CaCl2, diamide, or low pH significantly reduced the amount of released protein, whereas CuCl2 pretreatment almost totally prevented nuclear protein release (Fig. 3C). In conclusion, enhancement of metalloprotein interactions, induction of disulfide bond formation, and apparent protein denaturation caused by reversible low pH treatment each apparently stabilize internal nuclear components and thereby disallow digested chromatin fragments the intranuclear mobility required for coalescence into clumps of condensed chromatin. Actin is among the candidate filament proteins that may participate in nuclear subcompartmentalization (reviewed in Ref.41Hancock R. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2000; 109: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To test directly for actin involvement in chromatin condensation, we employed the drugs latrunculin A and phalloidin, which depolymerize and polymerize actin filaments (F-actin), respectively (43Spector I. Shochet N.R. Blasberger D. Kashman Y. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 13: 127-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 44Estes J.E. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, treatment of nuclei with these reagents did not significantly disrupt chromatin structure as revealed by the patterns of DNA laddering. Actin is a known inhibitor of DNase I, which depolymerizes F-actin (45Lazarides E. Lindberg U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4742-4746Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Significantly, treatment of nuclei with phalloidin markedly increased the sensitivity of chromatin to DNase I digestion (Fig. 4A); reversible exposure of nuclei to pH 4 (but not pretreatment with diamide, CaCl2, or CuCl2) also sensitized nuclei to DNase I digestion (data not shown). Furthermore, phalloidin treatment partially inhibited chromatin condensation (Fig.4B, panel 2). It is known that phalloidin will cause the formation of F-actin from G-actin (44Estes J.E. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, the partial inhibition caused by phalloidin was apparently not due to causing this conversion because a similar extent of inhibition was observed when latrunculin A was added at the same time to block F-actin formation (Fig. 4B, panel 4). Although such inhibition was detected in only ∼30% of the nuclei, it proved to be highly reproducible and statistically significant (p < 0.05). In addition, use of jasplakinolide, another reagent known to stabilize F-actin (46Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M.J. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), gave the same degree of partial inhibition of condensation (data not shown). Furthermore, chromatin condensation in control nuclei could not be reversed if the phalloidin treatment occurred after nuclease digestion (data not shown). Interestingly, if the nuclei were first extracted with 0.35 m salt, a condition leading to ∼60% loss of nuclear actin, chromatin condensation could no longer be partially inhibited by phalloidin (data not shown). We also analyzed nuclear proteins released from MNase-digested nuclei by SDS-PAGE and actin by Western blotting (Fig.4, C and D). Concomitant with the condensation process, we found that >80% of the nuclear actin was lost from control nuclei or nuclei pretreated with latrunculin A (Fig. 4, C and D, lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6). Significantly, such a loss was blocked by reversible exposure to pH 4 (Fig. 4D, lanes 9and 10) as well as by pretreatment with CaCl2(lanes 7 and 8), CuCl2 (lanes 11 and 12), or diamide (lanes 13 and 14). Interestingly, phalloidin treatment only partially blocked actin release (Fig. 4, C and D, lanes 3 and 4). This correlates with the observation that phalloidin treatment only fractionally inhibited condensation, unlike pH 4, CuCl2, or diamide. Taken together, these results suggest that F-actin partially restricts chromatin fragment mobility for condensation. We also assayed actin-targeting reagents for their ability to block chromatin condensation in cultured HL-60 cells triggered to undergo apoptosis by etoposide. We selected jasplak"

Multiple hyaluronidase genes have been identified, but the only clue to the function of their products has come from the identification of hyaluronidase 1 deficiency in a single patient with a mild clinical phenotype. As a first step in the generation of mice with hyaluronidase deficiency, we have used experimental and bioinformatic approaches to examine the organization of the mouse chromosome 9 region containing, in order, Hyal2, Hyal1, and Hyal3. This region was found to be complex, with Fus2 partially embedded in Hyal3, and Ifrd2 immediately downstream from Hyal3. The Hyal genes were all found to have four exons, and exons 2-4 exhibited the highest sequence conservation. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the tissue expression profile for Hyal1 was similar in mice and humans, but a greater number of transcripts was detected in mouse tissues. Hyal3 was expressed more broadly in mice compared with humans and again exhibited additional transcripts. Reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated that some of the larger Hyal1 transcripts, seen on the Northern blot, were the result of cotranscription of Hyal1 with downstream genes, Fus2 or Hyal3. In vitro transcription/translation of one of the high abundance bicistronic transcripts produced Hyal 1, suggesting that Hyal 1 could be produced from all of the bicistronic transcripts. Characterization of the region including mouse Hyal1 and Hyal3 revealed complex organization and transcription that must be considered in the development and interpretation of mouse models involving genes in this region."
https://openalex.org/W2026543898,"Although major efforts in elucidating different DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways and their contribution to accurate repair or misrepair have been made, little is known about the influence of chromatin structure on the fidelity of DSB repair. Here, the repair of ionizing radiation-induced DSBs was investigated in heterochromatic centromeric regions of human cells in comparison with other genomic locations. A hybridization assay was applied that allows the quantification of correct DSB rejoining events in specific genomic regions by measuring reconstitution of large restriction fragments. We show for two primary fibroblast lines (MRC-5 and 180BR) and an epithelial tumor cell line that restriction fragment reconstitution is considerably more efficient in the centromere than in average genomic locations. Importantly, however, DNA ligase IV-deficient 180BR cells show, compared with repair-proficient MRC-5 cells, impaired restriction fragment reconstitution both in average DNA and in the centromere. Thus, the efficient repair of DSBs in centromeric DNA is dependent on functional non-homologous end joining. It is proposed that the condensed chromatin state in the centromere limits the mobility of break ends and leads to enhanced restriction fragment reconstitution by increasing the probability for rejoining correct break ends.

They can either be repaired accurately, restoring genomic integrity, or can be misrepaired, leading to genomic rearrangements. Higher eukaryotic cells primarily repair DSBs by one of two distinct pathways, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). NHEJ is the predominant repair pathway in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and involves the DNA end-binding heterodimer Ku70/Ku80, the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), the XRCC4 gene product, and DNA ligase IV (for reviews, see Refs. 1Jeggo P.A. Adv. Genet. 1998; 38: 185-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 2Karran P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 3van Gent D.C. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism of DSB rejoining by NHEJ is still unclear, but the process does not require significant regions of sequence homology. NHEJ is thought to frequently restore the original sequence at the break point, but sometimes small deletions or insertions may arise (4Critchlow S.E. Jackson S.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 394-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). In the presence of multiple DSBs, this pathway has the potential to generate genomic rearrangements by joining incorrect break ends (5Richardson C. Jasin M. Nature. 2000; 405: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 6Rothkamm K. Kühne M. Jeggo P.A. Löbrich M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3886-3893PubMed Google Scholar). HR achieves repair by the use of an undamaged homologous template. It involves proteins of the RAD52 epistasis group and plays a crucial role in DSB repair in higher eukaryotic cells (for a review, see Ref. 7Thompson L.H. Schild D. Mutat. Res. 2001; 477: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In contrast to mammalian cells defective in NHEJ, however, HR-deficient mutants display less severe radiosensitivity (8Thompson L.H. Schild D. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although DSBs enzymatically generated in chromosomal constructs containing tandemly repeated sequences can be efficiently repaired by HR (9Liang F. Han M. Romanienko P.J. Jasin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5172-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), the prevailing evidence suggests that this process is predominantly involved in the resolution of stalled replication forks and operates for the repair of exogenously induced damage almost exclusively in late S and G2 when the sister chromatid is available as a homologous template (10Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The fidelity of DSB repair by HR should be high, because the original sequence can be restored efficiently and because potential genomic rearrangements resulting from crossing-over events during gene conversion between homologous sequences on heterologous chromosomes could not be detected (11Johnson R.D. Jasin M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 196-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Constitutively heterochromatic regions can be found in several genomic positions, sometimes covering large portions of a chromosome as in the human Yq arm and sometimes encompassing rather small regions as in telomeres. Also, centromeric regions are constitutively heterochromatic and remain condensed during the interphase of the cell cycle (12Choo K.H.A. The Centromere. Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York, Tokyo1997Google Scholar). Within a heterochromatic region, usually a specific type of repetitive DNA predominates, with α-satellite DNA being exclusively localized to the centromeric regions of all human chromosomes. α-Satellite DNA ranges in size between 200 kbp and several Mbp and is comprised of tandemly arranged 171-bp monomers that are organized into higher order repeats of anything between 2 and ∼35 monomers (13Murphy T.D. Karpen G.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 317-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The sequence divergence between individual higher order repeats is very small (<2%), but the monomers within a higher order repeat can show substantial variation (20–40% sequence divergence). Therefore, it is the higher order repeat unit that characterizes distinct subfamilies of α-satellite DNA. Any one chromosome often contains several different subfamilies and a single subfamily can also be shared by different chromosomes (14Willard H.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1991; 1: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Since its discovery in humans (15Manuelidis L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 3063-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), α-satellite DNA has become the most extensively studied of the highly repetitive DNA families and provides a model for the large number of repeat families that characterize the genome of human cells. In the present study, we have investigated the influence of the particular structural characteristics in the centromeres of human cells on DSB repair processes by employing a method that is based on hybridization detection of individual genomic restriction fragments. We had previously shown that the repair of DSBs induced by ionizing radiation can be measured in specific genomic regions (6Rothkamm K. Kühne M. Jeggo P.A. Löbrich M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3886-3893PubMed Google Scholar, 16Löbrich M. Rydberg B. Cooper P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12050-12054Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) but had so far failed to detect significant variations in DSB repair between different locations (17Rothkamm K. Löbrich M. Mutat. Res. 1999; 433: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here, we report, for the first time, the existence of intragenomic heterogeneity of DSB repair. It was observed that human cells repair DSBs in centromeric DNA substantially better than in DNA regions without particular structural characteristics. By investigating cell lines deficient in defined DSB repair pathways and by examining ribosomal DNA (rDNA) regions, the efficient repair in centromeric DNA could be attributed to the condensed chromatin state of this genomic region. Our observations help to elucidate how the repair of DSBs and the generation of chromosomal aberrations by incorrect repair processes are affected by chromatin organization. Primary human fibroblasts MRC-5 (obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures) and 180BR (a gift from P. Jeggo, Medical Research Council Cell Mutation Unit, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK), and human bladder carcinoma cells MGH-U1 (a gift from S. Powell, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA) were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% (20% for 180BR) fetal calf serum and antibiotics. All incubations were performed at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2and 95% air. Non-dividing cultures, obtained by growing cells to superconfluency, were used in all experiments (at least 90% in G1, as determined by flow cytometry). For cell viability tests by DNA content measurements using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson), cells were harvested, resuspended in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.5 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.45), fixed with 70% ice-cold ethanol, and stained with propidium iodide. To assess cell viability by trypan blue exclusion, an equal volume of trypan blue dye (0.5% w/v) was added to an aliquot of cells, and the solution was allowed to sit briefly at room temperature for dye uptake. The fraction of dead cells with dye uptake was then scored in a hemacytometer. For the MTT viability test, ∼3 × 106 cells in a 75-cm2 culture flask were incubated for 3 h with 5 mg of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2.5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma) in 10 ml medium at 37 °C to allow the cells to utilize the yellow tetrazolium substrate to produce a blue formazan product. 10 ml of solubilization solution (10% SDS, 0.01 m HCl) was added, and the flasks were incubated overnight at 37 °C to produce a homogeneous solution suitable for measurement of optical density. The difference in light absorption at 550 and 700 nm is proportional to the product concentration and was used as a measure of the metabolic activity of the sample. X-irradiation was performed at 95 kV and 25 mA at a dose rate of ∼10 Gy/min as determined by chemical dosimetry. Cells were irradiated in culture flasks filled with ice-cold PBS to prevent repair during irradiation. For repair incubation, PBS was replaced with the original medium and the flasks were incubated at 37 °C. For experiments in which repair of MGH-U1 cells was inhibited, wortmannin (20 μm) was added to the medium 2 h prior to irradiation and the wortmannin-containing medium was used for repair incubation. Following repair, cells were trypsinized and counted. Although no cell loss was detectable for MRC-5, 180BR, and MGH-U1 cells during the entire repair period, wortmannin treatment of MGH-U1 cells caused significant cell loss for incubation times of 16–24 h. Trypsinization was stopped by adding an equal volume of ice-cold medium, and the cells were spun down by centrifugation at 200–300 × g at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended at a concentration of 107 per ml in 0.7% low melting temperature agarose (Type VII, Sigma) in PBS and cast into pre-cooled plug molds. For measuring initial DNA damage, cells were embedded into agarose plugs and the plugs were irradiated in ice-cold PBS. This prevents repair that could have occurred during trypsinization and plug preparation. The cells inside the plugs were then equilibrated in lysis solution (1 mg/ml Pronase E and 1% (w/v) sodium lauroyl sarcosine in 0.5 m Na2EDTA (pH 8)) at 4 °C for 1 h to inhibit cellular nucleases and repair enzymes, lysed in the same solution at 50 °C for 2 days and incubated in 0.5 mNa2EDTA (pH 8) for 1 day at 50 °C to wash out sarcosine residues. To determine all DSB rejoining events in the entire genome, DNA was separated by PFGE without prior restriction enzyme digestion. After washing the plugs briefly in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, pH 8), PFGE was carried out for 40 h in 0.8% agarose in 0.5 × TBE (44.5 mmTris-HCl, 44.5 mm boric acid, 1 mmNa2EDTA, pH 8) at 16 °C with a field strength of 3 V/cm and pulse times linearly increasing from 40 to 800 s in a CHEF-DR system (Bio-Rad). Gels were stained with ethidium bromide, photographed with a digital camera system under UV transillumination, and analyzed with commercially available software (AIDA 2.40, Raytest). The fraction of DNA able to enter the gel was quantified. Samples that were irradiated with various doses and not incubated for repair served as a calibration curve to determine the percentage of remaining DSBs from the fraction of DNA entering the gel in the repair samples (17Rothkamm K. Löbrich M. Mutat. Res. 1999; 433: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For determining DSB rejoining in specific genomic regions, DNA was digested with restriction enzymes prior to electrophoresis. 50-μl plug stripes containing DNA from about 5 × 105 cells were washed at least six times in several milliliters of TE for 1 h each, equilibrated in reaction buffer without restriction enzyme for 1 h, and finally digested with about 20 units of restriction enzyme for 12–15 h at 37 °C. NotI, a rare-cutting enzyme, was used to investigate DSB rejoining in average DNA regions and Hin dIII, a frequent-cutting enzyme, was used to analyze DSB rejoining in centromeric DNA. For investigating rDNA regions, the frequent-cutting enzyme EcoRV was used. The gels were run for 115 h at 1.5 V/cm with pulse times from 500 to 3000 s to separate NotI fragments of MRC-5 and 180BR cells, or for 40 h at 3 V/cm with 40–800 s to separate NotI and EcoRV fragments of MGH-U1 cells and Hin dIII fragments of MRC-5 and 180BR cells. The Hin dIII-digested DNA of MGH-U1 cells was separated for 20 h at 4.5 V/cm with a constant pulse time of 180 s. After PFGE separation, the DNA was partly depurinated and vacuum-blotted onto a charged nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) by alkaline transfer. Prehybridization for at least 4 h and hybridization overnight were performed in 20 ml of hybridization buffer (5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's, 2% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml sonicated fish sperm DNA) at 65 °C for the membranes containing NotI-digested DNA and at 54 °C in 20 ml of hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide for the membranes containing Hin dIII- or EcoRV-digested DNA.

Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) were cut out from plasmids with appropriate restriction enzymes and gel-purified before labeling. Radioactive labeling of the probe was carried out by random priming (Rediprime, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) using [α-32P]dCTP (>222 TBq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by spin-column chromatography. The specific activity of the labeled probe varied between 2 and 4 × 109 dpm/μg, and 25 ng of labeled probe was used per 20 ml of hybridization buffer. After hybridization, filters were washed in three steps in SSPE and 0.1% SDS with increasing stringency. The final washing was at 65 °C for 30 min in 40 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mmNa2EDTA, and 1% SDS. Filters were wrapped in Saran wrap and exposed to an imaging screen, and the screen was scanned by a phosphorimaging system (Cyclone, Canberra Packard). Quantitative analysis was carried out using the phosphorimaging software. A detailed description of the assays, including a description of the evaluation procedure, is published in Rothkamm and Löbrich (17Rothkamm K. Löbrich M. Mutat. Res. 1999; 433: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We had previously described that DSB induction and repair can be investigated by analyzing specific genomic restriction fragments in irradiated and repair-incubated mammalian cells (6Rothkamm K. Kühne M. Jeggo P.A. Löbrich M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3886-3893PubMed Google Scholar, 16Löbrich M. Rydberg B. Cooper P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12050-12054Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The approach is based on separating genomic restriction fragments by PFGE and detection of specific fragments by Southern hybridization. In the present study we applied this hybridization approach to investigate DSB induction and rejoining in centromeric DNA in comparison to average DNA regions of human cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. For analyzing average DNA regions, the rare-cutting restriction enzyme NotI was used and an individual fragment from chromosome 21 with a size of either 2 or 3.2 Mbp was visualized by Southern hybridization with the single copy DNA probe D21S4 or D21S1 (Fig. 1, A and B, top panels). Both fragments represent DNA regions without specific structural or sequential characteristics and were previously shown to resemble average DNA regions with regard to DSB induction and rejoining (16Löbrich M. Rydberg B. Cooper P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12050-12054Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 17Rothkamm K. Löbrich M. Mutat. Res. 1999; 433: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For analyzing centromeric DNA, the frequent-cutting restriction enzyme Hin dIII, which generates fragments with sizes of several kbp for average DNA, was employed. Because centromeric DNA with tandemly arranged repetitive elements of 171 bp does not contain an Hin dIII restriction site (21Burmeister M. Ulanovsky L. Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis: Protocols, Methods, and Theories. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1992Crossref Google Scholar), much larger restriction fragments are obtained in the centromere region than in average DNA. Thus, following hybridization with the centromere-specific DNA probe D21Z1, fragments with sizes up to ∼2 Mbp (depending on the cell line) are visible (Fig. 1, A and B, bottom panels). The appearance of several centromeric restriction fragments instead of one single fragment likely reflects the sequence similarities between centromere DNA of different chromosomes. Indeed, it has been shown by in situ hybridization that the DNA probe D21Z1 predominantly binds to the centromeric regions of chromosomes 13 and 21, which both consist to a large proportion of the 4-monomer subfamily of α-satellite DNA called L1.26 (12Choo K.H.A. The Centromere. Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York, Tokyo1997Google Scholar) and hybridizes weakly to chromosomes 2, 8, 9, and 20 (22Devilee P. Cremer T. Slagboom P. Bakker E. Scholl H.P. Hager H.D. Stevenson A.F. Cornelisse C.J. Pearson P.L. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1986; 41: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For quantitative analysis, large fragments with strong band intensities were evaluated (indicated by the arrows in Fig. 1B, bottom panels) so that probably the same or closely related centromeric subfamilies are investigated in the different cell lines. For one cell line (MRC-5), two fragments with nearly the same size but different hybridization intensities were evaluated (Fig. 1B, lower left panel). The band showing strong hybridization intensity probably represents a centromere with a large proportion of the L1.26 subfamily detected with DNA probe D21Z1, whereas the weakly hybridizing band either contains α-satellite DNA with sequence homologies to L1.26 allowing cross-hybridization or a small proportion of L1.26 together with other α-satellite subfamilies. Because identical results with regard to DSB induction and repair were obtained for the two fragments, the L1.26 α-satellite subfamily is probably representative of the other centromeric sequences. This also suggests that the band that is chosen for analysis in 180BR or MGH-U1 cells is representative of the other centromeric bands that could not be evaluated because of their small target size for DSB induction. The application of a frequent-cutting restriction enzyme to analyze centromeric DNA has the dual advantage that (i) average DNA regions are electrophoretically separable from centromere DNA so that the specificity of the hybridization signal can easily be controlled and (ii) the analyzed restriction fragment contains exclusively centromeric sequences and is not comprised of a mixture of centromeric and average DNA, which would be the case if rare-cutting enzymes were applied. After exposure of human cells to ionizing radiation, the band intensities of the restriction fragments decrease with increasing radiation dose, and a smear below the band accumulates that reflects smaller DNA pieces due to induced DSBs (see parts B and C in Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 below). Analysis of the number of breaks within the restriction fragment examined involved the measurement of the hybridization signal of the band,IB, representing the unbroken restriction fragment and the quantitation of the hybridization signal of the whole lane, IT, to normalize to equal DNA loading. Assuming a random induction of breaks within the fragment (Poisson distribution), the number of DSBs is equivalent to the negative logarithm of the ratio of the relative intensity,IR =IB/IT, of the irradiated sample to the relative intensity of the control sample. After normalizing the number of DSBs per restriction fragment to equal DNA length (DSBs per Mbp), results from different restriction fragments can be compared. We investigated DSB induction in a centromeric DNA region in comparison to average DNA in three different cell lines and found that the number of breaks induced per Mbp per Gy was the same (Fig. 1C). This shows that centromeric DNA and average DNA are equally susceptible to DSB induction after x-irradiation and suggests that there are no large differences in induction of DSBs in different genomic locations.Figure 4DSB rejoining in primary human fibroblasts deficient in DNA ligase IV (180BR).A, conventional PFGE assay.

The capacity of a cell to grow into a colony is a proof of reproductive integrity, and because radiation doses of a few Gy significantly reduce the colony forming ability of a cell, doses of several tens of Gy certainly will kill cells in the sense that they are rendered unable to divide. For differentiated or non-proliferating cells, however, loss of the capacity for sustained proliferation is an inappropriate term. In this case, cell death in the mode of apoptosis or necrosis can be recognized based on morphological, biochemical, and molecular changes of the dying cell (23Schwartz L.M. Osborne B.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: xv-xviiiCrossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Because confluent non-dividing cell cultures were used in the present work for repair studies and radiation damage is known to be a potent inducer of apoptosis in numerous cell types, we wished to assess the impact of ionizing irradiation on cell viability by a series of different assays. Normal primary human fibroblasts were irradiated with 80 Gy of x-rays and analyzed in comparison with un-irradiated cells either 1 or 6 days after irradiation. No morphological change was apparent in the cell culture (Fig. 2A). Because cell death is usually accompanied by a change in the property of cells to scatter light (24Darzynkiewicz Z., Li, X. Gong J. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 41: 15-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), we determined cell viability by flow cytometric measurements of light scatter. Again, no difference between un-irradiated and irradiated cells was detectable (Fig. 2B). Extensive DNA degradation is a characteristic event of cell death, but no change in DNA integrity was observed electrophoretically (data not shown) or with flow cytometric measurements of propidium iodide-labeled cells (Fig. 2C). During necrosis or apoptosis, loss of membrane integrity is often measured by uptake of a certain dye. We used the trypan blue exclusion test as a cell viability assay and found that primary human fibroblasts retain their membrane integrity for at least 6 days following 80-Gy x-irradiation (Fig. 2D). The MTT test is based on the metabolic activity of the cells' mitochondria and can discriminate between functionally living and dead cells (25McGahon A.J. Martin S.J. Bissonnette R.P. Mahboubi A. Shi Y. Mogil R.J. Nishioka W.K. Green D.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 153-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Results from this assay show that the biochemical activity of the cells is not appreciably decreased after irradiation (Fig. 2E). We conclude from these various observations that an x-ray dose of 80 Gy does not significantly affect cell viability in non-dividing primary human fibroblasts for at least 6 days. Additional viability studies with a DSB repair-impaired primary human fibroblast line demonstrate a lack of morphological changes and DNA degradation (Fig. 2F) even 14 days after 80-Gy x-irradiation and thus support the notion that non-dividing primary human fibroblasts are extremely r"

To determine the domains of major intrinsic protein (MIP) family proteins involved in oligomerization, we constructed protein chimeras corresponding to the aquaporin AQPcic substituted in the loop E (including the proximal part of transmembrane domain (TM) 5) and/or the C-terminal part (including the distal part of TM 6) by the equivalent domain of the glycerol channel aquaglyceroporin (GlpF) (chimeras called AGA, AAG, and AGG). The analogous chimeras of GlpF were also constructed (chimeras GAG, GGA, and GAA). cRNA corresponding to all constructs were injected into Xenopus oocytes. AQPcic, GlpF, AAG, AGG, and GAG were targeted to plasma membranes. Water or glycerol membrane permeability measurements demonstrated that only the AAG chimera exhibited a channel function corresponding to water transport. Analysis of all proteins expressed either in oocytes or in yeast by velocity sedimentation on sucrose gradients following solubilization by 2% n-octyl glucoside indicated that only AQPcic and AAG exist in tetrameric forms. GlpF, GAG, and GAA sediment in a monomeric form, whereas GGA and AGG were found mono/dimeric. These data bring new evidence that, within the MIP family, aquaporins and GlpFs behave differently toward nondenaturing detergents. We demonstrate that the C-terminal part of AQPcic, including the distal half of TM 6, can be substituted by the equivalent domain of GlpF (AAG chimera) without modifying the transport specificity. Our results also suggest that interactions of TM 5 of one monomer with TM 1 of the adjacent monomer are crucial for aquaporin tetramer stability.

The flow of water and small solutes across lipid bilayers is necessary for fundamental cell functions. The first water channel was characterized in 1992 (1Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) and categorized in major intrinsic protein (MIP) 1The abbreviations used are: MIPmajor intrinsic proteinAQPaquaporinTMtransmembrane domainGlpFaquaglyceroporinOGn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside1The abbreviations used are: MIPmajor intrinsic proteinAQPaquaporinTMtransmembrane domainGlpFaquaglyceroporinOGn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside family proteins. Based on oocyte swelling assays or proteoliposome osmotic behavior by stopped-flow kinetics, this protein family is now divided in two major functional subgroups: aquaporins (AQP), or specific water channels, and aquaglyceroporins (GlpFs), which are permeated by small solutes such as glycerol and to a lesser extend by water (2Borgnia M.J. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2888-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). All members of the MIP family present a high degree of similarity in their amino acid sequence and the same topological model: six transmembrane domains (TMs 1–6) connected to each other by five loops (A–E) with two conserved asparagin-prolin-alanin boxes in loops B and E (3Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical experiments and three-dimensional analysis by electron crystallography have demonstrated that aquaporins are functional in a tetrameric assembly in biological membranes (4Cheng A. van Hoek A.N. Yeager M. Verkman A.S. Mitra A.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 5Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heymann J.B. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recent x-ray analysis of three-dimensional crystals of glycerol channel describe an homotetrameric form of the protein within crystals (9Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). However, several biochemical data indicated differences in quaternary structure between aquaporins and glycerol facilitators. Velocity sedimentation analysis on density gradients demonstrated that aquaporins are homotetrameric when extracted from membranes by nondenaturing detergents such as n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (OG) or Triton X-100, whereas GlpF (the glycerol facilitator of Escherichia coli) exhibits sedimentation coefficient only compatible with a monomeric form (10Lagree V.

Freeze fracture analysis data of MIPs expressed in Xenopus oocytes were in agreement with our biochemical observations (13Bron P. Lagree V. Froger A. Rolland J.P. Hubert J.F. Delamarche C. Deschamps S. Pellerin I. Thomas D. Haase W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We postulated that the oligomerization state of MIP proteins could be involved in their transport selectivity. Recent reports have confirmed that the monomeric form of GlpF exists in nondenaturing detergent. However, oligomeric forms are also found in the same detergents, depending on protein concentration or biochemical environment. This suggests that GlpF could form weak oligomers and that lipid bilayer or other components of the membrane may play a role in protein activity (2Borgnia M.J. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2888-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 14Manley D.M. McComb M.E. Perreault H. Donald L.J. Duckworth H.W. O'Neil J.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12303-12311Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). When present in detergent, monomer-monomer interactions of GlpF are less stable than those observed for the aquaporin AqpZ (2Borgnia M.J. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2888-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). All together, these data could mean that functional specificity is linked to strength of self-association of MIP monomers in membrane bilayers. Nevertheless, the functional native oligomeric state of E. coli glycerol facilitator remains unclear whereas functional water channels such as AQP1, AQPcic (an aquaporin from the homopteran insect Cicadella viridis), or AqpZ are well known to be stable tetramers in lipid bilayers (5Murata K.

In both proteins, part of the channel pore is constituted by the junction of loops B and E that overlap midway between the leaflets of the membrane in a zone delimited by the six transmembrane domains (3Jung J.S.

Multiple sequence alignments of MIP proteins allowed identification of positions corresponding to amino acid residues conserved in aquaporins or in glycerol facilitators with highly different physicochemical properties between the two subgroups. Four of these discriminant amino acids are located in loop E and at the upper part of the sixth TM (17Froger A. Tallur B. Thomas D. Delamarche C. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1458-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 18Heymann J.B. Engel A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1039-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 19Delamarche C. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Substitution of tyrosine 222 and tryptophan 223 in the upper part of the sixth TM of AQPcic by the two corresponding amino acids of GlpF (a proline and a leucine, respectively) induced a switch from a water to a glycerol channel and a switch from a tetrameric to a monomeric state in nondenaturing detergent (20Lagree V.

Although the general relevance of this observation is unclear (2Borgnia M.J. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2888-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), functional analyses of AQP0-AQP2 chimeras have demonstrated that stability of loop E is crucial for MIP channels (21Mulders S.M. van der Kemp A.J.

When TM 5 was replaced in AQP0 by that of AQP2, it was concluded that the distal part of TM 5 is necessary for maximum water channel activity and contributes to formation of the aqueous pore and determination of the flux rate (22Kuwahara M. Shinbo I. Sato K. Terada Y. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16340-16346Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Recent crystallography and molecular modeling data supported the involvement of TM 5 in spatial relative positions of loops B and E for AQP1 and GlpF pore selectivity. These data also suggest that some residues of TM 1 and TM 5 could be involved in interactions between monomers within the tetramer (5Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heymann J.B.

Structure. 2001; 9: 1083-1093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).All together, these observations highlight the importance of the loop E and the fifth and sixth TMs in function and selectivity of MIP proteins. In the present study, we aimed to understand the relation between function, selectivity, and oligomerization of MIPs, by analysis of AQPcic and GlpF chimeras. Three of the chimeras correspond to the aquaporin substituted in loop E and/or C-terminal part by the equivalent domain of the glycerol channel (chimeras called AGA, AAG, and AGG). The three other chimeras correspond to the analogous chimeras of GlpF (GAG, GGA, and GAA). We then analyzed the functional channel properties and the quaternary structure of AQPcic-GlpF chimera proteins expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our study shows that the C-terminal domain, including half of the sixth TM of the aquaporin AQPcic, can be replaced by the equivalent domain of GlpF without affecting channel specificity and quaternary organization.RESULTSWe constructed chimeras corresponding to the aquaporin AQPcic replaced in the loop E and/or the C-terminal part (including the major part of the sixth transmembrane segment) by the equivalent domain of the glycerol channel GlpF (chimeras called AGA, AAG, and AGG). The analogous chimeras of GlpF were also constructed (chimeras GAG, GGA, and GAA). To be able to exchange these domains, two restriction sites were introduced in each cDNA (Fig. 1). Constructions obtained were used to create cDNA encoding the following chimeric proteins: AGA, AQPcic with loop E from GlpF including half of the fifth and sixth TMs; AAG, AQPcic with C-terminal part from GlpF including distal half of the sixth TM; AGG, AQPcic with loop E (including half of fifth TM) and C-terminal part from GlpF; GAG, GlpF with loop E from AQPcic including half of the fifth and sixth TMs; GGA, GlpF with C-terminal part from AQPcic including distal half of the sixth TM; GAA, GlpF with loop E (including half of fifth TM) and C-terminal part from AQPcic (Fig. 2).Transcripts corresponding to AQPcic, GlpF, and chimera proteins were injected into X. laevis oocytes, and the presence of proteins in oocyte membranes was assayed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3). All AQPcic-GlpF chimeras are expressed in oocytes membranes except AGA protein. Swelling assays on oocytes show that wild type AQPcic and AAG chimera exhibit water permeability coefficients (Pf) significantly higher than control oocytes (Fig. 4A). In both cases, the increase of water permeability is inhibited by the addition of mercury (Fig. 4C). Oocytes injected with AGG, GAG, GGA, and GAA mRNA present water permeability coefficients similar to control oocytes. Glycerol apparent permeability (P′gly) measurement show that all chimeras present an apparent permeability coefficient to glycerol similar to that of control oocytes (Fig. 4B). To investigate the possibility that the absence of functionality of AGG, GAG, GGA, and GAA proteins could be a consequence of misrouting, immunocytochemistry experiments were performed on Xenopus oocyte paraffin sections. Fig. 5 shows that AQPcic is found mostly in the plasma membrane, whereas only a minor part of the synthesized GlpF protein is present at the plasma membrane 72 h following RNA microinjection. The AAG, AGG, and GAG chimeras appear partially targeted to plasma membranes, whereas GGA seems retained in the cytoplasmic fraction.Figure 3Expression of AQPcic, GlpF, and chimeric proteins in Xenopus oocytes. Western blots were performed with total protein membrane extracts from one oocyte per lane. Oocytes were injected with AQPcic cRNA, GlpF, or chimeric proteins cRNA (GGA, GAA, AGA, AAG, AGG, and GAG).

The presence of proteins in yeast membranes was previously verified by Western blot (Fig. 6). All chimera proteins, including AGA, are fully expressed in the yeast system. AQPcic, GlpF, and chimeras were then solubilized by 2% OG, 1% Triton X-100, or 1% SDS and analyzed on a linear 2–20% (w/v) sucrose density gradient. The results presented in Fig. 7 were obtained in OG; identical data were obtained with samples solubilized in Triton X-100. In both cellular models, oocyte and yeast, AQPcic peaks at sedimentation fractions corresponding to a 6.8 S apparent sedimentation coefficient mean value that fits with a homotetrameric form of the protein, whereas GlpF peaks at ∼2.8 S fractions, which correspond to a monomer in detergent (Fig. 7A). Concerning AQPcic-GlpF chimeras, only AAG, which is a functional water channel in Xenopus oocytes, is found tetrameric in sucrose gradients. This chimera sometimes presents a minor monomeric form in addition to the tetrameric form in the oocyte expression system but is always fully tetrameric when extracted from yeast membranes. The AGG, GAG, GGA, and GAA chimeras, which have been found nonfunctional in Xenopus oocytes, are monomeric and/or exhibit intermediary forms that could be dimers in OG. The AGA chimera, unexpressed in oocytes, is monomeric following nondenaturing detergent extraction from yeast membranes (Fig. 7B). When solubilized in 1% SDS, all wild type and chimeric proteins peak at fractions that correspond to monomers (data not shown).Figure 6Expression of AQPcic, GlpF, and chimeric proteins in S. cerevisiae. Yeast cells were transformed with expression vector pY60 containing cDNA encoding AQPcic, GlpF, and chimera proteins.

Past work suggests that there may be specific motifs conferring either glycerol or water permeability (17Froger A. Tallur B. Thomas D. Delamarche C. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1458-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 18Heymann J.B. Engel A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1039-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 19Delamarche C.

News Physiol. Sci. 1998; 13: 137-142PubMed Google Scholar). This conclusion has been recently reinforced following three-dimensional crystallography and molecular modeling reports. On the other hand, velocity sedimentation experiments reveal that aquaporins and GlpF present different oligomeric states in nondenaturing detergents (2Borgnia M.J. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2888-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 14Manley D.M. McComb M.E. Perreault H. Donald L.J. Duckworth H.W. O'Neil J.D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 6817-6819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We have shown that replacement of two amino acids in the upper part of the sixth transmembrane domain of AQPcic by the two corresponding amino acids of GlpF induced a switch from a water to a glycerol channel and from a tetrameric to a monomeric state in nondenaturing detergent (20Lagree V. Froger A. Deschamps S. Hubert J.F. Delamarche C. Bonnec G. Thomas D. Gouranton J. Pellerin I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6817-6819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This leads us to hypothesize that oligomeric state of MIP proteins and/or strength of monomer association could be involved in functional specificity determinism. Based on knowledge about the importance of loop E in pore formation, we undertook the present study in which loop E and the C-terminal part (including the major part of the sixth transmembrane domain) of AQPcic and GlpF were exchanged. We then assessed expression, targeting, function, and oligomerization state of resulting chimeras in oocytes.Xenopus oocytes have been largely used as an experimental system for expression and functional analysis of heterologous proteins (32Tsiuriupa G.P. Pashkov V.N. Mol. Biol. (Mosk.). 1994; 28: 725-737PubMed Google Scholar) even if expression and targeting mechanisms remain partly unexplained. Unexpressed or misrouted aquaporin mutants for some aquaporins (AQP1, AQP2, and AQPcic) have been previously described in the Xenopus oocytes system (3Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lagree V. Pellerin I. Hubert J.F. Tacnet F., Le Caherec F. Roudier N. Thomas D. Gouranton J. Deschamps S.

Rijss J.P. Van Os C.H. Deen P.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 242-248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); in the present study, we observed that one of the chimeras (AGA) was not expressed in oocyte. Yeast cells, which generally allow the easy production of high level of recombinant aquaporins like the AQPcic-C134S mutant (10Lagree V. Froger A. Deschamps S. Pellerin I. Delamarche C. Bonnec G. Gouranton J. Thomas D. Hubert J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33949-33953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), appear to be a complementary system to Xenopus oocyte and have been used in this study to express all wild type proteins and chimeras, including AGA.When proteins were expressed in oocytes, as verified by Western blotting experiments, immunocytochemistry revealed that the major part of wild-type AQPcic is targeted to the plasma membrane. GlpF is shown to be functional in oocytes but is found partially retained into cytoplasmic fraction, as are all chimeras bearing the C-terminal part of the glycerol channel of E. coli (AAG, AGG, GAG). We also observed that chimeras that correspond to GlpF substituted in loop E and/or TM 6 by the equivalent domains of AQPcic (GGA and GAA) are properly expressed but are not fully targeted to plasma membrane.AGG and GAG are found partially targeted to plasma membrane but do not exhibit water or glycerol channel function. They exhibit a major monomeric state and minor oligomeric forms. AAG is the only chimera evidenced as a functional water channel in oocytes and is the only one with an homotetrameric oligomerization state like wild type AQPcic. This suggests that the distal part of TM 6 and the C-terminal part are not specifically involved in tetramerization and selectivity of the aquaporin. The water permeability of the AAG protein is inhibited by mercury chloride. We previously demonstrated that cysteine 82 in loop B of AQPcic is the unique mercury binding site (25Lagree V. Pellerin I. Hubert J.F. Tacnet F., Le Caherec F. Roudier N. Thomas D. Gouranton J. Deschamps S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12422-12426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Loop B has not been replaced in the AAG chimera, and the modification introduced in the aquaporin does not influence the accessibility of mercury ions. Oocytes expressing AAG protein present a lower water permeability than oocytes expressing AQPcic for a saturating amount of injected cRNA. Immunocytochemistry suggests that this difference in measured water permeability is a consequence of protein misrouting in the oocyte system rather than a crucial implication of the substituted domain in channel efficiency. In parallel, we noticed that all chimeras described in this paper and AQPcic, when truncated in its C-terminal part, are more sensitive to proteolysis in both expression systems than are wild type proteins (data not shown). The extramembranous C-terminal part of the aquaporin thus appears unnecessary for pore formation and selectivity, but it may be involved in tetramer folding or protein stability.The presence of half of the sixth transmembrane domain and the C-terminal part of GlpF in the AQPcic protein is thus compatible with tetrameric association and water channel function. This observation is in agreement with three-dimensional data (5Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heymann J.B. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y.

We additionally noted that, if the AAG chimera exhibit an oligomerization state and functional characteristics identical to the wild-type AQPcic, the corresponding substitution in GlpF (the GGA chimera) leads to a protein that remains monomeric but t"

The inwardly rectifying K+ channel, Kir1.1 (ROMK) appears to form the pore of the channel, and mutations in Kir1.1 are responsible for Bartter syndrome. The native channel is sensitive to inhibition by the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, and it has been proposed that an accessory protein is required to confer glibenclamide sensitivity to Kir1.1. Several recent studies have suggested that the native channel is composed of the splice variant Kir1.1b (ROMK2) and the sulfonylurea receptor isoform SUR2B and that there is a direct physical interaction between these subunits. In this study, we have monitored the interaction between Kir1.1b and SUR2B. We find that SUR2B reaches the plasma membrane when coexpressed with Kir6.1 or Kir6.2 but not when coexpressed with Kir1.1b. Furthermore, we find that Kir1.1b exhibits an intrinsic sensitivity to inhibition by glibenclamide with an affinity similar to the native channel. These results demonstrate that SUR2B does not traffic to the membrane in the presence of Kir1.1b and is not required to confer glibenclamide sensitivity to Kir1.1b.

ATP-binding cassette hemagglutinin endoplasmic reticulum cystic fibrosis conductance regulator sulfonylurea receptor phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate The principal mechanism of K+ excretion by the body is the selective secretion of K+ by the kidney. This is achieved by the renal cortical collecting duct principal cells where K+ is secreted into the urine through the apical ATP-regulated secretory K+ channel (1Wang W. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 413-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 2Giebisch G. Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 436-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Studies of cloned channels have shown that the inwardly rectifying K+channel Kir1.1 (ROMK) is expressed in the apical membrane of these cells (3Mennitt P.A. Wade J.B. Ecelbarger C.A. Palmer L.G. Frindt G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and possesses very similar conductive and kinetic properties to the native channel (4Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 5Palmer L.G. Choe H. Frindt G. Am. J. Physiol. (Cell Physiol.). 1997; 273: F404-F410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further evidence to support the role of this channel comes from genetically inherited mutations in Kir1.1, which are responsible for Type II Bartter syndrome (6Simon D.B. Karet F.E. Rodriguez-Soriano J. Hamdan J.H. DiPietro A Trachtman H Sanjad S.A. Lifton R.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). However, the native channel is inhibited by the sulfonylurea drug glibenclamide (7Wang T. Wang W.H. Klein-Robbenhaar G. Giebisch G. Ren. Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 18: 169-182PubMed Google Scholar), and several studies on Kir1.1 have suggested that this property is lacking in the cloned channel (8Ruknudin A. Schulze D.H. Sullivan S.K. Lederer W.J. Welling P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14165-14171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 9Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol. (Renal Physiol.). 2000; 278: F659-F666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This apparent difference in pharmacology has led to the assumption that Kir1.1 associates with an additional “regulatory” subunit in vivo that would confer sensitivity to glibenclamide (1Wang W. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 413-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify this missing subunit, comparisons have been drawn with the classic ATP-sensitive (KATP) potassium channel that regulates insulin secretion from the pancreatic β-cell and that is also inhibited by glibenclamide. The β-cell KATP channel consists of an inwardly rectifying K+ channel (Kir6.2) that physically associates with the sulfonylurea receptor, SUR1. This regulatory subunit confers the stimulatory effect of nucleotides as well as high affinity inhibition by glibenclamide (10Ashcroft F.M. Gribble F.M. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 903-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). A similar KATP channel found in the heart is also comprised of Kir6.2 and a related sulfonylurea receptor, SUR2A (11Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P. Wang C.Z. Aguilar Bryan L. Bryan J. Seino S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1011-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Both SUR1 and SUR2A are members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)1 superfamily of transporters and are related to the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (CFTR), which is also inhibited by glibenclamide (12Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 707: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It has therefore been proposed that the missing regulatory subunit may be a renal ABC transporter that couples to Kir1.1 (1Wang W. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 413-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Both CFTR and an SUR2A splice variant (SUR2B) are expressed in the cortical collecting duct (9Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K.

Pflügers Arch. 1999; 438: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and studies have shown that both of these ABC transporters appear to confer glibenclamide sensitivity to Kir1.1 when coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes (8Ruknudin A.

Both SUR2B and CFTR have therefore been proposed as potential candidates for the “missing regulatory subunit.” Recent studies on the interaction between Kir1.1 and SUR2B have proposed that it is an N-terminal splice variant of Kir1.1 referred to as Kir1.1b (ROMK2) that physically associates with SUR2B to form the native channel (9Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol. (Renal Physiol.). 2000; 278: F659-F666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another recent study has suggested that this functional and physical association is governed by a motif in the intracellular N terminus of Kir1.1 (17Dong K., Xu, J. Vanoye C.G. Welch R.

Studies on the assembly of classic KATP channels formed by members of the Kir6.0 subfamily coexpressed with a sulfonylurea receptor have shown that the correct stoichiometry of assembly is achieved by the presence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signals on the intracellular domains of both subunits (18Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 19Schwappach B. Zerangue N. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

These ER retention signals cause both subunits to be retained within the cell unless correctly coassembled into an octameric (4 + 4) complex. The ER retention signal is an “RKR” motif located on the distal C terminus of Kir6.2 and Kir6.1, whereas on SUR1 it is adjacent to the first nucleotide-binding fold. SUR2A contains a similar although not identical (RKQ) motif, but this also functions as a retention signal, causing it to be retained within the cell unless coexpressed with either Kir6.1 or Kir6.2. 2Blanche Schwappach, personal communication. SUR2B differs from SUR2A only in the last 42 amino acids (20Isomoto S. Kondo C. Yamada M. Matsumoto S. Higashiguchi O. Horio Y. Matsuzawa Y. Kurachi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24321-24324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) and thus also contains an ER retention signal. However, the role of this motif in the trafficking of SUR2B has not been assessed. Therefore, the recent reports that SUR2B associates with Kir1.1b to confer glibenclamide sensitivity (9Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol. (Renal Physiol.). 2000; 278: F659-F666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Dong K., Xu, J. Vanoye C.G. Welch R. MacGregor G.G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44347-44353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) suggest either that SUR2B is capable of independent trafficking to the membrane or that Kir1.1b physically associates with SUR2B to form functional complexes that can then traffic to the plasma membrane. In this study, we assessed the functional interaction between Kir1.1b and SUR2B coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes. In addition to measuring channel activity, we also monitored the surface expression of SUR2B using the chemiluminescent antibody detection method developed by Zerangue et al. (18Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) and Schwappach et al. (19Schwappach B. Zerangue N. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 26: 155-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We found that the ER retention motif on SUR2B causes it to be retained within the cell and that it does not traffic to the membrane in the presence of Kir1.1b. Furthermore, we also found that Kir1.1b can be directly inhibited by glibenclamide in the absence of SUR2B and that detection of this inhibitory effect is dependent upon the methods used to study channel activity. These observations therefore demonstrate that Kir1.1b has an intrinsic sensitivity to glibenclamide that does not depend upon the presence of SUR2B. These results have important implications for the presumed structure of the native ATP-regulated secretory K+ channel. Rat Kir1.1a, Kir4.1, and SUR2B and mouse Kir2.1, Kir6.1, and Kir6.2 were subcloned in the oocyte expression vector pBF. For surface expression studies, rat SUR2B had the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope introduced at the same site as in SUR1 (18Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 19Schwappach B. Zerangue N. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 26: 155-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. B. Schwappach, Heidelberg, Germany). N-terminal deletion of the first 19 amino acids of Kir1.1a to generate Kir1.1b (ROMK2) (21Zhou H. Tate S. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. (Cell Physiol.). 1994; 266: C809-C824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was performed by PCR. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange XL protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to engineer SUR2BR-KHA. Capped mRNAs were synthesized in vitro by using the T7 or SP6 mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared and injected as described (22Konstas A.A. Bielfeld-Ackermann A. Korbmacher C. Pflügers Arch. 2001; 442: 752-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Defolliculated oocytes were injected with various cRNA combinations. For each potassium channel, 1 ng of cRNA was used, whereas 20 ng of cRNA was used for SUR2B. Injected oocytes were kept in modified Barth's saline (in mm: 88, NaCl; 1, KCl; 2.4, NaHCO3; 0.3, Ca(NO3)2; 0.41, CaCl2; 0.82, MgSO4; 15, HEPES; adjusted to pH 7.6 with Tris). Using the pBF expression vectors, we observed near maximal expression of Kir6.2/SUR2B currents after 36–48 h (not shown). Thus, all oocytes were studied 2 days after injection using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique as described previously (22Konstas A.A. Bielfeld-Ackermann A. Korbmacher C. Pflügers Arch. 2001; 442: 752-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Using protocols similar to those described by Tanemotoet al. (9Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol. (Renal Physiol.). 2000; 278: F659-F666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), oocytes were routinely clamped at a holding potential of −80 mV and intermittently pulsed over the range of −160 to +40 mV in 20-mV steps, each lasting 400 ms. Reported K+ current values refer to those measured at a holding potential of −140 mV during the last 100 ms of a pulse. Glibenclamide (Sigma) was prepared as a 200 mm stock solution in Me2SO. The glibenclamide-sensitive current was determined by subtracting the corresponding value measured in the presence of 0.2 mm glibenclamide from that measured prior to the application of glibenclamide in a 1 mm external KCl solution (in mm: 96, NaCl; 1, KCl; 1.8, CaCl2; 1, MgCl2; 5, HEPES; adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris). In all batches of oocytes tested, coexpression of Kir6.2 or Kir6.1 with SUR2B resulted in typical KATP K+ currents activated by exposure to 3 mm sodium azide. Under “Results,” data are given as mean values ± S.E. nindicates the number of oocytes, and N indicates the number of different batches of oocytes used; significance was evaluated by the appropriate version of Student's t test. For macroscopic recordings from giant excised inside-out patches, the patch pipettes were pulled from thick-walled borosilicate glass and had resistances of 250–500 kiloohms when filled with pipette solution. Macroscopic currents were recorded at a holding potential of 0 mV and at 20–24 °C (23Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ammala C. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Currents were evoked by repetitive 3-s voltage ramps from −110 mV to +100 mV and recorded as described previously (23Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ammala C. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The pipette (external) solution contained (in mm): 140, KCl; 1.2, MgCl2; 2.6, CaCl2; 10, HEPES (pH 7.4 with KOH). The intracellular (bath) solution contained (in mm): 110, KCl; 1.4, MgCl2; 10, EGTA; 10, HEPES (pH 7.5 with KOH; final [K+] ∼115 mm). 0.1 mmMgATP was added to the bath solution to prevent rundown of channel activity. The pH of the solution was readjusted after addition of the MgATP and glibenclamide. Rapid exchange of solutions was achieved by positioning the patch in the mouth of one of a series of adjacent inflow pipes placed in the bath. The slope conductance was measured by fitting a straight line to the current-voltage relation between −20 mV and −100 mV. Conductance was measured from an average of five consecutive ramps in each solution. In ∼50% of patches, currents ran down with time in a linear fashion. To control for rundown, a straight line was fitted to the decay of the slope conductance in control solution and extrapolated to the same time point at which the slope conductance was measured in the presence of drug. This value was then taken as the control slope conductance level. Responses to glibenclamide were expressed relative to the conductance measured in control solution before the application of glibenclamide. The concentration-response curve was constructed by expressing the conductance in the presence of glibenclamide (G) as a fraction of that in control solution (GC). Experiments were essentially performed as recently described (18Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 22Konstas A.A. Bielfeld-Ackermann A. Korbmacher C. Pflügers Arch. 2001; 442: 752-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) using 1 μg/ml rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (clone 3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as primary antibody and 2 μg/ml peroxidase-conjugated affinity-purified F(ab′)2 fragment goat anti-rat IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) as secondary antibody. Surface expression is expressed in 1000 relative light units/15 s/oocyte. We first sought to reproduce the reported functional interaction between Kir1.1b and SUR2B (9Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol. (Renal Physiol.). 2000; 278: F659-F666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Dong K., Xu, J. Vanoye C.G. Welch R. MacGregor G.G. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44347-44353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effects of glibenclamide (0.2 mm) on Kir1.1b expressed in Xenopus oocytes either with or without coexpression of SUR2B. We measured macroscopic whole cell currents by two-electrode voltage clamp before and after the application of 0.2 mm glibenclamide (Fig.1A). A low external [K+] bath solution was used as this has been reported to be required for optimal inhibition by glibenclamide (9Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol. (Renal Physiol.). 2000; 278: F659-F666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Dong K., Xu, J. Vanoye C.G. Welch R. MacGregor G.G. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44347-44353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Fig.1A shows a continuous whole cell current recording at a holding potential of −80 mV made from an oocyte expressing Kir1.1b alone. After 2 min, glibenclamide has only a small inhibitory effect. The remaining currents could be inhibited by 5 mmBa2+, indicating that they are K+ selective. Additional voltage step protocols were performed at the times indicated by asterisks. These are shown in Fig. 1B, which demonstrates that similar results were obtained in oocytes coexpressing Kir1.1b and SUR2B. Fig. 1C summarizes the inhibitory effect of 0.2 mm glibenclamide after 2 min on Ba2+-sensitive K+ currents recorded from both Kir1.1a and Kir1.1b in the presence and absence of coexpressed SUR2B. As a control, Kir6.2 was coexpressed with SUR2B to form functional glibenclamide-sensitive KATP channels. The results show that after 2 min, 0.2 mm glibenclamide inhibited Kir6.2/SUR2B currents by 96.0 ± 0.4% (n = 7;N = 1; p < 0.001), whereas Kir1.1a and Kir1.1b currents were only inhibited by 13.0 ± 3.1% (n = 21; N = 3; p < 0.001) and 10.3 ± 1.7% (n = 21;N = 3; p < 0.001), respectively. Coexpression of SUR2B did not alter the glibenclamide sensitivity of either Kir1.1a or Kir1.1b since 0.2 mm glibenclamide inhibited Kir1.1a/SUR2B and Kir1.1b/SUR2B currents by 12.5 ± 1.9% (n = 21; N = 3; p< 0.001) and 12.1 ± 2.7% (n = 21;N = 3; p < 0.001), respectively. Given the limited inhibition of Kir1.1b/SUR2B currents by 0.2 mm glibenclamide after 2 min, we next examined the effects of longer exposure to glibenclamide. Fig.2A shows that significant glibenclamide inhibition of Kir1.1b currents could be observed after 10 min. However, this did not depend on the presence of coexpressed SUR2B. Fig. 2 (B and C) shows that Kir1.1b currents exhibited similar levels of inhibition in the absence of coexpressed SUR2B. The application of 0.2 mm glibenclamide for 10 min inhibited Kir1.1b and Kir1.1b/SUR2B currents by 58.1 ± 5.1% (n = 7; N = 1; p < 0.001) and 54.7 ± 6.4% (n = 7; N= 1; p < 0.001), respectively (Fig. 2C). The block of Kir1.1b currents by glibenclamide was not voltage-dependent since the currents showed similar levels of inhibition when recorded at +40 mV: Kir1.1b and Kir1.1b/SUR2B currents were inhibited by 57.7 ± 5.9% (n = 7;N = 1; p < 0.001) and 53.9 ± 5.4% (n = 7; N = 1; p< 0.001), respectively. These results clearly demonstrate that Kir1.1b possesses an intrinsic sensitivity to high concentrations of glibenclamide which can only be observed after long periods of exposure. They also demonstrate that coexpression of SUR2B does not affect the inhibition of Kir1.1a or Kir1.1b by 0.2 mm glibenclamide. Given the lack of effect of SUR2B coexpression upon the glibenclamide sensitivity of Kir1.1b we next examined the role of the ER retention signal in SUR2B and whether SUR2B actually reaches the plasma membrane in the presence of Kir1.1b. To detect the surface expression of SUR2B, we used a variant that had an HA antigen epitope engineered into an extracellular loop (SUR2B-HA) (19Schwappach B. Zerangue N. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 26: 155-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This epitope permits detection of SUR2B in the plasma membrane by chemiluminescent detection of anti-HA antibody binding. Fig.3 shows that like SUR1 and SUR2A, SUR2B-HA does not reach the plasma membrane when expressed by itself. However, when coexpressed with Kir6.2, surface labeling could be detected, thus indicating the presence of SUR2B in the surface plasma membrane of the oocytes. Similar surface expression of SUR2B-HA could also be detected when coexpressed with Kir6.1 (not shown). This also correlated with the formation of functional KATP channels in these oocytes (not shown). However, Fig. 3 also demonstrates that no surface expression could be detected when SUR2B-HA was coexpressed with Kir1.1b, Kir2.1, or Kir4.1. These groups all expressed K+-selective currents about 10-fold larger than the Kir6.2/SUR2B-HA currents (not shown). Assuming a similar stoichiometry of assembly between Kir1.1b and SUR2B-HA as found between Kir6.2 and SUR2A (19Schwappach B. Zerangue N. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 26: 155-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we would expect a larger surface labeling signal in the Kir1.1b/SUR2B-HA oocytes as compared with the Kir6.2/SUR2B-HA oocytes. Instead, the surface labeling in the Kir1.1b/SUR2B-HA oocytes was not different from H2O-injected controls or SUR2B-HA coexpressed with Kir2.1 or Kir4.1. This indicates that virtually no SUR2B-HA is detectable in the surface membrane of these oocytes and is consistent with previous studies demonstrating the specificity of interaction between Kir6.0 subunits and sulfonylurea receptors (18Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 19Schwappach B. Zerangue N. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 26: 155-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar,24Clement J.P. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Given that SUR2B is unlikely to confer glibenclamide sensitivity to Kir1.1b if it is not present in the plasma membrane, we next examined whether SUR2B could alter the glibenclamide sensitivity of Kir1.1b when both subunits were present in the plasma membrane at the same time. We therefore confirmed that the RKQ ER retention signal in SUR2B was responsible for its lack of surface expression inXenopus oocytes. Fig.4A shows that coexpression with Kir1.1b does not permit trafficking of SUR2B-HA to the plasma membrane but that when the ER retention signal is mutated to “KKQ” (SUR2BR-K-HA), the mutant SUR2BR-K-HA subunits traffic independently to the plasma membrane. Fig. 4A also shows that coexpression of Kir1.1b with SUR2BR-K-HA did not affect trafficking of SUR2BR-K-HA to the plasma membrane. We therefore examined the glibenclamide sensitivity of the Kir1.1b channels coexpressed with SUR2BR-K-HA where both subunits were clearly present in the plasma membrane at the same time. Fig.4B shows that a 10-min exposure to 0.2 mmglibenclamide inhibits Kir1.1b/SUR2BR-K-HA currents by almost 50%. However, Fig. 4C shows that this degree of inhibition is no different from that seen when Kir1.1b is expressed alone (or with SUR2B-HA, as shown in Fig. 2C). 0.2 mm glibenclamide inhibited Kir1.1b and Kir1.1b/SUR2BR-K-HA currents by 54.7 ± 6.4% (n = 7; N = 1) and 50.7 ± 10.1% (n = 21; N = 3), respectively. One explanation for the relatively slow inhibition of Kir1.1 currents observed in whole cell two-electrode voltage clamp recordings is that inhibition occurs via an intracellular site. It would therefore take longer for high concentrations of glibenclamide to equilibrate across the vitelline and plasma membranes of oocytes when applied extracellularly. By contrast, Kir6.2/SUR currents are sensitive to inhibition by nanomolar concentrations of glibenclamide, and thus, rapid inhibition can be observed even when low concentrations of drug are applied (10Ashcroft F.M. Gribble F.M. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 903-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). This time dependence of inhibition may also explain the variability in the reported effects of glibenclamide on Kir1.1, depending on how long after the application inhibition is measured. We therefore used giant inside-out patches excised from Xenopus oocytes expressing Kir1.1b to examine the inhibitory effect of glibenclamide. Fig. 5A shows that K+ currents recorded from inside-out macropatches excised from oocytes expressing Kir1.1b are inhibited directly by glibenclamide. The inhibition by glibenclamide is concentration-dependent, and the mean data (Fig.5B) suggest a half-maximal inhibition around 150–200 μm glibenclamide. The observed rundown of channel activity is characteristic of Kir1.1b behavior in excised patches (21Zhou H. Tate S. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. (Cell Physiol.). 1994; 266: C809-C824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 50 μm glibenclamide inhibits 28.2 ± 4.5% (n = 6; N = 2), 0.2 mminhibits 54.1 ± 3.9% (n = 15; N= 2), and 0.5 mm inhibits 74.9 ± 8.1% (n = 5; N = 2) of the current in control (drug-free) solution. These results clearly show that high concentrations of glibenclamide can cause significant inhibition of Kir1.1b currents. Furthermore, the effect is rapid (within seconds) and reversible. In this study, we have demonstrated that Kir1.1b possesses an intrinsic sensitivity to inhibition by glibenclamide that is similar to the native renal ATP-regulated secretory K+ channel. Our results indicate that the reported variability in sensitivity of Kir1.1b to glibenclamide is probably due to differences in the experimental protocols used to study channel activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an ER retention signal prevents SUR2B from trafficking to the plasma membrane when coexpressed with Kir1.1b, and therefore, SUR2B cannot confer glibenclamide sensitivity to Kir1.1b. We also show that even if SUR2B is mutated to traffic to the plasma membrane, it does not influence the intrinsic glibenclamide sensitivity of Kir1.1b. Thus, contrary to recent reports, our results demonstrate that SUR2B is unlikely to be a component of the native renal secretory K+channel and that Kir1.1 does not require an accessory subunit to be inhibited by glibenclamide. One of the principal aims of this study was to investigate recent reports that the renal ATP-regulated secretory K+ channel is comprised of Kir1.1b and SUR2B. The studies by Tanemoto et al. (9Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol. (Renal Physiol.). 2000; 278: F659-F666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Dong et al. (17Dong K., Xu, J. Vanoye C.G. Welch R. MacGregor G.G. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44347-44353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have reported a physical association between these two subunits as evidenced by coimmunoprecipitation of in vitro translated Kir1.1b and SUR2B. Their studies also reported that Kir1.1b exhibits no intrinsic sensitivity to inhibition by glibenclamide but that coexpression with SUR2B “restores” sensitivity of the channel to 0.2 mmglibenclamide. However, there are certain difficulties associated with the hypothesis that SUR2B associates with Kir1.1b to form the native channel. Firstly, only very high concentrations of glibenclamide have been shown to inhibit Kir1.1b/SUR2B channels (9Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol. (Renal Physiol.). 2000; 278: F659-F666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Dong K., Xu, J. Vanoye C.G. Welch R. MacGregor G.G. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44347-44353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which does not correlate with the high affinity interaction of glibenclamide with SUR2B (10Ashcroft F.M. Gribble F.M. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 903-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 25Russ U. Hambrook A. Artunc F. Loffler-Walz C. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. Quast U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 955-961Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Secondly, studies with other sulfonylurea receptors suggest that SUR2B is unlikely to traffic to the plasma membrane in the presence of Kir1.1 (18Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 19Schwappach B. Zerangue N. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 26: 155-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It is essential to distinguish between the reported effects of glibenclamide at low (nm) concentrations and its effects at high (from μm to mm) concentrations. Although high affinity inhibition of the classic KATP channels (Kir6.0/SUR) by nanomolar concentrations of glibenclamide is one of the hallmark features of these channels (10Ashcroft F.M. Gribble F.M. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 903-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 25Russ U. Hambrook A. Artunc F. Loffler-Walz C. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. Quast U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 955-961Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), it is well known that high concentrations of glibenclamide can interact with other membrane proteins. Examples of its wide-ranging influences include effects on volume-sensitive anion channels (26Best L. Benington S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 874-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), outwardly rectifying chloride channels (27Volk T. Rabe A. Korbmacher C. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 5: 222-231Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), voltage-gated K+ channels (28Yao X. Chang A.Y. Boulpaep E.L. Segal A.S. Desir G.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2525-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and epithelial Na+ channels (29Chrabi A. Horisberger J.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 341-347PubMed Google Scholar). The response of a channel to glibenclamide does not therefore automatically implicate the involvement of a classic sulfonylurea receptor subunit. The fact that SUR subunits are ABC transporters has also led to the suggestion that glibenclamide may interact with other ABC transporters. Effects of glibenclamide have been observed on both CFTR (12Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 707: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and P-glycoprotein function (30Golstein P.E. Boom A. van Geffel J. Jacobs P. Masereel B. Beauwens R. Pflügers Arch. 1999; 437: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), but again, only at relatively high concentrations when compared with the nanomolar affinity of the sulfonylurea receptors. Using the inhibitory effect of high concentrations of glibenclamide as a hallmark for correlating cloned channel behavior with that of native channels is therefore potentially confusing. Indeed, we and others have shown previously that high concentrations of glibenclamide and other sulfonylureas such as tolbutamide can inhibit Kir6.2 channel activity directly and that it is essential to take this low affinity inhibition into account when interpreting the mechanism of KATP channel block by sulfonylureas (23Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ammala C. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 31Gros L. Virsolvy A. Salazar G. Bataille D. Blache P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 32Gribble F.M. Tucker S.J. Seino S. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1412-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is perhaps not surprising that other related channels such as Kir1.1 also exhibit a similar intrinsic sensitivity to high concentrations of glibenclamide. The original study that reported the cloning of Kir1.1b (ROMK2) demonstrated a clear but variable inhibition of Kir1.1b currents by 0.2 mm glibenclamide (21Zhou H. Tate S. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. (Cell Physiol.). 1994; 266: C809-C824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have also reported either limited or no inhibition of Kir1.1b currents by high concentrations of glibenclamide (9Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol. (Renal Physiol.). 2000; 278: F659-F666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16McNicholas C.M. Guggino W.B. Schwiebert E.M. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Egan M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our results suggest that this variability depends on the experimental methods and parameters used to study Kir1.1. In most cases, whole cell macroscopic currents are recorded by two-electrode voltage clamp (9Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol.

Chudziak F. Moshiri A. Panten U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 113: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is clear from the results shown in Fig. 5 that 0.2 mm glibenclamide can inhibit Kir1.1b channel activity rapidly and reversibly when applied to the intracellular surface of an excised patch. However, when measuring whole cell currents by two-electrode voltage clamp, it may take significantly longer for high concentrations of glibenclamide to equilibrate across the plasma membrane of the oocytes when applied extracellularly. This might account for the time dependence of inhibition that we observe and for the variability in the reported effects of glibenclamide, depending on how long after application the channel activity is measured. Although we have not calculated a full dose response curve, Fig.5B illustrates that 0.2 mm glibenclamide inhibits channel activity by slightly greater than 50%. This suggests that half-maximal inhibition occurs in the 150–200 μmrange. This value is remarkably similar to that reported for the inhibition of the native channel (150 μm) (7Wang T. Wang W.H. Klein-Robbenhaar G. Giebisch G. Ren. Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 18: 169-182PubMed Google Scholar). This study shows a lack of functional interaction between Kir1.1b and SUR2B. However, previous studies have reported that Kir1.1b and SUR2B can physically associate when cotranslated in vitro (9Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol. (Renal Physiol.). 2000; 278: F659-F666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Dong K., Xu, J. Vanoye C.G. Welch R. MacGregor G.G. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44347-44353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This suggests that Kir1.1b may nevertheless be capable of associating with SUR2B to form Kir1.1b/SUR2B channel complexes in vivo. Although the role of the ER retention signals in SUR1 and SUR2A has been well studied (18Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 19Schwappach B. Zerangue N. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 26: 155-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), the role of the RKQ motif in SUR2B has not been analyzed. Our results demonstrate that this motif causes SUR2B to be retained inside the cell unless coexpressed with Kir6.2. We also found that Kir1.1b, Kir2.1, and Kir4.1 were unable to promote trafficking of SUR2B to the plasma membrane. Such results are consistent with previous reports that only Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 can physically associate with SUR1 or SUR2A (18Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 19Schwappach B. Zerangue N. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that SUR2B does not appear in the plasma membrane when coexpressed with Kir1.1b. Thus, it is unlikely that SUR2B can functionally couple glibenclamide sensitivity to Kir1.1b when they are coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes. However, by mutating the ER retention signal in SUR2B, we were able to express both Kir1.1b and SUR2B in the plasma membrane at the same time. Nevertheless, even when both proteins were present together, SUR2B still had no effect on the intrinsic glibenclamide sensitivity of Kir1.1b. This indicates that the lack of functional coupling in vivo is probably due to a lack of physical association. This is in contrast to the reported physical association of Kir1.1b and SUR2B analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation of in vitro translated proteins (9Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol. (Renal Physiol.). 2000; 278: F659-F666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,17Dong K., Xu, J. Vanoye C.G. Welch R. MacGregor G.G. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44347-44353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We are unable to reconcile these differences other than to suggest that the interactions observed in vitro may not reflect the behavior of these integral membrane proteins in vivo. Our results do not support a role for SUR2B as a component of the renal secretory K+ channel. Furthermore, our results indicate that there is no requirement for an additional subunit to confer glibenclamide sensitivity to Kir1.1b. Thus, the physiological role of SUR2B in the cortical collecting duct principal cell remains unclear. However, Kir6.1 expression has been reported in these cells (34Anzai N. Izumida I. Inagaki N. Seino S. Kawahara K. Jpn. J. Physiol. 1997; 47: S10-S11PubMed Google Scholar), and it remains possible that SUR2B and Kir6.1 associate to form a classic KATP channel, although to date, no KATP-like currents have been recorded in these cells. Many different studies have shown that Kir1.1b has conductive and kinetic properties that are very similar to those of the native channel (5Palmer L.G. Choe H. Frindt G. Am. J. Physiol. (Cell Physiol.). 1997; 273: F404-F410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Zhou H. Tate S. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. (Cell Physiol.). 1994; 266: C809-C824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this study now demonstrates that another distinguishing characteristic of the native channel (i.e. glibenclamide sensitivity) is intrinsic to Kir1.1b. It is thus tempting to speculate that the native channel is simply Kir1.1 (or a splice variant) and that no additional subunits are required. However, two principal concerns remain regarding the identity of the channel, and we have not directly addressed these issues in this study. Firstly, is the ATP regulation of Kir1.1 identical to that of the native channel? Secondly, what is the role of CFTR? The regulation of the channel by ATP is complex. Low levels of MgATP are required to maintain the activity of the native channel, but higher (mm) concentrations inhibit channel activity (1Wang W. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 413-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, there is some controversy regarding the ATP sensitivity of the cloned channel. It has been reported that Kir1.1b channels can be inhibited by ATP (35McNicholas C.M. Yang Y. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. (Renal Physiol.). 1996; 271: F275-F285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but that Kir1.1a is insensitive to ATP (4Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Some of these differences may be accounted for by the fact that Kir1.1 channels can also be activated by PIP2 (36Leung Y.M. Zeng W.Z. Liou H.H. Solaro C.R. Huang C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10182-10189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with a requirement for MgATP in the generation of PIP2 by lipid kinases. The effects of ATP therefore can vary depending upon the presence or absence of different kinases under different metabolic and experimental conditions. The effect of CFTR coexpression on Kir1.1 activity is equally complex. CFTR coexpression has been reported to influence a variety of Kir1.1 properties including its single channel conductance (8Ruknudin A. Schulze D.H. Sullivan S.K. Lederer W.J. Welling P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14165-14171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), sensitivity to ATP and glibenclamide (8Ruknudin A. Schulze D.H. Sullivan S.K. Lederer W.J.

May 6, 2002; 10.1074/jbc.M201925200Google Scholar). Based upon our results, it is now clear that an accessory subunit is not required to confer glibenclamide sensitivity upon Kir1.1. However, whether there is a more complex role for CFTR in influencing Kir1.1 channel activity in vivo remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2033163508,"Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) acts as a sliding clamp on duplex DNA. Its homologs, present in Eukarya and Archaea, are part of protein complexes that are indispensable for DNA replication and DNA repair. In Eukarya, PCNA is known to interact with more than a dozen different proteins, including a human major nuclear uracil-DNA glycosylase (hUNG2) involved in immediate postreplicative repair. In Archaea, only three classes of PCNA-binding proteins have been reported previously: replication factor C (the PCNA clamp loader), family B DNA polymerase, and flap endonuclease. In this study, we report a direct interaction between a uracil-DNA glycosylase (Pa-UDGa) and a PCNA homolog (Pa-PCNA1), both from the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum (T(opt) = 100 degrees C). We demonstrate that the Pa-UDGa-Pa-PCNA1 complex is thermostable, and two hydrophobic amino acid residues on Pa-UDGa (Phe(191) and Leu(192)) are shown to be crucial for this interaction. It is interesting to note that although Pa-UDGa has homologs throughout the Archaea and bacteria, it does not share significant sequence similarity with hUNG2. Nevertheless, our results raise the possibility that Pa-UDGa may be a functional analog of hUNG2 for PCNA-dependent postreplicative removal of misincorporated uracil."

In addition, the second lysine in the class I-specific KMSKS signature motif is absent from all known eukaryotic tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase sequences, except those of higher plants. This lysine, which is the most highly conserved residue in the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family, has been shown to interact with the pyrophosphate moiety of the ATP substrate in the Bacillus stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. Equilibrium dialysis and pre-steady-state kinetic analyses were used to determine the role that potassium plays in the tyrosine activation reaction in the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase and whether it can be replaced by any of the other alkali metals. Kinetic analyses indicate that potassium interacts with the pyrophosphate moiety of ATP, stabilizing the E·Tyr·ATP and E·[Tyr-ATP]‡ complexes by 2.3 and 4.3 kcal/mol, respectively. Potassium also appears to stabilize the asymmetric conformation of the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase dimer by 0.7 kcal/mol.

Identifying differences in the catalytic mechanisms of bacterial and human aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases will facilitate the development of antibiotics that selectively target the bacterial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. We are currently investigating the catalytic mechanisms of the human and Bacillus stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases to elucidate the differences between these two enzymes. Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase catalyzes the attachment of tyrosine to tyrosine tRNA (tRNATyr) 1The abbreviations used are: tRNATyrtyrosine tRNATyrRStyrosyl-tRNA synthetase by an ATP-dependent two-step reaction mechanism. In the first step, tyrosine is activated by MgATP to form an enzyme-bound tyrosyl-adenylate intermediate. The second step consists of the transfer of tyrosine to the 3′ end of tRNATyr.TyrRS+Tyr+MgATP⇄TyrRS·Tyr­AMP+PPiEquation 1 TyrRS·Tyr­AMP+tRNATyr⇄TyrRS+Tyr­tRNATyr+AMPEquation 2 Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is a homodimer that displays “half-of-the-sites” reactivity, with only one tyrosyl-adenylate molecule formed per dimer (11Koch G.L. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Koch G.L. Boulanger Y. Hartley B.S. Nature. 1974; 249: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Fersht A.R.

Although most of the active site amino acids are conserved between the human and B. stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases, several differences exist between the two enzymes, including the inability of the human and bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases to aminoacylate each other's tRNATyr (14Kleeman T.A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, sequence analyses indicate that the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is <16% identical to the B. stearothermophilus enzyme and that four of the eighteen active site residues identified in the B. stearothermophilus enzyme, Cys35, His48, Thr51, and Lys233, are not conserved in the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (14Kleeman T.A. Wei D. Simpson K.L. First E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14420-14425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Replacement of three of these four residues (Cys35, His48, and Lys233) in the B. stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase destabilizes the transition state complex for the tyrosine activation step by 1.2, 1.2, and 3.0 kcal/mol, respectively (16Lowe D.M.

Lastly, potassium is required for catalysis of the tyrosine activation reaction in a number of eukaryotic tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases, but not their bacterial homologues (23Austin J. First E.A. J. Biol.

Specifically, the hypothesis that potassium stabilizes the transition state complex for the tyrosine activation reaction through interactions with the pyrophosphate moiety of MgATP is tested. This hypothesis is based on the following reasoning. Stabilization of the transition state for tyrosine activation in B. stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is largely due to the formation of interactions between the pyrophosphate moiety of MgATP and active site amino acids in the enzyme (reviewed in Refs. 27Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8031-8037Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar and 28First E.A. Sinnott M. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. 1. Academic Press Ltd., Portland, OR1998: 573-607Google Scholar). In particular, the second lysine in the KMSKS signature sequence, which is replaced by a serine in the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, stabilizes the transition state for tyrosine activation by 3.0 kcal/mol in the B. stearothermophilus enzyme (14Kleeman T.A. Wei D. Simpson K.L. First E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14420-14425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 19Fersht A.R. Knill-Jones J.W. Bedouelle H. Winter G.

The observation that the stabilities of the transition states for tyrosine activation are virtually identical for the human and B. stearothermophilus enzymes suggests that the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase compensates for the absence of the second lysine in its KMSKS signature sequence. Because potassium is required for catalytic activity in the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, but not in the B. stearothermophilus enzyme, it is a candidate for functionally replacing the second lysine in the active site of the human enzyme. The results presented in this study provide kinetic evidence that potassium stabilizes the transition state complex for tyrosine activation by interacting with the pyrophosphate moiety of ATP. These observations suggest that potassium functionally replaces the second lysine in the KMSKS signature motif, either directly through interactions with the pyrophosphate moiety or indirectly through its effects on active site amino acids in the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. We further show that of the alkali metals, only rubidium can substitute for potassium, indicating that the effects of potassium are ion-specific. Based on the observation that potassium appears to functionally replace the most highly conserved amino acid in the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family, namely, the second lysine in the KMSKS signature sequence, we propose that the replacement of this lysine by potassium provides a selective advantage that has resulted in its presence being maintained in eukaryotic tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases.

Expression and purification of the recombinant human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase from Escherichia coli have been described previously (14Kleeman T.A. Wei D. Simpson K.L. First E.A. J. Biol.

Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar). The concentration of bound tyrosine was determined by subtracting the concentration of tyrosine in the dialysis chamber that contained no enzyme ([TyrFree]) from the concentration of tyrosine in the dialysis chamber containing the enzyme. All kinetic analyses were performed at 25 °C in the standard buffer, which contained 150 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The different metal ions were added, in the form of LiCl, NaCl, KCl, RbCl, or CsCl solutions, to standard buffer at a final concentration of 150 mm. Stopped-flow fluorescence studies were used to monitor the pre-steady-state kinetics for the MgATP dependence of tyrosyl-adenylate formation and the pyrophosphate dependence of the reverse reaction (13Fersht A.R. Mulvey R.S. Koch G.L. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In these studies an SX 18.MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics) was used to monitor the decrease in fluorescence of the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase that is associated with the formation of the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex (·, noncovalent bond; -, covalent bond) and the increase in fluorescence that is associated with the reverse reaction (λex = 295 nm, λem > 320 nm) (23Austin J. First E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14812-14820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the MgATP dependence experiments, one of the syringes of the stopped-flow instrument contained the enzyme (0.3–0.5 μm), whereas the other syringe contained varying concentrations of MgATP. Both syringes contained standard buffer, pyrophosphatase, and 200 μm tyrosine. For the rubidium dependence assay, one syringe contained human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (0.3–0.5 μm), 10 mm MgATP, and pyrophosphatase in standard buffer, whereas the other syringe contained 400 μm tyrosine and varying concentrations of RbCl (5–200 mm). Upon mixing equal volumes from each syringe, the decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein was monitored over time. For analysis of the reverse reaction, the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex was pre-formed by incubating the enzyme in 150 mmTris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 2 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase with 50–100 μm tyrosine and 10 mm MgATP at 25 °C for 1 h (18Wells T.N. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1881-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex was separated from free tyrosine and MgATP by gel filtration on NAP-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with the standard buffer (18Wells T.N. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1881-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The reverse reaction was monitored by mixing varying concentrations of tetrasodium pyrophosphate (Na4PPi) with the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex (0.3 μm) in standard buffer with and without either 75 mm KCl or 100 mm RbCl at 25 °C and measuring the increase in the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein (13Fersht A.R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 14812-14820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). All kinetic data were fit to a single exponential floating end point equation using the Kaleidagraph and Applied Photophysics stopped-flow software packages to determine the observed rate constants. The Kaleidagraph software was used to plot the observed rate constants versus the substrate concentrations and to fit these plots to the following hyperbolic function: kobs=k3[S ]TKd+[S ]TEquation 5 where k3 is the forward rate constant for the formation of tyrosyl-adenylate, [S]T is the total substrate concentration, and Kd is the dissociation constant of the substrate of interest (30Engel, P. C. (1996) Enzymology Labfax 1st Ed., pp. 200–210, jointly published by Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA, and BIOS Scientific Publishers Ltd., Oxford, United KingdomGoogle Scholar). In the absence of potassium, MgATP inhibits the reaction at concentrations above 40 mm. However, the relevant kinetic constants could be determined from the data by fitting the resulting kobsversus [MgATP] plot to the following equation that describes uncompetitive inhibition:kobs=k31+[S]Ki,ATP[S]KATP′1+[S]Ki,ATP+[S]Equation 6 where k3 is the forward rate constant for tyrosine activation, K′ATP is the dissociation constant, and Ki,ATP is the binding constant for ATP at the site of inhibition. A rapid equilibrium assumption is used for the binding of tyrosine and MgATP (23Austin J. First E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14812-14820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Due to the low solubility of the MgPPi complex, it was not possible to reach saturating pyrophosphate concentrations in the pyrophosphate dependence reaction. As a result,k−3 and KPPi could not be independently determined for the reverse reaction. Instead, the reverse reaction was monitored under conditions where KPPi ≫ [PPi], and k−3/KPPi was determined by fitting the data to the resulting linear approximation of Eq. 5. In the absence of either KCl or RbCl, the reaction was sufficiently slow to allow the pre-steady-state kinetics to be monitored using a filter binding assay. In this assay, the enzyme-bound tyrosyl-adenylate complex was prepared as described above using [14C]tyrosine. The TyrRS·[14C]Tyr-AMP complex was preincubated in standard buffer at 25 °C, and the reverse reaction was initiated by the addition of tetrasodium pyrophosphate (0.4–1.8 mm). The reaction was monitored by removing and filtering 25-μl aliquots through nitrocellulose filters over a 5-min time period. The filters were washed with two 5-ml aliquots of ice-cold 150 mm Tris, pH 7.5, dried, and counted by scintillation counting in 5 ml of Cytoscint (Fisher Scientific). The relative free energies for each state along the reaction pathway were calculated from the rate and dissociation constants using the following equations: ΔGTyrRS·Tyr=RTlnKTyrEquation 7 ΔGTyrRS·Tyr·ATP=RTln(KTyrKATP′)Equation 8 ΔG[TyrRS·Tyr­ATP]‡=RTlnkBTh−RTlnk3KTyrKATP′Equation 9 ΔGTyrRS·Tyr­AMP·PPi=−RTlnk3k−3KTyrKATP′Equation 10 ΔGTyrRS·Tyr­AMP=−RTlnk3KPPik−3KTyrKATP′Equation 11 where ΔG is the Gibbs free energy relative to that of the unliganded enzyme (GTyrRS = 0),R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, kB is the Boltzmann constant,h is Planck's constant, and [TyrRS·Tyr-ATP]‡ is the transition state complex (18Wells T.N. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1881-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The Gibbs activation energy for the formation of tyrosyl-adenylate was calculated by taking the difference in free energies between the transition state and the TyrRS·Tyr·ATP complex that immediately precedes the transition state. All free energies are calculated relative to the unliganded enzyme, assuming a standard state of 1 m ATP, 1 m tyrosine, and 1 mpyrophosphate. The stability of the enzyme-bound tyrosyl-adenylate intermediate was determined by measuring the rate for the dissociation of [14C]Tyr-AMP from the TyrRS·[14C]Tyr-AMP complex at 25 °C. The TyrRS·[14C]Tyr-AMP complex was prepared froml-[14C]tyrosine, MgATP, and tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase using the procedure described above. The decay of the complex was measured by adding 200 μl of the TyrRS·[14C]Tyr-AMP complex to standard buffer with and without 150 mm KCl and removing 20-μl aliquots periodically. Each aliquot was added to a 2.5-cm nitrocellulose filter overlaid with 3 ml of ice-cold 150 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. The filters were washed with 5 ml of ice-cold 150 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and dried. The residual TyrRS·[14C]Tyr-AMP bound to the filters was assayed by scintillation counting in 5 ml of Cytoscint scintillation mixture. The rate constant for the dissociation of [14C]Tyr-AMP from the TyrRS·[14C]Tyr-AMP complex (koff) was determined by fitting a plot of the residual radioactivity (cpm) versus time (in minutes) to the first order rate equation. Based on the assumption that potassium has no effect on the binding of tyrosyl-adenylate to the enzyme (kon), the free energy difference for the dissociation of Tyr-AMP in the absence and the presence of potassium was calculated from the following equation: ΔG=RTlnkoff+K+koff−K+Equation 12 where koff+K+and koff−K+ are the rate constants for the dissociation of Tyr-AMP from the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex in the presence and absence of potassium, respectively. To determine whether potassium increases the affinity of human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase for its substrates, the dissociation constants of tyrosine and MgATP were determined in the absence of potassium and compared with the values of the dissociation constants previously determined in the presence of 150 mm KCl (23Austin J. First E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14812-14820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant for tyrosine (KTyr) was determined by equilibrium dialysis. In the absence of potassium,KTyr is 95 ± 10 μm (Fig. 1A). This is ∼3-fold higher than the KTyr value determined in the presence of potassium (Table I). Pre-steady-state kinetic methods were used to determine the dissociation constant of MgATP from the TyrRS·Tyr complex (K′ATP) and the forward rate constant for tyrosine activation (k3). In the absence of potassium, MgATP inhibits the reaction at concentrations above 40 mm (Fig. 1B). This inhibition is not observed when potassium is present (Fig. 1B, inset). By fitting the resulting kobsversus [MgATP] plot to Eq. 6, it was possible to determine k3 and K′ATP, as well as the binding constant for ATP to the site of inhibition, Ki,ATP. The values of k3, K′ATP, and Ki,ATP determined in the absence of potassium are 1.7 ± 0.1 s−1, 71 ± 15 mm, and 43 ± 1 mm, respectively.Table IComparison of binding and rate constants for the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase in the absence and presence of potassium1-aThe standard deviations for three to five repetitions of each experiment are indicated in parentheses.EnzymeKTyr1-bKTyr was determined by equilibrium dialysis at 4 °C.K′ATP1-cK′ATP,k3, and the ratios k3/K′ATP and k−3/KPPi were all determined by pre-steady-state kinetics using stopped-flow fluorescence to monitor changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein at 25 °C.k3k3/K′ATPk−3/KPPiμmmms−1s−1m−1s−1m−1− Potassium95 (±10)71 (±15)1.7 (±0.1)13 (±1)361-dIn the absence of potassium,k−3/KPPi was determined by manual sampling using a filter-based assay.

Open table in a new tab The reverse rate constant (k−3) and the dissociation constant of pyrophosphate (KPPi) cannot be determined independently of each other because the low solubility of the MgPPi complex prevents the use of concentrations sufficient to saturate the enzyme (23Austin J. First E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14812-14820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the k−3/KPPi ratio can be determined by monitoring the reaction under conditions where KPPi ≫ [PPi] and fitting the data to the resulting linear approximation of Eq. 5 (Fig. 1C). The k−3/KPPi ratio was found to decrease by ∼1600-fold in the absence of potassium. A summary of the rate and dissociation constants determined in the absence and presence of potassium is presented in Table I. To quantify the effect of potassium at each step in the reaction pathway, Gibbs free energy values were calculated for each bound state relative to the free energy of the unbound enzyme (Fig. 2). Due to the inability to determine k−3 and KPPiindependently of each other, the free energy of the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP·PPi complex could not be calculated. As a result, the relative stability of the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP·PPicomplex has been omitted from the free energy diagram (Fig. 2). Although potassium has a small effect on the stability of the TyrRS·Tyr complex (0.6 kcal/mol), the primary effect of potassium is on those complexes in which ATP is present. Specifically, potassium stabilizes the TyrRS·Tyr·ATP and TyrRS·[Tyr-ATP]‡complexes by 2.3 and 4.3 kcal/mol, respectively. This interaction appears to involve the pyrophosphate moiety of ATP because potassium has no effect on the stability of the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex. To determine whether potassium affects the rate at which tyrosyl-adenylate dissociates from the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex, the rate constant for the decay of the pre-formed TyrRS·[14C]Tyr- AMP complex (koff) in the absence and presence of potassium was determined. [14C]Tyr-AMP dissociates from the TyrRS·[14C]Tyr-AMP complex with rate constants of 2.3 ± 0.3 × 10−4 s−1 and 7.7 ± 1.0 × 10−5 s−1 in the absence and presence of potassium, respectively (Fig. 3). This effect is specific to potassium because the rate of dissociation in the presence of 150 mmNaCl is the same as that observed in the absence of potassium (data not shown). In the B. stearothermophilus enzyme, dissociation of the TyrRS·[14C]Tyr-AMP complex occurs with a rate constant of 5.7 × 10−5 s−1 (29Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Control experiments showed that there was no loss of enzyme activity after an 8-h incubation at 25 °C, indicating that the decay observed was not due to denaturation of the enzyme (data not shown). The free energy difference for the dissociation of Tyr-AMP in the absence and presence of potassium calculated from Eq. 12 is 0.65 kcal/mol. To determine whether other alkali metal ions can substitute for potassium in the catalytic mechanism of the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, pre-steady-state kinetic methods were used to calculate the observed rate constants (kobs) for the tyrosine activation reaction using 200 μm tyrosine, 10 mm MgATP, and 150 mm lithium, sodium, rubidium, or cesium (Table II). The values for kobs obtained in the presence of lithium, sodium, or cesium are similar to those of kobs when potassium is not present, indicating that they have no significant effect on the catalytic activity of the enzyme. In contrast, rubidium increases kobs by 88-fold when compared with kobs determined in the absence of any ion. Under similar conditions, potassium increases kobs 220-fold. Due to the significant increase in kobs in the presence of rubidium, the catalysis of tyrosine activation by the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was further characterized in the presence of rubidium. Rubidium binds to the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase with an affinity similar to that of potassium (KRb+ = 40 ± 2 mmversus KK+ = 32 ± 2 mm for the dissociation constants of rubidium and potassium, respectively) (Fig. 4). In the presence of 200 mm rubidium, the dissociation constants for tyrosine and MgATP and the forward rate constant are 29 ± 8 μm, 3.2 ± 0.4 mm, and 26 ± 2 s−1, respectively. These values are similar to the values of the constants determined in the presence of potassium (34 ± 8 μm, 4.0 ± 0.1 mm, and 45 ± 4 s−1 for KTyr,K′ATP, and k3, respectively). Analysis of the reverse reaction in the presence of rubidium yields results similar to those obtained in the presence of potassium (Table I).Table IIRate of tyrosine activation in the presence of different monovalent metal ionsIon2-aThe ions were present as LiCl, NaCl, KCl, RbCl, or CsCl.kobs2-bThe reaction was measured by monitoring the decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (0.5 μm) associated with the formation of Tyr-AMP in the presence of 200 μm tyrosine and 10 mm MgATP at 25 °C.

Open table in a new tab In human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, the second lysine in the KMSKS signature sequence is replaced by a serine (Ser225) (14Kleeman T.A. Wei D. Simpson K.L. First E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14420-14425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This lysine is the most highly conserved amino acid in the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family and is strictly conserved in bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases. Previous investigations indicate that despite the absence of the second lysine in the KMSKS signature sequence, the catalytic efficiencies of the human and B. stearothermophilus enzymes are nearly identical (23Austin J. First E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14812-14820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, the KMSKS signature sequence is located on a mobile loop that moves ∼10 Å to interact with the pyrophosphate moiety of ATP (19Fersht A.R. Knill-Jones J.W. Bedouelle H. Winter G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1581-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In B. stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, the second lysine in this sequence corresponds to lysine 233. Like potassium in the human enzyme, lysine 233 exerts its maximum effect in the transition state of the reaction and has no effect on the stability of the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex. Replacing lysine 233 with alanine (in B. stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase) or removing potassium (in the human enzyme) results in a similar decrease in k3, the forward rate constant for tyrosine activation. The observation that neither lysine 233 in B. stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase nor potassium in the human enzyme affects the stability of the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex is consistent with the hypothesis that lysine 233 and potassium both interact with the pyrophosphate moiety of ATP. These observations suggest that the role played by potassium in the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is similar to that of lysine 233 in the B. stearothermophilus enzyme. In other words, in the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, potassium functionally replaces the second lysine in the KMSKS signature sequence. In both the B. stearothermophilus and human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases, binding of tyrosine to one of the subunits inactivates the other subunit (23Austin J. First E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14812-14820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 29Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 32Fersht A.R. Ashford J.S. Bruton C.J. Jakes R. Koch G.L. Hartley B.S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This extreme form of negative cooperativity is known as “half-of-the-sites” reactivity and results in tyrosyl-adenylate formation at only one of the two subunits in the enzyme. The inhibition of catalysis at the second subunit implies that tyrosyl-adenylate binds with a higher affinity to the asymmetric dimer than it does to the symmetric dimer (29Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 32Fersht A.R. Ashford J.S. Bruton C.J. Jakes R. Koch G.L. Hartley B.S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Comparison of the rate constants for the dissociation of tyrosyl-adenylate from the human enzyme (koff) in the absence and presence of potassium indicates that potassium decreases koff by 3-fold. This observation is curious because it implies that potassium affects the stability of the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex, whereas the results of pre-steady-state kinetics in the absence and presence of potassium clearly indicate that potassium has no effect on the stability of the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex. There are two possible explanations for this apparent paradox. One possibility is that in the absence of potassium, the rate constant for the binding of tyrosyl-adenylate to the enzyme,kon, is also increased 3-fold, and, as a result, the dissociation constant for the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex is unaffected. The other possibility is that potassium stabilizes the asymmetric conformation of the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase dimer. If this hypothesis is correct, then in the presence of potassium, the fraction of enzyme that is in the asymmetric conformation will increase (IIa and IVa in Fig. 5). Because tyrosyl-adenylate binds to the asymmetric dimer with a higher affinity than it binds to the symmetric dimer, the rate at which tyrosyl-adenylate dissociates from the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex will decrease as the fraction of enzyme present as the asymmetric dimer increases. In this scenario, potassium would not alter the stability of the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex relative to the unliganded enzyme because the unliganded enzyme is present as a symmetric dimer. In other words, the assay that measures the dissociation of tyrosyl-adenylate from the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex is measuring the stability of the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex relative to the unliganded asymmetric dimer, whereas the pre-steady-state kinetic assays are measuring the stability of the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex relative to the unliganded symmetric dimer. The observation that tyrosine induces “half-of-the-sites” reactivity in tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase indicates that, like tyrosyl-adenylate, the tyrosine substrate must bind more tightly to the asymmetric dimer than it does to the symmetric dimer. If potassium stabilizes the asymmetric dimer, then it must also stabilize the TyrRS·Tyr complex, even though it does not interact directly with the tyrosine substrate. This is indeed the case, with potassium stabilizing the TyrRS·Tyr complex by 0.6 kcal/mol in the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. This value is similar to the free energy difference determined for the dissociation of tyrosyl-adenylate in the absence and presence of potassium (ΔG = 0.65 kcal/mol). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that potassium stabilizes the asymmetric dimer. Under normal physiological conditions, the concentration of potassium in the cell is ∼150 mm (33Lodish H. Baltimore D. Berk A. Zipursky S.L. Matsudaira P. Darnell J. Hull P. Molecular Cell Biology. 3rd Ed. Scientific American Books, Inc., New York1995: 640-641Google Scholar). This concentration is sufficient to saturate the potassium-binding site on human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase and stabilize the high affinity asymmetric state of the enzyme (KdK+ = 32 mm). One of the goals of this research is to identify differences between the catalytic mechanisms of human and bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases to design novel antibiotics that selectively inhibit bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases but not the human homologue. Amino acid sequence analysis indicates that there are four catalytically important active site residues in B. stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase that are not present in the human enzyme (14Kleeman T.A. Wei D. Simpson K.L. First E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14420-14425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These four amino acids, Cys35, His48, Thr51, and Lys233, all interact with ATP in the transition state of the reaction (16Lowe D.M. Fersht A.R. Wilkinson A.J. Carter P. Winter G.

In addition, sequence analysis indicates that the tyrosine-binding site is highly conserved among bacteria (eubacteria), archaea, and eukaryotes (eukarya) (14Kleeman T.A. Wei D. Simpson K.L. First E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14420-14425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). 2E. A. First, unpublished observations. The only significant difference observed within the tyrosine-binding site is the replacement of an invariant threonine in bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases (Thr73 in the B. stearothermophilus enzyme) by a histidine in the archaeal and eukaryotic homologues. These observations suggest that the binding of tyrosine is similar among all tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases but that the interactions between the enzyme and ATP differ between bacteria and humans. The results presented in this study support this hypothesis and suggest that in order to design compounds that selectively inhibit bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases, one should take advantage of differences in the ATP-binding sites of the human and bacterial enzymes. Further support for this hypothesis comes from the observation that a species of Micromonospora produces a highly selective inhibitor of bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases, binding to Staphylococcus aureus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases with a 40,000-fold higher affinity than it binds to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue (9Stefanska A.L. Coates N.J. Mensah L.M. Pope A.J. Ready S.J. Warr S.R. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2000; 53: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The structure of this inhibitor consists of a tyrosyl moiety covalently attached to a bicyclic sugar through a peptide bond (5Houge-Frydrych C.S. Readshaw S.A. Bell D.J. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2000; 53: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The bicyclic sugar binds to S. aureus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase in the general region of the ribose-binding site and is presumably responsible for the specificity of the inhibitor. In this study, we have presented evidence that potassium functionally replaces the second lysine in the KMSKS signature sequence in human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. These results suggest that selective inhibitors of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase are more likely to target differences in the ATP-binding site than in the amino acid-binding site of the enzyme. Given the selective pressure to ensure that the cognate tRNA is aminoacylated by the correct amino acid, this principle is also likely to apply to the design of selective inhibitors for the other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.

https://openalex.org/W2048218740,"Two homologues, Dd-ALG-2a and Dd-ALG-2b, of the mammalian calcium-binding protein ALG-2 (apoptosis-linked gene 2) have been characterized in the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. Fluorescence titrations showed that both proteins bind calcium ions with affinities (Ca2+)0.5 of 30 and 450 μm, respectively, at sites specific to calcium. Calcium ion binding resulted in changes of conformation associated with the unmasking of hydrophobic regions of the proteins. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that Dd-ALG-2a homodimers formed (KD of 1 μm) at calcium ion concentrations similar to those necessary for Ca2+-induced conformational changes. Deletion of the hydrophobic N-terminal sequence or EF-hand 5 of Dd-ALG-2a prevented dimerization. The Dd-ALG-2b homodimer was not detected, and the Dd-ALG-2a/2b heterodimer formed only when Dd-ALG-2b was the immobilized partner. Murine Alix formed a heterodimer (KD = 0.6 μm) with Dd-ALG-2a but not with Dd-ALG-2b, and the interaction strictly depended upon calcium ions. The ΔNter construct of Dd-ALG-2a lost its interaction capacity with mouse Alix. The genes encoding both proteins, Dd-alg-2a and -2b, were expressed in growing cells. The levels of mRNA were at a maximum during aggregation (4–8 h) and decreased rapidly thereafter. In contrast, the levels of proteins remained fairly stable. Dd-ALG-2a and Dd-ALG-2b were found to be dispensable for growth and development, based on the finding that single Dd-alg2a− orDd-alg-2b− and doubleDd-alg2a−/Dd-alg-2b−mutant cell lines showed normal growth in axenic medium or on bacterial lawns and exhibited unaltered development. Two homologues, Dd-ALG-2a and Dd-ALG-2b, of the mammalian calcium-binding protein ALG-2 (apoptosis-linked gene 2) have been characterized in the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. Fluorescence titrations showed that both proteins bind calcium ions with affinities (Ca2+)0.5 of 30 and 450 μm, respectively, at sites specific to calcium. Calcium ion binding resulted in changes of conformation associated with the unmasking of hydrophobic regions of the proteins. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that Dd-ALG-2a homodimers formed (KD of 1 μm) at calcium ion concentrations similar to those necessary for Ca2+-induced conformational changes. Deletion of the hydrophobic N-terminal sequence or EF-hand 5 of Dd-ALG-2a prevented dimerization. The Dd-ALG-2b homodimer was not detected, and the Dd-ALG-2a/2b heterodimer formed only when Dd-ALG-2b was the immobilized partner. Murine Alix formed a heterodimer (KD = 0.6 μm) with Dd-ALG-2a but not with Dd-ALG-2b, and the interaction strictly depended upon calcium ions. The ΔNter construct of Dd-ALG-2a lost its interaction capacity with mouse Alix. The genes encoding both proteins, Dd-alg-2a and -2b, were expressed in growing cells. The levels of mRNA were at a maximum during aggregation (4–8 h) and decreased rapidly thereafter. In contrast, the levels of proteins remained fairly stable. Dd-ALG-2a and Dd-ALG-2b were found to be dispensable for growth and development, based on the finding that single Dd-alg2a− orDd-alg-2b− and doubleDd-alg2a−/Dd-alg-2b−mutant cell lines showed normal growth in axenic medium or on bacterial lawns and exhibited unaltered development. programmed cell death isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside 2-(p-toluidino)naphthalene-6-sulfonate apoptosis-linked gene 2 apoptosis-linked gene 2-interacting protein X maltose-binding protein maltose-binding protein-tagged Dd-ALG-2a maltose-binding protein-tagged Dd-ALG-2b polyhistidine-tagged Dd-ALG-2b phosphate-buffered saline digoxigenin 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Programmed cell death (PCD),1 a physiological suicide process, is implicated in the development and maintenance of an organism's integrity. Its most common phenotype, apoptosis, is generally considered as the paradigm of PCD in multicellular organisms. However, PCD is no longer confined to situations initially termed as apoptosis. This is particularly so in unicellular organisms where morphological diversity and multiple mechanisms of PCD have been observed. The nature of executioners involved in PCD has also broadened, with the discovery of caspase-independent pathways and autophagic processes (1Wyllie A.H. Golstein P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, the developmental cycle includes a multicellular phase that involves both differentiation and morphogenesis (2Loomis W.F. Dictyostelium discoideum: A Developmental System. Academic Press, New York1975Google Scholar, 3Kessin R.H. Dictyostelium: Evolution, Cell Biology, and the Development of Multicellularity. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom2001Crossref Google Scholar). Within the multicellular structure that forms from the initial aggregation of starving individual cells, prestalk cells undergo a PCD process that leads to the formation of a stalk comprising dead vacuolated cells (4Whittingham W.F. Raper K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1960; 46: 642-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supporting a mass of viable spores. In an in vitro system that permits differentiation without morphogenesis, cells committed to PCD were unable to re-grow and showed specific morphological features, including massive vacuolization and cytoplasmic and focal chromatin condensations (5Levraud J.-P. Adam M. Cornillon S. Golstein P. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 66: 469-497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cornillon S. Foa C. Davoust J. Buonavista N. Gross J.D. Golstein P. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2691-2704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Study of this type of developmentally regulated cell death in eukaryotes, which diverged early in the development of life, might reveal underlying mechanisms of PCD that are conserved as such, or slightly modified, in more complex organisms. The sequencing of the genome of D. discoideum is almost completed (7Kuspa A. Sucgang R. Shaulsky G. Funct. Integr. Genomics. 2001; 1: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Investigating the amebal genome shows that only a limited number of the proteins involved in mammalian PCD have homologues in D. discoideum. In addition to the “apoptosis inducing factor” or AIF and a putative paracaspase (8Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L. Pisabarro M.T. Seshagiri S. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Mol.

Aubry, manuscript in preparation. In mammalian cells, both proteins have been determined as being components of the apoptotic machinery (10Missotten M. Nichols A. Rieger K. Sadoul R.

During the development stage induced by starvation in D. discoideum, calcium ions have been described as regulating cell type differentiation (18Baskar R. Chhabra P. Mascarenhas P. Nanjundiah V. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 44: 491-498PubMed Google Scholar, 19Cubitt A.B. Firtel R.A. Fischer G. Jaffe L.F. Miller A.L. Development. 1995; 121: 2291-2301PubMed Google Scholar, 20Schaap P. Nebl T.

Even though a number of calcium-binding proteins have been characterized in this organism, among which are CBP1–4, CAF1, CaM, and CalB (21Abe F. Maeda Y. Dev.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), none so far has been assigned a specific role as a mediator of calcium ion signaling during this phase of differentiation. In view of the proposed involvement of ALG-2 in apoptosis in higher eukaryotes, we decided to examine whether D. discoideum multicellular development was dependent upon this calcium-binding protein. In this paper, we describe the calcium-dependent biochemical properties of the two D. discoideum homologues of mammalian ALG-2 that we have identified and their interaction with mammalian Alix. While this work was in progress, the two ALG-2 homologues were independently identified (28Ohkouchi S. Nishio K. Maeda M. Hitomi K. Adachi H. Maki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our report provides original and complementary biochemical data pertaining to their physiological role with respect to Alix and describes alg-2knock-outs and their characterization during vegetative life and the developmental cycle. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, and IPTG were from Roche Diagnostics. TNS was from Sigma-Aldrich. pMAL-C2, pQE-30, and pGEX-6P-2 expression vectors were from New England Biolabs, Qiagen, and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. All experiments were done using wild-type developing D. discoideum KAx-3 and JH10, a thymidine auxotroph (29Dynes J.L. Firtel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7966-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), as parental strains. Cells were grown at 21 °C in cultures shaken at 180 rpm in HL5 medium supplemented when necessary with 7.5 μg/ml blasticidin, 20 μg/ml G418, or 100 μg/ml thymidine. Developmental phenotypes were studied after plating cells on non-nutritive Na,KPi-buffered agar plates (30Sussman M. Prescott D. Methods in Cell Physiology. Academic Press, New York1966: 397-409Google Scholar). For both alg2a and alg2b genes, the sequence of the coding cDNA and the full-length genomic sequence including introns were obtained after PCR experiments with forward primers (5′-TCAAAAATGATGTCATATGGATAC and 5′-TTAAATGTACGGATACGGATATAC) and reverse primers (5′-TTAAACTAAGCTAATAATATCATAAATGTG and 5′-TTAAACTAAAGCAATGATATCATAAAG) (from Oligo Express, Paris, France) for Dd-ALG-2a and Dd-ALG-2b, respectively. Primers were designed on the basis of relevant clones in the DictyosteliumcDNA data base (www.csm.biol.tsukuba.ac.jp/cDNAproject.html). The genomic and cDNA sequences have been deposited at GenBank™ under accession nos. AF358913 and AF358911 for Dd-alg-2a andAF358914 and AF358912 for Dd-alg-2b, respectively. The singleDd-alg-2a and -2b null mutants were made in KAx-3 strain by inserting the blasticidin S resistance cassettebsr (31Sutoh K. Plasmid. 1993; 30: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) at position 294 (in Dd-alg-2b) and position 376 (in Dd-alg-2a) of the genomic DNAs. To obtain a double knock-out mutant, a Dd-alg-2b-deficient strain was first generated in the JH10 strain by disruption of the coding sequence with the THY1 gene-containing cassette (29Dynes J.L. Firtel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7966-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This was then used to introduce the Dd-alg-2a gene knock-out construct containing the bsr cassette. Transformants were cloned by plating cells on SM-agar plates in the presence ofKlebsiella aerogenes. Potential gene knock-out clones were first analyzed by Western blot and confirmed by Southern blot. The cDNA sequences (except for the initial methionine) coding for full-length or truncated proteins ALG-2a, ALG-2aΔNt (amino acids 28–197), ALG-2aΔEF5 (amino acids 3–175), ALG-2b, and ALG-2bΔEF5 (amino acids 2–183) were subcloned in-frame with the maltose-binding protein (MBP), into the pMAL-c2 expression vector (MBP-ALG-2a and -2b) or with the amino-terminal polyhistidine tag contained in the pQE-30 expression vector (His6-ALG-2b). In all cases, PCR amplification was used to create the appropriate subcloning sites and the constructs were then verified by sequencing. Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 cells. BL21 bacteria expressing the various recombinant Dd-ALG-2 proteins were grown overnight at 37 °C in Luria Broth, diluted to 1/50 in Terrific Broth, and grown at 37 °C to A600 = 0.6. IPTG was then added at a final concentration of 1 mm and growth resumed for 3 h. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the bacterial pellets frozen at –20 °C until use. The MBP-fused proteins were expressed at high levels (about 50 mg/liter of bacterial suspension) and in soluble forms. In contrast, His6-ALG-2b was expressed at a high level but always as inclusion bodies. To purify recombinant MBP-tagged proteins, the bacterial pellets were thawed in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA (buffer A) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml pepstatin and leupeptin, and 0.5% Triton X-100. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Suspensions were sonicated for 3 min and centrifuged for 1 h at 200,000 × g. Supernatants were mixed with amylose beads washed in buffer A and rotated on a wheel overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing with buffer A, MBP-tagged proteins were batch-eluted with buffer A containing 10 mm maltose and 1 mm EDTA. The recombinant proteins were >98% pure (see Fig. 2) without any additional purification step. N-terminal GST (glutathioneS-transferase)-tagged mouse Alix, cloned into vector pGEX-6P-2, was expressed in BL21 bacteria and induced with 1 mm IPTG, then grown for another 15 h at 15 °C. After purification of the fusion protein on glutathione-Sepharose 4B, the GST tag was cleaved with PreScission protease (AmershamBiosciences) to obtain Alix. The protein appeared as a single band on SDS-PAGE. His6-ALG-2b was expressed in BL21 bacterial strain (see above). Purified inclusion bodies were dissolved in 6 m urea, purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and extensively dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. The preparation was checked for homogeneity by SDS-PAGE, lyophilized, and injected into rabbits to raise polyclonal antibodies. Western blot analysis showed that the immune serum recognized both Dd-ALG-2a and -2b. To follow the expression of the endogenous Dd-ALG-2 throughout development, protein samples were prepared from developing amebae from the wild-type strain, KAx-3, or single knock-out strains, Dd-alg-2a−and -2b−. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) and probed with the antiserum using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) for detection. Total RNA was isolated as described (32Nellen W. Datta S. Reymond C. Sivertsen A. Mann S. Crowley T. Firtel R.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 67-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) from vegetative amebae or cells that had been filter-developed on non-nutritive Na/KPi-buffered agar plate for 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, or 24 h. At each time, 6 μg of total RNAs were separated by electrophoresis on a formaldehyde-containing agarose gel, transferred to a nylon blotting membrane, and hybridized with a specific digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled RNA probe. DIG-labeled RNA probes were generated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The RNA probes for Dd-alg-2a and -2b corresponded to their full-length sequence. Hybridization was performed in DIG-Easy buffer at 50 °C. The mRNAs were detected after binding of anti-DIG antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase with CDP-Star™ as substrate. Real-time analysis of the Ca2+-dependent interactions between the two Dd-ALG-2 isoforms and mouse Alix was performed at 25 °C on a BIAcore™ instrument. Proteins were diluted to 10 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and coupled to the carboxylmethylated dextran surface of a CM5 sensor chip using aN-hydroxysuccinimide/1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide coupling mixture. The amount of immobilized protein was between 3000 and 4000 resonance units. Running buffer for protein interaction contained 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.25% Tween 20, and varying amounts of Ca2+ and circulated at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. To obtain blank sensorgrams, for subtraction of bulk refractive index background, equal volumes of each protein were injected over a surface with immobilized MBP alone. Regeneration of the surfaces was carried out by injecting 5 μl of 8m urea after checking that binding isotherms were unaffected by such a denaturation step. Sensorgrams were analyzed by nonlinear least square curve fitting. A single-site binding model was used for kinetic analysis of interactions. The equation Rt = Req (1 − exp(−ks(t −t0))) was used for the association phase, whereRt is the amount of ligand bound at timet; Req is the amount of ligand bound at equilibrium; t0 is the beginning of the association phase; and ks =konC + koff, where C is the concentration of injected analyte. The rate constantskon and koff were determined from the plot of ks versus C. The koff constant was also obtained from the analysis of the dissociation phase using the equationRt = R0exp(−koff(t −t0)). The parameter Rt is the amount of ligand bound at time t, and R0 is the amount of ligand bound at timet0 corresponding to the beginning of the dissociation phase. The mean value obtained from a series of injections was taken as dissociation constant koff. The values of koff derived directly from dissociation curves or from secondary association plots were in agreement. The apparent dissociation constant, KD, was calculated from the ratio of the two kinetic constants (koff/kon). In the case where interactions approached equilibrium, the dissociation constant KD was also determined directly from equilibrium levels of the analyte binding using the equationReq/C = (Rmax −Req)/KD. The parameter, Rmax, was the maximal binding capacity of the immobilized ligand and KD was derived from the slope of the Req/C versus Req plot. Free Ca2+ and Ca2+-buffer systems were calculated using the WEBMAXC (version 2.10) program (33Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) available at www.stanford.edu/∼cpatton/webmaxc2.htm. Two types of fluorescence experiments were performed to follow changes of protein conformation: intrinsic fluorescence alteration and 2-(p-toluidino)naphthalene-6-sulfonate (TNS) fluorescence enhancement. All fluorescence measurements were recorded at 21 °C with a Spex Fluoromax spectrofluorometer in a buffer made of 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Intrinsic fluorescence of the MBP-ALG2 isoforms (40 μg/ml, ∼0.6 μm) was measured using excitation and emission wavelengths set at 295 and 348 nm, respectively. In control experiments, it was checked that the addition of Ca2+ or EGTA had no effect on the shape of the fluorescence spectra of the proteins and solely affected the fluorescence intensity. TNS fluorescence was measured in 2.5 ml of buffer containing 100 μg of the protein of interest to which 10 μm TNS was added. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 325 and 427 nm, respectively. Fluorescence variations were expressed as ΔF/F0 in percentages. For subcellular fractionation, 1.5 × 109 cells were homogenized with a cell cracker in 3 ml of buffer: 0.25 m sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, 25 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.5, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. Unbroken cells and nuclei were recovered by first centrifuging the homogenates at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The postnuclear supernatant was then loaded onto a 21-ml 24% (v/v) self-forming Percoll gradient in 0.11 m KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5; spun for 1 h at 18,000 rpm in a Kontron TFT70 rotor; and eluted in 2-ml fractions. Immunofluorescence observations were made from D. discoideum cells carrying C-terminal c-Myc-tagged constructs of ALG-2a and -2b under the control of Act15 promoter (pEXP4+ vector). Approximately 2 × 105 amebae were allowed to adhere onto coverslips for 10 min and fixed in a solution of 40 mm MES-Na, pH 6.5, 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 20 °C. They were then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100–40 mm MES-Na, pH 6.5, for 2 min. After several washes in PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, cells were incubated with the primary anti-c-Myc antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 4 mg/ml stock, dilution 1/500) for 1 h. The secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody, Jackson Immunoresearch) was added at a dilution of 1/200 after three washes in PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20. Finally the samples were washed extensively in PBS-Tween 20, mounted on glass slides, and observed in a Zeiss Axioplan microscope. The ALG-2 protein, first described by Vito et al. (11Vito P. Lacaná E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), belongs to the family of calcium-binding proteins with penta-EF-hands. The D. discoideum expressed sequence tag data base was searched for homology with murine ALG-2. We found several clones corresponding to two distinct cDNA sequences. There were 10 members in a first group and 5 members in a second group with significant probability scores. The full sequences of the two D. discoideum alg-2a and alg-2b genes were determined by PCR experiments. The first gene, Dd-alg-2a, consisted of 4 exons interlaced with 3 short (217, 82, and 172 bp) and AT-rich introns (97, 89, and 96% A+T, respectively). The short length and the biased base composition are typical features of D. discoideumintrons (34Kimmel A.R. Firtel R.A. Loomis W.F. The Development of Dictyostelium discoideum. Academic Press, New York1982: 234-324Google Scholar). This gene encoded a 197-amino acid-long Dd-ALG-2a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 22.3 kDa and a pI of 8.0. On theD. discoideum genome, Dd-alg-2a was located adjacent to Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor (rdiA) gene (GenBank™ accession no. AY044085). The second gene, Dd-alg-2b, consisted of 2 exons (243 and 375 bp) interrupted by a 134-bp intron (90% A+T). The intron border inDd-alg-2b corresponded exactly to the intron II border inDd-alg-2a. The gene encoded a 205-amino acid-long Dd-ALG-2b protein with a calculated molecular mass of 23.3 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.3. As shown in Fig. 1A, Dd-ALG-2a and -2b were 64 (74) % identical (similar). A BLAST search of GenBank™ data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov: 80/BLAST/) showed that both Dd-ALG-2a and -2b were homologous to various other penta-EF-hand proteins. The highest scores were obtained with Entamoeba histolytica URE3-binding protein (35Gilchrist C.A. Holm C.F. Hughes M.A. Schaenman J.M. Mann B.J. Petri W.A., Jr. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but also mouse members of the penta EF-hand family, including ALG-2, peflin, sorcin, grancalcin, and calpains (13Lo K.W. Zhang Q., Li, M. Zhang M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7498-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Kitaura Y. Matsumoto S. Satoh H. Hitomi K. Maki M. J. Biol.

Dd-ALG-2a and -2b both exhibited five putative EF-hand Ca2+-binding sites. EF1, EF2, and EF3 were identical to the EF-hand consensus pattern (ProSite PS00018). As for all other penta-EF-hand proteins, the EF-hand scores of Dd-ALG-2a and -2b were lower in EF4 and EF5. The structure of the two D. discoideum proteins was obtained by homology modeling and threading (40Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar) the amebal proteins onto the three-dimensional structure of Ca2+-loaded mouse ALG-2 (amino acids 21–191) (41Jia J. Tarabykina S. Hansen C. Berchtold M. Cygler M. Structure. 2001; 9: 267-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A quite remarkable superimposition characterized by high confidence factors was obtained in particular at the level of the eight α-helices (Fig. 1, B and C). The main difference between Dd-ALG-2a and -2b was found at the level of helix 7 contributing to EF4 and EF5. Helix 7 in Dd-ALG-2a closely resembles the mouse counterpart, but is shorter on the N-terminal side ending EF4 in Dd-ALG-2b. Furthermore, the amino acid side chains in the EF5-loop of the D. discoideum proteins could only establish three putative calcium coordination bonds. This will not favor calcium binding at this site. Finally, the two amebal proteins differed from the murine ALG-2 at the level of EF2. For Dd-ALG-2a and -2b, this is 100% identical to the canonical Ca2+-binding site but only 68% similar for the mouse protein. All the constructs used to examine protein-protein interactions (Dd-ALG-2a, Dd-ALG-2aΔEF5, Dd-ALG-2aΔNter, Dd-ALG-2b, and Dd-ALG-2bΔNter) were produced in E. coli with an MBP tag, a strategy that allowed us to obtain soluble proteins with a high yield. Proteins purified on amylose columns by affinity were always more than 98% pure in one step, and they were used without any further purification (Fig.2, lanes 1–5). For immunization purposes, a polyhistidine (His6) tag was preferred to the MBP tag. The protein was produced as inclusion bodies. His6-ALG-2b was solubilized in 8 m urea, purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Fig. 2, lane 6), and lyophilized before injection into rabbits. To detect conformational changes because of calcium binding to Dd-ALG-2a and -2b, the intrinsic fluorescence spectra of both MBP-tagged proteins were recorded in the presence of either EGTA or Ca2+. In both cases, maximal excitation and emission occurred at 283 and 348 nm, respectively. The presence of calcium ions resulted in a rapid increase in the fluorescence emission intensity of MBP-ALG-2a. This could be reversed by addition of an excess of EGTA (Fig. 3A). Identical data (not shown) were obtained with MBP-ALG-2b. These results reveal for both proteins conformational changes sensed by proximal tryptophan(s). In a control experiment, fluorescence intensity of MBP on its own was unaffected by the addition of calcium ions (data not shown). The lipophilic fluorescent probe, TNS, was used to evaluate the exposure of ALG-2 hydrophobic regions upon Ca2+-induced change of conformation (37Maki M. Yamaguchi K. Kitaura Y. Satoh H. Hitomi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the absence of calcium ions, the fluorescence of TNS alone was very weak. Addition of MBP-ALG-2a led to only a small increase. Addition of calcium ions resulted in a large increase in TNS fluorescence and indicates that TNS is bound to newly exposed hydrophobic region(s) of MBP-ALG-2a (Fig. 3B). Addition of EGTA fully reversed the fluorescence induced by the calcium ions. Similar results were obtained for MBP-ALG-2b (data not shown). The affinity of MBP-ALG-2a and -2b for calcium was estimated from intrinsic and TNS fluorescence experiments, where the variations of fluorescence intensity were recorded as a function of calcium ion concentration. Intrinsic and TNS fluorescence responses exhibited a similar trend and gave an apparent KD for Ca2+ in the 15–40 μm range for MBP-ALG-2a and in the 300–600 μm range for MBP-ALG-2b (Fig.3C). These data indicate that the observed conformational changes and exposure of hydrophobic stretches are likely to be related to binding of calcium ions at the same sites. The affinity of MBP-"

In the present study, we examined whether NGC could be phosphorylated in neural cells. On metabolic labeling of cultured cerebral cortical cells from the rat fetus with 32Pi, serine residues in NGC were radiolabeled. Some NGC became detectable in the raft fraction from the rat cerebrum, a signaling microdomain of the plasma membrane, with cerebral development. NGC from the non-raft fraction, not the raft fraction, could be phosphorylated by an in vitro kinase reaction. The phosphorylation of NGC was inhibited by adding to the reaction mixture a recombinant peptide representing the ectodomain of NGC, but not by adding a peptide representing its cytoplasmic domain. NGC could be labeled by an in vitro kinase reaction using [γ-32P]GTP as well as [γ-32P]ATP, and this kinase activity was partially inhibited by 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, a selective inhibitor of casein kinase II. In addition to the intracellular phosphorylation, NGC was also phosphorylated at the cell surface by an ectoprotein kinase. This is the first report to demonstrate that NGC can be phosphorylated both intracellularly and pericellularly, and our findings suggest that a kinase with a specificity similar to that of casein kinase II is responsible for the NGC ectodomain phosphorylation.

Proteoglycans are a group of proteins bearing sulfated glycosaminoglycans. They are located not only in the extracellular matrix as secretory molecules but also at the cell surface as transmembrane components or glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored molecules in various animal tissues including the central nervous system. In the vertebrate central nervous system, there are many species of proteoglycan with different structural features. Each neural proteoglycan shows a particular spatiotemporal expression pattern in the brain, suggesting that it would function in particular phases of brain development. In fact, it has become clear that neural proteoglycans are involved in various cellular events including neural cell proliferation, cellular differentiation, neurite outgrowth, path finding, and synaptogenesis (1Margolis R.K.

In addition, it has been shown that the expression and metabolism of neural proteoglycans change after brain injury and are altered under some pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (10Snow A.D.

To date, rat, mouse, and human NGC have already been cloned, and their expression is reported to be restricted to the central nervous system (14Watanabe E. Maeda N. Matsui F. Kushima Y. Noda M.

The core protein consists of five structurally different domains: an N-terminal domain to which chondroitin sulfate is attached, an acidic amino acid cluster, a cysteine-rich domain with a single epidermal growth factor-like motif, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Furthermore, there are some consensus sequences for phosphorylation by casein kinase II (CKII) in the ectodomain and by protein kinase C (PKC) in the cytoplasmic domain of the NGC core protein. neuroglycan C protease-free chondroitinase ABC casein kinase I and II, respectively 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole glutathione S-transferase 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid protein kinase C polyvinylidene difluoride receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are pivotal steps in signal transduction and play a key role in the regulation of many cellular processes (17Krebs E.G. Breavo J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 923-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). NGC would participate in signal transduction through its phosphorylation. Many signal-transducing molecules are concentrated in a particular microdomain of the plasma membrane. This microdomain is abundant in glycosphingolipids and cholesterol and is referred to as lipid rafts, caveolae membranes, detergent-resistant membranes, or detergent-insoluble glycosphingolipid-enriched domains (18Simons K.

It has been suggested that the lipid rafts play an important role not only in the transport of membrane components but also in signal transduction (18Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8116) Google Scholar, 19Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar, 24Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5162) Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be expected that NGC, as a signaling molecule, exists in the lipid rafts for effective signal transduction. In this paper, we report that serine residues in the NGC core protein were phosphorylated in primary cultured rat neocortical cells and that some NGC became localized in the lipid rafts prepared from the rat cerebrum with cerebral development. In addition, we show that NGC can be phosphorylated by ectoprotein kinase activity at the surface of cerebral cortical cells in culture. The following antibodies were used: a polyclonal anti-NGC antibody (15Yasuda Y. Tokita Y. Aono S. Matsui F. Ono T. Sonta S. Watanabe E. Nakanishi Y. Oohira A. Neurosci.

The following protein kinase inhibitors were used: staurosporine (Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan), which is a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor with a broad specificity; 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB; BIO MOL Research Labs, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA), which is a selective inhibitor of CKII with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 4–10 μm (27Zandomeni R.

To produce recombinant rat NGC polypeptides as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, cDNA fragments encoding the chondroitin sulfate attachment domain (amino acid 33–259) and cytoplasmic domain (448–544) of rat NGC were subcloned into pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The plasmids were introduced into Escherichia coli BL21. Expression of the fusion proteins was induced in the presence of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline by mild sonication, and then Triton X-100 was added to the lysate to a final concentration of 1% with gentle mixing. After centrifugation of the mixture at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) column, and proteins bound to the beads were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm glutathione. Affinity-purified GST fusion proteins were dialyzed against 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, at 4 °C. The neocortexes of Sprague-Dawley rats (SLC Inc., Shizuoka, Japan) on embryonic day 17 were dissected, treated with 0.25% trypsin and 0.01% DNase I, and dissociated by trituration with a Pasteur pipette. Then, 8.5 × 106 cells were suspended in 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and plated onto a 60-mm poly-l-lysine-coated plastic dish. Cerebral cortical cells (8.5 × 106cells/dish) were grown in 60-mm dishes in the medium for 3 days. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium prewarmed to 37 °C and incubated for 4 h in the same medium supplemented with 0.5 mCi/ml 32Pi(ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). The labeling was terminated by removing the culture medium, followed by two immediate washes of the cells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Subsequently, cells were lysed in 800 μl of the cell lysis buffer (0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm calyculin A, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mm NaF in phosphate-buffered saline). The lysate was stirred on a magnetic stirrer overnight at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 11,500 × g for 3 min. The supernatants were precleared with 5 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and then incubated with 2 μg of anti-NGC antibody for 1 h. NGC-antibody complexes were precipitated from the mixture with 5 μl of protein A-Sepharose. The Sepharose beads were washed twice with a cell lysis buffer, then once with a chondroitinase ABC reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 30 mm sodium acetate), and glycosaminoglycan chains were cleaved off from the proteoglycan core proteins by protease-free chondroitinase ABC (CHase ABC; Seikagaku Co.). The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 4% stacking gel and an 8% separating gel followed by autoradiography and/or immunoblotting with anti-NGC antibody. Lipid rafts were prepared by two different methods. The first method includes the treatment of tissues with Triton X-100 (34Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar). Rat cerebra at various ages were homogenized using a Teflon glass homogenizer in 9 volumes of 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm EGTA (buffer A). The lysate was brought to a concentration of 40% (w/v) sucrose by the addition of 80% sucrose. A linear sucrose gradient (5–30%) in buffer A without Triton X-100 was layered over the lysate. The gradient was centrifuged for 16–20 h at 36,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Hitachi RPS40T rotor. 10 fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient. The other method used to prepare lipid rafts involves the homogenization of tissues in an alkaline buffer (35Song K.S., Li, S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). The cerebra of 22-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were homogenized using a Teflon glass homogenizer and sonicated in 9 volumes of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.0. The lysate was brought to a concentration of 45% sucrose by the addition of 90% sucrose in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, containing 150 mm NaCl (buffer B). A linear sucrose gradient (5–35%) in buffer B containing 250 mm sodium carbonate was layered over the lysate. The gradients were centrifuged for 16–20 h at 36,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Hitachi RPS40T rotor. 10 fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient. Proteins from each fraction were precipitated by adding 3 volumes of 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate at 0 °C and were separated by SDS-PAGE (4% stacking gel/8% separating gel) before and after treatment with protease-free CHase ABC. Because flotillin is considered to be a molecular marker of the lipid rafts of the brain (36Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E., Oh, P. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13793-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), the distribution of flotillin was investigated by immunoblotting using an anti-flotillin monoclonal antibody. Proteoglycans were also detected by immuoblotting using the anti-proteoglycan antibodies described above. Immunoprecipitation and the in vitro kinase assay were performed using lysates of membrane fractions of 22-day-old rat cerebra as described by Kasahara et al. (37Kasahara K. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto T. Sanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29947-29953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Rat cerebra were homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold 0.32 msucrose containing 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mm EDTA (buffer C) using a motor-driven Teflon glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 11,500 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A (buffer D) at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 3 min at 4 °C. 700-μl aliquots of the supernatants were precleared with 5-μl protein A-Sepharose, then incubated with 2 μg of anti-NGC antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes thus formed were precipitated with 5 μl of protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitate was washed three times with buffer B, twice with a buffer for the kinase reaction (30 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm MnCl2), and resuspended in 20 μl of the kinase buffer. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or [γ-32P]GTP (3,000 Ci/mmol, Institute of Isotopes Co., Ltd., Budapest, Hungary), and the samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The kinase reaction was stopped by boiling for 3 min. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE before and after treatment with protease-free CHase ABC, followed by autoradiography and/or immunoblotting with anti-NGC antibody. Immunoprecipitation of NGC from lysates of the lipid raft fraction and non-raft fraction (the bottom fractions) of the sucrose density gradients was performed according to the method of Krämer et al. (38Krämer E.M. Klein C. Koch T. Boytinck M. Trotter J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29042-29049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The lipid raft fractions containing NGC were collected, diluted with double distilled water, and ultracentrifuged at 147,000 × g for 1.5 h. The lipid rafts thus collected were resuspended with stirring in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 5 mmEDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer E) at 4 °C for 20 min. Immunoprecipitation of NGC from the lipid raft suspension was performed as described above. For immunoprecipitation of NGC from the bottom fractions of the sucrose density gradients, the sample was diluted with an equal volume of buffer E and processed in a way similar to that from the lipid raft fractions. CKII purified from rat liver (Promega Co., Madison, WI) and PKC purified from rat brain (Promega Co.) were used for in vitro phosphorylation of recombinant NGC peptides according to the instructions provided. Recombinant GST fusion polypeptides representing the chondroitin sulfate attachment region and the cytoplasmic region of NGC were dissolved with the kinase reaction buffers in the presence of CKII or PKC. The phosphorylation reactions were started by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the reactions were stopped by the addition of the SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE, and the mixtures were boiled for 3 min. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography and/or Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Recombinant GST was also treated with both kinases in the same way. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed according to the method of Ito et al. (39Ito H. Okamoto K. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29934-29941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).32P-Labeled NGC was subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred electrophoretically from the gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The protein band containing phosphorylated NGC was cut out and hydrolyzed in 6 m hydrochloric acid at 110 °C for 1 h. The hydrolysate was evaporated and resuspended in 5 μl of a formate/acetate buffer (formic acid:acetic acid:water, 26:78:900, v/v), pH 1.9, containing 67 μg each of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine. The mixture was applied to a silica gel plate (Merck). Electrophoresis in the first dimension was performed in the above buffer at pH 1.9 at 30 mA for 1.5 h. Electrophoresis in the second dimension was performed in a different buffer (acetic acid:pyridine:water, 10:1:200, v/v) at pH 3.5 at 35 mA for 1 h. The plate was dried, sprayed with ninhydrin to visualize the positions of phosphoamino acids, and then subjected to autoradiography. In situ cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage was performed by the method of Scott et al. (40Scott M.G. Crimmins D.L. McCourt D.W. Tarrand J.J. Eyerman M.C. Nahm M.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

NGC, labeled with32P by the in vitro kinase reaction as described above, was subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 3% stacking gel and a 6% separating gel and then electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane. Digestion of radiolabeled NGC was carried out overnight, in the dark, at room temperature with 0.15 m CNBr in 70% (v/v) formic acid. The CNBr digest was dried and eluted in 150 μl of 2% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.4. The eluate was subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 6% stacking gel and a 15% separating gel, and then the gel was dried. Radiolabeled peptides were visualized by autoradiography. The ectoprotein kinase assay was performed according to Muramoto et al. (41Muramoto K. Taniguchi H. Kawahara M. Kobayashi K. Nonomura Y. Kuroda Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Primary cultured cerebral cortical cells were rinsed twice in a reaction buffer (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 20 mm glucose, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) prewarmed to 37 °C. The ectophosphorylation reaction was initiated by adding 200 μCi/ml of [γ-32P]ATP together with 1 μm calyculin A to the culture medium, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence of 1 mmNa2HPO4 and/or 1 mm ATP. The reaction was terminated by removing the culture medium, followed by two immediate washes of the cells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Subsequently, cells were lysed in the cell lysis buffer. Radiolabeled NGC was detected as described under “Metabolic Labeling of Primary Cultured Cerebral Cortical Cells.” To test whether NGC is phosphorylated in primary cultures of fetal rat cerebral cortical cells, cells were incubated with 32Pi in the presence or absence of 1 mm Na2HPO4. NGC immunoprecipitated from cell lysates was applied to SDS-PAGE before and after treatment with CHase ABC followed by electrotransfer to a PVDF membrane. Radiolabeled materials were visualized by autoradiography of the membrane (Fig. 1 A, left panel), and the NGC protein was detected by immunostaining of the same membrane with anti-NGC antibody (Fig. 1 A, right panel). As reported previously (14Watanabe E. Maeda N. Matsui F. Kushima Y. Noda M. Oohira A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26876-26882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), NGC was detected as a 150 kDa band before CHase digestion and as a 120 kDa band after CHase digestion. However, a significant amount of the 120 kDa band was visible even without the CHase ABC treatment. NGC is a part time proteoglycan, and the amount of a non-proteoglycan form without chondroitin sulfate chains increases gradually with the brain development (16Aono S. Keino H. Ono T. Yasuda Y. Tokita Y. Matsui F. Taniguchi M. Sonta S. Oohira A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 337-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The radioactive bands coincided with the immunolabeled NGC bands, indicating that NGC is phosphorylated in the neocortical cells. Addition of unlabeled phosphate to a final concentration of 1 mm to the culture medium completely prevented the radiolabeling of NGC (Fig. 1 A). Phosphoamino acid analysis of radiolabeled NGC by two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed that the radioactivity was detected exclusively at the position for phosphoserine (Fig. 1 B). These findings indicate that the NGC core protein is phosphorylated at serine residues in neural cells. Many signaling molecules are concentrated in the lipid rafts, a signaling microdomain of the plasma membrane, where phosphorylation and dephosphorylation occur for signal transduction. Therefore, it can be expected that NGC, as a signaling molecule, exists in the lipid rafts. To examine the localization of NGC in the lipid rafts during the development of the brain, the rat cerebra at defined developmental stages between postnatal day 4 (P4) and adulthood were analyzed by Triton X-100 extraction followed by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The localization of other neural transmembrane proteoglycans, phosphacan/RPTP ζ/β and N-syndecan, in the lipid rafts was also examined in the same way. As shown in Fig. 2, flotillin, a marker molecule for the lipid raft fraction in the brain (36Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E., Oh, P. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13793-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), was detected in fractions 4–6 of the sucrose density gradient at all developmental stages examined. Most NGC was recovered in the bottom fraction, not in the lipid raft fraction, at early postnatal stages (P4, data not shown, and P12 in Fig. 2 A). However, some was detectable in the lipid raft fraction around 3 weeks after birth (P22 and adult in Fig. 2 A). Similarly, a large population of phosphacan/RPTP ζ/β was recovered in the lipid raft fraction after P22 (Fig. 2 B), whereas N-syndecan was not detected in the lipid raft fraction at any developmental stage examined (Fig. 2 C). The presence of these neural proteoglycans in the lipid raft fraction prepared from the P22 rat cerebrum was then examined by preparing the lipid rafts using an alkaline solution instead of the detergent. The result was essentially the same as that obtained by the detergent-based method; both NGC and phosphacan/RPTP ζ/β were detected in the lipid raft fraction, but N-syndecan was not (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that some NGC as well as phosphacan/RPTP ζ/β is present in the lipid rafts of the mature brain and that N-syndecan is absent from the lipid rafts at all developmental stages. To examine whether a protein kinase capable of phosphorylating NGC is associated with the proteoglycan, the immunoprecipitation of NGC was carried out both with the raft fraction and with the non-raft fraction, or the bottom fraction of the sucrose density gradient, of the P22 samples. An in vitro kinase reaction of the immunoprecipitates in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP demonstrated that radioactive bands corresponding to the NGC bands were present only in the non-raft samples (Fig. 3 A). Although NGC could be immunoprecipitated from the raft fraction, it was not phosphorylated by the in vitro kinase reaction (Fig. 3 A, raft). Phosphoamino acid analysis of 32P-labeled NGC of the non-raft fraction revealed radioactivity at the position of phosphoserine (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that serine residues on NGC from the detergent-soluble non-raft fraction, not from the raft fraction, of the mature rat cerebrum can be phosphorylated by a protein kinase associated with NGC. To obtain a clue as to the phosphorylation site on NGC, we tried to inhibit the in vitro kinase reaction competitively by adding recombinant GST fusion polypeptides representing particular regions of the NGC core protein (Fig. 4 A). In this series of experiments, NGC was immunoprecipitated from the lysate of the membrane fraction prepared from the P22 rat cerebrum as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The in vitro kinase reaction was performed by the same method as described above. Unexpectedly, the addition of a polypeptide representing the chondroitin sulfate attachment region of NGC (GST-NGCect) inhibi"

Species specificity is determined at the level of initiation of DNA replication, and it was previously found that this requires the large subunit, p180, of DNA polymerase α-primase to be of human origin. Furthermore, a functional interaction between SV40 large T antigen (TAg) and p180 is essential for viral DNA replication. In this study we determined that the N-terminal regions of human p180, which contain the TAg-binding sites, can be replaced with those of murine origin without losing the ability to support SV40 DNA replication in vitro. The same substitutions do not prevent SV40 TAg from stimulating the activity of DNA polymerase α-primase on single-stranded DNA in the presence of replication protein A. Furthermore, biophysical studies show that the interactions of human and murine DNA polymerase α-primase with SV40 TAg are of a similar magnitude. These studies strongly suggest that requirement of SV40 DNA replication for human DNA polymerase α depends neither on the TAg-binding site being of human origin nor on the strength of the binary interaction between SV40 TAg and DNA polymerase α-primase but rather on sequences in the C-terminal region of human p180.

Polyomavirus DNA replication has been studied extensively because of the ease with which viruses of this family, which include SV40 and mouse polyoma virus (PyV), 1The abbreviations used are: PyVmouse polyoma virusTAgT antigenRPAreplication protein AHhumanMmurinesssingle-stranded can be grown in cell culture and moreover because of the availability of an in vitro replication system, which allows detailed investigation of the individual factors that play a role in the replication process (1Smith R.W.P.

Polyomavirus DNA replication has been found to be largely dependent upon factors involved in replication of the host DNA but does contribute one essential trans-acting factor known as large T antigen (TAg) to the replication complex. TAg is responsible for recognition of the viral origin of replication, at which it forms a double hexamer (3Borowiec J.A. Dean F.B. Bullock P.A. Hurwitz J. Cell. 1990; 60: 181-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In the presence of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein, RPA (replication protein A), and topoisomerase I, TAg proceeds to unwind the origin DNA and recruits the DNA polymerase α-primase heterotetramer, which then initiates bidirectional DNA synthesis (4Dornreiter I.

The bulk of DNA synthesis is, however, carried out by a more processive enzyme complex consisting of DNA polymerase δ and its processivity factor, PCNA (16Tsurimoto T. Melendy T. Stillman B.

Throughout the viral replication cycle, TAg double hexamers are thought to act as the replicative helicase (20Fanning E. Knippers R. Annu. Rev.

Brinton B.T. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 639-678Google Scholar). Nevertheless, both viruses show clear differences with respect to the host cells in which DNA replication can be initiated successfully. Indeed, this appears to be the basis for the strict species specificity observed with SV40 and PyV. The former lytically infects only primate cells, and the latter infects only murine cells (24Tooze J. Molecular Biology of Tumor Virus: DNA Tumor Viruses. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1981Google Scholar). Whether this is a common factor in determination of species specificity of polyomaviruses in general remains to be seen, but the similarity in replication mechanisms throughout this virus family would make it a likely possibility. Species specificity of replication can be reproduced in cell-free systems, and this led to the demonstration that DNA polymerase α-primase is the host factor that determines the species specificity of viral initiation of DNA replication of both SV40 and PyV (25Eki T.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3176-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, studies with hybrid DNA polymerase α-primase complexes showed that the subunit requirement differs between these two viruses, PyV specifically needing p48 to be of murine origin and SV40 requiring a human p180 protein (28Brückner A. Stadlbauer F. Guarino L.A. Brunahl A. Schneider C. Rehfuess C. Prives C. Fanning E. Nasheuer H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1716-1724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Stadlbauer F. Voitenleitner C. Brückner A. Fanning E. Nasheuer H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 94-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of PyV, further resolution was achieved with studies of DNA polymerase α-primase complexes containing chimeric p48 subunits consisting of various combinations of human and murine sequences. It was concluded that a lesser conserved stretch of amino acids (residues 257–288) from the murine subunit was necessary for successful PyV DNA replication, and it is likely that further study of the function of this region will shed light on the mechanism involved in this phenomenon (30Kautz A. Weisshart K. Schneider A. Grosse F. Nasheuer H.P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8569-8578Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 31Kautz A. Schneider A. Weisshart K. Geiger C. Nasheuer H.P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this study we applied a similar approach in an attempt to determine which domains of human p180 are essential for initiation of SV40 DNA replication. Initiation of DNA replication requires the interaction between various proteins at the origin of replication. Interactions between TAg and both RPA and DNA polymerase α-primase have been shown to be important, and SV40 TAg is known to bind the p180, p68, p58, and p48 subunits of DNA polymerase α-primase independently (4Dornreiter I.

For human (H) p180, the site of interaction was mapped to an N-terminal stretch spanning residues 195–313, and it was shown that this interaction is required for the establishment of a functional initiation complex (35Dornreiter I. Copeland W.C. Wang T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 809-820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This led us to investigate whether this interaction plays a part in the species specificity of SV40 DNA replication. To this end we constructed various chimeric p180 subunits that consist of regions derived from both the mouse and the human proteins. Using the baculovirus system these mutants were expressed in complex with the other human DNA polymerase α-primase subunits, and their activities were investigated in both a cell-free replication assay and in an initiation assay consisting of purified proteins only. In addition, we tested our mutant complexes for their ability to be stimulated by SV40 TAg in a system that assays coupled primer and DNA synthesis on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in the presence of RPA (33Melendy T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3389-3395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,34Weisshart K. Förster H. Kremmer E. Schlott B. Grosse F. Nasheuer H.P. J. Biol.

We show that the N-terminal 488 amino acids of human p180, comprising the TAg-binding domain, are not responsible for the species specificity of DNA replication nor for efficient stimulation of DNA polymerase activity by TAg on ssDNA. These results are supported by data obtained with surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore), which shows that SV40 TAg shows little difference in affinity for DNA polymerase α-primase from either human or murine origin. For the construction of recombinant baculoviruses, we used the Bac-to-Bac® system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, p180 wild type and mutants were cloned into the plasmid pFastBac1®, and this was introduced into the Escherichia coli strain DH10Bac®. This strain harbors baculovirus DNA as a single copy F episome (Bacmid) as well as a plasmid encoding transposase. The insert in pFastBac1® is located on a Tn7 transposable element that can recombine in vivo with an acceptor site on the Bacmid, resulting in recombinant baculovirus DNA for which there is a selection procedure. This DNA is recovered from the E. coli strain and transfected into Sf9 insect cells, where it gives rise to recombinant baculoviruses expressing the desired protein. pFB/Hp180 (36Schub O. Rohaly G.

Brueckner A. Rehfuess C. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Förster V. Tseng B.Y. Nasheuer H.P. Eur. J.

The orientation of the NcoI fragments in the resulting clones was checked by restriction analysis. pFB/H488M was created by digesting pFB/Hp180 and pFB/Mp180 with both EcoRI and PpuMI and ligating the 1513-bp fragment containing the 5′-end of the Hp180 gene onto the 3′-end of Mp180 in pFastBac. The reciprocal exchange resulting in pFB/M488H was made by first digesting pFB/Mp180 with EcoRI, followed by partial digestion with PpuMI and exchanging the resulting 1513-bp fragment with that of pFB/Hp180 fully digested with EcoRI and PpuMI. To create pFB/H671M, the PflMI site at position 2011 in the Hp180 open reading frame (CCAAAGCTTGG) was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis to render it compatible with the corresponding site in Mp180 (CCAAAACTTGG). The overlap extension PCR method (38Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) was used to introduce the mutation, which is silent at the protein level. Modified pFB/Hp180 and pFB/Mp180 were then both fully digested with PflMI (both the Hp180 and Mp180 open reading frames have additional PflMI sites at positions 809 and 3688, respectively, which are mutually incompatible and incompatible with the mutated site). pFB/H671M was produced by ligating the four resulting fragments. pFB/M1141H and pFB/H1141M were constructed by exchange of BamHI fragments from pFB/Hp180 and pFB/Mp180 using the internal site and the one located in the polylinker beyond the stop codon. pFB/M1395H and pFB/H1395M were produced by digesting pFB/Hp180 and pFB/Mp180 with EcoRI and AgeI, located before the start codon and internally at position 4196/4184, respectively, and exchanging the resulting fragments. All of the constructs were transferred to baculovirus using the Bac-to-Bac® (Invitrogen) system, amplified in Sf9 insect cells, and then used to infect High Five insect cells (ITC Biotechnology GmbH, Heidelberg) to test for expression of the desired proteins by Western blotting.

Virol. 1997; 71: 7421-7428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay contained 0.6 μg of SV40 TAg, 250 ng of pUC-HS DNA (SV40 origin DNA) (27Schneider C. Weisshart K. Guarino L.A. Dornreiter I. Fanning E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3176-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and 200 μg S100 in 30 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.8, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 7 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mmEGTA, pH 7.8, 4 mm ATP, 0.3 mm CTP, GTP, and UTP, 0.1 mm dATP and dGTP, 0.05 mm dCTP and dTTP, 40 mm creatine phosphate, 80 μg/ml creatine kinase, and 5 μCi each of [α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]dTTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). DNA polymerase α-primase was added as indicated. The incorporation of radioactive dNMP was measured by acid precipitation of DNA and scintillation counting. The total radioactivity was measured after spotting 5 μl of a 200-fold dilution of the replication assay onto GF52 filters (Schleicher & Schüll). Initiation reactions were performed essentially as described previously (12Matsumoto T. Eki T. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9712-9716Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 28Brückner A. Stadlbauer F. Guarino L.A. Brunahl A. Schneider C. Rehfuess C. Prives C. Fanning E. Nasheuer H.P. Mol. Cell.

Briefly, the SV40 initiation assay (40 μl) was assembled on ice and contained 0.25 μg of pUC-HS DNA (SV40 origin DNA), 0.6 μg of SV40 T antigen, and 0.5 μg of RPA in 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 7 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm UTP, 0.2 mm GTP, 0.01 mm CTP, 4 mm ATP, 40 mm creatine phosphate, 1 μg of creatine kinase, 0.3 μg of topoisomerase I, 0.25 mg/ml heat-treated bovine serum albumin, and 20 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Recombinant DNA polymerase α-primase was added as indicated in the figure legends. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, 18th of the reaction mixture was used to estimate the amount of incorporated nucleotides by spotting it onto DE81 paper (48Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The reaction products were precipitated with 0.8 m LiCl, 10 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Sigma), 10 mmMgCl2, and 120 μl of ethanol for 1 h on dry ice, washed twice with 75% ethanol with water, dried, redissolved in 45% formamide, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% xylene cyanol FF, 0.05% bromphenol blue at 65 °C for 30 min, heated for 3 min at 95 °C, and electrophoresed in denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gels for 3–4 h at 600 V as described (27Schneider C. Weisshart K. Guarino L.A. Dornreiter I. Fanning E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3176-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 28Brückner A. Stadlbauer F. Guarino L.A. Brunahl A. Schneider C. Rehfuess C. Prives C. Fanning E. Nasheuer H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1716-1724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction products were visualized by autoradiography. DNA synthesis was carried out according to Kautz et al. (30Kautz A. Weisshart K. Schneider A. Grosse F. Nasheuer H.P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8569-8578Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, in an assay mixture (40 μl) containing 30 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 7 mm MgAc, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 80 μg/ml creatine kinase, 40 mm creatine phosphate, 4 mm ATP, 0.2 mm each CTP, GTP and UTP, 0.1 mm each dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, 0.002 mm dCTP, 0.5 μl of [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol; 10 μCi/μl; Amersham Biosciences), and 250 ng (0.76 nmol of nucleotides) of φX174 ssDNA. Where appropriate this mixture was preincubated with 1 μg of SV40 TAg for 2 min on ice and then with 0.3–1.2 μg RPA for a further 5 min on ice. The reaction was started by the addition of 100–400 ng (depending on specific activity) DNA polymerase α-primase. After incubation for 90 min at 37 °C, 10 μl of the reaction mixture was spotted onto GF-52 filters and precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid. The amount of DNA synthesis was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Interaction analysis was performed using the BIAcore 2000 apparatus from BIAcore AB (Freiburg, Germany) as described previously (34Weisshart K. Förster H. Kremmer E. Schlott B. Grosse F.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Sensor chips CM5, surfactant P20, and the amine coupling kit were purchased from BIAcore AB. The antibodies were immobilized by amine coupling according to the supplier's protocol. For a final ligand immobilization yield of 1,000 relative resonance units, about 1800 resonance units of the antibody was initially attached to the flow cell surface. The anti-DNA-polymerase α monoclonal antibody 2CT25 (50 μg/ml) was loaded at a flow rate of 5 μl/min in 0.03 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. The ligands, four subunit DNA polymerase α-primases, and the analyte, SV40 TAg, were microdialyzed against the binding buffer 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, and 0.005% P20 before use. The ligands were loaded to a 8–100 μg/ml concentration and cross-linked to the antibody by using the amino coupling kit. For the studies between 1,500 and 10,000 resonance units of the ligands were immobilized. The binding studies were usually performed with 5–70 μg/ml of SV40 TAg as an analyte at 25 °C and a flow rate of 40 μl/min. After recording of the association and dissociation phases, the remaining non-cross-linked protein-protein contacts were dissociated by regenerating the flow cells with 0.1 m K3PO4, pH 12, for 30 s. A control cell contained antibody without loaded ligand to correct for nonspecific binding. The data were collected at 1 Hz and analyzed using the BIAevaluation program 3.0. Human and murine p180 show 88% identity at the amino acid level, and the corresponding similarity at the DNA level allowed us to construct exchange mutants between the two genes using conserved restriction sites (see “Materials and Methods” and Fig. 1). Initially four mutants were constructed in which either part of or the entire TAg-binding site was exchanged. The mutants were named H nM or M nH, where the first and last letters denote the origin (human or murine) of the N and C termini, respectively, and the number (n) denotes the amino acid residue at the transition between the human and murine sequences. These mutants were able to form complexes with the three smaller human DNA polymerase α-primase subunits (p48, p58, and p68), and furthermore, these complexes possessed both specific DNA polymerase and primase activities in the range of those of the wild type, indicating that the exchanges had not disrupted the basic enzymatic functions of the various DNA polymerase α-primase complexes (Table I and Fig. 2). Indeed, all of the complexes could efficiently carry out coupled primer synthesis and elongation on ssDNA (data not shown).Table ISpecific DNA polymerase and primase activities of DNA polymerase α-primase complexes used in this studyComplexProteinSp.
